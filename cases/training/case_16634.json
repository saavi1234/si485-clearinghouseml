    "summary": "<p>This case involved a challenge to the Trump Administration's immigration policies concerning asylum and family separation.</p><p>On June 26, 2018, a coalition of states filed this complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington against the Trump Administration and its top immigration officials, challenging the Administration’s practice of refusing entry to asylum applicants at the southern border as well as its family separation policy. The states, represented by their attorneys general, were Washington, California, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Virginia, and the District of Columbia. The states alleged that they suffered immediate and irreparable injuries to their sovereign, proprietary and quasi-sovereign interests, and sought relief for substantive and procedural due process violations, equal protection violations, and violations under the Administrative Procedure Act and asylum laws. The case was assigned to District Judge Marsha Pechman.</p><p>Specifically, the states argued that the Administration’s policies harmed their sovereign and proprietary interests by 1) interfering with their licensing authority and rendering them unable to enforce their own legal mandates and public policy, and 2) burdening their state-funded legal, healthcare, education, and other programs. They also argued that their quasi-sovereign interests in protecting the health and well-being of their residents were harmed by the policy.</p><p>On July 11, 2018, the federal government moved to dismiss, transfer, or stay the proceedings pending the resolution of a related class-action lawsuit, <u>Ms. L. v. ICE</u>, which was active in the Southern District of California. It's <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16620\">here</a> in the Clearinghouse). According to the federal government, the states wished to engage in “sweeping and burdensome” discovery, duplicative of what was already being conducted in <u>Ms. L</u> In that case, a class of parents who had been separated from their children had already been certified. Since the class members in <u>Ms. L</u> included individuals the plaintiff states purported to represent, the defendants claimed that ongoing litigation in the present court would interfere with the orderly administration of that case. The defendants argued that the court should dismiss the case out of comity and, in the alternative, that the case should be transferred to the Southern District of California or stayed until the <u>Ms. L</u> case had progressed further.  </p><p>On August 8, 2018, Judge Pechman heard oral arguments on the motion to dismiss, transfer, or stay the proceedings. She ordered the case transferred to the Southern District of California, finding that there was substantial overlap between the states’ claim in this case and the class claim in <u>Ms. L</u> Judge Pechman noted that the government had much to do in the way of reuniting separated families and that requiring the government to respond to multiple orders from multiple district courts would only stand in the way of those efforts. 2018 WL 3752220. </p><p>The case was transferred to the Southern District of California and given a new docket number, 3:18-cv-1979. It was assigned to Judge Dana M. Sabraw. </p><p>On March 18, 2019, the defendants requested that the proceedings in the present case either be bifurcated or held in abeyance. On May 20, Judge Sabraw granted defendants' request to hold this case in abeyance pending the outcome of the proceedings in <u>Ms. L</u>.</p><p>(As of June 23, 2021, in <u>Ms. L. v. ICE</u>, the parties continued to work on implementing their court-approved settlement agreement. Additionally, a steering committee was continuing efforts to contact all parties and attorneys relevant to the certified class. The above was reported in a joint status report published on May 19, 2021.</p><p>This case is ongoing, though in abeyance.</p>",

INTRODUCTION \n12 \n1.  The States of Washington, California, Maryland, Oregon, New Mexico, New \n13 \n14  Jersey, Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Rhode Island, New York, Vermont, North Carolina, and \n15  Delaware; the Commonwealths of Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia; and the District \n16 \nof Columbia (collectively, the States) bring this action to protect the States and their residents \n17 \nagainst the Trump Administration’s practice of refusing entry to asylum applicants who present \n18 \nat Southwestern border ports of entry and its cruel and unlawful policy of forcibly separating \n19 \nfamilies who enter the country along our Southwestern border. \n20 \n2.  Widespread news reports, as well as interviews of detainees in Seattle and \n21 \n22  elsewhere, confirm that families fleeing violence and persecution in their home countries who \n23 \ntry to present themselves at Southwestern ports of entry to seek asylum are being refused entry \n24 \ninto the United States.  Border officials are unlawfully turning away these families on the pretext \n25 \nthat the United States is “full” or no longer accepting asylum seekers.  This unlawful practice \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  2  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue. Suite 2000 \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00939   Document 1   Filed 06/26/18   Page 3 of 128\n \n1  exacerbates the trauma already suffered by refugee families while simultaneously artificially \n2 \nincreasing illegal entry violations. \n3 \n3.  For those families that do enter the United States along the Southwestern border, \n4 \nimmigration  officials  have  implemented  the  Trump  Administration’s  policy  of  forcibly \n5 \nseparating parents from their children – regardless of the family’s circumstances or the needs of \n6 \nthe children.  As of June 20, 2018, the new policy had already resulted in the separation of over \n7 \n8  two thousand children from their parents at the Southwestern border, most recently at a rate of \n9 \n50-70 families separated every day.  Defendants have taken children as young as infants from \n10 \ntheir parents, often with no warning or opportunity to say goodbye, and providing no information \n11 \nabout where the children are being taken or when they will next see each other.  The States’ \n12 \ninterviews of detainees in their respective jurisdictions confirm the gratuitous harm that this \n13 \npolicy inflicts on parents and children and the immediate and deleterious impact it has on \n14 \n15  families and communities. \n16  4.  As of June 25, 2018, emerging reports suggest that immigration officials are now \n17 \nusing the children taken from their parents as leverage to coerce parents to withdraw their asylum \n18 \nclaims. \n19 \n5.  Defendants have repeatedly and publicly admitted that a policy of intentionally \n20 \nseparating immigrant children from their parents would be “cruel, “horrible,” and “antithetical \n21 \nto child welfare.”  But they have alternately claimed that they have no such policy, or that it is \n22 \n23  somehow mandated by federal law or prior court decisions. \n24  6.  In truth, however, Defendants have embraced a policy of separating parents from \n25 \ntheir children for the express purpose of deterring immigration along the Southwestern border \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  3  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue. Suite 2000 \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00939   Document 1   Filed 06/26/18   Page 4 of 128\n \n1  (the “Policy”). No law or court decision requires such separation. Rather, Defendants have \n2 \nchosen to adopt the Policy as part of their “zero tolerance” or “100 percent prosecution” approach \n3 \nto individuals who enter the country unlawfully, irrespective of circumstances, and to then use \n4 \nsuch misdemeanor criminal charges to detain parents indefinitely in federal facilities that cannot \n5 \naccommodate families.   \n6 \n7.  Hundreds of children are left to languish in makeshift detention facilities – where \n7 \n8  staff are sometimes told not to comfort them – until a placement is found for the child. \n9 \nDefendants have moved the children and parents to different locations all over the country. While \n10 \nthe parents are held in federal facilities to await further immigration proceedings, their children \n11 \nare sent elsewhere to group shelters or family placements. \n12 \n8.  Defendants have made clear that the purpose of separating families is not to \n13 \nprotect children, but rather to create a public spectacle designed to deter potential immigrants \n14 \n15  from coming to the United States. As Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway said \n16  recently:  “Nobody likes seeing babies ripped from their mothers’ arms  . . . but we have to make \n17 \nsure that DHS’ laws are understood through the soundbite culture that we live in.” KellyAnne \n18 \nConway: ‘Nobody likes’ Policy Separating Migrant Kids at the Border (June 17, 2018) available \n19 \nat  https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/conway-nobody-likes-policy-separating-\n20 \nmigrant-kids-border-n884016, attached hereto as Ex. 1. Defendants’ Policy is causing severe, \n21 \nintentional, and permanent trauma to the children and parents who are separated in furtherance \n22 \n23  of an illegitimate deterrence objective. \n24  9.  On June 20, 2018, President Trump signed an Executive Order purporting to \n25 \nsuspend the Policy, but any relief offered by the Order is illusory. The Order says nothing about \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  4  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue. Suite 2000 \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00939   Document 1   Filed 06/26/18   Page 5 of 128\n \n1  reuniting the families already ripped apart by the federal government, and Trump Administration \n2 \nofficials have made clear the Order will have no impact on the thousands of families who have \n3 \nalready been traumatized.   \n4 \n10.  Moreover, based on its text and contemporaneous statements by Administration \n5 \nofficials, it is clear the Order does not require the end of family separation. In fact, the \n6 \nAdministration currently lacks both the capacity and the legal authority to detain families \n7 \n8  together for indefinite periods of time, which is what the Order contemplates as the alternative \n9 \nto separating families.  \n10 \n11.  On June 21, 2018, as required by the Order, Attorney General Sessions filed an \n11 \nEx Parte Application for relief from the Flores Settlement (a 1997 agreement which sets national \n12 \nstandards regarding the detention, release, and treatment of all children in DHS custody). That \n13 \nrequest seeks rescission of Flores’ protections so that families may be detained indefinitely \n14 \n15  during the pendency of any immigration proceedings involving their members, a plan that raises \n16  the specter of internment camps. \n17 \n12.  Moreover, the Flores application seeks a “determin[ation] that the Agreement’s \n18 \nstate licensure requirement does not apply to ICE family residential facilities.” The government’s \n19 \nattempt to modify the Flores settlement terms by removing States’ licensing authority and \n20 \njurisdiction over such facilities is a direct attack on the States’ sovereign powers. \n21 \n13.  Neither the Order nor the Administration’s Flores application offer any assurance \n22 \n23  that the Administration will not return to a family separation policy when its efforts to intern \n24  families together fail.  In response to the public outcry against family separation, in recent days \n25 \nPresident Trump has proposed that Homeland Security simply deport immigrants without \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  5  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

The Policy, and the Trump Administration’s subsequent attempt to shield their \n4 \nfacilities from state licensing standards, is an affront to States’ sovereign interests in enforcing \n5 \ntheir laws governing minimum standards of care for children, declaring the family unit to be a \n6 \nfundamental resource of American life that should be nurtured, and requiring the preservation of \n7 \n8  the parent-child  relationship unless the  child’s  right to  basic nurture,  health, or safety  is \n9 \njeopardized. The Policy also adversely affects the States’ proprietary interests, forcing States to \n10 \nexpend resources to remediate the harms inflicted by the Policy, some of which are likely to be \n11 \npermanent. State programs, including child welfare services, social and health services, courts, \n12 \nand public schools are all experiencing fiscal impacts due to family separation that will only \n13 \nincrease. The Policy, and the Administration’s related conduct, has caused severe and immediate \n14 \n15  harm to the States and their residents, including parents who are detained, released, or otherwise \n16  reside in the States after being forcibly separated from their children; children who are placed in \n17 \nfacilities, shelters, sponsor homes, foster care, or who otherwise reside in the States after being \n18 \nseparated from their parents; extended families and sponsors in the States; and the States’ \n19 \nimmigrant communities.   \n20 \n15.  The Court should declare the practice of refusing to accept asylum seekers who \n21 \npresent at Southwestern points of entry and the related Policy of family separation illegal and \n22 \n23  order Defendants to stop implementing them immediately. The Court should order Defendants \n24  to reunite every family separated by these unlawful acts immediately, and to take such other \n25 \nactions as are warranted by the time of hearing. Defendants’ conduct has caused real harms to \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  6  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n4 \n16.  The Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 2201(a). The United \n5 \nStates’ sovereign immunity is waived by 5 U.S.C. § 702. \n6 \n17.  Venue  is  proper  in  this  district  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  §§  1391(b)(2)  and \n7 \n8  1391(e)(1). Defendants are the United States of America and United States agencies or officers \n9 \nsued in their official capacities. The State of Washington is a resident of this judicial district, and \n10 \na substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to this Complaint occurred within the \n11 \nWestern District of Washington. For example, as of June 18, 2018, parents who were recently \n12 \nrefused entry and then victimized by the Policy were being detained at the Federal Detention \n13 \nCenter – SeaTac, which is located in King County. At that time, a number of children who were \n14 \n15  separated from their parents pursuant to the Policy also were being detained in Seattle and other \n16  nearby locations. \n17 \n18.  The States bring this action to redress harms to their sovereign, proprietary, and \n18 \nparens patriae interests. \n19 \nIII.  PARTIES \n20 \nA.  Plaintiffs \n21 \n19.  The Plaintiff States of Washington, California, Maryland, Oregon, New Mexico, \n22 \n23  New Jersey, Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Rhode Island, New York, Vermont, North Carolina, \n24  Delaware, and the Commonwealths of Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, represented \n25 \nby and through their Attorneys General, are sovereign states of the United States of America. \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  7  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

The States are aggrieved and have standing to bring this action because of the \n5 \ninjuries to the States caused by the Policy, including immediate and irreparable injuries to their \n6 \nsovereign, proprietary, and quasi-sovereign interests. \n7 \n8  21.  Nothing in the June 20 Executive Order remedies these harms, and the June 21 \n9 \napplication to modify Flores is a direct attack on the sovereign powers of the States. \n10 \nB.  Defendant Federal Agencies and Officers \n11 \n22.  Defendant the United States of America includes government agencies and \n12 \ndepartments responsible for the implementation of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) \n13 \nand the admission, detention, and removal of non-citizens who are traveling or returning to the \n14 \n15  United States via air, land, and sea ports across the United States. \n16  23.  Defendant Donald Trump is the President of the United States, and he is sued in \n17 \nhis official capacity. \n18 \n24.  Defendant Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is a federal cabinet agency \n19 \nresponsible for implementing and enforcing the INA.  DHS is a Department of the Executive \n20 \nBranch of the U.S. Government, and is an agency within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(f). \n21 \n25.  Defendant  Immigration  and  Customs  Enforcement  (ICE)  is  the  component \n22 \n23  agency of DHS that is responsible for carrying out removal orders; operating adult immigration \n24  detention facilities; and contracting for the detention of immigrants in removal proceedings, \n25 \nincluding with public and private operators of detention centers, jails, and prisons. \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  8  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is an Operational and Support \n2 \nComponent agency within DHS.  CBP is responsible for detaining and/or removing non-citizens \n3 \narriving at air, land, and sea ports across the United States. \n4 \n27.  Defendant U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is a component \n5 \nagency of DHS that, through its Asylum Officers, conducts interviews of certain individuals \n6 \napprehended at the border to determine whether they have a credible fear of persecution and \n7 \n8  should be permitted to apply for asylum.  \n9 \n28.  Defendant  U.S.  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  (HHS)  is  a \n10 \ndepartment of the executive branch of the U.S. government.  \n11 \n29.  Defendant Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) is a component of HHS which \n12 \nprovides care for and placement for unaccompanied noncitizen children.  \n13 \n30.

ALLEGATIONS \n4 \nA.  Federal Immigration Policy Has Traditionally Emphasized Family Reunification, \n5 \nRecognizing that Children Belong with their Families \n6 \n36.  When DHS, typically through ICE or CBP, detains an undocumented child who \n7 \nis traveling alone, i.e., unaccompanied by a parent, the relevant federal agencies follow an \n8 \nestablished process.  Specifically, ICE or CBP may detain an unaccompanied alien child (UAC) \n9 \nfor up to 72 hours, as other federal agencies locate an appropriate shelter facility for that child. \n10 \n8 U.S.C. § 1232(b)(3).  ICE or CBP then must turn the child over to the ORR for shelter \n11 \n12  placement.  Id. \n13  37.  Once  in  ORR  custody,  children  are  placed  in  ORR-funded  and  supervised \n14 \nshelters, where staff must attempt to locate a parent and determine if family reunification is \n15 \npossible.  If ORR is unable to find a parent, ORR staff will try to locate another family member, \n16 \nrelative, family friend, or caretaker in the United States to serve as a sponsor who can care for \n17 \nthe child during the pendency of any subsequent immigration proceeding.   \n18 \n38.  Unaccompanied children in ORR custody for whom no sponsor placement can \n19 \n20  be made are moved to secondary ORR-contracted and state-licensed group care facilities, which \n21 \ncan be anywhere in the country.  In such cases, if ORR assesses that the child has a pathway to \n22 \nlegal immigration status, ORR will place the child in an ORR-contracted and state-licensed long \n23 \nterm foster care program while the immigration process continues.  If ORR determines that a \n24 \npathway does not exist, the child may remain in a shelter or ORR-contracted and state-licensed \n25 \ngroup care during removal proceedings. \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  10  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue. Suite 2000 \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00939   Document 1   Filed 06/26/18   Page 11 of 128\n \n1  39.  Thus, unaccompanied children typically arrive in the individual states in three \n2 \nways:  they may be placed initially in a state-licensed shelter located in the state while ORR \n3 \ndetermines if a family member can be found in the country; they may arrive when ORR releases \n4 \nthem to the care of an in-state sponsor while their immigration proceeding goes forward; or they \n5 \ncan be moved into a placement in an ORR-contracted and state-licensed long term foster care \n6 \nprogram as they await their immigration proceeding.  \n7 \n8  40.  While ORR’s initial shelter care placement and long term foster care programs \n9 \nare largely federally funded, an unaccompanied child’s in-state placements impose burdens on \n10 \nthe receiving state, discussed below. \n11 \n12  B.  After  Almost  a  Year  of  Threats,  Defendants  Adopted  an  Official  Policy  of \nSeparating Families Who Cross the Southwestern Border, Creating a New Class of \n13  “Unaccompanied” Children \n14  41.  For over a year, the Trump Administration has made clear in numerous public \n15  statements that it was considering an official Policy to separate families at the Southwestern \n16 \nborder in an effort to deter immigrants from Latin America from coming to the United States. \n17 \n42.  As early as March 2017, a senior DHS official stated that Defendants were \n18 \nconsidering a proposal to separate children from their parents at the Southwestern border.  See \n19 \nMary Kay Mallonee, DHS Considering Proposal to Separate Children From Adults at Border \n20 \n(March  4,  2017)  available  at  https://www.cnn.com/2017/03/03/politics/dhs-children-adults-\n21 \n22  border/, attached hereto as Ex. 2.  \n23 \n43.  On March 7, 2017, John Kelly, the then-Secretary of DHS, confirmed that DHS \n24 \nwas considering a policy of separating children from their parents:  “I am considering that. They \n25 \nwill be well cared for as we deal with their parents.” See Daniella Diaz, Kelly: DHS Considering \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  11  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue. Suite 2000 \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00939   Document 1   Filed 06/26/18   Page 12 of 128\n \n1  Separating  Undocumented  Children  From  Their  Parents  at  the  Border  (March  7,  2017) \n2 \navailable  at  https://www.cnn.com/2017/03/06/politics/john-kelly-separating-children-from-\n3 \nparents-immigration-border/index.html, attached hereto as Ex. 3. \n4 \n44.  Then-Secretary Kelly publicly backed away from those statements after harsh \n5 \ncriticism from the press, human-rights advocates, and members of Congress.   See Tal Kopan, \n6 \nKelly  Says  DHS  Won’t  Separate  Families  at  the  Border  (March  29,  2017)  available  at \n7 \n8  https://www.cnn.com/2017/03/29/politics/border-families-separation-kelly/index.html  and \n9 \nattached hereto as Ex. 4.   An inside source, however, reported that the family separation proposal \n10 \nwas still on the table for discussion at DHS as of August 2017.  See Jonathan Blitzer, How the \n11 \nTrump Administration Got Comfortable Separating Immigrant Kids From Their Parents, The \n12 \nNew Yorker (May 30, 2018) available at https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-\n13 \nthe-trump-administration-got-comfortable-separating-immigrant-kids-from-their-parents, \n14 \n15  attached hereto as Ex. 5. \n16  45.  In fact, DHS secretly piloted the Policy in the El Paso sector of the border in \n17 \nwestern Texas from July to November 2017.  See Dara Lind, Trump’s DHS is Using an \n18 \nExtremely Dubious Statistic to Justify Splitting up Families at the Border, Vox (May 8, 2018) \n19 \navailable  at  https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/5/8/17327512/sessions-illegal-\n20 \nimmigration-border-asylum-families, attached hereto as Ex. 6. \n21 \n46.  It was later reported that between October 2017 and April 2018, 700 families \n22 \n23  were separated at the Southwestern border, including at least 100 children under the age of four. \n24  See Ex. 3. \n25 \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  12  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue. Suite 2000 \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00939   Document 1   Filed 06/26/18   Page 13 of 128\n \n1  47.  On February 12, 2018, 33 U.S. Senators also a letter to DHS Secretary Nielsen, \n2 \nconcerned that DHS was carrying out “a systematic and blanket policy to separate a child from \n3 \na parent” upon arrival to the United States—a policy the Senators condemned as “cruel” and \n4 \n“grotesquely inhumane.” The letter is attached hereto as Ex. 7. The letter notes that Secretary \n5 \nNielsen “failed to repudiate” such a policy during a recent Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, \n6 \nand points to “numerous [documented] cases in which parents have been separated from their \n7 \n8  children.” Id.  \n9 \n48.  In the spring of 2018, an influx of families seeking to enter the United States may \n10 \nhave catalyzed the Administration to finally embrace the Policy.  In March and April of 2018, \n11 \nthe number of families from Latin America apprehended at the Southwestern border increased \n12 \ndramatically, going from 5,475 in February to 8,873 in March (a 62% increase) and 9,653 in \n13 \nApril (a 76% increase from February).  See Southwest Border Migration FY2018, U.S. Dept. of \n14 \n15  Homeland  Security  available  at  https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/sw-border-migration, \n16  attached hereto as Ex. 8 and Southwest Border Migration FY2017, U.S. Dept. of Homeland \n17 \nSecurity  available  at  https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/sw-border-migration-fy2017#, \n18 \nattached hereto as Ex. 91.   \n19 \n20 \n21 \n                                                 \n22  1 CBP tracks “apprehensions” and “inadmissibles” separately and adds these together to count \n“total enforcement actions.”  See CBP Enforcement Statistics FY2018, U.S. Customs and Border \n23  Protection available at https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-statistics, attached hereto \nas Ex. 10.  “Inadmissibles refers to individuals encountered at ports of entry who are seeking lawful \n24 \nadmission into the United States but are determined to be inadmissible, individuals presenting themselves \nto seek humanitarian protection under our laws, and individuals who withdraw an application for \n25 \nadmission and return to their countries of origin within a short timeframe.” Id. “Apprehensions refers to \nthe physical control or temporary detainment of a person who is not lawfully in the U.S. which may or \n26 \nmay not result in an arrest.”  Id.  \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  13  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

The number of family units deemed to be inadmissible went from 3,941 in \n2 \nFebruary to 5,162 in March (a 31% increase) and 5,445 in April (a 38% increase from February). \n3 \nSee Ex. 8.  These numbers include all persons who enter at ports of entry but are deemed to be \n4 \ninadmissible; asylum seekers; and individuals who apply for admission but subsequently return \n5 \nto their countries of origin within a short time frame.  See Ex. 9.  The numbers reflected an \n6 \nincrease of 672% in March 2018 in comparison to March 2017, and 697% in April 2018 in \n7 \n8  comparison to April 2017.  Compare Exs. 8 and 9. \n9 \n50.  According to at least one source, the President’s frustration with the rising \n10 \nnumbers of Latino immigrants at the Southwestern border in March and April of 2018 was the \n11 \nimpetus for publicly adopting the Policy.  See Ex. 5.  When asked what had changed since the \n12 \nprior year – when the Administration backed away from adopting such a policy – the person \n13 \npointed to the President:  “What you’re seeing now is a President’s frustration with the fact that \n14 \n15  the numbers are back up.”  Id. \n16  51.  In early April 2018, President Trump reportedly expressed frustration with DHS \n17 \nSecretary Nielsen for failing to stop or decrease immigration at the Southwestern border.  Several \n18 \nofficials stated that one persistent issue was President Trump’s belief that Secretary Nielsen and \n19 \nDHS were resisting his direction that parents be separated from their children when crossing \n20 \nunlawfully at the US-Mexico border.

Id. \n3 \n52.  On April 6, 2018, President Trump issued a memorandum directing Attorney \n4 \nGeneral Sessions and DHS Secretary Nielsen to detail all measures and identify any resources \n5 \nor steps “needed to expeditiously end ‘catch and release’ practices” that allow undocumented \n6 \nimmigrants to be released into the community pending resolution of their immigration cases.  \n7 \n8  53.  That  same  day,  Attorney  General  Sessions  formally  announced  a \n9 \n“zero-tolerance” policy “for offenses under 8 U.S.C. § 1325(a), which prohibits both attempted \n10 \nillegal entry and illegal entry into the United States by an alien.”  See Attorney General \n11 \nAnnounces Zero-Tolerance Policy for Criminal Illegal Entry, U.S. Department of Justice (April \n12 \n6,  2018)  available  at  https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-announces-zero-\n13 \ntolerance-policy-criminal-illegal-entry, attached hereto as Ex. 12.   \n14 \n15  54.  In a memorandum also issued April 6, Attorney General Sessions “direct[ed] each \n16  United States Attorney’s Office along the Southwest Border . . . to adopt immediately a \n17 \nzero-tolerance policy for all offenses referred for prosecution under section 1325(a)” and made \n18 \nclear that this directive “superseded any existing policy.”  See Memorandum for Federal \n19 \nProsecutors Along the Southwest Border (April 6, 2018), attached hereto as Ex. 13. \n20 \n55.  On May 7, 2018, DHS adopted an official Policy of “referring 100 percent of \n21 \nillegal Southwest Border crossings to the Department of Justice for prosecution,” and Attorney \n22 \n23  General Sessions publicized that children would be automatically separated from parents or other \n24  adults with whom they were traveling.

With that, Attorney General Sessions and Secretary Nielsen carried out President \n4 \nTrump’s directive:  Under the new federal law enforcement priority, all undocumented adults \n5 \ncrossing the U.S.-Mexico border at unauthorized locations would be referred by DHS to the \n6 \nDepartment of Justice.  DOJ would then charge each adult with misdemeanor illegal entry or \n7 \n8  reentry.    Everyone  so  referred  would  be  prosecuted  and  detained  regardless  of  familial \n9 \ncircumstances or asylum claims, and children would be automatically separated from their \n10 \nparents and transferred to the custody of ORR for placement elsewhere.   \n11 \n57.  Accordingly, Defendants have thus created a new category of “unaccompanied” \n12 \nchildren – those who came into the country with a parent but were, pursuant to the Policy, \n13 \nforcibly separated by ICE or CBP immediately thereafter. \n14 \n15  58.  Perhaps emboldened by the directive, DHS officers at ports of entry along the \n16  Southwestern border have been refusing to let immigrants present themselves and request \n17 \nasylum, turning people away because the United States is “full.”   See Alfredo Corchado, Asylum \n18 \nSeekers Reportedly Denied Entry at Border as Trump Tightens ‘Zero Tolerance’ Immigration \n19 \nPolicies  (June  6,  2018)  available  at \n20 \nhttps://www.dallasnews.com/news/immigration/2018/06/06/reports-turning-back-asylum-\n21 \nseekers-border-crossings-trump-tightens-grip-zero-tolerance-immigration-policies,  attached \n22 \n23  hereto as Ex. 15.  \n24  59.

Id.  Ruben Garcia, founder of a nonprofit that assists \n2 \nimmigrants in El Paso explains: “If you look indigenous and you look Central American, they \n3 \nwill stop you . . .  They never ask why they are coming.  They just say we can’t receive you.”  \n4 \nId.  When asked why they are refusing to allow immigrants to reach checkpoints to request \n5 \nasylum, CBP officials state that centers are “full.”  Id. \n6 \n60.  Recent interviews  with detained parents held in federal facilities in Seattle \n7 \n8  confirm these reports.  For example, one mother presented herself and her 15-year old son at the \n9 \nLaredo, Texas port of entry and requested asylum for herself and safe passage for her American-\n10 \ncitizen son.  Officials at the port of entry detained her, separated her from her son, and told her \n11 \nthat the United Sates “will not give [her] asylum” and that she “w[ould] not see [her] son again \n12 \nuntil he turns 18” because he would be taken to a shelter or given to an American family for \n13 \nadoption.  Another mother claiming asylum was told, in front of her 14-year-old daughter, that \n14 \n15  she would be “punished with jail time” for having come to the United States.  \n16  61.  The effect of this conduct is an increasing influx of entrants at locations other \n17 \nthan ports of entry, which Defendants construe as violations of 8 U.S.C. § 1325 and its \n18 \nimplementing regulations.  The adults are then routed into the criminal system while the children \n19 \nare turned over to ORR for placement – thereby separating the family and implementing the \n20 \nPolicy. \n21 \n62.  Since announcing the Policy, Defendants have repeatedly  acknowledged its \n22 \n23  existence and cruelty.  For example, President Trump, tweeting on May 26, 2018, referred to the \n24  Policy as a “horrible law.”  The May 26, 2018 tweet is attached hereto as Ex. 16. \n25 \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  17  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

While others acknowledge the controversial nature \n13 \nof the Policy, Mr. Miller unapologetically embraced it, calling it “a simple decision by the \n14 \n15  administration . . . . The message is that no one is exempt from immigration law.” Id. \n16  65.  On June 17, 2018, Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway acknowledged \n17 \nthe existence of the Policy in an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press,” stating, “As a mother, \n18 \nas a Catholic, as somebody who has a conscience . . . I will tell you that nobody likes this policy.”  \n19 \nSee Ex. 1.  She continued, “Nobody likes seeing babies ripped from their mothers’ arms, from \n20 \ntheir mothers’ wombs, frankly, but we have to make sure that DHS’ laws are understood through \n21 \nthe soundbite culture that we live in.”  Id.  \n22 \n23  66.  On June 18, 2018, President Trump characterized the Policy as one of the United \n24  States’ “horrible and tough” immigration laws.

Also on June 18, 2018, in remarks before the National Sheriffs’ Association \n4 \n(NSA), Attorney General Sessions promoted the deterrent effect of family separation:  “We \n5 \ncannot and will not encourage people to bring their children or other children to the country \n6 \nunlawfully by giving them immunity in the process.”  See Luis Sanchez, Sessions on separating \n7 \n8  families: If we build a wall and pass legislation, we won’t have these ‘terrible choices’, The Hill \n9 \n(June 18, 2018) available at http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/392785-sessions-on-\n10 \nseparating-families-if-we-build-a-wall-and-pass, attached hereto as Ex. 20.  \n11 \n68.  And in her remarks to the NSA, DHS Secretary Nielsen also confirmed the \n12 \nexistence of the Policy, stating:  “Illegal actions have and must have consequences.  No more \n13 \nfree passes, no more get out of jail free cards.”  See Tal Kopan, ‘We will not apologize’: Trump \n14 \n15  DHS  chief  defends  immigration  policy  (June  18,  2018)  available  at \n16  https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/18/politics/kirstjen-nielsen-immigration-policy/index.html, \n17 \nattached hereto as Ex. 21.  \n18 \n69.  The Policy has resulted in thousands of brutal familial separations. \n19 \n70.  For example, during a briefing call on June 15, 2018, DHS officials admitted that \n20 \n1,995 children were separated from 1,940 adults at the U.S.-Mexico border from April 19 \n21 \nthrough May 31, 2018.

According to DHS data released on June 18, 2018 by Senator Dianne Feinstein, \n2 \nfederal immigration officials separated 2,342 children from adults at the border between May 5 \n3 \nand June 9, 2018.  See Louis Nelson, Defiant Trump refuses to back off migrant family \n4 \nseparations,  Politico  (June  18,  2018)  available  at \n5 \nhttps://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/18/trump-immigration-child-separations-650875, \n6 \nattached hereto as Ex. 23.  \n7 \n8  C.  The President’s Executive Order Does Not End Family Separation \n9 \n72.  On  June  20,  2018,  President  Trump  issued  an  Executive  Order  entitled, \n10 \n“Affording Congress an Opportunity to Address Family Separation” (the Order).   The Order is \n11 \nattached hereto as Ex. 24.  While purporting to suspend the practice of separating families, the \n12 \nOrder offers illusory relief.   Indeed, the language of the Order itself does not actually require an \n13 \nend to family separation, and in fact, it implicitly recognizes that the Policy will continue.  \n14 \n15  73.  By its own terms, the Order states that it does not confer any enforceable right or \n16  benefit on any person.   \n17 \n74.  The Order appears to direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to detain families \n18 \ntogether “during the pendency of any criminal proceedings for improper entry or immigration \n19 \nproceedings  involving  their  members,”  while  continuing  the  practice  of  prosecuting  and \n20 \ndetaining all unauthorized border crossers.   \n21 \n75.  At the same time, the Order acknowledges that Defendants do not have the \n22 \n23  resources or facilities necessary to effectuate its terms.   Indeed, every provision of the Order is \n24  to be carried out only “where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources.”  \n25 \nThese terms are undefined, leaving familial detention largely discretionary.  Likewise, the Order \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  20  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue. Suite 2000 \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00939   Document 1   Filed 06/26/18   Page 21 of 128\n \n1  repeatedly affirms that family unity is “subject to the availability of appropriations,” but provides \n2 \nno parameters on when appropriations will be sought or even how much funding is needed.   \n3 \n76.  Similarly, the Order directs the Secretary of Defense to provide existing available \n4 \nfacilities to house immigrant families, or to construct them, but again there is no indication that \n5 \nappropriate  federal  facilities  exist  and  are  available,  or  that  construction  of  new  family \n6 \ninternment facilities is feasible.   \n7 \n8  77.  The Order also acknowledges that Defendants cannot lawfully carry out its terms \n9 \nuntil they receive a court order “that would permit” the family detention scheme contemplated.  \n10 \nBecause almost every provision in the Order is subject to the availability of non-existent \n11 \nresources and legal authority for indefinite detention that is contrary to settled law, it fails to \n12 \nprovide any actual relief.  \n13 \n78.  The Order also is silent as to the thousands of families already separated by the \n14 \n15  Policy.  It does nothing to require their reunification or redress the harms inflicted on those \n16  families.  As a spokesperson for HHS’ Administration for Children and Families explained, \n17 \n“There will not be a grandfathering of existing cases … I can tell you definitively that is going \n18 \nto be policy.”  See Michael D. Shear, Abby Goodnough and Maggie Haberman, Trump Retreats \n19 \non Separating Families, but Thousands May Remain Apart, (June 20, 2018) available at \n20 \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/us/politics/trump-immigration-children-executive-\n21 \norder.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=a-\n22 \n23  lede-package-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news, attached as Ex. 25. \n24  79.

Likewise, just days prior to issuance of the Order, Defendants stated numerous \n13 \ntimes their position that only Congress could end a policy of separating families.  For example, \n14 \n15  on June 18, 2018, Secretary Nielsen announced: “Until these loopholes are closed by Congress, \n16  it is not possible, as a matter of law, to detain and remove whole family units who arrive illegally \n17 \nin the United States.  Congress and the courts created this problem, and Congress alone can fix \n18 \nit.  Until then, we will enforce every law we have on the books to defend the sovereignty and \n19 \nsecurity of the United States.”  See Matthew Nussbaum, Trump falsely claimed for days that he \n20 \ncouldn’t  end  family  separations  (June  20,  2018)  available  at \n21 \nhttps://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/20/trump-false-claims-family-separations-656011, \n22 \n23  attached hereto as Ex. 27. \n24  81.

That’s why the President has repeatedly \n2 \ncalled on them to work with him to do just that.”  Id. \n3 \n82.  And on June 20, 2018, contemporaneous with announcing the Order, Vice \n4 \nPresident Pence claimed that changing the law was the only way to end family separation: “I \n5 \nthink the American people want the Democrats to stop the obstruction, to stop standing in the \n6 \nway of the kind of reforms at our border that will end the crisis of illegal immigration.  We can \n7 \n8  solve this issue of separation.”  See Vice President Mike Pence: Democrats Can Fix Family \n9 \nSeparation at Border (June 20, 2018) available at https://kdkaradio.radio.com/articles/vice-\n10 \npresident-mike-pence-democrats-can-fix-family-separation-border, attached hereto as Ex. 28. \n11 \n83.  When President Trump signed the Order, Vice President Pence and Secretary \n12 \nNielsen again called on Congress to end separating families at the border; Vice President Pence \n13 \nsuggested that the Order is only applicable “in the immediate days forward” and “call[ed] on \n14 \n15  Congress  to  change  the  laws”  for  a  more  permanent  fix.

Later that day, at a briefing organized by the White House, Gene Hamilton, a \n19 \ncounselor to Attorney General Sessions, sidestepped a question about whether a family that \n20 \ncrosses the border now would be separated, stating that an “implementation phase” would occur, \n21 \nbut that he was not sure precisely what DHS or HHS would do in the immediate future. Mr. \n22 \n23  Hamilton echoed President Trump’s, Nielsen’s, and Sessions’ statements that “Congress needs \n24  to provide a permanent fix for this situation.”  Mr. Hamilton stated that if Congress does not act, \n25 \nit would be up to the Flores judge to decide whether the Administration could keep families \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  23  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

Pursuant to the Order, the Attorney General Has Launched an Attack on State \n5 \nSovereignty \n6 \n85.  The Order directs the Attorney General to “promptly file a request with the U.S. \n7 \nDistrict Court for the Central District of California to modify the Settlement Agreement in Flores \n8 \nv. Sessions,” making rescission of Flores’ protections a predicate to the maintenance of family \n9 \nunity.   \n10 \n11  86.  The Flores Agreement, which has been in place since 1997, “sets out nationwide \n12  policy for the detention, release, and treatment of minors in the custody of the INS,” including \n13 \nboth accompanied and unaccompanied minors.  Stipulated Settlement Agreement, ¶ 9, attached \n14 \nhereto as Ex. 30.   Among other things, Flores prevents the DHS from detaining children in \n15 \nrestricted facilities for long periods and it requires federal detention centers to meet state \n16 \nlicensing requirements for childcare facilities. \n17 \n87.  As Vice President Pence previously conceded, the Flores agreement provides \n18 \n19  only two options for the long term placement of families—(1) parental detention and family \n20  separation, or (2) keeping families together, by releasing them into the community.   See clip \n21 \navailable at https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4736625/pence-options-law).   \n22 \n88.  On June 21, 2018, Attorney General Sessions filed an ex parte application \n23 \nseeking relief from the Flores Settlement Agreement to allow the federal government to detain \n24 \nfamilies indefinitely at non-licensed facilities.

In his application, Attorney General Sessions admits that mass internment of \n2 \nfamilies by the federal government is currently illegal:  “this Court’s construction of the Flores \n3 \nSettlement Agreement eliminates the practical availability of family detention across the nation \n4 \n. .”  Ex. 31 at 2.  “Under current law and legal rulings, including this Court’s, it is not possible \n5 \nfor the U.S. government to detain families together during the pendency of their immigration \n6 \nproceedings. It cannot be done.”  Id. at 3.  \n7 \n8  90.  Nevertheless,  Attorney  General  Sessions  argues  that  indefinitely  detaining \n9 \nfamilies is necessary for deterrence.  Specifically, he asserts that, without family detention, there \n10 \nis “a powerful incentive for aliens to enter this country with children.”  Id. at 1.  Attorney General \n11 \nSession claims that, “[u]ndeniably the limitation on the option of detaining families together and \n12 \nmarked increase of families illegally crossing the border are linked.”  Id. at 2.  “‘[D]etaining \n13 \nthese individuals dispels such expectations, and deters others from unlawfully coming to the \n14 \n15  United States.’”  Id. at 13 (internal citations omitted). \n16  91.  Attorney  General  Sessions  also  requests  an  exemption  from  state  licensing \n17 \nrequirements, “because of ongoing and unresolved disputes over the ability of States to license \n18 \nthese types of facilities.”  Ex. 31 at 17-18.   \n19 \n92.  The district court and the Ninth Circuit in Flores rejected almost identical \n20 \narguments advanced by the federal government in 2015.  See Flores v. Lynch, 212 F. Supp. 3d \n21 \n907, 913 (C.D. Cal. 2015), aff’d in part, rev’d in part and remanded, 828 F.3d 898 (9th Cir. \n22 \n23  2016); Flores v. Lynch, 828 F.3d 898, 910 (9th Cir. 2016).  At that time, the government \n24  requested that the trial court modify the Flores agreement to allow DHS to hold female-headed \n25 \nfamilies with their children indefinitely in family detention centers in Texas and New Mexico.  \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  25  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

The court stated: “The fact that the [Texas and New Mexico] family \n5 \nresidential centers cannot be licensed by an appropriate state agency simply means that, under \n6 \nthe Agreement, [children] … cannot be housed in these facilities except as permitted by the \n7 \n8  Agreement.”  Id. at 12-13. \n9 \n93.  The district court also found that the alleged “influx” of immigrants crossing the \n10 \nU.S.-Mexico  border  did  not  constitute  changed  circumstances  warranting  the  requested \n11 \nmodification and rejected the government’s stated rationale that the “family detention policy \n12 \n[would] deter[] others who would have come.” Case No. CV 85-4544-DMG (C.D.

The Ninth Circuit affirmed, stating: “The Settlement expressly anticipated an influx \n14 \n15  . . . and, even if the parties did not anticipate an influx of this size, we cannot fathom how a \n16  ‘suitably tailored’ response to the change in circumstances would be to exempt an entire category \n17 \nof migrants from the Settlement, as opposed to, say, relaxing certain requirements applicable to \n18 \nall migrants.” Flores v.

Further, the Trump Administration’s statements from June 20, 2018-June 26, \n10 \n2018 raise the specter of further unconstitutional and unlawful acts.     \n11 \n97.  For example, in response to the public outcry against family separation, the \n12 \nAdministration appears to be preparing to intern thousands of families in military facilities.   As \n13 \nCommissioner McAleenan explained, he is unable to refer parents for prosecution without \n14 \n15  separating them from their children due to lack of resources, but that he and his agency are \n16  working on a plan to resume criminal referrals.

Emerging reports as of June 25, 2018, suggest that immigration officials are using \n16  the children taken from their parents as leverage to coerce parents to withdraw their asylum \n17 \nclaims.  The family reunification Fact Sheet released by the Department of Homeland Security \n18 \non June 23, 2018, provides for family reunification only for adults “who are subject to removal” \n19 \nso that they may be “reunited with their children for the purposes of removal.” See Fact Sheet: \n20 \nZero  Tolerance  Prosecution  and  Family  Reunification  (June  23,  2018)  available  at \n21 \nhttps://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHS/bulletins/1f98ad8, attached hereto as Ex. 35.  \n22 \n23  In other words, parents who hope to be quickly reunited with their children must abandon their \n24  own asylum claims and agree to withdraw their children’s claims to remain in the United States. \n25 \nSee Dara Lind, Trump will reunite separated families – but only if they agree to deportation, \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  28  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

Parents have felt compelled to act accordingly.  On June 24, 2018, a DHS official \n4 \nstated  that  parents  separated  from  their  children  “were  quickly  given  the  option  to  sign \n5 \npaperwork leading to their deportation.

This is consistent with other accounts of parents signing voluntary deportation \n9 \npaperwork out of “desperation” because officials had suggested that it would lead to faster \n10 \nreunification with their children.

Likewise, on June 24, 2018, a senior administrative official speaking on the \n17 \ncondition of anonymity confirmed that defendants do not plan to reunite families until after a \n18 \nparent has lost his or her deportation case, effectively punishing parents who may otherwise \n19 \npursue an asylum claim or other relief request and creating tremendous pressure to abandon such \n20 \nclaims so that parents may be reunited with kids.

In recent days, President Trump has proposed deporting immigrants without \n4 \nhearing or legal process as his favored alternative.  On June 21, 2018 President Trump stated: \n5 \n“We shouldn’t be hiring judges by the thousands, as our ridiculous immigration laws demand, \n6 \nwe should be changing our laws, building the Wall, hire Border Agents and Ice and not let people \n7 \n8  come into our country based on the legal phrase they are told to say as their password.”  See \n9 \nhttps://mobile.twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1009770941604298753. \n10 \n104.  On June 24, 2018, President Trump again proposed that immigrants who cross \n11 \ninto the United States should be sent back immediately without due process or an appearance \n12 \nbefore a judge:  “We cannot allow all of these people to invade our Country.  When somebody \n13 \ncomes in, we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where \n14 \n15  they came.  Our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and Law and Order.

On  June  25,  2018,  White  House  press  secretary  Sarah  Huckabee  Sanders \n4 \nconfirmed that CPB’s halt of prosecution referrals “is a temporary solution. This isn’t going to \n5 \nlast. . . This will only last a short amount of time, because we’re going to run out of space, we’re \n6 \ngoing to run out of resources to keep people together.”  Secretary Sanders reiterated:  “We’re \n7 \n8  not changing the policy . . . We’re simply out of resources. And at some point, Congress has to \n9 \ndo what they were elected to do, and that is secure our border, that is stop the crime coming into \n10 \nour  country.”  Secretary  Sanders  dodged  questions  regarding  President  Trump’s  recent \n11 \nsuggestion that immigrants be afforded no due hearing or due process prior to deportation. See \n12 \nPress  Briefing  by  Press  Secretary  Sarah  Sanders  (June  25,  2018),  available  at \n13 \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-\n14 \n15  062518/. \n16  F.  Defendants’ Policy Causes Devastating Harm To Children and Parents \n17 \n107.  Separating families when a child’s safety is not at risk causes immediate, acute \n18 \ntrauma as well as foreseeable long term damage and harm to both the parents and the children.  \n19 \nThe negative effects and consequences of the Policy are likely to be long-lasting and in some \n20 \ncases debilitating.  \n21 \n108.  Unless required to protect a child’s safety, forced separation from their parents is \n22 \n23  likely to cause immediate and extreme psychological harm to young children, and the resulting \n24  cognitive and emotional damage can be permanent.  Parental separation is a traumatic loss for \n25 \nthe child; as a result they are likely to experience post-traumatic symptoms such as nightmares, \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  31  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

This trauma may be exacerbated for children who are \n4 \nfleeing persecution or violence in their home countries.   \n5 \n109.  Observations by those who have seen children recently separated pursuant to \n6 \nDefendants’ Policy suggest that conditions created by Defendants will further exacerbate the \n7 \n8  separation trauma.  By way of example, after touring a shelter along the Texas border to Mexico, \n9 \nDr. Colleen Kraft, President of the American Academy of Pediatrics, described a “screaming” \n10 \ngirl, “no older than 2” who could not be comforted because shelter workers had been told they \n11 \nare not allowed to touch the children, not even to hold a crying child and convey some semblance \n12 \nof compassion.  See Immigrant children: What a doctor saw in a Texas shelter, The Washington \n13 \nPost  (June  17,  2018)  available  at  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-\n14 \n15  nation/wp/2018/06/16/america-is-better-than-this-what-a-doctor-saw-in-a-texas-shelter-for-\n16  migrant-children/?utm_term=.e1e5566675e9, attached hereto as Ex. 42.  \n17 \n110.  These reports are also consistent with the observations of State employees who \n18 \nrecently interviewed separated children living in Seattle.  Every child displayed significant \n19 \ndistress when relaying their experience and broke down when describing their separation.  Some \n20 \nreported ongoing nightmares, others were so traumatized they could not continue the brief \n21 \ninterviews. \n22 \n23  111.  Similarly, parents who arrive together with their children at the U.S. border and \n24  then are separated from their children by the U.S. government are likely to experience immediate \n25 \nand acute psychological injury as a result.  Under the Policy, many parents are being separated \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  32  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

These otherwise fit parents are likely to experience deterioration of their mental \n7 \n8  and physical health in the aftermath of the forcible separation from their children with symptoms \n9 \nincluding anxiety, depression, PTSD, and other trauma-related disorders. In some cases, parental \n10 \ntrauma from separation from their children will become unbearable because their available \n11 \ncoping mechanisms may be overwhelmed by the sudden loss of the important role of parent and \n12 \nprotector of the child.  Indeed, at least one parent, distraught after officials pried his 3-year-old \n13 \nson from his arms, is reported to have committed suicide following the separation. See Nick \n14 \n15  Miroff, A family separated at the border, and this distraught father took his own life, (June 9, \n16  2018)  available  at  https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/a-family-was-\n17 \nseparated-at-the-border-and-this-distraught-father-took-his-own-life/2018/06/08/24e40b70-\n18 \n6b5d-11e8-9e38-24e693b38637_story.html?utm_term=.96a4606e47c7, attached hereto as Ex. \n19 \n43. \n20 \n113.  These general observations were confirmed by interviewers who recently spoke \n21 \nwith mothers detained in a federal facility in King County, Washington.

The Policy Is Expressly Intended to Use Traumatized Children and Families to \nDeter Migration of Latina/o Immigrants and for Political Leverage \n2 \n114.  Defendants have changed public positions on the Policy numerous times over the \n3 \n4  last few weeks, but what has remained consistent throughout is Defendants’ unambiguous \n5  adoption of a policy at the Southwestern border that uses trauma as deterrence, and their \n6 \ninsistence that Congress overhaul immigration laws to codify President Trump’s immigration \n7 \nagenda, including building a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. See JM Rieger, The Trump \n8 \nAdministration Changed its Story on Family Separation no Fewer than 14 Times Before Ending \n9 \nthe  Policy  (June  20,  2018)  available  at  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-\n10 \nfix/wp/2018/06/20/the-trump-administration-changed-its-story-on-family-separation-no-fewer-\n11 \n12  than-14-times-before-ending-the-policy/?utm_term=.6719a188344f,  Ex.  44  (collecting \n13  contradictory statements). Confirmation of these two goals is reflected in statements from a year \n14 \nago and continued even after issuance of the Executive Order. \n15 \n115.  As early as March 7, 2017, then-Secretary of DHS John Kelly confirmed that the \n16 \nPolicy was intended to “to deter movement” along the Southwestern border.  See Ex. 3.   Later \n17 \nthat year, a source who attended a DHS meeting to discuss ways to “deter immigrants from \n18 \ncoming to the U.S. illegally” reported that the Policy was still being considered, but kept getting \n19 \n20  “bogged down” because of how “difficult and controversial it was.”  See Ex. 4.  \n21 \n116.  On December 5, 2017, Kirstjen Nielsen replaced John Kelly as DHS Secretary.  \n22 \n117.  On February 8, 2018, 75 members of Congress wrote a letter to DHS Secretary \n23 \nNielsen  expressing  “deep[]  concern  that  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (DHS)  is \n24 \nseparating families, including parents and their minor children . . . along the U.S.-Mexico \n25 \nborder.”   DHS’ “reported justification of this practice as a deterrent to family migration suggests \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  34  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

The letter details two complaints filed in December 2017 that confirmed DHS \n5 \nwas “intentionally separating families for purposes of deterrence and punishment.”  In particular, \n6 \nthe second complaint documented “instances of infants and toddlers as young as one and two \n7 \n8  years old separated from their parents and rendered ‘unaccompanied’”—among these was “a \n9 \nfather separated from his one-year-old son, Mateo, despite presenting appropriate documents to \n10 \nestablish their relationship.” Id. \n11 \n119.  Attorney General Sessions has confirmed that the Policy is intended to deter other \n12 \nfamilies from entering the United States.  For example, on April 6, 2018, he issued a warning to \n13 \nimmigrants crossing the Southwestern border that “illegally entering this country will not be \n14 \n15  rewarded, but instead will be met with the full prosecutorial powers of the Department of Justice” \n16  and children “will be separated from [their parents].”  See Ex. 12.  \n17 \n120.  In May 2018, DHS announced the results of its pilot at the El Paso border sector \n18 \nfrom July to November 2017.  Its report—later found to be inaccurate—further confirms that \n19 \ndeterrence is the primary purpose of the Policy. When asked about the Policy, DHS reported that \n20 \n“[t]he number of illegal crossings between ports of entry of family units dropped by 64 percent. \n21 \nThis decrease was attributed to the prosecution of adults amenable to prosecution for illegal entry \n22 \n23  while risking the lives of their children. Of note, the numbers began rising again after the \n24  initiative was paused.”  See Ex. 6.  Notably, public reporting suggests that, based on DHS’ own \n25 \nstatistics, these numbers are wrong and that there was, in fact, a 64% increase in apprehensions.  \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  35  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

On May 11, 2018, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly was interviewed by \n9 \nNational Public Radio.

They’re not MS-13. . . . They’re not bad people. They’re coming here \n12 \nfor a reason.  And I sympathize with the reason. . . .

On June 5, 2018, Attorney General Sessions was asked whether it was “absolutely \n20 \nnecessary” to “separate parents from children when they are detained or apprehended at the \n21 \nborder.”  He responded, “yes” and “[i]f people don’t want to be separated from their children, \n22 \n23  they should not bring them with them.

On June 14, 2018, Attorney General Sessions quoted a Bible verse ostensibly to \n5 \njustify the Policy to leaders of the faith community and added: “Having children does not give \n6 \nyou immunity from arrest and prosecution.”  See Adam Edelman, Sessions Cites Bible in Defense \n7 \n8  of  Breaking  up  Families,  Blames  Migrant  Parents  (June  14,  2018)  available  at \n9 \nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/sessions-cites-bible-defense-breaking-\n10 \nfamilies-blames-migrant-parents-n883296, attached hereto as Ex. 50.  \n11 \n124.   Public statements suggest that the Trump Administration intends to use the \n12 \nPolicy as a negotiating tool to force congressional acquiescence to its proposed immigration \n13 \nlegislation.  For example, President Trump tweeted on May 26, 2018 that Democrats should “end \n14 \n15  the horrible law that separates children from there [sic] parents once they cross the Border.” The \n16  May  26,  2018  tweet  is  available  at \n17 \nhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1000375761604370434, and attached hereto as Ex. \n18 \n51.  \n19 \n125.  On May 29, 2018 Senior Advisor to the President Stephen Miller confirmed that \n20 \nfamilies are intentionally being traumatized for political gain: “If we were to have those \n21 \n[Republican sponsored] fixes in federal law, the migrant crisis emanating from Central America \n22 \n23  would largely be solved in a very short period of time,” and “[f]amilies would then therefore be \n24  able to be kept together and could be sent home expeditiously and safely.”  See Ted Hesson, \n25 \nWhite House’s Miller Blames Democrats for border crisis, Politico (May 29, 2018) available at \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  37  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

On June 16, 2018, President Trump confirmed that he is using the Policy to push \n4 \nlawmakers to enact immigration legislation more in line with his own agenda: “Democrats can \n5 \nfix their forced family breakup at the Border by working with Republicans on new legislation.”  \n6 \nSee Kate Sullivan, Trump suggests separation of families at border is a negotiating tool (June \n7 \n8  16,  2018)  available  at  https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/16/politics/trump-separation-families-\n9 \nnegotiating-tool/index.html, attached hereto as Ex. 53. \n10 \n127.  On June 18, 2018, President Trump complained that “[w]e have the worst \n11 \nimmigration laws in the entire world.  Nobody has such sad, such bad and actually, in many \n12 \ncases, such horrible and tough – you see about child separation, you see what’s going on there.” \n13 \nSee Ex. 19.   He suggested, “[i]f the Democrats would sit down, instead of obstructing, we could \n14 \n15  have something done very quickly, good for the children, good for the country, good for the \n16  world.   It could take place quickly.”   Id.   But in the meantime, he stated, “The United States \n17 \nwill not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility, it won’t be.”  Id. \n18 \n128.  On June 18, 2018, in remarks before the National Sheriffs’ Association, Attorney \n19 \nGeneral Sessions also suggested that if lawmakers would simply acquiesce to President Trump’s \n20 \ndemands to fund a wall on the Southwestern border, Defendants would stop separating families:  \n21 \n“We do not want to separate parents from their children,” “[i]f we build the wall, if we pass \n22 \n23  legislation to end the lawlessness, we won’t face these terrible choices.”  See Ex. 20.  \n24  129.  DHS Secretary Nielsen also linked the Policy with demands the Administration \n25 \nhas made on Congress:  “We are enforcing the laws passed by Congress, and we are doing all \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  38  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

It is now time that Congress act \n2 \nto fix our broken immigration system.”  See Ex. 21.  \n3 \nH.  Defendants’ Family Separation Policy Targets Immigrant Families Based on Their \n4  National Origin \n5  130.  Defendants’ Policy is directed only at “Southwest Border crossings” (see Ex. 13), \n6 \nthe majority of which consist of immigrants from Latin America.  Indeed, in its reports on recent \n7 \n“Southwest Border Apprehensions,” CBP only tracks family unit apprehensions for immigrants \n8 \nfrom El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico.  See U.S. Border Patrol Southwest Border \n9 \nApprehensions by Sector FY2018, available at https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/usbp-sw-\n10 \nborder-apprehensions, attached hereto as Ex. 54.  Defendants do not track whether the Policy is \n11 \n12  impacting family unit migration from any other countries. \n13  131.  Defendants’ stated rationale for adopting the Policy—i.e., to deter migration—is \n14 \nineffective and not a legitimate law enforcement tactic.  Rather than deter migration, the number \n15 \nof families and unaccompanied children apprehended has steadily increased since Defendants \n16 \nhave implemented the Policy.  According to Defendants’ own statistics, in March 2018, the \n17 \nnumber of families apprehended at the Southwestern border was 37,385; in April 2018, 38,278; \n18 \nand in May 2018, 40,344.  See Ex. 8.  The number of family units arriving at ports of entry \n19 \n20  determined to be inadmissible also stayed relatively stable; in March 2018, the number was \n21 \n5,162, in April, 5,445, and in May 4,718.  Id. \n22 \n132.  Defendants also report that U.S. border agents made more than 50,000 arrests in \n23 \neach of the months of March, April and May 2018—“an indication that escalating enforcement \n24 \ntactics  by  the  Trump  Administration—including  separating  immigrant  parents  from  their \n25 \nchildren—has not had an immediate deterrent effect.”  See Nick Miroff, Border arrests exceed \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  39  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

On May 23, 2018, Steven Wagner, Acting Secretary of the Administration for \n6 \nChildren and Families testified before a Senate committee, stating: “In FY 2017, 84 percent of \n7 \n8  [unaccompanied  alien  minors]  referred  to  ORR  came  from  Honduras,  Guatemala,  and \n9 \nEl Salvador. To date in FY 2018, 93 percent of referred children come from those countries.”  A \n10 \ncopy of the Wagner Statement is attached as Ex. 56. \n11 \n134.  On April 6, 2018, President Trump signed a memorandum ordering agencies to \n12 \n“expeditiously end” the practice of “catch and release,” a pejorative phrase that refers to the \n13 \npractice of allowing immigrants to be released into the community pending resolution of their \n14 \n15  immigration cases.  See Jesse Byrnes, Trump signs memo ordering end to ‘catch and release” \n16  practices,  The  Hill,  available  at  http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/382054-trump-\n17 \nsigns-memo-ordering-end-to-catch-and-release-practices,  attached  hereto  as  Ex.  57.  For \n18 \nexample, the memo orders DHS to submit a report within 45 days “detailing all measures that \n19 \ntheir respective departments have pursued or are pursuing to expeditiously end ‘catch and \n20 \nrelease’ practices.”  Id.  It also requests “a detailed list of all existing facilities, including military \n21 \nfacilities,  that  could  be  used,  modified,  or  repurposed  to  detain  aliens  for  violations  of \n22 \n23  immigration  law”  and  specifically  directs  Attorney  General  Sessions and  DHS  Secretary \n24  Nielsen to identify any resources “that may be needed to expeditiously end ‘catch and release’ \n25 \npractices.”  Id. \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  40  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

The Policy—announced shortly thereafter—targets only the immigrants at the \n2 \nSouthwestern border, the vast majority of whom are from Latin American countries.  See Ex. 12.  \n3 \n136.  In stark contrast to Defendants’ Southwestern border actions, DHS’ updated \n4 \nNorthern Border Strategy, announced on June 12, 2018, aims “to facilitate the flow of lawful \n5 \ncross-border trade and travel, and strengthen cross-border community resilience.”  Although the \n6 \nNorthern Border Strategy is intended, in part, to “safeguard our northern border against terrorist \n7 \n8  and criminal threats,” the strategy does not demand prosecution and family separation for all \n9 \nunauthorized entrants at the northern border of the United States.  See Department of Homeland \n10 \nSecurity  Northern  Border  Strategy  available  at \n11 \nhttps://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/18_0612_PLCY_DHS-Northern-Border-\n12 \nStrategy.pdf, attached hereto as Ex. 58. \n13 \n137.  The Policy is intended to target immigrants by their country of origin and is \n14 \n15  consistent with the demonstrated anti-Latina/o bias repeatedly shown by President Trump. \n16  138.  Members of the Trump Administration repeatedly disparaged Latin American \n17 \ncountries during the presidential campaign and during the Trump presidency.  When Mr. Trump \n18 \nannounced his campaign at Trump Tower in June 2015, he announced: “When Mexico sends its \n19 \npeople, they’re not sending their best. . . . They’re bringing drugs.  They’re bringing crime. \n20 \nThey’re rapists.”  See Z.

During the first Republican presidential debate, then-candidate Trump again \n2 \nstated his distaste for immigrants from Mexico:  “The Mexican government is much smarter, \n3 \nmuch sharper, much more cunning.  And they send the bad ones over because they don’t want \n4 \nto pay for them.  They don’t want to take care of them.”  See Andrew O’Reilly, At GOP debate, \n5 \nTrump says ‘stupid’ U.S. leaders are being duped by Mexico, Fox News (Aug. 6, 2015) available \n6 \nat  http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/06/at-republican-debate-trump-says-mexico-is-\n7 \n8  sending-criminals-because-us.html, attached hereto as Ex. 60. \n9 \n140.  Soon after, on August 25, 2015, then-candidate Trump refused to answer questions \n10 \nabout immigration posed by Jorge Ramos, a Mexican-American and the top news anchor at \n11 \nUnivision, a Spanish-language news network.  After sending his bodyguard to physically remove \n12 \nMr. Ramos, then-candidate Trump derisively told Mr. Ramos to “Go back to Univision.”  See Phillip \n13 \nRucker, First, Trump booted Univision anchor Jorge Ramos out of his news conference.

In August 2017, President Trump pardoned Joe Arpaio, the former Arizona \n12 \nsheriff who oversaw operations that consistently targeted and harassed Latino residents in \n13 \nMaricopa County.  After a thorough investigation, the U.S. Department of Justice issued a report \n14 \n15  in 2011 finding that Mr. Arpaio’s office had committed numerous civil rights violations by, inter \n16  alia, conducting immigration sweeps that routinely violated the Fourth Amendment; detaining \n17 \nLatino residents based on fabricated charges; placing Spanish-speaking inmates in solitary \n18 \nconfinement as punishment for not speaking English; refusing to accept requests for basic \n19 \nservices written in Spanish; pressuring Latino inmates to sign deportation forms; and referring \n20 \nto Latino inmates as “wetback,” “Mexican bitches,” and “stupid Mexicans.”  See Letter/Report, \n21 \nattached hereto as Ex. 71.  The report found that Mr. Arpaio’s own actions “promoted a culture \n22 \n23  of bias in his organization and clearly communicated to his officers that biased policing would \n24  not only be tolerated, but encouraged.”  Id. \n25 \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  45  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

The vast majority of individuals jailed by \n7 \n8  Mr. Arpaio’s office were Latinos detained on suspicion of being undocumented.  Id.

He’s a great American patriot and I hate to see what has happened to him.”  Id. \n11 \n150.  In February 2018, President Trump referred to nations such as El Salvador as \n12 \n“shithole countries” in a meeting with lawmakers, and suggested that the U.S. preferred to \n13 \nreceive immigrants from countries like Norway.

He stated that “Mexico has the absolute power to not let these large ‘Caravans’ \n6 \nof people enter our country.”   See Edgard Garrido, Migrant ‘caravan’ that angers Trump nears \n7 \n8  U.S.-Mexico border, Reuters (April 23, 2018), available at https://www.reuters.com/article/us-\n9 \nusa-immigration-caravan/migrant-caravan-that-angers-trump-nears-u-s-mexico-border-\n10 \nidUSKBN1HU2ZB, attached hereto as Ex. 74.

Numerous professional and religious organizations have also denounced the \n4 \nPolicy.  On June 12, 2018, the American Bar Association (ABA) expressed “strong opposition” \n5 \nto Defendants’ “separation of children from their parents when arriving at the southern border,” \n6 \ncalling the practice “unfair, inhumane, and, in the end, ineffective.”  See ABA letter attached \n7 \n8  hereto as Ex. 79 (noting “that the primary purpose of the ‘zero tolerance’ Policy is to serve as a \n9 \ndeterrent for migrant parents” at the Southwestern border, and “that family separation is not a \n10 \ncollateral consequence of regular law enforcement” but “an explicitly intentional goal.”).  \n11 \n159.  The Policy has also been widely condemned by the medical community. For \n12 \nexample, the American Association of Pediatrics (AAP) recently denounced Defendants’ Policy, \n13 \nwriting:    “Separating  children  from  their  parents  contradicts  everything  we  stand  for  as \n14 \n15  pediatricians – protecting and promoting children’s health. In fact, highly stressful experiences, \n16  like family separation, can cause irreparable harm, disrupting a child’s brain architecture and \n17 \naffecting his or her health.

Defendants’ Policy Harms the States’ Sovereign Interests \n2 \n164.  Defendants’ Policy and subsequent actions harm the States’ sovereign interests \n3 \nby interfering with their licensing authority and rendering the States unable to honor their own \n4 \npolicies favoring family unity. \n5 \n165.  Even for residential facilities that are federally funded, States have sovereign \n6 \nresponsibility for the licensing, inspection, and monitoring of out-of-home care providers (i.e., \n7 \n8  providers who care for children away from their parents). The States conduct periodic licensing \n9 \nmonitoring visits to these facilities, meeting with the staff and children in their care, to ensure \n10 \nthat these facilities meet minimum safety standards, including background check approvals, \n11 \nfacility safety standards, and ensuring the facilities provide necessary and appropriate care to the \n12 \nchildren.  \n13 \n166.  For example, in Washington State, any agency that cares for children on a 24-hour \n14 \n15  basis away from their parents must be licensed.  See, e.g. RCW 74.15.020, 74.15.090. Under \n16  RCW 74.15.030(7) and .080, the state’s department of social and health services has the \n17 \nauthority and duty to access and inspect the facility’s records for the purpose of determining \n18 \nwhether or not there is compliance with state licensing requirements. See also ch. 388-145 WAC \n19 \n(the licensing requirements for group homes and youth shelters). These licensing requirements \n20 \napply to all private facilities, even those operated by a private agency contracting with the federal \n21 \ngovernment. \n22 \n23  167.  In the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, no “agency or institution of the federal \n24  government” may operate a “[foster care] placement agency, group care facility, or temporary \n25 \nshelter facility” for children unless licensed by the Department of Early Education and Care \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  52  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

Laws Ch. 15D, § 1A, 6.  EEC “may, at any reasonable time, visit and inspect \n2 \nany facility” subject to such licensure. Id, § 9.  \n3 \n168.  Likewise, New York State has licensing and oversight responsibilities over the \n4 \nfacilities where immigrant children who are separated from their parents are placed. Specifically, \n5 \nthe Bureau of Child Welfare and Community Services (“CWCS”) of the New York State Office \n6 \nof Children and Family Services (“OCFS”) has regulatory, licensing, inspection and supervisory \n7 \n8  authority over residential programs that care for foster children. N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law §§ 460-b, \n9 \n460-c, 462-a. OCFS issues operating certificates to non-profit agencies in New York State that \n10 \nprovide residential care in a congregate setting to UACs, including the children who have been \n11 \nseparated from their parents at the border. OCFS, as the licensing state agency of child residential \n12 \nprograms in New York, retains the authority to conduct building, equipment, fire and safety \n13 \ninspections of these facilities. Also, OCFS has the statutory authority to establish regulatory \n14 \n15  standards for the certification or approval of foster homes, and the authority of an agency to \n16  certify or approve foster homes. N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law §§ 378, 460-a, N.Y. Not-for-Profit Corp. \n17 \nLaw § 404(b). Provider agencies in New York that contract with ORR place UACs in foster \n18 \nhomes that the agency has approved or certified pursuant to this authority from the state. \n19 \n169.  In the State of North Carolina, “[n]oTo s person shall operate, establish or provide \n20 \nfoster care for children or receive and place children in residential care facilities, family foster \n21 \nhomes, or adoptive homes without first applying for a licensure to the Department” of Health \n22 \n23  and Human Services].

Id. § 131D-10.6(6). \n3 \n170.  Likewise,  Delaware  licenses,  registers,  and  monitors  all  residential  and \n4 \nnonresidential childcare facilities including . . .  child placement and adoption agencies . . .” \n5 \n29 Del. C. § 9003 (7).  Delaware’s monitoring scheme includes the right of entrance, inspection, \n6 \nand access to the papers of childcare facilities operating within Delaware and entities that operate \n7 \n8  within Delaware  and place  children in other states.  31 Del. C. §§ 343, 344.   In  certain \n9 \ncircumstances, a violation of Delaware’s childcare licensing requirements may constitute a \n10 \ncriminal act. 31 Del. C. § 345. \n11 \n171.  Other  States  have  similar  licensing  authority  and  statutory  regimes.  These \n12 \nprovisions are intended to protect children from substandard housing and care, and are essential \n13 \nto the wellbeing of minors placed in facilities located in the States. \n14 \n15  172.  The United States’ Ex Parte Application for relief from the Flores Settlement is \n16  a frontal attack on that sovereign interest.  That request seeks rescission of Flores’s protections \n17 \nand a “determin[ation] that the Agreement’s state licensure requirement does not apply to ICE \n18 \nfamily residential facilities.” The United States has thus sought to extinguish state licensing \n19 \npowers over federally contracted out-of-home care providers, leaving those facilities wholly \n20 \nunregulated at the local level.  The government’s attempt to modify the Flores settlement terms \n21 \nby removing States’ licensing authority and jurisdiction interferes with the States’ sovereign \n22 \n23  powers. \n24  173.  Moreover, each of the States is required to respect family integrity absent a \n25 \nfinding that a parent is unfit or unavailable to care for a child. Here, the federal government has \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  54  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue. Suite 2000 \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00939   Document 1   Filed 06/26/18   Page 55 of 128\n \n1  intentionally separated parents from children and is leaving it to the States’ court systems to \n2 \nestablish alternative guardianships for them, or relying on state-licensed foster care facilities to \n3 \ncare for the children, rendering the States unable to enforce the legal mandates and public \n4 \npolicies that require keeping families together unless the best interests of the child dictate \n5 \notherwise. \n6 \n174.  For example, the State of Washington has a longstanding public policy affirming \n7 \n8  the importance of family integrity and the primacy of the parent-child relationship. Wash. Rev. \n9 \nCode § 13.34.020 “declares that the family unit is a fundamental resource of American life which \n10 \nshould be nurtured” and mandates “that the family unit should remain intact unless a child’s right \n11 \nto conditions of basic nurture, health, or safety is jeopardized.” Wash. Rev. Code § 26.09.002 \n12 \nlikewise “recognizes the fundamental importance of the parent-child relationship to the welfare \n13 \nof the child” and requires “that the relationship between the child and each parent [] be fostered \n14 \n15  unless inconsistent with the child’s best interests.” Similarly, Washington’s child abuse and \n16  neglect law, contained in chapter 26.44 RCW, enshrines the state’s policy that “[t]he bond \n17 \nbetween a child and his or her parent . . . is of paramount importance[.]” RCW 26.44.010. Under \n18 \nWashington law, the state is justified to intervene in that relationship only when a child is \n19 \ndeprived of the right to conditions of minimal nurture, health, and safety.   \n20 \n175.  Washington  also  has  recognized  that  children  in  government  custody  have \n21 \nsubstantive due process rights under the U.S. Constitution. See Braam v State of Washington, \n22 \n23  150 Wn.2d 689, 81 P.3d 851 (2003) (foster children possess substantive due process rights). \n24  While these rights are not coextensive with parental rights in every context, Washington \n25 \nrecognizes a child’s constitutional rights “to be free from unreasonable risk of harm, including a \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  55  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue. Suite 2000 \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00939   Document 1   Filed 06/26/18   Page 56 of 128\n \n1  risk flowing from the lack of basic services, and a right to reasonable safety.” Id. The intentional \n2 \nexposure of a child to an unreasonable risk of harm, including physical or mental injury, violates \n3 \nthese rights. \n4 \n176.  Washington has also declared that practices that discriminate against any of its \n5 \ninhabitants because of race, creed, color, or national origin are matters of public concern that \n6 \nthreaten the rights and proper privileges of the State and harm the public welfare, health, and \n7 \n8  peace of the people.  See Wash. Rev. Code § 49.60.010.  \n9 \n177.  The  Commonwealth  of  Massachusetts  has  long  committed  itself  to  the \n10 \npromotion and safeguarding of the family unit.  Massachusetts law, for example, notes that “the \n11 \nfamily is the best source of child rearing,” 110 C.M.R. 1.02, and holds that “the policy of this \n12 \ncommonwealth [is] to direct its efforts, first, to the strengthening and encouragement of family \n13 \nlife for the care and protection of children.”  Mass. Gen. Laws c. 119, § 1.  Normally, therefore, \n14 \n15  “the interest of the child is best served by a stable, continuous environment with his or her own \n16  family.”  Adoption of Frederick, 405 Mass. 1, 4 (1989).  As a result, the Commonwealth allows \n17 \n“state intervention into a family unit [to] be used only when it is clearly needed to protect a \n18 \nchild.” 110 C.M.R. 1.02. \n19 \n178.  The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has also long protected the civil rights and \n20 \nliberties of its residents, outlawing practices that harm or discriminate individuals based on race, \n21 \ncolor, religious creed, or national origin.  See, e.g., Mass. Gen. Laws c. 151B, § 4; c. 151C, § 2; \n22 \n23  c. 76, § 5; and c. 272, § 98. \n24  179.

Oregon recognizes the intrinsic value of family relationships and prioritizes \n2 \nprotecting them.  For example, Or. Rev. Stat. § 419B.007 states the policy of Oregon is to \n3 \n“preserve family life” by “stabilizing the family.”  In addition, Oregon has declared there is a \n4 \n“strong preference” that children live “with their own families.” Or. Rev. Stat. § 419B.090(5).  \n5 \nSimilarly, custody determinations are based on the best interest of the child, including “[t]he \n6 \nemotional ties between the child and other family members” as well as “[t]he desirability of \n7 \n8  continuing an existing relationship.”  Id.  Oregon thus places great value on the parent-child \n9 \nrelationship, on “interaction, companionship, interplay and mutuality, that fulfilled the child’s \n10 \npsychological needs for a parent” in addition to a child’s physical needs.  Or. Rev. Stat. § 109.119 \n11 \n(10)(a). \n12 \n180.  Oregon further recognizes that children are individuals who have legal rights.  \n13 \nAmong those rights are “freedom from…emotional abuse or exploitation.”  Or. Rev. Stat. § \n14 \n15  419B.090(1).  To that end, Oregon has enacted laws and policies to protect children’s rights.  For \n16  example, “[i]t is the policy of the State of Oregon to safeguard and promote each child’s right to \n17 \nsafety, stability and well-being and to safeguard and promote each child’s relationships with \n18 \nparents, siblings, grandparents, other relatives and adults with whom a child develops healthy \n19 \nemotional attachments.”  Or. Rev. Stat. § 419B.090(3).  \n20 \n181.  Moreover, Oregon acknowledges the importance of due process rights afforded \n21 \nto parents facing “interference” with their right to “direct the upbringing of their children” \n22 \n23  because the policy of Oregon is to “guard the liberty interest of parents protected by the \n24  Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and to protect the rights and interests \n25 \nof children.”  Or.

Or. Rev. Stat. § 419B.205(1).  Pursuant to \n5 \nOr. Rev. Stat. § 419B.165, a child taken into custody must be released to a parent unless a court \n6 \norder prevents it or there is probable cause to believe the child may be endangered by immediate \n7 \n8  release.   \n9 \n182.  When parents and children are separated, Oregon prioritizes a child’s existing \n10 \nrelationships in considering placement alternatives.  For example, “there shall be a preference \n11 \ngiven to placement of the child or ward with relatives and persons who have a caregiver \n12 \nrelationship with the child.”  Or. Rev. Stat. § 419B.192(1).  Oregon law also recognizes the value \n13 \nof sibling relationships and requires state social agencies to make “diligent efforts” to keep \n14 \n15  siblings  together  when  they  have  been  separated  from  their  parents.    Or.  Rev.  Stat.  § \n16  419B.192(2).  \n17 \n183.  Children separated from families in Oregon are entitled to participate in age and \n18 \ndevelopmentally appropriate activities.   Specifically, this includes activities that are reflective \n19 \nof and promote “development of cognitive, emotional, physical and behavioral capacities that \n20 \nare typical for an age or age group.”   Or. Rev. Stat. § 419B.194(a)(A). Moreover, Oregon \n21 \nrequires  appropriate  activities  for  a  specific  child  separated  from  family  “based  on  the \n22 \n23  developmental stages attained by the child.”  Or. Rev. Stat. § 419B.194(a)(B).  In making these \n24  determinations,  the  “reasonable  and  prudent  parent  standard”  applies.    Or.  Rev.  Stat.  § \n25 \n419B.194(b).  The standard is characterized by “careful and sensible parental decisions that \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  58  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

Oregon has also codified anti-discrimination policies that protect all Oregon \n4 \nresidents from disparate treatment based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national \n5 \norigin, marital status or age.  Or. Rev. Stat. § 659A.403(1).  Further, it is unlawful for any person \n6 \nto deny another full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, and privileges of any \n7 \n8  place of public accommodation.  Or. Rev. Stat. § 659A.403(3). \n9 \n185.  The State of California similarly has a long history of preserving the integrity of \n10 \nthe  family  unit  and  the  parent-child  relationship.    For  example,  California  Welfare  and \n11 \nInstitutions Code section 11205 declares “the family unit is of fundamental importance to society \n12 \nin nurturing its members,” and states “[e]ach family has the right and responsibility to provide \n13 \nsufficient support and protection of its children.” California’s policy to “preserve and strengthen \n14 \n15  a child’s family ties whenever possible” and to remove a child from the custody of his or her \n16  parents “only when necessary for his or her welfare or for the safety and protection of the public” \n17 \nis delineated in California Welfare and Institution Code section 201, subdivision (a), and section \n18 \n16000, subdivision (a).    \n19 \n186.  California’s interests in protecting the physical, emotional and psychological \n20 \nhealth of minors and in preserving and fostering the parent-child relationship “are extremely \n21 \nimportant interests that rise to the level of ‘compelling interests’ for purposes of constitutional \n22 \n23  analysis.”  American Academy of Pediatrics v. Lungren, 16 Cal. 4th 307, 348 (1997).  \n24 \n25 \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  59  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

It is California policy that social services programs must prevent or reduce \n2 \ninappropriate institutional care by providing community-based care, home-based care, or other \n3 \nforms of less intensive care. Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 13003(4).  \n4 \n188.  In California, per statute, any out-of-home placement of children must be in the \n5 \n“least restrictive family setting,” and should promote “normal childhood experiences that [are] \n6 \nsuited to meet the child's or youth's individual needs.”  Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 16000(a). \n7 \n8  189.  California  also  has  robust  constitutional  and  statutory  protections  against \n9 \ndiscrimination.  For example, the California Constitution protects against discrimination on the \n10 \nbasis of race, creed, color or national or ethnic origin. Cal. Const. art. I, § 8.  California law also \n11 \nprotects against discrimination on the basis of ancestry, citizenship, primary language, and \n12 \nimmigration status.  Cal. Civ. Code § 51.  California is also committed to developing strategic \n13 \npolices and plans regarding health issues affecting immigrants and refugees. Cal. Health & Saf. \n14 \n15  Code § 131019.5. \n16  190.  The State of New Mexico’s laws embody a public policy dedicated to the \n17 \npreservation of the family unit.  NMSA 1978, Sec. 32A-1-3 (2009).  To “the maximum extent \n18 \npossible, children in New Mexico shall be reared as members of a family unit.”  Id.  See also \n19 \nNMSA 1978, Section 40-15-3 (2005) (“It is the policy of the state that its laws and programs \n20 \nshall: support intact, functional families and promote each family's ability and responsibility to \n21 \nraise its children; strengthen families in crisis and at risk of losing their children, so that children \n22 \n23  can remain safely in their own homes when their homes are safe environments and in their \n24  communities…help halt the breakup of the nuclear family[.]”).  Further, New Mexico’s Family \n25 \nPreservation Act clearly indicates the purpose of the Act is to “confirm the state’s policy of \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  60  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

New \n4 \nMexico case law affirms there is a clearly established right to familial integrity embodied in the \n5 \nFourteenth Amendment. Oldfield v. Benavidez, 1994-NMSC-006, ¶ 14, 116 N.M. 785. \n6 \n191.  The New Mexico Children’s Code also ensures that New Mexican parents have \n7 \n8  substantial due process protections prior to losing the right to care of and custody of their own \n9 \nchildren.  See NMSA 1978, Section 32A-4-28. The sole fact that a parent is incarcerated is not \n10 \na basis for terminating parental rights.  Id.  A parent's fundamental liberty interest in the care, \n11 \ncustody, and management of their children is well established.  See State ex rel. Children, Youth \n12 \n& Families Dep't v. Mafin M., 2003–NMSC–015, ¶ 18, 133 N.M. 827, 70 P.3d 1266; State ex \n13 \nrel. Children, Youth & Families Dep't v.

New Mexico custody determinations are also driven by the best interests of the \n2 \nchild.  See Schuermann v. Schuermann, 1980-NMSC-027, ¶ 6, 94 N.M. 81 (“In any proceeding \n3 \ninvolving custody, the courts' primary concern and consideration must be for the child's best \n4 \ninterests.”) (citing NMSA 1978, Section 40-4-9(A) (1977)). “In any case in which a judgment \n5 \nor decree will be entered awarding the custody of a minor, the district court shall, if the minor is \n6 \nunder the age of fourteen, determine custody in accordance with the best interests of the child.” \n7 \n8  Id. \n9 \n193.  The laws of the State of New Mexico dictate that the best interests of a child, if \n10 \nnot properly within the custody of their parents, then lies in the custody of other family members. \n11 \nThis policy is not only rooted in the best interests of children generally, but is designed to protect \n12 \nboth family unity as well as unique cultural heritage. Under the State’s Kinship Guardianship \n13 \nAct, family members have a protected interest in raising a child when neither parent is available.  \n14 \n15  NMSA 1978, Section 40-10B-2 (2001).  Where the United States’ policy of family separation \n16  does not provide a meaningful opportunity for children who are separated from their parents to \n17 \nunite with other members of their family, it is direct contravention of the laws of this state and \n18 \nthe policy principles that underlying those laws. Further, because “a kinship guardian possesses \n19 \nthe same legal rights and responsibilities of a biological parent,” members of separated children’s \n20 \nfamilies should be afforded the opportunity to seek custody of their relatives.  State ex rel. \n21 \nChildren, Youth & Families Dep’t v. Djamila B., 2015-NMSC-003. To reiterate, any policy or \n22 \n23  practice of the federal government that would serve to deny or otherwise disrupt any family \n24  member’s ability to take custody of their child relative is an affront to the laws of a sovereign \n25 \nstate and the views of the people therein. \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  62  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

New Mexico’s Children’s Code is structured to promote child safety, recognize \n2 \ncultural diversity, and to ensure that civil and criminal justice systems are coordinated.  NMSA \n3 \n1978, Section 32A-1-3 (2009). All children are to be provided services sensitive to their cultural \n4 \nneeds.  Id.;  see also NMSA 1978, Section 32A-18-1 (2009) (requiring cross-cultural training \n5 \nfor all caregivers and service-providers under the children’s code). Families seeking asylum do \n6 \nnot face allegations of abuse, neglect, or a crime that allows children to be removed from the \n7 \n8  custody of their parents under New Mexico law. In New Mexico, the mental and physical \n9 \nwellbeing of children is paramount. NMSA 1978, Section 32A-1-3(A)(2009). Children removed \n10 \nfrom the home in New Mexico because of a parent’s criminal behavior are afforded due process \n11 \nand representation of counsel in every proceeding other than probation.  State v. Doe, 1977-\n12 \nNMCA-234, 91 N.M. 232, 572 P.2d 960,cert. denied 91 N.M. 249, 572 P.2d 1257 (1978). See \n13 \nalso NMSA 1978, § 32A–1–7.  State ex rel. Children, Youth & Families Dept. v.

The State of  New Jersey has a longstanding  public policy confirming the \n19 \nimportance of family integrity and the primacy of the parent-child relationship. New Jersey law \n20 \ndeclares that “the preservation and strengthening of family life is a matter of public concern as \n21 \nbeing in the interest of the general welfare.” N.J. Stat. Ann. § 30:4C-1(a).  It also includes a \n22 \n23  mandate “to make reasonable efforts … to preserve the family in order to prevent the need for \n24  removing the child” from his or her parents, and to return the child safely to his or her parents if \n25 \npossible.  N.J. Stat. Ann. § 30:4C-11.1.  In determining whether removal of a child is required, \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  63  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

Stat. Ann. \n2 \n§ 30:4C-11.2.  Moreover, any proceeding which may result in even a temporary loss of custody \n3 \nof  a  child  implicates  a  parent’s  state  constitutional  right  to  appointed  counsel.    In  re \n4 \nGuardianship of Dotson, 72 N.J. 112, 123 (1976). \n5 \n196.  New Jersey has also long protected the civil rights and civil liberties of its \n6 \nresidents, including by prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed, color, or national \n7 \n8  origin.  See, e.g., N.J. Stat. Ann. § 10:5-12.  \n9 \n197.  The State of Rhode Island has a longstanding public policy affirming the \n10 \nimportance of family integrity and the primacy of the parent-child relationship. For example, \n11 \nR.I. Gen. Law § 42-72-2 (1979) declares that “the state has a basic obligation to promote, \n12 \nsafeguard and protect the social well-being and development of the children of the state through \n13 \na comprehensive program providing for” such items as “the strengthening of the family unit” \n14 \n15  and “making the home safe for children by enhancing the parental capacity for good child care \n16  and services to children and their families to prevent the unnecessary removal of children from \n17 \ntheir homes”. See R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-72-2 (1979). \n18 \n198.  Rhode Island has declared that practices that discriminate against any of its \n19 \npersons within the state on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, disability, age, or country of \n20 \nancestral origin are matters of public concern that threaten the rights and proper privileges of the \n21 \nState and harm the public welfare, health, and peace of the people.

That duty includes bearing “such expenses for the \n3 \nproper care, maintenance, and education of a child, including the expenses of medical, surgical, \n4 \nor psychiatric examination or treatment” as deemed necessary in connection with juvenile care \n5 \nproceedings.  33 V.S.A. § 5116(a).  Vermont authorities owe a corollary duty “to preserve the \n6 \nfamily and to separate a child from his or her parents only when necessary to protect the child \n7 \n8  from serious harm or in the interests of public safety.”  33 V.S.A. § 5101(a)(3).    \n9 \n200.  Where children require foster care, Vermont strives to ensure their placement in \n10 \na healthy, loving environment through strict licensing requirements. See 33 V.S.A. § 4905; Vt. \n11 \nAdmin. Code § 12-3-501. The Vermont Department of Children and Families closely regulates \n12 \nnot only the child’s physical environment but also the individuals who may be entrusted to care \n13 \nfor the child. See Vt. Admin. Code §§ 12-3-501:20; 12-3-501:40.  \n14 \n15  201.  Vermont has long protected its residents from discrimination on the basis of race, \n16  color, and national origin — irrespective of their citizenship status.  See, e.g., 9 V.S.A. §§ 4502-\n17 \n4503 (public accommodations and housing); 21 V.S.A § 495 (employment); and 13 V.S.A. § \n18 \n1455  (bias-motivated  crimes).    Vermont  continues  to  reaffirm  this  commitment  through \n19 \nlegislation.  See, e.g., Vermont Act. 5 (S. 79) (March 28, 2017) (“In Vermont, we celebrate the \n20 \nrich cultural heritage and diversity of our residents. . . .  All Vermont residents should be free \n21 \nfrom discrimination on the basis of their sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, \n22 \n23  race, color, religion, national origin, immigration status, age, or disability.”). \n24  202.  The State of Minnesota’s public policy also affirms the importance of family \n25 \nintegrity.  For example, Minnesota Statutes section 252.32 declares that it is the State’s policy \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  65  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

Stat. § 252.32, subd. 1.  In addition, Minnesota Statutes section \n4 \n260C.001 recognizes the importance of “preserv[ing] and strengthen[ing] the child’s family ties \n5 \nwhenever possible and in the child’s best interests . . . .”  Minn. Stat. § 260C.001, subd. 1(b)(3). \n6 \n203.  Minnesota has also declared that the State’s public policy is that persons be free \n7 \n8  from discrimination in employment, housing and real property, public accommodations, public \n9 \nservices, and education on the basis of, among other things, race, color, creed, or national origin.  \n10 \nMinn. Stat. § 363A.02, subd. 1(a).  “Such discrimination threatens the rights and privileges of \n11 \nthe inhabitants of this state and menaces the institutions and foundations of democracy.”  Id. \n12 \nsubd. 1(b).   \n13 \n204.  The State of Iowa has a longstanding policy that favors the protection of the \n14 \n15  family unit.  The State of Iowa only separates parents and children in the most exceptional of \n16  circumstances because when we do so we “inflict[] a unique deprivation of a constitutionally \n17 \nprotected liberty interest[.]”In re M.S., 889 N.W.2d 675, 677-78 (Iowa Ct. App. 2016).  “An \n18 \ninnocent man can be set free.  The landowner can be justly compensated.  The childless parent \n19 \nhas no recourse.” Id.  To that end, Iowa’s child welfare system strives to ensure that every child \n20 \nreceives the care, guidance, and control she needs in her own home, with her own parents, \n21 \nwhenever possible.  Iowa Code § 232.1.  “[T]he custody, care, and nurture of the child reside \n22 \n23  first in the parents” and it is presumed to be in a child’s best interest to remain in parental custody. \n24  In re M.S., 889 N.W.2d 675, 677-78 (Iowa Ct.

Id. \n5 \n205.  The State of Iowa prohibits discrimination based on race, creed, color, national \n6 \norigin, or religion.  See Iowa Code chapter 216. \n7 \n8  206.  The State of Illinois has a longstanding policy recognizing the importance of \n9 \nmaintaining the family relationship. \n10 \n207.  The Illinois Juvenile Court Act of 1987, for example, declares that the State \n11 \nshould “secure for each minor subject hereto such care and guidance, preferably in his or her \n12 \nown home, as will serve the safety and moral, emotional, mental, and physical welfare of the \n13 \nminor and the best interests of the community; [and] preserve and strengthen the minor’s family \n14 \n15  ties whenever possible, removing him or her from the custody of his or her parents only when \n16  his or her safety or welfare or the protection of the public cannot be adequately safeguarded \n17 \nwithout removal.” 705 ILCS 405/1-2. \n18 \n208.  The Illinois Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act likewise instructs the \n19 \nDepartment of Children and Family Services to “protect the health, safety, and best interests of \n20 \nthe child in all situations in which the child is vulnerable to child abuse or neglect, offer \n21 \nprotective services in order to prevent any further harm to the child and to other children in the \n22 \n23  same environment or family, stabilize the home environment, and preserve family life whenever \n24  possible.” 325 ILCS 5/2(a). \n25 \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  67  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

In  addition,  the  State  of  Illinois  has  a  longstanding  policy  affirming  the \n2 \nimportance of assisting the state’s immigrant population.  \n3 \n210.  The Illinois Attorney General Act declares that “[i]t is imperative that State \n4 \ngovernment is aware of the needs of the State’s immigrant community and sensitive to the \n5 \nbarriers that may prevent them from seeking and obtaining services.” 15 ILCS 205/6.6(a). The \n6 \nAct further directs the Office of the Illinois Attorney General to “assist immigrants by increasing \n7 \n8  accessibility to the Office and providing outreach services to the community, which will serve \n9 \nto educate immigrants as to their rights and responsibilities as residents of the State.”  Id. \n10 \n211.  New York State has a strong interest in family unity. It is the long-established \n11 \npolicy and practice of the State to prioritize keeping a child with his or her parent or parents. \n12 \nOCFS operates under the principal that families staying together is the most desired outcome for \n13 \nchildren. Children are some of the most vulnerable residents in New York State and they best \n14 \n15  develop their unique potential in a caring and healthy family environment with their birth parents \n16  or other relatives. The State’s first obligation is to help the family with services to prevent its \n17 \nbreak-up, or to quickly reunite the family if the child has already been separated from his parents. \n18 \nThat is because the child’s need for a normal family life will usually best be met with his or her \n19 \nbirth parent, and parents are entitled to bring up their own children unless the best interests of \n20 \nthe child would thereby be endangered. N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law § 384-b(1); N.Y. Exec. Law § 990.   \n21 \n212.  New York State has a strong interest in promulgating and operating under non-\n22 \n23  discriminatory policies. In fact, the legislature has declared that non-discrimination is a guiding \n24  principal of policy in New York State. New York’s legislature has found that “the state has the \n25 \nresponsibility to act to assure that every individual within this state is afforded an equal \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  68  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

Exec. \n6 \nLaw § 290. Thus, it is unlawful to discriminate against any person in New York State on the \n7 \n8  basis of age, race, creed, color, national origin, sexual orientation, military status, sex, disability, \n9 \npredisposing genetic characteristics, familial status, marital status, domestic violence victim \n10 \nstatus, gender identity, transgender status, and gender dysphoria.

For \n13 \nexample, OCFS promulgates regulatory standards that expressly prohibit discrimination or \n14 \n15  harassment of adults or children involved in child welfare programs and services based on race, \n16  creed, color, national origin, age, sex, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, \n17 \nmarital status or disability.

The State of Maryland has longstanding policies affirming the importance of \n19 \nfamily  integrity  and  of  protecting  the  wellbeing  of  children  to  the  greatest  extent \n20 \npossible.  Maryland’s Legislature has declared that “it is the policy of this State to promote \n21 \nfamily  stability,  [and]  to  preserve  family  unity[.]”   Md.  Code  Ann.,  Fam.

Code Ann., Health-Gen. § 7-\n4 \n702(b); Code of Md. Regs. 07.02.01.01; Code of Md. Regs. 11.02.13.01.  \n5 \n215.  Maryland also has a public policy prohibiting discrimination against any of its \n6 \ninhabitants because of their race, age, color, creed, or national origin, and has enacted anti-\n7 \n8  discrimination laws in a wide array of contexts, ranging from public accommodations, see Md. \n9 \nCode Ann., State Gov’t §§ 20-304, to employment, id. § 20-602, to residential housing, id. § 20-\n10 \n702.  Maryland law also prohibits any person from retaliating against any person because he or \n11 \nshe has exercised or enjoyed the rights granted or protected by Maryland’s anti-discrimination \n12 \nlaws, id. § 20-708(2).  \n13 \n216.  It is the policy of the State of Maryland, “in the exercise of its police power for \n14 \n15  the protection of the public safety, public health, and general welfare, for the maintenance of \n16  business and good government, and for the promotion of the State’s trade, commerce, and \n17 \nmanufacturers,” to “assure all people equal opportunity in receiving employment” regardless of \n18 \nrace, color, religion, age, ancestry, or national origin.  Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 20-602.    \n19 \n217.  The  Commonwealth  of  Pennsylvania  has  a  longstanding  public  policy \n20 \nrecognizing the significance of family integrity and the parent-child relationship.  For example, \n21 \nPennsylvania law declares that “[t]he family is the basic institution in society in which our \n22 \n23  children’s sense of self-esteem and positive self-image are developed and nurtured” and that \n24  “[t]hese feelings and values are essential to a healthy, productive and independent life during \n25 \nadulthood.”  62 P.S. § 2172(a)(1). Similarly, Pennsylvania’s Domestic Relations Act states that \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  70  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue. Suite 2000 \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00939   Document 1   Filed 06/26/18   Page 71 of 128\n \n1  “[t]he family is the basic unit in society and the protection and preservation of the family is of \n2 \nparamount public concern.”  23 Pa.C.S. § 3102(a). \n3 \n218.  Pennsylvania law further recognizes that children who are separated from their \n4 \nparents are deprived “of the unique bond which exists in the parent-child relationship, leaving \n5 \nemotional scars on such children which may never fully heal” because “children are better off \n6 \nemotionally when their needs can be met by their biological parents.” 62 P.S. § 2172(a). This \n7 \n8  reality is recognized throughout Pennsylvania law. For instance, the Commonwealth’s Juvenile \n9 \nAct seeks to “preserve the unity of the family whenever possible” and to separate “the child \n10 \nfrom parents only when necessary for his welfare, safety or health or in the interests of public \n11 \nsafety.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 6301(b). \n12 \n219.  To separate a child from her family is among the most intrusive acts that the \n13 \ngovernment can initiate.  North Carolina has long committed itself to separating families only as \n14 \n15  a last resort, and only after exhausting other options, and taking all appropriate measures to \n16  ensure the safety of children.  In North Carolina, protection of the family unit is guaranteed not \n17 \nonly by the U.S. Constitution but also by North Carolina law.  Adams v. Tessner, 354 N.C. 57, \n18 \n60 (N.C. 2001).  As a result, taking a child away from its parent requires “a showing that the \n19 \nparent is unfit to have custody.”  Id. at 62. \n20 \n220.  Parents  of  children  in  North  Carolina  have  due  process  rights  that  require \n21 \n“reasonable efforts [to be] made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child” from \n22 \n23  her parents, but only to allow removal when “necessary to protect the safety and health of the \n24  child.”  In re Dula, 143 N.C.

The people of North Carolina, in their Declaration of Rights, have stated that \n4 \n“[n]o person . . . shall be subjected to discrimination by the State because of race, color, religion, \n5 \nor national origin.”  N.C. Const. Art. I, § 19.  The State of North Carolina reiterates this \n6 \ncommitment in numerous statutes that make it unlawful to discriminate on the basis of, inter \n7 \n8  alia, race, color, religion, or national origin.  See, e.g., N.C. Gen. Stat. §§ 75B-2, 41A-4, 95-151, \n9 \n126-16, 143-422.2.   \n10 \n222.    In the State of Delaware, “parents have the primary responsibility for meeting \n11 \nthe  needs  of  their  children  and  the  State  has  an  obligation  to  help  them  discharge  this \n12 \nresponsibility   . . .”  29 Del. C. § 9001.  Delaware law explicitly declares that “the State has a \n13 \nbasic obligation to promote family stability and preserve the family as a unit….”  Id.  Delaware \n14 \n15  law also recognizes that preservation of the family as a unit is “fundamental to the maintenance \n16  of a stable, democratic society.”  10 Del. C. § 902(a).  To that end, the state has directed its \n17 \ncourts, when possible consistent with the safety of family members, to ensure that homes \n18 \n“remain unbroken.”  Id.  The express statutory child welfare policy of the State is to “serve to \n19 \nadvance the interests and secure the safety of the child, while preserving the family unit \n20 \nwhenever the safety of the child is not jeopardized.”  16 Del. C. § 901.   \n21 \n223.  The State of Delaware has comprehensively prohibited discrimination based on \n22 \n23  race and national origin in its laws, including the areas of public accommodations (6 Del.

Upon information and belief, \n3 \nthis entity has assisted in placing children forcibly separated from their parents in other co-\n4 \nplaintiff States.    Should separated children ultimately be placed within Delaware, its education \n5 \nand child welfare systems may be saddled with unanticipated fiscal and operational burdens due \n6 \nto  the  need  to  provide  care  for  children  who  have  been  psychologically  traumatized  by \n7 \n8  involuntary separation from their parents.  In order to ensure a complete injunction, to eliminate \n9 \nthe chilling effect on the exercise of the fundamental rights of documented and undocumented \n10 \nimmigrants presently residing in the State of Delaware, to protect the sovereignty of the State of \n11 \nDelaware by protecting its obligation to assist parents in meeting the needs of children, and to \n12 \nmaintain the appropriate licensure and supervision of childcare facilities within the State, \n13 \nDelaware joins this action. \n14 \n15  224.  The District of Columbia is uniquely situated among the Plaintiff States, as it \n16  has no sovereign interest to claim as against the Federal Government.  See Const. art. I, § 8, cl. \n17 \n17; N.

Defendants’ Policy Harms the States’ Proprietary Interests \n2 \n225.  The Policy also harms the States’ proprietary interests.  ORR places thousands of \n3 \nunaccompanied minors with sponsors (adults who can care for the child during the pendency of \n4 \nimmigration proceedings) in the States every year.  In FY 2016, ORR placed 52,147 individual \n5 \nchildren in such placements nationwide.  In FY 2017, there were 42,497 placements, and so far \n6 \nthere have been almost 20,000 in FY 2018 (October-April). See Unaccompanied Alien Children \n7 \n8  Released  to  Sponsors  by  State  (June  30,  2017)  available  at \n9 \nhttps://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/resource/unaccompanied-alien-children-released-to-sponsors-by-\n10 \nstate, attached hereto as Ex 88.  These ORR data are inclusive of children who were separated \n11 \nas a result of the Policy. \n12 \n226.  The States are receiving and will continue to receive an increasing number of \n13 \nseparated immigrant parents and children if Defendants are allowed to continue implementing \n14 \n15  their Policy.  The federal government’s separation of these families and transfer of separated \n16  persons into the States places increased burdens on state resources, particularly because of the \n17 \nacute trauma that children and parents have experienced due to Defendants’ unlawful policy.  \n18 \nChildren who have been separated from their parents and are awaiting immigration proceedings \n19 \n(for example the adjudication of an asylum application or adjustment of status) are entitled to \n20 \naccess a variety of state-funded programs.  Providing the necessary services to address the legal, \n21 \neducational, physical, and psychological needs of parents and children who have been separated \n22 \n23  will burden the state systems.

Many of the sponsors of these children will need to obtain guardianship \n2 \nthrough the States’ juvenile and family courts.  This is not discretionary:  ORR’s agreement with \n3 \nsponsors requires “best efforts” to establish such guardianships, and sponsors in many states \n4 \nwould be unable to access medical and educational records and make important decisions for the \n5 \nchildren in their care without such court-ordered guardianships. See Sponsor Care Agreement \n6 \navailable  at \n7 \n8  https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/orr/frp_4_sponsor_care_agreement_05_14_18.pdf, \n9 \nand attached hereto as Ex. 89.   \n10 \n228.  Children who have been separated from their parents will also access the State \n11 \ncourts to obtain orders necessary for their immigration proceedings.  For example, some such \n12 \nchildren are eligible for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS), pursuant to federal law.  See \n13 \nImmigration and Nationality Act (INA) §203(b)(4); INA §101(a)(27)(j); Trafficking Victims \n14 \n15  Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA), P.L. 110-457 §235.  In these proceedings, the \n16  federal immigration system relies on the expertise of state courts in making determinations \n17 \nregarding a child’s welfare, requiring SIJS-eligible children to seek SIJS predicate findings from \n18 \na state’s juvenile court. \n19 \n229.  Education.  Public elementary and secondary schools have a constitutional \n20 \nobligation to educate students irrespective of immigration status. See Plyler v.

Such programs are \n2 \nfunded in large part through local levy funds and state dollars.  Indeed, state funding for general \n3 \neducation delivered in public schools is calculated in part on a per-student basis.  \n4 \n230.  The trauma of forcible separation from a parent renders public schooling more \n5 \ndifficult and expensive for the States to provide.  Research shows that the experience of trauma \n6 \nmay severely undercut a child’s ability to learn and function in the classroom. See Helping \n7 \n8  Traumatized  Children  Learn,  available  at  https://traumasensitiveschools.org/wp-\n9 \ncontent/uploads/2013/06/Helping-Traumatized-Children-Learn.pdf, attached hereto as Ex. 90. \n10 \nChildren may require additional mental health services through school guidance counselors and \n11 \nsocial workers; they may have behavioral problems and trauma-related learning disabilities that \n12 \nwould need to be addressed; and they lack the critically important educational advocacy and \n13 \npartnership that parents can provide. Students without parents to care for them are also more \n14 \n15  likely to arrive at school with housing and food insecurity and require additional attention and \n16  resources to address hunger, exhaustion, and increased levels of stress and anxiety.  \n17 \n231.  Healthcare.  Such children are also often eligible for State-funded healthcare \n18 \nprograms, including mental health care treatment.  Health care costs will be exacerbated for the \n19 \nstates because of the Policy, as children who suffer prolonged and unexpected separation from \n20 \ntheir parents experience particular health effects, including higher levels of anxiety, more \n21 \nsusceptibility  to  physical  and  emotional  illness,  and  decreased  capacity  to  manage  their \n22 \n23  emotions. These health effects may result in higher levels of care and increase costs to the state. \n24  See Burke and Mendoa, At Least 3 tender age shelters set up for child migrants, the AP (June \n25 \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  76  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

Other  programs.    Many  States  also  have  programs  that  provide  services \n4 \nspecifically directed at helping immigrants and refugees, as well as programs designed to address \n5 \nthe consequences of trauma.  Some have limited available group care facilities that they stand to \n6 \nlose to ORR placements because of the increase in separated families. \n7 \n8  233.  The plaintiff States are already experiencing some of these proprietary harms. \n9 \n234.  Washington.  For example, ORR places hundreds of unaccompanied minors with \n10 \nsponsors in the state of Washington every year.  For FY 2017, the last year for which complete \n11 \ndata are available, ORR placed almost 500 children with Washington resident sponsors.  As of \n12 \nApril  30,  2018,  ORR’s  available  data  show  that  Washington  has  already  received  278 \n13 \nunaccompanied  children  during  this  fiscal  year.

Washington State children residing in households with an income less than 312 \n2 \npercent of the federal poverty level are eligible for the Apple Health program, regardless of \n3 \ncitizenship and/or documented status.  Qualifying children receive access to the full scope of \n4 \nhealth  care  coverage  including  medical,  dental,  behavioral  health,  vison,  hearing  and \n5 \npharmaceutical benefits.  Of the $7.3 billion that Washington state spent in state fiscal year 2017 \n6 \nto support the entire Apple Health program, the cost to cover minor children was $1.6 billion. In \n7 \n8  state fiscal year 2017, the cost to cover undocumented immigrant children was $31 million.  The \n9 \naverage cost per undocumented child in state fiscal year 2017 was $1,552 per year. \n10 \n237.  Washington’s Office of Refugee and Immigrant Assistance (ORIA) is part of the \n11 \nState of Washington, Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS). ORIA coordinates and \n12 \nfacilitates the provision of services for people who are refugees and immigrants to enable them to \n13 \nachieve economic stability and integrate into Washington communities. To do this, ORIA braids \n14 \n15  federal funding from the ORR with other federal and state dollars, for a total annual budget of \n16  $27,925,874. This funding provides services to more than 10,000 refugees and immigrants each \n17 \nyear through contracts with more than 60 different organizations across the state to offer 11 distinct \n18 \nprograms and services. National immigration policies affect the state’s access to federal funding. \n19 \nFor example, around August of 2014, the nation experienced an influx of unaccompanied \n20 \nimmigrant  children  being  apprehended  by  immigration  officials,  and  ORR  reduced \n21 \nWashington’s federal funding to provide refugee social services to cover an increase in costs at \n22 \n23  the national level.  \n24  238.

Many if not all children separated from their parents under \n3 \nthe Policy may suffer from such disturbances. \n4 \n244.  Oregon.  Defendants’ Policy also harms Oregon’s proprietary interests, because \n5 \nit forces Oregon to expend resources and incur costs that would otherwise not be required.  For \n6 \nexample, unaccompanied minors detained in Oregon have often suffered severe trauma in their \n7 \n8  home countries.  Children separated from their parents under this Policy have suffered additional \n9 \ntrauma from Defendants’ actions.  Counsel for these minors can and do file petitions with the \n10 \njuvenile court departments of the Oregon Circuit Courts on their behalf to obtain Special \n11 \nImmigrant Juvenile status.  This allows the court to transfer custody to the Oregon Department \n12 \nof Human Services, where they can be placed in foster care and receive other necessary services, \n13 \nsuch as healthcare, education, and other support. This process employs the financial and other \n14 \n15  resources of the state of Oregon. \n16  245.  Children in Oregon, including those separated from parents, are entitled to a \n17 \npublic education.  The cost of that education as of 2016-17 was $11,715 per student, with 92% \n18 \nfrom state and local resources. \n19 \n246.  Children in Oregon, including those separated from parents, may be eligible for \n20 \nhealth care funded in part by the state of Oregon.  Children separated from parents who may \n21 \nbecome wards of the state due to forced separation would become eligible for state-funded \n22 \n23  healthcare at a cost of approximately $664 per-member per-month.

ORR places more unaccompanied minors with resident sponsors in \n5 \nCalifornia than any other State in the country.  For FY 2017, ORR placed 6,268 children with \n6 \nCalifornia resident sponsors.  As of April 30, 2018, California has already received 2,807 \n7 \n8  unaccompanied children during this fiscal year.  See Ex. 88.  \n9 \n248.  In California, any child, including children who have been separated from their \n10 \nparents, is entitled to a free public education.  Per pupil expenditures in 2017-18 exceeded \n11 \n$14,000 per child from all fund sources. Of this total, over 91% came from state and local \n12 \nresources.    California  has  also  dedicated  educational  funds  to  meeting  the  needs  of \n13 \nunaccompanied immigrant children. \n14 \n15  249.  In  California,  undocumented  children  receive  healthcare  coverage  paid  for \n16  entirely by the State.  See Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 14007.8.  These children are also eligible \n17 \nfor and benefit from other state funded public health programs.   \n18 \n250.  Children  separated  from  their  parents  because  of  the  Policy  may  require \n19 \ndeterminations by California courts in order to obtain a guardianship or a predicate order \n20 \nenabling the child to apply for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status.

In its role, CCL has three main functions: prevention, compliance, and \n7 \n8  enforcement.  \n9 \n252.  California’s Refugee Programs Bureau is part of the Immigration and Refugee \n10 \nPrograms Branch of the California Department of Social Services (CDSS).  This Bureau \n11 \nprovides  assistance  to  newly  arrived  refugees  to  support  long  term  social  and  economic \n12 \nintegration.  In FY 2017, at least 12,058 refugees arrived in the state of California, and received \n13 \nassistance from the State in the form of nutrition aid, cash assistance, employment services, \n14 \n15  immigration legal services, medical services, and educational support.  The Bureau administers \n16  the Unaccompanied Refugee Minors (URM) Program, the Refugee School Impact Grant (RSIG), \n17 \nand the California Newcomer Education and Well-Being (CalNEW), three programs exclusively \n18 \nfor minors.  The URM provides foster care, case management, mental health, and medical \n19 \nservices to certain unaccompanied minors.  Through RSIG and CalNEW, the RPB funds \n20 \nprograms  in  schools  to  provide  supplementary  educational  and  social  adjustment  support \n21 \nservices including academic, English-language acquisition, and mental and well-being supports.  \n22 \n23  The CalNEW is funded exclusively by the State.

California’s Immigration Services Unit is also a part of the Immigration and \n2 \nRefugee Programs Branch of the CDSS.  The California Legislature has authorized this program \n3 \nto provide assistance to “persons residing in, or formerly residing in, California,\" including \n4 \n“[s]ervices to obtain . . . immigration remedies.\" Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 13303(b)(1)(B).  The \n5 \nprogram  awards  funding  to  California-based  legal  services  organizations  to  assist  in  the \n6 \nrepresentation  of  undocumented  immigrants  in  their  immigration  proceedings,  including \n7 \n8  targeted funding for unaccompanied undocumented minors present in California after release \n9 \nfrom the care and custody of ORR pursuant to Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 13300.  The State has \n10 \ninvested $12,000,000 in services for unaccompanied minors since State FY 2014-2015.  Legal \n11 \nservices providers have provided representation to 2,147 minors.    \n12 \n254.  New Jersey.

The program includes mental health services, which may face increased \n14 \n15  demand in cases of family separation.   \n16  258.  Since 2014, ORR has placed four unaccompanied minors in Vermont.  See Ex. \n17 \n88.  However, the Policy has seen increasingly large numbers of children scattered across the \n18 \nnation, often in conditions of secrecy.  See Exs. 23 & 25.  \n19 \n259.  Vermont’s responsibility to protect the welfare of all children living in the State \n20 \nincludes those children who are separated from their parents and moved to Vermont pursuant to \n21 \nthe  Policy.  That  responsibility  includes,  when  appropriate,  commencing  juvenile  judicial \n22 \n23  proceedings and incurring significant costs to ensure that children are receiving safe and \n24  adequate care.

The  Policy’s  negative  impact  upon  immigrants  also  threatens  Vermont’s \n2 \neconomic interests.  For example, in 2014, immigrant households paid $57.9 million in state and \n3 \nlocal taxes.  Of that amount, undocumented immigrants paid an estimated $2.9 million in state \n4 \nand local taxes that year.  Immigrants also greatly contributed to the economy with over $462.5 \n5 \nmillion in spending power.

In Minnesota, any child, including children who have been separated from their \n18 \nparents, is eligible to a free public education.  On average, per pupil expenditures for the current \n19 \nfiscal year is $12,251 per child.  Of this total, approximately 96% comes from state and local \n20 \nresources.  If, as may be expected, an immigrant child requires services through the English \n21 \nLearners program, the state funds an additional $700 or $950 per child.  Children in Minnesota \n22 \n23  may also require special education, mental health services, and other programs delivered within \n24  the school district. Unaccompanied children, including those who are separated from their \n25 \nparents, may also receive child care assistance in certain settings. \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  86  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

Separated children may also be eligible for healthcare programs that are partially \n10 \nor fully funded by the State of Illinois, including Medicaid.  In FY 2014, for example, Illinois \n11 \nspent an average of approximately $2,108 per Medicaid-eligible child.  See Medicaid Spending \n12 \nPer  Enrollee  (Full  or  Partial  Benefit),  KAISER  FAMILY  FOUND., \n13 \nhttps://www.kff.org/medicaid/state-indicator/medicaid-spending-per-enrollee/ (last visited June \n14 \n15  22, 2018). \n16  276.  In addition, children who have been separated from their parents may access state \n17 \ncourts in Illinois in order to obtain Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS). In order to petition \n18 \nthe U.S. Customs and Immigration Services for a SIJS, a child must first obtain an order from a \n19 \nstate court finding that it is not in the child’s best interests to return to her home country or to \n20 \nthe country she last lived in, and that the child cannot be reunited with a parent because of abuse, \n21 \nabandonment, or neglect. As additional children are brought to Illinois as a result of Defendants’ \n22 \n23  child separation policy, Illinois courts will see an increase in the number of orders being sought. \n24  277.  New York. In FY 2017, ORR placed 3,938 children with New York resident \n25 \nsponsors. ORR placed another 1,577 UACs with New York resident sponsors from October 2017 \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  90  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

See Unaccompanied Alien Children Released to Sponsors by State, \n2 \navailable at Ex. 88. \n3 \n278.  Once a UAC is placed with a sponsor who resides in New York State, the child \n4 \nis entitled to a variety of services funded by the state, including educational services, early \n5 \nintervention services, and access to healthcare, among others. New York State makes these \n6 \nservices available to such children in support of the State’s interest in ensuring the health, safety, \n7 \n8  and well-being of all residents. \n9 \n279.  New York State will incur expenses to educate UACs placed within the state \n10 \nbecause under state law, children ages six through sixteen who reside in New York must attend \n11 \nschool and are entitled to attend school up until age twenty-one. Moreover, the IDEA requires \n12 \nthe state to provide special education services to students with learning or emotional disabilities. \n13 \nUnder this federal law, children aged three to twenty-one are entitled to special education \n14 \n15  services when clinically warranted.  20 U.S.C. § 1411.  New York State law also entitles \n16  qualified students to English Language Learner (ELL) services. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. \n17 \nTit. 8, § 154.  There are 692 public school districts in New York that serve approximately 2.6 \n18 \nmillion students. While costs will vary depending on the school district’s location and the child’s \n19 \nneeds, the statewide average to educate a student in New York is approximately $22,000 per \n20 \nyear.  \n21 \n280.  New York State also provides a robust early intervention program which UACs \n22 \n23  utilize when placed in New York State communities. The Part C Early Intervention Program \n24  (EIP)  was  created  by  Congress  in  1986  as  part  of  the  IDEA.  The  IDEA  authorizes  the \n25 \ndiscretionary EIP for infants and toddlers with disabilities and requires states to provide a free \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  91  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

Each year, New York’s EIP serves over 60,000 children ages zero to three who have \n3 \nmoderate to severe developmental delays. The EIP includes 1,279 providers that contract with \n4 \nNew York State to bill for EI services. Total annual expenditures for New York’s EIP total more \n5 \nthan $644 million across all payers—45% is covered by Medicaid, 2% by commercial insurance, \n6 \n26% by state funds, and 27% by county funds. While EIP costs and services vary based on the \n7 \n8  child’s needs and the intensity of services offered, for the 2017 program year the average cost of \n9 \nservices delivered ranged from $5,820 to $22,000 per child. \n10 \n281.  New York State also incurs significant medical expenses for each UAC placed in \n11 \nstate.   UACs who are placed with sponsors in the community are eligible to enroll in the \n12 \nChildren’s  Health  Insurance  Program  (CHIP)  operated  by  New  York’s  Office  of  Health \n13 \nInsurance Programs. The yearly cost of CHIP per child is $2,607.36 and is financed exclusively \n14 \n15  by New York State.  \n16  282.  An influx of UACs also carries with it increased costs for the New York State \n17 \nchild welfare system. After a UAC is placed with a sponsor in the community, that placement \n18 \nmay be disrupted for a number of reasons. If the child becomes at risk of entering foster care—\n19 \nfor example, because of allegations of abuse or neglect by the person now legally responsible \n20 \nfor the child—the child welfare system will provide preventive services to attempt to keep the \n21 \nchild safely in the new home; such services are funded, in part, by New York State. If those \n22 \n23  services are unsuccessful and the child must be removed from the new home, New York State \n24  will also partly fund the child’s placement and needed services while in the foster system. \n25 \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  92  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

This includes unaccompanied alien children who may be \n2 \ninvolved in immigration proceedings.  Once these children are released to a sponsor, they have \n3 \na right to enroll in Virginia schools regardless of their immigration status.  In Virginia, some of \n4 \nthese unaccompanied alien children under 18 will be classified as homeless under applicable \n5 \nstate and federal law. See Va. Code Ann. § 22.1-3. Virginia school divisions are required to \n6 \nimmediately enroll homeless students. The Virginia Department of Education provides the state \n7 \n8  share, and the enrolling local school division is responsible for paying the local share of the cost \n9 \nfor  educating  students  enrolled  in  public  schools  at  a  total  per  pupil  statewide  average \n10 \nexpenditure in excess of $10,000. \n11 \n289.  Unaccompanied alien children may seek a variety of health services in Virginia. \n12 \nFor example, they need childhood immunizations and may seek testing and treatment when they \n13 \npresent with symptoms of a communicable disease. In Virginia, school divisions are required to \n14 \n15  help  any  child  classified  as  homeless  obtain  necessary  physical  examinations  and \n16  immunizations. Va. Code § 22.1-271.2. Moreover, if an unaccompanied alien child needed to be \n17 \nhospitalized for emergency care, including psychiatric care, then Virginia would provide and \n18 \nbear the cost of that care in part by absorption of costs by state-owned hospitals. \n19 \n290.

For FY 2017, the last year for which complete \n6 \ndata are available, ORR placed almost 300 children with District of Columbia resident sponsors.  \n7 \n8  As of April 30, 2018, ORR’s available data show that the District of Columbia has already \n9 \nreceived more than 80 unaccompanied children during this fiscal year. See Ex. 88.  \n10 \n293.  In  the  District  of  Columbia,  any  child,  including  children  who  have  been \n11 \nseparated from their parents, is entitled to a free public education. The District spends almost \n12 \n$10,000 per child  in D.C Public Schools. The overwhelming share of the money spent on public \n13 \neducation  in  the  District  comes  from  local  taxes,  fees,  and  resources.

Defendants’ Policy Harms the States’ Quasi-Sovereign Interests \n2 \n295.  States have a quasi-sovereign interest in protecting the health, safety, and well-\n3 \nbeing of their residents, including protecting their residents from harms to their physical, \n4 \npsychological, emotional, or economic health. The States’ interests in preventing and remedying \n5 \ninjuries to the public’s health, safety, and well-being extends to all of their residents who will be \n6 \nharmed by the Policy. The Policy has caused and will continue to cause severe and immediate \n7 \n8  harm to the States’ residents, including parents who are detained, released, or otherwise reside \n9 \nin the States after being forcibly separated from their children; children who are placed in \n10 \nfacilities, shelters, homes or otherwise reside in the States after being separated from their \n11 \nparents; extended families and sponsors in the States; and the States’ immigrant communities.  \n12 \n296.  The States also have an interest in ensuring that their residents are not excluded \n13 \nfrom the rights and privileges provided by the U.S. Constitution, international laws, federal laws, \n14 \n15  and state laws. These rights include due process and equal protection rights afforded to alien \n16  parents and their minor children, and rights and protections under federal asylum and refugee \n17 \nlaws, international human rights laws, and state laws.  \n18 \n297.  The Policy causes measurable harm to existing immigrant communities in the \n19 \nStates.  A 2018 study published in the Journal of Adolescent Health finds that recent changes in \n20 \nU.S.  immigration  policy  that  appear  to  target  Latino  immigrants  have  triggered  serious \n21 \npsychological distress for many resident Latino parents, including those living in the United \n22 \n23  States legally.  A substantial proportion of U.S. Latino parents reported adverse emotional and \n24  behavioral consequences from recent immigration actions and news. For example, 66% said that \n25 \nthey very often or always worry about family members getting separated.  Nearly 40% of parents \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  97  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

Parents  who  frequently \n3 \nexperienced worries or changes in behavior due to immigration news and policies had at least a \n4 \n250% increase in the odds of experiencing high psychological distress, including clinical anxiety \n5 \nand depression. The association between U.S. immigration actions and psychological distress in \n6 \nthis study held true after controlling for education, residency status, gender and other factors. \n7 \n8  298.  Many of the States have resident Latino and Hispanic populations that are \n9 \naffected by the Policy and attendant distress.  For example, as of 2010, 10.2 percent of the total \n10 \npopulation of Washington State was of Hispanic origin, with some counties over 45%.  Indeed, \n11 \nroughly one in seven Washington residents is an immigrant, while one in eight residents is a \n12 \nnative-born U.S. citizen with at least one immigrant parent.  The other States also have resident \n13 \nLatino and Hispanic communities who are impacted by the Policy, as well. \n14 \n15  299.  Indeed, the States are already acting to try to protect the health, safety, and well-\n16  being of persons separated and harmed by the Policy.  As a result of the Policy, thousands of \n17 \nimmigrant parents and children are being separated and moved to a range of facilities or homes \n18 \nin the States or being released to live in the States. Transfer of these separated immigrant parents \n19 \nand children into the States will continue into the future as long as Defendants’ Policy remains \n20 \nin place.  See Exs. 55, 8, 21. In May 2018 alone, DHS took nearly 51,912 immigrants into \n21 \ncustody, nearly three times the number detained in May 2017. Ex. 55. The number of families \n22 \n23  apprehended at the Southwestern border increased by 435% in May 2018 in comparison to May \n24  2017. Ex. 8.

Traumatized immigrant parents and children are already present in the States’ \n2 \nshelters and in federal detention centers in the States.  On June 7, 2018, ICE spokeswoman \n3 \nDanielle Bennett confirmed that because of “implementation of the U.S. Department of Justice’s \n4 \nzero-tolerance Policy . . . ICE has entered into inter-agency agreements with [the Bureau of \n5 \nPrisons (BOP)] to acquire access to more than 1,600 additional beds at [five] BOP facilities.”   \n6 \nThese include 220 beds at the Federal Detention Center SeaTac in Seattle, Washington; 130 beds \n7 \n8  in Sheridan, Oregon; and 1,000 beds at the Federal Correctional Institution Victorville Medium \n9 \nSecurity Prison in Victorville, California.

Id. \n3 \n302.  These women described the horrific and inhumane conditions at the Border Patrol \n4 \nfacilities where they were previously detained, including fenced cages; lack of blankets and mats \n5 \nnotwithstanding frigid temperatures; and lack of access to food and water. Id. Some suffered \n6 \nverbal abuse from border agents who called them “filthy” and “stinky.”  Id.  And they endured \n7 \n8  further intentionally inflicted trauma when agents told them their “families would not exist \n9 \nanymore” and that they would “never see their children again.” Id. \n10 \n303.  The specific stories of two immigrant mothers who are being detained in Seattle \n11 \nconfirm this horrifying experience.  These two mothers crossed the border in Texas, immediately \n12 \nturned themselves in, and were taken to a holding facility.  The mothers were each separated \n13 \nfrom their daughters upon arrival and held in a facility they describe as similar to a dog kennel. \n14 \n15  The following week, the mothers appeared in federal court, were charged with illegal entry, \n16  found guilty, and served time in Texas.  After approximately three weeks, the mothers were \n17 \nflown to SeaTac, where they remain in prison without their daughters. \n18 \n304.  A  growing  number  of  children  separated  from  their  parents  pursuant  to \n19 \nDefendants’ Policy have been placed in facilities in Washington.

In Massachusetts, two Guatemalan children were recently released to their father, \n10 \na Massachusetts resident, after being separated from their mother, with whom they crossed the \n11 \nborder to seek asylum.  She is still in detention in Texas. The children were held in facilities in \n12 \nTexas and then Michigan for five weeks until they were released to their father.  The young girl, \n13 \nwho is 9 years old, has been particularly affected by the experience and still cries for her mother. \n14 \n15  See Mark Sullivan, Guatemalan in Westboro Sees the Effects of Separation Policy Firsthand, \n16  The  Worcester  Telegram  &  Gazette  (June  20,  2018)  available  at \n17 \nhttp://www.telegram.com/news/20180620/guatemalan-in-westboro-sees-effects-of-separation-\n18 \npolicy-firsthand, attached hereto as Ex. 118. \n19 \n307.  Defendants’ abhorrent and indefensible family-separation Policy has already had \n20 \nan impact on Oregon in a variety of ways, and will continue to do so.  There are at least 123 \n21 \nimmigrant men detained at the federal prison in Sheridan, Oregon.  At least six of these are \n22 \n23  fathers, from Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras, who have been separated from their children \n24  pursuant to the Policy.  Oregon’s federal lawmakers have been able to visit these detainees, and \n25 \nreport that they have been denied access to lawyers and health care and are confined to cells for \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  101  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

Oregon immigration lawyers also report that they have been repeatedly \n2 \ndenied access to detainees.  The Mexican Consulate reports that one of the detained men had his \n3 \nnewborn infant, only 15 days old, taken from him.  Another detainee was separated from his 18-\n4 \nmonth-old toddler.  Another reports his wife is detained in San Antonio, Texas, and he does not \n5 \nknow the whereabouts of their 4-year-old child.   \n6 \n308.  There are a number of children in Oregon who have been separated from their \n7 \n8  parents by the defendants’ implementation of its Policy, including two children who saw their \n9 \nmother being taken away in chains.  At least three others have been separated from their parents \n10 \nat the border pursuant to the Policy.    \n11 \n309.  Defendants’  unlawful  Policy  also  cruelly  affects  the  wellbeing  of  Oregon \n12 \nresidents,  including  its  immigrant  and  Hispanic  and  Latinx  populations.    For  example,  a \n13 \nsubstantial number of Oregon residents are survivors of the Japanese-American internment \n14 \n15  camps of World War II, or family members of such survivors.  Many of those survivors and/or \n16  family members have experienced significant emotional and psychological distress as a result of \n17 \nthe government’s family-separation Policy.   \n18 \n310.  Similarly, some Oregonians are survivors of Nazi concentration camps. Many of \n19 \nthose survivors are also experiencing profound psychological and emotional distress as a result \n20 \nof the federal government’s family-separation Policy.  For all these Oregon survivors and their \n21 \nfamilies, the Policy echoes the ethnic-based targeting that they experienced in the twentieth \n22 \n23  century, and causes them to relive the trauma of one of the darkest times in history.  Many \n24  survivors are also profoundly afraid for the safety of minority communities targeted by the \n25 \ncurrent Administration. \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  102  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

Defendants’ Policy similarly harms immigrant parents and children in California \n2 \nwho have been separated by federal immigration officials. For example, at least 50-60 children \n3 \nare being served in group homes and family homes approved by foster family agencies in \n4 \nCalifornia as a result of Defendants’ Policy. \n5 \n312.  Additionally, parents, including asylum-seekers, who have been separated from \n6 \ntheir  children  are  being  housed  at  facilities  throughout  Southern  California.  There  is  a \n7 \n8  particularly large number of immigration detainees being held at the Victorville facility, but \n9 \nunlike the SeaTac facility, attorneys have been denied access to determine how many of those \n10 \nindividuals are parents.  \n11 \n313.  Several asylum-seeker parents who arrived at a port of entry with a migrant \n12 \ncaravan in April 2018 were separated from their children. While their children have been placed \n13 \nby ORR in facilities across the nation, the parents are being detained in other immigration \n14 \n15  detention  facilities  in  California.    Parents  are  not  provided  with  information  about  their \n16  children’s whereabouts or how to locate them.  As a result, parents have been unable to locate \n17 \nor communicate with their children, are not receiving regular in-person visitation or phone \n18 \ncontact with their children, and have not been told if or when their families will be reunified.  \n19 \n314.  Likewise, New Mexico has a right to ensure that no one within its border is \n20 \nexcluded from the rights and privileges provided by the U.S. Constitution, international, federal \n21 \nor state law. State resources are used without statutory authority if used in furtherance of \n22 \n23  unconstitutional federal policies contravening the purposes of New Mexico’s constitution and \n24  laws. There is well documented evidence to suggest that these interests are currently being \n25 \ninfringed upon with the boundaries of the State of New Mexico. \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  103  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

Because there is direct evidence of harm to these families, occurring within the \n4 \nborders of New Mexico, the state has a distinct interest in ensuring that no violations of law \n5 \noccur. This notion is grounded in general principles of federalism, and are distinctly the \n6 \nobligations of the state in ensuring that its constitution and laws are upheld. This interstitial \n7 \n8  framework is well grounded in law and is the underpinning of our system of government.  \n9 \n319.

As of June 22, 2018, \n7 \n8  approximately 66 minor children, who have been separated from their parents or guardians and \n9 \nare awaiting immigration proceedings, are currently under the care of Heartland Alliance. \n10 \nCurrently, Heartland is housing these separated children in the cities of Chicago and Des Plaines. \n11 \n327.  Heartland  is  endeavoring  to  reunite  the  66  separated  children  with  family \n12 \nmembers in the United States. Certain of these children will likely remain in Illinois, given the \n13 \nfact that 1,568 unaccompanied minors were released to sponsors located in Illinois between \n14 \n15  October 2014 and April 2018.  See Ex. 88. \n16  328.  New York State relies on the same agencies that the federal ORR relies on for \n17 \nprovision of foster care services. ORR currently contracts with eleven provider agencies in New \n18 \nYork State to care for UACs, including those children whom Defendants have separated from \n19 \ntheir parents: Abbott House; Catholic Family Center; Catholic Guardian Services; Cayuga Home \n20 \nfor Children; Children’s Home of Kingston; Children’s Village; Jewish Child Care Association \n21 \nof New York; Rising Ground (formerly Leake and Watts Services); Lincoln Hall; Lutheran \n22 \n23  Social Services of New York; and MercyFirst.

OCFS has confirmed that at least 321 children who \n3 \nhave been separated from their parents at the Southwestern border are currently in the care of \n4 \none of these eleven agencies and thus residing in New York State. Since the State was unable to \n5 \nobtain this information from HHS or ORR, OCFS undertook efforts to create a census of \n6 \nseparated children in New York State. Specifically, OCFS’s Acting Commissioner issued a \n7 \n8  directive to the agencies to confirm the total number of UACs in their care. Upon receipt of that \n9 \ninformation, OCFS staff verbally verified with each voluntary agency how many of those \n10 \nchildren were in fact separated from their families at the border. To accomplish this, OCFS staff \n11 \ntook a hiatus from their regular duties and, in a single day, physically went to each of the 11 \n12 \nagencies to review records and interview children in order to obtain a current head count. ORR \n13 \nhas still not confirmed this number or shared data regarding how many children have already \n14 \n15  come through these voluntary agencies, or how many it plans to send to these voluntary agencies \n16  in the future. \n17 \n329.  Staff at one voluntary agency have informed local government officials that the \n18 \nages of most children newly placed at their agency, many of whom were separated from family \n19 \nat the border, are between four and twelve.  The youngest child so far was a nine-month-old \n20 \nbaby, in addition to multiple not-yet-verbal toddlers. \n21 \n330.  The children whom Defendants have separated from their parents and sent to New \n22 \n23  York are suffering extreme trauma.

The distraught child verbalized that he wanted to jump because he \n2 \nmissed his parents. Twelve other young immigrant children who were separated from their \n3 \nparents at the border have been treated for physical and mental illnesses at New York City \n4 \nhospitals. One child was suicidal and others were treated for depression and anxiety. See Jillian \n5 \nJorgensen, City hospitals have treated 12 immigrant children who were taken from parents, \n6 \nincluding  a  suicidal  child,  N.Y.

New York State has a quasi-sovereign interest in the health, safety and well-being \n11 \nof all children within its borders, and Defendant’s separation policy directly undermines that \n12 \ninterest by causing severe trauma to these children.  New York State goes to great lengths to \n13 \nprovide significant due process protections for both parents and children when families are \n14 \n15  separated as a result of government action. When a child is placed in foster care in New York, \n16  state statutes and regulations afford both the parent and the child a range of rights, including the \n17 \nright of visitation. Indeed, the child’s family service plan must include a plan for regular \n18 \nvisitation between the parents and child. N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law § 409-e; N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & \n19 \nRegs. Tit. 18 § 428.3. See also N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act § 1030(a) (providing that a parent has a right \n20 \nof regular and reasonable visitation with a child in foster care unless otherwise prohibited by \n21 \ncourt order). This right of regular visitation is afforded even when one or both parents is \n22 \n23  incarcerated in a prison or jail. In that situation, the child welfare agency must make suitable \n24  arrangements with the correctional facility for a parent to visit with the child, unless the visiting \n25 \nwould be harmful to the child. 11 OCFS ADM 07.  Moreover, parents who are incarcerated are \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  109  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

See N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. \n3 \n18 § 428.9. To protect these vital rights, state law provides that the parent of a child in foster \n4 \ncare has a right to assigned counsel by the court where such parent is financially unable to obtain \n5 \none. N.Y. Family Court Act § 26. Such rules are premised on the importance of the parent-child \n6 \nbond, and the parent’s critical, indispensable role in assuring that the needs of his or her child \n7 \n8  are met. Here, by contrast, the parents and children whom Defendants have separated at the \n9 \nborder are afforded no visitation procedure and have no process to recognize or protect their \n10 \nrights.  Due to Defendant’s illegal policy, the separated children who are currently residing in \n11 \nNew York are being treated differently than other children in foster care in the State, to their \n12 \ngreat detriment and in direct contravention of the state’s interest in ensuring the health, safety, \n13 \nand well-being of all its residents.     \n14 \n15  332.  Upon information and belief, family members of separated children currently \n16  reside in New York State.  An HHS spokesman stated that “[t]here’s an effort to place [children \n17 \nwho were separated at the border] as closely as possible to where they’re going to be eventually \n18 \nreunified with a sponsor or a family member” and that if a child was placed in New York it \n19 \nusually means that there is a family member residing in the state who is a possible placement \n20 \noption for the child.

Maryland has an interest in the health, safety, and wellbeing of all its residents, \n4 \nincluding any parents or children being placed in Maryland under the Policy.  Immigration agents \n5 \nare reported to have sent dozens of children to Maryland during the implementation of the Trump \n6 \nAdministration’s family separation policy.  The children often have no family connection to the \n7 \n8  state; they are sent here because the system has capacity.  Some of the children have been placed \n9 \nwith foster families coordinated by care organizations, while others are placed in residential \n10 \ngroup child care.  \n11 \n334.  Immigration officials are sending separated children to Maryland without the \n12 \nmost basic information about the children or their parents, or how to connect them with one \n13 \nanother.  And many of the children have come with little or no information and are too young—\n14 \n15  as young as 18 months—to communicate with caregivers or social workers trying to track down \n16  relatives who could take them in.  Thus, the sheltering organizations that are housing the children \n17 \ndo not know how to identify, let alone locate, the children’s parents, who risk deportation before \n18 \nthey can find or be reunited with their children. \n19 \n335.  Care organizations report that children who have been separated from their \n20 \nparents suffer greater trauma than other unaccompanied minors whom the organizations care for.  \n21 \nFor some of these children, their suffering is immediately apparent, as has been shown in \n22 \n23  publicly available videos and other recordings.

Parents who have been separated from their children are also being sent to \n9 \nMaryland and detained in local facilities that contract with ICE to hold detainees, mostly pending \n10 \ncriminal process.  Anne Arundel, Frederick, Howard, and Worcester counties have all agreed to \n11 \nhold immigration detainees, and the Anne Arundel Detention Center is reportedly holding at \n12 \nleast two parents who have been separated from their children under the Trump Administration’s \n13 \npolicy.  See Ex. 127.  In addition, Maryland is the location of a Federal Correctional Institution \n14 \n15  and the Chesapeake Detention Facility where, by contract, the federal government houses federal \n16  pre-trial detainees, which might be affected by ICE’s policy of housing separated parents in \n17 \nfederal detention facilities.  Parents held in Maryland have little contact with their children and \n18 \nno information about where they are being held.  One was reportedly separated from his five-\n19 \nyear-old daughter by force and has not had any contact with, or information about, her in the two \n20 \nmonths since.  See Patricia Sullivan, Md., Va. congressmen hear stories of family separation, the \n21 \nWashington  Post  (June  21,  2018)  at  B4,  available  at \n22 \n23  https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/immigration/md-va-congressmen-hear-stories-of-family-\n24  separation/2018/06/20/af3fe0ae-74aa-11e8-b4b7-\n25 \n308400242c2e_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.fa6d5bb19919, attached hereto as Ex. 128. \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  112  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

In other respects, as well, ORR is using facilities in Maryland to facilitate the \n2 \nAdministration’s family separation policy without providing the transparency that would allow \n3 \nMaryland to ensure the safety and security of its residents, including the parents and children \n4 \nwho have been separated from one another under the policy.  ORR has provided no information \n5 \nabout the care and circumstances of immigrant children detained within Maryland’s borders—\n6 \nwhere they are being held; what condition they are in; where their parents are; whether they have \n7 \n8  adequate food,  clothing and shelter; whether they  have access to medical care  and legal \n9 \nrepresentation; or when and how they will be reunited with their families. \n10 \n338.  Children separated from their families as a result of Defendants’ actions have \n11 \nbeen sent to organizations in Pennsylvania. For instance, 50 child immigrants separated from \n12 \ntheir families are being housed at the Holy Family Institute in Emsworth, Pennsylvania, a \n13 \nCatholic social services organization that is under contract with Defendant ORR.  See Paula \n14 \n15  Reed Ward and Ashley Murray, Child migrants separated from families housed at Holy Family \n16  Institute in Emsworth, Pittsburg Post-Gazette (June 17, 2018) available at http://www.post-\n17 \ngazette.com/news/faith-religion/2018/06/17/Child-migrants-separated-from-families-being-\n18 \nhoused-at-Holy-Family-Institute/stories/201806160074,  attached  hereto  as  Ex.  129.  The \n19 \nchildren, who range in age from 4 to 17, are from Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, and other \n20 \ncountries. Other child immigrants separated from their parents as a result of Defendants’ actions \n21 \nhave been placed with a shelter in Pennsylvania’s Lehigh Valley.  See Laura Benshoff, As Trump \n22 \n23  ends family separation policy, children removed from their parents are already in Pa., (June 21, \n24  2018),  available  at  https://whyy.org/segments/as-trump-ends-family-separation-policy-\n25 \nchildren-removed-from-their-parents-are-already-in-pa/, attached hereto as Ex. 130. \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  113  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue. Suite 2000 \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00939   Document 1   Filed 06/26/18   Page 114 of 128\n \n1  339.  The  District  of  Columbia  places  an  emphasis  on  preserving  families  and \n2 \nreunifying families even when children become involved with the state due to child abuse or \n3 \nneglect.  See D.C. Code § 4-1303.03(a)(11) and (a)(13).  The District of Columbia follows the \n4 \nUnited States Supreme Court’s holdings that there is “a presumption that fit parents act in the \n5 \nbest interests of their children,” Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 68, (2000), and recognition \n6 \nthat the state may not “inject itself into the private realm of the family” absent a finding of \n7 \n8  unfitness. Id. at 68–69. The Court has frequently emphasized the importance of the family, and \n9 \nhas held that individuals have a fundamental right to parent their own children. Stanley v. Illinois, \n10 \n405 U.S. 645, 651 (1972). This important relationship may not be terminated without a predicate \n11 \ndetermination, by clear and convincing evidence that the individual is unfit to parent.  Santosky \n12 \nv. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745 760, 768–71 (1982). \n13 \n340.  The District of Columbia also prohibits discrimination based upon the race, color, \n14 \n15  religion, national origin, sex, age, marital status, personal appearance, sexual orientation, gender \n16  identity or expression, familial status, family responsibilities, genetic information, disability, \n17 \nmatriculation, or political affiliation, source of income, status as a victim of an intrafamily \n18 \noffense, and place of residence or business of any individual.  D.C. Code § 2-1401.01. \n19 \n341.  Defendants’  Policy  causes  severe  and  potentially  permanent  emotional  and \n20 \npsychological trauma to children who have been separated from their parents, some of whom \n21 \nare placed with sponsors in the District of Columbia. The number of children placed with \n22 \n23  sponsors in the District will increase as the sponsors are identified and vetted, and approved to \n24  receive these children. \n25 \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  114  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue. Suite 2000 \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00939   Document 1   Filed 06/26/18   Page 115 of 128\n \n1 \nV.  CAUSES OF ACTION \n2 \nCount I: Violation of Fifth Amendment – Substantive Due Process \n3 \n342.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set \n4 \nforth herein. \n5 \n343.  State residents who are parents have a fundamental liberty interest in the care, \n6 \ncustody, and control of their children. This includes current state residents and those who may \n7 \n8  arrive in the States following separation pursuant to Defendants’ Policy.  \n9 \n344.  State residents who are minors have a reciprocal liberty interest in their parents’ \n10 \ncare. This includes current state residents and those who may arrive in the States following \n11 \nseparation pursuant to Defendants’ Policy.  \n12 \n345.  State residents who are minors have a right to be free of unreasonable risk of \n13 \nharm, including trauma from separation and detention, as well as the risk of harm from housing \n14 \n15  them in unlicensed facilities. \n16  346.  Defendants’ Policy offends the Due Process Clause by separating parents from \n17 \ntheir children without any showing that the parent is unfit or is otherwise endangering the child. \n18 \n347.  Defendants’ violation causes ongoing harm to the States and their residents. \n19 \nCount II: Violation of Fifth Amendment – Procedural Due Process \n20 \n348.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set \n21 \nforth herein. \n22 \n23  349.  The  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fifth  Amendment  prohibits  the  federal \n24  government from depriving individuals of their liberty interests without due process of law. \n25 \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  115  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue. Suite 2000 \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00939   Document 1   Filed 06/26/18   Page 116 of 128\n \n1  350.  Defendants’ Policy deprives the States’ residents of a fundamental liberty interest \n2 \nwith no hearing whatsoever. This includes current state residents and those who will arrive in \n3 \nthe States following separation pursuant to Defendants’ Policy. \n4 \n351.  Defendants have violated the procedural due process guarantees of the Fifth \n5 \nAmendment.  \n6 \n352.  Defendants’ violation causes ongoing harm to the States and their residents.  \n7 \n8  Count III: Violation of Fifth Amendment – Equal Protection \n9 \n353.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set \n10 \nforth herein. \n11 \n354.  The  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fifth  Amendment  prohibits  the  federal \n12 \ngovernment from denying equal protection of the laws. \n13 \n355.  The Policy burdens a fundamental right and targets individuals for discriminatory \n14 \n15  treatment based on their nationality or ethnicity, without lawful justification, and is therefore not \n16  narrowly  tailored  to  achieve  a  compelling  governmental  interest.  The  Policy  is  also \n17 \nunconstitutional because it disparately impacts immigrants from Latin America arriving at the \n18 \nSouthwestern border and is motivated by animus and a desire to harm this particular group.  \n19 \n356.  Alternatively, the discriminatory terms and application of the Policy are arbitrary \n20 \nand do not bear a rational relationship to a legitimate federal interest. \n21 \n357.  Through their actions above, Defendants have violated the equal protection \n22 \n23  guarantee of the Fifth Amendment.  \n24  358.  Defendants’ violation causes ongoing harm to the States and their residents. \n25 \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  116  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue. Suite 2000 \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00939   Document 1   Filed 06/26/18   Page 117 of 128\n \n1 \nCount IV: Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act \n2 \n359.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set \n3 \nforth herein. \n4 \n360.  The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), prohibits federal agency \n5 \naction that is arbitrary, unconstitutional, and contrary to statute.  \n6 \n361.  Defendants’  Policy  constitutes  final  agency  action  for  purposes  of  the \n7 \n8  Administrative Procedure Act. \n9 \n362.  Defendants have offered no legitimate basis for their Policy. \n10 \n363.  Defendants’ Policy is arbitrary and capricious because it conflicts with various \n11 \nlaws requiring Defendants and the States to consider the best interests and well-being of children \n12 \narriving to the United States. \n13 \n364.  The Policy is not authorized or required by the TVPRA, which only applies to \n14 \n15  unaccompanied minors. The minors subject to Defendants’ Policy are not “unaccompanied,” as \n16  they are accompanied by a parent or guardian.  Indeed, in a White House Press Release, dated \n17 \nOctober 8, 2017, Defendants released a “detailed outline of President Trump’s immigration \n18 \nprinciples and policies” which states Defendants’ agreement that “alien minors [] are not UACs \n19 \n[if they are] accompanied by a parent or legal guardian.” See Immigration Principles & Policies, \n20 \navailable  at  http://www.aila.org/infonet/wh-immigration-principles-and-policies,      attached \n21 \nhereto as Ex. 131.  \n22 \n23  365.  Further,  as  alleged  herein,  the  separation  Policy  contravenes  the  spirit  and \n24  purpose of the TVPRA, which seeks to protect children.  In general, the TVPRA requires, \n25 \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  117  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue. Suite 2000 \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00939   Document 1   Filed 06/26/18   Page 118 of 128\n \n1  whenever possible, family reunification or other appropriate placement for unaccompanied alien \n2 \nchildren. See 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(2)(A).  \n3 \n366.  In  implementing  the  Policy,  federal  agencies  have  taken  or  will  take \n4 \nunconstitutional and unlawful action, as alleged herein, in violation of the Administrative \n5 \nProcedure Act. \n6 \n367.  In  implementing  the  Policy,  federal  agencies  have  applied  or  will  apply \n7 \n8  provisions arbitrarily, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. \n9 \n368.  Defendants’ violation causes ongoing harm to the State and its residents. \n10 \nCount V: Violation of Asylum Laws  \n11 \n369.  Under United States law, noncitizens with a well-founded fear of persecution \n12 \nshall have the opportunity to obtain asylum in the United States. 8 U.S.C. § 1158 (“[a]ny alien \n13 \nwho is physically present in the United States or who arrives in the United States . . . irrespective \n14 \n15  of such alien’s status, may apply for asylum in accordance with this section.”). Federal law also \n16  prohibits the return of a noncitizen to a country where he may face torture or persecution. See 8 \n17 \nU.S.C. § 1231(b); United Nations Convention Against Torture (CAT), implemented in the \n18 \nForeign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-277, div. G, Title XXII, \n19 \n§ 2242, 112 Stat. 2681, 2681-822 (1998) (codified as Note to 8 U.S.C. § 1231). \n20 \n370.  In enacting these statutes, Congress created a right to petition our government for \n21 \nasylum that at the very least requires that asylum seekers be able to present themselves at ports \n22 \n23  of  entry  to  request  asylum.  Defendants  are  preventing  asylum-seekers  from  presenting \n24  themselves at ports of entry that are allegedly “full,” thus preventing asylum claims from being \n25 \nheard, in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1158. \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  118  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue. Suite 2000 \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \n206-464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00939   Document 1   Filed 06/26/18   Page 119 of 128\n \n1  371.  Another effect of turning asylum-seekers away prior to their reaching a port of \n2 \nentry is that the immigrants are then forced to cross the border outside a port of entry, in a claimed \n3 \nviolation of 8 U.S.C. § 1325, in order to present their asylum claim. But under the Policy, all \n4 \nsuch border-crossing violations are referred to the Department of Justice and prosecuted. \n5 \nBy criminalizing the pursuit of asylum, this Policy runs counter to established immigration and \n6 \nrefugee laws that allow a person to present themselves to immigration officials to request asylum \n7 \n8  wherever they are able. \n9 \nVI.  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n10 \n  Plaintiffs request that the Court enter a judgment against Defendants and award the \n11 \nfollowing relief: \n12 \na.  Enjoin Defendants from refusing to accept applications for asylum at a \n13 \nvalid port of entry, and from criminally charging asylum applicants with illegal entry or \n14 \n15  re-entry if they present themselves at a valid port of entry; \n16  b.  Declare Defendants’ family separation Policy unauthorized by or contrary \n17 \nto the Constitution and laws of the United States;  \n18 \nc.  Enjoin Defendants from enforcing the family separation Policy, including \n19 \nat all United States borders and ports of entry, pending further orders from this Court; \n20 \nd.  Order Defendants to expeditiously reunite all children with parents from \n21 \nwhom they have been separated pursuant to the Policy, unless a court of competent \n22 \n23  jurisdiction has found the parents to be unfit; \n24 \n25 \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  119  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

Enjoin  Defendants  from  conditioning  family  reunification  on  an  \n2 \nagreement not to petition for asylum or other relief available under the INA, or on an \n3 \nagreement to withdraw a petition or other request for that relief;   \n4 \nf.  Enjoin Defendants from removing separated parents from the United \n5 \nStates without their children, unless the parent affirmatively, knowingly, and voluntarily \n6 \nwaives the right to reunification before removal after consultation with an attorney; \n7 \n8  g.  Enjoin Defendants from placing children in unlicensed facilities; \n9 \nh.  Order Defendants to provide specific information to parents who are \n10 \nlawfully separated from their children about the nature and purpose of the separation, the \n11 \nprocess by which they can be reunified, and the whereabouts of their children at all times, \n12 \nabsent a finding by a court of competent jurisdiction that such information would be \n13 \ndangerous to a child’s welfare; \n14 \n15  i.  Award such additional relief as the interests of justice may require. \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  120  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

C18-939-MJP \n11    Plaintiffs,  ORDER GRANTING \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO \n12    v.  TRANSFER VENUE \n13  UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, et \nal., \n14 \n  Defendants. \n15 \n \n16 \nTHIS MATTER comes before the Court on Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, Transfer, or \n17 \nHold the Case in Abeyance.  (Dkt. No. 22.)  Having reviewed the Motion, the Response (Dkt. \n18 \nNo. 46), the Reply (Dkt. No. 83) and all related papers, and having considered the submissions \n19 \nof the parties at oral argument, the Court GRANTS the Motion to Transfer Venue and \n20 \nTRANSFERS this case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of California \n21 \nto be considered by the Honorable Judge Dana M. Sabraw in conjunction with the related \n22 \nproceedings before him.  \n23 \n \n24 \n \nORDER GRANTING DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO TRANSFER VENUE - 1 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00939-MJP   Document 88   Filed 08/08/18   Page 2 of 5\n \n1  Background \n2  Washington, California, Maryland, Oregon, New Mexico, New Jersey, New York, Iowa, \n3  Illinois, Minnesota, Rhode Island, Vermont, North Carolina, Delaware, Massachusetts, \n4  Pennsylvania, Virginia, and the District of Columbia (the “States”) filed this action on June 26, \n5  2018, challenging the government’s “zero tolerance” policy of forcibly separating immigrant \n6  families seeking asylum or other means of entry at the U.S.-Mexico border (the “Policy”).  \n7  (Dkt. No. 1 at ¶ 1.)   \n8  The States contend that, as a result of the Policy, they have received and will continue to \n9  receive an influx of separated immigrant parents and children.  (Id. at ¶ 225.)  In this regard, the \n10  States claim that the Policy harms their sovereign and proprietary interests by (1) interfering with \n11  their licensing authority and rendering them unable to enforce their own legal mandates and \n12  public policies favoring family unity and (2) burdening their legal, educational, healthcare, and \n13  other state-funded programs and systems.  (Id. at ¶¶ 164-173; 225-232.)  The States further claim \n14  that the Policy harms their quasi-sovereign interests in “protecting the health, safety, and well-\n15  being of their residents, including protecting their residents from harms to their physical, \n16  psychological, emotional, or economic health.”  (Id. at ¶ 295.)  Accordingly, they bring causes of \n17  action for violations of procedural and substantive due process (Counts I and II); equal protection \n18  (Count III); the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2) (Count IV); and the asylum \n19  laws, 8 U.S.C. § 1158 (Count V).  (Id. at ¶¶ 342-371.)    \n20  On the same day the States’ filed this action, Judge Sabraw certified a class and issued a \n21  nationwide preliminary injunction requiring the government to reunify separated families by July \n22  26, 2018.  See Ms. L. v. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 310 F. Supp. 3d 1133, \n23 \n24 \n \nORDER GRANTING DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO TRANSFER VENUE - 2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00939-MJP   Document 88   Filed 08/08/18   Page 3 of 5\n \n1  1149 (S.D. Cal. 2018).  That order also precluded future separations without certain findings and \n2  precluded parents from being removed prior to reunification.  (Id.) \n3    To date, more than 500 children have yet to be reunited with their parents.  In many of \n4  these cases, parents have either already been removed from the country, or their location within \n5  the country is otherwise unknown.  (See Ms. L, No. 18-428, Dkt. No. 171 (S.D. Cal. Aug. 2, \n6  2018).)  Under Judge Sabraw’s supervision, the government is actively working to locate those \n7  parents and reunite them with their children.   \n8  Discussion \n9    Defendants move to dismiss this action, or alternatively, to transfer venue or hold the \n10  proceedings in abeyance.  (Dkt. No. 22.)  Defendants contend that there is a “substantial overlap” \n11  between this case and Ms. L, where the class is comprised of the same individuals the States seek \n12  to represent as parens patriae.  (Id. at 4.)  The States respond that their “interests, claims, and \n13  requested relief are all undeniably broader than those at issue” in Ms. L, and that “the injuries to \n14  their proprietary, sovereign, and quasi-sovereign interests are not addressed by a class of \n15  separated parents.”  (Dkt. No. 46 at 6.) \n16  I.  Legal Standard \n17  A district court may transfer a civil action to another district “[f]or the convenience of the \n18  parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice,” so long as the transferee district is one where the \n19  case “might have been brought.”  See 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a).  Section 1404(a) grants the district \n20  court “broad discretion” to transfer cases based upon an “individualized, case-by-case \n21  consideration of convenience and fairness.”  Verint Sys. Inc. v. Envision Telephony Inc., No. \n22  14-1507MJP, 2015 WL 753540, at *2 (W.D. Wash. Feb. 23, 2015) (quoting Van Dusen v. \n23  Barrack, 376 U.S. 612, 622 (1964)).   \n24 \n \nORDER GRANTING DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO TRANSFER VENUE - 3 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00939-MJP   Document 88   Filed 08/08/18   Page 4 of 5\n \n1  II.  Transfer to the Southern District of California \n2  The primary of import of the States’ case is to reunite families as expeditiously as \n3  possible.  As numerous other district courts around the country have recognized, Judge Sabraw \n4  has been ably overseeing these efforts.  See, e.g., M.M.M. v. Sessions, No. 18-1959PLF, Dkt. \n5  No. 25 (D.D.C. Aug. 3, 2018); N.T.C. v. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, No. \n6  18-6428, Dkt. No. 20 (S.D.N.Y. July 19, 2018); E.S.R.B.  v. Sessions, No. 18-6654, Dkt. No. 4 \n7  (S.D.N.Y. July 24, 2018).   \n8  The Court finds that there is substantial overlap between the States’ claims and those \n9  being litigated in Ms. L.  The Court further finds no reason why the States’ case could not have \n10  been filed in the Southern District of California, nor why it must remain in the Western District \n11  of Washington.  While recognizing that the States have raised several claims that are distinct \n12  from those in Ms. L, and that transferring this case will cause some inconvenience to the States, \n13  the Court is confident that Judge Sabraw will examine those claims and take appropriate steps to \n14  mitigate any inconvenience.  Much remains to be done, and in the days and weeks ahead, the \n15  government must turn all of its efforts to locating and reuniting parents and children who have \n16  been separated and potentially harmed by this Policy.  Requiring the government to respond to \n17  multiple orders by multiple district courts would only stand in the way of these efforts and, this, \n18  the Court will not do.    \n19  Accordingly, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), the Court TRANSFERS this case to the \n20  Southern District of California, to be assigned to Judge Sabraw.   \n21   \n22   \n23   \n24 \n \nORDER GRANTING DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO TRANSFER VENUE - 4 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00939-MJP   Document 88   Filed 08/08/18   Page 5 of 5\n \n1  The clerk is ordered to provide copies of this order to all counsel.  \n2  Dated August 8, 2018. \n3   \n              A\n4 \n \n5                 Marsha J.
