Based on the law and facts presented in the Cross-Motions for Partial Summary Judgment (Doc. Nos. 263, 271), Plaintiffs have demonstrated that they are likely to succeed on the merits of parts of their claims and are likely to suffer irreparable injury in the absence of a preliminary injunction. The Court ORDERS that the Office of Refugee Resettlement (\"ORR\") its agents, employees, attorneys, and all those who are in active concert or participation with them, are preliminarily enjoined as described in this order. This injunction goes into effect 60 days from the date of entry of this Order. Consistent with the Court's 3/11/2022 Order, this Preliminary Injunction will remain in effect until final judgment is entered. See document for further details. (gk) (Entered: 08/30/2022)"

Plaintiff shall refile the redacted versions of these documents within three days of the date of this Order. (2) Plaintiff is granted leave to file under seal the unredacted versions of Exhibits 33-37, 4142, and 44 and the entirety of Exhibits 38 and 40, all of which are found at Docket Entry No. 32-1. Pursuant to Local Rule 79-5.2.2(c), Plaintiff shall efile these documents under seal within three days of the date of this Order. (3) Docket Entry No. 29-2 shall remain sealed.

Yet, Exhibit 43 is missing from Docket Entry Nos. 32-1 and 33.

Gee: On 3/25/2020, in light of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (\"COVID-19\") public health crisis, Plaintiffs filed an Ex Parte Application for a Temporary Restraining Order (\"TRO\") and an Order to Show Cause (\"OSC\") why a preliminary injunction should not issue, arguing that the members of the unfit custodian class should be immediately released unless Defendants can justify keeping them in ORR facilities 227 . The Court held a hearing on the TRO application in conjunction with the hearing on a TRO application filed in the related case of Flores v. Barr, No. 85-4544-DMG (AGRx) (C.D. Cal.). On 3/28/2020, the Court granted in part the Flores Plaintiffs' ex parte application for a TRO (\"the Flores TRO\"). Having duly considered the parties written submissions and oral argument in light of the applicable legal standard for mandatory injunctive relief, and having issued the TRO in Flores that renders the most urgent portions of Plaintiffs' request for interim relief moot, the Court DENIES the Ex Parte Application and OSC re preliminary injunction.

          "description": "MINUTES OF IN CHAMBERS - ORDER RE SUPPLEMENTAL SUBMISSIONS, PRETRIAL DATES AND DEADLINES, AND JOINT STATUS REPORT by Judge Dolly M. Gee: On 12/22/2020, the Court held a hearing on the parties' cross-Motions for Summary Judgment and issued its tentative oral ruling regarding Plaintiffs' step-up class, unfit custodian class, and legal representation class claims 263, 271 . In light of the matters discussed at the hearing, the Court hereby ORDERS: (1) By 1/5/2021, the parties shall file a joint supplemental submission with the current version of the form Notice of Placement (\"NOP\") given to minors stepped-up to more restrictive placements, to be filed publicly. (2) By 1/5/2021, Plaintiffs shall file a supplemental submission describing any incidents where a stepped-up minor was incorrectly found to be a danger to self or others that occurred after the Court's Order in Flores v. Sessions, No. CV 85-4544-DMG (AGRx), 2018 WL 10162328 (C.D. Cal. July 30, 2018). (3) Because the parties have another mediation scheduled for 1/11/2021, and the parties' current pretrial and trial dates and deadlines are infeasible, all scheduled dates are VACATED. (4) The parties shall meet and confer regarding their claims in light of the Court's tentative oral ruling and submit a Joint Status Report on the status of those meetings by 2/1/2021. (5) A written order on the pending motions shall issue, if necessary, after the Joint Status Report is filed. Court Reporter: Not Reported. (gk) (Entered: 12/23/2020)"

    "summary": "<p>This class action suit, filed on June 29, 2018, sought to enjoin the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), of which ORR is a component part, from causing grave harm to migrant and asylum-seeking children in its care. 2018 WL 3209193. The plaintiffs--represented by the Center for Human Rights &amp; Constitutional Law, National Center for Youth Law, the Immigration Law Clinic at the UC Davis Law School, and private counsel--were members of the class protected under the consent decree issued in <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=9493\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Flores v. Reno</em></a> (&ldquo;Flores Settlement&rdquo;), available here in the Clearinghouse. The plaintiffs alleged violations of that Settlement, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1101, William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA) 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1589, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) 5 U.S.C. &sect; 703, as well as the Fifth Amendment&rsquo;s Due Process Clause and First Amendment&rsquo;s Freedom of Association Clause. They sued the Secretary of HHS and the Director of ORR under 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1331, 2241, the APA, <em>Bivens</em>, the TVPRA, and the rights conferred to the plaintiffs in the Flores Settlement. They sought injunctive and declaratory relief, a writ of habeas corpus for their release from ORR custody, nominal damages, and attorneys&rsquo; fees. The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California and assigned to Judge Dolly Maizie Gee.</p>\r\n<p>The named plaintiffs were several children in ORR custody (in facilities in Texas, California, New York, and Michigan) and two nonprofit organizations, the San Fernando Valley Refugee Children Center, Inc. and the Unaccompanied Central American Refugee Empowerment. The plaintiffs alleged that ORR confined unaccompanied children in residential treatment centers (RTCs) without a meaningful opportunity to challenge allegations that they were dangerous or posed a flight risk or that their parents or other custodians were unfit to care for them. The complaint also stated that the children were detained in conditions where they were administered psychotropic medication for weeks, months, or longer without parental consent or any other procedural safeguards. Several children were reportedly prescribed medications that increased suicidality, intentional self harm, pain, nausea, insomnia, and other symptoms in children. One of the children alleged they were assaulted by staff on multiple occasions, including with pepper spray, but that no disciplinary action was taken.</p>\r\n<p>The four proposed classes included all children in ORR custody (a) whom ORR refused to release to their parents or other available custodians who completed family reunification packets but were allegedly unfit, (b) who had been or would be in an RTC or other facility for more than 30 days without notice and an opportunity to be heard regarding release, (c) who had been or would be administered psychotropic medication without procedural safeguards (e.g., parental consent), and (d) who were natives of non-contiguous countries and to whom ORR blocks legal assistance in matters related to their custody, medication, and release.</p>\r\n<p>On July 9, 2018, Judge Gee granted the plaintiffs leave to use pseudonyms for the named plaintiffs and their next friends (i.e., family members, custodians, or sponsors), who sued on their behalf, and ordered the parties to use these pseudonyms in all documents filed with the court. The court subsequently granted leave to both parties to file documents under seal in order to protect the identities of the minors.</p>\r\n<p>On August 2, 2018, the plaintiffs moved to certify the classes. On August 3, 2018, one named plaintiff detained in a southern Texas facility, moved for a preliminary injunction for his release from ORR custody &ldquo;without unnecessary delay&rdquo; as provided by the <em>Flores</em> Settlement and the TVPRA. On August 17, 2018, another named plaintiff detained in a southern Texas facility similarly moved for a preliminary injunction for her release.</p>\r\n<p>On August 17, 2018, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for improper venue and for failure to state a claim for which the court can grant relief. The defendants argued that this lawsuit was duplicative of the <em>Flores</em> litigation, and claimed that the plaintiffs were trying to rewrite or re-bargain that settlement by bringing this case.</p>\r\n<p>On September 6 and 10, 2018, the court denied both preliminary injunction motions for lack of jurisdiction. 2018 WL 10483438. In both cases, the court found that the cited sections of the <em>Flores</em> Settlement and the APA did not authorize the court to order the release of the minors. The motions were dismissed without prejudice, indicating that they could refile in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas against the ORR Field Specialists in Texas responsible for the minors&rsquo; care. Judge Gee found that habeas matters would be properly venued before those specialists in that court if the plaintiffs were to refile.</p>\r\n<p>On September 7, 2018, the plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint, which included two more named plaintiffs and additional detail concerning the original complaint's named plaintiffs&rsquo; mental health, including hospitalization due to their extreme distress at not being released to their families. 2018 WL 8803996. It also described fundraising and other community efforts made in preparation of the children&rsquo;s release.</p>\r\n<p>On September 10, 2018, Judge Gee denied the defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss as moot because the plaintiff&rsquo;s amended complaint was treated as superseding the first. In the same order, she denied the plaintiff&rsquo;s motion for class certification without prejudice, reasoning that it would be more efficient to decide on that motion at a later date, because it was anticipated that the defendants would again move to have the case dismissed.</p>\r\n<p>On September 18, 2018, the defendants did again move to have the complaint dismissed for improper venue and failure to state a claim. On September 28, 2018, the defendants supplemented their motion to dismiss, requesting that the case be transferred to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia if it were not dismissed.</p>\r\n<p>Also on September 28, 2018, the plaintiffs again moved to certify the classes. These first four class definitions were the same as those in their August motion for class certification; the new motion added one more class, including only children who had or would have a behavioral, mental health, or intellectual and/or developmental disability and who were placed in an ORR facility because of that disability.</p>\r\n<p>On November 2, 2018, Judge Gee issued an order granting in part and denying in part the defendants' motion to dismiss and granting the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. 2018 WL 10111336. The defendants' motion to dismiss was granted only with regard to the plaintiffs' claims to enforce the <em>Flores</em> Agreement, but was denied in all other respects, including the plaintiffs' claims that \"ORR failed to provide sufficient procedural safeguards for alien minors to exercise their <em>Flores</em> rights.\" In the order granting the plaintiffs' motion for class certification, Judge Gee certified each of the proposed classes but slightly re-wrote the definitions of some classes.</p>\r\n<p>On November 16, 2018, the defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the court's November 2 order, asserting that in re-writing the definitions of certain classes, the court failed to consider material facts and denied defendants the opportunity to address the newly created class. On December 27, 2018, Judge Gee issued an order granting in part and denying in part the defendants' motion for reconsideration and simultaneously issued an amended version of the November 2 order. 2018 WL 7200716 and 2018 WL 10483527. The amended order made a slight change to the \"disability class\" (described below) to reflect the defendants' concern with the class definition.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The court approved 5 classes, encompassing: &ldquo;all minors in ORR custody pursuant to 6 U.S.C. section 279 and/or 8 U.S.C. section 1232:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>a. who are or will be placed in a secure facility, medium-secure facility, or RTC, or whom ORR has continued to detain in any such facility for more than 30 days, without being afforded notice and an opportunity to be heard before a neutral and detached decisionmaker regarding the grounds for such placement (i.e., the &ldquo;step-up class&rdquo;);</p>\r\n<p>b. whom ORR is refusing or will refuse to release to parents or other available custodians within 30 days of the proposed custodian&rsquo;s submission of a complete family reunification packet on the ground that the proposed custodian is or may be unfit (i.e., the &ldquo;unfit custodian class&rdquo;);&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>c. who are or will be prescribed or administered one or more psychotropic medications without procedural safeguards;</p>\r\n<p>d. who are natives of non-contiguous countries and to whom ORR is impeding or will impede legal assistance in legal matters or proceedings involving their custody, placement, release, and/or administration of psychotropic drugs (i.e., the &ldquo;legal representation class&rdquo;); and</p>\r\n<p>e. who have or will have a behavioral, mental health, intellectual, and/or developmental disability as defined in 29 U.S.C. section 705, and who are or will be placed in a secure facility, medium-secure facility, or RTC solely by reason of such disabilities (i.e., the &ldquo;disability class&rdquo;).&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>On March 2, 2019, defendant E. Scott Lloyd -- the former Director of ORR who was also sued in his individual capacity under <em>Bivens</em> -- filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' complaint and action against him for lack of personal jurisdiction and a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The defendant asserted that the complaint did not establish that the court had personal jurisdiction over him, failed to give notice of the claims against him, failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted against him, and failed to defeat his qualified immunity.</p>\r\n<p>On April 23, 2019, following the parties' stipulation for mediation, Judge Gee issued an order referring the matter to Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym for mediation proceedings. Over the next several months, the parties underwent the discovery process and conferred to attempt to reach a settlement.</p>\r\n<p>On August 21, 2019, Judge Gee issued an order granting Lloyd's motion for judgment on the pleadings, concluding that the plaintiffs' <em>Bivens</em> claim against him was not \"supported by a cognizable legal theory\" and because \"special factors counsel against recognizing such a remedy in this context.\" 2019 WL 6655262. As such, the individual defendant in his individual capacity was dismissed.</p>\r\n<p>On March 25, 2020, in light of the nationwide outbreak of COVID-19, the plaintiffs filed an <em>ex parte</em> application for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and for issuance of an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not be issued. The plaintiffs requested that the court issue an order \"requiring ORR to release children it has already detained for 30 days to ready custodians, transfer them to non-congregate settings, or else justify why it has done neither.\" At the time the application was filed, there were a reported 46,481 cases in the U.S. and 593 deaths and several staff members at ORR facilities had tested positive for COVID-19. No cure or vaccine existed at the time of filing so social distancing and frequent hand washing were the only effective measures to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. The plaintiffs contended that the \"vast majority of children in ORR custody live in congregate settings, where they spend all of their time in close proximity to other children and staff members\" and are thus unable to practice effective methods of preventing transmission. Moreover, while the elderly and those with underlying health conditions remained the most vulnerable to serious illness or death from COVID-19, the plaintiffs stated that \"approximately 6% of infected children and 11% of infected infants had severe or critical cases,\" demonstrating a risk of severe harm to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs urged that a TRO was appropriate because &ldquo;[t]he <em>Flores</em> Settlement, the TVPRA, and the First and Fifth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution each vest children who have custodians available to receive them with substantive rights against ORR&rsquo;s keeping them in congregate care, especially during a global pandemic.\"</p>\r\n<p>On March 27, 2020, the government filed an opposition to the plaintiffs' motion for TRO. The government asserted that if there was a claim that the <em>Flores</em> Settlement Agreement has been violated, that claim \"must proceed in a <em>Flores</em> enforcement action.\" The government also argued that the plaintiffs' due process claim lacked merit, proclaiming that they had \"gone to extraordinary lengths to care for children in a profoundly challenging situation, while also fulfilling its statutory mandate under the TVPRA for expeditious release of children to custodians who will care for them, implementing measures both to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and provide appropriate medical care in the case of infection.\" Finally, the government contended that, considering the risk posed by the proposed mass transit of plaintiffs and strained resources for administrative hearings caused by COVID-19, plaintiffs \"fail to show how their alleged injury would be redressed by the relief they seek.\"</p>\r\n<p>On March 28, 2020, Judge Gee issued a <a href=\"../../../../doc/105275/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TRO in <em>Flores v. Reno</em></a>, ordering the government to promptly adjudicate the class members' claims for release to outside sponsors and for the inspection of government facilities to ensure compliance with public health guidelines.</p>\r\n<p>Following oral argument on April 2, 2020, Judge Gee issued an order denying the plaintiffs' application for TRO and an order to show cause. Judge Gee concluded that the TRO issued in <em>Flores</em> rendered \"the most urgent portions of Plaintiffs&rsquo; request for interim relief moot,\" and thus a TRO here was not appropriate.</p>\r\n<p>On October 2, 2020, the defendants moved for partial summary judgment. They alleged that some of the claims were barred by <em>res judicata</em>, as the Court had already decided the issues in <em>Flores v. Reno</em>. The defendants further argued that, even if the claims were not barred, the policies and procedures implemented satisfied the judicial standards for procedural due process. The same day, the plaintiffs also moved for partial summary judgment on different claims. The plaintiffs argued that the defendants' non-compliance with the <em>Flores</em> Settlement Agreement violated their right to procedural due process, and required court intervention. The court held a hearing on this cross-motion for summary judgment on December 22, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>On March 11, 2022, Judge Gee issued an order granting in part and denying in part plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, as well as granting in part and denying in part defendants' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. 2022 WL 2177454. Judge Gee ordered:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Regarding the &ldquo;step-up class&rdquo;: Granted relief as to plaintiffs&rsquo; due process claim in part, requiring several specific actions of defendants, including providing specific criteria for and employing a &ldquo;clear and convincing&rdquo; evidentiary standard deciding when minors may be transferred. Issued judgment in defendants&rsquo; favor on the TVPRA/APA claim.</li>\r\n<li>Regarding the &ldquo;unfit custodian class&rdquo;: Granted relief as to plaintiffs&rsquo; due process claim in part, requiring several specific actions of defendants, including ensuring written notice to denied sponsors and instating an automatic review of pending family reunification applications every 90 days. Issued judgment in defendants&rsquo; favor on the TVPRA/APA claim. Issued judgment against defendants&rsquo; First Amendment claim without prejudice.</li>\r\n<li>Regarding the &ldquo;legal representation class&rdquo;: Issued &ldquo;summary judgment to Defendants on Plaintiffs&rsquo; due process and TVPRA/APA claim that ORR must fund their legal representation in challenging ORR&rsquo;s administrative decisions.&rdquo; Granted relief as to plaintiffs&rsquo; due process claim in part, requiring several specific actions of defendants, including providing minors assistance of counsel and providing case files to legal representatives when requested. Issued judgment against &ldquo;the parties&rsquo; cross-summary judgment motions as to the remainder of the legal representation class&rsquo; claims that relate to access to counsel to challenge decisions regarding psychotropic drugs and whether ORR blocks counsel from representing minors in challenging ORR decisions.&rdquo;&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Judge Gee also ordered that the parties confer and submit a proposed preliminary injunction by April 1, 2022. The parties conferred several times but were unable to reach an agreed-upon proposed injunction, and on August 30, 2022, Judge Gee issued a preliminary injunction:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Regarding the &ldquo;step-up class&rdquo;: the injunction required that ORR issue a Notice Of Placement (NOP) within 48 hours after step-up to a restrictive placement, as well as every 30 days the minor remained in a restrictive placement, along with procedures for minors to contest placement before a Placement Review Panel and administrative review processes. &nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Regarding the &ldquo;unfit custodian class&rdquo;: the injunction established automatic reviews every 90 days for pending Family Reunification Applications, as well as procedures for providing written notice of denials and for appealing ORR decisions.</li>\r\n<li>Regarding the &ldquo;legal representation class&rdquo;: the injunction required that ORR serve a minor&rsquo;s NOP on counsel, permit minors assistance of counsel, and provide case files to a minor&rsquo;s counsel upon request.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>2022 WL 3908829. The preliminary injunction was slightly modified on September 27, 2022, editing the language of the procedure for the \"unfit custodian class.\"</p>\r\n<p>On November 14, 2023, the parties submitted a joint motion for settlement approval. After a fairness hearing, Judge Gee issued orders on May 3, 2024, granting a motion to modify the class certification by changing the lawyers representing the classes, granting a joint motion to appoint a monitor, and granting final approval of settlements for the plaintiffs&rsquo; 3rd, 4th, and 5th, claims, also noting that the parties &ldquo;shall meet and confer in good faith to attempt to settle attorneys' fees and costs.&rdquo; The settlement required ORR to implement policies and procedural protections regarding the administration of psychotropic medications, access to legal representation, and the placement and release of children with disabilities. Kathleen Noonan was selected to monitor the implementation of and compliance with these policies and procedures, and defendants agreed to submit compliance reports to Noonan every 6 months.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The agreement regarding psychotropic medications was to terminate six years after the effective date, or earlier if the defendants moved for early termination and were able to show continued compliance after three years from the effective date. The agreement regarding legal representation was to terminate three years after the effective date, unless Congressional action were to supersede the agreement prior to the termination date. The agreement regarding the placement and release of children with disabilities was to terminate five years after the effective date, or earlier if the defendants moved for early termination and were able to show continued compliance after two years from the implementation date.</p>\r\n<p>On March 12, 2024, because Magistrate Judge Pym was no longer available, the case was reassigned to Magistrate Judge Brianna Fuller Mircheff.</p>\r\n<p>On May 14, 2024, the parties issued a joint notice, stating that they had met regarding the defendants&rsquo; anticipated motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction. The parties agreed that once the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families&rsquo; Foundational Rule (89 Fed. Reg. 34384, 34585 (Apr. 30, 2024)) went into effect, the preliminary injunction should be dissolved. At the time of the statement, the anticipated effective date of the Foundational Rule was July 1, 2024, and the parties planned to inform the court of the status of the implementation around July 1. On July 2, 2024, the parties filed a joint stipulation to dissolve the preliminary injunction, which Judge Gee then ordered dissolved on the same day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On July 12, 2024, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for mootness, and on July 26, 2024, the plaintiffs filed a motion for declaratory judgment on their due process claims (regarding determining custodial fitness and restrictive placement).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Following briefings on the matter, Judge Gee issued an order on the motion to dismiss and motion for declaratory judgment on September 16, 2024. First, the defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss was denied. Although commending the promulgation of the Foundational Rule, the court determined that because ORR was not a legislative body, the rule&rsquo;s &ldquo;permanence&rdquo; was not guaranteed. Considering 46 senators had then introduced a joint resolution pursuant to the Congressional Review Act (&ldquo;CRA&rdquo;) to undo the Foundational Rule, the court determined that it was not &ldquo;absolutely clear&rdquo; that there was no reasonable expectation of recurrence of injuries to the plaintiffs. As such, the court granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for declaratory judgment given the need to &ldquo;afford relief from the uncertainty, insecurity, and controversy giving rise to the proceeding&rdquo;&mdash;the plaintiffs would find themselves and their rights back at square one in the absence of the Rule or the Court&rsquo;s now-dissolved preliminary injunction. Final judgment was subsequently entered in favor of the plaintiffs and the action was dismissed on the merits. 2024 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 167645.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Following the entry of a final judgment in their favor, the plaintiffs filed a motion to recuperate attorney&rsquo;s fees and other expenses under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) on December 13, 2024. A hearing on the matter was initially scheduled for May 9, 2025; however, this was opposed by the defendants who sought to continue the hearing until July 11, 2025. As of February 2025, the case remains ongoing as (a) the court determines when the hearing ought to be held and (b) the parties continue briefings on the issue of attorney&rsquo;s fees.&nbsp;</p>",

    "summary_short": "In June 2018, unaccompanied immigrant children in the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) custody sued ORR and HHS, of which it is a component agency, in District Court for the Central District of California. Plaintiffs alleged Due Process and Flores Settlement violations due to their continued detainment in ORR custody even though they had parents or other custodians available to receive them, and because ORR administered psychotropic drugs on them without parental consent. In September 2018, the court denied preliminary injunctions for two of the named plaintiffs detained in southern Texas ORR facilities for lack of jurisdiction. The court found that their habeas petitions were properly venued in the Southern District of Texas against the ORR Field Specialists responsible for their care if the plaintiffs were to refile. In November 2018 the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification and denied most of the defendants' motion to dismiss, granting the motion only with regard to the plaintiffs' claims to enforce the Flores Agreement. The parties have been undergoing discovery and settlement negotiations since 2019 but have not yet reached an agreement. In March 2020, during the nationwide outbreak of COVID-19, the plaintiffs requested an order requiring ORR to release children it has already detained for 30 days or transfer them to non-congregate settings; the court denied this request in early April. On March 11, 2022, Judge Gee partially granted and denied both parties' motions for summary judgment, ordering specific actions for the ORR to enhance procedural due process for different classifications of minors in its custody. On August 30, 2022, she issued a preliminary injunction, later slightly modified, mandating the ORR to enact notifications, reviews, and access to counsel according to the laid out terms. By May 3, 2024, following a mutual proposal for settlement, Judge Gee granted the final approval for the settlement of several claims, appointed a monitor to oversee compliance, and outlined terms for future oversight and potential early termination of the agreements. \r\n\r\nIn light of new foundational rules from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families July 2024, the preliminary injunction was dissolved on July 2, 2024. On July 12, 2024, the defendants then filed a motion to dismiss considering the promulgation of the Foundational Rule and on July 26, 2024, the plaintiffs filed a motion for declaratory judgment. The court denied the defendants’ motion considering the ability for Congress to undo the Foundational Rule. The court, thus, granted the plaintiffs’ motion for declaratory relief and entered a final judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on September 16, 2024. The case remains ongoing as the plaintiffs seek to be awarded attorney’s fees and other costs.",

[Doc. ## 440 (“Defs.’ MTD”), 441 (“Pls.’ Notice of MDJ”).]  Both sides \n24 also move for entry of final judgment in this action.  The motions are fully briefed.  \n25 [Doc. ## 442 (“Pls.’ MDJ & MTD Opp.”), 444 (“Defs.’ MTD Reply & MDJ Opp.”), \n26 445 (“Pls.’ MDJ Reply”).]  The Court held a hearing on September 13, 2024.  For the \n27 reasons set forth below, the Court DENIES Defendants’ MTD, GRANTS Plaintiffs’ \n28 MDJ, and enters final judgment. \n-1- \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-BFM     Document 447     Filed 09/16/24     Page 2 of 8   Page ID\n#:20770\n \nI. \n1\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND1 \n2\n3 Class members are unaccompanied non-citizen minors detained by the Office of \n4 Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”) of the Department of Health and Human Services \n5 (“HHS”).  The class members in this action are also class members in the related action, \n6 Flores v. Garland, No. CV 85-4544-DMG (AGRx) (C.D. Cal.).  In this action, the class \n7 challenged ORR’s policies and practices concerning:  (1) the placement of children in \n8 restrictive facilities without adequate notice (the “step-up” claim), (2) the refusal to \n9 release children to family members because the family member was allegedly “unfit” \n10 (the “unfit custodian” claim), (3) the administration of psychotropic medication to \n11 children  without  sufficient  procedural  safeguards  (the  “psychotropic  medications” \n12 claim), (4) the interference with children’s ability to obtain legal assistance with respect \n13 to their custody, placement, and release (the “legal representation” claim), and (5) the \n14 placement of children in restrictive facilities solely because of their disabilities (the \n15 “disability” claim). \n16 On March 11, 2022, the Court granted in part and denied in part the parties’ \n17 cross-motions for summary judgment (“MSJ”).  [Doc. # 376 (“MSJ Order”).]  In doing \n18 so,  the  Court  granted  partial  summary  judgment  to  Plaintiffs  on  the  due  process \n19 allegations of the Step-Up and Unfit Custodian classes and partial summary judgment \n20 to Defendants on the TVPRA2/APA allegations of the same classes.  On August 30, \n21 2022, the Court issued a preliminary injunction to effectuate the MSJ Order.  [Doc. # \n22 391 (“PI”).] \n23\n24  \n1 A detailed discussion of the factual and procedural background in this matter up until \n25 summary judgment is included in the Court’s March 11, 2022 Summary Judgment Order, and is \nincorporated herein by this reference.  [Doc. # 376 (“Ord. re MSJs”).]  The Court will therefore \n26\nprovide only an abbreviated version of the background here. \n27  \n2 William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, Pub. L. \n28 No. 110-457 (codified in principal part at 8 U.S.C. § 1232). \n-2- \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-BFM     Document 447     Filed 09/16/24     Page 3 of 8   Page ID\n#:20771\n \n1 In November 2023, the parties informed the Court that they had reached a partial \n2 settlement and moved for preliminary approval of the settlements on Plaintiffs’ third, \n3 fourth, and fifth claims.  [Doc. # 408 (“MPA”).]  The Court entered final approval of \n4 the settlements on May 3, 2024 and dismissed Plaintiffs’ third, fourth, and fifth claims \n5 for relief.  [Doc. # 433.]  The Court did not enter final judgment on those claims, \n6 however, because the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure disfavor the entry of partial \n7 judgment in an action when all claims have not yet been resolved.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. \n8 54(b). \n9 HHS promulgated the Unaccompanied Children Program Foundational Rule \n10 (“Foundational Rule” or “Rule”) in April 2024, and the Rule went into effect on July \n11 1, 2024.  See 89 Fed. Reg. 34,384 (promulgated April 30, 2024) (codified at 45 C.F.R. \n12 pt. 410).  On July 2, 2024, the parties filed, and the Court approved, a Joint Stipulation \n13 to  dissolve  the  Court’s  August  2022  PI,  based  on  the  fact  that  the  Rule  fully \n14 implemented the terms of the Court’s PI.  [Doc. # 438.] \n15 Defendants now move to dismiss Plaintiffs’ remaining two claims, arguing that \n16 they have been rendered moot by the Foundational Rule.  Plaintiffs oppose the motion \n17 to dismiss and request that the Court enter a declaratory judgment incorporating its \n18 March 2022 summary judgment order. \n19\nII. \n20 LEGAL STANDARDS \n21 A.  Mootness \n22 A claim becomes moot if it has been remedied independent of the court.  See \n23 Genesis Healthcare Corp. v. Symczyk, 569 U.S. 66, 72 (2013).  Nonetheless, “[i]t is \n24 well settled that ‘a defendant’s voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not \n25 deprive a federal court of its power to determine the legality of the practice.’”  Friends \n26 of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Env’t Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189 (2000) \n27 (quoting City of Mesquite v. Aladdin’s Castle, Inc., 455 U.S. 283, 289 (1982)).  For \n28 voluntary  cessation  to  moot  a  case,  the  defendant  arguing  mootness  “bears  [a] \n-3- \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-BFM     Document 447     Filed 09/16/24     Page 4 of 8   Page ID\n#:20772\n \n1 formidable  burden  of  showing  that  it  is  absolutely  clear  the  allegedly  wrongful \n2 behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.”  Id. at 190 (emphasis added).  The \n3 defendant arguing mootness also must show that “any effects of the alleged violation \n4 must be permanently reversed.”  Health Freedom Def. Fund, Inc. v. Carvalho, 104 \n5 F.4th 715, 722 (9th Cir. 2024) (citing Los Angeles County v. Davis, 440 U.S. 625, 631 \n6 (1979)).  Further, this “formidable burden” “holds for governmental defendants no less \n7 than for private ones.”  Id. (quoting FBI v. Fikre, 601 U.S. 234, 241 (2024)). \n8 B.  Declaratory Relief \n9 Under the Declaratory Judgment Act, courts may only grant declaratory relief to \n10 resolve a “case of actual controversy” between interested parties.  28 U.S.C. § 2201(a).  \n11 That phrase refers to the “type of ‘Cases’ and ‘Controversies’ that are justiciable under \n12 Article III.”  See MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U.S. 118, 127 (2007). \n13 Even  when  a  plaintiff  alleges  sufficient  facts  to  establish  a  justiciable \n14 controversy,  courts  have  the  discretion  to  determine  whether  declaratory  relief  is \n15 necessary or proper.  See 28 U.S.C. 2201; Huth v. Hartford Ins. Co., 298 F.3d 800, 802 \n16 (9th Cir. 2002) (“The exercise of jurisdiction under the Federal Declaratory Judgment \n17 Act  .  .  .  is  committed  to  the  sound  discretion  of  the  federal  district  courts.”).  \n18 Declaratory relief may be appropriate where:  (1) “the judgment will serve a useful \n19 purpose in clarifying and settling the legal relations in issue, and (2) when it will \n20 terminate and afford relief from the uncertainty, insecurity, and controversy giving rise \n21 to the proceeding.”  Guerra v. Sutton, 783 F.2d 1371, 1376 (9th Cir. 1986) (citation \n22 and internal quotation marks omitted).  Although Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 57 \n23 states that “the existence of another adequate remedy does not preclude a declaratory \n24 judgment,” “the availability of other adequate remedies may make declaratory relief \n25 inappropriate[.]”    Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  57;  United  Safeguard  Distribs.  Ass’n,  Inc.  v. \n26 Safeguard Bus. Sys., Inc., 145 F. Supp. 3d 932, 960–61 (C.D. Cal. 2015). \n   \n27\n28\n-4- \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-BFM     Document 447     Filed 09/16/24     Page 5 of 8   Page ID\n#:20773\n \nIII. \n1\nDISCUSSION \n2\nA.  Mootness \n3\nAs a preliminary matter, the Court must address Defendants’ contention that they \n4\nare entitled to a “presumption of mootness” pursuant to the Ninth Circuit’s decision in \n5\nBoard of Trustees of Glazing Health & Welfare Trust v. Chambers.  See 941 F.3d 1195, \n6\n1199 (9th Cir. 2019).  In Glazing, the court distinguished between voluntary cessations \n7\nby private parties and legislative bodies, concluding that while voluntary cessations by \n8\nprivate parties were unlikely to render a case moot, voluntary cessations by legislative \n9\nbodies—via passage of legislation—are entitled to a “presumption of mootness.”  Id.  \n10\nHere, Defendants argue that they—via implementation of the Foundational Rule—are \n11\nentitled to a presumption of mootness on Plaintiffs’ first two claims and that Plaintiffs \n12\ntherefore bear the burden of overcoming that presumption.  Defs.’ MTD at 19.3 \n13\nThis argument fails for two reasons.  First, ORR, the agency responsible for the \n14\nFoundational Rule, is not a “legislative body.”  See Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 \n15\nU.S. 185, 213 (1976) (“The rulemaking power granted to an administrative agency . . . \n16\nis not the power to make law.”).  Second, Glazing was decided prior to the Supreme \n17\nCourt’s decision in Fikre, where the Court explained that “governmental defendants” \n18\nbear the same “formidable burden” as private defendants when attempting to prove \n19\nmootness.  See Fikre, 601 U.S. at 241.  Although the Supreme Court did not address \n20\nGlazing in its Fikre decision, there is at least some tension between the two opinions.  \n21\nSee  Chang  v.  Cnty  of  Siskiyou,  ---  F.  Supp.  3d  ---  (E.D.  Cal.  Aug.  21,  2024).  \n22\nNonetheless, to the extent the Court must resolve this tension in order to reach a \n23\ndecision here, the Court finds it possible to harmonize the two by interpreting Glazing \n24\nto apply to legislative bodies (e.g., state legislatures, Congress) and Fikre to apply to \n25\nother government entities (e.g., executive or agency action)—but in both instances, the \n26\noverarching  consideration  is  whether  there  is  a  reasonable  expectation  that  the \n27\n \n28 3 Page citations herein refer to the page numbers inserted by the CM/ECF system. \n-5- \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-BFM     Document 447     Filed 09/16/24     Page 6 of 8   Page ID\n#:20774\n \n1 challenged action or conduct or something similar will not recur.  Defendants are not \n2 entitled to a presumption of mootness under the circumstances of this case, where the \n3 regulation has been in place for little more than two months and already there has been \n4 an effort on the part of some members of Congress to undermine it. \n5    Without a presumption of mootness, Defendants are unable to overcome their \n6 “formidable” burden because it is not clear that “[all] effects of the alleged violation[s] \n7 [are] permanently reversed.”  See Health Freedom, 104 F.4th at 722 (emphasis added).  \n8 Although the Court commends Defendants on the promulgation of the Foundational \n9 Rule, it is nonetheless true that the Rule’s “permanence” is not guaranteed at this time.  \n10 See Pls.’ MDJ Reply at 8.  The Court assumes the Government has “act[ed] in good \n11 faith,”  but  through  no  fault  of  Defendants’,  46  senators  have  introduced  a  joint \n12 resolution  pursuant  to  the  Congressional  Review  Act  (“CRA”)  providing  for \n13 congressional disapproval of the Foundational Rule. See Rosebrock v. Mathis, 745 F.3d \n14 963, 974 (9th Cir. 2014).  Although Defendants attempt to downplay the significance \n15 of the CRA, if the CRA joint disapproval were approved by both houses of Congress \n16 and signed by the President, the Rule could be wholly terminated or prevented from \n17 being given its full effect.  See 5 U.S.C. § 802.  If this occurred after the Court’s \n18 dismissal of Plaintiffs’ first two claims, minors in ORR custody would be left without \n19 the important protections they recently obtained in this case.4  Thus, with the CRA \n20 resolution pending, the Court cannot conclude that it is “absolutely clear” that there is \n21 no reasonable expectation of recurrence.   \n22   In light of the foregoing, the Court DENIES Defendants’ MTD. \n23\n \n4  The  Court  employed  a  similar  reasoning  in  its  recent  Flores  decision  conditionally \n24\nterminating the Flores Settlement Agreement (“FSA”) as to HHS, in light of the Foundational Rule:  \n25 “If  the  Court  relinquishes  jurisdiction  over  HHS  due  to  the  Foundational  Rule  and  Congress \nsubsequently enacts this joint resolution, Flores class members in ORR custody could be left without \n26\nany protections—which would be contrary to the terms of the FSA.  The Court’s termination of the \n27 FSA as to HHS is therefore conditional on there not being a recission of those regulations, such as \nthe Foundational Rule, in a manner inconsistent with the FSA.”  Flores v. Garland,  No. CV 85-4544-\n28 DMG (AGRx), 2024 WL 3467715 at *9 (C.D. Cal. June 28, 2024). \n-6- \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-BFM     Document 447     Filed 09/16/24     Page 7 of 8   Page ID\n#:20775\n \n1 B.  Declaratory Relief \n2 Because the Court does not find Plaintiffs’ first two claims to have been rendered \n3 moot by the Foundational Rule, it is within the Court’s discretion whether to grant \n4 declaratory relief to Plaintiffs.  See Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 95 (1968) (explaining \n5 that declaratory relief is inappropriate for moot issues).  Plaintiffs admit that so long as \n6 the Foundational Rule is in place, their requested declaratory relief would function as \n7 little more than backup in ensuring children in ORR custody are afforded the rights to \n8 which they are entitled.  Pls.’ MDJ & MTD Opp. at 24–25.  Because the Rule could be \n9 terminated or weakened—via the proposed CRA resolution or otherwise—declaratory \n10 judgment would “serve a useful purpose in clarifying and settling the legal relations in \n11 issue.”  See Guerra, 783 F.2d at 1376.  The Foundational Rule is an impressive \n12 achievement by all parties in this action and the Flores action, and it will hopefully \n13 provide critical protections to non-citizen children for generations to come.  It is \n14 nonetheless  true  that  in  the  absence  of  the  Rule  or  the  Court’s  now-dissolved \n15 preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs would once again find themselves and their rights \n16 back at square one, and Defendants could land back in court in the future, re-litigating \n17 many of the same issues.  Given the past six years of hard-fought litigation, that would \n18 be  an  undesirable  result.  The  Court  therefore  concludes  that  declaratory  relief  is \n19 appropriate  here  in  order  to  “afford  relief  from  the  uncertainty,  insecurity,  and \n20 controversy giving rise to the proceeding.”  See id; see also Rosebrock, 745 F.3d at 974 \n21 (describing  the  potential  utility  of  a  declaratory  judgment  if  the  “objectionable \n22 conduct” could recur in the future, but denying injunctive relief for mootness). \n23 The  Court  GRANTS  Plaintiffs’  motion  for  declaratory  judgment,  which \n24 amounts to nothing more than memorializing in a final judgment what the Court \n25 already articulated in its MSJ Order. \n   \n26\n27\n28\n-7- \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-BFM     Document 447     Filed 09/16/24     Page 8 of 8   Page ID\n#:20776\n1 C. Final Judgment \n2 All claims in this action have now been resolved—claims one and two through \n3 summary judgment and claims three, four, and five through settlement.  It is now \n4 appropriate to enter a final judgment to resolve this action. \n5\nIV. \n6 CONCLUSION \n7 In light of the foregoing, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ first and \n8 second claims for relief is DENIED, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Declaratory Judgment \n9 regarding their first and second claims for relief is GRANTED, and the Court will \n10 enter final judgment in this action consistent with the following: \n11\n1. In entering final judgment, the Court hereby INCORPORATES its findings and \n12\nlegal conclusions in the MSJ Order entered March 11, 2022, with respect to \n13\nPlaintiffs’ first claim for relief on behalf of the “unfit custodian class” and second \n14\nclaim for relief on behalf of the “step-up class.”  See MSJ Order [Doc. # 376].\n15\n2. Regarding Plaintiffs’ “psychotropic medications,” “legal representation,” and \n16\n“disability” claims, as provided in the Parties’ Agreements and approved by the \n17\nCourt on May 3, 2024, “the Court will retain jurisdiction over its judgment and \n18\n[Approval  Order]  only  for  the  purposes  of  interpreting  and  enforcing  the \n19\nAgreements until the Termination Dates, as set forth in the Agreements.”  See \n20\nApproval Order at 3 [Doc. # 433]. \n21\nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n22\n23\nDATED:  September 16, 2024    _____________________________________ \n24\n            DOLLY M.

Barr, No. CV85-\n17 4454-DMG (C.D. Cal.), as currently in effect, requires that licensed programs \n18 “comply with all applicable state child welfare laws and regulations. . .”; \n19 WHEREAS on July 30, 2018, the District Court ordered “Defendants to comply \n20 with all Texas child welfare laws and regulations governing the administration of \n21 psychotropic drugs to Class Members at Shiloh RTC” (July 30, 2018 Order at 23); \n22 WHEREAS the Parties agree: (a) that Psychotropic Medications should be used \n23 to treat psychiatric conditions only following a diagnostic assessment by a licensed \n24 healthcare provider and considering other situational factors that may be contributing \n25 to the condition (i.e., trauma); (b) that Psychotropic Medications should be aligned \n26 with the child’s diagnosis (i.e., the medication is appropriately used on- or off-label to \n27 treat the child’s specific diagnosis and not used due to other therapies being \n28 inconvenient or more expensive, recognizing that payment systems may utilize \n4\nSTIPULATED SETTLEMENT\nCASE NO.2:18-CV-05741DMGPLA\nExhibit A \nPage 5\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 408-3   Filed 11/14/23   Page 6 of 48   Page ID\n#:20028\n1 formularies); (c) that Psychotropic Medications should be administered only in \n2 accordance with a licensed prescriber’s recommendation based upon the minor’s \n3 symptoms and periodically reassessed by a licensed prescriber for side-effects and \n4 benefits; (d) that recognizing that Psychotropic Medications may be prescribed off-\n5 label, Psychotropic Medications should be administered at dosages that do not exceed \n6 dosing guidelines that recommend a specific dose based upon age and weight where \n7 dosing guidelines are available; and (e) that Psychotropic Medications shall never be \n8 used as punishment for disruptive or inappropriate behavior, for the convenience of \n9 staff members or caregivers, or as a substitute for adequate staffing and/or adequate \n10 ongoing programming for a child’s needs; \n11 WHEREAS the Parties have conducted discussions and negotiations in good \n12 faith with respect to a compromise and resolution of Plaintiffs’ Third Claim for Relief \n13 in the operative First Amended Complaint [ECF No. 81], and to resolve \n14 disagreements regarding compliance with the District Court’s July 30, 2018 Order in \n15 Flores v. Barr, with a view to settling the issues in dispute and achieving the most \n16 effective relief possible consistent with the interests of the Parties; \n17 WHEREAS had the case gone to trial, a decision of the District Court may be \n18 subject to appeal by the losing Party with the final outcome uncertain; \n19 WHEREAS the Parties have concluded that the terms and conditions of this \n20 Settlement are fair, reasonable, and in the best interests of all Class Members, after \n21 considering the substantial benefits that the Parties will receive from settlement of \n22 Plaintiffs’ Third Claim for Relief; and\n23 NOW, THEREFORE, in settlement of Plaintiffs’ Third Claim for Relief and in \n24 consideration of the promises and undertakings set forth herein and other \n25 consideration, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, it is hereby \n26 AGREED, by and among the Parties to this Settlement, through their respective \n27 attorneys, subject to the approval of the Court pursuant to Rule 23(e) of the Federal \n28 Rules of Civil Procedure, in consideration of the benefits flowing to the Parties hereto \n5\nSTIPULATED SETTLEMENT\nCASE NO.2:18-CV-05741DMGPLA\nExhibit A \nPage 6\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 408-3   Filed 11/14/23   Page 7 of 48   Page ID\n#:20029\n1 from the Settlement, that Plaintiffs’ Third Claim for Relief shall be settled upon and \n2 subject to the following terms and conditions:\n3 I. DEFINITIONS\n4 Wherever used in this Agreement, the following terms have the meanings set \n5 forth below:\n6 A. “Authorized Consenter” means either a “Primary Consenter,” “Sponsor \n7 Consenter” or “UC Consenter.”\n8 B. “Care Provider” means any care provider for UCs in ORR legal custody.  \n9 This includes ORR funded programs that are licensed, certified, or \n10 accredited by an appropriate State agency to provide residential care for \n11 children, including shelter, group, foster care, staff-secure, secure, \n12 therapeutic, or residential treatment care for children.  It also includes influx \n13 care facilities that care for children in ORR’s custody, out-of-network \n14 facilities, and formerly licensed programs that lost their licenses due to a \n15 state’s actions to exclude all ORR programs from state licensing. \n16 C. “Case Manager” means the care provider staff member who coordinates \n17 assessments of unaccompanied children, individual service plans, and efforts \n18 to release unaccompanied children from ORR custody.  Case Managers \n19 facilitate documentation of services for children and youth and maintain case \n20 files for unaccompanied children.  \n21 D. “Centralized Concurrence Unit” or “CCU” means an entity under an \n22 agreement (for instance, a contract or grant) with the U.S. Department of \n23 Health and Human Services that will undertake the responsibilities set forth \n24 in Section VIII below.  However, ORR may rely on a psychiatrist within its \n25 Division of Health for Unaccompanied Children (“DHUC”) to act as the \n26 CCU.  \n27 E. “Class” or “Class Members” includes “all minors in ORR custody pursuant \n28 to 6 U.S.C. section 279 and/or 8 U.S.C. section 1232 . . . who are or will be \n6\nSTIPULATED SETTLEMENT\nCASE NO.2:18-CV-05741DMGPLA\nExhibit A \nPage 7\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 408-3   Filed 11/14/23   Page 8 of 48   Page ID\n#:20030\n1 prescribed or administered one or more psychotropic medications without \n2 procedural safeguards” [ECF No. 141 at 27-28].\n3 F. “Effective Date” is the date of final approval of the Agreement by the Court, \n4 in accordance with Section XII.A.1.\n5 G. “Legal Guardian” means a person who has the legal authority and duty to \n6 care for the UC.  Although ORR has both legal authority and duty to care for \n7 UCs within its care, when used in this Agreement the term “legal guardian” \n8 does not refer to ORR.  \n9 H. “Monitor” means Kathleen Noonan, whose appointment and role is \n10 governed by Section VII.\n11 I. “Office of Refugee Resettlement” or “ORR” means the U.S. Department of \n12 Health and Human Services (“HHS”), Administration for Children and \n13 Families, Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”).\n14 J. “Parent” means a child’s biological mother or father, as well as an individual \n15 recognized by a governmental entity as the child’s parent.\n16 K. “Party” or “Parties” means Defendants and Plaintiffs.\n17 L. “Plaintiff” or “Plaintiffs” means the named Plaintiffs and all Class Members \n18 as defined herein. \n19 M.“Primary Consenter” means a parent or legal guardian, whether residing in \n20 or outside the United States. \n21 N. “Primary Caregiver” means any person who was previously or currently is \n22 primarily entrusted with the child’s care and who lived with the child prior \n23 to ORR legal custody.\n24 O. “Psychotropic Medication” means a prescription medication that is \n25 prescribed for the treatment of symptoms of psychosis or another mental, \n26 emotional, or behavioral disorder and that is used to exercise an effect on the \n27 central nervous system to influence and modify behavior, cognition, or \n28 affective state.  The term includes the following categories: (A) psychomotor \n7\nSTIPULATED SETTLEMENT\nCASE NO.2:18-CV-05741DMGPLA\nExhibit A \nPage 8\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 408-3   Filed 11/14/23   Page 9 of 48   Page ID\n#:20031\n1 stimulants; (B) antidepressants; (C) antipsychotics or neuroleptics; \n2 (D) agents for control of mania or depression; (E) antianxiety agents; and \n3 (F) sedatives, hypnotics, or other sleep-promoting medications.  For \n4 purposes of this Agreement, the medications listed in the Texas Department \n5 of Health and Human Services document entitled “Classes of Medications \n6 Frequently Used for Psychiatric Indications,” linked below, as may be \n7 updated from time to time, or its successor publication, shall be considered \n8 the universe of Psychotropic Medications to which the terms of this \n9 Agreement apply:  https://hhs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/documents/doing-\n10 business-with-hhs/provider-portal/facilities-\n11 regulation/psychiatric/psychotropic-medications-consent-drug-list.pdf.  \n12 Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Parties will meet and confer on \n13 an annual basis to determine whether any newly FDA-approved medications \n14 should be added to the list of medications.\n15 P. “Residential Treatment Center” (“RTC”) is a sub-acute, time limited, \n16 interdisciplinary, psycho-educational, and therapeutic 24-hour-a-day \n17 structured program with community linkages, provided through non-\n18 coercive, coordinated, individualized care, specialized services, and \n19 interventions.  Residential treatment centers provide highly customized care \n20 and services to individuals following either a community-based placement or \n21 more intensive intervention, with the aim of moving individuals toward a \n22 stable, less intensive level of care or independence.  A child may only be \n23 placed in an RTC at the recommendation of a licensed psychiatrist or \n24 psychologist consulted by ORR for an unaccompanied child who poses a \n25 danger to self or others and does not require inpatient hospitalization.  All \n26 references to RTC in the Agreement include out-of-network RTCs.  \n27 Q. “Sponsor Consenter” means a potential, viable sponsor pending in the ORR \n28 UC Portal who bears the following relationship to the UC: (1) sibling \n8\nSTIPULATED SETTLEMENT\nCASE NO.2:18-CV-05741DMGPLA\nExhibit A \nPage 9\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 408-3   Filed 11/14/23   Page 10 of 48   Page ID\n#:20032\n1 (including half-siblings and step-siblings if there is an adoption relationship \n2 by the parent(s)); (2) grandparent; or (3) aunt or uncle (including \n3 aunts/uncles through legal marriage), or first cousin, but only if such \n4 aunt/uncle/first cousin previously served as the UC’s primary caregiver. \n5 R. “Substantial Compliance” is when ORR has satisfied the intended purpose \n6 of the Agreement through the process outlined in Sections VII.C.4 and \n7 XII.D.1.  The Parties recognize that strict and literal compliance with every \n8 term of the Agreement is not required for a finding of Substantial \n9 Compliance as long as any deviations are unintentional and do not \n10 substantially defeat the purpose of the Agreement.  Substantial Compliance \n11 is not vitiated by a few technical violations where every reasonable effort \n12 has been made to comply.  \n13 S. “UC Consenter” means a UC, age 16 or 17, from whom a doctor has \n14 obtained informed consent.  \n15 T. “Unaccompanied Child” or “UC” means a minor as defined in 6 U.S.C. § \n16 279(g)(2) who is in the legal custody of the U.S. Department of Health and \n17 Human Services under the authority of 8 U.S.C. §§ 1232(b) and (c), and \n18 excludes any minor placed or receiving services in an \n19 Unaccompanied Refugee Minor program, under section 412(d) of \n20 the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. § 1522(d)). \n21 II. AUTHORIZED CONSENT/CONCURRENCE\n22 A. Consent Process.  This Agreement is intended to outline, at most, a two-step \n23 consent process, where the Care Provider first seeks consent from the \n24 identified Authorized Consenter, and then, where permitted, turns to the \n25 alternate process under Section II.C.\n26 B. Authorized Consenter\n27 1. Three categories of persons can serve as the Authorized Consenter \n28 and provide informed consent for the administration of Psychotropic \n9\nSTIPULATED SETTLEMENT\nCASE NO.2:18-CV-05741DMGPLA\nExhibit A \nPage 10\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 408-3   Filed 11/14/23   Page 11 of 48   Page ID\n#:20033\n1 Medication to UCs in ORR custody:  Primary Consenters, Sponsor \n2 Consenters, and UC Consenters. \n3 2. For all UCs prescribed one or more Psychotropic Medication(s), \n4 informed consent shall be sought from the child’s parent or legal \n5 guardian, referred to as the “Primary Consenter,” who serves as the \n6 Authorized Consenter for the child unless there is no Primary \n7 Consenter as outlined below in Section II.B.3.\n8 3. There is no Primary Consenter only where a parent or legal guardian \n9 is deemed unavailable to act as a consenter because:\n10 a. The UC has no living parent or legal guardian as documented in \n11 the case file; \n12 b. The case file shows that the parent or legal guardian has \n13 repeatedly – that is, after three outreach attempts or more on not \n14 less than two separate days – failed to respond to telephone \n15 contacts or other outreach by the Care Provider;\n16 c. The case file shows that the parent or legal guardian who \n17 resides in the United States has been contacted but refused to \n18 act as the UC’s Sponsor; or \n19 d. There is a documented history of abuse, abandonment,1 or \n20 neglect by the parent or legal guardian and the UC (only for \n21 ages 14 or over) voluntarily states in writing that the UC does \n22 not wish for the parent or legal guardian to act as consenter. \n23 4. If there is no Primary Consenter, then the Sponsor Consenter, if one \n24 exists for the UC, may be the Authorized Consenter. A Sponsor \n25 Consenter shall be deemed unavailable to act as the Authorized \n26 Consenter if:\n27\n1The fact that a UC has traveled to the United States unaccompanied shall not alone be a basis for \n28 finding them to be “abandoned.”\n10\nSTIPULATED SETTLEMENT\nCASE NO.2:18-CV-05741DMGPLA\nExhibit A \nPage 11\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 408-3   Filed 11/14/23   Page 12 of 48   Page ID\n#:20034\n1 a. The case file shows that the Sponsor Consenter has repeatedly –\n2 that is, after three outreach attempts or more on not less than \n3 two separate days – failed to respond to telephone contacts or \n4 other outreach by the Care Provider.\n5 5. If there is no Primary Consenter and no Sponsor Consenter, then a UC \n6 Consenter, if applicable, may be the Authorized Consenter. \n7 6. This Agreement does not require a Care Provider to seek to obtain \n8 informed consent from both the parent or legal guardian and Sponsor \n9 Consenter.\n10 7. This Agreement does not require the Care Provider to obtain informed \n11 consent from both parents.\n12 8. If the Authorized Consenter denies consent, the procedures of Section \n13 IV may apply.  \n14 C. Alternative Process When Authorized Consent Cannot be Obtained \n15 1. The Care Provider may seek concurrence from the CCU in the \n16 following circumstances: \n17 a. there is no Authorized Consenter as documented in the case \n18 file; or\n19 b. The Care Provider obtains a verbal consent decision but cannot \n20 reach the Authorized Consenter to obtain follow-up written \n21 signature consent, as applicable, after three documented \n22 attempts (with none required by mail) occurring at least one \n23 week apart.\n24 2. If CCU concurrence with a Psychotropic Medication prescription is \n25 sought and obtained, it shall be in writing and signed by a licensed \n26 psychiatrist or psychiatric nurse under the supervision of a \n27 psychiatrist, with a preference for a child and adolescent psychiatrist, \n28 if available.\n11\nSTIPULATED SETTLEMENT\nCASE NO.2:18-CV-05741DMGPLA\nExhibit A \nPage 12\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 408-3   Filed 11/14/23   Page 13 of 48   Page ID\n#:20035\n1 III. CONSENT PROCEDURES FOR AUTHORIZED CONSENTERS \n2 A. Verbal Consent\n3 1. Except as specified in Section VI of this Agreement (governing \n4 emergencies), in the case of a UC who is not yet taking a prescription \n5 Psychotropic Medication or course of medications, the Care Provider \n6 shall seek the verbal informed consent of the Authorized Consenter \n7 prior to beginning the course of medication.  Further, except as \n8 specified in Section VI of this Agreement (governing emergencies), in \n9 the case of a UC who is already taking a prescription Psychotropic \n10 Medication or course of medications and who has no authorized \n11 consent that complies with this Agreement already on file, the Care \n12 Provider shall seek the verbal informed consent of the Authorized \n13 Consenter within five days of receiving the UC.  \n14 2. Verbal informed consent must also be obtained prior to increases in \n15 dosage of Psychotropic Medication, other than (a) titrating on or off a \n16 medication, for which informed consent has already been obtained, or \n17 (b) where the Psychotropic Medication is FDA-approved for \n18 administration to children of the UC’s age and the proposed dosage is \n19 within parameters for the child’s age and weight as noted in the \n20 “literature-based maximum dosage” established by the Texas \n21 Department of Health & Human Services document entitled \n22 “Psychotropic Medication Utilization Parameters for Children and \n23 Youth in Texas Public Behavioral Health (6th Ed.)” and linked as \n24 follows: https://hhs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/documents/doing-\n25 business-with-hhs/provider-portal/facilities-\n26 regulation/psychiatric/psychotropic-medication-utilization-\n27 parameters.pdf (as may be updated from time to time), or its successor \n28 publication. \n12\nSTIPULATED SETTLEMENT\nCASE NO.2:18-CV-05741DMGPLA\nExhibit A \nPage 13\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 408-3   Filed 11/14/23   Page 14 of 48   Page ID\n#:20036\n1 3.

Written Consent\n2 1. Verbal consent under Section III.A of this Agreement shall be \n3 followed up by written consent.  Such verbal consent shall remain \n4 valid until rescinded, either orally or in writing, and shall remain valid \n5 for no more than 45 days, subject to the further limitations set forth in \n6 Section III.C.5 below.  \n7 2. The Authorized Consenter shall receive in writing, either via \n8 electronic or mail delivery or similar communication method, a \n9 written communication that confirms that the Authorized Consenter \n10 verbally received the information included in Section III.A.4.a-n, or \n11 III.A.5.a-k (as applicable), in a language the Authorized Consenter \n12 understands.  Such written communication shall also advise the \n13 Authorized Consenter of the condition being treated, as well as the \n14 name of the Psychotropic Medication(s).  If the Authorized Consenter \n15 is illiterate, the above procedures shall still be followed; however, \n16 after the Authorized Consenter has received the written \n17 communication, the Care Provider shall certify in writing that the \n18 document was fully communicated to the Authorized Consenter in a \n19 language the consenter understands. \n20 3. The Authorized Consenter may provide written consent by either \n21 mailing, texting, faxing, or otherwise electronically sending a \n22 signature evincing their consent to the prescription and administration \n23 of the Psychotropic Medication(s). \n24 4. The Authorized Consenter may choose to waive providing written \n25 consent in cases where doing so would result in safety risks or undue \n26 burden.  In such cases, the Care Provider shall document the waiver in \n27 the child’s case file. \n28 5.

Additional Requirements\n4 1. Every six months, the Care Provider shall provide written or verbal \n5 notice to the Authorized Consenter that such Authorized Consenter \n6 may withdraw consent and afford the Authorized Consenter an \n7 opportunity to request information regarding the Psychotropic \n8 Medication(s) as specified in Section III.A.4.a-n or III.A.5.a-k (as \n9 applicable) of this Agreement.  The notice shall be provided in a \n10 language the authorized consenter understands.\n11 2. Informed consent from the Authorized Consenter must be obtained \n12 voluntarily and without undue influence or coercion.  No UC or \n13 Authorized Consenter shall be subjected to retaliation for providing, \n14 withholding, or withdrawing consent for any Psychotropic \n15 Medication.  Actions of the Care Provider that are solely due to \n16 behavior(s) that result from the UC not taking recommended \n17 medication(s), and where such actions are not intended to punish the \n18 UC (including transfer to another placement, alteration of behavioral \n19 plans, increased staffing for the UC, or determining a UC is a danger \n20 to self or others), shall not constitute retaliation. \n21 3. ORR shall direct that when a UC Consenter consents to the \n22 administration of antipsychotics or to the administration of three or \n23 more Psychotropic Medications, the Care Provider must flag the case \n24 for DHUC review.\n25 4. ORR shall promulgate a policy requiring that Care Providers ensure \n26 that: (1) the terms of this Agreement are followed when a UC is \n27 admitted to a hospital for 14 days or more; (2) a UC’s hospital \n28 medical records are promptly uploaded to the ORR UC Portal or other \n17\nSTIPULATED SETTLEMENT\nCASE NO.2:18-CV-05741DMGPLA\nExhibit A \nPage 18\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 408-3   Filed 11/14/23   Page 19 of 48   Page ID\n#:20041\n1 data system; and (3) Psychotropic Medications that UCs are \n2 prescribed while admitted to a hospital are tracked in the ORR UC \n3 Portal or other data system. This provision does not affect the \n4 requirements that a Care Provider adhere to the terms of this \n5 Agreement before a UC is admitted to a hospital, including the \n6 Emergencies provisions set forth in Section VI.  The Primary \n7 Consenter or Sponsor Consenter shall be notified as soon as \n8 practicable, and in all cases within one week of admission, each time a \n9 youth is admitted to a hospital for psychiatric treatment.   \n10 5. The child, their counsel, if any, and their Child Advocate, if \n11 applicable, will have access to the documentation required under \n12 Sections III.B and III.C upon request in accordance with ORR UC \n13 Policy on the confidentiality of mental health and medical records.\n14 6. Nothing in this Agreement will be a justification to delay an otherwise \n15 appropriate release to a suitable sponsor, step-down, or placement in a \n16 URM program in accordance with ORR UC Policy. \n17 IV. OVERRIDING DENIAL OF CONSENT \n18 A. In cases where a Primary Consenter or Sponsor Consenter denies consent, \n19 the prescribing clinician and/or Care Provider may seek consent from the \n20 UC Consenter; or (including in cases where there is no UC Consenter) seek \n21 concurrence from the CCU to override the Primary Consenter or Sponsor \n22 Consenter’s denial.\n23 B. The CCU may concur to override denial of consent only as follows:\n24 1. After consultation with the prescribing clinician, the Care Provider, \n25 and the Primary Consenter or Sponsor Consenter (as applicable under \n26 IV.B.2. of this Agreement), the CCU finds based on its professional \n27 judgment that:\n28\n18\nSTIPULATED SETTLEMENT\nCASE NO.2:18-CV-05741DMGPLA\nExhibit A \nPage 19\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 408-3   Filed 11/14/23   Page 20 of 48   Page ID\n#:20042\n1 a. Administering the prescribed medication is in the best interest \n2 of the child; and\n3 b. The failure to take the prescribed medication is likely to:\n4 i. Either\n5 A. Result in observable and material impairment to \n6 the growth, development, or functioning of the \n7 UC, or\n8 B. Place the UC at imminent risk of substantial bodily \n9 harm or of inflicting substantial bodily harm to \n10 others; and\n11 ii. All other reasonable measures, alone, have been \n12 determined unlikely to prevent the UC from the \n13 impairment or harm described in IV.B.1.b.i.A or B \n14 above.\n15 2.  The CCU shall make two documented attempts to contact the Primary \n16 Consenter or Sponsor Consenter to obtain the basis for the denial of \n17 consent, if not provided by the Care Provider or prescribing clinician.\n18 C. If the CCU concurs to override a Primary Consenter or Sponsor Consenter, \n19 the Care Provider will notify the Primary Consenter or Sponsor Consenter, \n20 in a language such Primary Consenter or Sponsor Consenter understands, of \n21 the CCU’s determination and document this communication in the UC’s \n22 case file. In all cases of override, the Primary Consenter or Sponsor \n23 Consenter will be provided with the contact information of the Monitor so \n24 that the Primary Consenter or Sponsor Consenter may report their concerns \n25 to the Monitor.\n26 D. In no case shall the CCU override a UC Consenter’s denial of consent.\n27 E. The CCU shall document and track any instance it concurs to override the \n28 Primary Consenter or Sponsor Consenter’s denial of consent. \n19\nSTIPULATED SETTLEMENT\nCASE NO.2:18-CV-05741DMGPLA\nExhibit A \nPage 20\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 408-3   Filed 11/14/23   Page 21 of 48   Page ID\n#:20043\n1 V. UC ASSENT\n2 A. For any UC aged 14 or older, prior to administering Psychotropic \n3 Medication(s), the Care Provider must attempt to seek informed assent or \n4 agreement from the UC, consistent with the following, but with the \n5 understanding that a Primary Consenter or Sponsor Consenter’s consent will \n6 control even in the absence of UC assent:\n7 1. That the UC is informed, in an age and developmentally appropriate \n8 manner and in a language the UC understands, of the recommendation \n9 for the prescribed Psychotropic Medication(s) as part of the UC’s \n10 treatment plan, the purpose of the medication(s), and the potential side \n11 effects of the medication(s), and has an opportunity to voice reactions \n12 or concerns regarding the prescribed medication(s). \n13 2. That the UC is shown a written notice (also included in the case file \n14 with the date shown) explaining that the UC may speak privately with \n15 the prescribing healthcare provider if the provider is willing to do so \n16 regarding any proposed Psychotropic Medication. \n17 B. Informed assent need not be sought when a medication is administered on an \n18 emergency basis as described in Section VI of this Agreement.\n19 VI. EMERGENCIES\n20 A. Prior consent (both verbal and written) from an Authorized Consenter is not \n21 required when an emergency exists such that the immediate failure to \n22 administer Psychotropic Medication poses a threat of imminent probability \n23 of death or substantial bodily harm to the UC or to others.  However, the \n24 Primary Consenter or Sponsor Consenter and DHUC shall be notified of \n25 each emergency administration of the medication and the reasons therefor as \n26 soon as practicable and in all cases within one week of its initial \n27 administration. The UC’s case file must include an explanation of the nature \n28 and circumstances of each administration of an emergency medication.

This \n5 emergency exception may not be relied upon for the routine or ongoing \n6 administration of Psychotropic Medication(s) to a UC. \n7 B. ORR shall require all Care Providers to follow existing ORR policies \n8 regarding the use of chemical restraints on any UC.  In addition, ORR shall \n9 maintain a policy requiring that use of any chemical restraint must terminate \n10 when the emergency situation has ended, and be documented as a \n11 Significant Incident Report within twenty-four hours.  Any Care Provider \n12 that has a pattern of using chemical restraints (defined as three or more uses \n13 on the same child while placed with the Care Provider or five or more uses\n14 on any child within 30 days), shall be flagged for DHUC for follow up, \n15 training, and monitoring by ORR.\n16 VII. MONITOR\n17 A. Appointment\n18 1. The Monitor of Defendants’ compliance with this Agreement will be \n19 Kathleen Noonan.  \n20 a. If the Monitor becomes unable or unwilling to serve, the Parties \n21 shall agree on a replacement Monitor, taking into account the \n22 input and recommendations of the outgoing Monitor, if \n23 available.  \n24 b. If the Parties are unable to reach agreement on a replacement \n25 Monitor, they will seek the assistance of a neutral mediator to \n26 resolve the dispute. \n27 2.

The Monitor’s duties will include overseeing, evaluating, reporting \n7 on, and certifying implementation progress and compliance with this \n8 Agreement.  \n9 a. The Monitor will have the authority reasonably necessary to \n10 evaluate progress toward compliance with the Agreement.  This \n11 authority includes the ability to hire staff and engage \n12 consultants, including for data analysis and/or validation, so \n13 long as the cost limit to be negotiated between the Defendants \n14 and the Monitor is not exceeded; request and receive records \n15 within ORR’s access and control, including underlying data, \n16 files, and records; and conduct verification activities, including, \n17 but not limited to, case file reviews (not to exceed 100 per \n18 year), site visits, and independent communications with and/or \n19 interviews of federal and care provider staff, service providers, \n20 and youth and their families and sponsors (with their consent to \n21 be interviewed).  \n22 b.

The Periodic Reports will include the qualitative, \n9 quantitative, and other information the Monitor identifies as \n10 necessary for the Monitor to evaluate, report on, and certify \n11 compliance with the Agreement, that is within ORR’s control, \n12 reasonably obtainable, and is consistent with any applicable \n13 state licensing requirements.\n14 3. Defendants’ Public Reports\n15 a. At the same time that Defendants provide their Periodic Reports \n16 to the Monitor, Defendants will publish streamlined public \n17 reports online, including aggregated information concerning: \n18 the number of children in ORR custody prescribed \n19 Psychotropic Medications; the number of children in ORR \n20 custody prescribed certain classes of Psychotropic Medications; \n21 the type of placement(s); the number of times Psychotropic \n22 Medication was prescribed for an emergency to a child in ORR \n23 custody; and any other information ORR chooses to publish. \n24 4. Monitor’s Reports\n25 a. The Monitor shall file an Annual Report on the docket until the \n26 Termination Date, evaluating Defendants’ implementation \n27 progress, analyzing the data identified in Exhibit A to this \n28 Agreement, and evaluating whether Defendants have \n24\nSTIPULATED SETTLEMENT\nCASE NO.2:18-CV-05741DMGPLA\nExhibit A \nPage 25\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 408-3   Filed 11/14/23   Page 26 of 48   Page ID\n#:20048\n1 demonstrated that they are in Substantial Compliance with the \n2 terms of this Agreement. \n3 b. The first Annual Report will be filed 16 months after the \n4 Effective Date.  Reports will be filed every 12 months \n5 thereafter for as long as the Agreement is in effect (no later than \n6 the Termination Date).\n7 c. If the Monitor concludes that Defendants have not \n8 demonstrated Substantial Compliance with the Agreement, the \n9 Annual Report will include recommendations as to actions \n10 Defendants should take to achieve and/or demonstrate \n11 Substantial Compliance.\n12 d. Two months before the filing date, the Monitor will provide a \n13 draft report to the Parties.  The Parties will have one month to \n14 review the draft report and provide any input to the Monitor.  \n15 The Monitor will then have one month to finalize and file the \n16 Annual Report.\n17 e. The Monitor’s reports will be public, except that any \n18 individually identifiable information concerning children or \n19 information otherwise protected from disclosure by law will be \n20 redacted or otherwise removed from the publicly filed reports.\n21 D. Periodic Meetings\n22 1. The Monitor will convene confidential meetings between the Monitor \n23 and the Parties (jointly) at least every six months, beginning nine \n24 months from the Effective Date and lasting through the Termination \n25 Date, to discuss implementation progress.\n26 2. The Monitor and the Parties will make every effort to schedule one of \n27 these meetings during the month when the Parties are reviewing and \n28 providing input on the Monitor’s draft Annual Report each year.  \n25\nSTIPULATED SETTLEMENT\nCASE NO.2:18-CV-05741DMGPLA\nExhibit A \nPage 26\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 408-3   Filed 11/14/23   Page 27 of 48   Page ID\n#:20049\n1 3. One year after the Effective Date of this Agreement, the Monitor shall \n2 evaluate data and information (including through interviewing Care \n3 Provider and ORR staff), as well as the data identified in Exhibit A, \n4 and advise the Parties whether various provisions of this Agreement \n5 should be modified to ensure the safety and well-being of Class \n6 Members; or, because the cost of implementing the provisions \n7 (including the list of information provided in Section III.A.4.a-n or \n8 III.A.5.a-k (as applicable)) outweighs the benefits.  Based on the \n9 Monitor’s recommendation, the Parties will meet and confer, if \n10 necessary, to discuss modification of the consent process, the role of \n11 the CCU, data issues, or any other provision of the Agreement no later \n12 than the next scheduled meeting of the Parties. \n13 E. Access to Information\n14 1. Plaintiffs will have access to the information provided to the Monitor, \n15 subject to the Protective Order in effect in this case, at the discretion \n16 of the Monitor.\n17 F. Attorney-Client Visits\n18 1. Class counsel, including legal professionals within class counsel’s \n19 organizations, and interpreters, may conduct confidential attorney-\n20 client visits during ordinary business hours, excluding holidays and \n21 weekends.\n22 2.

No later than 24 hours prior to the attorney-client visit, ORR shall \n25 provide Plaintiffs’ counsel with a list of minors at the facility, \n26 including: names, dates of birth, alien registration numbers, countries\n27 of origin, and admission dates.\n28\n26\nSTIPULATED SETTLEMENT\nCASE NO.2:18-CV-05741DMGPLA\nExhibit A \nPage 27\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 408-3   Filed 11/14/23   Page 28 of 48   Page ID\n#:20050\n1 4. 48 hours in advance of class counsel visits, ORR shall provide a sign-\n2 up sheet for Class Members who wish to meet with class counsel.\n3 VIII. ROLE OF CENTRALIZED CONCURRENCE UNIT (CCU)\n4 A. ORR will enter into an agreement with an entity to act as the CCU and will \n5 require as part of the agreement that the CCU acquire the services of at least \n6 one licensed psychiatrist, with a preference for a licensed child and \n7 adolescent psychiatrist when available, to oversee responsibilities; however, \n8 ORR may rely on a psychiatrist within DHUC to act as the CCU.  \n9 B. The CCU shall have the following responsibilities:\n10 1. Provide or withhold concurrence to Psychotropic Medication \n11 prescriptions as provided herein where informed consent cannot be \n12 otherwise obtained, as specified in this Agreement.  \n13 2. Override denial of consent, as specified in Section IV of this \n14 Agreement.\n15 3. Document and track its work relating to Sections VIII.B.1 and 2 \n16 above and provide such information to the Monitor for inclusion in \n17 her reports.\n18 C. Nothing in this Agreement requires that ORR/DHUC or the CCU override \n19 the state medical licensing standards under which licensed psychiatrists \n20 (and/or child and adolescent psychiatrists) operate.  If a CCU psychiatrist \n21 notifies ORR that their state license is at risk based on implementing any of \n22 the provisions of the policies adopted pursuant to this Agreement, ORR will \n23 ensure that the Monitor is notified of the conflict within ten days of \n24 discovering such conflict and will provide the Monitor with ORR’s proposed \n25 plan to ensure substantial compliance with this Agreement with respect to \n26 UCs housed within the State. The Monitor may share this information with \n27 Plaintiffs’ counsel at the Monitor’s discretion, as is consistent with VII.E.1.\n28\n27\nSTIPULATED SETTLEMENT\nCASE NO.2:18-CV-05741DMGPLA\nExhibit A \nPage 28\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 408-3   Filed 11/14/23   Page 29 of 48   Page ID\n#:20051\n1 D. If the CCU is under a contract, grant, or other agreement with HHS, the \n2 terms of any agreement between HHS and the CCU shall provide that the \n3 CCU’s final decision on withholding concurrence or concurring to the \n4 administration of Psychotropic Medications will not be overturned by ORR \n5 or HHS, and that the CCU shall grant or withhold concurrence solely on the \n6 basis of the criteria set forth supra in Section IV for override and Section \n7 II.C for consent.  Nothing in this Agreement overrides contract or grant laws \n8 and regulations that ordinarily apply to HHS contractors or grantees \n9 (including, but not limited to, enforcement, periods of performance, and \n10 reasonable costs). \n11 IX. OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITIES OF ORR’S DIVISION OF HEALTH \n12 FOR UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN\n13 Beginning within a reasonable transition period of no more than 24 months \n14 from the Effective Date, ORR’s DHUC shall perform the following oversight \n15 responsibilities: \n16 A. Review cases that have been flagged by a Care Provider where a UC \n17 Consenter consents to the administration of antipsychotics or to the \n18 administration of three or more Psychotropic Medications or cases where the \n19 Care Provider flags other concerns regarding Psychotropic Medications. \n20 B. Develop a system for conducting retrospective, secondary reviews of \n21 prescriptions of Psychotropic Medications prescribed to UCs in ORR \n22 custody and conduct such reviews.  Criteria for review are subject to the \n23 discretion of DHUC, but must include:\n24 1. Use of any Psychotropic Medication for a child aged three years or \n25 younger; \n26 2. For a child aged four years or older: \n27 a. Simultaneous use of three or more Psychotropic Medications \n28 for 90 days or more;\n28\nSTIPULATED SETTLEMENT\nCASE NO.2:18-CV-05741DMGPLA\nExhibit A \nPage 29\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 408-3   Filed 11/14/23   Page 30 of 48   Page ID\n#:20052\n1 b. Use of two or more antipsychotic medications for 60 days or \n2 more; and \n3 3. Instances where the CCU overrides a denial of consent by a Primary \n4 Consenter or Sponsor Consenter.  These instances may be reviewed \n5 annually.\n6 4. Use of Psychotropic Medication dosages in excess of the guidelines \n7 described in Section III.A.2.   \n8 C. Conduct an annual case review of 30 files of UCs administered Psychotropic \n9 Medications to evaluate whether ORR is ensuring that Care Providers \n10 exercise reasonable and diligent efforts to compile and maintain UCs’ \n11 medical records.  \n12 D. DHUC shall document and track its work relating to Sections IX.A-C above \n13 and provide such information to the Monitor for inclusion in their reports.\n14 E. A licensed child and adolescent psychiatrist within DHUC shall oversee \n15 DHUC’s responsibilities under this section. In the event DHUC is unable to \n16 hire or contract with a licensed child and adolescent psychiatrist, ORR shall \n17 notify the Monitor and may rely, in the interim, on a licensed psychiatrist or \n18 a child and adolescent psychiatric nurse practitioner to oversee these \n19 responsibilities. Under such circumstances, DHUC will continue to make \n20 diligent efforts to hire or contract with a licensed child and adolescent \n21 psychiatrist.\n22 X. TRANSITION PLAN\n23 ORR shall require Care Providers to comply with the provisions of this \n24 Agreement in accordance with the timeline set forth in Section X.A-F below. \n25 A. With respect to Shiloh Residential Treatment Center, MercyFirst RTC, and \n26 any other in-network RTCs, ORR shall require compliance as soon as \n27 practicable immediately after the Effective Date, but in no case longer than \n28 three months after the Effective Date. \n29\nSTIPULATED SETTLEMENT\nCASE NO.2:18-CV-05741DMGPLA\nExhibit A \nPage 30\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 408-3   Filed 11/14/23   Page 31 of 48   Page ID\n#:20053\n1 B. With respect to all other Texas Care Providers, ORR shall require \n2 compliance with this Agreement beginning nine months from the Effective \n3 Date of this Agreement.\n4 C. With respect to the remaining Care Providers nationwide, ORR shall publish \n5 a transition plan so as to require compliance of the first third of such \n6 remaining Care Providers beginning no later than the first day of the first \n7 month that is nine months from the finalization of the agreement for the \n8 establishment of the CCU; ORR shall require compliance of the second third \n9 of such remaining Care Providers beginning no later than the first day of the \n10 first month that is 16 months from the finalization of the agreement for the \n11 establishment of the CCU; and ORR shall require compliance of the final \n12 third of such remaining Care Providers beginning no later than the first day \n13 of the first month that is 21 months from the finalization of the agreement \n14 for the establishment of the CCU.  Nothing in this Section prevents earlier \n15 compliance. \n16 D. Defendants will use diligent efforts to establish a CCU within six months of \n17 the Effective Date of this Agreement.  If the CCU is not established by such \n18 date, ORR will establish an agreement such that a licensed psychiatrist or \n19 psychiatric nurse, with a preference for a licensed child and adolescent \n20 psychiatrist when available, shall serve in the role of the CCU as provided in \n21 Section VIII.\n22 E. Within three months of the Effective Date of this Agreement, Defendants \n23 shall develop an Implementation Plan addressing the tasks needed to satisfy \n24 the requirements of this Agreement, the entity responsible for completing the \n25 tasks, and the proposed timeline for completion. The Implementation Plan \n26 shall be subject to review and approval by the Monitor.\n27 F. Within three months of the Effective Date of this Agreement, ORR shall add\n28 to or modify the UC Manual of Procedures (“UC MAP”) and ORR Policy \n30\nSTIPULATED SETTLEMENT\nCASE NO.2:18-CV-05741DMGPLA\nExhibit A \nPage 31\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 408-3   Filed 11/14/23   Page 32 of 48   Page ID\n#:20054\n1 Guide to implement the requirements of this Agreement.  ORR shall solicit \n2 and consider input from Plaintiffs in making these additions and \n3 modifications. The additions and modifications to the UC MAP and ORR \n4 Policy Guide to implement the requirements of this Agreement shall be \n5 subject to review and approval by the Monitor.\n6 XI. CONFLICT WITH STATE LAW\n7 A. If a Care Provider notifies ORR that its state license is at risk based on \n8 implementing any of the provisions of the policies adopted pursuant to this \n9 Agreement, ORR will ensure that the Monitor is notified of the conflict \n10 within ten days of discovering such conflict and will provide the Monitor \n11 with ORR’s proposed plan to ensure substantial compliance with this \n12 Agreement with respect to UCs housed within the State.  The Monitor may \n13 share this information with Plaintiffs’ counsel at the Monitor’s discretion, as \n14 is consistent with VII.E.1.  \n15 B. Section XI.A shall not be read to invalidate any provision of this Agreement \n16 solely on the grounds that it is not required or provides more robust \n17 protections than does a State’s law, or where there is no risk to a Care \n18 Provider’s licensing.\n19 XII. SETTLEMENT APPROVAL, DISMISSAL OF PLAINTIFFS’ THIRD \n20 CLAIM FOR RELIEF, RETENTION OF JURISDICTION, AND EXIT\n21 A. Settlement Approval\n22 1. This Agreement is effective only with Court approval.  The Effective \n23 Date is the date of final approval of the Agreement by the Court.\n24 2. Within 30 days after signing this Agreement, the Parties will file a \n25 joint or unopposed motion with the Court seeking preliminary \n26 approval of this Agreement, approval of a notice plan and proposed \n27 notice to the Class, a briefing schedule for final approval, and a final \n28 fairness hearing. \n31\nSTIPULATED SETTLEMENT\nCASE NO.2:18-CV-05741DMGPLA\nExhibit A \nPage 32\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 408-3   Filed 11/14/23   Page 33 of 48   Page ID\n#:20055\n1 3. In seeking final approval of this Agreement, the Parties will file a \n2 joint or unopposed motion requesting entry of a proposed judgment \n3 and order that:\n4 a. Grants final approval of the Agreement, without modification \n5 of any of its terms (unless the Parties have agreed to such \n6 modification), as a fair, reasonable, and adequate resolution of \n7 Plaintiffs’ Third Claim for Relief under Federal Rule of Civil \n8 Procedure 23; \n9 b. Finds that the Agreement resulted from extensive arms-length, \n10 good faith negotiations between the Parties through experienced \n11 counsel; \n12 c. Dismisses Plaintiffs’ Third Claim for Relief of the operative \n13 First Amended Complaint with prejudice;\n14 b. Finds that each Class Member shall be deemed to have released \n15 all claims for systemic declarative and injunctive relief \n16 presented in the Third Claim for Relief of the First Amended \n17 Complaint arising or accruing against the Defendants on or \n18 before the Termination Date, as well as all claims for systemic \n19 declarative and injunctive relief based on an identical factual \n20 predicate as the Third Claim for Relief of the operative First \n21 Amended Complaint arising or accruing against the Defendants \n22 on or before the Termination Date, even if such claims were not \n23 presented or might not have been presentable in this class \n24 action.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this provision does not \n25 release, relinquish, or discharge the First, Second, Fourth, \n26 and/or Fifth claims for Relief in the operative First Amended \n27 Complaint.  In addition, all disputes regarding this Agreement \n28 arising before the Termination Date will be resolved in \n32\nSTIPULATED SETTLEMENT\nCASE NO.2:18-CV-05741DMGPLA\nExhibit A \nPage 33\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 408-3   Filed 11/14/23   Page 34 of 48   Page ID\n#:20056\n1 accordance with the dispute resolution processes in Section \n2 XIII.B-D; and \n3 a.

Individual Claims\n10 1. This Agreement is intended to provide a class-wide solution to matters \n11 covered by the Agreement.  Nothing in this Agreement is intended to \n12 limit the ability of any individual Class Member to obtain individual \n13 relief to which they would otherwise be entitled under state or federal \n14 law.  Likewise, nothing in this Agreement is intended to create an \n15 individual right of action to enforce this Agreement.\n16 C. Jurisdiction \n17 1. The Court shall have and retain jurisdiction to interpret and enforce \n18 this Agreement.\n19 2. The Parties agree that notwithstanding any other term or provision of \n20 this Agreement, the Court shall not have jurisdiction to enforce this \n21 Agreement after the Termination Date.\n22 D. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this Agreement \n23 shall terminate on the earliest of the following dates (the “Termination \n24 Date”):\n25 1.

INTRODUCTION \n2 Plaintiffs seek judicially-created policies and procedures regarding the care of \n3 unaccompanied alien children (UACs) in Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) \n4 custody  under  a  procedural-due-process  theory  that  exceed  both  what  they \n5 previously negotiated in a nationwide settlement agreement and what Congress has \n6 mandated  by  statute.  These  additional  procedures  would  alter  the  policies  and \n7 procedures that ORR follows in making three vital decisions to safeguard the welfare \n8 of UACs entrusted to its legal custody: (1) where UACs are housed; (2) when and \n9 how they are released; and (3) the services they receive while in federal custody.  \n10 Two of the plaintiff classes in this case—the step-up class and the unfit-custodian \n11 class—challenge  the  policies  and  procedures  ORR  follows  in  making  those \n12 decisions.  A third plaintiff class—the legal representation class—seeks additional \n13 services not provided by Congress to contest those decisions.  Each class’s claims \n14 fail as a matter of law.  To start, their challenges were conclusively resolved in Flores \n15 v. Barr, No. 85-cv-04544, where this Court approved a settlement agreement (the \n16 Flores Settlement or Settlement) that “set[ ] out nationwide policy for the detention, \n17 release, and treatment of minors in the custody of the INS” (¶ 9) for “[a]ll minors \n18 who are detained in the legal custody of the INS” (¶ 10).  Even if these claims were \n19 not barred by res judicata, ORR’s procedures satisfy due process as a matter of law \n20 and withstand all of Plaintiffs’ other challenges.  This Court should therefore grant \n21 summary judgment for Defendants under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 on those three classes’ \n22 claims. \n23 First, the Court should grant summary judgment for Defendants on the step-\n24 up class’s claim that ORR does not provide adequate notice and an opportunity to \n25 be heard for UACs who are placed in a secure, staff-secure, or residential-treatment-\n26 center facility within 30 days of a step-up to those facilities.  The step-up claim is \n27 barred by res judicata.  The Flores Settlement conclusively resolved the question of \n28 what procedures due process requires be provided to UACs who wish to challenge \n1 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 10 of 69   Page ID\n#:5748\n \n1 ORR  placement  decisions.  Under  the  Settlement,  a  minor  may  seek  “a  bond \n2 redetermination  hearing  before  an  immigration  judge”  (¶ 24A)  to  determine \n3 dangerousness or whether they are a flight risk, and “[a]ny minor who disagrees with \n4 the INS’s determination to place that minor in a particular type of facility . . . may \n5 seek judicial review in any United States District Court with jurisdiction and venue \n6 over the matter to challenge that placement determination” (¶24B).  The step-up \n7 class’s claim involves substantially the same evidence, alleges infringement of the \n8 same rights, and arises out of the same transactional nucleus of facts as the Flores \n9 Settlement.  Under settled principles of res judicata, the Settlement precludes the \n10 step-up  class  from  raising  a  new  procedural  due  process  claim  to  seek  new \n11 procedures not required under the Settlement for this class, and imposing such \n12 procedures would deprive Defendants of the benefits that they negotiated under the \n13 Settlement.   \n14 Even if res judicata did not bar the step-up class’s claim, the Court should still \n15 grant summary judgment to Defendants because ORR’s policies and procedures for \n16 that class satisfy due process as a matter of law under Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. \n17 319 (1976).  Children, unlike adults, are always in some form of custody, and so \n18 their liberty interest is limited.  UACs in particular are children who lack an available \n19 care provider, and Congress has expressly granted custody of UACs to ORR.  ORR, \n20 in turn, has developed and follows extensive procedures when placing a UAC in a \n21 more restrictive setting.  Those procedures include multiple levels of review and \n22 opportunities to be heard, and balance important interests such as placing a child in \n23 the least restrictive setting appropriate for the child’s needs while also providing for \n24 the  safety  and  welfare  of  other  children  in  ORR  care.    Additional  procedures \n25 allowing  further  challenges  to  routine  child-welfare  decision-making  in  an \n26 adversarial proceeding would not meaningfully reduce the (already low) risk of \n27 erroneous  deprivation  of  the  class  members’  diminished  liberty  interest. \n28\n2 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 11 of 69   Page ID\n#:5749\n \n1 Accordingly, under Mathews, Defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law \n2 on the step-up class’s due-process claim.   \n3 Defendants are also entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the step-up \n4 class’s claim that ORR’s policies and procedures on custody decisions violate the \n5 Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization  Act  (TVPRA)  and  the \n6 Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  Plaintiffs identify no provision under either \n7 statute that mandates the procedures they seek, and their claim under both statutes is \n8 simply their procedural-due-process claim recast as a statutory violation.  So their \n9 claims under the TVPRA and the APA fail as a matter of law.   \n10 Second, the Court should grant summary judgment for Defendants on the \n11 unfit-custodian class’s claim that ORR does not provide a timely and meaningful \n12 opportunity to be heard when ORR delays or denies release to potential sponsors.  \n13 Plaintiffs’  unfit-custodian  claim  is  barred  by  res  judicata  because  the  Flores \n14 Settlement conclusively resolved what procedures due process requires for release \n15 decisions.  The Settlement requires ORR to avoid “unnecessary delay” in releasing \n16 minors from its custody (¶ 14), sets forth criteria for ORR to consider in making a \n17 suitability determination for potential sponsors (¶ 17), requires ORR to “make” and \n18 “record” release efforts (¶ 18), and sets forth a procedure for a UAC’s attorney to \n19 contact a “juvenile coordinator” to “investigate” any case where “Plaintiffs’ counsel \n20 have reasonable cause to believe a minor . . . should have been released” (¶ 28B).  \n21 The unfit-custodian class’s claim involves substantially the same evidence, alleges \n22 infringement of the same rights, and arises out of the same transactional nucleus of \n23 facts as Flores, which set forth “nationwide policy for the detention, release, and \n24 treatment of minors in the custody of the INS” (¶ 9).  Res judicata thus precludes a \n25 new due-process claim like this one that seeks additional procedures for minors in \n26 immigration custody on claims that could have been raised in Flores.   \n27 Even if res judicata did not bar the unfit-custodian class’s claim, the Court \n28 should still grant summary judgment for Defendants because ORR’s policies and \n3 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 12 of 69   Page ID\n#:5750\n \n1 procedures regarding release satisfy due process as a matter of law.  As with the \n2 step-up  class,  the  unfit-custodian  class’s  liberty  interest  is  limited  given  class \n3 members’ status as children and as UACs apprehended at the border without legal \n4 immigration status.  And ORR has developed and follows extensive procedures \n5 involving multiple levels of review in determining whether to release a UAC to a \n6 potential sponsor.  These processes safeguard the welfare of children in ORR’s care \n7 while affording both children and potential sponsors ample opportunities to present \n8 information supporting release.  These processes, which appropriately balance the \n9 competing interests involved in release decisions in a safe and timely manner, satisfy \n10 due process as a matter of law.   \n11 Defendants are further entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the unfit-\n12 custodian class’s claim that ORR’s policies and procedures for release decisions \n13 violate the TVPRA, the APA, and the First Amendment.  Plaintiffs identify no \n14 provision under either the TVPRA or the APA that mandates the procedures they \n15 seek, and their claims under both statutes are simply their procedural-due-process \n16 claims recast as statutory violations.  Similarly, Plaintiffs’ claim under the First \n17 Amendment fails as a matter of law because it is simply their flawed due-process \n18 claim recast under the First Amendment’s Freedom of Association Clause, which \n19 does not help them in this context.   \n20 Finally, the Court should grant summary judgment for Defendants on the \n21 legal-representation class’s claim that ORR “blocks” lawyers from representing \n22 class  members  in  matters  involving  ORR’s  custody,  release,  medication,  and \n23 placement  decisions.    The  legal-representation  class’s  claim  that  due  process \n24 requires ORR to facilitate access to counsel to contest routine ORR decisionmaking \n25 is barred by res judicata.  The Flores Settlement conclusively resolved this issue: \n26 for legal representation, the Settlement expressly provides that UACs must receive \n27 information regarding the “right to be represented by counsel at no expense to the \n28 government,” but articulates no other requirements for facilitation beyond providing \n4 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 13 of 69   Page ID\n#:5751\n \n1 “[l]egal services information regarding the availability of free legal assistance” (Ex. \n2 1, ¶ 14).  Like the claims of the step-up and unfit-custodian classes, the legal-\n3 representation  class’s  claim  involves  substantially  the  same  evidence,  alleges \n4 infringement of the same rights, and arises out of the same transactional nucleus of \n5 facts as Flores.  Res judicata therefore precludes Plaintiffs’ due process claim \n6 seeking additional legal-representation entitlements for class members beyond those \n7 provided in the Flores Settlement.   \n8 Summary  judgment  for  Defendants  is  also  warranted  on  the  legal-\n9 representation class’s claim, even if res judicata did not apply, because ORR’s \n10 policies and procedures regarding legal representation of UACs satisfy due process.  \n11 There  is  no  protected  liberty  interest  in  Plaintiffs’  claimed  right  to  access \n12 representation by ORR-funded legal service providers to challenge ORR’s step-up, \n13 release,  and  medication  decisions.    Challenges  to  routine  child-welfare \n14 decisionmaking have never been interpreted to mean “legal proceedings or matters” \n15 under § 235(c)(5) of the TVPRA, and there is no evidence that ORR blocks legal \n16 service providers from using non-ORR funds to independently represent UACs.  \n17 And even if there were some minimal interest, any risk of erroneous deprivation is \n18 low given ORR’s extensive policies and procedures to ensure that UACs can obtain \n19 information about the ability “to be represented by counsel at no expense to the \n20 government” (Ex. 1, ¶ 14).   \n21 Defendants are also entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the legal-\n22 representation  class’s  claim  that  ORR’s  policies  and  procedures  for  legal \n23 representation of UACs contravene the TVPRA, the Homeland Security Act (HSA), \n24 federal immigration regulations, and the APA.  None of these statute and regulations \n25 mandate  the  right  to  access  government-funded  counsel  to  represent  UACs  in \n26 matters unrelated to immigration proceedings, government-funded or not, nor do the \n27 uncontroverted facts show that ORR blocks attorneys of record from representing \n28 their clients.  Thus, Plaintiffs’ legal-representation claims fail as a matter of law.   \n5 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 14 of 69   Page ID\n#:5752\n \n1 For all these reasons, Defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law \n2 on the step-up, unfit-custodian, and legal-representation classes’ claims.   \n3 II.  RELEVANT BACKGROUND \n4 The Flores Litigation and Its Resolution of Issues for UACs.  Flores v. Barr, \n5 No. 85-cv-04544 (C.D. Cal.), was filed in 1985.  The Flores plaintiffs brought suit \n6\non behalf of a class of certain alien minors detained by the INS because “a parent or \n7\nlegal guardian [had] fail[ed] to personally appear to take custody of them.”  Reno v. \n8\nFlores, 507 U.S. 292, 296 (1993).  In 1986, the district court certified two classes:  \n9\n(1) All persons under the age of eighteen (18) years who have been, \n10 are, or will be arrested and detained pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252 by \n[INS] within the INS’ Western Region and who have been, are, or \n11\nwill be denied release from INS custody because a parent or legal \n12 guardian fails to personally appear to take custody of them; and \n(2) All persons under the age of eighteen (18) who have been, are or \n13\nwill be arrested and detained pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252 by [INS] \n14\nwithin the INS’ Western Region and who have been, are, or will be \n15 subjected  to  any  of  the  following  conditions:  a.  inadequate \nopportunities for exercise or recreation; b. inadequate educational \n16\ninstruction;  c.  inadequate  reading  materials;  d.  inadequate \n17 opportunities  for  visitation  with  counsel,  family,  and  friends; \ne. regular contact as a result of confinement with adult detainees \n18\nunrelated to such minors either by blood, marriage, or otherwise; \n19\nf. strip or body cavity search after meeting with counsel or at any \n20 other time or occasion absent demonstrable adequate cause.  \n21\nFlores v. Lynch, 828 F.3d 898, 902 (9th Cir. 2016).  In May 1988, the INS published \n22\nrules governing the detention and release of juveniles, 53 Fed. Reg. 17449, which \n23\nthe Supreme Court upheld.  Flores, 507 U.S. at 315.  The Supreme Court held that \n24\nthe new rules were a “reasonable response to the difficult problems presented when \n25\nthe [INS] arrests unaccompanied alien juveniles” and “accord[ed] with both the \n26\nConstitution and the relevant statute.”  Id. at 315. \n27\n28\n6 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 15 of 69   Page ID\n#:5753\n \n1 In 1997, the Flores district court approved a settlement agreement between \n2 the federal government and a class of “[a]ll minors who are detained in the legal \n3\ncustody of the INS” (¶ 10).  The Settlement “sets out nationwide policy for the \n4\ndetention, release, and treatment of minors in the custody of the INS” (¶ 9) and \n5\nprovides detailed procedures and standards for the release and placement of UACs \n6\nin federal custody (Ex. 1).  The Settlement states that “upon execution of this \n7\nAgreement in their representative capacities, the principals, agents, and successors \n8\nof such principals and agents shall be fully and unequivocally bound hereunder to \n9\nthe full extent authorized by law” (¶ 41). \n10\nOn placement of UACs in federal custody, the Settlement provides that “[a] \n11\nminor may be held in or transferred to a suitable State or county juvenile detention \n12\nfacility” whenever the relevant agency official “determines that the minor” has met \n13\ncertain criteria, including being chargeable with a crime, making credible threats of \n14\nviolence, engaging in unacceptably disruptive behavior, or being an escape risk \n15\n(¶ 21).  The Settlement additionally allows challenges to certain agency custodial \n16\ndecisions: it specifies procedures for a bond hearing before an immigration judge \n17\n(¶ 24A), allows for judicial review in a court with jurisdiction and venue to challenge \n18\nplacement in a particular type of facility, such as a secure facility (¶ 24B), and \n19\narticulates an “abuse of discretion” standard of review for such placements (¶ 24C).  \n20\nIt also delegates review and approvals of placements in secure facilities to agency \n21\npersonnel and does not require further process within the agency (¶ 23).  \n22\nOn release, the Settlement provides that release shall be considered only \n23\nwhere the agency “determines that detention . . . is not required . . . to secure . . . \n24\nappearance before the . . . immigration court, or to ensure the minor’s safety or that \n25\nof others.”  In such a case, the agency “shall release a minor from its custody without \n26\nunnecessary delay” to an approved custodian (¶ 14), and the agency “shall make and \n27\nrecord the prompt and continuous efforts on its part toward . . . release” (¶ 18).  The \n28\n7 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 16 of 69   Page ID\n#:5754\n \n1 Settlement also provides the agency with broad authority to conduct suitability \n2 determinations  of  potential  custodians,  which  “may”  include  a  number  of \n3 “components,” before releasing a class member (¶ 17).  The Settlement specifies that \n4 if “Plaintiffs’ counsel have reasonable cause to believe that a minor in INS legal \n5 custody should have been released pursuant to Paragraph 14, Plaintiffs’ counsel may \n6 contact the Juvenile Coordinator to request that the Coordinator investigate the case \n7 and inform Plaintiffs’ counsel of the reasons why the minor has not been released” \n8 (¶ 28B).  \n9 Finally, the Settlement provides that UACs are to be provided with a list of \n10 free legal services that may be available to them, and that UACs in licensed programs \n11 should be informed of their “right to be represented by counsel at no expense to the \n12 government” (¶ 24D; Ex. 1, ¶ 14).  The Settlement provides no right to counsel, \n13 government-funded or not. \n14 Legislative Developments to Address UACs.  In 2002, Congress enacted the \n15 HSA, Pub. L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135 (codified in relevant part at 6 U.S.C. \n16 § 279).  The HSA abolished the INS, established the Department of Homeland \n17 Security (DHS), and transferred several functions with respect to the care of UACs \n18 from the INS to ORR, an office within the Department of Health and Human \n19 Services (HHS).  6 U.S.C. §§ 279(a), (b)(1)(A), (g)(2).  Under the HSA, ORR is \n20 responsible for the care and placement of UACs who enter the United States illegally \n21 and  who  are  “in  Federal  custody  by  reason  of  their  immigration  status.”    Id. \n22 § 279(b)(1)(A).  The HSA charges ORR with “coordinating and implementing the \n23 care  and  placement  of  unaccompanied  alien  children,”  “ensuring  that  the  best \n24 interests of the child are considered in decisions and actions relating to the care and \n25 custody of an unaccompanied alien child,” and identifying “a sufficient number of \n26 qualified individuals, entities, and facilities to house” such children.  Id. § 279(b)(1). \n27 The HSA provides that ORR “shall not release” unaccompanied minor children \n28 “upon their own recognizance.”  6 U.S.C. § 279(b)(2)(B).  The HSA includes a \n8 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 17 of 69   Page ID\n#:5755\n \n1 savings clause that preserves “administrative actions” to which INS was a party, id. \n2 § 552(a)(1) (incorporated by reference in 6 U.S.C. § 279(f)(2)), which has been read \n3 to include the Flores Settlement.   \n4 In 2008, the TVPRA was enacted, Pub. L. No. 110-457, 122 Stat. 5044 \n5 (principally codified in relevant part at 8 U.S.C. § 1232), “to enhance the efforts of \n6 the United States to prevent trafficking in persons,” to reflect Congress’s goal of \n7 ensuring that UACs “are safely repatriated to their country of nationality or of last \n8 habitual residence,” and to avoid incentives that would lead to alien smuggling and \n9 dangerous travel for minor children.  8 U.S.C. § 1232(a).  The TVPRA defines a \n10 UAC as a person under age 18 who lacks lawful immigration status in the United \n11 States and for whom (a) no parent or legal guardian is in the United States, or (b) no \n12 parent or legal guardian is available to provide care and physical custody.  8 U.S.C. \n13 § 1232(g); see also 6 U.S.C. § 279(g)(2).  Under the TVPRA, UACs from countries \n14 not contiguous to the United States and certain UACs from contiguous countries are \n15 placed into HHS custody.  See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1232(a)(3)-(4), (a)(5)(D), (d)(8).  The \n16 TVPRA further directs HHS to place UACs “in the least restrictive setting that is in \n17 the best interest of the child,” 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(2)(A), while the UAC is in HHS \n18 ORR custody—that is, until the UAC is released to a suitable sponsor, obtains lawful \n19 status, or leaves the country, see 6 U.S.C. § 279(g); 8 U.S.C §§ 1232(b)(1), (g).  In \n20 placing children in the least restrictive setting that is in the child’s best interests, \n21 HHS is to “consider danger to self, danger to the community, and risk of flight.”  8 \n22 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(2)(A).  Organizations that provide shelter and services to UACs \n23 do so with substantial ORR involvement pursuant to a cooperative agreement with \n24 ORR, see 31 U.S.C. § 6305, and must comply with ORR’s policies and procedures.  \n25 Defendants’ Statement of Uncontroverted Facts (U.F.) ¶¶ 8-9; Joint Stipulation \n26 Regarding Motion and Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (J.S.) ¶ 93.   \n27 The ORR Guide specifies several mechanisms for obtaining a UAC’s release.  \n28 See generally ORR Guide § 2; Flores v. Sessions, 862 F.3d 863, 871, n.8 (9th Cir. \n9 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 18 of 69   Page ID\n#:5756\n \n1 2017).  “Parents, relatives, or close family friends may apply to have the child \n2 released to their care.”  ORR Guide § 2.2.  In the rare situation where release is \n3 denied to a parent or legal guardian, special procedures apply, a formal decision \n4 letter is sent, and the parent or legal guardian may appeal and request a hearing \n5 before the Assistant Secretary for Children and Families.  ORR Guide § 2.7.8.  The \n6 Ninth Circuit has additionally interpreted the Flores Settlement to provide UACs in \n7 ORR custody the right to challenge in an immigration-court bond hearing continued \n8 custody that is based solely upon the danger the UAC would present upon release.  \n9 Flores, 862 F.3d at 881.1  A UAC can decide to leave ORR’s custody at any time by \n10 seeking voluntary departure to his or her country of origin, at no cost to the UAC.  \n11 See 8 U.S.C. § 1232(a)(5)(D)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 240.25. \n12 This Case.  On June 29, 2018, seven individual plaintiffs and two institutional \n13 plaintiffs  filed  this  lawsuit  challenging  ORR’s  policies  and  practices  regarding \n14 UACs in its custody.  In their operative, amended complaint, Plaintiffs brought five \n15 claims.  Amended Complaint, ECF. No. 81 (Compl.).  First, Plaintiffs claim that—\n16 in violation of the Flores Settlement, the TVPRA, the APA, the Due Process Clause, \n17 and the First Amendment’s Freedom of Association Clause—“[a]s a matter of policy \n18 and practice Defendants unreasonably and unnecessarily delay or refuse to release \n19 children to parents, close family members, and other available custodians on the \n20 ostensible grounds that such custodians are or may be unfit, and they do so without \n21 affording  detained  minors  or  their  proposed  custodians  a  timely,  prompt,  or \n22 meaningful opportunity to be heard regarding such custodians’ fitness.”  Compl. ¶¶ \n23 180-81.  Second, Plaintiffs claim that—in violation of the Flores Settlement, the \n24 TVPRA, the APA,  and the Due Process Clause—“[a]s a  matter of policy and \n25 practice,  Defendants place Plaintiffs  and  those similarly  situated in [residential \n                                                 \n26\n1 The United States respectfully disagrees with the Ninth Circuit’s interpretation of \n27 the Flores Settlement.  A favorable finding at a Flores bond hearing does not \nautomatically entitle a UAC to release, as ORR must still determine the suitability \n28\nof the sponsor to be a custodian.  Flores, 862 F.3d at 878. \n10 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 19 of 69   Page ID\n#:5757\n \n1 treatment centers], secure facilities, and medium-secure facilities without affording \n2 them  a  meaningful  opportunity  to  be  heard  either  prior  or  subsequent  to  such \n3 placement.”  Id. ¶¶ 183-84.  Third, Plaintiffs claim that—in violation of the Flores \n4 Settlement, the TVPRA, the APA, and the Due Process Clause—“[a]s a matter of \n5 policy and practice, Defendants administer children psychotropic drugs without \n6 procedural  safeguards,  including:  obtaining  informed  consent  or  the  lawful \n7 equivalent; involving a neutral decision maker in the initial determination of whether \n8 to prescribe psychotropic medications to children in ORR custody; and conducting \n9 a  periodic  review  of  such  treatment  decisions  to  ensure  that  youth  are  not \n10 administered psychotropic medications unnecessarily or at harmful dosage levels or \n11 in harmful combinations.”  Id. ¶¶ 186-87.  Fourth, Plaintiffs claim that—in violation \n12 of the Flores Settlement, the TVPRA, the HSA, the APA, and the Due Process \n13 Clause—“[a]s a matter of policy and practice, ORR blocks [Vera Institute of Justice \n14 (VIJ)]-funded lawyers from representing Plaintiffs and those similarly situated in \n15 legal matters and proceedings involving ORR’s decisions regarding custody, release, \n16 medication, and placement.”  Id. ¶¶ 189-90.  Fifth, Plaintiffs claim that—in violation \n17 of the Rehabilitation Act—(1) “[a]s a matter of policy and practice, ORR places \n18 Plaintiffs who have or are perceived to have behavioral, mental health, intellectual \n19 and/or developmental disabilities in restrictive settings, such as secure facilities, \n20 medium  secure  facilities,  or  [residential  treatment  centers],  because  of  their \n21 disabilities”; and (2) “[a]s a matter of policy and practice, ORR delays or obstructs \n22 the release of Plaintiffs who have or are perceived to have behavioral, mental health, \n23 intellectual and/or developmental disabilities to parents, close family members, and \n24 other available custodians because of their disabilities.”  Id. ¶¶ 192-94. \n25 In September 2018, Defendants moved to dismiss Plaintiffs’ complaint in its \n26 entirety and Plaintiffs moved for class certification.  ECF No. 97, 101.  The Court \n27 granted Defendants’ motion to dismiss “only insofar as it seeks the dismissal without \n28 prejudice of Plaintiffs’ claims to enforce the Flores Agreement, but not insofar as it \n11 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 20 of 69   Page ID\n#:5758\n \n1 requests the dismissal of Plaintiffs’ claims that ORR failed to provide sufficient \n2 procedural safeguards for alien minors to exercise their Flores rights.”  Amended \n3 Order, ECF No. 126 at 27 (Order).  The Court also certified five classes: (1) a step-\n4 up class, based on Plaintiffs’ second claim—that UACs are denied due process when \n5 they are placed in secure, staff-secure, and residential-treatment-center facilities; (2) \n6 an unfit-custodian class, based on Plaintiffs’ first claim for relief—that UACs are \n7 denied due process when they are denied release to potential sponsors; (3) a drug-\n8 administration class, based on Plaintiffs’ third claim—that UACs are administered \n9 psychotropic drugs without appropriate safeguards; (4) a legal-representation class, \n10 based on Plaintiffs’ fourth claim—that ORR blocks legal assistance to UACs in \n11 matters relating to their custody, medication, and release; and (5) a disability class, \n12 based on Plaintiffs’ fifth claim—that ORR discriminates against UACs on the basis \n13 of disability in placement and release decisions.  Id. at 27-28. \n14 III.  ISSUES PRESENTED \n15 1.  Whether  the  Court  should  grant  summary  judgment  for  Defendants  on \n16 Plaintiffs’ step-up claim (the second claim for relief, Compl. ¶¶ 183-84), \n17 because the claim is barred by res judicata and because there is no genuine \n18 dispute of material fact that ORR’s policies and procedures on placement of \n19 UACs in restrictive settings comport with due process, the TVPRA, and the \n20 APA. \n21 2.  Whether  the  Court  should  grant  summary  judgment  for  Defendants  on \n22 Plaintiffs’ unfit-custodian claim (the first claim for relief, Compl. ¶¶ 180-81), \n23 because the claim is barred by res judicata and because there is no genuine \n24 dispute  of  material  fact  that  ORR’s  policies  and  procedures  for  release \n25 decisions comport with due process, the TVPRA, the APA, and the First \n26 Amendment’s Freedom of Association Clause. \n27 3.  Whether  the  Court  should  grant  summary  judgment  for  Defendants  on \n28 Plaintiffs’  legal-representation  claim  (the  fourth  claim  for  relief,  Compl. \n12 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 21 of 69   Page ID\n#:5759\n \n1 ¶¶ 189-90), because the claim is barred by res judicata and because there is \n2 no  genuine  dispute  of  material  fact  that  ORR’s  policies  and  procedures \n3 regarding  legal  representation  of  UACs  comport  with  due  process,  the \n4 TVPRA, the HSA, federal immigration regulations, and the APA. \n5 IV.  LEGAL STANDARD FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n6 “The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no \n7 genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a \n8 matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  The moving party has the initial burden of \n9 demonstrating the absence of any genuine issue of material fact.  Devereaux v. \n10 Abbey, 263 F.3d 1070, 1076 (9th Cir. 2001).  A fact is material if it may affect the \n11 outcome of the case.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).  \n12 “Once the moving party carries its initial burden,” the non-moving party  must \n13 provide evidence that “set[s] forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue \n14 for trial.”  Devereaux, 263 F.3d. at 1076 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)). \n15 At summary judgment, the Court should draw evidentiary inferences in the \n16 light most favorable to the non-moving party.  King Cty. v. Rasmussen, 299 F.3d \n17 1077, 1083 (9th Cir. 2002).  But the moving party need not disprove matters on \n18 which the opponent has the burden of proof at trial.  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 \n19 U.S. 317, 322 (1986).  Summary judgment is appropriate “against a party who fails \n20 to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to the \n21 party’s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.”  Id. at \n22 322.  “Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the \n23 governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment.”  Anderson, \n24 477 U.S. at 248. \n25 To create a genuine issue of material fact, a party must rely on facts, not \n26 unsupported statements.  McSherry v. City of Long Beach, 584 F.3d 1129, 1138 (9th \n27 Cir. 2009).  “[O]nly admissible evidence may be considered by the trial court in \n28 ruling on a motion for summary judgment.”  Beyene v. Coleman Sec. Servs., Inc., \n13 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 22 of 69   Page ID\n#:5760\n \n1 854 F.2d 1179, 1181 (9th Cir. 1988).  To defeat a motion for summary judgment, \n2 the  non-moving  party  must  present  “evidence  on  which  the  [factfinder]  could \n3 reasonably find for the” non-moving party.  Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 252.  Thus, \n4 where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for \n5 the non-moving party, there is no genuine issue for trial and summary judgment is \n6 appropriate.  Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 \n7 (1986).   \n8\nV.  ARGUMENT \n9\nAs a matter of law, Plaintiffs cannot prevail on their claims for the step-up, \n10\nunfit-custodian, and legal-representation classes.  The Court therefore should grant \n11\nsummary judgment for Defendants on the first, second, and fourth claims in the \n12\noperative complaint. \n13\nA.  Defendants Are Entitled to Judgment as a Matter of Law on the Step-Up \n14 Class’s Claim.  \n15\nThe Court should grant summary judgment for Defendants on Plaintiffs’ \n16\nclaim that ORR’s step-up procedures are unlawful because ORR allegedly does not \n17\nprovide adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard for UACs placed in secure, \n18\nstaff-secure,  and  residential-treatment-center  facilities  within  30  days.  Compl. \n19\n¶¶ 122, 182-84.  Plaintiffs’ step-up claim is barred by res judicata.  And ORR’s \n20\npolicies and procedures for stepping up UACs to more restrictive settings satisfy due \n21\nprocess and other legal requirements as a matter of law.  \n22\n1) Plaintiffs’ claim for the step-up class is barred by res judicata.   \n23\nPlaintiffs’ step-up challenge—including the purported statutory aspects of \n24\ntheir  claim  that  simply  replicate  their  due-process  challenge—is  barred  by  res \n25\njudicata.  Their claim that due process requires additional procedures to challenge \n26\nplacement decisions was conclusively resolved in Flores.  “Under the doctrine of \n27\nclaim preclusion [res judicata], a final judgment forecloses ‘successive litigation of \n28\n14 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 23 of 69   Page ID\n#:5761\n \n1 the very same claim, whether or not relitigation of the claim raises the same issues \n2 as the earlier suit.’”  Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, 892 (2008) (quoting New \n3 Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 748 (2001)).  “Claim preclusion requires three \n4 things: (1) identity of claims; (2) a final judgment on the merits; and (3) the same \n5 parties, or privity between the parties.”  Harris v. Cty. of Orange, 682 F.3d 1126, \n6 1132 (9th Cir. 2012).  \n7   The last two requirements are straightforwardly satisfied here.  On the second \n8 requirement, the Ninth Circuit has treated the Flores Settlement as a consent decree, \n9 and it is therefore a final judgment on the merits.  See Flores v. Lynch, 828 F.3d 898, \n10 905 (9th Cir. 2016) (stating “[t]he Settlement is a consent decree”); see also Rufo v. \n11 Inmates of Suffolk Cnty. Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 378 (1992) (a consent decree is “an \n12 agreement that the parties desire and expect will be reflected in, and be enforceable \n13 as,  a  judicial  decree  that  is  subject  to  the  rules  generally  applicable  to  other \n14 judgments  and  decrees”).    The  Flores  Settlement  additionally  states  that  it \n15 “constitutes a full and complete resolution of the issues raised in th[e] action.”  \n16 Flores Settlement, pp. 3-4.  \n17 On the third requirement, the members of the step-up class are Flores class \n18 members, so they are in privity with the Flores class.  See Ho by Ho v. San Francisco \n19 Unified School Dist., 965 F. Supp. 1316, 1321 (N.D. Cal 1997) (in a class action, the \n20 judgment “binds all class members on every matter which was or could have been \n21 offered to sustain or defeat the claims sued upon”).  Paragraph 10 of the Flores \n22 Settlement defines the Flores class as “[a]ll minors who are detained in the legal \n23 custody of” ORR (previously the INS).2  The Lucas R. step-up class comprises “all \n24\n                                                 \n25 2 As explained, the HSA transferred responsibilities for the care of UACs from the \nINS to ORR, see 6 U.S.C. §§ 279(a), (b)(1)(A), (g)(2), and the HSA’s savings clause \n26\npreserves administrative actions to which INS was a party,  see id. § 552(a)(1) \n27 (incorporated by reference into 6 U.S.C. § 279(f)(2)).  This includes agreements to \nwhich INS was a party, such as the Flores Settlement, as set forth in paragraph 41 \n28\nof the Settlement.  See id. § 552(a)(2).   \n15 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 24 of 69   Page ID\n#:5762\n \n1 minors in ORR custody . . . who are or will be placed in a secure facility, medium-\n2 secure facility, or [residential treatment center], or whom ORR has continued to \n3 detain in any such facility for more than 30 days, without being afforded notice and \n4 an opportunity to be heard before a neutral and detached decisionmaker regarding \n5 the grounds for such placement.”  Order at 27.  All step-up class members are in \n6 ORR custody.  The step-class is therefore a subset of the Flores class, and there is \n7 privity between the parties in the two suits. \n8 On the first requirement for res judicata, there is an identity of claims between \n9 the step-up class’s claim and the claims resolved in the Flores Settlement.  In \n10 assessing whether there is an identity of claims between suits, the Court considers: \n11 (a) whether rights or interests established in the prior judgment would be destroyed \n12 or impaired by prosecution of the second action; (b) whether substantially the same \n13 evidence  is  presented  in  the  two  actions;  (c) whether  the  two  suits  involve \n14 infringement of the same right; and (d) whether the two suits arise out of the same \n15 transactional nucleus of facts.  Howard v. City of Coos Bay, 871 F.3d 1032, 1039 \n16 (9th Cir. 2017).  “These criteria are not applied mechanistically,” and “[t]he fourth \n17 criterion is the most important.”  Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).  \n18 All four factors establish an identity of claims between Flores and the step-up \n19 class.  First, rights established under the Flores Settlement would be impaired by the \n20 step-up  class’s  claim.    The  Flores  Settlement  authorizes  the  government,  in \n21 resolution of Plaintiffs’ due process claim, to place a minor in a restrictive facility \n22 “whenever”  ORR  determines  the  minor  has  met  the  criteria  articulated  in  the \n23 Settlement (¶ 21), subject to two provisions: (1) that “[a]ll determinations to place a \n24 minor in a secure facility will be reviewed and approved by the regional juvenile \n25 coordinator”  (¶ 23)  and  (2)  that  placement  determinations  may  potentially  be \n26 challenged through bond hearings (¶ 24A).  ORR’s placement authority, and the \n27 limitations on that authority, are thus part of the Flores Settlement.  Upsetting that \n28\n16 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 25 of 69   Page ID\n#:5763\n \n1 authority—as Plaintiffs here seek to do—would impair rights established under \n2 Flores.  See Compl. ¶ 126. \n3 Second, the two actions involve substantially the same evidence.  Both Flores \n4 and the step-up class’s claim involve the procedures due process requires ORR to \n5 provide minors for challenging the government’s decision to place a minor in a more \n6 restrictive  facility.    This  is  articulated  in  paragraph  69  of  the  original  Flores \n7 complaint,  which  challenges  the  government’s  procedures  for  placing  detained \n8 minors in restrictive settings, and in the preamble of the Settlement, which states that \n9 “Plaintiffs have filed this action against Defendants, challenging, inter alia, the \n10 constitutionality of Defendants’ policies, practices and regulations regarding the \n11 detention and release of unaccompanied minors.”  Settlement at 3 (emphasis added).  \n12 The parties also agreed in the Settlement that, in making placement decisions, the \n13 government  will  consider  whether  the  minor  poses  a  danger  to  self  or  others, \n14 including whether the minor “has been charged with, is chargeable, or has been \n15 convicted of a crime” or “is chargeable with a delinquent act” (¶ 21).  This is the \n16 same standard articulated in the ORR Guide § 1.2.4, which also considers whether \n17 the minor “poses a danger to self or others.”  Thus, the question of what evidence \n18 the government should consider and what procedures it should follow in making \n19 placement decisions, as well as what processes it must provide to minors seeking to \n20 challenge such a decision, is the same in both cases.   \n21 Third, Flores and the step-up class’s claim involve alleged infringement of \n22 the same right—the minor’s asserted due-process right to contest the agency’s \n23 placement decision.  The Flores parties agreed that minors were entitled to a bond \n24 hearing,  and  further  agreed  that  minors  could  challenge  individual  placement \n25 decisions in a court with jurisdiction and venue to hear their claims (¶ 24), which the \n26 parties agreed satisfied due process in order to resolve the suit, which was also \n27 brought on due-process grounds.  Further, in holding that the immigration bond \n28 hearings under ¶ 24A were not terminated by the TVPRA, the Ninth Circuit reasoned \n17 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 26 of 69   Page ID\n#:5764\n \n1 that these hearings were necessary because they “provide an opportunity to contest \n2 the basis of such confinement” and “ensure[ ] that [UACs] are not held in secure \n3 detention  without  cause,”  and  that  these  hearings  “provide[  ]  meaningful \n4 protections” against arbitrary decisionmaking.  Flores, 862 F.3d at 868.   \n5 Finally, the two actions arise out of the same transactional nucleus of facts.  \n6 Both Flores and the step-up class ask the Court to address the procedures that due \n7 process requires when a minor wants to challenge his or her placement in a restrictive \n8 setting while in federal custody.  The Flores Settlement sets forth processes for such \n9 placement decisions and for review of those decisions (¶¶ 21-24).  In both Flores \n10 and this case, the factual scenario before the Court—the placement of a minor in a \n11 restrictive setting and the processes for review of such a placement—is the same.  \n12 Accordingly, there is identity of claims between Flores and the step-up class. \n13 All the requirements for claim preclusion are satisfied for the step-up class’s \n14 claim.  Thus, res judicata applies and bars the step-up class from seeking additional \n15 procedures beyond those already provided in the Flores Settlement without the \n16 Court first terminating the Flores Settlement.3 Order 9-11. \n17 2) ORR’s  policies  and  procedures  for  the  step-up  class  satisfy  due \nprocess as a matter of law. \n18\n19 Defendants are also entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the step-up \n20 class’s due-process claim because ORR’s policies and procedures for placement of \n21 minors in a restrictive setting satisfy due process as a matter of law.  The Court \n22 weighs three factors in assessing whether the procedures the government provides \n23 comport with due process: “First, the private interest that will be affected by the \n24 official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through \n25 the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute \n                                                 \n26\n3 If Plaintiffs are actually asserting that ORR is violating the Flores Settlement, e.g., \n27 Compl. ¶ 126 (“ORR regularly places children in RTCs, secure and medium-secure \nfacilities . . . contrary to immigration judges’ determinations”), they must bring those \n28\nclaims in an enforcement action in Flores itself. \n \n18 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 27 of 69   Page ID\n#:5765\n \n1 procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government’s interest, including the function \n2 involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute \n3 procedural  requirement  would  entail.”    Mathews,  424  U.S.  at  335.    The \n4 government’s strong interests in protecting children in its care and the thorough \n5 procedures ORR follows in making placement decisions demonstrate that ORR’s \n6 step-up procedures satisfy due process as a matter of law. \n7 a.  Private interests \n8\nTo start, the private interests that Plaintiffs allege have limited force as applied \n9\nto ORR step-up decisions.  Plaintiffs contend that minors in ORR care have two \n10\nprotected liberty interests that are relevant to the step-up claim: (1) a statutory \n11\ninterest  under  the  TVPRA  and  a  related  contractual  interest  under  the  Flores \n12\nSettlement to be placed in the “least restrictive setting”; and (2) a due-process \n13\ninterest in being free from “unnecessary physical restraints, including placement in \n14\nRTCs, medium-secure or secure facilities.”  Comp. ¶¶ 117-19, 122.  Both interests \n15\nhave limited weight as applied to Plaintiffs’ step-up claim and, as explained below, \n16\nare decisively outweighed by the other Mathews factors. \n17\nFirst, Plaintiffs have at most a limited interest under the TVPRA in placement \n18\n“in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child.”  8 U.S.C. \n19\n§ 1232(c)(2)(A).    A  statute  creates  a  protected  liberty  interest  only  when  it: \n20\n(1) establishes “‘substantive predicates’ to govern official decision-making,” and \n21\n(2) uses  “‘explicitly  mandatory  language,’  i.e.,  specific  directives  to  the \n22\ndecisionmaker that if the regulations’ substantive predicates are present, a particular \n23\noutcome must follow.”  Kentucky Dep’t of Corrections v. Thompson, 490 U.S. 454, \n24\n462-63  (1989)  (internal  citations  omitted).  Even  if  the  TVPRA  establishes \n25\n“substantive predicates”—i.e., that a UAC “shall be promptly placed in the least \n26\nrestrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child,” subject to considerations \n27\nof “danger to self, danger to the community, and risk of flight”—it contains no \n28\n“explicitly mandatory language” that provides that, when “substantive predicates are \n19 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 28 of 69   Page ID\n#:5766\n \n1 present,  a  particular  outcome  must  follow.”    8  U.S.C.  § 1232(c)(2)(A).    The \n2 TVPRA’s use of the word “shall” does not mandate a particular outcome.  See \n3 Connecticut  Bd.  of  Pardons  v.  Dumschat,  452  U.S.  458,  466  (1981).    The \n4 “‘expectation of receiving process is not, without more, a liberty interest protected \n5 by the Due Process Clause’ of the Fourteenth Amendment.”  Carver v. Lehman, 558 \n6 F.3d 869, 875 (9th Cir. 2009) (quoting Olim v. Wakinekona, 461 U.S. 238, 250-51 \n7 n. 12 (1983)).  Here, the TVPRA uses broad language that directs the Secretary to \n8 consider “danger” to self or others in making placement decisions and delegates to \n9 the Secretary equally broad authority to “prescribe” the “procedures” used to review \n10 secure placements and determine if the “placement remains warranted.”  8 U.S.C. \n11 § 1232(c)(2)(A).  The statute does not mandate a particular outcome or require ORR \n12 to adopt a particular set of procedures.  See Hayward v. Marshall, 603 F.3d 546, 560 \n13 (9th Cir. 2010) (holding that because parole is a discretionary, predictive decision, \n14 it does not create a protected liberty interest) (en banc).  Thus, the TVPRA does not \n15 create a protected liberty interest in placement in a non-restrictive setting. \n16 Plaintiffs’ claimed liberty interest under the Flores Settlement similarly fails.   \n17 Even if a consent decree could confer a protected liberty interest in limited instances, \n18 it does not do so here.  To begin, although the Ninth Circuit has suggested that \n19 Thompson’s two-part test for ascertaining protected liberty interests can, under some \n20 circumstances, be applied to consent decrees, see Smith v. Sumner, 994 F.2d 1401, \n21 1405-06 (9th Cir. 1993), the Ninth Circuit has never held that a consent decree can \n22 expand  on  itself,  creating  protected  liberty  interests  that  mandate  additional \n23 procedures the parties never negotiated or agreed upon.  To hold otherwise would \n24 be to contravene the rule that a “consent decree, like a contract, must be discerned \n25 within its four corners.”  United States v. Asarco Inc., 430 F.3d 972, 980 (9th Cir. \n26 2005).  It would also conflict with this Court’s ruling in Flores that procedural \n27 remedies (like the ones sought here) are not available to Plaintiffs for violations of \n28 the Settlement.  See Flores v. Barr, Case No. 2:85-cv-04544, ECF No. 470 at 2-3 \n20 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 29 of 69   Page ID\n#:5767\n \n1 (July 30, 2018).  Further, Smith was a case about jury instructions, not nationwide \n2 injunctive relief, and the court in that case ruled that the consent decree at issue did \n3 not create the claimed liberty interest.  Smith, 994 F.2d at 1407 (holding “the right \n4 to retain counsel conferred by the consent decree is not itself a protected liberty \n5 interest.”). \n6 And in any event, the Flores Settlement does not create a protected liberty \n7 interest under Thompson’s two-part test because as with the TVPRA, it does not \n8 contain  “explicitly  mandatory  language”  that  when  “substantive  predicates  are \n9 present, a particular outcome must follow.”  Thompson, 490 U.S. at 463.  Paragraph \n10 19 of the Settlement provides that UACs “shall be placed temporarily in a licensed \n11 program until such time as release can be effected in accordance with Paragraph 14” \n12 except  in  circumstances  articulated under Paragraph 21.  Paragraph  21 in turn \n13 delegates broad authority to the government to place a UAC in a secure facility, \n14 including when the minor “has committed, or has made credible threats to commit, \n15 a violent or malicious act” or “has engaged, while in a licensed program, in conduct \n16 that has proven to be unacceptably disruptive of the normal functioning of the \n17 licensed program” (¶¶ 24B, 24C), and again does not mandate a particular outcome \n18 or set of procedures.  See Hayward, 603 F.3d at 560.  Thus, like the TVPRA, the \n19 Flores Settlement also does not create a protected liberty interest in placement in a \n20 non-restrictive setting.  \n21 Second,  Plaintiffs’  asserted  due-process  interest  in  freedom  from \n22 “unnecessary  physical  restraint”  has  limited  force  as  applied  to  ORR  step-up \n23 decisions.  The Supreme Court has recognized that children, “unlike adults, are \n24 always in some form of custody.”  Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. at 302; Schall v. Martin, \n25 467 U.S. 253, 265 (1984).  Thus, every child’s interest in freedom from custody is \n26 constrained, whether that child is in ORR custody by statutory mandate or in the \n27 custody of a private guardian.   \n28\n21 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 30 of 69   Page ID\n#:5768\n \n1 Further, even if UACs in ORR care have a general liberty interest in freedom \n2 from “unnecessary physical restraint,” this liberty interest is different from (and \n3 weaker than) the liberty interests of minors in other juvenile detention contexts.  See \n4 Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U.S. 787, 792 (1977) (quoting Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67, 79-\n5 80)  (1976)  (“[I]n  the  exercise  of  its  broad  power  over  immigration  and \n6 naturalization,  ‘Congress  regularly  makes  rules  that  would  be  unacceptable  if \n7 applied to citizens.’”).  In other juvenile detention contexts, the minor is coercively \n8 confined with no ability to secure his or her release.  See, e.g., In re Gault, 387 U.S. \n9 1 (1967).  The minor thus has no control over the length (or terms) of his or her \n10 detention, and additional, procedural safeguards are warranted to ensure that the \n11 greater loss of liberty comports with due process.  Minors in the ORR context, by \n12 contrast, lack the same liberty deprivation, because a UAC can obtain release from \n13 custody  by  applying  for  and  obtaining  lawful  immigration  status,  voluntarily \n14 departing the United States, or obtaining ORR approval for a sponsor to take custody \n15 of the UAC—none of these options are available in the juvenile detention context.  \n16 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229c, 1232(a)(5)(D); 8 C.F.R. § 240.25; cf. Parra v. Perryman, 172 \n17 F.3d 954, 958 (7th Cir. 1999) (“An alien in Parra’s position can withdraw his defense \n18 of the removal proceeding and return home to his native land, thus ending his \n19 detention immediately.  He has the keys in his pocket.”). A UAC remains in ORR \n \n20 custody only until the UAC (or a person acting on the UAC’s behalf) accomplishes \n21 one of the above actions.  And until the UAC does so, ORR is charged by Congress \n22 with overseeing the UAC’s care and custody, which includes placing the minor in a \n23 setting that ensures the minor is not a danger to themselves or others.  8 U.S.C. \n24 § 1232(c)(2)(A).   \n25 Minors in ORR care who are stepped-up to more restrictive settings are also \n26 already subject to a form of governmental custody prior to step-up.  This differs \n27 from minors in the domestic juvenile-justice context.  Unless the minor is already in \n28 a state child welfare system, prior to placement in an institutional setting, such \n22 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 31 of 69   Page ID\n#:5769\n \n1 minors are not in any sort of institutional care, as was the case in Gault, 387 U.S. at \n2 4-5, where the minor resided with his parents.  Thus, the comparative loss of liberty \n3 for minors in ORR care who are stepped up to more restrictive settings is generally \n4 less than for domestic minors entering the juvenile-justice system from living with \n5 their parents or legal guardians.  Cf. United States v. Johnson, 28 F.3d 151, 155 (D.C. \n6 Cir.  1994)  (noting  that  under  D.C.  law,  “judges  may  impose  a  wide  range  of \n7 dispositions on juveniles who are adjudged delinquent.  The nature of confinement \n8 may vary considerably.  Juveniles may be placed in foster care, or in group homes, \n9 or in residential treatment centers, or in secure prison-like facilities.”). \n10 Plaintiffs’ asserted interest in freedom from “unnecessary physical restraint” \n11 is also weaker for members of the step-up class who are in ORR state-licensed \n12 residential  treatment  centers  as  compared  to  domestic  juveniles  who  are \n13 involuntarily committed to mental hospitals.  Unlike the mental-hospital context \n14 described in Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584 (1979), the two residential treatment \n15 centers in the ORR network are based on a group home model where residents sleep \n16 without locked doors and there is a higher staff-to-minor ratio than in shelters.  U.F. \n17 ¶ 48.4  An ORR residential treatment center also differs significantly from the \n18 involuntary  psychiatric  hospitalization described  in  Parham  because  it  is  more \n19 home-like and less institutionalized than a hospital, while providing comprehensive \n20 inpatient care.  See U.F. ¶¶ 44-45.  In addition, unlike involuntary commitment at a \n21 psychiatric hospital, care at an ORR residential treatment center has community \n22 connections that provide holistic support to treat UACs with significant emotional, \n23 intellectual, or developmental needs.  U.F. ¶ 44. And residential treatment centers, \n24\n25                                                  \n4 Parham, like Gault, was decided long before the Flores Settlement was entered \n26\ninto in 1997.  Plaintiffs’ counsel in Flores did not negotiate for the procedures \n27 recognized in Parham or Gault, and Congress did not mandate those procedures for \nUACs in ORR care in the TVPRA or the HSA.  Both features weigh against the \n28\nconclusion that, 23 years later, due process now mandates those procedures. \n23 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 32 of 69   Page ID\n#:5770\n \n1 with greater staff training and ratios, are better equipped to care for youth with more \n2 serious psychiatric problems when compared with shelters.  U.F. ¶ 76. \n3 Plaintiffs’ asserted interest in freedom from “unnecessary physical restraint” \n4 is even weaker for members of the step-up class who are in staff-secure facilities.  \n5 Notably, no class representative was stepped up to a staff-secure facility.  Further, \n6 staff-secure facilities do not impose physical restraints, with the main difference \n7 from a shelter being that the staff-to-child ratio is higher in staff-secure facilities.  \n8 U.F.  ¶¶  37-39.    Compared  to  shelters,  staff-secure  facilities  merely  provide  a \n9 heightened level of staff supervision, increased communication, and services to \n10 control problem behavior and prevent escape.  U.F. ¶ 38.  Staff-secure facilities are \n11 not equipped internally with multiple locked pods or cell units, and, in almost all \n12 states, staff-secure providers maintain an identical type of license as a non-secure \n13 care provider, and for such purposes are not viewed as different from a non-secure \n14 care provider.  U.F. ¶¶ 39-40.  Notably, Congress did not require any additional \n15 procedures under the TVPRA for staff-secure placements, mandating only that ORR \n16 undertake monthly review of the “placement of a child in a secure facility.”  8 U.S.C. \n17 § 1232(c)(2)(A).  Accordingly, given the limited force of Plaintiffs’ asserted liberty \n18 interests as applied to the step-up claim, the first element of the Mathews test, the \n19 private interests at stake, weighs against finding that ORR’s step-up procedures \n20 violate procedural due process. \n21 To the extent that Plaintiffs assert a substantive-due-process right to “freedom \n22 from unnecessary physical restraint” (Compl. ¶ 122), that claim also fails as a matter \n23 of law.  A substantive-due-process right is one “so rooted in the traditions and \n24 conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.”  United States v. Salerno, \n25 481  U.S.  739,  751  (1987)  (internal  quotations  omitted).    If  Plaintiffs  assert  a \n26 substantive-due-process right here, the Fifth Amendment “forbids the government \n27 to infringe [upon that right] at all, no matter what process is provided, unless the \n28 infringement is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.”  Reno v. \n24 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 33 of 69   Page ID\n#:5771\n \n1 Flores, 507 U.S. at 302 (emphasis in original).  Among other things, such a claim \n2 would be inconsistent with Plaintiffs’ requested relief in their complaint, which only \n3 seeks additional procedures: “Due process requires that ORR give Plaintiffs and \n4 their proposed class members meaningful notice and an opportunity to be heard \n5 before it places them in RTCs, medium-secure or secure facilities and an ongoing \n6 review with commensurate protections every thirty days.”  Compl. ¶ 122.  Even \n7 assuming Plaintiffs assert a substantive-due-process right for the step-up class, such \n8 a claim cannot be squared with the Supreme Court’s holding in Reno v. Flores.  \n9 There, the Court ruled that the plaintiffs’ asserted substantive-due-process right to \n10 “freedom from physical restraint” failed because “where the government does not \n11 intend to punish the child, and where the conditions of governmental custody are \n12 decent and humane, such custody surely does not violate the Constitution.”  507 U.S. \n13 at  303.    As  explained,  when  ORR  places  a  child  in  a  secure,  staff-secure,  or \n14 residential-treatment-center facility, it does so to protect the welfare of the child (and \n15 other children in ORR care) and to prevent flight risk, not to punish the child.  See  \n16 U.F. ¶¶ 36, 52; 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(2)(A).  Nor do any of these facilities involve \n17 inhumane conditions as described in Reno v. Flores.  See U.F. ¶¶ 8, 10-11.  Thus, \n18 any substantive-due-process claim for the step-up class fails as a matter of law.  See \n19 also  Reno  v.  Flores,  507  U.S.  at  305  (“If  we  harbored  any  doubt  as  to  the \n20 constitutionality of institutional custody over unaccompanied juveniles, they would \n21 surely be eliminated as to those juveniles . . . who are aliens.”).   \n22 b. Risk of erroneous deprivation \n23\nThe  second  Mathews  factor,  “the  risk  of  an  erroneous  deprivation  of  [a \n24\nprotected] interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of \n25\nadditional or substitute procedural  safeguards,” strongly  weighs in Defendants’ \n26\nfavor.  424 U.S. at 335.  ORR provides thorough, effective procedures that balance \n27\nnumerous important child-welfare considerations while also providing UACs with \n28\n25 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 34 of 69   Page ID\n#:5772\n \n1 notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard regarding their placement within 30 \n2 days.   \n3 First, ORR provides notice to minors who are stepped-up.  ORR policy and \n4 practice requires that every minor placed in a staff-secure, secure, or a residential-\n5 treatment-center facility receive a Notice of Placement within 48 hours of placement, \n6 which is provided to counsel on demand.  U.F. ¶¶ 54-55; J.S. ¶ 76.  This Notice \n7 explains why the minor has been placed in a more restrictive setting, the minor’s \n8 ability to seek review in court, and the minor’s ability to seek review before the ORR \n9 Director.  U.F. ¶¶ 54, 56, 64; J.S. ¶ 76.  The Notice is provided in English and \n10 Spanish,  and  is  translated  and  explained  for  children  who  do  not  speak  either \n11 language.  U.F. ¶¶ 54, 57. \n12 Second, ORR provides UACs who are stepped up with multiple opportunities \n13 to be heard before a neutral and detached decisionmaker.  A UAC may seek a Flores \n14 bond hearing before  an immigration judge at any time.  U.F. ¶ 65;  J.S.  ¶ 83.  \n15 Although the immigration judge’s decision in bond hearings does not bind ORR, \n16 ORR considers the decision in setting the level of placement.  U.F. ¶ 66.  “The [bond] \n17 hearing is a forum in which a child has the right to be represented by counsel, and to \n18 have the merits of his or her detention assessed by an independent immigration \n19 judge.”  Flores, 862 F.3d at 867.  Paragraph 24B of the Flores Settlement also \n20 provides UACs the ability to seek judicial review of placement decisions, which are \n21 reviewed for abuse of discretion (¶ 24C).  U.F. ¶ 63.  Flores bond hearings and \n22 judicial proceedings are both hearings before a neutral decisionmaker, and both can \n23 take place within 30 days of placement at the UAC’s request.   \n24 ORR also provides UACs placed in a secure or residential-treatment-center \n25 facility with an internal administrative appeal process 30 days after placement, \n26 through which the UAC can either request a hearing or submit a written statement.  \n27 See U.F. ¶¶ 67, 70-71.  The appeal panel comprises three experienced ORR staff \n28 members with extensive child-welfare and mental-health backgrounds, and ORR \n26 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 35 of 69   Page ID\n#:5773\n \n1 provides the minor and the minor’s attorney of record with any evidence supporting \n2 the minor’s continued placement before the hearing.  U.F. ¶¶ 68-69.  UACs without \n3 an attorney are appointed a child advocate or can ask the juvenile coordinator—a \n4 contractor  appointed  to  monitor  compliance  with  the  terms  of  the  Flores \n5 Settlement—to assist them, and the panel issues a written decision at the conclusion \n6 of the hearing.  U.F. ¶¶ 72-74.  \n7 ORR has additional procedures that it follows before transferring a minor to \n8 a residential treatment center.  Because Congress has assigned ORR the role of the \n9 child’s custodian, ORR may, as a general matter, consent to the child’s placement in \n10 a residential treatment center.  Cf. Parham, 442 U.S. at 619 (“the state agency having \n11 custody and control of the child in loco parentis has a duty to consider the best \n12 interests of the child with respect to a decision on commitment to a mental hospital,” \n13 and thus “the State may constitutionally allow that custodial agency to speak for the \n14 child, subject, of course, to the restrictions governing natural parents”).  Further, \n15 before  placing  a  child  in  residential  treatment,  ORR  also  requires  a  licensed \n16 psychologist or psychiatrist to determine that the decision is medically indicated, \n17 and a UAC may remain in residential treatment only if the licensed psychologist or \n18 psychiatrist determines the child remains a danger to self or others.  See U.F. ¶¶ 46-\n19 47; J.S. ¶¶ 54-55.  Notably, for each class representative placed in a residential \n20 treatment center, a licensed psychologist or psychiatrist determined that such a \n21 placement was necessary because the child had serious mental health needs that \n22 made them a danger to themselves or others.  See U.F. ¶¶ 109 (Lucas R.), 125 \n23 (Daniela Marisol T.), 140 (Gabriela N.), 143-44 (Sirena P.), 145-46 (Benjamin F.).  \n24 This satisfies due process.  Cf. Parham, 442 U.S. at 606-07 (“some kind of inquiry \n25 should be made by a ‘neutral factfinder’ to determine whether statutory requirements \n26 for admission are satisfied,” and “a staff physician will suffice, so long as he or she \n27 is free to evaluate independently the child’s mental and emotional condition and \n28 need for treatment”).   \n27 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 36 of 69   Page ID\n#:5774\n \n1 Third, step-up decisions are subject to extensive internal review procedures, \n2 both before and after step-up, involving multiple decisionmakers to ensure that \n3 placements reflect sound clinical judgment.  U.F. ¶¶ 24, 79.  Any request that a case \n4 manager makes to transfer a minor to a more restrictive setting must be reviewed by \n5 a case coordinator and approved by the federal field specialist.5  U.F. ¶¶ 13-16, 49-\n6 51; J.S. ¶¶ 7-10.  In deciding whether to approve a step-up request, the federal field \n7 specialist may consult with numerous individuals, including a supervisor, a federal \n8 field  specialist  supervisor  for  special  populations,  and  the  senior  federal  field \n9 specialist supervisor, as well as the ORR Division of Policies and Procedures.  U.F. \n10 ¶ 53.  Further, ORR Guide § 1.4.2 requires step-up determinations to be reviewed \n11 by the case manager, case coordinator, and federal field specialist at least every 30 \n12 days to determine whether the child should remain in his or her current placement, \n13 and § 1.4.7 allows a UAC to seek reconsideration of placement at a secure or \n14 residential-treatment-center  facility  from  the  ORR  Director  (the  only  review \n15 expressly required under the TVPRA § 235(c)(2)(A)).  U.F. ¶¶ 60, 64.  Before their \n16 30-day review, case managers meet with the UAC to discuss their behavior and \n17 needs, inform them of their upcoming review, and inform them of the bases for \n18 determining whether their continued placement remains warranted.  U.F. ¶ 61.  If a \n19 decision is made to continue the UAC’s current placement, the case manager, case \n20 coordinator, and federal field specialist must document the reasons why in a new \n21 Notice of Placement.  U.F. ¶ 62.  At least every 30 days, ORR also separately reviews \n22 each Notice of Placement through an internal monitoring panel for compliance with \n23                                                  \n5 Case managers are grantee facility employees who are approved by ORR, and are \n24\nrequired to take 40-hours of annual training on all aspects of the UAC program.  U.F. \n25 ¶¶ 14-15; J.S. ¶ 8.  Case coordinators are third-party contractors who are assigned to \none or more ORR care provider facilities to review children’s cases and provide \n26\nindependent recommendations to ORR staff on transfer and release.  U.F. ¶¶ 16, 29; \n27 J.S.  ¶¶  9-10.    Federal  field  specialists  are  located  throughout  the  country  and \nassigned to a group of ORR grantee care providers within a particular geographic \n28\nregion.

U.F. ¶¶ 58-59.  And if a UAC has resided in a secure or residential-\n5 treatment-center facility for more than 90 days, ORR requires the federal field \n6 specialist to consult with supervisory ORR staff about the reasons for the continued \n7 placement.  J.S. ¶ 86. \n8 Given ORR’s extensive procedures for determining whether a child in ORR \n9 care should be stepped up to a more restrictive setting, and the multiple levels of \n10 review that ORR provides UACs to challenge placement decisions, “the risk of an \n11 erroneous  deprivation  of  such  interest  through  the  procedures  used”  is  low.  \n12 Mathews, 424 U.S. at 334.  There is no genuine dispute of material fact that the \n13 probability  of  step-up  to  a  more  restrictive  facility  for  any  individual  UAC  is \n14 exceedingly low, particularly when compared to children in domestic child-welfare \n15 systems.  See U.F. ¶¶ 98-103; J.S. ¶ 91.  In fiscal year 2020 (through June 2020), \n16 only 56 out of 14,421 placements were to secure settings (0.39%).  U.F. ¶¶ 98, 101.  \n17 Even when UACs in residential treatment centers are included, the percentage of \n18 UACs in ORR care who have been stepped up is 0.55%: through June 2020 (80 out \n19 of 14,421 placements).  U.F. ¶¶ 98, 100-01.  And even when UACs in staff-secure \n20 facilities are included, the percentage of UACs who have been stepped up is only \n21 1.6%: through June 2020 (236 out of 14,421 placements).  U.F. ¶¶ 98, 99-101.  This \n22 is  compared  to  a  step-up  rate of  approximately  14  percent  for  children  in  the \n23 domestic child-welfare context.  U.F. ¶ 103; Dr. Ryan Expert Report ¶ 35 (“one \n24 would likely conclude, as I do, that stepping UAC up to more secure settings is not \n25 overused”).  Thus, the risk of erroneous deprivation based on ORR step-up decisions \n26 is very low. \n27 Further, of the small fraction of children in ORR care who are stepped up, the \n28 overwhelming majority are stepped up only after more than two months in shelter \n29 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 38 of 69   Page ID\n#:5776\n \n1 care (86%), indicating that shelter staff and ORR work to accommodate the needs \n2 of children before placing them in a more restrictive facility.  See U.F. ¶ 104.  Of the \n3 named Plaintiffs, only one, Jaime D., was stepped up to a secure facility, and that \n4 happened only after  he told shelter staff that he was a gang  member and had \n5 murdered 4 people in his home country on their behalf—a placement decision with \n6 which both the third-party case coordinator and the federal field specialist concurred.  \n7 See U.F. ¶¶ 114-17.  Importantly, Jaime D. was stepped back down within about 30 \n8 days after he recanted those statements, showing that ORR’s robust review process \n9 was both responsive and efficient.  See U.F. ¶¶ 119-22.  And as noted above, of the \n10 named Plaintiffs who were stepped up to a residential treatment center, all were \n11 stepped up only at the authorization of a qualified medical professional, and only \n12 after a recommendation was made by the third-party case coordinator and shelter \n13 staff, and approved by ORR.  See U.F. ¶¶ 109, 125, 130-32, 140, 143-46.  These \n14 undisputed facts further confirm that the risk of erroneous deprivation under ORR’s \n15 current procedures is low.  See U.F. ¶ 79. \n16 The “probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards,” \n17 Mathews, 424 U.S. at 335, is also low, particularly given that ORR already provides \n18 UACs what Plaintiffs claim that due process requires: notice and an opportunity to \n19 be heard within 30 days of step-up.  See Compl. ¶ 122 (“Due process requires that \n20 ORR give Plaintiffs and their proposed class members meaningful notice and an \n21 opportunity to be heard before it places them in RTCs, medium-secure or secure \n22 facilities and an ongoing review with commensurate protections every thirty days.”).  \n23 Although Plaintiffs identify a number of procedures that ORR allegedly does not \n24 provide, including “an opportunity to present evidence and witnesses” and “the right \n25 to counsel” (Compl. ¶ 124), they do not contend that due process requires these other \n26 procedures, or that they are asking the Court to order those specific procedures.  See \n27 King v. Atiyeh, 814 F.2d 565, 567 (9th Cir. 1987) (“All causes of action alleged in \n28 an original complaint which are not alleged in an amended complaint are waived.”).  \n30 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 39 of 69   Page ID\n#:5777\n \n1 Thus, any claim for procedures beyond notice and an opportunity to be heard within \n2 30 days of step-up are not properly before the Court.   \n3 Indeed, the Court’s certified class definition makes no mention of these other \n4 procedures, as it comprises only “minors in ORR custody pursuant to 6 U.S.C. \n5 section 279 and/or 8 U.S.C. section 1232 who are or will be placed in a secure \n6 facility, medium-secure facility, or RTC, or whom ORR has continued to detain in \n7 any such facility for more than 30 days, without being afforded notice and an \n8 opportunity to be heard before a neutral and detached decisionmaker regarding the \n9 grounds for such placement . . . .”  Order at 27.  And as explained, ORR satisfies the \n10 relief set forth in the class definition, providing minors numerous opportunities to \n11 be heard before a neutral and detached decisionmaker within 30 days of step-up.  \n12 Any additional procedures Plaintiffs might seek are outside the class definition and \n13 beyond the scope of this case.  See Al Otro Lado, Inc. v. McAleenan, 423 F.Supp.3d \n14 848, 878 (S.D. Cal. 2019) (holding that “the scope of the injunctive relief is limited \n15 by  the  class  definition”).    In  any  event,  the probable value of such additional \n16 procedures is very low.  The second Mathews factor strongly favors Defendants. \n17\nc.  The government’s interest \n18\nThe final Mathews factor, the government’s interest, also strongly favors \n19\nDefendants and, when balanced against the other factors, confirms that Defendants \n20\nare entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  ORR, acting in loco parentis, has an \n21\ninterest in each UAC’s welfare as the child’s custodian and in the safety and well-\n22\nbeing of other children in its care.  Congress prescribed by statute ORR’s interest \n23\nregarding all children in its care when it directed ORR to consider children’s safety \n24\nwhen making placement decisions: “In making such placements, the Secretary may \n25\nconsider danger to self, danger to the community, and risk of flight.”  8 U.S.C. \n26\n§ 1232(c)(2)(A).  To promote the safety of all children in its care, ORR must be able \n27\nto place children in appropriate settings, promptly and without undue delay, to avoid \n28\n31 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 40 of 69   Page ID\n#:5778\n \n1 serious harm to the child and others in ORR’s care.  U.F. ¶¶ 41-43, 75-78.  As \n2 explained,  ORR’s  robust  procedures  already  minimize  the  risk  of  erroneous \n3 deprivation; any additional procedures would delay ORR’s ability to provide needed \n4 care and services.  And “[n]ormally when children are stepped up, particularly to a \n5 secure juvenile detention, but also to staff-secure, there is already considerable \n6 evidence that their behaviors are problematic, and time is of the essence.  Any delay \n7 in moving them . . . would put the children themselves at risk, other minors, and \n8 staff.”  Antkowiak Declaration ¶ 33; U.F. ¶¶ 77-78; see also Dr. Lubit Expert Report, \n9 ¶ 3(b) (“When UACs pose a threat to the health and safety of themselves or others, \n10 and the UACs cannot be maintained safely in a less restrictive setting, the UACs \n11 should go to a higher level of care.  Delaying step-ups to RTCs in these situations is \n12 contrary to acceptable practice because serious avoidable harm could occur during \n13 the period of delay.”).  Further, the financial burden on ORR in providing the \n14 additional procedures that Plaintiffs seek would be substantial.  In contrast with \n15 DHS, which has approximately 1,100 attorneys and 350 support personnel funded \n16 by congressional appropriations to represent DHS in administrative proceedings, \n17 ORR has traditionally funded only two dedicated attorneys, so any appreciable \n18 increase in administrative hearings would massively burden the agency.  U.F. ¶ 80.  \n19 Accordingly, the third Mathews strongly favors Defendants as well.   \n20 d. Balance of Mathews factors  \n21\nIn sum, the balance of Mathews factors conclusively favors Defendants.  First, \n22\nthe step-up class’s asserted liberty interests have limited force: (1) the TVPRA and \n23\nFlores Settlement do not create a protected liberty interest because they do not \n24\nmandate  any  particular outcome  or  procedures  for placing  UACs  in restrictive \n25\nsettings; and (2) Plaintiffs’ interest in being free from unnecessary physical restraints \n26\nis  weaker  in  the  ORR  setting  than  in  other  juvenile-detention  or  involuntary \n27\ncommitment settings because UACs in ORR custody have multiple paths to obtain \n28\nrelease from a restrictive placement.  Second, the risk of erroneous deprivation under \n32 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 41 of 69   Page ID\n#:5779\n \n1 ORR’s  procedures  is  low,  as  is  the  probable  value  of  mandating  additional \n2 procedures.  UACs in ORR care have multiple avenues to challenge placement \n3 decisions, and ORR already provides step-up class members with notice and an \n4 opportunity to be heard within 30 days.  UACs receive notice of the reasons for their \n5 placement within 48 hours, and UACs can challenge their placements at a bond \n6 hearing or in federal court.  U.F. ¶¶ 54, 63, 65; J.S. ¶¶ 76, 83.  UACs placed in secure \n7 and residential-treatment-center facilities also can seek an administrative hearing \n8 within 30 days before a three-member panel, and separately seek direct review by \n9 the ORR Director.  U.F. ¶¶ 64, 67.  Such placements are also reviewed at least every \n10 30 days by the federal field specialist, case coordinator, and case manager, and are \n11 separately reviewed by an ORR monitoring group within the same timeframe.  U.F. \n12 ¶¶ 58, 60.  Third, ORR’s interest in being able to make prompt placement decisions \n13 without  unnecessary  delay  is  substantial  and  outweighs  the  probable  value  of \n14 imposing  additional  procedures  that  will  delay  needed  care  and  treatment  and \n15 consume government resources without significantly reducing the likelihood of an \n16 erroneous deprivation.  ORR’s procedures for stepping up children in its care to more \n17 restrictive settings thus fully comport with due process, and Defendants are entitled \n18 to judgment as a matter of law on Plaintiffs’ step-up claim. \n19 3) ORR’s policies and procedures for the step-up class comport with the \nTVPRA and the APA.   \n20\n21 ORR’s policies and procedures for the step-up class also satisfy the TVPRA \n22 and APA as a matter of law.  First, ORR’s step-up policies and procedures comport \n23 with the TVPRA.  Plaintiffs’ claim that ORR’s “policy and practice individually and \n24 collectively violate” TVPRA § 235(c)(2)(A) is just their procedural-due-process \n25 claim  recast  as  a  purported  statutory  violation.    Compl.  ¶ 184.    Plaintiffs \n26 acknowledge that the TVPRA does not articulate a right to additional procedures to \n27 contest placement, but only mandates a review of secure placements every 30 days—\n28 which Defendants already provide.  See Compl. ¶ 119.  Rather, what Plaintiffs claim \n33 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 42 of 69   Page ID\n#:5780\n \n1 is that the TVPRA creates a liberty interest in being placed in the “least restrictive \n2 setting,” and that procedural due process therefore requires the imposition of the \n3 additional procedural remedies they might seek.  See Compl. ¶ 118.  But as explained \n4 above, ORR’s thorough procedures satisfy due process, balancing important child-\n5 welfare considerations with safety, while also providing UACs with notice and a \n6 meaningful opportunity to be heard within 30 days.  Second, ORR’s policies and \n7 procedures  for  the  step-up  class  also  comport  with  the  APA.    Compl.  ¶  184.  \n8 Plaintiffs make no independent claim under the APA beyond their procedural-due-\n9 process claim, which fails for the reasons described above, and the relief they seek \n10 under the APA is the same as the relief they seek on their due-process claim—notice \n11 and an opportunity to be heard.  Further, like the TVPRA, the APA does not \n12 separately impose additional procedural requirements on ORR placement decisions.  \n13 Thus, Plaintiffs’ step-up claims under the TVPRA and APA fail as a matter of law.   \n14 B.  Defendants Are Entitled to Judgment as a Matter of Law on the Unfit-\nCustodian Class’s Claim. \n15\n16 The Court should grant summary judgment on the unfit-custodian class’s \n17 claim that ORR’s procedures for making release decisions are unlawful because \n18 ORR does not provide a timely, meaningful opportunity to be heard when ORR \n19 delays or denies release to potential sponsors.  Compl. ¶¶ 179-81.  Plaintiffs’ unfit-\n20 custodian claim is barred by res judicata.  And ORR’s policies and procedures for \n21 this class satisfy due process and other legal requirements as a matter of law.  \n22 1) The unfit-custodian claim is barred by res judicata.   \n23\nThe Court should grant summary judgment for Defendants on the unfit-\n24\ncustodian claim because the claim——including the purported statutory aspects of \n25\ntheir  claim  that  simply  replicate  their  due-process  challenge—is  barred  by  res \n26\njudicata.    Their  claim  that  due  process  requires  the  imposition  of  additional \n27\nprocedures to challenge release decisions was conclusively resolved in Flores. \n28\n34 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 43 of 69   Page ID\n#:5781\n \n1 As noted above, claim preclusion requires: (1) identity of claims; (2) a final \n2 judgment on the merits; and (3) privity between the parties.  Harris, 682 F.3d at \n3 1132.  The second and third requirements are clearly satisfied here.  The Flores \n4 Settlement is a final judgment.  See supra Part A.  And there is privity between the \n5 parties:  the unfit-custodian class comprises all UACs in ORR custody “whom ORR \n6 is refusing or will refuse to release to parents or other available custodians within 30 \n7 days of the proposed custodian’s submission of a complete family reunification \n8 packet on the ground that the proposed custodian is or may be unfit.”  Order at 27.  \n9 The unfit-custodian class is therefore a subset of the Flores class—“‘[a]ll minors \n10 who are detained in the legal custody of the INS’” (¶ 10). \n11 There is also identity of claims.  All four factors for assessing identity of \n12 claims favor that conclusion.  See Howard, 871 F.3d at 1039.  First, rights established \n13 under the Flores Settlement would be destroyed or impaired by the unfit-custodian \n14 claim.  The Flores Settlement, in resolution of Plaintiffs’ due process claim, sets \n15 forth procedures governing release for all UACs in ORR care.  These procedures \n16 include that ORR must avoid “unnecessary delay” (¶ 14) and must “record” its \n17 release efforts (¶ 18).  Neither paragraph contains any requirement that ORR provide \n18 a  hearing  for  class  members  who  remain  in  custody  more  than  thirty  days.  \n19 Mandating different or additional procedures for the unfit-custodian class beyond \n20 those provided in the Flores Settlement would therefore impair or destroy rights \n21 established under the Settlement.  See Costantini v. Trans World Airlines, 681 F.2d \n22 1199, 1201 (9th Cir. 1982) (“[T]he doctrine of res judicata (or claim preclusion) \n23 ‘bar(s) all grounds for recovery which could have been asserted, whether they were \n24 or not, in a prior suit between the same parties . . . on the same cause of action.’”) \n25 (internal citations omitted). \n26 Second, the two actions involve substantially the same evidence.  Again, this \n27 is articulated in the Settlement: “Plaintiffs have filed this action against Defendants, \n28 challenging, inter alia, the constitutionality of Defendants’ policies, practices and \n35 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 44 of 69   Page ID\n#:5782\n \n1 regulations regarding the . . . release of unaccompanied minors.”  Settlement at 3 \n2 (emphasis added).  To assess whether to release a minor to a potential sponsor, ORR \n3 conducts a suitability analysis, which may include consideration of various factors \n4 outlined in ¶ 17 of the Settlement, such as the living conditions and the standard of \n5 care the UAC would receive with the proposed sponsor.  The additional hearings \n6 that Plaintiffs now request here would involve reconsidering substantially the same \n7 evidence that would apply in an enforcement action under the Flores Settlement.   \n8 Third, the two suits involve infringement of the same right—an asserted due-\n9 process right to contest ORR’s decisions regarding release.  Significantly, the Flores \n10 Settlement did not include an internal administrative appeal process; rather, the \n11 parties  in  Flores  agreed  that  ORR  must  avoid  “unnecessary  delay”  and  must \n12 “record”  its  release  efforts  (¶¶ 14,  18),  which  the  parties  agreed  satisfied  the \n13 requirements of due process to resolve the suit, which was brought on due-process \n14 grounds.  The Settlement also sets forth a procedure for the UAC’s attorney to \n15 contact a “juvenile coordinator” to “investigate” any case where “Plaintiffs’ counsel \n16 have reasonable cause to believe a minor . . . should have been released” (¶ 28B).  \n17 Plaintiffs now seek different procedures under the same procedural-due-process \n18 theory to protect their asserted right to challenge ORR’s release decisions.  See \n19 Compl. ¶ 110 (noting that “in all fifty states and their subdivisions . . . allegations of \n20 unfitness”  are  “tested  via  trial-like  procedures  and  any  ensuing  finding  of \n21 unsuitability . . . be based on competent evidence”).  But the alleged right is the same \n22 in both actions.   \n23 Finally, the two actions arise out of the same transactional nucleus of facts. \n24 Both Flores and the unfit-custodian class’s claim ask the Court to address what \n25 procedures due process requires for decisions regarding whether to release a UAC \n26 from  government  custody  and  reunify  the  UAC  with  a  potential  sponsor.    As \n27 explained, the Flores Settlement sets forth specific criteria for sponsor assessments \n28 (¶ 17)  and  specific  requirements  the  government  must  follow  in  making \n36 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 45 of 69   Page ID\n#:5783\n \n1 reunification decisions (¶ 18).  The Settlement also expressly states that it “sets out \n2 nationwide policy for the detention, release, and treatment of minors in the custody \n3 of the INS” in order to resolve the due-process claims raised in the original Flores \n4 complaint regarding release (¶ 9).  Thus, both Flores and this case arise out of the \n5 same transactional nucleus of facts, and Plaintiffs’ claim that due process requires \n6 additional procedures for the unfit-custodian class is barred by res judicata.   \n7 Plaintiffs contend that the Flores Settlement does not expressly address what \n8 procedures  apply  when  ORR  declines  to  release  a  UAC  because  of  questions \n9 regarding a potential sponsor’s suitability.  See Compl. ¶ 105  (“[N]either the Flores \n10 Settlement nor the TVPRA prescribe what process is due where ORR unreasonably \n11 prolongs  a  juvenile’s  detention  or  refuses  to  release  him  or  her  because  ORR \n12 questions whether an available parent or other potential custodian is capable of \n13 providing for the child’s physical and mental well-being.”).  But that does not change \n14 the res judicata analysis.  As explained, ¶¶ 14, 17, and 18 of the Flores Settlement \n15 set forth the procedures that apply to release decisions, and ¶ 28B sets forth a \n16 procedure for the child’s attorney to seek further review of a release decision.  The \n17 Flores Plaintiffs could have negotiated a process for challenging such decisions as \n18 they did for step-up decisions (¶¶ 21-24), and did not do so.  Indeed, Plaintiffs had \n19 unsuccessfully sought these same procedures in Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. at 308-09 \n20 prior to entering the Settlement.  Thus, to the extent that Plaintiffs allege that the \n21 procedures they agreed to in the Flores Settlement are insufficient to satisfy due \n22 process, such  an  allegation  is  barred  because  res  judicata  “bars  litigation  in a \n23 subsequent action of any claims that were raised or could have been raised in the \n24 prior action.”  Western Radio Servs. Co., Inc. v. Glickman, 123 F.3d 1189, 1192 (9th \n25 Cir. 1997) (emphasis added).  Plaintiffs’ apparent dissatisfaction with the bargain \n26 they struck in Flores does not allow them to bring the same claims in subsequent \n27 litigation to seek a different result. \n28\n37 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 46 of 69   Page ID\n#:5784\n \n2) ORR’s policies and procedures for the unfit-custodian class satisfy \n1\ndue process as a matter of law.  \n2\nThe Court should also grant summary judgment for Defendants on the unfit-\n3\ncustodian class’s due-process claim because ORR’s policies and procedures for \n4\nrelease decisions satisfy due process as a matter of law.  The governing factors—the \n5\nprivate interests at stake, the risk of erroneous deprivation, and the government’s \n6\ninterest, Mathews, 424 U.S. at 335—establish that ORR’s policies and procedures \n7\nfor the unfit-custodian class satisfy the requirements of procedural due process. \n8\na.  Private interests \n9\n10 Plaintiffs  allege  that  children  in  ORR  care  have  three  protected  liberty \n11 interests that are affected by ORR’s release decisions: (1) a statutory interest under \n12 the TVPRA and related contractual interest under the Flores Settlement to be placed \n13 in the least restrictive setting; (2) an interest in being free from government custody; \n14 and (3) an interest in family unity or family association.  Compl. ¶¶ 103-07.  These \n15 interests have limited weight as applied to ORR release decisions and are decisively \n16 outweighed by the other Mathews factors. \n17 To start, Plaintiffs claim a liberty interest in release because the TVPRA \n18 provides that UACs must be placed “in the least restrictive setting that is in the best \n19 interest of the child,” 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(2)(A).  See Compl. ¶ 104 (alleging that the \n20 TVPRA “requires ORR to ‘promptly’ place detained children ‘in the least restrictive \n21 setting that is in the best interest of the child,’ generally, with ‘a suitable family \n22 member”).  But that provision of the TVPRA concerns the level of restrictiveness of \n23 the facility in which a minor is placed, and not when they are released.  Immediately \n24 after  the  language  quoted  by  Plaintiffs,  the  statute  reads:  “In  making  such \n25 placements, the Secretary may consider danger to self, danger to the community, and \n26 risk of flight.”  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(2)(A) (emphasis added).  Although the provision \n27 later refers to the availability of a “suitable family member,” it does so in the context \n28 of placement decisions—not release—for a particular subcategory of UACs (child \n38 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 47 of 69   Page ID\n#:5785\n \n1 trafficking victims), and even then does not require placement with family members.  \n2 See  id.  (“Placement  of  child  trafficking  victims  may  include  placement  in  an \n3 Unaccompanied  Refugee  Minor  program,  pursuant  to  section  412(d)  of  the \n4 Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. § 1522(d)), if a suitable family member \n5 is not available to provide care.”).  Thus, the TVPRA does not impose an affirmative \n6 obligation on ORR to expeditiously release UACs to potential sponsors, nor does it \n7 create procedural rights for UACs to contest the denial of release.   \n8 Indeed, the TVPRA provision applicable to release decisions provides broad \n9 discretion to the Secretary.  It provides that “an unaccompanied alien child may not \n10 be placed with a person or entity unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n11 makes a determination that the proposed custodian is capable of providing for the \n12 child’s  physical  and  mental  well-being.”    8  U.S.C.  § 1232(c)(3)(A)  (emphasis \n13 added).    And  the  TVPRA  sets  only  a  minimum  standard  for  release:  “Such \n14 determination shall, at a minimum, include verification of the custodian’s identity \n15 and relationship to the child, if any, as well as an independent finding that the \n16 individual has not engaged in any activity that would indicate a potential risk to the \n17 child.”  Id.  The TVPRA thus contains no “explicitly mandatory language” imposing \n18 a maximum timeframe for when release decisions must be made, nor does it provide \n19 “specific directives to the decisionmaker” that if release does not occur within a set \n20 timeframe, “a particular outcome must follow.”  Thompson, 490 U.S. at 462-63.  \n21 Rather,  the  TVPRA  entrusts  release  determinations  to  ORR’s  discretion  and \n22 expertise to ensure the safety and well-being of UACs in ORR custody and care.  See \n23 Hayward, 603 F.3d at 560 (holding that because parole is a discretionary, predictive \n24 decision, it does not create a protected liberty interest).  Thus, Plaintiffs’ claimed \n25 liberty interest in release under the TVPRA fails.   \n26 Plaintiffs’ asserted liberty interest under the Flores Settlement in release also \n27 fails. As explained, supra Part A, Plaintiffs may not seek injunctive relief to rewrite \n28 a settlement they negotiated to include additional procedures they never bargained \n39 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 48 of 69   Page ID\n#:5786\n \n1 for.  And even if they could, there is no additional liberty interest created by the \n2 Flores  Settlement.    As  with  the  TVPRA,  the  Flores  Settlement  contains  no \n3 “explicitly mandatory language” regarding release decisions that provides that when \n4 “substantive predicates are present, a particular outcome must follow.”  Thompson, \n5 490 at 463.  Paragraph 14 provides that “the INS shall release a minor from its \n6 custody without unnecessary delay,” but the phrase “without unnecessary delay” is \n7 broad and permissive, does not mandate a particular set of procedures, and is cabined \n8 by Paragraph 17, which gives the agency wide discretion to conduct a “positive \n9 suitability assessment” prior to release.  Hayward, 603 F.3d at 560.  Thus, the Flores \n10 Settlement also does not create a protected liberty interest in release.  \n11 Second, Plaintiffs’ asserted liberty interest in being free from government \n12 custody is also, at most, limited.  To start, the Court in Reno v. Flores has already \n13 held that there is no substantive-due-process right for children to be in a “non-\n14 custodial” setting, and that any procedural-due-process argument for a hearing is \n15 merely “the substantive due process argument recast in procedural terms.”  507 U.S. \n16 at 302-03, 306; see also Santos v. Smith, 260 F. Supp. 3d 598, 611-12 (W.D. Va. \n17 2017) (framing the constitutional issue not as a right of the minor to live outside a \n18 state-licensed facility, but rather, as a “familial right to be raised and nurtured by . . \n19 . parents”).  Further, Plaintiffs’ claimed liberty interest in freedom from government \n20 custody is limited by their lack of lawful immigration status and apprehension at the \n21 border between ports of entry.  See Demore v. Kim, 538 U.S. 510, 521-22 (2003); \n22 U.F. ¶ 4.  As the Supreme Court has emphasized, “the Constitution gives the political \n23 department of the government plenary authority to decide which aliens to admit, and \n24 a concomitant of that power is the power to set the procedures to be followed in \n25 determining whether an alien should be admitted.”  DHS v. Thuraissigiam, 140 S. \n26 Ct. 1959, 1982 (2020) (internal quotations and citations omitted).  Here, Congress \n27 created a detailed scheme for the UAC program, and determined not to create an \n28\n40 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 49 of 69   Page ID\n#:5787\n \n1 administrative  appeal  process  for  ORR  decisions  regarding  the  suitability  of \n2 applicant sponsors.  Such an appeal process is precisely what Plaintiffs now seek. \n3 Finally, Plaintiffs’ asserted liberty interest in family unity has limited weight \n4 as  applied  to  the  unfit-custodian  class.    The  relationships  between  the  named \n5 Plaintiffs and their proposed sponsors vary substantially.  Only one named Plaintiff, \n6 Sirena  P.,  had  a  proposed  sponsor  who  is  a  parent,  and  she  is  not  a  class \n7 representative for the unfit-custodian class.  Order at 28.  Neither of the class \n8 representatives for the unfit-custodian class, Lucas R. and Gabriela N., had a parent \n9 as a proposed sponsor.  U.F. ¶¶ 106, 111, 134, 139.  And to the extent that Plaintiffs \n10 assert a liberty interest in family unity with “other available custodians” who are not \n11 close relatives, a parent, or a legal guardian (Order at 27), their asserted interest fails \n12 as a matter of law.  In Reno v. Flores, the Supreme Court explained that “[w]here a \n13 juvenile  has  no  available  parent,  close  relative,  or  legal  guardian,  where  the \n14 government  does  not  intend  to  punish  the  child,  and  where  the  conditions  of \n15 governmental custody are decent and humane, such custody surely does not violate \n16 the Constitution.”  507 U.S. at 303.  This is because retaining custody to preserve \n17 and promote the child’s welfare is “rationally connected” to a legitimate government \n18 interest.  Id.  Thus, to the extent that Plaintiffs claim a protected liberty interest in \n19 family unity (or reunification) with distant relatives or unrelated adult individuals, \n20 Reno  v.  Flores  forecloses  that  claim.    And  given  the  substantially  varied \n21 relationships between the named Plaintiffs and their proposed sponsors, Plaintiffs’ \n22 assertion that they have a general liberty interest “in preserving their family unity \n23 and the ability for their family to care for them, and in family association” has limited \n24 weight.  Compl. ¶¶ 106-07. \n25 To the extent that Plaintiffs assert a substantive-due-process right to family \n26 unity, that claim also fails as a matter of law.  As a preliminary matter, the unfit-\n27 custodian class includes members who have no available parent, close relative, or \n28 legal guardian.  See Order at 27 (class includes UACs “whom ORR is refusing or \n41 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 50 of 69   Page ID\n#:5788\n \n1 will refuse to release to parents or other available custodians”).  UACs in ORR \n2 custody are also held in humane conditions at state licensed grantee facilities (U.F. \n3 ¶¶ 8, 10-11).  Thus, finding a substantive-due-process right to family unity for the \n4 entire certified class would contravene the Supreme Court’s holding in Reno v. \n5 Flores.  507 U.S. at 303 (“We are unaware, however, that any court—aside from the \n6 courts below—has ever held that a child has a constitutional right not to be placed \n7 in a decent and humane custodial institution if there is available a responsible person \n8 unwilling to become the child’s legal guardian but willing to undertake temporary \n9 legal custody.”).   \n10 Further, although “the interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of \n11 their children” has been recognized as a “fundamental liberty interest[ ],” Troxel v. \n12 Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 (2000), that right is qualified, and in most cases, “the \n13 constitutionality of state actions that interfere with family integrity depends on the \n14 adequacy of the procedures available to contest them.”  D.B. v. Cardall, 826 F.3d \n15 721, 741 (4th Cir. 2016).  And in the context of immigration proceedings, the Fourth \n16 Circuit recently held that there is no “substantive due process right to family unity \n17 in the context of immigration detention pending removal.”  Reyna as next friend of \n18 J.F.G. v. Hott, 921 F.3d 204, 210 (4th Cir. 2019).  Thus, to the extent that Plaintiffs \n19 assert that ORR’s policies and practices regarding release violate a substantive-due-\n20 process right to family unity, that claim fails.  Compl. ¶ 181; see, e.g., Payne-\n21 Barahona v. Gonzales, 474 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2007) (“[D]eportations of parents are \n22 routine and do not of themselves dictate family separation.  If there were such a right, \n23 it is difficult to see why children would not also have a constitutional right to object \n24 to a parent being sent to prison or, during periods when the draft laws are in effect, \n25 to the conscription of a parent for prolonged and dangerous military service”); \n26 Gallanosa v. United States, 785 F.2d 116, 120 (4th Cir. 1986) (“The courts of \n27 appeals that have addressed this issue have uniformly held that deportation of the \n28 alien parents does not violate any constitutional rights of the citizen children.”); \n42 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 51 of 69   Page ID\n#:5789\n \n1 Cortez–Flores v. INS, 500 F.2d 178, 180 (5th Cir. 1974) (“[D]eportation of a parent \n2 does not deprive the child of any constitutional rights.”); Newton v. INS, 736 F.2d \n3 336, 342 (6th Cir. 1984) (stating that courts of appeals have “uniformly” held that \n4 the deportation of parents does not deprive their children of constitutional rights); \n5 Flores–Quezada v. Gonzales, 134 F. App’x 202, 203 (9th Cir. 2005) (unpublished) \n6 (holding that deportation does not result in deprivation of due process where a child \n7 would be denied the Arizona constitutional right to education); Robles v. INS, 485 \n8 F.2d 100, 102 (10th Cir. 1973) (rejecting the argument that it is unconstitutional to \n9 break up a family and deprive children of “their constitutional right to a continuation \n10 of the family unit”).  \n11 b. Risk of erroneous deprivation \n12\nThe second Mathews factor— “[t]he risk of an erroneous deprivation of such \n13\ninterest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or \n14\nsubstitute procedural safeguards,” 424 U.S. at 335—likewise favors the government.  \n15\nORR provides robust processes that safeguard the welfare of children in its care \n16\nwhile also affording children and potential sponsors continuous opportunities to \n17\nprovide information in favor of release and sponsorship. \n18\nFirst,  ORR’s  release  process  is  a  collaborative  endeavor  that  acts  as  a \n19\nsignificant safeguard against erroneous and arbitrary decisionmaking.  U.F. ¶¶ 24, \n20\n79.    The  federal  field  specialist,  case  manager,  and  case  coordinator  (a \n21\nnongovernmental third-party reviewer) all work together in making release decisions \n22\nand meet weekly to discuss the status of each child’s case.  U.F. ¶¶ 24-25, 27, 29; \n23\nJ.S. ¶¶ 94-95.  The case coordinator provides an independent evaluation of whether \n24\na child should be released to a potential sponsor, and case managers and federal field \n25\nspecialists can elevate the concerns of sponsors up the chain, ultimately to the \n26\nDeputy Director of the Division of Policy and Procedure.  U.F. ¶¶ 25, 29; J.S. ¶¶ 7-\n27\n10.  ORR has also implemented numerous child-welfare policies to promote timely \n28\nrelease, including immediately searching for a potential sponsor upon the child’s \n43 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 52 of 69   Page ID\n#:5790\n \n1 arrival, and performing concurrent sponsor vetting when there is more than one \n2 potential sponsor.  U.F. ¶¶ 20-23. Lastly, ORR supervisors regularly monitor the \n3 work of federal field specialists and coordinate with staff on any matters related to \n4 release that require additional supervision or oversight.  U.F. ¶ 26.  As one child \n5 welfare expert testified, “But you’re presuming that ORR doesn’t have checks and \n6 balances.  What I see here is a great deal of concern about doing home studies, about \n7 contacting sponsors, about vetting sponsor, about having reviews of who the sponsor \n8 is. . . .  I think that those are - - that’s a very appropriate process in order to ensure \n9 that release of the child to a situation where you can be at least assured that you made \n10 every effort possible to ensure that that child will be safe once [they are] out of your \n11 care.”  Dr. Earner Dep. 146:23-147:14; U.F. ¶ 24.   \n12 Second, ORR provides multiple opportunities for potential sponsors to be \n13 heard.  Case managers are required to communicate regularly with potential sponsors \n14 and other relevant individuals in formulating release recommendations.  U.F. ¶ 28.  \n15 Potential sponsors and children are able to present their side of the story and to share \n16 any information they believe would place their case for sponsorship in the best \n17 possible light with the case manager, the home study provider (when applicable), \n18 and ORR.  U.F. ¶¶ 17-18, 28, 30, 33.  ORR requires case managers to engage the \n19 potential sponsor throughout the process, explain the process to them, and invite the \n20 potential sponsor to participate, freely ask questions, and submit any additional \n21 information  for  consideration—including  information  that  could  mitigate  any \n22 potential concerns.  U.F. ¶¶ 22, 28, 30, 33.   \n23 Third,  ORR  provides  a  process  for  appealing  denial  decisions:  “The \n24 parent/legal guardian may seek an appeal of the ORR Director’s denial decision by \n25 submitting a written request to the Assistant Secretary for Children and Families \n26 within 30 business days of receipt of the final decision from the ORR Director.”  J.S. \n27 ¶¶ 21-29.  The parent or legal guardian may request either a written appeal or a \n28 hearing, and “[a]ny evidence submitted to the Assistant Secretary by ORR is shared \n44 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 53 of 69   Page ID\n#:5791\n \n1 with the requester in compliance with privacy protections.”  J.S. ¶¶ 21, 26.  UACs \n2 can also seek judicial review of their continued custody in federal court.  U.F. ¶ 63.   \n3 Given ORR’s extensive, collaborative process for assessing potential sponsors \n4 and  the  multiple  opportunities  for  review  of  denial  decisions,  “the  risk  of  an \n5 erroneous deprivation” under ORR’s current procedures is very low.  See U.F. ¶ 124.  \n6 Further, there is no genuine dispute of material fact that, excluding data from April \n7 and May 2020 distorted by the COVID-19 pandemic, length of stay for UACs in \n8 ORR care has been consistently brief.  U.F. ¶ 95.  From June 2019 through March \n9 2020, the average length of stay was less than two months (48.4 days).  U.F. ¶ 96.  \n10 Even including the outlier months of April and May 2020, the average length of stay \n11 was only 54 days.  U.F. ¶ 97.  In cases where children are in ORR case for longer \n12 lengths of time, both a review conducted by expert witnesses of case files the parties \n13 negotiated in discovery, and consistent testimony from ORR headquarter staff, case \n14 managers, and federal field specialists, show that release delays are generally not \n15 attributable to tardiness on the part of ORR, but rather a UAC’s lack of a sponsor or \n16 unresponsiveness from potential sponsors.  U.F. ¶ 34.  For comparison, in the foster-\n17 care context, in states where a guardian who is related to a foster child needs to be \n18 licensed to accept the child, it can take up to 6 months to place a child with the \n19 relative.  See, e.g., http://icpcstatepages.org/california/licensingcertificationapproval \n20 (in California, foster parents who are relatives of the child must be licensed, and the \n21 process can take 3-6 months).  Indeed, as a further safeguard, ORR-contracted \n22 facilities have no financial incentive to keep children in care longer than appropriate \n23 because they are paid on a funded capacity basis regardless of how many or long \n24 minors remain in care.  U.F. ¶ 7.   \n25 The  experiences  of  the  only  two  named  Plaintiffs  who  are  class \n26 representatives for the unfit-custodian class, Gabriela N. and Lucas R., see Order 28, \n27 confirm that delays in release are not normally attributable to arbitrary or dilatory \n28 decision-making on ORR’s part.  Neither representative’s potential sponsor is a \n45 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 54 of 69   Page ID\n#:5792\n \n1 parent or legal guardian.  U.F. ¶¶ 106, 111, 134, 139.  Gabriela N.’s potential \n2 sponsor, her grandfather, had never been her primary caregiver, had not seen her in \n3 14  years,  had  a  serious  medical  condition,  did  not  timely  provide  exonerating \n4 evidence of a kidnapping charge from his home country, and received a negative \n5 recommendation from a TVPRA-mandated home study.  U.F. ¶¶ 134-38.  Lucas R.’s \n6 potential sponsor, his sister, had left their home country only a year before he did, \n7 had another non-relative adult living in her home who would not come in for \n8 fingerprinting  (contrary  to  ORR  policy),  and  similarly  received  a  negative \n9 recommendation from a TVPRA-mandated home study.  U.F. ¶¶ 19, 106-08.  These \n10 undisputed  facts  confirm  that  Plaintiffs  do  not  face  a  “risk  of  an  erroneous \n11 deprivation” under ORR’s current procedures. \n12 The value of additional procedures is also low.  As one child-welfare expert \n13 writes, “[I]f only one clinical staff member were responsible for making the release \n14 or placement decision, or if individual children’s cases were not reviewed on a \n15 regular basis, I would favor additional safeguards to ensure that placements and \n16 transfers reflected sound clinical practice.  Yet, as discussed above, each child’s case \n17 is jointly reviewed on a regular basis by a team of program staff and supervisors in \n18 consultation with ORR federal representatives.”  Dr. Ryan Expert Report ¶ 46; U.F. \n19 ¶ 79.  Thus, “it is unclear what problem would be solved by injecting additional \n20 requirements of consulting with a child’s legal representative at any instance that a \n21 potential step-up or step-down, or release was under consideration.”  Id.; see also \n22 Expert Report of Dr. Earner, ¶ 30, p. 9 (“The proposal for a quasi-judicial ‘fair’ \n23 hearing would do nothing to further the safety of the UAC.  Hearings are court-like \n24 processes that create an adversarial environment and only prolong the length of time \n25 that UAC spend in care.”).   \n26 Indeed, it is unclear from Plaintiffs’ complaint what alternative procedures \n27 they even seek.  Plaintiffs claim that they “are informed and believe that in all fifty \n28 states and their subdivisions, children may not be detained for want of a qualified \n46 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 55 of 69   Page ID\n#:5793\n \n1 custodian without affording them and/or their parents or other potential custodians \n2 a prompt hearing before a judge or other neutral and detached decisionmaker, during \n3 which allegations of unfitness are tested via trial-like procedures and any ensuing \n4 finding of unsuitability must be based on competent evidence.”  Compl. ¶ 110.6  But \n5 they do not clarify whether they are seeking “trial-like procedures” for UACs in \n6 ORR custody, what that means, or whether they are claiming that due process entitles \n7 them to such “trial-like procedures.”  Plaintiffs also claim that ORR fails to “afford[ ] \n8 detained  minors  or  their  proposed  custodians  a  timely,  prompt,  or  meaningful \n9 opportunity to be heard regarding such custodians’ fitness.”  Id. ¶ 180.  But they do \n10 not  identify  any  specific  procedures  they  are  denied  other  than  “a  meaningful \n11 opportunity to be heard,” which, as explained, ORR already provides.  Accordingly, \n12 to the extent that Plaintiffs assert that additional procedures are required beyond a \n13 meaningful opportunity to be heard, any such claim is waived.  King, 814 F.2d at \n14 567 (“All causes of action alleged in an original complaint which are not alleged in \n15 an amended complaint are waived.”).   \n16 Further, as with the step-up class, the scope of relief for the unfit-custodian \n17 class is “limited by the class definition.” Al Otro Lado, 423 F.Supp.3d at 878.  Based \n18 on Plaintiffs’ complaint, the Court certified a class of “all minors in ORR custody \n19 pursuant to 6 U.S.C. section 279 and/or 8 U.S.C. section 1232 whom ORR is \n20 refusing or will refuse to release to parents or other available custodians within 30 \n21 days of the proposed custodian’s submission of a complete family reunification \n22 packet on the ground that the proposed custodian is or may be unfit.”  Order at 27-\n23 28.  So any additional procedures Plaintiffs may seek that go beyond a “meaningful \n24\n                                                 \n25 6 Further, unlike domestic foster care, ORR does not remove children from their \ncurrent  custodians;  rather,  ORR  places  them  with  such  custodians  in  the  first \n26\ninstance after the child arrives unaccompanied.  U.F. ¶¶ 4-5.  Thus, ORR makes an \n27 affirmative determination the custodian is able to provide for the child’s physical \nand mental well-being, and not a finding that the custodian is unfit and the child \n28\nshould be removed.  U.F. ¶ 2; J.S. ¶ 5. \n47 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 56 of 69   Page ID\n#:5794\n \n1 opportunity to be heard” after 30 days are outside the class definition and thus \n2 beyond the scope of available relief. \n3\nc.  The government’s interest \n4\nThe final Mathews factor, the government’s interest, also heavily favors the \n5\ngovernment.  ORR has its own statutorily prescribed interest in child welfare, and \n6\nacts in loco parentis to protect UACs’ interests in safety and permanency.  Congress \n7\ncodified  ORR’s  interest  at  8  U.S.C.  § 1232(c)(3)(A),  mandating  that  “an \n8\nunaccompanied alien child may not be placed with a person or entity unless the \n9\nSecretary of Health and Human Services makes a determination that the proposed \n10\ncustodian is capable of providing for the child’s physical and mental well-being.”  \n11\nCongress further directed that “[s]uch determination shall, at a minimum, include \n12\nverification of the custodian’s identity and relationship to the child, if any, as well \n13\nas an independent finding that the individual has not engaged in any activity that \n14\nwould indicate a potential risk to the child.”  Id.  Congress did not impose any similar \n15\nmandate that ORR speedily release children in its care, although ORR seeks to \n16\ntimely release UACs.  U.F. ¶ 1.  Further, the potential risks to children from release \n17\nto a sponsor who has not been adequately evaluated are significant.  Indeed, the \n18\nTVPRA was enacted in response to child-trafficking concerns.  U.F. ¶¶ 4-7.  The \n19\ngovernment’s interest in safe release is also heightened by the fact that, unlike \n20\ndomestic child welfare agencies, ORR does not maintain custody of the child after \n21\nrelease.  U.F. ¶ 12.  And again, the financial burden on ORR in staffing more \n22\nhearings would be substantial.  U.F. ¶¶ 35, 80.  ORR thus has a strong interest both \n23\nin avoiding the burden and delay of unnecessary additional procedures, and in \n24\nefficiently directing its resources to ensure the safe and prompt release of children \n25\nin its care to suitable sponsors.  See U.F. ¶¶ 2-6; Expert Report of Dr. Earner ¶ 31 \n26\n(“Screening potential sponsors of UACs is a serious child safety issue. Safety cannot \n27\nbe sacrificed for speed of release of a UAC.”); id. ¶ 32 (“For UACs who may have \n28\n48 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 57 of 69   Page ID\n#:5795\n \n1 no viable sponsor, or a sponsor claiming a distant or vague relationship, the question \n2 then becomes one of whether the UAC is being trafficked for some other purpose.”). \n3 d. Balance of Mathews factors  \n4\nThe balance of Mathews factors weighs conclusively in the government’s \n5\nfavor.  First, the unfit-custodian class’s asserted liberty interests are limited.  The \n6\nTVPRA and Flores Settlement do not create a liberty interest in release.  Plaintiffs’ \n7\nasserted  interest  in  family  unity  is  already  limited  in  the  immigration  custody \n8\ncontext, and such an interest carries even less weight here given the widely varying \n9\nrelationships between the Plaintiffs and their potential sponsors.  Second, the risk of \n10\nerroneous deprivation under ORR’s current procedures is low, as is the probable \n11\nvalue of more procedures.  UACs and potential sponsors already have multiple \n12\nopportunities to present their case for release, and ORR’s release procedures involve \n13\nmultiple levels of review and oversight.  U.F. ¶¶ 24-32.  Case managers and federal \n14\nfield specialists can elevate the concerns of sponsors, and supervisors regularly \n15\nmonitor  the  cases  of  the  federal  field  specialists  under  them.    U.F.  ¶¶  24-25.  \n16\nPlaintiffs do not explain how additional procedures would increase the accuracy of \n17\nORR’s  sponsor  suitability  assessments.    Finally,  ORR’s  statutorily-mandated \n18\ninterest in safely placing children with approved sponsors is substantial.  See U.F. \n19\n¶¶ 3-6.  The balance of these factors conclusively establishes that ORR’s existing \n20\nprocedures satisfy due process as a matter of law.  The Court should therefore grant \n21\nsummary judgment for Defendants on the unfit-custodian class’s due-process claim. \n22\n3) ORR’s policies and procedures for the unfit-custodian class comport \n23 with the TVPRA, the APA, and the First Amendment.   \n24\nORR’s policies and procedures for the unfit-custodian class also satisfy the \n25\nTVPRA, the APA, and the First Amendment as a matter of law.   \n26\nFirst, ORR’s policies and procedures for release comport with the TVPRA. \n27\nPlaintiffs’  claim  that  ORR’s  “policy  and  practice  individually  and  collectively \n28\nviolate . . . TVPRA § 235(c)(2)(A)” (Compl. ¶ 181) is again simply their flawed \n49 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 58 of 69   Page ID\n#:5796\n \n1 procedural-due-process claim recast as an alleged statutory violation.  The TVPRA \n2 does not specify any procedures for challenging ORR’s release decisions, which \n3 Plaintiffs acknowledge.  Id. ¶ 105; 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c).  And, as explained, to the \n4 extent that Plaintiffs raise a procedural-due-process claim based upon a claimed \n5 liberty interest in the TVPRA, the TVPRA gives rise to no such interest.  But even \n6 if  the  TVPRA  did,  ORR’s  robust  procedures  satisfies  procedural  due  process, \n7 balancing the need to safeguard the welfare of children in its care while affording \n8 both children and potential sponsors continuous opportunities to provide information \n9 in favor of sponsorship, thereby minimizing the risk of erroneous deprivation.  Thus, \n10 ORR’s release policies and procedures satisfy the TVPRA as a matter of law.   \n11 Second, ORR’s policies and procedures for the unfit-custodian class also \n12 comport with the APA.  Compl. ¶ 181.  Plaintiffs similarly make no independent \n13 claim under the APA beyond their procedural-due-process claim, which fails for the \n14 reasons described above, and the relief they request under the APA is the same as \n15 the relief they request on their due-process claim—an opportunity to contest the \n16 denial of release to any potential sponsor.  Further, like the TVPRA, the APA does \n17 not separately impose additional procedural requirements on ORR release decisions.  \n18 The unfit-custodian class’s APA claim fails as a matter of law. \n19 Third, to the extent that the unfit-custodian class asserts a claim under the \n20 Freedom of Association Clause of the First Amendment, that claim fails.  See Compl. \n21 ¶ 106.  The First Amendment protects a person’s right to associate with others so as \n22 to protect the person’s right to engage in group activities like speech, that are \n23 themselves protected under the First Amendment.  Dawson v. Delaware, 503 U.S. \n24 159, 163 (1992); see also IDK, Inc. v. Clark Cty., 836 F.2d 1185, 1193 (9th Cir. \n25 1988).  The First Amendment right of association also protects the right to band \n26 together to pursue a common goal.  See Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, 530 U.S. \n27 640, 647-48 (2000).  Nothing in the complaint alleges that class members have been \n28 prevented by ORR from associating with others to exercise other First Amendment \n50 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 59 of 69   Page ID\n#:5797\n \n1 rights.  Plaintiffs also have not alleged that they are part of any group that has been \n2 prevented by ORR from pursuing a common goal.  Rather, their First Amendment \n3 claim is simply their substantive-due-process claim to family unity recast under the \n4 First  Amendment.    See  Compl.  ¶ 116  (“The  government’s  refusing  to  release \n5 children to their parents’ custody, or to the custody of adult siblings and other family \n6 members . . . violates the freedom of association clause of the First Amendment.”).  \n7 That claim fails for the reasons described above.   \n8 Thus, Plaintiffs’ unfit-custodian claims under the TVPRA, the APA, and the \n9 First Amendment fail as a matter of law.   \n10 C.  Defendants Are Entitled to Judgment as a Matter of Law on the Legal-\nRepresentation Class’s Claim. \n11\n12 Finally,  the  Court  should  grant  summary  judgment  for  Defendants  on \n13 Plaintiffs’ claim that ORR unlawfully prevents access to lawyers from representing \n14 class members in proceedings involving ORR decisions on custody, placement, \n15 release, and medication.  Compl. ¶¶ 188-90.  The legal-representation class’s claim \n16 is barred by res judicata.  And Defendants’ procedures on legal representation of \n17 UACs satisfy due process and other legal requirements as a matter of law.   \n18 1) The legal-representation class’s claim is barred by res judicata. \n19\nThe  legal-representation  class’s  claim—including  the  purported  statutory \n20\naspects of their claim that simply replicate their due-process challenge—is barred by \n21\nres judicata.  Flores conclusively resolved their claim that due process requires the \n22\nimposition of additional procedures for legal representation.  As explained, claim \n23\npreclusion requires: (1) identity of claims; (2) a final judgment on the merits; and \n24\n(3) privity between the parties.  Harris, 682 F.3d at 1132.  The Flores Settlement is \n25\na final judgment.  See supra Part A.  And there is privity between the parties.  The \n26\nlegal-representation class comprises minors “to whom ORR is impeding or will \n27\nimpede legal assistance in legal matters or proceedings involving their custody, \n28\nplacement, release, and/or administration of psychotropic drugs.”  Order at 28.  This \n51 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 60 of 69   Page ID\n#:5798\n \n1 class is a subset of the Flores class, which comprises “[a]ll minors who are detained \n2 in the legal custody of the INS” (¶ 10).   \n3 There is also identity of claims.  All four factors of the Howard test support \n4 that conclusion.  First, Plaintiffs’ claimed right to access counsel—in particular, the \n5 right to access representation by ORR-funded legal service providers to challenge \n6 ORR  decisions  on  placement,  release,  and  medication  (Compl.  ¶ 148)—would \n7 impair rights and obligations established under the Flores Settlement.  The Flores \n8 Settlement expressly provides, consistent with due process, that UACs must be \n9 provided with information regarding their “right to be represented by counsel at no \n10 expense to the government” (Ex. 1, ¶ 14) (emphasis added).  The Settlement also \n11 states that ORR is to provide UACs a “list of free legal services available in the \n12 district pursuant to INS regulations (unless previously given to the minor)” (¶ 24D).7  \n13 The second and third factors—whether the two actions involve substantially the \n14 same evidence and infringement of the same right—also favor finding an identity of \n15 claims.  Both Flores and this case involve the same claimed right to access counsel \n16 and the same evidence regarding whether the government must facilitate such access \n17 for UACs wishing to challenge their “detention, release, and treatment.”  Compare \n18 Settlement  ¶ 9 (“This Agreement  sets out nationwide policy for the detention, \n19 release, and treatment of minors in the custody of the INS . . .”) with Compl. ¶ 189 \n20 (seeking  legal  access  “involving  ORR’s  decisions  regarding  custody,  release, \n21 medication, and placement”).  Finally, the fourth factor—whether the two actions \n22 arise out of the same transactional nucleus of facts—also favors finding identity of \n23 claims.    Both  cases  involve  the  services  ORR  must  provide  UACs  on  legal \n24 representation  while  in  government  care  and  custody.    Plaintiffs  could  have \n25 negotiated a right to access counsel for purposes of challenging ORR decisions \n                                                 \n26\n7 When class counsel tried to assert a right to government-funded counsel in Flores, \n27 the Court deemed that claimed right to be “extracontractual”—i.e., not protected \nunder the Flores Settlement.  See Flores v. Sessions, No. 85-cv-4544, ECF No. 470 \n28\nat 5-6 (July 30, 2018).   \n52 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 61 of 69   Page ID\n#:5799\n \n1 regarding “detention, release, and treatment” as part of the Flores Settlement, but \n2 did not do so.  Thus, Plaintiffs’ legal-representation claim is barred by res judicata.  \n3 See Western Radio, 123 F.3d at 1192 (res judicata “bars litigation in a subsequent \n4 action of any claims that were raised or could have been raised in the prior action”) \n5 (emphasis added).  To the extent that Plaintiffs claim that the procedures they \n6 negotiated in Flores are not being followed, they should seek relief under Flores.   \n7 2) ORR’s  policies  and  procedures  for  the  legal-representation  class \nsatisfy due process as a matter of law. \n8\n9 The  Court  should  also  grant  summary  judgment  for  Defendants  because \n10 ORR’s policies and procedures regarding legal representation for UACs satisfy due \n11 process as a matter of law. \n12 On the first Mathews factor, Plaintiffs lack a constitutionally protected interest \n13 in attorneys (government-funded or not) to formally appear to contest routine ORR \n14 decision-making regarding placement, release, and medication (Compl. ¶ 148).  Cf. \n15 J.E.F.M. v. Lynch, 837 F.3d 1026, 1038 (9th Cir. 2016) (rejecting minors’ claim “to \n16 government-provided counsel as a matter of constitutional and statutory right”); \n17 Perez-Funez v. Dist. Dir., INS, 619 F. Supp. 656, 665 (C.D. Cal. 1985) (the court is \n18 “by no means ruling that unaccompanied minors have a right to appointed counsel. \n19 The case law clearly forecloses such a finding.”). Further, neither the HSA nor the \n20 TVPRA contain “mandatory language” that would create a liberty interest. Carver, \n21 558 F.3d at 874-75.  The TVPRA directs ORR to “ensure, to the greatest extent \n22 practicable and consistent with section 292 of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n23 (8 U.S.C. § 1362), that all unaccompanied alien children who are or have been in the \n24 custody of [HHS] . . . have counsel to represent them in legal proceedings or matters \n25 and protect them from mistreatment.”  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5).  The statute pertains \n26 to pro bono legal services: “To the greatest extent practicable, the Secretary of \n27 Health and Human Services shall make every effort to utilize the services of pro \n28 bono counsel who agree to provide representation to such children without charge.”  \n53 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 62 of 69   Page ID\n#:5800\n \n1 Id.  The language “to the greatest extent practicable” and that ORR make “every \n2 effort to utilize . . . pro bono counsel” does not mandate that any “particular outcome \n3 must follow,” nor does it create a protected liberty interest in a right to access \n4 representation to challenge ORR decisions.  Similarly, the HSA’s directive to HHS \n5 to “develop[ ] a plan to be submitted to Congress on how to ensure that qualified and \n6 independent  legal  counsel is timely appointed to represent the interest of each \n7 [UAC],” 6 U.S.C. § 279(b)(1)(A), does not mandate a “particular outcome” and thus \n8 does not create a constitutionally protected liberty interest.  Finally, the Flores \n9 Settlement  does  not  create  a  protected  liberty  interest  in  access  to  counsel  to \n10 challenge routine ORR decisions.  The Ninth Circuit has held that the “right to retain \n11 counsel conferred by [a] consent decree is not itself a protected liberty interest.” \n12 Smith, 994 F.2d at 1407.  So Plaintiffs’ legal-representation claim fails at the outset.  \n13 On the second Mathews factor, the risk of erroneous deprivation is low in \n14 children not being informed of available pro bono legal immigration services.  Upon \n15 entering ORR custody, the facility must give the UAC a Legal Resource Guide—\n16 which includes a form for requesting a Flores bond hearing—and read the contents \n17 of the form to the child in a language the child understands.  U.F. ¶ 81.  The Legal \n18 Resource  Guide  contains  a  state-by-state  listing  of  attorneys  and  legal  service \n19 providers.  Id.  UACs in ORR custody also receive a free legal consultation with \n20 licensed attorneys through an ORR-funded legal-service contract.  Id.; J.S. ¶¶ 97-98.  \n21 Upon a UAC’s admission to ORR care, legal service providers are required to \n22 provide a know-your-rights presentation and individualized legal screening to the \n23 UAC for possible immigration relief.  U.F. ¶ 81.  Though ORR’s legal-service \n24 contract funds only certain types of assistance related to immigration proceedings, \n25 legal service providers may assist UACs with other matters using non-ORR funds.  \n26 U.F. ¶¶ 88-91, 93-94; J.S. ¶ 99.  UACs in ORR custody can also access legal services \n27 through other funding or through pro bono counsel, and ORR does not discourage \n28 attorneys from representing UACs in ORR custody, does not refuse to work with \n54 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 63 of 69   Page ID\n#:5801\n \n1 such attorneys, and does not reduce funding for attorneys with ORR legal services \n2 contracts who also provide other assistance to UACs.  U.F. ¶¶ 81, 90, 93-94.  ORR’s \n3 policies  and  procedures  also  require  that  attorneys  representing  UACs  have \n4 unlimited telephone access to their clients, and ORR instructs care providers to \n5 provide regular updates to counsel and to provide meeting places between UACs \n6 and their attorneys.  U.F. ¶¶ 86-87.  ORR also encourages all potential sponsors to \n7 attend a legal orientation provided by the care-provider facilities to further inform \n8 them of possible free legal immigration services for the child.  U.F. ¶¶ 82-84.  The \n9 risk of erroneous deprivation under these procedures is low, particularly given the \n10 absence of any constitutionally protected liberty interest related to ORR-funded legal \n11 representation,  and  Plaintiffs  cannot  show  that  additional  procedures  would \n12 meaningfully reduce any risk of error. \n13 Plaintiffs also cannot point to any evidence that ORR “blocks” access to \n14 counsel.  None of the four class representatives—Lucas R., Jaime D.,  Daniela \n15 Marisol  T.,  and  Gabriela  N.—has  offered  any  evidence  supporting  their  legal-\n16 representation claim.  All four class representatives were provided screenings for \n17 legal relief, legal rights presentations, and a list of pro bono legal service providers \n18 while in ORR custody, and met with attorneys of record or a child advocate.  U.F. \n19 ¶¶ 105, 110, 113, 118, 124, 126-28, 133, 141. During discovery, each of these \n20 Plaintiffs was asked to “[i]dentify and describe the factual circumstance of each \n21 instance since January 2017 in which you claim Defendants blocked Vera Institute \n22 lawyers from representing you regarding custody, medication, placement, or release \n23 from ORR custody.”  U.F. ¶¶ 112, 123, 129, 142.  Each Plaintiff simply replied, \n24 “Plaintiff answers that he [or she] was not privy, and accordingly can neither identify \n25 nor describe, the factual circumstances in which Defendants blocked Vera Institute \n26 lawyers  from representing [them] regarding custody,  medication, placement,  or \n27 release from ORR custody.  Plaintiff further answers that to the best of his [or her] \n28 knowledge and recollection no lawyer ever represented him [or her] with respect to \n55 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 64 of 69   Page ID\n#:5802\n \n1 custody,  medication,  placement,  or  release  at  any  time  while  he  was  in  ORR \n2 custody.”  Id.  Such bare assertions without any supporting evidence do not create a \n3 genuine issue of material fact.  McSherry, 584 F.3d at 1138 (to demonstrate a \n4 genuine issue of material fact, a party must rely on facts, not unsupported assertions).   \n5 Other discovery likewise has not uncovered any factual support for Plaintiffs’ \n6 allegations  on  the  legal-representation  class.    The  deposition  testimony  of  the \n7 attorneys who submitted declarations on behalf of Plaintiffs in support of the legal-\n8 representation class shows that the class’s claims rest almost entirely on hearsay and \n9 speculation.  Lorilei Williams, a former ORR legal service provider contracted \n10 through the Vera Institute of Justice, admitted that to her knowledge, Vera had never \n11 denied funding to a legal-service provider on the basis that the provider, or one of \n12 its attorneys, brought an action against ORR.  Williams Dep. 96:20-97:2; U.F. ¶ 94.  \n13 Megan Stuart, another attorney with a Vera-funded legal-service provider, testified: \n14 “Q. Did anyone at Vera tell you that you could not advocate for a child? A. No. I \n15 never—I was—I had no occasion to interact with Vera.”  Stuart Dep. 75:10-13; U.F. \n16 ¶  90.    And  Justin  Mixon,  the  third  attorney  with  a  Vera-funded  legal-service \n17 provider, testified: “Q. You state that Vera at the behest of the ORR [sic] blocks the \n18 majority of the qualified and available representatives from children affirmed by \n19 ORR’s custody and placement decisions?  A. Yeah.  I’m not in the room when ORR \n20 negotiates the contract with Vera.”  Mixon Dep. 154:2-8; U.F. ¶ 90.  \n21 The final Mathews factor, the government’s interest, also decisively favors the \n22 government.  The TVPRA does not require ORR to provide UACs a right to access \n23 representation  from  ORR-funded  legal  service  providers  to  challenge  routine \n24 decisionmaking, and ORR designates legal-representation resources for other UAC \n25 services.  See U.F. ¶ 92.  Mandating access to ORR-funded legal representation to \n26 challenge ORR placement, release, and medication decisions would thus divert \n27 valuable program resources currently used to connect children with legal service \n28\n56 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 65 of 69   Page ID\n#:5803\n \n1 providers for other purposes (such as seeking immigration relief) and used to fund \n2 other essential activities, such as care and placement of children.  Id.   \n3 Thus,  the  balance  of  Mathews  factors  conclusively  favors  Defendants.  \n4 Plaintiffs do not have a constitutionally protected interest in government-funded \n5 legal counsel to challenge ORR decisions on placement, release, and medication.  \n6 There is no evidence that Plaintiffs face a risk of erroneous deprivation under \n7 existing procedures for connecting UACs with counsel, or that mandating more \n8 procedures would meaningfully reduce any minimal risk that does exist.  And the \n9 government’s interest in soundly allocating its resources to meet other program \n10 needs is substantial.  The legal-representation class’s due-process claim thus fails as \n11 a matter of law, and the Court should grant summary judgment for Defendants on \n12 the claim. \n13 3) ORR’s  policies  and  procedures  for  the  legal-representation  class \ncomport with the TVPRA, the HSA, Title 8, and the APA.   \n14\n15 ORR’s policies and procedures for the legal-representation class satisfy the \n16 requirements of the TVPRA, the HSA, Title 8, and the APA as a matter of law.  \n17 Plaintiffs allege that these statutes and associated regulations “generally guarantee \n18 Plaintiffs and their proposed class members the right to be represented by retained \n19 and pro bono counsel in proceedings before U.S. Citizenship  and  Immigration \n20 Services  and  the  Executive  Office  for  Immigration  Review.”    Compl.  ¶ 144.  \n21 Plaintiffs further allege that “[l]egal proceedings involving ORR’s custody, release, \n22 placement, and medication decisions, including hearings pursuant to paragraph 24A \n23 of the Flores Settlement, are ‘legal proceedings or matters’ within the meaning of \n24 the TVPRA § 235(c)(5).”  Id. ¶ 149.  These arguments lack merit: such a right is not \n25 articulated in any of the statutes or regulations that Plaintiffs cite.  The Court should \n26 therefore  reject  the  claim  that  ORR’s  policies  and  procedures  “violate  . . .  the \n27 TVPRA  § 235(c)(5),  HSA  § 279(b)(A)  [sic],  8  C.F.R.  §§ 287.3(c),  1003.62, \n28 1240.10(a)(2) and 1292.1 et seq. [collectively, the federal immigration regulations \n57 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 66 of 69   Page ID\n#:5804\n \n1 under Title 8],” and the APA, as applied to the legal-representation class.  Compl. \n2 ¶ 190.   \n3 First,  Plaintiffs’  claim  under  the  TVPRA  fails,  as  the  TVPRA  nowhere \n4 specifies a right to access government-funded counsel to challenge routine ORR \n5 decision-making.  The TVPRA instructs ORR to “ensure, to the greatest extent \n6 practicable and consistent with section 292 of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n7 (8 U.S.C. § 1362), that all unaccompanied alien children who are or have been in the \n8 custody of [HHS] . . . have counsel to represent them in legal proceedings or matters \n9 and protect them from mistreatment.”  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5).  Section 292 of the \n10 INA in turn provides that “[i]n any removal proceedings before an immigration \n11 judge and in any appeal proceedings before the Attorney General from any such \n12 removal  proceedings,  the  person  concerned  shall  have  the  privilege  of  being \n13 represented (at no expense to the Government) by such counsel, authorized to \n14 practice in such proceedings, as he shall choose.”  8 U.S.C. § 1362 (emphasis added).  \n15 These provisions do not create a general right to access government-funded counsel \n16 to  challenge  routine  ORR  decisions,  such  as  step-up,  release,  and  medication.  \n17 Rather, these provisions impose an obligation on ORR to connect UACs with pro \n18 bono counsel in their immigration proceedings.  And as explained, ORR’s policies \n19 and procedures on legal representation satisfy this obligation, as ORR works to \n20 ensure  “to  the  greatest  extent  practicable”  that  UACs  are  able  to  access  such \n21 representation.  U.F. ¶ 81.  Thus, Plaintiffs’ claim that ORR’s policies and practices \n22 on legal representation violate the TVPRA fails as a matter of law. \n23 To the extent that Plaintiffs claim that challenges to routine ORR decision-\n24 making on release, step-up, and the administration of psychotropic medication are \n25 “legal proceedings” covered under subsection (c)(5) of the TVPRA, such a claim \n26 conflicts with a plain reading of the statute, its legislative history, and congressional \n27 appropriations.  To start, the TVPRA plainly states that it must be applied “consistent \n28 with” section 292 of the INA (8 U.S.C. § 1362), and that provision addresses access \n58 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 67 of 69   Page ID\n#:5805\n \n1 to counsel in “removal proceedings.”  Further, such a reading  contravenes the \n2 TVPRA’s legislative history.  One of the main sponsors of the TVPRA, Senator \n3 Diane  Feinstein,  introduced  the  finalized  bill  as  follows:  “This  trafficking  bill \n4 includes a provision I authored over 8 years ago—the Unaccompanied Alien Minor \n5 Act . . . .  The bill also provides for pro bono legal representation for unaccompanied \n6 alien children in their immigration matters . . . .”  154 Cong. Rec. S10, 886-87 (daily \n7 ed.  Dec.  10,  2008).    Finally,  congressional  appropriations  show  that  Congress \n8 intended to fund only access to immigration services.  For the current fiscal year \n9 2020, Congress set aside not less than $160 million for three areas: legal services, \n10 child advocates, and post-release services.  See Further Consolidated Appropriations \n11 Act, 2020, Pub. L. 116-94, Division A, Title II, 133 Stat. 2570.  Statements of the \n12 House  Appropriations  Committee  Chairwoman,  Chairwoman  DeLauro,  further \n13 show that this funding is designated for assisting children in obtaining representation \n14 in immigration proceedings: “[L]egal counsel for unaccompanied children increases \n15 the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  immigration  proceedings  and  significantly \n16 reduces the failure-to-appear rate of children who are released from HHS custody.”  \n17 H.R. Rep. 116-62, 144-45, 116th Congress, 1st Sess. (May 15, 2019).  \n18 Read in context, the TVPRA addresses legal representation in immigration \n19 removal proceedings, not the day-to-day decisions that Plaintiffs characterize as \n20 “legal proceedings.”  And ORR has never considered challenges to step-up, release, \n21 and medical care to be legal matters or proceedings under the TVPRA.  J.S. ¶ 99.  \n22 On  Plaintiffs’  view,  any  day-to-day  custodial  decision  could  become  a  “legal \n23 proceeding,”  including  educational  services,  recreational  activities,  and  routine \n24 medical care.  Plaintiffs provide no basis for this sweeping view of the statute, which \n25 was intended to “provide[ ] for pro bono legal representation for unaccompanied \n26 alien children in their immigration matters.”  154 Cong. Rec. S10, 886-87. \n27 Second, Plaintiffs’ claim under the HSA fails.  Like the TVPRA, the HSA \n28 does not create a right to access government-funded counsel to challenge ORR \n59 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 68 of 69   Page ID\n#:5806\n \n1 decisions on step-up, release, and medication.  Section 279(b)(1)(A) of the HSA \n2 directs ORR to “develop[ ] a plan to be submitted to Congress on how to ensure that \n3 qualified and independent legal counsel is timely appointed to represent the interests \n4 of each such [unaccompanied alien] child,” but does not require ORR to provide \n5 access to government-funded legal representation in these matters.   \n6 Third, Plaintiffs’ claim fails under federal immigration regulations, including \n7 8 C.F.R. §§ 287.3(c), 1003.62, 1240.10(a)(2), and 1292.1 et seq.  Those regulations \n8 generally provide arriving aliens with the opportunity to retain their own counsel in \n9 proceedings before U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Executive \n10 Office for Immigration Review, but make no mention of legal representation in ORR \n11 custody to contest other  decisions unrelated  to immigration relief,  nor do  they \n12 require access to government-funded counsel.   \n13 Finally,  ORR’s  policies  and  procedures  for  the legal-representation  class \n14 comport with the APA.  Plaintiffs make no independent claim under the APA beyond \n15 their procedural-due-process claim, which fails for the reasons described, and the \n16 relief they seek under the APA is the same relief they seek on their due-process \n17 claim—access to government-funded legal counsel to challenge ORR decisions on \n18 step-up, release, and medication.  In addition, like the TVPRA, HSA, and federal \n19 immigration regulation provisions discussed above, the APA does not separately \n20 impose a right to access government-funded counsel.   \n21 The legal-representation class’s claims under all these statutes fail as a matter \n22 of law.  \n23\nVI.  Conclusion \n24\nThe Court should grant summary judgment for Defendants on the step-up, \n25\nunfit-custodian, and legal-representation class’s claims.   \n26\n27\n28\n60 \nMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 263-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 69 of 69   Page ID\n#:5807\n \n1 Dated: October 2, 2020      Respectfully submitted, \n \n2\nJEFFREY B.

Scott Lloyd, the Director of the Office of Refugee \nResettlement (“ORR”).  [Doc. # 1.]  The CAC alleges that ORR maintains certain policies and/or \npractices relating to the detention of alien minors that violate (inter alia) the Due Process Clause \nof the Fifth Amendment, the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization \nAct (“TVPRA”), and the consent decree issued in Flores v. Sessions, No. CV 85-4544-DMG \n(AGRx) (C.D. Cal.) [Doc. # 101] (“Flores Agreement”).  CAC at 1–5, 39–41.1 \n \n  On August 3, 2018, Plaintiff Lucas R. filed a motion for preliminary injunction, wherein \nhe seeks an order requiring ORR to immediately release him to Madelyn R., his next friend and \nsister.  [Doc. # 29.]  The motion for preliminary injunctive relief has since been fully briefed.  \n[Doc. ## 44, 53.]  Having duly considered the parties’ written submissions, the Court DENIES, \nwithout prejudice, Lucas R.’s motion for the reasons set forth below. \n \nI. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n \n  Lucas  R.  is  a  native  and  citizen  of  Guatemala  who  entered  the  United  States  in \nFebruary 2018.  See CAC at ¶ 10; Opp’n re Lucas R.’s MPI at 2; Pls.’ Class Cert. Mot., Ex. 21 at \n¶ 2 (Lucas R. Decl.) [Doc. # 35-12]; CAC at ¶ 21; Opp’n re Lucas R.’s MPI at 2; Opp’n re Lucas \nR.’s MPI, Ex. 45 at ¶ 7 (De La Cruz Decl.) [Doc. # 44-1].  On or about February 12, 2018, ORR \nassumed custody of Lucas and placed him in the Southwest Key Hacienda del Sol shelter in \n                                                 \n1 All page references herein are to page numbers inserted by the CM/ECF system. \n \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 79   Filed 09/06/18   Page 2 of 9   Page ID #:3043\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741-DMG (PLAx)  Date  September 6, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v.

[Doc. # 44-1].  On May 21, 2018, ORR \ntransferred Lucas to Shiloh Residential Treatment Center (“Shiloh RTC”) in Manvel, Texas.  \nLucas R.’s MPI, Ex. 42 at 2–3 (ORR Transfer Request and Tracking Form) [Doc. # 39-9].  To this \nday, ORR continues to detain Lucas at Shiloh RTC.  See Lucas R.’s MPI at 9; Opp’n re Lucas R.’s \nMPI at 10–11; Opp’n re Lucas R.’s MPI, Ex. 45 at ¶¶ 13, 20, 22 (De La Cruz Decl.) [Doc. # 44-\n1].   \n \n    In mid-February 2018, Madelyn R. asked ORR to release Lucas to her custody.  See Pls.’ \nClass Cert. Mot., Ex. 22 at ¶ 6 (Madelyn R. Decl.) [Doc. # 35-13].  In March 2018, ORR conducted \na home study to determine whether Madelyn was a suitable custodian for Lucas.  See id. at ¶ 10.  \nThe social worker visited Madelyn’s home on several more occasions over the next two weeks.  \nSee id. at ¶¶ 11–12.  Approximately one month after the social worker’s final visit, she informed \nMadelyn that ORR denied her request because an individual suspected of being a resident of the \nhome had refused to be fingerprinted.  See id. at ¶ 13.  Although the social worker stated that this \ndecision was final, she failed to provide Madelyn with a written decision or explain whether \nMadelyn could appeal ORR’s denial of her request.  See id. \n \nLucas claims that he is entitled to release from custody under Paragraphs 14 and 18 of the \nFlores Agreement, which require ORR to release a minor from its custody without unnecessary \ndelay, see Flores Agreement at ¶¶ 14, 18, and under Section 235(c)(2)(A) of the TVPRA, which \nobligates ORR to promptly place an unaccompanied alien child in the least restrictive setting that \nis in the best interest of the child, see 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(2)(A).  Lucas further contends that ORR \nhas deprived him of his constitutional rights to physical liberty, family unity, and familial \nassociation without due process of law by failing to provide Lucas or Madelyn with “any \nmeaningful process by which they may contest ORR’s [decision that] Madelyn [is] an unfit \ncustodian.”  See Lucas R.’s MPI at 23–26.  Lucas argues that these constitutional violations warrant \nhis immediate release to Madelyn because ORR “cannot be reasonably expected to fashion” an \nadequate hearing procedure “without protracting Lucas’s detention even more and causing him \neven greater irreparable injury.”  See Reply re Lucas R.’s MPI at 13–14. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2 The TVPRA provides that HHS is responsible for the custody of all unaccompanied alien children.  See 8 \nU.S.C. § 1232(b)(1).  ORR is the division of HHS that has been entrusted with that responsibility.  See Saravia v. \nSessions, 280 F. Supp. 3d 1168, 1178 (N.D. Cal. 2017).  There is no dispute that Lucas is an unaccompanied alien \nchild.  See Compl. at ¶ 10; Opp’n re Lucas R.’s MPI at 2.  \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 79   Filed 09/06/18   Page 3 of 9   Page ID #:3044\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741-DMG (PLAx)  Date  September 6, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v. Alex Azar, et al.  Page  3 of 9 \n   \n \nII. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n \n  A plaintiff seeking preliminary injunctive relief must show that:  (1) he or she is likely to \nsucceed on the merits; (2) he or she is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary \nrelief; (3) the balance of equities tips in his or her favor; and (4) an injunction is in the public \ninterest.  Toyo Tire Holdings of Ams. Inc. v. Cont’l Tire N. Am., Inc., 609 F.3d 975, 982 (9th Cir. \n2010) (citing Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008)).  An injunction is also \nappropriate when a plaintiff raises “serious questions going to the merits,” demonstrates that “the \nbalance of hardships tips sharply in [his or her] favor,” and “shows that there is a likelihood of \nirreparable injury and that the injunction is in the public interest.”  All. for the Wild Rockies v. \nCottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1135 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Lands Council v. McNair, 537 F.3d 981, \n987 (9th Cir. 2008)).  “A federal court may issue an injunction if it has personal jurisdiction over \nthe parties and subject matter jurisdiction over the claim; it may not attempt to determine the rights \nof persons not before the court.”  Zepeda v. INS, 753 F.2d 719, 727 (9th Cir. 1983).  \n \nIII. \nDISCUSSION \n \n  Lucas R. identifies three jurisdictional bases for his request for preliminary injunctive \nrelief:  (1) the Flores Agreement, (2) 28 U.S.C. section 2241 (i.e., the habeas statute for federal \nprisoners), and (3) the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”).3  See Reply re Lucas R.’s MPI at \n9–17.  None of these authorities, however, permits this Court to grant Lucas the relief he seeks—\ni.e., his release from ORR’s custody.  See Notice of Lucas R.’s MPI at 3 [Doc. # 29]; Lucas R.’s \nMPI at 6 (“Plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction requiring [Lucas’s] immediate release.”). \n \n                                                 \n3 Lucas R. also argues that the TVPRA and 28 U.S.C. section 1331 “vest[] th[is] Court with full authority to \ncompel ORR to place [him] in the least restrictive setting consistent with his best interests and to do so without further \ndelay.”  See Reply re Lucas R.’s MPI at 15.  Admittedly, the TVPRA does provide that “an unaccompanied alien child \nin the custody of [ORR] shall be promptly placed in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child.”  \nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(2)(A).  Nonetheless, Lucas. R. does not identify any provision of the TVPRA that confers \njurisdiction on this Court to release him from custody, nor is it apparent that any such provision exists.  Further, 28 \nU.S.C. section 1331 does not authorize this Court to compel Lucas R.’s release.  Rather, it simply confers jurisdiction \nover causes of action created by federal law and certain state law claims that are predicated on federal law.  See \nWilliston Basin Interstate Pipeline Co. v. An Exclusive Gas Storage Leasehold & Easement in the Cloverly \nSubterranean Geological Formation, 524 F.3d 1090, 1100 (9th Cir. 2008).  Moreover, Section 1331, standing alone, \ndoes not waive ORR’s sovereign immunity.  See Holloman v. Watt, 708 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1983) (“Section \n1331 does not waive the government’s sovereign immunity from suit.”); FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 475 (1994) \n(“Absent a waiver, sovereign immunity shields the Federal Government and its agencies from suit.”).      \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 79   Filed 09/06/18   Page 4 of 9   Page ID #:3045\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741-DMG (PLAx)  Date  September 6, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v. Alex Azar, et al.  Page  4 of 9 \n   \n \nA.  The Flores Agreement Does Not Authorize This Court to Release Lucas R. \n \nLucas  R.  asserts  that  this  Court  has  jurisdiction  to  hear  his  motion  for  preliminary \ninjunction pursuant to Paragraph 37 of the Flores Agreement.  See Reply re Lucas R.’s MPI at 9–\n12.  Paragraph 37 provides in pertinent part:  “This paragraph provides for the enforcement, in this \nDistrict Court, of the provisions of this Agreement except for claims brought under Paragraph 24.”  \nFlores Agreement at ¶ 37. \n \nIn turn, Paragraph 24B of the Agreement provides: \n \nAny minor who disagrees with the INS’s determination to place that minor in a \nparticular type of facility, or who asserts that the licensed program in which he or \nshe has been placed does not comply with the standards set forth in Exhibit 1 \nattached hereto, may seek judicial review in any United States District Court with \njurisdiction and venue over the matter to challenge that placement determination or \nto allege noncompliance with the standards set forth in Exhibit 1.  In such an action, \nthe United States District Court shall be limited to entering an order solely affecting \nthe individual claims of the minor bringing the action. \n \nId. at ¶ 24B. \n \n  Lucas R. argues that Paragraph 24B is inapplicable because it governs only challenges to \na minor’s placement in a particular ORR facility.  See Reply re Lucas R.’s MPI at 9 & n.2.  An \nobjection to ORR’s refusal to release a particular Flores Class Member from its custody, however, \nalso constitutes a challenge to the agency’s decision to place the Class Member in an ORR facility \nrather than release the minor to a proposed custodian.  This conclusion is reinforced by certain \nprovisions of the Flores Agreement that indicate that release and placement decisions are not \nmutually exclusive.  See, e.g., Flores Agreement at ¶ 11 (providing that the purpose of the \nAgreement is to ensure that ORR “place[s] each detained minor in the least restrictive setting \nappropriate to the minor’s age and special needs,” which suggests that declining to release a minor \nis a “placement” decision); see also Powerine Oil Co. v. Superior Court of L.A. Cty., 37 Cal. 4th \n377, 391 (2003) (“[L]anguage in a contract must be construed in the context of that instrument as \na whole . . . .” (quoting Bank of the West v.

Alex Azar, et al.  Page  5 of 9 \n   \n \npetition for writ of habeas corpus is not the only means by which he can obtain the relief sought, \nLucas concedes that he challenges ORR’s decision not to place him in the least restrictive setting—\ni.e., in the custody of Madelyn R.  See Reply re Lucas R.’s MPI at 12 (“[Lucas R.’s] claim that \nORR’s refusing to place him with Madelyn violates the TVPRA is not about ‘release’ at all.  \nRather, it is about placement in the least restrictive setting consistent with his best interests.” \n(emphasis added)); see also Proposed Order re Lucas R.’s MPI at 3 (“IT IS ORDERED that \nDefendants shall place Lucas with his sister, Madelyn R., by no later than September 3, 2018.” \n(emphasis added)) [Doc. # 53-4].  It follows that no matter how Lucas chooses to frame the relief \nhe seeks, it falls within the scope of Paragraph 24B and is excluded from Paragraph 37’s general \ngrant of jurisdiction to this Court. \n \n  In arriving at this conclusion, the Court does not suggest that all disputes relating to the \nrelease of Flores Class Members must be brought in the “United States District Court with \njurisdiction and venue over the matter[.]”  Flores Agreement at ¶ 24B.  The text of Paragraphs 24B \nand 37 establishes that:  (1) such courts have the exclusive authority to hear a particular minor’s \nassertion that he or she should be released from ORR custody or afforded the benefits of a licensed \nprogram, and (2) this Court is empowered to remedy systemic violations of the Agreement that \naffect multiple Class Members (e.g., a class-wide challenge to an ORR policy affecting the release \nrights of all minors in the agency’s custody based on the nationwide standards of the Flores \nAgreement).  Specifically, Paragraph 24B discusses “that minor[’s]” (i.e., the minor bringing a \nclaim covered by that provision) placement and Exhibit 1 challenges, and provides that the district \ncourt hearing those claims “shall be limited to entering an order solely affecting the individual \nclaims of the minor bringing the action.”  See id. (emphasis added); see also MacKinnon v. Truck \nIns. Exch., 31 Cal. 4th 635, 653 (2003) (holding that the “plain meaning” of a contract term is \ncontrolling); Flores v. Lynch, 828 F.3d 898, 903 (9th Cir. 2016) (“The [Flores Agreement] \ngenerally provides for the enforcement in the Central District of California, but allows individual \nchallenges to placement or detention conditions to be brought in any district court with jurisdiction \nand venue.”  (emphasis added) (citations omitted) (citing Flores Agreement at ¶¶ 24B, 37)). \n \nThe  apparent  purpose  of  Paragraph  24B  further  supports  this  interpretation.    See \nMacKinnon,  31  Cal.  4th  at  653  (holding  that  the  “purpose”  of  a  clause  is  relevant  to  its \ninterpretation, although it is not determinative).  If a minor asserts that he or she should be released \n(e.g., because a particular custodian is suitable) or that he or she has been denied the protections \nof Exhibit 1 to the Agreement (e.g., the class member was administered psychotropic medication \nin violation of state child welfare laws), then a court must undertake an individualized (as opposed \nto class-wide) analysis of such claims.  In such cases, the convenience of the parties and witnesses \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 79   Filed 09/06/18   Page 6 of 9   Page ID #:3047\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741-DMG (PLAx)  Date  September 6, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v.

Page  6 of 9 \n   \n \nwould most often weigh in favor of requiring the minor to bring the action in one particular \nforum—i.e., the district court that otherwise has jurisdiction and venue.5 \n \nIn sum, the Court lacks jurisdiction over Lucas R.’s claim that he is entitled to release under \nthe Flores Agreement because it does not fall within the scope of Paragraph 37.  Rather, his claim \nis governed by Paragraph 24B, and must therefore be brought in the “United States District Court \nwith jurisdiction and venue over the matter[.]”  See Flores Agreement at ¶ 24B.  \n \nB.  This Court Lacks Jurisdiction to Release Lucas R. Under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 \n \n“[I]n habeas challenges to present physical confinement—‘core challenges’—the default \nrule is that the proper respondent is the warden of the facility where the prisoner is being held, not \nthe Attorney General or some other remote supervisory official.”6  See Rumsfeld v. Padilla, 542 \nU.S. 426, 436 (2004) (emphasis added).  The rationale for this so-called “immediate custodian \nrule” is that the habeas statute “contemplate[s] a proceeding against some person who has the \nimmediate custody of the party detained, with the power to produce the body of such party before \nthe court or judge that he may be liberated if no sufficient reason is shown to the contrary.”  See \nid. at 435 (quoting Wales v. Whitney, 114 U.S. 564, 574 (1885)) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nIn cases in which this rule applies, only the district court with territorial jurisdiction over the \ncustodian may entertain a habeas petition.  See id. at 436, 442–47 (holding that the U.S. District \nCourt for the District of South Carolina had exclusive jurisdiction over a habeas petition because \nthat was the location of the commander of the brig in which Padilla was confined).   \n \nAlthough Rumsfeld did not explicitly decide whether the immediate custodian rule applies \nto habeas petitions filed by detained aliens, see id. at 435–36 & n.8, “[t]here is no compelling \ndistinction between criminal custody and immigration custody” that warrants a departure from the \ndefault rule.  See Saravia v. Sessions, 280 F. Supp. 3d 1168, 1185 (N.D. Cal. 2017); see also \nDrakoulis v. Ashcroft, 356 F. Supp. 2d 367, 369–71 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (applying the immediate \ncustodian rule to a habeas petition filed by an alien, which requested release from the custody of \nImmigration and Customs and Enforcement); Deng v. Garcia, 356 F. Supp. 2d 367, 374–75 \n(E.D.N.Y. 2005) (same).  If the immediate custodian rule did not apply to the latter, then any alien \n                                                 \n5 If a minor raises such claims in a habeas petition, then the appropriate forum is the district in which the \nimmediate custodian is located.  See infra Part III.B; cf. 28 U.S.C. § 2241(c)(1) (“The writ of habeas corpus shall not \nextend to a prisoner unless . . . [h]e is in custody under or by color of the authority of the United States . . . .”). \n \n6 Although Padilla did not define the precise contours of “core challenges,” the Court held that a request for \nrelease from custody constitutes such a challenge.  See Rumsfeld v. Padilla, 542 U.S. 426, 438 (2004) (“[T]he \ntraditional rule [is] that a prisoner seeking release from confinement must sue his ‘jailer.’”). \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 79   Filed 09/06/18   Page 7 of 9   Page ID #:3048\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741-DMG (PLAx)  Date  September 6, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v. Alex Azar, et al.  Page  7 of 9 \n   \n \ncould name a high-level supervisory official (e.g., the HHS Secretary or the Director of ORR) as \na  respondent,  “a  result  ‘the  statutory  language,  established  practice,  and  [Supreme  Court] \nprecedent’ counsel against.”  See Saravia, 280 F. Supp. 3d at 1187 (alteration in original) (quoting \nPadilla, 542 U.S. at 439–40).  Additionally, if an alien is detained by a state, local, or private entity \nat the behest of the federal government, then the “immediate custodian” is “the federal official \ntasked with ensuring that [the facility] complies with the requirements of its contract . . . .”  See id. \nat 1186.  This is because the alien is in custody “pursuant to the power and authority of the federal \ngovernment[,]” which is authorized to produce the alien before the court.  See id.  Moreover, the \nstate, local, or private entity has less incentive to defend the detention of the alien than does the \nfederal official charged with overseeing the contract with the facility.  See id.  \n \n  The non-binding decisions that Lucas relies upon for the proposition that the immediate \ncustodian rule does not apply to immigration cases are either unpersuasive or arise in sharply \ndistinguishable contexts.  Bogarin-Flores v. Holder, No. CV 12-0399 JAH(WMc), 2012 WL \n3283287 (S.D. Cal. Aug. 10, 2012), declined to apply the immediate custodian rule because the \nwarden of the private detention facility at issue had no legal authority to release the petitioner and \nno binding Ninth Circuit authority explicitly holds that the rule applies in the immigration context.  \nSee id. at *1–2.  Yet, Padilla rejected the proposition that the proper respondent is an individual \nwho exercises “legal control” over the petitioner.  542 U.S. at 439 (“In challenges to present \nphysical confinement, we reaffirm that the immediate custodian, not a supervisory official who \nexercises legal control, is the proper respondent.”).   As Saravia points out, the federal official \nresponsible for enforcing the contract—and not the warden of a private contract facility—is the \nimmediate custodian.  See Saravia, 280 F. Supp. 3d at 1186–87 (concluding that the federal official \nresponsible for enforcing the contract “exercises more immediate control over a contract facility \nthan the Attorney General or another department head”).  Furthermore, the absence of direct \ncontrolling authority is not a persuasive reason to depart from Padilla’s “default rule.”  See, e.g., \nBracamontes-Reyes v. Sessions, No. CV 18-01301-PHX-DLR (JZB), 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n76756, at *4 (D. Ariz. May 4, 2018) (declining to apply the immediate custodian rule simply \nbecause of “the absence of any Ninth Circuit authority precluding [the alien] from naming the \nAttorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, or the ICE Phoenix Field Office Director \nas Respondents”).    \n \nFurther, Rivera v. Holder, 307 F.R.D. 539 (W.D. Wash. 2015), does not mandate a \ndeparture from the default rule because that case did not involve a “core” habeas claim.  There, the \nplaintiff challenged a policy under which all requests for conditional parole were denied, and she \nsought a class-wide order granting aliens new bond hearings in which immigration judges would \nproperly consider such requests.  See id. at 543–44, 548 & n.1.  This distinction between core and \nnon-core habeas challenges is essential because Padilla explicitly held that “the immediate \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 79   Filed 09/06/18   Page 8 of 9   Page ID #:3049\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741-DMG (PLAx)  Date  September 6, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v. Alex Azar, et al.  Page  8 of 9 \n   \n \nphysical custodian rule, by its terms, does not apply when a habeas petitioner challenges something \nother than his present physical confinement.”  See Padilla, 542 U.S. at 438; see also Saravia, 280 \nF. Supp. 3d at 1180–82, 1190 (concluding that the immediate custodian was the proper respondent \nfor a habeas petition seeking release from custody, but that she was not the proper defendant on a \nclaim requesting a hearing before an immigration judge). \n \nAccordingly, the Court concludes that the immediate custodian rule applies to Lucas R.’s \nrequest for on order releasing him from ORR’s custody.  Saravia found that where, as here, ORR \ndetained a minor in a facility operated by a contractor, see Lucas R.’s MPI at 15 n.3; Opp’n re \nLucas R.’s MPI at 10, the immediate custodian was the ORR Federal Field Specialist responsible \nfor enforcing the contract with that facility, see Saravia, 280 F. Supp. 3d at 1186.  The ORR \nFederal Field Specialist responsible for managing the agency’s contract with Shiloh RTC is \nMicaela Vergara, who is located in the Southern District of Texas.  See De La Cruz Decl. at ¶ 2 \n[Doc. # 73-1]; 28 U.S.C. § 124(b)(2).  Because this official is not located within the territorial \njurisdiction of this Court and cannot be named as a party herein, Section 2241 does not authorize \nthis Court to order Lucas’s release.    \n   \nC.  This Court Lacks Jurisdiction to Release Lucas R. Under the APA \n   \n  The APA permits judicial review of an agency action only if “there is no other adequate \nremedy in a court[,]” see 5 U.S.C. § 704, which means that a federal court lacks jurisdiction over \nan APA claim if another statute would allow a court to review the allegedly unlawful agency \naction, see Coos Cty. Bd. of Cty. Cm’rs v. Kempthorne, 531 F.3d 791, 810 (9th Cir. 2008) (citing \n5 U.S.C. § 704); Brem-Air Disposal v. Cohen, 156 F.3d 1002, 1004–05 (9th Cir. 1998) (“Under \nAPA § 10(c), codified at 5 U.S.C. § 704, federal courts lack jurisdiction over APA challenges \nwhenever Congress has provided another ‘adequate remedy.’ * * * ‘If a plaintiff can bring suit \nagainst the responsible federal agencies under [another statute], this action precludes an additional \nsuit under the APA.’” (quoting Envtl. Def. Fund v. Tidwell, 837 F. Supp. 1344, 1356 (E.D.N.C. \n1992))).  An adequate alternative to an APA challenge brought in this Court is available to Lucas \nR.—i.e., a petition for writ of habeas corpus filed in the United States District Court for the \nSouthern District of Texas.7  See 28 U.S.C. § 2241(c)(3) (providing that the writ is available to \n                                                 \n7 To the extent that the APA authorizes Lucas R. to seek release from custody, he may raise such claims in a \nhabeas petition.  See 5 U.S.C. § 703 (“The form of proceeding for judicial review is . . . any applicable form of legal \naction, including actions for . . . habeas corpus.”); Cornejo-Barreto, 218 F.3d 1004, 1015 n.12 (9th Cir. 2000) \n(“[H]abeas corpus is an appropriate form of action under the APA.”), overruled in part on another ground by Trinidad \ny Garcia v. Thomas, 683 F.3d 952, 957 (9th Cir. 2012) (en banc).  Any such habeas petition, however, cannot be \nentertained by this Court.  See supra Part III.B.  \n \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 79   Filed 09/06/18   Page 9 of 9   Page ID #:3050\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741-DMG (PLAx)  Date  September 6, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v.

Page  9 of 9 \n   \n \nprisoners “in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties if the United States”); \nTrinidad y Garcia, 683 F.3d at 956 (“The writ of habeas corpus historically provides a remedy to \nnon-citizens challenging executive detention.”); see also Reply re Lucas R.’s MPI at 13 n.6 \n(conceding that “aliens may challenge detention via habeas corpus provided they are not under a \nfinal order of removal”).  Therefore, the APA does not authorize Lucas R. to challenge his present \nphysical confinement in this judicial district.8    \n \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n \n  For the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES, without prejudice, Lucas R.’s motion for \npreliminary injunction, due to lack of jurisdiction.  This Order in no way precludes Lucas R. from \nseeking appropriate relief in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas \nagainst ORR Federal Field Specialist Micaela Vergara. \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n                                                 \n8 Lucas R. nonetheless insists that “the principles animating habeas relief as an exclusive remedy have no \napplication here.”  See Reply re Lucas R.’s MPI at 13 n.6.  In particular, he asserts that Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. \n475 (1973), held only that a state prisoner may not challenge his or her custody via a claim under 42 U.S.C. section \n1983 but must instead file a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. section 2254.  See Reply re Lucas R.’s MPI at 13 n.6.  \nThe Court agrees that Preiser has no bearing on Lucas’s motion.  See Preiser, 411 U.S. at 500 (“[W]e hold today that \nwhen a state prisoner is challenging the very fact or duration of his physical imprisonment, . . . his sole federal remedy \nis a writ of habeas corpus.”).  Nevertheless, as explained above, Lucas cannot obtain the relief he seeks from this \nCourt. \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n ",

This declaration is based on my personal knowledge, except as to those matters \n4  based on information and belief, which I believe to be true. If called to testify in this case, \n5  I would testify competently about these facts. \n6  2.  My name is Julie DeAun Graves. I am a physician licensed to practice medicine in \n7  the states of Florida, Maryland, New Jersey, Texas, Virginia, Wisconsin, and in the \n8  District of Columbia. I am currently working in family medicine and public health private \n9  practice as the Associate Director of Clinical Services at Nurx. I have been certified by \n10  the American Board of Family Medicine since 1989.  \n11  3.  I am a public health physician, previously serving as Regional Medical Director for \n12  the Texas Department of State Health Services for the Houston region, as Medical \n13  Services Coordinator for the Texas Department of Aging and Disability Services, and as \n14  a medical consultant to the Texas Medical Board. I managed the H1N1 influenza \n15  outbreak for the Texas State Supported Living Centers and oversaw public health efforts \n16  for the Houston region (population seven million) for Ebola virus, Zika virus, West Nile \n17  virus, highly pathogenic avian influenza, tuberculosis outbreaks, and natural disasters.  \n18  4.  I obtained my medical degree and completed a surgical internship then family \n19  medicine residency at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas, \n20  Texas, then completed a fellowship in faculty development at the McLennan County \n21  Medical Education and Research Foundation in Waco, Texas. I earned a Master’s degree \n22  in Public Health and a Doctor of Philosophy in Management, Policy, and Statistics at the \n23  University of Texas School of Public Health. I have practiced family medicine and public \n24  health since 1989, and in 2018-2019 I was Associate Professor and Vice-Chair for \n25  Education at Georgetown University School of Medicine. At Nurx I care for patients \n26  seeking contraception, HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) prevention, sexually \n27  transmitted infection diagnosis and treatment, cervical cancer screening, and coronavirus \n28  (SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19) testing and treatment.

During my over 30 years of medical practice I have cared for immigrant \n5  populations in Florida, Maryland, Texas, Wisconsin, and Washington, DC, and I am co-\n6  author of a research journal article about migrant workers’ health. While serving as \n7  Regional Medical Director for the Texas Department of State Health Services I \n8  collaborated with Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee \n9  Resettlement (ORR) facilities on investigations and control of tuberculosis and measles \n10  cases among detainees and provided public health services to those detainees and their \n11  families. I am familiar with ORR facilities and the conditions faced by detained children \n12  and by the staff members who work there. In August of 2019 I volunteered with a \n13  Catholic Charities facility in Laredo, Texas and provided medical care to people just \n14  released from detention in Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) facilities. I observed the ill \n15  health, exhaustion, and malnutrition evident in these people. Additionally, because of my \n16  work as Medical Services Coordinator for the Texas Department of Aging and Disability \n17  Services overseeing health care in the State Supported Living Centers, which are \n18  congregate living settings, I am familiar with the risks to residents and staff from any \n19  infectious disease, and particularly those with high infectivity, such as this coronavirus \n20  SARS-CoV-2. I attach a copy of my curriculum vitae. \n21   \n22  COVID-19 \n23  6.  COVID-19 is an illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is a novel \n24  coronavirus that was first detected in humans during the outbreak (now a pandemic) we \n25  are experiencing now. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that as of \n26  March 24, 2020 at 6:00 a.m, there are 46,481 cases reported in the United States, with \n27  cases reported in every state, and there are 593 reported deaths so far. See \n28 \n \n \nDeclaration of Dr. Julie DeAun Graves \n2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-4   Filed 03/25/20   Page 4 of 29   Page ID\n #:5048\n \n1  www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6. \n2  On March 18, 2020, there were 7,038 cases reported and 150 deaths.  \n3  7.  The United States is in the early stages of the pandemic, and because there has \n4  been insufficient testing for cases, the reported cases numbers are lower than actual cases, \n5  despite the high probability that there are many more infected individuals in the \n6  population. The spread of the virus is faster and more dangerous when people are in close \n7  quarters. People with health conditions such as diabetes, asthma, emphysema, heart \n8  disease, kidney disease, pregnancy, diabetes, cancer, HIV, and autoimmune diseases such \n9  as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis are at higher risk for severe illness, complications, and \n10  death from COVID-19. People over age 60 have higher death rates, but severe cases of \n11  illness and deaths are reported in people of all ages, including children. The ratio of cases \n12  of COVID-19 to deaths from this illness is much higher than for other contagious \n13  diseases such as influenza. The SARS-CoV-2 virus damages the lung tissue, which \n14  means that even those who recover need prolonged medical care and rehabilitation. They \n15  are likely to have permanent disability from loss of lung capacity. The heart itself can be \n16  infected, and kidneys and the nervous system can also be impacted and damaged \n17  permanently. \n18  8.  There is no vaccine and no treatment for COVID-19. We only have prevention as a \n19  tool to stop the pandemic. If people remain in congregate settings, most of them plus the \n20  staff who work with them will become infected, and many will die or have permanent \n21  disability. COVID-19 is transmitted from person to person by breathing in expired air \n22  that contains the droplets an infected person has coughed or the virus they have shed, or \n23  by touching a surface with the virus on it, unless there is full personal protective \n24  equipment: mask, gloves, gown, plus thorough hand washing before putting on the \n25  equipment and after removing it. The only way to avoid transmission is for people to \n26  distance themselves at least six feet from others (commonly referred to as “social \n27  distancing” or “physical distancing”). People should not be in large buildings full of \n28  many people, and people must practice frequent and thorough hand washing with \n \n \nDeclaration of Dr. Julie DeAun Graves \n3 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-4   Filed 03/25/20   Page 5 of 29   Page ID\n #:5049\n \n1  adequate soap and water. If we do not implement these two steps – physical distancing \n2  and hand washing – the pandemic will only continue to spread and the number of deaths \n3  will continue to increase. \n4  9.  There is a national shortage of COVID-19 tests. Medical providers cannot test \n5  everyone who they believe should be tested, and so are presuming that people with a \n6  certain set of symptoms are positive. This is an appropriate and common situation with \n7  new infectious diseases and is a widely recognized strategy in public health disease \n8  control. Individuals and communities should not rely solely on the criteria of a positive \n9  COVID-19 test to implement precautions or quarantine symptomatic persons. A public \n10  health response requiring widespread preventive measure of physical distancing and \n11  appropriate hand washing is our only tool to slow the spread of the virus.  \n12   \n13  HHS Facility Conditions \n14  10. I am advised that Department of Health and Human Service Office of Refugee \n15  Resettlement (ORR) typically houses many dozens, and in some cases hundreds, of \n16  children in congregate facilities, where they share toilets, sinks, and showers, eat \n17  together, participate in recreation and classroom instruction together, sleep in common \n18  rooms, and have inadequate space to permit recommended physical distancing. In my \n19  opinion, under current pandemic conditions such congregate settings are inherently \n20  unsafe and unsanitary, and they become increasingly dangerous in proportion to the \n21  number of children whom ORR places in such facilities. Other commonly reported \n22  conditions, such the frequency of rotating staff members, further increase the risk that \n23  children will contract COVID-19.  \n24  11. Congregate care facilities holding large numbers of people are particularly \n25  dangerous during a pandemic. Physical distancing of six feet between all people is \n26  essential to preventing the spread of COVID-19 disease. The virus is transmitted in \n27  respiratory droplets and can hang in the air for several minutes – due to its tiny size (one \n28  micron diameter) and its very light weight. The virus also can live on metal, glass, \n \n \nDeclaration of Dr. Julie DeAun Graves \n4 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-4   Filed 03/25/20   Page 6 of 29   Page ID\n #:5050\n \n1  plastic, concrete, and other surfaces for up to ten days and maintain its infectivity. \n2  Consistently maintaining the appropriate distance of six feet in addition to adequate \n3  cleaning of all surfaces is not possible in such facilities. \n4   \n5  Immigrant Population Vulnerabilities \n6  12. Immigrants, particularly recently arrived children, are at particular risk of \n7  contracting COVID-19. Common health problems afflicting children in different forms \n8  of immigration custody (CBP, ICE, and ORR) include malnutrition, asthma, heart \n9  disease, immunosuppression, inadequate vaccination, diarrheal illness, sleep disorders, \n10  post-traumatic stress disorder, exhaustion, and seizure disorders. People with these \n11  health issues are among those at high risk for serious illness and death if they contract \n12  COVID-19. People with post-traumatic stress disorder have weakened immune systems \n13  and increased vulnerability to infection.  \n14   \n15  ORR Guidance re: COVID-19 \n16  13.  I have read and analyzed the March 13, 2020 “COVID-19 Interim Guidance for \n17  ORR Programs” (ORR Guidance). While the document states that it “is based on the \n18  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations,” the policies \n19  contravene multiple CDC recommendations and are inadequate to protect children \n20  forced to live in congregate settings against COVID-19 illness.  \n21  14. Most importantly, the ORR Guidance makes no mention of social or physical \n22  distancing between children or staff, nor of limiting the gathering of groups of children \n23  or staff. As discussed above, there is widespread consensus in the public health \n24  community that social distancing is critical to preventing the further spread of COVID-\n25  19. \n26  15. The CDC has repeatedly called for the American public to limit social interactions \n27  and avoid gatherings in groups of more than 10 people. \n28 \n \n \nDeclaration of Dr. Julie DeAun Graves \n5 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-4   Filed 03/25/20   Page 7 of 29   Page ID\n #:5051\n \n1  16. The ORR Guidance nowhere mentions that children should have independent \n2  access to hand washing and sanitizing supplies. As discussed above, regular \n3  handwashing with water and soap is critical to preventing the further spread of COVID-\n4  19. \n5  17. The ORR Guidance sets out no plan to manage spread of the disease when more \n6  children need to be quarantined than isolation rooms can accommodate.  \n7  18. The ORR Guidance does not provide information on managing the spread of \n8  disease among particularly vulnerable children, such as those with heart disease, \n9  diabetes, asthma or other chronic respiratory disease, or those with compromised \n10  immune systems. The Guidance directs no special measures to protect these populations. \n11  The same protocols apply to all children whether or not they have an increased risk of \n12  serious illness or death.  \n13  19. The ORR Guidance does not provide a screening or testing protocol for children \n14  not deemed to be “at risk” but still exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms. If a child has a \n15  fever, this would likely be caught by ORR’s twice-daily temperature check requirement. \n16  However, if a child has a cough or shortness of breath and is not defined as “at risk” due \n17  to no known COVID-19 exposure, then that may be a missed case that allows the virus \n18  to spread. \n19  20. It is my expert opinion that the policies expressed in the ORR Guidance are \n20  inadequate and contrary to current CDC guidelines as well as public health practice \n21  being adopted during the current pandemic. We are currently in an emergency situation. \n22  Even if ORR issues more stringent guidance in the upcoming days or weeks, it will \n23  likely be too late, especially for facilities located in areas of high community \n24  transmission, such as New York and California.  \n25 \nCDC COVID-19 Guidance for Correctional and Detention Facilities \n26 \n21. I have reviewed the CDC “Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus \n27 \nDisease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities” (CDC Detention \n28 \n \n \nDeclaration of Dr. Julie DeAun Graves \n6 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-4   Filed 03/25/20   Page 8 of 29   Page ID\n #:5052\n \n1  Facility Guidance) issued March 23, 2020, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-\n2  ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html. The CDC \n3  Detention Facility Guidance highlight many ways in which people in detention facilities \n4  and congregate environments are at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19.  \n5  22. The CDC Detention Facility Guidance acknowledges that “(i)ncarcerated/detained \n6  persons live, work, eat, study, and recreate within congregate environments, heightening \n7  the potential for COVID-19 to spread once introduced.” Further, it states that “(t)here \n8  are many opportunities for COVID-19 to be introduced into a correctional or detention \n9  facility, including daily staff ingress and egress; transfer of incarcerated/detained \n10  persons between facilities and systems, to court appearances, and to outside medical \n11  visits; and visits from family, legal representatives, and other community members.” \n12  23. The CDC Detention Facility Guidance instructs facilities to “implement social \n13  distancing strategies to increase the physical space between incarcerated/detained \n14  persons (ideally six feet between all individuals, regardless of the presence of \n15  symptoms,” but acknowledges that “not all strategies will be feasible in all facilities.” \n16  Social distancing does not work when it is only followed part of the time. The CDC’s \n17  “Interim U.S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of \n18  Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with \n19  Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)” issued on March 7, 2020 states that “(d)ata are \n20  insufficient to precisely define the duration of time that constitutes a prolonged \n21  exposure. However, until more is known about transmission risks, it is reasonable to \n22  consider an exposure greater than a few minutes as a prolonged exposure. Brief \n23  interactions are less likely to result in transmission; however, clinical symptoms of the \n24  patient and type of interaction (e.g., did the patient cough directly into the face of the \n25  HCP) remain important” and “(e)xamples of brief interactions include: briefly entering \n26  the patient room without having direct contact with the patient or their \n27  secretions/excretions, brief conversation at a triage desk with a patient who was not \n28  wearing a facemask.”  Repeated interactions, even brief, that occur throughout the day in \n \n \nDeclaration of Dr. Julie DeAun Graves \n7 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-4   Filed 03/25/20   Page 9 of 29   Page ID\n #:5053\n \n1  these facilities, are each an independent opportunity for transmission of infection. \n2  Because it is not known whether people who have recovered from infection develop \n3  immunity to subsequent infections with COVID-19, and because transmission may occur \n4  when the infected person has no symptoms, each interaction between a staff member and \n5  a detainee and each interaction between two individual detainees or two individual staff \n6  members is an independent opportunity with the same risk of infection. The risks are \n7  additive with each interaction. \n8  24.  The CDC Detention Facility Guidance states that “The ability of \n9  incarcerated/detained persons to exercise disease prevention measures (e.g., frequent \n10  hand washing) may be limited and is determined by the supplies provided in the facility \n11  and by security considerations.” Facilities are instructed to provide no-cost access to \n12  liquid soap (or bar soap), running water, and hand drying supplies. \n13  25. Detention facilities are instructed to “(o)ffer the seasonal influenza vaccine to all \n14  incarcerated/detained persons (existing population and new intakes) and staff throughout \n15  the influenza seasons.” Preventing influenza cases in these facilities can speed the \n16  detection of COVID-19 cases and reduce pressure on healthcare resources.  \n17  26.  Even if all of the recommendations made in the CDC Detention Facility Guidance \n18  are followed, the conditions of detention are such that detained children in ORR custody \n19  would still be at high risk of contracting COVID-19. Because this virus is transmitted \n20  through droplets, through the air, and on surfaces, and because people who do not have \n21  symptoms but are infected transmit the virus to others, even one infected person in a \n22  facility, either a detainee or a staff member, can infect the majority of people in the \n23  facility. This is worsened by the crowded conditions in the facilities. \n24  27.  If we are to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus, we must relocate as many \n25  people as possible out of congregate settings. If we prevent people from practicing \n26  adequate physical distancing from others and the other steps outlined above, institutional \n27  centers will become clusters in which high percentages of persons are infected with \n28 \n \n \nDeclaration of Dr. Julie DeAun Graves \n8 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-4   Filed 03/25/20   Page 10 of 29   Page ID\n #:5054\n \n1  COVID-19. Such clusters not only endanger those who are immediately infected, but the \n2  health of those residing in the communities in which congregate facilities are located.  \n3   \n4  Recommendations \n5  28.  It is my professional opinion that all children held in ORR facilities should be \n6  moved immediately to settings with adequate opportunity for safe distance and adequate \n7  hand washing and sanitation, and be afforded a seasonal influenza vaccine immediately. \n8  Even if ORR facilities intend to meet the guidance put forth by the CDC on March 23, \n9  2020, they are not uniformly meeting it now, and so people are at risk for serious illness, \n10  death, and disability today. \n11  29.  The Office of Refugee Resettlement should immediately expedite the release of \n12  detained children to their sponsors. Once released, children should self-quarantine for 14 \n13  days in order to ensure that they are not exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 and to \n14  ensure the safety of their new communities. Reducing the population of children in ORR \n15  facilities is critical to minimizing the risk for outbreaks in facilities and preventing the \n16  spread of the virus to children, ORR staff members, and communities across the United \n17  States. \n18  30.  To the extent there is absolutely no other option but for children to remain detained \n19  in congregate settings, basic principles of public health require HHS to:  \n20  a.  Allow each child enough space to maintain a distance of at least six feet from \n21  others;  \n22  b.  Ensure that all children have free and consistent access to water, soap, and \n23  cleaning products;  \n24  c.  Transfer children from high-density placements (facilities with 10 or more \n25  children) to low-density placements; \n26  d.  Ensure that symptomatic children are immediately removed from the general \n27  population and have prompt access to single-occupancy negative pressure \n28  rooms plus adequate medical care;  \n \n \nDeclaration of Dr. Julie DeAun Graves \n9 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-4   Filed 03/25/20   Page 11 of 29   Page ID\n #:5055\n \n1  e.  Ensure that facilities have plans in place if they have to quarantine more \n2  children than there are single-occupancy rooms; \n3  f.  Provide staff and children with adequate personal protective equipment \n4  including fit-tested N-95 masks and adequate instruction regarding proper \n5  donning and doffing procedures. Require appropriate measures for children \n6  who are not “at-risk” under ORR’s definition but are still exhibiting symptoms \n7  consistent with COVID-19 and those who are at high-risk for serious illness due \n8  to pre-existing conditions or compromised immune systems. \n9  31.  A principal objective of physical distancing and self-quarantine requirements is to \n10  slow the spread of COVID-19 illness so as not to overwhelm available medical care \n11  resources. I am advised that ORR may contract with congregate detention facilities in \n12  rural areas, which typically have fewer medical resources than are to be found in large \n13  towns and cities. An outbreak of COVID-19 disease in such facilities would quickly \n14  overwhelm local health care resources, requiring ORR either to leave children untreated \n15  or else transport them to distant hospitals and clinics, where they would risk spreading \n16  the infection to more health care workers and the community in regions in which the \n17  disease has yet to become prevalent. It is therefore in the public’s interest to remove as \n18  many children from congregate care as soon as possible.  \n19  32.  Even if all of the above recommendations for HHS facilities are followed, the \n20  inherent conditions of congregate detention are such that detained children would still be \n21  at high risk for exposure to COVID-19. In order to contain the spread of the COVID-19 \n22  virus, and to protect children, the government must relocate as many people as possible \n23  out of HHS facilities.  \n24  33.

Background and Qualifications \n \n1.  I am Dr. Jaimie Meyer, an Assistant Professor of Medicine at Yale School of Medicine \nand Assistant Clinical Professor of Nursing at Yale School of Nursing in New Haven, \nConnecticut. I am board certified in Internal Medicine, Infectious Diseases and Addiction \nMedicine.  I completed my residency in Internal Medicine at NY Presbyterian Hospital at \nColumbia, New York, in 2008. I completed a fellowship in clinical Infectious Diseases at \nYale School of Medicine in 2011 and a fellowship in Interdisciplinary HIV Prevention at \nthe Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS in 2012. I hold a Master of Science in \nBiostatistics and Epidemiology from Yale School of Public Health. \n2.  I have worked for over a decade on infectious diseases in the context of jails and prisons. \nFrom 2008-2016, I served as the Infectious Disease physician for York Correctional \nInstitution in Niantic, Connecticut, which is the only state jail and prison for women in \nConnecticut.  In that capacity, I was responsible for the management of HIV, Hepatitis C, \ntuberculosis, and other infectious diseases in the facility.  Since then, I have maintained a \ndedicated HIV clinic in the community for patients returning home from prison and jail.  \nFor over a decade, I have been continuously funded by the NIH, industry, and \nfoundations for clinical research on HIV prevention and treatment for people involved in \nthe criminal justice system, including those incarcerated in closed settings (jails and \nprisons) and in the community under supervision (probation and parole).  I have served as \nan expert consultant on infectious diseases and women’s health in jails and prisons for the \nUN Office on Drugs and Crimes, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and others.  I also served \nas an expert health witness for the US Commission on Civil Rights Special Briefing on \nWomen in Prison.      \n3.  I have written and published extensively on the topics of infectious diseases among \npeople involved in the criminal justice system including book chapters and articles in \nleading peer-reviewed journals (including Lancet HIV, JAMA Internal Medicine, \nAmerican Journal of Public Health, International Journal of Drug Policy) on issues of \nprevention, diagnosis, and management of HIV, Hepatitis C, and other infectious diseases \namong people involved in the criminal justice system. \n4.  My C.V. includes a full list of my honors, experience, and publications, and it is attached \nas Exhibit A.  \n5.  I am being paid $1,000 for my time reviewing materials and preparing this report. \n6.  I have not testified as an expert at trial or by deposition in the past four years.  \nII.  Heightened Risk of Epidemics in Jails and Prisons \n \n1 \n \nPage038\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-5   Filed 03/25/20   Page 3 of 24   Page ID\n #:5076\nCaCsaes e1 :12:02-0c-vc-v0-10800738-6A K  DHo  c Dumoceunmt e1n-1t 54 2   F  iFleilde d0 30/32/11/62/02 0   P  aPgaeg e2  2o fo 2f 323\n \n7.  The risk posed by infectious diseases in jails and prisons is significantly higher than in \nthe community, both in terms of risk of transmission, exposure, and harm to individuals \nwho become infected. There are several reasons this is the case, as delineated further \nbelow.    \n8.  Globally, outbreaks of contagious diseases are all too common in closed detention \nsettings and are more common than in the community at large.  Prisons and jails are not \nisolated from communities.  Staff, visitors, contractors, and vendors pass between \ncommunities and facilities and can bring infectious diseases into facilities.  Moreover, \nrapid turnover of jail and prison populations means that people often cycle between \nfacilities and communities.  People often need to be transported to and from facilities to \nattend court and move between facilities.  Prison health is public health. \n9.  Reduced prevention opportunities: Congregate settings such as jails and prisons allow for \nrapid spread of infectious diseases that are transmitted person to person, especially those \npassed by droplets through coughing and sneezing. When people must share dining halls, \nbathrooms, showers, and other common areas, the opportunities for transmission are \ngreater. When infectious diseases are transmitted from person to person by droplets, the \nbest initial strategy is to practice social distancing.  When jailed or imprisoned, people \nhave much less of an opportunity to protect themselves by social distancing than they \nwould in the community. Spaces within jails and prisons are often also poorly ventilated, \nwhich promotes highly efficient spread of diseases through droplets. Placing someone in \nsuch a setting therefore dramatically reduces their ability to protect themselves from \nbeing exposed to and acquiring infectious diseases.  \n10. Disciplinary segregation or solitary confinement is not an effective disease containment \nstrategy.  Beyond the known detrimental mental health effects of solitary confinement, \nisolation of people who are ill in solitary confinement results in decreased medical \nattention and increased risk of death.  Isolation of people who are ill using solitary \nconfinement also is an ineffective way to prevent transmission of the virus through \ndroplets to others because, except in specialized negative pressure rooms (rarely in \nmedical units if available at all), air continues to flow outward from rooms to the rest of \nthe facility.  Risk of exposure is thus increased to other people in prison and staff.  \n11. Reduced prevention opportunities: During an infectious disease outbreak, people can \nprotect themselves by washing hands.  Jails and prisons do not provide adequate \nopportunities to exercise necessary hygiene measures, such as frequent handwashing or \nuse of alcohol-based sanitizers when handwashing is unavailable.  Jails and prisons are \noften under-resourced and ill-equipped with sufficient hand soap and alcohol-based \nsanitizers for people detained in and working in these settings.  High-touch surfaces \n(doorknobs, light switches, etc.) should also be cleaned and disinfected regularly with \nbleach to prevent virus spread, but this is often not done in jails and prisons because of a \nlack of cleaning supplies and lack of people available to perform necessary cleaning \nprocedures.  \n12. Reduced prevention opportunities: During an infectious disease outbreak, a containment \nstrategy requires people who are ill with symptoms to be isolated and that caregivers have \n2 \n \nPage039\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-5   Filed 03/25/20   Page 4 of 24   Page ID\n #:5077\nCaCsaes e1 :12:02-0c-vc-v0-10800738-6A K  DHo  c Dumoceunmt e1n-1t 54 2   F  iFleilde d0 30/32/11/62/02 0   P  aPgaeg e3  3o fo 2f 323\n \naccess to personal protective equipment, including gloves, masks, gowns, and eye \nshields.  Jails and prisons are often under-resourced and ill-equipped to provide sufficient \npersonal protective equipment for people who are incarcerated and caregiving staff, \nincreasing the risk for everyone in the facility of a widespread outbreak.  \n13. Increased susceptibility: People incarcerated in jails and prisons are more susceptible to \nacquiring and experiencing complications from infectious diseases than the population in \nthe community.1 This is because people in jails and prisons are more likely than people in \nthe community to have chronic underlying health conditions, including diabetes, heart \ndisease, chronic lung disease, chronic liver disease, and lower immune systems from \nHIV. \n14. Jails and prisons are often poorly equipped to diagnose and manage infectious disease \noutbreaks.  Some jails and prisons lack onsite medical facilities or 24-hour medical care.  \nThe medical facilities at jails and prisons are almost never sufficiently equipped to handle \nlarge outbreaks of infectious diseases. To prevent transmission of droplet-borne \ninfectious diseases, people who are infected and ill need to be isolated in specialized \nairborne negative pressure rooms.  Most jails and prisons have few negative pressure \nrooms if any, and these may be already in use by people with other conditions (including \ntuberculosis or influenza).  Resources will become exhausted rapidly and any beds \navailable will soon be at capacity. This makes both containing the illness and caring for \nthose who have become infected much more difficult. \n15. Jails and prisons lack access to vital community resources to diagnose and manage \ninfectious diseases. Jails and prisons do not have access to community health resources \nthat can be crucial in identifying and managing widespread outbreaks of infectious \ndiseases.  This includes access to testing equipment, laboratories, and medications. \n16. Jails and prisons often need to rely on outside facilities (hospitals, emergency \ndepartments) to provide intensive medical care given that the level of care they can \nprovide in the facility itself is typically relatively limited. During an epidemic, this will \nnot be possible, as those outside facilities will likely be at or over capacity themselves.   \n17. Health safety: As an outbreak spreads through jails, prisons, and communities, medical \npersonnel become sick and do not show up to work. Absenteeism means that facilities \ncan become dangerously understaffed with healthcare providers. This increases a number \nof risks and can dramatically reduce the level of care provided.  As health systems inside \nfacilities are taxed, people with chronic underlying physical and mental health conditions \nand serious medical needs may not be able to receive the care they need for these \nconditions.  As supply chains become disrupted during a global pandemic, the availability \nof medicines and food may be limited. \n18. Safety and security: As an outbreak spreads through jails, prisons, and communities, \ncorrectional officers and other security personnel become sick and do not show up to \n                                                 \n1 Active case finding for communicable diseases in prisons, 391 The Lancet 2186 (2018), \nhttps://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31251-0/fulltext. \n3 \n \nPage040\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-5   Filed 03/25/20   Page 5 of 24   Page ID\n #:5078\nCaCsaes e1 :12:02-0c-vc-v0-10800738-6A K  DHo  c Dumoceunmt e1n-1t 54 2   F  iFleilde d0 30/32/11/62/02 0   P  aPgaeg e4  4o fo 2f 323\n \nwork.  Absenteeism poses substantial safety and security risk to both the people inside \nthe facilities and the public.   \n19. These risks have all been borne out during past epidemics of influenza in jails and \nprisons. For example, in 2012, the CDC reported an outbreak of influenza in 2 facilities \nin Maine, resulting in two inmate deaths.2  Subsequent CDC investigation of 995 inmates \nand 235 staff members across the 2 facilities discovered insufficient supplies of influenza \nvaccine and antiviral drugs for treatment of people who were ill and prophylaxis for \npeople who were exposed.  During the H1N1-strain flu outbreak in 2009 (known as the \n“swine flu”), jails and prisons experienced a disproportionately high number of cases.3  \nEven facilities on “quarantine” continued to accept new intakes, rendering the quarantine \nincomplete. These scenarios occurred in the “best case” of influenza, a viral infection for \nwhich there was an effective and available vaccine and antiviral medications, unlike \nCOVID-19, for which there is currently neither. \nIII.  Profile of COVID-19 as an Infectious Disease4 \n \n20.  The novel coronavirus, officially known as SARS-CoV-2, causes a disease known as \nCOVID-19.  The virus is thought to pass from person to person primarily through \nrespiratory droplets (by coughing or sneezing) but may also survive on inanimate \nsurfaces.  People seem to be most able to transmit the virus to others when they are \nsickest but it is possible that people can transmit the virus before they start to show \nsymptoms or for weeks after their symptoms resolve.  In China, where COVID-19 \noriginated, the average infected person passed the virus on to 2-3 other people; \ntransmission occurred at a distance of 3-6 feet.  Not only is the virus very efficient at \nbeing transmitted through droplets, everyone is at risk of infection because our immune \nsystems have never been exposed to or developed protective responses against this virus. \nA vaccine is currently in development but will likely not be able for another year to the \ngeneral public.  Antiviral medications are currently in testing but not yet FDA-approved, \nso only available for compassionate use from the manufacturer.  People in prison and jail \nwill likely have even less access to these novel health strategies as they become available. \n                                                 \n2 Influenza Outbreaks at Two Correctional Facilities — Maine, March 2011, Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention (2012), \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6113a3.htm. \n3 David M.

Most people (80%) who become infected with COVID-19 will develop a mild upper \nrespiratory infection but emerging data from China suggests serious illness occurs in up \nto 16% of cases, including death.5  Serious illness and death is most common among \npeople with underlying chronic health conditions, like heart disease, lung disease, liver \ndisease, and diabetes, and older age.6  Death in COVID-19 infection is usually due to \npneumonia and sepsis.  The emergence of COVID-19 during influenza season means that \npeople are also at risk from serious illness and death due to influenza, especially when \nthey have not received the influenza vaccine or the pneumonia vaccine. \n22. The care of people who are infected with COVID-19 depends on how seriously they are \nill.7  People with mild symptoms may not require hospitalization but may continue to be \nclosely monitored at home.  People with moderate symptoms may require hospitalization \nfor supportive care, including intravenous fluids and supplemental oxygen.  People with \nsevere symptoms may require ventilation and intravenous antibiotics. Public health \nofficials anticipate that hospital settings will likely be overwhelmed and beyond capacity \nto provide this type of intensive care as COVID-19 becomes more widespread in \ncommunities. \n23. COVID-19 prevention strategies include containment and mitigation.  Containment \nrequires intensive hand washing practices, decontamination and aggressive cleaning of \nsurfaces, and identifying and isolating people who are ill or who have had contact with \npeople who are ill, including the use of personal protective equipment.  Jails and prisons \nare totally under-resourced to meet the demand for any of these strategies.  As infectious \ndiseases spread in the community, public health demands mitigation strategies, which \ninvolves social distancing and closing other communal spaces (schools, workplaces, etc.) \nto protect those most vulnerable to disease.  Jails and prisons are unable to adequately \nprovide social distancing or meet mitigation recommendations as described above. \n24. The time to act is now.  Data from other settings demonstrate what happens when jails \nand prisons are unprepared for COVID-19.  News outlets reported that Iran temporarily \nreleased 70,000 prisoners when COVID-19 started to sweep its facilities.8  To date, few \nstate or federal prison systems have adequate (or any) pandemic preparedness plans in \n                                                 \n5 Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Situation Summary, Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (March 14, 2020), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/summary.html. \n6 Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, \nChina: a retrospective cohort study.

Risk of COVID-19 in ICE’s NYC-Area Detention Facilities \n \n25. I have reviewed the following materials in making my assessment of the danger of \nCOVID-19 in the Bergen, Essex, Hudson, and Orange County jails (“ICE’s NYC-area \njails”): (1) a declaration by Marinda van Dalen, a Senior Attorney in the Health Justice \nProgram at New York Lawyers for the Public Interest (NYLPI); (2) the report Detained \nand Denied: Healthcare Access in Immigration Detention, released by NYLPI in 2017; \nand (3) the report Ailing Justice: New Jersey, Inadequate Healthcare, Indifference, and \nIndefinite Confinement in Immigration Detention, released by Human Rights First in \n2018.  \n26.  Based on my review of these materials, my experience working on public health in jails \nand prisons, and my review of the relevant literature, it is my professional judgment that \nthese facilities are dangerously under-equipped and ill-prepared to prevent and manage a \nCOVID-19 outbreak, which would result in severe harm to detained individuals, jail and \nprison staff, and the broader community. The reasons for this conclusion are detailed as \nfollows.  \n27. The delays in access to care that already exist in normal circumstances will only become \nworse during an outbreak, making it especially difficult for the facilities to contain any \ninfections and to treat those who are infected. \n28. Failure to provide individuals with continuation of the treatment they were receiving in \nthe community, or even just interruption of treatment, for chronic underlying health \nconditions will result in increased risk of morbidity and mortality related to these chronic \nconditions.  \n29. Failure to provide individuals adequate medical care for their underlying chronic health \nconditions results in increased risk of COVID-19 infection and increased risk of \ninfection-related morbidity and mortality if they do become infected. \n30. People with underlying chronic mental health conditions need adequate access to \ntreatment for these conditions throughout their period of detention.  Failure to provide \nadequate mental health care, as may happen when health systems in jails and prisons are \ntaxed by COVID-19 outbreaks, may result in poor health outcomes.  Moreover, mental \nhealth conditions may be exacerbated by the stress of incarceration during the COVID-19 \npandemic, including isolation and lack of visitation.  \n                                                 \n9 Luke Barr & Christina Carrega, State prisons prepare for coronavirus but federal prisons not \nproviding significant guidance, sources say, ABC News (March 11, 2020), \nhttps://abcnews.go.com/US/state-prisons-prepare-coronavirus-federal-prisons-providing-\nsignificant/story?id=69433690. \n6 \n \nPage043\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-5   Filed 03/25/20   Page 8 of 24   Page ID\n #:5081\nCaCsaes e1 :12:02-0c-vc-v0-10800738-6A K  DHo  c Dumoceunmt e1n-1t 54 2   F  iFleilde d0 30/32/11/62/02 0   P  aPgaeg e7  7o fo 2f 323\n \n31. Failure to keep accurate and sufficient medical records will make it more difficult for the \nfacilities to identify vulnerable individuals in order to both monitor their health and \nprotect them from infection.  Inadequate screening and testing procedures in facilities \nincrease the widespread COVID-19 transmission.  \n32. Language barriers will similarly prevent the effective identification of individuals who \nare particularly vulnerable or may have symptoms of COVID-19. Similarly, the failure to \nprovide necessary aids to individuals who have auditory or visual disabilities could also \nlimit the ability to identify and monitor symptoms of COVID-19.   \n33. The commonplace neglect of individuals with acute pain and serious health needs under \nordinary circumstances is also strongly indicative that the facilities will be ill-equipped to \nidentify, monitor, and treat a COVID-19 epidemic. \n34. The failure of these facilities to adequately manage single individuals in need of \nemergency care is a strong sign that they will be seriously ill-equipped and under-\nprepared when a number of people will need urgent care simultaneously, as would occur \nduring a COVID-19 epidemic.  \n35. For individuals in these facilities, the experience of an epidemic and the lack of care \nwhile effectively trapped can itself be traumatizing, compounding the trauma of \nincarceration.  \nV.  Conclusion and Recommendations \n \n36. For the reasons above, it is my professional judgment that individuals placed in ICE’s \nNYC-area jails are at a significantly higher risk of infection with COVID-19 as compared \nto the population in the community and that they are at a significantly higher risk of harm \nif they do become infected. These harms include serious illness (pneumonia and sepsis) \nand even death.  \n37. Reducing the size of the population in jails and prisons can be crucially important to \nreducing the level of risk both for those within those facilities and for the community at \nlarge. \n38. As such, from a public health perspective, it is my strong opinion that individuals who \ncan safely and appropriately remain in the community not be placed in ICE’s NYC-area \njails at this time. I am also strongly of the opinion that individuals who are already in \nthose facilities should be evaluated for release. \n \n39. This is more important still for individuals with preexisting conditions (e.g., heart \ndisease, chronic lung disease, chronic liver disease, suppressed immune system, diabetes) \nor who are over the age of 60. They are in even greater danger in these facilities, \nincluding a meaningfully higher risk of death.  \n40. It is my professional opinion that these steps are both necessary and urgent. The horizon \nof risk for COVID-19 in these facilities is a matter of days, not weeks. Once a case of \n7 \n \nPage044\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-5   Filed 03/25/20   Page 9 of 24   Page ID\n #:5082\nCaCsaes e1 :12:02-0c-vc-v0-10800738-6A K  DHo  c Dumoceunmt e1n-1t 54 2   F  iFleilde d0 30/32/11/62/02 0   P  aPgaeg e8  8o fo 2f 323\n \nCOVID-19 identified in a facility, it will likely be too late to prevent a widespread \noutbreak.  \n41. Health in jails and prisons is community health. Protecting the health of individuals who \nare detained in and work in these facilities is vital to protecting the health of the wider \ncommunity.  \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. \n \n \nMarch 1__5, 2020            __________________________________ \nNew Haven, Connecticut           Dr.  JJaaiimmiiee  MMeeyyer \n8 \n \nPage045\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-5   Filed 03/25/20   Page 10 of 24   Page ID\n #:5083\nCaCsaes e1 :12:02-0c-vc-v0-10800738-6A K  DHo  c Dumoceunmt e1n-1t 54 2   F  iFleilde d0 30/32/11/62/02 0   P  aPgaeg e9  9o fo 2f 323\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:40)(cid:59)(cid:43)(cid:44)(cid:37)(cid:44)(cid:55)(cid:3)(cid:36)(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\nPage046\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-5   Filed 03/25/20   Page 11 of 24   Page ID\n #:5084\nCaCsaes e1 :12:02-0c-vc-v0-10800738-6A K  DHo  c Dumoceunmt e1n-1t 54 2   F  iFleilde d0 30/32/11/62/02 0   P  aPgaeg e1 01 0o fo 2f 323\nJaimie Meyer, MD, MS, FACP \nCCURRICULUM VITAE \n \nDate of Revision:  November 20, 2019 \nName:  Jaimie Meyer, MD, MS, FACP \nSchool:  Yale School of Medicine \n \nEducation: \nBA, Dartmouth College Anthropology 2000 \nMD, University of Connecticut School of Medicine 2005 \nMS, Yale School of Public Health Biostatistics and Epidemiology 2014 \n \nCareer/Academic Appointments: \n2005 - 2008  Residency, Internal Medicine, NY Presbyterian Hospital at Columbia, New York, NY \n2008 - 2011  Fellowship, Infectious Diseases, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT \n2008 - 2012  Clinical Fellow, Infectious Diseases, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT \n2010 - 2012  Fellowship, Interdisciplinary HIV Prevention, Center for Interdisciplinary Research on \nAIDS, New Haven, CT \n2012 - 2014  Instructor, AIDS, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT \n2014 - present  Assistant Professor, AIDS, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT \n2015 - 2018  Assistant Clinical Professor, Nursing, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT \n \nBoard Certification: \nAB of Internal Medicine, Internal Medicine, 08-2008, 01-2019 \nAB of Internal Medicine, Infectious Disease, 10-2010 \nAB of Preventive Medicine, Addiction Medicine, 01-2018 \n \nProfessional Honors & Recognition: \nInternational/National/Regional \n2018  NIH Center for Scientific Review, Selected as Early Career Reviewer \n2017  Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, Doris Duke Charitable Foundation Scholar \n2016  American College of Physicians, Fellow \n2016  NIH Health Disparities, Loan Repayment Award Competitive Renewal \n2016  AAMC, Early Career Women Faculty Professional Development Seminar \n2014  NIH Health Disparities, Loan Repayment Program Award \n2014  NIDA, Women & Sex/Gender Differences Junior Investigator Travel Award \n2014  International Women's/Children's Health & Gender Working Group, Travel Award \n2014  Patterson Trust, Awards Program in Clinical Research \n2013  Connecticut Infectious Disease Society, Thornton Award for Clinical Research \n2011  Bristol Myers-Squibb, Virology Fellows Award \n  1 \nPage047\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-5   Filed 03/25/20   Page 12 of 24   Page ID\n #:5085\nCaCsaes e1 :12:02-0c-vc-v0-10800738-6A K  DHo  c Dumoceunmt e1n-1t 54 2   F  iFleilde d0 30/32/11/62/02 0   P  aPgaeg e1 11 1o fo 2f 323\nJaimie Meyer, MD, MS, FACP \n2006  NY Columbia Presbyterian, John N.

I have published over 25 peer-reviewed \npapers in academic journals related to prison health care and am a former Associate Editor of the International \nJournal of Prisoner Health Care. I am the court appointed monitor for the consent decree in litigation involving \nPage 1 of 7 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-6   Filed 03/25/20   Page 3 of 8   Page ID\n #:5100\n \nDepartment of Homeland Security’s Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL). One of \nus (Dr. Allen) has conducted numerous investigations of immigration detention facilities on \nCRCL’s behalf over the past five years. We both are clinicians and continue to see patients, with \none of us (Dr. Rich) currently providing care to coronavirus infected patients in an ICU setting. \n  \nAs experts in the field of detention health, infectious disease, and public health, we are gravely \nconcerned about the need to implement immediate and effective mitigation strategies to slow the \nspread of the coronavirus and resulting infections of COVID-19. In recent weeks, attention has \nrightly turned to the public health response in congregate settings such as nursing homes, college \ncampuses, jails, prisons and immigration detention facilities (clusters have already been \nidentified in Chinese and Iranian prisons according to news reports2 and an inmate and an officer \nhave reportedly just tested positive at New York’s Rikers Island).3 Reporting in recent days \nreveals that immigrant detainees at ICE’s Aurora facility are in isolation for possible exposure to \ncoronavirus.4 And a member of ICE’s medical staff at a private detention center in New Jersey \nhas now been reported to have tested positive for coronavirus.5  \n \nWe have shared our concerns about the serious medical risks from specific public health and \nsafety threats associated with immigration detention with CRCL’s Officer Cameron Quinn in an \ninitial letter dated February 25, 2020, and a subsequent letter of March 13, 2020. We offered to \n \nmedical care at Riverside County Jails. I have consulted on detention health issues both domestically and \ninternationally for the Open Society Institute and the International Committee of the Red Cross, among others. I \nhave worked with the Institute of Medicine on several workshops related to detainee healthcare and serve as a \nmedical advisor to Physicians for Human Rights. I am the co-founder and co-director of the Center for Prisoner \nHealth and Human Rights at Brown University (www.prisonerhealth.org), and a former Co-Investigator of the \nUniversity of California Criminal Justice and Health Consortium. I am also the founder and medical director of the \nAccess Clinic, a primary care medical home to adults with developmental disabilities. \n \nI, Dr. Josiah (Jody) Rich, MD, MPH, am a Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology at The Warren Alpert Medical \nSchool of Brown University, and a practicing Infectious Disease Specialist since 1994 at The Miriam Hospital \nImmunology Center providing clinical care for over 22 years, and at the Rhode Island Department of Corrections \ncaring for prisoners with HIV infection and working in the correctional setting doing research. I have published \nclose to 190 peer-reviewed publications, predominantly in the overlap between infectious diseases, addictions and \nincarceration.

Additionally, on March 17, 2020 we published an opinion piece in \nthe Washington Post warning of the need to act immediately to stem the spread of the \ncoronavirus in jails and prisons in order to protect not only the health of prisoners and \ncorrections workers, but the public at large.6 \n \nIn the piece we noted the parallel risks in immigration detention. We are writing now to formally \nshare our concerns about the imminent risk to the health and safety of immigrant detainees, as \nwell as to the public at large, that is a direct consequence of detaining populations in congregate \nsettings. We also offer to Congress, as we have to CRCL, our support and assistance in \naddressing the public health challenges that must be confronted as proactively as possible to \nmitigate the spread of the coronavirus both in, and through, immigration detention and \ncongregate settings. \n \nNature of the Risk in Immigration Detention and Congregate Settings \n \nOne of the risks of detention of immigrants in congregant settings is the rapid spread of \ninfectious diseases. Although much is still unknown, the case-fatality rate (number of infected \npatients who will die from the disease) and rate of spread for COVID-19 appears to be as high or \nhigher than that for influenza or varicella (chicken pox). \n \nIn addition to spread within detention facilities, the extensive transfer of individuals (who are \noften without symptoms) throughout the detention system, which occurs with great frequency in \nthe immigration context, could rapidly disseminate the virus throughout the entire system with \ndevastating consequences to public health.7  \n \nAnyone can get a coronavirus infection. While healthy children appear to suffer mildly if they \ncontract COVID-19, they still pose risk as carriers of infection, particularly so because they may \nnot display symptoms of illness.8 Family detention continues to struggle with managing \noutbreaks of influenza and varicella.9 Notably, seven children who have died in and around \n \n6 Josiah Rich, Scott Allen, and Mavis Nimoh, “We must release prisoners to lessen the spread of coronavirus,” \nWashington Post, March 17, 2020, available at https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/17/we-must-\nrelease-prisoners-lessen-spread-coronavirus/. \n7 See Hamed Aleaziz, “A Local Sheriff Said No To More Immigrant Detainees Because of Coronavirus Fears. So \nICE Transferred Them All To New Facilities,” BuzzFeed News, March 18, 2020 (ICE recently transferred170 \nimmigrant detainees from Wisconsin to facilities in Texas and Illinois. “’In order to accommodate various \noperational demands, ICE routinely transfers detainees within its detention network based on available resources and \nthe needs of the agency…’ an ICE official said in a statement.”),  \navailable at https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/hamedaleaziz/wisconsin-sheriff-ice-detainees-coronavirus  \n8 Interview with Jay C.

See, e.g., July 17, 2018 Letter to Senate Whistleblower Caucus Chairs \nfrom Drs. Scott Allen and Pamela McPherson, available at \nhttps://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Doctors%20Congressional%20Disclosure%20SWC.pdf. Those \nconcerns, including but not limited to inadequate medical staffing, a lack of translation services, and the risk of \nPage 3 of 7 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-6   Filed 03/25/20   Page 5 of 8   Page ID\n #:5102\n \nimmigration detention, according to press reports, six died of infectious disease, including three \ndeaths from influenza.10  Containing the spread of an infection in a congregate facility housing \nfamilies creates the conditions where many of those infected children who do not manifest \nsymptoms will unavoidably spread the virus to older family members who may be a higher risk \nof serious illness. \n \nFinally, as you well know, social distancing is essential to slow the spread of the coronavirus to \nminimize the risk of infection and to try to reduce the number of those needing medical treatment \nfrom the already-overwhelmed and inadequately prepared health care providers and facilities. \nHowever, social distancing is an oxymoron in congregate settings, which because of the \nconcentration of people in a close area with limited options for creating distance between \ndetainees, are at very high risk for an outbreak of infectious disease. This then creates an \nenormous public health risk, not only because disease can spread so quickly, but because those \nwho contract COVID-19 with symptoms that require medical intervention will need to be treated \nat local hospitals, thus increasing the risk of infection to the public at large and overwhelming \ntreatment facilities. \n \nAs local hospital systems become overwhelmed by the patient flow from detention center \noutbreaks, precious health resources will be less available for people in the community.To be \nmore explicit, a detention center with a rapid outbreak could result in multiple detainees—five, \nten or more—being sent to the local community hospital where there may only be six or eight \nventilators over a very short period.  As they fill up and overwhelm the ventilator resources, \nthose ventilators are unavailable when the infection inevitably is carried by staff to the \ncommunity and are also unavailable for all the usual critical illnesses (heart attacks, trauma, \netc).  In the alternate scenario where detainees are released from high risk congregate settings, \nthe tinderbox scenario of a large cohort of people getting sick all at once is less likely to occur, \nand the peak volume of patients hitting the community hospital would level out.  In the first \nscenario, many people from the detention center and the community die unnecessarily for want \nof a ventilator. In the latter, survival is maximized as the local mass outbreak scenario is averted. \n \nIt is additionally concerning that dozens of immigration detention centers are in remote areas \nwith limited access to health care facilities. Many facilities, because of the rural locations, have \nonly one on-site medical provider. If that provider gets sick and requires being quarantined for at \nleast fourteen days, the entire facility could be without any medical providers at all during a \nforeseeable outbreak of a rapidly infectious disease. We simply can’t afford a drain on \nresources/medical personnel from any preventable cases.   \n \n \n \n \n \ncommunication breakdowns and confusion that results from different lines of authority needing to coordinate \nbetween various agencies and partners from different government programs and departments responsible for \ndetention programs with rapid turnover, all continue to contribute to heightened risks to meeting the medical \nchallenges posed by the spread of the coronavirus.  \n10 Nicole Acevedo, “Why are children dying in U.S. custody?,” NBC News, May 29, 2019, available at   \nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/why-are-migrant-children-dying-u-s-custody-n1010316 \nPage 4 of 7 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-6   Filed 03/25/20   Page 6 of 8   Page ID\n #:5103\n \nProactive Approaches Required \n \nBefore coronavirus spreads through immigration detention, proactivity is required in three \nprimary areas: 1) Processes for screening, testing, isolation and quarantine; 2) Limiting transport \nand transfer of immigrant detainees; and 3) Implementing alternatives to detention to facilitate as \nmuch social distancing as possible. \n \nProtocols for early screening, testing, isolation and quarantine exist in detention settings to \naddress infectious diseases such as influenza, chicken pox and measles. However, the track \nrecord of ICE facilities implementing these protocols historically has been inconsistent. In the \ncurrent scenario, with widespread reporting about the lack of available tests for COVID-19 and \nchallenges for screening given the late-onset display of symptoms for what is now a community-\nspread illness, detention facilities, like the rest of country, are already behind the curve for this \nstage of mitigation.  \n \nDetention facilities will need to rapidly identify cases and develop plans to isolate exposed \ncohorts to limit the spread, as well as transfer ill patients to appropriate facilities.  Screening \nshould occur as early as possible after apprehension (including at border holding facilities) to \nprevent introduction of the virus into detention centers. We strongly recommend ongoing \nconsultation with CDC and public health officials to forge optimal infection prevention and \ncontrol strategies to mitigate the health risks to detained patient populations and correctional \nworkers. Any outbreak in a facility could rapidly overwhelm the capacity of healthcare \nprograms.  Partnerships with local public health agencies, hospitals and clinics, including joint \nplanning exercises and preparedness drills, will be necessary.  \n \nTransferring detainees between facilities should be kept to an absolute minimum. The transfer \nprocess puts the immigrants being transferred, populations in the new facilities, and personnel all \nat increased risk of exposure. The nationwide network of detention centers, where frequent and \nroutine inter-facility transfers occur, represents a frighteningly efficient mechanism for rapid \nspread of the virus to otherwise remote areas of the country where many detention centers are \nhoused. \n \nFinally, regarding the need to implement immediate social distancing to reduce the likelihood of \nexposure to detainees, facility personnel, and the general public, it is essential to consider \nreleasing all detainees who do not pose an immediate risk to public safety.  \n \nCongregant settings have a high risk of rapid spread of infectious diseases, and wherever \npossible, public health mitigation efforts involve moving people out of congregate settings (as \nwe are seeing with colleges and universities and K-12 schools).11  Minimally, DHS should \nconsider releasing all detainees in high risk medical groups such as older people and those with \n \n11 Madeline Holcombe, “Some schools closed for coronavirus in US are not going back for the rest of the academic \nyear,” CNN, March 18, 2020, available at https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/18/us/coronavirus-schools-not-going-back-\nyear/index.html; Eric Levenson, Chris Boyette and Janine Mack, “Colleges and universities across the US are \ncanceling in-person classes due to coronavirus,” CNN, March 12, 2020, available at \n \nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/03/09/us/coronavirus-university-college-classes/index.html. \nPage 5 of 7 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-6   Filed 03/25/20   Page 7 of 8   Page ID\n #:5104\n \nchronic diseases. COVID-19 infection among these groups will require many to be transferred to \nlocal hospitals for intensive medical and ventilator care—highly expensive interventions that \nmay soon be in short supply.   \n \nGiven the already established risks of adverse health consequences associated with the detention \nof children and their families,12 the policy of detention of children and their families in should be \nreconsidered in light of these new infectious disease threats so that children would only be \nplaced in congregate detention settings when lower risk community settings are not available and \nthen for as brief a time as possible.   \n \nIn addition, given the low risk of releasing detainees who do not pose a threat to public safety—\ni.e., those only charged with immigration violations—releasing all immigration detainees who do \nnot pose a security risk should be seriously considered in the national effort to stop the spread of \nthe coronavirus.  \n \nSimilarly, the practice of forcing asylum seekers to remain in Mexico has created a de facto \ncongregate setting for immigrants, since large groups of people are concentrated on the US \nsouthern border as a result of the MPP program in the worst of hygienic conditions without any \nbasic public health infrastructure or access to medical facilities or the ability to engage in social \ndistancing as they await asylum hearings, which are currently on hold as a consequence of the \ngovernment’s response to stop the spread of the coronavirus.13 This is a tinderbox that cannot be \nignored in the national strategy to slow the spread of infection.  \n \nICE recently announced that in response to the coronavirus pandemic, it will delay arresting \nimmigrants who do not pose public safety threats, and will also stop detaining immigrants who \nfall outside of mandatory detention guidelines.14 But with reporting that immigrant detainees at \nICE facilities are already being isolated for possible exposure to coronavirus, it is not enough to \nsimply stop adding to the existing population of immigrant detainees. Social distancing through \nrelease is necessary to slow transmission of infection.15  \n \nReassessing the security and public health risks, and acting immediately, will save lives of not \nonly those detained, but also detention staff and their families, and the community-at-large.   \n \n12 Report of the DHS Advisory Committee on Family Residential Centers, September 30, 2016, available at \nhttps://www.ice.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report/2016/ACFRC-sc16093.pdf  \n13 See Rick Jervis, “Migrants waiting at US-Mexico border at risk of coronavirus, health experts warn,” USA Today, \nMarch 17, 2020, available at https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/03/17/us-border-could-hit-hard-\ncoronavirus-migrants-wait-mexico/5062446002/.   \n14 ICE website, Guidance on COVID-19, Immigration and Enforcement Check-Ins, Updated March 18, 2020, 7:45 \npm, available at https://www.ice.gov/covid19.  \n15 Release of immigrants from detention to control the coronavirus outbreak has been recommended by John \nSandweg, former acting head of ICE during the Obama administration, who further noted, \"’The overwhelming \nmajority of people in ICE detention don't pose a threat to public safety and are not an unmanageable flight \nrisk.’…’Unlike the Federal Bureau of Prisons, ICE has complete control over the release of individuals.

I have previously submitted declarations in Flores v. \n5  Barr. \n6  5.  As an Emergency Physician, I am on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n7  Our Emergency Department has and will evaluate patients with febrile influenza-like \n8  illness.  We will determine which patients need COVID-19 testing and/or admission to \n9  the inpatient hospital floor.  As Associate Director of our Pediatric Emergency \n10  Department and an attending physician in the Department, I am well acquainted with and \n11  involved in developing protocols for testing, admissions, cohorting, and personal \n12  protective equipment. As the situation develops, the protocols continue to change.  \n13   \n14  COVID-19 \n15  6.  COVID-19 is the disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.  There are \n16  many coronaviruses which infect animals and people.  SARS-CoV-2, the virus that \n17  causes COVID-19, is worrisome because it is a “new” coronavirus.  Because this is a \n18  new virus, we – as a population and individually – have no immunity.  Novel \n19  coronaviruses have also caused Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and \n20  Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).  Both these diseases are more deadly \n21  but much less infectious than COVID-19.   \n22  7.  From what we know, the SARS-CoV-2 virus spreads mostly by respiratory droplets \n23  (droplets that come out of the respiratory tract when you sneeze, cough, and breathe).  \n24  People get exposed if they breathe in a respiratory droplet from someone with the \n25  virus. People can also get exposed if they touch a surface where a respiratory droplet \n26  landed and then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth.  The virus can then stick to receptors \n27  on the mucous membranes and then be internalized into the epithelial cells and cause \n28  disease.  It is thought that these viral respiratory droplets can last from hours to days \n \n \nDeclaration of Nancy Yvonne Wang, MD \n2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-7   Filed 03/25/20   Page 4 of 9   Page ID\n #:5109\n \n1  depending on the type of surface.  However, appropriate cleaning agents like soap or \n2  alcohol-based cleaner can kill them and prevent the spread of disease.  \n3  8.  Some people infected with COVID-19 do not exhibit the typical symptoms of the \n4  disease (“asymptomatic carriage”).  This makes it very difficult to slow the spread of \n5  the disease without comprehensive public health measures that apply to everyone. \n6  9.  Estimates for the mortality rate of COVID-19 range from 1-3%.  Although older \n7  people and those with co-morbidities have an increased case fatality rate, people of all \n8  ages – including infants and children – can have serious infections which create \n9  significant morbidity and require significant health care resources including \n10  hospitalization.    \n11  10.  The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a “pandemic” (worldwide \n12  spread of new disease) on March 11, 2020. When there is an “epidemic” (regional \n13  spread of disease), the public health system tries to “contain” the disease. When there \n14  is a pandemic, the effort shifts from “containment” to “control and mitigation.”  Since \n15  in the US, it is too late to contain the disease, the focus must shift to disrupting the \n16  disease’s impact by reducing the speed of its spread. This is where we are now.  \n17  Public health efforts are currently aimed at slowing the spread of disease so that health \n18  care facilities are not overwhelmed by the number of patients and there are sufficient \n19  resources to protect health care providers (e.g., protective personal equipment); as \n20  well as to care for patients (e.g. ventilators and ICU beds for those requiring intensive \n21  support).  If the public health system can decrease the number of the infected and sick, \n22  or at least spread that number over a longer period of weeks or months, then the health \n23  care system will not be impossibly overburdened. \n24  11. Although a minority of COVID-19 will become seriously ill and require \n25  hospitalization, this total number will be significant enough to overwhelm our health \n26  care resources and cause huge morbidity and mortality, as is occurring now in Italy.  \n27  12.   COVID-19 has no vaccine nor treatment. Our population has no immunity.  The only \n28  means we have for slowing the disease is prevention.  There are two critical elements \n \n \nDeclaration of Nancy Yvonne Wang, MD \n3 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-7   Filed 03/25/20   Page 5 of 9   Page ID\n #:5110\n \n1  of COVID-19 prevention: social distancing and consistent cleaning of surfaces and \n2  hand washing in order to avoid infection from objects or materials (fomites) that are \n3  likely to have infectious particles on them. The idea of social distancing is to slow the \n4  spread of the disease and decrease the number of people getting sick and seriously \n5  sick.  The general recommendations are to avoid gatherings of groups over 10 and \n6  public spaces because they present a heightened risk of spreading the virus. \n7  Individuals should not be closer than six feet together.  People should thoroughly \n8  wash their hands several times per day, (especially after touching surfaces that are \n9  touched by others and before touching their face and eating) Surfaces must be cleaned \n10  regularly as they can have fomites.  Specific directives from federal, state, and local \n11  public health departments are changing daily, but these basic preventative measures \n12  are clear. \n13  13. Our medical system has limited ability to test for COVID-19. Therefore, best practice \n14  is to quarantine those who are exposed and medically isolate those that are sick.  \n15  Those who are seriously ill must be triaged to hospital care. Given the shortage of \n16  testing capabilities, individuals and communities cannot rely solely on the criteria of a \n17  positive COVID-19 test to implement precautions or quarantine symptomatic persons. \n18  14.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that as of March 24, 2020 at \n19  12:00 am, the virus has infected 382,108 people worldwide, with a total of 16,574 \n20  deaths (4.34% mortality rate). See \n21  www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ec\n22  f6. In the United States, there are 46,450 confirmed cases with 593 deaths. However, \n23  due to barriers to testing, we believe there are many more infections in the United \n24  States than are currently reported. With time, a portion of these cases will progress to \n25  serious disease and for some, death. \n26   \n27   \n28   \n \n \nDeclaration of Nancy Yvonne Wang, MD \n4 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-7   Filed 03/25/20   Page 6 of 9   Page ID\n #:5111\n \n1  DHS and HHS Facility Conditions \n2  15.   In July 2019, I interviewed children and families at CBP facilities in Clint, Texas and \n3  Santa Teresa, New Mexico. We interviewed approximately 70 children and families.  \n4  We were not allowed in the living quarters, but children and families reported that \n5  they shared limited toilets and sinks with many other detainees. Children and families \n6  reported that they had limited access to soap and water to wash their hands. In my \n7  opinion, it would be almost impossible for children and families to remain six feet \n8  away from all other detainees and staff in these facilities. If COVID-19 is introduced \n9  into a CBP facility, conditions like these will easily facilitate the spread of disease.  \n10  16.  In July 2018, I visited the Southwest Key Casa Padre ORR facility in Brownsville, \n11  Texas. At the time of my visit, the facility held over 1,000 children. Children slept in \n12  shared rooms with rows of beds. Children shared bathrooms (showers, toilets, and \n13  sinks) and ate all meals together in large common spaces. Children were also required \n14  to participate in group activities and classes together. In my opinion, it would be \n15  almost impossible for children to remain six feet away from all other children and \n16  staff in this facility and it would be difficult to clean all the surfaces. If COVID-19 is \n17  introduced into an ORR facility, conditions like these will easily facilitate the spread \n18  of disease.   \n19   \n20   Vulnerabilities of Immigrant Populations in Detention \n21  17.  Congregate care facilities, by definition, cannot comply with the recommended public \n22  health measures in this pandemic. Individuals held in congregate facilities cannot \n23  ensure that there is six feet between them and the nearest person at all times. Facilities \n24  that hold large numbers of individuals also require large numbers of staff, which \n25  results in increased exposure to the detained population. \n26  18. Even though the total number of children in ORR custody has declined and ORR care \n27  provider facilities may house fewer children than they did a year ago, congregate care \n28  facilities are still dangerous environments during a pandemic. Public health officials \n \n \nDeclaration of Nancy Yvonne Wang, MD \n5 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-7   Filed 03/25/20   Page 7 of 9   Page ID\n #:5112\n \n1  currently hold that gatherings with more than 10 people are unsafe in the context of \n2  this pandemic.  \n3  19.  In addition to the increased risk of contracting COVID-19 in detention, children and \n4  families with existing poor health and chronic health conditions are at risk of \n5  experiencing more severe illness. Children and families may come the United States \n6  with underlying health conditions, and these health conditions may be exacerbated by \n7  the time in immigration detention. Time spent in immigration detention may also lead \n8  to new health issues for children and families. Many children that I have personally \n9  interviewed in immigration detention have presented with serious health concerns. \n10   \n11  ORR Guidance re: COVID-19 \n12  20. I have reviewed the March 13, 2020 “COVID-10 Interim Guidance for ORR \n13  Programs” (“ORR Guidance”). The policies included are inadequate, contravene \n14  multiple CDC recommendations, and place large numbers of detained children at risk \n15  of contracting COVID-19. Even if ORR were to issue updated guidance requiring \n16  social distancing and increased cleaning standards, from my experience, the time \n17  needed to implement this guidance in ORR care provider facilities would be \n18  insufficient to prevent the exponential disease risk. \n19  21.  The ORR Guidance does not require or even encourage social or physical distancing \n20  between children or staff. The ORR Guidance does not limit or encourage limiting the \n21  gathering of a groups of children or staff for meals, activities, or classes.  \n22  22. The ORR Guidance does not provide information on managing the spread of disease \n23  among particularly vulnerable children, such as those with heart disease, chronic \n24  respiratory disease, or compromised immune systems. The ORR Guidance also does \n25  not provide any special guidelines for preventing the spread of disease to infants in \n26  ORR custody. Infants are particularly vulnerable to serious COVID-19 infection.  \n27  23. The ORR Guidance does not provide any information for facilities on how to explain \n28  or mitigate the negative psychological effect of isolation and quarantine of a child. For \n \n \nDeclaration of Nancy Yvonne Wang, MD \n6 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-7   Filed 03/25/20   Page 8 of 9   Page ID\n #:5113\n \n1  any child, but especially for children that are unaccompanied and without a trusted \n2  caregiver, being placed in isolation may be very traumatizing.  \n3  24. The ORR Guidance does not provide a plan for facilities to manage spread of the \n4  disease when more children need to be quarantined than the facility’s isolation rooms \n5  can accommodate.  \n6  25. The ORR Guidance does not provide a screening or testing or quarantine/isolation \n7  protocol for children not determined to be “at risk” under ORR’s definition but still \n8  exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms. This oversight could lead to missed cases and \n9  contribute to the further spread of the disease. ORR’s determination of risk country \n10  checklist is outdated, given that this is a pandemic. \n11  26. It is my expert opinion that the policies expressed in the ORR Guidance are \n12  inadequate and contrary to current CDC guidelines as well as public health practice \n13  being adopted during the current pandemic.   \n14  Recommendations \n15  27.  ORR should immediately expedite the release of detained children to their sponsors.  \n16  This is particularly urgent for children who have not been exposed to the virus and are \n17  not exhibiting any symptoms and populations at high risk of increased complications \n18  from the disease. Once released, children should self-quarantine for 14 days in order \n19  to ensure that they are not exhibiting symptoms and to ensure the safety of their new \n20  communities. Reducing the population of children in ORR facilities is essential to \n21  minimizing the risk for outbreaks in facilities and preventing the spread of the virus to \n22  children, ORR staff members, and communities across the United States.  \n23  28. To the extent there is absolutely no other option but for children and families to \n24  remain detained in congregate settings, basic principles of public health require DHS \n25  and HHS to:  \n26  a.  Allow each detainee enough space to maintain a distance of at least six feet \n27  from others;  \n28 \n \n \nDeclaration of Nancy Yvonne Wang, MD \n7 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-7   Filed 03/25/20   Page 9 of 9   Page ID\n #:5114\n \n1  b.  Organize meals and sleeping arrangements so that detainees are not exposed to \n2  crowded food lines and cramped sleeping quarters; \n3  c.  Ensure that all detainees have free and consistent access to clean water, soap, \n4  and hand sanitizer;  \n5  d.  Transfer children and families from high-density placements (facilities with 10 \n6  or more children) to low-density placements; \n7  e.  Separate children and families who are at higher risk of severe illness if they \n8  contract an infection from other detainees; \n9  f.  Screen staff who enter and exit the facilities for COVID-19 symptoms twice \n10  daily and prohibit entry if staff exhibit symptoms or report exposure;  \n11  g.  Immediately quarantine any detainee who is symptomatic in a negative pressure \n12  room in order to decrease the risk of infection to others. Given that this is a \n13  pandemic, all symptomatic detainees should be tested for COVID-19. \n14  h.  Even if all of the above recommendations for DHS and HHS facilities are \n15  followed, the inherent conditions of detention are such that detained children \n16  and families would still be at high risk for exposure to COVID-19. In order to \n17  contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus, and to protect children and families, \n18  the government must relocate as many people as possible out of DHS and HHS \n19  facilities. \n20 \n29.

This declaration is based on my personal knowledge.  If called to testify in this \n6  case, I would testify competently about the following facts.  \n7  2.  My name is Anthony Enriquez, Esq. and I am an attorney licensed to practice in \n8  the State of New York.  This declaration describes my experiences and observations \n9  working with unaccompanied migrant youth detained in congregate care facilities in New \n10  York State. These facilities include MercyFirst, Rising Ground, and Catholic Guardian \n11  Services, in addition to others.  \n12   \n13  Experience Serving Youth in ORR Custody \n14  3.  Since January of 2018, I have been the Director of the Unaccompanied Minors \n15  Program Catholic Charities Community Services of the Archdiocese of New York, \n16  (CCCS-NY), a legal service provider that serves youth at MercyFirst, Rising Ground, and \n17  Catholic Guardian Services, in addition to a number of other facilities in New York.  I \n18  supervise a team of nearly 40 attorneys, paralegals, case managers, and operational staff \n19  who together work to represent detained unaccompanied migrant youth seeking relief \n20  before immigration courts and agencies.  Over the last 10 years, Catholic Charities has \n21  represented hundreds of youth in the legal custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement \n22  (ORR) custody.  Although the majority of these youth come from Honduras, Guatemala \n23  and El Salvador, youth placed at this facility may come from all over the world.   \n24  4.  As the legal service provider for MercyFirst, Rising Ground, and Catholic \n25  Guardian Services, our legal staff maintain regular contact with the youth at each of these \n26  facilities.  We provide ongoing consultations and presentations concerning the legal \n27  rights of detained minors. We are also providing direct legal representation to youth \n28  currently detained at these facilities. \n \nDeclaration of Anthony Enriquez \n1 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-8   Filed 03/25/20   Page 3 of 8   Page ID\n #:5117\n \n1  MercyFirst \n2    Background \n3  5.  Since 2014, MercyFirst has been a facility subcontracted by ORR to house \n4  unaccompanied children. It is located in Syosset, New York.     \n5  6.  MercyFirst has two different settings. One of them is a Residential Treatment \n6  Center (RTC) for youth between the ages of 13 and 17. The other houses youth between \n7  the ages of 6 and 17 in congregate or shelter care.  It is my understanding that MercyFirst \n8  is licensed to provide shelter care for up to 60 youth.  The current population of the RTC \n9  setting is approximately seven youths.  The current population of the shelter setting is \n10  approximately 34 youth.   \n11  7.  MercyFirst consists of a campus that includes approximately 5 buildings or “units” \n12  as well as another location with a “unit” where youth are housed in buildings that \n13  accommodate up to 12 youth.  In addition to interaction with other residents, youth in \n14  each unit have regular contact with the various staff that provide daily supervision.  \n15  Children and youth are regularly transported to other buildings on the campus for \n16  educational programming as well as other services.  Residents are expected to share \n17  common equipment such as telephones, televisions, tables, recreational games and other \n18  living accommodations. \n19   \n20  Youth Interactions with Staff \n21  8.  MercyFirst has a 6:1 ratio of supervision for children in shelter.  Many youth in the \n22  RTC setting are required to receive one-on-one supervision from staff, in addition to the \n23  general daily supervision provided.  Staff work different shifts and youth are exposed to \n24  different staff throughout the day.   \n25  9.  Youth also meet individually with case managers and mental health clinicians on a \n26  weekly basis. \n27 \n28 \n \nDeclaration of Anthony Enriquez \n2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-8   Filed 03/25/20   Page 4 of 8   Page ID\n #:5118\n \n1  10.  Often, staff interact with youth in the RTC in a physical manner, including using \n2  physical restraints. When these incidents occur, minors are at times taken to the hospital \n3  for further evaluation, medication, or hospitalization.  \n4  11.  Due to space constraints and group programmatic needs, it would be very difficult \n5  or almost impossible for children to maintain six feet of social distancing between \n6  themselves and everyone else in the facility. \n7   \n8  Sleeping Arrangements \n9  12.  Youth at MercyFirst are held in a communal setting in close quarters with other \n10  children.  Based on observation of and conversations with clients, youth sleep in \n11  individual rooms with one bed or two beds with approximately two or three feet between \n12  the beds.   \n13   \n14  Dining Facilities \n15  13.  Youth at MercyFirst typically eat meals in a communal setting.  Meals are served \n16  three times a day in a single location which serves all the kids in a unit at the same time.  \n17  Various staff are also present during meals. \n18   \n19  Access to Medical Care \n20  14.  There is a nurse and a psychiatrist on campus and children have access to medical \n21  care. For more specialized medical care, children must be transported outside of \n22  MercyFirst. If access to local hospitals is limited due to the coronavirus, minors at \n23  MercyFirst may be at serious risk of being denied access to essential medical care. \n24   \n25  Rising Ground \n26  Background \n27  15.  Rising Ground (RG) detains unaccompanied migrant youth between the ages of 13 \n28  and 17.  It is my understanding that this facility is licensed to provide shelter care for up \n \nDeclaration of Anthony Enriquez \n3 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-8   Filed 03/25/20   Page 5 of 8   Page ID\n #:5119\n \n1  to 65 youth in the regular shelter setting.  The current population of this facility is \n2  approximately 22 young people.   \n3  16.  Rising Ground currently houses unaccompanied children in four different cottages \n4  located on the same campus. Each unit currently holds up to 8 young people who are \n5  regularly transported to other locations within the same campus for educational \n6  programming as well as other services.  Residents are expected to share common \n7  equipment such as telephones, televisions, tables, recreational games and other living \n8  accommodations. \n9   \n10  Youth Interactions with Staff \n11  17.  There are staff and personnel who provide 24-hour care and supervision with a 6:1 \n12  ratio of supervision.  Staff work different shifts and youth are exposed to different staff \n13  throughout the day. \n14  18.  Youth also meet individually with case managers and mental health clinicians on a \n15  weekly basis. \n16  19.  Due to space constraints and group programmatic needs, it would be very difficult \n17  or almost impossible for children to maintain six feet of social distancing between \n18  themselves and everyone else in the facility. \n19   \n20  Sleeping Arrangements \n21  20.  Youth at RG are held in a communal setting in close quarters with other children.  \n22  Based on my observation, youth sleep in rooms with two beds with approximately two or \n23  three feet between the beds.   \n24   \n25  Dining Facilities \n26  21.  Youth at RG also eat meals in a communal setting.  Meals are served three times a \n27  day in a single location which serves meals to all the residents in the cottage at the same \n28  time.  Various staff are also present during meals. \n \nDeclaration of Anthony Enriquez \n4 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-8   Filed 03/25/20   Page 6 of 8   Page ID\n #:5120\n \n1  Access to Medical Care \n2  22.  To my knowledge, there is a nurse practitioner on campus. Youths at RG have \n3  access to regular medical care.  For more specialized medical care, children must be \n4  transported outside of RG’s campus. If access to local hospitals in the surrounding area is \n5  limited due to the pandemic, minors in shelter at RG may be at serious risk of being \n6  denied access to essential medical care. \n7   \n8  Catholic Guardian Services \n9  Background \n10  23.  Catholic Guardian Services (CGS) detains unaccompanied migrant youth between \n11  the ages of 13 and 17.  It is my understanding that this facility is licensed to provide \n12  shelter care for up to 56 youth in the regular shelter setting.  The current population of \n13  this facility is approximately 23 young people.   \n14  24.  CGS houses unaccompanied children in three different buildings. The largest of \n15  these can accommodate up to 24 young people.  Residents are expected to share common \n16  equipment such as telephones, televisions, tables, recreational games and other living \n17  accommodations. \n18   \n19  Youth Interactions with Staff \n20  25.  There are staff and personnel who provide 24-hour care and supervision with a 6:1 \n21  ratio of supervision.  Staff work different shifts and youth are exposed to different staff \n22  throughout the day. \n23  26.  Youth also meet individually with case managers and mental health clinicians on a \n24  weekly basis. \n25  27.  Due to space constraints and group programmatic needs, it may be very difficult or \n26  almost impossible for children to maintain six feet of social distancing between \n27  themselves and everyone else in the facility. \n28   \n \nDeclaration of Anthony Enriquez \n5 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-8   Filed 03/25/20   Page 7 of 8   Page ID\n #:5121\n \n1  Sleeping Arrangements \n2  28.  Youth at CGS are held in a communal setting in close quarters with other children. \n3  Youth sleep in rooms with two or three beds with approximately two or three feet \n4  between the beds.   \n5   \n6  Dining Facilities \n7  29.  Youth at CGS also eat meals in a communal setting.  Meals are served three times \n8  a day in a single location. All the residents in the cottage eat at the same time.  Various \n9  staff members are also present during meals. \n10   \n11  Access to Medical Care \n12  30.  To my knowledge young people at CGS have access to regular medical care.  For \n13  more specialized medical care, children must be transported outside of CGS’s campus. If \n14  access to local hospitals in the surrounding area is limited due to the pandemic, minors in \n15  shelter at CGS may be at serious risk of being denied access to essential medical care. \n16   \n17  General Risks of Congregate Care \n18  31.  It is my understanding that some facilities are making specific efforts to implement \n19  practices designed to mitigate the public health risks associated with COVID-19.   \n20  32.  Even so, I remain concerned that children in congregate care are at heightened risk \n21  of being infected by or exposing others to the novel coronavirus.  This includes exposure \n22  introduced by shelter staff who must remain in close contact with detained youth and who \n23  themselves are exposed to the virus in daily travels to and from the shelters throughout \n24  the New York City area. Such exposure places children, staff, and the general public at \n25  risk of contracting the virus.   \n26  33.

One study \ndemonstrated that “refugees resettled in western countries could be [up to] ten times more likely \nto have post-traumatic stress disorder than [the] age-matched general populations  in those \ncountries1.” Immigration  detention adds significant  psychological  stress to the resettlement \nprocess, further exacerbating the incidence and severity of mental health disorders. Growing \nevidence demonstrates that PTSD, anxiety/stress, and depression can lead to decreased immune \nresponse and increased risk of infections. Thus, the men, women, and children in immigration \ndetention, due to higher rates of the aforementioned mental health disorders, have increased \nvulnerability  to infections, including  COVID-19. \nImmigration Detention and Mental Health: \nFor migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers, immigration  detention in a host country is a \nsignificant  post-migration  stressor that includes a loss of liberty and the ever-present threat of \nforced return to their country of origin3.  The detention experience increases the likelihood  that \ndetainees exacerbate existing or develop new mental health disorders such as PTSD, anxiety, and \ndepression4.   \n                                                             \n1 Fazel M, Wheeler J, Danesh J.

All six studies \ndemonstrated higher symptoms scores and rates for these mental health disorders in the detained \ngroups4. The higher rates and severity of symptoms also occurred in detained asylum seekers \ncompared to non-detained asylum seekers5. Four of the studies reported on the relationship \nbetween length of detention and mental health: they found a positive correlation between \ndetention duration and development of mental health symptoms4.  \nChildren in particular are vulnerable to the mental health consequences of detention. One study \nexamined the mental health of four-hundred and twenty-five (425) children 4 to 17 years of age \nwho were held at a US detention center for over two months in mid-20186.  Scoring on a \nstandardized questionnaire demonstrated that 32% of children had elevated scores for emotional \nproblems, with 49% of children suffering emotional  problems when separated from their \nmothers6. One hundred and fifty (150) of these children also completed a PTSD assessment, with \n17% scoring in the range consistent with a PTSD diagnosis6. The Australian Human Rights \nCommission,  investigating  Australia’s immigrant  detention centers, found that 34% of children \nin detention had diagnosable  mental health disorders, and 85% of responders said the detention \nhad an adverse effect on the children’s mental health7.     \nMental Health, Immunity, and Infection Risk: \nPeople with a weakened immune system have an increased risk of developing  more severe forms \nof COVID-19, including  complications  like pneumonia,  because their immune response is not \nstrong enough to fight diseases like COVID-198.  In addition  to illnesses such as HIV and \nmedication such as corticosteroids that suppress the body’s immune response, studies have \nexplored how stress changes the immune system. Anxiety, depression, and PTSD, which are \ninterconnected with stress, have also been demonstrated to impact the immune system.  \n                                                             \n5 Cleveland J, Rousseau C.

The sympathetic nervous system (the \ncomponent of the nervous system that governs stress responses) sends neurons from the brain to \nprimary immune cell sites (bone marrow and thymus) as well as secondary sites (spleen and \nlymph tissues)9,10. These sympathetic neurons can influence immune responses by releasing \nneurochemicals that bind to receptors on immune cells (white blood cells) in the primary and \nsecondary immune tissues9,10. There are connections between various parts of our endocrine \nsystem and stress that leads to increased stimulation  of the sympathetic nervous system as well \nas the stress hormone, cortisol,  which has both short and long term effects on immune \ndysfunction9,10.  \nAcute stress causes release of proteins called cytokines that increase inflammation  which in the \nshort term is useful to fight infections. Chronic stress, lasting days to years, leads to persistent, \nhigher levels of these pro-inflammatory  cytokines and systemic inflammation.  Chronic systemic \ninflammation  causes immune dysregulation  and increases risk for chronic diseases as well as \nincreases risk for infection9,10. Furthermore, chronic stress can lead to suppression of specific \ncytokines that activate cellular immunity,  a type of immune response that provides defense \nagainst infections10. \nAnxiety, depression, and PTSD are all mental health disorders linked with elevated stress levels, \nand as such studies have found that these disorders are also linked to changes in immune \nfunction. Depression, anxiety, and PTSD have all been found to directly stimulate production  of \npro-inflammatory  cytokines, as well as downregulate cellular immunity  leading to increased risk \nof acute and prolonged  infection, and delayed wound healing11,12. The pro-inflammatory  states \nfound in these mental health disorders leads to a complex feedback in which inflammation \nchanges brain circuits and neurochemical expression,  perpetuating a cycle of immune \ndysfunction  and mental health symptoms13,14\n. \n                                                             \n9 Morey JN, Boggero IA, Scott AB, Segerstrom SC.

These disorders, as well as adverse social and physical environments,  can lead to \nchanges in gene expression that have lasting impact on chronic disease development and \npersistent immune dysfunction15,16,17. These changes in gene expression are particularly \ndetrimental in childhood  because they can alter the development of the brain, body, and immune \nsystem15,16,17.  \nNew studies looking  at the relationship  between COVID-19 and inflammation  have found that \nthere is an induction  of pro-inflammatory  cytokines leading to lung inflammation  and damage \nduring COVID-19 infection18. Another study also demonstrated that COVID-19 patients in \nWuhan had elevated levels of inflammatory  cytokines and a decrease in the number of a type of \nimmune cell that fights viruses (T cells)19. More severe cases had greater suppression of their T \ncells19. There is some evidence that certain types of psychological  trauma – potentially  linked \nwith the expression of the stress chemical norepinephrine  – can lead to both decreased \nexpression of these T cells and decreased expression of chemicals that encourage T cell \nproliferation20. \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n14 Irwin MR, Miller AH.

There is increasing evidence that immigration  detention independently \ncontributes to psychological  trauma and leads to higher rates of depression, anxiety, and PTSD. \nThere is also significant  evidence of the links between these disorders and changes in immune \nfunction on a variety of levels, from expression of pro-inflammatory  cytokines to expression and \nsuppression of certain types of immune cells that can combat infection. And there is new \nevidence that this new disease, COVID-19, may have specific immune dysregulation  and \nexpression of pro-inflammatory  cytokines that worsens disease severity. Given these multiple \nlines of evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that the men, women, and children in US detention \nfacilities are at an elevated risk of weakened immunity  due to their higher rates of psychological \nstress and mental health disorders. Thus, they are at increased risk of contracting and suffering \nfrom more severe forms of COVID-19, which is detrimental to them as individuals  but also to \nthe public health efforts to combat the disease. \n \n \n \nI swear under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

This guidance is based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \nrecommendations and is adapted for the UAC Program. The pandemic is a rapidly evolving situation, and \nupdated guidance may be released in the future, as necessary.  \n \nGuidance on COVID-19 documentation in the UAC Portal was sent to ORR care providers via a DHUC \nDispatch on March 13th, 2020.  \n \nPlease carefully review the information below, and email DCSMedical@acf.hhs.gov with any questions.  \n \nCOVID-19 BACKGROUND \n \nCDC Situation Summary \nSee: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/summary.html \n \nAn outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel (new) coronavirus was first detected in Wuhan City, \nHubei Province, China and has now been detected in more than 100 locations internationally, including \nthe United States. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a public \nhealth emergency of international concern, and on March 11, 2020, characterized COVID-19 as a \npandemic.  \n \nTransmission of COVID-19 \n  Much is unknown about how the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19 spreads. Current \nknowledge is largely based on what is known about similar coronaviruses. \n  Most often, person-to-person spread is thought to happen among people in close contact \n(about 6 feet) with each other and mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an \ninfected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens \nspread. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be \ninhaled into the lungs. \n  It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the \nvirus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not \nbelieved to be the main way the virus spreads. \n  Typically, with most respiratory viruses, people are considered most contagious when they are \nmost symptomatic (sickest). \n \nSymptoms of COVID-19 \nReported illnesses have ranged from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2–14 days \nafter exposure and can include: \n  Fever \n  Cough \n  Shortness of breath \n \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-13   Filed 03/25/20   Page 3 of 13   Page ID\n #:5207\nCOVID-19 INTERIM GUIDANCE FOR ORR PROGRAMS \nUPDATED MARCH 13, 2020 \n \nDiagnosis and treatment \n  There is currently no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19. People with COVID-19 should \nreceive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. \n  Testing is with a real time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) test to \ndetect SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) in respiratory samples.  \n  Currently, testing is being rolled out to public health and clinical laboratories throughout the \nUnited States. \nPrevention \n  There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid \nbeing exposed to the virus. \n  Everyday actions can help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including: \no  Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. \no  Avoid close contact with people who are sick. \no  Stay home when you are sick. \no  Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. \no  Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household \ncleaning spray or wipe. \no  Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after \nblowing your nose, coughing or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or \npreparing food. \no  If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at \nleast 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty. \n \nPlease refer to the CDC website for up-to-date information on COVID-19, including what is currently \nknown about transmission, symptoms, and prevention efforts.  \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/index.html \n \nORR GUIDANCE AND RESPONSE \n \nORR’s Division of Health for Unaccompanied Children (DHUC) Response \n  DHUC is closely monitoring COVID-19 information and CDC-issued guidance.  \n  DHUC is providing guidance to ORR care providers when staff or children might have been \nexposed to COVID-19 in their community or during travel. \n  DHUC, in collaboration with the Department of Homeland Security/Customs and Border \nProtection (DHS/CBP) and the ORR Intakes Team, are monitoring when an unaccompanied alien \nchild is initially referred to ORR care who is reported to be potentially exposed to COVID-19 \neither through travel from/through an area with widespread or ongoing community spread \nwithin the past 14 days or contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient. Subsequently, DHUC will \nnotify and provide guidance to ORR care providers of those children referred for care and \ncustody. \n  Care providers have been directed to notify state and local health departments when a UAC has \nbeen identified as potentially exposed to COVID-19 either through travel from/through an area \nwith widespread or ongoing community spread within the past 14 days or through contact with \na confirmed COVID-19 patient.    \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-13   Filed 03/25/20   Page 4 of 13   Page ID\n #:5208\nCOVID-19 INTERIM GUIDANCE FOR ORR PROGRAMS \nUPDATED MARCH 13, 2020 \n \nGeneral communicable disease prevention and control measures already in place across ORR \ncare provider programs that will aid in COVID-19 response \n  All ORR care providers document a child’s travel history in the Initial Intakes Assessment and the \nUAC Assessment sections of the UAC Portal. \n  The health of all UAC in care is routinely assessed by a licensed medical provider during the Initial \nMedical Exam (IME). \n  All ORR care providers must have the ability to medically isolate or quarantine a child in a room \nto prevent contact with other children. Ideally, this room is linked to a private bathroom. \n  All ORR care providers must educate staff and children on hand-hygiene, respiratory etiquette, \nand steps to prevent illness. \n  All ORR care providers must routinely have children with respiratory disease (e.g., influenza) wear \na plain paper surgical mask when not in an isolation room, such as when visiting a healthcare \nfacility. \n  All ORR care providers must clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.  \n  All ORR care providers have a designated way to report potentially reportable diseases to their \nstate or local health department. This same reporting structure is used for COVID-19.  \n \nCOVID-19 Specific Guidance to ORR Care Providers \n1. Planning and coordination \n  Contact your local clinic/hospital to confirm the procedure for evaluation and treatment of \nchildren with symptoms of acute respiratory illness. \n  Contact your state or local health department to confirm procedures for reporting and \nmanaging children with suspected COVID-19.  \n \n2. Enhanced staff and visitor screening \n  Ensure sick employees with symptoms of an acute respiratory illness (fever, cough, shortness of \nbreath) stay home and consult with their primary care provider and state or local health \ndepartment about further evaluation and testing.  \n  Screen all staff and visitors of the care provider (including stakeholders) for COVID-19 risk \nfactors prior to ORR program entry, using the “ORR COVID-19 Risk Questionnaire for Staff and \nVisitors” tool available on the UAC Portal home page under the “COVID-19 Guidance and \nMaterials” folder in the “Documents to Download” section. \n \n3. Identification of risk among children in ORR care \n  Review jurisdiction-specific COVID-19 guidance from your state or local health department. \n  Determine the risk of COVID-19 for each child by identifying if s/he may have been exposed \nthrough 1) an ORR care provider staff member, 2) a person in the community, or 3) travel \nfrom/through an area with widespread or ongoing community spread within the past 14 days, \nas noted below: \n  China \n  Iran \n  South Korea \n  Most of Europe \n  A current list can be found at this link: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-\nncov/travelers/index.html  \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-13   Filed 03/25/20   Page 5 of 13   Page ID\n #:5209\nCOVID-19 INTERIM GUIDANCE FOR ORR PROGRAMS \nUPDATED MARCH 13, 2020 \n  Document the child’s location of origin and travel history in the UAC Portal:  \no  Initial Intakes Assessment: 1) Date of departure from home country; 2) Date of arrival in \nthe U.S.  \no  UAC Assessment: 1) Additional UAC Info Tab - City of Origin, Neighborhood of Origin (be \nas specific as the child can provide); 2) Journey and Apprehension Tab- When did you \nleave your home country (month, day, year)? How long did the trip take? How did you \nget to the U.S.? Who did you travel with? \n \n4. Responding to children with a risk for COVID-19 exposure or symptomatic disease \n  If a child is found to be at risk for COVID-19 exposure and does NOT have symptoms of acute \nrespiratory illness (e.g., fever, cough, shortness of breath): \no  Place the child in a private room with a closed door and access to a bathroom (preferably \na private bathroom not used by other staff or children). \no  Immediately notify the state or local health department and DHUC at \nDCSMedical@acf.hhs.gov for additional guidance on risk assessment, symptom \nmonitoring, and quarantine. \no  Maintain quarantine until the child is cleared by the health department and DHUC. \no  Do NOT transfer or discharge the child until cleared by the health department and DHUC. \no  Provide the child notice of the quarantine requirement and address questions or \nconcerns the child may have about medical quarantine, as well as potential delays to \nanticipated transfers or discharge plans.  \no  Ensure services (e.g., legal, educational) are provided to the child. \n \n  If a child is found to be at risk for COVID-19 and HAS symptoms of acute respiratory illness (e.g., \nfever, cough, shortness of breath): \no  Isolate the child in a negative pressure isolation room. If a negative pressure room is not \navailable, place the child in a private room with a closed door and access to a bathroom \n(preferably a private bathroom not used by other staff or children). \no  Immediately notify the state or local health department and DHUC at \nDCSMedical@acf.hhs.gov for additional guidance on risk assessment, symptom \nmonitoring, and quarantine. \no  Ensure personnel entering the room use standard precautions, contact precautions, \nairborne precautions (e.g., N95 respirator), and eye protection (e.g., goggles or a face \nshield). \no  Provide a plain paper surgical mask to the child for use when s/he leaves the isolation \nroom (e.g., to go to the bathroom or a medical appointment). \no  If the child must be transported to a health clinic or facility, notify the local health \ndepartment for guidance. Additionally, call ahead to notify the medical facility so they \ncan be ready with the necessary infection control measures.  \no  Seek immediate medical attention if a child has severe or worsening symptoms.  \no  Maintain isolation until cleared by the health department and DHUC. \no  DO NOT transfer or discharge the child until cleared by the health department and DHUC. \no  Provide the child with notice of the isolation requirement and address questions or \nconcerns the child may have about medical isolation, as well as potential delays to \nanticipated transfers or discharge plans.  \no  Ensure services (e.g., legal, educational) are provided to the child, if possible. \n \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-13   Filed 03/25/20   Page 6 of 13   Page ID\n #:5210\nCOVID-19 INTERIM GUIDANCE FOR ORR PROGRAMS \nUPDATED MARCH 13, 2020 \n5.

Recommendations may need to be revised as more \ninformation becomes available.\nWho is the intended audience for this guidance?\nThis document is intended to provide guiding principles for healthcare and non-healthcare administrators of correctional \nand detention facilities (including but not limited to federal and state prisons, local jails, and detention centers), law \nenforcement agencies that have custodial authority for detained populations (i.e., US Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement and US Marshals Service), and their respective health departments, to assist in preparing for potential \nintroduction, spread, and mitigation of COVID-19 in their facilities. In general, the document uses terminology referring to \ncorrectional environments but can also be applied to civil and pre-trial detention settings.\nThis guidance will not necessarily address every possible custodial setting and may not use legal terminology specific to \nindividual agencies’ authorities or processes. The guidance may need to be adapted based on individual facilities’\nphysical space, staffing, population, operations, and other resources and conditions.Facilities should contact CDC or \ntheir state, local, territorial, and/or tribal public health department if they need assistance in applying these principles or \naddressing topics that are not specifically covered in this guidance.\nWhy is this guidance being issued?\nCorrectional and detention facilities can include custody, housing, education, recreation, healthcare, food service, and \nworkplace components in a single physical setting. The integration of these components presents unique challenges for \ncontrol of COVID-19 transmission among incarcerated/detained persons, staff, and visitors. Consistent application of \nspecific preparation, prevention, and management measures can help reduce the risk of transmission and severe disease \nfrom COVID-19.\n• Incarcerated/detained persons live, work, eat, study, and recreate within congregate environments, heightening the \npotential for COVID-19 to spread once introduced.\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correction... 3/24/2020\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-14   Filed 03/25/20   Page 3 of 25   Page ID\n #:5220\nGuidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detenti...Page 2 of 24\n• In most cases, incarcerated/detained persons are not permitted to leave the facility.\n• There are many opportunities for COVID-19 to be introduced into a correctional or detention facility, including daily \nstaff ingress and egress; transfer of incarcerated/detained persons between facilities and systems, to court \nappearances, and to outside medical visits; and visits from family, legal representatives, and other community \nmembers. Some settings, particularly jails and detention centers, have high turnover, admitting new entrants daily \nwho may have been exposed to COVID-19 in the surrounding community or other regions.\n• Persons incarcerated/detained in a particular facility often come from a variety of locations, increasing the potential \nto introduce COVID-19 from different geographic areas.\n• Options for medical isolation of COVID-19 cases are limited and vary depending on the type and size of facility, as well \nas the current level of available capacity, which is partly based on medical isolation needs for other conditions.\n• Adequate levels of custody and healthcare staffing must be maintained to ensure safe operation of the facility, and \noptions to practice social distancing through work alternatives such as working from home or reduced/alternate \nschedules are limited for many staff roles.\n• Correctional and detention facilities can be complex, multi-employer settings that include government and private \nemployers. Each is organizationally distinct and responsible for its own operational, personnel, and occupational \nhealth protocols and may be prohibited from issuing guidance or providing services to other employers or their staff \nwithin the same setting. Similarly, correctional and detention facilities may house individuals from multiple law \nenforcement agencies or jurisdictions subject to different policies and procedures.\n• Incarcerated/detained persons and staff may have medical conditions that increase their risk of severe disease from \nCOVID-19.\n• Because limited outside information is available to many incarcerated/detained persons, unease and misinformation \nregarding the potential for COVID-19 spread may be high, potentially creating security and morale challenges.\n• The ability of incarcerated/detained persons to exercise disease prevention measures (e.g., frequent handwashing) \nmay be limited and is determined by the supplies provided in the facility and by security considerations. Many \nfacilities restrict access to soap and paper towels and prohibit alcohol-based hand sanitizer and many disinfectants.\n• Incarcerated persons may hesitate to report symptoms of COVID-19 or seek medical care due to co-pay requirements \nand fear of isolation.\nCDC has issued separate COVID-19 guidance addressing healthcare infection controland clinical care of COVID-19 cases as \nwell as close contacts of cases in community-based settings. Where relevant, community-focused guidance documents are \nreferenced in this document and should be monitored regularly for updates, but they may require adaptation for \ncorrectional and detention settings.\nThis guidance document provides additional recommended best practices specifically for correctional and detention \nfacilities. At this time, different facility types (e.g., prison vs. jail) and sizes are not differentiated. Administrators and \nagencies should adapt these guiding principles to the specific needs of their facility.\nWhat topics does this guidance include?\nThe guidance below includes detailed recommendations on the following topics related to COVID-19 in correctional and \ndetention settings:\n• Operational and communications preparations for COVID-19\n• Enhanced cleaning/disinfecting and hygiene practices\n• Social distancing strategies to increase space between individuals in the facility\n• How to limit transmission from visitors\n• Infection control, including recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) and potential alternatives during PPE \nshortages\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correction... 3/24/2020\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-14   Filed 03/25/20   Page 4 of 25   Page ID\n #:5221\nGuidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detenti...Page 3 of 24\n• Verbal screening and temperature check protocols for incoming incarcerated/detained individuals, staff, and visitors\n• Medical isolation of confirmed and suspected cases and quarantine of contacts, including considerations for \ncohorting when individual spaces are limited\n• Healthcare evaluation for suspected cases, including testing for COVID-19\n• Clinical care for confirmed and suspected cases\n• Considerations for persons at higher risk of severe disease from COVID-19\nDefinitions of Commonly Used Terms\nClose contact of a COVID-19 case–In the context of COVID-19, an individual is considered a close contact if they a) have \nbeen within approximately 6 feet of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time or b) have had direct contact with \ninfectious secretions from a COVID-19 case (e.g., have been coughed on). Close contact can occur while caring for, living \nwith, visiting, or sharing a common space with a COVID-19 case. Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited. \nConsiderations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases \nexposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk, as \ndoes exposure to a severely ill patient).\nCohorting–Cohorting refers to the practice of isolating multiple laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases together as a \ngroup, or quarantining close contacts of a particular case together as a group. Ideally, cases should be isolated individually, \nand close contacts should be quarantined individually. However, some correctional facilities and detention centers do not \nhave enough individual cells to do so and must consider cohorting as an alternative. See Quarantineand Medical Isolation\nsections below for specific details about ways to implement cohorting to minimize the risk of disease spread and adverse \nhealth outcomes.\nCommunity transmission of COVID-19 –Community transmission of COVID-19 occurs when individuals acquire the \ndisease through contact with someone in their local community, rather than through travel to an affected location. Once \ncommunity transmission is identified in a particular area, correctional facilities and detention centers are more likely to \nstart seeing cases inside their walls. Facilities should consult with local public health departments if assistance is needed in \ndetermining how to define “local community” in the context of COVID-19 spread. However, because all states have \nreported cases, all facilities should be vigilant for introduction into their populations.\nConfirmed vs. Suspected COVID-19 case–A confirmed casehas received a positive result from a COVID-19 laboratory \ntest, with or without symptoms. A suspected caseshows symptoms of COVID-19 but either has not been tested or is \nawaiting test results. If test results are positive, a suspected case becomes a confirmed case.\nIncarcerated/detained persons–For the purpose of this document, “incarcerated/detained persons”refers to persons \nheld in a prison, jail, detention center, or other custodial setting where these guidelines are generally applicable. The term \nincludes those who have been sentenced (i.e., in prisons) as well as those held for pre-trial (i.e., jails) or civil purposes (i.e, \ndetention centers). Although this guidance does not specifically reference individuals in every type of custodial setting \n(e.g., juvenile facilities, community confinement facilities), facility administrators can adapt this guidance to apply to their \nspecific circumstances as needed.\nMedical Isolation–Medical isolation refers to confining a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case (ideally to a single cell \nwith solid walls and a solid door that closes), to prevent contact with others and to reduce the risk of transmission. Medical \nisolation ends when the individual meets pre-established clinical and/or testing criteria for release from isolation, in \nconsultation with clinical providers and public health officials (detailed in guidance below). In this context, isolation does \nNOT refer to punitive isolation for behavioral infractions within the custodial setting. Staff are encouraged to use the term \n“medical isolation” to avoid confusion.\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correction... 3/24/2020\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-14   Filed 03/25/20   Page 5 of 25   Page ID\n #:5222\nGuidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detenti...Page 4 of 24\nQuarantine–Quarantine refers to the practice of confining individuals who have had close contact with a COVID-19 case \nto determine whether they develop symptoms of the disease. Quarantine for COVID-19 should last for a period of 14 days. \nIdeally, each quarantined individual would be quarantined in a single cell with solid walls and a solid door that closes. If \nsymptoms develop during the 14-day period, the individual should be placed under medical isolationand evaluated for \nCOVID-19. If symptoms do not develop, movement restrictions can be lifted, and the individual can return to their previous \nresidency status within the facility.\nSocial Distancing–Social distancing is the practice of increasing the space between individuals and decreasing the \nfrequency of contact to reduce the risk of spreading a disease (ideally to maintain at least 6 feet between all individuals, \neven those who are asymptomatic). Social distancing strategies can be applied on an individual level (e.g., avoiding \nphysical contact), a group level (e.g., canceling group activities where individuals will be in close contact), and an \noperational level (e.g., rearranging chairs in the dining hall to increase distance between them). Although social distancing \nis challenging to practice in correctional and detention environments, it is a cornerstone of reducing transmission of \nrespiratory diseases such as COVID-19. Additional information about social distancing, including information on its use to \nreduce the spread of other viral illnesses, is available in this CDC publication(cid:240).\nStaff –In this document, “staff”refers to all public sector employees as well as those working for a private contractor \nwithin a correctional facility (e.g., private healthcare or food service). Except where noted, “staff” does not distinguish \nbetween healthcare, custody, and other types of staff including private facility operators.\nSymptoms–Symptoms of COVID-19include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Like other respiratory infections, \nCOVID-19 can vary in severity from mild to severe. When severe, pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death are possible. \nCOVID-19 is a novel disease, therefore the full range of signs and symptoms, the clinical course of the disease, and the \nindividuals and populations most at risk for disease and complications are not yet fully understood. Monitor theCDC \nwebsitefor updates on these topics.\nFacilities with Limited Onsite Healthcare Services\nAlthough many large facilities such as prisons and some jails usually employ onsite healthcare staff and have the capacity \nto evaluate incarcerated/detained persons for potential illness within a dedicated healthcare space, many smaller facilities \ndo not. Some of these facilities have access to on-call healthcare staff or providers who visit the facility every few days. \nOthers have neither onsite healthcare capacity nor onsite medical isolation/quarantine space and must transfer ill patients \nto other correctional or detention facilities or local hospitals for evaluation and care.\nThe majority of the guidance below is designed to be applied to any correctional or detention facility, either as written or \nwith modifications based on a facility’s individual structure and resources. However, topics related to healthcare \nevaluation and clinical care of confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases and their close contacts may not apply directly to \nfacilities with limited or no onsite healthcare services. It will be especially important for these types of facilities to \ncoordinate closely with their state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health department when they encounter confirmed or \nsuspected cases among incarcerated/detained persons or staff, in order to ensure effective medical isolation and \nquarantine, necessary medical evaluation and care, and medical transfer if needed. The guidance makes note of strategies \ntailored to facilities without onsite healthcare where possible.\nNote that all staff in any sized facility, regardless of the presence of onsite healthcare services, should observe guidance on \nrecommended PPEin order to ensure their own safety when interacting with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases. \nFacilities should make contingency plans for the likely event of PPE shortagesduring the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCOVID-19 Guidance for Correctional Facilities\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correction... 3/24/2020\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-14   Filed 03/25/20   Page 6 of 25   Page ID\n #:5223\nGuidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detenti...Page 5 of 24\nGuidance for correctional and detention facilities is organized into 3 sections: Operational Preparedness, Prevention, and \nManagement of COVID-19. Recommendations across these sections can be applied simultaneously based on the progress \nof the outbreak in a particular facility and the surrounding community.\n• Operational Preparedness.This guidance is intended to help facilities prepare for potential COVID-19 transmission \nin the facility. Strategies focus on operational and communications planning and personnel practices.\n• Prevention.  This guidance is intended to help facilities prevent spread of COVID-19 from outside the facility to inside. \nStrategies focus on reinforcing hygiene practices, intensifying cleaning and disinfection of the facility, screening (new \nintakes, visitors, and staff), continued communication with incarcerated/detained persons and staff, and social \ndistancing measures (increasing distance between individuals).\n• Management.This guidance is intended to help facilities clinically manage confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases \ninside the facility and prevent further transmission. Strategies include medical isolation and care of \nincarcerated/detained persons with symptoms (including considerations for cohorting), quarantine of cases’ close \ncontacts, restricting movement in and out of the facility, infection control practices for individuals interacting with \ncases and quarantined contacts or contaminated items, intensified social distancing, and cleaning and disinfecting \nareas visited by cases.\nOperational Preparedness\nAdministrators can plan and prepare for COVID-19 by ensuring that all persons in the facility know the symptoms of \nCOVID-19 and how to respond if they develop symptoms. Other essential actions include developing contingency plans for \nreduced workforces due to absences, coordinating with public health and correctional partners, and communicating \nclearly with staff and incarcerated/detained persons about these preparations and how they may temporarily alter daily \nlife.\nCommunication & Coordination\n• Develop information-sharing systems with partners.\n◦ Identify points of contact in relevant state, local, tribal, and/or territorial public health departments before cases \ndevelop. Actively engage with the health department to understand in advance which entity has jurisdiction to \nimplement public health control measures for COVID-19 in a particular correctional or detention facility.\n◦ Create and test communications plans to disseminate critical information to incarcerated/detained persons, \nstaff, contractors, vendors, and visitors as the pandemic progresses.\n◦ Communicate with other correctional facilities in the same geographic area to share information including \ndisease surveillance and absenteeism patterns among staff.\n◦ Where possible, put plans in place with other jurisdictions to prevent confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases \nand their close contacts from being transferred between jurisdictions and facilities unless necessary for medical \nevaluation, medical isolation/quarantine, clinical care, extenuating security concerns, or to prevent \novercrowding.\n◦ Stay informed about updates to CDC guidance via the CDC COVID-19 website as more information becomes \nknown.\n• Review existing pandemic flu, all-hazards, and disaster plans, and revise for COVID-19. \n◦ Ensure that physical locations (dedicated housing areas and bathrooms) have been identified to isolate \nconfirmed COVID-19 cases and individuals displaying COVID-19 symptoms, and to quarantine known close \ncontacts of cases. (Medical isolation and quarantine locations should be separate). The plan should include \ncontingencies for multiple locations if numerous cases and/or contacts are identified and require medical \nisolation or quarantine simultaneously. SeeMedical Isolationand Quarantinesections below for details \nregarding individual medical isolation and quarantine locations (preferred) vs. cohorting.\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correction... 3/24/2020\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-14   Filed 03/25/20   Page 7 of 25   Page ID\n #:5224\nGuidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detenti...Page 6 of 24\n◦ Facilities without onsite healthcare capacityshould make a plan for how they will ensure that suspected COVID-\n19 cases will be isolated, evaluated, tested (if indicated), and provided necessary medical care.\n◦ Make a list of possible social distancing strategiesthat could be implemented as needed at different stages of \ntransmission intensity.\n◦ Designate officials who will be authorized to make decisions about escalating or de-escalating response efforts \nas the epidemiologic context changes.\n• Coordinate with local law enforcement and court officials.\n◦ Identify lawful alternatives to in-person court appearances, such as virtual court, as a social distancing measure \nto reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.\n◦ Explore strategies to prevent over-crowding of correctional and detention facilities during a community \noutbreak.\n• Postsignagethroughout the facility communicating the following:\n◦ For all:symptoms of COVID-19 and hand hygiene instructions\n◦ For incarcerated/detained persons: report symptoms to staff\n◦ For staff: stay at home when sick; if symptoms develop while on duty, leave the facility as soon as possible and \nfollow CDC-recommended steps for persons who are ill with COVID-19 symptomsincluding self-isolating at \nhome, contacting their healthcare provider as soon as possible to determine whether they need to be evaluated \nand tested, and contacting their supervisor.\n◦ Ensure that signage is understandable for non-English speaking persons and those with low literacy, and make \nnecessary accommodations for those with cognitive or intellectual disabilities and those who are deaf, blind, or \nlow-vision.\nPersonnel Practices\n• Review the sick leave policies of each employer that operates in the facility.\n◦ Review policies to ensure that they actively encourage staff to stay home when sick.\n◦ If these policies do not encourage staff to stay home when sick, discuss with the contract company.\n◦ Determine which officials will have the authority to send symptomatic staff home.\n• Identify staff whose duties would allow them to work from home. Where possible, allowing staff to work from \nhome can be an effective social distancing strategy to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. \n◦ Discuss work from home options with these staff and determine whether they have the supplies and \ntechnological equipment required to do so.\n◦ Put systems in place to implement work from home programs (e.g., time tracking, etc.).\n• Plan for staff absences.Staff should stay home when they are sick, or they may need to stay home to care for a sick \nhousehold member or care for children in the event of school and childcare dismissals. \n◦ Allow staff to work from home when possible, within the scope of their duties.\n◦ Identify critical job functions and plan for alternative coverage by cross-training staff where possible.\n◦ Determine minimum levels of staff in all categories required for the facility to function safely. If possible, develop \na plan to secure additional staff if absenteeism due to COVID-19 threatens to bring staffing to minimum levels.\n◦ Consider increasing keep on person (KOP) medication orders to cover 30 days in case of healthcare staff \nshortages.\n• Consider offering revised duties to staff who are at higher risk of severe illness with COVID-19.Persons at higher \nrisk may include older adults and persons of any age with serious underlying medical conditions including lung \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correction... 3/24/2020\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-14   Filed 03/25/20   Page 8 of 25   Page ID\n #:5225\nGuidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detenti...Page 7 of 24\ndisease, heart disease, and diabetes. See CDC’s websitefor a complete list, and check regularly for updates as more \ndata become available to inform this issue. \n◦ Facility administrators should consult with their occupational health providers to determine whether it would be \nallowable to reassign duties for specific staff members to reduce their likelihood of exposure to COVID-19. \n• Offer the seasonal influenza vaccine to all incarcerated/detained persons (existing population and new intakes) \nand staff throughout the influenza season. Symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of influenza. Preventing \ninfluenza cases in a facility can speed the detection of COVID-19 cases and reduce pressure on healthcare resources.\n• Reference the Occupational Safety and Health Administration website  for recommendations regarding \nworker health.\n• Review CDC’s guidance for businesses and employersto identify any additional strategies the facility can use within \nits role as an employer.\nOperations & Supplies\n• Ensure that sufficient stocks of hygiene supplies, cleaning supplies, PPE, and medical supplies (consistent with \nthe healthcare capabilities of the facility) are on hand and available, and have a plan in place to restock as \nneeded if COVID-19 transmission occurs within the facility.\n◦ Standard medical supplies for daily clinic needs\n◦ Tissues\n◦ Liquid soap when possible. If bar soap must be used, ensure that it does not irritate the skin and thereby \ndiscourage frequent hand washing.\n◦ Hand drying supplies\n◦ Alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol (where permissible based on security restrictions)\n◦ Cleaning supplies, including EPA-registered disinfectants effective against the virus that causes COVID-19 \n◦ Recommended PPE (facemasks, N95 respirators, eye protection, disposable medical gloves, and disposable \ngowns/one-piece coveralls). See PPE sectionand Table 1for more detailed information, including \nrecommendations for extending the life of all PPE categories in the event of shortages, and when face masks are \nacceptable alternatives to N95s. Visit CDC’s website for a calculator to help determine rate of PPE usage.\n◦ Sterile viral transport media and sterile swabs to collect nasopharyngeal specimensif COVID-19 testing is \nindicated\n• Make contingency plans for the probable event of PPE shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly for \nnon-healthcare workers.\n◦ See CDC guidance optimizing PPE supplies.\n• Consider relaxing restrictions on allowing alcohol-based hand sanitizer in the secure setting where security \nconcerns allow. If soap and water are not available, CDC recommendscleaning hands with an alcohol-based hand \nsanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Consider allowing staff to carry individual-sized bottles for their personal \nhand hygiene while on duty. \n• Provide a no-cost supply of soap to incarcerated/detained persons, sufficient to allow frequent hand washing.\n(See Hygienesection below for additional detail regarding recommended frequency and protocol for hand washing.) \n◦ Provide liquid soap where possible. If bar soap must be used, ensure that it does not irritate the skin and \nthereby discourage frequent hand washing.\n• If not already in place, employers operating within the facility should establish a respiratory protection program\nas appropriate, to ensure that staff and incarcerated/detained persons are fit tested for any respiratory \nprotection they will need within the scope of their responsibilities.\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correction... 3/24/2020\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-14   Filed 03/25/20   Page 9 of 25   Page ID\n #:5226\nGuidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detenti...Page 8 of 24\n• Ensure that staff and incarcerated/detained persons are trained to correctly don, doff, and dispose of PPE that \nthey will need to use within the scope of their responsibilities. See Table 1 for recommended PPE for \nincarcerated/detained persons and staff with varying levels of contact with COVID-19 cases or their close contacts.\nPrevention\nCases of COVID-19 have been documented in all 50 US states. Correctional and detention facilities can prevent \nintroduction of COVID-19 from the community and reduce transmission if it is already inside by reinforcing good hygiene \npractices among incarcerated/detained persons, staff, and visitors (including increasing access to soap and paper towels), \nintensifying cleaning/disinfection practices, and implementing social distancing strategies.\nBecause many individuals infected with COVID-19 do not display symptoms, the virus could be present in facilities before \ncases are identified. Both good hygiene practices and social distancing are critical in preventing further transmission.\nOperations\n• Stay in communication with partners about your facility’s current situation.\n◦ State, local, territorial, and/or tribal health departments\n◦ Other correctional facilities\n• Communicate with the public about any changes to facility operations, including visitation programs.\n• Restrict transfers of incarcerated/detained persons to and from other jurisdictions and facilities unless necessary \nfor medical evaluation, medical isolation/quarantine, clinical care, extenuating security concerns, or to prevent \novercrowding.\n◦ Strongly consider postponing non-urgent outside medical visits.\n◦ If a transfer is absolutely necessary, perform verbal screening and a temperature check as outlined in the \nScreeningsection below, before the individual leaves the facility. If an individual does not clear the screening \nprocess, delay the transfer and follow the protocol for a suspected COVID-19 case–including putting a face \nmask on the individual, immediately placing them under medical isolation, and evaluating them for possible \nCOVID-19 testing. If the transfer must still occur, ensure that the receiving facility has capacity to properly isolate \nthe individual upon arrival. Ensure that staff transporting the individual wear recommended PPE (see Table 1) \nand that the transport vehicle is cleanedthoroughly after transport.\n• Implement lawful alternatives to in-person court appearances where permissible.\n• Where relevant, consider suspending co-pays for incarcerated/detained persons seeking medical evaluation for \nrespiratory symptoms.\n• Limit the number of operational entrances and exits to the facility.\nCleaning and Disinfecting Practices\n• Even if COVID-19 cases have not yet been identified inside the facility or in the surrounding community, begin \nimplementing intensified cleaning and disinfecting procedures according to the recommendations below. These \nmeasures may prevent spread of COVID-19 if introduced.\n• Adhere to CDC recommendations for cleaning and disinfection during the COVID-19 response. Monitor these \nrecommendations for updates. \n◦ Several times per day, clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that are frequently touched, especially in \ncommon areas. Such surfaces may include objects/surfaces not ordinarily cleaned daily (e.g., doorknobs, light \nswitches, sink handles, countertops, toilets, toilet handles, recreation equipment, kiosks, and telephones).\n◦ Staff should clean shared equipment several times per day and on a conclusion of use basis (e.g., radios, service \nweapons, keys, handcuffs).\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correction... 3/24/2020\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-14   Filed 03/25/20   Page 10 of 25   Page ID\n #:5227\nGuidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detenti...Page 9 of 24\n◦ Use household cleaners and EPA-registered disinfectants effective against the virus that causes COVID-19  as \nappropriate for the surface, following label instructions. This may require lifting restrictions on undiluted \ndisinfectants.\n◦ Labels contain instructions for safe and effective use of the cleaning product, including precautions that should \nbe taken when applying the product, such as wearing gloves and making sure there is good ventilation during \nuse.\n• Consider increasing the number of staff and/or incarcerated/detained persons trained and responsible for \ncleaning common areas to ensure continual cleaning of these areas throughout the day.\n• Ensure adequate supplies to support intensified cleaning and disinfection practices, and have a plan in place to \nrestock rapidly if needed.\nHygiene\n• Reinforce healthy hygiene practices, and provide and continually restock hygiene supplies throughout the facility, \nincluding in bathrooms, food preparation and dining areas, intake areas, visitor entries and exits, visitation \nrooms and waiting rooms, common areas, medical, and staff-restricted areas (e.g., break rooms).\n• Encourage all persons in the facility to take the following actions to protect themselves and others from COVID-\n19. Post signage throughout the facility, and communicate this information verbally on a regular basis. Sample \nsignage and other communications materialsare available on the CDC website. Ensure that materials can be \nunderstood by non-English speakers and those with low literacy, and make necessary accommodations for those \nwith cognitive or intellectual disabilities and those who are deaf, blind, or low-vision. \n◦ Practice good cough etiquette: Cover your mouth and nose with your elbow (or ideally with a tissue) rather \nthan with your hand when you cough or sneeze, and throw all tissues in the trash immediately after use.\n◦ Practice good hand hygiene:Regularly wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially \nafter coughing, sneezing, or blowing your nose; after using the bathroom; before eating or preparing food; \nbefore taking medication; and after touching garbage.\n◦ Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth without cleaning your hands first. \n◦ Avoid sharing eating utensils, dishes, and cups.\n◦ Avoid non-essential physical contact. \n• Provide incarcerated/detained persons and staff no-cost access to:\n◦ Soap–Provide liquid soap where possible. If bar soap must be used, ensure that it does not irritate the skin, as \nthis would discourage frequent hand washing.\n◦ Running water, and hand drying machines or disposable paper towelsfor hand washing\n◦ Tissuesand no-touch trash receptacles for disposal\n• Provide alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol where permissible based on security restrictions.\nConsider allowing staff to carry individual-sized bottles to maintain hand hygiene.\n• Communicate that sharing drugs and drug preparation equipment can spread COVID-19 due to potential \ncontamination of shared items and close contact between individuals.\nPrevention Practices for Incarcerated/Detained Persons\n• Perform pre-intake screening and temperature checks for all new entrants. Screening should take place in the \nsallyport, before beginning the intake process, in order to identify and immediately place individuals with \nsymptoms under medical isolation. See Screening sectionbelow for the wording of screening questions and a \nrecommended procedure to safely perform a temperature check. Staff performing temperature checks should wear \nrecommended PPE (see PPE section below). \n◦ If an individual has symptoms of COVID-19(fever, cough, shortness of breath):\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correction... 3/24/2020\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-14   Filed 03/25/20   Page 11 of 25   Page ID\n #:5228\nGuidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Dete... Page 10 of 24\n◾ Require the individual to wear a face mask.\n◾ Ensure that staff who have direct contact with the symptomatic individual wear recommended PPE.\n◾ Place the individual under medical isolation(ideally in a room near the screening location, rather than \ntransporting the ill individual through the facility), and refer to healthcare staff for further evaluation. (See \nInfection Controland Clinical Caresections below.)\n◾ Facilities without onsite healthcare staff should contact their state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health \ndepartment to coordinate effective medical isolation and necessary medical care.\n◦ If an individual is a close contactof a known COVID-19 case (but has no COVID-19 symptoms):\n◾ Quarantine the individual and monitor for symptoms two times per day for 14 days. (See Quarantine\nsection below.)\n◾ Facilities without onsite healthcare staff should contact their state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health \ndepartment to coordinate effective quarantine and necessary medical care.\n• Implement social distancingstrategies to increase the physical space between incarcerated/detained persons \n(ideally 6 feet between all individuals, regardless of the presence of symptoms). Strategies will need to be tailored \nto the individual space in the facility and the needs of the population and staff. Not all strategies will be feasible in all \nfacilities. Example strategies with varying levels of intensity include: \n◦ Common areas:\n◾ Enforce increased space between individuals in holding cells, as well as in lines and waiting areas such as \nintake (e.g., remove every other chair in a waiting area)\n◦ Recreation:\n◾ Choose recreation spaces where individuals can spread out\n◾ Stagger time in recreation spaces\n◾ Restrict recreation space usage to a single housing unit per space\n(where feasible)\n◦ Meals:\n◾ Stagger meals\n◾ Rearrange seating in the dining hall so that there is more space between individuals (e.g., remove every \nother chair and use only one side of the table)\n◾ Provide meals inside housing units or cells\n◦ Group activities:\n◾ Limit the size of group activities\n◾ Increase space between individuals during group activities\n◾ Suspend group programs where participants are likely to be in closer contact than they are in their housing \nenvironment\n◾ Consider alternatives to existing group activities, in outdoor areas or other areas where individuals can \nspread out\n◦ Housing:\n◾ If space allows, reassign bunks to provide more space between individuals, ideally 6 feet or more in all \ndirections. (Ensure that bunks are cleanedthoroughly if assigned to a new occupant.)\n◾ Arrange bunks so that individuals sleep head to foot to increase the distance between them\n◾ Rearrange scheduled movements to minimize mixing of individuals from different housing areas\n◦ Medical:\n◾ If possible, designate a room near each housing unit to evaluate individuals with COVID-19 symptoms, \nrather than having them walk through the facility to be evaluated in the medical unit. If this is not feasible, \nconsider staggering sick call.\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correction... 3/24/2020\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-14   Filed 03/25/20   Page 12 of 25   Page ID\n #:5229\nGuidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Dete... Page 11 of 24\n◾ Designate a room near the intake area to evaluate new entrants who are flagged by the intake screening \nprocess for COVID-19 symptoms or case contact, before they move to other parts of the facility.\n• Communicate clearly and frequently with incarcerated/detained persons about changes to their daily routine and \nhow they can contribute to risk reduction.\n• Note that if group activities are discontinued, it will be important to identify alternative forms of activity to \nsupport the mental health of incarcerated/detained persons.\n• Consider suspending work release programs and other programs that involve movement of \nincarcerated/detained individuals in and out of the facility.\n• Provide up-to-date information about COVID-19to incarcerated/detained persons on a regular basis, including:\n◦ Symptoms of COVID-19and its health risks\n◦ Reminders to report COVID-19 symptoms to staff at the first sign of illness\n• Consider having healthcare staff perform rounds on a regular basis to answer questions about COVID-19.\nPrevention Practices for Staff\n• Remind staff to stay at home if they are sick. Ensure that staff are aware that they will not be able to enter the \nfacility if they have symptoms of COVID-19, and that they will be expected to leave the facility as soon as possible if \nthey develop symptoms while on duty.\n• Perform verbal screening (for COVID-19 symptoms and close contact with cases) and temperature checks for all \nstaff daily on entry. See Screeningsection below for wording of screening questions and a recommended procedure \nto safely perform temperature checks. \n◦ In very small facilities with only a few staff, consider self-monitoring or virtual monitoring (e.g., reporting to a \ncentral authority via phone).\n◦ Send staff home who do not clear the screening process, and advise them to follow CDC-recommended steps \nfor persons who are ill with COVID-19 symptoms.\n• Provide staff with up-to-date information about COVID-19and about facility policies on a regular basis, including: \n◦ Symptoms of COVID-19and its health risks\n◦ Employers’ sick leave policy\n◦ If staff develop a fever, cough, or shortness of breath while at work: immediately put on a face mask, inform \nsupervisor, leave the facility, and follow CDC-recommended steps for persons who are ill with COVID-19 \nsymptoms.\n◦ If staff test positive for COVID-19:inform workplace and personal contacts immediately, and do not return to \nwork until a decision to discontinue home medical isolation precautions is made. Monitor CDC guidance on \ndiscontinuing home isolationregularly as circumstances evolve rapidly.\n◦ If a staff member is identified as a close contact of a COVID-19 case (either within the facility or in the \ncommunity):self-quarantine at home for 14 days and return to work if symptoms do not develop. If symptoms \ndo develop, follow CDC-recommended steps for persons who are ill with COVID-19 symptoms.\n• If a staff member has a confirmed COVID-19 infection, the relevant employers should inform other staff about \ntheir possible exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace, but should maintain confidentiality as required by the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act.\n◦ Employees who are close contactsof the case should then self-monitor for symptoms(i.e., fever, cough, or \nshortness of breath).\n• When feasible and consistent with security priorities, encourage staff to maintain a distance of 6 feet or more \nfrom an individual with respiratory symptoms while interviewing, escorting, or interacting in other ways.\n• Ask staff to keep interactions with individuals with respiratory symptoms as brief as possible.\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correction... 3/24/2020\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-14   Filed 03/25/20   Page 13 of 25   Page ID\n #:5230\nGuidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Dete... Page 12 of 24\nPrevention Practices for Visitors\n• If possible, communicate with potential visitors to discourage contact visits in the interest of their own health and \nthe health of their family members and friends inside the facility.\n• Perform verbal screening (for COVID-19 symptoms and close contact with cases) and temperature checks for all \nvisitors and volunteers on entry. See Screeningsection below for wording of screening questions and a \nrecommended procedure to safely perform temperature checks. \n◦ Staff performing temperature checks should wear recommended PPE.\n◦ Exclude visitors and volunteers who do not clear the screening process or who decline screening.\n• Provide alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol in visitor entrances, exits, and waiting areas.\n• Provide visitors and volunteers with information to prepare them for screening.\n◦ Instruct visitors to postpone their visit if they have symptoms of respiratory illness.\n◦ If possible, inform potential visitors and volunteers before they travel to the facility that they should expect to be \nscreened for COVID-19 (including a temperature check), and will be unable to enter the facility if they do not \nclear the screening process or if they decline screening.\n◦ Display signageoutside visiting areas explaining the COVID-19 screening and temperature check process. \nEnsure that materials are understandable for non-English speakers and those with low literacy.\n• Promote non-contact visits:\n◦ Encourage incarcerated/detained persons to limit contact visits in the interest of their own health and the health \nof their visitors.\n◦ Consider reducing or temporarily eliminating the cost of phone calls for incarcerated/detained persons.\n◦ Consider increasing incarcerated/detained persons’ telephone privileges to promote mental health and reduce \nexposure from direct contact with community visitors.\n• Consider suspending or modifying visitation programs, if legally permissible. For example, provide access to \nvirtual visitation options where available. \n◦ If moving to virtual visitation, clean electronic surfaces regularly. (See Cleaningguidance below for instructions \non cleaning electronic surfaces.)\n◦ Inform potential visitors of changes to, or suspension of, visitation programs.\n◦ Clearly communicate any visitation program changes to incarcerated/detained persons, along with the reasons \nfor them (including protecting their health and their family and community members’ health).\n◦ If suspending contact visits, provide alternate means (e.g., phone or video visitation) for incarcerated/detained \nindividuals to engage with legal representatives, clergy, and other individuals with whom they have legal right to \nconsult.\nNOTE: Suspending visitation would be done in the interest of incarcerated/detained persons’ physical health and the \nhealth of the general public. However, visitation is important to maintain mental health. If visitation is suspended, facilities \nshould explore alternative ways for incarcerated/detained persons to communicate with their families, friends, and other \nvisitors in a way that is not financially burdensome for them. See above suggestions for promoting non-contact visits.\n• Restrict non-essential vendors, volunteers, and tours from entering the facility.\nManagement\nIf there has been a suspected COVID-19 case inside the facility (among incarcerated/detained persons, staff, or visitors \nwho have recently been inside), begin implementing Management strategies while test results are pending. Essential \nManagement strategies include placing cases and individuals with symptoms under medical isolation, quarantining their \nclose contacts, and facilitating necessary medical care, while observing relevant infection control and environmental \ndisinfection protocols and wearing recommended PPE.\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correction... 3/24/2020\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-14   Filed 03/25/20   Page 14 of 25   Page ID\n #:5231\nGuidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Dete... Page 13 of 24\nOperations\n• Implement alternate work arrangements deemed feasible in the Operational Preparedness\n• Suspend all transfers of incarcerated/detained persons to and from other jurisdictions and facilities (including \nwork release where relevant), unless necessary for medical evaluation, medical isolation/quarantine, care, \nextenuating security concerns, or to prevent overcrowding.\n◦ If a transfer is absolutely necessary, perform verbal screening and a temperature check as outlined in the \nScreeningsection below, before the individual leaves the facility. If an individual does not clear the screening \nprocess, delay the transfer and follow the protocol for a suspected COVID-19 case–including putting a face \nmask on the individual, immediately placing them under medical isolation, and evaluating them for possible \nCOVID-19 testing. If the transfer must still occur, ensure that the receiving facility has capacity to appropriately \nisolate the individual upon arrival. Ensure that staff transporting the individual wear recommended PPE (see \nTable 1) and that the transport vehicle is cleanedthoroughly after transport.\n• If possible, consider quarantining all new intakes for 14 days before they enter the facility’s general population \n(SEPARATELY from other individuals who are quarantined due to contact with a COVID-19 case). Subsequently in \nthis document, this practice is referred to as routine intake quarantine.\n• When possible, arrange lawful alternatives to in-person court appearances.\n• Incorporate screening for COVID-19 symptoms and a temperature check into release planning. \n◦ Screen all releasing individuals for COVID-19 symptoms and perform a temperature check. (See Screening\nsection below.) \n◾ If an individual does not clear the screening process, follow the protocol for a suspected COVID-19 case–\nincluding putting a face mask on the individual, immediately placing them under medical isolation, and \nevaluating them for possible COVID-19 testing.\n◾ If the individual is released before the recommended medical isolation period is complete, discuss release \nof the individual with state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health departments to ensure safe medical \ntransport and continued shelter and medical care, as part of release planning. Make direct linkages to \ncommunity resources to ensure proper medical isolation and access to medical care.\n◾ Before releasing an incarcerated/detained individual with COVID-19 symptoms to a community-based \nfacility, such as a homeless shelter, contact the facility’s staff to ensure adequate time for them to prepare \nto continue medical isolation, or contact local public health to explore alternate housing options.\n• Coordinate with state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health departments.\n◦ When a COVID-19 case is suspected, work with public health to determine action. See Medical Isolationsection \nbelow.\n◦ When a COVID-19 case is suspected or confirmed, work with public health to identify close contacts who should \nbe placed under quarantine. See Quarantinesection below.\n◦ Facilities with limited onsite medical isolation, quarantine, and/or healthcare services should coordinate closely \nwith state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health departments when they encounter a confirmed or suspected \ncase, in order to ensure effective medical isolation or quarantine, necessary medical evaluation and care, and \nmedical transfer if needed. See Facilities with Limited Onsite Healthcare Servicessection.\nHygiene\n• Continue to ensure that hand hygiene supplies are well-stocked in all areas of the facility. (See above.)\n• Continue to emphasize practicing good hand hygiene and cough etiquette. (See above.)\nCleaning and Disinfecting Practices\n• Continue adhering to recommended cleaning and disinfection procedures for the facility at large. (See above.)\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correction... 3/24/2020\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-14   Filed 03/25/20   Page 15 of 25   Page ID\n #:5232\nGuidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Dete... Page 14 of 24\n• Reference specific cleaning and disinfection procedures for areas where a COVID-19 case has spent time (below).\nMedical Isolation of Confirmed or Suspected COVID-19 Cases\nNOTE: Some recommendations below apply primarily to facilities with onsite healthcare capacity. Facilities without \nonsite healthcare capacity,or without sufficient space to implement effective medical isolation, should coordinate \nwith local public health officials to ensure that COVID-19 cases will be appropriately isolated, evaluated, tested (if \nindicated), and given care. \n• As soon as an individual develops symptoms of COVID-19, they should wear a face mask (if it does not restrict \nbreathing) and should be immediately placed under medical isolation in a separate environment from other \nindividuals.\n• Keep the individual’s movement outside the medical isolation space to an absolute minimum.\n◦ Provide medical care to cases inside the medical isolation space. See Infection Controland Clinical Caresections \nfor additional details.\n◦ Serve meals to cases inside the medical isolation space.\n◦ Exclude the individual from all group activities.\n◦ Assign the isolated individual a dedicated bathroom when possible.\n• Ensure that the individual is wearing a face mask at all times when outside of the medical isolation space, and \nwhenever another individual enters.Provide clean masks as needed. Masks should be changed at least daily, and \nwhen visibly soiled or wet.\n• Facilities should make every possible effort to place suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases under medical \nisolation individually. Each isolated individual should be assigned their own housing space and bathroom where \npossible. Cohortingshould only be practiced if there are no other available options. \n◦ If cohorting is necessary: \n◾ Only individuals who are laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases should be placed under medical \nisolation as a cohort. Do not cohort confirmed cases with suspected cases or case contacts. \n◾ Unless no other options exist, do not house COVID-19 cases with individuals who have an undiagnosed \nrespiratory infection.\n◾ Ensure that cohorted cases wear face masks at all times.\n◦ In order of preference, individuals under medical isolation should be housed:\n◾ Separately, in single cells with solid walls (i.e., not bars) and solid doors that close fully\n◾ Separately, in single cells with solid walls but without solid doors\n◾ As a cohort, in a large, well-ventilated cell with solid walls and a solid door that closes fully. Employ social \ndistancing strategies related to housing in the Prevention section above.\n◾ As a cohort, in a large, well-ventilated cell with solid walls but without a solid door. Employ social distancing \nstrategies related to housing in the Prevention section above.\n◾ As a cohort, in single cells without solid walls or solid doors (i.e., cells enclosed entirely with bars), \npreferably with an empty cell between occupied cells. (Although individuals are in single cells in this \nscenario, the airflow between cells essentially makes it a cohort arrangement in the context of COVID-19.)\n◾ As a cohort, in multi-person cells without solid walls or solid doors (i.e., cells enclosed entirely with bars), \npreferably with an empty cell between occupied cells. Employ social distancing strategies related to \nhousing in the Prevention section above.\n◾ Safely transfer individual(s) to another facility with available medical isolation capacity in one of the above \narrangements\n(NOTE – Transfer should be avoided due to the potential to introduce infection to another facility; proceed \nonly if no other options are available.)\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correction... 3/24/2020\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-14   Filed 03/25/20   Page 16 of 25   Page ID\n #:5233\nGuidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Dete... Page 15 of 24\nIf the ideal choice does not exist in a facility, use the next best alternative.\n• If the number of confirmed cases exceeds the number of individual medical isolation spaces available in the \nfacility, be especially mindful of cases who are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19.Ideally, they should \nnot be cohorted with other infected individuals. If cohorting is unavoidable, make all possible accommodations to \nprevent transmission of other infectious diseases to the higher-risk individual. (For example, allocate more space for \na higher-risk individual within a shared medical isolation space.) \n◦ Persons at higher risk may include older adults and persons of any age with serious underlying medical \nconditions such as lung disease, heart disease, and diabetes. See CDC’s websitefor a complete list, and check \nregularly for updates as more data become available to inform this issue.\n◦ Note that incarcerated/detained populations have higher prevalence of infectious and chronic diseases and are \nin poorer health than the general population, even at younger ages.\n• Custody staff should be designated to monitor these individuals exclusively where possible.These staff should \nwear recommended PPE as appropriate for their level of contact with the individual under medical isolation (see PPE\nsection below) and should limit their own movement between different parts of the facility to the extent possible.\n• Minimize transfer of COVID-19 cases between spaces within the healthcare unit.\n• Provide individuals under medical isolation with tissues and, if permissible, a lined no-touch trash receptacle.\nInstruct them to: \n◦ Covertheir mouth and nose with a tissue when they cough or sneeze\n◦ Disposeof used tissues immediately in the lined trash receptacle\n◦ Wash handsimmediately with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, clean \nhands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol (where security concerns permit). \nEnsure that hand washing suppliesare continually restocked.\n• Maintain medical isolation until all the following criteria have been met. Monitor the CDC websitefor updates to \nthese criteria.\n◦ For individuals who will be tested to determine if they are still contagious:\n◾ The individual has been free from fever for at least 72 hours without the use of fever-reducing medications \nAND\n◾ The individual’s other symptoms have improved (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) AND\n◾ The individual has tested negative in at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected at least 24 \nhours apart\n◦ For individuals who will NOT be tested to determine if they are still contagious:\n◾ The individual has been free from fever for at least 72 hours without the use of fever-reducing medications \nAND\n◾ The individual’s other symptoms have improved (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) AND\n◾ At least 7 days have passed since the first symptoms appeared\n◦ For individuals who had a confirmed positive COVID-19 test but never showed symptoms:\n◾ At least 7 days have passed since the date of the individual’s first positive COVID-19 test AND\n◾ The individual has had no subsequent illness\n• Restrict cases from leaving the facility while under medical isolation precautions, unless released from custody or \nif a transfer is necessary for medical care, infection control, lack of medical isolation space, or extenuating \nsecurity concerns.\n◦ If an incarcerated/detained individual who is a COVID-19 case is released from custody during their medical \nisolation period, contact public health to arrange for safe transport and continuation of necessary medical care \nand medical isolation as part of release planning.\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correction... 3/24/2020\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-14   Filed 03/25/20   Page 17 of 25   Page ID\n #:5234\nGuidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Dete... Page 16 of 24\nCleaning Spaces where COVID-19 Cases Spent Time\n• Thoroughly clean and disinfect all areas where the confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case spent time. Note – \nthese protocols apply to suspected cases as well as confirmed cases, to ensure adequate disinfection in the event \nthat the suspected case does, in fact, have COVID-19. Refer to the Definitionssection for the distinction between \nconfirmed and suspected cases.\n◦ Close off areas used by the infected individual. If possible, open outside doors and windows to increase air \ncirculation in the area. Wait as long as practical, up to 24 hours under the poorest air exchange conditions \n(consult CDC Guidelines for Environmental Infection Control in Health-Care Facilities for wait time based on \ndifferent ventilation conditions), before beginning to clean and disinfect, to minimize potential for exposure to \nrespiratory droplets.\n◦ Clean and disinfect all areas (e.g., cells, bathrooms, and common areas) used by the infected individual, focusing \nespecially on frequently touched surfaces (see list above in Prevention section).\n• Hard (non-porous) surface cleaning and disinfection\n◦ If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.\n◦ For disinfection, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants should be effective. Choose cleaning \nproducts based on security requirements within the facility. \n◾ Consult a list of products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19  . Follow \nthe manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application \nmethod and contact time, etc.).\n◾ Diluted household bleach solutions can be used if appropriate for the surface. Follow the manufacturer’s \ninstructions for application and proper ventilation, and check to ensure the product is not past its \nexpiration date. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser. Unexpired household \nbleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted. Prepare a bleach solution by mixing: \n◾ 5 tablespoons (1/3rdcup) bleach per gallon of water or\n◾ 4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water\n• Soft (porous) surface cleaning and disinfection\n◦ For soft (porous) surfaces such as carpeted floors and rugs, remove visible contamination if present and clean \nwith appropriate cleaners indicated for use on these surfaces. After cleaning: \n◾ If the items can be laundered, launder items in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions using the \nwarmest appropriate water setting for the items and then dry items completely.\n◾ Otherwise, use products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19  and are \nsuitable for porous surfaces.\n• Electronics cleaning and disinfection\n◦ For electronics such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, and remote controls, remove visible contamination if \npresent. \n◾ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products.\n◾ Consider use of wipeable covers for electronics.\n◾ If no manufacturer guidance is available, consider the use of alcohol-based wipes or spray containing at \nleast 70% alcohol to disinfect touch screens. Dry surfaces thoroughly to avoid pooling of liquids.\nAdditional information on cleaning and disinfection of communal facilities such can be found on CDC’s website.\n• Ensure that staff and incarcerated/detained persons performing cleaning wear recommended PPE.(See PPE\nsection below.)\n• Food service items.Cases under medical isolation should throw disposable food service items in the trash in their \nmedical isolation room. Non-disposable food service items should be handled with gloves and washed with hot water \nor in a dishwasher. Individuals handling used food service items should clean their hands after removing gloves.\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correction... 3/24/2020\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-14   Filed 03/25/20   Page 18 of 25   Page ID\n #:5235\nGuidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Dete... Page 17 of 24\n• Laundry from a COVID-19 casescan be washed with other individuals’laundry.\n◦ Individuals handling laundry from COVID-19 cases should wear disposable gloves, discard after each use, and \nclean their hands after.\n◦ Do not shake dirty laundry. This will minimize the possibility of dispersing virus through the air.\n◦ Launder items as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. If possible, launder items \nusing the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely.\n◦ Clean and disinfect clothes hampers according to guidance above for surfaces. If permissible, consider using a \nbag liner that is either disposable or can be laundered.\n• Consult cleaning recommendations aboveto ensure that transport vehicles are thoroughly cleaned after carrying \na confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case.\nQuarantining Close Contacts of COVID-19 Cases\nNOTE: Some recommendations below apply primarily to facilities with onsite healthcare capacity. Facilities without \nonsite healthcare capacity,or without sufficient space to implement effective quarantine, should coordinate with local \npublic health officials to ensure that close contacts of COVID-19 cases will be effectively quarantined and medically \nmonitored.\n• Incarcerated/detained persons who are close contacts of a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case(whether the \ncase is another incarcerated/detained person, staff member, or visitor) should be placed under quarantine for 14 \ndays (see CDC guidelines).\n◦ If an individual is quarantined due to contact with a suspected case who is subsequently tested for COVID-19 \nand receives a negative result, the quarantined individual should be released from quarantine restrictions.\n• In the context of COVID-19, an individual (incarcerated/detained person or staff) is considered a close contactif \nthey:\n◦ Have been within approximately 6 feet of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time OR\n◦ Have had direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g., have been coughed on)\nClose contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a common space with a COVID-19 case. Data to \ninform the definition of close contact are limited. Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of \nexposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 \n(e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk, as does exposure to a severely ill patient).\n• Keep a quarantined individual’s movement outside the quarantine space to an absolute minimum. \n◦ Provide medical evaluation and care inside or near the quarantine space when possible.\n◦ Serve meals inside the quarantine space.\n◦ Exclude the quarantined individual from all group activities.\n◦ Assign the quarantined individual a dedicated bathroom when possible.\n• Facilities should make every possible effort to quarantine close contacts of COVID-19 cases individually.Cohorting\nmultiple quarantined close contacts of a COVID-19 case could transmit COVID-19 from those who are infected to \nthose who are uninfected. Cohorting should only be practiced if there are no other available options. \n◦ If cohorting of close contacts under quarantine is absolutely necessary, symptoms of all individuals should be \nmonitored closely, and individuals with symptoms of COVID-19 should be placed under medical isolation\n◦ If an entire housing unit is under quarantine due to contact with a case from the same housing unit, the entire \nhousing unit may need to be treated as a cohort and quarantine in place.\n◦ Some facilities may choose to quarantine all new intakes for 14 days before moving them to the facility’s general \npopulation as a general rule (not because they were exposed to a COVID-19 case). Under this scenario, avoid \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correction... 3/24/2020\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-14   Filed 03/25/20   Page 19 of 25   Page ID\n #:5236\nGuidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Dete... Page 18 of 24\nmixing individuals quarantined due to exposure to a COVID-19 case with individuals undergoing routine intake \nquarantine.\n◦ If at all possible, do not add more individuals to an existing quarantine cohort after the 14-day quarantine clock \nhas started.\n• If the number of quarantined individuals exceeds the number of individual quarantine spaces available in the \nfacility, be especially mindful of those who are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19.Ideally, they should \nnot be cohorted with other quarantined individuals. If cohorting is unavoidable, make all possible accommodations \nto reduce exposure risk for the higher-risk individuals. (For example, intensify social distancing strategiesfor higher-\nrisk individuals.)\n• In order of preference, multiple quarantined individuals should be housed:\n◦ Separately, in single cells with solid walls (i.e., not bars) and solid doors that close fully\n◦ Separately, in single cells with solid walls but without solid doors\n◦ As a cohort, in a large, well-ventilated cell with solid walls, a solid door that closes fully, and at least 6 feet of \npersonal space assigned to each individual in all directions\n◦ As a cohort, in a large, well-ventilated cell with solid walls and at least 6 feet of personal space assigned to each \nindividual in all directions, but without a solid door\n◦ As a cohort, in single cells without solid walls or solid doors (i.e., cells enclosed entirely with bars), preferably \nwith an empty cell between occupied cells creating at least 6 feet of space between individuals. (Although \nindividuals are in single cells in this scenario, the airflow between cells essentially makes it a cohort arrangement \nin the context of COVID-19.)\n◦ As a cohort, in multi-person cells without solid walls or solid doors (i.e., cells enclosed entirely with bars), \npreferably with an empty cell between occupied cells. Employ social distancing strategies related to housing in \nthe Prevention sectionto maintain at least 6 feet of space between individuals housed in the same cell.\n◦ As a cohort, in individuals’ regularly assigned housing unit but with no movement outside the unit (if an entire \nhousing unit has been exposed). Employ social distancing strategies related to housing in the Prevention section \nabove to maintain at least 6 feet of space between individuals.\n◦ Safely transfer to another facility with capacity to quarantine in one of the above arrangements\n(NOTE – Transfer should be avoided due to the potential to introduce infection to another facility; proceed only \nif no other options are available.)\n• Quarantined individuals should wear face masks if feasible based on local supply, as source control, under the \nfollowing circumstances (see PPE sectionand Table 1): \n◦ If cohorted, quarantined individuals should wear face masks at all times (to prevent transmission from infected \nto uninfected individuals).\n◦ If quarantined separately, individuals should wear face masks whenever a non-quarantined individual enters the \nquarantine space.\n◦ All quarantined individuals should wear a face mask if they must leave the quarantine space for any reason.\n◦ Asymptomatic individuals under routine intake quarantine(with no known exposure to a COVID-19 case) do not \nneed to wear face masks.\n• Staff who have close contact with quarantined individuals should wear recommended PPE if feasible based on \nlocal supply, feasibility, and safety within the scope of their duties(see PPE sectionand Table 1). \n◦ Staff supervising asymptomatic incarcerated/detained persons under routine intake quarantine(with no known \nexposure to a COVID-19 case) do not need to wear PPE.\n• Quarantined individuals should be monitored for COVID-19 symptoms twice per day, including temperature \nchecks.\n◦ If an individual develops symptoms, they should be moved to medical isolation immediately and further \nevaluated. (SeeMedical Isolationsection above.)\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correction... 3/24/2020\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-14   Filed 03/25/20   Page 20 of 25   Page ID\n #:5237\nGuidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Dete... Page 19 of 24\n◦ See Screeningsection for a procedure to perform temperature checks safely on asymptomatic close contacts of \nCOVID-19 cases.\n• If an individual who is part of a quarantined cohort becomes symptomatic:\n◦ If the individual is tested for COVID-19 and tests positive:the 14-day quarantine clock for the remainder of the \ncohort must be reset to 0.\n◦ If the individual is tested for COVID-19 and tests negative:the 14-day quarantine clock for this individual and \nthe remainder of the cohort does not need to be reset. This individual can return from medical isolation to the \nquarantined cohort for the remainder of the quarantine period.\n◦ If the individual is not tested for COVID-19:the 14-day quarantine clock for the remainder of the cohort must \nbe reset to 0.\n• Restrict quarantined individuals from leaving the facility (including transfers to other facilities) during the 14-day \nquarantine period, unless released from custody or a transfer is necessary for medical care, infection control, \nlack of quarantine space, or extenuating security concerns.\n• Quarantined individuals can be released from quarantine restrictions if they have not developed symptoms \nduring the 14-day quarantine period.\n• Meals should be provided to quarantined individuals in their quarantine spaces.Individuals under quarantine \nshould throw disposable food service items in the trash. Non-disposable food service items should be handled with \ngloves and washed with hot water or in a dishwasher. Individuals handling used food service items should clean their \nhands after removing gloves.\n• Laundry from quarantined individuals can be washed with other individuals’ laundry.\n◦ Individuals handling laundry from quarantined persons should wear disposable gloves, discard after each use, \nand clean their hands after.\n◦ Do not shake dirty laundry. This will minimize the possibility of dispersing virus through the air.\n◦ Launder items as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. If possible, launder items \nusing the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely.\n◦ Clean and disinfect clothes hampers according to guidance above for surfaces. If permissible, consider using a \nbag liner that is either disposable or can be laundered.\nManagement of Incarcerated/Detained Persons with COVID-19 \nSymptoms\nNOTE: Some recommendations below apply primarily to facilities with onsite healthcare capacity. Facilities without \nonsite healthcare capacity or without sufficient space for medical isolation should coordinate with local public health \nofficials to ensure that suspected COVID-19 cases will be effectively isolated, evaluated, tested (if indicated), and given \ncare.\n• If possible, designate a room near each housing unit for healthcare staff to evaluate individuals with COVID-19 \nsymptoms, rather than having them walk through the facility to be evaluated in the medical unit.\n• Incarcerated/detained individuals with COVID-19 symptoms should wear a face mask and should be placed under \nmedical isolation immediately. Discontinue the use of a face mask if it inhibits breathing. See Medical Isolation\nsection above. \n• Medical staff should evaluate symptomatic individuals to determine whether COVID-19 testing is indicated.Refer \nto CDC guidelines for information on evaluationand testing. See Infection Controland Clinical Caresections below as \nwell.\n• If testing is indicated (or if medical staff need clarification on when testing is indicated), contact the state, local, \ntribal, and/or territorial health department. Work with public health or private labs as available to access testing \nsupplies or services. \n◦ If the COVID-19 test is positive, continue medical isolation. (See Medical Isolationsection above.)\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correction... 3/24/2020\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-14   Filed 03/25/20   Page 21 of 25   Page ID\n #:5238\nGuidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Dete... Page 20 of 24\n◦ If the COVID-19 test is negative, return the individual to their prior housing assignment unless they require \nfurther medical assessment or care.\nManagement Strategies for Incarcerated/Detained Persons without \nCOVID-19 Symptoms\n• Provide clear informationto incarcerated/detained persons about the presence of COVID-19 cases within the \nfacility, and the need to increase social distancing and maintain hygiene precautions. \n◦ Consider having healthcare staff perform regular rounds to answer questions about COVID-19.\n◦ Ensure that information is provided in a manner that can be understood by non-English speaking individuals \nand those with low literacy, and make necessary accommodations for those with cognitive or intellectual \ndisabilities and those who are deaf, blind, or low-vision.\n• Implement daily temperature checksin housing units where COVID-19 cases have been identified, especially if \nthere is concern that incarcerated/detained individuals are not notifying staff of symptoms.See Screeningsection \nfor a procedure to safely perform a temperature check.\n• Consider additional options to intensify social distancingwithin the facility.\nManagement Strategies for Staff\n• Provide clear information to staff about the presence of COVID-19 cases within the facility, and the need to \nenforce social distancing and encourage hygiene precautions. \n◦ Consider having healthcare staff perform regular rounds to answer questions about COVID-19 from staff.\n• Staff identified as close contacts of a COVID-19 case should self-quarantine at home for 14 days and may return \nto work if symptoms do not develop. \n◦ See abovefor definition of a close contact.\n◦ Refer to CDC guidelinesfor further recommendations regarding home quarantine for staff.\nInfection Control\nInfection control guidance below is applicable to all types of correctional facilities. Individual facilities should assess \ntheir unique needs based on the types of exposure staff and incarcerated/detained persons may have with confirmed \nor suspected COVID-19 cases.\n• All individuals who have the potential for direct or indirect exposure to COVID-19 cases or infectious materials \n(including body substances; contaminated medical supplies, devices, and equipment; contaminated \nenvironmental surfaces; or contaminated air) should follow infection control practices outlined in the CDC \nInterim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed \nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings. Monitor these guidelines regularly for updates.\n◦ Implement the above guidance as fully as possible within the correctional/detention context. Some of the \nspecific language may not apply directly to healthcare settings within correctional facilities and detention \ncenters, or to facilities without onsite healthcare capacity, and may need to be adapted to reflect facility \noperations and custody needs.\n◦ Note that these recommendations apply to staff as well as to incarcerated/detained individuals who may come \nin contact with contaminated materials during the course of their work placement in the facility (e.g., cleaning).\n• Staff should exercise caution when in contact with individuals showing symptoms of a respiratory infection.\nContact should be minimized to the extent possible until the infected individual is wearing a face mask. If COVID-19 is \nsuspected, staff should wear recommended PPE (see PPEsection).\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correction... 3/24/2020\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-14   Filed 03/25/20   Page 22 of 25   Page ID\n #:5239\nGuidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Dete... Page 21 of 24\n• Refer to PPEsection to determine recommended PPE for individuals persons in contact with confirmed COVID-19 \ncases, contacts, and potentially contaminated items.\nClinical Care of COVID-19 Cases\n• Facilities should ensure that incarcerated/detained individuals receive medical evaluation and treatment at the \nfirst signs of COVID-19 symptoms.\n◦ If a facility is not able to provide such evaluation and treatment, a plan should be in place to safely transfer the \nindividual to another facility or local hospital.\n◦ The initial medical evaluation should determine whether a symptomatic individual is at higher risk for severe \nillness from COVID-19. Persons at higher risk may include older adults and persons of any age with serious \nunderlying medical conditions such as lung disease, heart disease, and diabetes. See CDC’s websitefor a \ncomplete list, and check regularly for updates as more data become available to inform this issue.\n• Staff evaluating and providing care for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases should follow the CDC Interim \nClinical Guidance for Management of Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)and monitor the \nguidance website regularly for updates to these recommendations.\n• Healthcare staff should evaluate persons with respiratory symptoms or contact with a COVID-19 case in a \nseparate room, with the door closed if possible, while wearing recommended PPEand ensuring that the \nsuspected case is wearing a face mask.\n◦ If possible, designate a room near each housing unit to evaluate individuals with COVID-19 symptoms, rather \nthan having them walk through the facility to be evaluated in the medical unit.\n• Clinicians are strongly encouraged to test for other causes of respiratory illness (e.g., influenza).\n• The facility should have a plan in place to safely transfer persons with severe illness from COVID-19 to a local \nhospital if they require care beyond what the facility is able to provide.\n• When evaluating and treating persons with symptoms of COVID-19 who do not speak English, using a language \nline or provide a trained interpreter when possible.\nRecommended PPE and PPE Training for Staff and \nIncarcerated/Detained Persons\n• Ensure that all staff (healthcare and non-healthcare) and incarcerated/detained persons who will have contact \nwith infectious materials in their work placements have been trained to correctly don, doff, and dispose of PPE \nrelevant to the level of contact they will have with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases.\n◦ Ensure that staff and incarcerated/detained persons who require respiratory protection (e.g., N95s) for their \nwork responsibilities have been medically cleared, trained, and fit-tested in the context of an employer’s \nrespiratory protection program.\n◦ For PPE training materials and posters, please visit the CDC website on Protecting Healthcare Personnel.\n• Ensure that all staff are trained to perform hand hygiene after removing PPE.\n• If administrators anticipate that incarcerated/detained persons will request unnecessary PPE, consider providing \ntraining on the different types of PPE that are needed for differing degrees of contact with COVID-19 cases and \ncontacts, and the reasons for those differences (see Table 1). Monitor linked CDC guidelines in Table 1 for \nupdates to recommended PPE.\n• Keep recommended PPE near the spaces in the facility where it could be needed, to facilitate quick access in an \nemergency.\n• Recommended PPE for incarcerated/detained individuals and staff in a correctional facility will vary based on the \ntype of contact they have with COVID-19 cases and their contacts (see Table 1).

Clean and \ndisinfect duty belt and gear prior to reuse using a household cleaning spray or wipe, according to the \nproduct label.\n◾ If there are shortages of gowns, they should be prioritized for aerosol-generating procedures, care \nactivities where splashes and sprays are anticipated, and high-contact patient care activities that provide \nopportunities for transfer of pathogens to the hands and clothing of staff.\n• Note that shortages of all PPE categories are anticipated during the COVID-19 response, particularly for non-\nhealthcare workers. Guidance for optimizing the supply of each category can be found on CDC’s website:\n◦ Guidance in the event of a shortage of N95 respirators\n◾ Based on local and regional situational analysis of PPE supplies, face masks are an acceptable alternative \nwhen the supply chain of respirators cannot meet the demand.

Page 24 of 24\nIncarcerated/Detained Persons, Staff, and Visitors\nThe guidance above recommends verbal screening and temperature checks for incarcerated/detained persons, staff, \nvolunteers, and visitors who enter correctional and detention facilities, as well as incarcerated/detained persons who are \ntransferred to another facility or released from custody. Below, verbal screening questions for COVID-19 symptoms and \ncontact with known cases, and a safe temperature check procedure are detailed.\n• Verbal screening for symptoms of COVID-19 and contact with COVID-19 cases should include the following \nquestions: \n◦ Today or in the past 24 hours, have you had any of the following symptoms?\n◾ Fever, felt feverish, or had chills?\n◾ Cough?\n◾ Difficulty breathing?\n◦ In the past 14 days, have you had contact with a person known to be infected with the novel coronavirus \n(COVID-19)? \n• The following is a protocol to safely check an individual’s temperature: \n◦ Perform hand hygiene\n◦ Put on a face mask, eye protection (goggles or disposable face shield that fully covers the front and sides of the \nface), gown/coveralls, and a single pair of disposable gloves\n◦ Check individual’s temperature\n◦ If performing a temperature check on multiple individuals, ensure that a clean pair of gloves is used for each \nindividual and that the thermometer has been thoroughly cleaned in between each check.If disposable or \nnon-contact thermometers are used and the screener did not have physical contact with an individual, gloves do \nnot need to be changed before the next check. If non-contact thermometers are used, they should be cleaned \nroutinely as recommended by CDC for infection control.\n◦ Remove and discard PPE\n◦ Perform hand hygiene\nPage last reviewed: March 23, 2020\nContent source: National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD), Division of Viral Diseases\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correction... 3/24/2020",

If ORR \nor PSC/DCS rejects the original submission care providers must resubmit the request which \nsignificantly delays the release process. \nSend All Requests Via Email \nCare providers must email fingerprint check requests to SponsorCheck.os@hhs.gov and CA/N \ncheck requests to CANchecks.os@hhs.gov. ORR does not accept documents that are faxed or \nmailed (EXCEPT paper fingerprint cards and original CA/N check state forms, if required). \nPSC/DCS does not accept any documents or requests directly from background check subjects \n(e.g., Sponsors and Household Members) or digital fingerprint sites. Subjects and/or digital \nfingerprint sites must submit all documents to the Case Manager, who reviews the documents \nfor completeness and accuracy prior to submission to PSC. \nPSC/DCS does not accept paper fingerprint cards directly from background check subjects. \nSubjects must submit paper fingerprint cards to the Case Manager, who reviews the documents \nfor completeness and accuracy prior to submission to PSC/DCS. In extenuating circumstances, \nPSC/DCS does accept paper fingerprint cards directly from digital fingerprint sites (see \nAppendix 2.14 Fingerprinting Guidance). \nReview and Inspect Sponsor Documents \nEach background check request email must contain a complete Coversheet, Authorization for \nRelease of Information (ARI} (with a May 14, 2018, revision date or later), and a copy of \nacceptable photo identification. See ORR Policy Guide Section 2.2.4, for a list of acceptable \ndocuments. Do not include any other supporting documents (e.g. proof of address, birth \ncertificates) with the request. \nSend Only Complete, Accurate and Legible Documents \nCare providers must ensure: \n•  That all fields in the Coversheet and ARI are complete and accurate and that all five \npages of the ARI are included. The sponsor must sign the ARI. \n•  That the copy of the photo ID is readable-that the subject's picture is clear, and that \nthe information on the ID is legible. \n•  For paper fingerprint submissions, verify in advance of submission that the sponsor has \ncompleted the descriptor/identifier and signature fields (see Appendix 2.13 Fingerprint \n(:.~.r.~). The Case Manager must also include the five page signed ARI and photo ID in \norder for PSC to match the cards to the original email request. \nDefendants' Prod. Vol. 5  24939 \nGOV- 00024939 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-16   Filed 03/25/20   Page 47 of 85   Page ID\n #:5370\n•  For CA/N Checks, that all fields in the state forms are complete and accurate and that \nPSC/DCS instructions were followed. \nPSC/DCS rejects copies of documents that are too dark or too light; and, those with partial, \nmissing, or incomplete information. If the sponsor's handwriting is illegible, include the \ninformation that is unclear typed on a separate page. While pictures of documents are \nacceptable, PSC/DCS rejects images that are unclear or blurred. \nInclude Address History on the ARI \nThe ARI must provide all addresses where the subject resided in the past five years. For non \nU.S. addresses the subject enters the country in which they resided in the \"City (Country)\" \ncolumn of the address table in the ARI and complete the \"From date\" and \"To date\" columns. \nUpdate the UAC Portal and Cancel Unnecessary Background Check Requests \nCreate subject records in the UAC Portal after identifying a sponsor or household member. \nEnter a check mark on the \"Check Requested?\" column next to the types of checks requested to \nallow PSC/DCS to record the results. These steps must be completed before the background \ncheck request is emailed to PSC/DCS. \nEmail notification to PSC within one business day if a background check requires cancellation. \nRequest Background Checks for Individuals Who Have Previously Completed \nBackground Checks \nIn cases where an individual has previously completed a background check, the case manager \nmust still formally request the background check from PSC/DCS with all required paperwork \n(this includes a new Coversheet, a new ARI, and copy of a government issued photo I D). \nPSC/DCS automatically checks to see if the potential sponsor, household member, or adult \ncaregiver has previously sponsored a UAC and if he/she has completed any of the following \nbackground checks: \n•  FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) \n•  CA/N Check \n•  FBI/BSU Civil Name Check \nPSC/DCS will forward the results of an existing check to the case manager and/or FFS if it has \nbeen 270 days or less since the background check was completed. In these cases, the individual \nwill not need to be fingerprinted again nor will a new CA/N check request need to be sent to \nthe state. If the background check is older than 270 days, PSC/DCS is required to conduct a new \ncheck which will require new fingerprints and/or submission of a new CA/N Check request to \nthe state. \nDefendants' Prod.

Immediately upon receipt of the care provider email including signed Request for a \nFlores Bond Hearing and completed Motion documents, ORR HQ staff complete the \nfollowing steps: \n•  Logs receipt of the request on an internal Bond Hearing Request Tracker on \nSharePoint. \n•  Saves copies of the Request and Motion documents in a shared electronic folder \naccessible to ORR/DPP. \n•  Creates a bond hearing file for the UAC in which to save all correspondence and \ndocumentation associated with the case, and stores it in a shared electronic \nfolder accessible to ORR/DPP. (ORR HQ staff track the case and communications, \nupdating the bond hearing file as appropriate). \n2.  Within 15 business days of receiving the care provider email, in consultation with the \nORR Representative arguing the case, ORR HQ staff file the ORR Motion Requesting \nBond Hearing for Unaccompanied Alien Child -Secure or Staff-Secure Custody or ORR \nMotion Requesting Bond Hearing for Unaccompanied Alien Child (Non-Secure) Shelter \nCare (depending on the child's placement type); pre-trial brief (for cases where ORR \nbelieves the UAC is a danger); supporting evidence; and, motion for telephonic hearing \n(if appropriate) with the local immigration court having jurisdiction over the case. \nAlternatively, ORR staff may file the Motion to the court and later file a pre-trial brief \nwith supporting evidence in order to expedite scheduling a hearing that would \n<0 \notherwise be delayed while the ORR Representative prepares the pre-trial brief. \nIf a UAC in shelter care who is not a danger to the community requests a bond hearing, \nthe ORR HQ staff provides a No Concern form letter along with the ORR Motion \nexplaining to the immigration court that ORR does not consider the UAC a danger. \nNOTE: The child or the child's attorney may make an oral motion in immigration court, \nor file a Motion document with the immigration court directly requesting a Flores bond \nhearing. In these cases, ORR HQ staff will receive notice from the court itself (as \nopposed to the care provider) and file correspondence as indicated in Step 1. The \nassigned ORR Representative will either prepare a pre-file brief, with supporting \nevidence or file a No Concern Letter; and, file a motion for telephonic hearing (if \nappropriate) in response to properly served motions on ORR by the court or attorney of \nrecord. \nDefendants' Prod.

The ORR Representative works with the other ORR and care provider staff to gather \nevidence relevant to a finding that a UAC is a danger to the community. Evidence may \ninclude placement documents; SIRs; police reports/court records, clinical notes, \npsychological reports/records, etc. prior to the hearing. See Quick Glance: Documents \nII \nRelevant to Finding Danger to the Community. \nNOTE: The ORR Representative should collect primary, original (copies of originals are \nacceptable) and documents that are relevant evidence that the child is a danger to the \ncommunity. The ORR Representative saves this evidence in the bond hearing file and \nmay attach it to submissions to the immigration court. \nNOTE: UAC in shelter care may not require an actual hearing before the immigration \njudge, if ORR does not find that the child is a danger to the community. In these \ncircumstances, the ORR HQ staff processing the motions will send the No Concern letter \nstating as such to the immigration court, attached to the UAC's motion for a bond \nhearing. \nDefendants' Prod.

Note that some of the items in the template below (e.g., Letter of \nDesignation) may not apply to all cases and should be deleted if not applicable. Likewise, there may be additional \ninformation needed to make a release decision for more complicated cases. In those instances, the additional \ninformation may be entered with the caveat that it must be written clearly and concisely without re-summarizing \ninformation that is available in the UAC Portal or the UAC's case file. \nThe Release Request is a summary of the information in the UAC Portal, which shows who the sponsor is, if there are any \nconcerns, how the concerns were mitigated, whether all reunification requirements were completed, whether it appears \nto be a safe release and what is being recommended in the case. Documents supporting the Case Manager's \nrecommendation are: \n•  Family Reunification Packet \n•  UAC Assessment \n•  Sponsor Assessment \n•  UAC Case Review \n•  ISP, if applicable \n•  Background Check Results \n•  Home study Recommendation, if applicable \n•  SIR Summary, if applicable \nFor Case Managers, it is recommended that the templates below for Provide Details on Relationship Including Official \nDocumentation and Comments be pasted into and edited in a Word document before copying the information into the \nRelease Request in the UAC Portal.

[Doc. # 81.]  The \nFAC alleges that ORR pursues certain policies and/or practices relating to the detention of \nundocumented immigrant or refugee minors that purportedly violate:  the consent decree entered \nin  Flores  v.  Sessions,  No.  85-4544-DMG  (AGRx)  (C.D.  Cal.)  [Doc.  # 101]  (“Flores \nAgreement”),  the  William  Wilberforce  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization  Act \n(“TVPRA”), the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and the Freedom of Association \nClause of the First Amendment.  See FAC at ¶¶ 2–3, 4.a–d.  The FAC further claims that ORR \npursues certain policies and/or practices that discriminate against undocumented minors on the \nbasis  of  their  actual  or  perceived  disabilities,  which  allegedly  violate  Section  504  of  the \nRehabilitation Act.  See id. at ¶¶ 4.e–f, 192–94. \n \n  On September 28, 2018, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss or Transfer (“MTD”) \n[Doc. # 101] and Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Class Certification.

Alex Azar, et al.  Page  2 of 28 \n   \n \nI. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND1 \n   \n  Plaintiffs Lucas R., Daniela Marisol T., Gabriela N., Miguel Angel S., Jaime D., Sirena \nP., and Benjamin F. (collectively, “Individual Plaintiffs”)2 are undocumented minors who are or \nrecently were in ORR’s custody.3  See FAC at ¶¶ 10–16.  Plaintiff San Fernando Valley Refugee \nChildren Center (“Children Center”) is a non-profit organization that has its principal place of \nbusiness in North Hills, California.  Id. at ¶ 17.  The Children Center’s mission is to provide \ncomprehensive social services (e.g., mental health care, shelter, transitional living assistance, and \nlegal  aid)  to  children,  youth,  and  families  who  entered  the  country  to  seek  refuge  from \npersecution and endemic violence in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala.  Id.  Plaintiff \nUnaccompanied Central American Refugee Empowerment (“UCARE”) is an unincorporated \nconsortium  of  non-profit  agencies  that  has  its  principal  place  of  business  in  Los  Angeles, \nCalifornia; most of the non-profit agencies belonging to UCARE are incorporated in California.  \nId. at ¶ 19.  UCARE’s mission is to advocate for and provide legal and social services to \nimmigrant and refugee minors, many of whom are or have been in ORR or Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement (“ICE”) custody.  Id.  To the extent that ORR implements any policies or \npractices that deny or delay the release of minors in the agency’s custody, such conduct denies or \ndelays  UCARE’s  member  organizations’  opportunity  to  serve  those  minors.    See  id.    The \nChildren Center’s and UCARE’s ability to raise funds depends in part on the raw number of \nchildren and youth to whom they provide services.  See id. at ¶¶ 18–19.  ORR has placed many \nminors in communities that the Children Center and UCARE serve (e.g., in federal fiscal year \n2018, ORR placed more than 1,100 alien minors in Los Angeles).  See id. at ¶ 20. \n \n                                                 \n1 The Court assumes the truth of the FAC’s allegations solely for the purpose of deciding Defendants’ \nMTD for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.  See infra Part II.A.  With regard to \nDefendant’s MTD for lack of venue, the Court presumes that the FAC’s averments are true to the extent they are not \ncontradicted by extrinsic evidence.  See id.  Lastly, the FAC’s averments may be considered in connection with \nPlaintiff’s Motion for Class Certification to the extent that they are supported by extrinsic evidence or are \nundisputed.  See infra Part III.B. \n \n2 The Court previously granted the Individual Plaintiffs leave to proceed in this matter under pseudonyms.  \nOrder re Ex Parte Application for Leave to Proceed Using Pseudonyms [Doc. # 92]. \n \n3 The TVPRA provides that HHS is responsible for the custody of all unaccompanied alien children.  See 8 \nU.S.C. § 1232(b)(1).  ORR is the division of HHS that has been entrusted with that responsibility.  See Saravia v. \nSessions, 280 F. Supp. 3d 1168, 1178 (N.D. Cal. 2017). \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 141   Filed 12/27/18   Page 3 of 28   Page ID #:4509\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741-DMG (PLAx)  Date  December 27, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v. Alex Azar, et al.  Page  3 of 28 \n   \n \n  Plaintiffs allege that ORR has adopted and implemented the following six policies and/or \npractices in violation the Flores Agreement, the TVPRA, the Due Process Clause, the Freedom \nof Association Clause, and/or Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act: \n \n(a)  ORR confines children in medium[-]secure facilities, residential treatment \ncenters  (“RTCs”),  and  secure  facilities  peremptorily,  often  on  bare \nallegations they are dangerous or pose a flight risk, without affording them \na  meaningful  opportunity  to  be  heard  regarding  the  reasons  for  such \nplacement; \n(b)  ORR prolongs children’s detention on the ground that their parents or \nother available custodians are or may be unfit, while affording neither \ndetained juveniles nor their proposed custodians a meaningful or timely \nopportunity to be heard regarding a proposed custodian’s fitness; \n(c)  ORR places children in [RTCs] and detention facilities in which it knows \nthey will be administered powerful psychotropic medications for weeks, \nmonths,  or  years,  without  procedural  safeguards,  including  seeking \ninformed parental consent or other lawful authorization, even from parents \npresent in the United States[;] \n(d)  ORR blocks lawyers from representing detained children with respect to \nplacement, non-consensual administration of psychotropic medications, or \nrelease to available custodians notwithstanding that Congress has allocated \nfunds specifically to provide such lawyers to represent children who are or \nhave been in ORR custody in “legal matters,” including issues related to \nrelease and [placement in the least-restrictive setting]; \n(e)  ORR segregates children who have or are perceived to have a behavioral, \nmental  health,  intellectual,  and/or  developmental  disability  in  secure \nfacilities,  medium[-]secure  facilities,  and  RTCs,  instead  of  the  most \nintegrated setting appropriate to their needs; and \n(f)  ORR[] prolong[s] the detention of children who have or are perceived to \nhave  a  behavioral,  mental  health,  intellectual,  and/or  developmental \ndisability  by  placing  them  in  restrictive  settings  associated  with \nheightened administrative barriers to release. \n \nSee id. at ¶¶ 4.a–e. \n \n  The FAC asserts five causes of action, which challenge ORR’s policies and/or practices \nconcerning the agency’s:  (1) determinations of potential custodians’ fitness; (2) placement of \nminors  in  RTCs,  secure  facilities,  and  medium-secure  facilities;  (3)  administration  of \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 141   Filed 12/27/18   Page 4 of 28   Page ID #:4510\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741-DMG (PLAx)  Date  December 27, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v.

See id. at 54–57.   \n \nII. \nLEGAL STANDARDS \n \nA.  Motion to Dismiss \n \n  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), a defendant may raise either a facial or a \nfactual challenge to a federal court’s subject matter jurisdiction.  White v. Lee, 227 F.3d 1214, \n1242 (9th Cir. 2000).  “In a facial attack, the challenger asserts that the allegations contained in a \ncomplaint are insufficient on their face to invoke federal jurisdiction.  By contrast, in a factual \nattack, the challenger disputes the truth of the allegations that, by themselves, would otherwise \ninvoke federal jurisdiction.”  Safe Air for Everyone v. Meyer, 373 F.3d 1035, 1039 (9th Cir. \n2004).  When resolving a facial attack, a court “presume[s] the truthfulness of the plaintiff’s \nallegations” and determines whether they establish that subject matter jurisdiction is proper.  See \nid.  Defendants raise a facial attack to the Children Center’s and UCARE’s Article III standing to \nbring suit.  See MTD at 10–14.4 \n \n  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3) allows a defendant to challenge a complaint for \nimproper venue.  In considering such a motion, “[the] pleadings need not be accepted as true, \nand facts outside the pleadings may be considered.”  Doe 1 v. AOL LLC, 552 F.3d 1077, 1081 \n(9th Cir. 2009).  Once venue is challenged, a plaintiff bears the burden of showing that venue is \nproper.  Piedmont Label Co. v. Sun Garden Packing Co., 598 F.2d 491, 496 (9th Cir. 1979).  If \nthe Court determines that venue is improper, it “shall dismiss, or if it be in the interest of justice, \ntransfer such case to any district or division in which it could have been brought.”  28 U.S.C. \n§ 1406(a); see also King v. Russell, 963 F.2d 1301, 1304–05 (9th Cir. 1992) (holding that the \ndecision to dismiss or transfer for improper venue is committed to the sound discretion of the \ndistrict court). \n \n  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a defendant may seek to dismiss a \ncomplaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  \nTo survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a complaint must articulate “enough facts to state a claim to \nrelief that is plausible on its face.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). \nAlthough a pleading need not contain “detailed factual allegations,” it must contain “more than \n                                                 \n4 All page references herein are to page numbers inserted by the CM/ECF system. \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 141   Filed 12/27/18   Page 5 of 28   Page ID #:4511\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741-DMG (PLAx)  Date  December 27, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v.

Page  5 of 28 \n   \n \nlabels and conclusions” or “a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.”  Id. at \n555.  “A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the \ncourt to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  In evaluating the sufficiency of a complaint, courts \nmust accept all factual allegations as true.  Id. (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555).  Legal \nconclusions, in contrast, are not entitled to the assumption of truth.  Id.   \n \nB.  Motion for Class Certification \n \n  A district court has broad discretion in making a class certification determination under \nRule 23.  Navellier v. Sletten, 262 F.3d 923, 941 (9th Cir. 2001); see also Reiter v. Sonotone \nCorp., 442 U.S. 330, 345 (1979) (district courts “have broad power and discretion vested in them \nby Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23”).  Nonetheless, a court must exercise its discretion “within the \nframework of Rule 23.”  Navellier, 262 F.3d at 941. \n   \nThe following prerequisites must be met before a court may certify a class under Rule 23: \n \n(1)  the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; \n(2)  there are questions of law or fact common to the class; \n(3)  the  claims  or  defenses  of  the  representative parties  are  typical  of  the \nclaims or defenses of the class; and \n(4)  the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of \nthe class. \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).   \n \n  In addition to Rule 23(a)’s prerequisites, a party moving for class certification must also \nsatisfy one of the criteria of Rule 23(b).  Rule 23(b)(2) authorizes certification if “the party \nopposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that \nfinal injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a \nwhole[.]” \n \n  “The party seeking class certification bears the burden of establishing that the proposed \nclass meets the requirements of Rule 23.”  Edwards v. First Am. Corp., 798 F.3d 1172, 1177 (9th \nCir. 2015).  Certification is properly granted only if “after a rigorous analysis[,]” the district \ncourt concludes that Rule 23’s requirements have been satisfied.

Plans \n& Trust Funds, 568 U.S. 455, 466 (2013)).     \n \nIII. \nDISCUSSION \n   \nA.  Defendants’ MTD \n \n  Defendants’ MTD raises the following arguments:  (1) the Children Center and UCARE \nlack Article III standing to bring suit; (2) the Court should dismiss or transfer this action on the \nbasis of improper venue; and (3) the FAC fails to state claims for relief under the Flores \nAgreement, the TVPRA, the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), the Due Process Clause, \nand Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  See MTD at 8, 23–30.  The Court addresses each of \nthese arguments in turn. \n \n1.  The Children Center’s and UCARE’s Article III Standing \n \n  “The three well-known ‘irreducible constitutional minim[a] of standing’ are injury-in-\nfact, causation, and redressability.”  Davidson v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., 889 F.3d 956, 967 (9th \nCir. 2018) (alteration in original) (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 \n(1992)).  “A plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that her injury-in-fact is ‘concrete, \nparticularized, and actual or imminent; fairly traceable to the challenged action; and redressable \nby a favorable ruling.’”  Id. (quoting Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms, 561 U.S. 139, 149 \n(2010)). \n \n  Defendants  argue  that  the  Children  Center’s  and  UCARE’s  alleged  injuries  are \nspeculative.  Specifically, they contend that the FAC “assumes that some child in ORR custody \nmay eventually use their services for which they may receive funds or for which they may have \nto provide extra treatment,” and that these two organizational Plaintiffs “suffer no injury from \nthe alleged delay” in the release of alien minors because the children “would eventually be \nserved  by  the  organization[s].”    See  MTD  at  12.    Consequently,  Defendants  contend  that \nPlaintiffs have failed to establish that ORR’s policies and/or practices have negatively impacted \nthe funding of these two organizations, which depends in part on the number of minors they \nserve.5  See id. at 12–14.  \n                                                 \n5 Defendants also suggest that the FAC fails to supply sufficient detail regarding “how these organizations \nraise their funds.”  See Reply re MTD at 8.  The Court rejects this argument because it is entirely plausible that the \nChildren Center’s and UCARE’s donors would be inclined to provide additional funding if these organizations were \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 141   Filed 12/27/18   Page 7 of 28   Page ID #:4513\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741-DMG (PLAx)  Date  December 27, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v. Alex Azar, et al.  Page  7 of 28 \n   \n \nThe  FAC  alleges  that  “ORR  has  placed  many  unaccompanied  children  in  the \ncommunities that the Children Center and UCARE serve” and “ORR placed more than 1,100 \nunaccompanied children in Los Angeles alone” in fiscal year 2018.  See FAC at ¶ 20.  Further, \nthe FAC alleges that UCARE serves “immigrant and refugee minors . . . [who] are or have been \nin ORR” custody, and that ORR denies or delays their release.  See id. at ¶ 19.  These allegations \nplausibly  demonstrate  that  ORR’s  conduct  interferes  with  UCARE’s  ability  to  serve \nundocumented minors who are or have been in the agency’s custody.  See Davidson, 889 F.3d at \n969–70 (holding that plausible allegations of future harm are sufficient to establish standing at \nthe pleading stage).  Further, Defendants’ argument entirely neglects one crucial fact—i.e., \ndelays  in  obtaining  funding  have  concrete  financial  consequences  for  UCARE.    See,  e.g., \nAppalachian Reg’l Healthcare v. Coventry Health & Life Ins. Co., 970 F. Supp. 2d 687, 696 \n(E.D. Ky. 2013) (concluding that a delay in payment gives rise to an injury-in-fact).  It follows \nthat UCARE has pled an injury-in-fact that is fairly traceable to ORR’s policies and/or practices \nthat deny or delay the release of alien minors, and redressable by an order enjoining such \nconduct.   \n \nAdditionally, the FAC avers that to accomplish its mission to provide comprehensive \nsocial services to refugee minors from Central America, the Children Center has been forced to \ndivert its limited resources to remedying the mental and physical trauma these minors have \nsuffered  as  a  result  of  their  prolonged  detention  and  forced  consumption  of  psychotropic \nmedication while in ORR’s custody.  See FAC at ¶¶ 17–18.  Plaintiffs claim that this diversion of \nresources has reduced the number of undocumented minors and youth the Children Center is able \nto assist, thereby inhibiting its ability to raise funds.  See id. at ¶ 18.  These assertions give rise to \nthe plausible inference that ORR’s policies and/or practices have caused the Children Center to \nsuffer an injury-in-fact that would be mitigated if the agency ceased its allegedly unlawful \nconduct.  See La Asociacion de Trabajadores de Lake Forest v. City of Lake Forest, 624 F.3d \n1083, 1088 (9th Cir. 2010) (“An organization suing on its own behalf can establish an injury \nwhen it suffered ‘both a diversion of resources and a frustration of its mission.’”) (quoting Fair \nHous. of Marin v. Combs, 285 F.3d 899, 902 (9th Cir. 2002))). \n \nIn sum, the Court concludes that the Children Center and UCARE have sufficiently pled \nArticle III standing.      \n   \n                                                                                                                                                             \nable to serve more alien minors.  See FAC at ¶¶ 18–19; Public Lands for the People, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 697 \nF.3d 1192, 1196 (9th Cir. 2012) (if there is a facial challenge to standing, a court must “accept all factual allegations \nof the complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party” (quoting Bernhardt v. \nCty. of L.A., 279 F.3d 862, 867 (9th Cir. 2002)).    \n \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 141   Filed 12/27/18   Page 8 of 28   Page ID #:4514\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741-DMG (PLAx)  Date  December 27, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v. Alex Azar, et al.  Page  8 of 28 \n   \n \n2.  Venue \n \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs have filed suit in an improper venue.  Under 28 U.S.C. \nsection 1391(e)(1), a civil action against an officer of a federal agency may be brought in any \njudicial district in which “(A) a defendant in the action resides, (B) a substantial part of the \nevents or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property that is the \nsubject of the action is situated, or (C) the plaintiff resides if no real property is involved in the \naction.”  For the purposes of this general venue statute, “an entity with the capacity to sue and be \nsued in its common name under applicable law, whether or not incorporated, shall be deemed to \nreside, . . . if a plaintiff, only in the judicial district in which it maintains its principal place of \nbusiness.”  See 28 U.S.C. § 1391(c)(2). \n \nIt is undisputed that the Children Center is a California corporation that has its principal \nplace of business in this district (i.e., in North Hills, California), FAC at ¶ 17, and that UCARE is \nan unincorporated entity that has its principal place of business in this district as well (i.e., in Los \nAngeles, California, id. at ¶ 19.6  Because several (but not all) Plaintiffs reside in this district, \nvenue is proper under 28 U.S.C. section 1391(e)(1)(C).  See Immigrant Assistance Project of \nL.A. Cty. v. Immigration & Naturalization Serv., 306 F.3d 842, 868 (9th Cir. 2002) (“A civil \naction . . . in which a defendant is an agency of the United States and in which no real property is \ninvolved,  may  be  brought,  inter  alia,  in  any  judicial  district  in  which  a  plaintiff  resides.”  \n(emphasis added)); Railway Labor Executives Ass’n v. Interstate Commerce Comm’n, 958 F.2d \n252, 256 (9th Cir. 1991) (holding that “venue need be proper for only one plaintiff” under \nSection 1391(e)). \n \nDefendants nonetheless insist that venue is improper because the Children Center and \nUCARE are not members of the putative classes (i.e., children in ORR custody).7  See MTD at \n10, 17, 20 n.3.  Yet, the Court has already concluded that these two Plaintiffs have Article III \nstanding to raise their claims.  See supra Part III.A.1.  Furthermore, the Children Center and \nUCARE are properly joined in this action because all named Plaintiffs challenge the same \npolicies and practices.  See FAC at ¶¶ 4–5, 17–20; see also Immigrant Assistance Project, 306 \n                                                 \n6 The parties do not dispute that the Children Center and UCARE have the capacity to bring suit under \napplicable law. \n \n7 Plaintiffs argue that the Children Center and UCARE may serve as class representatives because “the \nchildren and the youth they serve are the functional equivalent of their members.”  See Reply re Mot. for Class Cert. \nat 18–19.  This assertion is puzzling, given that the Children Center is a non-profit corporation that presumably does \nnot have any “members,” and UCARE’s members are non-profit agencies.  See FAC at ¶¶ 17–19.  The Court need \nnot resolve this issue because it concludes that the Individual Plaintiffs can serve as class representatives.  See infra \nPart III.B.3–4. \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 141   Filed 12/27/18   Page 9 of 28   Page ID #:4515\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741-DMG (PLAx)  Date  December 27, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v. Alex Azar, et al.  Page  9 of 28 \n   \n \nF.3d 842, 867–68 & n.20 (venue is proper under Section 1391(e) if either a putative class \nrepresentative or an organization resided in the district); Fed. R. Civ. P. 20(a)(1) (“Persons may \njoin in one action as plaintiffs if: . . . they assert any right to relief jointly, severally, or in the \nalternative  with  respect  to  or  arising  out  of  the  same  transaction,  occurrence,  or  series  of \ntransactions or occurrences; and . . . any question of law or fact common to all plaintiffs will \narise in the action.”).  Therefore, the Court shall not dismiss this action for improper venue.8 \n \n3.  Claims Under the Flores Agreement  \n \nDefendants  argue  that  the  Court  should  dismiss  as  duplicative  any  claims  alleging \nviolations of the Flores Agreement.  See MTD at 24–25.  Plaintiffs counter that they are not \nrequired to litigate their Flores claims in that action because Paragraph 37 of the Agreement \npurportedly permits them to file an independent “individual or class action” in this District \nCourt.  See Opp’n re MTD at 27–28.  Plaintiffs fail to recognize that the interests of judicial \neconomy counsel against permitting them to enforce the Flores Agreement in this action.  \n \n“Plaintiffs generally have ‘no right to maintain two separate actions involving the same \nsubject matter at the same time in the same court and against the same defendant.”  Adams v. \nCal. Dep’t of Health Servs., 487 F.3d 684, 688 (9th Cir. 2007), overruled in part on another \nground by Taylor v Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, 884–85, 904 (2008).  This prohibition on duplicative \nactions also extends to plaintiffs who are in privity with parties to the first suit.  See id. at 689.  \nGenerally, “[d]ismissal of the duplicative lawsuit, more so than the issuance of a stay or the \nenjoinment of proceedings, promotes judicial economy and the ‘comprehensive disposition of \nlitigation.’”  See id. at 693 (quoting Kerotest Mfg. Co. v. C-O-Two Fore Equip. Co., 342 U.S. \n180, 183 (1952)).  Whether the dismissal is with or without prejudice is committed to the district \ncourt’s sound discretion.  Id. at 692.   \n \n                                                 \n8 The Court need not address Defendants’ motion to transfer this action because it is predicated on their \nclaim that this district is an improper venue.  See MTD at 20–23.  To the extent Defendants contend that the action \nought to be transferred to the District of Columbia pursuant to 28 U.S.C. section 1404(a), that argument fails \nbecause they do not provide any evidentiary support for the only factor they claim weighs in favor of transfer—i.e., \nthe convenience of the witnesses and location of books and records.  See MTD at 22; see also E. & J. Gallo Winery \nv. F. & P. S.p.A., 899 F. Supp. 465, 466 (E.D. Cal. 1994) (holding that the proponent of the transfer “bears a heavy \nburden of showing a clear balance of inconveniences to it[,]” and that “[a]ffidavits or declarations are required to \nidentify key witnesses and [provide] a generalized statement of their anticipated testimony”).  \n \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 141   Filed 12/27/18   Page 10 of 28   Page ID\n #:4516\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741-DMG (PLAx)  Date  December 27, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v. Alex Azar, et al.  Page  10 of 28 \n   \n \nIt is undisputed that the Individual Plaintiffs are members of the Flores Class, and that \nORR  is  a  party  to  that  action.9    See  FAC  at  ¶¶  2–3,  21–22;  Taylor,  553  U.S.  at  894 \n(“Representative suits with preclusive effect on nonparties include properly conducted class \nactions . . . .”).  There is also no dispute that the subject matter of Plaintiffs’ Flores claims and \nthe Flores Action are the same.  In their original Complaint, Plaintiffs admitted that the instant \naction is an “adjunct and supplement” to a motion to enforce that was filed in the Flores Action.  \nSee Compl. at ¶ 2 [Doc. # 1].  In resolving that motion, the Court found that ORR breached the \nFlores Agreement by:  (1) detaining certain Class Members in Shiloh RTC in violation of \nParagraphs 6, 7, 8, and 19 and Exhibit 1 of the Agreement, (2) failing to timely provide a written \nnotice of reasons for placing a Class Member in a secure facility, staff-secure facility, or RTC in \nviolation of Paragraph 24C of the Agreement, (3) placing certain Class Members in secure \nfacilities  in  violation  of  Paragraph  21  of  the  Agreement,  (4)  administering  psychotropic \nmedication to Class Members at Shiloh RTC in violation of Paragraphs 6 and 9 and Exhibit 1 of \nthe Agreement, and (5) undertaking certain policies that unnecessarily delay the release of Class \nMembers to custodians in violation of Paragraphs 14 and 18 of the Agreement.  See Order re \nPls.’ Mot. to Enforce at 30–32, Flores v. Sessions, No. CV 85-4544-DMG (AGRx) (C.D. Cal. \nJuly 30, 2018) [Doc. # 470].  Further, the parties in Flores continue to actively litigate whether \nORR,  ICE,  and  U.S.  Customs  and  Border  Patrol  have  complied  with  the  Agreement, \nnotwithstanding the fact that the Court issued the consent decree more than 20 years ago.  See, \ne.g., Order Appointing Special Master/Independent Monitor, Flores v. Sessions, No. CV 85-\n4544-DMG (AGRx) (C.D. Cal. Oct. 5, 2018) [Doc. # 494]. \n \nBecause Plaintiffs’ claims under the Flores Agreement should be litigated only in that \naction, the Court DISMISSES without prejudice Plaintiffs’ first, second, third, and fourth causes \nof action to the extent that they seek enforcement of that Agreement.  Nonetheless, Plaintiffs \nmay pursue due process claims predicated on Defendants’ failure to provide sufficient procedural \n                                                 \n9 Although the Children Center and UCARE are not parties to the Flores Action, they are subject to the \nsame defenses as the Individual Plaintiffs because the Children Center and UCARE seek to assert the contractual \nrights of Flores Class Members.  See Ronay Family Ltd. P’ship v. Tweed, 216 Cal. App. 4th 830, 840 (2013) (“[A] \nthird party whose rights under a contract derive from those of a party to the contract [typically] cannot assert rights \ngreater than those of the contracting party . . . .”); O’Neil v. Bunge Corp., 365 F.3d 820, 822 (9th Cir. 2004) (“[T]he \nconstruction and enforcement of settlement agreements are governed by principles of local law which apply to \ninterpretation of contracts generally.” (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting United Commercial Ins. Serv., \nInc. v. Paymaster Corp., 962 F.2d 853, 856 (9th Cir. 1992))).  In addition, while Defendant E. Scott Lloyd has not \nbeen sued in his individual capacity in the Flores Action, the only claim Plaintiffs bring against him in his personal \ncapacity is one under Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), \nsee FAC at ¶ 5, which authorizes damages claims for only constitutional violations (i.e., not breaches of consent \ndecrees), see F.E. Trotter, Inc. v. Watkins, 869 F.2d 1312, 1314 (9th Cir. 1989) (holding that Bivens claims are \navailable “[f]or certain constitutional violations”).  The claim against Lloyd is therefore not subsumed within the \nFlores Action.   \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 141   Filed 12/27/18   Page 11 of 28   Page ID\n #:4517\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741-DMG (PLAx)  Date  December 27, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v.

Citibank, N.A., 226 F.3d 133, 139 (2d Cir. 2000))).         \n \n4.  Plaintiffs’ TVPRA and APA Claims \n \n  Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ claims under the TVPRA fail because they have not \nshown that the statute creates a private right of action.  See MTD at 25.  Relatedly, Defendants \ncontend that Plaintiffs may not obtain a remedy under the APA because the FAC does not \nsufficiently allege the existence of a relevant “final agency action.”11  See id. at 28–29; Reply re \nMTD at 17; see also 5 U.S.C. § 704 (“Agency action made reviewable by statute and final \nagency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court are subject to judicial \nreview.”).

See Opp’n re Mot. for Class Cert. at 11 (asserting that the instant \naction is a “successive, identical class action” that includes “class members and claims identical in scope to an \nearlier certified class action” (emphasis added)).  Yet, the Court specifically declared that the only claims that may \nbe brought in the Flores Action are those arising under the Agreement.  See Order re Pls.’ Mot. to Enforce at 2–3, 5–\n6, Flores v. Sessions, No. CV 85-4544-DMG (AGRx) (C.D. Cal. July 30, 2018) [Doc. # 470].  To the extent that \nDefendants intended to assert a res judicata defense, the Court rejects that argument because they failed to cogently \nraise or brief that point.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 7(b)(1)(B) (“A request for a court order must be made by motion.  The \nmotion must: . . . state with particularity the grounds for seeking the order.”).      \n \n11 Although Plaintiffs’ first four causes of action assert that Defendants’ policies violate the APA, the FAC \ndoes not clarify whether Plaintiffs intend to raise any standalone APA claims that are not predicated on violations of \nother federal statutes, the federal constitution, or the Flores Agreement.  See FAC at ¶¶ 181, 184, 187, 190; see also \nOpp’n re MTD 30–31 (asserting in passing that “ORR’s challenged policies and practices are final and directly \nviolate the APA[,]” but failing to articulate a standalone APA claim).  Accordingly, the Court will limit its inquiry to \nwhether the FAC satisfies the procedural prerequisites to suit under the APA.  See also Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static \nControl Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 131 (2014) (noting that the APA has an “omnibus judicial-review \nprovision, which permits suit for violations of numerous statutes of varying character that do not themselves include \ncauses of action for judicial review”). \n \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 141   Filed 12/27/18   Page 12 of 28   Page ID\n #:4518\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741-DMG (PLAx)  Date  December 27, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v.

And second, the action must be one by which “rights or \nobligations have been determined,” or from which “legal consequences will flow.”’”  Western \nRadio Servs. Co. v. Glickman, 123 F.3d 1189, 1196 (9th Cir. 1997) (quoting Bennet v. Spear, \n520 U.S. 154, 178 (1997)).    \n \nThe FAC identifies several ORR policies and/or practices, which concern (inter alia) the \nplacement  of  undocumented  minors;  their  release  to  proposed  custodians;  the  forced \nconsumption of psychotropic medication; and blocking lawyers from representing minors in \nconnection  with  ORR’s  decisions  regarding  release,  placement,  and  non-consensual \nadministration of psychotropic medications.  See FAC at ¶¶ 4.a–d.  The FAC includes specific \nfactual  allegations  demonstrating  that  these  policies  and/or  practices  are  not  tentative  or \ninterlocutory in nature, as ORR has already implemented them.13  See, e.g., id. at ¶¶ 37–46 \n(alleging that ORR placed Daniela Marisol T. in Shiloh RTC without notice or an opportunity to \nbe heard, refused to release her to a custodian or provide any administrative means to challenge \nthat decision, and required her to take psychotropic medications without court or family member \n                                                 \n12 The FAC avers that “Plaintiffs have private rights of action against Defendants pursuant to . . . the \nAdministrative Procedure Act,” but it does not allege a cause of action under the TVPRA itself.  See FAC at ¶ 9.  \nYet, Plaintiffs’ Opposition to the MTD apparently argues that an implied private right of action exists under the \nTVPRA.  See Opp’n re MTD at 29.  Although Plaintiffs argue (inter alia) that “[n]othing in the enactment’s text or \nlegislative history suggests” that an implied private right of action would frustrate the underlying purpose of the \nTVPRA, they fail to cite any legislative materials in support of that proposition.  See id.  Notwithstanding Plaintiffs’ \nfailure to adequately show that the TVPRA creates a private right of action, the Court finds that, for the reasons \ndiscussed in this section, the APA still permits them to seek relief for violations of the TVPRA.  See 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A) (providing that a court shall set aside agency action found to be “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, otherwise not in accordance with law”).  Additionally, for the reasons discussed in this section, Plaintiffs \nmay assert their constitutional claims under the APA as well.  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B) (providing that a court shall \nset aside agency action found to be “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity”); Navajo Nation \nv. Dep’t of Interior, 876 F.3d 1144, 1168–72 (9th Cir. 2017) (holding that 5 U.S.C. section 704’s “final agency \naction” requirement applies to causes of action brought under the APA, whereas it is not a condition of 5 U.S.C. \nsection 702’s waiver of sovereign immunity). \n \n13 The Court is not persuaded by Defendants’ contention that these allegations are not sufficiently detailed \nto survive a motion to dismiss.  See Reply re MTD at 17; Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (“[T]he pleading standard Rule 8 \nannounces does not require ‘detailed factual allegations,’ but it demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-\nunlawfully-harmed-me accusation.”  (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555)).   \n \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 141   Filed 12/27/18   Page 13 of 28   Page ID\n #:4519\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741-DMG (PLAx)  Date  December 27, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v.

Moreover, the FAC avers that these \npolicies and/or practices violate Individual Plaintiffs’ and putative class members’ rights under \nthe TVPRA, the Due Process Clause, and the Freedom of Association Clause of the First \nAmendment.  See id. at ¶¶ 2–3.  Aside from their unpersuasive arguments that Plaintiffs did not \nadequately plead their procedural due process claims, see infra Part III.A.5, Defendants fail to \neven argue that such legal consequences do not flow from ORR’s conduct.  See Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 7(b)(1)(B).  The Court thus rejects Defendants’ contention that no private right of action exists \nby which Plaintiffs may obtain relief for ORR’s violations of the TVPRA.  Cf. L.V.M. v. Lloyd, \n318 F. Supp. 3d 601, 612 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (holding that ORR’s policy of requiring director-level \nreview before certain alien minors are released from custody was final agency action for the \npurposes of the APA because ORR had already adopted the policy and legal consequences \nflowed from it).     \n      \n5.  Plaintiffs’ Procedural Due Process Theories \n \n  Defendants contend that Plaintiffs’ procedural due process claims should be dismissed \nbecause:  (1) the FAC supposedly fails to identify any underlying substantive rights protected by \nthe  Due  Process  Clause,  and  (2)  undocumented  minors  are  not  entitled  to  any  procedural \nprotections  beyond  those  explicitly  provided  by  Congress.14    See  MTD  at  25–28.    These \ncontentions are entirely without merit. \n \n  “[P]rocedural due process . . . has three elements:  (1) a liberty or property interest \nprotected by the Constitution; (2) a deprivation of the interest by the government; (3) lack of \nprocess.”  Portman v. Cty. of Santa Clara, 995 F.2d 898, 904 (9th Cir. 1993).  A constitutionally \nprotected substantive interest may arise from the federal constitution itself, see Zadvydas v. \nDavis, 533 U.S. 678, 690 (2001), a statute, see Carver v. Lehman, 558 F.3d 869, 874–75 (9th \nCir. 2009), or a contract, see San Bernardino Physicians’ Servs. Med. Grp. v. Cty. of San \nBernardino, 825 F.2d 1404, 1407–08 (9th Cir. 1987); see also Smith v. Sumner, 994 F.2d 1401, \n1406 (9th Cir. 1993) (a consent decree can give rise to a constitutionally protected interest).  A \nstatute  may  create  a  substantive  interest  protected  by  the  Due  Process  Clause  by  using \n                                                 \n14 Although Defendants’ MTD discusses certain legal principles relating to the substantive component of \nthe Due Process Clause, it appears that Defendants challenge only Plaintiffs’ procedural due process claims.  See \nMTD at 25–26 (“The failure to plead a substantive right is fatal to the various procedural due process claims.”); \nReply re MTD at 18 (“Plaintiffs do not cite any legal authority to support their conclusory arguments that children in \nORR custody are entitled to constitutional procedural protections concerning their placement in licensed facilities \nand the prescription of psychotropic drugs.”). \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 141   Filed 12/27/18   Page 14 of 28   Page ID\n #:4520\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741-DMG (PLAx)  Date  December 27, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v.

Further, whether a contractual right is protected by the Due Process Clause depends \nupon “the security with which [the interest] is held under [the applicable] law and its importance \nto the holder.”  See San Bernardino Physicians’ Servs., 825 F.3d at 1409 (alteration in original) \n(quoting Brown v. Brienen, 722 F.2d 360, 364 (7th Cir. 1983)).  A contractual provision may be \nof sufficient importance if it can be “easily characterized as a civil right.”  See id. \n \n  Here, the FAC alleges that ORR’s policies and/or practices violate detained minors’ \nconstitutional rights to freedom from detention, familial association, and bodily integrity.  See \nFAC at ¶¶ 106–08, 116, 122–23, 137, 142; see also Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 690 (“Freedom from \nimprisonment—from government custody, detention, or other forms of physical restraint—lies at \nthe heart of the liberty [the Due Process] Clause protects.”); Rosenbaum v. Washoe Cty., 663 \nF.3d 1071, 1079 (9th Cir. 2011) (“The substantive due process right to family integrity or to \nfamilial association is well established.”); cf. United States v. Loughner, 672 F.3d 731, 744 (9th \nCir.  2012)  (“[I]nmates  possess  ‘a  significant  liberty  interest  in  avoiding  the  unwanted \nadministration of antipsychotic drugs under the Due Process Clause . . . .’” (quoting Washington \nv. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 221–22 (1980))).   \n \nPlaintiffs further allege that ORR’s refusal to promptly release undocumented minors; its \nplacement of children in secure facilities, medium-secure facilities, and RTCs; its decision to \ninvoluntarily medicate minors; and its interference with minors’ access to counsel violate the \nagency’s obligations under the TVPRA.  See FAC at ¶¶ 104, 108, 118–121, 133, 140–42, 146–\n52.  The provisions of the TVPRA upon  which Plaintiffs rely use mandatory language to \nprescribe the agency’s duties.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(2)(A) (“[A]n unaccompanied alien child in \nthe custody of [ORR] shall be promptly placed in the least restrictive setting that is in the best \ninterest of the child. . . .  A child shall not be placed in a secure facility absent a determination \nthat the child poses a danger to self or others or otherwise has been charged with having \ncommitted a criminal offense.” (emphasis added)); id. § 1232(c)(5) (“[ORR] . . . shall ensure . . . \nthat all unaccompanied alien children [from non-contiguous countries] have counsel to represent \nthem in legal proceedings or matters and to protect them from mistreatment, exploitation, and \ntrafficking.” (emphasis added)).   \n \nFurthermore, the FAC relies upon provisions of the Flores Agreement that require the \nprompt release of alien minors to proposed custodians, the placement of children in non-secure \nlicensed facilities, and adherence to all applicable state child welfare laws and regulations.  See \nFAC at ¶¶ 103, 117, 132, 134; Flores Agreement at ¶¶ 6, 14, 18–19, Ex. 1 at ¶ A.  These \nprotections are secured by a consent decree and constitute civil rights because they are akin to \nthe constitutional and statutory rights discussed above.  See Smith, 994 F.2d at 1406 (“‘[I]t would \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 141   Filed 12/27/18   Page 15 of 28   Page ID\n #:4521\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741-DMG (PLAx)  Date  December 27, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v.

Ventetuolo, 941 F.2d 22, 28 (1st Cir. 1991))).  Therefore, the Court concludes \nthat Plaintiffs have satisfactorily identified the substantive rights underlying their procedural due \nprocess claims. \n \n  Defendants’ second argument is inapt because it relies upon cases involving procedures \nfor the admission or exclusion of aliens.  See Shaughnessy v. United states ex re. Mezei, 345 U.S. \n206, 212 (1953) (“It is true that aliens who have once passed through our gates, even illegally, \nmay  be  expelled  only  after  proceedings  conforming  to  traditional  standards  of  fairness \nencompassed in due process of law.  But an alien on the threshold of initial entry stands on a \ndifferent footing:  ‘Whatever the procedure authorized by Congress is, it is due process as far as \nan alien denied entry is concerned.’” (citations omitted) (quoting United States ex rel. Knauff v. \nShaughnessy, 338 U.S. 537, 544 (1950))); Angov v. Lynch, 788 F.3d 893, 898 (9th Cir. 2015) \n(“[The alien] has no . . . right [to procedural due process].  He presented himself at the San \nYsidro port of entry without valid entry documents and sought asylum. . . . [T]hose, like [the \nalien], who have never technically ‘entered’ the United States have no such rights.” (emphasis \nadded)); United States v. Barajas-Alvarado, 655 F.3d 1077, 1084 (9th Cir. 2011) (“We have . . . \nheld that non-admitted aliens are not entitled to any procedure vis-á-vis their admission or \nexclusion.” (emphasis added)).  Because these decisions relate to the admission or exclusion of \naliens, they do not establish that the children in ORR’s custody have no entitlement to additional \nprocedures that limit the agency’s authority to detain them, place them in certain restrictive \nsettings, administer psychotropic medication to them against their will, or block their access to \ncounsel.  See, e.g., Hernandez v. Sessions, 872 F.3d 976, 990 n.17 (9th Cir. 2017) (“Although the \nSupreme Court has described Congress’s power over the ‘policies and rules for exclusion of \naliens’ as ‘plenary,’ . . . it is well-established that the Due Process Clause stands as a significant \nconstraint on the manner in which the political branches may exercise their plenary authority.” \n(quoting  Kleindienst  v.  Mandel,  408  U.S.  753,  769  (1972))).    In  sum,  the  Court  rejects \nDefendants’ challenges to Plaintiffs’ procedural due process claims.15 \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n15 Defendants argue for the first time in their reply brief that Plaintiffs fail to adequately “describe what \nprocedures they think the Constitution actually requires.”  See Reply re MTD at 18.  The Court will not consider this \nargument because Defendants failed to timely raise it.  See Zamani v. Carnes, 491 F.3d 990, 997 (9th Cir. 2007) \n(“The district court need not consider arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief.”). \n \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 141   Filed 12/27/18   Page 16 of 28   Page ID\n #:4522\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741-DMG (PLAx)  Date  December 27, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v. Alex Azar, et al.  Page  16 of 28 \n   \n \n6.  Claims Under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act \n \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act provides in pertinent part that “[n]o otherwise \nqualified individual with a disability in the United States . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his \ndisability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance . . . .”  See 29 \nU.S.C. § 794(a).  Defendants contend that Plaintiffs’ Section 504 claims should be dismissed \nbecause the FAC does not “identify facts that suggest ORR was motivated to take the actions \nchallenged here ‘solely by reason’ of [their] alleged disabilities.”  See MTD at 29–30.  Once \nagain, Defendants’ assertion is flatly contradicted by the FAC’s allegations. \n \nThe FAC avers that ORR placed all but one of the Individual Plaintiffs (i.e., Jamie D.) in \nShiloh RTC “due to” their mental health needs.  See FAC at ¶¶ 31, 41, 48, 64, 81, 90.  In fact, \nDefendants admit that the agency transfers alien minors to RTCs “in order to treat intensive \npsychiatric and psychological needs.”  See Reply re MTD at 19.  Benjamin F.’s experience \nillustrates the effects of this alleged policy and/or practice.  The FAC claims that ORR initially \nplaced Benjamin F. and his brother, Mateo, in the same shelter facility.  See FAC at ¶¶ 86, 88.  \nORR  later  placed  Benjamin  F.  in  Shiloh  RTC  because  of  his  autism  and  developmental \ndisabilities.  See id. at ¶¶ 87, 90.  Shortly after the transfer, Mateo was released from the \nagency’s custody, but Benjamin remained at Shiloh RTC, presumably because medical personnel \nhad  not  yet  “declare[d]  him  psychologically  sound  .  .  .  .”    See  id.  at  91,  93–94.    These \nasseverations plausibly state a claim that ORR has taken action against alien minors “solely by \nreason of” their disabilities.16   \n \nB.  Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification \n \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2), Plaintiffs move to certify \nfive proposed classes that are comprised of all minors in ORR custody pursuant to 6 U.S.C. \nsection 279 and/or 8 U.S.C. section 1232: \n \n                                                 \n16 Defendants also suggest that “merely placing a minor in [an RTC] for children with intensive mental \nhealth needs [does not] violate[] the Rehabilitation Act . . . .”  See Reply re MTD at 18.  Yet, the FAC alleges that \nchildren placed in RTCs are denied benefits offered to other undocumented minors in ORR custody.  See, e.g., FAC \nat ¶ 130 (“[C]hildren placed in RTCs suffer the functional equivalent of indefinite civil commitment without due \nprocess  of  law.”).    Accordingly,  Plaintiffs  have  adequately  pled  a  violation  of  the  Rehabilitation  Act, \nnotwithstanding the fact that Defendants apparently disagree with their factual assertions.  See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 \n(“When there are well-pleaded factual allegations, a court should assume their veracity and then determine whether \nthey plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.”).   \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 141   Filed 12/27/18   Page 17 of 28   Page ID\n #:4523\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741-DMG (PLAx)  Date  December 27, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v.

See  Mot.  for  Class  Cert.  at  11–12.  \nFurthermore, the Individual Plaintiffs offer evidence indicating that they have been subjected to \nsuch policies and/or practices.  See infra Part III.B.2–3.

Page  18 of 28 \n   \n \nof Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification, the Court assumes the existence of the policies \nand/or  practices  giving  rise  to  the  claims  underlying  the  proposed  classes.    See  Stichting \nPensioenfonds ABP v. Countrywide Fin. Corp., 802 F. Supp. 2d 1125, 1132 (C.D. Cal. 2011) \n(“[I]n most circumstances, failure to respond in an opposition brief to an argument put forward in \nan opening brief constitutes waiver or abandonment in regard to the uncontested issue.”).  With \nthat  assumption  in  mind,  the  Court  will  determine  whether  Plaintiffs  have  satisfied  the \nprerequisites of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. \n \n1.  Rule 23(a)(1):  Numerosity \n \nA putative class may be certified only if it “is so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).  The numerosity requirement imposes no absolute \nlimitations; rather, it “requires examination of the specific facts of each case.”  Gen. Tel. Co. of \nthe Nw. v. EEOC, 446 U.S. 318, 330 (1980).  “The Ninth Circuit has not offered a precise \nnumerical  standard;  other  District  Courts  have,  however,  enacted  presumptions  that  the \nnumerosity requirement is satisfied by a showing of 25–30 members.”  Slaven v. BP Am., Inc., \n190 F.R.D. 649, 654 (C.D. Cal. 2000).  “In analyzing numerosity ‘a court may make common-\nsense assumptions and reasonable inferences.’”  West v. Cal.

Cal. 2016)). \n \nORR’s data shows that in fiscal year 2017, the agency admitted 873 minors to RTCs, \nsecure facilities, or staff-secure facilities.18  See Mot. for Class Cert., Ex. 3 at ¶ 10 (Revised \n                                                                                                                                                             \nCert. at 28.  For the reasons discussed infra Part III.B.2–3, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have advanced \nsufficient evidence that ORR routinely blocks detained minors from obtaining legal services to challenge the \nagency’s decisions regarding placement, release, and/or administration of psychotropic medication. \n \nDefendants further claim that Section 1.4.7 of the ORR Guide permits a minor to ask the ORR Director or \nhis designee to reconsider the minor’s transfer to a secure facility or RTC within 30 days after placement, and they \nnote that the TVPRA requires the agency to conduct monthly reviews of the placement of a minor in a secure \nfacility.  See Opp’n re Mot. for Class Cert. at 20–21 (citing ORR Guide § 1.4.7; 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(2)(A)).  \nNonetheless, Section 1.4.7 is no longer available in the online version of the ORR Guide, and Defendants have not \noffered a declaration showing that the provision still exists.

More importantly, Defendants do not offer evidence that ORR affords minors placed in \nsuch facilities with notice of the reasons for the transfer, nor do they contend that the aforementioned procedures call \nfor review by a neutral and detached decisionmaker.  See Opp’n re Mot. for Class Cert. at 20–21.   \n \n18 ORR previously admitted that staff-secure facilities are “medium-security facilities” under the Flores \nAgreement.

Since the Court assumes for the purposes of Plaintiffs’ Motion that \nORR consistently fails to provide notice and an opportunity to be heard before a neutral and \ndetached decisionmaker in connection with such transfers, the Court concludes that the size of \nthe step-up class is large enough to render joinder impracticable. \n \nNext, Plaintiffs argue that ORR “routinely” delays or denies the release of minors to their \nproposed custodians on the grounds that they are unsuitable, see Mot. for Class Cert. at 25, an \nuncontested assertion that is consistent with the evidence discussed infra Part III.B.3.  Given that \n50,834 minors were admitted into ORR custody in fiscal year 2017 alone, common sense dictates \nthat a sizeable number of minors sought or will seek release to proposed custodians and were or \nwill  be  subjected  to  ORR’s  purportedly  inadequate  procedures  for  contesting  the  agency’s \nsuitability determinations. \n \nFurther, ORR’s data shows that 74 minors were admitted to RTCs in fiscal year 2017.  \nSee Mot. for Class Cert., Ex. 3 at ¶ 10 (Revised Sualog Decl.) [Doc. # 97-6].  Because ORR’s \nstatistical  reports  show  that  it  “administers  psychotropic  medications  to  .  .  .  nearly  every \nchild . . . it places” in its RTCs, the drug administration class is sufficiently numerous to satisfy \nRule 23(a)(1).

(ORR has confined \nMiguel Angel S. to Yolo Juvenile Detention Center, where he has been instructed to take \nmedication for depression and anxiety) [Doc. # 105-1].  Defendants admit that alien minors are \nplaced in RTCs if ORR determines that they “require intensive mental health services which \ncannot be provided on an outpatient basis,” see Opp’n re Mot. for Class Cert. at 20, a concession \nthat signifies that joinder of the members of the disability class would also be impracticable. \n \nLastly, Plaintiffs accurately note that the legal representation class is comprised of the \nstep-up, unfit custodian, and drug administration classes because ORR has allegedly, as a matter \nof common practice, discouraged legal services providers from assisting undocumented minors \nin challenging those decisions.  See Mot. for Class Cert. at 26.  Thus, it stands to reason that the \nlegal representation class comports with Rule 23(a)(1) as well.            \n \n2.  Rule 23(a)(2):  Commonality \n \nThe commonality requirement is satisfied if “there are questions of law or fact common \nto the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).  “Commonality requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that \n                                                                                                                                                             \n30, 2018) [Doc. # 470].

Alex Azar, et al.  Page  20 of 28 \n   \n \nthe class members ‘have suffered the same injury.’”  Dukes, 564 U.S. at 349–50 (quoting Gen. \nTele. of S.W. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157(1982)).  In determining that a common question of \nlaw exists, it is insufficient to find that all putative class members have suffered a violation of the \nsame provision of law.  See id. at 350.  Rather, the putative class members’ claims “must depend \nupon a common contention” that is “of such a nature that it is capable of classwide resolution—\nwhich means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the \nvalidity of each one of the claims in one stroke.”  See id. \n \nAs noted above, Defendants do not dispute that ORR has instituted a policy and/or \npractice of transferring minors to secure facilities, medium-secure facilities, and RTCs without \nbeing  afforded  notice  and  an  opportunity  to  be  heard  before  a  neutral  and  detached \ndecisionmaker.  They also do not contest that ORR consistently fails to provide parents and other \nproposed custodians with any formal means by which to challenge the agency’s suitability \ndeterminations, or that ORR routinely administers psychotropic drugs to minors without first \nobtaining informed consent or court authorization.  They likewise do not challenge Plaintiffs’ \nassertion that ORR had adopted a policy and/or practice of placing children with actual or \nperceived behavioral, mental health, intellectual, and/or developmental disabilities in secure \nfacilities, medium-secure facilities, and RTCs.  It follows that whether such policies and/or \npractices violate the Due Process Clause, the Freedom of Association Clause, the TVPRA, \nand/or the Rehabilitation Act are common questions for all putative members of the step-up \nclass, the unfit custodian class, the drug administration class, and the disability class.19 \n \nDefendants nonetheless insist that the step-up, unfit custodian, drug administration, and \ndisability classes do not present common questions because “there is wide variation in the \nevidence that ORR may rely on in informing its placement, release, and treatment decisions.”  \nSee Opp’n re Mot. for Class Cert. at 19.  Defendants misapprehend the nature of Plaintiffs’ \nclaims.  Plaintiffs seek an injunction barring Defendants from engaging in the aforementioned \npolicies and/or practices in the absence of certain procedural safeguards.  See, e.g., FAC at 57–\n58.  Plaintiffs do not request an order requiring Defendants to transfer particular putative class \nmembers to less restrictive settings, release them to proposed custodians, cease medicating them, \n                                                 \n19 Defendants point out that Plaintiffs’ Flores claims relating to the administration of psychotropic drugs \nare governed by the child welfare laws of each state in which a particular putative class member is detained.  See \nOpp’n re Mot. for Class Cert. at 24–25; Order re Pls.’ Mot. to Enforce at 20–24, Flores v. Sessions, No. CV 85-\n4544-DMG (AGRx) (C.D. Cal. July 30, 2018) [Doc. # 470].  The parties have not addressed whether the differences \nin the various applicable state child welfare laws would affect the extent to which Plaintiffs’ due process claims \nraise common questions.  Should that issue arise, the Court may alter or amend its class certification order to further \ndivide the drug administration class into appropriate subclasses.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(C).  Until then, the \nCourt will not address the issue sua sponte or presume that potential differences in state child welfare laws prevent \nPlaintiffs’ federal due process claims from presenting common questions of law and fact.  \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 141   Filed 12/27/18   Page 21 of 28   Page ID\n #:4527\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741-DMG (PLAx)  Date  December 27, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v.

That inquiry does not require us to \ndetermine the effect of those policies and practices upon any individual class member (or class \nmembers) or to undertake any other kind of individualized determination.”).    \n \nPlaintiffs also offer evidence indicating that ORR has instructed legal aid programs not to \nrepresent  minors  in  connection  with  ORR’s  placement,  medication,  and  release  decisions.  \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs point to evidence that HHS has contracted with the Vera Institute of \nJustice for the purposes of providing legal services to undocumented minors.  See Mot. for Class \nCert, Ex. 5 (HHS’s contracts with Vera) [Doc. ## 97-8, 97-9].  They also offer declarations from \nattorneys  who  worked  for  Vera-funded  legal  aid  programs,  wherein  they  claim  that  ORR \ninstructed those programs not to challenge ORR’s confinement of alien minors or the conditions \nthereof.  See Mot. for Class Cert., Ex. 6 at ¶¶ 4, 8–9 (Mixon Decl.) (attesting that ORR instructed \nMixon not to challenge the agency’s release and placement decisions) [Doc. # 97-10]; Mot. for \nClass Cert., Ex. 7 at ¶¶ 11, 19 (Williams Decl.) (“[B]oth ORR and Vera Institute informally \ndiscourage Vera-funded lawyers from taking legal action against ORR lest they cut off funds \nentirely for assisting unaccompanied minors. * * * [A]lthough ORR boasts of providing free \nlegal services to detained minors, it hobbles free legal service providers who undertake to \nrepresent detained children.”) [Doc. # 97-11]; Mot. for Class Cert., Ex. 8 at ¶¶ 14–24 (Stuart \nDecl.) (attesting that Vera-funded providers rarely challenge ORR’s detention decisions, and that \nORR has instructed such providers not to refer cases to Stuart because she initiated such a \nchallenge) [Doc. # 97-12].  Because there are few free legal services available to minors in ORR \ncustody other than Vera-funded providers, see Mot. for Class Cert., Ex. 6 at ¶¶ 8–10 (Mixon \nDecl.) [Doc. # 97-10], ORR’s conduct will likely deprive most (if not all) such children of the \nopportunity  to  meaningfully  challenge  the  agency’s  release,  placement,  and  medication \ndecisions.  Thus, whether this policy or practice violates federal law (e.g., the TVPRA) is a \ncommon question for nearly all detained children from non-contiguous countries who are placed \nin restrictive settings, denied release to their proposed custodians, or forced to take psychotropic \nmedications.  See FAC at ¶ 144 (asserting that 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5), 6 U.S.C. § 279(b)(1)(A), \nand certain regulations relating thereto collectively require ORR to provide pro bono counsel to \nalien minors who are not from contiguous countries).  Thus, the Court concludes that each of the \nfive putative classes satisfy the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2).  \n \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 141   Filed 12/27/18   Page 22 of 28   Page ID\n #:4528\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741-DMG (PLAx)  Date  December 27, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v. Alex Azar, et al.  Page  22 of 28 \n   \n \n3.  Rule 23(a)(3):  Typicality \n \nTypicality requires a showing that “the claims or defenses of the representative parties \nare typical of the claims or defenses of the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3).  The purpose of this \nrequirement “is to assure that the interest of the named representative aligns with the interests of \nthe class.”  Wolin v. Jaguar Land Rover N. Am., LLC, 617 F.3d 1168, 1175 (9th Cir. 2010) \n(quoting Hanon v. Dataproducts Corp., 976 F.2d 497, 508 (9th Cir. 1992)).  “The test of \ntypicality is whether other members have the same or similar injury, whether the action is based \non conduct which is not unique to the named plaintiffs, and whether other class members have \nbeen injured by the same course of conduct.”  Id. (quoting Hanon, 976 F.2d at 508).  The \ntypicality standard under Rule 23(a)(3) is “permissive”:  “representative claims are ‘typical’ if \nthey  are  reasonably  coextensive  with  those  of  absent  class  members;  they  need  not  be \nsubstantially identical.”  Staton v.

The Court is unable to make that \ndetermination, however, because Daniela Marisol T.’s declarations provide little detail regarding the circumstances \nof her transfer to Shiloh RTC, see Mot. for Class Cert., Exs. 10–11 (Daniela Marisol T.

Defendants also do not controvert \nPlaintiffs’ claims that ORR administered psychotropic drugs to Sirena P. and Benjamin F. \nwithout their families’ informed consent.  See Mot. for Class Cert. at 18–19.   \n \n  Fourth, as discussed supra in Part II.B.2, Plaintiffs have shown that ORR blocks Vera-\nfunded legal service providers from challenging the agency’s custody of unaccompanied minors \nand the conditions thereof.  Defendants counter that “[n]either the First Amended Complaint nor \n                                                 \n21 Plaintiffs assert that Daniela Marisol T. should also be named a representative of the unfit custodian \nclass.  See Reply re Mot. for Class Cert. at 21.  The Court declines to do so at this time, because her declarations do \nnot specify when her proposed custodian submitted the information requested by ORR.   \n  \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 141   Filed 12/27/18   Page 24 of 28   Page ID\n #:4530\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741-DMG (PLAx)  Date  December 27, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v. Alex Azar, et al.  Page  24 of 28 \n   \n \nthe Motion to Certify Class identifies a single class member whom ORR has blocked from \nreceiving legal services[.]”22  See Opp’n re Mot. for Class Cert. at 28–29.  Nonetheless, ORR’s \nalleged policy or practice of discouraging such programs from taking any legal action against the \nagency by its very nature inflicts a systemic injury—i.e., it deprives detained minors of an \nopportunity to challenge placement, detention, and medication decisions.  Whether any of the \nIndividual Plaintiffs were subjectively aware of that fact is beside the point.  Further, the claims \nbelonging to Lucas R., Gabriela N., Daniela Marisol T., and Jaime D. are typical of those \nbelonging to the legal assistance class because:  (1) they assert the same claims as the step-up \nclass, the unfit custodian class, and/or the drug administration class; and (2) it is undisputed that \nthese four Plaintiffs are from non-contiguous countries.23  See Mot. for Class Cert. at 17–18 \n(Daniela Marisol T. and Jaime D. are from Honduras) [Doc. # 97-1]; Mot. for Class Cert.. Ex. 21 \nat ¶ 2 (Lucas R. Decl.) (Lucas R. is from Guatemala) [Doc. # 105-1]; Mot. for Class Cert., Ex. 14 \nat ¶ 2 (Gabriela N. Decl.) (Gabriela N. is from El Salvador) [Doc. # 105-1]. \n \n  Lastly, Plaintiffs contend—and Defendants do not dispute—that ORR transferred Lucas \nR., Gabriela N., Sirena P., and Benjamin F. to Shiloh RTC because of their mental health needs.  \nSee Mot. for Class Cert. at 17–19, 21.  Defendants also do not contest that ORR placed Miguel \nAngel S. in Yolo County Juvenile Detention Center and Shiloh RTC because of his mental health \nneeds.  See Mot. for Class Cert. at 17–18. \n \n  Because the aforementioned proposed class representatives have suffered injuries similar \nto those sustained by other members of their respective putative classes, the Court finds that \nPlaintiffs have satisfied Rule 23(a)(3)’s typicality requirement. \n \n4.  Rule 23(a)(4) and Rule 23(g):  Adequacy \n \n  Rule 23(a)(4) permits certification of a class action if “the representative parties will \nfairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.”  Rule 23(a)(4) presents two questions:  \n“(1) do the named plaintiffs and their counsel have any conflicts of interest with other class \nmembers and (2) will the named plaintiffs and their counsel prosecute the action vigorously on \n                                                 \n22 Although Defendants frame this issue as one of adequacy, the Court addresses it in connection with the \ntypicality prong because it concerns whether Plaintiffs suffered an injury similar to that of the other putative class \nmembers.  See 1 Newberg on Class Actions § 3:32 (5th ed. 2018) (“The typicality prerequisite overlaps with the \nRule 23(a)(4) requirement that class representation be adequate . . . .”). \n  \n23 The FAC alleges that Benjamin F. is a native and citizen of El Salvador (i.e., a non-contiguous country).  \nSee FAC at ¶ 16.  Because Plaintiffs did not make that assertion in their Motion for Class Certification or supply a \nsupporting declaration from Benjamin F., that assertion is neither undisputed nor supported by the evidence.   \n \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 141   Filed 12/27/18   Page 25 of 28   Page ID\n #:4531\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741-DMG (PLAx)  Date  December 27, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v. Alex Azar, et al.  Page  25 of 28 \n   \n \nbehalf of the class?”  See Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1020.  Similarly, Rule 23(g)(1) requires courts to \nconsider several factors “pertinent to counsel’s ability to fairly and adequately represent the \ninterests of the class[.]” \n \n  The Court has already found that the Individual Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of those \npertaining to their respective putative classes, see supra Part III.B.3, and there are no apparent \nconflicts of interest between the Individual Plaintiffs and the absent proposed class members.  \nDefendants nonetheless contend that Lucas R.’s, Sirena P.’s, and Benjamin F.’s claims are moot \nbecause ORR released them.24  See Opp’n re Mot. for Class Cert. at 26–27 & n.11.  It is unlikely \nthat these Plaintiffs’ claims truly are moot because the Flores Agreement authorizes ORR to \nreassume custody over them under certain circumstances.  See Flores Agreement at ¶ 16; see \nalso Saravia, 280 F. Supp. 3d at 1177–82 (noting that ORR had reassumed custody over three \nminors the agency initially released).   \n \nEven if Defendants have released these Plaintiffs, however, Lucas R., Sirena P., and \nBenjamin F. may still serve as class representatives.  The Ninth Circuit has held that “a named \nplaintiff’s  claim  is  ‘transitory  in  nature  and  may  otherwise  evade  review’”  if  a  defendant \nemploys a “tactic of ‘picking off’ lead plaintiffs to avoid a class action.”  See Chen v. Allstate \nIns. Co., 819 F.3d 1136, 1143 (9th Cir. 2016) (quoting Pitts v. Terrible Herbst, Inc., 653 F.3d \n1081, 1091 (9th Cir. 2011)).  Under those circumstances, “the named plaintiff may continue to \nrepresent the class until the district court decides the class certification issue.”  See id. (quoting \nPitts, 653 F.3d at 1092).  Here, Defendants did not release any of the Individual Plaintiffs until \nafter the filing of the FAC on September 7, 2018.  See De La Cruz Decl. at ¶¶ 2–8 [Doc. # 123-\n1].  Additionally, Defendants did not release three of the named Plaintiffs until after they filed \nthe instant Motion for Class Certification.  See id. at ¶¶ 6–8.  It follows that Plaintiffs’ claims are \ninherently transitory and may evade review if the Court countenances Defendants’ transparent \nattempts to thwart their Motion for Class Certification.25 \n                                                 \n24 Plaintiffs concede that ORR also released Miguel Angel S. sometime in early to mid-October 2018.  See \nReply re Mot. for Class Cert. at 20 n.9.  Additionally, on the day before the November 2, 2018 hearing on the instant \nmotions, Defendants informed the Court that ORR also released Gabriela N., Daniela Marisol T., and Jaime D.  See \nDe La Cruz Decl. at ¶¶ 3, 7–8 [Doc. # 123-1].  Thus, Defendants’ contention regarding mootness applies with equal \nforce to all of their claims as well.   \n  \n25 Defendants contend that Sirena P.’s and Benjamin F.’s requests for release were “well underway and \nnear complete” when they were joined as Plaintiffs.  See Opp’n re Mot. for Class Cert. at 26–27 n.11.  The \ndeclaration they cite for that proposition, however, does not support it.  See De La Cruz Decl. at ¶¶ 2–4 [Doc. # 122-\n1].  Further, the Court is not persuaded by Defendants’ contention that Genesis Healthcare Corp. v. Symczyk, 569 \nU.S. 66 (2013), prevents Plaintiffs from relying on the “inherently transitory” claim doctrine.  Since Genesis was \ndecided, the Ninth Circuit reaffirmed the proposition that a defendant’s litigation strategy can invoke that exception \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 141   Filed 12/27/18   Page 26 of 28   Page ID\n #:4532\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741-DMG (PLAx)  Date  December 27, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v.

Suppl. Decl.) [Doc. # 119-\n1]; Reply re Mot. for Class Cert., Ex. 35 at ¶¶ 1–7 (Gabriela N. Suppl. Decl.) [Doc. # 119-2].  \nMoreover,  Plaintiffs  counter  that  Defendants  do  not  “offer  any  legal  authority  that  [this] \nobjection disqualifies [the other Individual] Plaintiffs from serving as class representatives” and \n“[i]t would be nonsensical to assume that Plaintiffs . . . have no desire to seek redress for the \ninjuries [ORR allegedly] caused them.”  See Reply re Mot. for Class Cert. at 20.  The Court \nagrees with Plaintiffs, and declines Defendants’ invitation to elevate form over substance.  The \nCourt thus concludes that all of the Individual Plaintiffs are adequate class representatives with \nregard to their respective classes as defined below. \n \n  Furthermore, the declarations of Plaintiffs’ attorneys reveal that they have undertaken \nconsiderable efforts to investigate the claims in this action, they have extensive experience and \nknowledge regarding complex class litigation brought on behalf of immigrant children, and they \nhave the necessary personnel and resources to prosecute this action to final judgment.  See Mot. \nfor Class Cert., Ex. 28 at ¶¶ 1–6 (Cooper Decl.) [Doc. # 97-32]; Mot. for Class Cert., Ex. 29 at \n¶¶ 1–5 (Holguín Decl.) [Doc. # 97-33]; Mot. for Class Cert., Ex. 30 at ¶¶ 1–10 (Welch Decl.) \n[Doc. # 97-34]; Mot. for Class Cert., Ex. 31 at ¶¶ 1–9 (White Decl.) [Doc. # 97-35]; Mot. for \nClass Cert., Ex. 32 at ¶¶ 1–5 (Wynn Decl.) [Doc. # 97-36].  The Court therefore finds that \nPlaintiffs’ counsel will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the five proposed classes.  \nSee also Opp’n re Mot. for Class Cert. at 26 (“Defendants have no concern that plaintiffs’ \ncounsel will prosecute the action vigorously on behalf of the class[es].”).  \n \n5.  Rule 23(b)(2):  Whether Injunctive or Declaratory Relief Is Appropriate for \nthe Classes \n \nTo obtain class certification under Rule 23(b)(2), the movant must show that “the party \nopposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that \nfinal injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a \nwhole.”  “The rule does not require [courts] to examine the viability or bases of class members’ \nclaims for declaratory and injunctive relief, but only to look at whether class members seek \n                                                                                                                                                             \nto mootness.  See Chen, 819 F.3d at 1138 (“Although [the defendant] argues that Pitts is no longer good law after \nGenesis . . . we rejected that very argument in Gomez v. Campbell-Ewald Co., 768 F.3d 871 (9th Cir. 2014) \n(‘Gomez’), aff’d, 136 S. Ct. 663 (2016).  Pitts therefore remains the law of the circuit.”). \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 141   Filed 12/27/18   Page 27 of 28   Page ID\n #:4533\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741-DMG (PLAx)  Date  December 27, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v.

Hayes, 591 F.3d 1105, \n1125 (9th Cir. 2010).  “‘[I]t is sufficient’ . . . that ‘class members complain of a pattern or \npractice that is generally applicable to the class as a whole.’”  See id. (quoting Walters v. Reno, \n145 F.3d 1032, 1047 (9th Cir. 1998)). \n \nAs noted throughout Part III.B, supra, Defendants have largely refrained from disputing \nPlaintiffs’ assertions that ORR consistently employs the policies and/or practices challenged by \nthe five putative classes, and Plaintiffs’ evidence corroborates their claims that ORR has engaged \nin such conduct.  In addition, Plaintiffs specifically request a declaration that these policies \nand/or  practices  are  unlawful  and  an  injunction  barring  Defendants  from  continuing  to \nimplement them.  Thus, class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) is appropriate.   \n   \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n \n  For the foregoing reasons, the Court issues the following rulings: \n \n1.  Defendants’ MTD is GRANTED only insofar as it seeks the dismissal without prejudice \nof Plaintiffs’ claims to enforce the Flores Agreement, but not insofar as it requests the \ndismissal of Plaintiffs’ claims that ORR failed to provide sufficient procedural safeguards \nfor alien minors to exercise their Flores rights.  The remainder of Defendants’ MTD is \nDENIED; \n \n2.  Defendants shall file an Answer to the FAC by January 9, 2019; \n \n3.  Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification is GRANTED.  The Court CERTIFIES five \nclasses that are comprised of all minors in ORR custody pursuant to 6 U.S.C. section 279 \nand/or 8 U.S.C. section 1232: \n \na.  who are or will be placed in a secure facility, medium-secure facility, or RTC, \nor whom ORR has continued to detain in any such facility for more than 30 \ndays, without being afforded notice and an opportunity to be heard before a \nneutral and detached decisionmaker regarding the grounds for such placement \n(i.e., the “step-up class”); \nb.  whom ORR is refusing or will refuse to release to parents or other available \ncustodians  within  30  days  of  the  proposed  custodian’s  submission  of  a \ncomplete  family  reunification  packet  on  the  ground  that  the  proposed \ncustodian is or may be unfit (i.e., the “unfit custodian class”); \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 141   Filed 12/27/18   Page 28 of 28   Page ID\n #:4534\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741-DMG (PLAx)  Date  December 27, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v.

The Court APPOINTS the following class representatives: \n \na.  Lucas R., Miguel Angel S., Gabriela N., Jaime D., and Sirena P. shall serve as \nrepresentatives of the step-up class; \nb.  Lucas R. and Gabriela N. shall serve as representatives of the unfit custodian class; \nc.  Lucas R., Daniela Marisol T., Gabriela N., Miguel Angel S., Sirena P., and Benjamin \nF. shall serve as representatives of the drug administration class; \nd.  Lucas R., Gabriela N., Daniela Marisol T., and Jaime D. shall serve as representatives \nof the legal representation class; and \ne.  Lucas R., Miguel Angel S., Gabriela N., Sirena P., and Benjamin F. shall serve as \nrepresentatives of the disability class; and \n \n5.  The  Court  APPOINTS  Carlos  R.  Holguín  of  the  Center  for  Human  Rights  & \nConstitutional Law; Leecia Welch, Neha Desai, and Poonam Juneja of the National \nCenter  for  Youth  Law;  Holly  S.  Cooper  and  Carter  C.

This is an action for injunctive relief, declaratory relief, and nominal \n4  damages, challenging certain unlawful policies and practices of Defendant Office of \n5  Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”), a subordinate entity within the U.S. Department of \n6  Health and Human Services (“HHS”). These policies and practices are causing grave \n7  harm  to  children  detained  for  alleged  civil  violations  of  the  Immigration  and \n8  Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101, et seq. (“INA”). Pursuant to § 462 of the Homeland \n9  Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135, codified at 6 U.S.C. § 279 \n10  (“HSA”),  and  §  235  of  the  William  Wilberforce  Trafficking  Victims  Protection \n11  Reauthorization Act of 2008, Pub. L. 110-457, 122 Stat. 5044, codified at 8 U.S.C. \n12  § 1232 (“TVPRA”), ORR is responsible for the placement, care, custody and release \n13  of “unaccompanied alien children.” \n14  2.  The  named  Plaintiffs  are  immigrant  and  asylum-seeking  children \n15  detained for alleged civil violations of the INA and are members of the class protected \n16  under the settlement in Flores v. Sessions, No. 85-cv-4544-DMG (AGRx) (C.D. Cal.) \n17  (“Flores Settlement”).  \n18  3.  The Flores Settlement and TVPRA § 235 oblige ORR to — \n19  (a)  minimize the detention of immigrant children by releasing them to their \n20  parents or other qualified custodians so long as their continued detention \n21  is not required due to dangerousness or unusual flight risk;  \n22  (b)  place detained immigrant children in the least restrictive setting that is in \n23  the best interest of individual children—generally a facility having a \n24  state license to care for dependent, as opposed to delinquent, juveniles—\n25  for however long they remain in federal custody; \n26 \n27 \n28 \n1  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    256 S.

ORR violates the foregoing requirements, as well as the Due Process \n9  Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, the Freedom of Association \n10  Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and Section 504 of the \n11  Rehabilitation Act of 1973 by pursuing the following policies and practices: \n12  (a)  ORR confines children in medium secure facilities, residential treatment \n13  centers  (“RTCs”),  and  secure  facilities  peremptorily,  often  on  bare \n14  allegations they are dangerous or pose a flight risk, without affording \n15  them  a  meaningful  or  timely  opportunity  to  be  heard  regarding  the \n16  reasons for such placement; \n17  (b)  ORR prolongs children’s detention on the ground that their parents or \n18  other available custodians are or may be unfit, while affording neither \n19  detained juveniles nor their proposed custodians a meaningful or timely \n20  opportunity to be heard regarding a proposed custodian’s fitness; \n21  (c)  ORR places children in residential treatment facilities and detention \n22  facilities  in  which  it  knows  they  will  be  administered  powerful \n23  psychotropic  medications  for  weeks,  months,  or  years,  without \n24  procedural safeguards, including seeking informed parental consent or \n25  other  lawful  authorization,  even  from  parents  present  in  the  United \n26  States.  \n27 \n28 \n2  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 5 of 59   Page ID #:3057\n1  (d)  ORR blocks lawyers from representing detained children with respect to \n2  placement, non-consensual administration of psychotropic medications, \n3  or release to available custodians notwithstanding that Congress has \n4  allocated funds specifically to provide such lawyers to represent children \n5  who are or have been in ORR custody in “legal matters,” including issues \n6  related to release and least-restrictive placement; \n7  (e)  ORR segregates children who have or are perceived to have a behavioral, \n8  mental health, intellectual, and/or developmental disability in secure \n9  facilities,  medium  secure  facilities,  and  RTCs,  instead  of  the  most \n10  integrated setting appropriate to their needs; and \n11  (f)  ORR’s  actions  prolong  the  detention  of  children  who  have  or  are \n12  perceived  to  have  a  behavioral,  mental  health,  intellectual,  and/or \n13  developmental  disability  by  placing  them  in  restrictive  settings \n14  associated with heightened administrative barriers to release.   \n15  5.  By this action, Plaintiffs seek equitable relief on behalf of themselves \n16  and those similarly situated requiring Defendants to conform their polices, practices, \n17  and procedures to the Flores Settlement, § 235 of the TVPRA, the Due Process Clause \n18  of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the Freedom of Association Clause \n19  of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation \n20  Act.

Plaintiff Lucas R.2 is a native and citizen of Guatemala whom ORR is \n16  currently detaining at the Shiloh Residential Treatment Center (“Shiloh RTC”) in \n17  Texas. He was born in 2005 and is thirteen years old. Lucas is, and at all relevant \n18  times was, an unaccompanied alien child within the meaning of 6 U.S.C. § 279(g)(2) \n19  and a member of the plaintiff class the Flores Settlement protects. Pursuant to Federal \n20  Rule of Civil Procedure 17(c)(2), Lucas appears through his Next Friend and sister, \n21  Madelyn R., a resident of Los Angeles, California. Before Tuesday, September 4, \n22  2018, ORR refused to release Lucas to his Next Friend and sister on the ground that \n23  Madelyn’s home may be unfit.

Upon information and belief, as of the timing of \n2  this filing, Lucas is scheduled to be released on September 8, 2018.  \n3  11.  Plaintiff Daniela Marisol T. is a native and citizen of Honduras in ORR \n4  custody in a residential group home in Kentwood, Michigan. Daniela Marisol was \n5  born in 2001 and is seventeen years old. Daniela Marisol is, and at all relevant times \n6  was, an unaccompanied alien child within the meaning of 6 U.S.C. § 279(g)(2) and a \n7  member of the plaintiff class the Flores Settlement protects. Pursuant to Federal Rule \n8  of Civil Procedure 17(c)(2), Daniela Marisol appears through her Next Friend and \n9  sister, Katherine L., a resident of St. Paul, Minnesota. ORR previously refused to \n10  release Daniela Marisol to her Next Friend and sister on the ground that Katherine is \n11  or may be unfit due to not having a separate bedroom for Daniela Marisol and not \n12  having adequate income to support Daniela Marisol’s medical expenses. Katharine \n13  has now met ORR’s requirements for reunification having rented a larger apartment \n14  and having enough disposable income to pay Daniela Marisol’s medical expenses and \n15  is currently awaiting ORR’s decision to release Daniela Marisol into her care.  \n16  12.  Plaintiff Gabriela N. is a native and citizen of El Salvador whom ORR is \n17  presently detaining in St. Michael’s Home for Children in Houston, Texas.

Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(c)(2), Miguel \n3  Angel appears through his Next Friend and father, Gerardo S., a resident of San Jose, \n4  California. Gerardo has sought to be Miguel Angel’s custodian and to have Miguel \n5  Angel released from ORR custody into his care. \n6  14.  Plaintiff Jaime D. is a native and citizen of Honduras and presently being \n7  held in ORR custody in Dobbs Ferry, New York. He was born in 2004 and is thirteen \n8  years old. Jaime is, and at all relevant times was, an unaccompanied alien child within \n9  the meaning of 6 U.S.C. § 279(g)(2) and a member of the plaintiff class the Flores \n10  Settlement protects. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(c)(2), Jaime \n11  appears through his Next Friend, Reyna D., a resident of Riverdale, Maryland. Reyna \n12  is Jaime’s aunt. Reyna has sought to be Jaime’s custodian and to have Jaime released \n13  from ORR custody into her care.  \n14  15.  Plaintiff Sirena P. is a native and citizen of Mexico and is presently being \n15  held in ORR custody at Shiloh RTC in Manvel, Texas. She was born in 2003 and is \n16  fourteen years old. Sirena is, and at all relevant times was, an unaccompanied alien \n17  child within the meaning of 6 U.S.C. § 279(g)(2) and a member of the plaintiff class \n18  the Flores Settlement protects. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(c)(2), \n19  Sirena appears through her Next Friend, Eduardo P., a resident of Ontario, California. \n20  Eduardo is Sirena’s parent.

Isabella has sought to be Benjamin’s \n2  sponsor and to have Benjamin released from ORR custody into her care.  \n3  17.  Plaintiff San Fernando Valley Refugee Children Center, Inc. (“Children \n4  Center”) is a non-profit organization incorporated in the State of California, with its \n5  principal place of business in North Hills, California. The Children Center is a project \n6  of  the  North  Hills  United  Methodist  Church’s  Hispanic  Mission.  The  Children \n7  Center’s mission is to provide comprehensive social services, including mental health \n8  care,  shelter,  transitional  living  assistance  and  legal  aid,  to  children,  youth,  and \n9  families who have come in search of refuge from persecution and endemic violence \n10  in the Northern Triangle of Central America (El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala). \n11  The children and youth the Children Center serves are the functional equivalents of \n12  its members. The rights of children and youth the Children Center seeks to protect in \n13  this action are germane to its mission and purpose. ORR’s policies and practices, as \n14  alleged herein, make it substantially more difficult for the Children Center to carry \n15  out its mission. For example, many of the children and youth whom the Children \n16  Center serves have suffered multiple psychological and physical traumas, first in their \n17  countries of origin, next during their journeys through Mexico, and then again, upon \n18  being  arrested  and  detained  for  immigration  violations.  The  more  time  already-\n19  traumatized children and youth remain detained, separated from their parents and \n20  families, the more their mental and physical health deteriorates. The trauma that \n21  immigration detention causes children and youth is greater still when ORR places \n22  them in restrictive settings such as juvenile halls and RTCs, or medicates them \n23  involuntarily  or  without  their  parents’  consent  or  other  lawful  authority.  The \n24  additional  trauma  such  detention  inflicts  requires  the  Children  Center  to  devote \n25  commensurately greater resources, particularly mental health resources, to assist such \n26  children and youth to recover.  \n27 \n28 \n7  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 10 of 59   Page ID #:3062\n1  18.  The Children Center is one of a small number of non-profit organizations \n2  that serve refugee children and youth. The Children Center’s resources are limited \n3  and do not allow it to help all who are in need. The Children Center’s ability to raise \n4  funds depends in part on the raw number of children and youth it helps. As a practical \n5  matter, resources the Children Center’s devotes to serving one child or youth are \n6  unavailable  to  others.  Defendants’  challenged  policies  and  practices  divert  the \n7  Children Center’s limited resources to address the injuries those policies and practices \n8  cause, thereby reducing the number of other needy children and youth the Children \n9  Center is able to assist, and, a fortiori, its ability to raise funds. The Children Center \n10  therefore has a direct institutional interest in: (a) minimizing the time refugee children \n11  and youth, including youth with disabilities, are detained; (b) ensuring that such \n12  children and youth are housed in minimally restrictive settings for however long they \n13  must remain in immigration-related detention; (c) minimizing the injury children and \n14  youth suffer as a result of taking psychotropic drugs; and (d) ensuring that refugee \n15  children and youth have counsel to assist them in all legal matters relating to their \n16  immigration  status,  including  custody,  placement,  and  the  administration  of \n17  psychotropic drugs without parental consent. The direct participation in this litigation \n18  of the children and youth whom the Children Center serves is not necessary because \n19  Plaintiffs seek only prospective equitable relief and nominal damages.  \n20  19.  Plaintiff  Unaccompanied  Central  American  Refugee  Empowerment \n21  (“UCARE”) is an unincorporated consortium of non-profit agencies, most of which \n22  are incorporated in the State of California, with its principal place of business in Los \n23  Angeles, California. UCARE’s mission is to advocate for and provide legal and social \n24  services to immigrant and refugee minors, many of whom are or have been in ORR \n25  or Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody. In appropriate cases, UCARE \n26  arranges  free  representation  and  assistance  to  youth  with  immigration  problems \n27  before  the  U.S.  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Services,  the  Executive  Office  of \n28 \n8  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 11 of 59   Page ID #:3063\n1  Immigration Review, and the Board of Immigration Appeals. Defendants’ unlawful \n2  policies and practices, as alleged herein, make such assistance and representation \n3  substantially  more  difficult  and  render  UCARE’s  work  less  effective.  ORR’s \n4  compliance with the Flores Settlement and § 235 of the TVPRA is germane to \n5  UCARE’s purpose. The individual participation of aggrieved youth the UCARE \n6  serves is not necessary because UCARE seeks only prospective or injunctive relief \n7  and nominal damages for its client members. UCARE has an actual stake in this \n8  litigation  because  the  funding  of  UCARE’s  member  organizations  is  largely \n9  determined by the number of youth they serve. Defendants’ challenged policies and \n10  practices deny or delay children’s release, and thus delay or deny Plaintiff UCARE’s \n11  member organizations the opportunity to serve them. \n12  20.  ORR has placed many unaccompanied children in the communities that \n13  the Children Center and UCARE serve. In federal fiscal year 2018, ORR placed more \n14  than 1,100 unaccompanied children in Los Angeles alone.   \n15  21.  Defendant  Alex  Azar  is  the  Secretary  of  HHS  and  oversees  ORR. \n16  Pursuant to 6 U.S.C. § 279, HHS is responsible for the proper care and placement of \n17  unaccompanied  alien  children  who  are  in  federal  custody  by  reason  of  their \n18  immigration status. HHS and ORR discharge these duties by, inter alia, entering into \n19  contracts  with  public  and  private  entities  to  house,  care  for,  and  provide  legal \n20  assistance to unaccompanied alien children arrested and detained pursuant to the INA. \n21  Defendant Azar is sued in his official capacity only. \n22  22.  Defendant E. Scott Lloyd is the Director of ORR. ORR is responsible for \n23  the care, custody, and release of unaccompanied alien children in federal custody on \n24  account of their immigration status. Defendant Lloyd is sued in his individual capacity \n25  for nominal damages pursuant to Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. \n26  Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), and in all other respects in his official \n27  capacity only. \n28 \n9  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 12 of 59   Page ID #:3064\n1  23.  Defendants, and each of them, have historically professed to act in the \n2  capacity of parens patriae to detained children. Defendants, and each of them, thereby \n3  assume a legal obligation to act in such children’s best interests. Defendants breach \n4  this duty in pursuing the policies and practices challenged in this Complaint.  \n5  IV. \n6  NAMED PLAINTIFFS’ EXPERIENCES IN ORR CUSTODY \n7  A.  Lucas R. \n8  24.  On or about February 12, 2018, ORR assumed custody of Plaintiff Lucas \n9  R. after he arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border. ORR placed him at the Hacienda del \n10  Sol facility in Youngtown, Arizona. Within approximately ten days, Madelyn R., \n11  Lucas’ adult sister and Next Friend, requested Lucas’ custody and delivered to ORR \n12  a family reunification packet with the required documentation. Many years ago, Lucas \n13  and  Madelyn’s  father  abandoned  them;  their  mother  died  when  Lucas  was \n14  approximately two years old. Thereafter, Madelyn and an aunt raised Lucas in his \n15  parents’ stead. Madelyn and Lucas have a very close relationship. Over the next six \n16  weeks or so, ORR gave Lucas and Madelyn the impression that everything was in \n17  order and that it would soon release Lucas to Madelyn’s custody; it did not.  \n18  25.  According to Madelyn, in Guatemala, Lucas was a thriving, happy child \n19  who liked to joke, play, and talk with people. When he arrived at Hacienda del Sol, \n20  facility staff noted that Lucas appeared cooperative, calm, and alert, and showed “no \n21  behavioral concerns.”  \n22  26.  As his confinement wore on, however, Lucas became depressed, fearing \n23  that  ORR  would  never  release  him  to  his  family.  Without  obtaining  Madelyn’s \n24  informed consent, the informed consent of any other adult family member, or judicial \n25  authorization, ORR administered Lucas psychotropic drugs, ostensibly to control \n26  “moderate” depression. Upon information and belief, ORR did not involve a neutral \n27 \n28 \n10  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 13 of 59   Page ID #:3065\n1  decision maker in the initial determination of whether to prescribe psychotropic \n2  medications to Lucas or in ongoing reviews of those medications.  \n3  27.  The medications caused Lucas stomach pain, and he refused to continue \n4  taking them. Lucas thinks that his refusal to take the medications harmed his ability \n5  to reunify with his sister.   \n6  28.  Approximately six weeks after Madelyn had requested Lucas’ custody, \n7  ORR sent an investigator to Madelyn’s home in Los Angeles, California. Living with \n8  Madelyn then and now are her infant daughter, adult brother, and an unrelated female \n9  roommate and her child. At the time the investigator arrived, Madelyn’s roommate’s \n10  brother was visiting.  \n11  29.  The investigator indicated to Madelyn that her home was suitable, but \n12  that all adults who reside with her would have to appear for fingerprinting, including \n13  her  roommate’s  brother.  Madelyn  advised  the  investigator  that  her  roommate’s \n14  brother did not live in the home, but the investigator insisted that the visitor appear \n15  for fingerprinting regardless. All the adult residents of Madelyn’s home appeared for \n16  fingerprinting, but her roommate’s brother did not. Approximately one month later, \n17  ORR orally advised Madelyn that it would not release Lucas to her because her \n18  roommate’s  brother  had  failed  to  appear  for fingerprinting.  ORR  represented  to \n19  Madelyn that its decision was final, and afforded neither Madelyn nor Lucas any \n20  hearing, right to administrative appeal, or other means to change its decision. ORR \n21  failed to provide Madelyn with a written decision or written explanation for denying \n22  her custody of Lucas.   \n23  30.  When Lucas learned that the ORR home examiner recommended against \n24  releasing him to Madelyn, he was devastated. Lucas began feeling desperate and \n25  helpless over his prolonged detention and shared those feelings with staff members.   \n26  Rather than attempting to help Lucas manage his feelings, Hacienda del Sol personnel \n27 \n28 \n11  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 14 of 59   Page ID #:3066\n1  responded to his pleas for support by hospitalizing Lucas and requesting that ORR \n2  transfer him to a more secure facility. \n3  31.  On or about May 21, 2018, ORR transferred Lucas to Shiloh RTC in \n4  Manvel, Texas due to his mental health needs. ORR did not afford Lucas notice of \n5  this transfer, an opportunity to be heard, or a right to appeal. ORRled Madelyn to \n \n6  believe Shiloh RTC was simply another shelter to which it was sending Lucas because \n7  Hacienda del Sol lacked space. Due to ORR’s actions and inactions, Lucas’ release \n8  has been unnecessarily delayed, and Lucas has not been placed in the least restrictive \n9  setting.   \n10  32.  Upon information and belief, while detained at Shiloh RTC, Lucas has \n11  been administered Zoloft. Zoloft’s side-effects include rigidity in the muscles, high \n12  fever, sweating, confusion, agitation, hallucinations, overactive reflexes, tremors, \n13  nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, fainting, and seizures. \n14  33.  Shiloh personnel have now diagnosed Lucas with “major depressive \n15  disorder.” Among Lucas’ “major stressors,” Shiloh personnel identify his “[b]eing \n16  kept from family and in ORR custody.” Shiloh staff nonetheless told Lucas that ORR \n17  would not release him until Shiloh medical personnel declared him psychologically \n18  sound. Lucas’ experiences in ORR custody, including prolonged separation from his \n19  family and administration of psychotropic medications over his objection and without \n20  informed consent, exacerbated his mental health symptoms and made this approval \n21  less likely, thereby delaying his release.  \n22  34.  Shiloh personnel have regularly prevented Lucas from communicating \n23  with  Madelyn  over  the  telephone.  Shiloh  denied  Lucas  his  right  to  speak  with \n24  Madelyn on a weekly basis without providing him or his sister any explanation for \n25  the denial. This prohibition has made Lucas deeply despondent and has increased his \n26  feelings of isolation. \n27 \n28 \n12  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 15 of 59   Page ID #:3067\n1  35.  ORR has provided Lucas no legal counsel to represent him with respect \n2  to release, the administration of psychotropic medications, or placement at Shiloh. \n3  36.  Prior to Tuesday, September 4, 2018, ORR refused to release Lucas to \n4  his Next Friend and sister on the ground that Madelyn’s home may be unfit. ORR \n5  indicated on September 4, 2018, that it would release Lucas on September 6, 2018; \n6  however as of the time of this filing, upon information and belief, Lucas remains \n7  detained.   \n8  B.  Daniela Marisol T. \n9  37.  On or about August 3, 2017, Plaintiff Daniela Marisol T., a partially deaf \n10  seventeen-year-old  girl,  arrived  at  the  U.S.-Mexico  border  with  her  older  sister, \n11  Katherine L., and her nephew. Daniela Marisol, Katherine, and her younger nephew \n12  fled from their home country in fear for their lives. At the border, Daniela Marisol \n13  was forcibly separated from her sister and nephew and placed in the custody of ORR \n14  at the International Education Service Norma Linda Shelter in Los Fresnos, Texas. \n15  Daniela Marisol and Katherine are very close, and Daniela Marisol views Katherine \n16  as a second mother. Daniela Marisol was so emotionally traumatized by the separation \n17  that she was later admitted to a psychiatric hospital to cope with the trauma. The \n18  screening  physician  also  recommended  treatment  for  Daniela  Marisol’s  hearing \n19  disability once she was released to her sister—a release that, eleven months later, has \n20  yet to come to fruition. Daniela Marisol finally received a hearing aid ten months after \n21  the screening physician’s original recommendation, and thus spent nearly a year with \n22  limited ability to hear. \n23  38.  Katherine and her son, detained separately from Daniela Marisol, were \n24  released from immigration custody after they proved to an Asylum Officer that they \n25  have a credible fear of persecution should they be returned to Honduras. Upon release, \n26  Katherine applied to become Daniela Marisol’s custodian and have ORR release \n27  Daniela Marisol to her custody. However, ORR has placed arbitrary, expensive, and \n28 \n13  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 16 of 59   Page ID #:3068\n1  excessive conditions on Daniela Marisol’s release, which preemptively dissuaded \n2  Katherine from applying to be her sponsor, and included conditions purportedly \n3  related  to  Daniela  Marisol’s  mental  health  needs.  Only  recently,  following \n4  overwhelming community support, has Katherine finally been able to meet these \n5  excessive conditions and apply to be Daniela Marisol’s sponsor.  \n6  39.  According to Katherine, when Daniela Marisol lived in Honduras with \n7  her family, she did not seem to have mental health issues. However, Daniela Marisol’s \n8  psychological state rapidly deteriorated after her family separation. It was further \n9  exacerbated when caseworkers told Daniela Marisol that she was not going to be \n10  released to her sister. Daniela Marisol lost hope that she would ever be released to her \n11  family. Depressed and suicidal, she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital where she \n12  suffered a psychotic breakdown.  \n13  40.  While Daniela Marisol was detained at the Norma Linda shelter, a doctor \n14  reiterated the screening physician’s recommendation, while also discovering that she \n15  was largely deaf in one ear. ORR declined to treat her deafness and instead noted that \n16  she should consult a specialist regarding her deafness “once [she was] reunified with \n17  family.” Likewise,  at  Shiloh  RTC,  Daniela  Marisol’s  hearing  disability  went \n18  untreated. Months later, when she was stepped-down to a shelter care facility in Los \n19  Angeles County called David and Margaret, it was again recommended she receive \n20  hearing aids. Again, she never received the hearing aids while in Los Angeles County. \n21  Finally, only after she was transferred to Michigan and in the custody of Bethany \n22  Christian Services—almost ten months after her hearing disability diagnosis and only \n23  at the repeated request of counsel—did she receive her hearing aids.   \n24  41.  After her breakdown, on or about September 8, 2017, ORR transferred \n25  Daniela Marisol to Shiloh RTC in Manvel, Texas due to her mental health needs.  \n26  ORR did not afford her notice of her transfer, an opportunity to be heard or a right to \n27  appeal. Moreover, Daniela Marisol’s sister, Katherine, was required to show a $500 \n28 \n14  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 17 of 59   Page ID #:3069\n1  per month disposable income in order to support Daniela Marisol’s psychological and \n2  medical needs. Because her sister did not have sufficient economic resources ORR \n3  told her she could not qualify to sponsor Daniela Marisol. \n4  42.  Without obtaining the informed consent of Daniela Marisol’s mother, \n5  Katherine,  other  family  members,  or  court  authorization,  ORR  administered \n6  numerous  psychotropic  medications  to  Daniela  Marisol,  including  atypical \n7  antipsychotics and antidepressants, starting when she was in the Norma Linda shelter, \n8  and continuing while she was at Shiloh RTC and the David and Margaret shelter in \n9  Los Angeles County, and through her present placement, Bethany Christian Services \n10  in Michigan. In the approximately thirteen months that she has been in ORR custody, \n11  Daniela Marisol has been given multiple psychotropic medications, including Prozac, \n12  Abilify, Clonidine, Risperdal, Seroquel, and Zyprexa. While in ORR custody, Daniela \n13  Marisol has been the subject of numerous, changing diagnoses, including “Bipolar \n14  disorder, MRE, Mixed, with psychosis, GAD, PTSD;” “major depressive disorder, \n15  recurrent episode, severe with mood-congruent psychotic features;” and “bipolar II \n16  disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, PTSD.” Upon information and belief, ORR \n17  did not involve a neutral decision maker in the initial determination of whether to \n18  prescribe psychotropic medications to Daniela Marisol or in ongoing reviews of those \n19  medications.  \n20  43.  As recognized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), \n21  antidepressants  such  as  those  prescribed  to  Daniela  Marisol  “increase[]  the  risk \n22  compared  to  placebo  of  suicidal  thinking  and  behavior  (suicidality)  in  children, \n23  adolescents, and young adults in short term studies of major depressive disorder \n24  (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders.” ORR has frequently given Daniela Marisol \n25  an  atypical  antipsychotic  and  an  antidepressant  in  combination.  Research \n26  demonstrates that the number and severity of side effects, such as thoughts of suicide \n27  and  intentional  self-harm,  increases  as  the  number  of  concurrent  medications \n28 \n15  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 18 of 59   Page ID #:3070\n1  increases. Daniela Marisol has become suicidal while being forced to take such \n2  antidepressants and drug combinations. \n3  44.  Daniela Marisol believes that she has to take the medication because \n4  facility staff have told her that she must in order to be released from government \n5  custody. \n6  45.  Katherine desperately wants to provide her younger sister a loving and \n7  safe home, and she has done everything in her power to have Daniela Marisol released \n8  to her care. However, ORR told Katherine that, in order for Daniela Marisol to be \n9  released to her care, Katherine must move to a new house, have a separate private \n10  bedroom for Daniela Marisol, and prove that she can pay over $500 per month for \n11  Daniela Marisol’s medical care. In response to these demands, Katherine engaged \n12  with a local, supportive Jewish Synagogue that has raised money for a new apartment \n13  with a separate bedroom for Daniela Marisol, donated new furnishings for Daniela \n14  Marisol’s bedroom, and fundraised over $5,000 in cash from its congregation to \n15  support  Daniela  Marisol’s  medical  needs.  Katherine  currently  lives  in  a  new \n16  apartment which she rented specifically to meet ORR’s demand that Daniela Marisol \n17  have  a  separate  bedroom,  and  has  enough  money  saved  to  meet  all  of  Daniela \n18  Marisol’s medical needs. She has received a positive home study evaluation and an \n19  expert psychologist found it was in Daniela Marisol’s best interest to be reunited with \n20  her sister. Katherine has attempted to meet ORR’s arduous demands, but has yet to \n21  be provided with any written decision as to whether she will be reunified with Daniela \n22  Marisol. ORR’s requirements that Katherine must have a two-bedroom apartment and \n23  be able to demonstrate she has the ability to pay $500 per month in medical expenses \n24  were represented to Katherine as fixed prerequisites to sponsoring Daniela Marisol. \n25  ORR never afforded Katherine or Daniela Marisol any hearing, right to administrative \n26  appeal, or other means to change its decision.

Daniela Marisol remains in government custody, away from her sister \n4  and other family. ORR has given her no legal counsel to represent her with respect to \n5  release, administration of psychotropic medications, or her placement.  \n6  C.  Miguel Angel S. \n7  47.  On or about May 16, 2017, ORR assumed custody of Plaintiff Miguel \n8  Angel after he arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border. ORR placed him at the Southwest \n9  Key shelter in southern California. The staff initially told Miguel Angel that he would \n10  be released to Gerardo S., his father and next friend, within three months.  \n11  48.  As Miguel Angel’s time in detention wore on, he felt anxious at the \n12  shelter  and  often  feared  he  would  never  be  released.  On  July  17,  2017,  ORR \n13  transferred Miguel Angel to Shiloh RTC in Texas due to his mental health needs. \n14  ORR did not afford him notice of his transfer, an opportunity to be heard or a right to \n15  appeal. At Shiloh, Miguel Angel was administered several psychotropic medications, \n16  including  Remeron,  Trazadone,  Seroquel,  and  Lexapro.  Side  effects  of  these \n17  medications include stomach pain, dizziness, nausea, drowsiness, unusual weight \n18  gain, blurred vision, and insomnia.   \n19  49.   Miguel Angel objected to taking the medications because they made him \n20  feel itchy, dizzy, aggressive, nauseous, and caused him to gain an unusual amount of \n21  weight in a short period of time. Shiloh staff insisted that he take the medication. Upon \n22  information and belief, the staff at Shiloh administered these medications to Miguel \n23  Angel without obtaining Gerardo’s informed consent or judicial authorization.   \n24  50.  Upon information and belief, ORR did not involve a neutral decision \n25  maker in the initial determination of whether to prescribe psychotropic medications \n26  to Miguel Angel or in ongoing review of those medications. \n27 \n28 \n17  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 20 of 59   Page ID #:3072\n1  51.  While  Miguel  Angel  was  detained  at  Shiloh,  several  staff  members \n2  physically assaulted him multiple times. During one incident, a staff member placed \n3  Miguel Angel in a headlock, painfully ripping Miguel Angel’s earring out of his \n4  earlobe. A physician assistant watched this, but did nothing to stop the attack. Miguel \n5  Angel reported the incident immediately to the facility doctor, but the doctor laughed \n6  and did nothing. Another time, two Shiloh staff members picked Miguel Angel up by \n7  his arms and pushed him up against a wall. One of the staff members pressed his \n8  forearm across Miguel Angel’s throat, making it hard for him to breathe.  Upon \n9  information  and  belief,  when  Miguel  Angel  reported  the  incidents  to  staff,  no \n10  disciplinary action was taken.  \n11  52.  In March 2018, shortly after these assaults took place, ORR transferred \n12  Miguel Angel to Yolo Juvenile Detention Center, affording him neither notice nor \n13  opportunity to be heard. Upon information and belief, Miguel Angel was transferred \n14  to Yolo in retaliation for reporting the assaults.  \n15  53.  At Yolo, facility staff has attacked Miguel Angel with pepper spray, and \n16  he fears they will do it again. On one occasion, after Miguel Angel had been pepper \n17  sprayed by staff in his eyes and ears, he had to use water from the toilet in his cell to \n18  wash out his eyes because staff cut off water to his sink. The pepper spray made his \n19  eyes feel like they were on fire, and he lost hearing in one ear for several days. Miguel \n20  Angel spends most of his time at Yolo locked in a small cell and is only allowed out \n21  for short periods, which makes him feel trapped and tortured.  \n22  54.  Miguel Angel’s father, Gerardo, applied to be Miguel Angel’s sponsor \n23  around October 2017. Miguel Angel and Gerardo have a very close relationship, and \n24  Miguel Angel wants to live with him. Gerardo lives in an apartment with his brother, \n25  and in October 2017 both Gerardo and his brother submitted all required documents \n26  to  ORR,  including  birth  certificates  and  fingerprints.  ORR  also  requested  that \n27 \n28 \n18  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 21 of 59   Page ID #:3073\n1  Gerardo’s neighbor, who lives across the hallway, submit the same information. The \n2  neighbor submitted this information in October 2017.  \n3  55.  In December 2017, a home investigator visited Gerardo’s apartment to \n4  perform  a  home  study.  The  home  study  went  well,  and  the  home  investigator \n5  recommended  that  Miguel  Angel  be  released  to  Gerardo’s  custody.  The  home \n6  investigator assured Gerardo that Miguel Angel would probably be released in the \n7  first few weeks of January. Gerardo heard nothing from ORR or Miguel Angel’s case \n8  workers throughout January or February 2018. \n9  56.  At both facilities, Miguel Angel experienced barriers to release to his \n10  father. In March 2018, Gerardo was told that the Shiloh doctors would not approve \n11  Miguel Angel for release and that he would remain in ORR custody until they do. \n12  Miguel Angel’s experiences in ORR custody, including prolonged separation from \n13  his family, administration of psychotropic medications over his objection and without \n14  informed consent, and assaults by staff at Shiloh, exacerbated his mental health \n15  symptoms and made this approval less likely, thereby delaying his release.   \n16  57.  In early May 2018, Miguel Angel’s case worker at Yolo told Gerardo \n17  that he needed to provide proof of school enrollment and the name of a psychiatric \n18  clinic in order for Miguel Angel to be released. Gerardo has tried his best to comply \n19  with these requirements, but the local school requires Miguel Angel to be physically \n20  present in order to be enrolled, and Gerardo has been unable to find a psychiatric \n21  clinic that will give Miguel Angel an appointment. In late May 2018, Miguel Angel’s \n22  case worker told Gerardo that his fingerprints had expired, and that Gerardo, his \n23  brother, and his neighbor would need to submit their fingerprints again. \n24  58.  ORR has refused to release Miguel Angel to Gerardo’s custody for over \n25  a year. ORR has not provided Miguel Angel or Gerardo with written notification of \n26  its refusal to release Miguel Angel or the basis for the refusal, or an opportunity to \n27  review the underlying evidence or appeal ORR’s refusal to release Miguel Angel to \n28 \n19  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 22 of 59   Page ID #:3074\n1  his father. Due to ORR’s actions and inactions, Miguel Angel’s release has been \n2  unnecessarily delayed and he has not been placed in the least restrictive setting.  \n3  D.  Gabriela N. \n4  59.  On or about January 8, 2017, ORR assumed custody of Plaintiff Gabriela \n5  N., shortly after she had turned herself in at the U.S.-Mexico border. As a young girl \n6  living in El Salvador, Gabriela experienced extreme violence and did not feel safe at \n7  home. ORR placed her at the Southwest Key Casita del Valle facility (“Casita del \n8  Valle shelter”) in Clint, Texas. In April 2017, Isaac N., Gabriela’s grandfather and \n9  Next Friend, requested Gabriela’s custody and submitted an application to serve as \n10  her custodian. Gabriela’s  mother appeared before a U.S. Consular official in El \n11  Salvador to execute a formal designation pursuant to Paragraph 14D of the Flores \n12  settlement directing ORR to release Gabriela to her grandfather.  \n13  60.  Gabriela’s biological father is deceased, and her stepfather physically \n14  abused her mother and disabled sister who suffers from paralysis from the abuse and \n15  can no longer speak. Thus, Gabriela fled to the U.S. seeking safety, with the hope of \n16  living  with  her  grandfather.  Gabriela  and  her  grandfather,  Isaac,  have  a  close \n17  relationship, and she wants to live with him. Over the next approximately fourteen \n18  months, Isaac continued to submit documents that ORR requested and completed a \n19  home study in anticipation that ORR would release Gabriela to his custody; it did not. \n20  61.  In El Salvador, Gabriela took no medications for mental illness. When \n21  she arrived at Casita del Valle shelter, facility staff noted that Gabriela appeared \n22  emotionally stable, receptive, and resilient.   \n23  62.  As her confinement wore on, however, Gabriela became depressed and \n24  anxious, fearing that ORR would never release her to her family. Without obtaining \n25  Isaac’s informed consent, the informed consent of any other adult family member, or \n26  judicial  authorization,  ORR  repeatedly  administered  Gabriela  psychotropic \n27 \n28 \n20  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 23 of 59   Page ID #:3075\n1  medications,  ostensibly  to  control  post-traumatic  stress  disorder,  anxiety,  major \n2  depressive disorder, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (“ADHD”).  \n3  63.  While at Casita del Valle shelter, Gabriela was administered Prozac, a \n4  psychotropic medication.  \n5  64.  On or about September 7, 2017, ORR transferred Gabriela to Shiloh RTC \n6  due to her mental health needs. ORR did not afford her notice of the transfer, an \n7  opportunity to be heard or a right to appeal. At Shiloh, ORR administered Gabriela \n8  another psychotropic medication, Adderall, which includes side effects of irritability \n9  and  difficulty  with  sleep  initiation.  Adderall  is  also  known  to  cause  or  worsen \n10  depression  in  a  significant  proportion  of  those  who  take  it.  Over  the  course  of \n11  Gabriela’s detention in Shiloh, the psychiatrist at Shiloh increased the dosage of \n12  Adderall administered to Gabriela several times. Upon information and belief, ORR \n13  did not involve a neutral decision maker in the initial determination of whether to \n14  prescribe  psychotropic  medications  to  Gabriela  or  in  ongoing  review  of  those \n15  medications. \n16  65.  Gabriela does not believe the medications help her, and she does not \n17  want to take them. However, Gabriela believes that she must take the medications in \n18  order to be released from detention. Shiloh staff told Gabriela that ORR would not \n19  release  her  until  Shiloh  medical  personnel  declare  her  psychologically  sound.  \n20  Gabriela’s experiences in ORR custody, including prolonged separation from her \n21  family and taking medications she does not want to take, exacerbated her mental \n22  health symptoms and made this approval less likely, thereby delaying her release.    \n23  66.  In February 2018, ORR sent an investigator to Isaac’s home in Oakland, \n24  California,  where  he  lived, and  continues  to  live,  alone.  Isaac  moved  to  a  new \n25  apartment and purchased a new bed for Gabriela in preparation for her release.   \n26  67.  The investigator’s report acknowledges the close relationship between \n27  Isaac  and  Gabriela,  credits  Isaac  for  having  “adequate  housing,”  “access  to \n28 \n21  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 24 of 59   Page ID #:3076\n1  transportation,”  and  “maintain[ing]  stable  employment,”  and  notes  that  Isaac  is \n2  committed to “oversee[ing] [Gabriela’s] arrival to school each day and . . . provid[ing] \n3  afterschool supervision,” is aware of a local “hospital where he could take [Gabriela] \n4  for any medical needs,” and has “identified a local mental health provider . . . where \n5  he intends to connect [Gabriela].” However, the investigator questioned Isaac’s ability \n6  to  support  Gabriela’s  education  and  care  for  her  financially.  Isaac  assured  the \n7  investigator that he would do everything required to provide for Gabriela. Later, \n8  Gabriela’s social worker at Shiloh told Isaac that ORR was no longer considering him \n9  as a custodian for his granddaughter. ORR afforded neither Isaac nor Gabriela any \n10  hearing, right to administrative appeal, or other means to change its decision. ORR \n11  failed to provide Isaac with a written decision or written explanation for denying him \n12  custody of Gabriela. Due to ORR’s actions and inactions, Gabriela’s release has been \n13  unnecessarily delayed and Gabriela has not been placed in the least restrictive setting.  \n14  68.  Seventeen-year-old Gabriela remains detained in ORR custody at St. \n15  Michael’s Home for Children, where she has been administered Prozac and Adderall. \n16  For  four  months,  St.  Michael’s  personnel  continued  to  administer  Adderall  to \n17  Gabriela without obtaining new prescriptions from a psychiatrist. After Gabriela \n18  finally met with a psychiatrist four months into her detention at St. Michael’s, the \n19  psychiatrist increased the dosage of Adderall yet again. \n20  69.  After being detained for over one and a half years, Gabriela is miserable \n21  and desperately wants to live with her grandfather. Her grandfather is ready and eager \n22  to care for her. Shiloh staff have nonetheless told Gabriela that ORR will not release \n23  her to her grandfather. ORR has provided Gabriela no legal counsel to represent her \n24  with  respect  to  release,  the  administration  of  psychotropic  medications,  or  her \n25  placement at Shiloh. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n22  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 25 of 59   Page ID #:3077\n1  E.  Jaime D. \n2  70.  On or about April 8, 2018, ORR assumed custody of thirteen-year-old \n3  Plaintiff Jaime D. after he arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border with his six-year-old \n4  sister and ten-year-old aunt. ORR placed Jaime and his younger sister and aunt at the \n5  Cayuga Centers shelter in Bronx, New York. On or about April 10, 2018, Reyna D., \n6  Jaime’s aunt and Next Friend, requested Jaime’s custody and submitted a family \n7  reunification packet to ORR. Reyna is Jaime’s only family in the United States. Jaime \n8  desperately wants to be released to Reyna’s care. Jaime’s mother died when he was \n9  seven years old and, upon information and belief, his father died before he was born. \n10  Reyna discussed ORR’s requirements for becoming Jaime’s custodian in detail with \n11  Jaime’s  case  manager  at  Cayuga  Centers  and  immediately  began  gathering  the \n12  required documents to send to ORR.  \n13  71.  When Jaime was first sent to Cayuga Centers, the staff made him feel \n14  very nervous. Jaime was terrified that he would be forced to return to his home \n15  country, where his life had been threatened. He made up a story about his life in his \n16  home country, because he thought that this would make the shelter staff leave him \n17  alone. He later recanted this story multiple times.  \n18  72.  On or about April 18, 2018, ORR transferred Jaime to Yolo County \n19  Juvenile Detention Center in Woodland, California. ORR transferred Jaime to Yolo \n20  without affording him notice, an opportunity to be heard or a right to appeal. He was \n21  awakened at 4:00 in the morning and restrained with heavy shackles throughout the \n22  cross-country flight from New York to California. Jaime was not allowed to say \n23  goodbye to his younger sister or aunt. He was extremely worried they would think he \n24  had abandoned them.  \n25  73.  Yolo staff first contacted Reyna regarding her application for Jaime’s \n26  custody about a week after Jaime arrived at Yolo. Approximately two weeks later, \n27  Jaime’s case manager noted that Reyna had “provided all that [had] been asked of \n28 \n23  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 26 of 59   Page ID #:3078\n1  her,” including a complete family reunification packet and fingerprints. In late May \n2  2018, Reyna completed a home study and interview with a home investigator. ORR \n3  found Reyna a suitable custodian for Jaime’s younger sister and aunt. ORR released \n4  the two girls to Reyna’s care on or about June 8, 2018. \n5  74.  While detained at Yolo, Jaime felt unsafe and suffered from anxiety. \n6  Reyna  was  extremely  concerned  for  his  well-being  as  well,  as  Jaime  sounded \n7  increasingly sad and scared during their phone calls. Throughout his time at Yolo, \n8  Jaime suffered physical abuse at the hands of older youth in the facility. Jaime alerted \n9  facility staff of the abuse, but staff ignored his concerns and said they did not believe \n10  him. \n11  75.  Two weeks after he was transferred to Yolo, Jaime’s case manager noted \n12  that the Yolo staff were “all in agreement that [Jaime] isn’t appropriately placed in a \n13  secure setting.” Jaime was told by his case worker that he was too young to be at Yolo \n14  and would hopefully be transferred soon. However, Jaime remained at Yolo for \n15  another three weeks. On or about May 24, 2018, ORR transferred Jaime to Children’s \n16  Village medium secure facility in Dobbs Ferry, New York. \n17  76.  Thirteen-year-old Jaime remains detained at Children’s Village, where \n18  he is increasingly anxious and worried that he will never be released to his aunt’s care. \n19  As of the filing of this Amended Complaint, Reyna has not heard from Jaime’s case \n20  worker at Children’s Village for almost a month. ORR has not provided Jaime or \n21  Reyna with written notification of its refusal to release Jaime or the basis for the \n22  refusal, or an opportunity to review the underlying evidence or appeal ORR’s refusal \n23  to release Jaime to his aunt. Due to ORR’s actions and inactions, Jaime’s release has \n24  been unnecessarily delayed and Jaime has not been placed in the least restrictive \n25  setting.  \n26  77.  ORR has provided Jaime no legal counsel to represent him with respect \n27  to release or his placement at Children’s Village.  \n28 \n24  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 27 of 59   Page ID #:3079\n1  F.  Sirena P. \n2  78.  On or about April 14, 2018, ORR assumed custody of Plaintiff Sirena P. \n3  after she arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border with her two siblings. ORR placed Sirena \n4  and her siblings at the Southwest Key Campbell shelter (“Campbell”) in Phoenix, \n5  Arizona.  Shortly  after,  Eduardo  P.,  Sirena’s  father  and  Next  Friend,  requested \n6  Sirena’s custody and submitted a family reunification packet to ORR. Sirena’s father \n7  has completed two home studies and received positive recommendations for both. \n8  After the first home study was completed, Campbell released Sirena’s siblings to her \n9  parents’ custody. ORR prohibited Sirena from joining her siblings and parents, citing \n10  Sirena’s mental health needs.  \n11  79.  Sirena’s separation from her parents upset her so severely that she was \n12  hospitalized twice in May 2018. Sirena has explained that her mental health needs are \n13  fueled solely by the agony she feels as a result of her ongoing separation from her \n14  parents.  \n15  80.  Without obtaining Eduardo’s informed consent, the informed consent of \n16  any other adult family member, or judicial authorization, while detained at Campbell \n17  and during her hospitalization, shelter and hospital personnel administered multiple \n18  psychotropic medications to Sirena, including Hydroxyzine, Prozac, Abilify, and \n19  Zoloft.  \n20  81.  On or about June 4, 2018, ORR transferred Sirena to Shiloh RTC in \n21  Manvel, Texas due to her mental health needs. ORR transferred Sirena to Shiloh \n22  without affording her notice, an opportunity to be heard or a right to appeal. She was \n23  awakened around 3:00 in the morning and transported to Shiloh against her wishes.  \n24  82.  At Shiloh, Sirena struggles with anxiety, depression, and hopelessness. \n25  Sirena’s  Admission  Assessment  indicated  that  Sirena’s  major  stressors  include \n26  “[s]eparation from family” and “[f]rustration with lengthy reunification process.” \n27  Without obtaining Eduardo’s informed consent, the informed consent of any other \n28 \n25  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 28 of 59   Page ID #:3080\n1  adult family member, or judicial authorization, Shiloh personnel have administered \n2  Buproprion, a psychotropic medication, to Sirena. \n3  83.  Sirena remains detained at Shiloh, where she is increasingly anxious and \n4  worried that she will never be released to her parents’ care. As of August 24, 2018, \n5  Sirena’s release was still pending her doctor’s approval. Sirena’s experiences in ORR \n6  custody,  including  prolonged  separation  from  her  family  and  administration  of \n7  psychotropic medications without informed consent, have exacerbated her mental \n8  health symptoms, thereby making this approval less likely and delaying her release.  \n9  84.  Due  to  ORR’s  actions  and  inactions,  Sirena’s  release  has  been \n10  unnecessarily delayed and Sirena has not been placed in the least restrictive setting. \n11  While Sirena’s two nondisabled siblings have been released to their parents, Sirena \n12  has been placed at Shiloh and her release has been delayed on the basis of her mental \n13  health needs.  \n14  85.  Upon information and belief, ORR has provided Sirena no legal counsel \n15  to represent her with respect to release or her placement at Shiloh.  \n16  G.  Benjamin F.  \n17  86.  On or about July 2, 2018, ORR assumed custody of Benjamin F. after he \n18  and his brother were inexplicably separated from their mother in the South Texas \n19  Family Residential Center, known as Dilley.   \n20  87.  Nine-year-old Benjamin, who is autistic and developmentally delayed, \n21  struggles to function and speak when he is not in the presence of his mother. His \n22  traumatic separation from his mother and placement in ORR custody has led to a \n23  cascading effect of multiple physical and emotional challenges for him, none of which \n24  are being addressed by ORR.  \n25  88.  Benjamin was initially placed at St. PJ’s Children’s Home with his \n26  brother, Mateo P. Isabella, Benjamin’s grandmother and Next Friend, immediately \n27  began the process of filling out the Family Reunification Packet so that both of her \n28 \n26  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 29 of 59   Page ID #:3081\n1  grandsons could be released to her in Los Angeles, California. Isabella received \n2  confusing and conflicting information about additional information she needed to \n3  provide to ORR, but she kept responding to every request that she received and she \n4  successfully submitted a completed packet to ORR. ORR conducted a home study of \n5  Isabella and gave her a positive recommendation.  \n6  89.  Without obtaining Isabella’s informed consent, the informed consent of \n7  any other adult family member, or judicial authorization, Benjamin was placed on \n8  multiple psychotropic medications, including Guanfacine and Risperidone, while he \n9  was at St. PJ’s Children’s Home. The Guanfacine made Benjamin severely drowsy. \n10  Upon information and belief, ORR did not involve a neutral decision maker in the \n11  initial determination of whether to prescribe psychotropic medications to Benjamin \n12  or in ongoing review of those medications. \n13  90.  On or about July 23, 2018, ORR transferred Benjamin to Shiloh RTC in \n14  Manvel, Texas due to his mental health and behavioral health needs. ORR transferred \n15  Benjamin to Shiloh without affording him notice, an opportunity to be heard or a right \n16  to  appeal.  This  transfer  resulted  in  yet  another  devastating  separation:  between \n17  Benjamin and his older brother Mateo.  \n18  91.  Benjamin’s isolation and trauma have worsened at Shiloh. Shortly after \n19  Benjamin was transferred to Shiloh, in August 2018, St. PJ’s released Mateo to his \n20  grandmother’s  care.  While  Mateo  now  lives  in  the  comfort  of  Isabella’s  home \n21  hundreds of miles away in Los Angeles, Benjamin continues to languish in detention \n22  without the benefits of the daily protection and care of his older brother. \n23  92.  At  Shiloh,  personnel  continued  to  administer  Guanfacine  and \n24  Risperidone to Benjamin. Within three weeks of his arrival, Shiloh administered a \n25  new psychotropic medication, Lexapro, and increased the dosages of both Guanfacine \n26  and Lexapro administered to Benjamin. Upon information and belief, as was the case \n27  at St. PJ’s, ORR did not involve a neutral decision maker in the initial determination \n28 \n27  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 30 of 59   Page ID #:3082\n1  of whether to prescribe psychotropic medications to Benjamin or in ongoing review \n2  of those medications. \n3  93.  Upon information and belief, Benjamin will not be released from Shiloh \n4  until medical personnel declare him psychologically sound and approve his release. \n5  Benjamin’s experiences in ORR custody, including prolonged separation from his \n6  family—in  particular  his  mother,  the  only  person  with  whom  he  communicates \n7  effectively  verbally—and  administration  of  psychotropic  medications  without \n8  informed  consent,  have  exacerbated  his  mental  health  symptoms  and  made  this \n9  approval less likely, thereby delaying his release.  \n10  94.  While  Benjamin’s  nondisabled  brother  has  been  released  to  his \n11  grandmother, Benjamin has been placed at Shiloh and his release has been delayed on \n12  the basis of his mental health needs, which are in no way being met in his current \n13  placement.  \n14  95.  Nine-year-old  Benjamin  remains  detained  at  Shiloh,  where  he  is \n15  increasingly anxious and desperate to reunite with his brother and grandmother. Due \n16  to ORR’s actions and inactions, Benjamin’s release has been unnecessarily delayed \n17  and Benjamin has not been placed in the least restrictive setting.  \n18  V. \n19  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n20  96.  The named Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \n21  Procedure  23(a)  and  (b)(2)  on  behalf  of themselves  and  the following  similarly \n22  situated proposed class members:  \n23  All  children  in  ORR  custody  pursuant  to  6  U.S.C.  §  279  and/or  8  U.S.C. \n24  § 1232 — \n25  (a)  whom ORR refuses to release to parents or other available custodians \n26  within thirty days of the proposed custodian’s submitting a complete \n27 \n28 \n28  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 31 of 59   Page ID #:3083\n1  family reunification packet on the ground that the proposed custodian is \n2  or may be unfit;  \n3  (b)  who have been, are or will be placed in a secure facility, medium-secure \n4  facility, or RTC, or continued in any such facility for more than thirty \n5  days, without being afforded notice and  an opportunity to be heard \n6  before a neutral and detached decisionmaker regarding the grounds for \n7  such placement;  \n8  (c)  who have been or will be administered psychotropic medication without \n9  procedural safeguards, including obtaining informed consent or court \n10  authorization  prior  to  medicating  a  child,  involving  a  neutral \n11  decisionmaker  in  the  initial  determination  of  whether  to  prescribe \n12  psychotropics  to  a  child  in  ORR  custody,  and  involving  a  neutral \n13  decision-maker to conduct  periodic reviews of those medications as \n14  treatment continues;  \n15  (d)  who are natives of non-contiguous countries and to whom ORR blocks \n16  legal assistance in legal matters or proceedings involving their custody, \n17  placement, release, and/or non-consensual consumption of psychotropic \n18  drugs; \n19  (e)  who have, will have, or are perceived to have a behavioral, mental health, \n20  intellectual and/or developmental disability, and who have been, are, or \n21  will  be  placed  in  a  secure  facility,  medium-secure  facility,  or  RTC \n22  because of such disability or perceived disability; or \n23  (f)  who have, will have, or are perceived to have a behavioral, mental health, \n24  intellectual and/or developmental disability, and whose release has been, \n25  is,  or  will  be  delayed  or  obstructed  because  of  such  disability  or \n26  perceived disability. \n27 \n28 \n29  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 32 of 59   Page ID #:3084\n1  97.  The exact size of the proposed class is unknown, but likely includes \n2  hundreds of children. The size of the class is so numerous that joinder of all members \n3  is impracticable.  \n4  98.  The claims of Plaintiffs and those of the proposed class members raise \n5  common questions of law and fact concerning whether Defendants’ policies and \n6  practices relating to the release, placement, treatment, and legal representation of \n7  detained immigrant children are consistent with the Flores Settlement, § 235 of the \n8  TVPRA,  the  Fifth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution,  the  First \n9  Amendment of the Constitution, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. These \n10  questions are common to the named Plaintiffs and the members of the proposed class \n11  because  Defendants  have  acted  and  will  continue  to  act  on  grounds  generally \n12  applicable to the named Plaintiffs and the proposed class members. Plaintiffs’ claims \n13  are typical of the class’s claims. \n14  99.  The  prosecution  of  separate  actions  by  individual  members  of  the \n15  proposed  class  would  create  a  risk  of  inconsistent  or  varying  adjudications \n16  establishing  incompatible  standards  of  conduct  for  Defendants.  Proposed  class \n17  members are predominantly indigent, non-English-speaking children who are being \n18  denied basic fairness and/or being discriminated against on the basis of disability in \n19  ORR’s  prolonging  their  detention  in  lieu  of  releasing  them  to  parents  or  other \n20  proposed  custodians,  “stepped  up”  to  RTC,  secure  or  medium-secure  placement \n21  without notice or opportunity to be heard and/or on the basis of disability, and \n22  administered psychotropic medications without a parent’s informed consent. The \n23  proposed  class  members  are  under  ORR’s  exclusive  physical  control  and  often \n24  understand little, if anything, about their rights under the Flores Settlement, the \n25  TVPRA, the Constitution, or Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. ORR actively \n26  obstructs  lawyers  from  representing  members  of  the  proposed  class  in  legal \n27  proceedings relating to custody, placement, or release. Unless this matter proceeds as \n28 \n30  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 33 of 59   Page ID #:3085\n1  a class action, the majority of class members have little chance of securing judicial \n2  review of the policies and practices challenged herein. \n3  100.  Defendants, their agents, employees, and predecessors and successors in \n4  office have acted or refused to act, and will continue to act or refuse to act, on grounds \n5  generally applicable to the class, thereby making injunctive relief and corresponding \n6  declaratory relief appropriate with respect to the class as a whole. Plaintiffs will \n7  vigorously represent the interests of unnamed class members. All members of the \n8  proposed class will benefit by this action. The interests of the named Plaintiffs and \n9  those of the proposed class members are identical.   \n10  101.  Plaintiffs  are  represented  by  experienced  and  reputable  lawyers \n11  associated with non-profit public interest law firms and an international law firm \n12  serving  pro  bono  publico.  Plaintiffs’  counsel  includes  attorneys  with  years  of \n13  experience litigating complex suits and class actions on behalf of children and foreign \n14  nationals, including counsel for the plaintiff class in Flores v. Sessions. \n15  VI. \n16  ORR POLICY & PRACTICE VIOLATES DUE PROCESS \n17  A.  Defendants have violated Plaintiffs’ due process and family association rights, \n18  the TVPRA, and the Flores Settlement in determining custodians’ fitness. \n19  102.  When children are held in government custody apart from their primary \n20  caregivers  for  long  periods,  they  suffer  profound  and  long-lasting  injury.  The \n21  American Academy of Pediatrics has explained that “highly stressful experiences, \n22  like  family  separation,  can  cause  irreparable  harm,  disrupting  a  child’s  brain \n23  architecture  and  affecting  his  or  her  short-  and  long-term  health.  This  type  of \n24  prolonged exposure to serious stress—known as toxic stress—can carry lifelong \n25  consequences for children.” Toxic stress is associated with increased rates of mental \n26  health issues, risky health behaviors, and physical illness such as diabetes, cancer, \n27  posttraumatic  stress  disorder  (“PTSD”),  and  heart  disease.  Studies  of  immigrant \n28 \n31  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 34 of 59   Page ID #:3086\n1  children detained in the United States have discovered high rates of PTSD, anxiety, \n2  depression, and suicidal ideation. A primary factor in recovering from such trauma is \n3  reunification with a parent or other trusted adult. Without the presence of trusted \n4  caregivers, children are often unable to cope with the psychological trauma and stress \n5  associated with detention. \n6  103.  Paragraph 14 of the Flores Settlement requires ORR to release children \n7  from  immigration-related  custody  “without  unnecessary  delay”  so  long  as  their \n8  continued detention is not required to secure availability for removal or to protect \n9  safety. Paragraph 18 of the Settlement requires ORR to make “prompt and continuous \n10  efforts” toward family reunifications and to release children to suitable custodians \n11  without unnecessary delay.  \n12  104.  Similarly,  §  235(c)(2)(A)  of  the  TVPRA,  codified  at  8  U.S.C. \n13  1232(c)(2)(A), requires ORR to “promptly” place detained children “in the least \n14  restrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child,” generally, with “a suitable \n15  family member . . . .” TVPRA § 235(c)(3)(A) provides, “[A]n unaccompanied alien \n16  child may not be placed with a person or entity unless the Secretary of Health and \n17  Human Services makes a determination that the proposed custodian is capable of \n18  providing for the child’s physical and mental well-being.” \n19  105.  Paragraph 24A of the Flores Settlement guarantees detained children the \n20  right to a hearing during which an immigration judge reviews whether they may be \n21  continued in custody because they are dangerous or unusually likely to abscond. \n22  However, neither the Flores Settlement nor the TVPRA prescribe what process is due \n23  where ORR unreasonably prolongs a juvenile’s detention or refuses to release him or \n24  her because ORR questions whether an available parent or other potential custodian \n25  is capable of providing for the child’s physical and mental well-being.  \n26  106.  Plaintiffs have substantial liberty interests in being free from government \n27  custody, in preserving their family unity and the ability for their family to care for \n28 \n32  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 35 of 59   Page ID #:3087\n1  them, and in family association. Defendants may not abridge these liberty interests \n2  without appropriate procedures to protect against erroneous deprivation. \n3  107.  Plaintiffs have a fundamental right to the supervision, companionship, \n4  and care of their parents. Absent a showing of parental unfitness, the government may \n5  not keep children from their parents or refuse to release children into the custody of \n6  their parents.  \n7  108.  As a matter of both policy and practice, ORR does not make prompt and \n8  continuous  efforts  toward  family  reunification  and  the  release  of  children  in  its \n9  custody. Instead, it delays or refuses to make determinations about whether proposed \n10  custodians are or may be unfit.    \n11  109.  As a matter of both policy and practice, ORR affords Plaintiffs and their \n12  proposed class members little or no procedural protection against prolonged detention \n13  on the ground that their parents or other proposed custodians are or may be unfit. \n14  ORR’s nominal procedures for vetting detained children’s parents or other proposed \n15  custodians do not appear in the Code of Federal Regulations, nor even in a semi-\n16  permanent  practice  manual.  Rather,  they  appear  on  ORR’s  web  page, \n17  www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/resource/children-entering-the-united-states-unaccompanied-\n18  section-2 (last visited September 7, 2018), and are subject to change without prior \n19  notice or opportunity for comment. Under its nominal procedures — \n20  (a)  ORR does not decide within any time certain whether a detained minor’s \n21  parent or other proposed custodian is suitable;  \n22  (b)  ORR does not provide a detained minor, or his or her parent or other \n23  proposed  custodian,  an  opportunity  to  inspect  or  rebut  evidence \n24  derogatory of the proposed custodian’s fitness;  \n25  (c)  ORR does not afford a detained minor or his or her proposed custodian \n26  a hearing before a neutral and detached decisionmaker either before or \n27  after ORR declares a potential custodian unfit;  \n28 \n33  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 36 of 59   Page ID #:3088\n1  (d)  Once ORR decides a proposed custodian is unsuitable, it need not inform \n2  a detained minor or the proposed custodian of its decision for up to 30 \n3  days;  \n4  (e)  ORR allows detained minors no appeal or other administrative recourse \n5  from its finding a proposed custodian unsuitable, though such a decision \n6  nearly always prolongs the minor’s detention;  \n7  (f)  Except for parents and legal guardians, ORR allows rejected custodians \n8  no appeal from a decision declaring them unfit, which nearly always \n9  prolongs an affected minor’s detention;  \n10  (g)  As for parents and legal guardians, ORR’s policy requires them to submit \n11  a written request to HHS’s Assistant Secretary for Children and Families \n12  to be heard regarding ORR’s declaring them unfit, but a hearing need not \n13  be convened within any time certain.  \n14  110.  Whether a parent or other custodian is qualified to care for a child is a \n15  matter generally committed to state and local governments. Plaintiffs are informed \n16  and believe that in all fifty states and their subdivisions, children may not be detained \n17  for want of a qualified custodian without affording them and/or their parents or other \n18  potential custodians a prompt hearing before a judge or other neutral and detached \n19  decisionmaker,  during  which  allegations  of  unfitness  are  tested  via  trial-like \n20  procedures and any ensuing finding of unsuitability must be based on competent \n21  evidence. \n22  111.  In contrast, in refusing to release Plaintiffs and those similarly situated \n23  to parents and other available custodians on grounds of fitness, ORR provides neither \n24  Plaintiffs nor those similarly situated — \n25  (a)  an evidentiary hearing;  \n26  (b)  the right to review or rebut adverse witnesses and evidence;   \n27  (c)  appointed counsel, guardians ad litem, or interpreters;  \n28 \n34  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 37 of 59   Page ID #:3089\n1  (d)  a finding of suitability or lack thereof by a neutral and detached decision-\n2  maker under defined and consistent legal standards;  \n3  (e)  the right to a prompt determination of a proposed custodian’s fitness; or  \n4  (f)  the right to appeal administratively adverse decisions. \n5  112.  In practice, ORR often refuses to decide whether a detained child’s \n6  proposed  custodian  is  fit,  thereby  needlessly  prolonging  detention  and  family \n7  separation. \n8  113.  On information and belief, Plaintiffs allege that, to date, HHS’s Assistant \n9  Secretary for Children and Families has never convened an actual hearing before a \n10  neutral arbiter to review a decision by ORR declaring a detained child’s proposed \n11  custodian unsuitable. \n12  114.  ORR’s procedures for determining whether parents and other proposed \n13  custodians are suitable creates an unreasonable risk that Plaintiffs and those \n14  similarly situated will be erroneously — \n15  (a)  subjected to prolonged detention; \n16  (b)  placed in overly restrictive settings that are not in their best interests;  \n17  (c)  administered psychotropic medications; and  \n18  (d)  separated from parents and family.  \n19  115.  As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of  ORR’s  torpid,  opaque,  and \n20  perfunctory procedures for declaring detained children’s parents and other proposed \n21  custodians unsuitable, Plaintiffs and those similarly situated have been and will be \n22  erroneously— \n23  (a)  subjected to prolonged detention; \n24  (b)  placed in overly restrictive settings that are not in their best interests;  \n25  (c)  administered psychotropic medications; and  \n26  (d)  separated from parents and family.  \n27 \n28 \n35  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 38 of 59   Page ID #:3090\n1  116.  The government’s refusing to release children to their parents’ custody, \n2  or to the custody of adult siblings and other family members, deprives plaintiffs of \n3  their fundamental rights without any reasonable justification or legitimate purpose, \n4  violates the substantive and procedural components of the Due Process Clause, and \n5  violates the freedom of association clause of the First Amendment. In prolonging the \n6  separation of children from their proposed custodians, Defendants also compromise \n7  the short and long-term health of Plaintiffs and those similarly situated.  \n8  B.  Defendants have violated Plaintiffs’ due process rights, the TVPRA, and the \n9  Flores Settlement by placing them in unlicensed placements. \n10  117.  Definition 6 and paragraph 19 of the Flores Settlement require ORR to \n11  place a detained child in a non-secure facility holding a state license to care for \n12  dependent children except in circumstances enumerated in Settlement paragraph 21: \n13  i.e.,  the  child  has  committed  a  violent  crime  or  non-petty  delinquent  act,  has \n14  threatened  violence  during  federal  custody,  is  an  unusual  escape-risk,  or  is  so \n15  disruptive that secure confinement is necessary to ensure the welfare of the minor or \n16  others. \n17  118.  Section 235(c)(2)(A) of the TVPRA similarly requires ORR to place \n18  detained children promptly “in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interest \n19  of the child . . .” and bars its placing a child “in a secure facility absent a determination \n20  that the child poses a danger to self or others or has been charged with having \n21  committed a criminal offense.”  \n22  119.  TVPRA § 235(c)(2)(A) provides, “The placement of a child in a secure \n23  facility shall be reviewed, at a minimum, on a monthly basis, in accordance with \n24  procedures  prescribed  by  the  Secretary,  to  determine  if  such  placement  remains \n25  warranted.” The TVPRA is otherwise silent with respect to what process is due when \n26  ORR places or continues a child in an RTC, medium-secure or secure facility.   \n27 \n28 \n36  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 39 of 59   Page ID #:3091\n1  120.  Federal law and policy recognize that both children and communities are \n2  better off when children are not needlessly incarcerated. A vast body of research has \n3  established  that  detaining  children  interferes  with  healthy  development,  exposes \n4  youth  to  abuse,  undermines  educational  attainment,  makes  children  with  mental \n5  health  needs  worse  off,  and  puts  children  at  greater  risk  of  self-harm.  Juvenile \n6  detention facilities often respond to threats of self-harm in ways that further endanger \n7  youth,  such  as  by  placing  them  in  isolation.  Schooling  children  receive  during \n8  detention is often substandard, which places them at serious disadvantage when they \n9  enter  school  after  having  been  detained  for  substantial  periods.  Research  has \n10  demonstrated that incarceration also exacerbates pre-existing trauma.  \n11  121.  The vast majority of children who end up in secure custody through ORR \n12  have never been charged, let alone convicted, of crimes in the U.S. or in their home \n13  country. Often, ORR places the most vulnerable children—those with the greatest \n14  mental health needs—in medium secure, secure or RTC facilities. Prolonging the \n15  detention  of  children  with  mental  health  needs  in  such  facilities  is  profoundly \n16  injurious. ORR’s detaining children in such facilities exacerbates mental health issues \n17  to the point that ORR eventually consigns children to mental hospitals. \n18  122.  The Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause protects children’s freedom \n19  from unnecessary physical restraint, including placement in RTCs, medium-secure or \n20  secure facilities.  ORR’s placing children in such facilities is constrained by due \n21  process,  which  requires  adequate  procedural  protections  to  ensure  that  ORR’s \n22  asserted  justification  for  such  placement  outweighs  children’s  constitutionally \n23  protected interest in avoiding excessive physical restraint. Due process requires that \n24  ORR give Plaintiffs and their proposed class members meaningful notice and an \n25  opportunity to be heard before it places them in RTCs, medium-secure or secure \n26  facilities and an ongoing review with commensurate protections every thirty days.   \n27 \n28 \n37  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 40 of 59   Page ID #:3092\n1  123.  As a matter of policy and practice, Defendant ORR affords detained \n2  children wholly inadequate procedural protection against erroneous placement in \n3  RTCs, secure or medium-secure facilities. ORR’s procedures for initially placing a \n4  child in an RTC, secure or medium-secure facility and for periodically reviewing the \n5  need for such placements appear nowhere in the Code of Federal Regulations. Rather, \n6  they appear on ORR’s web page and are subject to change without prior notice or \n7  opportunity for public comment.  \n8  124.  In practice, ORR’s placing children in RTCs, secure or medium-secure \n9  facilities  results  from  an  opaque  and  peremptory  process  in  which  youth  are \n10  summarily “stepped up” to such facilities without any meaningful opportunity to be \n11  heard, either before or after being stepped up, regarding the reasons for placing them \n12  in such facilities. In placing children in RTCs, secure and medium-secure facilities, \n13  ORR provides neither Plaintiffs nor those similarly situated — \n14  (a)  an evidentiary hearing;  \n15  (b)  notice of the placement decision or individualized reasoning therefor; \n16  (c)  an opportunity to present evidence and witnesses; \n17  (d)  the right to a neutral adjudicator; \n18  (e)  an opportunity to review or rebut adverse witnesses and evidence;   \n19  (f)  the right to counsel, guardians ad litem, or interpreters;  \n20  (g)  a finding of dangerousness or other adequate cause for such placement \n21  under coherent and consistent legal standards; \n22  (h)  the right to appeal administratively from adverse decisions; or  \n23  (i)  a monthly review of whether their placement in RTCs, medium-secure, \n24  or secure facilities remains warranted. \n25  125.  Pursuant to paragraph 24A of the Flores Settlement and orders issued by \n26  the District Court for the Central District of California, immigration judges may \n27  review ORR’s decisions to continue detaining children in federal custody on grounds \n28 \n38  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 41 of 59   Page ID #:3093\n1  they are dangerous or unusual flight-risks. ORR regularly places children in RTCs, \n2  secure and medium-secure facilities on the ground that they are dangerous or unusual \n3  flight-risks, contrary to immigration judges’ determinations that they are neither.  \n4  126.  Plaintiffs  are  informed  and  believe  that  in  all  fifty  states  and  their \n5  subdivisions, it is unlawful to place children in RTCs, secure or medium-secure \n6  facilities without affording them a prompt and meaningful opportunity to be heard \n7  before  a  neutral  and  detached  decisionmaker  regarding  the  grounds  for  such \n8  placement.  \n9  127.  The lack of procedural protection against erroneous ORR decisions to \n10  place children in RTCs, secure and medium-secure facilities creates an unreasonable \n11  risk that youth will be placed in overly restrictive settings against their best interests, \n12  subjected to needless restrictions on their personal liberty, and unjustly suffer the \n13  trauma and stigma of imprisonment. As a direct and proximate result of ORR’s \n14  peremptorily  consigning  children  to  RTCs,  secure  and  medium-secure  facilities, \n15  Plaintiffs and their proposed class members have been and are being erroneously: \n16  (a) placed in restrictive settings against their best interests; (b) subjected to excessive \n17  restrictions on their personal liberty; and (c) subjected to the trauma and stigma of \n18  imprisonment. \n19  128.  Placement in RTCs, secure and medium-secure facilities further injures \n20  Plaintiffs and those similarly situated because ORR, as a matter of policy and practice, \n21  delays release to parents and other reputable custodians of youth whom it has ever \n22  confined  in  such  facilities,  even  when  such  placement  is  based  on  incomplete, \n23  inaccurate, or erroneous evidence, and even if ORR subsequently transfers a child to \n24  a non-secure dependent care facility.  \n25  129.  As a matter of policy and practice, ORR has refused to release children \n26  whom it has ever placed in a secure or medium-secure facility until and unless its \n27  director  or  his  designee  approves  release.  In  practice,  this  policy  prolongs  non-\n28 \n39  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 42 of 59   Page ID #:3094\n1  dangerous children’s detention for weeks or months notwithstanding that parents or \n2  other reputable custodians are available to care for them.   \n3  130.  As a matter of policy and practice, ORR refuses to release children whom \n4  it has placed in RTCs until and unless RTC medical personnel declare the child \n5  mentally  fit.  ORR  affords  children  no  hearing  or  other  meaningful  procedural \n6  recourse when RTC medical personnel refuse to declare them mentally fit. As a direct \n7  and proximate result of said policy and practice, children placed in RTCs suffer the \n8  functional equivalent of indefinite civil commitment without due process of law. \n9  131.  On information and belief, Plaintiffs further allege that ORR regularly \n10  insists that the parents and other potential custodians possess novel and superfluous \n11  qualifications to receive custody of children whom ORR has ever placed in an RTC, \n12  secure  or  medium-secure  facility.  Such  qualifications  include  being  cancer-free, \n13  having  income  sufficient  to  supply  released  children  with  psychotropic  drugs, \n14  repetitive fingerprinting, and supplying fingerprints of third parties who do not reside \n15  in the proposed custodian’s home. As a direct and proximate result of said policy and \n16  practice, children placed in RTCs, secure and medium-secure facilities have been and \n17  are being erroneously: (a) placed in restrictive settings against their best interests; and \n18  (b) subjected to excessive restrictions on their personal liberty. \n19  C.  Defendants have subjected  Plaintiffs to  the administration  of psychotropic \n20  drugs  without  having  procedural  safeguards  in  place,  including  obtaining \n21  informed consent. \n22  132.  Paragraph 7 of the Flores Settlement provides in pertinent part: “The \n23  INS shall assess minors to determine if they have special needs ….” A child may have \n24  special needs “due to drug or alcohol abuse, serious emotional disturbance, mental \n25  illness or retardation, or a physical condition or chronic illness that requires special \n26  services or treatment.” Paragraph 12 of the Flores Settlement provides in pertinent \n27  part: “Following arrest, the INS shall hold minors in facilities that are safe and sanitary \n28 \n40  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 43 of 59   Page ID #:3095\n1  and that are consistent with the INS’s concern for the particular vulnerability of \n2  minors.” The Flores Settlement further provides that facilities in which ORR places \n3  children with mental health needs must “meet those standards . . . set forth in Exhibit \n4  1.” Flores Settlement ¶¶ 6, 8. Exhibit 1 requires that licensed programs “comply with \n5  all applicable state child welfare laws and regulations . . . and shall provide or arrange \n6  for the following services for each minor in its care: . . . appropriate mental health \n7  interventions when necessary.” \n8  133.  Section 235(c)(2) of the TVPRA requires ORR to provide children in its \n9  custody with safe and secure placements. Placements that involve the unnecessary or \n10  coerced administration of psychotropic medications are neither “safe” nor “secure.” \n11  134.  The Flores Settlement incorporates by reference relevant law of the state \n12  in which children are placed and thereby requires ORR to comply with applicable \n13  child welfare laws and regulations when administering psychotropic medications to \n14  Plaintiffs and those similarly situated. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and on such \n15  basis allege, that the laws of all states in which ORR places Plaintiffs and those \n16  similarly situated require ORR to obtain informed parental consent or its lawful \n17  equivalent when administering psychotropic medications to minors. \n18  135.  For  example,  Texas  Administrative  Code  sections  748.2001(b), \n19  748.2253, 748.2255 require informed consent be provided prior to administering \n20  psychotropic  drugs  to  children  in  state  custody.  Texas  Family  Code  section \n21  266.004(a) provides that before children in the care of the Texas Department of \n22  Family and Protective Services may receive medical care, someone authorized by a \n23  court must provide consent.  \n24  136.  Similarly, California Welfare and Institutions Code sections 369.5(a)(1) \n25  and  739.5(a)(1)  provide  that  only  a  juvenile  court  may  lawfully  authorize  the \n26  administration of psychotropic medication to children who are in state custody, unless \n27 \n28 \n41  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 44 of 59   Page ID #:3096\n1  the juvenile court specifically authorizes a parent to do so after making specific \n2  findings regarding the parent’s fitness and capacity to do so.  \n3  137.  Plaintiffs and their proposed class members have a substantial liberty \n4  interest protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment in being free \n5  from the unauthorized and unnecessary administration of psychotropic medications.  \n6  Plaintiffs  are  entitled  to  constitutionally  sufficient  procedures  to  protect  against \n7  erroneous deprivation of this interest. \n8  138.  Psychotropic medications are powerful drugs that act on the central \n9  nervous system and affect cognition, emotions, and behavior. Such drugs should only \n10  be administered in combination with other mental health supports to treat specifically \n11  diagnosed  psychiatric  illnesses  and  mental  health  disorders.  Few  psychotropic \n12  medications have been approved by the FDA as safe and effective to treat children, \n13  and careful oversight and monitoring is accordingly required when children are given \n14  such drugs. Such medications should not be used as chemical straitjackets to control \n15  behavior.    \n16  139.  Serious, long-lasting adverse effects are common for individuals given \n17  psychotropic medications. The full risks of giving such drugs to children are not well \n18  understood,  although  psychotropics  are  known  to  cause  serious  and  sometimes \n19  irreversible side effects in adults, including psychosis, seizures, movement disorders, \n20  suicidal ideation, aggression, extreme weight gain, and organ damage. Increasing the \n21  number of psychotropic drugs children take concurrently increases the likelihood of \n22  adverse  reactions  and  long-term  side  effects.  Close  and  continuing  scrutiny  of \n23  children given such medications is therefore critical.  \n24  140.  As a matter of policy and practice, ORR authorizes and condones the \n25  administration  of  psychotropic  drugs  to  children  entirely  without  procedural \n26  safeguards, including informed parental consent. Rather, ORR authorizes detention \n27  facility staff to “consent” to the involuntary, long-term administration of psychotropic \n28 \n42  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 45 of 59   Page ID #:3097\n1  drugs to juveniles in their parents’ stead, even when such parents are readily available \n2  to ORR and/or the detention facility to give or withhold such consent.  \n3  141.  As  a  matter  of  policy  and  practice,  ORR  also  fails  to  provide  any \n4  substantial procedural safeguards against unnecessary or unauthorized administration \n5  of psychotropic drugs to children in its custody. At a minimum, such safeguards must \n6  include  a  neutral  decisionmaker’s  approval  of  the  initial  decision  to  administer \n7  psychotropics to a child, as well as periodic reviews to ensure that youth are not \n8  administered  psychotropic  medications  unnecessarily,  for  too  long,  at  harmful \n9  dosages or in harmful combinations.  \n10  142.  On information and belief, Plaintiffs allege that ORR failed to have any \n11  of  these  procedural  safeguards  in  place  prior  to  administering  psychotropic \n12  medications  to  the  named  Plaintiffs.  In  addition,  the  psychiatrist  who  currently \n13  prescribes psychotropic medications to children at ORR’s Shiloh RTC, Dr. Javier \n14  Ruíz-Nazario,  has  received  payments  from  drug  companies  that  manufacture \n15  psychotropic drugs given to children at Shiloh RTC. \n16  D.  Defendants have obstructed Plaintiffs’ access to counsel. \n17  143.  Paragraph 24A of the Flores Settlement requires ORR to give detained \n18  children a hearing before an immigration judge to review whether they are dangerous \n19  or  likely  to  abscond.  Settlement  paragraph  24D  provides  that  Defendants  must \n20  “promptly provide each minor not released with . . . the list of free legal services \n21  providers compiled pursuant to INS regulation . . . .” Exhibit 1, paragraph 14 of the \n22  Flores Settlement requires licensed facilities in which Defendants detain minors to \n23  provide “information regarding the availability of free legal assistance, the right to be \n24  represented by counsel at no expense to the government . . . .” Exhibit 6 of the Flores \n25  Settlement advises detained minors, “If you believe that you have not been properly \n26  placed or that you have been treated improperly, you may ask a federal judge to review \n27 \n28 \n43  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 46 of 59   Page ID #:3098\n1  your case. You may call a lawyer to help you do this. If you cannot afford a lawyer, \n2  you may call one from the list of free legal services given to you with this form.” \n3  144.  Section 235(c)(5) of the TVPRA directs Defendant HHS Secretary to \n4  “ensure, to the greatest extent practicable and consistent with section 292 of the \n5  Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. § 1362), that all unaccompanied alien \n6  children who are or have been in the custody of the Secretary or the Secretary of \n7  Homeland Security, and who are not [from contiguous countries], have counsel to \n8  represent  them  in  legal  proceedings  or  matters  and  protect  them  from \n9  mistreatment . . . .”  Section  279(b)(A)  of  the  HSA  makes  ORR  responsible  for \n10  “developing a plan to be submitted to Congress on how to ensure that qualified and \n11  independent legal counsel is timely appointed to represent the interests of each such \n12  [unaccompanied alien] child . . . .” Immigration regulations, including 8 C.F.R. \n13  §§ 287.3(c), 1003.62, 1240.10(a)(2) and 1292.1 et seq., generally guarantee Plaintiffs \n14  and their proposed class members the right to be represented by retained and pro bono \n15  counsel in proceedings before U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the \n16  Executive Office for Immigration Review. \n17  145.  In furtherance of TVPRA § 235(c)(5), Defendant HHS contracts with the \n18  Vera Institute of Justice (“VIJ”), a non-profit organization, to coordinate the delivery \n19  of free legal services to unaccompanied children from non-contiguous countries who \n20  are or have been in ORR custody. VIJ in turn subcontracts with non-profit legal aid \n21  providers  to  counsel  and  represent  such  children  in  applying  for  affirmative \n22  immigration benefits, such as asylum or Special Immigrant Juvenile Status, and in \n23  asserting other defenses against removal.  \n24  146.  In many regions of the country, VIJ-funded legal services providers are \n25  the only legal counsel available to juveniles in ORR custody. Plaintiffs and the \n26  members of the proposed class are almost uniformly indigent, speak little or no \n27  English, and have little or no ability to represent themselves in hearings pursuant to \n28 \n44  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 47 of 59   Page ID #:3099\n1  paragraph 24A of the Flores Settlement or in any other legal proceedings involving \n2  ORR’s custody, release, placement or medication decisions. \n3  147.  On  information  and  belief,  ORR  has  no  eligibility  standards  for \n4  providing VIJ-funded legal services to detained children. Rather, ORR exercises \n5  opaque and arbitrary discretion to prescribe those legal matters or proceedings in \n6  which VIJ-funded legal providers may represent detained children and those in which \n7  they may not.  \n8  148.  As a matter of policy and practice, ORR routinely bars VIJ-funded legal \n9  services providers from representing unaccompanied children from non-contiguous \n10  countries in legal proceedings involving ORR’s custody, release, placement, and \n11  medication decisions, even when such legal services providers have the time and \n12  desire to undertake such representation. \n13  149.  Legal proceedings involving ORR’s custody, release, placement, and \n14  medication decisions, including hearings pursuant to paragraph 24A of the Flores \n15  Settlement,  are  “legal  proceedings  or  matters”  within  the  meaning  of  TVPRA \n16  § 235(c)(5).  \n17  150.  By  blocking  VIJ-funded  legal  services  providers  from  representing \n18  children  in  legal  proceedings  involving  ORR’s  custody,  release,  placement  and \n19  medication decisions, ORR forces Plaintiffs and those similarly situated to fend for \n20  themselves in a complex and foreign adversarial legal system with little hope of \n21  prevailing.  Without  meaningful  access  to  counsel,  Plaintiffs  and  those  similarly \n22  situated are denied a fair chance of succeeding in legal challenges to ORR’s custody, \n23  release,  placement  and  medication  decisions  and,  a  fortiori,  suffer  prolonged \n24  detention and the harms extended confinement and family separation inflicts. ORR \n25  deprives youth of liberty for years, which is comparable to imprisonment for a felony \n26  conviction.  \n27 \n28 \n45  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 48 of 59   Page ID #:3100\n1  151.  In  blocking  Plaintiffs  and  those  similarly  situated  from  receiving \n2  assistance in legal matters and proceedings involving ORR’s custody, placement, \n3  medication, and release decisions, ORR acts arbitrarily, capriciously, abusively of \n4  discretion,  and  contrary  to  children’s  best  interests,  and  obstructs  lawyers  from \n5  discharging their duty of zealous representation. \n6  152.  As a direct and proximate result of ORR’s blocking VIJ-funded legal \n7  services providers from representing Plaintiffs and those similarly situated children \n8  in legal proceedings involving ORR’s custody, release, placement, or medication \n9  decisions, including hearings pursuant to paragraph 24A of the Flores Settlement, \n10  Plaintiffs  and  those  similarly  situated  are  being:  (a)  improperly  administered \n11  psychotropic drugs; (b) erroneously denied placement in the least restrictive setting \n12  that is in their best interest and appropriate to their needs; and (c) erroneously denied \n13  release to available custodians without unnecessary delay.  \n14  VII. \n15  A.  Defendants have violated Plaintiffs’ rights under Section 504 by unnecessarily \n16  placing them in restrictive settings on the basis of disability. \n17  153.  Under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794, “[n]o \n18  otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of her or \n19  his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be \n20  subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial \n21  assistance or under any program or activity conducted by any Executive agency . . . .” \n22  154.  Members of the Plaintiff class are qualified individuals with disabilities \n23  because they have, have a record of having, and/or are regarded as having a physical \n24  or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more major life activities, such \n25  as caring for one’s self, learning, and working, and because they are unaccompanied \n26  alien children whose placement, care, custody, and release is the responsibility of \n27  ORR. 45 C.F.R. § 84.3(j), (l). \n28 \n46  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 49 of 59   Page ID #:3101\n1  155.  ORR’s placement, care, custody, and release of immigrant children is a \n2  program or activity conducted by an Executive agency and which receives Federal \n3  financial assistance. \n4  156.  HHS regulations implementing Section 504 prohibit any entity receiving \n5  federal financial assistance from “[a]fford[ing] a qualified handicapped person an \n6  opportunity to participate in or benefit from [an] aid, benefit, or service that is not \n7  equal to that afforded others;” “[p]rovid[ing] a qualified handicapped person with an \n8  aid,  benefit,  or  service  that  is  not  as  effective  as  that  provided  to  others;” \n9  “[p]rovid[ing] different or separate aid, benefits, or services to handicapped persons \n10  or to any class of handicapped persons unless such action is necessary to provide \n11  qualified handicapped persons with aid, benefits, or services that are as effective as \n12  those provided to others;” and “[o]therwise limit[ing] a qualified handicapped person \n13  in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others \n14  receiving an aid, benefit, or service.” 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(1)(ii), (iii), (iv), (vii). \n15  157.  The aids, benefits, and services ORR provides to immigrant children \n16  need not “produce the identical result . . . for handicapped and nonhandicapped \n17  persons, but [they] must afford handicapped persons equal opportunity to obtain the \n18  same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement, in \n19  the most integrated setting appropriate to the person’s needs.” 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(2). \n20  158.  Upon information and belief, as a matter of both policy and practice, \n21  ORR is not equipped to provide even minimal mental health services or supports to \n22  children it places in most shelters. \n23  159.  As a matter of both policy and practice, ORR therefore steps up children \n24  who need such services and supports, or whom shelter staff believe need such services \n25  and supports, to more restrictive placements, including secure facilities, medium \n26  secure facilities, or RTCs. ORR licenses only two RTCs in the entire country, so such \n27 \n28 \n47  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 50 of 59   Page ID #:3102\n1  a placement often results in ORR abruptly separating young people with mental health \n2  needs or perceived needs from their peers and transporting them across the country.  \n3  160.  ORR  steps  up  some  children  with  minimal  mental  health  needs, \n4  including children who require counseling or medication management that could be \n5  effectively provided in a shelter setting. \n6  161.  Members of the Plaintiff class who have or are perceived to have a \n7  behavioral, mental health, intellectual, and/or developmental disability and whose \n8  needs therefore exceed or are perceived to exceed the resources of ORR shelters are \n9  consequently segregated from their non-disabled peers on the basis of their disabilities \n10  and are unnecessarily placed in restrictive settings, instead of the most integrated \n11  setting appropriate to their needs. \n12  162.  In  warehousing  youth  with  disabilities  in  secure  facilities,  medium \n13  secure facilities, and RTCs, instead of providing them appropriate mental health \n14  services  in  the  most  integrated  setting  appropriate  to  their  needs,  Defendants \n15  unlawfully discriminate against youth on the basis of disability in violation of Section \n16  504 of the Rehabilitation Act. \n17  B.  Defendants  have  violated  Plaintiffs’  rights  under  Section  504  by  delaying \n18  and/or obstructing their release because of disability. \n19  163.  Under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794, “[n]o \n20  otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of her or \n21  his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be \n22  subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial \n23  assistance or under any program or activity conducted by any Executive agency. . . .” \n24  164.  Members of the Plaintiff class are qualified individuals with disabilities \n25  because they have, have a record of having, and/or are regarded as having a physical \n26  or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more major life activities, such \n27  as caring for one’s self, learning, and working, and because they are unaccompanied \n28 \n48  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 51 of 59   Page ID #:3103\n1  alien children whose placement, care, custody, and release is the responsibility of \n2  ORR. 45 C.F.R. § 84.3(j), (l). \n3  165.  ORR’s placement, care, custody, and release of immigrant children is a \n4  program or activity conducted by an Executive agency and which receives Federal \n5  financial assistance. \n6  166.  HHS regulations implementing Section 504 prohibit any entity receiving \n7  federal financial assistance from “[a]fford[ing] a qualified handicapped person an \n8  opportunity to participate in or benefit from [an] aid, benefit, or service that is not \n9  equal to that afforded others;” “[p]rovid[ing] a qualified handicapped person with an \n10  aid,  benefit,  or  service  that  is  not  as  effective  as  that  provided  to  others;” \n11  “[p]rovid[ing] different or separate aid, benefits, or services to handicapped persons \n12  or to any class of handicapped persons unless such action is necessary to provide \n13  qualified handicapped persons with aid, benefits, or services that are as effective as \n14  those provided to others;” and “[o]therwise limit[ing] a qualified handicapped person \n15  in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others \n16  receiving an aid, benefit, or service.” 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(1)(ii), (iii), (iv), (vii). \n17  167.  “A  recipient  may  not,  directly  or  through  contractual  or  other \n18  arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration (i) that have the effect of \n19  subjecting qualified handicapped persons to discrimination on the basis of handicap, \n20  [or]  (ii)  that  have  the  purpose  or  effect  of  defeating  or  substantially  impairing \n21  accomplishment of the objectives of the recipient’s program or activity with respect \n22  to handicapped persons.” 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(4). \n23  168.  The methods of administration utilized by Defendants in providing for \n24  the placement, care, custody, and release of immigrant children discriminate on the \n25  basis  of  disability.  They  further  have  the  effect  of  substantially  impairing \n26  accomplishment of the objective of release to an appropriate sponsor with respect to \n27  children with disabilities. \n28 \n49  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 52 of 59   Page ID #:3104\n1  169.  Upon information and belief, as a matter of policy and practice, ORR is \n2  not equipped to provide even minimal mental health services or supports to children \n3  it places in most shelters. \n4  170.  As a matter of policy and practice, ORR steps up children who need \n5  mental health services and supports, or whom shelter staff believe need such services \n6  and supports, to more restrictive placements, including secure facilities, medium \n7  secure facilities, or RTCs. Members of the Plaintiff class who have or are perceived \n8  to have a behavioral, mental health, intellectual, and/or developmental disability are \n9  therefore placed in such restrictive placements on the basis of disability. \n10  171.  Placement in secure facilities, medium-secure facilities, or RTCs delays \n11  release to parents and other custodians of youth. \n12  172.  As a matter of policy and practice, ORR has refused to release children \n13  whom it has ever placed in a secure or medium secure facility until and unless its \n14  director or his designee approves release. In practice, this policy prolongs children’s \n15  detention for weeks or months even when parents or other reputable custodians are \n16  available to care for them. When children are placed in secure or medium secure \n17  facilities  because  of  disability,  this  policy  and  practice  results  in  the  prolonged \n18  detention and separation of children from their families on the basis of disability. \n19  173.  As a matter of policy and practice, ORR refuses to release children whom \n20  it has placed in RTCs until and unless RTC medical personnel declare the child \n21  mentally fit. When children are placed in RTCs because of disability, this policy and \n22  practice results in the prolonged separation of children from their families on the basis \n23  of disability. \n24  174.  On information and belief, Plaintiffs further allege that ORR regularly \n25  insists that the parents and other potential custodians possess novel and superfluous \n26  qualifications to receive custody of children whom ORR has ever placed in an RTC, \n27  secure, or medium secure facility. When children are placed in restrictive settings \n28 \n50  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 53 of 59   Page ID #:3105\n1  because of disability, such practices result in the prolonged separation of children \n2  from their families on the basis of disability. \n3  175.  Prolonged  detention  of  children  with  behavioral,  mental  health, \n4  intellectual, and/or developmental disabilities can exacerbate their disabilities and \n5  result in deterioration of their mental health. By placing children with disabilities in \n6  restrictive settings and prolonging their detention and separation from their families, \n7  Defendants  exacerbate  their  symptoms,  making  it  less  likely  that  they  will  be \n8  approved for release, and thereby further prolonging their detention. \n9  176.  Defendants’  methods  of  administration  therefore  have  the  effect  of \n10  discriminating  against  children  with  disabilities  and  substantially  impairing \n11  accomplishment of the objectives of ORR’s programs and activities with respect to \n12  such children in violation of Section 504. Defendants are subjecting children to \n13  prolonged detention and separation from their families based on their disabilities. \n14  177.  Defendants  fail  to  make  reasonable  accommodations  in  policies, \n15  practices, and procedures that are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of \n16  disability. Specifically, inter alia, Defendants fail to provide adequate and appropriate \n17  mental health services in an integrated setting; fail to implement trauma-sensitive \n18  policies and procedures for children with disabilities in ORR custody; and fail to \n19  afford children with disabilities access to counsel to challenge restrictive placements \n20  that prolong their detention.    \n21  VIII. \n22  IRREPARABLE INJURY \n23  178.  Plaintiffs have suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable harm \n24  because of Defendants’ policies and practices as challenged herein. ORR has deprived \n25  and will continue to deprive Plaintiffs and those similarly situated of their rights under \n26  the First and Fifth Amendments, the TVPRA, the Flores Settlement, and Section 504 \n27  of the Rehabilitation Act. ORR confines children to jail-like settings without affording \n28 \n51  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 54 of 59   Page ID #:3106\n1  them a meaningful or timely opportunity to be heard regarding the reasons for such \n2  placement; prolongs children’s detention on the ground that their parents or other \n3  available custodians are or may be unfit, while affording neither detained children nor \n4  their proposed custodians a meaningful or timely opportunity to be heard regarding a \n5  proposed custodian’s fitness; places children in facilities in which it knows they will \n6  be administered powerful psychotropic medications without procedural safeguards; \n7  blocks  lawyers  from  representing  detained  children  with  respect  to  placement, \n8  administration  of  psychotropic  medications,  or  release  to  available  custodians; \n9  unnecessarily places youth in restrictive settings on the basis of disability; and delays \n10  and/or obstructs their release on the basis of disability. In doing so, Defendants have \n11  profoundly undermined the health and well-being of Plaintiffs and those similarly \n12  situated along multiple domains, as described above.  \n13  IX. \n14  FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n15  [DENIAL OF DUE PROCESS: DETERMINING CUSTODIANS’ FITNESS] \n16  179.  Plaintiffs  hereby  incorporate  by  reference  Paragraphs  1-178  of  this \n17  Complaint as though fully set forth here. \n18  180.  As  a  matter  of  policy  and  practice  Defendants  unreasonably  and \n19  unnecessarily delay or refuse to release children to parents, close family members, \n20  and other available custodians on the ostensible grounds that such custodians are or \n21  may be unfit, and they do so without affording detained minors or their proposed \n22  custodians a timely, prompt, or meaningful opportunity to be heard regarding such \n23  custodians’ fitness. Defendants’ policies and practices violate the fundamental rights \n24  of Plaintiffs and those similarly situated and demonstrate a deliberate indifference to \n25  risk of harm to children. \n26  181.  Such policy and practice individually and collectively violate paragraphs \n27  14 and 18 of the Flores Settlement, TVPRA § 235(c)(2)(A), the Administrative \n28 \n52  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 55 of 59   Page ID #:3107\n1  Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq., the procedural and substantive components \n2  of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, \n3  and the Freedom of Association Clause of the First Amendment of the United States \n4  Constitution. \n5  X. \n6  SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n7  [DENIAL OF DUE PROCESS: RESTRICTIVE PLACEMENT] \n8  182.  Plaintiffs  hereby  incorporate  by  reference  Paragraphs  1-178  of  this \n9  Complaint as though fully set forth here. \n10  183.  As a matter of policy and practice, Defendants place Plaintiffs and those \n11  similarly situated in RTCs, secure facilities, and medium-secure facilities without \n12  affording them a meaningful opportunity to be heard either prior or subsequent to \n13  such placement.   \n14  184.  Such policy and practice individually and collectively violate Definition \n15  6  and  paragraph  19  of  the  Flores  Settlement,  TVPRA  §  235(c)(2)(A),  the \n16  Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq., and the Due Process Clause \n17  of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n18  XI. \n19  THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n20  [UNLAWFUL ADMINISTRATION OF PSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS] \n21  185.  Plaintiffs  hereby  incorporate  by  reference  Paragraphs  1-178  of  this \n22  Complaint as though fully set forth here. \n23  186.  As  a  matter  of  policy  and  practice,  Defendants  administer  children \n24  psychotropic drugs without procedural safeguards, including: obtaining informed \n25  consent or the lawful equivalent; involving a neutral decision maker in the initial \n26  determination of whether to prescribe psychotropic medications to children in ORR \n27  custody; and conducting a periodic review of such treatment decisions to ensure that \n28 \n53  Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \n   First Amended Complaint    L25o6s  AS.n Ogeclceisd, eCnAta l9 B0l0v5d7.  \n213/388-8693 \n \n \n\nCase 2:18 -cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 81   Filed 09/07/18   Page 56 of 59   Page ID #:3108\n1  youth are not administered psychotropic medications unnecessarily or at harmful \n2  dosage levels or in harmful combinations. \n3  187.  Such policy and practice individually and collectively violate paragraphs \n4  6,  8,  12,  and  19  and  Exhibit  1  of  the  Flores  Settlement,  the  TVPRA,  the \n5  Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 501 et seq., and the Due Process Clause \n6  of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  \n7  XII. \n8  FOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n9   [BLOCKING LEGAL ASSISTANCE IN MATTERS RELATING TO CUSTODY, \n10  MEDICATION AND RELEASE] \n11  188.  Plaintiffs  hereby  incorporate  by  reference  Paragraphs  1-178  of  this \n12  Complaint as though fully set forth here. \n13  189.  As a matter of policy and practice, ORR blocks VIJ-funded lawyers from \n14  representing Plaintiffs and those similarly situated in legal matters and proceedings \n15  involving ORR’s decisions regarding custody, release, medication, and placement.  \n16  190.  Such policy and practice individually and collectively violate paragraphs \n17  24A and 24D, Exhibit 1 paragraph 14, and Exhibit 6 of the Flores Settlement, TVPRA \n18  § 235(c)(5), HSA § 279(b)(A), 8 C.F.R. §§ 287.3(c), 1003.62, 1240.10(a)(2) and \n19  1292.1 et seq., the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 501 et seq., and the Due \n20  Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n21  XIII. \n22  FIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n23  [DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF DISABILITY] \n24  191.  Plaintiffs  hereby  incorporate  by  reference  Paragraphs  1-178  of  this \n25  Complaint as though fully set forth here. \n26  192.

As a matter of policy and practice, ORR delays or obstructs the release \n4  of Plaintiffs who have or are perceived to have behavioral, mental health, intellectual \n5  and/or  developmental  disabilities  to  parents,  close  family  members,  and  other \n6  available custodians because of their disabilities. \n7  194.

They may also assert that these funds will enable the UAC to be released quicker \nto the prospective sponsor.  ORR DOES NOT CHARGE ANY FEE TO PROSPECTIVE OR APPROVED \nSPONSORS AS A CONDITION OF RELEASE OF AN UNACCOMPANIED CHILD. ANY DEMAND FOR \nPAYMENT OF FEES IS NOT AUTHORIZED BY ORR AND SHOULD NOT BE PAID. \nFor example, an individual claiming to represent a charitable/non-profit organization may \ncontact a potential sponsor and say that s/he can assist in processing and reuniting an \nunaccompanied child with his or her family. In this scenario, the individual falsely tells the \npotential sponsor that s/he needs to pay a fee to obtain the release of the child from ORR \ncustody. Similarly, this individual may ask the potential sponsor to wire money to unknown \npersons in different cities. \nThis type of fraud is a serious crime and ORR fully cooperates with local and federal law \nenforcement for the investigation and prosecution of any individual(s) participating in the fraud \nscheme. If the fraud scheme involves care provider staff, ORR instructs the care provider to \ncontact local law enforcement and to follow its local licensing guidelines regarding reports of \ninappropriate employee behavior. The care provider should also inform its local licensing \nagency that the case was referred to HHS/OIG and local law enforcement for investigation. Care \nproviders should have internal protocols in place to address fraud schemes. A care provider \nfacility must take disciplinary action including termination of any staff for criminal behavior, \nincluding fraud. \nCare providers must take steps to: \n1)  Prevent these or other fraudulent practices by notifying all potential sponsors that ORR, \nits care providers, volunteer agencies, and grantees/contractors do not collect or \nrequire fees for any services related to the release of unaccompanied children from HHS \ncustody. \n2)  Care providers should have written confirmation from staff members acknowledging the \n\"Fraud Scheme\" policy to be placed in employee files. \nDefendants' Prod.

Sponsors may \ncall the help line to inform ORR if a person defrauds or attempts to defraud them \nof money. \nCase managers should document any information they provide to a sponsor regarding \nthe reporting of suspicious contacts, to include the sponsor's identity, date, time and \nthe information provided. \n2.  Prior to every release, the case manager asks the sponsor if they have been contacted \nand asked to pay fees/money related to the release of the UC. If the answer is yes, \ngathers the following information, and documents the information that the potential \nsponsor provides on the Sponsor Information section: \n•  UC full name, alien number, and date of birth \n•  Time and date of the report \n•  Name of the ORR care provider facility and care provider address (include \ncity/state) \n•  Name, telephone number and location of the sponsor; \n•  Name, phone number, and other contact information given by the \nperson/program who filed the report \n•  Description of the event \no  Date and time of the alleged incident \no  If money was asked for from the sponsor \no  Whether money was actually paid by the sponsor \no  Amount and method of any payment made (e.g., wire transfer, money \norder) \nDefendants' Prod.

INTRODUCTION \n2  Plaintiffs  challenge  the  policies  and  practices  of  the  Office  of  Refugee \n3  Resettlement  (“ORR”)  that  prolong  immigrant  children’s  detention  under  harsh \n4  conditions, creating a continuum of trauma that vulnerable children—many of whom \n5  arrive in the United States after having suffered horrific trauma in their countries of \n6  origin—are ill-equipped to endure. Plaintiffs immigrated to the United States often \n7  fleeing violence, physical and sexual assault, and extreme poverty only to be detained \n8  by ORR for months, and sometimes years, while denied reunification with their parents, \n9  siblings, and other family members.  \n10  ORR prolongs children’s detention in ORR custody on the ground that their \n11  parents or other available custodians are or may be unfit, but affords neither detained \n12  children nor their proposed custodians any meaningful or timely opportunity to be heard \n13  regarding a proposed custodian’s fitness. Moreover, ORR “steps up” children from \n \n14  shelters to staff-secure, secure, and restrictive psychiatric facilities without even the \n15  most  rudimentary  procedural  protections.  Youth  housed  in  shelters  report  being \n16  awakened in the small hours of the morning and soon thereafter finding themselves \n17  confined  in  juvenile  detention  centers  or  psychiatric  facilities,  where  they  suffer \n18  irreparable harm inherent to confinement. ORR also undermines lawyers’ ability to \n19  represent detained children with respect to placement, administration of psychotropic \n20  medications,  or  release  to  available  custodians,  notwithstanding  that  Congress \n21  specifically directed ORR to “ensure, to the greatest extent practicable” that children \n22  who are or have been in its custody have legal representation in “legal proceedings or \n23  matters.” William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of \n24  2008, 8 U.S.C. § 1232(b)(5) (“TVPRA”). \n25  To protect children like Gabriela N., who was held in ORR custody for 633 days \n26  while ORR refused to release her to her grandfather, and Lucas R., who was refused \n27  release to his sister and brother for over 200 days, from severe and unnecessary harm \n28  upon arrival in the United States, Congress incorporated into federal law two bedrock \nCOOLEY LLP  MEM.

Barr, No. 2:85-cv-04544-DMG (C.D. Cal.) \n2  (“FSA”): (1) ORR must release children to parents or other qualified custodians without \n3  unnecessary delay; and (2) ORR must place children in the “least restrictive” setting for \n4  however long it detains them. See 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(2)(a). The FSA and TVPRA—\n5  along with the Constitution—provide substantive rights to Class Members entitled to \n6  procedural protection. (See ECF No. 141 at 11-15.) \n7  However, neither the TVPRA nor the FSA prescribes procedures pursuant to \n8  which Defendants must transparently and rationally determine: (1) whether children’s \n9  parents or other available custodians are fit; or (2) whether a child may be consigned to \n10  a restrictive placement. This procedural vacuum has necessitated numerous motions to \n11  enforce the FSA, and prompted this Court to convene multiple conferences, and order \n12  ORR “for the umpteenth time . . . to abide by the FSA.” Flores v. Barr, No. 2:85-cv-\n13  04544-DMG-AGR, ECF No. 768 at 3 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 10, 2020). Absent meaningful \n \n14  process to determine whether ORR is unnecessarily detaining children or placing them \n15  in restrictive facilities, Plaintiffs must continue to resort to judicial enforcement of the \n16  substantive provisions of the TVPRA and FSA.  \n17  ORR’s unnecessary delay and refusal to release children to qualified custodians \n18  inflicts grievous injury. And as days  of detention stretch into weeks and  months, \n19  frustration and trauma often culminate in behaviors indicative of their deteriorating \n20  emotional state. When this happens, instead of considering the mental and other health \n21  needs of the child, ORR “step-ups” children to even more restrictive settings, often \n22  exacerbating the child’s needs. Once stepped up, Defendants’ own data shows that \n23  children spend weeks or months longer in detention than those who are not stepped up.  \n24  ORR justifies this vicious cycle as a byproduct of its duty to protect children from \n25  abuse or neglect. However, the uncontroverted evidence shows that, inter alia: \n26 \n•  ORR prescribes no limit on how long it may take to decide whether a proposed \n27  custodian is fit;  \n28  •  ORR grants its staff and contractors broad discretion to invent requirements and \nCOOLEY LLP  MEM.

If children’s substantive rights under the TVPRA, FSA, and Constitution are \n16  to mean anything at all, more process than none is due. Accordingly, Plaintiffs request \n17  that the Court enter judgment for Plaintiffs on their First (Custodians’ fitness), Second \n18  (Restrictive Placement), and Fourth (Obstructing Legal Assistance) Claims for Relief. \n19  II.  PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n20  A.  Procedural Background \n21  On June 29, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a complaint for injunctive relief, declaratory \n22  relief, and nominal damages, challenging certain unlawful policies and practices of \n23  ORR, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) \n24  that has responsibility for the placement, care, custody and release of “unaccompanied \n25  alien children.” 6 U.S.C. § 279; 8 U.S.C. § 1232; ECF No. 1. On September 7, 2018, \n26  Plaintiffs filed the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”). (ECF No. 81.) On December 27, \n27  2018,  the  Court  issued  an  amended  order  granting  in  part  and  denying  in  part \n28 \nCOOLEY LLP  MEM.

As relevant here, the Court certified the following classes: \n3  •  Minors in ORR custody “who are or will be placed in a secure facility, medium-\nsecure facility, or RTC, or whom ORR has continued to detain in any such facility \n4  for more than 30 days, without being afforded notice and an opportunity to be \nheard before a neutral and detached decisionmaker regarding the grounds for \n5  such placement (i.e., the ‘step-up class’)”; \n \n6  •  Minors in ORR custody “whom ORR is refusing or will refuse to release to \nparents or other available custodians within 30 days of the proposed custodian’s \n7  submission of a complete family reunification packet on the ground that the \nproposed custodian is or may be unfit (i.e., the ‘unfit custodian class’)”; and \n8   \n•  Minors in ORR custody “who are natives of non-contiguous countries and to \n9  whom ORR is impeding or will impede legal assistance in legal matters or \nproceedings involving their custody, placement, release, and/or administration of \n10  psychotropic drugs (i.e., the ‘legal representation class’).” \n11  (Id. at 27–28.)1 \n12  The Court also made several findings relevant to the instant motion. First, the \n13  Court allowed Plaintiffs to proceed with “due process claims predicated on Defendants’ \n \n14  failure to provide sufficient procedural safeguards for alien minors to exercise their \n15  Flores rights because Plaintiffs cannot bring those claims in the Flores Action.” (Id. at \n16  10–11.) Second, the Court concluded that ORR’s policies and practices “constitute final \n17  agency actions such that Plaintiffs may raise their TVPRA claims under the APA.” (Id. \n18  at 11–12.) Third, the Court found that Plaintiffs “identified . . . substantive rights \n19  underlying their procedural due process claims” arising under the Constitution, the \n20  TVPRA, and the FSA. (Id. at 13–15.) Fourth, the Court rejected Defendants’ argument \n21  that  children  in  ORR  custody,  as  undocumented  minors,  are  not  entitled  to  any \n22  procedural protections beyond those explicitly provided by Congress. (Id. at 13, 15.)  \n23  B.  Determining Custodians’ Fitness (First Claim for Relief) \n24  Many of the named Plaintiffs and Class Members have endured unnecessary and \n25  prolonged detainments in ORR custody, separated from their families, often leading to \n                                         \n26 \n1 The Court certified two additional classes of minors related to Plaintiffs’ Third and \n27  Fifth Claims for Relief, which are not at issue in this motion.

Gabriela N. was in ORR \n2  congregate care for 633 days;2 Lucas R. was in ORR custody for 208 days; and one \n3  Class Member remained in ORR custody for at least 1,570 days—or more than four \n4  years. (Statement of Uncontroverted Facts and Conclusions of Law in Support of \n5  Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (“SUF”) ¶¶ 26–27.) As of March 13, \n6  2020, there were approximately 1,193 children in ORR custody who had been detained \n7  by ORR for more than 30 days. (SUF ¶ 23.) \n8  It is indisputable that detention and family separation are detrimental to the well-\n9  being of children, as demonstrated by the psychological harm suffered by Plaintiffs. \n10  (See, e.g., SUF ¶ 17 (Lucas R. had trouble sleeping and psychological issues until \n11  reunified with his brother); SUF ¶ 18 (Sirena P.’s separation from her family was noted \n12  as a trigger to her mental health symptoms); SUF ¶ 19 (Benjamin F.’s separation from \n13  his  mother  and  placement  in  ORR’s  legal  custody  led  to  physical  and  emotional \n \n14  challenges).3 Notwithstanding this demonstrated harm, ORR’s policies fail to provide \n15  adequate procedural protections to guard against unnecessary and prolonged detention. \n16  1.  ORR’s policies regarding custodial vetting. \n17  ORR’s command is clear: make “prompt and continuous efforts” toward family \n18  reunification  and  release  children  “without  unnecessary  delay.”  (SUF  ¶ 29.)  ORR \n19  releases children to potential custodians or “sponsors,” which include parents or legal \n20  guardians (Category 1 sponsors), immediate relatives (Category 2A/B sponsors), or \n21  more distant relatives and individuals (Category 3 sponsors). (SUF ¶ 30.) Cases with no \n22  identified sponsors are referred to as Category 4. (SUF ¶ 31.)4  \n                                         \n23 \n2 Plaintiff Gabriela N. has reached the age of majority since this action was filed and \n24 \nnow maintains this action on her own behalf, rather than through her next friend, Isaac \nN., who passed away in July 2020. \n25 \n3 Indeed, detention is correlated with both short-term and long-term adverse effects on \n26 \nchildren’s physical and mental health and well-being. (SUF ¶¶ 1–4.) \n27 \n4 Some children designated as Category 4 may have had identified sponsors that were \n28 \nCOOLEY LLP  MEM.

Case Managers are not federal employees but are employed \n4  by “care providers,” i.e., private facilities with which ORR enters into cooperative \n5  agreements to place and care for children in ORR custody. (SUF ¶ 274.) Case Managers \n6  are  responsible  for  assessing  potential  sponsors  and  making  transfer  and  release \n7  recommendations. (SUF ¶ 33.) Case Coordinators are non-governmental contractor \n8  field staff assigned to one or more care providers primarily to review children’s cases \n9  and provide transfer and release recommendations to ORR staff. (SUF ¶ 34.) Federal \n10  Field Specialists (“FFS”) are ORR field staff located regionally throughout the country \n11  with final decision-making authority to, inter alia, release a child to a proposed sponsor. \n12  (SUF ¶¶ 35, 37.) Although Case Managers are the first of three actors involved in \n13  release decisions, they also have unilateral authority to declare a potential sponsor “non-\n \n14  viable,” which ends the vetting process for that sponsor. (SUF ¶ 38.) \n15  ORR’s  written  policies  offer  a  broad  list  of  assessment  criteria  that  Case \n16  Managers, Case Coordinators, and FFS (“case staff”) may use to evaluate the fitness of \n17  potential sponsors. (SUF ¶ 59.) For example, the only requirements for ordering a \n18  discretionary home study are that the sponsor be potentially viable and case staff “have \n19  a reasonable  expectation that results of the home study process . . . will provide \n20  additional information, other than what has already been gathered via the sponsor \n21  assessment process, which will mitigate concerns.” (SUF ¶ 45.) Prior to release, ORR \n22  may also conduct additional assessments of minors in custody, such as psychological \n23  evaluations. (SUF ¶ 52.) Yet ORR provides no written standards for when it may require \n24  a psychological evaluation as a prerequisite to release. (SUF ¶ 53.)    \n25  ORR fails to provide written notice of decisions denying release in all but the \n26  most limited circumstances. Only when ORR deems a Category 1 sponsor unfit, will it \n27 \n                                         \ndenied or deemed non-viable by ORR. (SUF ¶ 69.) \n28 \nCOOLEY LLP  MEM.

(SUF ¶ 72.) No other category of sponsor is entitled to \n2  written notification of the denial and reasons for that denial. (Id.) And only if the sole \n3  reason for denial  is a concern that the child may  be a danger to themself or the \n4  community, does ORR send the child a denial letter. (SUF ¶ 70.) No other child is \n5  entitled to written notification of the denial and reasons for that denial. (SUF ¶ 71.) \n6  Opportunities to challenge decisions denying release are similarly limited.  Only parents \n7  and legal guardians have a right to appeal; no other proposed sponsors have any \n8  opportunity to challenge a release denial. (SUF ¶ 79.) Children are only entitled to \n9  appeal an adverse decision if the sole reason for the denial is a concern that the child is \n10  a danger to themselves or the community. (SUF ¶¶ 77–78.) None of these criteria was \n11  true for Lucas R., which meant that neither he nor his sister, Madelyn R., were ever told \n12  why Madelyn’s sponsorship application was denied, which resulted in Lucas R. being \n13  detained in ORR custody awaiting reunification for 208 days. (SUF ¶¶ 26, 86–87.)  \n \n14  2.  ORR’s  policies  regarding  custodial  vetting  lack  basic \nprocedural protections. \n15 \n16  ORR’s policies confer enormous discretion on case staff to determine whether a \n17  child  can  be  released  from  federal  custody  without  any  of  the  basic  procedural \n18  protections afforded in analogous child welfare systems. These policies frequently \n19  change and none of the limited guidance provided to case staff concerning custodial \n20  vetting is published in the Federal Register or Notice of Proposed Rulemaking or \n21  otherwise made available for public comment. (SUF ¶ 63.) Moreover, the policies on \n22  their face fail to provide even the most basic procedural protections to children and their \n23  sponsors. For example, the policies: \n24 \n•  Fail to provide guidance on how to weigh information once collected or \nrequire  application  of  any  particular  standard—much  less  an  evidentiary \n25 \nstandard—when making release decisions (SUF ¶¶ 59, 61–62);  \n26 \n•  Fail to provide a hearing before a neutral factfinder to challenge a decision \ndenying release to a proposed custodian (SUF ¶ 74, 76); \n27 \n•  Fail to afford children the opportunity to review evidence relied upon in \n28 \nCOOLEY LLP  MEM.

Restrictive Placement (Second Claim for Relief) \n13 \nORR  is  responsible  for  the  placement,  care,  custody,  and  release  of \n \n14 \n“unaccompanied alien children.” 6 U.S.C. § 279; 8 U.S.C. § 1232. A child in ORR’s \n15 \ncustody “shall be promptly placed in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interest \n16 \nof the child” and “shall not be placed in a secure facility absent a determination that the \n17 \nchild poses a danger to self or others or has been charged with having committed a \n18 \ncriminal offense.” 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(2)(A).  \n19 \nDespite  this  Congressional  command,  ORR  detains  children  in  restrictive \n20 \nfacilities without affording them fundamental rights to hearings or any meaningful \n21 \nprocedural protections. Children may be placed in restrictive settings as: (1) an initial \n22 \nplacement upon transfer to ORR custody; or (2) when they are moved or “stepped up” \n23  from a lower level of care to a more restrictive placement. (SUF ¶¶ 102–03, 105.)5 ORR \n24 \nhas a network of available placements, which include shelters, short-term or transitional \n25 \nfoster care, long-term foster care, group homes, therapeutic group homes, staff-secure, \n26 \n                                         \n27  5 Children can also be moved from a more restrictive to a less restrictive level of care. \nThis is referred to as a “step-down.” (SUF ¶ 106.) \n28 \nCOOLEY LLP  MEM.

(SUF \n2  ¶¶ 101, 107–08.) ORR also detains children in a number of out-of-network (“OON”) \n3  facilities, some of which are RTCs. (SUF ¶ 108.)6  \n4  ORR regularly “steps up” Class Members. (SUF ¶ 104.) As of March 13, 2020, \n5  14 of the total 3,621 children in ORR in-network care were detained in a secure facility; \n6  17 were detained in a RTC; 30 were detained in a staff-secure facility; 6 were detained \n7  in a therapeutic staff-secure facility; and 13 were detained in therapeutic group homes. \n8  (SUF ¶ 223.) As of that same date, 11 children were detained in out-of-network RTCs. \n9  (SUF ¶ 224.) The longer ORR detains a child, the more likely they will be stepped up \n10  to a restrictive placement. (SUF ¶ 115.) \n11  Secure  juvenile  detention  facilities,  which  ORR  concedes  “have  a  secure \n12  perimeter, major constraining construction inside the facility, and procedures typically \n13  associated with correctional facilities,” are the most restrictive facilities in ORR’s \n \n14  network.  (SUF  ¶¶ 129,  117.)7  Secure  facilities—which  have  been  compared  to \n15  “prisons” and “jails” by ORR’s own staff (SUF ¶ 128)—are “locked facilities with \n16  24-hour surveillance and monitoring.” (SUF ¶ 131.) Children are detained alone in \n17  small cells with concrete beds layered with only a thin mattress and no pillow. (Ex. 82 \n18  [Y.A.M.S. Decl.] ¶¶ 29–30.)8 Children report being allowed out of their cells for only \n19  short periods of time and that the lights remain on through the night. (Ex. 137 [F.R.A.] \n20  Decl. ¶ 10 (“[At Yolo] they never turn out the lights. The lights stay on all night so you \n21  have to cover your head to try to sleep.”).) \n22                                           \n6 ORR’s Manual of Procedures (“MAP”) refers to OON RTC placements as Treatment \n23 \nAuthorization Request (“TAR”) RTC placements. (SUF ¶ 110.) \n24 \n7 Previously, ORR maintained three secure facilities: Yolo County Juvenile Center \n25  (“Yolo”),  Shenandoah  Valley  Juvenile  Center  (“SVJC”),  and  Northern  Virginia \nJuvenile Detention Center (“NOVA”). (SUF ¶ 119.) Presently, ORR only maintains one \n26 \nsecure facility: SVJC. (Id.) \n27  8 All exhibits cited are attached to the Declaration of Alexandra R.

(Ex. 137 [F.R.A. Decl.] ¶¶ 7–8 (child recounting staff throwing \n4  him on the ground and handcuffing him and witnessing another child being restrained \n5  so forcefully that his arm broke).) Children who have endured confinement in ORR’s \n6  juvenile detention centers describe being “treated like criminals” and made to “feel like \n7  an animal.” (Ex. 82 [Y.A.M.S. Decl.] ¶¶ 27, 29–30 (“It has been 11 months of misery \n8  [at Yolo]”—“a juvenile jail where we are kept in cells, forced to wear uniforms and \n9  treated like criminals. The detention center makes me feel like an animal.”).) \n10  RTCs are highly restrictive psychiatric facilities, which are similarly restrictive \n11  as secure facilities. (SUF ¶¶ 118, 127.)9 In addition to physical liberty restrictions (SUF \n12  ¶ 132), RTCs require children to undergo treatment prescribed by the respective facility \n13  (SUF ¶¶ 133, 134). As part of that treatment, children report being medicated against \n \n14  their will, including being forcibly injected with psychotropic medication. (SUF ¶¶ 133, \n15  134; Ex. 82 [Y.A.M.S. Decl.] ¶¶ 13–20 (recounting that staff would force the child’s \n16  mouth open if they tried to refuse to take the medication; “I felt like I had no one to help \n17  me and no option but to take the daily medication.”); Ex. 69 [K.N.A.T. Decl.] ¶ 11 \n18  (“The staff hold down and inject youth that aren’t able to calm down.”); Ex. 62 [D.S.J.L. \n19  Decl.] ¶ 11 (“Two staff grabbed me, and the doctor gave me an injection despite my \n20  objection and left me there on the bed.”).)  \n21  OON facilities are often RTCs that are similarly restrictive as in-network RTCs. \n22  (SUF ¶ 121.) Staff-secure, therapeutic staff-secure, and therapeutic group homes are \n23  less restrictive than RTCs and secure jails, but more restrictive than shelters. (SUF \n24  ¶¶ 122–23, 125; id. ¶ 135 (children in therapeutic staff-secure facilities may be required \n25  to undergo sex offender treatment); id. ¶ 124 (staff-secure  facilities can be gated, \n                                         \n26 \n9 ORR currently maintains two in-network RTCs: MercyFirst Residential Treatment \n27 \nCenter (“MercyFirst”) in Syosset, New York, and Shiloh Treatment Center (“Shiloh”) \nin Manvel, Texas.

Foster care programs are the least restrictive settings in \n2  which ORR places Class Members. (SUF ¶ 126.) ORR may consider each of these \n3  placements when determining the “least restrictive” environment for a child. \n4  It is unsurprising that the cumulative impact of confinement in ORR’s restrictive \n5  facilities are deleterious for a child’s psychological and emotional functioning. (SUF \n6  ¶ 1,  3-4,  136.)  Yet  children  who  then  manifest  behavioral  symptoms  of  mental \n7  decompensation are at risk of being detained even longer in a restrictive setting, or \n8  generally in ORR custody unless they show good behavior (SUF ¶¶ 68, 152), something \n9  that experts say may not be achievable. (See Ex. 56 [Matlow & Wang Expert Rep.] at \n10  1387 (“Due to the impact of traumatic stress on cognitive, emotional, and behavioral \n11  regulation skills . . . expectations for perfect behavior (i.e. no impulsive behavior, no \n12  defiant  behavior,  no  rule  breaking,  etc.)  over  extended  periods  of  time  are \n13  unrealistic.”).) This cruel cycle of indefinite detention exacerbates behaviors used to \n \n14  justify further detention. (Id. at 1389 (“Release or step-down requirements that depend \n15  upon  demonstration  of  emotional,  psychological,  or  behavioral  stability  are \n16  contradictory in that the facility setting itself is often the source of the child’s distress \n17  and dysregulation.”).)  \n18  Further problematic is that ORR evaluates this “good behavior” based on, among \n19  other things, the number of Special Incident Reports (“SIRs”) a child has received (SUF \n20  ¶ 153), yet the behaviors that trigger a SIR vary from program to program (SUF ¶ 154). \n21  Step-up can also further delay a child’s release to a sponsor because ORR generally \n22  requires home studies of proposed custodians of the children it steps up to secure \n23  facilities or RTCs.

For example, Plaintiffs’ expert \n13  Dr.  Emily  Ryo,  a  Professor  of  Law  and  Sociology  at  the  University  of  Southern \n \n14  California, reviewed ORR data from November 2017 to March 13, 2020 and found that \n15  more restrictive placement correlated with longer average lengths of stay: \n16  (Ex. 57 [Ryo Expert Rep.] at 1403; SUF ¶ 142.) At least one class-member was held in \n17  restrictive placements for more than four years. (SUF ¶ 143.) \n18  Children who spend time in secure, staff-secure, therapeutic staff-secure, RTC, \n19  OONs, and therapeutic group homes are also less likely to be reunified with a proposed \n20  custodian (SUF ¶¶ 144–45), and more likely to voluntarily depart the United States than \n21  those who are not stepped up (SUF ¶¶ 146–47). Further, children who are stepped up \n22  are generally ineligible for step-down to long-term foster care programs (SUF ¶ 139), \n23  and children who are stepped up and have no potential sponsor or their sponsor(s) were \n24  denied—i.e., Category 4 cases—are unlikely to be released to Unaccompanied Refugee \n25  Minor (“URM”) programs (SUF ¶¶ 148–49).10 \n26                                           \n10 “The URM program is the ORR-funded foster  care  services program . . . that \n27 \nestablishes legal responsibility, under State law, to ensure that unaccompanied minor \n28 \nCOOLEY LLP  MEM.

ORR’s policies regarding restrictive placement. \n2  ORR’s written policies and procedures govern ORR’s placement and transfer \n3  decisions. (SUF ¶ 157.) ORR’s policies provide no definition or placement criteria for \n4  therapeutic  staff-secure  facilities,  therapeutic  group  homes,  and  out-of-network \n5  facilities, despite mandate to consider least restrictive placements. (SUF ¶¶ 109, 111–\n6  14.)  \n7  ORR case staff participate in step-up and step-down determinations. (SUF ¶¶ 34, \n8  161, 167.) Case Managers compile the information ORR relies upon to decide whether \n9  children will be stepped up or stepped down and recommend whether step-up or step-\n10  down is appropriate. (SUF ¶ 161–62.) Case Coordinators offer a third-party review of \n11  the Case Manager’s recommendations regarding step-ups and step-downs (SUF ¶ 34), \n12  but unlike Case Managers they are not required to speak with children before making \n13  their recommendation (SUF ¶ 164). In practice, Case Coordinators rely exclusively on \n \n14  written documentation (SUF ¶ 163), and rarely speak with children before making step-\n15  up and step-down recommendations. (SUF ¶ 165.) FFS, who are ORR staff (SUF \n16  ¶ 166), provide final authorization for step-up and step-down decisions and can depart \n17  from a Case Manager’s and/or Case Coordinator’s recommendation without further \n18  review by any other ORR official. (SUF ¶ 167.) Like Case Coordinators, FFS rely \n19  exclusively on written documentation (SUF ¶ 168), which is not always accurate (SUF \n20  ¶ 169), and are not required to interview children or communicate with a child’s \n21  potential custodian before making such decisions. (SUF ¶ 170.) \n22  If ORR determines that a child warrants a more restrictive level of placement, \n23  ORR  procedures  only  require  that  children  be  given  a  notice  of  placement  form \n24  (“NOP”) within 48 hours after step-up. (SUF ¶ 183.) The NOP is supposed to inform \n25  the child of the reason for placement in a restrictive setting and their right to challenge \n                                         \n26 \nrefugees and other eligible children . . . receive the full range of assistance, care, and \n27 \nservices that are available to all foster children in the State.” (Ex. 1 [ORR Policy Guide], \nGuide to Terms at 21.) \n28 \nCOOLEY LLP  MEM.

(SUF ¶  186.) However, prior notice of step-up or  placement in a \n2  restrictive setting is not required. (SUF ¶¶ 179, 181.) Additionally, children placed in \n3  OON facilities are not required to receive the NOP within the same time frame (SUF \n4  ¶ 184), and children placed in therapeutic group homes are not entitled to receive any \n5  NOP under ORR policy or procedures. (SUF ¶ 185.) \n6  These draconian policies and lack of notice have a devastating effect on already \n7  traumatized children, sowing confusion, fear and anxiety. (Ex. 58 [A.D.A Decl.] ¶ 4 \n8  (“One morning at 4:00am, officials came and took me from the shelter and transferred \n9  me . . . No one told me where I was going or why.”); Ex. 4 [M.A.P.S. Decl.] ¶ 4 (“One \n10  night, the staff told me to get in the car because we were going to look at the stars \n11  outside. It was really late at night, and I was tired and fell asleep. When I woke up, I \n12  was furious because I realized that they had lied to me. They had taken me to Shiloh \n13  and left all my personal belongings behind at the shelter. No one had told me that I \n \n14  would be transferring to a new facility. I had no prior notice of the transfer and neither \n15  did my family.”).)  \n16  ORR also limits appeal rights regarding placement to an administrative request \n17  for reconsideration to the ORR Director or federal district court review, neither of which \n18  is automatic. (SUF ¶ 187.) The request for reconsideration does not include a hearing \n19  with the right to present evidence or confront adverse evidence. (SUF ¶ 204.) And \n20  children are only entitled to seek reconsideration by the ORR Director after 30 days in \n21  a secure facility or RTC. (SUF ¶ 201.) Children placed in staff-secure or therapeutic \n22  staff-secure facilities, or therapeutic group homes are not afforded an administrative \n23  appeal under ORR policy. (SUF ¶ 202.)   \n24  Although a child who ORR steps up may request a Flores bond hearing before \n25  an immigration judge, the outcome of the bond hearing has no determinative outcome \n26  on the child’s level of placement in ORR custody. (SUF ¶ 205.) Moreover, the bond \n27  process puts the onus to initiate and the burden of proof on the child (SUF ¶ 276), in \n28  contravention of basic procedural due process standards.  \nCOOLEY LLP  MEM.

ORR’s  policies  regarding  restrictive  placement  lack  basic \nprocedural protections. \n2 \n3  ORR’s policies confer unlimited discretion on staff and FFS. None of the limited \n4  guidance  provided  to  case  staff  concerning  step-up,  step-down  or  placement  is \n5  published in the Federal Register or Notice of Proposed Rulemaking or otherwise made \n6  available for public comment. (SUF ¶ 158.) And the policies as written fail to provide \n7  even the most basic procedural protections to children. For example, the policies:  \n8  •  Fail to provide guidance on how to weigh placement considerations or the \napplication of any particular standard—much less an evidentiary standard—\n9  to placement decisions (SUF ¶  177–78); \n10  •  Fail to provide a child any prior written notice that a child may be stepped up \nor the reasons for step-up (SUF ¶  179); \n11 \n•  Fail  to  provide  children  with  adequate  notice  of  placement,  or  in  some \n12  instances—such  as  therapeutic  group  homes—to  provide  any  notice  of \nplacement whatsoever (SUF ¶¶ 184–85, 192); \n13 \n  •  Fail  to  provide  a  child’s  parent  or  other  potential  custodian a  notice  of \n14  placement prior or subsequent to restrictive placement (SUF ¶¶  181, 191); \n15  •  Fail to provide children a meaningful opportunity to inspect and rebut adverse \nevidence relied upon to step them up or decline to step them down (SUF \n16  ¶¶ 197, 215); \n17  •  Fail to provide children an opportunity to present evidence or cross-examine \nwitnesses  in  a  hearing  regarding  step-up,  step-down  or  placement  in  a \n18  restrictive setting (SUF ¶¶ 196, 199, 204, 216); \n19  •  Fail to provide a hearing before a neutral factfinder to challenge an anticipated \nor completed step-up or anticipated denial of step-down (SUF ¶¶ 166–67, 187, \n20  193, 204); and \n21  •  Fail  to  provide  children  an  opportunity  to  challenge  adverse  decisions \nregarding placement through appeal or otherwise in all but the most limited \n22  circumstances (SUF ¶¶ 201–02). \n23  D.  Obstructing  Legal  Assistance  in  Matters  Relating  to  Release, \nPlacement, and Medication (Fourth Claim for Relief) \n24 \n25  Plaintiff Class Members are children who are typically indigent, speak little or \n26  no English, and have little or no knowledge of the United States’ legal system. (SUF \n27  ¶ 226.)  Their  right  to  legal  representation  while  in  ORR  custody  is  statutorily \nguaranteed and critical to the protection of their rights. \n28 \nCOOLEY LLP  MEM. ISO MOT.  \nATTLOORSN AEYNSG AELTE LSA W    15  FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \nCASE NO. 2:18-CV-05741 DMG PLA \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 269-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 30 of 73   Page ID\n \n#:9166\n1  ORR is required to ensure “to the greatest extent possible” that children from \n2  noncontiguous  countries  have  counsel  to  represent  them  “in  legal  proceedings  or \n3  matters and protect them from mistreatment.” (SUF ¶ 227.) ORR and care provider \n4  facilities are required to provide children with information about the availability of free \n5  legal assistance and their right to be represented by counsel. (SUF ¶ 228.)   \n6  HHS  contracts  with  the  Vera  Institute  of  Justice  (“VIJ”),  a  non-profit \n7  organization, to coordinate the delivery of free legal services to children who are or \n8  have been in ORR custody. (SUF ¶ 229.) VIJ in turn subcontracts with non-profit legal \n9  aid providers to counsel and represent children in immigration proceedings. (SUF \n10  ¶ 231.) The vast majority of Class Members are represented, if at all, by legal service \n11  providers under subcontract with VIJ. (SUF ¶ 233.)   \n12  The undisputed facts demonstrate that ORR’s policies and procedures frequently \n13  compromise lawyers’ ability to represent detained children with respect to release, \n \n14  placement, and medication decisions.  \n15  First, Case Managers are not required to communicate with children’s lawyers \n16  about release and placement decisions. Although ORR policy nominally declares that \n17  “Case  Manager[s]  inform[]  other  stakeholders  of  the  progress”  toward  release,  it \n18  nowhere requires case managers to inform children’s lawyers of anything, but instead \n19  provides that such “other stakeholders” “may include local legal service providers and \n20  attorneys of record.” (SUF ¶ 236 (emphasis added).) ORR’s lack of policy grants broad \n21  discretion to Case Managers to communicate—or not—with children’s counsel. (SUF \n22  ¶¶ 236–37, 241–42.) Thus, lawyers’ access to Case Managers varies by facility. (SUF \n23  ¶ 240.) Indeed, some  facilities even refuse to tell lawyers who their client’s Case \n24  Manager is. (SUF ¶ 237.) Likewise, Case Coordinators and FFS are not required to \n25  communicate with children’s legal counsel. (SUF ¶ 238–39.) And, in practice, they \n26 \n27 \n28 \nCOOLEY LLP  MEM.

(SUF ¶ 239.)11       \n2  Second, in the limited instances when children’s counsel are made aware of \n3  release and placement decisions, ORR denies them timely access to evidence and \n4  information it relies upon in making those decisions. Case Managers do not regularly \n5  provide legal representatives with evidence relied upon in recommending for or against \n6  release.  (SUF  ¶ 241.)  They  inconsistently  allow  children’s  lawyers  to  submit \n7  affirmative evidence in support of a client’s release. (SUF ¶ 242.) They do not provide \n8  legal  representatives  with  copies  of  their  ultimate  recommendation  for  or  against \n9  release. (SUF ¶ 243.) Likewise, Case Coordinators and FFS are not obligated to provide \n10  children’s lawyers the opportunity to submit affirmative evidence or even provide a \n11  copy of the ultimate recommendation and decision. (SUF ¶¶ 244–45.) The same goes \n12  for restrictive placement. Legal representatives must formally request a copy of the \n13  child’s file in order to access evidence ORR believes justifies restrictive placement. \n \n14  (SUF ¶¶ 246–47.) There are no time limits on how long ORR may take before it releases \n15  a child’s file pursuant to a request from their lawyer; in practice, counsel may wait \n16  weeks or months before receiving the file. (SUF ¶¶ 248–49.)12   \n17  Third, ORR obstructs children’s counsel from advocating for them with respect \n18  to step-up or step-down decisions. (SUF ¶ 251–54.) ORR does not require that a child’s \n19  lawyer be informed when a child is being stepped-up to a restrictive placement until \n20  after the transfer occurs. (SUF ¶ 255.) Nor does ORR disclose any psychological reports \n21  relied upon to transfer a child to a secure and/or psychiatric facility. (SUF ¶ 254.)     \n22  Fourth, ORR’s written policies do not require that a child’s legal representative \n23 \n                                         \n24 \n11  Nor  do  children’s  legal  representatives  have  access  to  personnel  tasked  with \n25  completing home studies for proposed sponsors, even though such home studies may \nbe determinative in deciding whether ORR releases a child. (SUF ¶ 261.)  \n26 \n12 And when it does at least produce a child’s file, ORR redacts the names and contact \n27 \ninformation of third parties, including names of potential custodians and witnesses to \nevents allegedly justifying restrictive placement.

(SUF ¶ 259.)   \n2  E.  Plaintiffs  Suffered  Real  and  Substantial  Harm  as  a  Result  of \nDefendants’ Policies \n3 \n4  In February 2018, ORR took Plaintiff Lucas R. into its custody and placed him \n5  at the Hacienda del Sol facility (“HdS”) in Youngtown, Arizona. (SUF ¶ 10.) When \n6  Lucas R.’s sister, Madelyn, learned of his arrest, she quickly asked ORR to release \n7  Lucas  R.  to her.  (SUF  ¶  49.)  Madelyn  promptly  gave  ORR  all  the  documents  it \n8  requested and applied to be his sponsor. (SUF ¶ 49.)   \n9  On February 20, 2018, ORR hospitalized Lucas R., purportedly due to suicidal \n10  ideation. (SUF ¶ 11.) According to the emergency room report, Lucas R. had “[suicidal \n11  ideation] x8 days since being moved to southwest key . . . ‘and being removed from \n12  family.’”  (SUF  ¶  11.)  The  report  further  states  that  Lucas  R.  “denie[d]  [suicidal \n13  ideation] at this time [and] just states he is sad and depressed being away from his family \n \n14  in  Guatemala.”  (SUF  ¶  12.)  Nonetheless,  upon  being  returned  to  HdS,  a  nurse \n15  practitioner promptly placed Lucas R. on sertraline (brand name Zoloft), a psychotropic \n16  drug with severe potential side effects. (SUF ¶ 13.) The medication caused Lucas R. \n17  stomach pain, and he periodically resisted taking it. (SUF ¶ 13.) No one from the shelter \n18  or ORR asked Madelyn for her consent to administer Lucas R. psychotropic drugs. \n19  (SUF ¶ 14.)   \n20  On or about March 15, 2018, ORR arranged a home study to assess Madelyn’s \n21  suitability as a custodian for Lucas R. (SUF ¶ 50.) On April 12, 2018, ORR’s home \n22  investigator recommended against releasing Lucas R. to Madelyn. (SUF ¶ 51.) Madelyn \n23  describes how she learned that ORR had declared her unfit to care for her brother: \n24  She told me nothing could be done, that the denial was a final decision. \nThey didn’t give me any opportunity to appeal the denial, or to ask that the \n25 \ndecision be changed. She never gave me anything in writing explaining the \n26  reason for having denied me [Lucas R.’s] custody.  \n27  (ECF No. 37-13 [Madelyn R. Decl.] ¶ 13.)  \n28  Shortly thereafter, ORR transferred Lucas R. to Shiloh RTC. (SUF ¶ 15.) There, \nCOOLEY LLP  MEM.

(SUF ¶ 16.) \n3  Numerous named Plaintiffs and Class Members recount similarly precipitous and \n4  perfunctory decision-making that extended detention for months without their having \n5  the least ability to correct faulty assumptions, rebut derogatory evidence, or fill in the \n6  evidentiary record. (See, e.g., Ex. 138 [J.F.A. Decl.] ¶ 9 (Gabriela N.’s grandfather, after \n7  she was detained six months at Shiloh RTC: “I got the impression that the home \n8  investigator didn’t think I made enough money to be able to support [my granddaughter] \n9  and myself.”); ECF No. 37-14, ¶ 8 (youth detained for fifteen months: “My case worker \n10  told me that the only reason that I haven’t been released to my aunt [is] because I don’t \n11  have an official birth certificate[.] My mother died before she could register me for \n12  [one].”).)  \n13  If the statements of these children were not enough, Plaintiffs’ experts similarly \n \n14  agree that prolonged detention, such as that described above, is positively associated \n15  with increased incidences of “step-up,” thus producing a vicious cycle. (See SUF ¶ 115.) \n16  III.  LEGAL STANDARD \n17  A party may move for partial summary judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The \n18  standard for partial summary judgment is the same as summary judgment generally, \n19  such that summary judgment on a claim is appropriate when the moving party “shows \n20  that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to \n21  judgment as a matter of law.” Id.; see Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 \n22  (1986). Material facts are those that may affect the outcome of the case.  Nat’l Ass’n of \n23  Optometrists & Opticians v. Harris, 682 F.3d 1144, 1147 (9th Cir. 2012). A dispute is \n24  genuine “if the evidence is such that a reasonable [factfinder] could return a verdict for \n25  the nonmoving party.” Anderson v.

V. “A procedural due \n5  process claim has two distinct elements: (1) a deprivation of a constitutionally protected \n6  liberty  or  property  interest,  and  (2)  a denial  of  adequate  procedural  protections.” \n7  McQuillion v. Duncan, 306 F.3d 895, 900 (9th Cir. 2002) (internal quotation marks \n8  omitted). A constitutionally protected liberty or property interest can arise from the \n9  Constitution, statute, or contract, including a consent decree. Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 \n10  U.S. 678, 690 (2001) (Constitution); Carver v. Lehman, 558 F.3d 869, 874–75 (9th Cir. \n11  2009) (statute); Smith v. Sumner, 994 F.2d 1401, 1406 (9th Cir. 1993) (consent decree); \n12  see ECF No. 141 [Class Cert. Order] at 13-15.  \n13  Plaintiffs  have  clear  liberty  interests  to  be  free  from  detention,  to  familial \n \n14  association, and to be placed in the least restrictive setting—interests guaranteed by the \n15  Constitution,  the  TVPRA,  and  the  FSA.  (See  infra Section  IV.A.)  Moreover,  the \n16  undisputed record demonstrates that ORR’s policies violate even the most basic tenets \n17  of due process by failing to provide Plaintiffs with notice and a hearing. (See infra \n18  Section IV.B.) Because Plaintiffs are constitutionally entitled to a hearing, binding \n19  Supreme Court precedent mandates that ORR provide such hearing in accordance with \n20  the procedures set forth in the APA. (See infra Section IV.C.) Finally, the high risk of \n21  erroneous  deprivation,  probable  value  of  additional  safeguards,  and relatively  low \n22  burden associated with additional procedural requirements, see Mathews v. Eldridge, \n23  424 U.S. 319 (1976), further weigh in favor of granting summary judgment and the \n24  remedies articulated in the concurrently filed Proposed Order.

Sessions, 872 F.3d 976, 981 (9th Cir. 2017) (“[T]he government’s \n8  discretion to incarcerate non-citizens is always constrained by the requirements of due \n9  process.”); id. at 990 (“In the context of immigration detention, it is well-settled that \n10  ‘due process requires adequate procedural protections to ensure that the government’s \n11  asserted  justification  for  physical  confinement  outweighs  the  individual’s \n12  constitutionally protected interest in avoiding physical restraint.’”) (quoting Singh v. \n13  Holder, 638 F.3d 1196, 1203 (9th Cir. 2011)).   \n \n14  Further, children placed in secure psychiatric facilities, including but not limited \n15  to  RTCs,  are  often  subjected  to  highly  restrictive  conditions  amounting  to  civil \n16  commitment.  And  “civil  commitment  for  any  purpose  constitutes  a  significant \n17  deprivation of liberty that requires due process protection.” Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 \n18  U.S.  71,  75-80  (1992)  (recognizing  Fifth  Amendment  liberty  interest  for  civilly \n19  committed detainees) (quoting Addington v.

The uncontroverted record also shows \n22  that children stepped up to secure psychiatric facilities may be required to undergo \n23  mandatory behavior modification (SUF ¶ 135 (children forced to undergo sex-offender \n24  treatment);  SUF  ¶  134  (children  forcibly  injected  with  psychotropic  medication)), \n25  which itself requires due process protections under the Constitution.

See Moore v. City of East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 504 (1977) (“The \n17  tradition of uncles, aunts, cousins, and especially grandparents sharing a household \n18  along with parents and children has roots equally venerable and equally deserving of \n19  constitutional recognition.”); J.E.C.M. v.

The TVPRA also \n2  prescribes ORR’s duty to place children in non-secure facilities: “A child shall not be \n3  placed in a secure facility absent a determination that the child poses a danger to self or \n4  others or has been charged with having committed a criminal offense.” Id. (emphasis \n5  added); see Carver, 558 F.3d at 872–73 (statute creates constitutionally protected \n6  interest if it contains “explicitly mandatory language”); ECF No. 141 at 13-14. \n7  FSA. The FSA creates protected liberty interests in the right to expeditious \n8  release from detention and the right to family reunification. (See ECF No. 141 at 14-15 \n9  (finding FSA protections “are secured by a consent decree and constitute civil rights \n10  because they are akin to . . . constitutional and statutory rights”).) Paragraph 14, for \n11  example, mandates that, where detention is not necessary to secure a minor’s timely \n12  appearance or ensure safety of the minor or others, “[ORR] shall release a minor from \n13  its custody without unnecessary delay, in the following order of preference, to: A. a \n \n14  parent;  B.  a  legal  guardian;  C.  an  adult  relative  (brother,  sister,  aunt,  uncle,  or \n15  grandparent) . . . E. a licensed program willing to accept legal custody; F. an adult \n16  individual or entity seeking custody . . . .” (Ex. 8 [FSA] ¶ 14 (emphasis added).) \n17  Similarly, Paragraph 18 provides that “[ORR] . . . shall make and record the prompt \n18  and continuous efforts on its part toward family reunification and the release of the \n19  minor pursuant to Paragraph 14 above.” (Id. ¶ 18 (emphasis added).)   \n20  Notably, the rights created by the FSA are not tethered to the degree of relation \n21  to the prospective sponsor. Put differently, the FSA grants all Class Members the right \n22  to prompt release from detention; it does not give Class Members a lesser right to \n23  prompt release depending on the degree of kinship with or availability of sponsors.    \n24  The FSA also creates a constitutionally protected liberty interest in non-secure, \n25  licensed facilities: “Except as provided in Paragraphs 12 or 21, such minor shall be \n26  placed temporarily in a licensed program until such time as release can be effected . . . \n27  or until the minor’s immigration proceedings are concluded, whichever occurs earlier.” \n28  (Ex. 8 [FSA] ¶ 19 (emphasis added).)

This \n3  Court has already determined that RTCs and juvenile detention centers are not “licensed \n4  programs” within the meaning of the FSA. See Flores v. Sessions, No. 2:85-cv-4544-\n5  DMG (AGRx), ECF No. 470 at 11-14 (C.D. Cal. July 30, 2018). The FSA enumerates \n6  limited circumstances under which ORR may place children in unlicensed facilities—\n7  e.g., when a child has committed a violent crime, is an unusual escape risk, or is so \n8  disruptive that secure confinement is necessary to ensure the welfare of the minor or \n9  others—but even then, requires that no “less restrictive alternatives [be] available.” (Ex. \n10  8 [FSA] ¶¶ 21, 23.) \n11  These provisions of the FSA create constitutionally protected liberty interests for \n12  the custodial vetting and step-up Class Members. See Sumner, 994 F.2d at 1406.  \n13  B.  ORR’s Policies Lack Even Minimal Due Process   \n \n14  ORR’s policies and procedures for release and step-up or step-down of minors \n15  are constitutionally inadequate because ORR deprives children of liberty without any \n16  hearing or meaningful legal process.  \n17  The observations of the judicious Blackstone . . . are well worthy of recital: \n“To bereave a man of life . . . or by violence to confiscate his estate, without \n18 \naccusation or trial, would be so gross and notorious an act of despotism as \n19  must at once convey the alarm of tyranny throughout the whole nation; but \nconfinement of the person, by secretly hurrying him to jail, where his \n20 \nsufferings are unknown or forgotten, is a less public, a less striking, and \n21  therefore a more dangerous engine of arbitrary government.”  \n22  C.  Rossiter  ed.,  p.  512  (1961)  (quoting  1  Blackstone  *136).  Yet,  here,  the  most \n23  vulnerable children—unaccompanied immigrant children—are denied release to family \n24  and other willing sponsors and locked in jails and psychiatric centers without anything \n25  remotely close to a hearing.13  \n26                                           \n13  The  law  grants  even  less  vulnerable  groups  more  protections  than  detained \n27 \nunaccompanied immigrant children. See e.g. Boumediene v. Bush, 553 U.S. 723, 783-\n28 \nCOOLEY LLP  MEM.

Sec., 909 F.3d 786, 797 (6th Cir. 2018). But where, \n4  as here, the government’s decision depends on factual findings and plaintiffs are denied \n5  the opportunity to be heard at all, the court need not weigh the interests at stake under \n6  the Mathews balancing test. See id. at 797 (concluding that procedures “violate long-\n7  standing principles of procedural due process that predate the Mathews test”). \n8  At a minimum, due process requires notice and “a fair opportunity to rebut the \n9  Government’s factual assertions before a neutral decisionmaker.” Hamdi, 542 U.S. at \n10  533; Doe v. Gallinot, 657 F.2d 1017, 1024 (9th Cir. 1981); see also Bowman Transp. v. \n11  Arkansas Best Freight Sys., 419 U.S. 281, 288 n. 4 (1974) (“[T]he Due Process Clause \n12  forbids an agency to use evidence in a way that forecloses an opportunity to offer a \n13  contrary presentation.”); Goldberg v.

Zimmerman Brush \n9  Co., 455 U.S. 422, 434 (1982).  \n10  ORR’s refusal to permit children and their custodians the opportunity to inspect \n11  and rebut evidence material to ORR’s decision-making before a neutral factfinder \n12  offends the most “basic tenet[s]” of due process. See Hicks, 909 F.3d at 797 (collecting \n13  cases); see also Zerezghi v. U.S. Citizenship and Immigr. Serv., 955 F.3d 802, 810–12 \n \n14  (9th Cir. 2020) (government violated due process where it failed to provide the evidence \n15  it relied upon in making its decision thereby denying plaintiffs the opportunity to rebut \n16  the evidence); ASSE Int’l, Inc. v. Kerry, 803 F.3d 1059, 1075 (9th Cir. 2015) (same). \n17  This denial of even minimally required procedural protections is itself a violation of due \n18  process and grounds for granting summary judgment in Plaintiffs’ favor on their First \n19  and Second Claims for Relief.   \n20  C.  ORR’s Policies Fail to Provide a Hearing as Required Under the APA  \n21  The  Administrative  Procedure  Act  (“APA”)  regulates  federal  administrative \n22  proceedings in “every case of adjudication required by statute to be determined on the \n23  record after [the] opportunity for an agency hearing.” 5 U.S.C. § 554(a).14 The Supreme \n24                                           \n14 There can be no dispute that ORR’s decisions regarding the fitness of prospective \n25 \ncustodians and restrictive placement are adjudicatory. As the Ninth Circuit has held, \n26  adjudicatory  decisions  are  those  that  “determine  the  specific  rights  of  particular \nindividuals.” See Marathon Oil Co. v. EPA, 564 F.2d 1253, 1261 (9th Cir. 1977). \n27 \nRelevant here, ORR is adjudicating matters directly related to children’s rights to (i) \n28 \nCOOLEY LLP  MEM.

See Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath, 339 U.S. 33, 50 \n3  (1950), superseded in part by statute on other grounds Ardestani v. I.N.S., 502 U.S. 129 \n4  (1991). In Wong Yang Sung, the Supreme Court held that the APA’s “limitation to \n5  hearings ‘required by statute’” “exempts from that section’s application only those \n6  hearings which administrative agencies may hold by regulation, rule, custom, or special \n7  dispensation; not those held by compulsion.” Id. (emphasis added). In other words, they \n8  “exempt hearings of less than statutory authority, not those of more than statutory \n9  authority.” Id.; see also Aageson Grain & Cattle v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 500 F.3d 1038, \n10  1043-44 (9th Cir. 2007) (“[T]he APA generally applies where an administrative hearing \n11  is required by statute or the Constitution.”) (emphasis added).   \n12  As established in Section IV.A, supra,  the Government’s decisions denying \n13  release of Plaintiffs to proposed custodians and to initially place or step-up or step-down \n \n14  minors directly implicates Plaintiffs’ liberty interests in freedom from detention and \n15  rights to familial association. And because these decisions depend on factual findings, \n16  due process requires at a minimum notice and a hearing. (See supra Section IV.B.) \n17  Where the Constitution requires a hearing, as it does here, the APA prescribes \n18  the procedures that must be provided. See Wong Yang Sung, 339 U.S. at 51, 53; 5 U.S.C. \n19  §§ 554, 556, 557. Thus, ORR must provide children in its custody: (1) “notice” of the \n20  hearing;  (2)  the  opportunity  to  present  his  or  her  “case  or  defense  by  oral  or \n21  documentary evidence”; (3) “to submit rebuttal evidence”; and (4) “to conduct such \n22  cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.” 5 U.S.C \n23  §§ 554(b)-(d), 556(d). And if any agency decision “rests on official notice of a material \n24  fact not appearing in the evidence in the record,” the party is “entitled to an opportunity \n25  to show the contrary.” 5 U.S.C § 556(e). ORR’s policies with respect to determining \n26 \n                                         \n27 \nphysical liberty, (ii) family integrity, (iii) least restrictive placement consistent with \ntheir best interests, and (iv) release without unnecessary delay to qualified custodians.   \n28 \nCOOLEY LLP  MEM.

Mathews v. Eldridge Also Entitles Plaintiffs to Procedural Safeguards.  \n5  Courts use the three-factor test articulated in Mathews v. Eldridge to determine \n6  which procedural protections are warranted:  \n7 \nFirst, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, \n8  the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures \nused, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural \n9 \nsafeguards; and finally, the Government’s interest, including the function \n10  involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or \nsubstitute procedural requirement would entail. \n11 \n12  424 U.S. at 335. Plaintiffs’ interests in freedom from detention and familial association \n13  and  their  right to  placement  in  the least  restrictive  setting  are  substantial  and  far \n \n14  outweigh Defendants’ interests in denying basic procedural protections.  \n15 \n1.  ORR’s  custodial  vetting  policies  and  procedures  are \n16  constitutionally inadequate under Mathews. \n17  a.  Plaintiffs’ interests are substantial. \nIt is well-established that a minor’s interests in freedom from detention and \n18 \nfamilial association are substantial. See, e.g., Schall v. Martin, 467 U.S. 253, 265 (1984) \n19 \n(“The juvenile’s countervailing interest in freedom from institutional restraints, even \n20 \nfor the brief time involved here, is undoubtedly substantial as well.”); Singh, 638 F.3d \n21 \nat  1208  (“The  private  interest  here—freedom  from  prolonged  detention—is \n22 \nunquestionably substantial”); Foucha, 504 U.S. at 80 (“Freedom from bodily restraint \n23 \nhas always been at the core of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause from \n24 \narbitrary governmental action.”); Beltran, 222 F.

(SUF  ¶ 1.)  And  here,  the  undisputed  facts \n3  demonstrate that children are at risk of harm in ORR custody.  Children have been \n4  physically abused and sexually abused in ORR custody. (SUF ¶¶ 6–7.) Gabriela N. \n5  experienced verbal abuse and harassment and suicidal ideation in ORR custody, which \n6  resulted in hospitalization. (SUF ¶ 5.) And it is beyond dispute that children in ORR \n7  custody experience separation from their parents, siblings, grandparents, and other \n8  family members. (SUF ¶ 8.)      \n9  b.  Plaintiffs  have  been  prejudiced  by  ORR’s  erroneous \ndeprivations  of  liberty  in  its  release  decisions  and  the \nvalue of additional safeguards is undisputable.  \n10 \n11  The prejudice and risk of an erroneous deprivation of a child’s liberty without \n12  adequate procedural safeguards is high. Given the substantial interests at play, and the \n13  inherent harms of detention, children are entitled to robust procedural protections. \n \n14  Moreover, “[t]he consequences of an erroneous commitment decision are more tragic \n15  where children are involved” because “childhood is a particularly vulnerable time of \n16  life and children erroneously institutionalized during their formative years may bear the \n17  scars for the rest of their lives.” Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 318 (1993) (O’Connor, \n18  J. and Souter, J., concurring) (internal citations omitted).  \n19  Accordingly, at least the following procedural protections are necessary to guard \n20  against the risk of erroneous deprivation of Plaintiffs’ substantial interests in freedom \n21  from detention and familial association: (i) adequate notice and an opportunity to be \n22  heard; (ii) clear standards for determining custodial fitness; (iii) timelines to ensure \n23  prompt release; (iv) right to counsel; and (v) interpreters. Because these safeguards \n24  would reduce the risk of erroneous, prolonged, and harmful detention, this factor weighs \n25  heavily in favor of granting relief.  \n26  (i)  ORR’s failure to provide adequate notice and an \nopportunity to be heard harms Plaintiffs’ interests.   \n27 \n28  Generally, the Constitution requires some kind of a hearing before a deprivation \nCOOLEY LLP  MEM.

Due process requires “an opportunity to be heard in person and to present \n3  documentary evidence,” as well as “[a]n opportunity at the hearing to present testimony \n4  of witnesses . . . and to confront and cross-examine witnesses called by the state, except \n5  upon a finding, not arbitrarily made, of good cause for not permitting such presentation, \n6  confrontation, or cross-examination.” Vitek, 445 U.S. at 494; Schall, 467 U.S. at 277 \n7  (due process satisfied where accused juvenile was provided a hearing to call witnesses \n8  and offer evidence on his own and where government was allowed to call witnesses \n9  under oath and witnesses were subject to cross examination); Beltran, 222 F. Supp. 3d \n10  at 486 (holding that once ORR decided to withhold minor from the care of his mother, \n11  “ORR owed [the mother] some form of adversarial process, and could not simply \n12  require [the mother] to change the agency’s mind”); see also Logan, 455 U.S. at 433; \n13  D.B. v. Cardall, 826 F.3d at 743. \n \n14  At least two courts have already found ORR’s reunification policies violate due \n15  process. In Beltran v. Cardall, the court held that ORR’s failure to provide adequate \n16  notice and adversarial hearing procedures failed to make sponsors “aware of any of the \n17  evidence or factual findings upon which ORR relied” and improperly placed the burden \n18  on the sponsor to “change the agency’s mind,” or, if unable to do so, “initiate court \n19  proceedings.” 222 F. Supp. 3d at 485. The court also found: \n20 \nVirtually all of [ORR’s] procedures . . . consisted of internal evaluation \n21  and  unilateral  investigation.  In  effect,  Respondents  contend  that  due \nprocess was satisfied here because ORR made a significant effort to reach \n22 \nthe correct decision. But due process does not concern itself only with the \n23  degree to which one can trust the government to reach the right result \non its own initiative; rather, due process is measured by the affected \n24 \nindividual’s opportunity to protect his or her own interests. \n25 \n26  Id. at 486-87 (emphasis added).

Supp. 3d 598, 614 (W.D. Va. 2017). \n4  Here, it is undisputed that “children are not provided a written denial of a \n5  proposed custodian’s release request, unless the sole reason for the denial is a concern \n6  that the unaccompanied alien child is a danger to himself/herself or the community.”  \n7  (SUF ¶ 70; see SUF ¶ 86 (Lucas R. did not know reasons sister was rejected, and neither \n8  he nor his sister were provided written explanation for rejection); SUF ¶ 85 (Gabriela \n9  N.’s proposed custodian was her grandfather, yet he was not provided written notice of \n10  the reasons for rejection); Ex. 138 [J.F.A. Decl.] ¶ 12 (ORR never officially told \n11  Gabriela N.’s grandfather that his sponsorship application had been denied or that they \n12  were looking for other sponsors).) It is also undisputed that ORR does not have a policy \n13  requiring it to provide an opportunity to inspect or rebut evidence that ORR considers \n \n14  in determining whether a child should be released to a proposed custodian.  (SUF ¶ 75.)       \n15  It is further undisputed that ORR does not, in policy or practice, provide children \n16  or sponsors a hearing to challenge an anticipated denial of a proposed custodian’s \n17  release request, much less any opportunity to offer input designed to rebut ORR’s \n18  decision. (SUF ¶ 74–77.) Accordingly, the Court should find ORR’s policies and \n19  procedures deficient, and order Defendants to provide Class Members with notice and \n20  a hearing.15 \n21 \n22 \n23                                           \n15 It is similarly undisputed that, with very limited exception, ORR fails to allow Class \n24 \nMembers, or their sponsors, any opportunity to appeal its finding that a proposed \n25  custodian is unfit, much less within any certain timeframe. (SUF ¶¶ 77–80.) At most, \nonly parents and legal guardians, and no other class of proposed sponsors—regardless \n26 \nof familial relation or other connection—are allowed an appeal; even then, ORR’s \n27 \npolicies do not require that ORR provide a hearing on an appeal within any time certain. \n(SUF ¶ 80.) \n28 \nCOOLEY LLP  MEM.

In L.V.M. v. Lloyd, for example, children detained by \n5  ORR challenged a new policy requiring director-level approval to release children who \n6  were currently or previously detained in staff-secure or secure facilities.  318 F. Supp. \n7  3d 601, 608-09 (S.D.N.Y. 2018). The court found that “[u]nder a policy of his own \n8  making, [the director] has unfettered discretion to approve, deny, or request additional \n9  information, unguided by any rule or fixed set of criteria, giving him unrestricted power \n10  to rule over the fate of vulnerable children.” Id. at 611. The court ordered ORR to vacate \n11  the policy, calling it “the zenith of impermissible agency actions.” Id. at 609; see also \n12  Staub v. City of Baxley, 355 U.S. 313, 322 (1958) (finding unconstitutional official’s \n13  “uncontrolled discretion” based on decision criteria “without semblance of definitive \n \n14  standards or other controlling guidelines”).  \n15  The same arguments apply to ORR’s current approach to determining custodial \n16  fitness. First, ORR admits that, in making release decisions, “ORR does not use an \n17  ‘evidentiary’  standard  such  as  is  more  appropriately  applied  in  formal  court \n18  proceedings.” (SUF ¶¶ 61–62, 93.) Second, ORR’s written policies offer only limited \n19  instructions to case staff in making reunification decisions, none of which is published \n20  in the Federal Register or a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and is therefore shielded \n21  from public scrutiny. (SUF ¶ 63.) Further, the limited guidance only instructs staff what \n22  general  categories  of  information  to  collect  and  consider,  but  not  how  to  weigh \n23  information once collected. (E.g., SUF ¶ 59.) Third, the undisputed evidence confirms \n24  that the vast discretion afforded to case staff has resulted in arbitrary, inconsistent, and \n25  shifting reasons for denial. (See SUF ¶ 38 (sponsor deemed non-viable by case staff at \n26  one facility and then approved two weeks later after child was transferred to different \n27  facility); SUF ¶ 82 (child’s sister denied as sponsor because child and sister did not have \n28 \nCOOLEY LLP  MEM.

Santosky, 455 U.S. \n5  at  756  (“clear  and  convincing  evidence”  standard  appropriate  where  government-\n6  initiated proceedings . . . threaten the individual involved with a significant deprivation \n7  of liberty or stigma”) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \n8 \n(iii)  ORR’s failure to provide for prompt release harms \n9  Plaintiffs’ interests. \nCourts have already found that ORR’s “significant” and “unexplained delay[s] in \n10 \nresponding  to  [a  proposed  sponsor’s]  unification  request”  violate  due  process \n11 \nirrespective of other procedural defects. Santos, 260 F. Supp. 3d at 614. Indeed, timely \n12 \nprocess is required to ensure that ORR is not allowing Class Members to languish in \n13 \n \ncustody indefinitely. (See SUF ¶ 29; see also Flores v. Sessions, No. 2:85-cv-4544-\n14 \nDMG (AGRx), 2018 WL 10162328, at *21 (C.D. Cal. July 30, 2018) (finding ORR’s \n15 \npolicies caused unnecessary delay, at least in part, because (1) they were not required \n16 \nby the TVPRA or FSA, and (2) were not deemed necessary in analogous state child \n17 \nwelfare contexts); Flores v. Barr, No. CV 85-4544-DMG (AGRx), 2020 WL 2758798, \n18 \nat *3 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 10, 2020) (“Any unnecessary delay in releasing a minor is, under \n19 \nnormal circumstances, a violation of the FSA . . . .”).  \n20 \nEven so, it is undisputed that “ORR does not have a policy requiring it to make a \n21 \nfinal  suitability  determination  regarding  a  proposed  sponsor  within  any  specific \n22 \ntimeline.” (SUF ¶ 96.) In fact, Defendants admit that “it may take several months before \n23 \nORR  reaches  a  conclusion  concerning  whether  a  proposed  sponsor  is  capable  of \n24 \nproviding for a child’s physical and mental well-being and is otherwise suitable.” (SUF \n25 \n26 \n                                         \n27  16 ORR similarly uses vague criteria to assess a sponsor’s ability to care for a child’s \nmental health needs prior to authorizing release.

Even after ORR makes its final determination, ORR policy does not require \n4  that  proposed  custodians  other  than  parents  or  legal  guardians  be  notified  of  the \n5  determination within any set time period. (SUF ¶ 72.)  \n6  The undisputed evidence also confirms that children are often in ORR custody \n7  for significant periods of time even when they have available sponsors. Gabriela N., for \n8  example, was in ORR custody for 633 days—nearly two years—despite her grandfather \n9  being ready and willing to sponsor her release. (SUF ¶ 25.) ORR rejected Gabriela N.’s \n10  grandfather’s  sponsorship  application  and  failed  to  provide  written  notice  of  its \n11  rejection—or the reasons for that rejection—to Gabriela N. or her grandfather. (SUF \n12  ¶ 85.) Lucas R. was in ORR custody for 208 days, despite two different siblings \n13  applying to sponsor him. (SUF ¶ 26, 49.) These experiences are representative of other \n \n14  Class Members who have been detained for extended periods of time in ORR custody, \n15  at least one of whom was in ORR custody for more than four years. (SUF ¶ 27; see also \n16  Stanley v. Ill., 405 U.S. 645, 647 (1972) (even a temporary deprivation of the right to \n17  family integrity is constitutionally significant); D.B. v. Cardall, 826 F.3d at 741 (ORR’s \n18  continued and prolonged detention of children “implicates protected liberty interests”); \n19  cf. In re Robin M., 21 Cal. 3d 337, 342-43 (1978) (expressing disapproval over “the \n20  practice of detaining a child one to six months prior to [a] juvenile court hearing” as \n21  inconsistent “with the protective philosophy of the juvenile court”).)    \n22  Each of the foregoing failures, and the risk of erroneous deprivation, is further \n23  compounded by substantial, undisputed evidence of the inherent harm in detention. \n24  (SUF ¶¶ 1–4, 6–7.) Accordingly, the Court should order ORR to comply with the \n25  timelines set forth in the concurrently filed Proposed Order. \n26  (iv)  ORR’s  failure  to  provide  counsel  to  challenge \nrelease denials harms Plaintiffs’ interests. \n27 \nPlaintiffs’ right to counsel is both constitutionally and statutorily guaranteed, see \n28 \nCOOLEY LLP  MEM.

The right to be heard is of “little avail if it d[oes] not \n3  comprehend the right to be heard by counsel. Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 68-69 \n4  (1932). \n5  (v)  ORR’s  failure  to  provide  interpreters  harms \nPlaintiffs’ interests. \n6 \n7  Appellate and district courts have routinely held that due process requires the \n8  assistance of an interpreter, including in the immigration context. See Augustin v. Sava, \n9  735 F.2d 32, 36–37 (2d Cir. 1984); Rivera v. Granucci, 1993 WL 76202, at *6 (D. \n10  Conn. Mar. 12, 1993).  \nIn a judicial proceeding where a defendant lacks the ability to speak or \n11 \nunderstand English, an interpreter can be essential for ensuring a fair trial. \n12  . . . Under the Court Interpreters Act, a trial judge must use an interpreter \nin the courtroom if that judge determines that a party “speaks only or \n13 \n  primarily a language other than the English language . . . so as to inhibit \n14  such party’s comprehension of the proceedings or communication with \ncounsel or the presiding judicial officer.” \n15 \nUnited  States  v.  Si,  333  F.3d  1041,  1042  (9th  Cir.  2003)  (quoting  28  U.S.C. \n16 \n§ 1827(d)(1)). \n17 \nIt is undisputed that ORR’s written policies do not guarantee the right to an \n18 \ninterpreter. (SUF ¶ 264.) Class Members nonetheless have the right to notice and an \n19 \nopportunity to be heard and should be entitled to an interpreter as part of that process.   \n20 \n(vi)  ORR’s failure to afford due process runs contrary \n21 \nto  prevailing  state  and  federal  child  welfare \npractices. \n22 \n23   “Appellate tribunals have accorded district courts broad discretion to frame \n24  equitable remedies so long as the relief granted is commensurate with the scope of the \n25  constitutional infraction.” Todaro v. Ward, 565 F.2d 48, 54 n. 7 (2d Cir.1977) (citations \n26  omitted). Due process likewise “is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as \n27  the particular situation demands.” Mathews, 424 U.S. at 334–35.  \n28  State and other federal systems provide useful analogs for the types of protections \nCOOLEY LLP  MEM.

See Schad v. Arizona, 501 U.S. 624, 640 (1991) (In \n2  certain cases, a “widely shared practice” can help inform whether a particular practice \n3  so drastically departs from accepted norms as to be presumptively violative of due \n4  process). For example, in California, child welfare agencies must promptly involve the \n5  juvenile court whenever the agency removes a child from their home. (Ex. 53 [Edwards \n6  Expert Rep.] at 1334.) The juvenile court in turn provides a number of procedural \n7  protections to children separated from their families, including the right to notice and \n8  an  opportunity  to  be  heard,  the  right  to  a  trained, neutral  factfinder  who  applies \n9  consistent evidentiary standards, and the right to appeal. (Id. at 1335.)  \n10  Indeed, dependency hearings are “evidentiary hearings, where children have the \n11  right to review and rebut adverse evidence, including rebutting the evidence of adverse \n12  witnesses.” (Id. at 1336.) And the system relies upon “[c]lear statutory timelines” for \n13  hearings  and  dispositions,  which  “move  children’s  cases  forward  toward  timely \n \n14  permanency.” (Id. at 1337.) As explained by Plaintiffs’ expert, Judge Leonard Edwards, \n15  “the procedural protections afforded to children and youth in the U.S. child welfare \n16  system improve the quality of the decisions made in dependency proceedings and \n17  minimize the risk of erroneous deprivation of the rights of children in the child welfare \n18  system.” (Id. at 1326, 1338; see also Ex. 54 [Heldman Expert Rep.] at 1350 (finding \n19  that “ORR’s policies and procedures for transferring and keeping children in restrictive \n20  settings are far more informal and prone to error when compared to the procedures \n21  provided in state and federal juvenile justice and child welfare statutes.”).) According \n22  to Judge Edwards: “In most of the thousands of cases I heard, what happened at the \n23  court hearing . . . modified in some way the recommendation of the social worker.” \n24  (Ex. 53 [Edwards Expert Rep.] at 1339.) By contrast, the undisputed facts show that \n25  FFS—and  therefore  ORR—have  virtually  unfettered  discretion  to  deny  Plaintiffs’ \n26  liberty interests and, further, that Plaintiffs have no ability to challenge those decisions. \n27  (SUF  ¶¶ 37,  46,  57–59,  77–80;  see  also  Ex.  53  [Edwards  Expert  Rep.]  at  1339 \n28  (concluding that ORR’s procedures “fall far short of the procedures provided in the U.S. \nCOOLEY LLP  MEM.

Accordingly, this \n6  Court should compel ORR to: (i) provide adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard \n7  with respect to release decisions; (ii) articulate and adhere to clear standards in its \n8  decision-making; (iii) adhere to timelines to ensure prompt release; (iv) provide the \n9  right to counsel in release proceedings; and (v) guarantee interpreters.  \n10  c.  Plaintiffs’ liberty interests far outweigh the government’s \ninterest. \n11 \n12  The government’s interest is “to place a child in a home suited to the child’s \n13  welfare and needs,” and “that goal [i]s best served by ‘procedures that promote an \n \n14  accurate determination of whether [custodians] can and will provide a normal home.’”  \n15  J.E.C.M., 352 F. Supp. 3d at 586 (quoting Santosky, 455 U.S. 745); see also Lassiter v. \n16  Dep’t of Soc. Servs. of Durham Cnty., 452 U.S. 18, 27 (1981) (“Since the State has an \n17  urgent interest in the welfare of the child, it shares the parent’s interest in an accurate \n18  and just decision.”). \n19  Here, Plaintiffs’ interests in being free from detention and to familial association \n20  far  outweigh  the  government’s  interests,  fiscal,  administrative  or  otherwise.  See \n21  Beltran, 222 F.

To be sure, \n25  ORR  denies  that  the  principal  reason  it  does  not  afford  Class  Members  greater \n26  procedural protections is because it would entail greater expense and administrative \n27  inconvenience.

ORR’s  restrictive  placement  policies  and  procedures  are \nconstitutionally inadequate. \n4 \na.  Plaintiffs’ interests are substantial. \n5 \n6  Plaintiffs’  interests  in  freedom  from  detention  and  familial  association  are \n7  substantial. See, e.g., Schall, 467 U.S. at 265 (freedom from institutional restraints); \n8  Singh, 638 F.3d at 1208; Foucha, 504 U.S. at 80; Beltran, 222 F. Supp. 3d at 482; see \n9  supra Section IV.A. Even more so when placed in ORR’s secure detention facilities \n10  which are akin to jails and prisons. (SUF ¶ 128; supra Section II.C.) Children are \n11  confined to locked facilities, subject to 24-hour surveillance, and treated like criminals. \n12  (SUF ¶ 131.) They sleep in cells on concrete beds and are subject to being pepper \n13  sprayed by guards. (SUF ¶ 130.) In RTC facilities, children face the added indignity of \n \n14  being forced to take psychotropic medications. (SUF ¶¶ 133–34.)  \n15  Moreover, once stepped up: (i) children spend significantly longer detained and \n16  separated from family—on average 131.2 days longer than children not stepped up \n17  (SUF ¶ 141); (ii) children remain in restrictive placements despite ORR’s having found \n18  them suitable for step-down (SUF ¶ 137); (iii) children detained in secure, staff-secure, \n19  therapeutic staff-secure, RTCs, OON facilities, or therapeutic group homes are less \n20  likely to be reunified with a proposed custodian (SUF ¶¶ 144–45), and more likely to \n21  voluntarily depart the United States than children who are only ever placed in shelter \n22  care (SUF ¶¶ 146–47); and (iv) children who are stepped up are unlikely to be released \n23  to URM programs (SUF ¶¶ 148–49), and are ineligible for step-down to long-term \n24  foster care programs (SUF ¶ 139). Even more concerning, restrictive placements can \n25  lead to deterioration of children’s mental health (SUF ¶ 136), and ORR admits that \n26  failing to step-down children who are ready for step-down can be detrimental to their \n27  long-term psychological well-being and contrary to their best interests. (SUF ¶ 138).  \n28  Accordingly, it is uncontroverted that the step-up Class Members’ interest is \nCOOLEY LLP  MEM.

Thus, the first Mathews factor weighs strongly in favor of \n2  due process protections. \n \n3  b.  Plaintiffs  have  been  prejudiced  by  ORR’s  erroneous \ndeprivations  of  liberty  in  its  step-up  and  step-down \n4  decisions  and  the  value  of  additional  safeguards  is \nundisputable. \n5 \n6  The prejudice and risk of erroneous deprivation of placing children in restrictive \n7  facilities without commensurate procedural safeguards is high, particularly when it \n8  results in children spending much longer time in ORR custody away from family. (See \n9  supra Section II.C.) ORR’s opaque process also has resulted in numerous erroneous \n10  decisions—either sending children to unnecessarily restrictive detention centers where \n11  children suffer long lasting harms or keeping children in restrictive placements even \n12  after a step-down decision is made. (SUF ¶¶ 137, 218–19.) Indeed, even once ORR \n13  finds a child suitable for step-down, the step-down process can take several weeks and \n \n14  sometimes even several months. (SUF ¶ 155.) \n15  For example, Defendants admit that Class Representative Jaime D. was detained \n16  in a secure detention center and kept there three weeks after it was determined that he \n17  had been erroneously placed there in the first place. (SUF ¶¶ 218–19; ECF No. 144 \n18  [Azar Answer] ¶ 75 (Defendants admitting that two weeks after transfer to Yolo, “staff \n19  were all in agreement that [Jaime] isn’t appropriately placed in a secure setting” and \n20  that nonetheless Jaime stayed at Yolo for three more weeks).) Additionally, ORR’s own \n21  compliance review of secure facilities revealed that “the majority of the kids [ ] were \n22  inappropriately sheltered.” (Ex. 19 [Ray Dep. Tr.] at 163:19–25;17 see also SUF ¶ 218.) \n23  Likewise, the review showed that placement of over 70% of kids in staff-secure and \n24  RTCs was non-compliant with ORR’s own policies and this Court’s orders. (Ex. 23 \n25  [Fink Dep.

Yet ORR’s current process allows for little to no oversight of \n4  decisions related to restrictive placement. Accordingly, the Court should order ORR to \n5  provide: (i) adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard; (ii) clear standards to \n6  initially place, step-up, or step-down children; (iii) counsel to challenge restrictive \n7  placements; (iv) automatic hearings before a neutral factfinder; (v) interpreters; and \n8  (vi) periodic hearings on placement decisions. \n9  (i)  ORR’s failure to provide Class Members adequate \nnotice  and  an  opportunity  to  be  heard  harms \n10 \nPlaintiffs’ interests. \n11  Due process requires notice and an opportunity to be heard, particularly where, \n12  as here, “subjective judgments are . . . susceptible to error.” Beltran, 222 F. Supp. 3d at \n13  486. Indeed, “even when all parties involved in this process act with diligence and good \n \n14  faith, there is considerable risk of error in the tribunal’s findings of fact. There is a risk \n15  inherent in any process that . . . is closed and accusatorial.” Boumediene, 553 U.S. at \n16  785 (quoting Bismullah v. Gates, 514 F. 3d 1291, 1296 (D.D.C. 2008) (Ginsburg, C.J., \n17  concurring)). Confining children in secure juvenile detention, where they “can’t freely \n18  walk out the door” or are “locked in a cell” entails important liberty interests because \n19  such detention departs from ordinary standards. See E.J. v. Templeton, No. 3:16-cv-\n20  01975,  2017  WL  2080182,  *7  (M.D.  Tenn.  May  15,  2017)  (finding  Fourteenth \n21  Amendment protects juveniles from denial of liberty interest in avoiding incarceration \n22  in secure detention facility because such confinement drastically departs from the \n23  “ordinary standards” of juvenile detention). Accordingly, a “factfinding process” is \n24 \n                                         \n25  processes, including instances where children remained in secure and RTC placements \neven after such placement was no longer appropriate.

See Saravia, 280 F. Supp. \n3  3d at 1199.  \n4  For over 50 years, the Supreme Court has recognized that detained children must \n5  be provided notice “sufficiently in advance of scheduled [hearings] so that reasonable \n6  opportunity to prepare will be afforded, and it must ‘set forth the alleged misconduct \n7  with  particularity.’”  In  re  Gault,  387  U.S.  1,  33  (1967).  Similarly,  in  the  civil \n8  commitment context, notice is “essential to afford the [individual] an opportunity to \n9  challenge the contemplated action and to understand the nature of what is happening to \n10  him.” Vitek, 445 U.S. at 496.  \n11  Here, there is no dispute that ORR does not require that a child and/or his or her \n12  parent or other potential custodian be provided any prior notice that he or she may be \n13  stepped up or the reasons for step-up (SUF ¶¶ 179, 181), and that Class Representatives \n \n14  were stepped up without written notice to them or their potential sponsors of the basis \n15  for restrictive placement prior to step-up. (SUF ¶¶ 180, 182; see also Ex. 70 [K.S.G.P. \n16  Decl.] ¶ 2 (minor was not informed of the reason for transfer prior to or subsequent to \n17  her second placement at Shiloh RTC); Ex. 82 [Y.A.M.S.

See In re Gault, 387 U.S. at 33; Vitek, 445 U.S. at 495–96. Further, notice \n9  without an opportunity to respond is worthless. Saravia, 905 F.3d at 1144 (“Due process \n10  always requires, at minimum, notice and an opportunity to respond.”) (quoting United \n11  States v. Raya-Vaca, 771 F. 3d. 1195, 1204 (9th Cir. 2014), abrogated on other grounds \n12  by Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Thuraissigiam, 140 S. Ct. 1959 (2020)). \n13  Finally, the Government faces minimal burdens in providing adequate notices. \n \n14  See Martinez-de Bojorquez v. Ashcroft, 365 F.3d 800, 805 (9th Cir. 2004) (cost of \n15  adding written notice is “minimal”); Walters v. Reno, 145 F.3d 1032, 1044 (9th Cir. \n16  1998) (“Providing constitutionally adequate notice requires only minor changes in the \n17  content of [INS] forms themselves and equally slight adaptations in the INS’s method \n18  of presenting the forms.”). Especially here, where it is undisputed that the evidence is \n19  compiled and reviewed by Case Managers, reviewed by Case Coordinators before \n20  making a recommendation, and then sent to FFS for final decision-making. (SUF ¶ 162–\n21  63, 167–68.) The same evidence could easily be shared with the child and his or her \n22  legal representative contemporaneously with the evidence being shared with the Case \n23  Coordinator and FFS. \n24  Defendants also admit that no hearing is afforded to children prior to or after step-\n25  up (SUF ¶¶ 193–99, 204), and there is no constitutionally adequate opportunity to be \n26  heard. Given the deprivation of liberty, the substantial private interest at stake, and the \n27  risk involved, due process requires that such hearing occur pre-deprivation––prior to \ninitial placement or step-up to a restrictive setting. See Zinermon, 494 U.S. at 127–28 \n28 \nCOOLEY LLP  MEM.

While  the  Supreme  Court has  made \n3  exceptions for situations “where a predeprivation hearing is unduly burdensome in \n4  proportion to the liberty interest at stake . . . or where the State is truly unable to \n5  anticipate and prevent a random deprivation of liberty interest,” id. at 132 (internal \n6  citations omitted), such exceptions are inapplicable here.  \n7  Indeed, it is highly predictable that a child could be erroneously deprived of his \n8  or  her  interest  where  the  child,  parent,  sponsor  and/or  the  child’s  attorney  or \n9  representative is not notified or made part of the decision-making process (SUF ¶¶ 164–\n10  65, 170–73, 179, 234–39, 244), no hearing or opportunity to respond is afforded (SUF \n11  ¶¶ 193–95), and decision-makers are given no evidentiary standard to apply and little \n12  to no guidance on how to weigh factors or assess criteria, like danger to self or others \n13  (SUF ¶¶ 176–78). It is also feasible to provide pre-deprivation hearings and notice \n \n14  where ORR steps up relatively few children (SUF ¶ 222), making the administrative \n15  burden minimal at most. Despite the predictability and feasibility of providing a pre-\n16  deprivation opportunity to be heard, ORR policy and practice does not afford children \n17  an opportunity to challenge a decision to place them in a restrictive setting before such \n18  placement occurs. (SUF ¶¶ 193–95.) \n19  Even  after  placement  in  a  restrictive  setting,  children  are  not  provided  an \n20  opportunity to challenge their placement in an evidentiary hearing. (SUF ¶ 204.)19  \n21  Although some  children are afforded an opportunity to request reconsideration of \n22  placement, this request for reconsideration is inadequate because: \n23  (1)  Only  children  placed  in  RTCs  and  secure  facilities  are  afforded  this \nopportunity,  but  not  children  placed  in  staff-secure,  therapeutic  staff-\n24  secure, or therapeutic group homes (SUF ¶¶ 201–02); \n25                                           \n19 Class representatives Lucas R.

Yet ORR enjoys  virtually unfettered discretion in deciding \n13  whether to initially place or step-up or step-down children to more or less restrictive \n \n14  detention centers. First, ORR admits that it does not use any type of evidentiary \n15  standard in making detention placement decisions. (SUF ¶ 177.)21  Second, ORR’s \n16  written policies offer only limited guidance to case staff for initially placing, stepping \n17  up or stepping down children, and no guidance whatsoever on how to weigh information \n18  relevant to placement decisions. (SUF ¶ 178.) Further, not all FFS receive formal \n19  training on the differences between all of the different restrictive detention centers. \n20  (SUF ¶ 175.) And ORR policy provides no standardized metric to assess whether a child \n21  is a danger to self or others for step-up to a more restrictive setting—including the most \n22  restrictive, jail-like facilities—or “stable enough” for step-down. (SUF ¶¶ 150–51, 176.) \n23  Third, ORR’s written policies and procedures on initial placements, step-up, and step-\n                                         \n24 \n21 In contrast, courts uniformly require a showing of “clear and convincing evidence” \n25  for involuntary civil commitment, Addington, 441 U.S. at 432–33; Hubbart v.

Fourth, FFS make final placement \n4  decisions based on information and evidence provided by case staff, which is not always \n5  accurate (SUF ¶ 169), and do not independently interview the children and/or their \n6  potential sponsors to aid in their decision-making (SUF ¶ 170–73).22 Fifth, in most \n7  cases, FFS placement decisions are not subject to review (SUF ¶ 174), and FFS may \n8  disregard recommendations of case staff when making such decisions (SUF ¶ 167). \n9  Additionally, an FFS holds all the power to decide whether a placement review can \n10  occur earlier than 30 days. (SUF ¶ 211). Power, like that given to an FFS, “exercised \n11  entirely at the[ir] discretion . . . is a broad, roving authority, a type of administrative \n12  absolutism not congenial to our law-making traditions.” Gutknecht v. United States, 396 \n13  U.S. 295, 306 (1970). \n \n14  (iii)  ORR’s  failure  to  provide  counsel    to  challenge \nrestrictive placements harms Plaintiffs’ interests. \n15 \nAs discussed, a right to be heard is concomitant with the right to counsel. (See \n16 \nsupra Section IV.D.1.b.iv.) Because these children have a fundamental liberty interest \n17 \nat stake, there is no doubt that the right to counsel is constitutionally mandated—\n18 \nespecially where the detainee is a vulnerable unaccompanied child. (See infra Section \n19 \nV.) \n20 \n21 \n(iv)  ORR’s failure to provide automatic hearings before \na neutral factfinder harms Plaintiffs’ interests. \n22 \nProcedural due process also requires an automatic hearing by a neutral factfinder. \n23 \n(See supra Section IV.B.; Morrisey v.

Corr. \n3  Inst., Walpole v. Hill, 472 U.S. 445, 450 (1985)).) The undisputed facts show that \n4  ORR’s written policies do not guarantee Class Members the right to a hearing before a \n5  neutral  factfinder  in  connection  with  decisions  to  detain  a  child  in  a  restrictive \n6  placement, despite the fact that all 50 states and the District of Columbia require a \n7  hearing before a neutral factfinder before a child can be detained in a secure facility, \n8  and a majority of the states provide the same for children placed in staff-secure facilities.  \n9  (SUF ¶¶ 74, 207.) \n10  Further, due process tilts overwhelmingly in favor  of automatic hearings to \n11  ensure Class Members’ ongoing prolonged confinement in restrictive detention centers \n12  remains  justified.  First,  “[t]he  private  interest  here—freedom  from  prolonged \n13  detention—is  unquestionably  substantial.”  Singh,  638  F.3d  at  1208.  Prolonged \n \n14  confinement imposes not only lengthy physical restraint, but also loss  of  familial \n15  association. Second, the record evidence establishes that erroneous deprivations of \n16  liberty occur without automatic hearings and adequate notice. Many Class Members \n17  lack English proficiency or literacy in any language meaning that due process can only \n18  be achieved if a child’s hearings are automatic. See Walters, 145 F.3d at 1043 (striking \n19  down INS procedures in part because “the alien never learns how to take advantage of \n20  the procedures because the combined effect of all the [immigration] forms together is \n21  confusion”)  (emphasis  in  original);  see  also  Gallinot,  657  F.2d  at  1023  (lack  of \n22  automatic hearings rendered process “illusory” because detainees “cannot realistically \n23  be expected to set the proceedings into motion in the first place”).  \n24  In similar juvenile proceedings, children’s deprivation hearings occur as of right \n25  and the onus is never placed on a child to prove that they should not be deprived of \n26  liberty. (Ex. 144 [Quinn Expert Rep.] at 2050.) According to Professor Mae Quinn, who \n27  has nearly thirty years of experience in juvenile and criminal court systems throughout \n28  the United States, it is self-evident that, before a youth is “exposed to a secure detention \nCOOLEY LLP  MEM.

Tr.] \n3  at 91:1–3.) Finally, the Government faces minimal burdens in scheduling automatic \n4  hearings and has denied cost is a principal factor. (SUF ¶ 225.) Thus, requiring ORR to \n5  institute procedural safeguards before detaining children in restrictive placements will \n6  lessen any burden by avoiding costly and unnecessarily prolonged detentions. \n7  (v)  ORR’s  failure  to  provide  interpreters  harms \nPlaintiffs’ interests. \n8 \n9  As discussed, courts routinely hold that due process requires the assistance of an \n10  interpreter. (See supra Section IV.D.1.) This right is particularly important where, as \n11  here, the vast majority of children neither speak nor understand English. (SUF ¶ 226.) \n12  Accordingly, children in ORR custody are entitled to a qualified interpreter when \n13  challenging ORR’s decisions with respect to restrictive placement. \n \n14  (vi)  ORR’s  failure  to  provide  periodic  hearings  on \nplacement decisions harms Plaintiffs’ interests. \n15 \n16  The Ninth Circuit has specifically held that immigrants at risk of prolonged \n17  detention are entitled to individualized periodic review at which they must be released \n18  unless  the  government  establishes—through  a  formal  hearing  adjudicated  by  an \n19  immigration judge—that they are a flight risk or danger to the community. Diouf v. \n20  Napolitano, 634 F.3d 1081, 1091–92 (9th Cir. 2011). Children at risk of indefinite \n21  detention in ORR custody are therefore entitled to individualized periodic reviews of \n22  their placement in restrictive facilities and such reviews must include the full panoply \n23  of procedural rights.  \n24  Likewise, “it is necessary that the child’s continuing need for commitment be \n25  reviewed  periodically  by  a  similarly  independent  procedure”  as  provided  upon \n26  confinement. Parham, 442 U.S. at 607. In Parham, periodic reviews were conducted \n27  by “at least one independent, medical review group” and were “as frequent as weekly, \n28 \nCOOLEY LLP  MEM.

The court did not rule \n2  on whether this review was sufficient but rather held that the periodic review provided \n3  reduced the risk of error and therefore was necessary. Id. at 617. Similarly, recognizing \n4  the risk of error and risk of prolonged or indefinite detention in the juvenile justice \n5  context, a majority of states, statutes and court rules explicitly ensure that detention of \n6  a juvenile in a secure detention facility does not continue indefinitely without court \n7  review. (Ex. 54 [Heldman Expert Rep.] at 1353 & App’x B (citing to 30 state statutes \n8  or court rules).) \n9  Although ORR policy provides for placement reviews at least every 30 days a \n10  child spends in a restrictive placement (SUF ¶ 209), the evidence shows that ORR has \n11  failed to provide the reviews under the mandated timeframe. (SUF ¶ 212.)23 And even \n12  when it does provide a 30-day review, the review is meaningless where children are not \n13  permitted to and do not participate or submit evidence (SUF ¶ 213),24 and are not \n \n14  allowed an opportunity to cross-examine witnesses (SUF ¶ 216).25 \n15  (vii)  ORR’s  failure  to  afford  adequate  due  process \nprotections runs contrary to prevailing state and \n16  child welfare practices. \n17  The safeguards Plaintiffs are seeking have long since been standard protocol both \n18 \n                                         \n19 \n23  Failure  to  provide  children  placed  in  secure  facilities  a  placement  review  “at \n20  minimum,  on  a  monthly  basis”  is  also  a  violation  of  the  TVPRA.  See  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1232(c)(2). Agency action “not in accordance with the law,” like the TVPRA, not \n21 \nonly violates the APA under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), but also constitutes “agency action \n22  unlawfully withheld” under § 706(1).

See Schad, 501 U.S. at 640. Plaintiffs’ expert, Professor \n2  Jessica Heldman, conducted a review of the laws and policies in all 50 states, as well as \n3  federal law and policy, relating to detention and placement of children and youth in \n4  secure and staff secure settings within juvenile justice systems. (Ex. 54 [Heldman \n5  Expert Rep.] at 1349.) Professor Heldman concluded that “the procedural protections \n6  afforded children in the juvenile justice and child welfare systems minimize the risk of \n7  erroneous and unnecessarily lengthy placements in secure and staff secure settings \n8  which can be harmful and traumatic.” (Id. at 1350.) \n9  More specifically, Professor Heldman found that in all 50 states plus the District \n10  of Columbia, children are “entitled to a hearing when they are placed in a secure \n11  detention facility.” (Id. at 1351.) Broken down by time frame, 19 states require a \n12  detention hearing within 24 hours of a youth entering a secure facility; 16 states within \n13  48 hours; and 12 states within 72 hours. In comparison, ORR provides no time frame \n \n14  nor an automatic right to a detention hearing at all. Instead, children are expected to \n15  pursue federal court review or ORR Director review on their own. This is unrealistic \n16  when ORR does not provide counsel to children in restrictive placements to challenge \n17  their placement. In 41 states plus the District of Columbia, there is an explicit right to \n18  an attorney in a detention hearing; in the 9 other states, counsel is provided “either ‘at \n19  all proceedings’ or ‘at all stages of proceedings’ under the juvenile delinquency code.” \n20  (Id. at 1352.) Additionally, the “majority of states have written policies—through \n21  statute, court rules, or both—indicating that all juveniles have a right to notice prior to \n22  their detention hearing.” (Id.) \n23  Professor  Heldman  concluded  that  “the  most  basic  state  law  protections \n24  providing the right to a hearing, representation by an attorney, and an opportunity to be \n25  heard  with  testimony,  witnesses  and  presentment  of  evidence  in  determinations \n26  regarding placement in a staff secure or secure facility exceed the procedural protections \n27  within ORR’s written policies and procedures regarding the placement of children in \n28  restrictive settings.” (Id. at 1350; SUF ¶ 220.) \nCOOLEY LLP  MEM.

Accordingly, this Court should compel ORR \n6  to: (i) provide Class Members adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard, with the \n7  opportunity  to  inspect,  confront,  present  and  rebut  evidence  through  testimony,  if \n8  necessary; (ii) articulate clear standards to initially place  or step-up  or step-down \n9  children; (iii) provide Class Members with the right to counsel to challenge their \n10  restrictive placement; (iv) provide Class Members the right to automatic hearings before \n11  a neutral factfinder regarding their placement; (v) provide interpreters; and (vi) provide \n12  periodic hearings on placement decisions.  \n13  c.  Plaintiffs’ liberty interests far outweigh the government’s \n \ninterest. \n14 \n15  The government denies that its decision to provide children with no notice or \n16  opportunity to be heard is rooted in economic burdens or administrative inconvenience. \n17  (SUF ¶ 225.) Nor could the government assert economic or administrative burden as \n18  the excuse to unilaterally deprive children of liberty without due process because the \n19  burden would be insignificant. See Beltran, 222 F. Supp. 3d at 482; see also Padilla v. \n20  Immigration & Customs Enf’t, 953 F.3d 1134, 1142 (9th Cir. 2020) (“In the context of \n21  immigration detention, it is well-settled that due process requires adequate procedural \n22  protections  to  ensure  that  the  government’s  asserted  justification  for  physical \n23  confinement outweighs the individual’s constitutionally protected interest in avoiding \n24  physical restraint.”) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, given that it is more \n25  expensive to detain children in RTC placements than in shelters (SUF ¶ 221), procedural \n26  safeguards that minimize the rate of erroneous placements in RTCs will reduce rather \n27  than increase costs to Defendants. \n28  The number of youth detained in ORR restrictive placements as of March 2020 \nCOOLEY LLP  MEM.

(See supra \n2  Section II.B.) Of the 3,632 total children in ORR care (in- and out-of-network), 91 were \n3  detained in restrictive placements, or less than 2.5% of the total ORR population. (See \n4  SUF ¶¶ 222–23). Thus, a minimal financial and administrative burden would be placed \n5  on the government to provide these additional protections to less than 2.5% of the total \n6  detained population before placing a youth in a restrictive placement. \n7  V.  PLAINTIFFS ARE ENTITLED TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON THEIR \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n8 \n9  “‘The right to be heard would be, in many cases, of little avail if it did not \n10  comprehend the right to be heard by counsel.’. . . Counsel can help delineate the issues, \n11  present the factual contentions in an orderly manner, conduct cross-examination, and \n12  generally  safeguard  the interests  of  the recipient.”  Goldberg, 397  U.S.  at 270–71 \n13  (quoting Powell, 287 U.S. at 68–69). Since the Supreme Court’s decision in Goldberg, \n \n14  the right of anyone who appears before a federal administrative agency to be represented \n15  by counsel has been a hallmark of administrative law: “A person compelled to appear \n16  in person before an agency or representative thereof is entitled to be accompanied, \n17  represented, and advised by counsel or, if permitted by the agency, by other qualified \n18  representative. A party is entitled to appear in person or by or with counsel or other duly \n19  qualified representative in an agency proceeding.” 5 U.S.C. § 555(b). \n20  Giving children in ORR custody—the vast majority of whom speak no English \n21  and have no ability to advocate for themselves within the U.S. legal system—a right to \n22  be heard will be of little practical benefit if they are denied effective assistance of \n23  counsel. Indeed, Plaintiffs’ right to legal assistance is codified in the TVPRA, see infra \n24  Section  V.A,  and  required  as  a  matter  of  due  process,  see  infra  Section  V.B. \n25  Nonetheless, the undisputed facts confirm that Defendants consistently and effectively \n26  deny  children  legal  representation  with  respect  to  their  release,  placement,  and \n27  medication decisions, see infra Section V.C, and even forbid legal services providers \n28  from using federal funds to represent children in those decisions, see infra Section V.D. \nCOOLEY LLP  MEM.

The TVPRA Grants Plaintiffs a Comprehensive Right to Counsel \n2  The TVPRA obliges ORR to “ensure, to the greatest extent practicable . . . that \n3  all unaccompanied alien children who are or have been in [its] custody . . . have counsel \n4  to represent them in legal proceedings or matters and protect them from mistreatment \n5  . . . .” 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5) (emphases added). But ORR has never issued regulations \n6  or other written guidance on the definition of “legal proceedings or matters” or what \n7  amounts to protection “from mistreatment.”  (SUF ¶ 270.)   \n8  Here, there can be little question that ORR detaining children, placing them in \n9  high-security facilities like psychiatric facilities and juvenile detention centers, and \n10  administering  psychotropic  medication  without  parental  consent  are  all  “legal \n11  proceedings or matters” within the meaning of the TVPRA. Black’s Law Dictionary \n12  defines  “matter”  as  a  “subject  under  consideration,  esp.  involving  a  dispute  or \n13  litigation.” Black’s Law Dictionary 442 (11th ed. 2019). And decisions concerning the \n \n14  fitness of custodians, placing children in psychiatric facilities or juvenile detention \n15  centers, and medicating children without parental consent are all matters routinely \n16  disputed and litigated. See, e.g., Quilloin v. Walcott, 434 U.S. 246, 255 (1978) (“We \n17  have little doubt that the Due Process Clause would be offended if a State were to force \n18  the breakup of a natural family . . . without some showing of unfitness”) (internal \n19  quotation marks omitted); Flores v. Sessions, 862 F.3d 863 (9th Cir. 2017) (considering \n20  ORR’s process for denying children’s release); Flores v. Sessions, No. 2:85-cv-4544-\n21  DMG (AGRx), ECF No. 470, at 20–24 (C.D. Cal.

Plaintiffs Are Entitled to Counsel as a Matter of Due Process  \n4  Courts have found that individuals have a due process right to legal counsel in a \n5  host of scenarios, including the termination of welfare benefits. Goldberg, 397 U.S. at \n6  270–71 (welfare recipient “must be allowed to retain an attorney”). If adult welfare \n7  recipients must be allowed to retain an attorney before benefits may be terminated, it \n8  must be true that vulnerable, detained, non-English-speaking children facing prolonged \n9  detention, step-up, or forced medication are also entitled to counsel. See generally \n10  J.D.B. v. North Carolina, 564 U.S. 261, 272 (2011) (children “as a class” “lack the \n11  capacity  to  exercise  mature  judgment  and  possess  only  an  incomplete  ability  to \n12  understand the world around them”); see also Tawadrus v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d 1099, \n13  1103 (9th Cir. 2004) (immigrant in removal proceedings entitled to counsel). As for \n \n14  children, the Ninth Circuit also has held that minors in removal proceedings “are \n15  entitled to trained legal assistance so their rights may be fully protected . . . .” Jie Lin v. \n16  Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 1014, 1033 (9th Cir. 2004). In Jie Lin v. Ashcroft, for example, the \n17  Ninth Circuit held that when a child appears in removal proceedings with “obviously \n18  unprepared” counsel, an immigration judge must “suspend the hearing and give [the \n19  child] a new opportunity to retain competent counsel or sua sponte take steps to procure \n20  competent counsel to represent [the child].” 377 F.3d at 1033 (quoting Johns v. Cty. of \n21  San Diego, 114 F.3d 874, 877 (9th Cir. 1997)). \n22  As discussed supra, ORR’s decisions with respect to release and placement \n23  implicate significant liberty interests, including the right to be free from detention, the \n24 \n                                         \n25  27 That denying Plaintiffs access to counsel violates the due process clause (see infra \nSection V.B.) likewise counsels in favor of interpreting the TVPRA to provide a \n26 \ncomprehensive right to counsel. See INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 300 (2001) (if “fairly \n27 \npossible” to interpret a statute to avoid raising serious constitutional problems, courts \nmust do so).  \n28 \nCOOLEY LLP  MEM.

(See supra Sections II, \n3  IV.) Just as the Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit have already found in the context \n4  of welfare benefits and immigration proceedings, children detained by ORR have a right \n5  to counsel to protect the liberty interests implicated by decisions concerning release, \n6  placement, and medication.  \n7  C.  ORR  Violates  Plaintiffs’  Right  to  Counsel  by  Denying  Effective \nAssistance of Counsel \n8 \n9  ORR obstructs Plaintiffs from receiving effective legal representation in myriad \n10  ways, thereby implicating their rights relating to release, placement, and medication \n11  decisions. First, as further explained infra in Section V.D, rather than ensuring access \n12  to counsel on all the matters contemplated by the TVPRA, ORR limits its funding to \n13  immigration matters only. (SUF ¶¶ 271–72.)  \n \n14  Second, ORR grants a host of actors and decision-makers—including FFS, Case \n15  Coordinators, Case Managers, and Clinicians—broad discretion to communicate (or \n16  not) with children’s legal representatives, which makes it difficult, if not impossible, \n17  for such representatives to effectively advocate for their clients. (SUF ¶¶ 234–39; see \n18  also supra Sections IV.D.) And in some cases, children’s lawyers are excluded entirely \n19  from the decision-making process. (E.g., SUF ¶ 251 (children’s lawyers excluded from \n20  30-day reviews of  placement in high security facilities); SUF ¶ 255 (ORR policy \n21  provides for no prior notice of step-up decisions).) \n22  Third, even when a child’s attorney is able to speak with someone in ORR’s \n23  decision-making tree, she often does so without the benefit of having been given all the \n24  evidence  and  information  that  ORR  relied  upon  for  its  decision—decisions  that \n25  significantly affect children’s liberty interests. (SUF ¶¶ 241, 243–44, 246, 254, 259); \n26  see also supra Section IV.D.) \n27  Fourth, ORR’s policies and practices deny attorneys any meaningful opportunity \n28  to present affirmative evidence to rebut ORR’s adverse decisions. (SUF ¶ 252; see also \nCOOLEY LLP  MEM. ISO MOT.  \nATTLOORSN AEYNSG AELTE LSA W    55  FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \nCASE NO. 2:18-CV-05741 DMG PLA \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 269-1   Filed 10/02/20   Page 70 of 73   Page ID\n \n#:9206\n1  supra Sections IV.D.) In other words, ORR’s policies provide legal counsel no role \n2  whatsoever in decisions impacting their clients’ lives.  \n3  Subjecting children to decisions relating to release, placement and medication \n4  without affording meaningful access to legal counsel is incompatible with Plaintiffs’ \n5  rights to counsel, grounded in both the TVPRA and the Constitution.28  \n6  D.  ORR Unlawfully Bars Legal Service Providers from Using Federal \nFunding to Represent Children with Respect To Release, Placement, \n7  and Administration of Psychotropic Medication  \n8  Defendants admit that they forbid legal services providers from using federal \n9  funds to represent children in opposition to ORR’s wishes. (SUF ¶¶ 271–72.) But \n10  Congress specifically gave children whom ORR takes into its custody the right to legal \n11  representation in legal matters and to protect them from mistreatment in the TVPRA:  \n12  The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall ensure, to the greatest \nextent practicable and consistent with section 292 of the Immigration and \n13 \n  Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1362), that all unaccompanied alien children \n14  who are or have been in the custody of the Secretary or the Secretary of \nHomeland Security . . . have counsel to represent them in legal proceedings \n15 \nor  matters  and  protect  them  from  mistreatment,  exploitation,  and \n16  trafficking.  \n17  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5) (emphasis added); see also Homeland Security Act of 2002, \n18  § 462(b) Pub. L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135 (2002) (“HSA”) (“[T]he Director of the \n19  Office of Refugee Resettlement shall be responsible for . . . developing a plan to be \n20  submitted to Congress on how to ensure that qualified and independent legal counsel is \n21 \n                                         \n22 \n28 ORR’s attempt to exclude attorneys from the process altogether is significantly more \n23  egregious than other cases finding violations of the right to counsel.

As such, ORR’s denials \n13  of Class Members’ sponsor applications and step-up decisions violate the Constitution \n \n14  and should be set aside. See 5 U.S.C § 706(2)(B); Asse Intern., Inc., 803 F.3d at 1073 \n15  n.12 (setting aside agency action as contrary to constitutional right); see also Atterbury \n16  v.

No. 94, Title II, 133 Stat. \n2534 (2019) (appropriating $160 million to “be used for legal services, child advocates, \n21 \nand post-release services”). \n22 \n30 ORR decisions with respect to release and placement are “final agency decisions.”  \n(See SUF ¶¶ 57, 167; Ex. 1 [ORR Policy Guide] §2.7 (“Only ORR (or ACF) has the \n23 \nauthority  to  make  the  final  decision  on  a  release.”);  id.  § 1.3.2  (“The  ORR/FFS \n24 \nsupervisor makes a final placement decision on the level of care.”); ECF No. 141 at 11–\n25  13 (concluding “that the policies and/or practices identified in the FAC constitute final \nagency actions”).) \n26 \n31 Under 5 U.S.C § 706(2)(A), the Court’s review is limited to the administrative record \n27 \nwith limited exceptions.

See 8 U.S.C. \n7  § 1232(c)(2)(A); supra Section IV.D. ORR’s obstruction of children’s legal counsel’s \n8  involvement  in  decisions  relating  to  release,  placement,  and  administration  of \n9  psychotropic  medication  likewise  violate  the  express  provisions  of  the  TVPRA. \n10  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5); supra Section V.  \n11  By denying sponsors and placing children in restrictive settings without affording \n12  any opportunity to be heard or to be represented by legal counsel, ORR’s policies violate \n13  the Constitution, the TVPRA, and, in turn, the APA. Accordingly, this Court should \n \n14  compel ORR to afford basic due process protections to Plaintiffs, as requested herein \n15  and in the concurrently filed Proposed Order. See 5 U.S.C § 706(1); Garcia-Ramirez v. \n16  ICE, 2020 WL 3604041, at *83 (holding that APA claims under 5 U.S.C. § 706(1) and \n17  § 706(2) can work together such that if you can show an agency acted not in accordance \n18  with the law, you have shown that agency action has been “unlawfully withheld or \n19  unreasonably delayed”).  \n20  VII.  PLAINTIFFS ARE ENTITLED TO A PERMANENT INJUNCTION \n21  To obtain a permanent injunction, a plaintiff must show: (1) that it has suffered \n22  an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are \n23  inadequate to compensate for the injury; (3) that the remedy in equity is warranted upon \n24  consideration of the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant; and \n25  (4) that the permanent injunction being sought would not hurt public interest. See, e.g., \n26  Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. 305, 311–313 (1982); Amoco Production Co. \n27  v. Gambell, 480 U.S. 531, 542 (1987).  \n28  Plaintiffs’ deprivation of liberty clearly constitutes irreparable harm. The harm \nCOOLEY LLP  MEM.

See Garcia Ramirez v. \n4  ICE, 2020 WL 3604041, at *148 (holding that “deprivations of physical liberty are the \n5  sort of actual and imminent injuries that constitute irreparable harm”); see also Saravia, \n6  905 F.3d at 1143; Padilla, 953 F.3d at 1147-48. Nor are money damages an option in \n7  this case. Finally, given the substantiality of the interests involved (see supra Sections \n8  IV.A and IV.D), and the minimal burden that would be imposed on the government to \n9  revise its policies and procedures (see supra Section IV.D), a permanent injunction \n10  would not hurt the public interest, but instead promote it; the balance therefore tips \n11  significantly in Plaintiffs’ favor. Padilla, 953 F.3d at 1147 (“‘it is always in the public \n12  interest to prevent the violation of a party’s constitutional rights’”) (quoting Melendres \n13  v. Arpaio, 695 F.3d 990, 1002 (9th Cir. 2012)).32 \n \n14  VIII.

Within the same 1 business day timeframe, the case manager creates a new \nsponsor record or updates an existing record in the UAC Portal. Prior to creating \na new record, the case manager searches for the potential sponsor's name and \naddress in the UAC Portal to check if the sponsor has previously applied for \nsponsorship or if the address was previously used for sponsorship (see Q.!J.!~k \nGlance: How to Check for Previous Sponsorship}. A UAC may have multiple \npotential sponsors, but the case manager must designate one sponsor as the \n\"primary sponsor\" in the Sponsor Information section of the UAC Portal. \nNOTES: \n•  Creating the sponsor record initiates the sponsor assessment process \nused to evaluate a sponsor.

The case manager ensures that all the UAC's belongings and documents are collected \nand ready to provide to the UAC and sponsor at time of release (see .Q~.~~-~. . G!.~.n~.~.;. \niJ \nItems That Accompany UAC at Release). \n2.  Immediately before the UAC physically leaves the program, the case manager: \n•  \"Exits\" the UAC from the program in the UAC Portal which generates a \n\"trigger report,\" the Verification of Release. The case manager prints out a \ncopy for the UAC and sponsor upon release. \nDefendants' Prod.

CO il\"el \nNOTE: To exit the program, the case manager goes to the Discharge section of the \nUAC Portal and clicks on \"add new\" to the Program Exit form. The date of discharge \nwill be auto-populated on the current date and the type of discharge will be \npopulated based on the selections made in the Discharge Notification Form. Click \n\"e!CO \n\"save\" to discharge the UAC from the program. \n3.  The Case Manager coordinates with the legal service provider or attorney of record to \nensure completion of the EOIR Change of Venue Motion and EOIR Alien's Change of \nAddress Form/Immigration Court {EOIR- 33/IC}, and to provide the sponsor and UAC with \ninstructions for filing Change of Venue Motions and Change of Address forms if the sponsor \nsubsequently moves. \nBlank copies of each immigration court's Change of Address Form may be accessed here: \nhttps://www.justice.gov/eoir/form-eoir-33-eoir-immigration-court-listing \n4.  Within 24 hours after the UAC's physical release from the care provider, the case \nmanager sends the Discharge Notification Form to DHS and other stakeholders based \non the template below. COil~ \n5.  The case manager notifies the ICE Office of Chief Counsel and EOIR Immigration Court \nAdministrator using the trigger report, ORR Notification to ICE Chief Counsel Release of \nUnaccompanied Alien Child to Sponsor and Request to Change Address, which is stored \nin the UAC's file in the Portal. Fig. 2.18 is a partial snapshot of the form. There are \nregional variations regarding how this notice is sent, some programs send via email and \nmail. Other programs mail the notice.

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY \n2  This Court should deny Plaintiffs’ extraordinary request for class-wide injunctive \n3  relief.  Plaintiffs’ claims lack merit, their motion rests on a mistaken view of the facts, \n4  and Plaintiffs fail to account for the many equitable and harm-related considerations \n5  that weigh strongly against the relief that Plaintiffs seek.   \n6  The COVID-19 pandemic has presented tremendous challenges for our Nation.  \n7  But the Executive Branch is responding to those challenges for everyone in the country \n8  and for everyone who is entitled to its protection—including for the children at issue in \n9  this case.  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Service (HHS) Office of Refugee \n10  Resettlement (ORR) is carefully, thoroughly, and expeditiously safeguarding the health \n11  and interests of the unaccompanied alien children (UACs) entrusted to its care under \n12  federal law.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1232.  Plaintiffs’ claims in their TRO motion are not well \n13  taken and do not warrant a disruption of ORR’s careful efforts to fulfill its statutory \n14  mandate.  And their request for TRO relief is fundamentally improper:  The purpose of \n15  a TRO is to maintain the status quo, yet the broad and hasty relief that Plaintiffs seek \n16  would be highly disruptive and would violate the TVPRA.  Indeed, the rushed and \n17  sweeping relief that Plaintiffs seek threatens to increase the risk of harm to UACs in \n18  ORR custody.  The Court should deny this motion for the multiple reasons.  \n19  Plaintiffs’ arguments fail on the merits.  To start, far from showing that ORR is \n20  violating the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2008 (TVPRA), the government is \n21  complying with the TVPRA, and the relief requested by Plaintiffs would violate that \n22  statute.  The TVPRA imposes robust and thorough procedures that ORR must use, all \n23  to the end of safeguarding the welfare of children in its care, which includes both its \n24  obligation to safely and expeditiously release children to approved sponsors under 8 \n25  U.S.C. § 1232(c)(3)(A) and to maintain safe custody of those children under 8 U.S.C. \n26  § 1232(c)(2)(A).  ORR’s procedures are suited to safeguard these interests during the \n27  COVID-19 pandemic.  In  fulfilling its TVPRA obligations for safe custody, ORR \n28  maintains  rigorous  protocols  for  handling  infectious  diseases  for  children  in  care, \n \n- 1 - \nDefendants’ Opposition to TRO  \n\n \nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230   Filed 03/27/20   Page 6 of 30   Page ID #:5463\n \n \n \n1  including mandatory staff training requirements, isolation capabilities across ORR’s \n2  network of care providers that are suitable for housing children, hygiene education, and \n3  medical screenings.  See ORR Guide § 3.4.6. ORR also issued extensive field guidance \n4  on the COVID-19 pandemic to its care provider network on March 2, March 13, March \n5  19, March 20, and March 23, which implements important safety measures such as \n6  mandatory  temperature  checks  for  children  and  visitors;  placement  and  travel \n7  restrictions to and from at-risk facilities; and heightened medical care.  See Ex. R-W.   \n8  Against the backdrop of ORR’s intensified efforts to protect the health and well-\n9  being of UACs in its care and custody during the COVID-19 pandemic, Plaintiffs’ \n10  miscalculated  assertions  of  injury  have  led  them  to  ask  that  this  Court  impose  a \n11  truncated and unlawful standard for release of those children (to un-vetted sponsors) \n12  and require administrative hearings for all denied sponsors where ORR would need to \n13  affirmatively prove that a sponsor would harm or neglect a child to avoid release.  Br. \n14  21; Pls. Proposed Order 41.  That relief would upend the TVPRA’s requirement of safe \n15  reunification, which requires that the sponsor be “capable of providing for the child’s \n16  physical and mental well-being.”  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(3)(A).  The unsubstantiated claims \n17  of harm that Plaintiffs allege do not justify the far-sweeping relief they seek.  Plaintiffs \n18  disregard that the COVID-19 response requires flexibility as the situation develops and \n19  given the varying circumstances in different parts of the country.  Plaintiffs filed an \n20  emergency TRO motion without any real effort to understand the significant actions \n21  being taken by ORR in response to this fast-developing challenge.  And Plaintiffs \n22  indiscriminately  lump  all  congregate-care  facilities  together,  irrespective  of  size, \n23  location, and set-up. These differing circumstances show that class-wide resolution \n24  would override the discretion ORR and care facilities need to manage this developing \n25  and changing crisis across the country to protect children and would disregard ORR’s \n26  statutory obligations of safe and expeditious relief. \n27  Plaintiffs’ TRO request also conflicts with the Flores Settlement Agreement.  \n28  Flores resolved due-process claims concerning the medical care of minors in custody \n \n- 2 - \nDefendants’ Opposition to TRO  \n\n \nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230   Filed 03/27/20   Page 7 of 30   Page ID #:5464\n \n \n \n1  as well as release standards and procedures.  Plaintiffs cannot bring claims here alleging \n2  that these policies and procedures violate the Due Process Clause; these claims are \n3  barred by res judicata.  If there are concerns that Flores is now being violated, those \n4  claims  must proceed in  a  Flores  enforcement action.   Plaintiffs cannot avoid that \n5  limitation  by  asserting  that  their  claims  have  been  brought  exclusively  under  the \n6  TVPRA or that the TVPRA (or Flores) creates rights that they can enforce under the \n7  Due Process Clause.  As this Court has held, the TVPRA is coextensive with Flores \n8  when it comes to release provisions.  And the Agreement’s care provisions are far more \n9  detailed than the TVPRA and ORR, under this Court’s ruling, provides medical care \n10  that seeks compliance with applicable state laws.  Plaintiffs should be precluded from \n11  arguing here that the medical care standards they negotiated for, and agreed to, in Flores \n12  are insufficient.  If Plaintiffs are no longer satisfied with their negotiated and agreed-to \n13  rights under Flores, then they should seek to amend that agreement.  Having not done \n14  so, their claims should fail because Plaintiffs cannot here claim that the medical care \n15  being provided does not comply with the Flores Settlement Agreement. \n16  All of Plaintiffs’ TRO  merits arguments also fail because none  of  the  facts \n17  relevant to their TRO request are pleaded in their operative (first amended) complaint \n18  (“complaint” or “Compl.,” ECF No. 80), and thus none of the certified classes are \n19  appropriate  to  address  their  new  allegations  of  injury.    The  complaint  makes  no \n20  allegations about any of the protocols that ORR has implemented to protect those in its \n21  care and custody from COVID-19, or the general conditions, cleanliness, or medical \n22  treatment inside any of ORR’s grantee care facilities where UACs reside while awaiting \n23  unification with a safe sponsor.  And notably, the operative complaint does not seek to \n24  address  “extraordinary  circumstances”  like  COVID-19—rather,  it  seeks  an \n25  administrative appeal for minors denied unification to otherwise qualified sponsors \n26  under the TVPRA.  Compl. ¶¶ 179-90.  Plaintiffs are thus attempting to bring, by TRO \n27  motion, new claims based on new facts to seek new relief.  Plaintiffs must file a new \n28  complaint  and  withstand  the  rigorous  class-certification  procedures  before  being \n \n- 3 - \nDefendants’ Opposition to TRO  \n\n \nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230   Filed 03/27/20   Page 8 of 30   Page ID #:5465\n \n \n \n1  granted this relief.  Given the widely varying circumstances presented by COVID-19, \n2  and the quickly changing crisis, class resolution very likely would not be appropriate if \n3  it were sought.  But in any event, certification of a class for their original claims does \n4  not provide roving authority to obtain class-wide oversight on any issue of concern. \n5  Even if Flores were disregarded and Plaintiffs could obtain TRO relief in this \n6  case on a due-process theory, Plaintiffs fail to show a due-process violation arising from \n7  either a lack of adequate medical care or unsafe conditions.  The extensive measures \n8  that ORR has taken in coordination with the CDC and other components of HHS \n9  confirms the contrary.  ORR has gone to extraordinary lengths to care for children in a \n10  profoundly challenging situation, while also fulfilling its statutory mandate under the \n11  TVPRA  for expeditious release of  children  to custodians who will care for them, \n12  implementing  measures  both  to  prevent  the  spread  of  COVID-19  and  provide \n13  appropriate medical care in the case of infection.  ORR: (1) has stopped placements in \n14  New York, California, and Washington; (2) has limited air travel to local placements; \n15  (3) requires all care providers to conduct temperature checks for every UAC in care \n16  twice each day; (4) elevates all medical cases with flu-like symptoms; (5) maintains \n17  medically appropriate isolate capabilities at all of its shelters; and (6) restricts access to \n18  all visitors who display either an elevated temperature or flu-like symptoms.  See Ex. \n19  Q-W.  For medical care, ORR provides all UACs with testing at the recommendation \n20  of medical personnel, has full-time medical staff on-site, and isolates anyone who either \n21  tests positive or is suspected of exposure to the COVID-19 virus.  Id.  ORR is continuing \n22  to monitor the fast-developing situation, and will make further changes to policies as \n23  warranted.  See e.g., Ex. R at 1.  These measures show neither a violation of the Due \n24  Process Clause’s requirement for adequate medical care, nor deliberate indifference to \n25  protecting the safety and well-being of minors in its custody. \n26   Plaintiffs also fail to show how their alleged injury would be redressed by the \n27  relief they seek.  They provide no explanation of how the relevant actors could safely \n28  undertake Plaintiffs’ proposed mass transit, within days, of hundreds of children across \n \n- 4 - \nDefendants’ Opposition to TRO  \n\n \nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230   Filed 03/27/20   Page 9 of 30   Page ID #:5466\n \n \n \n1  the country at a time when public transportation is halted or severely restricted given \n2  the risks it poses to travelers and others.  Nor have they shown why release to un-vetted \n3  sponsors who may have differing home situations would be safer than remaining in a \n4  facility with a medical staff on call 24 hours a day in conjunction with the normal \n5  TVPRA vetting process that Congress required.  And Plaintiffs have not shown that \n6  their demand for administrative hearings during a time of strained resources for ORR \n7  would redress the harm that they allege.  Plaintiffs’ requested additional procedures are \n8  not required under the Due Process Clause, as explained in Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. \n9  292, 303 (1993), and would take crucial agency employees away from the vital task of \n10  releasing  children  to  vetted  sponsors  and  keeping  them  safe  and  healthy  in  the \n11  meantime.  \n12  The remaining injunctive factors weigh against the extraordinary remedy that \n13  Plaintiffs seek.  As explained, Plaintiffs have not shown on a class-wide basis that every \n14  child in ORR care faces the same or a substantially similar risk of injury, given the \n15  significant differences in size, location, and capacity across ORR’s network of care \n16  providers.  Indeed, most of ORR’s facilities are operating far below capacity, facilitating \n17  practices recommended by the CDC such as social distancing.  Plaintiffs’ claims of \n18  harm rely on guidance issued to prisons and jails, not congregate-care facilities housing \n19  children that often have to take account of many other factors such as whether the \n20  children, who are always in some form of custody, have a safe home in which to be \n21  placed.  Even then, ORR’s efforts to mitigate the risks of COVID-19 meet or exceed \n22  those that the CDC recommends for other types of congregate-care facilities.  Ex. AA \n23  ¶ 20.  Nor have Plaintiffs shown that the public interest weighs in their favor given the \n24  operational reality of what  they seek would entail.  Plaintiffs’ dangerous proposal \n25  potentially involves transporting hundreds or thousands of children across the country, \n26  contrary to the CDC’s shelter-in-place guidance, to un-vetted potential applicants, some \n27  of whom are strangers to the child, along with requiring ORR to implement potentially \n28  hundreds of administrative hearings for the remaining children during a pandemic.  \n \n- 5 - \nDefendants’ Opposition to TRO  \n\n \nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230   Filed 03/27/20   Page 10 of 30   Page ID\n #:5467\n \n \n \n1  II.  BACKGROUND \n2  A. ORR’s Robust Actions \n3  Defendants’ official response to COVID-19 dates at least to January 31, 2020, \n4  when the Secretary of Health and Human Services declared COVID-19 a public health \n5  emergency.  See Ex. AA ¶ 13.  From the first appearance of COVID-19 in the United \n6  States, ORR has monitored the developing public health situation, including both \n7  federal and state mandates applicable to the jurisdictions in which ORR grantee care \n8  provider  facilities—the  locations where UAC in ORR custody and care reside—\n9  operate.  Id. ¶ 17-18.  ORR has provided the facilities with regular updates on infection \n10  prevention  and  control  protocols,  and  has  issued  guidance  on  the  screening  and \n11  management of potential COVID-19 exposure among UACs, facility personnel, and \n12  visitors, consistent with official guidance from the Center for Disease Control (CDC), \n13  an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services.  Id. \n14  ORR is  equipped  to deal with  viral and bacterial outbreaks.  It has years of \n15  experience  in  identifying,  containing,  and  treating  contagious  diseases,  including \n16  seasonal influenza (flu), measles (rubella), mumps (parotitis), chicken pox (varicella), \n17  and tuberculosis.  See Ex. Q ¶ 15.  Even before the spread of COVID-19, ORR was \n18  ahead  of  the  curve  in  developing  protocols,  policies,  and  experience  relating  to \n19  infectious disease containment.  See id.   \n20  ORR’s  policies  relating  to  managing  communicable  diseases  are  extensive, \n21  including policies requiring routine assessment of travel history when a child arrives at \n22  a care provider program, as well as medical screenings and vaccinations within 48 \n23  hours; ability to isolate or quarantine individuals for infectious disease control; hand \n24  hygiene and respiratory etiquette educational efforts; and established communicable \n25  disease reporting to the local health authority.  Ex. Q ¶ 16 (citing ORR Policy Guide § \n26  3.4.6 (Management of Communicable Diseases); § 3.4.7 (Maintaining Health Care \n27  Records and Confidentiality)). \n28 \n \n- 6 - \nDefendants’ Opposition to TRO  \n\n \nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230   Filed 03/27/20   Page 11 of 30   Page ID\n #:5468\n \n \n \n1  Even  accounting  for  its  significant  experience  successfully  managing \n2  communicable diseases, ORR’s response to COVID-19 remains highly responsive and \n3  adaptable to the particular challenges of COVID-19.  See Ex. Q ¶ 14, 17.  To enhance \n4  its efforts to prevent the risk of exposure to COVID-19, ORR has mandated that all \n5  visitors  and  staff  seeking  to  enter  any  grantee  care  provider  facility  must  answer \n6  COVID-19 screening questions and submit to a mandatory temperature check.  Id. ¶ 18.  \n7  Except for UACs being processed for admission to the particular facility, grantee care-\n8  provider facilities are required to deny access to anyone who has a fever of 100℉ or \n9  above; who exhibits symptoms of an acute respiratory infection; who has had contact \n10  with someone with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis in the previous 14 days; who has \n11  been tested for COVID-19 and is awaiting test results; or in the previous 14 days, has \n12  traveled to an area identified by the CDC as having widespread, sustained community \n13  transmission of COVID-19.  Id.  All UACs entering ORR care are screened for COVID-\n14  19 exposure or symptoms consistent with CDC COVID-19 guidelines.  Id. ¶ 19.  UACs \n15  at risk of COVID-19 exposure based on reported travel history, but without symptoms, \n16  are quarantined and monitored for 14 days.  Id. ¶ 20.  UACs who exhibit COVID-19 \n17  symptoms will be isolated and tested in consultation with the local health authority.  Id. \n18  Alongside measures to prevent exposure to COVID-19, ORR has instituted a \n19  rigorous monitoring regime to assure that any UAC who exhibits symptoms of COVID-\n20  19 is identified and appropriately isolated in consultation with the local health authority.  \n21  Ex. Q ¶ 20-21.  During this time in isolation, a child receives the same services as non-\n22  isolated peers in the same facility, which includes recreation and counseling, with \n23  adjustments—particularly to education services—to accommodate proper infection-\n24  control procedures.  Id. ¶ 28.  ORR has also required that each grantee care-provider \n25  facility monitor the temperature of every UAC in care.  Id. ¶ 22. Children’s temperatures \n26  are recorded twice daily.  Id.  If any UAC has a temperature above 100℉, the grantee \n27  care provider must immediately alert ORR, and must do so each day any child has a \n28  temperature over 100℉.  Id.  Further, any UAC who exhibit symptoms consistent with \n \n- 7 - \nDefendants’ Opposition to TRO  \n\n \nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230   Filed 03/27/20   Page 12 of 30   Page ID\n #:5469\n \n \n \n1  COVID-19 will be  immediately  isolated and referred  for evaluation  by a  licensed \n2  medical provider, in consultation with local health authorities, and tested for COVID-\n3  19, if that is the health provider’s guidance.  Id. ¶ 23. \n4  The isolation procedures are the same for any UAC determined to be at risk for \n5  COVID-19 exposure or infection.  Ex. Q ¶ 24.  More specifically, the affected UAC \n6  will be provided a private room, with a closed door and bathroom access, preferably a \n7  private bathroom that is not used by others.  Id.  State and local health officials, along \n8  with ORR’s health division, are notified and consulted for additional guidance on risk \n9  assessment, symptom monitoring, and isolation/quarantine.  Id.  Any facility personnel \n10  who  enter  an  occupied  isolation  room  are  required  to  wear  personal  protective \n11  equipment, including an N95 respiratory mask and goggles or a face shield, per CDC \n12  guidelines.  Id. ¶ 25.  If a UAC in isolation needs to leave the isolation room for any \n13  reason (e.g., to use the bathroom, to attend a medical appointment, etc.), the UAC must \n14  wear a surgical mask.  Id. ¶ 26.  If a UAC needs to be transported to a health clinic or \n15  other off-site location, the facility must notify the local health department for guidance \n16  on proper precautions during transport.  Id. ¶ 27.  The facility is also required to alert \n17  the  intended  destination  in  advance  so  proper  infection  control  measures  may  be \n18  undertaken.  Id.  UACs are required to remain in isolation until cleared by appropriate \n19  health officials.  Id. ¶ 28.  \n20  Besides  extensive  procedures  to  limit  exposure  to  individual  facilities  and \n21  address  and  treat  any  affected  UAC  who  may  have  COVID-19,  ORR  has  also \n22  implemented further protocols to limit the overall risk of spreading COVID-19.  ORR \n23  has stopped the placement of UAC at grantee care facilities in California, New York, \n24  and Washington due to COVID-19 outbreaks among the general public in those states.  \n25  Ex. Q ¶ 32.  ORR continues to monitor applicable state guidance to determine whether \n26  conditions warrant the suspension of placements in any particular locale, and will make \n27  changes as circumstances require.  Id.  Further, ORR prioritizes local facility placements \n28  for UACs in order to limit the need for travel on commercial airliners, but may use \n \n- 8 - \nDefendants’ Opposition to TRO  \n\n \nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230   Filed 03/27/20   Page 13 of 30   Page ID\n #:5470\n \n \n \n1  commercial airliners to reunify a UAC with a sponsor, if it is safe to do so.  Id. ¶ 33.  \n2  Care providers must assess the safety of the UAC’s ultimate destination, to anticipate \n3  logistical issues associated with COVID-19 disruptions.  Id.  Care providers also must \n4  consult with a Federal Field Specialist (who is an ORR employee) if a UAC will be \n5  traveling to a jurisdiction with widespread COVID-19 community transmission and \n6  resulting shelter-in-place order.  Id.  In such cases, release should be postponed until it \n7  is safe for the UAC to travel.  Id. \n8  Before the outbreak, ORR had been working on a telehealth initiative to increase \n9  UAC access to healthcare resources. Ex. Q ¶ 34.  In light of orders restricting movement \n10  in New York and California, ORR rolled out its telehealth program in those locations \n11  ahead of schedule in order to ensure care provider facilities are able to provide UACs \n12  with access to medical care without leaving facilities.  Id. \n13  As of March 26, 2020, there were four confirmed cases among UACs in ORR \n14  care provider facilities.  Ex. Q ¶ 35.  All four cases were in a single facility in New York \n15  State, and the affected UACs are currently in isolation, per ORR and CDC guidelines, \n16  and are receiving appropriate monitoring and medical care.  Id.  Eighteen UACs in the \n17  care provider network had been tested, with at least eleven returning negative results.  \n18  Ex. Q ¶ 36.  While the tests were pending, pursuant to CDC Guidance, any UAC who \n19  had undergone COVID-19 testing was considered presumptively positive until results \n20  are available (usually, within three or four days after testing).  Ex. Q ¶ 37.  Eight \n21  program staff/contractors or foster parents at five care-provider programs located in \n22  New York, Washington, and Texas have self-reported testing positive for COVID-19. \n23  ORR’s medical team and the affected programs have worked in close coordination with \n24  the  local  public-health  departments  on  appropriate  public-health  measures,  which \n25  typically  involve  self-quarantine  at  home,  and  the  tracking  and  monitoring  of  the \n26  affected staff members’ contacts within the care-provider facility, per CDC guidance. \n27  Ex. Q ¶ 38.  The protocols discussed above are in place to prevent the further spread of \n28 \n \n- 9 - \nDefendants’ Opposition to TRO  \n\n \nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230   Filed 03/27/20   Page 14 of 30   Page ID\n #:5471\n \n \n \n1  COVID-19, and ORR is providing medical care to those affected children.  See Ex. Q \n2  ¶ 39.  \n3  CDC has issued guidance on COVID-19  containment  in various  congregate \n4  settings, including colleges, nursing homes, prisons, and homeless shelters. Ex. Q ¶ 36.  \n5  ORR considered the CDC guidance when developing its own COVID-19 procedures, \n6  vetted its COVID-19 procedures with CDC, and understands that public health experts \n7  at CDC agree that the ORR procedures are consistent with CDC guidance.  Id.  Indeed, \n8  CDC has advised that “ORR’s current COVID-19 procedures are consistent with CDC \n9  guidances  for  congregate  settings;  they  direct  grantee  care-provider  facilities  to \n10  implement both containment and mitigation measures. In some respects, ORR’s current \n11  COVID-19  procedures  actually  exceed  those  set  forth  in  the  CDC  guidances  to \n12  congregate care facilities.”  Ex. AA ¶ 20. \n13  B. Plaintiffs’ TRO Motion \n14  Plaintiffs filed their TRO papers on March 25.  Plaintiffs acknowledge that in \n15  light of  the COVID-19 pandemic, ORR recently adopted safety  measures for its \n16  congregate-care facilities and the unaccompanied minors in ORR care.  Pl. Br. 7-\n17  8.  They claim, however, that ORR guidelines fail to comply with safety measures \n18  from CDC and the medical community.  Br. 8.  Plaintiffs suggest that “ORR Guidance \n19  makes no mention of requiring or encouraging social or physical distancing between \n20  children or staff, nor of limiting the gathering of groups of children or staff within \n21  facilities.”  Br. 8-9 (citing Graves Decl.; Wang Decl.; Ex. K).1  And they suggest that \n22                                              \n1 The materials submitted with Plaintiffs’ TRO request should be given minimal \n23 \nweight.  See Orr v. Bank of America, NT & SA, 285 F.3d 764, 773-74 (9th Cir. 2002); \n24  L.R. 7-6, 7-7 (mandating that the declarations “shall contain only factual, evidentiary \nmatter and shall conform as far as possible to the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. \n25 \n56(c)(4).”).    Plaintiffs’  declarations  are  replete  with  hearsay  and  speculation, \n26  improperly attempt to lay the foundation necessary for expert opinion, and are of \ntenuous relevance to litigation involving UACs in shelters.  E.g., Meyers Decl. \n27 \n(prisons and jails); Graves Decl. (populations other than ORR children).  These and \n28 \nother exhibits present no factual evidence or expert opinion upon which the Court \n \n- 10 - \nDefendants’ Opposition to TRO  \n\n \nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230   Filed 03/27/20   Page 15 of 30   Page ID\n #:5472\n \n \n \n1  ORR’s COVID-19 guidelines “fall far below federal, state, and local mandates to \n2  reduce  the  spread  of  COVID-19,”  highlighting  states’  general  “shelter  in  place” \n3  orders, as well as protocols for homeless shelters and prisons.  Br. 10-12 (citations \n4  omitted).  Plaintiffs do not cite any state guidance requiring congregate care facilities \n5  to release all children in care, nor could they.  See Ex. X-Y (NY and CA guidance for \n6  children to remain in congregate care). \n7  Plaintiffs allege that Defendants are in violation of the TVPRA by continuing \n8  to hold unaccompanied minors in shelters, specifically in instances where they have \n9  viable sponsors.  Br. 13-16.  They also claim that ORR is violating the terms of the \n10 \nFlores Settlement Agreement by not releasing UACs to remain in its care, alleging \n11 \nthat said facilities are both unsafe and unsanitary.  Br. 17.  And they claim ORR \n12 \nviolated UACs’ procedural and substantive due-process rights by exposing them to \n13 \ndangerous conditions.  Br. 18-22.  \n14 \nFinally, Plaintiffs claim that because of “the rapid spread of COVID-19 across \n15 \nthe country and the impossibility of maintaining proper social distancing in ORR \n16 \ncongregate care facilities, Class Members face an unacceptable risk of contracting \n17 \nCOVID-19 in ORR custody.”  Br. 23.  They ask the Court to enter a TRO ordering \n18 \nthe immediate release of hundreds of UACs from congregate care. \n19 \nIII.  ARGUMENT \n20 \nThe Court should deny Plaintiffs’ TRO motion.  “When ‘a plaintiff has failed \n21 \nto show the likelihood of success on the merits, [the Court] need not consider the \n22 \nremaining three [elements]” for TRO relief.  See Garcia v. Google, Inc., 786 F.3d 733, \n23 \n740 (9th Cir. 2015) (en banc) (internal quotations and formatting omitted).  Plaintiffs \n24 \n                                            \n25 \nshould rely in finding facts.  Finally, all of Plaintiffs’ exhibits that focus on the nature \n26  and infectiousness of COVID-19 (see, e.g., Ex. B; Ex. C; Ex. E) should be afforded \nminimal weight compared with evidence from HHS, which houses true authorities: \n27 \nthe Centers for Disease Control and the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and \n28 \nResponse. \n \n- 11 - \nDefendants’ Opposition to TRO  \n\n \nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230   Filed 03/27/20   Page 16 of 30   Page ID\n #:5473\n \n \n \n1  cannot make this showing.  And considerations of harms and the equities strongly cut \n2  against a TRO, particularly where the sweeping and rushed relief that Plaintiffs seek \n3  threatens to increase harm to the UACs in ORR’s care.  Finally, Plaintiffs’ request for \n4  relief is fundamentally improper.  The purpose a TRO or preliminary injunction “is \n5  merely to preserve the relative positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be \n6  held.”  University of Texas v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981).  Yet the relief \n7  that Plaintiffs seek would not maintain the status quo:  it would disrupt the status quo \n8  and violate federal law. \n9  A. Plaintiffs Fail to Show a Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n1.  Plaintiffs’  TVPRA  Claim  Fails  Because  ORR  is  Fulfilling  its \n10 \nObligations Under the TVPRA by Implementing Careful Protocols \n11 \nin Response to COVID-19 and Plaintiffs’ Proposed Relief Would \n12  Force ORR to Violate those Obligations  \nORR is addressing the challenges presented by COVID-19 consistently with the \n13 \nTVPRA’s requirements.  The TVPRA imposes robust and thorough procedures on \n14 \nORR, all to the end of safeguarding the welfare of children in its care, which includes \n15 \nboth its obligation to safely and expeditiously release children to approved sponsors \n16 \nunder 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(3)(A), and to maintain safe custody of those children under \n17 \nSection (c)(2)(A). ORR’s procedures are particularly suited to safeguard these interests \n18 \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic.  In fulfilling its TVPRA obligations, ORR maintains \n19 \nrigorous  protocols  for  handling  infectious  diseases  for  children  in  care,  including \n20 \nmandatory staff training requirements, quarantine capabilities across ORR’s network of \n21 \ncare providers that are suitable for housing children, hygiene education, and medical \n22 \nscreenings.  See ORR Guide § 3.4.6.  These procedures were formalized in 2015, but \n23 \nhave been in place even longer.  To further ensure the safety of children in care, ORR \n24 \nalso issued extensive field guidance on the COVID-19 pandemic to its care provider \n25 \nnetwork on March 2, March 13, March 19, March 20, and March 23, which implements \n26 \nimportant safety measures such as mandatory temperature checks for children and \n27 \nvisitors; placement and travel restrictions to and from at-risk facilities; and heightened \n28 \n \n- 12 - \nDefendants’ Opposition to TRO  \n\n \nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230   Filed 03/27/20   Page 17 of 30   Page ID\n #:5474\n \n \n \n1  medical care.  See Ex. R-W.  These guidelines are consistent with the approaches of \n2  state child welfare agencies who have children in congregate care, including New York \n3  and California, two epicenters of the COVID-19 pandemic.  See Ex. X-Y. \n4  Plaintiffs therefore misfire in contending that COVID-19 precautions are “all but \n5  impossible”  for  children  in  ORR  congregate  care.    Nor  have  they  explained  why \n6  management of ORR grantee facilities should work differently from the many other \n7  types of congregate care facilities like nursing homes and long-term care facilities in \n8  the United States.  They cite CDC Guidance used for jails and prisons, but the CDC has \n9  recognized  that  appropriate  COVID-19  measures  can  be  implemented  at  certain \n10  congregate  care  settings,  including  nursing  homes  and  long-term  care  facilities. \n11  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/healthcare-facilities/prevent-spread-in-\n12  long-term-care-facilities.html; see also Ex. AA ¶ 17-18, 20 (CDC declaration). \n13  In contending that ORR is violating the TRO (Br. 13-17), Plaintiffs fail to account \n14  for these significant measures that ORR has taken.  And the arguments they do make \n15  lack merit.  Plaintiffs principally contend that continuing to keeping the UACs at issue \n16  in custody for more than 30 days violates the TVPRA’s prompt-placement mandate \n17  because those children “have family or other custodians available to receive them” and \n18  “[t]hirty days should be more than enough for ORR to assess post-release risk” to them.  \n19  Br. 13-14, 16-17; see also Br. 13-17. The TVPRA erects no 30-day requirement, and \n20  Plaintiffs have provided no factual basis for grafting one into the statute when Congress \n21  has not spoken. Rather, Plaintiffs’ claims are based on mere speculation and hypothesis, \n22  citing no evidence that a significant number of periods longer than 30 days are due to \n23  improper reasons. \n24  Plaintiffs also suggest that ORR takes longer than 30 days to release the children \n25  at  issue  because  of  “discretionary  investigatory  measures”  or  “administrative \n26  inefficiency or indifference” and that such grounds are inadequate in the circumstances \n27  here.  See Br. 15-16.  But Plaintiffs cite no evidence to show that those reasons apply to \n28  the UACs here—let alone uniformly or on a class-wide basis.  And the evidence shows \n \n- 13 - \nDefendants’ Opposition to TRO  \n\n \nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230   Filed 03/27/20   Page 18 of 30   Page ID\n #:5475\n \n \n \n1  otherwise,  as  Plaintiffs  are  aware  given  their  regular  Flores  updates  on  ORR’s \n2  population in care. \n3  Indeed, far  from  showing that ORR is violating the TVPRA, the relief that \n4  Plaintiffs request itself squarely conflicts with the TVPRA.  Plaintiffs ask that the Court \n5  order ORR to release  a child  “[a]bsent good  cause based on articulable  facts that \n6  available custodian(s) would harm or neglect a class member, or that an individual class \n7  member presents an articulable danger to the public.”  Pls. Proposed Order 1.  But this \n8  standard conflicts with the TVPRA.  The standard states that ORR “may not” place a \n9  minor with a proposed custodian “unless” ORR determines that the “proposed custodian \n10  is capable of providing for the child’s physical and mental well-being,” which “at a \n11  minimum” “shall include verification of the custodian’s identity and relationship to the \n12  child, if any, as well as an independent finding that the individual has not engaged in \n13  any activity that would indicate a potential risk to the child.”  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(3)(A) \n14  (emphasis supplied). Plaintiffs ask ORR to release “[a]bsent good cause based on \n15  articulable facts that available custodian(s) would harm or neglect a class member, or \n16  that an individual class member presents an articulable danger to the public.” Pls. \n17  Proposed Order at 1 (emphasis supplied). That is, instead of demonstrating the ability \n18  to provide for the child, Plaintiffs request there simply be no articulable evidence the \n19  applicant sponsor would harm the child. \n20  Plaintiffs also ask the Court to direct ORR to provide an administrative hearing \n21  to all applicants for whom a determination has not yet been made.  Pls. Proposed Order \n22  1.  Such a hearing would consist of the right to examine evidence, an opportunity to \n23  submit evidence, and a hearing.  Id. at 1-2.  But Congress did not provide these rights \n24  in the TVPRA.  (And the Supreme Court has already said these are not required by the \n25  Due Process Clause, see Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 303 (1993) (rejecting an asserted \n26  “right to an individual hearing on whether private placement would be in the child’s \n27  ‘best interests’” when “institutional custody (despite the availability of responsible \n28 \n \n- 14 - \nDefendants’ Opposition to TRO  \n\n \nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230   Filed 03/27/20   Page 19 of 30   Page ID\n #:5476\n \n \n \n1  private custodians) is not unconstitutional in itself.”).)  There is no basis for engrafting \n2  such requirements onto the procedures here. \n3  It is true that as of March 26, 2020, there have been four confirmed COVID-19 \n4  cases among UACs in one ORR care provider facility in New York.  Ex. Q ¶ 35.  But \n5  ORR has been addressing those cases with care and expedition, including providing \n6  immediate testing of every individual suspected of exposure, quarantine, and following \n7  CDC guidance.  And importantly to the current motion seeking class-wide relief, there \n8  are no cases elsewhere in the network, and Plaintiffs have not shown that all UACs in \n9  ORR custody are at similar risk of injury.  Indeed, children in ORR care are not located \n10  in just one uniform facility, and children are not all released to comparable homes. \n11  2.   The Relief Plaintiffs Seek is Barred by the Flores Agreement  \n12 \nPlaintiffs contend that ORR has violated the Flores Settlement Agreement (Br. \n13 \n17-18), but the request for a TRO conflicts with the Agreement.  As this Court knows, \n14 \nthat Agreement remains in force and resolved due-process claims relating to the medical \n15 \ncare of minors while in custody as well as standards and procedures for their release.  \n16 \nSee  Flores  Settlement  Agreement  ¶¶ 14,  15A,  17;  Flores  v.  Sessions,  2018  WL \n17 \n10162328  (C.D.  Cal.  July  30,  2018)  (rejecting  effort  to  impose  additional  release \n18 \nprocedures under Flores Agreement or TVPRA).  Plaintiffs are “members of the class \n19 \nprotected  under  the  settlement  in  Flores.”    Compl.  ¶  2;  Order  (Nov.  2,  2018).  \n20 \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs cannot bring claims here alleging that the policies for providing \n21 \nmedical care and policies and procedures for release of minors violate the Due Process \n22 \nClause.  See SEC v. Randolph, 736 F.2d 525, 528 (9th Cir. 1984) (consent decrees have \n23 \nthe force of res judicata).  Instead, if there are concerns that the Flores Agreement is \n24 \nnow being violated, those claims must proceed in an enforcement action in the Flores \n25 \nlitigation.  See Order (Nov. 2, 2018) (“the interests of judicial economy counsel against \n26 \npermitting them to enforce the Flores Agreement in this action”); id. (citing cases laying \n27 \nout the “prohibition on duplicative actions”). \n28 \n \n- 15 - \nDefendants’ Opposition to TRO  \n\n \nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230   Filed 03/27/20   Page 20 of 30   Page ID\n #:5477\n \n \n \n1  Plaintiffs cannot avoid that limitation by asserting that their claims have been \n2  brought  exclusively  under the TVPRA or  that the TVPRA (or Flores  Agreement) \n3  creates rights that they can now enforce under the Due Process Clause.  As this Court \n4  has held, the TVPRA is coextensive with the Flores Agreement when it comes to release \n5  provisions, as “[b]oth the TVPRA and the Flores Agreement allow ORR to determine \n6  a proposed sponsor’s suitability” and in this respect “the Ninth Circuit noted that the \n7  TVPRA’s suitability requirements mirror their counterparts in the Agreement.”  Flores, \n8  2018 WL 10162328, at *2 (citing Flores, 862 F.3d at 878).  The Flores Agreement \n9  resolved claims relating to the procedures for release, and Plaintiffs should not be re-\n10  litigating those procedures here.  See id.  And under the TVPRA, ORR “may not” \n11  release unless it determines that the potential custodian is capable of caring for the \n12  minor’s physical and mental well-being.  The evaluation “shall, at a minimum, include \n13  verification of the custodian’s identity and relationship to the child, if any, as well as an \n14  independent finding that the individual has not engaged in any activity that would \n15  indicate a potential risk to the child.”  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(3)(A).  The statute thus both \n16  mandates an affirmative determination and vests the responsibility in ORR.  Plaintiffs \n17  have no basis for departing from that. \n18  And the care provisions of the Flores Settlement Agreement—in Exhibit 1 to that \n19  Agreement—are far more detailed than the TVPRA.  See 2014 WL 7152078 (describing \n20  the medical care that must be provided to UAC).  In its July 30, 2018 order, however, \n21  the  Flores  Court  ruled  that  this  Exhibit  requires  medical  care  that  complies  with \n22  applicable state laws.  See Order 3 n.5.  Plaintiffs should be precluded from arguing here \n23  that the standards of medical care they negotiated for, and agreed to, in Flores are \n24  insufficient.  If Plaintiffs are no longer happy with their negotiated and agreed-to rights \n25  under  Flores,  then  they  should  seek  amendment  of  that  agreement  either  through \n26  negotiations with the government or from the Court.  See Flores v. Sessions, No. 85-\n27  4544, ECF No. 455, at 7 (C.D. Cal. July 9, 2018) (denying the government’s motion to \n28  amend the agreement, but noting that “the parties are always free to meet and confer \n \n- 16 - \nDefendants’ Opposition to TRO  \n\n \nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230   Filed 03/27/20   Page 21 of 30   Page ID\n #:5478\n \n \n \n1  regarding any contractual amendments on which they can mutually agree”).  Further, as \n2  we explain, their claims that ORR has violated paragraph 9 of the Flores Agreement by \n3  failing to provide “suitable living accommodations” fails on the merits (Br. 17-18), as \n4  ORR’s COVID-19 protocol and procedures fully comply with existing CDC and state \n5  and local guidance, see supra 12-13, infra 18-20 (¶ 12 does not apply, because it \n6  pertains to conditions following apprehension and not for ORR licensed facilities). \n3.  Plaintiffs Cannot Succeed on the Merits Because the TRO that they \n7 \nSeek  is  Beyond  the  Scope  of  the  Complaint’s  Allegations  and  is \n8 \nImproper for Class-Wide Relief. \n9 \nPlaintiffs TRO fails for a further independent reason.  To qualify for injunctive \n10 \nrelief, Plaintiffs must also show a sufficient nexus between the injury claimed in the \n11 \nmotion and the conduct alleged in the  underlying complaint.  See  Pac. Radiation \n12 \nOncology, LLC. v. Queen’s Med. Ctr., 810 F.3d 631, 636 (9th Cir. 2015); see also \n13 \nGarcia v. Google, inc., 786 F.3d 733, 744 (9th Cir. 2015) (because of a “mismatch” \n14 \nbetween the plaintiff’s substantive copyright claim and the dangers she hoped to remedy \n15 \nthrough an injunction, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Garcia’s \n16 \nrequest for a preliminary injunction).  To that end, courts have denied motions for \n17 \ninjunctive relief that are based on allegations and claims for relief that are beyond the \n18 \nscope of the complaint.  In Sekerke v. Leo, No.: 3:19-cv-0034-GPC-RBB, 2020 WL \n19 \n619581, at *9 (S.D. Cal. Feb. 10, 2020), for example, the court denied plaintiff’s TRO \n20 \nrequest because it was premised on events that occurred after and outside of the events \n21 \nthat gave rise to the complaint.  The court ruled that if it were to grant plaintiffs’ TRO \n22 \nrequest, it “would be required to engage in a factual analysis distinct from the analysis \n23 \nrequired by the claims,” which would be improper.  Id. (citations omitted); see also, \n24 \ne.g., Northern Arapaho Tribe v. LaCounte, Nos. 60-11 & 16-60, 2017 WL 908547, at \n25 \n*3 (D. Mont. Mar. 7, 2017) (where TRO motion and complaint “present[ed] distinct \n26 \nfacts and address distinct governing statutes and regulations,” TRO motion fell “beyond \n27 \nthe scope of either Complaint in this consolidated action.”); Clark v. Bank of Am. N.A., \n28 \n \n- 17 - \nDefendants’ Opposition to TRO  \n\n \nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230   Filed 03/27/20   Page 22 of 30   Page ID\n #:5479\n \n \n \n1  No. 14-14-232, 2015 WL 1433834, at *8 (D. Idaho Mar. 27,  2015) (declining  to \n2  consider TRO or preliminary injunction request raising “new arguments” that related \n3  broadly to the mortgage-centered conduct at the heart of complaint, but raised new, \n4  specific allegations).  \n5  The Court should reject the TRO request for the same reasons.  Plaintiffs’ TRO \n6  motion rests on events that occurred after and outside of events giving rise to the \n7  complaint.  The complaint  in  this case  has nothing  to do  with ORR’s response to \n8  infectious disease or COVID-19.  It does not assert that ORR’s response to this crisis is \n9  inappropriate or inadequate under the TVPRA or the Constitution.  And it does not lay \n10  out facts to establish that the response is improper or inadequate.  And because of that, \n11  there was never any assessment of whether this Court could properly define or certify a \n12  class to address such concerns through class remedies.  The complaint makes only \n13  general claims about the treatment and care of children, which cannot properly give rise \n14  to either a certification order or class-wide injunctive relief addressing COVID-19. See \n15  Compl. ¶ 189-90 (“As a matter of policy and practice, Defendants unreasonably and \n16  unnecessarily delay or refuse to release children to [proposed custodians]”).  Similarly, \n17  the class was  certified to address timing-based concerns about release; it was not \n18  certified to address requirements imposed by the TVPRA or the Due Process Clause on \n19  release relating to COVID-19 or concerns related to the spread of infectious diseases.  \n20  See ECF No. 126 at 16-17 (certifying class where “ORR is refusing or will refuse to \n21  release to parents or other available custodians within thirty days of the proposed \n22  custodian’s submitting a complete family reunification packet on the ground that the \n23  proposed custodian is or may be unfit”). \n24  Plaintiffs’ TRO request bears no relationship to the ground for relief in the \n25  complaint or the basis for this Court’s class-certification order.  The complaint and the \n26  certified class challenge purported refusals to release minors  to otherwise suitable \n27  sponsors within thirty days of receipt of a completed Family Reunification Packet, and \n28  the prayer for relief makes no mention of dramatically altering the standard governing \n \n- 18 - \nDefendants’ Opposition to TRO  \n\n \nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230   Filed 03/27/20   Page 23 of 30   Page ID\n #:5480\n \n \n \n1  release under the TVPRA for sponsors due to a global pandemic.  And there is no nexus \n2  to the purported lack of process in sponsor denial adjudication alleged in the complaint \n3  and the TRO’s request for a mass release of hundreds of children to individuals who \n4  have not been properly vetted and have not shown they will be safe sponsors under the \n5  standards of the TVPRA.  The newly alleged relief sought here must be sought, if at all, \n6  in a new complaint, not shoehorned into the existing one by requesting administrative \n7  hearings that are entirely inappropriate in a time of strained agency resources devoted \n8  to combatting the pandemic.  And any class-wide relief would need to be sought based \n9  on such a complaint and only after Plaintiffs establish that they satisfy the rigorous \n10  requirements imposed by Rule 23. \n11  For scope reasons alone, Plaintiffs lack a likelihood of success on the merits. \n12    4.  Plaintiffs Fail to Show a Due-Process Violation \n13  As explained above, due-process claims relating to conditions and release for \n14  minors in ORR care were resolved in Flores, and any claim regarding enforcement of \n15  that Agreement would need to be raised in that matter under the terms set forth in the \n16  Flores Agreement. In any event, ORR’s extensive and comprehensive response to \n17  COVID-19 satisfies the Due Process Clause.  Plaintiffs’ arguments to the contrary, Br. \n18  18-22, lack merit. \n19  Due process requires ORR to provide Plaintiffs with adequate medical care and \n20  safe conditions.  See Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292 (1993).  And due process bars the \n21  government from acting with deliberate indifference to a known or obvious danger. \n22  Patel v. Kent Sch. Dist., 648 F.3d at 971-72 (quoting L.W. v. Grubbs, 92 F.3d 894, 900 \n23  (9th Cir. 1996)).  Deliberate indifference is a high bar and recognizes the discretion of \n24  caregivers to make appropriate treatment decisions—prior cases have explained that it \n25  could be met when a caregiver denies access to medical care, interferes with treatment, \n26  or fails to respond to a child’s medical needs.  Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 971, 104-05 \n27  (1976). \n28 \n \n- 19 - \nDefendants’ Opposition to TRO  \n\n \nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230   Filed 03/27/20   Page 24 of 30   Page ID\n #:5481\n \n \n \n1  ORR has taken extensive measures to address the risks that COVID-19 could \n2  present to the UACs in its case.  ORR has implemented a number of heightened safety \n3  precautions to ensure minors in its custody are not exposed to COVID-19 and that \n4  should those precautions not succeed, minors would receive the proper medical care. \n5  To prevent infection, ORR guidance to its network of care providers requires any UAC \n6  exhibiting symptoms consistent with COVID-19, such as coughing, fever, or difficulty \n7  breathing, at any point during their time in ORR care, to be immediately isolated and \n8  referred for evaluation by a licensed medical provider, in consultation with the local \n9  health authority.  Ex. Q ¶ 22.  Temperature checks are taken twice a day for UACs in \n10  care, with temperatures over 100 degrees requiring elevation to ORR, and visitors may \n11  not enter shelters who exhibit any of the above symptoms.  Ex T.  Further, if a UAC is \n12  recommended for testing by the health care provider or public health department, the \n13  UAC will receive testing.  Ex. Q ¶ 23.  ORR has also initiated telehealth capabilities in \n14  California and New York to ensure care provider facilities are able to provide UAC \n15  with access to medical care without having to leave their facilities. Id. ¶ 34.  And for \n16  the rare cases where a UAC becomes infected with COVID-19, like the four children at \n17  the one NY shelter above, full medical quarantine is available for the other children in \n18  care, and the child is guaranteed to receive appropriate medical treatment. Id. ¶ 35; ORR \n19  Guide § 3.4.6. \n20  Plaintiffs cite no evidence that ORR has acted with deliberate indifference to the \n21  impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on UACs in care.  And the response shows that \n22  ORR has been extremely active and diligent.  ORR provided initial COVID-19 guidance \n23  to the entire UAC care-provider network on March 2, 2020.  Ex. R.  It provided \n24  additional guidance on COVID-19 to the entire UAC care-provider network on March \n25  19, 21, and 23. Ex. R-W.  The mere fact that minors remain in congregate care while \n26  ORR attempts to safely and expeditiously reunify them with a qualified sponsor does \n27  not show that ORR has either failed to provide appropriate medical care required under \n28  the Due Process Clause, or that ORR is deliberately indifferent.  Plaintiffs therefore \n \n- 20 - \nDefendants’ Opposition to TRO  \n\n \nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230   Filed 03/27/20   Page 25 of 30   Page ID\n #:5482\n \n \n \n1  cannot  prevail  in  the  due  process  claims  either  as  alleged  in  the  complaint  or  as \n2  reiterated in the TRO and as applied to medical care and treatment. \n3  Given these points, there is no basis to Plaintiffs’ argument that ORR has failed \n4  to provide reasonable protections from the risks presented by the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n5  Br. 18-19.  Nor is there any merit to Plaintiffs’ claim that ORR is subjecting the UACs \n6  at issue to “conditions that amount to punishment” or that are “excessive.”  Br. 19; see \n7  also Br. 19-20.  As shown by the steady stream of guidance issued by ORR to address \n8  COVID-19 for its population in care, Ex. R-W, ORR’s protocol for combatting the \n9  pandemic is calculated and calibrated to address the risk here—it is not excessive or \n10  unjustifiable as Plaintiffs claim. \n11  Finally, Plaintiffs contend that ORR’s failure to release the UACs at issue more \n12  rapidly violates procedural-due-process requirements for all UACs with an identified \n13  sponsor, even if the sponsor is distantly or unrelated to the child.  See Br. 20-22. But \n14  Congress did not provide these rights under the TVPRA, and the Supreme Court has \n15  already held that such a hearing is not required by the Due Process Clause, when \n16  ”institutional custody (despite the availability of responsible private custodians) is not \n17  unconstitutional in itself.”  See Reno, 507 U.S. at 303.  For the reasons explained above, \n18  supra 18-19, ORR’s medical care for its UAC population during this time of pandemic \n19  fully comports with the Due Process clause, and thus, Plaintiffs’ procedural Due Process \n20  claims similarly fail.   \n5.  Plaintiffs Fail to Show That Their Requested Relief Will Mitigate\n21 \n  Risk of Harm from COVID-19 \n22 \nPlaintiffs’ request for relief is barred for another independent reason:  Plaintiffs’ \n23 \nalleged  injury—that  they are  subject  to  being exposed to COVID-19  due to their \n24 \nplacement in congregate care—will not be redressed by ordering their release on an \n25 \nexpedited basis to potential sponsors who have not yet been vetted. “Redressability \n26 \nrequires an analysis of whether the court has the power to right or to prevent the claimed \n27 \ninjury.”  Gonzales v. Gorsuch, 688 F.2d 1263, 1267 (9th Cir. 1982) (Kennedy, J.). For \n28 \n \n- 21 - \nDefendants’ Opposition to TRO  \n\n \nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230   Filed 03/27/20   Page 26 of 30   Page ID\n #:5483\n \n \n \n1  standing purposes, a plaintiff’s injury  is redressable where there  is “a ‘substantial \n2  likelihood’ that the requested relief will remedy the alleged injury.” Vermont Agency of \n3  Nat’l Res. v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U.S. 765, 771 (2000) (citation omitted).  \n4  Plaintiffs have not carried their burden of showing that their desired relief—expedited \n5  release from ORR custody based on improperly overriding the TVPRA standard—will \n6  likely diminish their risk of exposure to COVID-19.  \n7  Notably, Plaintiffs do not articulate how release into communities or to sponsors \n8  who may already be exposed to COVID-19 will reduce the likelihood that the released \n9  minors will be exposed to or contract COVID-19.  And in contrast to ORR’s careful \n10  procedures for protecting against COVID-19 transmission, Plaintiffs do not explain \n11  how a massive number of expedited releases will safely occur.  They offer no discussion \n12  of how to safely transport children from a facility that does not yet have a single case \n13  of COVID-19 into homes and communities that cannot make the same representation \n14  to justify class-wide relief.  They have not addressed the reality that the situation is \n15  vastly different in different parts of the country, and to the contrary, ORR is taking that \n16  into account in managing its many grantees and placements with grantees.  Ex. Q ¶ 32.  \n17  Indeed,  granting  Plaintiffs’  proposed  TRO  could  even  increase  children’s  risk  of \n18  exposure to COVID-19.  ORR should be permitted to fulfill its statutory mandate of \n19  assessing whether releasing a child would be safe under all the circumstances, and a \n20  blanket order requiring releases on a set timeframe would be the opposite of helping to \n21  mitigate risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. \n22  Moreover, ORR provides medical care at no cost of children in its custody, \n23  including Plaintiffs.  Ex. Q ¶ 45.  By reason of their placement in ORR facilities, \n24  Plaintiffs have greater access to robust medical care than does the general public. See \n25  id.; ORR Guide § 3.4.6.  Aside from the increased risk of placing vulnerable children \n26  with un-vetted sponsors, ordering their release from ORR grantee care providers would \n27  leave these children without their present access to health care and could put Plaintiffs \n28  at greater risk should they contract COVID-19; at a minimum, ORR must be permitted \n \n- 22 - \nDefendants’ Opposition to TRO  \n\n \nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230   Filed 03/27/20   Page 27 of 30   Page ID\n #:5484\n \n \n \n1  to  assess  whether  proposed  sponsors  are  able  to  provide  adequate  medical  care.  \n2  Additionally, transporting unexposed children via airlines to affect unification would \n3  increase their risk of exposure—the very harm Plaintiffs fear.  \n4  B. Considerations of Harm and the Equities Cut Against a TRO \n5  Plaintiffs’ TRO request fails on the remaining injunctive factors as well. \n6  Plaintiffs fail to establish irreparable injury.  An injunction is “unavailable absent \n7  a showing of irreparable injury, a requirement that cannot be met where there is no \n8  showing  of  any  real  or  immediate  threat  that  the  plaintiff  will  be  wronged  []—a \n9  ‘likelihood of substantial and immediate irreparable injury.”  Los Angeles v. Lyons, 41 \n10  U.S.  95,  111  (1983).    Plaintiffs  contend  that  detaining  the  children  at  issue  “in \n11  congregate facilities that are inherently unsafe in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic \n12  rather  than  releasing  them  to  available  custodians  violates  both  substantive  and \n13  procedural due process.”  Br. 18.  But Plaintiffs’ view fails to account for the measures \n14  that ORR has put into place (and will continue to put into place) to protect the children \n15  committed to its care.  As discussed above, ORR has deployed extensive resources and \n16  efforts to address the harms that Plaintiffs claim.  Given these measures in particular, \n17  Plaintiffs have not established that residing at an ORR grantee care provider facility \n18  increases risk to UACs of exposure to COVID-19 or presents a sufficient likelihood of \n19  irreparable harm.  Moreover, many ORR grantee care provider facilities are currently \n20  far below capacity, which better enables social distancing.  Ex. Q, ¶ 13-14.  Notably, \n21  States continue to consider congregate care facilities essential.2  Plaintiffs have not \n22  shown that Defendants are unprepared to respond to COVID-19 infections in specific \n23  grantee care facilities, let alone that they are unprepared to do so on a nationwide basis. \n24  Indeed, as shown above, ORR has robust procedures in place to protect children from \n25  the disease and provide any needed medical treatment.  Further, the CDC indicates that \n26  “children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults; . . . adults make \n                                            \n27 \n2  See,  e.g.,  https://www.gnyha.org/news/executive-order-identifies-essential-health-\n28 \ncare-operations/ \n \n- 23 - \nDefendants’ Opposition to TRO  \n\n \nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230   Filed 03/27/20   Page 28 of 30   Page ID\n #:5485\n \n \n \n1  up most of the known cases to date.”3  Plaintiffs are not entitled to immediate release to \n2  un-vetted applicant sponsors or to a transfer in facilities based on a conjectural injury \n3  that defies the known facts.  As to the equities, the public interest favors not disturbing \n4  ORR’s  careful  and  adaptable  response  to  this  situation,  especially  where  release \n5  threatens the public interest and increases health risks to the very children who Plaintiffs \n6  purport to help.   \n7  Finally, Plaintiffs have not satisfied the standard for a mandatory injunction.  \n8  “Where a party seeks mandatory preliminary relief that goes well beyond maintaining \n9  the  status  quo  pendent  lite,  courts  should  be  extremely  cautious  about  issuing  a \n10  preliminary injunction.”  Martin v. Int’l Olympic Comm., 740 F.2d 670, 675 (9th Cir. \n11  1984); see also Committee of Cent. Am. Refugee v. INS, 795 F.2d 1434, 1442 (9th Cir. \n12  1986).  For mandatory preliminary relief to be granted, the plaintiff “must establish that \n13  the law and facts clearly favor [the plaintiff’s] position.”  Garcia v. Google, Inc., 786 \n14  F.3d 733, 740 (9th Cir. 2015) (emphasis in original).  That is, the showing necessary to \n15  obtain an injunction that alters the status quo is higher than the showing necessary to \n16  merely preserve the status quo.  See, e.g., id.  Plaintiffs fall far short of making the \n17  necessary showing—their TRO motion is beyond the scope of the facts alleged in the \n18  complaint, it is unripe, it is not based on a class certified for the claims that Plaintiffs \n19  now make,  it fails to show a likelihood of success on the merits, it fails to show \n20  irreparable injury, and it fails to show that the balance of the public interest factors \n21  favors them.  Plaintiffs have failed to show that the facts and law “clearly favor” their \n22  position, so as to justify a mandatory injunction. \n23  IV.  CONCLUSION \n24  In consultation with a host of federal, state, and local public health authorities, \n25  ORR is working day and night to reduce the risk to UACs posed by COVID-19, while \n26  complying with ORR’s statutory mandate to release these children to safe sponsors as \n27 \n                                            \n28 \n3 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html \n \n- 24 - \nDefendants’ Opposition to TRO  \n\n \nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230   Filed 03/27/20   Page 29 of 30   Page ID\n #:5486\n \n \n \n1  soon as it is safe to do so.

I am the Deputy Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”), an Office within \nthe Administration for Children and Families (“ACF”), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \n15 \n(“HHS”).  \n16 \n2.  I have held the position of Deputy Director since June 2018.  I was previously the Director \n17 \nof Children’s Services from September 2013 through June 2018.  I have worked at ORR since February \n18 \n2007.  I have a Master’s of Arts in Clinical Psychology.  Before joining ORR, I worked as a mental health \n19  professional and managed the child welfare and social services programs for Hawaii’s largest non-profit \n20  organization. \n21  3.  As  the  Deputy  Director  of  ORR,  I  have  responsibility  for  the  oversight  of  the \nUnaccompanied Alien Children (“UAC”) program, including all aspects of operations, planning and \n22 \nlogistics, medical services, and monitoring.  My job duties include the formulation and implementation of \n23 \nORR’s response to COVID-19 across its network of grantee care-provider facilities. \n24 \n4.  My testimony in this declaration is based upon my personal knowledge of ORR’s response \n25  to COVID-19, information obtained from records and systems maintained by ORR in the regular course of \n26  performing my job duties, and CDC guidance documents regarding COVID-19, which I obtained from the \nCDC’s official website and reviewed in connection with the performance of my duties.   \n27 \n5.  I am testifying in this declaration to the best of my knowledge, and understand that this \n28 \ndeclaration is for use in the Lucas R. case. \n \n1 \n30   \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230-1   Filed 03/27/20   Page 3 of 15   Page ID\n #:5490\n \n1  Background  \n6.  ORR is the agency charged with the care and custody of UAC pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c) \n2 \nand other provisions.  As such, ORR is committed to providing for the safety and well-being of all UAC \n3 \nin its care, as well as protecting the health and safety of the communities in which these children live—\n4 \nincluding from the risk of COVID-19. \n5 \n7.  To carry out its mission, ORR relies on a network of grantee care-provider facilities located \n6  across the country.  There are a total of 107 facilities in the ORR grantee care-provider network that house \n7  UAC in a congregate setting: 98 shelters, 6 staff secure facilities, 1 secure facility, and 2 residential \ntreatment centers (“RTCs”).  \n8 \n8.  Although  each  care-provider  facility  is  unique  in  terms  of  its  physical  layout  and \n9 \ncapabilities, the ORR Guide generally defines a shelter as “a residential care provider facility in which all \n10 \nof the programmatic components are administered on-site, in the least restrictive environment.”1 \n11 \n9.   A staff secure facility is generally defined as “a facility that maintains stricter security \n12 \nmeasures, such as higher staff to unaccompanied alien children ratio for supervision, than a shelter in order \n13  to control disruptive behavior and to prevent escape.  A staff secure facility is for unaccompanied alien \n14  children who may require close supervision but do not need placement in a secure facility.  Service \nprovision is tailored to address an unaccompanied alien child’s individual needs and to manage the \n15 \nbehaviors that necessitated the child’s placement into this more restrictive setting.  The staff secure \n16 \natmosphere reflects a more shelter, home-like setting rather than secure detention.  Unlike many secure \n17 \ncare providers, a staff secure care provider is not equipped internally with multiple locked pods or cell \n18  units.”2 \n19  10.  A secure facility is generally defined as “a facility with a physically secure structure and \n20  staff able to control violent behavior.  ORR uses a secure facility as the most restrictive placement option \nfor an unaccompanied alien child who poses a danger to self or others or has been charged with having \n21 \ncommitted a criminal offense.  A secure facility may be a licensed detention center or a highly structured \n22 \ntherapeutic facility.”3 \n23 \n11.  An RTC is generally defined as “a sub-acute, time limited, interdisciplinary, psycho-\n24 \neducational, and therapeutic 24-hour-a-day structured program with community linkages, provided through \n25 \n                                                 \n26  1 ORR, Children Entering the United States Unaccompanied:  Guide to Terms (Mar. 21, 2016), “Shelter care,” available at \nhttps://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/resource/children-entering-the-united-states-unaccompanied-guide-to-terms#Shelter Care. \n27  2 Id., “Staff secure care,” available at https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/resource/children-entering-the-united-states-\nunaccompanied-guide-to-terms#Staff Secure Care. \n28 \n3 Id., “Secure care,” available at https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/resource/children-entering-the-united-states-unaccompanied-\nguide-to-terms#Secure Care. \n \n2 \n30   \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230-1   Filed 03/27/20   Page 4 of 15   Page ID\n #:5491\n \n1  non-coercive,  coordinated,  individualized  care,  specialized  services  and  interventions.    Residential \ntreatment centers provide highly customized care and services to individuals following either a community \n2 \nbased placement or more intensive intervention, with the aim of moving individuals toward a stable, less \n3 \nintensive level of care or independence.  ORR uses a RTC at the recommendation of a psychiatrist or \n4 \npsychologist or with ORR Treatment Authorization Request (TAR) approval for an unaccompanied alien \n5 \nchild who poses a danger to self or others and does not require inpatient hospitalization.”4   \n6  12.  As of March 25, 2020, there are a total of 3,374 UAC in ORR care.  This includes 439 UAC \n7  in long-term foster care and 374 UAC in transitional foster care, which are not congregate settings.  For \ncongregate settings only, there are 2,505 UAC in shelter facilities, 28 in staff secure facilities, 12 in secure \n8 \nfacilities, and 16 in RTCs. \n9 \n13.  Currently, ORR’s care-provider facilities are operating significantly below their maximum \n10 \ncapacity and historical highs. For example, at this time last year (March of 2019), ORR was receiving \n11 \napproximately 8,000 monthly referrals and had almost 12,000 minors in care with an 87% occupancy rate \n12 \n(including influx and variance beds).  In contrast, February referrals from 2020 were approximately 2,000 \n13  per month with approximately 3,600 minors in care, and a 28% occupancy rate (including influx and \n14  variance beds). As a result, ORR currently has additional capacity and more opportunity to ensure social \ndistancing and isolation within the care provider network.  \n15 \n14.  In addition, CDC recently issued an order under Public Health authorities suspending \n16 \nintroduction of certain persons into the United States.5  As a result, for the near-term, ORR is likely to have \n17 \nsufficient capacity to continue to implement necessary social distancing and/or isolation. \n18 \nORR Infection Control Measures in Care Provider Facilities \n19  15.  ORR has significant historical experience with the identification, mitigation, and treatment \n20  of contagious diseases affecting UAC, including seasonal influenza (flu), mumps (parotitis), chicken pox \n(varicella), and tuberculosis.  Accordingly, ORR has policies pertaining to infectious disease control that \n21 \npredate the COVID-19 pandemic. \n22 \n16.  ORR’s  general,  long-standing  policies  concerning  the  management  of  communicable \n23 \ndisease require the routine assessment of travel history when a child arrives at a care-provider program; \n24 \nmedical screenings and vaccinations within 48 hours of arriving at ORR shelters; ability to isolate or \n25 \n26                                                   \n4 Id., “Residential Treatment Center (RTC),” available at https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/resource/children-entering-the-united-\nstates-unaccompanied-guide-to-terms#Residential Treatment Center. \n27 \n5 CDC Order Under Sections 362 and 365 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 265, 268), available at \n28  https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/order-suspending-introduction-certain-persons.html. \n \n3 \n30   \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230-1   Filed 03/27/20   Page 5 of 15   Page ID\n #:5492\n \n1  quarantine individuals for the purpose of infectious disease control; hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette \neducation efforts; and established communicable disease reporting to the local health authority.6   \n2 \n17.  Since the first reports of COVID-19 in the U.S., ORR has monitored the public health \n3 \nreporting on COVID-19 in the jurisdictions in which grantee care-provider facilities operate.   ORR has \n4 \nprovided regular updates to grantee care-provider facilities on infection prevention and control, and issued \n5 \nguidance regarding the screening and management of UAC, facility personnel, and visitors who have \n6  potentially been exposed to COVID-19.  All of these measures are rooted in CDC guidance.7 \n7  18.  To prevent those who may have been exposed to, or who may be infected with COVID-19 \nfrom entering ORR facilities, ORR has mandated that all visitors and staff seeking to enter any grantee \n8 \ncare-provider facility answer COVID-19 screening questions and submit to a mandatory temperature \n9 \ncheck.  With the exception of UAC who are being processed for admission, grantee care-provider facilities \n10 \nare required to deny access to anyone with a fever of 100℉ or above; or who exhibits signs of symptoms \n11 \nof an acute respiratory infection, such as a cough or shortness of breath; or who has had contact with \n12 \nsomeone with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 in the previous 14 days; or who has been tested for \n13  COVID-19 and is awaiting test results; or who, in the previous 14 days, has traveled to a country identified \n14  by the CDC as having widespread, sustained community transmission of COVID-19. \n19.  In addition, UAC entering ORR care are screened for COVID-19 exposure or symptoms \n15 \nduring their initial medical examination (“IME”), which has been expanded to include a COVID-19 health \n16 \nscreening protocol consistent with CDC COVID-19 guidelines. \n17 \n20.  UAC at risk of COVID-19 exposure based on reported travel history, but without symptoms, \n18 \nare quarantined and monitored for 14 days.  UAC who exhibit COVID-19 symptoms during their IME are \n19  isolated and tested in consultation with the local health authority.   \n20  21.  ORR has also instituted a rigorous symptom-monitoring regime to ensure that any UAC in \nany facility who begins exhibiting potential symptoms of COVID-19 after their IME is immediately \n21 \nidentified and appropriately isolated in consultation with the local health authority. \n22 \n22.  Since March 19, 2020, ORR has required each grantee care-provider facility to monitor the \n23 \ntemperature of every UAC in care.  UACs’ temperatures are taken twice daily, once in the morning and \n24 \nagain in the evening, and are recorded in a master census temperature report that each facility is required \n25  to maintain.  If any UAC is found to have a temperature above 100℉, the grantee care-provider is required \n26 \n                                                 \n6 See ORR Policy Guide § 3.4.6 Management of Communicable Diseases, § 3.4.7 Maintaining Health Care Records and \n27  Confidentiality, https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/resource/children-entering-the-united-states-unaccompanied-section-3. \n7 CDC, Interim US Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Persons with Potential Coronavirus \n28 \nDisease 2019 (COVID-19) Exposures: Geographic Risk and Contacts of Laboratory-confirmed Cases, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/risk-assessment.html. \n \n4 \n30   \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230-1   Filed 03/27/20   Page 6 of 15   Page ID\n #:5493\n \n1  to immediately alert ORR.  The grantee care-provider is required to alert ORR each day that any child has \na temperature over 100℉.  So for example, if a UAC has a 101℉ fever for three days, ORR will be alerted \n2 \nof this fact every day for the duration of the child’s fever.  Early identification of potential COVID-19 cases \n3 \nallows for early introduction of appropriate public health measures.   \n4 \n23.  Any UAC exhibiting symptoms consistent with COVID-19, such as coughing, fever, or \n5 \ndifficulty breathing, at any point during their time in ORR care are to be immediately isolated and referred \n6  for evaluation by a licensed medical provider, in consultation with the local health authority.  If a UAC is \n7  recommended for testing by the healthcare provider or public health department, the UAC will receive \ntesting. \n8 \n24.  The same isolation procedures are used for any UAC determined to be at risk for COVID-\n9 \n19 exposure or infection, whether based on information collected during the IME, or through subsequent \n10 \nmonitoring.  The affected UAC will be provided with a private room, with a closed door and bathroom \n11 \naccess, preferably a private bathroom that is not used by other staff or UAC.  State and local health \n12 \ndepartments,  along  with  ORR’s  Division  of  Health  for  Unaccompanied  Children  (“DHUC”)  are \n13  immediately notified and consulted for additional guidance on risk assessment, symptom monitoring, and \n14  isolation or quarantine. \n25.  Facility personnel who enter an occupied isolation room are required to wear personal \n15 \nprotective equipment, including an N95 respirator and goggles or a face shield, per CDC guidelines. \n16 \n26.  If a UAC in isolation needs to leave the isolation room for any reason (e.g., to attend a \n17 \nmedical appointment, etc.), the UAC must wear a surgical mask for the duration of their time outside the \n18 \nisolation room. \n19  27.  If a UAC must be transported to a health clinic or other off-site location, the facility must \n20  notify the local health department for guidance on proper precautions during transport.  The facility is also \nrequired to alert the intended destination so that proper infection control measures may be implemented \n21 \nprior to the UAC’s arrival. \n22 \n28.  UAC are required to remain in isolation until cleared by the local health department or \n23 \nDHUC.  During this time in isolation, UAC receive the same services as their non-isolated peers in the \n24 \nsame facility, although services—particularly education services—may be adjusted to accommodate \n25  proper infection-control procedures. \n26  29.  Any room, object, or vehicle used by a UAC in isolation is thoroughly sanitized afterwards.8 \n27 \n                                                 \n28 \n8 See CDC, Disinfecting Your Facility if Someone is Sick, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/disinfecting-\nbuilding-facility.html. \n \n5 \n30   \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230-1   Filed 03/27/20   Page 7 of 15   Page ID\n #:5494\n \n1  30.  To assess whether each grantee care-provider facility has appropriate stores of personal \nprotective equipment (“PPE”) to safely respond in the event COVID-19 is detected within their facility, on \n2 \nMarch 13, 2020, ORR inventoried all care providers for their current levels of PPE (e.g., surgical masks \n3 \nand gowns, face shields, N95 respirators) and cleaning/disinfecting supplies, as well as the number of staff \n4 \nwho  are  involved  in  cleaning  and  maintenance  activities.    Any  facility  that  encounters  difficulty \n5 \nmaintaining adequate levels of COVID-19 related supplies may request additional stores from FEMA, and \n6  ORR may assist in facilitating any such requests. \n7  31.  Program staff will provide an affected UAC with notice of the isolation requirement and \naddress questions or concerns the child may have about medical isolation, as well as potential delays to \n8 \nanticipated transfers or discharge plans.  In order to protect the health of UAC and the local community, \n9 \nUAC cannot be transferred either to another facility or released to a sponsor until cleared by local health \n10 \nauthorities and DHUC. \n11 \nORR Suspensions of Placements and Releases \n12 \n32.  Beginning on March 9, 2020, ORR stopped placements of UAC on a rolling basis in the \n13  states of California, New York, and Washington due to the ongoing outbreaks of COVID-19 among the \n14  general public in those states.  ORR is continually monitoring the jurisdictions in which its grantee care-\nprovider facilities operate to determine whether the conditions in the community surrounding the facility \n15 \nwarrant the suspension of placements due to concerns related to COVID-19. \n16 \n33.  In addition, ORR is prioritizing local placements for all new referrals from DHS in order to \n17 \nlimit the need for UAC to travel on commercial airliners, which poses a risk of exposing passengers \n18 \n(including UAC) to COVID-19.  Care providers may still use air travel to reunify a UAC with their sponsor \n19  if it is safe to do so.  However, care providers are required to assess the safety of the UAC’s ultimate \n20  destination, in order to anticipate logistical issues associated with COVID-19 disruptions.  Care-provider \nfacilities are required to consult with their Federal Field Specialist (“FFS”), or delegee, if a UAC will be \n21 \ntraveling to a jurisdiction with widespread community transmission of COVID-19 or that is subject to a \n22 \ncommunity-wide “lock down,” such as California.  In such cases, release should be postponed until it is \n23 \ndetermined to be safe for the UAC to travel to their destination.  This safety assessment includes \n24 \nconsideration of the particular UAC’s unique medical needs and vulnerabilities, and the UAC’s respective \n25  medical specialists are consulted in the safety planning process. \n26  34.  Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, ORR was working on a telehealth initiative to increase \nUAC’s access to healthcare resources that may not be physically present in their locality.  In light of the \n27 \nstate orders restricting the movement of people generally in California, New York, and elsewhere, ORR \n28 \nhas rolled out its telehealth capabilities ahead of schedule in numerous jurisdictions in order to ensure care-\n \n6 \n30   \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230-1   Filed 03/27/20   Page 8 of 15   Page ID\n #:5495\n \n1  provider facilities are able to provide UAC with access to medical care without having to leave their \nfacilities.  Those jurisdictions are:  California, New York, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New \n2 \nJersey, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia.  Further, ORR is awaiting final approval from telehealth \n3 \nproviders in Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Washington, and Oregon, and anticipates the service will \n4 \nbe available in these locations in the near future. \n5 \nCOVID-19 Cases in ORR Grantee Care Provider Facilities \n6  35.  As of March 26, 2020, there have been four confirmed COVID-19 cases among UAC across \n7  all ORR care-provider facilities.  All four cases were in a single facility in New York state, and the affected \nUAC are currently in isolation, per ORR and CDC guidelines, and are receiving appropriate monitoring \n8 \nand medical care. \n9 \n36.  Currently, 18 UAC in the care-provider network have been tested.  As noted, four tested \n10 \npositive for COVID-19, 11 tested negative for COVID-19, and three have test results pending.   \n11 \n37.  Pursuant to CDC Guidance, any UAC who has undergone COVID-19 testing is considered \n12 \npresumptively positive until results are available (typically within 3-4 after testing) and are placed in \n13  isolation as a precautionary measure. \n14  38.  In addition, a total of eight program staff, contractors or foster parents at five care-provider \nprograms across New York, Washington, and Texas have self-reported testing positive for COVID-19. \n15 \nORR’s medical team and the affected programs have worked in close coordination with the local public \n16 \nhealth departments on appropriate public health measures, which typically involve self-quarantine at home, \n17 \nand the tracking and monitoring of the affected staff members’ contacts within the care-provider facility, \n18  per CDC guidance.9   \n19  39.  In addition to the COVID-19 protocols described above, care-provider facilities are directed \n20  to follow any local requirements issued by the state licensing agency or other local public health authority \nrelated to the identification, reporting, and control of communicable diseases that are more stringent than \n21 \nORR’s protocols. \n22 \nAssessment of Plaintiffs’ Assertions \n23 \n40.  In their March 22, 2020 correspondence, Plaintiffs stated that they “are advised that \n24 \ncongregate care is inherently incongruent with the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control \n25  and Prevention, state health authorities, and epidemiologists, all of whom recommend (if not mandate) \n26  social distancing and related safety precautions that are difficult, if not impossible, to observe in facilities \n27 \n                                                 \n9 CDC, Interim US Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Persons with Potential Coronavirus \n28 \nDisease 2019 (COVID-19) Exposures:  Geographic Risk and Contacts of Laboratory-confirmed Cases, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/risk-assessment.html. \n \n7 \n30   \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230-1   Filed 03/27/20   Page 9 of 15   Page ID\n #:5496\n \n1  housing more than ten Class Members.”  See Ltr. from C. Holguin (Ctr. for Human Rights & Const. Law), \nto D. Shieh (DOJ), dated Mar. 22, 2020, at 2 (emphasis added), attached hereto as “Exhibit A.” \n2 \n41.  CDC, however, has issued guidance on COVID-19 containment in various congregate \n3 \nsettings, including colleges,10 nursing homes,11 prisons,12 and homeless shelters.13  ORR has implemented \n4 \nsuch guidance to the extent that it can be applied to its grantee care-provider facilities.  Further, ORR has \n5 \nconsulted with CDC regarding ORR’s COVID-19 containment and mitigation strategies and has been told \n6  by CDC that they are consistent with CDC’s recommendations. \n7  42.  I have serious concerns about the proposals in Plaintiffs’ March 22 correspondence that call \nfor the expedited release of UAC to potential sponsors.  In particular, the immediate, blanket release of \n8 \nUAC to sponsors located in jurisdictions with widespread community transmission of COVID-19 would \n9 \npose a risk to the health and welfare of the UAC.  UAC are currently housed in settings where infection \n10 \ncontrol protocols are rigorously enforced.  In contrast, upon release, UAC may be exposed to COVID-19 \n11 \nin airports or transit systems, or through sponsors who have been exposed to COVID-19, or through \n12 \ncirculation in communities with widespread community transmission of COVID-19. \n13  43.  Many sponsors are also located in states that are currently under “lock down” in which \n14  residents’ freedom of movement has been significantly curtailed in an effort to control the spread of \nCOVID-19, such as California, Washington, and New York.  If anything, the current ORR approach is \n15 \nconsistent with those “lock down” orders in that UAC are shielded from UAC community transmission. \n16 \n44.  ORR’s efforts to safely release UAC to safe, approved sponsors remain ongoing.  But \n17 \nPlaintiffs’ proposal to release UAC to sponsors who are still undergoing vetting would materially increase \n18 \nthe risk of release to a sponsor who potentially cannot or will not shelter in place with the UAC, or who \n19  may not adhere to appropriate infection control practices (e.g., social distancing), or who may circulate \n20  with the UAC in areas with widespread community transmission of COVID-19, all of which increase the \nhealth risks to the UAC.  Plaintiffs’ proposal would also increase the risk of release to a sponsor who, \n21 \nbecause vetting has not yet completed, is, or will become unable to financially support the UAC due to \n22 \nCOVID-19-related business closures, layoffs, or furloughs. \n23 \n                                                 \n24  10 CDC, Interim Guidance for Administrators of U.S. Higher Education, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-\nncov/community/guidance-ihe-response.html. \n25 \n11 CDC, Preventing the Spread of COVID-19 in Retirement Communities and Independent Living Facilities (Interim \nGuidance), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/retirement/guidance-retirement-response.html. \n26 \n12 CDC, Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities, \n27  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html. \n13 CDC, Interim Guidance for Homeless Service Providers to Plan and Response to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), \n28  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/homeless-shelters/plan-prepare-respond.html. \n \n8 \n30   \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230-1   Filed 03/27/20   Page 10 of 15   Page ID\n #:5497\n \n1  45.  The immediate, blanket release of UAC to sponsors who are still undergoing vetting would \nalso deprive these UAC of access to the significant medical resources of ORR (including testing for \n2 \nCOVID-19).  Once they leave ORR’s care they are limited by the resources of their sponsor’s household \n3 \nand local community, at a time when important medical resources may be in short supply.14 \n4 \n46.  Plaintiffs propose that ORR can expedite the release of UAC to potential sponsors on \n5 \nPlaintiffs’ terms while adequately vetting the sponsors for the new child welfare and public health concerns \n6  that have arisen in recent months and are continuing to evolve.  Plaintiffs, however, do not identify the \n7  safeguards that ORR can jettison from the sponsor vetting process without putting UAC at risk. \n8  47.  Plaintiffs also overlook the fact that fingerprinting remains a key component for many \nsponsors in the sponsor vetting process, particularly sponsors who are not parents or close relatives. Such \n9 \nfingerprinting has been affected by the recent closures of some digital fingerprinting sites due to COVID-\n10 \n19.   \n11 \n48.  Thirty-nine digital fingerprinting sites in 21 states15 have, as of March 24, 2020, either \n12 \nclosed, curtailed their hours of operation, or switched to an “appointment only” system in response the \n13  public health threat posed by COVID-19.  Fingerprinting is a key component of the background check \n14  process that is needed to fulfill the requirements of the TVPRA and ensure UAC are not released into the \ncustody of sponsors with disqualifying criminal histories, such as convicted human traffickers and \n15 \npedophiles.  Potential sponsors for whom ORR requires fingerprints (including those who are not Category \n16 \n1 or 2A sponsors)16 must be able to undergo fingerprinting in order for background checks to be performed.   \n17 \n49.  To compensate for the reduced availability of digital fingerprinting, ORR’s has directed \n18 \ncare providers to automatically mail fingerprint cards to all individuals identified in family reunification \n19  applications, so that given limited hours at digital fingerprint locations, potential sponsors are aware of the \n20  ability to have fingerprints taken on fingerprint cards, including at a local law enforcement agency.  While \nfingerprint cards are often used, this alternative to digital fingerprinting could take longer for potential \n21 \nsponsors to execute given the additional steps involved, and the reliance on the mail system to transmit the \n22 \ncards.  \n23 \n24 \n                                                 \n25  14 ORR is aware of one instance in which 3 UAC who were recommended for COVID-19 testing were unable to immediately \nobtain a COVID-19 test due to the particular community’s system for allocating tests among primary care providers.  DHUC \n26  is monitoring this situation and will intervene as necessary to assure the UAC have prompt access to COVID-19 testing. \n15 Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Missouri, North \n27  Carolina, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Washington.   \n16 ORR Policy Guide § 2.2.1, https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/resource/children-entering-the-united-states-unaccompanied-\n28 \nsection-2#2.2.1 (defining Category 2A sponsors; Category 1 sponsors are parents or legal guardians; Category 1 and 2A \nsponsors generally do not require fingerprinting, unless there is a special concern). \n \n9 \n30   \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230-1   Filed 03/27/20   Page 11 of 15   Page ID\n #:5498\n \n1  50.  My opinion is that ORR cannot safely release UAC to sponsors absent vetting that includes \nthe completion of fingerprint-based background checks where required, or other protective measures, such \n2 \nas home studies, which are required in certain instances by the TVPRA.  This is especially true during the \n3 \ncurrent public health emergency. The jettisoning of core safeguards in the sponsor vetting process in order \n4 \nto effectuate the immediate release of UAC would expose UAC to not only public health dangers but also \n5 \nmaterial child welfare and safety risks.   \n6  51.  Plaintiffs also request a full adversarial hearing in order for UAC to challenge failures to \n7  (yet) release to individuals applying to be sponsors (including individuals still undergoing vetting).  In my \nopinion, the creation and operation of such an adversarial hearing process during the current public health \n8 \nemergency would require ORR to redeploy federal and grantee staff from program operations, and \n9 \nmaterially degrade the ability of ORR to conduct sponsor vetting and work with grantee care-provider \n10 \nfacilities to maintain appropriate infection control measures and protect the health and safety of UAC at \n11 \nthe facilities.  My opinion is that to maximize child welfare during the current public health emergency, \n12 \nthe federal and grantee staff need to focus on program operations with the goal of releasing UAC to \n13  sponsors only when it is safe to do so. \n14   \nExecuted on March 27, 2020. \n15 \n \n16 \n \n17  _______________________________________ \n18  Jallyn Sualog \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n10 \n30   \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230-1   Filed 03/27/20   Page 12 of 15   Page ID\n #:5499\nExhibit Q\n, \nAttachment A\nMarch 22, 2020 Letter from Plaintiffs' Counsel\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230-1   Filed 03/27/20   Page 13 of 15   Page ID\n #:5500\nC H R C L\nENTER FOR  UMAN  IGHTS AND  ONSTITUTIONAL  AW\n256 S.

Azar et al, 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA. \nDear Counsel: \nPlaintiffs request that the parties meet and confer tomorrow, March 23, 2020, to explore ways in \nwhich the parties may cooperatively address the grave risk that Class Members1 in the above-\nreferenced action are now facing, or will shortly face, in ORR congregate care facilities as a \nresult of the COVID-19 pandemic and public health national emergency. Absent a cooperative \nagreement, Plaintiffs will need to file a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) immediately \nseeking relief from the Court, as described below. \nPlaintiffs are advised that congregate care is inherently incongruent with the recommendations of \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, state health authorities, and epidemiologists, all \nof whom recommend (if not mandate) social distancing and related safety precautions that are \ndifficult, if not impossible, to observe in facilities housing more than ten Class Members.  \nWe accordingly wish to discuss expediting the release of Class Members to available custodians. \nWe, of course, appreciate the need to protect children against abuse or neglect following release, \nbut believe that such risks need to be balanced against the substantial and immediate dangers that \nchildren would face as COVID-19 spreads through congregate care facilities. See TVPRA, 8 \nU.S.C. § 1232(c)(2)(A) (requiring ORR “promptly” place detained children “in the least \nrestrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child” (emphasis added)).  \nWe are already aware that Class Members have been exposed to COVID-19 at the MercyFirst \nand Abbott House programs in New York. We have also been informed that ORR has stopped \n1 Class Members include all youth within any of the five classes the Court certified in its order of \nNovember 2, 2018 (ECF No. 126), as modified by order entered December 27, 2018 (ECF No. \n141). \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230-1   Filed 03/27/20   Page 14 of 15   Page ID\n #:5501\nDaniel Shieh \nBenjamin Mark Moss \nMarina C.

See TVPRA, 8 U.S.C. § \n1232(c)(2)(A). During this rapidly expanding and unprecedented public health crisis, Class \nMembers’ health and welfare must be paramount, as mandated by the TVPRA and state, local, \nand national authorities, among others.  \nWe accordingly propose that the parties discuss the following: \n1) The steps ORR has taken and is taking to ensure the safety of Class Members in light of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\n2) Whether, with respect to all members of the “unfit custodian class,” as defined in the Court’s\norder of December 27, 2018 (ECF No. 141) (“Unfit Custodian Class Members”), absent good\ncause based on articulable facts to believe that available custodian(s) would harm or neglect a\nclass member, or that an individual class member presents a current danger to the public, ORR\nwould be amenable to expediting release of all Unfit Custodian Class Members to available\ncustodians who have been vetted and meet the safety threshold noted above, or else place such\nUnfit Custodian Class Members in non-congregate care.\n3) Whether, with respect to Unfit Custodian Class Members whom it fails to release or place in\nnon-congregate care, ORR would be amenable to amending Policy Guide § 2.7.8, available at\nwww.acf.hhs.gov/orr/resource/children-entering-the-united-states-unaccompanied-section-2#2.7\n(last visited March 22, 2020), effective immediately, to provide as follows:\na.

This is a rapidly evolving situation, and updated guidance may be \nreleased in the future, as necessary.  \n \nFurther guidance on UAC Portal documentation requirements regarding COVID-19 will be distributed in \nthe near future.  \n \nPlease carefully review the information below, and email DCSMedical@acf.hhs.gov with any questions.  \n \nCDC Situation Summary \n \nSee: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/summary.html \n \nAn outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel (new) coronavirus was first detected in Wuhan City, \nHubei Province, China. Tens of thousands of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases have been \nreported in China, with the virus reportedly spreading from person-to-person in parts of the country. \nCases of COVID-19, are also being reported in other countries, including the United States. On January \n30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a public health emergency of \ninternational concern.  \n \nPlease refer to the CDC website for up-to-date information on COVID-19, including what is currently \nknown about transmission, symptoms, and prevention efforts.  \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/index.html \n \nSymptoms of COVID-19 \nReported illnesses have ranged from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2–14 days \nafter exposure and can include: \n•  Fever \n•  Cough \n•  Shortness of breath \n \nORR’s Division of Health for Unaccompanied Children (DHUC) Response \n•  DHUC is closely monitoring COVID-19 information and CDC-issued guidance.  \n•  DHUC, in collaboration with the Department of Homeland Security/Customs and Border \nProtection (DHS/CBP) and the ORR Intakes Team, are monitoring when an unaccompanied alien \nchild from a high-risk location as designated by CDC (see list below) is initially referred to ORR \ncare.  Subsequently, DHUC will notify and provide guidance to ORR care providers of those \nchildren referred for care and custody.

Ideally, this room will be linked to a private bathroom. \n•  All ORR care providers must educate staff and children on hand-hygiene and respiratory \netiquette.  \n•  All ORR care providers must routinely have children with respiratory disease (e.g., influenza) wear \na mask when not in an isolation room, such as when visiting a healthcare facility. \n•  All ORR care providers have a designated way to report potentially reportable diseases to their \nstate or local health department. This same reporting structure is used for COVID-19.  \n \nCOVID-19 Specific Guidance to ORR Care Providers \n \n1. Identification of Risk \n•  Review jurisdiction-specific COVID-19 guidance from your state or local health department. \n•  Any child found to be at possible risk for COVID-19 based on travel history or contact with a \nknown case must be flagged to DHUC via email within 4 hours to: DCSMedical@acf.hhs.gov.  \n•  Information on the child’s location of origin and travel history. The following UAC Portal data \nfields are used to help determine the child’s epidemiologic risk:  \n  Initial Intakes Assessment: 1) date of departure from home country; 2) date of arrival in \no\nthe U.S.  \n  UAC Assessment: 1) Additional UAC Info Tab - City of Origin, Neighborhood of Origin (be \no\nas specific as the child can provide); 2) Journey and Apprehension Tab- When did you \nleave your home country (month, day, year)? How long did the trip take? How did you \nget to the U.S.? Who did you travel with? \n  ORR/DHUC should be notified if any child is discovered to have been in one of the \no\nfollowing countries in the 14 days prior to entering the United States: \n  China \n  Iran \n  Italy \n  Japan \n  South Korea \n  A current list can be found at this link under, “Affected Geographic Areas with \nWidespread or Sustained Community Transmission”: \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html \n \n2. Response \n•  If a child is found to be at risk for COVID-19 exposure and does NOT have symptoms of \nrespiratory disease: \n  The child must be placed into a private room with a closed door and access to a \no\nbathroom (preferably a private bathroom not used by other staff or children). \n  Notify the state or local health department immediately for additional guidance on risk \no\nassessment, symptom monitoring, and quarantine. \n  Notify DHUC immediately via an email to DCSMedical@acf.hhs.gov for additional \no\nguidance on risk assessment, symptom monitoring, and quarantine. \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230-2   Filed 03/27/20   Page 4 of 4   Page ID\n #:5506\n  Quarantine must be maintained until the child is cleared by the health department and \no\nDHUC. \n  The child CANNOT be transferred or discharged until cleared by the health department \no\nand DHUC. \n  Program staff will provide the child notice of the quarantine requirement and address \no\nquestions or concerns the child may have about medical isolation, as well as potential \ndelays to anticipated transfers or discharge plans.  \n \n•  If a child is found to be at risk for COVID-19 and HAS symptoms of respiratory disease: \n  Isolate the child in a negative pressure isolation room.

Effective immediately and until further notice ORR requires care providers to:\n \n·        Take two (2) temperature checks of each child in their care daily (once in the morning and\nonce in the evening), following appropriate thermometer disinfection and infection\ncontrol procedures between each use. Care providers must document children’s\ntemperatures in a master census temperature report to be updated twice daily. ORR\nrecommends you maintain a spreadsheet or hard copy document with UAC’s name, A# and\ndates which captures the child’s temperature twice daily.\nSeparately care providers report fevers to ORR Intakes at Orrducs_Intakes@acf.hhs.gov,\nonly if a child has a temperature of 100° or above, and daily there after until no child(ren)\nhave a temperature of  100° or above using the attached UAC Temperature Tracker\nspreadsheet. Care providers must password protect the UAC Temperature Tracker using the\nstandard password when submitting the spreadsheet to ORR Intakes.\n \nIf a child has a temperature above 100°, please also follow guidelines provided in the March\n13th COVID-19 Interim Guidance for ORR Programs by submitting the “INTERIM COVID-10\nAcute Respiratory Disease Transfer and Discharge Tracker”.\n \n·        Require any staff member or visitor to the care provide facility to undergo mandatory\ntemperature checks prior to entering the facility.\n \n·        Further, ORR care providers are prohibited from allowing entry of any individual (except\nUAC in the process of admission) who meet any of the following criteria:\nA fever of above 100° or above;\no   \nSigns of symptoms of an acute respiratory infection, such as a cough, shortness of\no   \nbreath;\nIn the previous 14 days has had contact with someone with a confirmed diagnosis of\no   \nCOVID-19; is under investigation for COVID-19; or\nIn the previous 14 days has travelled internationally to countries with widespread,\no   \nsustained community transmission.

If a formal \npolicy is not in place, then the grantee should adopt one as soon as possible. The policy(ies) should \nbe in compliance generally with 45 CFR Part 75, but more specifically with 45 CFR 75.402-404 \n(reasonable and allowable costs); 45 CFR 75.432 Compensation – fringe benefits, and 45 CFR 75.437 \nEmployee health and welfare costs. \n \nQ2: Should care provider staff be asked to use their personal leave if they have contracted or been \nexposed to COVID-19? \nA2: If the employee reasonably believes they have contracted or been exposed to COVID-19, ORR \nstrongly recommends that they should NOT be required to use personal leave, but may qualify under \nyour policies for sick or other leave and continue to be paid as normal, consistent with those policies, \nin order to avoid exposure to the virus. Leave policies should be in compliance generally with 45 CFR \nPart 75, but more specifically with 45 CFR 75.402-404 (reasonable and allowable costs); 45 CFR \n75.432 Compensation – fringe benefits, and 45 CFR 75.437 Employee health and welfare costs. \n \nQ3: Will care providers pay the employee if their illness is COVID-19 associated (diagnosed or exposed)?   \nA3: Yes, if the individual tests positive or remains quarantined due to COVID-19 exposure. If they are \ntested and are sick from another illness, appropriate sick or other leave must be used. Again, leave \npolicies should be in compliance generally with 45 CFR Part 75, but more specifically with 45 CFR \n75.402-404 (reasonable and allowable costs); 45 CFR 75.432 Compensation – fringe benefits, and 45 \nCFR 75.437 Employee health and welfare costs. \n \nQ4: How long may grantee staff be paid if quarantined?  \nA4: Currently, ORR recommends paying quarantined staff for the CDC recommendations or for as long \nas a doctor recommends. \n \nQ5: May care providers pay their staff overtime during this period? \nA5: Yes, the care provider must contact their ORR Project Officer and Grants Management Specialist if \nthey need to move funds in order to compensate staff for overtime.  \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230-6   Filed 03/27/20   Page 3 of 5   Page ID\n #:5532\nUnification:  \n \nQ6:  Are care providers able to fly unaccompanied alien children (UAC) for reunification, or should ground \ntransportation be utilized? \nA6: At this time, care providers may still use air travel for the purpose of unifying a child with their \nsponsor. Before traveling, please assess the safety of the locations the minors will be traveling to.  If \nthere is a known exposure risk or a community lockdown, please work with your Federal Field \nSpecialist (FFS) to postpone release until it is safe for the minor to travel1. At the time of this writing, \nthe White House and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have not issued domestic \ntravel restrictions within the United States. Please review the latest recommendations and guidance \non the CDC’s website:  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html. \n \nQ7: May care providers reduce the number of staff who escort UACs who are unifying with their \nsponsors? \nA7: Yes, programs may reduce the number of staff who escort children on flights, as long as the ratio is \nreasonable. Per ORR Policy Guide 3.3.14, to the greatest extent possible under the circumstances, \nwhen transporting UAC, care providers will assign transport staff of the same gender as the child or \nyouth.  Additionally, the CDC is not recommending individuals to self-quarantine unless exposed \ndirectly to COVID-19 per the following guidance: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-\nncov/travelers/index.html. Care providers may also use the CDC’s risk assessment guidance as a \nresource when arranging travel for UACs who are unifying with their sponsors: \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/risk-assessment.html and \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/index.html  \n \nQ8: Is there any flexibility on the requirement to physically transfer custody of a UAC to a sponsor within \n3 days of an approved release?  \nA8: To the greatest extent possible, care providers should secure transportation for the child within 3 \ndays after ORR approves release. However, if care providers are having issues securing transportation \nor finding an escort for the reunification, care providers must make a concerted effort to release the \nchild as close to the required time frames as possible, and also note the reasons for the delay in \nrelevant documentation. Alternatively, sponsors can also make arrangements to pick a UAC up \ndirectly from the care provider.  Please assess the safety of the locations the minor will be traveling \nto before releasing the minor to their sponsor.  If there is a known exposure risk or a community \nlockdown, please work with your FFS to postpone release until it is safe for the minor to travel. \n \nServices:  \n \nQ9: Will care providers still be held to the mandated timeline for certain services (i.e., an initial medical \nexam within 48 hours), or will there be flexibility given the strain of resources in some communities \nand programs during this crisis? \nA9: To the greatest extent possible, care providers should meet service requirements within ORR’s \nrequired time frames. However, if constraints on resources and staffing prevent care providers from \nmeeting the timelines for all services, care providers must make a concerted effort to meet the \n1 As outlined in 45 CFR Part 410.301(a) “ORR releases a UAC to an approved sponsor without unnecessary delay, \nbut may continue to retain custody of a UAC if ORR determines that continued custody is necessary to ensure the \nUAC's safety or the safety of others, or that continued custody is required to secure the UAC's timely appearance \nbefore DHS or the immigration courts.” \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230-6   Filed 03/27/20   Page 4 of 5   Page ID\n #:5533\nrequirements as close to the required time frames as possible, and also note the reasons for the \ndelay in relevant documentation. \n \nQ10: Can Transitional Foster Care programs provide gift cards to compensate Foster Parents for the cost \nof the meals and snacks that children would normally eat during school hours?  \nA10: It is ORR’s responsibility to bear the cost of care for UAC.  Keeping this in mind, care providers \nshould renegotiate the rate at which they pay the foster parents to include the additional meals. \nBecause the duration of these events is unknown at this time, an alternative approach is for care \nproviders to set up a system by which foster parents can request reimbursement from the care \nprovider for the additional meals, and the care provider can subsequently request reimbursement \nfrom ORR for these amounts.  \nIn addition, for awareness, USDA is helping school districts across the country set up meal \ndistribution sites where children can pick up meals and take them home. Grantees may encourage \nfoster parents to call their local school district office or social services agency to find out about \noptions available in their area. \n \nQ11: If necessary, can care providers provide remote case management and clinical services through \ntelephone or video conferencing?  \nA11: Yes, case managers and clinicians may provide remote case management and clinical services, as \nlong as the care provider has that functionality in place.  If a minor is in a crisis/emergency \nsituation, the program is expected to provide face to face intervention. \n \nQ12: Can Legal Service Providers (LSPs) provide legal services through telephone or video conferencing? \nA12:  Yes, LSPs may use telephone or video conferencing to provide services to UACs. Care providers \nshould work in coordination with the LSPs to assure the continuity of legal services as a mission \ncritical requirement to UAC.    \n \nQ13: Can care providers still take UACs on community outings at this time? \nA13:  At this time, care providers should generally avoid taking children to public spaces and should \nreview current guidance and recommendations of “social distancing” by the White House, CDC, \nand state/local governments.  Note: Providers must ensure minors are still going outside for \nexercise and fresh air as long as shelters are able to maintain social distancing. See CDC’s \nrecommended guidance: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/index.html \nand the White House’s recommended guidance: https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/03.16.20 coronavirus-guidance 8.5x11 315PM.pdf  \n \nQ14: How long can UACs in TFC and LTFC programs remain out of school? If programs are not prepared \nfor virtual learning are any budget modifications allowed to allow programs to obtain the necessary \nequipment? \nA14: Care providers should follow the educational guidance of their local communities (following \nrecommendations provided by state/local governments, or the local board of education).  At this \ntime, if care providers require modification of their budgets to add provisions for interim \neducational services, they must contact their ORR Project Officer as soon as possible.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230-6   Filed 03/27/20   Page 5 of 5   Page ID\n #:5534\nMedical: \n \nQ15: Will assistance be available for maintaining inventory of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), if \nnecessary? \nA15: Programs should use all commercial resources available to them to maintain an appropriate \ninventory of PPE, while keeping in mind the nationwide shortage for these materials.  If all other \nefforts have been exhausted, programs should contact the following email, UAC COVID-\n19@acf.hhs.gov and the response team will attempt to assist with PPE shortfalls.   \n \nQ16:  If a UAC is hospitalized, should the program still visit the child in the hospital? \nA16:  Staff should follow the hospital’s visitation protocols and their state licensing requirements. If the \nhospital prohibits visitors, the care provider should be checking in with the UAC by telephone \nevery day and connecting with supervising medical staff on a regular basis.  \n \nStaffing and Supervision: \n \nQ17: If many staff are absent due to illness, quarantine, or issues with their own childcare, to the point \nwhere they do not meet ORR minimum staffing ratios, what should the program do? \nA17: If a care provider is at risk of not maintaining required staff supervision ratios, please contact your \nassigned ORR Project Officer immediately to discuss next steps. \n \nQ18: To ease any staffing or supervision shortfalls, if a care provider has multiple programs in one \nconcentrated area, can they consolidate children in one shelter, as long as it meets licensing \nrequirements? \nA18: Yes, as long as the care provider still meets state licensing requirements.  The care provider should \ncontact their ORR Project Officer, FFS, and the Intakes team to discuss. \n \nQ19: Will ORR consider paying for grantee employees’ personal child care while they are working?  \nA19: No, ORR cannot compensate grantee employees for their personal child care expenses. \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230-7   Filed 03/27/20   Page 1 of 4   Page ID\n #:5535\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nExhibit W \nORR March 20 Stop Placement \n   \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230-7   Filed 03/27/20   Page 2 of 4   Page ID\n #:5536\nFrom:  @Vera.org>  \nSent: Friday, March 20, 2020 3:27 PM \nTo:  \n \n \nSubject: RE: COVID‐19 Stop Placements \n \nDear    \nThank you for sharing.  We will share with our subcontractors.    \nOn the call we were told there was a stop placement for Washington, New York and California.  I see a number of other \nsites outside of those states on the list below but I assume that is a safeguard given the social distancing best practice \nand the conditions at the program (not because of suspected infection at those sites).  Is that correct?    \nWe see Canaan New York on the list.  Is that operational?  We had not yet been informed they were up and running.   \nThank you, \n \n \nFrom:  @acf.hhs.gov>  \nSent: Friday, March 20, 2020 11:08 AM \nTo:  @Vera.org>;  Vera.org>;  @Vera.org>;   \n@Vera.org>;  @vera.org> \nCc:  \n \nSubject: COVID‐19 Stop Placements \n \n* PLEASE NOTE: EXTERNAL EMAIL *  \nGood Afternoon All: \nHope all is well.  Please see the below stop placements in place as discussed in the earlier email correspondence related \nto COVID‐19: \n  \nRegards, \n \n  \n2\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230-7   Filed 03/27/20   Page 3 of 4   Page ID\n #:5537\n3\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230-7   Filed 03/27/20   Page 4 of 4   Page ID\n #:5538\n  \n \n \nDivision of Unaccompanied Children Operations \nOffice of Refugee Resettlement \nMary E. Switzer Building, 5th Floor \n330 C Street SW, Washington, D.C.  20201 \n(  \n \nacf.hhs.gov \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n4\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230-8   Filed 03/27/20   Page 1 of 3   Page ID\n #:5539\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nExhibit X \nORR March 23 Field Guidance \n   \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230-8   Filed 03/27/20   Page 2 of 3   Page ID\n #:5540\nMarch 23, 2020 \nDear ORR Care Provider: \nThe Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) is issuing additional field guidance to all programs to take \nproactive measures and limit the spread of COVID-19.

The care provider may use the thermometer(s) they currently have on hand, \nfollowing appropriate thermometer disinfection and infection control procedures between each \nuse, until no-touch thermometers are procured. ORR providers are required to undertake all \nreasonable efforts to acquire a sufficient number of no-touch thermometers for their population \nas expeditiously as possible. \n \nCare providers must document children’s temperatures in a master census temperature report \nto be updated twice daily.  ORR recommends you maintain a spreadsheet or hard copy \ndocument with UAC’s name, A# and dates which captures the child’s temperature twice daily. \nSeparately care providers report fevers to ORR Intakes at Orrducs Intakes@acf.hhs.gov, only if \na child has a temperature of 100° or above, and daily there after until no child(ren) have a \ntemperature of 100° or above using the attached UAC Temperature Tracker spreadsheet.  Care \nproviders will password protect the UAC Temperature Tracker using the standard password \nwhen submitting the spreadsheet to ORR Intakes.  \nIf a child has a temperature above 100°, please also follow guidelines provided in the March 13th \nCOVID-19 Interim Guidance for ORR Programs by submitting the “INTERIM COVID-10 Acute \nRespiratory Disease Transfer and Discharge Tracker”.  \n \n•  Require any staff member or visitor to the care provide facility to undergo mandatory \ntemperature checks prior to entering the facility.

Please instruct the provider to \nnotify the medical provider and transporter in advance and inform them of potential concern \nfor COVID-19  \n•  In the event there is a serious health and safety need that requires an unannounced visit, \nlicensors/registrars should screen the provider before entering the program and instruct the provider \nas above if answering “Yes” to any questions.  \n•  The above protocol should be used when parents or family members request to visit a childcare \nprogram, and childcare providers should review with program leadership and staff to make any \nnecessary adjustments to program policies and protocols. \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230-9   Filed 03/27/20   Page 7 of 12   Page ID\n #:5548\n \nAdditionally, all the above facilities/programs/providers should contact any entities that have staff regularly \nvisiting their programs (e.g., contracted/per diem staffing agencies, pharmacy delivery organizations, itinerant \nprovider staff, cleaning agencies, etc.) to review and approve their screening protocols. If the protocols of \noutside entities do not meet these standards, providers should take responsibility for screening these visitors. \nFinally, as a reminder, all Staff/Providers should follow the CDC’s guidelines for infection control basics \nincluding hand hygiene: \n•  Infection Control Basics \n•  Hand Hygiene in Health Care Settings \n•  Handwashing:  Clean Hands Save Lives \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230-9   Filed 03/27/20   Page 8 of 12   Page ID\n #:5549\n \nANDREW M. CUOMO  SHEILA J. POOLE \n \nGovernor  Commissioner \n \n \n \n \nInformation for Child Care Programs \nIn an effort to support child care programs and be responsive to the needs of the community during this time, \nGovernor Cuomo has granted OCFS the authority to temporarily waive selective regulatory requirements.  The \nDivision of Child Care Services encourages programs who are either experiencing hardship due to COVID-19 \nor are in a position to assist those experiencing hardship due to COVID-19 to submit a waiver request to your \nlicensor/registrar.  Each request will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and approval will be time limited.  \nFor example, in light of school closings, a current FDC who is at capacity (8) might be willing and able to \naccept two additional school-aged children for the 14 days their school is closed.  The program must submit a \nwaiver request for consideration by OCFS which indicates how the health and safety of the children in the \nprogram will be maintained. OCFS is committed to reviewing these as expediently as possible.  If approval is \ngranted, the waiver would be limited to the duration of the school closure.  This program could submit another \nwaiver request in the event the school closure is extended, or other if the program has a new circumstance \nrequiring a waiver.  This is just one example of a potential waiver request.  Child care programs are \nencouraged to consider what scenarios (if any) are applicable to them specifically and apply as necessary \nthroughout the duration of this health crisis.  OCFS encourages innovative and entrepreneurial thinking to work \ntogether to get through this current crisis.  \nBelow are several Frequently Asked Questions compiled to provide guidance to the child care community.  \nOCFS will continue to add to this list as applicable.  Please reach out to your regulator with questions.  \n \nFrequently Asked Questions for Child Care Programs \nUpdated 3/23/2020 \n \nQ.    Are child care programs being ordered to close? \n \nA.   Child care programs are NOT being ordered to close.  In fact, quite the opposite is true.  Governor Cuomo \nand his administration consider child care to be an essential function critical to enabling parents to go to work.   \n \nQ.   Who can order an child care program to close due to COVID-19? \n \nA.   In certain circumstances, local authorities, mainly local Departments of Health, have the authority to direct \nprograms to close under quarantine or other emergency orders.  In addition, child care programs are business \nentities and can voluntarily close the program.  \n \n \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230-9   Filed 03/27/20   Page 9 of 12   Page ID\n #:5550\nQ. Have the requirements regarding staff/child ratios been lifted? \n \nA.   OCFS has been granted the authority to waive select regulatory requirements in order to meet \nthe need for child care services.  Staff/child ratio is one such requirement. You may contact your regulator and \nsubmit a waiver request.  For the duration of this emergency, there may be flexibility regarding certain \nregulatory requirements.   \n \nQ.  Have the regulations regarding comprehensive background clearance checks been lifted? \n \nA.  OCFS has been granted the authority to waive select regulatory requirements in order to meet \nthe need for child care services.  Comprehensive background clearance checks are one such requirement. You \nmay contact your regulator and submit a waiver request.  For the duration of this emergency, there may be \nflexibility regarding certain regulatory requirements.   \n \nQ.  How do child care programs maintain a perimeter of 6 feet while caring for them? \n \nA.  Adults must be in close proximity to young children in order to provide proper care.  It is important to take \nuniversal precautions. Ensure handwashing strategies are being followed including washing with soap and water \nfor at least 20 seconds.  When soap and water are not available individual wipes may be used in combination \nwith hand sanitizer. Also, be sure to perform routine substantial cleaning of the childcare program.   \n \nQ.  Are child care programs required to maintain a group size of 10 or less? \n \nA.  The Centers for Disease Control, in its guidance on events and mass gatherings recommends group size to \nten or fewer and therefore we ask providers to reconfigure space to limit overall density of rooms to ten or fewer \nchildren. See https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/large-events/index.html. \nYour licensed/registered capacity, however, remains in effect unless you’ve been approved for a waiver by OCFS \nas there may be ways for you to serve a greater number of children while continuing to prioritize their health and \nsafety and that of your employees. \n \nQ.  Why haven’t child care programs been closed? \n \nA.  Child care is considered an essential service.  In a time of crisis, other essential professionals must be able \nto go to work and have safe and suitable child care available to their children.  If you have openings in your \nprogram, please use those openings to serve the children of employees who are unable to work from home \nand must continue to report to their work location.  Please reach out to your local Child Care Resource and \nReferral agency and make them aware of any slots you have available. \n \nQ.  How do programs limit access to the program and try to reduce exposure to COVID-19? \n \nA.   Programs are encouraged to utilize these screening questions:  \n \n1. Within the last 14 days, have you traveled to a country that \nthe federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nshould be avoided for nonessential travel or where travelers \nshould practice enhanced precautions? \n(China, Iran, Italy, South Korea, Japan) \n \n2. Have you had contact with any person with known \nCOVID-19 or person under investigation for COVID-19? \n \n3. Do you have any symptoms of a respiratory infection (e.g., \ncough, sore throat, fever, shortness of breath)? \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230-9   Filed 03/27/20   Page 10 of 12   Page ID\n #:5551\n4. Are you or anyone in your home in active quarantine status? \n \nIf an individual responds “yes” to any of the above, do not allow that individual to enter the program.  Where \nstaffing allows, programs can implement strategies to reduce traffic in the program including meeting children \nat the door.   \n \n \n3/16/2020 \nQ. Is OCFS going to close my child care program because of COVID-19?  \nA. No. NYS Department of Health and local health departments will instruct a child care programs regarding \nhow to respond to COVID-19.  \nQ. What if my child care program is located in New York City? \nA. For child care programs located in NYC, including those regulated by OCFS, additional information can be \nobtained by going to the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene website at \nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/index.page.  The New York City Health Department will let you know if you are \nrequired to close your program.  For information about COVID-19 in New York City, including when to call your \nhealth care provider if you feel sick, visit: http://nyc.gov/health. \nQ. If my neighborhood school closes, is my child care program required to close?  \nA. No, unless the program is told to by a public health official, or if it is located in the school facility.  \nQ. What if my program is located in the containment bubble? What if there are new containment areas?  \nA. If a program is in the containment area and is directed to close, you will be contacted by local DOH. At this \ntime, group family and family day care homes are not considered places of mass gatherings. Day Care \nCenters and School Aged Child Care may or may not be considered places of mass gathering as it is based on \ntheir capacity.  Your local department of health will direct you. \nQ. What if I am directed to close, or choose to close?  \nA. In either case, you must inform your regulator.   \nQ. Families are contacting me who are needing child care, especially for school-aged children, but my \nprogram is full.   \nA. If you want to take the additional children, and believe your program can handle the additional children, \ncontact your regulator and submit a waiver request.  During the duration of this emergency, there may be \nflexibility regarding certain regulatory requirements.  \nQ. What if I want to expand my license/registration to serve more children temporarily? \nA. Contact your regulator and submit a waiver request.

How will I get by? \nA. We are receiving ongoing guidance from the federal Office of Child Care and considerations are being \nmade to support programs.  \nQ. What if a program staff /volunteer is mandated to be quarantined?  \nA. If the person tests positive for the virus, the program will be contacted by the local Department of Health \n(DOH) and will be directed on what steps are needed. It is likely the program will be directed to close and self-\nquarantine the remaining staff and children.  \nQ. What if a staff person at a child care program is precautionarily quarantined?  \nA. If a staff member has been exposed to the virus and has self-quarantined but has not tested positive, the \nindividual must not report to work during the quarantine period. The center may continue to operate unless \nnotified otherwise by local DOH.  \nQ. What if a parent of a child is quarantined?  \nA. In the event a parent of a child in your program must be quarantined, advise the parent they cannot enter \nthe child care program for any reason, including picking up their child. If the parent is exhibiting signs of illness \nor has been tested and is positive for the virus, they must utilize an emergency contact authorized by the \nparent to come pick up the child.  If the parent is being quarantined as a precautionary measure, without \nsymptoms or a positive test, child care staff should walk out or deliver the child to the parent outside the child \ncare building.  The child must not return to the child care program for the duration of the quarantine.   \nQ. What if a household member of a home-based provider is quarantined?  \nA. The program must not operate and must contact local DOH.  \nQ. What if a child is quarantined?   \nA.

If a child has been diagnosed as positive and has attended \nthe program within the past week, the program must contact local DOH.  \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230-9   Filed 03/27/20   Page 12 of 12   Page ID\n #:5553\nQ. What if a family seeks child care for school-aged children whose school has closed?  \nA. When bringing on additional children, for school-aged children, please confirm what school the child \nattends. OCFS will distribute lists of schools that have been mandatorily closed for quarantine to the regional \noffices. No children with any symptoms of illness, or children from schools under mandatory quarantine should \nattend programs.  \nQ.

AMANDA COHN, CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER, NATIONAL \n11  CENTER FOR IMMUNIZATIONS AND RESPIRATORY DISEASES,  \nCENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION \n12 \nI, Amanda Cohn, declare under penalty of perjury, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, that my testimony \n13 \nbelow is true and correct: \n14 \n1. I am currently on detail serving as the Acting Director, National Center for Birth Defects\n15 \nand Developmental Disabilities.  My permanent position is the Chief Medical Officer, National Center for \n16 \nImmunizations and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD).  I also serve as the Executive Secretary, Advisory \n17  Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which sets U.S. immunization policy.  Since January 3, \n18  2020, I have served as a Deputy Incident Manager for the CDC COVID-19 response, which became a full \nEmergency Operations Activation the week of January 19, 2020.   \n19 \n2. I have held the position of Chief Medical Officer, NCIRD since early 2019.  Prior to 2019,\n20 \nI was a Senior Advisor for Vaccines and Executive Secretary, ACIP, and served as the Deputy Director for \n21 \nImmunization Services Division, NCIRD.  I have been a medical officer focused on vaccine-preventable \n22 \ndiseases and respiratory diseases at CDC since 2004.   \n23 \n3. I received my medical degree from Emory School of Medicine in 2001.  From 2001-2004,\n24  I completed an internship and residency in Pediatrics at Boston Children’s Hospital and Boston Medical \n25  Center.  From 2004-2006, I was an Epidemic Intelligence Service Officer at CDC, where I received \nspecialized training in epidemiology, outbreak control, and vaccine-preventable diseases.   \n26 \n4. In my current role, I am responsible for the Influenza Coordination Unit and Vaccine Policy\n27 \nin NCIRD.  In addition to my role as the Executive Secretary, ACIP, I am an internal CDC subject matter \n28 \nresource for cross-cutting immunization issues, including immunization in shelter settings.  Additionally, \n1 \n30\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230-11   Filed 03/27/20   Page 3 of 7   Page ID\n #:5559\n \n1  I have led and overseen planning and preparedness for pandemic influenza and other respiratory disease \nthreats.  I have been the NCIRD lead for border health issues, including supporting government agencies \n2 \nin prevention and control of vaccine-preventable diseases among staff and persons in custody of the U.S. \n3 \ngovernment.   As the Deputy Incident Manager of the CDC COVID-19 response, I am responsible for \n4 \nguidance related to healthcare settings, worker safety, community mitigation, and at-risk populations.  I \n5 \nhave also provided oversight on movement and monitoring guidance for persons exposed to COVID-19, \n6  as well as the guidance for mass gatherings.     \n7  5.  In the course of performing my job duties, I have reviewed and am familiar with CDC’s \nguidance regarding COVID-19, including the CDC guidance applicable to various congregate settings \n8 \nincluding institutes of higher education, detention facilities, nursing homes, and homeless shelters, all of \n9 \nwhich is available on CDC’s website. \n10 \n6.  In addition, in the course of performing my job duties, I have consulted with the Office of \n11 \nRefugee  Resettlement  (“ORR”)  on  multiple  clinical  issues  over  the  years.    As  a  result  of  those \n12 \nconsultations, I have general familiarity with the structure and operations of ORR, the population of \n13  unaccompanied alien children (“UAC”) in ORR care, and the ORR network of grantee care provider \n14  facilities.   \n7.  In 2014, I was the Vaccines Task Force lead for the CDC’s effort to support ORR’s response \n15 \nto the influx of UAC at the Southwestern Border. I was a co-author on a report “Multistate Outbreak of \n16 \nRespiratory Infections Among Unaccompanied Children, June 2014-July 2014” published in the journal \n17 \nClinical Infectious Diseases.  I have provided technical comments on many ORR guidance documents over \n18 \nthe years and consulted with ORR on multiple issues around immunization, vaccine-preventable disease \n19  outbreaks, and influenza prevention and control. \n20  8.  More recently, I reviewed ORR’s guidance to care provider facilities on COVID-19 to \nconfirm that it aligned with CDC’s guidelines and recommendations, and the best practices for preventing \n21 \nand controlling the spread of COVID-19 within residential facilities.  This includes guidance related to \n22 \nsymptom and temperature monitoring of staff and children, cleaning and hygiene guidance, and ensuring \n23 \nthe ability to isolate ill UAC and quarantine potentially exposed UAC.  As part of my review, I conferred \n24 \nwith ORR’s Director of the Division of Health for Unaccompanied Children (“DHUC”), Dr. Michael \n25  Bartholomew, on how to best ensure the health and safety of UAC and staff.  Over the last two weeks, I \n26  have received and responded to multiple requests from ORR for consultation to ensure their guidance is \nconsistent with the most up to date and rapidly evolving CDC guidance. \n27 \n9.  My testimony in this declaration is based upon my personal knowledge; information about \n28 \nORR’s response to COVID-19 that I received in emails from and phone calls with the relevant ORR \n \n2 \n30   \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230-11   Filed 03/27/20   Page 4 of 7   Page ID\n #:5560\n \n1  personnel in the regular course of performing my job duties; and CDC guidance documents regarding \nCOVID-19, which I obtained from the CDC’s official website and reviewed in connection with the \n2 \nperformance of my job duties.  In preparing this declaration, I also reviewed the declaration of ORR Deputy \n3 \nDirector Jallyn Sualog, and the memorandum of law and declarations submitted by the Plaintiffs in support \n4 \nof their request for a temporary restraining order in the Lucas R. case. \n5 \n10.  I am testifying in this declaration to the best of my knowledge, and understand that this \n6  declaration is for use in the Lucas R. case. \n7  Background Regarding COVID-19 \n8  11.   COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that originally caused an outbreak of respiratory illness \nin Wuhan, China. COVID-19 is spread primarily by person-to-person contact through droplets produced \n9 \nwhen  an  infected  person  coughs  or  sneezes.    COVID-19  may  also  spread  through  contact  with \n10 \ncontaminated surfaces or objects, and there is emerging evidence that there may be asymptomatic or pre-\n11 \nsymptomatic transmission. \n12 \n12.  Since the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, COVID-19 has spread across the globe.  On \n13  January 30, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization declared that COVID-19 \n14  constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.  On March 11, 2020, the World Health \nOrganization classified COVID-19 as a pandemic. \n15 \n13.  COVID-19 now presents a significant public health risk in the United States. On January \n16 \n31, 2020, the Secretary of HHS declared that a public health emergency exists under section 319 of the \n17 \nPublic Health Service Act.  On March 13, 2020, the President issued a Proclamation on Declaring a \n18 \nNational Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak.  As of March 16, \n19  2020, all 50 states and several local and territorial jurisdictions declared states of emergency. \n20  14.  There are currently confirmed COVID-19 infections in every state and the number of \nconfirmed infections is increasing on a daily basis.  Globally and in the United States, the groups at risk \n21 \nfor severe disease, and a majority of the morbidity and mortality, is older adults and persons with multiple \n22 \nco-morbidities.   \n23 \n15.  CDC believes that there is currently community-based transmission of COVID-19 ongoing \n24 \nin many communities across the United States.  Several cities and states have widespread transmission \n25  where the healthcare systems and public health are overwhelmed.   \n26  CDC Guidances to the Public and Institutions \n27  16.  To protect the public health, CDC has issued guidance to the general public advising \nindividuals to limit non-essential travel and social contacts, and to practice social-distancing when outside \n28 \ntheir homes (i.e., maintain a distance of at least six feet from others while in public).  Essentially, this \n \n3 \n30   \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230-11   Filed 03/27/20   Page 5 of 7   Page ID\n #:5561\n \n1  guidance encourages all Americans to practice the shelter-in-place strategy now mandated in certain states.  \nCDC, however, does not recommend that individuals within the same domicile, or living unit, attempt to \n2 \npractice social distancing unless there is a known exposure to COVID-19. \n3 \n17.  CDC’s guidance to the general public related to limiting the size of gatherings is intended \n4 \nto complement, not supersede, the more detailed guidance intended for specific congregate settings such \n5 \nas institutions of higher education, nursing homes, prisons, and homeless shelters. In all of these guidance \n6  documents related to congregate living settings, CDC recommends institutions implement practices \n7  tailored to their particular circumstances.    \n8  18.  In general, the various CDC guidance documents for specific congregate settings adopt a \ntwo-pronged approach of reducing the potential for a case to occur in a facility (prevention) and limiting \n9 \nthe spread of cases in a facility if a case occurs (containment).  Prevention refers to precautions facilities \n10 \ncan take to prevent individuals infected with, or possibly exposed to COVID-19, from entering in the first \n11 \nplace—thus, reducing the risk of exposure to those inside.  Effective prevention measures for congregate \n12 \nsettings include screening visitors for COVID-19 risk factors, such as travel to a heavily infected area, \n13  contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19, or exhibiting symptoms of the disease (i.e., fever, cough, \n14  shortness of breath).  Prevention also entails the adoption of rigorous hygiene practices within facilities, \nincluding more frequent cleaning, particularly of high-traffic surfaces and shared spaces. \n15 \n19.  Containment focuses on limiting spread from any potential infections that may emerge \n16 \nwithin a facility, by regularly monitoring the population within the facility for signs of COVID-19 \n17 \ninfection.  In the event any individual exhibits possible symptoms of COVID-19 infection, the individual \n18 \nis to be immediately isolated and tested.  In addition, any contacts that individual may have had with others \n19  should be traced, and those individuals should be monitored, and possibly isolated depending on the nature \n20  of the contact.  Like any contagious disease, the risk of acquiring COVID-19 from contact with a confirmed \ncase depends on the nature and extent of the contact. \n21 \n20.  ORR’s current COVID-19 procedures are consistent with CDC guidances for congregate \n22 \nsettings;  they  direct  grantee  care-provider  facilities  to  implement  both  prevention  and  containment \n23 \nmeasures.  In some respects, ORR’s current COVID-19 procedures actually exceed those set forth in the \n24 \nCDC guidances to congregate care facilities.  For example, ORR’s twice-daily temperature monitoring \n25  regime goes beyond what CDC has recommended for other congregate settings.  Additionally, ORR \n26  facilities have preparedness plans that ensure immediate care is provided to ill children. \n27  21.  Further, ORR’s stop-placement orders in California, New York, and Washington are \nconsistent with CDC and other public guidance recommending that non-essential travel and public \n28 \nmovements be avoided, especially to areas in the U.S. with widespread transmission.  For example, the \n \n4 \n30   \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230-11   Filed 03/27/20   Page 6 of 7   Page ID\n #:5562\n \n1  White House recently issued guidance that all persons who recently travelled to New York should be under \nhome quarantine for 14 days.  These three states are currently in the acceleration phase of the epidemic; \n2 \nthe expectation is that in the next several days to weeks these areas will be in a deceleration phase and other \n3 \nstates may be in the acceleration phase.   \n4 \n22.  My understanding is that the Plaintiffs in this case have requested the expedited release of \n5 \nUAC in ORR custody to sponsors located throughout the United States.  Moving UAC children outside of \n6  custody likely increases risk of exposing UAC to COVID-19 relative to remaining in custody, given that \n7  they are currently housed in well-controlled environments and may be transferred to areas where there is \nwidespread community transmission, or to homes where there may be persons who have been exposed. \n8 \n23.  In addition to the prevention and containment practices ORR has already implemented, it is \n9 \nmy understanding that ORR has adequate space within its facilities to isolate any UAC suspected of or \n10 \nconfirmed to be infected with COVID-19, given that the ORR network of grantee care-provider facilities \n11 \nis currently operating at approximately 30% capacity.  Moreover, the CDC’s recent order prohibiting the \n12 \nintroduction of certain aliens into the U.S. is anticipated to reduce the number of new UAC entering ORR’s \n13  care.  Given the amount of space within the ORR network and the relatively static nature of its current \n14  population,  maintaining  their  current  living  situation  and  not  releasing  UAC  to  communities  with \nwidespread transmission is the most prudent measure to reduce the risk of infection among the current \n15 \npopulation of UAC.  Although there is a risk of cases of COVID-19 in a UAC facility among UAC or staff, \n16 \nwith all of the protective measures ORR has implemented and the current space available in facilities to \n17 \nmanage ill UAC, based on currently available information the overall risk to UAC is lower in the facilities \n18 \nthan traveling and placing children in home environments in some locations in the U.S. at this time.  \n19  24.  Requiring UAC to travel significant distances (presumably, via plane, train, or bus) and \n20  enter new living environments poses a significant risk of exposing UAC to COVID-19 both in transit, and \nupon arrival into their sponsor’s household, where it is uncertain how vigorously the occupants have \n21 \navoided exposure to COVID-19 themselves.  Given the high prevalence of COVID-19 in the general \n22 \ncommunity, removing UAC from their current living environments presents a serious risk of exposing them \n23 \nto COVID-19. \n24 \n25.  Fortunately, the vast majority of individuals who become infected with COVID-19 will \n25  experience only mild symptoms, and there have been very few reports of serious illness among children \n26  and adolescents globally.  The general advice to those with mild cases of COVID-19 is the same advice \nthat would be given to an individual with a bad cold or flu:  stay at home and avoid contact with others; \n27 \nrest; drink plenty of fluids; manage symptoms with over-the-counter-medications, and seek medical \n28 \nattention if symptoms worsen. \n \n5 \n30   \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 230-11   Filed 03/27/20   Page 7 of 7   Page ID\n #:5563\n \n1  26.  The population of UAC in ORR care are not at any significantly increased risk from \nCOVID-19, and have access to strong medical care that is equal to or greater than what they would have \n2 \nin the community should they need it.  UAC are primarily healthy adolescents, which currently available \n3 \ninformation indicates are not at an increased risk of experiencing serious or severe cases of COVID-19 that \n4 \nwould require hospitalization or mechanical respiratory support. \n5 \n27.  CDC is committed to continuing to work with ORR to ensure that its COVID-19 procedures \n6  are informed by the latest CDC guidance, which in turn is shaped by the latest epidemiological information \n7  available about the ongoing pandemic. \n \n8 \nExecuted on March 27, 2020. \n9 \n \n10 \n \n11  _______________________________________ \n12  Amanda Cohn, MD \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n6 \n30   ",

The  named  Plaintiffs  are  immigrant  and  asylum-seeking  children \n15  detained for alleged civil violations of the INA and are members of the class protected \n16  under the settlement in Flores, v. Sessions, No. 85-cv-4544-DMG (AGRx) (C.D. Cal.) \n17  (“Flores Settlement”). Plaintiffs file this complaint as an adjunct and supplement to \n18  their motion to enforce their rights under the Flores Settlement.

The Flores Settlement and TVPRA § 235 oblige ORR to — \n22  (a)  minimize the detention of immigrant children by releasing them to their \n23  parents or other qualified custodians so long as their continued detention \n24  is not required due to dangerousness or unusual flight risk;  \n25  (b)  place detained immigrant children in the least restrictive setting that is in \n26  the best interest of individual children—generally a facility having a state \n27  license to care for dependent, as opposed to delinquent, juveniles—for \n28  however long as they remain in federal custody;  \nCenter for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \nComplaint  1.  256 S.

ORR violates the foregoing requirements, as well as the Due Process \n9  Clause  of  the  Fifth  Amendment  of  the  U.S.  Constitution  and  the  Freedom  of \n10  Association Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, by pursuing the \n11  following policies and practices: \n12  (a)  ORR  confines children in staff-secure facilities, residential  treatment \n13  centers  (“RTCs”),  and  secure  facilities  peremptorily,  often  on  bare \n \n14  allegations they are dangerous or pose a flight risk, without affording \n15  them  a  meaningful  or  timely  opportunity  to  be  heard  regarding  the \n16  reasons for such placement; \n17  (b)  ORR prolongs children’s detention on the ground that their parents or \n18  other available custodians are or may be unfit, while affording neither \n19  detained juveniles nor their proposed custodians a meaningful or timely \n20  opportunity to be heard regarding a proposed custodian’s fitness; \n21  (c)  ORR  places  children  in  residential  treatment  facilities  and  detention \n22  facilities  in  which  it  knows  they  will  be  administered  powerful \n23  psychotropic  medications  for  weeks,  months,  or  years,  without \n24  procedural safeguards, including seeking their parents’ consent—even \n25  those who are present in the United States and readily available to grant \n26  or withhold consent to ORR’s medicating their children—or other lawful \n27  authorization; and \n28  (d)  ORR blocks lawyers from representing detained children with respect to \nCenter for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \nComplaint  2.  256 S.

By this action, Plaintiffs seek equitable relief on behalf of themselves and \n7  those similarly situated requiring Defendants to conform their polices, practices, and \n8  procedures to the Flores Settlement, § 235 of the TVPRA, the Due Process Clause of \n9  the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and the Freedom of Association Clause \n10  of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Plaintiffs also seek nominal damages \n11  against individual Defendant E. Scott Lloyd in his personal capacity pursuant to Bivens \n12  v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971). \n13  II. \n \n14  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n15  6.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Paragraph 37 of \n16  the Flores Settlement (providing for “the enforcement, in this District Court, of the \n17  provisions of this Agreement except for claims brought under Paragraph 24”); 28 \n18  U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question jurisdiction); and 28 U.S.C. § 2241 (habeas corpus \n19  jurisdiction). \n20  7.  Plaintiffs’ action for declaratory relief is brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n21  §§ 2201 and 2202, and 5 U.S.C. § 703. \n22  8.  Venue is properly in this court pursuant to Paragraph 37 of the Flores \n23  Settlement and 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) and (e)(1), because this action challenges class-\n24  wide violations of the Flores Settlement, and because acts complained of herein \n25  occurred in this district, Defendants have offices in this district, and no real property \n26  is involved in this action. \n27  9.

Plaintiff Lucas R.1 is a native and citizen of Guatemala whom ORR is \n5  currently detaining at the Shiloh Residential Treatment Center (“Shiloh RTC”) in \n6  Texas. He was born in 2005 and is twelve years old. Lucas is, and at all relevant times \n7  was, an unaccompanied alien child within the meaning of 6 U.S.C. § 279(g)(2) and a \n8  member of the plaintiff class the Flores Settlement protects. Pursuant to Federal Rule \n9  of  Civil  Procedure  17(c)(2),  Lucas  appears  through  his  Next  Friend  and  sister, \n10  Madelyn R., a resident of Los Angeles, California. ORR has refused to release Lucas \n11  to his Next Friend and sister on the ground that Madelyn’s home may be unfit. \n12  11.  Plaintiff Daniela Marisol T. is a native and citizen of Honduras in ORR \n13  custody in a residential group home in Kentwood, Michigan. Daniela Marisol was \n \n14  born in 2001 and is sixteen years old. Daniela Marisol is, and at all relevant times was, \n15  an unaccompanied alien child within the meaning of 6 U.S.C. § 279(g)(2) and a \n16  member of the plaintiff class the Flores Settlement protects. Pursuant to Federal Rule \n17  of Civil Procedure 17(c)(2), Daniela Marisol appears through her Next Friend and \n18  sister, Katherine L., a resident of St. Paul, Minnesota. ORR has refused to release \n19  Daniela Marisol to her Next Friend and sister on the ground that Katherine is or may \n20  be unfit.  \n21  12.  Plaintiff Gabriela N. is a native and citizen of El Salvador whom ORR is \n22  presently detaining in St. Michael’s Home for Children in Houston, Texas. She was \n23  born in 2000 and is seventeen years old. Gabriela is, and at all relevant times was, an \n24  unaccompanied alien child within the meaning of 6 U.S.C. § 279(g)(2) and a member \n25  of the plaintiff class the Flores Settlement protects. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \n26  Procedure 17(c)(2), Gabriela appears through her Next Friend and grandfather, Isaac \n27                                             \n1 Plaintiffs concurrently seek permission to use pseudonyms for the named Plaintiffs \n28  and their Next Friends.  \nCenter for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \nComplaint  4.  256 S.

ORR has refused to release Gabriela to her Next \n2  Friend and grandfather on the ground that Isaac is or may be unfit. \n3  13.  Plaintiff Miguel Angel S. is a native and citizen of Mexico whom ORR \n4  is presently detaining at Yolo County Juvenile Detention Center (“Yolo”), a secure \n5  facility in Woodland, California. He was born in 2001 and is seventeen years old. \n6  Miguel Angel is, and at all relevant times was, an unaccompanied alien child within \n7  the meaning of 6 U.S.C. § 279(g)(2) and a member of the plaintiff class the Flores \n8  Settlement protects. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(c)(2), Miguel \n9  Angel appears through his Next Friend and father, Gerardo S., a resident of San Jose, \n10  California. ORR has refused to release Miguel Angel to his Next Friend and father on \n11  the ground that Gerardo is or may be unfit. \n12  14.  Plaintiff Jaime D. is a native and citizen of Honduras and presently being \n13  held in ORR custody in Dobbs Ferry, New York. He was born in 2004 and is thirteen \n \n14  years old. Jaime is, and at all relevant times was, an unaccompanied alien child within \n15  the meaning of 6 U.S.C. § 279(g)(2) and a member of the plaintiff class the Flores \n16  Settlement protects. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(c)(2), Jaime \n17  appears through his Next Friend, Reyna D., a resident of Riverdale, Maryland. Reyna \n18  is Jaime’s aunt. Reyna has sought to be Jaime’s custodian and to have Jaime released \n19  from ORR custody into her care.  \n20  15.  Plaintiff San Fernando Valley Refugee Children Center, Inc. (“Children \n21  Center”) is a non-profit organization incorporated in the State of California, with its \n22  principal place of business in North Hills, California. The Children Center is a project \n23  of  the  North  Hills  United  Methodist  Church’s  Hispanic  Mission.  The  Children \n24  Center’s mission is to provide comprehensive social services, including mental health \n25  care,  shelter,  transitional  living  assistance  and  legal  aid,  to  children,  youth,  and \n26  families who have come in search of refuge from persecution and endemic violence in \n27  the Northern Triangle of Central America (El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala). \n28  The children and youth the Children Center serves are the functional equivalents of its \nCenter for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \nComplaint  5.  256 S. Occidental Blvd. \nLos Angeles, CA 90057 \n213/388-8693 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 1   Filed 06/29/18   Page 8 of 43   Page ID #:8\n \n1  members. The rights of children and youth the Children Center seeks to protect in this \n2  action are germane to its mission and purpose. ORR’s policies and practices, as alleged \n3  herein, make it substantially more difficult for the Children Center to carry out its \n4  mission. For example, many of the children and youth whom the Children Center \n5  serves  have  suffered  multiple  psychological  and  physical  traumas,  first  in  their \n6  countries of origin, next during their journeys through Mexico, and then again, upon \n7  being  arrested  and  detained  for  immigration  violations.  The  more  time  already-\n8  traumatized children and youth remain detained, separated from their parents and \n9  families, the more their mental and physical health deteriorates. The trauma that \n10  immigration detention causes children and youth is greater still when ORR places them \n11  in restrictive settings such as juvenile halls and RTCs, or medicates them involuntarily \n12  or without their parents’ consent or other lawful authority. The additional trauma such \n13  detention  inflicts  requires  the  Children  Center  to  devote  commensurately  greater \n \n14  resources, particularly mental health resources, to assist such children and youth to \n15  recover.  \n16  16.  The Children Center is one of a small number of non-profit organizations \n17  that serve refugee children and youth. The Children Center’s resources are limited and \n18  do not allow it to help all who are in need. The Children Center’s ability to raise funds \n19  depends in part on the raw number of children and youth it helps. As a practical matter, \n20  resources the Children Center’s devotes to serving one child or youth are unavailable \n21  to others. Defendants’ challenged policies and practices divert the Children Center’s \n22  limited resources to address the injuries those policies and practices cause, thereby \n23  reducing the number of other needy children and youth the Children Center is able to \n24  assist, and, a fortiori, its ability to raise funds. The Children Center therefore has a \n25  direct institutional interest in: (a) minimizing the time refugee children and youth are \n26  detained; (b) ensuring that such children and youth are housed in minimally restrictive \n27  settings  for  however  long  they  must  remain  in  immigration-related  detention; \n28  (c) minimizing the injury children and youth suffer as a result of taking psychotropic \nCenter for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \nComplaint  6.  256 S. Occidental Blvd. \nLos Angeles, CA 90057 \n213/388-8693 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 1   Filed 06/29/18   Page 9 of 43   Page ID #:9\n \n1  drugs; and (d) ensuring that refugee children and youth have counsel to assist them in \n2  all legal matters relating to their immigration status, including custody, placement, and \n3  the  administration  of  psychotropic  drugs  without  parental  consent.  The  direct \n4  participation in this litigation of the children and youth whom the Children Center \n5  serves is not necessary because Plaintiffs seek only prospective equitable relief and \n6  nominal damages.  \n7  17.  Plaintiff  Unaccompanied  Central  American  Refugee  Empowerment \n8  (“UCARE”) is an unincorporated consortium of non-profit agencies, most of which \n9  are incorporated in the State of California, with its principal place of business in Los \n10  Angeles, California. UCARE’s mission is to advocate for and provide legal and social \n11  services to immigrant and refugee minors, many of whom are or have been in ORR or \n12  Immigration  and  Customs  Enforcement  custody.  In  appropriate  cases,  UCARE \n13  arranges free representation and assistance to youth with immigration problems before \n \n14  the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the Executive Office of Immigration \n15  Review, and the Board of Immigration Appeals. Defendants’ unlawful policies, and \n16  practices, as alleged herein, make such assistance and representation substantially \n17  more difficult and render UCARE’s work less effective. ORR’s compliance with the \n18  Flores Settlement and § 235 of the TVPRA is germane to UCARE’s purpose. The \n19  individual  participation  of  aggrieved  youth  the  UCARE  serves  is  not  necessary \n20  because UCARE seeks only prospective or injunctive relief and nominal damages for \n21  its client members. UCARE has an actual stake in this litigation because the funding \n22  of UCARE’s member organizations is largely determined by the number of youth they \n23  serve. Defendants’ challenged policies and practices deny or delay children’s release, \n24  and thus delay or deny Plaintiff UCARE’s member organizations the opportunity to \n25  serve them. \n26  18.  Defendant  Alex  Azar  is  the  Secretary  of  HHS  and  oversees  ORR. \n27  Pursuant to 6 U.S.C. § 279, HHS is responsible for the proper care and placement of \n28  unaccompanied  alien  children  who  are  in  federal  custody  by  reason  of  their \nCenter for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \nComplaint  7.  256 S. Occidental Blvd. \nLos Angeles, CA 90057 \n213/388-8693 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 1   Filed 06/29/18   Page 10 of 43   Page ID #:10\n \n1  immigration status. HHS and ORR discharge these duties by, inter alia, entering into \n2  contracts  with  public  and  private  entities  to  house,  care  for,  and  provide  legal \n3  assistance to unaccompanied alien children arrested and detained pursuant to the INA. \n4  Defendant Azar is sued in his official capacity only. \n5  19.  Defendant E. Scott Lloyd is the Director of ORR. ORR is responsible for \n6  the care and custody of unaccompanied alien children in federal custody on account \n7  of their immigration status. Defendant Lloyd is sued in his individual capacity for \n8  nominal damages pursuant to Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of \n9  Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), and in all other respects in his official capacity only. \n10  20.  Defendants, and each of them, have historically professed to act in the \n11  capacity of parens patriae to detained children. Defendants, and each of them, thereby \n12  assume a legal obligation to act in such children’s best interests. Defendants breach \n13  this duty in pursuing the policies and practices challenged in this Complaint.  \n \n14  IV. \n15  NAMED PLAINTIFFS’ EXPERIENCES IN ORR CUSTODY \n16  A.  Lucas R. \n17  21.  On or about February 12, 2018, ORR assumed custody of Plaintiff Lucas \n18  R. after he arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border. ORR placed him at the Hacienda del Sol \n19  facility in Youngtown, Arizona. Within approximately ten days, Madelyn R., Lucas’ \n20  adult sister and Next Friend, requested Lucas’ custody and delivered to ORR a family \n21  reunification packet with the required documentation. Many years ago, Lucas and \n22  Madelyn’s father abandoned them; their mother died when Lucas was approximately \n23  two years old. Thereafter, Madelyn and an aunt raised Lucas in his parents’ stead. \n24  Madelyn and Lucas have a very close relationship. Over the next six weeks or so, ORR \n25  assured Madelyn that everything was in order and that it would soon release Lucas to \n26  her custody; it did not.  \n27  22.  According to Madelyn, in Guatemala, Lucas was a thriving, happy child \n28  who liked to joke, play, and talk with people. When he arrived at Hacienda del Sol, \nCenter for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \nComplaint  8.  256 S. Occidental Blvd. \nLos Angeles, CA 90057 \n213/388-8693 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 1   Filed 06/29/18   Page 11 of 43   Page ID #:11\n \n1  facility staff noted that Lucas appeared cooperative, calm, and alert, and showed “no \n2  behavioral concerns.”  \n3  23.  As his confinement wore on, however, Lucas became depressed, fearing \n4  that  ORR  would  never  release  him  to  his  family.  Without  obtaining  Madelyn’s \n5  informed consent, the informed consent of any other adult family member, or judicial \n6  authorization,  ORR  administered  Lucas  psychotropic  drugs,  ostensibly  to  control \n7  “moderate” depression.  Upon information and belief, ORR did not involve a neutral \n8  decision  maker  in  the  initial  determination  of  whether  to  prescribe  psychotropic \n9  medications to Lucas or in ongoing reviews of those medications.  \n10  24.  The medications caused Lucas stomach pain, and he refused to continue \n11  taking them. On or about May 21, 2018, ORR transferred Lucas to Shiloh RTC in \n12  Manvel, Texas, without affording him notice, an opportunity to be heard, or a right to \n13  appeal. ORR led Madelyn to believe Shiloh RTC was simply another shelter to which \n \n14  it was sending Lucas because Hacienda del Sol lacked space. ORR did not inform \n15  Madelyn that Shiloh RTC is a psychiatric institution, that it had administered Lucas \n16  psychotropic drugs at the Hacienda del Sol facility, that he was being transferred to \n17  Shiloh RTC for mental health reasons, or that Lucas would be required to take more \n18  psychotropic drugs at Shiloh RTC.  \n19  25.  Approximately six weeks after Madelyn had requested Lucas’ custody, \n20  ORR sent an investigator to Madelyn’s home in Los Angeles, California. Living with \n21  Madelyn then and now are her infant daughter, adult brother, and an unrelated female \n22  roommate and her child. At the time the investigator arrived, Madelyn’s roommate’s \n23  brother was visiting.  \n24  26.  The investigator indicated to Madelyn that her home was suitable, but \n25  that all adults who reside with her would have to appear for fingerprinting, including \n26  her roommate’s brother. Madelyn advised the investigator that her roommate’s brother \n27  did not live in the home, but the investigator insisted that the visitor appear for \n28  fingerprinting regardless. All the adult residents of Madelyn’s home appeared for \nCenter for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \nComplaint  9.  256 S. Occidental Blvd. \nLos Angeles, CA 90057 \n213/388-8693 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 1   Filed 06/29/18   Page 12 of 43   Page ID #:12\n \n1  fingerprinting, but her roommate’s brother did not. Approximately one month later, \n2  ORR orally advised Madelyn that it would not release Lucas to her because her \n3  roommate’s  brother  had  failed  to  appear  for  fingerprinting.  ORR  represented  to \n4  Madelyn that its decision was final, and afforded neither Madelyn nor Lucas any \n5  hearing, right to administrative appeal, or other means to change its decision. ORR \n6  failed to provide Madelyn with a written decision or written explanation for denying \n7  her custody of Lucas.  Due to ORR’s actions and inactions, Lucas’ release has been \n8  unnecessarily delayed, and Lucas has not been placed in the least restrictive setting.   \n9  27.  Twelve-year-old Lucas remains detained at Shiloh RTC where he has \n10  been administered Zoloft. Zoloft’s side-effects include rigidity in the muscles, high \n11  fever,  sweating,  confusion,  agitation,  hallucinations,  overactive  reflexes,  tremors, \n12  nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, fainting, and seizures. \n13  28.  Shiloh personnel have now diagnosed Lucas  with “major depressive \n \n14  disorder.” Among Lucas’ “major stressors,” Shiloh personnel identify his “[b]eing \n15  kept from family and in ORR custody.” Shiloh staff have nonetheless told Lucas that \n16  ORR will not release him until Shiloh medical personnel declare him psychologically \n17  sound.  \n18  29.  ORR has provided Lucas no legal counsel to represent him with respect \n19  to release, the administration of psychotropic medications, or placement at Shiloh. \n20  B.  Daniela Marisol T. \n21  30.  On or about August 3, 2017, Plaintiff Daniela Marisol T., a partially deaf \n22  sixteen-year-old girl, arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border with her older sister, Katherine \n23  L., and her nephew.  Daniela Marisol, Katherine, and her younger nephew fled from \n24  their home country in fear for their lives. At the border, Daniela Marisol was forcibly \n25  separated  from  her  sister  and  nephew  and  placed  in  the  custody of  ORR  at  the \n26  International Education Service Norma Linda Shelter in Los Fresnos, Texas. Daniela \n27  Marisol and Katherine are very close, and Daniela Marisol views Katherine as a \n28  second mother. Daniela Marisol was so emotionally traumatized by the separation that \nCenter for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \nComplaint  10.  256 S. Occidental Blvd. \nLos Angeles, CA 90057 \n213/388-8693 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 1   Filed 06/29/18   Page 13 of 43   Page ID #:13\n \n1  she was later admitted to a psychiatric hospital to cope with the trauma. The screening \n2  physician also recommended treatment for Daniela Marisol’s hearing disability once \n3  she was released to her sister—a release that, eleven months later, has yet to come to \n4  fruition. \n5  31.  Katherine and her son, detained separately from Daniela Marisol, were \n6  released from immigration custody after they proved to an Asylum Officer that they \n7  have a credible fear of persecution should they be returned to Honduras. Upon release, \n8  Katherine applied to become Daniela Marisol’s custodian and have ORR release \n9  Daniela Marisol to her custody. However, ORR has placed arbitrary, expensive, and \n10  excessive conditions on Daniela Marisol’s release, which Katherine has not been able \n11  to meet. \n12  32.  According to Katherine, when Daniela Marisol lived in Honduras with \n13  her family, she did not seem to have mental health issues. However, Daniela Marisol’s \n \n14  psychological state rapidly deteriorated after her family separation. It was further \n15  exacerbated when caseworkers told Daniela Marisol that she was not going to be \n16  released to her sister. Daniela Marisol lost hope that she would ever be released to her \n17  family. Depressed and suicidal, she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital where she \n18  suffered a psychotic breakdown.  \n19  33.  While Daniela Marisol was detained at the Norma Linda shelter, a doctor \n20  recognized that she was deaf in one ear. ORR declined to treat her deafness and instead \n21  noted that she should consult a specialist regarding her deafness “once [she was] \n22  reunified  with  family.”   Months  later,  when  she  was  at  a  new  facility,  it  was \n23  recommended she receive hearing aids, but to date, Daniela Marisol has not received \n24  them. \n25  34.  After her breakdown, on or about September 8, 2017, ORR transferred \n26  Daniela Marisol to Shiloh RTC in Manvel, Texas, without affording her notice, an \n27  opportunity to be heard or a right to appeal. At Shiloh, Daniela Marisol’s hearing \n28  disability went untreated. \nCenter for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \nComplaint  11.  256 S.

Without obtaining the informed consent of Daniela Marisol’s mother, \n2  Katherine, other family members, or court authorization, ORR administered numerous \n3  psychotropic medications to Daniela Marisol, including atypical antipsychotics and \n4  antidepressants, starting when she was in the Norma Linda shelter, and continuing \n5  while she was at Shiloh RTC and the David and Margaret shelter in La Verne, \n6  California,  and  through  her  present  placement,  Bethany  Christian  Services  in \n7  Michigan. In the approximately ten months that she has been in ORR custody, Daniela \n8  Marisol has been given multiple psychotropic medications, including Prozac, Abilify, \n9  Clonidine, Risperdal, Seroquel, and Zyprexa. While in ORR custody, Daniela Marisol \n10  has been the subject of numerous, changing diagnoses, including “Bipolar disorder, \n11  MRE, Mixed, with psychosis, GAD, PTSD;” “major depressive disorder, recurrent \n12  episode, severe with mood-congruent psychotic features;” and “bipolar II disorder, \n13  generalized anxiety disorder, PTSD.” Upon information and belief, ORR did not \n \n14  involve a neutral decision maker in the initial determination of whether to prescribe \n15  psychotropic  medications  to  Daniela  Marisol  or  in  ongoing  reviews  of  those \n16  medications.  \n17  36.  As recognized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), \n18  antidepressants  such  as  those  prescribed  to  Daniela  Marisol  “increase[]  the  risk \n19  compared  to  placebo  of  suicidal  thinking  and  behavior  (suicidality)  in  children, \n20  adolescents, and young adults in short term studies of major depressive disorder \n21  (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders.” ORR has frequently given Daniela Marisol \n22  an  atypical  antipsychotic  and  an  antidepressant  in  combination.  Research \n23  demonstrates that the number and severity of side effects, such as thoughts of suicide \n24  and  intentional  self-harm,  increases  as  the  number  of  concurrent  medications \n25  increases.  Daniela  Marisol  has  become  suicidal  while  being  made  to  take  such \n26  antidepressants and drug combinations. \n27  37.  Daniela Marisol believes that she has to take the medicine because facility \n28  staff have told her that she must in order to be released from government custody. \nCenter for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \nComplaint  12.  256 S. Occidental Blvd. \nLos Angeles, CA 90057 \n213/388-8693 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 1   Filed 06/29/18   Page 15 of 43   Page ID #:15\n \n1  38.  Katherine desperately wants to provide her younger sister a loving and \n2  safe home, and she has done everything in her power to have Daniela Marisol released \n3  to her care. However, ORR has told Katherine that, in order for Daniela Marisol to be \n4  released to her care, Katherine must move to a new house, have a separate private \n5  bedroom for Daniela Marisol, and prove that she can pay over $500 per month for \n6  Daniela Marisol’s medical care. Katherine has been unable to meet ORR’s arduous \n7  and arbitrary demands. ORR never provided Katherine with a written decision or \n8  written explanation for denying her custody of Daniela Marisol.  It represented to her \n9  that the requirements that it set and its decision were final, and it never afforded \n10  Katherine or Daniela Marisol any hearing, right to administrative appeal, or other \n11  means to change its decision.  Due to ORR’s actions and inactions, Daniela Marisol’s \n12  release has been unnecessarily delayed, and she has not been placed in the least \n13  restrictive setting.  \n \n14  39.  Daniela Marisol remains in government custody, away from her sister \n15  and other family.  ORR has given her no legal counsel to represent her with respect to \n16  release, administration of psychotropic medications, or her placement. \n17  C.  Miguel Angel S. \n18  40.  On or about May 16, 2017, ORR assumed custody of Plaintiff Miguel \n19  Angel after he arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border.  ORR placed him at the Southwest \n20  Key shelter in southern California.  The staff initially told Miguel Angel that he would \n21  be released to Gerardo S., his father and next friend, within three months.  \n22  41.  As Miguel’s time in detention wore on, he felt anxious at the shelter and \n23  often feared he would never be released.  On July 17, 2017, ORR transferred Miguel \n24  Angel to Shiloh RTC in Texas, without affording him notice, an opportunity to be \n25  heard  or  a  right  to  appeal.    At  Shiloh,  Miguel  Angel  was  administered  several \n26  psychotropic medications, including Remeron, Trazadone, Seroquel, and Lexapro.  \n27  Side effects of these medications include stomach pain, dizziness, nausea, drowsiness, \n28  unusual weight gain, blurred vision, and insomnia.   \nCenter for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \nComplaint  13.  256 S. Occidental Blvd. \nLos Angeles, CA 90057 \n213/388-8693 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 1   Filed 06/29/18   Page 16 of 43   Page ID #:16\n \n1  42.    Miguel Angel objected to taking the medications because they made him \n2  feel itchy, dizzy, aggressive, nauseous, and caused him to gain an unusual amount of \n3  weight in a short period of time. Shiloh staff insisted that he take the medication. Upon \n4  information and belief, the staff at Shiloh administered these medications to Miguel \n5  Angel without obtaining Gerardo’s informed consent or judicial authorization.   \n6  43.  Upon information and belief, ORR did not involve a neutral decision \n7  maker in the initial determination of whether to prescribe psychotropic medications to \n8  Miguel Angel or in ongoing review of those medications. \n9  44.  While  Miguel  Angel  was  detained  at  Shiloh,  several  staff  members \n10  physically assaulted him multiple times. During one incident, a staff member placed \n11  Miguel Angel in a headlock, painfully ripping Miguel Angel’s earring out of his \n12  earlobe. A physician’s assistant watched this, but did nothing to stop the attack. Miguel \n13  Angel reported the incident immediately to the facility doctor, but the doctor laughed \n \n14  and did nothing. Another time, two Shiloh staff members picked Miguel Angel up by \n15  his arms and pushed him up against a wall. One of the staff members pressed his \n16  forearm across Miguel Angel’s throat, making it hard for him to breathe.  Upon \n17  information  and  belief,  when  Miguel  Angel  reported  the  incidents  to  staff,  no \n18  disciplinary action was taken.  \n19  45.  In March 2018, shortly after these assaults took place, ORR transferred \n20  Miguel Angel to Yolo Juvenile Detention Center, affording him neither notice nor \n21  opportunity to be heard. Upon information and belief, Miguel Angel was transferred \n22  to Yolo in retaliation for reporting the assaults.  \n23  46.  At Yolo, facility staff attacked Miguel Angel with pepper spray, and he \n24  fears they will do it again. On one occasion, after Miguel Angel had been pepper \n25  sprayed by staff in his eyes and ears, he had to use water from the toilet in his cell to \n26  wash out his eyes because staff cut off water to his sink. The pepper spray made his \n27  eyes feel like they were on fire, and he lost hearing in one ear for several days. Miguel \n28  Angel spends most of his time at Yolo locked in a small cell and is only allowed out \nCenter for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \nComplaint  14.  256 S. Occidental Blvd. \nLos Angeles, CA 90057 \n213/388-8693 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 1   Filed 06/29/18   Page 17 of 43   Page ID #:17\n \n1  for short periods, which makes him feel trapped and tortured.  \n2  47.  Miguel Angel’s father, Gerardo, applied to be Miguel Angel’s sponsor \n3  around October 2017. Miguel Angel and Gerardo have a very close relationship, and \n4  Miguel Angel wants to live with him. Gerardo lives in an apartment with his brother, \n5  and in October 2017 both Gerardo and his brother submitted all required documents \n6  to  ORR,  including  birth  certificates  and  fingerprints.  ORR  also  requested  that \n7  Gerardo’s neighbor, who lives across the hallway, submit the same information. The \n8  neighbor submitted this information in October 2017.  \n9  48.  In December 2017, a home investigator visited Gerardo’s apartment to \n10  perform  a  home  study.  The  home  study  went  well,  and  the  investigator  assured \n11  Gerardo that Miguel Angel would probably be released in the first few weeks of \n12  January. Gerardo heard nothing from ORR or Miguel Angel’s case workers throughout \n13  January or February 2018. \n \n14  49.  In March 2018, Gerardo was told that the Shiloh doctors would not \n15  approve Miguel Angel for release and that he would remain in ORR custody until they \n16  do. In early May 2018, Miguel Angel’s case worker at Yolo told Gerardo that he \n17  needed to provide proof of school enrollment and the name of a psychiatric clinic in \n18  order for Miguel Angel to be released. Gerardo has tried his best to comply with these \n19  requirements, but the local school requires Miguel Angel to be physically present in \n20  order to be enrolled, and Gerardo has been unable to find a psychiatric clinic that will \n21  give Miguel Angel an appointment. In late May 2018, Miguel Angel’s case worker \n22  told Gerardo that his fingerprints had expired, and that Gerardo, his brother, and his \n23  neighbor would need to submit their fingerprints again. \n24  50.  ORR has refused to release Miguel Angel to Gerardo’s custody for eight \n25  months. ORR has not provided Miguel Angel or Gerardo with written notification of \n26  its refusal to release Miguel Angel or the basis for the refusal, or an opportunity to \n27  review the underlying evidence or appeal ORR’s refusal to release Miguel Angel to \n28  his father. Due to ORR’s actions and inactions, Miguel Angel’s release has been \nCenter for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \nComplaint  15.  256 S. Occidental Blvd. \nLos Angeles, CA 90057 \n213/388-8693 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 1   Filed 06/29/18   Page 18 of 43   Page ID #:18\n \n1  unnecessarily delayed and he has not been placed in the least restrictive setting.  \n2  D.  Gabriela N. \n3  51.  On or about January 8, 2017, ORR assumed custody of Plaintiff Gabriela \n4  N., shortly after she had turned herself in at the U.S.-Mexico border. As a young girl \n5  living in El Salvador, Gabriela experienced extreme violence and did not feel safe at \n6  home. ORR placed her at the Southwest Key Casita del Valle facility (“Casita del \n7  Valle shelter”) in Clint, Texas. In the fall of 2017, Isaac N., Gabriela’s grandfather and \n8  Next Friend, requested Gabriela’s custody and submitted an application to serve as her \n9  custodian. Gabriela’s mother appeared before a U.S. Consular official in El Salvador \n10  to execute a formal designation pursuant to Paragraph 14D of the Flores settlement \n11  directing ORR to release Gabriela to her grandfather.  \n12  52.  Gabriela’s biological father is deceased, and her stepfather physically \n13  abused her mother and disabled sister who suffers from paralysis from the abuse and \n \n14  can no longer to speak. Thus, Gabriela fled to the U.S. seeking safety, with the hope \n15  of living with her grandfather. Gabriela and her grandfather, Isaac, have a close \n16  relationship, and she wants to live with him. Over the next eight months or so, Isaac \n17  continued to submit documents that ORR requested and completed a home study in \n18  anticipation that ORR would release Gabriela to his custody; it did not. \n19  53.  According  to  Isaac,  in  El  Salvador,  Gabriela  had  no  mental  health \n20  concerns, and she took no medications for mental illness. When she arrived at Casita \n21  del  Valle  shelter,  facility  staff  noted  that  Gabriela  appeared  emotionally  stable, \n22  receptive, and resilient.   \n23  54.  As her confinement wore on, however, Gabriela became depressed and \n24  anxious, fearing that ORR would never release her to her family. Without obtaining \n25  Isaac’s informed consent, the informed consent of any other adult family member, or \n26  judicial  authorization,  ORR  repeatedly  administered  Gabriela  psychotropic \n27  medications,  ostensibly  to  control  post-traumatic  stress  disorder,  anxiety,  major \n28  depressive disorder, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (“ADHD”).  \nCenter for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \nComplaint  16.  256 S. Occidental Blvd. \nLos Angeles, CA 90057 \n213/388-8693 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 1   Filed 06/29/18   Page 19 of 43   Page ID #:19\n \n1  55.  While at Casita del Valle shelter, Gabriela was administered Prozac, a \n2  psychotropic medication.  \n3  56.  On or about September 7, 2017, ORR transferred Gabriela to Shiloh RTC, \n4  without affording notice, an opportunity to be heard or a right to appeal. At Shiloh, \n5  ORR administered Gabriela more psychotropic medications, including Gabapentin, \n6  Prozac, and Bupropion, all of which include side effects of increased risk of suicidal \n7  ideation and behavior.  Bupropion is not FDA-approved to treat depression or ADHD \n8  in adolescents. Upon information and belief, ORR did not involve a neutral decision \n9  maker in the initial determination of whether to prescribe psychotropic medications to \n10  Gabriela or in ongoing review of those medications. \n11  57.  Gabriela does not believe the medications help her, and she does not want \n12  to take them. However, Gabriela believes that she must take the medications in order \n13  to be released from detention. Shiloh staff told Gabriela that ORR would not release \n \n14  her until Shiloh medical personnel declare her psychologically sound.  \n15  58.  In February 2018, ORR sent an investigator to Isaac’s home in Oakland, \n16  California,  where  he  lived,  and  continues  to  live,  alone.  Isaac  moved  to  a  new \n17  apartment and purchased a new bed for Gabriela in preparation for her release.   \n18  59.  The  investigator  indicated  to  Isaac  that  his  home  was  suitable,  but \n19  questioned Isaac’s ability to support Gabriela’s education and care for her financially. \n20  Isaac assured the investigator that he would do everything required to provide for \n21  Gabriela. Later, Gabriela’s social worker at Shiloh told Isaac that ORR was no longer \n22  considering  him  as  a  custodian  for  his  granddaughter  and  was  going  to  transfer \n23  Gabriela elsewhere. ORR afforded neither Isaac nor Gabriela any hearing, right to \n24  administrative appeal, or other means to change its decision. ORR failed to provide \n25  Isaac with a written decision or written explanation for denying him custody of \n26  Gabriela.  Due  to  ORR’s  actions  and  inactions,  Gabriela’s  release  has  been \n27  unnecessarily delayed and Gabriela has not been placed in the least restrictive setting.  \n28  60.  Seventeen-year-old Gabriela remains detained at St. Michael’s Home for \nCenter for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \nComplaint  17.  256 S. Occidental Blvd. \nLos Angeles, CA 90057 \n213/388-8693 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 1   Filed 06/29/18   Page 20 of 43   Page ID #:20\n \n1  Children, where she has been administered Prozac.  \n2  61.  After being detained for over one and a half years, Gabriela is miserable \n3  and desperately wants to live with her grandfather. Her grandfather is ready and eager \n4  to care for her. Shiloh staff have nonetheless told Gabriela that ORR will not release \n5  her to her grandfather. ORR has provided Gabriela no legal counsel to represent her \n6  with  respect  to  release,  the  administration  of  psychotropic  medications,  or  her \n7  placement at Shiloh. \n8  E.  Jaime D. \n9  62.  On or about April 8, 2018, ORR assumed custody of Plaintiff Jaime D. \n10  after he arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border with his 6-year-old sister and 10-year-old \n11  aunt. ORR placed Jaime and his younger sister and aunt at the Cayuga Centers shelter \n12  in Bronx, New York. On or about April 10, 2018, Reyna D., Jaime’s aunt and Next \n13  Friend, requested Jaime’s custody and submitted a family reunification packet to ORR. \n \n14  Reyna is Jaime’s only family in the United States. Jaime desperately wants to be \n15  released to Reyna’s care.  Jaime’s mother died when he was seven years old and, upon \n16  information and belief, his father died before he was born. Reyna discussed ORR’s \n17  requirements for becoming Jaime’s custodian in detail with Jaime’s case manager at \n18  Cayuga Centers and immediately began gathering the required documents to send to \n19  ORR.  \n20  63.  When Jaime was first sent to Cayuga Centers, the staff made him feel \n21  very nervous. Jaime was terrified that he would be forced to return to his home country, \n22  where his life had been threatened. He made up a story about his life in his home \n23  country, because he thought that this would make the shelter staff leave him alone. He \n24  later recanted this story multiple times. Despite the shelter recommending that Jaime \n25  be placed in a staff-secure facility, thirteen-year-old Jaime was transferred to a secure \n26  facility.  \n27  64.  On or about April 18, 2018, ORR transferred Jaime to Yolo County \n28  Juvenile Detention Center in Woodland, California. ORR transferred Jaime to Yolo \nCenter for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \nComplaint  18.  256 S.

He was \n2  awakened at 4:00 in the morning and restrained with heavy shackles throughout the \n3  cross-country flight from New York to California. Jaime was not allowed to say \n4  goodbye to his younger sister or aunt.  He was extremely worried they would think he \n5  had abandoned them.  \n6  65.  Yolo staff first contacted Reyna regarding her application for Jaime’s \n7  custody about a week after Jaime arrived at Yolo. Approximately two weeks later, \n8  Jaime’s case manager noted that Reyna had “provided all that [had] been asked of \n9  her,” including a complete family reunification packet and fingerprints. In late May \n10  2018, Reyna completed a home study and interview with a home investigator. ORR \n11  found Reyna a suitable custodian for Jaime’s younger sister and aunt. ORR released \n12  the two girls to Reyna’s care on or about June 8, 2018. \n13  66.  While detained at Yolo, Jaime was very scared for his safety and suffered \n \n14  from anxiety. Reyna was extremely concerned for his well-being as well, as Jaime \n15  sounded increasingly sad and scared during their phone calls. Throughout his time at \n16  Yolo, Jaime suffered physical abuse at the hands of older youth in the facility. Jaime \n17  alerted facility staff of the abuse, but staff ignored his concerns and said they did not \n18  believe him. \n19  67.  Two weeks after he was transferred to Yolo, Jaime’s case manager noted \n20  that the Yolo staff were “all in agreement that [Jaime] isn’t appropriately placed in a \n21  secure setting.” Jaime was told by his case worker that he was too young to be at Yolo \n22  and  would  hopefully  be  transferred  soon.  However,  Jaime  remained  at  Yolo  for \n23  another three weeks. On or about May 24, 2018, ORR transferred Jaime to Children’s \n24  Village staff secure facility in Dobbs Ferry, New York. \n25  68.  Thirteen-year-old Jaime remains detained at Children’s Village, where he \n26  is increasingly anxious and worried that he will never be released to his aunt’s care. \n27  As of the filing of this Complaint, Reyna has not heard from Jaime’s case worker at \n28  Children’s Village for over a month. Reyna has not been given any information about \nCenter for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \nComplaint  19.  256 S.

ORR has not provided Jaime or Reyna \n2  with written notification of its refusal to release Jaime or the basis for the refusal, or \n3  an opportunity to review the underlying evidence or appeal ORR’s refusal to release \n4  Jaime to his aunt. Due to ORR’s actions and inactions, Jaime’s release has been \n5  unnecessarily delayed and Jaime has not been placed in the least restrictive setting.  \n6  69.  ORR has provided Jaime no legal counsel to represent him with respect \n7  to release or his placement at Children’s Village.  \n8  V. \n9  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n10  70.  The named Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \n11  Procedure 23(a) and (b)(2) on behalf of themselves and the following similarly situated \n12  proposed class members:  \n13  All  children  in  ORR  custody  pursuant  to  6  U.S.C.  §  279  and/or  8  U.S.C. \n \n14  § 1232 — \n15  (a)  whom ORR refuses to release to parents or other available custodians \n16  within thirty days of the proposed custodian’s submitting a complete \n17  family reunification packet on the ground that the proposed custodian is \n18  or may be unfit;  \n19  (b)  who have been, are or will be placed in a secure facility, medium-secure \n20  facility, or RTC, or continued in any such facility for more than thirty \n21  days, without being afforded notice and an opportunity to be heard before \n22  a neutral and detached decisionmaker regarding the grounds for such \n23  placement; or \n24  (c)  who have been or will be administered psychotropic medication without \n25  procedural safeguards, including obtaining informed consent or court \n26  authorization  prior  to  medicating  a  child,  involving  a  neutral \n27  decisionmaker  in  the  initial  determination  of  whether  to  prescribe \n28  psychotropics  to  a  child  in  ORR  custody,  and  involving  a  neutral \nCenter for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \nComplaint  20.  256 S.

The exact size of the proposed class is unknown, but likely includes \n8  hundreds of children. The size of the class is so numerous that joinder of all members \n9  is impracticable.  \n10  72.  The claims of Plaintiffs and those of the proposed class members raise \n11  common questions of law and fact concerning whether Defendants’ policies and \n12  practices relating to the release, placement, treatment, and legal representation of \n13  detained immigrant children are consistent with the Flores Settlement, § 235 of the \n \n14  TVPRA,  the  Fifth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution,  and  the  First \n15  Amendment of the Constitution. These questions are common to the named Plaintiffs \n16  and the members of the proposed class because Defendants have acted and will \n17  continue  to  act  on  grounds  generally  applicable  to  the  named  Plaintiffs  and  the \n18  proposed class members. Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the class’s claims. \n19  73.  The  prosecution  of  separate  actions  by  individual  members  of  the \n20  proposed class would create a risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications establishing \n21  incompatible  standards  of  conduct  for  Defendants.  Proposed  class  members  are \n22  predominantly indigent, non-English-speaking children who are being denied basic \n23  fairness in ORR’s prolonging their detention in lieu of releasing them to parents or \n24  other proposed custodians, “stepped up” to RTC, secure or staff-secure placement \n25  without notice or opportunity to be heard, and administered psychotropic medications \n26  without a parent’s informed consent. The proposed class members are under ORR’s \n27  exclusive physical control and often understand little, if anything, about their rights \n28  under the Flores Settlement, the TVPRA, or the Constitution. ORR actively obstructs \nCenter for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \nComplaint  21.  256 S.

Unless this matter proceeds as a class action, the \n3  majority of class members have little chance of securing judicial review of the policies \n4  and practices challenged herein. \n5  74.  Defendants, their agents, employees, and predecessors and successors in \n6  office have acted or refused to act, and will continue to act or refuse to act, on grounds \n7  generally applicable to the class, thereby making injunctive relief and corresponding \n8  declaratory relief appropriate with respect to the class as a whole. Plaintiffs will \n9  vigorously represent the interests of unnamed class members. All members of the \n10  proposed class will benefit by this action. The interests of the named Plaintiffs and \n11  those of the proposed class members are identical.   \n12  75.  Plaintiffs  are  represented  by  experienced  and  reputable  lawyers \n13  associated with non-profit public interest law firms and an international law firm \n \n14  serving  pro  bono  publico.  Plaintiffs’  counsel  includes  attorneys  with  years  of \n15  experience litigating complex suits and class actions on behalf of children and foreign \n16  nationals, including counsel for the plaintiff class in Flores v. Sessions. \n17  VI. \n18  ORR POLICY & PRACTICE VIOLATES DUE PROCESS \n19  A.  Defendants have violated Plaintiffs’ due process and family association rights, \n20  the TVPRA, and the Flores Settlement in determining custodians’ fitness. \n21  76.  When children are held in government custody apart from their primary \n22  caregivers  for  long  periods,  they  suffer  profound  and  long-lasting  injury.  The \n23  American Academy of Pediatrics has explained that “highly stressful experiences, like \n24  family separation, can cause irreparable harm, disrupting a child’s brain architecture \n25  and affecting his or her short- and long-term health. This type of prolonged exposure \n26  to  serious  stress—known  as  toxic  stress—can  carry  lifelong  consequences  for \n27  children.” Toxic stress is associated with increased rates of mental health issues, risky \n28  health behaviors, and physical illness such as diabetes, cancer, posttraumatic stress \nCenter for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \nComplaint  22.  256 S.

Studies of immigrant children detained in the \n2  United States have discovered high rates of PTSD, anxiety, depression, and suicidal \n3  ideation. A primary factor in recovering from such trauma is reunification with a \n4  parent or other trusted adult. Without the presence of trusted caregivers, children are \n5  often  unable  to  cope  with  the  psychological  trauma  and  stress  associated  with \n6  detention. \n7  77.  Paragraph 14 of the Flores Settlement requires ORR to release children \n8  from  immigration-related  custody  “without  unnecessary  delay”  so  long  as  their \n9  continued detention is not required to secure availability for removal or to protect \n10  safety. Paragraph 18 of the Settlement requires ORR to make “prompt and continuous \n11  efforts” toward family reunifications and to release children to suitable custodians \n12  without unnecessary delay.  \n13  78.  Similarly,  §  235(c)(2)(A)  of  the  TVPRA,  codified  at  8  U.S.C. \n \n14  1232(c)(2)(A), requires ORR  to “promptly” place detained children “in the least \n15  restrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child,” generally, with “a suitable \n16  family member . . . .” TVPRA § 235(c)(3)(A) provides, “[A]n unaccompanied alien \n17  child may not be placed with a person or entity unless the Secretary of Health and \n18  Human Services makes a determination that the proposed custodian is capable of \n19  providing for the child’s physical and mental well-being.” \n20  79.  Paragraph 24A of the Flores Settlement guarantees detained children the \n21  right to a hearing during which an immigration judge reviews whether they may be \n22  continued in custody because they are dangerous or unusually likely to abscond. \n23  However, neither the Flores Settlement nor the TVPRA prescribe what process is due \n24  where ORR unreasonably prolongs a juvenile’s detention or refuses to release him or \n25  her because ORR questions whether an available parent or other potential custodian is \n26  capable of providing for the child’s physical and mental well-being.  \n27  80.  Plaintiffs have substantial liberty interests in being free from government \n28  custody, in preserving their family unity and the ability for their family to care for \nCenter for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \nComplaint  23.  256 S.

Defendants may not abridge these liberty interests \n2  without appropriate procedures to protect against erroneous deprivation. \n3  81.  Plaintiffs have a fundamental right to the supervision, companionship, \n4  and care of their parents. Absent a showing of parental unfitness, the government may \n5  not keep children from their parents or refuse to release children into the custody of \n6  their parents.  \n7  82.  As a matter of both policy and practice, ORR does not make prompt and \n8  continuous  efforts  toward  family  reunification  and  the  release  of  children  in  its \n9  custody. Instead, it delays or refuses to make determinations about whether proposed \n10  custodians are or may be unfit.    \n11  83.  As a matter of both policy and practice, ORR affords Plaintiffs and their \n12  proposed class members little or no procedural protection against prolonged detention \n13  on the ground that their parents or other proposed custodians are or may be unfit. \n \n14  ORR’s nominal procedures for vetting detained children’s parents or other proposed \n15  custodians do not appear in the Code of Federal Regulations, nor even in a semi-\n16  permanent  practice  manual.  Rather,  they  appear  on  ORR’s  web  page, \n17  www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/resource/children-entering-the-united-states-unaccompanied-\n18  section-2 (last visited June 29, 2018), and are subject to change without prior notice \n19  or opportunity for comment. Under its nominal procedures — \n20  (a)  ORR does not decide within any time certain whether a detained minor’s \n21  parent or other proposed custodian is suitable;  \n22  (b)  ORR does not provide a detained minor, or his or her parent or other \n23  proposed  custodian,  an  opportunity  to  inspect  or  rebut  evidence \n24  derogatory of the proposed custodian’s fitness;  \n25  (c)  ORR does not afford a detained minor or his or her proposed custodian a \n26  hearing before a neutral and detached decisionmaker either before or after \n27  ORR declares a potential custodian unfit;  \n28  (d)  Once ORR decides a proposed custodian is unsuitable, it need not inform \nCenter for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \nComplaint  24.  256 S.

Whether a parent or other custodian is qualified to care for a child is a \n \n14  matter generally committed to state and local governments. Plaintiffs are informed and \n15  believe that in all fifty states and their subdivisions, children may not be detained for \n16  want of a qualified custodian without affording them and/or their parents or other \n17  potential custodians a prompt hearing before a judge or other neutral and detached \n18  decisionmaker,  during  which  allegations  of  unfitness  are  tested  via  trial-like \n19  procedures and any ensuing finding of unsuitability must be based on competent \n20  evidence. \n21  85.  In contrast, in refusing to release Plaintiffs and those similarly situated to \n22  parents and other available custodians on grounds of fitness, ORR provides neither \n23  Plaintiffs nor those similarly situated — \n24  (a)  an evidentiary hearing;  \n25  (b)  the right to review or rebut adverse witnesses and evidence;   \n26  (c)  appointed counsel, guardians ad litem, or interpreters;  \n27  (d)  a finding of suitability or lack thereof by a neutral and detached decision-\n28  maker under defined and consistent legal standards;  \nCenter for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \nComplaint  25.  256 S.

In  practice,  ORR  often  refuses  to  decide  whether  a  detained  child’s \n4  proposed  custodian  is  fit,  thereby  needlessly  prolonging  detention  and  family \n5  separation. \n6  87.  On information and belief, Plaintiffs allege that, to date, HHS’s Assistant \n7  Secretary for Children and Families has never convened an actual hearing before a \n8  neutral arbiter to review a decision by ORR declaring a detained child’s proposed \n9  custodian unsuitable. \n10  88.  ORR’s procedures for determining whether parents and other proposed \n11  custodians are suitable creates an unreasonable risk that Plaintiffs and those similarly \n12  situated will be erroneously — \n13  (a)  subjected to prolonged detention; \n \n14  (b)  placed in overly restrictive settings that are not in their best interests;  \n15  (c)  administered psychotropic medications; and  \n16  (d)  separated from parents and family.  \n17  89.  As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of  ORR’s  torpid,  opaque,  and \n18  perfunctory procedures for declaring detained children’s parents and other proposed \n19  custodians unsuitable, Plaintiffs and those similarly situated have been and will be \n20  erroneously— \n21  (a)  subjected to prolonged detention; \n22  (b)  placed in overly restrictive settings that are not in their best interests;  \n23  (c)  administered psychotropic medications; and  \n24  (d)  separated from parents and family.  \n25  90.  The government’s refusing to release children to their parents’ custody, \n26  or to the custody of adult siblings and other family members, deprives plaintiffs of \n27  their fundamental rights without any reasonable justification or legitimate purpose, \n28  violates the substantive and procedural components of the Due Process Clause, and \nCenter for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \nComplaint  26.  256 S.

In prolonging the \n2  separation of children from their proposed custodians, Defendants also compromise \n3  the short and long-term health of Plaintiffs and those similarly situated.  \n4  B.  Defendants have violated Plaintiffs’ due process rights, the TVPRA, and the \n5  Flores Settlement by placing them in unlicensed placements. \n6  91.  Definition 6 and paragraph 19 of the Flores Settlement require ORR to \n7  place a detained child in a non-secure facility holding a state license to care for \n8  dependent children except in circumstances enumerated in Settlement paragraph 21: \n9  i.e., the child has committed a violent crime or non-petty delinquent act, has threatened \n10  violence during federal custody, is an unusual escape-risk, or is so disruptive that \n11  secure confinement is necessary to ensure the welfare of the minor or others. \n12  92.  Section 235(c)(2)(A) of the TVPRA similarly requires ORR to place \n13  detained children promptly “in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interest of \n \n14  the child . . .” and bars its placing a child “in a secure facility absent a determination \n15  that the child poses a danger to self or others or has been charged with having \n16  committed a criminal offense.”  \n17  93.  TVPRA § 235(c)(2)(A) provides, “The placement of a child in a secure \n18  facility shall be reviewed, at a minimum, on a monthly basis, in accordance with \n19  procedures  prescribed  by  the  Secretary,  to  determine  if  such  placement  remains \n20  warranted.” The TVPRA is otherwise silent with respect to what process is due when \n21  ORR places or continues a child in an RTC, medium-secure or secure facility.   \n22  94.  Federal law and policy recognize that both children and communities are \n23  better off when children are not needlessly incarcerated. A vast body of research has \n24  established that detaining children interferes with healthy development, exposes youth \n25  to abuse, undermines educational attainment, makes children with mental health needs \n26  worse off, and puts children at greater risk of self-harm. Juvenile detention facilities \n27  often respond to threats of self-harm in ways that further endanger youth, such as by \n28  placing  them  in  isolation.  Schooling  children  receive  during  detention  is  often \nCenter for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \nComplaint  27.  256 S. Occidental Blvd. \nLos Angeles, CA 90057 \n213/388-8693 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 1   Filed 06/29/18   Page 30 of 43   Page ID #:30\n \n1  substandard, which places them at serious disadvantage when they enter school after \n2  having  been  detained  for  substantial  periods.  Research  has  demonstrated  that \n3  incarceration also exacerbates pre-existing trauma.  \n4  95.  The vast majority of children who end up in secure custody through ORR \n5  have never been charged, let alone convicted, of crimes in the U.S. or in their home \n6  country. Often, ORR places the most vulnerable children—those with the greatest \n7  mental  health  needs—in  staff-secure,  secure  or  RTC  facilities.  Prolonging  the \n8  detention  of  children  with  mental  health  needs  in  such  facilities  is  profoundly \n9  injurious. ORR’s detaining children in such facilities exacerbates mental health issues \n10  to the point that ORR eventually consigns children to mental hospitals. \n11  96.  The Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause protects children’s freedom \n12  from unnecessary physical restraint, including placement in RTCs, medium-secure or \n13  secure  facilities.  ORR’s  placing  children  in  such  facilities  is  constrained  by  due \n \n14  process, which requires adequate procedural protections to ensure that ORR’s asserted \n15  justification  for  such  placement  outweighs  children’s  constitutionally  protected \n16  interest in avoiding excessive physical restraint. Due process requires that ORR give \n17  Plaintiffs and their proposed class members meaningful notice and an opportunity to \n18  be heard before it places them in RTCs, medium-secure or secure facilities and an \n19  ongoing review with commensurate protections every thirty days.   \n20  97.  As a matter of policy and practice, Defendant ORR affords detained \n21  children  wholly  inadequate  procedural  protection  against  erroneous  placement  in \n22  RTCs, secure or medium-secure facilities. ORR’s procedures for initially placing a \n23  child in an RTC, secure or medium-secure facility and for periodically reviewing the \n24  need for such placements appear nowhere in the Code of Federal Regulations. Rather, \n25  they appear on ORR’s web page and are subject to change without prior notice or \n26  opportunity for public comment.  \n27  98.  In practice, ORR’s placing children in RTCs, secure or medium-secure \n28  facilities results from an opaque and peremptory process in which youth are summarily \nCenter for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \nComplaint  28.  256 S.

In placing children in RTCs, secure and medium-secure facilities, ORR \n4  provides neither Plaintiffs nor those similarly situated — \n5  (a)  an evidentiary hearing;  \n6  (b)  notice of the placement decision or individualized reasoning therefor; \n7  (c)  an opportunity to present evidence and witnesses; \n8  (d)  the right to a neutral adjudicator; \n9  (e)  an opportunity to review or rebut adverse witnesses and evidence;   \n10  (f)  the right to counsel, guardians ad litem, or interpreters;  \n11  (g)  a finding of dangerousness or other adequate cause for such placement \n12  under coherent and consistent legal standards; \n13  (h)  the right to appeal administratively from adverse decisions; or  \n \n14  (i)  a monthly review of whether their placement in RTCs, medium-secure, \n15  or secure facilities remains warranted. \n16  99.  Pursuant to paragraph 24A of the Flores Settlement and orders issued by \n17  the District Court for the Central District of California, immigration judges may \n18  review ORR’s decisions to continue detaining children in federal custody on grounds \n19  they are dangerous or unusual flight-risks. ORR regularly places children in RTCs, \n20  secure and medium-secure facilities on the ground that they are dangerous or unusual \n21  flight-risks, contrary to immigration judges’ determinations that they are neither.  \n22  100.  Plaintiffs  are  informed  and  believe  that  in  all  fifty  states  and  their \n23  subdivisions, it is unlawful to place  children in RTCs, secure or medium-secure \n24  facilities without affording them a prompt and meaningful opportunity to be heard \n25  before  a  neutral  and  detached  decisionmaker  regarding  the  grounds  for  such \n26  placement.  \n27  101.

As a direct and proximate result of ORR’s \n4  peremptorily  consigning  children  to  RTCs,  secure  and  medium-secure  facilities, \n5  Plaintiffs and their proposed class members have been and are being erroneously: \n6  (a) placed in restrictive settings against their best interests; (b) subjected to excessive \n7  restrictions on their personal liberty; and (c) subjected to the trauma and stigma of \n8  imprisonment. \n9  102.  Placement in RTCs, secure and medium-secure facilities further injures \n10  Plaintiffs and those similarly situated because ORR, as a matter of policy and practice, \n11  delays release to parents and other reputable custodians of youth whom it has ever \n12  confined  in  such  facilities,  even  when  such  placement  is  based  on  incomplete, \n13  inaccurate, or erroneous evidence, and even if ORR subsequently transfers a child to \n \n14  a non-secure dependent care facility.  \n15  103.  As a matter of policy and practice, ORR refuses to release children whom \n16  it has ever placed in a secure or medium-secure facility until and unless its director or \n17  his  designee  approves  release.  In  practice,  this  policy  prolongs  non-dangerous \n18  children’s  detention  for  weeks  or  months  notwithstanding  that  parents  or  other \n19  reputable custodians are available to care for them. \n20  104.  As a matter of policy and practice, ORR refuses to release children whom \n21  it has placed in RTCs until and unless RTC medical personnel declare the child \n22  mentally fit. ORR affords children no hearing or other meaningful procedural recourse \n23  when RTC medical personnel refuse to declare them mentally fit. As a direct and \n24  proximate result of said policy and practice, children placed in RTCs suffer the \n25  functional equivalent of indefinite civil commitment without due process of law. \n26  105.  On information and belief, Plaintiffs further allege that ORR regularly \n27  insists that the parents and other potential custodians possess novel and superfluous \n28  qualifications to receive custody of children whom ORR has ever placed in an RTC, \nCenter for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \nComplaint  30.  256 S.

Such  qualifications  include  being  cancer-free, \n2  having  income  sufficient  to  supply  released  children  with  psychotropic  drugs, \n3  repetitive fingerprinting, and supplying fingerprints of third parties who do not reside \n4  in the proposed custodian’s home. As a direct and proximate result of said policy and \n5  practice, children placed in RTCs, secure and medium-secure facilities have been and \n6  are being erroneously: (a) placed in restrictive settings against their best interests; and \n7  (b) subjected to excessive restrictions on their personal liberty. \n8  C.  Defendants have subjected Plaintiffs to the administration of psychotropic drugs \n9  without having procedural safeguards in place, including obtaining informed \n10  consent. \n11  106.  Paragraph 7 of the Flores Settlement provides in pertinent part: “The INS \n12  shall assess minors to determine if they have special needs ….” A child may have \n13  special needs “due to drug or alcohol abuse, serious emotional disturbance, mental \n \n14  illness or retardation, or a physical condition or chronic illness that requires special \n15  services or treatment.” Paragraph 12 of the Flores Settlement provides in pertinent \n16  part: “Following arrest, the INS shall hold minors in facilities that are safe and sanitary \n17  and that are consistent with the INS’s concern for the particular vulnerability of \n18  minors.” The Flores Settlement further provides that facilities in which ORR places \n19  children with mental health needs must “meet those standards . . . set forth in Exhibit \n20  1.” Settlement ¶¶ 6, 8. Exhibit 1 requires that licensed programs “comply with all \n21  applicable state child welfare laws and regulations . . . and shall provide or arrange for \n22  the following services for each minor in its care: . . . appropriate mental health \n23  interventions when necessary.” \n24  107.  Section 235(c)(2) of the TVPRA requires ORR to provide children in its \n25  custody with safe and secure placements.  Placements that involve the unnecessary or \n26  coerced administration of psychotropic medications are neither “safe” nor “secure.” \n27  108.  The Flores Settlement incorporates by reference relevant law of the state \n28  in which children are placed and thereby requires ORR to comply with applicable child \nCenter for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \nComplaint  31.  256 S.

Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and on such \n3  basis allege, that the laws of all states in which ORR places Plaintiffs and those \n4  similarly  situated require ORR to obtain informed parental consent or its lawful \n5  equivalent when administering psychotropic medications to minors. \n6  109.  For  example,  Texas  Administrative  Code  sections  748.2001(b), \n7  748.2253, 748.2255 require informed consent be provided prior to administering \n8  psychotropic drugs to children in state custody.  Texas Family Code section 266.004(a) \n9  provides that before children in the care of the Texas Department of Family and \n10  Protective Services may receive medical care, someone authorized by a court must \n11  provide consent.  \n12  110.  Similarly, California Welfare and Institutions Code sections 369.5(a)(1) \n13  and  739.5(a)(1)  provide  that  only  a  juvenile  court  may  lawfully  authorize  the \n \n14  administration of psychotropic medication to children who are in state custody, unless \n15  the juvenile court specifically authorizes a parent to do so after making specific \n16  findings regarding the parent’s fitness and capacity to do so.  \n17  111.  Plaintiffs and their proposed class members have a substantial liberty \n18  interest protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment in being free \n19  from the unauthorized and unnecessary administration of psychotropic medications.  \n20  Plaintiffs  are  entitled  to  constitutionally  sufficient  procedures  to  protect  against \n21  erroneous deprivation of this interest. \n22  112.  Psychotropic  medications  are  powerful  drugs  that  act  on  the  central \n23  nervous system and affect cognition, emotions, and behavior. Such drugs should only \n24  be administered in combination with other mental health supports to treat specifically \n25  diagnosed  psychiatric  illnesses  and  mental  health  disorders.  Few  psychotropic \n26  medications have been approved by the FDA as safe and effective to treat children, \n27  and careful oversight and monitoring is accordingly required when children are given \n28  such drugs. Such medications should not be used as chemical straitjackets to control \nCenter for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \nComplaint  32.  256 S.

Serious, long-lasting adverse effects are common for individuals given \n3  psychotropic medications. The full risks of giving such drugs to children are not well \n4  understood,  although  psychotropics  are  known  to  cause  serious  and  sometimes \n5  irreversible side effects in adults, including psychosis, seizures, movement disorders, \n6  suicidal ideation, aggression, extreme weight gain, and organ damage. Increasing the \n7  number of psychotropic drugs children take concurrently increases the likelihood of \n8  adverse reactions and long-term side effects. Close and continuing scrutiny of children \n9  given such medications is therefore critical.  \n10  114.  As a matter of policy and practice, ORR authorizes and condones the \n11  administration  of  psychotropic  drugs  to  children  entirely  without  procedural \n12  safeguards, including informed parental consent. Rather, ORR authorizes detention \n13  facility staff to “consent” to the involuntary, long-term administration of psychotropic \n \n14  drugs to juveniles in their parents’ stead, even when such parents are readily available \n15  to ORR and/or the detention facility to give or withhold such consent.  \n16  115.  As  a  matter  of  policy  and  practice,  ORR  also  fails  to  provide  any \n17  substantial procedural safeguards against unnecessary or unauthorized administration \n18  of psychotropic drugs to children in its custody. At a minimum, such safeguards must \n19  include  a  neutral  decisionmaker’s  approval  of  the  initial  decision  to  administer \n20  psychotropics to a child, as well as periodic reviews to ensure that youth are not \n21  administered psychotropic medications unnecessarily, for too long, at harmful dosages \n22  or in harmful combinations.  \n23  116.  On information and belief, Plaintiffs allege that ORR failed to have any \n24  of  these  procedural  safeguards  in  place  prior  to  administering  psychotropic \n25  medications  to  the  named  Plaintiffs.  In  addition,  the  psychiatrist  who  currently \n26  prescribes psychotropic medications to children at ORR’s Shiloh RTC, Dr. Javier \n27  Ruíz-Nazario,  is  not  certified  by  the  Texas  Medical  Board  to  treat  children  and \n28  adolescents.

Paragraph 24A of the Flores Settlement requires ORR to give detained \n4  children a hearing before an immigration judge to review whether they are dangerous \n5  or  likely  to  abscond.  Settlement  paragraph  24D  provides  that  Defendants  must \n6  “promptly provide each minor not released with . . . the list of free legal services \n7  providers compiled pursuant to INS regulation . . . .” Exhibit 1, paragraph 14 of the \n8  Flores Settlement requires licensed facilities in which Defendants detain minors to \n9  provide “information regarding the availability of free legal assistance, the right to be \n10  represented by counsel at no expense to the government . . . .” Exhibit 6 of the Flores \n11  Settlement advises detained minors, “If you believe that you have not been properly \n12  placed or that you have been treated improperly, you may ask a federal judge to review \n13  your case. You may call a lawyer to help you do this. If you cannot afford a lawyer, \n \n14  you may call one from the list of free legal services given to you with this form.” \n15  118.  Section 235(c)(5) of the TVPRA directs Defendant HHS Secretary to \n16  “ensure, to the greatest extent practicable and consistent with section 292 of the \n17  Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. § 1362), that all unaccompanied alien \n18  children who are or have been in the custody of the Secretary or the Secretary of \n19  Homeland Security, and who are not [from contiguous countries], have counsel to \n20  represent  them  in  legal  proceedings  or  matters  and  protect  them  from \n21  mistreatment . . . .”  Section  279(b)(A)  of  the  HSA  makes  ORR  responsible  for \n22  “developing a plan to be submitted to Congress on how to ensure that qualified and \n23  independent legal counsel is timely appointed to represent the interests of each such \n24  [unaccompanied  alien]  child  .  .  .  .”  Immigration  regulations,  including  8  C.F.R. \n25  §§ 287.3(c), 1003.62, 1240.10(a)(2) and 1292.1 et seq., generally guarantee Plaintiffs \n26  and their proposed class members the right to be represented by retained and pro bono \n27  counsel in proceedings before U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the \n28  Executive Office for Immigration Review. \nCenter for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \nComplaint  34.  256 S. Occidental Blvd. \nLos Angeles, CA 90057 \n213/388-8693 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 1   Filed 06/29/18   Page 37 of 43   Page ID #:37\n \n1  119.  In furtherance of TVPRA § 235(c)(5), Defendant HHS contracts with the \n2  Vera Institute of Justice (“VIJ”), a non-profit organization, to coordinate the delivery \n3  of free legal services to unaccompanied children from non-contiguous countries who \n4  are or have been in ORR custody. VIJ in turn subcontracts with non-profit legal aid \n5  providers  to  counsel  and  represent  such  children  in  applying  for  affirmative \n6  immigration benefits, such as asylum or Special Immigrant Juvenile Status, and in \n7  asserting other defenses against removal.  \n8  120.  In many regions of the country, VIJ-funded legal services providers are \n9  the  only  legal  counsel  available  to  juveniles  in  ORR  custody.  Plaintiffs  and  the \n10  members of the proposed class are almost uniformly indigent, speak little or no \n11  English, and have little or no ability to represent themselves in hearings pursuant to \n12  paragraph 24A of the Flores Settlement or in any other legal proceedings involving \n13  ORR’s custody, release, placement or medication decisions. \n \n14  121.  On information and belief, ORR has no eligibility standards for providing \n15  VIJ-funded legal services to detained children. Rather, ORR exercises opaque and \n16  arbitrary discretion to prescribe those legal matters or proceedings in which VIJ-\n17  funded legal providers may represent detained children and those in which they may \n18  not.  \n19  122.  As a matter of policy and practice, ORR routinely bars VIJ-funded legal \n20  services providers from representing unaccompanied children from non-contiguous \n21  countries in legal proceedings involving ORR’s  custody, release, placement, and \n22  medication decisions, even when such legal services providers have the time and \n23  desire to undertake such representation. \n24  123.  Legal proceedings involving ORR’s custody, release, placement, and \n25  medication decisions, including hearings pursuant to paragraph 24A of the Flores \n26  Settlement,  are  “legal  proceedings  or  matters”  within  the  meaning  of  TVPRA \n27  § 235(c)(5).  \n28  124.  By  blocking  VIJ-funded  legal  services  providers  from  representing \nCenter for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \nComplaint  35.  256 S. Occidental Blvd. \nLos Angeles, CA 90057 \n213/388-8693 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 1   Filed 06/29/18   Page 38 of 43   Page ID #:38\n \n1  children  in  legal  proceedings  involving  ORR’s  custody,  release,  placement  and \n2  medication decisions, ORR forces Plaintiffs and those similarly situated to fend for \n3  themselves in a complex and foreign adversarial legal system with little hope of \n4  prevailing.  Without  meaningful  access  to  counsel,  Plaintiffs  and  those  similarly \n5  situated are denied a fair chance of succeeding in legal challenges to ORR’s custody, \n6  release, placement and medication decisions and, a fortiori, suffer prolonged detention \n7  and the harms extended confinement and family separation inflicts. ORR deprives \n8  youth  of  liberty  for  years,  which  is  comparable  to  imprisonment  for  a  felony \n9  conviction.  \n10  125.  In  blocking  Plaintiffs  and  those  similarly  situated  from  receiving \n11  assistance in legal matters and proceedings involving ORR’s custody, placement, \n12  medication, and release decisions, ORR acts arbitrarily, capriciously, abusively of \n13  discretion,  and  contrary  to  children’s  best  interests,  and  obstructs  lawyers  from \n \n14  discharging their duty of zealous representation. \n15  126.  As a direct and proximate result of ORR’s blocking VIJ-funded legal \n16  services providers from representing Plaintiffs and those similarly situated children in \n17  legal  proceedings  involving  ORR’s  custody,  release,  placement,  or  medication \n18  decisions, including hearings pursuant to paragraph 24A of the Flores Settlement, \n19  Plaintiffs  and  those  similarly  situated  are  being:  (a)  improperly  administered \n20  psychotropic drugs; (b) erroneously denied placement in the least restrictive setting \n21  that is in their best interest; and (c) erroneously denied release to available custodians \n22  without unnecessary delay. \n23  VII. \n24  IRREPARABLE INJURY \n25  127.  Plaintiffs  have  suffered  and  will  continue  to  suffer  irreparable  harm \n26  because of Defendants’ policies and practices as challenged herein. ORR has deprived \n27  and will continue to deprive Plaintiffs and those similarly situated of their rights under \n28  the  First  and  Fifth  Amendments,  the  TVPRA,  and  the  Flores  Settlement.

In doing so, Defendants \n10  have profoundly undermined the health and well-being of Plaintiffs and those similarly \n11  situated along multiple domains, as described above.  \n12  VIII. \n13  FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n14  [DENIAL OF DUE PROCESS: DETERMINING CUSTODIANS’ FITNESS] \n15  128.  Plaintiffs  hereby  incorporate  by  reference  Paragraphs  1-127  of  this \n16  Complaint as though fully set forth here. \n17  129.  As  a  matter  of  policy  and  practice  Defendants  unreasonably  and \n18  unnecessarily delay or refuse to release children to parents, close family members, and \n19  other available custodians on the ostensible grounds that such custodians are or may \n20  be unfit, and they do so without affording detained minors or their proposed custodians \n21  a timely, prompt, or meaningful opportunity to be heard regarding such custodians’ \n22  fitness. Defendants’ policies and practices violate the fundamental rights of Plaintiffs \n23  and those similarly situated and demonstrate a deliberate indifference to risk of harm \n24  to children. \n25  130.  Such policy and practice individually and collectively violate paragraphs \n26  14  and  18  of  the  Flores  Settlement,  TVPRA  §  235(c)(2)(A),  the  Administrative \n27  Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq., the procedural and substantive components of \n28  the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, and \nCenter for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \nComplaint  37.  256 S.

Plaintiffs  hereby  incorporate  by  reference  Paragraphs  1-127  of  this \n7  Complaint as though fully set forth here. \n8  132.  As a matter of policy and practice, Defendants place Plaintiffs and those \n9  similarly situated in RTCs, secure facilities, and medium-secure facilities without \n10  affording them a meaningful opportunity to be heard either prior or subsequent to such \n11  placement.   \n12  133.  Such policy and practice individually and collectively violate Definition \n13  6  and  paragraph  19  of  the  Flores  Settlement,  TVPRA  §  235(c)(2)(A),  the \n \n14  Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq., and the Due Process Clause of \n15  the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n16  X. \n17  THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n18  [UNLAWFUL ADMINISTRATION OF PSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS] \n19  134.  Plaintiffs  hereby  incorporate  by  reference  Paragraphs  1-127  of  this \n20  Complaint as though fully set forth here. \n21  135.  As  a  matter  of  policy  and  practice,  Defendants  administer  children \n22  psychotropic  drugs  without  procedural  safeguards,  including:  obtaining  informed \n23  consent or the lawful equivalent; involving a neutral decision maker in the initial \n24  determination of whether to prescribe psychotropic medications to children in ORR \n25  custody; and conducting a periodic review of such treatment decisions to ensure that \n26  youth are not administered psychotropic medications unnecessarily or at harmful \n27  dosage levels or in harmful combinations. \n28  136.

Plaintiffs  hereby  incorporate  by  reference  Paragraphs  1-127  of  this \n9  Complaint as though fully set forth here. \n10  138.  As a matter of policy and practice, ORR blocks VIJ-funded lawyers from \n11  representing Plaintiffs and those similarly situated in legal matters and proceedings \n12  involving ORR’s decisions regarding custody, release, medication, and placement.  \n13  139.  Such policy and practice individually and collectively violate paragraphs \n \n14  24A and 24D, Exhibit 1 paragraph 14, and Exhibit 6 of the Flores Settlement, TVPRA \n15  § 235(c)(5), HSA § 279(b)(A), 8 C.F.R. §§ 287.3(c), 1003.62, 1240.10(a)(2) and \n16  1292.1 et seq., the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 501 et seq., and the Due \n17  Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n18  XII. \n19  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n20  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray that this Court — \n21  1.  assume jurisdiction of this cause;  \n22  2.  certify this case as a class action on behalf of the class proposed herein; \n23  3.  enter declaratory judgment that Defendants’ policies and practices as \n24  challenged herein are unlawful;  \n25  4.  issue temporary and permanent injunctions enjoining Defendants from — \n26  (a)  denying  Plaintiffs  or  their  proposed  class  members  due  process  in \n27  evaluating the fitness of parents and other available custodians; \n28  (b)  denying Plaintiffs or their class members due process in placing them in \nCenter for Human Rights & Constitutional Law \nComplaint  39.  256 S.

I am an attorney admitted to the bar of the United States District Court for \n3  the Central District of California.  I am one of the attorneys who serve as class counsel \n4  for Plaintiffs in the above-captioned action. I am also one of the attorneys for the \n5  plaintiff class in Flores v. Barr, No. 2:85-cv-04544-DMG-AGR. My business address \n6  is 256 S. Occidental Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90057. I execute this declaration in support \n7  of Plaintiffs’ ex parte application for a temporary restraining order and order to show \n8  cause re: preliminary injunction protecting Lucas R. class members from irreparable \n9  injury  during  the  COVID-19  national  public  health  emergency.  I  declare  that  the \n10  following statements are true to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, \n11  formed after reasonable inquiry of the circumstances. I have personal knowledge of the \n12  facts set forth below and, if called as a witness, I could and would testify competently \n13  as follows. \n \n14  2.  Pursuant to ¶¶ 28 and 29 of the settlement approved in Flores in 1997, the \n15  Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”) provides Flores class counsel with statistical \n16  reports on all juveniles in its custody. Among other things, these reports identify class \n17  members, indicate in the name and type of facility in which they are detained, and \n18  provide the date on which each juvenile came into ORR custody. ORR’s data do not \n19  indicate whether juveniles have a family member or other potential custodian in the \n20  United  States  available  to  receive  them,  nor  do  they  indicate  whether  a  potential \n21  custodian has submitted a family reunification application seeking a given juvenile’s \n22  release. \n23  3.  The most recent statistical report indicates as of March 13, 2020, ORR had \n24  3,622 children in custody, 1,193 of whom were in congregate settings after having been \n25  in ORR custody for 30 days or more. \n26  4.  In the course of representing Flores class members, in or about December \n27  2018, I participated in a meeting at ORR’s Shiloh residential treatment center with ORR \n28  representatives overseen by the Flores Special Master/Independent Monitor, Andrea \nHOLGUÍN DECL.

During the meeting, an ORR representative presented a PowerPoint \n2  providing statistics regarding juveniles in ORR custody. At my request, defense counsel \n3  in Flores later forwarded me a printout of the Shiloh PowerPoint presentation, a true \n4  and correct copy of which is annexed as Exhibit O to this Declaration. \n5  5.  On March 22, 2020, I sent a letter to counsel for Defendants outlining the \n6  grave risk posed to Class Members by continuing to house them in congregate care as \n7  well as the relief Plaintiff intended to request through an application for a TRO. On \n8  March 23, 2020, I telephonically met and conferred with Benjamin M. Moss, Senior \n9  Litigation Counsel for the Office of Immigration Litigation, one of the attorneys for the \n10  Defendants in the above-entitled action,1 in an effort to obviate the need for Plaintiffs \n11  to seek a temporary restraining order and to show cause re: preliminary injunction. I \n12  advised counsel Moss of the substance of the attached ex parte application. I also \n13  informed him that this application would be filed this week. Counsel Moss indicated on \n \n14  the March 23, 2020 call that Defendants intended to oppose the ex parte application. \n15  6.  On March 24, 2020, Defendants’ counsel wrote Plaintiffs and advised, \n16  inter alia, that “ORR has stopped placements of UACs2 in the states of California, New \n17  York, and Washington.”  To date, Defendants have not taken any action to expedite \n18  resolution of this dispute which is endangering the health and lives of children at ORR \n19  facilities. \n20  7.

[Doc. # 1.]  On August 2, 2018, Plaintiffs \nfiled a motion seeking certification of certain classes of alien minors who are subject to the \npolicies and practices alleged in the CAC.  [Doc. # 25.]  On August 17, 2018, Defendants filed a \nmotion to dismiss the CAC.  [Doc. # 51.]  The motion for class certification and the motion to \ndismiss are set for a hearing on September 21, 2018 at 9:30 a.m.  [Doc. # 61.] \n \n  On September 7, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint (“FAC”) \nas a matter of right pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(1)(B).  [Doc. # 81.]  \nAmong other things, the FAC:  (1) joins two new Plaintiffs to this action (i.e., Sirena P. and \nBenjamin F.), see FAC at 1,1 (2) includes a fifth cause of action for discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, see id. at 56–57, and (3) indicates \nthat Plaintiffs intend to represent two new classes of alien minors whom ORR has allegedly \ndiscriminated against on the basis of their disabilities, see id. at 30–31. \n \n  In light of Plaintiffs’ FAC, the Court DENIES as moot Defendants’ motion to dismiss.2  \nSee In re WellPoint, Inc.

[and] is subject to \nthe  same  challenges  as  the  original  (i.e.,  motion  to  dismiss,  to  strike,  for  more  definite \nstatement).’”).    The  Court  further  DENIES  without  prejudice  Plaintiffs’  motion  for  class \ncertification.  Given that Defendants seek the dismissal of this action, it is appropriate to resolve \nany such motion to dismiss before or at the same time that the Court determines whether to \ncertify Plaintiffs’ proposed classes.  See Manual for Complex Litigation, Fourth, at § 21.133 \n(footnote omitted) (“Precertification rulings frequently dispose of all or part of the litigation. . . . \n[C]ourts should rule early on motions to dismiss, challenging whether the plaintiffs have stated a \ncause of action.  Early resolution of these questions may avoid expense for the parties and \nburdens for the court and may minimize use of the class action process for cases that are weak on \nthe merits.”).  Additionally, because Plaintiffs intend to represent two new proposed classes, the \ninterests  of  judicial  economy  and  efficiency  counsel  against  ruling  on  the  pending  class \ncertification motion.  If Defendants intend to move to dismiss the FAC, then the forthcoming \nmotion to dismiss and motion for class certification shall both be noticed for a hearing at the \nsame date and time.                \n         \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n                                                                                                                                                             \naffect the arguments raised in Defendants’ pending Motion to Dismiss.”  FAC at 1 n.1 (citing Martin v. Weed, No. \nCV 18-00027-TUC-RM, 2018 WL 2431837, at *1 n.1 (D. Ariz. May 30, 2018)).  Martin is of no assistance to \nPlaintiffs.  There, a district court construed a motion to dismiss the original complaint as a motion seeking dismissal \nof the amended pleading because all parties conceded that the defendant’s motion was not moot and it was apparent \nthat the amended pleading did not affect the motion.  See Martin, 2018 WL 2431837, at *1 n.1.  Defendants to this \naction have not made such a concession, and the FAC expands the scope of the litigation by adding new parties and \na fifth cause of action. \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n ",

ORR’s  policies  require the  release of unaccompanied  alien  children to  parents,  guardians,  relatives,  or individuals \ndesigned  by the  child’s  parents,  referred  to  as “sponsors.” Safe  and  timely  release (also  known  as “family  reunification”)  must promote  public safety and \nensure that sponsors are able to  provide for the  physical  and  mental  well-being  of children. \nORR  evaluates  potential  sponsors’  ability to  provide for the  child’s  physical  and  mental  well-being,  as  required  by law.  ORR  also  protects children from \nsmugglers,  traffickers,  or others who  might seek to victimize  or otherwise engage the child  in  criminal,  harmful  or exploitative  activity.  The  process for the \nsafe  and timely  release of an  unaccompanied  alien  child from  ORR  custody involves several  steps,  including:  the  identification  of soonsors;  sponsor \napplication;  interviews;  the assessment (evaluation) of sponsor suitability,  including  verification  of the  sponsor’s  identity and  relationship to the child  (if any), \nbackground  checks,  and  in  some cases  home  studies;  and  post-release  planning. \nRevised 6/18/19 \n2.2  Sponsor Application  Process \nORR  begins the  process of finding family  members and  others who  may  be qualified to care for an  unaccompanied  alien  child  as soon  as the  child  enters \nORR’s care.  Parents,  relatives,  or close family friends  may apply to  have the  child  released to their care. \nRevised 6/18/19 \n2.2.1  Identification  of Qualified  Sponsors \nThe ORR care  provider (https:/Mwww.acf.hhs.gov/programs/orr/resource/children-entering-the-united-states-unaccompanied-guide-to- \nterms#Care  Provider),  the  ORR funded facility that cares for the  child,  interviews the child  as well  as parents (see the section  below on  how ORR \nconfirms  relationship with  child),  legal  guardians,  and/or family  members to  identify qualified  custodians (“sponsors”).  If a child  is either too young  or there \nare  other factors that prohibit the  care  provider from obtaining  potential  sponsor information from the  unaccompanied  alien  child,  the  care  provider may \nseek assistance from the child’s consulate  in  collaboration with  the ORR  Federal  Field  Specialist (ORR/FFS) \n(https://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/orr/resource/children-entering-the-united-states-unaccompanied-guide-to-terms#ORR/Federal  Field \nSpecialist) or from  a  reputable family tracing  organization.  Finding  a  sponsor for the child  is an  ongoing  process that continues during  the  unaccompanied \nalien  child’s stay  in  ORR  care and  custody  in the event that the  primary  potential  sponsor or primary  release  plan  is  not approved. \nORR  releases children to a  sponsor in the following  order of preference:'  parent;  legal  guardian;  an  adult relative (brother,  sister,  aunt,  uncle,  grandparent \nor first cousin);  an  adult individual  or entity designated  by the  parent or legal  guardian  (through  a signed  declaration  or other document that ORR \ndetermines  is sufficient to  establish the signatory’s  parental/guardian  relationship);  a licensed  program willing to accept legal  custody;  or an  adult individual \nor entity seeking  custody when  it appears that there  is no  other likely alternative to  long term  ORR  care and  custody.  ORR  has  grouped  UAC  cases  into the \nfollowing  categories.2 \ne  Category  1:  Parent or legal  guardian  (This  includes qualifying  step-parents that have  legal or joint custody of the child  or teen) \ne  Category 2A:  An  immediate  relative--a  brother;  sister;  grandparent or other close  relatives (aunt,  uncle,  first cousin) who  previously served  as the \nUAC’s  primary caregiver.  (This  includes  biological  relatives,  relatives through  legal  marriage,  and  half-siblings). \n¢  Category 2B:  An  immediate  relative-- including  aunt,  uncle,  or first cousin who was not previously the  UAC’s  primary caregiver.  (This  includes \nbiological  relatives,  relatives through  legal  marriage). \ne  Category 3:  Other sponsor,  such  as distant relatives and  unrelated  adult individuals \ne  Category 4:  No  sponsors  identified \nPage374\nCase  2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA  Document  227-17  Filed  03/25/20  Page  4of11  Page!D \n#:5412 \nAlthough  ORR  gives  preference to a parent or legal  guardian when  determining  release  plans,  there are  instances when  ORR  does not release an \nunaccompanied  alien  child  to a parent or legal  guardian.  These  include: \ne«  There  has been  a court ordered termination  of parental  rights over the child. \ne  There  is substantial  evidence that the child would  be at risk of harm  if released  to the parent or legal  guardian. \nIn  some cases,  an  unaccompanied  alien  child  enters the  United  States with  her biological  child.  In  those cases,  ORR  identifies a sponsor for the \nunaccompanied  alien  child  as well  as for the  infant or toddler.  In  most instances,  it is  in  the  best interest of the unaccompanied  alien  child  and  her biological \nchild  to  be released  to the same sponsor.  For case processing  purposes,  the sponsor is assigned  the same category for the  infant as for the  UAC  mother. \nThis is true even  if the  potential  sponsor would  be assigned  a different category (based  on their relationship status)  if he or she were to sponsor the  infant \nalone. \nRevised 6/18/19 \n2.2.2  Contacting  Potential  Sponsors \nThe child’s care provider (https://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/orr/resource/children-entering-the-united-states-unaccompanied-guide-to- \nterms#Care  Provider)  is responsible for implementing  safe screening  methods when  contacting  and  communicating with  potential  sponsors.  These \nmethods are to ensure that a  potential  sponsor does not pose a  risk to the  unaccompanied  alien  child,  to other children  in  the care  provider facility or to \ncare provider staff. \nSafe screening  methods  include: \ne  Use of appropriate  interpreters \ne  Identity of the sponsor is obtained \ne  Verification  of family relationships \ne  Coordination with  the  unaccompanied  alien  child’s parents,  legal  guardians,  or closest relatives prior to contacting  non-relative adult potential \nsponsors \ne  Screening for exploitation,  abuse,  trafficking,  or other safety concerns \ne  Engaging  the child  to communicate openly with  care  provider staff about his or her own  sense of safety \nPosted 1/27/15 \n2.2.3  The  Family  Reunification  Application \nAll  potential  soonsors must complete an  application  in  order for a child  to  be released  to them from  ORR  custody (the “Family  Reunification Application’). \nWithin  24  hours of identification  of a  potential  sponsor for a child  or youth,  the care  provider or the ORR  National  Call  Center sends the sponsor a  package \nwith  the application  and  related  documents (called  the  Family  Reunification  Packet or FRP). \nThe application  package  includes the following  documents: \ne  Family  Reunification  Packet Cover Letter \ne  Authorization for Release of Information \ne  Family  Reunification Application \ne  Sponsor Care Agreement \ne  A flyer with  contact information  on  organizations offering  a  Legal  Orientation  Program for Custodians (LOPC) \ne  A flyer with  contact information for the  UAC  Sexual Abuse  Hotline \ne Fingerprint instructions \ne  Sponsor Handbook \ne  Letter of Designation for Care of a  Minor (If parent or legal  guardian wishes to specify) \ne  Sponsor Declaration \ne  A flyer warning  sponsors of potential fraud  schemes \nThe care provider is available to  help the  potential  sponsor complete the application.  The care  provider also  informs  potential  sponsors that they may \nsubmit additional  information to support the application  and  reminds  potential  sponsors of the deadlines for completing  the forms.  The sponsor may also \nreceive assistance  in  completing  the application  at some fingerprinting  locations. \nRevised 6/18/19 \n2.2.4  Required  Documents  for Submission  with  the Application  for  Release \nPage375\nCase  2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA  Document  227-17  Filed  03/25/20  Page5of11  Page!D \nIn  addition  to completing  and  signing  the  Family  Reunification Application  (FRA) and the Authorization for Release of Information,  potential  soonsors  must \nprovide documentation  of identity,  address,  and  relationship to the child  they seek to sponsor.*  Potential  sponsors must also submit documentation \nverifying  the  identity of the children  they seek to sponsor,  and  evidence verifying  the  identity of all  adults  residing with  the sponsor and  all  adult caregivers \nidentified  in  a sponsor care  plan.  In  addition to their use as evidence of the foregoing,  all  documentation  submitted  under this section  is used  as part of the \noverall  sponsor assessment process.  See Section  2.4 Sponsor Assessment Criteria and  Home Studies \n(https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/resource/children-entering-the-united-states-unaccompanied-section-2#2.4). As a  result,  ORR  may in  its discretion \nrequire  potential  sponsors to submit additional  documentation  beyond  the  minimums specified  below. \nProof of Sponsor Identity \nTo verify their identity,  all  potential  sponsors must submit original  versions or legible copies of government-issued  identification  documents.  They may \npresent either one selection from  List A or two or more documents from  List B.  If a potential  soonsor presents selections from  list B,  at least one selection \nmust contain  a legible  photograph.  Expired  documents are acceptable for the  purpose of establishing  identity. \nLIST OF ACCEPTABLE  DOCUMENTS \nLISTA \nU.S.  Passport or U.S.  Passport Card \nPermanent Resident Card or Alien  Registration  Receipt Card (Form I-551) \nForeign  Passport that contains a photograph \nEmployment Authorization Document that contains a photograph (Form I-766) \nU.S.  Driver's License or Identification Card \nOR \nLIST B \nU.S. Certificate of Naturalization \nU.S.  Military Identification Card \nBirth Certificate \nMarriage Certificate \nCourt order for name change \nForeign  national  identification card \nConsular passport renewal  receipt that contains a photograph \nMexican consular identification card \nForeign driver's license that contains a photograph \nForeign voter registration card that contains a photograph \nCanadian border crossing card that contains a photograph \nMexican border crossing card that contains a photograph with valid Form I-94 \nRefugee travel document that contains a photograph \nOther similar documents \nProof of identify of adult household  members  and  adult care givers  identified  in  a sponsor care  plan \nAll  potential  sponsors must submit documentation verifying  the  identity of non-sponsor adults in their household  or in  a sponsor care  plan.  For all  such \nadults,  potential  sponsors must submit at least one  identification  document that contains a  photograph.  The document may be from  either List A or List B \nabove,  and  may be an  original  version  or a legible copy of the document.  Expired  documents are acceptable for the purpose of establishing  identity.  In \naddition,  potential  soonsors may submit an  original  version  or legible copy of an  ORR Verification  of Release  Form,  but only to verify the  identity of adults \nunder the age of 21,  and  only  if the form  contains a  photograph.  ORR will  not accept a Verification  of Release as  proof of identity if it does  not contain  a \nphotograph,  and/or is for anyone 21  and  older. \nProof of Immigration  Status  or U.S. Citizenship \nAll  potential  sponsors must submit at least one original  version  or legible copy of a  non-expired  government-issued  document to prove their immigration \nstatus or U.S.  citizenship,  if applicable.  For administrative  purposes,  ORR  considers any potential  sponsor who  provides an  expired  document or is unable \nto provide any documents to  be without status.  ORR  does not provide individual  immigration  status information  to  DHS. \nORR  may use the  macro-level  information  related  to  immigration  status or presumed  immigration  status for statistical  reporting.  ORR  uses individual \npotential  sponsor immigration  status information  to determine whether a sponsor care  plan  is necessary in  the event the sponsor is required  to leave the \nUnited  States (see Section  2.6  Sponsor Immigration  Status  and  Release of Unaccompanied Alien  Children). \nLIST OF ACCEPTABLE  DOCUMENTS \nPage376\nCase  2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA  Document  227-17  Filed  03/25/20  Page6of11  PageID \n#:5414 \nPROOF OF IMMIGRATION STATUS \nValid visa \nLegal  permanent resident card (green card) \nNotice to Appear \nOther Federal government issued documentation providing  immigration status information \nOR \nPROOF OF U.S. CITIZENSHIP \nU.S.  passport \nU.S.  birth certificate \nNaturalization certificate \nCitizenship Certificate \nState Department Form 240 — Report of Birth Abroad of a Citizen of the United States \nCourt order \nOther government issued document sufficient to prove U.S. citizenship \nProof of Address \nAll  potential  sponsors must submit at least one form  of documentation  verifying  their current address.  Acceptable forms of documentation  include original \nversions or legible copies of: \ne  A current lease or mortgage statement dated within  the last two  months  before submission  of the  FRA; \n¢  A utility  bill,  addressed  in the sponsor’s  name and  dated within the last two months before submission  of the  FRA; \ne  A bank statement dated within  the last two  months  before submission  of the  FRA; \n¢«  A payroll  check stub  issued  by an  employer,  dated within  the last two months before submission  of the  FRA; \ne  A piece of mail from  a county,  state,  or federal  agency (with  the exception  of ORR) with the sponsor’s  name and  residential  address and  dated \nwithin the last two months before submission  of the  FRA; \ne  A notarized  letter from  a landlord  on  the business stationary of the real  property owner confirming  the sponsor’s address;  and \ne  Other similar documents reliably indicating  that the sponsor resides at the claimed  address,  dated within  the last two  months  before submission  of \nthe  FRA. \nORR  may use alternative  methods to verify address.  For example,  ORR  may send a  letter containing  specific instructions to the address given  by the \nsponsor,  and  provide a timeline by which  the sponsor must comply with  the  instructions. \nProof of Child’s  Identity \nThe  potential  sponsor or child’s family must provide the  unaccompanied  alien  child’s birth  certificate or a legible copy of the child’s  birth  certificate. \nProof of Sponsor-Child  Relationship \nThe  potential  sponsor must provide at least one form  of evidence verifying  the  relationship claimed with  the child.4 Acceptable documents include original \nversions or legible copies of: \ne  Birth  certificates: \ne  Marriage certificates; \ne  Death  certificates; \ne  Court records; \ne  Guardianship  records; \ne  Hospital  records; \ne  School  records; \ne  Written  affirmation  of relationship from  Consulate;  and \ne  Other similar documents. \nCategory 2A potential sponsors  providing  evidence of “primary caregiver” \nCategory 2A sponsors who are not grandparents or adult siblings must prove they are or were the  UAC’s  primary caregiver. A primary caregiver is defined \nas any person who is primarily entrusted with  the child’s care and who lives with  the child. \nIf the  potential  sponsor has any guardianship documents or other documents from  a state or foreign  government they must submit this with  the  Family \nReunification Application.  ORR  also accepts sworn  affidavits from  potential  sponsors in  addition  to corroborating  interviews the Case  Manager has with  the \nchild,  potential  sponsor,  and  other family  members to establish whether the  potential  sponsor was a primary giver to the child. \nPage377\nCase  2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA  Document  227-17  Filed  03/25/20  Page  7of11  Page!D \n#:5415 \nCategory 3  potential sponsors without a bona fide pre-existing  relationship \nCategory 3  potential  sponsors who are  unable to provide verifiable documentation  of a familial  relationship with  the  unaccompanied  alien  child  must submit \nevidence that reliably and  sufficiently demonstrates a  bona fide social  relationship with  the child  and/or the child’s family that existed  before the child \nmigrated  to the  United  States.  Care  providers  must attain  sufficient corroboration  to  be confident that they have  received  needed  verification  of the \nrelationship  between  the  potential  sponsor and  the child  or child’s family.  If a Category 3  potential  soonsor does not submit evidence that reliably and \nsufficiently demonstrates a bona fide  preexisting  social  relationship  between  the  potential  Category 3  sponsor and  the child  and/or the child’s family,  ORR \nmay take this into account when  determining  the suitability of the case for release.  In  such  cases ORR  may  require that the  potential  Category 3  sponsor, \nthe  UAC,  and  the child’s family,  establish  ongoing  regular contact while the child  is  in  ORR  care,  prior to a  release recommendation. \nCriminal  History \nIf a  potential  sponsor has been  charged with  or convicted  of any crime or investigated for the  physical  abuse,  sexual  abuse,  neglect,  or abandonment of a \nminor,  he or she  must provide  related  court records and  police records,  as well  as governmental  social  service records or proof of rehabilitation  related  to \nthe  incident. \nIf a sponsor,  household  member,  or adult caregiver provides any false  information  in  the application  of release and/or accompanying  documents or submits \nfraudulent documents for the purposes of obtaining  sponsorship of the child,  ORR will  report the  incident to  HHS/Office of the  Inspector General  (OIG) and \nto  U.S.  Immigration  and  Customs  Enforcement’s  Homeland  Security  Investigations (HSI).  Fraudulent documents  include documents on which the address, \nidentity,  or other relevant information  is false or documents that have  been  manufactured  or altered without lawful  authorization.  ORR will  deny  release if it \nis determined  that fraudulent documents were submitted  during the application  of release  process. \nRevised 7/03/19 \n2.2.5  Legal  Orientation  Program for Custodians \nAll  potential  sponsors of children  and  youth  under the care of ORR  should  attend  a  presentation  provided  by the  Legal  Orientation  Program for Custodians \n(LOPC).  The purpose of this  program  is to  inform  potential  sponsors of their responsibilities  in  ensuring  the child’s appearance at all  immigration \nproceedings,  as well  as  protecting  the child from  mistreatment,  exploitation,  and  trafficking,  as provided  under the Trafficking Victims  Protection \nReauthorization Act of 2008.  The  program  also  provides  information  about possible free legal  counsel  (pro  bono legal  services) for the youth  or child  during \nthe  immigration  court process. \nThe Office of Legal Access  Programs (OLAP),  within  the  Executive Office for Immigration  Review (EOIR) at the  U.S.  Department of Justice,  manages the \nLOPC  and  contracts with  legal  service organizations around  the country to  provide  LOPC  services to  potential  sponsors  in  their local  communities or in \nmetropolitan  areas served  by the  program.  EOIR  is the entity  in the federal  government that is also  responsible for adjudicating  immigration  cases by fairly, \nexpeditiously,  and  uniformly interpreting  and  administering the  nation's immigration  laws. \nThe  unaccompanied  alien  child’s case manager (https://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/orr/resource/children-entering-the-united-states- \nunaccompanied-qguide-to-terms#Case Manager)  is responsible for informing  potential  sponsors about all  procedures related  to the child’s case-- \nincluding  attendance at an  LOPC  presentation.  The  Family  Reunification  Packet (FRP) that goes to each  potential  sponsor includes an Authorization for \nRelease of Information that the sponsor must sign  before the case  manager may schedule an  appointment for LOPC  services.  All  potential  soonsors \nshould  submit the Authorization for Release of Information  immediately and  prior to submitting  the complete  FRP to ensure timely scheduling  of their LOPC \nsession. \nUpon  receipt of the Authorization,  the case manager schedules an  appointment for a potential  sponsor to attend  a  presentation with  one of the  LOPC \nproviders around  the country. Alternatively,  the case manager contacts the LOPC  National Call Center at (888) 996-3848  and  arranges for the Call  Center \nto schedule an  LOPC  appointmenfotr  the  potential  sponsor or mail  an  LOPC  Information  Packet to the sponsor. \nWhen  evaluating family members and  other potential  soonsors,  ORR  considers whether they have attended  an  LOPC  presentation.  Attendance at an \nLOPC  presentation  is a factor in  the  release assessment. \nRevised 12/4/17 \n2.2.6  Additional  Questions  and  Answers  about this  Topic \nQ:  Will sponsors  receive the  Family  Reunification  Packet through the mail  or electronically? \nA:  Case managers will work with  sponsors to  identify the  best way to get the  packets to them,  whether electronically or by fax transmission  or postage  paid \novernight mail. \nQ:  Do sponsors  need  assistance from  an  attorney or a  paid  representative to complete the  packet? \nA:  No.  The  unaccompanied  alien  child’s case  manager will  be able to help the potential  soonsor complete the form  and  explain  the  process. \nQ:  Is  it possible for an  unaccompanied  alien  child’s spouse to  be a sponsor? \nA:  ORR  considers release to an  unaccompanied  alien  child’s adult spouse on  a case  by case  basis. \nPage378\nCase  2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA  Document  227-17  Filed  03/25/20  Page  8of11  Page!D \n#:5416 \nState laws on  statutory rape are  not the standard  in  assessing whether a youth  has been  sexually abused for the  purposes of #3.  Care providers use the \ndefinition from the ORR  rule concerning  sexual  abuse and  harassment;  however, for the  purposes of determining when  a  home study is required,  the \nperpetrator is limited  to a parent,  legal  guardian,  caregiver or other adult with  a special  relationship to the child. \nUnder what circumstances  is a child’s  health  or welfare considered to  have been significantly  harmed  or threatened? \nCare  providers assess the totality of the circumstances in  determining whether a child’s health  or welfare  has been  significantly harmed  or threatened.  In \nevaluating  a specific case,  care  providers take  into consideration  not only the definitions of physical  and  sexual  abuse listed \nabove,  but also the circumstances surrounding  the  incident and  any behaviors that the child  or youth  exhibits as a  result of the abuse.  Circumstances to \nconsider include  but are not limited to:  the amount of time that has passed  since the abuse,  the  period  of time  in which  the abuse occurred,  the cultural \ncontext in which  the abuse occurred,  the age of the child  or youth  at the time of the abuse,  and the  relationship between  the youth  and  the  perpetrator. \nCare  providers take  into consideration  the situations and  behaviors listed  below,  but do  not make a determination  based  solely on the  presence or absence \nof one of them. \ne  The child  experiences on-going  medical  issues from  physical  injuries. \ne  The child  exhibits negative or harmful  behaviors,  thoughts or emotions,  such  as,  but not limited  to,  excessive  hostility or aggression  towards others, \nfire setting,  cutting,  depression,  eating  disorders suicidal  ideation  or substance abuse. \nIn  evaluating  difficult cases,  the care  provider should  consult with  their ORR/FFS. \nRevised 1/9/17 \n2.4.3  Additional  Questions  and  Answers  on  This  Topic \nQ:  What happens  if a  new sponsor is  identified  during the sponsor assessment process? \nA:  If there are  multiple  potential  sponsors,  the ORR-funded  care  provider will  exhaust all  efforts to facilitate a  release to a parent or legal  guardian while \nalso contacting  and  evaluating  other potential  soonsors concurrently.  ORR  has  release order preferences and will  evaluate sponsors concurrently in \naccordance with  the preference orders to determine the  best placement for the child. \nPosted 1/27/15 \n2.5  Sponsorship  Assessment  Background  Check  Investigations \nOne of ORR’s priorities  is ensuring  the safe  release of unaccompanied  alien  children  to an  appropriate sponsor.  Consistent with  ORR’s mission  and  in \ncompliance with  requirements found  at 8  U.S.C.  1232(c)(3)(A) to  perform  an  independent finding  that a potential  sponsor has not engaged  in  any activity \nthat would  indicate a potential  risk to the child,  ORR  requires a  background  check of all  potential  sponsors and their adult household  members. \nTo  begin  the  background  check process,  the  potential  soonsor and  adult household  members  must first complete the Authorization for Release of \nInformation form  (if applicable),  submit fingerprints (if required)  and  provide a copy of a valid  government issued  photo  identification. Adult caregivers \nidentified  in  a sponsor care  plan  also  require  background  checks,  as outlined  in  the chart at section  2.5.1.  The type of background  checks  performed  on  a \nsponsor and  adult household  members is dependent in  part on  the sponsor’s relationship,  if any, with  the child.  See section  2.2.1  Identification  of \nQualified  Sponsors for a description  of sponsor categories. \nAll  potential  sponsors and  adult household  members undergo a  public records  background  check of criminal  history and  sex offender registry databases. \nSponsors  in  Categories 2B  and  3,  as well  as some Category  1  and  2A sponsors,  adult household  members,  and  adult caregivers identified  in  a sponsor \ncare plan  require fingerprint background  checks that are  processed through  Federal  partners. \nORR  transmits fingerprint submissions (if required) to the  U.S.  Department of Justice’s (DOJ)  Federal  Bureau  of Investigation  (FBI) to perform criminal \nhistory checks.’ After completing  these checks,  the  FBI  submits the  results to the  Department of Health  and  Human  Services/Program  Support Center \n(HHS/PSC).  HHS/PSC  interprets the results and  notifies ORR that the  biometric and  biographic checks conducted  by  DOJ  are complete.  HHS/PSC  also \nprovides copies of the  results to ORR. \nIn  some cases,  ORR  requires sponsors,  adult household  members,  and  adult caregivers to  undergo a  background  check search  of state child  abuse and \nneglect (CA/N)  registries maintained  by individual  states.  In  these cases,  HHS/PSC works with  the  relevant state agency or directs the subject of the check \nto request results from the relevant state agency in  compliance with  state law and  regulation. \nRevised 6/18/19 \n2.5.1  Background  Check  Requirements \nThe following  table lists the types of background  checks performed,  and  explains when they are  performed,  based  on  the  potential  sponsor’s  relationship to \nthe  unaccompanied  alien  child  and  other release considerations.  The table only indicates the  minimum  requirements for the  background  check process for \nPage379\nCase  2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA  Document  227-17  Filed  03/25/20  Page9of11  PageID \n#:5417 \nsponsors and  others.

A potential  soonsor may  be denied  based  on \nthe  results of a  background  check,  and  a  release decision  may remain  undecided  until  ORR  obtains the  results of a potential  soonsor’s criminal  history or \nchild  abuse and  neglect reports. \nThe  biometric and  biographical  information,  including fingerprints,  are shared with  FBI  to investigate criminal  history through  the  National  Criminal \nInformation  Center and  may  be  used consistent with  their authorities.  Biometric and  biographical  information  may  be shared with federal,  state or local  law \nenforcement or state child welfare agencies,  as necessary,  to conduct criminal  history searches or search for adverse child welfare findings. \nPage380\nCase  2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA  Document  227-17  Filed  03/25/20  Page  10  0f11  Page  ID \n#:5418 \nCriminal  History and Adverse Child Welfare  Finding  Results \nIn the event that a background  check of a  potential  sponsor or,  if applicable,  adult household  member,  reveals criminal  history or a safety risk,  the care \nprovider and  ORR  evaluate this information  and  request the  potential  sponsor to  provide any additional  information  that may demonstrate the  potential \nsponsor’s ability to  provide for the child’s  physical  and  mental well-being. \nIf release  is not barred  by Section  2.7.4,  the decision  to  release a child  or youth  to a sponsor in  these circumstances  is based  on  all  the following \nconsiderations: \ne  The severity of the criminal  and/or child  abuse/neglect history; \ne  The length  of time that has passed  since the criminal  act or child  abuse/neglect allegation  occurred; \ne  The  relationship of the  potential  sponsor and  other adult household  members to the child  or youth;  and \ne  The evidence,  if any,  of rehabilitation  since the criminal  act or child  abuse/neglect allegation  occurred. \nIn  cases where the proposed  sponsor or an  adult household  member has  been  charged with,  but not convicted  of,  a crime,  ORR  may postpone a final \nrelease decision  until  the legal  issue  is resolved. \nIn  cases where ORR  has released a  child  and  later obtains derogatory information  on  a sponsor or sponsor household  member,  ORR  determines whether \nthe  information  if known  prior to  release would  have led  to a denial  of sponsorship or presents some other high  risk child welfare concern.  In  these \ninstances ORR  contacts state CPS  and/or local  law enforcement (as necessary) with jurisdiction  over the sponsor’s home and  provides them with  ORR’s \nfindings.  ORR  may contact the sponsor in  certain  situations to  inform them  of child welfare concerns post release  in  these  instances,  especially where  it \nconcerns an  individual  in  the sponsor’s home. \nSummary Table of Results  of Background  Checks  and  Next Steps \nThe following  table shows procedures following the  results of background  checks. \nBACKGROUND CHECK \nRESULTS  NEXT STEPS \nNo arrest record; check  Proceed with release decision-making  process.

Sponsors  may also go to any local \npolice department for paper fingerprinting  services in  the event a digital fingerprint provider is not conveniently located  near a sponsor’s location. \nFingerprinting  services are  not available at ORR  headquarters or at HHS/PSC  offices. \nQ2:  Are potential  sponsors required  to disclose to the care  provider that they  have a  record  of a criminal  charge or child  abuse? \nA2:  Yes.  The sponsor must immediately advise the care  provider of this situation  and  gather detailed  documentation  of the charges,  dispositions,  police \nreports,  and  evidence of rehabilitation. \nQ3:  What happens if a  public records or sex offender registry check returns disqualifying findings for a sponsor,  adult household  member,  or adult \ncaregiver identified  in  the sponsor care plan? \nA3:  The Case  Manager informs the sponsor,  and  provides the sponsor with  a copy of the  results.  The sponsor and  household  member/adult caregiver may \ndispute the  results,  and  provide further evidence or information  that a check was not performed  correctly (e.g.,  the wrong  date of birth was used,  the \nindividual’s name was spelled  incorrectly,  etc.).  The Case  Manager reruns the check using the corrected  information.  If further information  is  required,  such \nas additional  background  checks,  the Case  Manager contacts the sponsor and  household  member/adult caregiver to obtain  the  information,  or make other \narrangements so that the safety risk to the unaccompanied  alien  child  is mitigated  (e.g.,  taking  steps so that the  household  member no longer resides  in \nthe sponsor’s home,  identifying  a new adult caregiver,  etc.). \nQ4:  What happens if an  adult household  member refuses to cooperate with  a  background  check? \nA4:  ORR  may deny release when  an  adult household  member refuses to cooperate with  a  background  check.  In  such  cases,  ORR  considers the totality of \nthe circumstances,  including  the adult household  member’s refusal  and  all  other relevant and  available information  to determine whether the release \nPage381\nCase  2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA  Document  227-17  Filed  03/25/20  Page  11o0f11  Page  ID \n#:5419 \nprocess may continue.  ORR  determines the  best interests of a child  and  does  not release any child  to a sponsor until  ORR  has determined  that it is safe to \ndo so. \nQ5:  Do  background  checks expire? \nAd:  Yes.  The  FBI  National  Criminal  History Check,  Child Abuse and  Neglect (CA/N) Check,  and  State Criminal  History  Repository Check and/or Local \nPolice Check all  expire 270  days from the day results are received.  The  Public Records Check and  Sex Offender Registry Check expire 90  days from the \nday ORR  receives results.  ORR  requires new background  checks  if the  previous results have expired  prior to ORR  approving  the child’s  release;  this \nincludes obtaining  a  new set of fingerprints (re-fingerprinting) when  applicable. \nQ6:  Does ORR  share the  results of the  FBI fingerprint checks with  other parties? \nA6:  ORR  does  not release the results of the  FBI  fingerprints to outside organizations or individuals,  or to ORR  care providers.  The  FBI  searches  DHS \ndatabases that may contain  overlapping  records.  The  FBI  system  automatically initiates a notification  to the  DHS  system  if a  particular record  has  been \nsearched. \nQ7:  Can  DHS  use  information  gathered from the ORR  background  check process to enforce  immigration  policies against potential  sponsors or others? \nA7:  Until  September 30,  2019,  DHS  is restricted from  using  a  background  check subject’s information for immigration  enforcement actions such  as placing \na subject in  detention,  removal,  referring  the  individual for a decision  on  removal,  or starting  removal  proceedings.  Generally stated,  they include:  certain \nfelonies;  an  association with  a  business that employs minors and  does not pay a legal wage or prevents the  minor from  going to school;  or an  association \nwith  prostitution.  The felonies include:  (A) an  aggravated felony as defined  in  8  U.S.C.  1101(a)(43));  (B) child  abuse;  (C) sexual  violence or abuse;  or (D) \nchild  pornography.  An  aggravated felony,  is defined  at 8  U.S.C.  §  1101(a)(43),  and  includes a listing  of 21  different kinds of crimes. \nIf the subject of a  background  check is concerned  about having  been  charged  or convicted  of a crime,  Case  Managers make a  request that the subject talk \nto an  attorney about whether their criminal  history would fit the definition. \nRevised 6/18/19 \n2.6  Sponsor  Immigration  Status  and  Release  of  Unaccompanied  Alien  Children \nORR  uses immigration  status information  to determine whether a sponsor care  plan  is necessary in  the event the sponsor is  required  to leave the  United \nStates.  ORR  does  not disqualify potential  sponsors based  solely on their immigration  status or for law enforcement purposes. \nIf the sponsor has an  outstanding  order of removal,  or a pending  order of removal  that is related to an  underlying  criminal  act,  the decision  to  release a \nchild  or youth  to a sponsor in  these circumstances  is  based  on  the considerations described  in  Section  2.5.2.  ORR  bars release to any unrelated  individual \nwho has an  outstanding  order of removal. \nHow does ORR  obtain  information  about immigration  status? \nDuring the sponsor assessment process,  case  managers ask sponsors about their immigration  status and  ask them to  provide documentation  sufficient to \nprove their immigration  status (see Section  2.2.4  Required  Documents for Submission with  the Application for Release). \nWhat is  in  a sponsor care  plan? \nA sponsor care  plan  identifies the  individual  that will  assume care of an  unaccompanied  alien  child  if the sponsor becomes unable to care for the child  (see \nSection  2.7.6  Issues  Related to  Recommendations and  Decisions). \nRevised 6/18/19 \n2.7  Recommendations  and  Decisions  on  Release \nORR  care providers must make a recommendation  to  release a child  to a  potential  sponsor after the care provider has evaluated  the sponsor,  completed \nthe  background  checks,  and  collected  necessary documentation  to  prove the sponsor’s  identity and  relationship to the child  or youth.  The  recommendation \nmust take  into consideration  all  relevant information,  including  the  report and  recommendations from  a  home study,  if conducted;  laws governing the \nprocess;  and  other factors in the case.  The ORR  care  provider makes a  recommendation for release  if the care provider concludes that the  release  is safe \nand  the sponsor can  care for the  physical  and  mental well-being  of the child. \ne  The care  provider Case Manager (https://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/orr/resource/children-entering-the-united-states-unaccompanied- \nguide-to-terms#Case Manager)and  the Case Coordinator  (https://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/orr/resource/children-entering-the-united- \nstates-unaccompanied-guide-to-terms#Case Coordinators)must make a  recommendation  to the ORR/FFS \n(https:/Awww.acf.hhs.gov/programs/orr/resource/children-entering-the-united-states-unaccompanied-guide-to-terms#ORR/Federal  Field \nSpecialist) on  the  release of the  unaccompanied  alien  child to a  particular sponsor.  If the Case  Manager and  Case Coordinator cannot agree on  a \nparticular recommendation,  or if the case  is particularly complicated,  they may refer the case directly to an  ORR/FFS for guidance on  how to \nproceed. \ne  After receiving the  recommendation,  the ORR/FFS  (https:/Mwww.acf.hhs.gov/programs/orr/resource/children-entering-the-united-states- \nunaccompanied-guide-to-terms#ORR/Federal  Field  Specialist)or other ORR/Headquarters staff \nPage382\n‘Mg  e  i Sedlew ’ ey weeel 5 ah er  Seed \n \n \n  EXHIBIT  O \n \n \n \nPage383\nCase  2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA  Document  227-18  Filed  03/25/20  Page  2of27  PageID \n#:5421 \nOffice  of  Refugee  Resettlement \nUnaccompanied  Alien  Child \nProgram \nPage384\n  \nCase  2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA  Document  227-18  Filed  03/25/20  Page3of27  PageID \n#:5422 \nORR  Background \nThe  Office  of  Refugee  Resettlement  (ORR)  is  committed \nto  helping  refugees  and  other  vulnerable  populations \ntransition  into  their  new  lives  in  the  United  States  by \nproviding  benefits,  services  and  linkages  that  enable \nthem  to  achieve  self-sufficiency  and  become  integrated \nmembers  of  U.S.  society. \nORR  is  part  of  the  U.S.  Department  of  Health  and \nHuman  Services’  (HHS)  Administration  for  Children  & \nFamilies  (ACF) \nSee  hiarear  ils \nPage385\n  \nCase  2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA  Document  227-18  Filed  03/25/20  Page  4of27  PageID \n#:5423 \nWho  are  UAC?

I  am  an  attorney  licensed to  practice  law in the  State  of California.  I  am a Retired \nAssistant County  Counsel  from  Los  Angeles  County.  I  retired  in  March of 2014.  For the  last  15 \nyears  of county  service,  I  managed  the  Dependency  Division in  Los  Angeles  County.  The \nDependency  Division handles  child  abuse and neglect  cases  for the  Los  Angeles  County \nDepartment  of Children  and  Family  Services.  We had  120  attorneys  handling  approximately \n-  25,000  dependency  cases  and  appeals.  The  attorneys  staffed 20  courts  and  would  routinely \nhandle  over  1,000  matters  each court day.  I  am very  familiar with  laws  and  time  lines  relating to \n-  children  detained by  and  placed in  custody  of California child welfare agencies. \n3.  In  preparation  for this  declaration,  I  have  reviewed  a time  line  provided to  me by \n-  Attorney  Carlos  Holguin.  I  have  been  asked to  analyze the time  frames  and  circumstances  of the \n       \n-  child J.M.R.R.’s  detention based  upon  federal  and  state  laws  applicable to  the  detention  of \n,  dependent  children and timelines  child  protection agencies  typically  follow when placing \nchildren with  a non-offending parent  after they have been removed  from  an  unfit home.  I  am not \n-  familiar with federal  immigration  laws  or how dependency  law may  be  applicable to  the  instant \nso  case. \n.  4,  I  am  informed  and believe  that the J.M.R.R has  been  detained  in  a non-licensed \nfacility  since  September  18,  2017.  I  am  also  informed  and believe that the  child’s mother is  an \n-  appropriate  custodian  and  is  willing to  provide  care  and  supervision for the  child.  I  am  informed \nthat there  was  a home  study  conducted  on the mother’s  home  on  or about  October  30,  2017.  The \n°  home  study  recommended release to  the child’s  mother.  The  results  of the  home  study  were \n~  received  December 27,  2017. \n-  3.  Child welfare  is  state managed  and  federally  funded.  Many  of the  state  laws \nte  designed to  expedite placement of children  are mandated  by  the  federal  funding  statute \ncommonly  called the  Adoptions  and  Safe  Families  Act.  The requisite  components  of all  state \niE \n Declaration of Ja mes M.

Pursuant to this  statute,  child welfare agencies  are \nrequired to  place children with  appropriate parents quickly.  Prior to  detaining children  from \ntheir parents,  the  agency  is  required to provide  “reasonable efforts” to prevent or eliminate the \n* || need to remove the  child  from  a parent.  See 42  U.S.C.  §  671(a)(15).  This  is codified  in \nCalifornia law at  Welfare and Institutions  Code  section 309,  which provides that the  social \n© || worker shall  “immediately release the child to the custody of the child’s parent” unless the child \nhas no parent willing to provide care,  social  worker believes that the  child’s detention  is a matter \nof immediate and urgent necessity  for the protection of the  child, the parent,  guardian  or \n° || custodian is  a flight risk,  the  child has left a placement in  which he or she  was placed by the \n10 \njuvenile  court,  the parent or person having legal  custody has voluntarily  surrendered physical \n11  |)  custody. \nae  6.  The time frames  for dependency hearings  are very quick.  If the  social  worker \n‘3 || decides to  detain  a child.  The  social worker must file a  petition with the court within 48  hours  of \n‘4 || the  child’s  detention.  See  Welfare and  Institutions Code  sections  313.  A hearing is  scheduled on \n* | |    the next court day  after the petition is  filed with the  court.  See  Welfare and Institutions  Code    \n  \n‘© || section 315.  The judge considers the  grounds  for detention.  If there  are no  legal  grounds  for \n‘7 || detention,  the court shall  order the release of the  child from custody.  See  Welfare and \n‘8 || Institutions  Code  section 319(b). \noa  7.  Were  state child welfare  agencies involved,  the  instant case would have presented \n*° || issues  involving the  Interstate  Compact on the placement of children  as  it involved a home  study \n“1 |) conducted  in  Florida.  This  may have  delayed placement were this a California child dependency \n22 |! case  as the  local  agency  would be dependent on  a Florida agency to  complete the home  study. \n23 || Even  so, the  statute  contemplates a state  conducting a home  study  for another state pursuant to \n°* || the  Interstate  Compact will  complete the home  study in  60  days.  See  Cal.  Fam.  Code  section \n° || 7901.1.  When another state requests  Los  Angeles County to perform  a home  study under the \n2© || Interstate  Compact,  Los  Angeles  would take  all  steps to  complete the home  study within the time \n27 \nperiod contained in  Family  Code  section  7901.1.  When  Los Angeles  County receives  a \ncompleted home  study from another state  approving placement with a parent,  Los Angeles  would \n2 \n Declaration of Ja mes M.

The Adoption and  Safe \nFamilies Act requires  all  states receiving federal  funds to have “orderly and timely interstate \n> || placement of children” 42  United  Sates  Code  section  671 (25).  The federal  law further requires \nthat the receiving  state  conduct and  complete the home assessment within 60  days.  42  United \n> || Sates  Code  section 671(26). \n2  8.  If the  state placing a child  is not requesting  supervision by the receiving state, \nhowever,  the Interstate  Compact would not be applicable to  a placement with  a parent.  In these \ncircumstances, the child welfare  agencies may handle  such placements  without the  delays \nassociated with coordinating  interstate placement with the receiving  state.  In  Los Angeles \n‘0 || County, these placements  are often effectuated before the 48-hour time for the filing of the \n11 || petition expires. \n18  9.  I  am  advised that ORR may be continuing J.M.R.R.  in  federal  custody because no \n13 \none  in his mother’s household is  a licensed driver.  In my experience, the  lack of access to  a \n14 || motor vehicle would not justify the continued detention of a health teen age  child.  If \n*° ||     transportation was  necessary,  the  child welfare  agency would typically provide public \n  \n*© || transportation vouchers to  the  family to  provide transportation  for the  child. \noe  10.  The goal  of child  welfare  is to  place children  is  safe,  nurturing environments  in a \n18 || timely fashion.  The Adoption and  Safe  Act requires placements  foster families,  relatives and \n19 \nother nonparents to meet licensing standards required of foster placements.  These  include \n20 || criminal  history checks  on prospective care providers.  42  United  States  Code  sections  671(19) \n21 || and 671(20). \nae  11.  Continued detention in a non-licensed placement  is very problematic  in \n*° || circumstances  where the  child could be placed with a parent who has no history  of abuse, \n24 || neglect,  or  unfitness,  nor any  legal  impediment to receiving custody.  Childhood  is  short,  and \n*° || children  should receive parenting  in  a nurturing,  permanent relationship.  Too  frequently children \n26 \nare placed  in institutional  settings where their day  to  day care  is provided by  a series  of adult \n“7 || caretakers  who  lack any permanent connection to the children they care  for.

R. Civ. P. 65 and Local Rule 7-\n3  19, Plaintiffs in the above-captioned matter, hereby apply ex parte to this Court for a \n4  temporary restraining order (“TRO”) and for issuance of an order to show cause why a \n5  preliminary injunction should not issue. This ex parte application is based upon this \n6  Application,  the  accompanying  Memorandum  of  Points  and  Authorities,  the \n7  concurrently-filed Declaration of Class Counsel Carlos Holguín and all exhibits thereto, \n8  all papers on file in this action, and any oral argument of counsel the Court may hear. \n9  The Memorandum of Points and Authorities in support of this Application is filed \n10  herewith.  \n11  The Plaintiffs bring this application on an ex parte basis because, as described in \n12  the Motion attached, by continuing to house Class Members in congregate care facilities \n13  in  the  face  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  public  health  national  emergency, \n \n14  Defendants Alex Azar, Secretary of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, \n15  and E. Scott Lloyd, Director, Office of Refugee Resettlement of the U.S. Department \n16  of  Health  and  Human  Services  (“ORR”),  violate  (i)  the  TVPRA,  8  U.S.C.  § \n17  1232(c)(2)(A),1 (ii) the January 17, 1997 Settlement Agreement in Flores v. Reno et al., \n18  CV 85-4544 (RJK) (Px), and (iii) the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. As \n19  a result, Class Members (and the public) face grave risk to their health and lives that is \n20  in  need  of  immediate  attention  in  order  to  avoid  further  loss  of  life.  Plaintiffs \n21  respectfully submit that ex parte relief is therefore appropriate given that the facts in the \n22  Motion and its supporting papers evidence that immediate and irreparable injury will \n23  result to Plaintiffs before opposition can be heard. \n24  Statement of Compliance with Rule with Civil Local Rule 7-19 \n25  Counsel for Defendants are: \nAndrew Brenner Insenga \n26 \nErnesto Molina \n27 \n                                           \n1 William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, \n28 \nPub.

[Doc. ## 71, 75.]  The Court deems this matter \nappropriate for decision without oral argument.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 78(b); C.D. Cal. L.R. 7-15. \n \nGabriela N. asserts that the following confer jurisdiction upon this Court:  (1) Paragraph 37 \nof the Flores Agreement, (2) the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), and (3) 28 U.S.C. section \n2241.2  See Reply re Gabriela N.’s MPI at 15–19 [Doc. # 75].  Yet, Paragraph 37 does not authorize \nthe relief Gabriela N. seeks and the APA is not an independent jurisdictional basis for her motion.  \nSee Order re Lucas R.’s MPI at 4–6, 8–9 [Doc. # 79].  Further, insofar as Gabriela N. invokes the \nfederal habeas statute, her immediate custodian is Niky Hymel, the ORR Federal Field Specialist \nresponsible for supervising the facility in which Gabriela N. has been confined.  See De La Cruz \nDecl. at ¶ 3 [Doc. # 73-1]; Order re Lucas R.’s MPI at 6–9 [Doc. # 79].  Because this official is \nlocated in the Southern District of Texas, see De La Cruz Decl. at ¶ 3 [Doc. # 73-1]; 28 U.S.C. \n§ 124(b)(2), this Court lacks jurisdiction over Gabriela N.’s habeas claims.  See Order re Lucas \nR.’s MPI at 6–9 [Doc. # 79].    \n \n                                                 \n1 Although Gabriela N.’s Notice of Motion requests “a preliminary injunction against Defendants’ continuing \nto detain Plaintiff Gabriela N. in lieu of release to her next friend and grandfather, Isaac N.,” Notice of Gabriela N.’s \nMPI at 3 [Doc. # 48], her proposed order seeks placement with Isaac, see Proposed Order re Gabriela N.’s MPI at 3 \n[Doc. # 48-34].  This distinction is immaterial, as ORR’s decision not to release a minor constitutes a “placement” \ndetermination.  See Order re Lucas R.’s MPI at 4–5 [Doc. # 79].  \n \n2 Gabriela N. further argues that the TVPRA and 28 U.S.C. section 1331 authorize this Court to release her \nfrom custody.  See Reply re Gabriela N.’s MPI at 17–19 [Doc. # 75].  For the reasons discussed in the Order re Lucas \nR.’s MPI, the Court rejects that contention.  See Order re Lucas R.’s MPI at 3 n.3 [Doc. # 79].   \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 82   Filed 09/10/18   Page 2 of 2   Page ID #:3113\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741-DMG (PLAx)  Date  September 10, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v.

This Order in no way precludes Gabriela N. from seeking \nappropriate relief in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas against \nORR Federal Field Specialist Niky Hymel. \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n ",

[Doc. # 81.]  The \nFAC alleges that ORR pursues certain policies and/or practices relating to the detention of \nundocumented immigrant or refugee minors that purportedly violate:  the consent decree entered \nin  Flores  v.  Sessions,  No.  85-4544-DMG  (AGRx)  (C.D.  Cal.)  [Doc.  # 101]  (“Flores \nAgreement”),  the  William  Wilberforce  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization  Act \n(“TVPRA”), the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and the Freedom of Association \nClause of the First Amendment.  See FAC at ¶¶ 2–3, 4.a–d.  The FAC further claims that ORR \npursues certain policies and/or practices that discriminate against undocumented minors on the \nbasis  of  their  actual  or  perceived  disabilities,  which  allegedly  violate  Section  504  of  the \nRehabilitation Act.  See id. at ¶¶ 4.e–f, 192–94. \n \n  On September 28, 2018, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss or Transfer (“MTD”) \n[Doc. # 101] and Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Class Certification.

Alex Azar, et al.  Page  2 of 28 \n   \n \nI. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND1 \n   \n  Plaintiffs Lucas R., Daniela Marisol T., Gabriela N., Miguel Angel S., Jaime D., Sirena \nP., and Benjamin F. (collectively, “Individual Plaintiffs”)2 are undocumented minors who are or \nrecently were in ORR’s custody.3  See FAC at ¶¶ 10–16.  Plaintiff San Fernando Valley Refugee \nChildren Center (“Children Center”) is a non-profit organization that has its principal place of \nbusiness in North Hills, California.  Id. at ¶ 17.  The Children Center’s mission is to provide \ncomprehensive social services (e.g., mental health care, shelter, transitional living assistance, and \nlegal  aid)  to  children,  youth,  and  families  who  entered  the  country  to  seek  refuge  from \npersecution and endemic violence in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala.  Id.  Plaintiff \nUnaccompanied Central American Refugee Empowerment (“UCARE”) is an unincorporated \nconsortium  of  non-profit  agencies  that  has  its  principal  place  of  business  in  Los  Angeles, \nCalifornia; most of the non-profit agencies belonging to UCARE are incorporated in California.  \nId. at ¶ 19.  UCARE’s mission is to advocate for and provide legal and social services to \nimmigrant and refugee minors, many of whom are or have been in ORR or Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement (“ICE”) custody.  Id.  To the extent that ORR implements any policies or \npractices that deny or delay the release of minors in the agency’s custody, such conduct denies or \ndelays  UCARE’s  member  organizations’  opportunity  to  serve  those  minors.    See  id.    The \nChildren Center’s and UCARE’s ability to raise funds depends in part on the raw number of \nchildren and youth to whom they provide services.  See id. at ¶¶ 18–19.  ORR has placed many \nminors in communities that the Children Center and UCARE serve (e.g., in federal fiscal year \n2018, ORR placed more than 1,100 alien minors in Los Angeles).  See id. at ¶ 20. \n \n                                                 \n1 The Court assumes the truth of the FAC’s allegations solely for the purpose of deciding Defendants’ \nMTD for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.  See infra Part II.A.  With regard to \nDefendant’s MTD for lack of venue, the Court presumes that the FAC’s averments are true to the extent they are not \ncontradicted by extrinsic evidence.  See id.  Lastly, the FAC’s averments may be considered in connection with \nPlaintiff’s Motion for Class Certification to the extent that they are supported by extrinsic evidence or are \nundisputed.  See infra Part III.B. \n \n2 The Court previously granted the Individual Plaintiffs leave to proceed in this matter under pseudonyms.  \nOrder re Ex Parte Application for Leave to Proceed Using Pseudonyms [Doc. # 92]. \n \n3 The TVPRA provides that HHS is responsible for the custody of all unaccompanied alien children.  See 8 \nU.S.C. § 1232(b)(1).  ORR is the division of HHS that has been entrusted with that responsibility.  See Saravia v. \nSessions, 280 F. Supp. 3d 1168, 1178 (N.D. Cal. 2017). \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 126   Filed 11/02/18   Page 3 of 28   Page ID #:4304\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741 DMG (PLAx)  Date  November 2, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v. Alex Azar, et al.  Page  3 of 28 \n   \n \n  Plaintiffs allege that ORR has adopted and implemented the following six policies and/or \npractices in violation the Flores Agreement, the TVPRA, the Due Process Clause, the Freedom \nof Association Clause, and/or Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act: \n \n(a)  ORR confines children in medium[-]secure facilities, residential treatment \ncenters  (“RTCs”),  and  secure  facilities  peremptorily,  often  on  bare \nallegations they are dangerous or pose a flight risk, without affording them \na  meaningful  opportunity  to  be  heard  regarding  the  reasons  for  such \nplacement; \n(b)  ORR prolongs children’s detention on the ground that their parents or \nother available custodians are or may be unfit, while affording neither \ndetained juveniles nor their proposed custodians a meaningful or timely \nopportunity to be heard regarding a proposed custodian’s fitness; \n(c)  ORR places children in [RTCs] and detention facilities in which it knows \nthey will be administered powerful psychotropic medications for weeks, \nmonths,  or  years,  without  procedural  safeguards,  including  seeking \ninformed parental consent or other lawful authorization, even from parents \npresent in the United States[;] \n(d)  ORR blocks lawyers from representing detained children with respect to \nplacement, non-consensual administration of psychotropic medications, or \nrelease to available custodians notwithstanding that Congress has allocated \nfunds specifically to provide such lawyers to represent children who are or \nhave been in ORR custody in “legal matters,” including issues related to \nrelease and [placement in the least-restrictive setting]; \n(e)  ORR segregates children who have or are perceived to have a behavioral, \nmental  health,  intellectual,  and/or  developmental  disability  in  secure \nfacilities,  medium[-]secure  facilities,  and  RTCs,  instead  of  the  most \nintegrated setting appropriate to their needs; and \n(f)  ORR[] prolong[s] the detention of children who have or are perceived to \nhave  a  behavioral,  mental  health,  intellectual,  and/or  developmental \ndisability  by  placing  them  in  restrictive  settings  associated  with \nheightened administrative barriers to release. \n \nSee id. at ¶¶ 4.a–e. \n \n  The FAC asserts five causes of action, which challenge ORR’s policies and/or practices \nconcerning the agency’s:  (1) determinations of potential custodians’ fitness; (2) placement of \nminors  in  RTCs,  secure  facilities,  and  medium-secure  facilities;  (3)  administration  of \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 126   Filed 11/02/18   Page 4 of 28   Page ID #:4305\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741 DMG (PLAx)  Date  November 2, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v.

See id. at 54–57.   \n \nII. \nLEGAL STANDARDS \n \nA.  Motion to Dismiss \n \n  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), a defendant may raise either a facial or a \nfactual challenge to a federal court’s subject matter jurisdiction.  White v. Lee, 227 F.3d 1214, \n1242 (9th Cir. 2000).  “In a facial attack, the challenger asserts that the allegations contained in a \ncomplaint are insufficient on their face to invoke federal jurisdiction.  By contrast, in a factual \nattack, the challenger disputes the truth of the allegations that, by themselves, would otherwise \ninvoke federal jurisdiction.”  Safe Air for Everyone v. Meyer, 373 F.3d 1035, 1039 (9th Cir. \n2004).  When resolving a facial attack, a court “presume[s] the truthfulness of the plaintiff’s \nallegations” and determines whether they establish that subject matter jurisdiction is proper.  See \nid.  Defendants raise a facial attack to the Children Center’s and UCARE’s Article III standing to \nbring suit.  See MTD at 10–14.4 \n \n  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3) allows a defendant to challenge a complaint for \nimproper venue.  In considering such a motion, “[the] pleadings need not be accepted as true, \nand facts outside the pleadings may be considered.”  Doe 1 v. AOL LLC, 552 F.3d 1077, 1081 \n(9th Cir. 2009).  Once venue is challenged, a plaintiff bears the burden of showing that venue is \nproper.  Piedmont Label Co. v. Sun Garden Packing Co., 598 F.2d 491, 496 (9th Cir. 1979).  If \nthe Court determines that venue is improper, it “shall dismiss, or if it be in the interest of justice, \ntransfer such case to any district or division in which it could have been brought.”  28 U.S.C. \n§ 1406(a); see also King v. Russell, 963 F.2d 1301, 1304–05 (9th Cir. 1992) (holding that the \ndecision to dismiss or transfer for improper venue is committed to the sound discretion of the \ndistrict court). \n \n  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a defendant may seek to dismiss a \ncomplaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  \nTo survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a complaint must articulate “enough facts to state a claim to \nrelief that is plausible on its face.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). \nAlthough a pleading need not contain “detailed factual allegations,” it must contain “more than \n                                                 \n4 All page references herein are to page numbers inserted by the CM/ECF system. \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 126   Filed 11/02/18   Page 5 of 28   Page ID #:4306\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741 DMG (PLAx)  Date  November 2, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v.

Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  In evaluating the sufficiency of a complaint, courts \nmust accept all factual allegations as true.  Id. (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555).  Legal \nconclusions, in contrast, are not entitled to the assumption of truth.  Id.   \n \nB.  Motion for Class Certification \n \n  A district court has broad discretion in making a class certification determination under \nRule 23.  Navellier v. Sletten, 262 F.3d 923, 941 (9th Cir. 2001); see also Reiter v. Sonotone \nCorp., 442 U.S. 330, 345 (1979) (district courts “have broad power and discretion vested in them \nby Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23”).  Nonetheless, a court must exercise its discretion “within the \nframework of Rule 23.”  Navellier, 262 F.3d at 941. \n   \nThe following prerequisites must be met before a court may certify a class under Rule 23: \n \n(1)  the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; \n(2)  there are questions of law or fact common to the class; \n(3)  the  claims  or  defenses  of  the  representative parties  are  typical  of  the \nclaims or defenses of the class; and \n(4)  the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of \nthe class. \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).   \n \n  In addition to Rule 23(a)’s prerequisites, a party moving for class certification must also \nsatisfy one of the criteria of Rule 23(b).  Rule 23(b)(2) authorizes certification if “the party \nopposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that \nfinal injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a \nwhole[.]” \n \n  “The party seeking class certification bears the burden of establishing that the proposed \nclass meets the requirements of Rule 23.”  Edwards v. First Am. Corp., 798 F.3d 1172, 1177 (9th \nCir. 2015).  Certification is properly granted only if “after a rigorous analysis[,]” the district \ncourt concludes that Rule 23’s requirements have been satisfied.  See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. \nDukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350–51 (2011).  In conducting this analysis, “[m]erits questions may be \nconsidered to the extent—but only to the extent—that they are relevant to determining whether \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 126   Filed 11/02/18   Page 6 of 28   Page ID #:4307\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741 DMG (PLAx)  Date  November 2, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v.

Plans \n& Trust Funds, 568 U.S. 455, 466 (2013)).     \n \nIII. \nDISCUSSION \n   \nA.  Defendants’ MTD \n \n  Defendants’ MTD raises the following arguments:  (1) the Children Center and UCARE \nlack Article III standing to bring suit; (2) the Court should dismiss or transfer this action on the \nbasis of improper venue; and (3) the FAC fails to state claims for relief under the Flores \nAgreement, the TVPRA, the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), the Due Process Clause, \nand Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  See MTD at 8, 23–30.  The Court addresses each of \nthese arguments in turn. \n \n1.  The Children Center’s and UCARE’s Article III Standing \n \n  “The three well-known ‘irreducible constitutional minim[a] of standing’ are injury-in-\nfact, causation, and redressability.”  Davidson v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., 889 F.3d 956, 967 (9th \nCir. 2018) (alteration in original) (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 \n(1992)).  “A plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that her injury-in-fact is ‘concrete, \nparticularized, and actual or imminent; fairly traceable to the challenged action; and redressable \nby a favorable ruling.’”  Id. (quoting Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms, 561 U.S. 139, 149 \n(2010)). \n \n  Defendants  argue  that  the  Children  Center’s  and  UCARE’s  alleged  injuries  are \nspeculative.  Specifically, they contend that the FAC “assumes that some child in ORR custody \nmay eventually use their services for which they may receive funds or for which they may have \nto provide extra treatment,” and that these two organizational Plaintiffs “suffer no injury from \nthe alleged delay” in the release of alien minors because the children “would eventually be \nserved  by  the  organization[s].”    See  MTD  at  12.    Consequently,  Defendants  contend  that \nPlaintiffs have failed to establish that ORR’s policies and/or practices have negatively impacted \nthe funding of these two organizations, which depends in part on the number of minors they \nserve.5  See id. at 12–14.  \n                                                 \n5 Defendants also suggest that the FAC fails to supply sufficient detail regarding “how these organizations \nraise their funds.”  See Reply re MTD at 8.  The Court rejects this argument because it is entirely plausible that the \nChildren Center’s and UCARE’s donors would be inclined to provide additional funding if these organizations were \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 126   Filed 11/02/18   Page 7 of 28   Page ID #:4308\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741 DMG (PLAx)  Date  November 2, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v. Alex Azar, et al.  Page  7 of 28 \n   \n \nThe  FAC  alleges  that  “ORR  has  placed  many  unaccompanied  children  in  the \ncommunities that the Children Center and UCARE serve” and “ORR placed more than 1,100 \nunaccompanied children in Los Angeles alone” in fiscal year 2018.  See FAC at ¶ 20.  Further, \nthe FAC alleges that UCARE serves “immigrant and refugee minors . . . [who] are or have been \nin ORR” custody, and that ORR denies or delays their release.  See id. at ¶ 19.  These allegations \nplausibly  demonstrate  that  ORR’s  conduct  interferes  with  UCARE’s  ability  to  serve \nundocumented minors who are or have been in the agency’s custody.  See Davidson, 889 F.3d at \n969–70 (holding that plausible allegations of future harm are sufficient to establish standing at \nthe pleading stage).  Further, Defendants’ argument entirely neglects one crucial fact—i.e., \ndelays  in  obtaining  funding  have  concrete  financial  consequences  for  UCARE.    See,  e.g., \nAppalachian Reg’l Healthcare v. Coventry Health & Life Ins. Co., 970 F. Supp. 2d 687, 696 \n(E.D. Ky. 2013) (concluding that a delay in payment gives rise to an injury-in-fact).  It follows \nthat UCARE has pled an injury-in-fact that is fairly traceable to ORR’s policies and/or practices \nthat deny or delay the release of alien minors, and redressable by an order enjoining such \nconduct.   \n \nAdditionally, the FAC avers that to accomplish its mission to provide comprehensive \nsocial services to refugee minors from Central America, the Children Center has been forced to \ndivert its limited resources to remedying the mental and physical trauma these minors have \nsuffered  as  a  result  of  their  prolonged  detention  and  forced  consumption  of  psychotropic \nmedication while in ORR’s custody.  See FAC at ¶¶ 17–18.  Plaintiffs claim that this diversion of \nresources has reduced the number of undocumented minors and youth the Children Center is able \nto assist, thereby inhibiting its ability to raise funds.  See id. at ¶ 18.  These assertions give rise to \nthe plausible inference that ORR’s policies and/or practices have caused the Children Center to \nsuffer an injury-in-fact that would be mitigated if the agency ceased its allegedly unlawful \nconduct.  See La Asociacion de Trabajadores de Lake Forest v. City of Lake Forest, 624 F.3d \n1083, 1088 (9th Cir. 2010) (“An organization suing on its own behalf can establish an injury \nwhen it suffered ‘both a diversion of resources and a frustration of its mission.’”) (quoting Fair \nHous. of Marin v. Combs, 285 F.3d 899, 902 (9th Cir. 2002))). \n \nIn sum, the Court concludes that the Children Center and UCARE have sufficiently pled \nArticle III standing.        \n \n                                                                                                                                                             \nable to serve more alien minors.  See FAC at ¶¶ 18–19; Public Lands for the People, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 697 \nF.3d 1192, 1196 (9th Cir. 2012) (if there is a facial challenge to standing, a court must “accept all factual allegations \nof the complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party” (quoting Bernhardt v. \nCty. of L.A., 279 F.3d 862, 867 (9th Cir. 2002)).    \n \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 126   Filed 11/02/18   Page 8 of 28   Page ID #:4309\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741 DMG (PLAx)  Date  November 2, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v. Alex Azar, et al.  Page  8 of 28 \n   \n \n2.  Venue \n \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs have filed suit in an improper venue.  Under 28 U.S.C. \nsection 1391(e)(1), a civil action against an officer of a federal agency may be brought in any \njudicial district in which “(A) a defendant in the action resides, (B) a substantial part of the \nevents or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property that is the \nsubject of the action is situated, or (C) the plaintiff resides if no real property is involved in the \naction.”  For the purposes of this general venue statute, “an entity with the capacity to sue and be \nsued in its common name under applicable law, whether or not incorporated, shall be deemed to \nreside, . . . if a plaintiff, only in the judicial district in which it maintains its principal place of \nbusiness.”  See 28 U.S.C. § 1391(c)(2). \n \nIt is undisputed that the Children Center is a California corporation that has its principal \nplace of business in this district (i.e., in North Hills, California), FAC at ¶ 17, and that UCARE is \nan unincorporated entity that has its principal place of business in this district as well (i.e., in Los \nAngeles, California, id. at ¶ 19.6  Because several (but not all) Plaintiffs reside in this district, \nvenue is proper under 28 U.S.C. section 1391(e)(1)(C).  See Immigrant Assistance Project of \nL.A. Cty. v. Immigration & Naturalization Serv., 306 F.3d 842, 868 (9th Cir. 2002) (“A civil \naction . . . in which a defendant is an agency of the United States and in which no real property is \ninvolved,  may  be  brought,  inter  alia,  in  any  judicial  district  in  which  a  plaintiff  resides.”  \n(emphasis added)); Railway Labor Executives Ass’n v. Interstate Commerce Comm’n, 958 F.2d \n252, 256 (9th Cir. 1991) (holding that “venue need be proper for only one plaintiff” under \nSection 1391(e)). \n \nDefendants nonetheless insist that venue is improper because the Children Center and \nUCARE are not members of the putative classes (i.e., children in ORR custody).7  See MTD at \n10, 17, 20 n.3.  Yet, the Court has already concluded that these two Plaintiffs have Article III \nstanding to raise their claims.  See supra Part III.A.1.  Furthermore, the Children Center and \nUCARE are properly joined in this action because all named Plaintiffs challenge the same \npolicies and practices.  See FAC at ¶¶ 4–5, 17–20; see also Immigrant Assistance Project, 306 \n                                                 \n6 The parties do not dispute that the Children Center and UCARE have the capacity to bring suit under \napplicable law. \n \n7 Plaintiffs argue that the Children Center and UCARE may serve as class representatives because “the \nchildren and the youth they serve are the functional equivalent of their members.”  See Reply re Mot. for Class Cert. \nat 18–19.  This assertion is puzzling, given that the Children Center is a non-profit corporation that presumably does \nnot have any “members,” and UCARE’s members are non-profit agencies.  See FAC at ¶¶ 17–19.  The Court need \nnot resolve this issue because it concludes that the Individual Plaintiffs can serve as class representatives.  See infra \nPart III.B.3–4. \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 126   Filed 11/02/18   Page 9 of 28   Page ID #:4310\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741 DMG (PLAx)  Date  November 2, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v.

R. Civ. P. 20(a)(1) (“Persons may \njoin in one action as plaintiffs if: . . . they assert any right to relief jointly, severally, or in the \nalternative  with  respect  to  or  arising  out  of  the  same  transaction,  occurrence,  or  series  of \ntransactions or occurrences; and . . . any question of law or fact common to all plaintiffs will \narise in the action.”).  Therefore, the Court shall not dismiss this action for improper venue.8 \n \n3.  Claims Under the Flores Agreement  \n \nDefendants  argue  that  the  Court  should  dismiss  as  duplicative  any  claims  alleging \nviolations of the Flores Agreement.  See MTD at 24–25.  Plaintiffs counter that they are not \nrequired to litigate their Flores claims in that action because Paragraph 37 of the Agreement \npurportedly permits them to file an independent “individual or class action” in this District \nCourt.  See Opp’n re MTD at 27–28.  Plaintiffs fail to recognize that the interests of judicial \neconomy counsel against permitting them to enforce the Flores Agreement in this action.  \n \n“Plaintiffs generally have ‘no right to maintain two separate actions involving the same \nsubject matter at the same time in the same court and against the same defendant.”  Adams v. \nCal. Dep’t of Health Servs., 487 F.3d 684, 688 (9th Cir. 2007), overruled in part on another \nground by Taylor v Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, 884–85, 904 (2008).  This prohibition on duplicative \nactions also extends to plaintiffs who are in privity with parties to the first suit.  See id. at 689.  \nGenerally, “[d]ismissal of the duplicative lawsuit, more so than the issuance of a stay or the \nenjoinment of proceedings, promotes judicial economy and the ‘comprehensive disposition of \nlitigation.’”  See id. at 693 (quoting Kerotest Mfg. Co. v. C-O-Two Fore Equip. Co., 342 U.S. \n180, 183 (1952)).  Whether the dismissal is with or without prejudice is committed to the district \ncourt’s sound discretion.  Id. at 692.   \n \n                                                 \n8 The Court need not address Defendants’ motion to transfer this action because it is predicated on their \nclaim that this district is an improper venue.  See MTD at 20–23.  To the extent Defendants contend that the action \nought to be transferred to the District of Columbia pursuant to 28 U.S.C. section 1404(a), that argument fails \nbecause they do not provide any evidentiary support for the only factor they claim weighs in favor of transfer—i.e., \nthe convenience of the witnesses and location of books and records.  See MTD at 22; see also E. & J. Gallo Winery \nv. F. & P. S.p.A., 899 F. Supp. 465, 466 (E.D. Cal. 1994) (holding that the proponent of the transfer “bears a heavy \nburden of showing a clear balance of inconveniences to it[,]” and that “[a]ffidavits or declarations are required to \nidentify key witnesses and [provide] a generalized statement of their anticipated testimony”).  \n \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 126   Filed 11/02/18   Page 10 of 28   Page ID\n #:4311\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741 DMG (PLAx)  Date  November 2, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v. Alex Azar, et al.  Page  10 of 28 \n   \n \nIt is undisputed that the Individual Plaintiffs are members of the Flores Class, and that \nORR  is  a  party  to  that  action.9    See  FAC  at  ¶¶  2–3,  21–22;  Taylor,  553  U.S.  at  894 \n(“Representative suits with preclusive effect on nonparties include properly conducted class \nactions . . . .”).  There is also no dispute that the subject matter of Plaintiffs’ Flores claims and \nthe Flores Action are the same.  In their original Complaint, Plaintiffs admitted that the instant \naction is an “adjunct and supplement” to a motion to enforce that was filed in the Flores Action.  \nSee Compl. at ¶ 2 [Doc. # 1].  In resolving that motion, the Court found that ORR breached the \nFlores Agreement by:  (1) detaining certain Class Members in Shiloh RTC in violation of \nParagraphs 6, 7, 8, and 19 and Exhibit 1 of the Agreement, (2) failing to timely provide a written \nnotice of reasons for placing a Class Member in a secure facility, staff-secure facility, or RTC in \nviolation of Paragraph 24C of the Agreement, (3) placing certain Class Members in secure \nfacilities  in  violation  of  Paragraph  21  of  the  Agreement,  (4)  administering  psychotropic \nmedication to Class Members at Shiloh RTC in violation of Paragraphs 6 and 9 and Exhibit 1 of \nthe Agreement, and (5) undertaking certain policies that unnecessarily delay the release of Class \nMembers to custodians in violation of Paragraphs 14 and 18 of the Agreement.  See Order re \nPls.’ Mot. to Enforce at 30–32, Flores v. Sessions, No. CV 85-4544-DMG (AGRx) (C.D. Cal. \nJuly 30, 2018) [Doc. # 470].  Further, the parties in Flores continue to actively litigate whether \nORR,  ICE,  and  U.S.  Customs  and  Border  Patrol  have  complied  with  the  Agreement, \nnotwithstanding the fact that the Court issued the consent decree more than 20 years ago.

Oct. 5, 2018) [Doc. # 494]. \n \nBecause Plaintiffs’ claims under the Flores Agreement should be litigated only in that \naction, the Court DISMISSES without prejudice Plaintiffs’ first, second, third, and fourth causes \nof action to the extent that they seek enforcement of that Agreement.  Nonetheless, Plaintiffs \nmay pursue due process claims predicated on Defendants’ failure to provide sufficient procedural \n                                                 \n9 Although the Children Center and UCARE are not parties to the Flores Action, they are subject to the \nsame defenses as the Individual Plaintiffs because the Children Center and UCARE seek to assert the contractual \nrights of Flores Class Members.  See Ronay Family Ltd. P’ship v. Tweed, 216 Cal. App. 4th 830, 840 (2013) (“[A] \nthird party whose rights under a contract derive from those of a party to the contract [typically] cannot assert rights \ngreater than those of the contracting party . . . .”); O’Neil v.

Serv., \nInc. v. Paymaster Corp., 962 F.2d 853, 856 (9th Cir. 1992))).  In addition, while Defendant E. Scott Lloyd has not \nbeen sued in his individual capacity in the Flores Action, the only claim Plaintiffs bring against him in his personal \ncapacity is one under Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), \nsee FAC at ¶ 5, which authorizes damages claims for only constitutional violations (i.e., not breaches of consent \ndecrees), see F.E. Trotter, Inc. v. Watkins, 869 F.2d 1312, 1314 (9th Cir. 1989) (holding that Bivens claims are \navailable “[f]or certain constitutional violations”).

Plaintiffs’ TVPRA and APA Claims \n \n  Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ claims under the TVPRA fail because they have not \nshown that the statute creates a private right of action.  See MTD at 25.  Relatedly, Defendants \ncontend that Plaintiffs may not obtain a remedy under the APA because the FAC does not \nsufficiently allege the existence of a relevant “final agency action.”11  See id. at 28–29; Reply re \nMTD at 17; see also 5 U.S.C. § 704 (“Agency action made reviewable by statute and final \nagency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court are subject to judicial \nreview.”).  For the reasons discussed in this section, the Court concludes that the policies and/or \n                                                 \n10 Defendants apparently request the dismissal of all of Plaintiffs’ claims on the ground that they are \nduplicative of those pending in the Flores Action.  See Opp’n re Mot. for Class Cert. at 11 (asserting that the instant \naction is a “successive, identical class action” that includes “class members and claims identical in scope to an \nearlier certified class action” (emphasis added)).  Yet, the Court specifically declared that the only claims that may \nbe brought in the Flores Action are those arising under the Agreement.  See Order re Pls.’ Mot. to Enforce at 2–3, 5–\n6, Flores v. Sessions, No. CV 85-4544-DMG (AGRx) (C.D. Cal. July 30, 2018) [Doc. # 470].  To the extent that \nDefendants intended to assert a res judicata defense, the Court rejects that argument because they failed to cogently \nraise or brief that point.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 7(b)(1)(B) (“A request for a court order must be made by motion.  The \nmotion must: . . . state with particularity the grounds for seeking the order.”).      \n \n11 Although Plaintiffs’ first four causes of action assert that Defendants’ policies violate the APA, the FAC \ndoes not clarify whether Plaintiffs intend to raise any standalone APA claims that are not predicated on violations of \nother federal statutes, the federal constitution, or the Flores Agreement.  See FAC at ¶¶ 181, 184, 187, 190; see also \nOpp’n re MTD 30–31 (asserting in passing that “ORR’s challenged policies and practices are final and directly \nviolate the APA[,]” but failing to articulate a standalone APA claim).  Accordingly, the Court will limit its inquiry to \nwhether the FAC satisfies the procedural prerequisites to suit under the APA.  See also Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static \nControl Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 131 (2014) (noting that the APA has an “omnibus judicial-review \nprovision, which permits suit for violations of numerous statutes of varying character that do not themselves include \ncauses of action for judicial review”). \n \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 126   Filed 11/02/18   Page 12 of 28   Page ID\n #:4313\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741 DMG (PLAx)  Date  November 2, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v.

And second, the action must be one by which “rights or \nobligations have been determined,” or from which “legal consequences will flow.”’”  Western \nRadio Servs. Co. v. Glickman, 123 F.3d 1189, 1196 (9th Cir. 1997) (quoting Bennet v. Spear, \n520 U.S. 154, 178 (1997)).    \n \nThe FAC identifies several ORR policies and/or practices, which concern (inter alia) the \nplacement  of  undocumented  minors;  their  release  to  proposed  custodians;  the  forced \nconsumption of psychotropic medication; and blocking lawyers from representing minors in \nconnection  with  ORR’s  decisions  regarding  release,  placement,  and  non-consensual \nadministration of psychotropic medications.  See FAC at ¶¶ 4.a–d.  The FAC includes specific \nfactual  allegations  demonstrating  that  these  policies  and/or  practices  are  not  tentative  or \ninterlocutory in nature, as ORR has already implemented them.13  See, e.g., id. at ¶¶ 37–46 \n(alleging that ORR placed Daniela Marisol T. in Shiloh RTC without notice or an opportunity to \nbe heard, refused to release her to a custodian or provide any administrative means to challenge \nthat decision, and required her to take psychotropic medications without court or family member \n                                                 \n12 The FAC avers that “Plaintiffs have private rights of action against Defendants pursuant to . . . the \nAdministrative Procedure Act,” but it does not allege a cause of action under the TVPRA itself.  See FAC at ¶ 9.  \nYet, Plaintiffs’ Opposition to the MTD apparently argues that an implied private right of action exists under the \nTVPRA.  See Opp’n re MTD at 29.  Although Plaintiffs argue (inter alia) that “[n]othing in the enactment’s text or \nlegislative history suggests” that an implied private right of action would frustrate the underlying purpose of the \nTVPRA, they fail to cite any legislative materials in support of that proposition.  See id.  Notwithstanding Plaintiffs’ \nfailure to adequately show that the TVPRA creates a private right of action, the Court finds that, for the reasons \ndiscussed in this section, the APA still permits them to seek relief for violations of the TVPRA.  See 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A) (providing that a court shall set aside agency action found to be “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, otherwise not in accordance with law”).  Additionally, for the reasons discussed in this section, Plaintiffs \nmay assert their constitutional claims under the APA as well.  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B) (providing that a court shall \nset aside agency action found to be “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity”); Navajo Nation \nv. Dep’t of Interior, 876 F.3d 1144, 1168–72 (9th Cir. 2017) (holding that 5 U.S.C. section 704’s “final agency \naction” requirement applies to causes of action brought under the APA, whereas it is not a condition of 5 U.S.C. \nsection 702’s waiver of sovereign immunity). \n \n13 The Court is not persuaded by Defendants’ contention that these allegations are not sufficiently detailed \nto survive a motion to dismiss.  See Reply re MTD at 17; Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (“[T]he pleading standard Rule 8 \nannounces does not require ‘detailed factual allegations,’ but it demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-\nunlawfully-harmed-me accusation.”  (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555)).   \n \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 126   Filed 11/02/18   Page 13 of 28   Page ID\n #:4314\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741 DMG (PLAx)  Date  November 2, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v.

Moreover, the FAC avers that these \npolicies and/or practices violate Individual Plaintiffs’ and putative class members’ rights under \nthe TVPRA, the Due Process Clause, and the Freedom of Association Clause of the First \nAmendment.  See id. at ¶¶ 2–3.  Aside from their unpersuasive arguments that Plaintiffs did not \nadequately plead their procedural due process claims, see infra Part III.A.5, Defendants fail to \neven argue that such legal consequences do not flow from ORR’s conduct.  See Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 7(b)(1)(B).  The Court thus rejects Defendants’ contention that no private right of action exists \nby which Plaintiffs may obtain relief for ORR’s violations of the TVPRA.  Cf. L.V.M. v. Lloyd, \n318 F. Supp. 3d 601, 612 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (holding that ORR’s policy of requiring director-level \nreview before certain alien minors are released from custody was final agency action for the \npurposes of the APA because ORR had already adopted the policy and legal consequences \nflowed from it).     \n      \n5.  Plaintiffs’ Procedural Due Process Theories \n \n  Defendants contend that Plaintiffs’ procedural due process claims should be dismissed \nbecause:  (1) the FAC supposedly fails to identify any underlying substantive rights protected by \nthe  Due  Process  Clause,  and  (2)  undocumented  minors  are  not  entitled  to  any  procedural \nprotections  beyond  those  explicitly  provided  by  Congress.14    See  MTD  at  25–28.    These \ncontentions are entirely without merit. \n \n  “[P]rocedural due process . . . has three elements:  (1) a liberty or property interest \nprotected by the Constitution; (2) a deprivation of the interest by the government; (3) lack of \nprocess.”  Portman v. Cty. of Santa Clara, 995 F.2d 898, 904 (9th Cir. 1993).  A constitutionally \nprotected substantive interest may arise from the federal constitution itself, see Zadvydas v. \nDavis, 533 U.S. 678, 690 (2001), a statute, see Carver v. Lehman, 558 F.3d 869, 874–75 (9th \nCir. 2009), or a contract, see San Bernardino Physicians’ Servs. Med. Grp. v. Cty. of San \nBernardino, 825 F.2d 1404, 1407–08 (9th Cir. 1987); see also Smith v. Sumner, 994 F.2d 1401, \n1406 (9th Cir. 1993) (a consent decree can give rise to a constitutionally protected interest).  A \nstatute  may  create  a  substantive  interest  protected  by  the  Due  Process  Clause  by  using \n                                                 \n14 Although Defendants’ MTD discusses certain legal principles relating to the substantive component of \nthe Due Process Clause, it appears that Defendants challenge only Plaintiffs’ procedural due process claims.  See \nMTD at 25–26 (“The failure to plead a substantive right is fatal to the various procedural due process claims.”); \nReply re MTD at 18 (“Plaintiffs do not cite any legal authority to support their conclusory arguments that children in \nORR custody are entitled to constitutional procedural protections concerning their placement in licensed facilities \nand the prescription of psychotropic drugs.”). \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 126   Filed 11/02/18   Page 14 of 28   Page ID\n #:4315\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741 DMG (PLAx)  Date  November 2, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v. Alex Azar, et al.  Page  14 of 28 \n   \n \n“mandatory language” that imposes an obligation on government officials.  See Carver, 558 F.3d \nat 872–73.  Further, whether a contractual right is protected by the Due Process Clause depends \nupon “the security with which [the interest] is held under [the applicable] law and its importance \nto the holder.”  See San Bernardino Physicians’ Servs., 825 F.3d at 1409 (alteration in original) \n(quoting Brown v. Brienen, 722 F.2d 360, 364 (7th Cir. 1983)).  A contractual provision may be \nof sufficient importance if it can be “easily characterized as a civil right.”  See id. \n \n  Here, the FAC alleges that ORR’s policies and/or practices violate detained minors’ \nconstitutional rights to freedom from detention, familial association, and bodily integrity.  See \nFAC at ¶¶ 106–08, 116, 122–23, 137, 142; see also Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 690 (“Freedom from \nimprisonment—from government custody, detention, or other forms of physical restraint—lies at \nthe heart of the liberty [the Due Process] Clause protects.”); Rosenbaum v. Washoe Cty., 663 \nF.3d 1071, 1079 (9th Cir. 2011) (“The substantive due process right to family integrity or to \nfamilial association is well established.”); cf. United States v. Loughner, 672 F.3d 731, 744 (9th \nCir.  2012)  (“[I]nmates  possess  ‘a  significant  liberty  interest  in  avoiding  the  unwanted \nadministration of antipsychotic drugs under the Due Process Clause . . . .’” (quoting Washington \nv. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 221–22 (1980))).   \n \nPlaintiffs further allege that ORR’s refusal to promptly release undocumented minors; its \nplacement of children in secure facilities, medium-secure facilities, and RTCs; its decision to \ninvoluntarily medicate minors; and its interference with minors’ access to counsel violate the \nagency’s obligations under the TVPRA.  See FAC at ¶¶ 104, 108, 118–121, 133, 140–42, 146–\n52.  The provisions of the TVPRA upon  which Plaintiffs rely use mandatory language to \nprescribe the agency’s duties.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(2)(A) (“[A]n unaccompanied alien child in \nthe custody of [ORR] shall be promptly placed in the least restrictive setting that is in the best \ninterest of the child. . . .  A child shall not be placed in a secure facility absent a determination \nthat the child poses a danger to self or others or otherwise has been charged with having \ncommitted a criminal offense.” (emphasis added)); id. § 1232(c)(5) (“[ORR] . . . shall ensure . . . \nthat all unaccompanied alien children [from non-contiguous countries] have counsel to represent \nthem in legal proceedings or matters and to protect them from mistreatment, exploitation, and \ntrafficking.” (emphasis added)).   \n \nFurthermore, the FAC relies upon provisions of the Flores Agreement that require the \nprompt release of alien minors to proposed custodians, the placement of children in non-secure \nlicensed facilities, and adherence to all applicable state child welfare laws and regulations.  See \nFAC at ¶¶ 103, 117, 132, 134; Flores Agreement at ¶¶ 6, 14, 18–19, Ex. 1 at ¶ A.  These \nprotections are secured by a consent decree and constitute civil rights because they are akin to \nthe constitutional and statutory rights discussed above.  See Smith, 994 F.2d at 1406 (“‘[I]t would \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 126   Filed 11/02/18   Page 15 of 28   Page ID\n #:4316\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741 DMG (PLAx)  Date  November 2, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v.

Ventetuolo, 941 F.2d 22, 28 (1st Cir. 1991))).  Therefore, the Court concludes \nthat Plaintiffs have satisfactorily identified the substantive rights underlying their procedural due \nprocess claims. \n \n  Defendants’ second argument is inapt because it relies upon cases involving procedures \nfor the admission or exclusion of aliens.  See Shaughnessy v. United states ex re. Mezei, 345 U.S. \n206, 212 (1953) (“It is true that aliens who have once passed through our gates, even illegally, \nmay  be  expelled  only  after  proceedings  conforming  to  traditional  standards  of  fairness \nencompassed in due process of law.  But an alien on the threshold of initial entry stands on a \ndifferent footing:  ‘Whatever the procedure authorized by Congress is, it is due process as far as \nan alien denied entry is concerned.’” (citations omitted) (quoting United States ex rel. Knauff v. \nShaughnessy, 338 U.S. 537, 544 (1950))); Angov v. Lynch, 788 F.3d 893, 898 (9th Cir. 2015) \n(“[The alien] has no . . . right [to procedural due process].  He presented himself at the San \nYsidro port of entry without valid entry documents and sought asylum. . . . [T]hose, like [the \nalien], who have never technically ‘entered’ the United States have no such rights.” (emphasis \nadded)); United States v. Barajas-Alvarado, 655 F.3d 1077, 1084 (9th Cir. 2011) (“We have . . . \nheld that non-admitted aliens are not entitled to any procedure vis-á-vis their admission or \nexclusion.” (emphasis added)).  Because these decisions relate to the admission or exclusion of \naliens, they do not establish that the children in ORR’s custody have no entitlement to additional \nprocedures that limit the agency’s authority to detain them, place them in certain restrictive \nsettings, administer psychotropic medication to them against their will, or block their access to \ncounsel.  See, e.g., Hernandez v. Sessions, 872 F.3d 976, 990 n.17 (9th Cir. 2017) (“Although the \nSupreme Court has described Congress’s power over the ‘policies and rules for exclusion of \naliens’ as ‘plenary,’ . . . it is well-established that the Due Process Clause stands as a significant \nconstraint on the manner in which the political branches may exercise their plenary authority.” \n(quoting  Kleindienst  v.  Mandel,  408  U.S.  753,  769  (1972))).    In  sum,  the  Court  rejects \nDefendants’ challenges to Plaintiffs’ procedural due process claims.15 \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n15 Defendants argue for the first time in their reply brief that Plaintiffs fail to adequately “describe what \nprocedures they think the Constitution actually requires.”  See Reply re MTD at 18.  The Court will not consider this \nargument because Defendants failed to timely raise it.  See Zamani v.

Alex Azar, et al.  Page  16 of 28 \n   \n \n6.  Claims Under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act \n \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act provides in pertinent part that “[n]o otherwise \nqualified individual with a disability in the United States . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his \ndisability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance . . . .”  See 29 \nU.S.C. § 794(a).  Defendants contend that Plaintiffs’ Section 504 claims should be dismissed \nbecause the FAC does not “identify facts that suggest ORR was motivated to take the actions \nchallenged here ‘solely by reason’ of [their] alleged disabilities.”  See MTD at 29–30.  Once \nagain, Defendants’ assertion is flatly contradicted by the FAC’s allegations. \n \nThe FAC avers that ORR placed all but one of the Individual Plaintiffs (i.e., Jamie D.) in \nShiloh RTC “due to” their mental health needs.  See FAC at ¶¶ 31, 41, 48, 64, 81, 90.  In fact, \nDefendants admit that the agency transfers alien minors to RTCs “in order to treat intensive \npsychiatric and psychological needs.”  See Reply re MTD at 19.  Benjamin F.’s experience \nillustrates the effects of this alleged policy and/or practice.  The FAC claims that ORR initially \nplaced Benjamin F. and his brother, Mateo, in the same shelter facility.  See FAC at ¶¶ 86, 88.  \nORR  later  placed  Benjamin  F.  in  Shiloh  RTC  because  of  his  autism  and  developmental \ndisabilities.  See id. at ¶¶ 87, 90.  Shortly after the transfer, Mateo was released from the \nagency’s custody, but Benjamin remained at Shiloh RTC, presumably because medical personnel \nhad  not  yet  “declare[d]  him  psychologically  sound  .  .  .  .”    See  id.  at  91,  93–94.    These \nasseverations plausibly state a claim that ORR has taken action against alien minors “solely by \nreason of” their disabilities.16   \n \nB.  Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification \n \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2), Plaintiffs move to certify \nfive proposed classes that are comprised of all minors in ORR custody pursuant to 6 U.S.C. \nsection 279 and/or 8 U.S.C. section 1232: \n \n                                                 \n16 Defendants also suggest that “merely placing a minor in [an RTC] for children with intensive mental \nhealth needs [does not] violate[] the Rehabilitation Act . . . .”  See Reply re MTD at 18.  Yet, the FAC alleges that \nchildren placed in RTCs are denied benefits offered to other undocumented minors in ORR custody.  See, e.g., FAC \nat ¶ 130 (“[C]hildren placed in RTCs suffer the functional equivalent of indefinite civil commitment without due \nprocess  of  law.”).    Accordingly,  Plaintiffs  have  adequately  pled  a  violation  of  the  Rehabilitation  Act, \nnotwithstanding the fact that Defendants apparently disagree with their factual assertions.

See  Mot.  for  Class  Cert.  at  11–12.  \nFurthermore, the Individual Plaintiffs offer evidence indicating that they have been subjected to \nsuch policies and/or practices.

Alex Azar, et al.  Page  18 of 28 \n   \n \nof Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification, the Court assumes the existence of the policies \nand/or  practices  giving  rise  to  the  claims  underlying  the  proposed  classes.    See  Stichting \nPensioenfonds ABP v. Countrywide Fin. Corp., 802 F. Supp. 2d 1125, 1132 (C.D. Cal. 2011) \n(“[I]n most circumstances, failure to respond in an opposition brief to an argument put forward in \nan opening brief constitutes waiver or abandonment in regard to the uncontested issue.”).  With \nthat  assumption  in  mind,  the  Court  will  determine  whether  Plaintiffs  have  satisfied  the \nprerequisites of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. \n \n1.  Rule 23(a)(1):  Numerosity \n \nA putative class may be certified only if it “is so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).  The numerosity requirement imposes no absolute \nlimitations; rather, it “requires examination of the specific facts of each case.”  Gen. Tel. Co. of \nthe Nw. v. EEOC, 446 U.S. 318, 330 (1980).  “The Ninth Circuit has not offered a precise \nnumerical  standard;  other  District  Courts  have,  however,  enacted  presumptions  that  the \nnumerosity requirement is satisfied by a showing of 25–30 members.”  Slaven v. BP Am., Inc., \n190 F.R.D. 649, 654 (C.D. Cal. 2000).  “In analyzing numerosity ‘a court may make common-\nsense assumptions and reasonable inferences.’”  West v. Cal. Servs. Bureau, 323 F.R.D. 295, 303 \n(N.D. Cal. 2017) (quoting The Civil Rights Educ. & Enforcement Ctr. v. RLJ Lodging Trust, No. \nCV 15-0224-YGR, 2016 WL 314400, at *6 (N.D. Cal. 2016)). \n \nORR’s data shows that in fiscal year 2017, the agency admitted 873 minors to RTCs, \nsecure facilities, or staff-secure facilities.18  See Mot. for Class Cert., Ex. 3 at ¶ 10 (Revised \n                                                                                                                                                             \nCert. at 28.  For the reasons discussed infra Part III.B.2–3, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have advanced \nsufficient evidence that ORR routinely blocks detained minors from obtaining legal services to challenge the \nagency’s decisions regarding placement, release, and/or administration of psychotropic medication. \n \nDefendants further claim that Section 1.4.7 of the ORR Guide permits a minor to ask the ORR Director or \nhis designee to reconsider the minor’s transfer to a secure facility or RTC within 30 days after placement, and they \nnote that the TVPRA requires the agency to conduct monthly reviews of the placement of a minor in a secure \nfacility.  See Opp’n re Mot. for Class Cert. at 20–21 (citing ORR Guide § 1.4.7; 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(2)(A)).  \nNonetheless, Section 1.4.7 is no longer available in the online version of the ORR Guide, and Defendants have not \noffered a declaration showing that the provision still exists.  ORR Guide, Placement in ORR Care Provider \nFacilities,  https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/resource/children-entering-the-united-states-unaccompanied-section-1#1.4.7 \n(last visited Oct. 23, 2018).  More importantly, Defendants do not offer evidence that ORR affords minors placed in \nsuch facilities with notice of the reasons for the transfer, nor do they contend that the aforementioned procedures call \nfor review by a neutral and detached decisionmaker.  See Opp’n re Mot. for Class Cert. at 20–21.   \n \n18 ORR previously admitted that staff-secure facilities are “medium-security facilities” under the Flores \nAgreement.  Order re Pls.’ Mot. to Enforce at 9, Flores v. Sessions, No. CV 85-4544-DMG (AGRx) (C.D. Cal. July \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 126   Filed 11/02/18   Page 19 of 28   Page ID\n #:4320\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741 DMG (PLAx)  Date  November 2, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v. Alex Azar, et al.  Page  19 of 28 \n   \n \nSualog Decl.) [Doc. # 97-6].  Since the Court assumes for the purposes of Plaintiffs’ Motion that \nORR consistently fails to provide notice and an opportunity to be heard before a neutral and \ndetached decisionmaker in connection with such transfers, the Court concludes that the size of \nthe step-up class is large enough to render joinder impracticable. \n \nNext, Plaintiffs argue that ORR “routinely” delays or denies the release of minors to their \nproposed custodians on the grounds that they are unsuitable, see Mot. for Class Cert. at 25, an \nuncontested assertion that is consistent with the evidence discussed infra Part III.B.3.  Given that \n50,834 minors were admitted into ORR custody in fiscal year 2017 alone, common sense dictates \nthat a sizeable number of minors sought or will seek release to proposed custodians and were or \nwill  be  subjected  to  ORR’s  purportedly  inadequate  procedures  for  contesting  the  agency’s \nsuitability determinations. \n \nFurther, ORR’s data shows that 74 minors were admitted to RTCs in fiscal year 2017.  \nSee Mot. for Class Cert., Ex. 3 at ¶ 10 (Revised Sualog Decl.) [Doc. # 97-6].  Because ORR’s \nstatistical  reports  show  that  it  “administers  psychotropic  medications  to  .  .  .  nearly  every \nchild . . . it places” in its RTCs, the drug administration class is sufficiently numerous to satisfy \nRule 23(a)(1).  See Mot. for Class Cert., Ex. 22 at ¶¶ 2–3 (Holguín Decl.) [Doc. # 97-27]; see \nalso Mot. for Class Cert., Ex. 12 at ¶ 12 (Miguel Angel S. Suppl. Decl.) (ORR has confined \nMiguel Angel S. to Yolo Juvenile Detention Center, where he has been instructed to take \nmedication for depression and anxiety) [Doc. # 105-1].  Defendants admit that alien minors are \nplaced in RTCs if ORR determines that they “require intensive mental health services which \ncannot be provided on an outpatient basis,” see Opp’n re Mot. for Class Cert. at 20, a concession \nthat signifies that joinder of the members of the disability class would also be impracticable. \n \nLastly, Plaintiffs accurately note that the legal representation class is comprised of the \nstep-up, unfit custodian, and drug administration classes because ORR has allegedly, as a matter \nof common practice, discouraged legal services providers from assisting undocumented minors \nin challenging those decisions.  See Mot. for Class Cert. at 26.  Thus, it stands to reason that the \nlegal representation class comports with Rule 23(a)(1) as well.            \n \n2.  Rule 23(a)(2):  Commonality \n \nThe commonality requirement is satisfied if “there are questions of law or fact common \nto the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).  “Commonality requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that \n                                                                                                                                                             \n30, 2018) [Doc. # 470].  Plaintiffs likewise treat staff-secure facilities as “medium-secure facilities” for the purposes \nof the definition of the step-up class.  See Mot. for Class Cert at 24 (citing Mot. for Class Cert., Ex. 3 at ¶ 10 \n(Revised Sualog Decl.)

Alex Azar, et al.  Page  20 of 28 \n   \n \nthe class members ‘have suffered the same injury.’”  Dukes, 564 U.S. at 349–50 (quoting Gen. \nTele. of S.W. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157(1982)).  In determining that a common question of \nlaw exists, it is insufficient to find that all putative class members have suffered a violation of the \nsame provision of law.  See id. at 350.  Rather, the putative class members’ claims “must depend \nupon a common contention” that is “of such a nature that it is capable of classwide resolution—\nwhich means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the \nvalidity of each one of the claims in one stroke.”  See id. \n \nAs noted above, Defendants do not dispute that ORR has instituted a policy and/or \npractice of transferring minors to secure facilities, medium-secure facilities, and RTCs without \nbeing  afforded  notice  and  an  opportunity  to  be  heard  before  a  neutral  and  detached \ndecisionmaker.  They also do not contest that ORR consistently fails to provide parents and other \nproposed custodians with any formal means by which to challenge the agency’s suitability \ndeterminations, or that ORR routinely administers psychotropic drugs to minors without first \nobtaining informed consent or court authorization.  They likewise do not challenge Plaintiffs’ \nassertion that ORR had adopted a policy and/or practice of placing children with actual or \nperceived behavioral, mental health, intellectual, and/or developmental disabilities in secure \nfacilities, medium-secure facilities, and RTCs.  It follows that whether such policies and/or \npractices violate the Due Process Clause, the Freedom of Association Clause, the TVPRA, \nand/or the Rehabilitation Act are common questions for all putative members of the step-up \nclass, the unfit custodian class, the drug administration class, and the disability class.19 \n \nDefendants nonetheless insist that the step-up, unfit custodian, drug administration, and \ndisability classes do not present common questions because “there is wide variation in the \nevidence that ORR may rely on in informing its placement, release, and treatment decisions.”  \nSee Opp’n re Mot. for Class Cert. at 19.  Defendants misapprehend the nature of Plaintiffs’ \nclaims.  Plaintiffs seek an injunction barring Defendants from engaging in the aforementioned \npolicies and/or practices in the absence of certain procedural safeguards.  See, e.g., FAC at 57–\n58.  Plaintiffs do not request an order requiring Defendants to transfer particular putative class \nmembers to less restrictive settings, release them to proposed custodians, cease medicating them, \n                                                 \n19 Defendants point out that Plaintiffs’ Flores claims relating to the administration of psychotropic drugs \nare governed by the child welfare laws of each state in which a particular putative class member is detained.  See \nOpp’n re Mot. for Class Cert. at 24–25; Order re Pls.’ Mot. to Enforce at 20–24, Flores v. Sessions, No. CV 85-\n4544-DMG (AGRx) (C.D. Cal. July 30, 2018) [Doc. # 470].  The parties have not addressed whether the differences \nin the various applicable state child welfare laws would affect the extent to which Plaintiffs’ due process claims \nraise common questions.  Should that issue arise, the Court may alter or amend its class certification order to further \ndivide the drug administration class into appropriate subclasses.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(C).  Until then, the \nCourt will not address the issue sua sponte or presume that potential differences in state child welfare laws prevent \nPlaintiffs’ federal due process claims from presenting common questions of law and fact.  \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 126   Filed 11/02/18   Page 21 of 28   Page ID\n #:4322\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741 DMG (PLAx)  Date  November 2, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v.

Cf. Parsons \nv. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657, 678 (9th Cir. 2014) (“The putative class and subclass members . . . all set \nforth numerous common contentions whose truth or falsity can be determined in one stroke:  \nwhether the specified statewide policies and practices to which they are all subjected by [prison \nofficials] expose them to a substantial risk of harm. . . .  That inquiry does not require us to \ndetermine the effect of those policies and practices upon any individual class member (or class \nmembers) or to undertake any other kind of individualized determination.”).    \n \nPlaintiffs also offer evidence indicating that ORR has instructed legal aid programs not to \nrepresent  minors  in  connection  with  ORR’s  placement,  medication,  and  release  decisions.  \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs point to evidence that HHS has contracted with the Vera Institute of \nJustice for the purposes of providing legal services to undocumented minors.  See Mot. for Class \nCert, Ex. 5 (HHS’s contracts with Vera) [Doc. ## 97-8, 97-9].  They also offer declarations from \nattorneys  who  worked  for  Vera-funded  legal  aid  programs,  wherein  they  claim  that  ORR \ninstructed those programs not to challenge ORR’s confinement of alien minors or the conditions \nthereof.  See Mot. for Class Cert., Ex. 6 at ¶¶ 4, 8–9 (Mixon Decl.) (attesting that ORR instructed \nMixon not to challenge the agency’s release and placement decisions) [Doc. # 97-10]; Mot. for \nClass Cert., Ex. 7 at ¶¶ 11, 19 (Williams Decl.) (“[B]oth ORR and Vera Institute informally \ndiscourage Vera-funded lawyers from taking legal action against ORR lest they cut off funds \nentirely for assisting unaccompanied minors. * * * [A]lthough ORR boasts of providing free \nlegal services to detained minors, it hobbles free legal service providers who undertake to \nrepresent detained children.”) [Doc. # 97-11]; Mot. for Class Cert., Ex. 8 at ¶¶ 14–24 (Stuart \nDecl.) (attesting that Vera-funded providers rarely challenge ORR’s detention decisions, and that \nORR has instructed such providers not to refer cases to Stuart because she initiated such a \nchallenge) [Doc. # 97-12].  Because there are few free legal services available to minors in ORR \ncustody other than Vera-funded providers, see Mot. for Class Cert., Ex. 6 at ¶¶ 8–10 (Mixon \nDecl.) [Doc. # 97-10], ORR’s conduct will likely deprive most (if not all) such children of the \nopportunity  to  meaningfully  challenge  the  agency’s  release,  placement,  and  medication \ndecisions.  Thus, whether this policy or practice violates federal law (e.g., the TVPRA) is a \ncommon question for nearly all detained children from non-contiguous countries who are placed \nin restrictive settings, denied release to their proposed custodians, or forced to take psychotropic \nmedications.  See FAC at ¶ 144 (asserting that 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5), 6 U.S.C. § 279(b)(1)(A), \nand certain regulations relating thereto collectively require ORR to provide pro bono counsel to \nalien minors who are not from contiguous countries).  Thus, the Court concludes that each of the \nfive putative classes satisfy the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2).  \n \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 126   Filed 11/02/18   Page 22 of 28   Page ID\n #:4323\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741 DMG (PLAx)  Date  November 2, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v.

Rule 23(a)(3):  Typicality \n \nTypicality requires a showing that “the claims or defenses of the representative parties \nare typical of the claims or defenses of the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3).  The purpose of this \nrequirement “is to assure that the interest of the named representative aligns with the interests of \nthe class.”  Wolin v. Jaguar Land Rover N. Am., LLC, 617 F.3d 1168, 1175 (9th Cir. 2010) \n(quoting Hanon v. Dataproducts Corp., 976 F.2d 497, 508 (9th Cir. 1992)).  “The test of \ntypicality is whether other members have the same or similar injury, whether the action is based \non conduct which is not unique to the named plaintiffs, and whether other class members have \nbeen injured by the same course of conduct.”  Id. (quoting Hanon, 976 F.2d at 508).  The \ntypicality standard under Rule 23(a)(3) is “permissive”:  “representative claims are ‘typical’ if \nthey  are  reasonably  coextensive  with  those  of  absent  class  members;  they  need  not  be \nsubstantially identical.”  Staton v.

(ORR  never  obtained  his  written  consent  to \nadminister  medication  to  his  son,  Miguel  Angel  S.,  and  Gerardo  S.  did  not  receive  any \nnotification that ORR sought court approval) [Doc. # 105-1].  Defendants also do not controvert \nPlaintiffs’ claims that ORR administered psychotropic drugs to Sirena P. and Benjamin F. \nwithout their families’ informed consent.  See Mot. for Class Cert. at 18–19.   \n \n  Fourth, as discussed supra in Part II.B.2, Plaintiffs have shown that ORR blocks Vera-\nfunded legal service providers from challenging the agency’s custody of unaccompanied minors \nand the conditions thereof.  Defendants counter that “[n]either the First Amended Complaint nor \n                                                 \n21 Plaintiffs assert that Daniela Marisol T. should also be named a representative of the unfit custodian \nclass.  See Reply re Mot. for Class Cert. at 21.  The Court declines to do so at this time, because her declarations do \nnot specify when her proposed custodian submitted the information requested by ORR.   \n  \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 126   Filed 11/02/18   Page 24 of 28   Page ID\n #:4325\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741 DMG (PLAx)  Date  November 2, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v. Alex Azar, et al.  Page  24 of 28 \n   \n \nthe Motion to Certify Class identifies a single class member whom ORR has blocked from \nreceiving legal services[.]”22  See Opp’n re Mot. for Class Cert. at 28–29.  Nonetheless, ORR’s \nalleged policy or practice of discouraging such programs from taking any legal action against the \nagency by its very nature inflicts a systemic injury—i.e., it deprives detained minors of an \nopportunity to challenge placement, detention, and medication decisions.  Whether any of the \nIndividual Plaintiffs were subjectively aware of that fact is beside the point.  Further, the claims \nbelonging to Lucas R., Gabriela N., Daniela Marisol T., and Jaime D. are typical of those \nbelonging to the legal assistance class because:  (1) they assert the same claims as the step-up \nclass, the unfit custodian class, and/or the drug administration class; and (2) it is undisputed that \nthese four Plaintiffs are from non-contiguous countries.23  See Mot. for Class Cert. at 17–18 \n(Daniela Marisol T. and Jaime D. are from Honduras) [Doc. # 97-1]; Mot. for Class Cert.. Ex. 21 \nat ¶ 2 (Lucas R. Decl.) (Lucas R. is from Guatemala) [Doc. # 105-1]; Mot. for Class Cert., Ex. 14 \nat ¶ 2 (Gabriela N. Decl.) (Gabriela N. is from El Salvador) [Doc. # 105-1]. \n \n  Lastly, Plaintiffs contend—and Defendants do not dispute—that ORR transferred Lucas \nR., Gabriela N., Sirena P., and Benjamin F. to Shiloh RTC because of their mental health needs.  \nSee Mot. for Class Cert. at 17–19, 21.  Defendants also do not contest that ORR placed Miguel \nAngel S. in Yolo County Juvenile Detention Center and Shiloh RTC because of his mental health \nneeds.  See Mot. for Class Cert. at 17–18. \n \n  Because the aforementioned proposed class representatives have suffered injuries similar \nto those sustained by other members of their respective putative classes, the Court finds that \nPlaintiffs have satisfied Rule 23(a)(3)’s typicality requirement. \n \n4.  Rule 23(a)(4) and Rule 23(g):  Adequacy \n \n  Rule 23(a)(4) permits certification of a class action if “the representative parties will \nfairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.”  Rule 23(a)(4) presents two questions:  \n“(1) do the named plaintiffs and their counsel have any conflicts of interest with other class \nmembers and (2) will the named plaintiffs and their counsel prosecute the action vigorously on \n                                                 \n22 Although Defendants frame this issue as one of adequacy, the Court addresses it in connection with the \ntypicality prong because it concerns whether Plaintiffs suffered an injury similar to that of the other putative class \nmembers.  See 1 Newberg on Class Actions § 3:32 (5th ed. 2018) (“The typicality prerequisite overlaps with the \nRule 23(a)(4) requirement that class representation be adequate . . . .”). \n  \n23 The FAC alleges that Benjamin F. is a native and citizen of El Salvador (i.e., a non-contiguous country).  \nSee FAC at ¶ 16.  Because Plaintiffs did not make that assertion in their Motion for Class Certification or supply a \nsupporting declaration from Benjamin F., that assertion is neither undisputed nor supported by the evidence.   \n \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 126   Filed 11/02/18   Page 25 of 28   Page ID\n #:4326\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741 DMG (PLAx)  Date  November 2, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v. Alex Azar, et al.  Page  25 of 28 \n   \n \nbehalf of the class?”  See Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1020.  Similarly, Rule 23(g)(1) requires courts to \nconsider several factors “pertinent to counsel’s ability to fairly and adequately represent the \ninterests of the class[.]” \n \n  The Court has already found that the Individual Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of those \npertaining to their respective putative classes, see supra Part III.B.3, and there are no apparent \nconflicts of interest between the Individual Plaintiffs and the absent proposed class members.  \nDefendants nonetheless contend that Lucas R.’s, Sirena P.’s, and Benjamin F.’s claims are moot \nbecause ORR released them.24  See Opp’n re Mot. for Class Cert. at 26–27 & n.11.  It is unlikely \nthat these Plaintiffs’ claims truly are moot because the Flores Agreement authorizes ORR to \nreassume custody over them under certain circumstances.  See Flores Agreement at ¶ 16; see \nalso Saravia, 280 F. Supp. 3d at 1177–82 (noting that ORR had reassumed custody over three \nminors the agency initially released).   \n \nEven if Defendants have released these Plaintiffs, however, Lucas R., Sirena P., and \nBenjamin F. may still serve as class representatives.  The Ninth Circuit has held that “a named \nplaintiff’s  claim  is  ‘transitory  in  nature  and  may  otherwise  evade  review’”  if  a  defendant \nemploys a “tactic of ‘picking off’ lead plaintiffs to avoid a class action.”  See Chen v. Allstate \nIns. Co., 819 F.3d 1136, 1143 (9th Cir. 2016) (quoting Pitts v. Terrible Herbst, Inc., 653 F.3d \n1081, 1091 (9th Cir. 2011)).  Under those circumstances, “the named plaintiff may continue to \nrepresent the class until the district court decides the class certification issue.”  See id. (quoting \nPitts, 653 F.3d at 1092).  Here, Defendants did not release any of the Individual Plaintiffs until \nafter the filing of the FAC on September 7, 2018.  See De La Cruz Decl. at ¶¶ 2–8 [Doc. # 123-\n1].  Additionally, Defendants did not release three of the named Plaintiffs until after they filed \nthe instant Motion for Class Certification.  See id. at ¶¶ 6–8.  It follows that Plaintiffs’ claims are \ninherently transitory and may evade review if the Court countenances Defendants’ transparent \nattempts to thwart their Motion for Class Certification.25 \n                                                 \n24 Plaintiffs concede that ORR also released Miguel Angel S. sometime in early to mid-October 2018.  See \nReply re Mot. for Class Cert. at 20 n.9.  Additionally, on the day before the November 2, 2018 hearing on the instant \nmotions, Defendants informed the Court that ORR also released Gabriela N., Daniela Marisol T., and Jaime D.  See \nDe La Cruz Decl. at ¶¶ 3, 7–8 [Doc. # 123-1].  Thus, Defendants’ contention regarding mootness applies with equal \nforce to all of their claims as well.   \n  \n25 Defendants contend that Sirena P.’s and Benjamin F.’s requests for release were “well underway and \nnear complete” when they were joined as Plaintiffs.  See Opp’n re Mot. for Class Cert. at 26–27 n.11.  The \ndeclaration they cite for that proposition, however, does not support it.  See De La Cruz Decl. at ¶¶ 2–4 [Doc. # 122-\n1].  Further, the Court is not persuaded by Defendants’ contention that Genesis Healthcare Corp. v. Symczyk, 569 \nU.S. 66 (2013), prevents Plaintiffs from relying on the “inherently transitory” claim doctrine.  Since Genesis was \ndecided, the Ninth Circuit reaffirmed the proposition that a defendant’s litigation strategy can invoke that exception \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 126   Filed 11/02/18   Page 26 of 28   Page ID\n #:4327\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741 DMG (PLAx)  Date  November 2, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v. Alex Azar, et al.  Page  26 of 28 \n   \n \n \n  With regard to the second prong of the Rule 23(a)(4) analysis, Defendants contend in \ntheir Opposition that the Individual Plaintiffs are not adequate class representatives because none \nof them submitted declarations showing that they were willing and able to prosecute this action \nand make themselves available for depositions, discovery, and trial.  See Opp’n re Mot. for Class \nCert. at 26.  Thereafter, Miguel Angel S. and Gabriela N. submitted declarations to that effect.  \nSee Reply re Mot. for Class Cert., Ex. 34 at ¶¶ 1–6 (Miguel Angel S. Suppl. Decl.) [Doc. # 119-\n1]; Reply re Mot. for Class Cert., Ex. 35 at ¶¶ 1–7 (Gabriela N. Suppl. Decl.) [Doc. # 119-2].  \nMoreover,  Plaintiffs  counter  that  Defendants  do  not  “offer  any  legal  authority  that  [this] \nobjection disqualifies [the other Individual] Plaintiffs from serving as class representatives” and \n“[i]t would be nonsensical to assume that Plaintiffs . . . have no desire to seek redress for the \ninjuries [ORR allegedly] caused them.”  See Reply re Mot. for Class Cert. at 20.  The Court \nagrees with Plaintiffs, and declines Defendants’ invitation to elevate form over substance.  The \nCourt thus concludes that all of the Individual Plaintiffs are adequate class representatives with \nregard to their respective classes as defined below. \n \n  Furthermore, the declarations of Plaintiffs’ attorneys reveal that they have undertaken \nconsiderable efforts to investigate the claims in this action, they have extensive experience and \nknowledge regarding complex class litigation brought on behalf of immigrant children, and they \nhave the necessary personnel and resources to prosecute this action to final judgment.  See Mot. \nfor Class Cert., Ex. 28 at ¶¶ 1–6 (Cooper Decl.) [Doc. # 97-32]; Mot. for Class Cert., Ex. 29 at \n¶¶ 1–5 (Holguín Decl.)

[Doc. # 97-35]; Mot. for \nClass Cert., Ex. 32 at ¶¶ 1–5 (Wynn Decl.) [Doc. # 97-36].  The Court therefore finds that \nPlaintiffs’ counsel will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the five proposed classes.  \nSee also Opp’n re Mot. for Class Cert. at 26 (“Defendants have no concern that plaintiffs’ \ncounsel will prosecute the action vigorously on behalf of the class[es].”).  \n \n5.  Rule 23(b)(2):  Whether Injunctive or Declaratory Relief Is Appropriate for \nthe Classes \n \nTo obtain class certification under Rule 23(b)(2), the movant must show that “the party \nopposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that \nfinal injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a \nwhole.”  “The rule does not require [courts] to examine the viability or bases of class members’ \n                                                                                                                                                             \nto mootness.  See Chen, 819 F.3d at 1138 (“Although [the defendant] argues that Pitts is no longer good law after \nGenesis . . . we rejected that very argument in Gomez v. Campbell-Ewald Co., 768 F.3d 871 (9th Cir. 2014) \n(‘Gomez’), aff’d, 136 S. Ct. 663 (2016).

(quoting Walters v. Reno, \n145 F.3d 1032, 1047 (9th Cir. 1998)). \n \nAs noted throughout Part III.B, supra, Defendants have largely refrained from disputing \nPlaintiffs’ assertions that ORR consistently employs the policies and/or practices challenged by \nthe five putative classes, and Plaintiffs’ evidence corroborates their claims that ORR has engaged \nin such conduct.  In addition, Plaintiffs specifically request a declaration that these policies \nand/or  practices  are  unlawful  and  an  injunction  barring  Defendants  from  continuing  to \nimplement them.  Thus, class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) is appropriate.   \n   \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n \n  For the foregoing reasons, the Court issues the following rulings: \n \n1.  Defendants’ MTD is GRANTED only insofar as it seeks the dismissal without prejudice \nof Plaintiffs’ claims to enforce the Flores Agreement, but not insofar as it requests the \ndismissal of Plaintiffs’ claims that ORR failed to provide sufficient procedural safeguards \nfor alien minors to exercise their Flores rights.  The remainder of Defendants’ MTD is \nDENIED; \n \n2.  Defendants shall file an Answer to the FAC within 60 days of the date of this Order; \n \n3.  Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification is GRANTED.  The Court CERTIFIES five \nclasses that are comprised of all minors in ORR custody pursuant to 6 U.S.C. section 279 \nand/or 8 U.S.C. section 1232: \n \na.  who are or will be placed in a secure facility, medium-secure facility, or RTC, \nor whom ORR has continued to detain in any such facility for more than 30 \ndays, without being afforded notice and an opportunity to be heard before a \nneutral and detached decisionmaker regarding the grounds for such placement \n(i.e., the “step-up class”); \nb.  whom ORR is refusing or will refuse to release to parents or other available \ncustodians  within  30  days  of  the  proposed  custodian’s  submission  of  a \nCV-90  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk KT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 126   Filed 11/02/18   Page 28 of 28   Page ID\n #:4329\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL \n \nCase No.  CV 18-5741 DMG (PLAx)  Date  November 2, 2018 \n   \nTitle  Lucas R., et al. v.

IDENTIFICATION, ASSESSMENT, AND TRACKING OF \n2 CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES \n3 A. Identification of Children with Disabilities \n4 1. ORR will identify a child as having a disability:\n5 a. If the individual performing the initial medical examination\n6 for ORR, see ORR Policy Guide as of this writing codified \n7 at § 3.4.2, determines that the child has a physical or mental \n8 impairment that substantially limits one or more of the child\n9 major life activities; or\n10 b. If, while the child is in ORR custody, a licensed medical \n11 provider or licensed mental health professional determines \n12 that the child has a physical or mental impairment that \n13 substantially limits one or more of the child major life \n14 activities; or\n15 c. Based on the results of an evaluation conducted pursuant to \n16 Section II.A.2.\n17 2. Evaluation for disability\n18 a. Any one or more of the following events will trigger an\n19 evaluation for disability to determine whether a child has a \n20 physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or \n21 more of the child major life activities: \n22 i. If a child is psychiatrically hospitalized or evaluated for \n23 psychiatric hospitalization (upon discharge, unless an \n24 evaluation for disability has already been completed in \n25 connection with the hospitalization or evaluation for \n26 hospitalization, in which case, if a disability is identified,\n27 the child will be considered for an individualized service \n28 plan pursuant to Section II.B); or\n10\nSTIPULATED SETTLEMENT\nCASE NO.2:18-CV-05741DMGPLA\nExhibit C \nPage 81\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 408-5   Filed 11/14/23   Page 12 of 47   Page ID\n#:20104\n1 ii. If a child is considered for step-up to an RTC or secure \n2 facility based on danger to self or danger to others\n3 (unless an evaluation for disability has already been \n4 completed in connection with the consideration for step-\n5 up, in which case, if a disability is identified, the child \n6 will be considered for an individualized service plan \n7 pursuant to Section II.B); or\n8 iii. At the request of the child after being informed of the \n9 purpose, scope, and nature of the evaluation, including a \n10 request made through counsel of record (for whom ORR \n11 individual \n12 representation of the child), a child advocate, or a parent \n13 or guardian. \n14 b. When a child has been identified as having a disability and/or \n15 evaluated for a potential disability pursuant to this Section, the \n16 child will not be re-evaluated for the same presenting \n17 symptoms except upon the recommendation of a medical or \n18 mental health professional. \n19 c. Evaluations will be conducted as promptly as is practicable\n20 unless the child is released to a sponsor or placed in an \n21 URM program before \n22 the evaluation is started or completed, or the evaluating \n23 professional recommends waiting to evaluate the child. ORR \n24 will make and document best efforts to ensure that:\n25 i. An evaluation for disability is initiated within 30 days of \n26 the triggering event; and\n27 ii. An evaluation is completed within 60 days of ORR \n28 identifying the need for an evaluation.  \n11\nSTIPULATED SETTLEMENT\nCASE NO.2:18-CV-05741DMGPLA\nExhibit C \nPage 82\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 408-5   Filed 11/14/23   Page 13 of 47   Page ID\n#:20105\n1 d. The purpose of the evaluation is to identify qualified children\n2 with disabilities for the purpose of developing a Section 504 \n3 Service Plan (see Section II.B) if one is needed to meet their\n4 disability-related needs, to ensure that they receive services in \n5 the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs (unless \n6 ORR can demonstrate that this would fundamentally alter the \n7 nature of its UC Program), and to ensure to the best extent \n8 practicable that they are released to a suitable sponsor from \n9 due to their \n10 disability. \n11 e. The evaluation will be conducted by one or more individuals \n12 qualified to assess children in the area(s) of suspected \n13 disability or presenting symptoms.  Nothing in this Agreement \n14 shall be construed as providing the right to a particular \n15 evaluator(s).  The evaluator(s) will select the appropriate tools \n16 and/or assessments using their professional judgment and \n17 provide ORR documentation of the evaluation findings and \n18 any recommendations. Division of Health for \n19 DHUC will:\n20 i. issue written guidance on the selection of qualified \n21 evaluators, the inclusion of necessary assessments, the \n22 process for advising a child about the purpose and scope \n23 of the evaluation, and the sharing of relevant records in \n24 (s) (including any \n25 relevant records and assessments\n26 country and/or current or prior ORR placements); and\n27 ii. provide consultation to care providers, on an as-needed \n28 basis, on the evaluation process.\n12\nSTIPULATED SETTLEMENT\nCASE NO.2:18-CV-05741DMGPLA\nExhibit C \nPage 83\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 408-5   Filed 11/14/23   Page 14 of 47   Page ID\n#:20106\n1 f. A copy of the evaluation report(s) shall be provided to the \n2 (and no \n3 child welfare concerns exist).  Evaluation reports shall also be \n4 provided on demand to any attorney of record (who provides\n5 ORR documentation of individual representation of the child) \n6 and the child advocate, if applicable.  \n7 g. ORR shall not share any evaluation report or related clinical \n8 or mental health documents or Significant Incident Reports \n9 ( SIRs ) with any component of the Department of Homeland \n10 DHS for purposes of any deportation, removal, \n11 application for relief from removal, custody hearing, or \n12 United States Citizenship and Immigration Services \n13 USCIS adjudication. \n14 h. A pending, scheduled, or partially completed evaluation will \n15 not be a justification to delay an otherwise appropriate release \n16 to a suitable sponsor, step-down to a less restrictive \n17 placement, or placement in a URM program, although such an \n18 evaluation may inform the appropriateness of a step-down \n19 and/or suitability determination where appropriate.  See \n20 Section V.C.  \n21 B. Individualized Section 504 Service Plans\n22 1. The purpose of a Section 504 Service Plan is to meet the child\n23 disability-related needs, to ensure that they can participate in the UC \n24 Program in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs\n25 (unless ORR can demonstrate that this would fundamentally alter the \n26 nature of its UC Program), and to ensure to the best extent practicable\n27 any unnecessary \n28 delay due to their disability.\n13\nSTIPULATED SETTLEMENT\nCASE NO.2:18-CV-05741DMGPLA\nExhibit C \nPage 84\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 408-5   Filed 11/14/23   Page 15 of 47   Page ID\n#:20107\n1 2. When a child \n2 disability pursuant to Section II.A.1, ORR will, in consultation with \n3 individuals with relevant expertise, see Section II.B.3:\n4 a. Assess  potential need for reasonable \n5 accommodations, modifications, services, and/or supports to \n6 meet the child -related needs, to ensure that they \n7 can participate in the UC Program in the most integrated \n8 setting appropriate to their needs (unless ORR can \n9 demonstrate and document that this would fundamentally alter \n10 the nature of its UC Program), and to ensure to the best extent \n11 practicable\n12 any unnecessary delay due to their disability; and\n13 b. If needed, develop and implement an individualized Section \n14 504 Service Plan for the child. \n15 3. For purposes of Sections II.B.2 and II.B.11, the individuals with \n16 relevant expertise consulted must include the child (if the child is \n17 willing and able to communicate about their service plan, preferences, \n18 and needs) and the child advocate (if any).  ORR will use best efforts \n19 to include the parent/legal guardian (if reasonably available and with \n20 of record (who \n21 provides ORR documentation of individual representation of the child \n22 and if the child consents).  The individuals consulted may also \n23 include, as appropriate, individuals such as care provider staff \n24\n25 medical or mental health provider(s).\n26 4.

The Section 504 Service Plan, if one is needed, will be developed and \n2 implemented as soon as possible, and within 60 days of identification \n3 of the child as having a disability (see Section II.A.1), unless the child\n4 is released to a sponsor or placed in a URM program before the \n5 Section 504 Service Plan is started or completed. The Section 504 \n6 Service Plan may be implemented in a piecemeal fashion as \n7 appropriate and feasible within the 60-day window.\n8 6. ORR will make best efforts to develop and implement a Section 504 \n9 Service Plan, if one is needed, before any step-up of a child with an \n10 identified disability unless the child is released to a sponsor or placed \n11 in a URM program earlier.  If a Section 504 Service Plan is not \n12 developed and implemented before step-up, ORR will document in \n13 why it was not feasible to do \n14 so before step-up, and will complete development and begin \n15 implementation of a Section 504 Service Plan, if one is needed, within \n16 30 days of the step-up.  \n17 7. The Section 504 Service Plan, if one is deemed necessary, will be \n18 targeted to the individual child, and must:\n19 a. Identify the child disability-related needs and, if applicable, \n20 disability-based behaviors; and\n21 b. Include an individualized plan that (i) proactively identifies\n22 and provides for services, supports, and reasonable \n23 accommodations and modifications to meet the child\n24 identified disability-based needs; (ii) documents any \n25 reasonable accommodations or modifications to the UC \n26 Program needed to maintain the child in the \n27 most integrated setting appropriate to  needs while \n28 in ORR custody (unless ORR can demonstrate and document\n15\nSTIPULATED SETTLEMENT\nCASE NO.2:18-CV-05741DMGPLA\nExhibit C \nPage 86\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 408-5   Filed 11/14/23   Page 17 of 47   Page ID\n#:20109\n1 that this would fundamentally alter the nature of its UC \n2 Program), taking into account the specific triggers of the \n3 ; and (iii) includes a transition plan and \n4 consideration of available post-release services to enable safe \n5 release to a suitable sponsor without unnecessary delay due to \n6\n7 8.

Procedures for consulting with the individuals with relevant \n13 expertise described in Section II.B.3;\n14 c. Consideration of any relevant medical, mental health, and/or \n15 educational records\n16 ; and\n17 d. Guidelines for specifying when, how often, and by whom \n18 services will be provided.\n19 9. In developing a Section 504 Service Plan, ORR shall consider all\n20 recommendations provided by individual(s) who conduct \n21 evaluation(s) for disability.  ORR will include a written explanation of \n22 major \n23 recommendation(s) in the Service Plan.   \n24 10. ORR is not obligated under this Agreement to pay for or provide \n25 post-release services, except that post-release services can provide \n26 case management to identify services, including no- or low-cost \n27 services, available in the community.  \n28\n16\nSTIPULATED SETTLEMENT\nCASE NO.2:18-CV-05741DMGPLA\nExhibit C \nPage 87\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 408-5   Filed 11/14/23   Page 18 of 47   Page ID\n#:20110\n1 11.

ORR will describe and document the services or care that will be \n2 provided at the restrictive placement, why they are necessary for the \n3 child, and why they cannot be provided in a less restrictive placement.\n4 C. Step-down of Children with Identified Disabilities in Restrictive Settings\n5 1. ORR will assess children with identified disabilities who are placed in \n6 restrictive placements for step-down at least every 30 days, as part of \n7 -day placement review.  \n8 2. The 30-day placement review will include and document \n9 consideration  , the services and supports \n10 needed to address it, and whether services and supports could be \n11 provided safely in a less restrictive placement.     \n12 3. If the 30-day placement review does not recommend step-down, ORR \n13 s needs cannot be met in a more \n14 integrated and less restrictive setting with additional services, \n15 supports, and/or accommodations.  For a child placed in an RTC, \n16 the written assessment of the \n17 treating mental health professional(s) as to why the child cannot be \n18 safely stepped down to a less restrictive setting.\n19 4. If the 30-day placement review recommends step-down, the child will \n20 be placed in the least restrictive setting in the best interest of the child\n21 as expeditiously as possible.  Efforts to locate a less restrictive \n22 placement following a recommendation for step-down will be \n23 documented .   \n24 D. Access to Documentation\n25 1. The child, their attorney of record, if any, and their child advocate, if \n26 applicable, will have access to the documentation required under \n27 Sections IV.B and IV.C (which is part of Notice of Placement \n28 documentation) upon request.\n23\nSTIPULATED SETTLEMENT\nCASE NO.2:18-CV-05741DMGPLA\nExhibit C \nPage 94\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 408-5   Filed 11/14/23   Page 25 of 47   Page ID\n#:20117\n1 E. Access to Services\n2 1. ORR will make and document efforts to place each child with an \n3 identified disability in a placement that can provide access to the \n4\n5 Plan (unless ORR can demonstrate and document that this would \n6 fundamentally alter the nature of its UC Program), except that ORR \n7 may maintain a child in their current shelter or foster care placement \n8 upon a determination that maintaining their current placement would \n9 be in the best interest of the child.\n10 2. To facilitate continuity in care, when ORR transfers a child with an \n11 identified disability, it will ensure that all records related to Section \n12 504 Service Plans are included in the health records accompanying the \n13 child upon transfer.  ORR will direct the care provider to provide \n14 these records to the \n15 as needed.     \n16 V.\n17 TO SPONSORS \n18 A. Home Studies \n19 1. When ORR identifies a child as having a disability under Section\n20 II.A.1, the TVPRA requires a home study  potential \n21 sponsor(s).  When ORR determines that the TVPRA mandates a home \n22 study and a potential sponsor has become potentially viable, meaning \n23 that the potential sponsor has submitted a complete Family \n24 Reunification Application and supporting documentation, and that \n25 ORR has not denied that application, ORR will obtain such a home \n26 study as expeditiously as possible, with the goal of avoiding any \n27 unnecessary delay in release.\n28\n24\nSTIPULATED SETTLEMENT\nCASE NO.2:18-CV-05741DMGPLA\nExhibit C \nPage 95\n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 408-5   Filed 11/14/23   Page 26 of 47   Page ID\n#:20118\n1 2. Background checks for any case referred for a home study because of \n2\n3 home study process itself.  Unless results of the background check are \n4 required prior to the initiation of the home study for a specified safety \n5 reason, the home study should be conducted pending receipt of \n6 background check results. \n7 B. Support for Sponsors\n8 1. When ORR identifies a viable potential sponsor for a child with an \n9 identified disability, ORR will affirmatively support and assist that \n10 sponsor in accessing and coordinating post-release community-based \n11 services and supports, to the extent they are available (and subject to \n12 appropriations), in an effort to work toward release without \n13 unnecessary delay.  This support and assistance must be documented \n14   However, ORR will not delay the release of \n15 the child if post-\n16 release, unless the needs of the child require it.\n17 2. of a potential sponsor of a child with an identified \n18 disability must explicitly include consideration of the potential \n19 benefits to the child of release to a community-based setting.   \n20 ability to \n21 meet the physical and emotional needs of the child must necessarily \n22\n23 well as the availability of post-\n24 needs.  \n25 3.

INTRODUCTION\n2  Plaintiffs request a temporary order protecting children whom the Office of\n3  Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”) has placed in congregate detention from the clear and \n4  present danger the COVID-19 pandemic poses to their health and well-being. While \n5  medical experts unanimously demand that we all practice physical distancing, avoid \n6  groups of ten or more, and self-isolate, such precautions are all but impossible for \n7  children in congregate settings, who are therefore at unacceptable risk.  \n8  Last Sunday, CNN reported that a 12-year-old child with no preexisting health \n9  conditions  and  no  known  contact  with  an  infected  person  was  diagnosed  with \n10  pneumonia, tested positive for coronavirus, and was on a ventilator fighting for her life.1 \n11  As her cousin observed, “Everyone keeps saying ‘it doesn’t impact younger people.’ \n12  But here’s a 12-year-old fighting for her life. People need to practice social distancing. \n13  People need to take care of their children.”2  \n14  The spread of COVID-19 into ORR facilities is not hypothetical: It has infiltrated \n15  ORR’s MercyFirst and Abbott House congregate facilities in New York,3 and an ICE \n16  immigration detainee has tested positive for COVID-19.4 Children in ORR’s custody \n17  will be placed in life-threatening danger when – not if – the contagion spreads through \n18  ORR’s congregate facilities.  \n19  ORR has immediate legal duties under the TVPRA, Flores Settlement, and Fifth \n20  Amendment to the Constitution to avoid detaining children in congregate settings as \n21  much as possible. The obvious ways of doing so are (1) expediting children’s release to \n22  waiting family whenever it is safe to do so, and (2) transferring as many children as \n23 \n1 See Amara Walker, et al., 12-year-old girl with coronavirus is on a ventilator and \n24 \nfighting for her life, CNN (Mar. 22, 2020, 11:35 AM), https://cnn.it/39mU77W. \n25  2 Id.

A growing \n2  number of jails and prisons are taking analogous steps to reduce their populations; ORR \n3  has no excuse for failing to follow suit.  \n4  Presently before the Court, inter alia, are the rights of all children in ORR custody \n5  whom the agency “is refusing or will refuse to release to parents or other available \n6  custodians within 30 days of the proposed custodian’s submission of a complete family \n7  reunification packet on the ground that the proposed custodian is or may be unfit (i.e., \n8  the ‘unfit custodian class’).” (Amended Order re Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss and \n9  Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification, Dec. 27, 2018 (ECF No. 141) at 27.) \n10  Under the current circumstances, an order requiring ORR to release children it \n11  has already detained for 30 days to ready custodians, transfer them to non-congregate \n12  settings, or else justify why it has done neither, is both reasonable and necessary to \n13  protect the rights of the nearly 1,200 children who are members of this certified class. \n14  As a collateral benefit, should ORR place a significant number of currently detained \n15  children with their families, those remaining in detention will have both more ability to \n16  practice social distancing and more medical resources available to them if they fall ill, \n17  increasing their chance of protecting themselves against the current pandemic. \n18  II. STATEMENT OF FACTS\n19  A. The COVID-19 Global Pandemic Demands Extraordinary Measures\nBe Taken to Protect Class Members.\n20 \nCOVID-19 is a deadly and highly infectious disease that has evolved into a global \n21 \npandemic and spread to all 50 states in the U.S. (Ex. B (Declaration of Dr. Julie DeAun \n22 \nGraves ¶ 6 (“Graves Decl.”)); Ex. C (Declaration of Dr. Jaimie Meyer ¶ 20 (“Meyer \n23 \nDecl.”))).5 The disease spreads through respiratory droplets and can be transmitted \n24 \nthrough person-to-person contact – including contact with asymptomatic individuals – \n25 \nand through contact with inanimate surfaces.

(Graves Decl. ¶ 6.)6 Given \n3  the severe shortage of COVID-19 tests, these numbers underestimate the true spread of \n4  the disease. (Id. ¶ 7.) Unfortunately, this pandemic has already reached the ORR system, \n5  with several staff members at ORR facilities testing positive for COVID-19.7 \n6  B.  Class Members Residing in Congregate Settings Are at Grave Risk of \nContracting COVID-19. \n7 \nThe vast majority of children in ORR custody live in congregate settings, where \n8 \nthey spend all of their time in close proximity to other children and staff members.8 The \n9 \nCDC has warned that detained individuals who “live, work, eat, study, and recreate \n10 \nwithin congregate environments” are at heightened risk of contracting COVID-19.9 \n11 \n1.  Pandemic risks in congregate settings are dire. \n12 \nThere is no cure or vaccine for this highly contagious virus. (Graves Decl. ¶ 8.) \n13 \n  The only way to avoid transmission of COVID-19 is for individuals to practice “social \n14 \ndistancing” (maintaining a distance of at least six feet from the nearest person) and \n15 \nfrequent hand washing. (Id.; Ex. E (Declaration of Dr. Nancy Y. Wang ¶ 12 (“Wang \n16 \nDecl.”))). For this reason, the CDC deems social distancing a “cornerstone of reducing \n17 \ntransmission of respiratory diseases such as COVID-19.”10  \n18 \n19 \n                                           \n20  6  For  updated  statistics,  see  Coronavirus  COVID-19  Global  Cases,  Ctr.

Over 800 people tested positive for COVID-19 on cruise ships in Japan and \n4  off the coast of California.11 At a nursing home facility in Washington, two-thirds of \n5  the residents and 47 staff tested positive for COVID-19, with 35 people ultimately dying \n6  from the virus.12 On March 21, 2020, Mayor de Blasio announced that at least 21 \n7  inmates and 17 employees at the Rikers Island Correctional Center tested positive for \n8  COVID-19, a drastic increase from the first case identified just three days earlier.13 For \n9  this reason, correctional public health experts recommend the release of those most \n10  vulnerable to COVID-19. (Ex. D (Letter to Congress at 6) (“Finally, regarding the need \n11  to implement immediate social distancing to reduce the likelihood of exposure to \n12  detainees, facility personnel, and the general public, it is essential to consider releasing \n13  all detainees who do not pose an immediate risk to public safety.”).) \n \n14  Reducing the number of individuals in congregate care protects the safety of \n15  those individuals as well as the communities around them. An outbreak of COVID-19 \n16  in a congregate environment could quickly overwhelm local health care services and \n17  cause individuals to be transported to more distant hospitals and clinics, utilizing more \n18  resources  and  potentially  exposing  health  care  workers  in  communities  where  the \n19  disease is not yet prevalent. (Graves Decl. ¶ 31; Ex. D (Letter to Congress at 4).)  \n20  2.  The conditions at ORR facilities increase the pandemic risks. \n21  The communal living that defines congregate care renders it nearly impossible \n22  for detained individuals, including children in ORR facilities, to engage in practices – \n23                                             \n11 Victoria Forster, What Have Scientists Learned About COVID-19 and Coronavirus \n24 \nBy Using Cruise Ship Data?, FORBES, (Mar. 22, 2020) https://bit.ly/2UeSgNS. \n25  12 Jack Healy & Serge F.

(Wang Decl. ¶ 16, Graves Decl. ¶¶ 10-11; Ex. D (Letter to \n3  Congress at 4).) The majority of children in ORR shelters, group homes, residential \n4  treatment centers, staff-secure facilities, and secure facilities live in close quarters, share \n5  multiple communal spaces, and cannot consistently maintain the minimum six foot \n6  distance from others. (Graves Decl. ¶¶ 10-11; Wang Decl. ¶ 16; Ex. F (Declaration of \n7  Anthony Enriquez ¶¶ 11, 21, 29 (“Enriquez Decl.”)); Ex. G (Declaration of Hannah P. \n8  Flamm ¶ 12 (“Flamm Decl.”))). \n9  ORR facilities often house multiple children in single rooms, with some sleeping \n10  in bunk beds placed close together. (Enriquez Decl. ¶¶ 12, 22, 30; Flamm Decl. ¶¶ 13, \n11  25.) Children are required to participate in group activities and classes where they share \n12  space with others in a confined area. (Enriquez Decl. ¶¶ 7, 18; Flamm Decl. ¶¶ 8-9, 22-\n13  23; Ex. H (Declaration of Rachel Rutter ¶¶ 5-6, 26 (“Rutter Decl.”))). Children share \n \n14  school materials, telephones, televisions, dining tables, and other equipment with other \n15  children. (Enriquez Decl. ¶¶ 7, 18, 26; Flamm Decl. ¶¶ 6, 20; Rutter Decl. ¶¶ 4-6, 11.) \n16  Children also eat their meals in communal areas, in close proximity to other children \n17  and staff, which creates a dangerous situation for the spread of COVID-19. (Enriquez \n18  Decl. ¶¶ 13, 23, 31; Flamm Decl. ¶¶ 15, 27; Rutter Decl. ¶¶ 14-15; Graves Decl. ¶ 10.)  \n19  In addition, toilets, sinks, and showers are shared and regularly used by large \n20  numbers of children. (Flamm Decl. ¶ 14; Rutter Decl. ¶¶ 12-13, 16.) Some facilities \n21  require children to ask permission to use the bathroom and require staff to accompany \n22  children to the bathroom. (Flamm Decl. ¶¶ 14, 26.)  \n23  Like other detention centers, ORR facilities are accessible to staff and other \n24  outside visitors who may transmit the virus. (Meyer Decl. ¶ 8; Graves Decl. ¶¶ 10, 23; \n25  Wang Decl. ¶ 17.) The CDC has warned that “[t]here are many opportunities for \n26  COVID-19 to be introduced into a correctional or detention facility, including daily \n27  staff ingress and egress; transfer of incarcerated/detained persons between facilities and \n28  systems, to court appearances, and to outside medical visits; and visits from family, \nMEMO.

(Enriquez Decl. ¶¶ \n4  8-10, 19-20, 27-28, 33; Flamm Decl. ¶¶ 7, 11, 21; Rutter Decl. ¶ 25.) To date, staff at \n5  two ORR facilities have tested positive for COVID-19 – Abbott House in Irvington, \n6  New York, and Mercy First in Syosset, New York.15 It has also recently been reported \n7  that an ICE detainee tested positive for COVID-19.16 \n8  3.  The pandemic risks to detained children are particularly grave. \n9  Children in ORR custody are at risk of serious illness if they contract COVID-\n10  19, and often face particular vulnerabilities to the virus. Severe illness and death from \n11  COVID-19 have been reported in people of all ages, including children. (Graves Decl. \n12  ¶ 7; Wang Decl. ¶ 9.) Even children without identifiable risk factors can become \n13  seriously ill from COVID-19.17 The largest study of pediatric COVID-19 patients to \n \n14  date shows that approximately 6% of infected children and 11% of infected infants had \n15  severe or critical cases. These cases included children and infants who suffered from \n16  respiratory failure, shock, encephalopathy, heart failure, coagulation dysfunction, acute \n17  kidney injury, and life-threatening organ dysfunction.18 Tragically, California reported \n18  its first death of a minor linked to COVID-19 on March 24, 2020.19 \n19 \n                                           \n20  14 Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in \nCorrectional and Detention Facilities (Ex.

(Graves Decl. ¶ 12; see generally Ex. I (Declaration of Dr. \n6  Mira Zein (“Zein Decl.”)). Certain children are at even higher risk of serious illness if \n7  they  contract  COVID-19,  including  those  with  pre-existing  health  conditions  or \n8  compromised immune systems,21 or who are pregnant or parenting. (Flamm Decl. ¶ 31; \n9  Wang Decl. ¶ 19.) \n10  And  yet  many  ORR  facilities  have  limited  capacity  to  provide  appropriate \n11  medical care or mental health services. (Graves Decl. ¶ 31; Enriquez Decl. ¶ 33; Flamm \n12  Decl. ¶ 17-18; Rutter Decl. ¶¶ 18-23, 27.) \n13  The uncertainty and anxiety created by this pandemic creates particular risks for \n \n14  children. (Ex. J (Declaration of Dr. Craig Haney ¶¶ 12-16 (“Haney Decl.”))). Now more \n15  than ever, children need the support of caring family or caregivers. (Id.) To the extent \n16  that ORR programs respond to this public health risk by further isolating children and \n17  limiting opportunities for recreation or visits, this may further traumatize vulnerable \n18  children.

(See Graves Decl. ¶¶ 13-20; Wang Decl. ¶¶ 20-26.)  \n3  The CDC has stated in no uncertain terms that “[t]he best way to prevent illness \n4  is to avoid being exposed to this virus.” 22 In order to minimize exposure, current CDC \n5  guidance  stresses  the  importance  of  practicing  “social  distancing”  and  frequently \n6  washing hands.23 The CDC defines social distancing as “remaining out of congregate \n7  settings, avoiding mass gatherings, and maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 \n8  meters) from others when possible.”24 On March 16, 2020, the White House introduced \n9  “The President’s Coronavirus Guidelines for America,” which asked everyone in the \n10  nation to “avoid social gatherings in groups of more than 10 people,” avoid visiting \n11  “long-term care facilities unless to provide critical assistance,” “[d]isinfect frequently \n12  used items and surfaces as much as possible,” and “close schools in affected and \n13  surrounding areas” as well as indoor and outdoor venues where groups of people \n \n14  generally congregate, such as restaurants, food courts, and gyms.25 \n15  The ORR Guidance makes no mention of requiring or encouraging social or \n16  physical distancing between children or staff, nor of limiting the gathering of groups of \n17  children or staff within facilities. (See Graves Decl. ¶14, Wang Decl. ¶ 21; Ex. K (ORR \n18  Interim  Guidance).)  This  is  not  surprising,  as  it  is  nearly  impossible  for  children \n19  detained in ORR facilities to engage in appropriate social distancing to prevent the \n20  transmission of COVID-19. (Enriquez Decl. ¶¶ 11, 21, 29; Flamm Decl. ¶ 12.) Unless \n21  the number of children at these facilities is drastically reduced, the majority of these \n22  facilities have insufficient space to allow children to maintain the required six-foot \n23                                             \n22 How to Protect Yourself, CDC, https://bit.ly/33Pkr9p (last reviewed Mar. 18, 2020). \n24 \n23 Id. \n25  24 Interim US Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Persons \nwith Potential Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Exposures: Geographic Risk \n26 \nand  Contacts  of  Laboratory-confirmed  Cases,  CDC,  https://bit.ly/2QKU4w1  (last \n27  updated Mar. 22, 2020). \n25 The President’s Coronavirus Guidelines for America: 15 Days to Slow the Spread, \n28 \nTHE WHITE HOUSE & CDC (Mar. 16, 2020), https://bit.ly/2Jfk7r7. \nMEMO.

(See \n7  Graves Decl. ¶ 18; Wang Decl. ¶ 22.) \n8  •  Anticipate  a  situation  in  which  more  children  need  to  be  quarantined  than \n9  facilities’ isolation rooms can handle. (Graves Decl. ¶ 17; Wang Decl. ¶ 24.) \n10  •  Ensure that children have independent access to hand washing and sanitizing \n11  supplies. (See Graves Decl. ¶ 20.)   \n12  •  Provide a screening or testing protocol for children not deemed to be “at risk” but \n13  still exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms, who could spread the disease. (See Graves \n \n14  Decl. ¶ 19; Wang Decl. ¶ 25.) \n15    On March 23, 2020, the CDC released “Interim Guidance on Management of \n16  Coronavirus  Disease  2019  (COVID-19)  in  Correctional  and  Detention  Facilities” \n17  (“CDC Detention Facility Guidance”). (Ex. L.) The CDC Detention Facility Guidance \n18  acknowledges that “(i)ncarcerated/detained persons live, work, eat, study, and recreate \n19  within congregate environments, heightening the potential for COVID-19 to spread \n20  once introduced,” and instructs facilities to “implement social distancing strategies to \n21  increase  the  physical  space  between  incarcerated/detained  persons  (ideally  6  feet \n22  between all individuals, regardless of the presence of symptoms),” but acknowledges \n23  that “not all strategies will be feasible in all facilities.” (Id.) Partial implementation of \n24  social distancing will not adequately protect individuals from the spread of disease. (See \n25  Graves Decl. ¶ 28.) \n26  ORR may issue updated guidance in the coming days or weeks that adheres more \n27  closely to the new CDC Detention Facility Guidance.

ORR’s COVID-19 Guidelines Fall Far Below Federal, State, \nand Local Mandates to Reduce the Spread of COVID-19.  \n5 \nIn accordance with the CDC and federal guidelines discussed above, numerous \n6 \nfederal, state, and local agencies have imposed swift mandates to reduce the spread of \n7 \nCOVID-19 in public and congregate settings such as nursing homes, homeless shelters, \n8 \nschools, jails, and prisons. These mandates consistently prioritize social distancing, \n9 \nincreased sanitation, education, reduced visitation, and release. In many instances, the \n10 \nactions taken are even more protective than those recommended by the CDC. \n11 \nIndeed, numerous states have issued extraordinary and unprecedented measures \n12 \nto ensure “social distancing” and to date over 160 million Americans have been ordered \n13 \n  to “shelter in place.” 26 For example, on March 19, 2020, Governor Gavin Newsom \n14 \nordered 40 million Californians to stay in their homes, with limited exceptions, and \n15 \nmaintain a minimum distance of 6 feet from others.27 The following day, New York \n16 \nissued similar orders, requiring a distance of “at least six feet” between people in public, \n17 \ncancelling all “non-essential gatherings of individuals of any size for any reasons,” \n18 \nclosing all non-essential business, and requiring those essential business that remain \n19 \nopen to “implement rules that help facilitate social distancing of at least six feet.”28 \n20 \nWithin  the  past  two  weeks,  Washington  D.C.  and  forty-six  states  have  mandated \n21 \nstatewide school closures,29 with only four states left to follow.30  \n22 \n                                           \n23  26 Sarah Mervosh and Denise Lu, See Which States and Cities Have Told Residents to \nStay Home, THE NEW YORK TIMES, Mar. 24, 2020. \n24 \n27  Coronavirus  (COVID-19)  in  California,  CALIFORNIA  STATE  GOVERNMENT, \n25  https://covid19.ca.gov/ (last Mar. 24, 2020). \n28 Gov.

On February 24, 2020, New York issued guidance for homeless \n3  shelters, which recommends a minimum distance of three to six feet between beds and \n4  head-to-toe  or  toe-to-toe  sleeping  arrangements;  barriers  between  beds  (such  as \n5  curtains); separating symptomatic residents in private rooms with separate bathrooms \n6  where available; and staggered mealtimes and use of common areas.31 Staff are advised \n7  to clean their hands in accordance with CDC guidelines, and hand sanitizer is to be \n8  made available to residents along with tissues, soap and paper towels for hand washing, \n9  and face masks.32 Even so, individuals in New York homeless shelters have still tested \n10  positive for COVID-19. 33 Recognizing that large shelters are particularly susceptible to \n11  the spread of COVID-19, California is setting up shelters in trailers, hotels and motels \n12  to facilitate social distancing.34  \n13  In the prison and jail context, similar concerns have been raised.

STANDARDS FOR ISSUANCE OF TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n6  A plaintiff seeking preliminary relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 \n7  must establish “that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer \n8  irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in \n9  his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.” Winter v. Nat’l Res. Def. \n10  Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008); Washington v. Trump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1159 n.3 \n11  (9th  Cir.  2017)  (noting  standards  for  issuing  temporary  restraining  orders  and \n12  preliminary injunctions are “substantially identical”).

Thus, when the likelihood \n15  of grave irreparable injury is palpable and the balance of equities tips sharply in a \n16  plaintiffs’ favor, the plaintiffs need only “demonstrate a fair chance of success on the \n17  merits or questions serious enough to require litigation.” Arc of Cal. v.

The threat of \n2  irreparable injury to their health and safety is palpable, and for those detained at least \n3  30 days while ORR evaluates their potential custodians, the balance of the equities \n4  clearly tips sharply in their favor.  \n5  Class Members therefore need only demonstrate “a fair chance of success on the \n6  merits or questions serious enough to require litigation” to secure preliminary relief. \n7  Arc of Cal., 757 F.3d at 993-94 (internal quotations and citation omitted); All. for the \n8  Wild Rockies, 632 F.3d at 1132 (“‘[S]erious questions going to the merits’ and a \n9  hardship balance that tips sharply toward the plaintiff can support issuance of an \n10  injunction, assuming the other two elements of the Winter test are also met.”). Class \n11  Members’ prospects here far exceed a “fair chance” of succeeding on the merits. \n12  The Flores Settlement, the TVPRA, and the First and Fifth Amendments to the \n13  U.S. Constitution each vest children who have custodians available to receive them with \n \n14  substantive rights against ORR’s keeping them in congregate care, especially during a \n15  global pandemic. Given a health crisis that will only worsen in the coming days and \n16  weeks, Class Members’ requested due process relief easily satisfies the Mathews v. \n17  Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), balancing test. See infra Sec. IV.C.3.  \n18  A.  ORR Violates The TVPRA By Continuing To Detain Children With \nViable Sponsors In Congregate Settings. \n19 \n20  The TVPRA requires ORR to “promptly” place detained children “in the least \n21  restrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child,” generally with “a suitable \n22  family member . . .” or other available guardian. 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(2)(A). Only if a \n23  suitable family member or other guardian is not available to take custody of a minor \n24  may  ORR  continue  to  detain  him  or  her  “in  a  specialized  juvenile  program  or \n25  facility.” Flores v. Sessions, 862 F.3d at 871.  \n26  By definition, all members of the “unfit custodian” class – and, a fortiori, those \n27  whom the requested relief would protect – have family or other custodians available to \n28 \nMEMO.

Their ongoing detention in congregate care in the face of a rapidly \n2  spreading public health crisis is a prima facie violation of the TVPRA. \n3  According to the most recent ORR data at Plaintiffs’ disposal, as of March 13, \n4  2020, ORR had 3,622 children in custody, 1,193 – nearly a third – of whom have been \n5  placed in congregate settings for 30 days or more. (Holguín Decl., ¶ 3.) ORR’s data do \n6  not indicate why the agency has yet to release these children, nor how many of them \n7  have available custodians, yet the vast majority likely do.39 \n8  Unless they meet the specific criteria, the TVPRA requires ORR to release \n9  children to any available custodian who “is capable of providing for the child’s physical \n10  and mental well-being.” 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(3)(A). In determining whether a proposed \n11  custodian meets this standard, the TVPRA requires ORR (1) to verify “the custodian’s \n12  identity,” and (2) “relationship to the child, if any,” and (3) “make an independent \n13  finding that the individual has not engaged in any activity that would indicate a potential \n \n14  risk to the child.” Id.  \n15  The first two determinations are fairly straightforward, and may be verified \n16  following the submission of a completed “family reunification application” (“FRA”). \n17  (See Ex. N (ORR Policy Guide § 2.2.4 (when submitting an FRA, “potential sponsors \n18  must provide documentation of identity, address, and relationship to the child”).) As for \n19  the third determination – whether the proposed sponsor has “engaged in any activity \n20 \n                                           \n21 \n39  ORR  categorizes  detained  children  pursuant  to  their  relationship  with  potential \n22  custodians.  (Ex.  N  (ORR  Policy  Guide  §  2.2.1).)  The  approximate  percentage  of \nchildren in ORR custody in each category are as follows: \n23 \n•  42% in “Category 1” – i.e., they have parents or guardians in the U.S.;  \n24  •  47% in “Category 2” – i.e., they have an “immediate” relative – brother, sister, \ngrandparent, aunt, uncle, or first cousin –to whom they could be released; \n25 \n•  11% in “Category 3” – i.e., children with “other sponsors,” such as “more distant \n26 \nrelatives and unrelated adult individuals”; \n27  •  The remainder are “Category 4” – i.e., children for whom ORR has identified no \npotential custodian. \n28 \n(Holguín Decl. ¶ 4; Ex.

N (ORR Policy Guide § 2.5.3).) ORR also \n5  completes background checks of all sponsors and adult household members through a \n6  public records criminal history check and a sex offender registry check. (Ex. N (ORR \n7  Policy  Guide  §  2.5).)  These  are  simple  internet  searches  that  can  be  completed \n8  expeditiously by a case manager. (Ex. M. (ORR Manual of Procedures at § 2.5).) \n9  Although ORR chooses to require certain sponsors, household members, and adult \n10  caregivers to further undergo an FBI National Criminal History Check, Child Abuse \n11  and Neglect (CA/N) Check, and State Criminal History Repository Check and/or Local \n12  Police Check, these are not mandated by the TVPRA.  \n13  In the vast majority of cases,40 any additional delay is often attributable either to \n \n14  (1)  discretionary  investigatory  measures,  or  (2)  administrative  inefficiency  or \n15  indifference. In establishing the requirements to vet proposed custodians, ORR has a \n16  track record of arbitrariness and vacillation.

Linton  et  al., Detention  of  Immigrant  Children,  PEDIATRICS,  Apr.  2017,  at  6 \n7  (“[E]xpert consensus has concluded that even brief detention can cause psychological \n8  trauma and induce long-term mental health risks for children.”). Plaintiffs reject the \n9  presumption that ORR’s obligation to vet proposed custodians necessarily offsets that \n10  harm. These delays must now be evaluated in light of the extraordinary circumstances \n11  presented by this pandemic. The science is clear: if ORR fails to end congregate \n12  detention, or at least reduce it dramatically, it is only a matter of time before COVID-\n13  19 illness rages among children forced into close proximity with one another.  \n \n14  Thirty days should be more than enough for ORR to assess post-release risk. \n15  (E.g., Ex. P (Declaration of James M. Owens ¶ 6 (“Owens Decl.”) (state dependency \n16  courts determine whether there is cause to detain children within three days)); Ex. M \n17  (ORR Manual of Procedures, at § 2.2.2 (care providers generally expected to complete \n18  custodian evaluations within 10-21 days), § 2.7.2 (case coordinators expected to make \n19  recommendation within 1 business day), and § 2.7.3 (Federal Field Specialists expected \n20  to  make  release  decisions  within  1-2  business  days  of  receiving  case  coordinator \n21  recommendations)).  Any  marginal  gains  to  child  safety  from  ORR’s  distending \n22  investigations for more than 30 days cannot outweigh the harm congregate detention \n23  will inevitably cause. Leaving children on the tracks with the COVID-19 train fast \n24  approaching while ORR takes even more time is unconscionable. \n25  There is accordingly no serious question that ORR detaining over one thousand \n26  children in congregate settings for more than 30 days during a raging pandemic, even \n27  though they have custodians available to care for them, is a prima facie violation of the \n28 \nMEMO.

ORR Violates The Flores Settlement By Refusing To Release Children \nTo Available Custodians, And Instead Forcing Them To Remain In \n4  Unsafe Or Unsanitary Conditions. \n5  The injunctive relief Plaintiffs seek is also a necessary step to protect against the \n6  erroneous deprivation of children’s substantive rights under the Flores Settlement41 to \n7  (1) prompt release and (2) safe and sanitary conditions, rights that have become vastly \n8  more important to children in congregate detention during a pandemic. In particular, the \n9  Flores Settlement requires: \n10  •  “Where [ORR] determines that the detention of the minor is not required either \n11  to secure his or her timely appearance before [DHS] or the immigration court, or \n12  to ensure the minor’s safety or that of others, [ORR] shall release a minor from \n13  its  custody  without  unnecessary  delay  . . .  [to]  an  adult \n \n14  relative . . .” (Flores Settlement ¶ 14 (emphasis added));  \n15  •  “[ORR] . . . shall make and record the prompt and continuous efforts on its part \n16  toward . . . the release of the minor . . .” (id. ¶ 18); \n17  •  ORR must house children “in facilities that are safe and sanitary and that are \n18  consistent with [its] concern for the particular vulnerability of minors” (Id. ¶ 12); \n19  •  ORR must place detained children in state-licensed facilities that comply with \n20  both state health and safety standards and the minimum standards listed in Exhibit \n21  1 to the Settlement, which include “[p]roper physical care and maintenance, \n22  including suitable living accommodations.” (id. ¶¶ 6, 19 Ex. 1, ¶ A.1). \n23  During  a  public  health  crisis, ORR  holding  class  members  in  congregate \n24  detention even after it has already had 30 days to evaluate available custodians is in \n25                                             \n41  This  Court  has  clarified  that,  although  Plaintiffs  may  not  seek  to  enforce \n26 \nthe Flores Settlement  in  this  action,  “Plaintiffs  may  pursue  due  process  claims \n27  predicated on Defendants’ failure to provide sufficient procedural safeguards for alien \nminors to exercise their Flores rights”  (ECF No. 141 at 10-11). \n28 \n \nMEMO.

This Court should require ORR to articulate \n3  good cause for exposing children to the clear dangers of congregate detention in lieu of \n4  release to their families or transfer to non-congregate settings. \n5  C.  ORR Violates the Due Process Clause Of The Fifth Amendment By \nExposing Vulnerable Children To Clearly Dangerous Conditions. \n6 \n7  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment protects individuals against (i) \n8  “arbitrary action of government” – a denial of procedural due process – or (ii) “the \n9  exercise of power without any reasonable justification in the service of a legitimate \n10  government objective” – a denial of substantive due process. City of Sacramento v. \n11  Lewis,  523 U.S.  833,  845-46  (1998)  (citations  and  internal  quotations  omitted). \n12  Detaining Class Members in congregate facilities that are inherently unsafe in the midst \n13  of the COVID-19 pandemic rather than releasing them to available custodians violates \n \n14  both substantive and procedural due process.  \n15  1.  ORR  has  an  affirmative  duty  to  guarantee  Class  Members’ \nreasonable health and safety. \n16 \n17  ORR has an affirmative duty to place Class Members in facilities capable of \n18  ensuring  their  reasonable  health  and  safety.  “When  the  State  takes  a  person  into \n19  its custody and holds him there against his will, the Constitution imposes upon it a \n20  corresponding duty to assume some responsibility for his safety and general well-\n21  being.” DeShaney v. Winnebago Cnty. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 199-200 \n22  (1989); see also Henry A. v. Willden, 678 F.3d 991, 998 (9th Cir. 2012). The Ninth \n23  Circuit has found that a special relationship “applies to children in foster care,” Henry \n24  A., 678 F.3d at 1000, as well as others in government custody. See Wang v. Reno, 81 \n25  F.3d 808, 818 (9th Cir. 1996). As a result, ORR’s obligation to provide children in its \n26  custody with, inter alia, “medical care, and reasonable safety,” DeShaney at 200, \n27  includes reasonable protections from the risks presented by the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n28  The constitutional guarantee of “reasonable safety” protects against the risk of \nMEMO.

See Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 690 (2001). In Helling v. McKinney, \n4  the  Supreme  Court  specifically  recognized  that  the  risk  of  contracting  a \n5  communicable disease  may  constitute  an  “unsafe,  life-threatening  condition”  that \n6  threatens “reasonable safety.” 509 U.S. 25, 33 (1993). The Fifth Amendment thus \n7  protects Class Members in the government’s custody from the risk of contracting \n8  COVID-19, exacerbated by unsafe conditions inherent to congregate settings. \n9  2.  ORR’s  failure  to  release  Class  Members  expeditiously  and \nensure adequate safety measures in the midst of a pandemic \n10  violates their substantive due process rights. \n11  The  Ninth  Circuit  has  recognized  that  individuals  who  have  been  civilly \n12  committed or detained “cannot be subjected to conditions that ‘amount to punishment.’” \n13  Jones v. Blanas, 393 F.3d 918, 931, 934 (9th Cir. 2004). \n \n14  Courts in this Circuit have recognized that immigration detention may amount to \n15  punishment and violate due process “if it imposes some harm to the detainee that \n16  significantly exceeds or is independent of the inherent discomforts of confinement and \n17  is not reasonably related to a legitimate governmental objective or is excessive in \n18  relation  to  the  legitimate  governmental objective.”  Unknown  Parties,  2016  WL \n19  8188563, at *5. Here, as the Ninth Circuit recognized, the continued detention of Class \n20  Members in congregate care settings both (i) imposes harm that significantly exceeds \n21  the  inherent  discomforts  of  their  confinement  and  (ii)  is  excessive  in  relation  to \n22  legitimate governmental objectives.

OF PS & AS ISO EX PARTE APPLICATION  \n  19  FOR TRO AND OSC RE: PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nCASE NO. 2:18-CV-05741 DMG PLA  \n \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-1   Filed 03/25/20   Page 28 of 33   Page ID\n \n #:5026\n1  the court sua sponte orders that Petitioner be immediately released from detention ….”). \n2  First, it is indisputable that the grave risk to all Class Members of potential \n3  exposure to COVID-19 is both significantly greater than and unrelated to the “inherent \n4  discomforts” generally associated with detention in ORR’s custody.  \n5  Second, although Defendants maintain that ORR’s detention of Class Members \n6  beyond 30 days is required by law to prevent the release of children to custodians who \n7  may  abuse  and  neglect  them,  the  continued  detention  of  Class  Members  in  life-\n8  threatening congregate care settings is grossly excessive in view of the substantial and \n9  immediate threat posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Accelerating release of children \n10  to available sponsors would dramatically reduce the harm to all Class Members by both \n11  vastly reducing their own risk of exposure to COVID-19 and allowing children without \n12  sponsors to be placed in less crowded settings. Defendants’ failure to expedite release \n13  to protect the health and safety of all class members is thus excessive and unjustifiable.  \n \n14  3.  ORR’s failure to release Class Members expeditiously in the \nmidst  of  a  life-threatening  pandemic  clearly  violates  their \n15  procedural due process rights. \n16  In  addition,  ORR’s  failure  to  expedite  release  of  Class  Members  given  the \n17  imminent threat to their health and safety posed by COVID-19 violates procedural due \n18  process  as  guaranteed  by  the  Fifth  Amendment.  As  this  Court  has  recognized, \n19  “[Procedural] due process . . . has three elements: (1) a liberty or property interest \n20  protected by the Constitution; (2) a deprivation of the interest by the government; (3) \n21  lack of process.” (ECF No. 141 at 13 (quoting Portman v. Cnty. of Santa Clara, 995 \n22  F.2d 898, 904 (9th Cir. 1993)).) The Class Members easily satisfy these factors.  \n23  First, as this Court has recognized, Class Members have substantive interests \n24  implicated by their detention in ORR custody that give rise to due process protection, \n25  all of which are heightened by the unprecedented threat posed by COVID-19: \n26  •  A fundamental right to freedom from detention, e.g., Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. \n27  678, 690 (2001); Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 316 (1993); \n28  •  a  substantial  liberty  interest  in  family  unity  and  family  association,  e.g., \nMEMO. OF PS & AS ISO EX PARTE APPLICATION  \n  20  FOR TRO AND OSC RE: PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nCASE NO. 2:18-CV-05741 DMG PLA  \n \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-1   Filed 03/25/20   Page 29 of 33   Page ID\n \n #:5027\n1  Rosenbaum v. Washoe Cty., 663 F.3d 1071, 1079 (9th Cir. 2011); and \n2  •  rights to prompt release under the TVPRA and the Flores Agreement (see ECF \n3  No. 141 at 14-15).  \n4  Second,  ORR’s  actions  deprive  Class  Members  of  these  constitutionally \n5  protected interests. Indeed, ORR’s delay in releasing children in its custody is deeply \n6  harmful to children even under ordinary circumstances, and is especially dangerous in \n7  light of the current pandemic. See Stanley v. Ill., 405 U.S. 645, 647 (1972) (even a \n8  temporary deprivation of the right to family integrity is constitutionally significant). \n9  Third, ORR’s procedures governing release of Class Members fall short of those \n10  required under the Due Process Clause. Due process is “flexible and calls for such \n11  procedural protections as the particular situation demands.” See Morrissey v. Brewer, \n12  408 U.S. 471, 481, (1972). Normally, “[t]he consequences of an erroneous commitment \n13  decision  are  more  tragic  where  children  are  involved”  because  “childhood  is  a \n \n14  particularly vulnerable time of life and children erroneously institutionalized during \n15  their formative years may bear the scars for the rest of their lives.” Reno v. Flores, 507 \n16  U.S. at 318 (O’Connor, J. and Souter, J., concurring) (internal citations omitted). Now, \n17  in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the consequences of an erroneous commitment \n18  decision for these children could be deadly.43 See supra Sec. II. \n19  Given the extraordinary circumstances presented by this pandemic, due process \n20  requires at a minimum that ORR (1) release all Unfit Custodian Class Members to \n21  available sponsors absent credible evidence that such sponsors would harm or neglect \n22  them, (2) place such Class Members in non-congregate care that satisfies Centers for \n23  Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, or (3) provide all such Class Members with \n24  evidence supporting ORR’s decision not to release them and an opportunity to be heard \n25  regarding the grounds for continued congregate detention as set forth in Plaintiffs’ \n26  requested Temporary Restraining Order. ORR currently affords Class Members none \n27 \n                                           \n28 \n43 See supra footnote 17. \nMEMO.

(Haney Decl. ¶¶ 12-16.) \n9  V.  ABSENT  A  TEMPORARY  RESTRAINING  ORDER,  CLASS  MEMBERS  IN \nCONGREGATE FACILITIES WILL SUFFER IRREPARABLE INJURY. \n10 \n11  A plaintiff must also demonstrate “immediate threatened injury as a prerequisite \n12  to preliminary injunctive relief.” Caribbean Marine Servs. Co. v. Baldrige, 844 F.2d \n13  668, 674 (9th Cir. 1988). “Irreparable harm is the single most important prerequisite for \n \n14  the issuance of a preliminary injunction.” Spark Indus., LLC v. Kretek Int’l, Inc., No. \n15  CV 14-5726-GW(ASX), 2014 WL 12600262, at *3 (C.D. Cal. July 29, 2014) (citations \n16  omitted).  Increased  risk  of  exposure  to  a  deadly  virus  by  virtue  of  placement  in \n17  congregate care represents a paradigmatic example of imminent irreparable harm. \n18  An  imminent  threat  to  health  and  safety  constitutes  irreparable  harm.  For \n19  example, in Unknown Parties, the district court – as later affirmed by the Ninth Circuit \n20  – issued an injunction to curb physiological, health and/ or medical risks to civil \n21  immigration detainees, including “being exposed to communicable diseases.” 2016 WL \n22  8188563, at *15 (emphasis added). Likewise, in Harris v. Bd. of Supervisors, Los \n23 \n                                           \n24  44 Plaintiffs assert that due process requires greater protections than currently sought in \nthis Temporary Restraining Order. See First Amended Complaint ¶ 111.  Plaintiffs \n25  reserve their right to seek such protections through a preliminary injunction.  \n45 In the child welfare systems of all fifty states, children may not be detained for want \n26 \nof a qualified custodian without affording them and/or their parents or other potential \n27  custodians  a  prompt  hearing  before  a  judge  or  other  neutral  and  detached \ndecisionmaker, during which allegations of unfitness are tested via trial-like procedures \n28 \nand any ensuing finding of unsuitability must be based on competent evidence. \nMEMO. OF PS & AS ISO EX PARTE APPLICATION  \n  22  FOR TRO AND OSC RE: PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nCASE NO. 2:18-CV-05741 DMG PLA  \n \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-1   Filed 03/25/20   Page 31 of 33   Page ID\n \n #:5029\n1  Angeles Cty., the Ninth Circuit affirmed a preliminary injunction where the closure of \n2  a hospital and bed reductions would irreparably injure chronically ill indigent patients \n3  by inflicting “pain, infection, amputation, medical complications, and death due to \n4  delayed treatment.” 366 F.3d 754, 756 (9th Cir. 2004); see also Jones v. Tex. Dep’t. of \n5  Crim. Justice, 880 F.3d 756, 760 (5th Cir. 2018) (denial of adequate medical care for \n6  prisoner’s diabetes constituted irreparable harm). \n7  In light of the rapid spread of COVID-19 across the country and the impossibility \n8  of  maintaining  proper  social  distancing  in  ORR  congregate  care  facilities,  Class \n9  Members face an unacceptable risk of contracting COVID-19 in ORR custody. This \n10  danger will only grow the longer Class Members remain detained in unsafe facilities. \n11  Class Members who contract COVID-19 are at risk of death or serious illness, including \n12  the potential for permanent impairment. (Graves Decl. ¶ 7.) Even Class Members who \n13  display less severe symptoms will face the discomfort of being ill and, if they are \n \n14  quarantined, the traumatic psychological effects of isolation far from caring family \n15  members or other caregivers. (Wang Decl. ¶ 23.)  \n16  All  Class  Members,  even  those  who  do  not  become  ill,  are  vulnerable  to \n17  irreparable psychological harm from the anxiety and likely heightened isolation of \n18  being detained in the midst of a pandemic. (Haney Decl. ¶¶ 12-17.) See Edmo v. \n19  Corizon, Inc., 935 F.3d 757, 797-98 (9th Cir. 2019) (noting that “severe, ongoing \n20  psychological distress” can constitute irreparable harm); Stanley v. Univ. of S. Cal., 13 \n21  F.3d 1313, 1324 n.5 (9th Cir. 1994) (finding legal support for conclusion that “serious \n22  emotional distress” cannot be remedied through money damages).  \n23  Conditions in ORR facilities are incompatible with preserving Class Members’ \n24  health and mental wellbeing. These  unsafe conditions, along with the lack of available \n25  medical care pose an extremely high likelihood of irreparable harm to Plaintiffs. \n26  VI.  THE BALANCE OF EQUITIES FAVORS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n27  In this case, the equities and public interest merge into a single balancing test \n28  because Defendants are government officials. See Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 \nMEMO. OF PS & AS ISO EX PARTE APPLICATION  \n  23  FOR TRO AND OSC RE: PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nCASE NO. 2:18-CV-05741 DMG PLA  \n \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-05741-DMG-PLA   Document 227-1   Filed 03/25/20   Page 32 of 33   Page ID\n \n #:5030\n1  (2009); see also Cal. v. Azar, 911 F.3d 558, 581 (9th Cir. 2018). “A court must balance \n2  the competing claims of injury and must consider the effect on each party of the granting \n3  or withholding of the requested relief.” Arc of Cal., 757 F.3d at 991 (quoting Amoco \n4  Prod. Co. v. Vill. of Gambell, 480 U.S. 531, 542 (1987)). Importantly, “the Ninth Circuit \n5  expects lower courts to protect physical harm to an individual over monetary costs to \n6  government entities.” McNearney v. Wash. Dep’t of Corr., No. 11-cv-5930 RBL/KLS, \n7  2012 WL 3545267, at *15 (W.D. Wash. June 15, 2012).  \n8  The balance here tips decidedly in favor of Plaintiffs’ interest in health and safety, \n9  which  Defendants  are  placing  at  unnecessary  risk.  Unless  this  Court  intervenes, \n10  Plaintiffs are likely to suffer serious and severe irreparable harm, including likely \n11  exposure to COVID-19. No purported government interest justifies subjecting children \n12  to this life-threatening virus. See Norsworthy v. Beard, 87 F. Supp. 3d 1164, 1193 (N.D. \n13  Cal. 2015) (holding equities sharply favored detainee who “established that she is \n \n14  suffering and is likely to continue to suffer unnecessary pain”); see also Lopez v. \n15  Heckler, 713 F.2d 1432, 1437 (9th Cir. 1983) (“Faced with . . . a conflict between \n16  financial concerns and preventable human suffering, [the court has] little difficulty \n17  concluding that the balance of hardships tips decidedly in plaintiffs’ favor.”). \n18  Granting Plaintiffs’ motion would not subject Defendants to any identifiable \n19  hardship outweighing the irreparable harm to Plaintiffs’ health and safety. Indeed, \n20  Defendants cannot point to any  harm  because  they  “‘cannot  suffer  harm  from  an \n21  injunction that merely ends an unlawful practice.’” Ms. L. v. ICE, 310 F. Supp. 3d 1133, \n22  1147 (S.D. Cal. 2018) (quoting Rodriguez v. Robbins, 715 F.3d 1127, 1145 (9th Cir. \n23  2013)). Moreover, “it is obvious that compliance with the law is in the public interest.” \n24  N.D. ex rel. parents acting as guardians ad litem v. Haw. Dep’t of Educ., 600 F.3d 1104, \n25  1113 (9th Cir. 2010); see also Small v. Avanti Health Sys., LLC, 661 F.3d 1180, 1197 \n26  (9th Cir. 2011) (The “public interest favors applying federal law correctly.”). Because \n27  the requested relief would simply mandate compliance with Constitution, TVPRA, and \n28  the Flores Settlement, the Government could suffer no harm as a result.  \nMEMO.

As  public  health  experts  have  explained,  reducing  the  number  of \n4  individuals  in  congregate  care  settings  protects  both  those  individuals  and  the \n5  communities around them. An outbreak of COVID-19 in a congregate facility, such as \n6  an ORR shelter, could quickly overtake the capacity of local health care resources, and \n7  would  likely  require  transport  of  infected  individuals,  potentially  to  areas  where \n8  COVID-19 has not yet spread. (Graves Decl. ¶ 36; Ex. D (Letter to Congress at 4.)) \n9  VII.  CONCLUSION \n10  For the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant this application for a temporary \n11  restraining order and order Defendants to show cause why a preliminary injunction \n12  should not issue in the form lodged herewith. \n13   \n \nDated:  March 25, 2019  CARLOS R.
