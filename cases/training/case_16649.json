The plaintiffs alleged that the Taylor Finishing Company, a swine concentrated animal feeding operation, illegally polluted under the Clean Water Act (CWA) and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and that this pollution endangered human health and the environment. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, sought declaratory and injunctive relief as well as attorneysโ fees and costs. The case was assigned to Judge James C. Dever III and Magistrate Judge James E. Gates.</p><p>The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants had violated the CWA and RCRA by causing the release of pollutants, including nitrogen, phosphorus, and bacteria, onto the lands and into waters surrounding defendantsโ facilities near the Neuse River Basin. The complaint described that defendants caused illegal discharges of pollutants without a permit, illegal open dumping of swine waste, and illegal treatment, storage, and disposal of swine waste. The plaintiffs argued that this disregard for disposal requirements created an imminent and substantial endangerment to human health and the environment.</p><p>Between September and November of 2013, the three defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaint claiming that this court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the plaintiff failed to serve a proper notice of intent to sue prior to filing the complaint. But before the motions were decided, on April 25, 2013, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint. The defendants filed responsive motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted. On August 26, 2013, Judge Dever denied the motion and the parties proceeded to discovery.</p><p>On October 21, 2014, the NCEJN filed a stipulation of dismissal, asking that the court dismiss their claims with prejudice and that each party bear their own costs. The court granted this motion later that month.</p><p>On November 21, 2014, the remaining defendants moved for summary judgment, claiming that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the claim due to insufficient evidence and the undisputed fact that none of the plaintiffs had suffered an injury that could be causally connected to the defendantsโ conduct. On that same day, one of the defendants moved for summary judgment of count three of the second amended complaint, claiming that the plaintiffs could not establish that there was an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment caused by the defendant. Additionally, another defendant filed a similar motion for summary judgment, even asking that the court enter judgment in their favor on the grounds that there were no genuine issues of material fact and they were entitled to judgment in their favor as a matter of law.</p><p>On January 14, 2015, Judge Gates entered a report and recommendation with the court, recommending that the court deny without prejudice the three pending motions for summary judgment. 2015 WL 1630602. On April 13, 2015, Judge Dever agreed with Judge Gates and denied the motions without prejudice. 2015 WL 1880200.</p><p>Then, defendants filed a notice of bankruptcy with the court and on June 3, 2015, the court entered an order staying the action pending resolution of the bankruptcy case. After the stay, negotiations took place and on June 29, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a notice of a proposed consent decree. The agreement required that the contaminated lagoon be inspected annually, that the defendants remove sludge from the lagoon, and that records are kept regarding the activities. The consent decree further stipulated that the parties would make a joint public statement, that the plaintiffs could not do sample testing on the defendantโs surrounding property, and that the defendants must operate their facility in accordance with the terms of the facilityโs permit. The parties agreed to seek enforcement of the terms in bankruptcy court so the court would not retain jurisdiction over the matter. </p><p>On August 13, 2018, the court approved the consent decree. The parties subsequently filed a stipulation to a voluntary dismissal of the case. The case was closed on August 29, 2018.</p>",

MCLAWHORN;  )\nand AARON MCLAWHORN,  )\n  )\n    Defendants.  )\n  ) \n \n  This case comes before the court on two motions by plaintiffs Waterkeeper Alliance, Inc. \nand  Neuse  Riverkeeper  Foundation,  Inc.  (โplaintiffsโ):    (1)  a  motion  (D.E.  93)  to  compel \ninspection and to extend time1 (โmotion to compelโ); and (2) a motion (D.E. 139) for relief \npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d) or, alternatively, for extension of the time to respond to \ndefendantsโ motions for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 6(b) (โRule 56(d) motionโ).  Also \nbefore the court is a motion (D.E. 143) by defendants Donald Taylor (โMr. Taylorโ) and Annie \nTaylor,  individually  and  d/b/a  Taylor  Finishing  (collectively  โTaylor  defendantsโ),  and \nMcLawhorn Livestock Farm, Inc., Justin T. McLawhorn, and Aaron McLawhorn (collectively \nโMcLawhorn defendantsโ) (all defendants collectively โdefendantsโ).  Defendantsโ motion seeks \nto strike the declaration of a purported expert (D.E. 139-1) submitted by plaintiffs in support of \ntheir Rule 56(d) motion.  All three motions were referred to the undersigned.  For the reasons \n                                                 \n1 Now-dismissed plaintiff North Carolina Environmental Justice Network was also a party to this motion. \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 1 of 21\n\nstated below, plaintiffsโ motion to compel will be allowed in part and denied in part; defendantsโ \nmotion to strike will be denied as moot; and it will be recommended that plaintiffsโ Rule 56(d) \nmotion be denied, but that comparable relief be provided under Rule 16.    \nBACKGROUND \nI.  PLAINTIFFSโ CLAIMS   \n  Plaintiffs, along with the North Carolina Environmental Justice Network (โNetworkโ), \ncommenced this federal citizens environmental action on 27 July 2012.  (See Compl. (D.E.  1)).  \nWith leave of court, they filed their second amended complaint (D.E. 65)โthe most current \nversionโon 25 April 2013.  The claims against the Network were dismissed with prejudice by \nstipulation on 21 October 2014 (D.E. 110). \n  The property which is the subject of the second amended complaint (โTaylor Facilityโ) is \na hog-processing farm in Jones County presently owned by the Taylor defendants and previously \nowned  by  the  McLawhorn  defendants.    (2d  Am.  Compl.  ยถยถ  28-31).    Plaintiffs  allege  that \ndefendantsโ illegal management, discharge, and disposal of swine waste has resulted in the \nrelease of pollutants onto the land and waters in the Neuse River Basin area of the coastal plain \nof North Carolina.  (Id., e.g., ยถ 1).  Plaintiffs assert claims for violations of: (1) section 505 of the \nClean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. ยง 1365, by continuing to discharge pollutants without a permit (2d \nAm. Compl. ยถยถ 58-70); (2) section 7002(a)(1)(A) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery \nAct (โRCRAโ), 42 U.S.C. ยง 6972(a)(1)(A), by allowing open dumping (2d Am. Compl. ยถยถ 71-\n84); and (3) section 7002(a)(1)(B) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. ยง 6972(a)(1)(B), by posing an imminent \nand substantial endangerment to health or the environment (2d Am. Compl. ยถยถ 85-97).  As relief, \nplaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, civil penalties, costs, and other relief.  \n2 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 2 of 21\n\n(Id.  ยถยถ  98-111).    Defendants  deny  the  material  allegations  in  plaintiffsโ  second  amended \ncomplaint.  (See generally Ans. to 2d Am. Compl. (D.E. 68, 75)).   \nII.  RELEVANT CASE HISTORY   \n  The court entered a Scheduling Order (D.E. 81) on 19 November 2013, adopting the \npartiesโ Discovery Plan (D.E. 78) with minor modifications of certain proposed deadlines.  The \nScheduling Order provided for:  the commencement of discovery on 29 October 2013 (Sch. Ord. \n1; Disc. Plan ยถยถ 3, 4.d); completion of fact discovery by 1 June 2014 (Sch. Ord. 1; Disc. Plan ยถ \n4.i); disclosure of expert reports by 8 August 2014 (Sch. Ord. ยถ 1); completion of all discovery \nby 3 October 2014 (id. ยถ 2); and filing of potentially dispositive motions by 7 November 2014 \n(id. ยถ 3).  Plaintiffs served on the Taylor defendants a request for inspection of the Taylor \nFacility on 22 January 2014 (D.E. 95 at 5-13).  By agreement of plaintiffs, the Taylor defendants \ndid not serve their response (D.E. 95 at 15-32) to the inspection request until 16 April 2014, \nbroadly objecting to it.  Over the ensuing two months, plaintiffs attempted to resolve their \ndisputes  with  the  Taylor  defendants  regarding  the  inspection  request.    Some,  but  not  all, \ndifferences were resolved.  On 20 June 2014, plaintiffs filed the instant motion to compel.  Prior \nto the filing, the Taylor defendants agreed to extension of the fact discovery deadline to 1 July \n2014.  (See 13 June 2014 Email from Taylor Defs.โ Counsel (D.E. 95 at 74)). \n  In their motion, plaintiffs sought access to the Taylor Facility for a total of about six and \na half months between 15 August 2014 and 1 July 2015 to take photographs, obtain samples, and \nperform other inspection activities.  (See Pls.โ Proposed Compel Ord. (D.E. 93-1) ยถยถ 1, 3-8).  \nPlaintiffsโ motion also sought extension of, among other deadlines, those for expert reports and \nthe completion of discovery to 7 August 2015 and 2 October 2015, respectively.  (Id. ยถ 2). \n3 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 3 of 21\n\n  Plaintiffs did not produce any expert reports by the 8 August 2014 deadline established in \nthe Scheduling Order or thereafter.  However, on 3 November 2014, they emailed to defendantsโ \ncounsel supplemental initial disclosures identifying at least five expert witnesses.  (See Defs.โ \nStrike Mot. Mem. (D.E. 144) 5; 3 Nov. 2014 Email from Pls.โ Counsel (D.E. 144-1 at 2)).2 \n  On  23  October  2014,  on  defendantsโ  motion,  the  court  extended  the  deadline  for \ndefendantsโ potentially dispositive motions to 21 November 2014.3  (See D.E. 114).  On 21 \nNovember 2014, defendants filed three separate motions for summary judgment.  (See D.E. 125-\n137).  Plaintiffs filed their motion for relief under Rule 56(d) on 5 December 2014. \n  In support of their Rule 56(d) motion, plaintiffs filed a declaration of Michael D. Smolen, \nPh.D. (D.E. 139-1), a purported expert in the environmental matters at issue.  On 10 December \n2014, defendants filed their motion to strike the Smolen Declaration.  \n  The court held a telephone conference with counsel on the motions on 11 December \n2014.  After the telephone conference, the court entered an order (D.E. 146) staying the deadline \nfor plaintiffs to respond to defendantsโ summary judgment motions pending further order of the \ncourt.    \nPLAINTIFFSโ MOTION TO COMPEL (D.E. 93) \n(Allowed in Part and Denied in Part) \nI.  INSPECTION \n  A.  Applicable Legal Standards  \n  The Federal Civil Rules enable parties to obtain information by serving requests for \ndiscovery on each other, including requests to permit entry on land to โinspect, measure, survey, \nphotograph, test, or sample the property or any designated object or operation on it.โ  Fed. R. \n                                                 \n2 The supplemental initial disclosures do not appear to have been filed with the court. \n \n3 Plaintiffs seek reconsideration of the extension order.  (See D.E. 119). \n4 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 4 of 21\n\nCiv. P. 34(a)(2); see generally Fed. R. Civ. P. 26-37.  Rule 26(b) provides for a broad scope of \ndiscovery: \nParties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant \nto any partyโs claim or defense . . . .  For good cause, the court may order \ndiscovery of any matter relevant to the subject matter involved in the action.  \nRelevant information need not be admissible at the trial if the discovery appears \nreasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.   \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1).    \n \n  At the same time, Rule 26(c) authorizes the court โfor good cause, [to] issue an order to \nprotect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or \nexpense.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c)(1).  The Fourth Circuit has held that, pursuant to this provision, \nโthe degree to which [a] proposed inspection will aid in the search for truth must be balanced \nagainst the burdens and dangers created by the inspection.โ  Belcher v. Bassett Furniture Indus., \nInc., 588 F.2d 904, 908 (4th Cir. 1978); see also Clay v. Consol Penn. Coal Co., LLC, 5:12-cv-\n92, 2013 WL 3819922, at *4 (N.D.W. Va. 12 June 2013) (โAny dangers must be balanced \nagainst the relevance and need for the inspection.โ); Johnson v. Mundy Indus. Contractors, Inc., \n7:01CV99โBO3, 2002 WL 31464984, at *2 (E.D.N.C. 15 Mar. 2002) (โ[A]n inquiry into when \nto compel an inspection goes beyond mere โrelevanceโ and must balance the need presented by \nthe moving party against the โburdens and dangers created by the inspection.โโ (quoting Belcher, \n588 F.2d at 908)).  The need for such balancing is rooted in the reality that โentry upon a party's \npremises may entail greater burdens and risks than mere production of documents,โ as to which \nthe general relevance standard of Rule 26(b) routinely controls.  Belcher, 588 F.2d at 908.  Thus, \nthe court must exercise โprecision and care in the formulation of inspection orders.โ  Id. at 911.  \nIt has been held that the burden rests on the objecting party to convince the court that the \n5 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 5 of 21\n\ninspection requested is unnecessary.  See Arkansas Game & Fish Commโn v. United States, 74 \nFed. Cl. 426, 432 (16 Nov. 2006) (citing 8A Fed. Prac. & Proced. Civ. ยง 2214).  \n  B.  Analysis \n  1.  Groundwater Sampling.  As set out in their proposed order, plaintiffs seek to \ninstall nine sampling wells on the Taylor Facility at locations originally identified in their request \nfor inspection and to take groundwater samples from the wells on a biweekly basis.  (Pls.โ \nProposed Compel Ord. ยถ 5 & Ex. A).  The proposed period for sampling was 15 August to 1 \nNovember 2014 and 1 March to 1 July 2015, meaning sampling would occur over six and a half \nmonths during a period spanning ten and a half months.  (Id. ยถ 1).  The gap between 1 November \n2014 and 1 March 2015 apparently reflects a period during which swine waste effluent is not \nbeing sprayed on fields and groundwater sampling would not be as meaningful as it otherwise \nmight  be.    In  their  inspection  request,  plaintiffs  had  sought  a  sampling  period  of  similar \ndurationโsix  months,  running  from  17  February  to  8  August  2014โbut  with  sampling \noccurring on a weekly basis.  (Insp. Req. 1-2, 3 ยถ 8).  In negotiations with the Taylor defendants, \nplaintiffs proposed a sampling period of four and a half monthsโ15 June to 1 November 2014โ\nalso with weekly sampling.  (30 May 2014 Ltr. from Pls.โ Counsel (D.E. 95 at 47-50) 2).4   \n  The Taylor defendants oppose any groundwater sampling.  In a declaration by Mr. Taylor \nsupporting  the  Taylor  defendantsโ  response  to  plaintiffsโ  motion  to  compel,  he  details  the \nburdens and risks that would be imposed upon the Taylor Facility by installation of the requested \ngroundwater wells and the weekly sampling sought in the inspection request.  (2d Taylor Dec. \n(D.E. 99)).  According to the declaration, the Taylor Facility is operated by three peopleโMr. \n                                                 \n4 Plaintiffs submitted this letter and other correspondence among counsel from their negotiations over plaintiffsโ \ninspection request in support of the motion to compel.  (See D.E. 95 at 34-75).  The Taylor defendants did not object \nto submission of this evidence and themselves discuss the negotiations in their memorandum opposing the motion.  \nBoth sides have therefore waived any objection they might otherwise have had to evidence of their negotiations.    \n6 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 6 of 21\n\nTaylor, his son, and a laborer.  (Id. ยถ 10).  Mr. Taylor would have to monitor installation and \nsampling, thereby tying up for significant periods one-third of the labor force needed to operate \nthe facility; installation would increase the risk of exposure of the 9,000 animals at the facility to \nthe PED virus, which can kill entire herds, and likely agitate and disturb the animals; installation \nas well as operation and removal of the wells in the vicinity of three swine waste lagoons creates \na risk of damaging the lagoons, which are presently in a condition satisfactory to the North \nCarolina  regulatory  agencies  and  the  United  States  Environmental  Protection  Agency;  and \ninstallation would impede operation of equipment needed to maintain the lagoons.  (Id. ยถ 15).5 \n  Plaintiffs offered no expert or scientific evidence responsive to the concerns raised in the \nTaylor Declaration.  They do cite, in a footnote, to naked allegations in their second amended \ncomplaint  regarding  surface  water  sampling  from  areas  adjacent  to  the  Taylor  Facility, \nphotographs of the Taylor Facility, and two violation notices from state water quality officials.  \n(Pls.โ Compel Mot. Mem. (D.E. 94) 6 n.3); 2d Am. Compl. ยถยถ 53-58).  Many of the sampling \nresults and the two violation notices predate the Taylor defendantsโ taking ownership of the \nTaylor Facility on 23 November 2010.  (See 2d Am. Compl. ยถ 31; Taylor Defs.โ Ans. to 2d Am. \nCompl. ยถยถ 53-58).     \n  Plaintiffs also submitted a letter from their counsel to the Taylor defendantsโ counsel \ntransmitting various sampling results and photographs culled from discovery to support their \ninspection request.  (3 June 2014 Ltr. from Pls.โ Counsel (D.E. 95 at 56-71)).  As with the \n                                                 \n5 The Taylor defendants also challenged the groundwater sampling plaintiffs requested on legal groundsโthat is, \nthat groundwater contamination is not within the scope of plaintiffsโ claims.  The court need not resolve this issue \ngiven the impermissibility of the groundwater sampling for the reasons stated.   \n \n7 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 7 of 21\n\nallegations  from  the  second  amended  complaint,  there  is  no  explanation  of  this  evidence, \nincluding where the sampling occurred and how it supports plaintiffsโ inspection request.6   \n  The cases plaintiffs cite as precedent for the groundwater and other sampling they seek is \nreadily distinguishable.  None is binding precedent.7   \n  Based  on  the  record  before  it,  the  court  finds  that  the  Taylor  defendants  have \ndemonstrated that the installation, operation, and removal of the groundwater wells, even if \nsampling is done on a biweekly basis, presents burdens and risks that outweigh the potential \nbenefits  to  be  obtained  from  such  sampling.    Plaintiffsโ  request  to  install  and  operate \ngroundwater wells on the Taylor Facility will accordingly be denied. \n  2.  Surface Water Sampling.  Plaintiffs seek to take surface water samples at 15 \nlocations originally identified in their inspection request as well as from additional surface water \nconveyances they identify upon inspection, on a biweekly basis, as opposed to a weekly basis as \nsought in their inspection request.  (Pls.โ Proposed Compel Ord. ยถ 6 & Ex. B).  The length of the \nrequested period of samplingโsix and a half monthsโis the same as proposed for groundwater \nsampling in both the proposed order and inspection request, which, as indicated, plaintiffs agreed \nto reduce to four and a half months in negotiations.  (Id. ยถ 1; Insp. Req. 1-2, 3-4 ยถ 9; 30 May \n2014 Ltr. from Pls.โ Counsel (D.E. 95 at 47-50) 2).   \n                                                 \n6 According to the Smolen Declaration, plaintiffs had retained Dr. Smolen by the time they served their inspection \nrequest in January 2014.  (Smolen Decl. ยถยถ 7, 8).  It therefore appears that plaintiffs could readily have presented \nexpert evidence in support of their motion to compel, but chose not to do so.  The Smolen Declaration, filed 5 \nDecember 2014, is not properly considered in evaluation of plaintiffsโ motion to compel because, among other \nreasons, it was filed months after any supporting materials for that motion, filed in June 2014, were due.  Notably, \nplaintiffs cite to at least one case in support of their motion to compel in which the moving party did support its \ninspection request with expert evidence.  See United States v. Acquest Wehrle, LLC,  No. 09-CV-637C(F), 2010 WL \n1708528, at *1 (W.D.N.Y. 27 Apr. 2010). \n \n7 Notwithstanding plaintiffsโ characterization of the groundwater and other inspection activities they seek as routine, \none of the cases it cites describes the request for soil sampling there as โperhaps extraordinary.โ  Versatile Metals, \nInc. v. Union Corp., Civ. A. No. 85-4085, 1986 WL 8720, at *3 (E.D. Pa. 8 Aug. 1986). \n8 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 8 of 21\n\n  The Taylor defendants appear to agree to surface water sampling on two occasions, \nalthough the number of locations remains in dispute.  (See 3 June 2014 Ltr. from Taylor Defs.โ \nCounsel (D.E. 95 at 52-54) 2).  It is apparent from the Taylor Declaration that provision of \naccess  on  even  a  biweekly  basis  as  proposed  by  plaintiffs  in  their  motion  would  place  a \nsubstantial burden on the Taylor defendants. \n  The court concludes that sampling on four occasions over a period of three months would \nstrike an appropriate balance between plaintiffsโ need for the sampling and the burden such \nsampling places on the Taylor defendants.  This period also accounts for plaintiffsโ delay and the \nother considerations discussed below in connection with their request for extension of time.  \nAssuming, as the record suggests, that sampling could begin by March, the three months allowed \nfor it equates to extension of the fact discovery deadline and thereby the deadline for completion \nof this sampling to 31 May 2015.  The sampling needs to be done on dates reasonably agreed to \nby the Taylor defendants8 to properly address the burden the sampling will place on them.  To \navoid undue burden to the Taylor defendants, the number of locations at which sampling may \noccur shall be limited to 15, comprised of locations identified in Exhibit B to plaintiffsโ proposed \norder (D.E. 93-1 at 5) and/or other locations reasonably agreed to by the Taylor defendants.    \n  3.  Soil Sampling.  Plaintiffs seek to take soil samples on three fields on two separate \ndates selected by them.  (Pls.โ Proposed Compel Ord. ยถ 4).  On each field, three cores would be \ndrilled to a depth of 24 inches and 20 cores would be drilled to a depth of 6 inches.  (Id.).  In \ntheir inspection request, plaintiffs sought soil sampling on dates agreed to by the parties (Insp. \nReq. ยถ 11), but otherwise the terms of that request are the same as those proposed by plaintiffs in \ntheir motion. \n                                                 \n8 โReasonably agreed toโ signifies that agreement may not be unreasonably withheld. \n9 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 9 of 21\n\n  In their response to the motion, the Taylor defendants agreed to eight six-inch soil \nsamples on two occasions.  (See Taylor Defs.โ Compel Mot. Mem. (D.E. 97) 3).  Four samples \nwould be from locations identified in the inspection request and four from mutually acceptable \nlocations.  (Id.). \n  In accordance with plaintiffsโ and the Taylor defendantsโ apparent agreement, the court \nwill permit soil sampling on two occasions during the extended discovery period.  The soil \nsampling shall occur on dates reasonably agreed to by the Taylor defendants on which plaintiffs \nare conducting surface water sampling.   \n  An article from the North Carolina Department of Agriculture & Consumer Services \nentitled, โSoil sampling basics,โ submitted by plaintiffs, states that for agricultural samples 15 to \n20 cores should be taken from each area.  (โSoil sampling basicsโ (D.E. 95 at 77-78) 1 (N.C. \nDepโt of Agric. & Consumer Servs. Sept. 2013)).  In contrast, as noted, plaintiffs seek to take 23 \ncores per field.  The court will limit plaintiffs to 15 cores per field on the grounds that plaintiffsโ \nown evidence indicates this number is sufficient and the taking of additional cores would require \nadditional time, placing an unjustified burden on the Taylor defendantsโ labor force.  Although \nthe article specifies for agricultural land a maximum depth of six to eight inches (โSoil sampling \nbasicsโ 2), it is not apparent that samples of 24 inches would require more time or otherwise \nimpose an unnecessary burden on the Taylor defendants.  Accordingly, up to 3 of the core \nsamples from each field may be 24 inches in depth. \n  The Taylor defendants have not shown that sampling at any particular location would \nimpose a greater burden on them than any other location.  Plaintiffs will therefore be permitted to \nselect the locations in the three fields from which the soil samples are to be taken.   \n10 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 10 of 21\n\n  4.  Inspection, Measurement, and Photography.  In their proposed order, plaintiffs \nseek to inspect, measure, and photograph the Taylor Facility, the draining infrastructure, waste \nmanagement structures, and wastewater as follows:  (i) the Taylor Facility, including buildings, \noutdoor storage areas, equipment, waste land application areas, the perimeter of the property, the \nproperty line, and all fences; (ii) draining infrastructure, including, but not limited to, perennial \nstreams, intermittent steams, catch basins, pipes, gutters, tile drains, ditches, swales and/or other \nwater conveyances on or leading from the Taylor Facility; (iii) waste management structures, \nincluding  waste  lagoons;  and  (iv)  wastewater  in  lagoons,  sprayed  and/or  ponding  on  the \nproperty,  and  in  open  conveyances.    (Pls.โ  Proposed  Compel  Ord.  ยถ  3).    These  proposed \ninspection activities are somewhat less expansive than those sought in the inspection request.  \n(See Ins. Req. ยถ 2).  While the Taylor defendants objected to these activities in their response to \nplaintiffsโ inspection request, they did not address them specifically in their memorandum in \nresponse to plaintiffsโ motion to compel, and appeared to have agreed to them in negotiations.  \n(See, e.g., 23 May 2014 Ltr. from Taylor Defs.โ Counsel (D.E. 95 at 39-45) 6; 18 June 2014 \nEmail from Pls.โ Counsel (D.E. 95 at 73)). \n  The court finds that these inspection activities are relevant and would not impose an \nundue burden on the Taylor defendants, provided that they are conducted on one or more dates \nreasonably agreed to by the Taylor defendants on which plaintiffs are performing surface water \nsampling.    The  court  will  therefore  allow  the  inspection,  measurement,  and  photographic \nactivities on these terms.       \n  5.  Lagoon Sampling.  Plaintiffs and the Taylor defendants appear to have agreed and \nthe court will order that plaintiffs may take samples from each of the Taylor Facilityโs three \nlagoons on two separate occasions.  (See Pls.โ Proposed Compel Ord. ยถ 7; Taylor Defs.โ Compel \n11 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 11 of 21\n\nMot. Mem. 3).  The sampling shall be on dates reasonably agreed to by the Taylor defendants on \nwhich plaintiffs are performing surface water sampling to adequately address the burdens the \nsampling imposes on the Taylor defendants.  The samples may be of surface and bottom lagoon \nwaste, as sought by plaintiffs.  (Pls.โ Proposed Compel Ord. ยถ 7).     \n  6.  Sampling of Central Pivot Sprayer.  The parties appear to agree and the court will \norder that plaintiffs may on one occasion sample swine waste effluent from the central pivot \nsprayer as it is being applied to sprayfields.  (See, e.g., Pls.โ Proposed Compel Ord. ยถ 8; 3 June \n2014 Ltr. from Taylor Defs.โ Counsel 3).  This sampling shall occur on a date reasonably agreed \nto by the Taylor defendants on which plaintiffs are performing surface water sampling.     \n  7.  Biosecurity and Other Conditions on Inspection Activities.  Plaintiffs represent in \ntheir proposed order that the parties have reached agreement on biosecurity and other conditions \non  plaintiffsโ  inspection  activities.    (Pls.โ  Proposed  Compel  Ord.  ยถยถ  9-13).    The  Taylor \ndefendants do not contest that representation in their response memorandum.  The court will \naccordingly require that these conditions apply.  These conditions are as follows, except as \notherwise provided herein: \n    a.  Plaintiffs shall identify by name and position the specific contingent of people \nwho will be going on the Taylor Facility in order to conduct any inspection activities, and no \nperson about whom the Taylor defendants state a reasoned objection shall be permitted to enter \nthe property; \n    b.  Each water and soil sample taken by plaintiffs from the Taylor Facility during \nthe Sampling Period shall be divided into two portions, one of which may be tested by plaintiffs \nand the other of which will be provided to the Taylor defendants, both of which to be labeled \n12 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 12 of 21\n\nwith the date, time, and location where the sample of was taken and the identity of the individual \ntaking the sample. \n    c.  Plaintiffs shall enter an agreement with the Taylor defendants pursuant to \nwhich plaintiffs agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Taylor defendants from all loss \nincurred by the plaintiffs as a result of any action taken in connection with the Plaintiffsโ entry \non the Taylor Facility and the inspection activities. \n    d.  Plaintiffs and all people in plaintiffsโ contingent will follow and adhere to \nappropriate farm biosecurity and exclusion measures and guidelines recommended by the North \nCarolina Department of Agriculture & Consumer Services, Veterinary Division when at the \nTaylor Facility. \n  IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the portion of plaintiffsโ motion to  compel (D.E. \n93) seeking an order compelling inspection of the Taylor Facility is ALLOWED IN PART and \nDENIED IN PART on the foregoing terms.  The parties may agree to modifications in the terms \nof the various inspection activities authorized herein, provided that any such modifications shall \nbe subject to and shall not extend the deadline for completion of fact discovery.  The parties  \nshall confer expeditiously in good faith in an effort to resolve without court intervention any \ndisputes that arise regarding performance of the inspection activities provided for herein. \nII.  EXTENSION OF TIME \n  A.  Applicable Legal Standards \n  With exceptions not relevant here, Rule 16 requires that a district court enter a scheduling \norder setting deadlines for completion of discovery and addressing other scheduling matters.  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(1), (3).  โA schedule may be modified only for good cause . . . .โ  Fed. R. \nCiv.  P.  16(b)(4).    The  good  cause  modification  provision  specific  to  Rule  16(b)(4)  takes \n13 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 13 of 21\n\nprecedence over the generally applicable extension provisions of Rule 6(b)(1).  E.g., Dilmar Oil \nCo. v. Federated Mut. Ins. Co., 986 F. Supp. 959, 980 (D.S.C. 1997), affโd, 129 F.3d 116 (4th \nCir. 1997); Corkrey v. Internal Revenue Serv., 192 F.R.D. 66, 67 (N.D.N.Y. 2000).  The good \ncause provision of Rule 16(b)(4) does not focus on the prejudice to the non-movant or bad faith \nof the moving party, but rather on the moving partyโs diligence.  Dilmar Oil Co., 986 F. Supp. at \n980; see also Cook v. Howard, 484 Fed. Appx. 805, 815 (4th Cir. 2012) (โโGood causeโ requires \nโthe party seeking relief [to] show that the deadlines cannot reasonably be met despite the partyโs \ndiligence,โ and whatever other factors are also considered, โthe good-cause standard will not be \nsatisfied if the [district] court concludes that the party seeking relief (or that partyโs attorney) has \nnot acted diligently in compliance with the schedule.โโ) (quoting 6A Charles Alan Wright, et al., \nFed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. ยง 1522.2 (2010)); McDonald v. Marlboro County, 5:12CV1725-RBH-\nKDW, 2013 WL 6580631, at *4 (D.S.C. 16 Dec. 2013) (โ[T]he key to the โgood causeโ analysis \nof Rule 16 is whether the party was diligent in seeking to amend.โ); Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b), \nadvisory committeeโs noteโ1983 amendment (โ[T]he court may modify the schedule on a \nshowing of good cause if it cannot reasonably be met despite the diligence of the party seeking \nthe  extension.โ).    The  party  moving  to  modify  a  scheduling  order  bears  the  burden  of \ndemonstrating the existence of good cause.  United States v. Cochran, No. 4:12โCVโ220โFL, \n2014 WL 347426, at *2 (E.D.N.C. 30 Jan. 2014) (citing Nourison Rug Corp. v. Parvizian, 535 \nF.3d 295, 298 (4th Cir. 2008)).  โ[T]he scheduling order โis not a frivolous piece of paper, idly \nentered, which can be cavalierly disregarded by counsel without peril.โโ  Forstmann v. Culp, 114 \nF.R.D. 83, 85 (M.D.N.C. 1987) (quoting Gestetner Corp. v. Case Equipment Co., 108 F.R.D. \n138, 141 (D. Me. 1985)).  \n \n14 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 14 of 21\n\n  B.  Analysis \n  Plaintiffsโ pursuit of the inspection activities at the Taylor Facility has been characterized \nby delay.  Among the delay is their service of the request for inspection in January 2014, some \nthree months after commencement of discovery in October 2013, representing almost half of the \napproximately seven-month fact discovery period and one-quarter of the approximately eleven-\nmonth overall discovery period to which plaintiffs agreed in the Discovery Plan.  They then \nconsented to extension of the Taylor defendantsโ response to the request for inspection by \nanother two months, until mid-April 2014, a month and a half before the close of fact discovery \nand the approximate midpoint of the overall discovery period.  While plaintiffs complain that the \nlength of the extension the Taylor defendants sought was unreasonable (it equaled and was in \nreciprocation for the extension defendants allowed plaintiffs on their responses to plaintiffsโ \ndiscovery), the extension was effected only because plaintiffs agreed to it. \n  Plaintiffs then negotiated over their differences with the Taylor defendants regarding the \ninspection request for an additional two months before bringing their motion to compel in mid-\nJune 2014.  Plaintiffs thus filed their motion less than two weeks before expiration of the \nstipulated extended 1 July 2014 deadline for fact discovery (and after the 1 June 2014 deadline \nfor fact discovery to which they had agreed in the Discovery Plan and which the court had \nadopted).  The motion came with less than four months left in the overall discovery period.  \n  While both the Federal Civil Rules and Local Civil Rules require parties to attempt to \nresolve disputes among themselves without court intervention, they act at their peril if they \nnegotiate for such a period that they jeopardize their ability to comply with case deadlines.  Such \nnegotiations obviously do not suspend case deadlines.  \n15 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 15 of 21\n\n  Nor can it be said that the motion to compel suspended the stipulated fact discovery \ndeadline of 1 July 2014 or any subsequent deadlines established by the Scheduling Order.  See, \ne.g., Fitchett v. Wilson, 2013 WL 5468389, at *1 n.4 (D.S.C. 30 Sept. 2013), affโd, 561 Fed. \nAppx. 256 (4th Cir. 19 Mar. 2014).9  The Discovery Plan itself, as adopted by the court, provides \nthat โ[i]nterim deadlines for discovery shall be as follows, unless otherwise agreed to by the \nparties or ordered by the court.โ  (Disc. Plan ยถ 4.i) (emphasis added).  Thus, by agreement of \nplaintiffs, only a stipulation or order could modify the case deadlines, not a mere motion.10 \n  As indicated, in the course of the partiesโ negotiations, the Taylor defendants agreed to a \nrange of inspection activities plaintiffs sought.  (See, e.g., 23 May 2014 Ltr. from Taylor Defs.โ \nCounsel 5-6).  Plaintiffs, though, chose not to take advantage of the access that the Taylor \ndefendants offered them, opting instead to seek broader access through litigation.   \n  Given the timing of their motion, plaintiffs proposed an inspection period (including a \nfour-month hiatus from November 2014 through February 2015) of about ten and half months, \n50 percent longer than the original fact discovery period.  Only a fraction of the proposed \ninspection activities sought could be conducted during the ten days remaining in the extended \nfact discovery period after the motion was filed.  As to the overall discovery deadline, plaintiffs \nproposed to extend it a full year, to 2 October 2015.   \n                                                 \n9 The Fitchett court stated:   \n \nPlaintiffsโ assumption that the Court would grant their motion for a continuance (really, a motion \nto hold Defendantsโ motion in abeyance and to stay the deadline to respond pending further \ndiscovery)  on  the  day  the  response  was  due  was  imprudent,  and  Plaintiffs  must  bear  the \nconsequences of not complying with a deadline absent a court-ordered extension.  Indeed, the \nquestion of whether to extend procedural deadlines is one for the Courtโnot Plaintiffs.   \n \nFitchett, 2013 WL 5468389, at *1 n.4. \n \n10 Notably, plaintiffs did not ask the that the deadlines they sought to extend be suspended pending ruling on their \nmotion to compel, as they did with respect to their deadline for responding to defendantsโ summary judgment \nmotions pending ruling on their motion to compel.  (See Pls.โ Rule 56(d) Mot. ยถ 12). \n16 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 16 of 21\n\n  Plaintiffsโ delay, as serious as it was, does not dictate complete denial of their request for \nextension of time.  They did file their motion before the stipulated, extended deadline for fact \ndiscovery and they did try to resolve the disputes over their request for inspection without court \nintervention.  In addition, to deprive plaintiffs of any additional time to conduct inspection \nactivities would appear to impair their ability to prosecute their claims.  Federal policy, of \ncourse, favors resolution of cases on the merits.  See, e.g., Choice Hotels Intern., Inc. v. Goodwin \nand Boone, 11 F.3d 469, 471-72 (4th Cir. 1993); Rudisill v. United States, No. 5:13โCVโ110โF, \n2014 WL 2014 WL 1117976, at *2 (E.D.N.C. 20 Mar. 2014) (citing Laber v. Harvey, 438 F.3d \n404, 426 (4th Cir. 2006)).  Further, the permitted inspection activities themselves would not \nimpose any greater burden on the Taylor defendants during an extension of the fact discovery \nperiod than they would have during the prior period for fact discovery.  To the extent that \ndefendants would need to re-depose any persons as a result of the inspection activities allowed, \nthe prejudice can be ameliorated by requiring plaintiffs to bear any additional court reporter and \nvideographer fees defendants incur. \n  The court has already found that extension of the fact discovery deadline to 31 May 2015 \nwill adequately accommodate the permissible inspection activities by plaintiffs.  Extension to \nthis date will also adequately address plaintiffsโ lack of diligence with respect to inspection \nactivities and the inherent prejudice to defendants and burden on the court arising from further \ndelay in resolution of this case.  The post-fact discovery deadlines are appropriately extended \nusing as a guide the same intervals between deadlines as under the Scheduling Order. \n  IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the portion of plaintiffsโ motion to compel (D.E. \n93) seeking extension of the case schedule be ALLOWED IN PART and DENIED IN PART on \nthe following terms: \n17 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 17 of 21\n\n  1.  Any additional fact discovery, including the inspection activities provided for \nherein, shall be commenced in time to be completed by 31 May 2015. \n  2.  Reports from retained experts are due by 1 July 2015, and from rebuttal experts \nby 3 August 2015. \n  3.  All discovery shall be completed by 2 September 2015. \n  4.  Any further potentially dispositive motions shall be filed by 2 October 2015. \n  5.  Except as modified herein, the Scheduling Order, as previously amended, remains \nin full force and effect.        \n  6.  Plaintiffs shall bear the court reporter and videographer costs reasonably incurred \nby defendants for any depositions of persons whom defendants previously deposed that are \nprompted by inspection activities provided for herein.              \nDEFENDANTSโ MOTION TO STRIKE (D.E. 139) \n(Denied as Moot) \n  Rule 37(c)(1) addresses tardy disclosure of expert witnesses: \nIf a party fails to provide information or identify a witness as required by Rule 26 \n. . . (e), the party is not allowed to use that information or witness to supply \nevidence  on  a  motion,  at  a  hearing,  or  at  a  trial,  unless  the  failure  was \nsubstantially justified or is harmless.  In addition to or instead of this sanction, the \ncourt, on motion and after giving an opportunity to be heard: (A) may order \npayment of the reasonable expenses, including attorneyโs fees, caused by the \nfailure; (B) may inform the jury of the partyโs failure; and (C) may impose other \nappropriate sanctions . . . . \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1).  Defendants seek to strike the Smolen Declaration on the grounds that it \ncontains expert opinion; plaintiffs failed to disclose Smolen by the 8 August 2014 expert report \ndeadline; and Rule 37(c)(1) prohibits plaintiffs from using the Smollen Declaration in support of \nits Rule 56(d) motion. \n18 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 18 of 21\n\n  As discussed below, allowance of the inspection activities provided for herein dictates that \nfurther proceedings on summary judgment be deferred until after such activities are conducted, \nirrespective of the Smolen Declaration.  IT IS THEFORE ORDERED that defendantsโ motion to \nstrike (D.E. 139) is DENIED AS MOOT.    \nPLAINTIFFSโ RULE 56(d) MOTION (D.E. 143) \n(Recommended for Denial, but with Provision of Comparable Relief) \n  Rule 56(d) provides that where โa nonmovant shows by affidavit or declaration that, for \nspecified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition, the court may: (1) \ndefer considering the motion or deny it; (2) allow time to obtain affidavits or declarations or to \ntake discovery; or (3) issue any other appropriate order.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d). \n  In their Rule 56(d) motion, plaintiffs request, pursuant to that provision, the entry of an \norder denying without prejudice or deferring resolution of defendantsโ motions for summary \njudgment.  Alternatively, plaintiffs seek an order under Rule 6(b) extending the time to respond \nto the summary judgment motions.   \n  Basic fairness dictates that plaintiffs not be required to respond to defendantsโ motions \nfor summary judgment until after the additional discovery provided for herein is completed.  \nIndeed, such additional discovery could be feckless if plaintiffs were not able to exploit it in \ndefending against summary judgment motions by defendants.   \n  While plaintiffs base their motion on statements in the Smolen Declaration that the \ninspection activities sought in the inspection request are vital to their case, that is not the basis \nfor the courtโs determination.  Rather, as indicated, it is the courtโs partial allowance of plaintiffsโ \nmotion to compel that mandates deferral of summary judgment proceedings.  Thus, such deferral \nis not pursuant to Rule 56(d) or Rule 6(b), but rather Rule 16(b)(4), as part of modification of the \nschedule for proceedings in this case.      \n19 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 19 of 21\n\n  The deferral of summary judgment proceedings pending completion of the additional \ndiscovery is most efficiently effected by denying without prejudice the pending motions for \nsummary judgment.  In addition to preserving plaintiffsโ opportunity to utilize the additional \ndiscovery in summary judgment proceedings, such denial would enable defendants to tailor any \nfurther  summary  judgment  motions  they  may  assert  to  information  developed  through  the \nadditional discovery, rather than attempting to address it by supplementation of their current \nsummary judgment filings.   \n  IT IS THEREFORE RECOMMENDED that plaintiffsโ Rule 56(d) motion (D.E. 143) be \nDENIED,  but  that  the  pending  motions  for  summary  judgment  be  DENIED  WITHOUT \nPREJUDICE, pursuant to Rule 16.    \nCONCLUSION \n  In sum, IT IS ORDERED that plaintiffsโ motion to compel (D.E. 93) is ALLOWED IN \nPART AND DENIED IN PART on the terms set out above and that defendantsโ motion to strike \n(D.E. 139) is DENIED AS MOOT;  \n  IT IS RECOMMENDED that plaintiffsโ motion for relief pursuant to Rule 56(d) (D.E. \n143) be denied, but that the pending motions for summary judgment  be DENIED without \nprejudice pursuant to Rule 16; and \n  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Clerk send copies of this Order and Memorandum \nand Recommendation to counsel for the respective parties, who shall have until 27 January 2015 \nto file written objections to the Memorandum and Recommendation herein on plaintiffsโ motion \nRule 56(d) motion.  Failure to file timely written objections bars an aggrieved party from \nreceiving a de novo review by the District Judge on an issue covered in the Memorandum and \nRecommendation  and,  except  upon  grounds  of  plain  error,  from  attacking  on  appeal  the \n20 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 20 of 21\n\nunobjected-to proposed factual findings and legal conclusions accepted by the District Judge.  \nAny response to objections shall be filed within 14 days after service of the objections on the \nresponding party.   \n      SO ORDERED, this the 13th day of January 2015.   \n \n     \n \n              _________________________ \n              James E.

P. 56(d) or, alternatively, for extension of the time to respond to \ndefendantsโ motions for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 6(b) (โRule 56(d) motionโ).  Also \nbefore the court is a motion (D.E. 143) by defendants Donald Taylor (โMr. Taylorโ) and Annie \nTaylor,  individually  and  d/b/a  Taylor  Finishing  (collectively  โTaylor  defendantsโ),  and \nMcLawhorn Livestock Farm, Inc., Justin T. McLawhorn, and Aaron McLawhorn (collectively \nโMcLawhorn defendantsโ) (all defendants collectively โdefendantsโ).  Defendantsโ motion seeks \nto strike the declaration of a purported expert (D.E. 139-1) submitted by plaintiffs in support of \ntheir Rule 56(d) motion.  All three motions were referred to the undersigned.  For the reasons \n                                                 \n1 Now-dismissed plaintiff North Carolina Environmental Justice Network was also a party to this motion. \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 1 of 21\n\nstated below, plaintiffsโ motion to compel will be allowed in part and denied in part; defendantsโ \nmotion to strike will be denied as moot; and it will be recommended that plaintiffsโ Rule 56(d) \nmotion be denied, but that comparable relief be provided under Rule 16.    \nBACKGROUND \nI.  PLAINTIFFSโ CLAIMS   \n  Plaintiffs, along with the North Carolina Environmental Justice Network (โNetworkโ), \ncommenced this federal citizens environmental action on 27 July 2012.  (See Compl. (D.E.  1)).  \nWith leave of court, they filed their second amended complaint (D.E. 65)โthe most current \nversionโon 25 April 2013.  The claims against the Network were dismissed with prejudice by \nstipulation on 21 October 2014 (D.E. 110). \n  The property which is the subject of the second amended complaint (โTaylor Facilityโ) is \na hog-processing farm in Jones County presently owned by the Taylor defendants and previously \nowned  by  the  McLawhorn  defendants.    (2d  Am.  Compl.  ยถยถ  28-31).    Plaintiffs  allege  that \ndefendantsโ illegal management, discharge, and disposal of swine waste has resulted in the \nrelease of pollutants onto the land and waters in the Neuse River Basin area of the coastal plain \nof North Carolina.  (Id., e.g., ยถ 1).  Plaintiffs assert claims for violations of: (1) section 505 of the \nClean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. ยง 1365, by continuing to discharge pollutants without a permit (2d \nAm. Compl. ยถยถ 58-70); (2) section 7002(a)(1)(A) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery \nAct (โRCRAโ), 42 U.S.C. ยง 6972(a)(1)(A), by allowing open dumping (2d Am. Compl. ยถยถ 71-\n84); and (3) section 7002(a)(1)(B) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. ยง 6972(a)(1)(B), by posing an imminent \nand substantial endangerment to health or the environment (2d Am. Compl. ยถยถ 85-97).  As relief, \nplaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, civil penalties, costs, and other relief.  \n2 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 2 of 21\n\n(Id.  ยถยถ  98-111).    Defendants  deny  the  material  allegations  in  plaintiffsโ  second  amended \ncomplaint.  (See generally Ans. to 2d Am. Compl. (D.E. 68, 75)).   \nII.  RELEVANT CASE HISTORY   \n  The court entered a Scheduling Order (D.E. 81) on 19 November 2013, adopting the \npartiesโ Discovery Plan (D.E. 78) with minor modifications of certain proposed deadlines.  The \nScheduling Order provided for:  the commencement of discovery on 29 October 2013 (Sch. Ord. \n1; Disc. Plan ยถยถ 3, 4.d); completion of fact discovery by 1 June 2014 (Sch. Ord. 1; Disc. Plan ยถ \n4.i); disclosure of expert reports by 8 August 2014 (Sch. Ord. ยถ 1); completion of all discovery \nby 3 October 2014 (id. ยถ 2); and filing of potentially dispositive motions by 7 November 2014 \n(id. ยถ 3).  Plaintiffs served on the Taylor defendants a request for inspection of the Taylor \nFacility on 22 January 2014 (D.E. 95 at 5-13).  By agreement of plaintiffs, the Taylor defendants \ndid not serve their response (D.E. 95 at 15-32) to the inspection request until 16 April 2014, \nbroadly objecting to it.  Over the ensuing two months, plaintiffs attempted to resolve their \ndisputes  with  the  Taylor  defendants  regarding  the  inspection  request.    Some,  but  not  all, \ndifferences were resolved.  On 20 June 2014, plaintiffs filed the instant motion to compel.  Prior \nto the filing, the Taylor defendants agreed to extension of the fact discovery deadline to 1 July \n2014.  (See 13 June 2014 Email from Taylor Defs.โ Counsel (D.E. 95 at 74)). \n  In their motion, plaintiffs sought access to the Taylor Facility for a total of about six and \na half months between 15 August 2014 and 1 July 2015 to take photographs, obtain samples, and \nperform other inspection activities.  (See Pls.โ Proposed Compel Ord. (D.E. 93-1) ยถยถ 1, 3-8).  \nPlaintiffsโ motion also sought extension of, among other deadlines, those for expert reports and \nthe completion of discovery to 7 August 2015 and 2 October 2015, respectively.  (Id. ยถ 2). \n3 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 3 of 21\n\n  Plaintiffs did not produce any expert reports by the 8 August 2014 deadline established in \nthe Scheduling Order or thereafter.  However, on 3 November 2014, they emailed to defendantsโ \ncounsel supplemental initial disclosures identifying at least five expert witnesses.  (See Defs.โ \nStrike Mot. Mem. (D.E. 144) 5; 3 Nov. 2014 Email from Pls.โ Counsel (D.E. 144-1 at 2)).2 \n  On  23  October  2014,  on  defendantsโ  motion,  the  court  extended  the  deadline  for \ndefendantsโ potentially dispositive motions to 21 November 2014.3  (See D.E. 114).  On 21 \nNovember 2014, defendants filed three separate motions for summary judgment.  (See D.E. 125-\n137).  Plaintiffs filed their motion for relief under Rule 56(d) on 5 December 2014. \n  In support of their Rule 56(d) motion, plaintiffs filed a declaration of Michael D. Smolen, \nPh.D. (D.E. 139-1), a purported expert in the environmental matters at issue.  On 10 December \n2014, defendants filed their motion to strike the Smolen Declaration.  \n  The court held a telephone conference with counsel on the motions on 11 December \n2014.  After the telephone conference, the court entered an order (D.E. 146) staying the deadline \nfor plaintiffs to respond to defendantsโ summary judgment motions pending further order of the \ncourt.    \nPLAINTIFFSโ MOTION TO COMPEL (D.E. 93) \n(Allowed in Part and Denied in Part) \nI.  INSPECTION \n  A.  Applicable Legal Standards  \n  The Federal Civil Rules enable parties to obtain information by serving requests for \ndiscovery on each other, including requests to permit entry on land to โinspect, measure, survey, \nphotograph, test, or sample the property or any designated object or operation on it.โ  Fed. R. \n                                                 \n2 The supplemental initial disclosures do not appear to have been filed with the court. \n \n3 Plaintiffs seek reconsideration of the extension order.  (See D.E. 119). \n4 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 4 of 21\n\nCiv. P. 34(a)(2); see generally Fed. R. Civ. P. 26-37.  Rule 26(b) provides for a broad scope of \ndiscovery: \nParties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant \nto any partyโs claim or defense . . . .  For good cause, the court may order \ndiscovery of any matter relevant to the subject matter involved in the action.  \nRelevant information need not be admissible at the trial if the discovery appears \nreasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.   \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1).    \n \n  At the same time, Rule 26(c) authorizes the court โfor good cause, [to] issue an order to \nprotect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or \nexpense.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c)(1).  The Fourth Circuit has held that, pursuant to this provision, \nโthe degree to which [a] proposed inspection will aid in the search for truth must be balanced \nagainst the burdens and dangers created by the inspection.โ  Belcher v. Bassett Furniture Indus., \nInc., 588 F.2d 904, 908 (4th Cir. 1978); see also Clay v. Consol Penn. Coal Co., LLC, 5:12-cv-\n92, 2013 WL 3819922, at *4 (N.D.W. Va. 12 June 2013) (โAny dangers must be balanced \nagainst the relevance and need for the inspection.โ); Johnson v. Mundy Indus. Contractors, Inc., \n7:01CV99โBO3, 2002 WL 31464984, at *2 (E.D.N.C. 15 Mar. 2002) (โ[A]n inquiry into when \nto compel an inspection goes beyond mere โrelevanceโ and must balance the need presented by \nthe moving party against the โburdens and dangers created by the inspection.โโ (quoting Belcher, \n588 F.2d at 908)).  The need for such balancing is rooted in the reality that โentry upon a party's \npremises may entail greater burdens and risks than mere production of documents,โ as to which \nthe general relevance standard of Rule 26(b) routinely controls.  Belcher, 588 F.2d at 908.  Thus, \nthe court must exercise โprecision and care in the formulation of inspection orders.โ  Id. at 911.  \nIt has been held that the burden rests on the objecting party to convince the court that the \n5 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 5 of 21\n\ninspection requested is unnecessary.  See Arkansas Game & Fish Commโn v. United States, 74 \nFed. Cl. 426, 432 (16 Nov. 2006) (citing 8A Fed. Prac. & Proced. Civ. ยง 2214).  \n  B.  Analysis \n  1.  Groundwater Sampling.  As set out in their proposed order, plaintiffs seek to \ninstall nine sampling wells on the Taylor Facility at locations originally identified in their request \nfor inspection and to take groundwater samples from the wells on a biweekly basis.  (Pls.โ \nProposed Compel Ord. ยถ 5 & Ex. A).  The proposed period for sampling was 15 August to 1 \nNovember 2014 and 1 March to 1 July 2015, meaning sampling would occur over six and a half \nmonths during a period spanning ten and a half months.  (Id. ยถ 1).  The gap between 1 November \n2014 and 1 March 2015 apparently reflects a period during which swine waste effluent is not \nbeing sprayed on fields and groundwater sampling would not be as meaningful as it otherwise \nmight  be.    In  their  inspection  request,  plaintiffs  had  sought  a  sampling  period  of  similar \ndurationโsix  months,  running  from  17  February  to  8  August  2014โbut  with  sampling \noccurring on a weekly basis.  (Insp. Req. 1-2, 3 ยถ 8).  In negotiations with the Taylor defendants, \nplaintiffs proposed a sampling period of four and a half monthsโ15 June to 1 November 2014โ\nalso with weekly sampling.  (30 May 2014 Ltr. from Pls.โ Counsel (D.E. 95 at 47-50) 2).4   \n  The Taylor defendants oppose any groundwater sampling.  In a declaration by Mr. Taylor \nsupporting  the  Taylor  defendantsโ  response  to  plaintiffsโ  motion  to  compel,  he  details  the \nburdens and risks that would be imposed upon the Taylor Facility by installation of the requested \ngroundwater wells and the weekly sampling sought in the inspection request.  (2d Taylor Dec. \n(D.E. 99)).  According to the declaration, the Taylor Facility is operated by three peopleโMr. \n                                                 \n4 Plaintiffs submitted this letter and other correspondence among counsel from their negotiations over plaintiffsโ \ninspection request in support of the motion to compel.  (See D.E. 95 at 34-75).  The Taylor defendants did not object \nto submission of this evidence and themselves discuss the negotiations in their memorandum opposing the motion.  \nBoth sides have therefore waived any objection they might otherwise have had to evidence of their negotiations.    \n6 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 6 of 21\n\nTaylor, his son, and a laborer.  (Id. ยถ 10).  Mr. Taylor would have to monitor installation and \nsampling, thereby tying up for significant periods one-third of the labor force needed to operate \nthe facility; installation would increase the risk of exposure of the 9,000 animals at the facility to \nthe PED virus, which can kill entire herds, and likely agitate and disturb the animals; installation \nas well as operation and removal of the wells in the vicinity of three swine waste lagoons creates \na risk of damaging the lagoons, which are presently in a condition satisfactory to the North \nCarolina  regulatory  agencies  and  the  United  States  Environmental  Protection  Agency;  and \ninstallation would impede operation of equipment needed to maintain the lagoons.  (Id. ยถ 15).5 \n  Plaintiffs offered no expert or scientific evidence responsive to the concerns raised in the \nTaylor Declaration.  They do cite, in a footnote, to naked allegations in their second amended \ncomplaint  regarding  surface  water  sampling  from  areas  adjacent  to  the  Taylor  Facility, \nphotographs of the Taylor Facility, and two violation notices from state water quality officials.  \n(Pls.โ Compel Mot. Mem. (D.E. 94) 6 n.3); 2d Am. Compl. ยถยถ 53-58).  Many of the sampling \nresults and the two violation notices predate the Taylor defendantsโ taking ownership of the \nTaylor Facility on 23 November 2010.  (See 2d Am. Compl. ยถ 31; Taylor Defs.โ Ans. to 2d Am. \nCompl. ยถยถ 53-58).     \n  Plaintiffs also submitted a letter from their counsel to the Taylor defendantsโ counsel \ntransmitting various sampling results and photographs culled from discovery to support their \ninspection request.  (3 June 2014 Ltr. from Pls.โ Counsel (D.E. 95 at 56-71)).  As with the \n                                                 \n5 The Taylor defendants also challenged the groundwater sampling plaintiffs requested on legal groundsโthat is, \nthat groundwater contamination is not within the scope of plaintiffsโ claims.  The court need not resolve this issue \ngiven the impermissibility of the groundwater sampling for the reasons stated.   \n \n7 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 7 of 21\n\nallegations  from  the  second  amended  complaint,  there  is  no  explanation  of  this  evidence, \nincluding where the sampling occurred and how it supports plaintiffsโ inspection request.6   \n  The cases plaintiffs cite as precedent for the groundwater and other sampling they seek is \nreadily distinguishable.  None is binding precedent.7   \n  Based  on  the  record  before  it,  the  court  finds  that  the  Taylor  defendants  have \ndemonstrated that the installation, operation, and removal of the groundwater wells, even if \nsampling is done on a biweekly basis, presents burdens and risks that outweigh the potential \nbenefits  to  be  obtained  from  such  sampling.    Plaintiffsโ  request  to  install  and  operate \ngroundwater wells on the Taylor Facility will accordingly be denied. \n  2.  Surface Water Sampling.  Plaintiffs seek to take surface water samples at 15 \nlocations originally identified in their inspection request as well as from additional surface water \nconveyances they identify upon inspection, on a biweekly basis, as opposed to a weekly basis as \nsought in their inspection request.  (Pls.โ Proposed Compel Ord. ยถ 6 & Ex. B).  The length of the \nrequested period of samplingโsix and a half monthsโis the same as proposed for groundwater \nsampling in both the proposed order and inspection request, which, as indicated, plaintiffs agreed \nto reduce to four and a half months in negotiations.  (Id. ยถ 1; Insp. Req. 1-2, 3-4 ยถ 9; 30 May \n2014 Ltr. from Pls.โ Counsel (D.E. 95 at 47-50) 2).   \n                                                 \n6 According to the Smolen Declaration, plaintiffs had retained Dr. Smolen by the time they served their inspection \nrequest in January 2014.  (Smolen Decl. ยถยถ 7, 8).  It therefore appears that plaintiffs could readily have presented \nexpert evidence in support of their motion to compel, but chose not to do so.  The Smolen Declaration, filed 5 \nDecember 2014, is not properly considered in evaluation of plaintiffsโ motion to compel because, among other \nreasons, it was filed months after any supporting materials for that motion, filed in June 2014, were due.  Notably, \nplaintiffs cite to at least one case in support of their motion to compel in which the moving party did support its \ninspection request with expert evidence.  See United States v. Acquest Wehrle, LLC,  No. 09-CV-637C(F), 2010 WL \n1708528, at *1 (W.D.N.Y. 27 Apr. 2010). \n \n7 Notwithstanding plaintiffsโ characterization of the groundwater and other inspection activities they seek as routine, \none of the cases it cites describes the request for soil sampling there as โperhaps extraordinary.โ  Versatile Metals, \nInc. v. Union Corp., Civ. A. No. 85-4085, 1986 WL 8720, at *3 (E.D. Pa. 8 Aug. 1986). \n8 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 8 of 21\n\n  The Taylor defendants appear to agree to surface water sampling on two occasions, \nalthough the number of locations remains in dispute.  (See 3 June 2014 Ltr. from Taylor Defs.โ \nCounsel (D.E. 95 at 52-54) 2).  It is apparent from the Taylor Declaration that provision of \naccess  on  even  a  biweekly  basis  as  proposed  by  plaintiffs  in  their  motion  would  place  a \nsubstantial burden on the Taylor defendants. \n  The court concludes that sampling on four occasions over a period of three months would \nstrike an appropriate balance between plaintiffsโ need for the sampling and the burden such \nsampling places on the Taylor defendants.  This period also accounts for plaintiffsโ delay and the \nother considerations discussed below in connection with their request for extension of time.  \nAssuming, as the record suggests, that sampling could begin by March, the three months allowed \nfor it equates to extension of the fact discovery deadline and thereby the deadline for completion \nof this sampling to 31 May 2015.  The sampling needs to be done on dates reasonably agreed to \nby the Taylor defendants8 to properly address the burden the sampling will place on them.  To \navoid undue burden to the Taylor defendants, the number of locations at which sampling may \noccur shall be limited to 15, comprised of locations identified in Exhibit B to plaintiffsโ proposed \norder (D.E. 93-1 at 5) and/or other locations reasonably agreed to by the Taylor defendants.    \n  3.  Soil Sampling.  Plaintiffs seek to take soil samples on three fields on two separate \ndates selected by them.  (Pls.โ Proposed Compel Ord. ยถ 4).  On each field, three cores would be \ndrilled to a depth of 24 inches and 20 cores would be drilled to a depth of 6 inches.  (Id.).  In \ntheir inspection request, plaintiffs sought soil sampling on dates agreed to by the parties (Insp. \nReq. ยถ 11), but otherwise the terms of that request are the same as those proposed by plaintiffs in \ntheir motion. \n                                                 \n8 โReasonably agreed toโ signifies that agreement may not be unreasonably withheld. \n9 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 9 of 21\n\n  In their response to the motion, the Taylor defendants agreed to eight six-inch soil \nsamples on two occasions.  (See Taylor Defs.โ Compel Mot. Mem. (D.E. 97) 3).  Four samples \nwould be from locations identified in the inspection request and four from mutually acceptable \nlocations.  (Id.). \n  In accordance with plaintiffsโ and the Taylor defendantsโ apparent agreement, the court \nwill permit soil sampling on two occasions during the extended discovery period.  The soil \nsampling shall occur on dates reasonably agreed to by the Taylor defendants on which plaintiffs \nare conducting surface water sampling.   \n  An article from the North Carolina Department of Agriculture & Consumer Services \nentitled, โSoil sampling basics,โ submitted by plaintiffs, states that for agricultural samples 15 to \n20 cores should be taken from each area.  (โSoil sampling basicsโ (D.E. 95 at 77-78) 1 (N.C. \nDepโt of Agric. & Consumer Servs. Sept. 2013)).  In contrast, as noted, plaintiffs seek to take 23 \ncores per field.  The court will limit plaintiffs to 15 cores per field on the grounds that plaintiffsโ \nown evidence indicates this number is sufficient and the taking of additional cores would require \nadditional time, placing an unjustified burden on the Taylor defendantsโ labor force.  Although \nthe article specifies for agricultural land a maximum depth of six to eight inches (โSoil sampling \nbasicsโ 2), it is not apparent that samples of 24 inches would require more time or otherwise \nimpose an unnecessary burden on the Taylor defendants.  Accordingly, up to 3 of the core \nsamples from each field may be 24 inches in depth. \n  The Taylor defendants have not shown that sampling at any particular location would \nimpose a greater burden on them than any other location.  Plaintiffs will therefore be permitted to \nselect the locations in the three fields from which the soil samples are to be taken.   \n10 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 10 of 21\n\n  4.  Inspection, Measurement, and Photography.  In their proposed order, plaintiffs \nseek to inspect, measure, and photograph the Taylor Facility, the draining infrastructure, waste \nmanagement structures, and wastewater as follows:  (i) the Taylor Facility, including buildings, \noutdoor storage areas, equipment, waste land application areas, the perimeter of the property, the \nproperty line, and all fences; (ii) draining infrastructure, including, but not limited to, perennial \nstreams, intermittent steams, catch basins, pipes, gutters, tile drains, ditches, swales and/or other \nwater conveyances on or leading from the Taylor Facility; (iii) waste management structures, \nincluding  waste  lagoons;  and  (iv)  wastewater  in  lagoons,  sprayed  and/or  ponding  on  the \nproperty,  and  in  open  conveyances.    (Pls.โ  Proposed  Compel  Ord.  ยถ  3).    These  proposed \ninspection activities are somewhat less expansive than those sought in the inspection request.  \n(See Ins. Req. ยถ 2).  While the Taylor defendants objected to these activities in their response to \nplaintiffsโ inspection request, they did not address them specifically in their memorandum in \nresponse to plaintiffsโ motion to compel, and appeared to have agreed to them in negotiations.  \n(See, e.g., 23 May 2014 Ltr. from Taylor Defs.โ Counsel (D.E. 95 at 39-45) 6; 18 June 2014 \nEmail from Pls.โ Counsel (D.E. 95 at 73)). \n  The court finds that these inspection activities are relevant and would not impose an \nundue burden on the Taylor defendants, provided that they are conducted on one or more dates \nreasonably agreed to by the Taylor defendants on which plaintiffs are performing surface water \nsampling.    The  court  will  therefore  allow  the  inspection,  measurement,  and  photographic \nactivities on these terms.       \n  5.  Lagoon Sampling.  Plaintiffs and the Taylor defendants appear to have agreed and \nthe court will order that plaintiffs may take samples from each of the Taylor Facilityโs three \nlagoons on two separate occasions.  (See Pls.โ Proposed Compel Ord. ยถ 7; Taylor Defs.โ Compel \n11 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 11 of 21\n\nMot. Mem. 3).  The sampling shall be on dates reasonably agreed to by the Taylor defendants on \nwhich plaintiffs are performing surface water sampling to adequately address the burdens the \nsampling imposes on the Taylor defendants.  The samples may be of surface and bottom lagoon \nwaste, as sought by plaintiffs.  (Pls.โ Proposed Compel Ord. ยถ 7).     \n  6.  Sampling of Central Pivot Sprayer.  The parties appear to agree and the court will \norder that plaintiffs may on one occasion sample swine waste effluent from the central pivot \nsprayer as it is being applied to sprayfields.  (See, e.g., Pls.โ Proposed Compel Ord. ยถ 8; 3 June \n2014 Ltr. from Taylor Defs.โ Counsel 3).  This sampling shall occur on a date reasonably agreed \nto by the Taylor defendants on which plaintiffs are performing surface water sampling.     \n  7.  Biosecurity and Other Conditions on Inspection Activities.  Plaintiffs represent in \ntheir proposed order that the parties have reached agreement on biosecurity and other conditions \non  plaintiffsโ  inspection  activities.    (Pls.โ  Proposed  Compel  Ord.  ยถยถ  9-13).    The  Taylor \ndefendants do not contest that representation in their response memorandum.  The court will \naccordingly require that these conditions apply.  These conditions are as follows, except as \notherwise provided herein: \n    a.  Plaintiffs shall identify by name and position the specific contingent of people \nwho will be going on the Taylor Facility in order to conduct any inspection activities, and no \nperson about whom the Taylor defendants state a reasoned objection shall be permitted to enter \nthe property; \n    b.  Each water and soil sample taken by plaintiffs from the Taylor Facility during \nthe Sampling Period shall be divided into two portions, one of which may be tested by plaintiffs \nand the other of which will be provided to the Taylor defendants, both of which to be labeled \n12 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 12 of 21\n\nwith the date, time, and location where the sample of was taken and the identity of the individual \ntaking the sample. \n    c.  Plaintiffs shall enter an agreement with the Taylor defendants pursuant to \nwhich plaintiffs agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Taylor defendants from all loss \nincurred by the plaintiffs as a result of any action taken in connection with the Plaintiffsโ entry \non the Taylor Facility and the inspection activities. \n    d.  Plaintiffs and all people in plaintiffsโ contingent will follow and adhere to \nappropriate farm biosecurity and exclusion measures and guidelines recommended by the North \nCarolina Department of Agriculture & Consumer Services, Veterinary Division when at the \nTaylor Facility. \n  IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the portion of plaintiffsโ motion to  compel (D.E. \n93) seeking an order compelling inspection of the Taylor Facility is ALLOWED IN PART and \nDENIED IN PART on the foregoing terms.  The parties may agree to modifications in the terms \nof the various inspection activities authorized herein, provided that any such modifications shall \nbe subject to and shall not extend the deadline for completion of fact discovery.  The parties  \nshall confer expeditiously in good faith in an effort to resolve without court intervention any \ndisputes that arise regarding performance of the inspection activities provided for herein. \nII.  EXTENSION OF TIME \n  A.  Applicable Legal Standards \n  With exceptions not relevant here, Rule 16 requires that a district court enter a scheduling \norder setting deadlines for completion of discovery and addressing other scheduling matters.  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(1), (3).  โA schedule may be modified only for good cause . . . .โ  Fed. R. \nCiv.  P.  16(b)(4).    The  good  cause  modification  provision  specific  to  Rule  16(b)(4)  takes \n13 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 13 of 21\n\nprecedence over the generally applicable extension provisions of Rule 6(b)(1).  E.g., Dilmar Oil \nCo. v. Federated Mut. Ins. Co., 986 F. Supp. 959, 980 (D.S.C. 1997), affโd, 129 F.3d 116 (4th \nCir. 1997); Corkrey v. Internal Revenue Serv., 192 F.R.D. 66, 67 (N.D.N.Y. 2000).  The good \ncause provision of Rule 16(b)(4) does not focus on the prejudice to the non-movant or bad faith \nof the moving party, but rather on the moving partyโs diligence.  Dilmar Oil Co., 986 F. Supp. at \n980; see also Cook v. Howard, 484 Fed. Appx. 805, 815 (4th Cir. 2012) (โโGood causeโ requires \nโthe party seeking relief [to] show that the deadlines cannot reasonably be met despite the partyโs \ndiligence,โ and whatever other factors are also considered, โthe good-cause standard will not be \nsatisfied if the [district] court concludes that the party seeking relief (or that partyโs attorney) has \nnot acted diligently in compliance with the schedule.โโ) (quoting 6A Charles Alan Wright, et al., \nFed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. ยง 1522.2 (2010)); McDonald v. Marlboro County, 5:12CV1725-RBH-\nKDW, 2013 WL 6580631, at *4 (D.S.C. 16 Dec. 2013) (โ[T]he key to the โgood causeโ analysis \nof Rule 16 is whether the party was diligent in seeking to amend.โ); Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b), \nadvisory committeeโs noteโ1983 amendment (โ[T]he court may modify the schedule on a \nshowing of good cause if it cannot reasonably be met despite the diligence of the party seeking \nthe  extension.โ).    The  party  moving  to  modify  a  scheduling  order  bears  the  burden  of \ndemonstrating the existence of good cause.  United States v. Cochran, No. 4:12โCVโ220โFL, \n2014 WL 347426, at *2 (E.D.N.C. 30 Jan. 2014) (citing Nourison Rug Corp. v. Parvizian, 535 \nF.3d 295, 298 (4th Cir. 2008)).  โ[T]he scheduling order โis not a frivolous piece of paper, idly \nentered, which can be cavalierly disregarded by counsel without peril.โโ  Forstmann v. Culp, 114 \nF.R.D. 83, 85 (M.D.N.C. 1987) (quoting Gestetner Corp. v. Case Equipment Co., 108 F.R.D. \n138, 141 (D. Me. 1985)).  \n \n14 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 14 of 21\n\n  B.  Analysis \n  Plaintiffsโ pursuit of the inspection activities at the Taylor Facility has been characterized \nby delay.  Among the delay is their service of the request for inspection in January 2014, some \nthree months after commencement of discovery in October 2013, representing almost half of the \napproximately seven-month fact discovery period and one-quarter of the approximately eleven-\nmonth overall discovery period to which plaintiffs agreed in the Discovery Plan.  They then \nconsented to extension of the Taylor defendantsโ response to the request for inspection by \nanother two months, until mid-April 2014, a month and a half before the close of fact discovery \nand the approximate midpoint of the overall discovery period.  While plaintiffs complain that the \nlength of the extension the Taylor defendants sought was unreasonable (it equaled and was in \nreciprocation for the extension defendants allowed plaintiffs on their responses to plaintiffsโ \ndiscovery), the extension was effected only because plaintiffs agreed to it. \n  Plaintiffs then negotiated over their differences with the Taylor defendants regarding the \ninspection request for an additional two months before bringing their motion to compel in mid-\nJune 2014.  Plaintiffs thus filed their motion less than two weeks before expiration of the \nstipulated extended 1 July 2014 deadline for fact discovery (and after the 1 June 2014 deadline \nfor fact discovery to which they had agreed in the Discovery Plan and which the court had \nadopted).  The motion came with less than four months left in the overall discovery period.  \n  While both the Federal Civil Rules and Local Civil Rules require parties to attempt to \nresolve disputes among themselves without court intervention, they act at their peril if they \nnegotiate for such a period that they jeopardize their ability to comply with case deadlines.  Such \nnegotiations obviously do not suspend case deadlines.  \n15 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 15 of 21\n\n  Nor can it be said that the motion to compel suspended the stipulated fact discovery \ndeadline of 1 July 2014 or any subsequent deadlines established by the Scheduling Order.  See, \ne.g., Fitchett v. Wilson, 2013 WL 5468389, at *1 n.4 (D.S.C. 30 Sept. 2013), affโd, 561 Fed. \nAppx. 256 (4th Cir. 19 Mar. 2014).9  The Discovery Plan itself, as adopted by the court, provides \nthat โ[i]nterim deadlines for discovery shall be as follows, unless otherwise agreed to by the \nparties or ordered by the court.โ  (Disc. Plan ยถ 4.i) (emphasis added).  Thus, by agreement of \nplaintiffs, only a stipulation or order could modify the case deadlines, not a mere motion.10 \n  As indicated, in the course of the partiesโ negotiations, the Taylor defendants agreed to a \nrange of inspection activities plaintiffs sought.  (See, e.g., 23 May 2014 Ltr. from Taylor Defs.โ \nCounsel 5-6).  Plaintiffs, though, chose not to take advantage of the access that the Taylor \ndefendants offered them, opting instead to seek broader access through litigation.   \n  Given the timing of their motion, plaintiffs proposed an inspection period (including a \nfour-month hiatus from November 2014 through February 2015) of about ten and half months, \n50 percent longer than the original fact discovery period.  Only a fraction of the proposed \ninspection activities sought could be conducted during the ten days remaining in the extended \nfact discovery period after the motion was filed.  As to the overall discovery deadline, plaintiffs \nproposed to extend it a full year, to 2 October 2015.   \n                                                 \n9 The Fitchett court stated:   \n \nPlaintiffsโ assumption that the Court would grant their motion for a continuance (really, a motion \nto hold Defendantsโ motion in abeyance and to stay the deadline to respond pending further \ndiscovery)  on  the  day  the  response  was  due  was  imprudent,  and  Plaintiffs  must  bear  the \nconsequences of not complying with a deadline absent a court-ordered extension.  Indeed, the \nquestion of whether to extend procedural deadlines is one for the Courtโnot Plaintiffs.   \n \nFitchett, 2013 WL 5468389, at *1 n.4. \n \n10 Notably, plaintiffs did not ask the that the deadlines they sought to extend be suspended pending ruling on their \nmotion to compel, as they did with respect to their deadline for responding to defendantsโ summary judgment \nmotions pending ruling on their motion to compel.  (See Pls.โ Rule 56(d) Mot. ยถ 12). \n16 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 16 of 21\n\n  Plaintiffsโ delay, as serious as it was, does not dictate complete denial of their request for \nextension of time.  They did file their motion before the stipulated, extended deadline for fact \ndiscovery and they did try to resolve the disputes over their request for inspection without court \nintervention.  In addition, to deprive plaintiffs of any additional time to conduct inspection \nactivities would appear to impair their ability to prosecute their claims.  Federal policy, of \ncourse, favors resolution of cases on the merits.  See, e.g., Choice Hotels Intern., Inc. v. Goodwin \nand Boone, 11 F.3d 469, 471-72 (4th Cir. 1993); Rudisill v. United States, No. 5:13โCVโ110โF, \n2014 WL 2014 WL 1117976, at *2 (E.D.N.C. 20 Mar. 2014) (citing Laber v. Harvey, 438 F.3d \n404, 426 (4th Cir. 2006)).  Further, the permitted inspection activities themselves would not \nimpose any greater burden on the Taylor defendants during an extension of the fact discovery \nperiod than they would have during the prior period for fact discovery.  To the extent that \ndefendants would need to re-depose any persons as a result of the inspection activities allowed, \nthe prejudice can be ameliorated by requiring plaintiffs to bear any additional court reporter and \nvideographer fees defendants incur. \n  The court has already found that extension of the fact discovery deadline to 31 May 2015 \nwill adequately accommodate the permissible inspection activities by plaintiffs.  Extension to \nthis date will also adequately address plaintiffsโ lack of diligence with respect to inspection \nactivities and the inherent prejudice to defendants and burden on the court arising from further \ndelay in resolution of this case.  The post-fact discovery deadlines are appropriately extended \nusing as a guide the same intervals between deadlines as under the Scheduling Order. \n  IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the portion of plaintiffsโ motion to compel (D.E. \n93) seeking extension of the case schedule be ALLOWED IN PART and DENIED IN PART on \nthe following terms: \n17 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 17 of 21\n\n  1.  Any additional fact discovery, including the inspection activities provided for \nherein, shall be commenced in time to be completed by 31 May 2015. \n  2.  Reports from retained experts are due by 1 July 2015, and from rebuttal experts \nby 3 August 2015. \n  3.  All discovery shall be completed by 2 September 2015. \n  4.  Any further potentially dispositive motions shall be filed by 2 October 2015. \n  5.  Except as modified herein, the Scheduling Order, as previously amended, remains \nin full force and effect.        \n  6.  Plaintiffs shall bear the court reporter and videographer costs reasonably incurred \nby defendants for any depositions of persons whom defendants previously deposed that are \nprompted by inspection activities provided for herein.              \nDEFENDANTSโ MOTION TO STRIKE (D.E. 139) \n(Denied as Moot) \n  Rule 37(c)(1) addresses tardy disclosure of expert witnesses: \nIf a party fails to provide information or identify a witness as required by Rule 26 \n. . . (e), the party is not allowed to use that information or witness to supply \nevidence  on  a  motion,  at  a  hearing,  or  at  a  trial,  unless  the  failure  was \nsubstantially justified or is harmless.  In addition to or instead of this sanction, the \ncourt, on motion and after giving an opportunity to be heard: (A) may order \npayment of the reasonable expenses, including attorneyโs fees, caused by the \nfailure; (B) may inform the jury of the partyโs failure; and (C) may impose other \nappropriate sanctions . . . . \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1).  Defendants seek to strike the Smolen Declaration on the grounds that it \ncontains expert opinion; plaintiffs failed to disclose Smolen by the 8 August 2014 expert report \ndeadline; and Rule 37(c)(1) prohibits plaintiffs from using the Smollen Declaration in support of \nits Rule 56(d) motion. \n18 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 18 of 21\n\n  As discussed below, allowance of the inspection activities provided for herein dictates that \nfurther proceedings on summary judgment be deferred until after such activities are conducted, \nirrespective of the Smolen Declaration.  IT IS THEFORE ORDERED that defendantsโ motion to \nstrike (D.E. 139) is DENIED AS MOOT.    \nPLAINTIFFSโ RULE 56(d) MOTION (D.E. 143) \n(Recommended for Denial, but with Provision of Comparable Relief) \n  Rule 56(d) provides that where โa nonmovant shows by affidavit or declaration that, for \nspecified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition, the court may: (1) \ndefer considering the motion or deny it; (2) allow time to obtain affidavits or declarations or to \ntake discovery; or (3) issue any other appropriate order.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d). \n  In their Rule 56(d) motion, plaintiffs request, pursuant to that provision, the entry of an \norder denying without prejudice or deferring resolution of defendantsโ motions for summary \njudgment.  Alternatively, plaintiffs seek an order under Rule 6(b) extending the time to respond \nto the summary judgment motions.   \n  Basic fairness dictates that plaintiffs not be required to respond to defendantsโ motions \nfor summary judgment until after the additional discovery provided for herein is completed.  \nIndeed, such additional discovery could be feckless if plaintiffs were not able to exploit it in \ndefending against summary judgment motions by defendants.   \n  While plaintiffs base their motion on statements in the Smolen Declaration that the \ninspection activities sought in the inspection request are vital to their case, that is not the basis \nfor the courtโs determination.  Rather, as indicated, it is the courtโs partial allowance of plaintiffsโ \nmotion to compel that mandates deferral of summary judgment proceedings.  Thus, such deferral \nis not pursuant to Rule 56(d) or Rule 6(b), but rather Rule 16(b)(4), as part of modification of the \nschedule for proceedings in this case.      \n19 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 19 of 21\n\n  The deferral of summary judgment proceedings pending completion of the additional \ndiscovery is most efficiently effected by denying without prejudice the pending motions for \nsummary judgment.  In addition to preserving plaintiffsโ opportunity to utilize the additional \ndiscovery in summary judgment proceedings, such denial would enable defendants to tailor any \nfurther  summary  judgment  motions  they  may  assert  to  information  developed  through  the \nadditional discovery, rather than attempting to address it by supplementation of their current \nsummary judgment filings.   \n  IT IS THEREFORE RECOMMENDED that plaintiffsโ Rule 56(d) motion (D.E. 143) be \nDENIED,  but  that  the  pending  motions  for  summary  judgment  be  DENIED  WITHOUT \nPREJUDICE, pursuant to Rule 16.    \nCONCLUSION \n  In sum, IT IS ORDERED that plaintiffsโ motion to compel (D.E. 93) is ALLOWED IN \nPART AND DENIED IN PART on the terms set out above and that defendantsโ motion to strike \n(D.E. 139) is DENIED AS MOOT;  \n  IT IS RECOMMENDED that plaintiffsโ motion for relief pursuant to Rule 56(d) (D.E. \n143) be denied, but that the pending motions for summary judgment  be DENIED without \nprejudice pursuant to Rule 16; and \n  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Clerk send copies of this Order and Memorandum \nand Recommendation to counsel for the respective parties, who shall have until 27 January 2015 \nto file written objections to the Memorandum and Recommendation herein on plaintiffsโ motion \nRule 56(d) motion.  Failure to file timely written objections bars an aggrieved party from \nreceiving a de novo review by the District Judge on an issue covered in the Memorandum and \nRecommendation  and,  except  upon  grounds  of  plain  error,  from  attacking  on  appeal  the \n20 \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 148   Filed 01/14/15   Page 20 of 21\n\nunobjected-to proposed factual findings and legal conclusions accepted by the District Judge.  \nAny response to objections shall be filed within 14 days after service of the objections on the \nresponding party.   \n      SO ORDERED, this the 13th day of January 2015.   \n \n     \n \n              _________________________ \n              James E.

Box 25670 \nRaleigh, NC 27611 \n \nRe:   N.C. Environmental Justice Network et al. v. Taylor et al., United States District \nCourt for the Eastern District of North Carolina, No. 4:12-cv-154-D \n \nDear Clerk of the Court, \n \n  I am writing to notify you that the United States has reviewed the proposed consent \ndecree in the above-referenced matter and does not object to its entry by this court. \n \n  On July 5, 2018, the Citizen Suit Coordinator for the Department of Justice received the \nproposed consent decree.  The document is subject to review pursuant to the Clean Water Act, 33 \nU.S.C. ยง1365(c)(3).1  This provision provides, in relevant part: \n \nNo consent judgment shall be entered in an action in which the United States is not a \nparty prior to 45 days following the receipt of a copy of the proposed consent \njudgement by the Attorney General and the Administrator.   \n \nSee also 40 C.F.R. ยง 135.5 (service on Citizen Suit Coordinator in the U.S. Department of \nJustice).  A settlement that does not undergo this federal review process is at risk of being void. \n                                                           \n1 For the purposes of the United Statesโ right of review, the term โconsent judgmentโ in the \nClean Water Act citizen suit provisions has a broad meaning and encompasses all instruments \nentered with the consent of the parties that have the effect of resolving any portion of the case.  \nFor example, the United States views a document stipulating to dismissal of a case of any part \nthereof would be within the scope of this language.  Such documents and any associated \ninstruments (even if not submitted to the Court) must be submitted to the United States for \nreview, notwithstanding any provisions purporting to maintain the confidentiality of such \nmaterials.  The Department monitors citizen suit litigation to review compliance with this \nrequirement. \n \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 167   Filed 07/25/18   Page 1 of 3\n\n \n \nPursuant to 11 U.S.C. ยง 362, this action was stayed on June 3, 2015 pending resolution of \nthe bankruptcy case.  ECF No. 164.  On March 23, 2018, the plaintiffs and Taylor defendants \n(debtors in the bankruptcy case) filed a motion in the Bankruptcy Court for an order approving a \nsettlement agreement that would resolve claims raised in this Clean Water Act case as well as the \nissues in the bankruptcy proceeding, including the plaintiffsโ objections to the reorganization \nplan and the Taylor defendantsโ objections to plaintiffsโ proofs of claim.  See ECF No. 166-1.  A \ncopy of that motion was received by the Department of Justice on April 16, 2018.  The decision \nas to whether the settlement agreement is permissible under Bankruptcy Rule 9019 was made by \nthe Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, which granted the motion on \nApril 20, 2018, see id., however, the United States is filing its comment letter in this Court \nbecause the terms of the settlement agreement resolve issues arising from the above-referenced \nClean Water Act case.    \n \nIn its review, the United States seeks to ensure that the proposed consent judgment \ncomplies with the requirements of the relevant statute and is consistent with its purposes.  See \nLocal 93, Intโl Assโn of Firefighters v. City of Cleveland, 478 U.S. 501, 525-56 (1986) (a consent \ndecree should conform with and further the objectives of the law upon which the complaint was \nbased).  For example, if the defendant has been out of compliance with statutory or permit \nrequirements, the proposed consent judgment should require the defendant to come into prompt \ncompliance and should include a civil penalty, enforceable remedies, injunctive relief, and/or a \nsupplemental environmental project (SEP) payment sufficient to deter future violations, or \ncombinations of the above.  \n \nSection V of the proposed consent decree incorporates by reference the terms of the \nsettlement agreement entered by the Bankruptcy Court.  Under that agreement, the Taylor \ndefendants must conduct periodic inspections of the sludge levels in the facility lagoons, \ncomplete a sludge survey, and remove sludge from the lagoons such that sludge levels do not \nexceed 50% of the design volume for the respective lagoon.  The agreement further requires that \nthe removed sludge be taken off site for land application and that the use of offsite land for \nmanagement of swine waste continue at the same level, or greater than it was during the \nbankruptcy proceeding.  The Taylor defendants also agree to modify the Bankruptcy \nReorganization Plan to remove language that could be interpreted to relieve them of liability for \nfuture violations (i.e., post-petition violations) of state or federal environmental laws.  The \nplaintiffs agree to not take water samples, conduct soil testing, or file any new citizen suit against \nthe Taylor defendants for three years from the effective date of the settlement agreement.  \n \nThe parties further agree in the settlement to bear their own attorneysโ fees and to not \nseek to recover fees.  The United States notes for the record that the settlement does not \nincorporate civil penalties, which are an available and typically appropriate remedy under the \nClean Water Act.  \n \n  Given the facts of this case, the United States has no objection to the proposed consent \ndecree.  We accordingly notify the Court. \n \n  The United States affirms for the record that it is not bound by this settlement.  See, e.g., \nHathorn v. Lovorn, 457 U.S. 255, 268 n.23 (1982) (Attorney General is not bound by cases to \nwhich he is not a party); Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Found. Inc., 484 U.S. \n  - 2 - \nCase 4:12-cv-00154-D   Document 167   Filed 07/25/18   Page 2 of 3\n\n \n49, 60 (1987) (explaining that citizen suits are intended to โsupplement rather than supplant \ngovernmental actionโ); Sierra Club v. Electronic Controls Design, 909 F.2d 1350, 1356 n.8 (9th \nCir. 1990) (explaining that the United States is not bound by citizen suit settlements, and may \nโbring its own enforcement action at any timeโ); 131 Cong. Rec. S15, 633 (June 13, 1985) \n(statement of Senator Chafee, on Clean Water Act section 505(c)(3), confirming that the United \nStates is not bound by settlements when it is not a party).  The United States also notes that, if \nthe parties subsequently propose to modify further the consent judgment entered in this case, the \nparties should so notify the United States, and provide a copy of the proposed modifications, 45 \ndays before the Court enters any such modifications.  See 33 U.S.C. ยง 1365(c)(3). \n \n  We appreciate the attention of the Court.  Please contact the undersigned at (202) 305- \n0641 if you have any questions. \n \n            Sincerely, \n     \n             /s/ Frederick H. Turner \n            Frederick H.

Asserting claims and remedies set forth in the Lawsuit, Waterkeeper Alliance filed \nthree proofs of claim in the bankruptcy proceeding (\"Proofs of Claim Nos. 17, 18 and 19\") on \nSeptember 14,2015 and Sound Rivers filed two proofs of claim (\"Proofs ofClaim Nos. 20 and 21) \non the same date. The Debtors filed objections (the \"Claim Objections\") to each of these claims on \n\\ \nOctober 8, 2015 and said Claim Objections are pending before the Court. \n5.

In considering the terms of the Compromise, the Parties have taken into consideration \nexisting factual and legal disputes, including the strengths and weaknesses of the Parties' positions, \nthe equities involved, the information available to the Parties and the costs and risks of litigation. \n9.  The Debtors believe that the proposed Compromise and settlement is fair and \nreasonable, and that approval of the terms set forth in the Settlement and Release Agreement is in the \nbest interest of the bankruptcy estate. \nWherefore, the Debtors pray to the Court as follows: \nI.  For an Order from the Court granting the Compromise according to the terms as set \nforth in the Settlement and Release Agreement; and \n2.  For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper. \nDATED:  March 23,2018 \nAYERS & HAIDT, P.A. \nIs/ David J. Haidt \nBy:  David J. Haidt \nN.C.

DEFENDANTS \n27.  Defendant  Facility,  Taylor  Finishing,  Inc.,  is  a  corporation  organized  under  the  laws  of \nthe  State  of North  Carolina  and  doing  business  in  Trenton,  North  Carolina. \n10 \nCase  4:12-cv-00154-D  Document1  Filed  07/27/12  Page  10  of  27\n28.  Defendant  Facility  is  a  swine  concentrated  animal  feeding  operation  (โโCAFOโโ)  located  in \nthe  Coastal  Plain  of North  Carolina,  in  Jones  County,  North  Carolina  and  has  the  official  mailing \naddress  of 498  E.  Pleasant  Hill  Rd.,  Pink  Hill,  NC,  28572-8719. \n29.  Defendants  McLawhorns  were  the  representatives,  registered  agents,  owners,  and/or \noperators  of Defendant  Facility,  known  then  as  McLawhorn  Livestock  Farm  (Banks),  until  on  or \nabout  November  23,  2010.  Their  mailing  address  is  5903  Highway  17S  New  Bern,  NC  28562, \n5909  Highway  17S  New  Bern,  NC  28562,  and/or  6001  Highway  17S  New  Bern,  NC  28562. \n30.  Defendant  Donald  E.  Taylor  has  been  the  representative,  registered  agent,  owner,  and/or \noperator  of Defendant  Facility  since  on  or  about  November  23,  2010,  when  he  purchased \nDefendant  Facility  from  Defendants  McLawhorns.  Defendant  Taylor  changed  the  name  of \nDefendant  Facility  from  McLawhorn  Livestock  Farm  (Banks)  to  Taylor  Finishing,  Inc. \n31.  All  Defendants  were  or  are  engaged  in,  and  are  and/or  were  responsible  for,  the  operation \nof a  swine  animal  feeding  operation,  the  generation  of large  volumes  of swine  waste  and  the \nhandling,  storage,  disposal  and  discharges  of  swine  waste  and  associated  pollutants  onto  lands \nand  into  waters  surrounding  Defendant  Facility  and  the  Neuse  River  Basin.  All  Defendants  are \nresponsible  for  the  violations  of federal  law  respectively  alleged  herein  against  them,  as  well  as \nthe  resultant  injury  to  lands  and  waters  in  the  Neuse  River  Basin. \n32.  All  parties  are  โpersonsโ  within  the  meaning  of  Section  502  of the  CWA,  33  U.S.C.  ยง \n1362(5),  and  Section  1004  of the  RCRA,  42  U.S.C.  ยง  6903(15). \nFACTUAL  ALLEGATIONS \nA.  POLLUTION FROM  SWINE WASTE \n33.  Pollutants  found  in  swine  waste  include  nutrients,  such  as  nitrogen,  ammonia,  nitrates, \nphosphorus,  and  pathogenic  bacteria,  viruses  and  parasites,  as  well  as  other  pollutants,  that  can \n11 \nCase  4:12-cv-00154-D  Document1  Filed  07/27/12  Page  11  of  27\nendanger  human  health  and  environment,  cause  pollution  and  cause  violations  of water  quality \nstandards  when  released  onto  land  or  into  water. \n34.  Elevated  levels  of nutrients  in  waters  can  cause  harmful  algal  blooms,  excessive  algal \ngrowth,  toxic  blue-green  algae  production,  and  eutrophication  of water bodies.  In  turn,  these \nblooms  can  produce  โdead  zonesโ  in  water  bodies  where  dissolved  oxygen  levels  are  so  low  that \nmost  aquatic  life  cannot  survive  and  can  cause  fish  kills.  Excessive  algae  in  drinking  water \nsources  can  cause  closure  of water  bodies  to  fishing  and  recreation,  as  well  as  result  in  the \nproduction  of harmful  disinfection  byproducts  in  drinking  water,  such  as  trihalmethanes  and \nhaloacetic  acids,  that  can  produce  serious  adverse  effects  on  human  health. \n35.  Fecal  coliform  and  E.  coli  bacteria  are  microbial  pathogens  associated  with  human  and \nanimal  waste.  High  levels  of fecal  bacteria  can  indicate  a  water body  is  not  safe  for  body-contact \nrecreation,  for  consumption  of shellfish,  or  for  use  as  drinking  water.  Excessive  amounts  of fecal \nbacteria  in  water  used  by  humans  can  cause  diarrhea,  cramps,  nausea,  headaches,  and  other \nsymptoms,  as  well  as  indicate  the  presence  of other pathogenic  bacteria,  viruses  and  protozoa \nthat  can  present  serious  risk  to  human  health. \nB.  NEUSE RIVER BASIN \n36.  The  Neuse  River  Basin  is  the  third  largest  river  basin  in  North  Carolina  and  is  contained \nentirely  within  the  boundaries  of North  Carolina.  The  Long  Branch  is  a  tributary  to  the  Trent \nRiver,  the  Trent  River  is  a  tributary  to  the  Neuse  River,  and  the  Neuse  River  Estuary  and  all  of \nthese  water  bodies  are  contained  within  the  Neuse  River  Basin. \n37.  The  Neuse  River  feeds  one  of the  nationโs  largest  and  most  productive  coastal  estuaries, \nthe  Albermarle-Pamlico  Sound,  a  nursery  for  90  percent  of the  commercial  seafood  species \ncaught  in  North  Carolina.  The  Neuse  River  Basin  is  an  important  spawning  area  for  numerous \n12 \nCase  4:12-cv-00154-D  Document1  Filed  07/27/12  Page  12  of  27\nspecies  such  as  herring,  shad,  and  striped  bass,  and  provides  habitat  for  several  important \nrecreational  and  commercial  species,  including  catfish,  bass,  flounder,  blue  crabs,  shrimp,  and \noysters,  as  well  as  several  rare  and/or  endangered  species.  The  Neuse  River  Basin  is  heavily \nused  for  outdoor  recreational  activities,  such  as  hiking,  biking,  wildlife  viewing,  recreational \nboating,  recreational  and  commercial  fishing,  and  commercial  shellfish  harvesting. \n38.  Excessive  nutrient  loading  is  the  primary  stressor  causing  water  quality  impairment  in  the \nNeuse  River  Basin.  The  water  quality  and  use  of the  waters  in  the  Neuse  River  Basin  for \nrecreational  and  commercial  activities  has  been  adversely  affected  by  the  growth  of excess  algae \nand  eutrophication  from  nutrient  pollution. \n39.  The  already  declining  Neuse  River  Basin  water  quality  has  been  adversely  impacted  by \nthe  increase  in  the  number  of CAFOs  in  the  Neuse  River  watershed  and  the  release  of nutrients \nfrom  these  facilities  into  the  surrounding  waters  and  onto  the  surrounding  land.  This  is,  in  part, \nbecause  many  of these  CAFOs  have  ditches  and  tile  drains  that  serve  as  direct  conveyances  for \nthe  highly  nutrient-laden  water  from  CAFOs  to  surface  waters. \nAO.  As  a  result  of nutrient  pollution,  all  of the  waters  in  the  Neuse  River  watershed  are \ndesignated  Nutrient  Sensitive  Waters  โ  waters  that  require  reductions  in  nutrients  such  as \nnitrogen  and  phosphorus. \nC.  DEFENDANT  FACILITYโS  SITE DESCRIPTION AND WASTE DISPOSAL  PRACTICES \n41.  Defendant  Facility  is  located  in  the  Neuse  River  Basin. \n42.  It  is  bordered  on  the  east  by  a  tributary  of the  Long  Branch  and  on  the  northwest,  west, \nand  southwest  by  the  Long  Branch.  The  Long  Branch  is  a  tributary  to  the  Trent  River  which  is  a \ntributary  of the  Neuse  River. \n13 \nCase  4:12-cv-00154-D  Document1  Filed  07/27/12  Page  13  of  27\n43.  Defendant  Facility  is  a  Large  CAFO,  as  defined  by  40  CFR  ยง  122.23,  that  confines  or \nstables  approximately  10,200  feeder-to-finish  swine,  and  is  designed  to  hold  4,380  wean-to- \nfeeder  swine. \n44,  In  or  about  July  1998,  July  2007,  and  October  2009,  North  Carolinaโs  Department  of \nEnvironment  and  Natural  Resources  issued  Defendant  Facility  a  Certificate  of Coverage \n(Number  AWS520002),  requiring  the  operation  of the  Defendant  Facilityโs  animal  waste \ncollection,  treatment,  storage,  and  land  application  system  in  accordance  with  the  state  General \nPermit  AWG100000,  which  requires  compliance  with  a  โzero  dischargeโ  standard,  prohibiting \nany  discharges  of pollutants  to  waters  of the  state. \n45.  Defendants  have  not  applied  for,  and  do  not  possess,  a  federal  NPDES  permit  for  the \nDefendant  Facility  as  required  by  the  CWA. \n46.  Defendant  Facility  and  the  land  where  swine  waste  is  applied  is  traversed  by  drainage \nditches  that  carry  water  and  associated  pollutants  from  the  facility  and  land  application  area  into \nthe  Long  Branch  which  in  turn  flows  to  the  Trent  River  and  then  to  the  Neuse  River,  which  are \nwaters  of the  United  States.  The  Neuse  River  empties  into  the  Albermarle-Pamilico  Sound.  The \nNeuse  River  is  listed  as  a  nutrient-impaired  water  under  the  CWA. \n47.  Defendant  Facility  is  underlain  by  shallow  groundwater  that  discharges  to  the  Long \nBranch  which  in  turn  flows  to  the  Trent  River  and  then  to  the  Neuse  River. \n48.  Defendant  Facility  has  disposed,  and  is  continuing  to  dispose  of large  volumes  of swine \nwaste  on  land  at  the  facility  in  excess  of any  legitimate  crop  fertilization  requirement,  on  bare \nground,  directly  into  water,  into  drainage  ditches,  and  generally  in  a  manner  that  causes  runoff of \nwaste,  discharges  of pollutants,  and  contamination  of groundwater.  Discharges  occur,  without \nlimitation,  through  direct  releases  to  water,  groundwater  transport,  and  runoff generated  by \n14 \nCase  4:12-cv-00154-D  Document1  Filed  07/27/12  Page  14  of  27\nrainfall  from  the  areas  where  Defendants  have  stored  and  disposed  of  swine  waste  at  Defendant \nFacility. \n49.  Defendant  Facility  has  a  pattern  of historic  and  continuing  illegal  discharges  and  releases \nof pollutants  from  swine  waste  to  land,  groundwater,  and  surface  waters  of the  Neuse  River \nBasin.  These  historic  and  continuing  discharges,  releases,  and  waste  management  practices  pose \nan  imminent  and  substantial  endangerment  to  human  health  and  the  environment  in  the  Trent  and \nNeuse  River  watersheds. \n50.  Swine  waste  generated  at  Defendant  Facility  has  been  improperly  treated,  stored,  and \ndisposed  of in  a  manner  that  has  created  an  โopen  dumpโ  and  has  polluted  the  surrounding  land, \ngroundwater  and  surface  water. \n51.
