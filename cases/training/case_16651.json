The court denies the plaintiffs' motion to enjoin DHS from terminating the CAM Parole Program going forward. The court grants the motion to require DHS to continue to process the 2,714 conditionally approved beneficiaries under the procedures that it had in place for processing the beneficiaries before it terminated the Program and orders the following: (1) DHS's decision to mass-rescind conditional approvals for the 2,714 beneficiaries conditionally approved for parole but who had not traveled to the United States is vacated, (2) DHS must continue the post-conditional-approval processing for the 2,714 beneficiaries under the policies and procedures for processing beneficiaries that it had in place before January 2017, and is preliminarily enjoined from adopting any policy, procedure, or practice to not process the beneficiaries or to place their processing on hold en masse, and (3) by March 21, 2019, DHS must submit to the court and counsel its plan for processing these 2,714 beneficiaries with benchmarks for assessing compliance.

    "summary": "<p>Applicants and beneficiaries of the Central American Minors (CAM) parole program filed this class-action lawsuit on June 13, 2018, challenging the Trump Administration's termination of the program and its revocation of parole for nearly 3,000 children. Seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as that the defendants be equitably estopped, the plaintiffs alleged that the termination of the program violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), regulations promulgated by the Department of Homeland Security, and Fifth Amendment due process and equal protection. The plaintiffs were represented by the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) and the law firm Arnold & Porter LLP. The plaintiffs filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler.</p><p>Established in 2014, the Departments of State (DOS) and Homeland Security (DHS) set up CAM as a dual refugee/parole program in response to the dramatic rise in the number of unaccompanied children from the so-called “Northern Triangle” countries of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. The CAM program allowed children from these countries who had at least one parent living lawfully in the U.S. to apply for refugee resettlement or parole while still in their home countries; in the two and a half years it was in operation, the program enabled at least 3,000 people to emigrate to the U.S. However, within a few days of President Trump’s inauguration and without any public announcement, the CAM program stopped processing applications, even those which had already been submitted. On August 16, 2017, DHS formally announced that the CAM program would be terminated and that conditional parole for all CAM beneficiaries who had not yet traveled to the United States would be rescinded. </p><p>On July 12, 2018, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction which would prevent the government from terminating the CAM program and restore the conditional parole approvals that had been rescinded in August 2017, arguing that the continued separation of children from their parents was causing them irreparable harm. </p><p>On December 10, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part the government’s motion to dismiss. 363 F. Supp 3d 1048. Judge Beeler denied the motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' APA claims, finding the government’s mass revocation of conditional parole approval to be unlawful. The judge dismissed all other claims. On the same day, the court ordered the parties to meet and confer about the plaintiffs' preliminary injunction motion from July.</p><p>On March 1, 2019, the court granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction. 2019 WL 990680. While Judge Beeler denied the motion to enjoin DHS from terminating the CAM program going forward, the Judge ordered the government to resume processing for the approximately 2,700 children who had already received conditional approval. The government was also prohibited from enacting any policy, procedure, or practice to not process the beneficiaries or to put their processing on hold en masse. </p><p>On April 12, 2019, the parties entered into a binding memorandum of understanding. The settlement agreement converts the court’s order into a permanent injunction, over which the court retains jurisdiction to enforce. The agreement requires the government to finish processing those applicants whose applications were in their final stages when the government terminated the CAM program. </p><p> </p><p>On May 17, 2019, the final judgment and order for permanent injunction were filed by the court which finalized the agreement between the two parties. DHS was enjoined from rescinding conditional approvals for the 2,700 individuals who had been approved for parole. Additionally, DHS was ordered to complete the post-conditional approval processing for those 2,700 individuals under the policies that had been in place before January 2017. Finally, DHS was enjoined from adopting any policy or practice that would bar it from processing the 2,700 individuals or putting their processing on hold en masse. </p><p>On October 1, 2019, the defendants filed their first status update, which is required of them every three months until the processing is complete. They reported that most of the specific processing items required of them were still in process, but all items, if not completed already, were expected to be completed by the end of October 2019.</p><p>The defendants filed additional status reports on December 27, 2019, and March 31, 2020. The case is ongoing.</p>",

Parole does not constitute admission in a valid immigration or nonimmigrant \n6  status, but it allows a foreign national to enter and physically be present in the United States. \n7  In 2014, the government instituted a program called the Central American Minors (“CAM”) \n8  Program, which allowed parents who were lawfully present in the United States to apply to bring \n9  their children and other qualifying family members in three countries — Honduras, Guatemala, \n10  and El Salvador, collectively known as the “Northern Triangle” — to reunite with them in the \n11  United States. A goal of the Program was to discourage children from making the long and \n12  dangerous journey from the Northern Triangle to the United States to try to reunite with their \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  parents; the Program sought to achieve this goal by allowing applicant parents to apply for their \nCfi\n tclaC 14  beneficiary children while their children remained in their original countries.1 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  The CAM Program had two components: a refugee component and a parole component. U.S. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”), an agency within the U.S. Department of \nS d nr\nee 17  Homeland Security (“DHS”), first evaluated beneficiaries to see if they qualified for refugee status \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  (which, among other things, requires persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution “on \n19  account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political \n20  opinion”). If the beneficiaries qualified, USCIS referred them for approval as refugees under the \n21  CAM Refugee Program. If they did not qualify, USCIS automatically considered them for parole \n22  into the United States under the CAM Parole Program. \n23 \n24 \n25                                                   \n1 Some documents related to the CAM Program use the term “applicant” to refer to the parents present \n26  in the United States, while others use it to refer to the children or qualifying family members in the \nNorthern Triangle countries. This order uses “applicant” to refer to the parents present in the United \n27  States, “beneficiary” to refer to the children or qualifying family members in the Northern Triangle \ncountries, and “participant” to refer to applicants and beneficiaries.  \n28 \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  3 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 51   Filed 12/10/18   Page 4 of 64\n \n1  By the end of 2016, USCIS had interviewed over 5,500 beneficiaries. It approved 99% for \n2  either refugee resettlement or parole under the CAM Program: it approved approximately 30% \n3  interviewed beneficiaries as refugees and approximately 99% of the remaining beneficiaries (69% \n4  out of 70%) for parole. Over 1,335 beneficiaries arrived in the United States. \n5  In January 2017, following a change in presidential administrations, incoming president \n6  Donald Trump issued an Executive Order that (among other things) directed the Secretary of \n7  Homeland Security to “take all appropriate action” to ensure that DHS exercised its parole \n8  authority “only on a case-by-case basis” and “only when an individual demonstrates urgent \n9  humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit derived from such parole.” DHS stopped \n10  processing CAM Program applications — including the applications for beneficiaries who had \n11  been conditionally approved for parole and were awaiting processing to finalize their \n12  arrangements to travel to the United States — and began a review of the CAM Parole Program. In \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  August 2017, DHS announced that it was terminating the CAM Parole Program. It also announced \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  that it was rescinding parole for the approximately 2,700 beneficiaries who had been conditionally \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  approved for parole but who had not yet traveled to the United States.2 It stated that those \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  individuals, and other individuals who wanted to apply for parole, could still do so independent of \nS d nr\nee 17  the CAM Parole Program but that it would no longer award parole through the Program. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  The plaintiffs in this case — applicant parents lawfully residing in the United States who \n19  applied to the CAM Program, their beneficiary children in Northern Triangle countries, and the \n20  nonprofit immigrant-rights organization CASA — filed this putative class-action lawsuit against \n21  President Trump, DHS, USCIS, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of USCIS, the \n22  State Department, the Secretary of State, and the United States, alleging that the government’s \n23  termination of the CAM Parole Program and its rescinding of conditional approvals of parole were \n24  unlawful. The plaintiffs bring the following four categories of claims:  \n25 \n26 \n                                                 \n27  2 DHS did not rescind parole for any beneficiary who had entered the United States before the time it \nterminated the CAM Parole Program. \n28 \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  4 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 51   Filed 12/10/18   Page 5 of 64\n \n1  1.  claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), arguing that the \n2  government’s termination of the CAM Parole Program and rescinding of conditional \n3  approvals for parole were arbitrary and capricious, \n4  2.  a claim under the Due Process Clause, arguing that the applicant-parent plaintiffs have \n5  a constitutionally protected liberty interest in the companionship and society of their \n6  family members in Central America, and that the government deprived them of this \n7  liberty interest without due process by terminating the CAM Parole Program in an \n8  arbitrary, irrational, and unlawful manner, \n9  3.  a claim under the equal-protection component of the Due Process Clause, arguing that \n10  the government’s termination of the CAM Parole Program was substantially motivated \n11  by discriminatory animus by President Trump and the Trump Administration toward \n12  Latinos, and \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  4.  a claim for equitable estoppel, arguing that the government engaged in affirmative \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  misconduct by publicly representing between January 2017 and August 2017 that the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  CAM Parole Program was still in operation, when it actually had been secretly \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  terminated. \nS d nr\nee 17  The putative class is all applicants and beneficiaries who applied for the CAM Program before \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  August 16, 2017, who were denied refugee status under the CAM Refugee Program, and who then \n19  were denied parole under the CAM Parole Program due to its termination.3 \n20  The plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction (1) enjoining the government from \n21  terminating the CAM Parole Program and (2) requiring the government to reinstate the conditional \n22  approvals of parole that were rescinded pursuant to that termination. The defendants moved to \n23  dismiss the complaint. \n24 \n25 \n                                                 \n26  3 The plaintiffs do not bring any claims with respect to the refugee portion of the CAM Program or any \ngovernment actions regarding that portion. They bring claims only regarding the parole portion. See \n27  Compl. – ECF No. 3 (¶ 3), 40–44 (¶¶ 128–50).

(The court will address the plaintiffs’ \n2  motion for a preliminary injunction in a separate order.) The court denies the motion to dismiss the \n3  plaintiffs’ APA claims as they relate to the government’s mass-rescinding conditional approvals of \n4  parole made under the CAM Parole Program. In all other respects, the court grants the defendants’ \n5  motion to dismiss. \n6   \n7  STATEMENT \n8  1.  The Immigration and Nationality Act and Parole Generally \n9  The INA provides that the Secretary of Homeland Security “may, [subject to certain \n10  exceptions], in [her] discretion parole into the United States temporarily under such conditions as \n11  [s]he may prescribe only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant \n12  public benefit any alien applying for admission to the United States[.]”4 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A). \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  The INA also provides that “such parole of such alien shall not be regarded as an admission of the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  alien[.]” Id. The INA further provides that “when the purposes of such parole shall, in the opinion \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  of the [Secretary], have been served[,] the alien shall forthwith return or be returned to the custody \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  from which he was paroled and thereafter his case shall continue to be dealt with in the same \nS d nr\nee 17  manner as that of any other applicant for admission to the United States.” Id. The Secretary’s \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  parole authority is in turn delegated to various DHS officials. 8 C.F.R. § 212.5(a). \n19   \n20  2.  The Complaint \n21  2.1  September–December 2014: The Creation of the CAM Parole Program \n22  The government first proposed the CAM Program on September 18, 2014, as part of the \n23  President’s annual recommendations to Congress on proposed refugee admissions for the \n24  following year, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1157(d) and (e).5 The annual Presidential Determination on \n25 \n                                                 \n4 Section 1182(d)(5)(A) refers to the Attorney General, but pursuant to 6 U.S.C. § 557, that authority \n26 \nhas now been transferred to the Secretary of Homeland Security.

An individual considered \n10  for parole may be eligible for parole if DHS finds that the individual is at risk of \nharm, he/she clears all background vetting, there is no serious derogatory \n11  information, and someone has committed to financially support the individual \nwhile he/she is in the United States. . . .

Border security is critically important to the national \n seirt security of the United States. Aliens who illegally enter the United States without \ntatsiD 16  inspection or admission present a significant threat to national security and public \nS d nr safety. Such aliens have not been identified or inspected by Federal immigration \nee 17 \ntinhtr officers to determine their admissibility to the United States. The recent surge of \nUo\nN 18  illegal immigration at the southern border with Mexico has placed a significant \nstrain on Federal resources and overwhelmed agencies charged with border security \n19  and immigration enforcement, as well as the local communities into which many of \nthe aliens are placed. \n20 \n. . . . \n21 \nSec. 11.

There are approximately 2,700 \n7 \nindividuals currently conditionally approved.

This termination of the CAM Parole program does not preclude \n11 \nsuch individuals from applying for parole consideration independent of the CAM \n12  Parole program by filing USCIS Form I-131, Application for Travel Document, \na \ntr in consistent with the instructions for that form.

Since that time, DHS conducted a careful review of the Central American \nMinors (CAM) Parole program and has decided to terminate the program. The \n21 \ndecision to terminate the program was made because the CAM Parole program \nprovided parole very broadly and not in accordance with the statu[t]e and the \n22 \nPresident’s Executive Order. \n23 \nQ7: By eliminating this program, do you anticipate there will be an upswing in \nthe number of UACs [unaccompanied alien children] who attempt to enter the \n24 \nUnited States illegally? \n25 \nA7: The CAM Refugee program is unaffected by the termination of the CAM \nParole program and will continue to provide a means through which vulnerable \n26 \nchildren in-country may be considered for resettlement to the United States.

Other Claims \n24  In evaluating the defendants’ motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ non-APA claims, the court is \n25  limited to considering the complaint, documents incorporated into the complaint by reference, and \n26  matters of which it may take judicial notice.

Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555–56 (2007). \n4  A complaint must contain a “short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is \n5  entitled to relief” to give the defendant “fair notice” of what the claims are and the grounds upon \n6  which they rest. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2); Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. A complaint does not need \n7  detailed factual allegations, but “a plaintiff’s obligation to provide the ‘grounds’ of his \n8  ‘entitlement to relief’ requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the \n9  elements of a cause of action will not do. Factual allegations must be enough to raise a claim for \n10  relief above the speculative level[.]” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (citations omitted). \n11  To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual allegations, which \n12  when accepted as true, “‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). “A claim has facial plausibility \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Id. “The plausibility standard is not akin to a \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  ‘probability requirement,’ but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted \nS d nr\nee 17  unlawfully.” Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557). “Where a complaint pleads facts that are \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  merely consistent with a defendant’s liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and \n19  plausibility of ‘entitlement to relief.’” Id.

As the applicant parents are plaintiffs with respect \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  to all of the claims in the complaint and all of the relief sought, their presence is sufficient to \n19  render this case justiciable, and it is unnecessary to address at this juncture whether the \n20  beneficiary-children plaintiffs or CASA independently have standing. \n21   \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25                                                   \n88 Defs.

The facts found were \n7  that the CAM Parole Program was granting parole to virtually all beneficiaries who were \n8  interviewed. The conclusion made was that doing so was not in keeping with the new \n9  administration’s view of the parole statute and its policies on immigration. Whether the court \n10  agrees or disagrees with the government’s conclusion, it is “not empowered to substitute [its] \n11  judgment for that of the agency,” Sierra Club, 510 F.3d at 1022, and it cannot say that the \n12  agency’s actions were arbitrary or capricious. \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  The plaintiffs cite to cases where courts have found that the government’s attempts to \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  terminate aspects of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) or the Temporary \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Protected Status (“TPS”) programs were arbitrary and capricious under the APA and argue that the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  termination of the CAM Parole Program similarly violates the APA.

Cir. filed Aug. 10, 2018). \n11  By claiming that court decisions had left the DACA program legally unsupportable — instead \n12  of saying that it disagreed with DACA based on its own policy choices — DHS tried to rescind \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  the program (which is popular and supported by a majority of Americans) without taking political \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  responsibility for doing so. The DACA courts that have held that DHS’s attempts to terminate \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  DACA were arbitrary and capricious did so in large part because DHS tried to blame the courts for \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  its decision instead of assuming responsibility and accountability itself. As the Ninth Circuit \nS d nr\nee 17  explained: \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  [P]ublic accountability for agency action can only be achieved if the electorate \nknows how to apportion the praise for good measures and the blame for bad ones. \n19 \nWithout knowing the true source of an objectionable agency action, “the public \ncannot ‘determine on whom the blame or the punishment of a pernicious measure, \n20 \nor series of pernicious measures ought really to fall.’” . . . . \n21 \n. . . . When an agency justifies an action solely with an assertion that the law \nprohibits any other course, it shifts responsibility for the outcome from the \n22 \nExecutive Branch to Congress (for making the law in question) or the courts (for \n23  construing it). If the Executive is correct in its interpretation of the law, then the \npublic is correct to blame the other two branches for any resulting problems. But if \n24  the Executive is wrong, then it avoids democratic accountability for a choice that \nwas the agency’s to make all along. . . . “[A]n official cannot claim that the law ties \n25 \nher hands while at the same time denying the courts’ power to unbind her. She may \nescape political accountability or judicial review, but not both.” \n26 \n27 \n28 \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  41 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 51   Filed 12/10/18   Page 42 of 64\n \n1  Regents III, 908 F.3d at 498–99 (citations omitted); accord Batalla Vidal II, 279 F. Supp. 3d at \n2  421 (“This rule . . . ensures that agencies are accountable for their decisions: If an agency makes a \n3  decision on policy grounds, it must say so, not act as if courts have tied its hands.”). \n4  Here, by contrast, the government and DHS are assuming accountability and responsibility for \n5  terminating the CAM Parole Program on policy grounds. This is a crucial distinction. President \n6  Trump announced his new policy on parole in Executive Order 13,767: “It is the policy of the \n7  executive branch to end the abuse of parole and asylum provisions currently used to prevent the \n8  lawful removal of removable aliens.” Exec. Order 13,767, 82 Fed. Reg. at 8795. Secretary Kelly \n9  similarly memorialized that DHS policy’s views were that “[t]he practice of granting parole to \n10  certain aliens in pre-designated categories in order to create immigration programs not established \n11  by Congress, has contributed to a border security crisis, undermined the integrity of the \n12  immigration laws and the parole process, and created an incentive for additional illegal \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  immigration.”107 The government recognized that it was changing policy qua policy.108 The issue \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  that was present in the DACA cases — trying to shift responsibility to the courts for the decision \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  to rescind a popular program instead of the agency itself claiming responsibility — is not present \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  in the same way here. \nS d nr\nee 17  Another factor that distinguishes this case from the DACA cases is that (in the opinion of \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  many DACA courts), the government’s legal assessment and analyses of DACA were wrong as a \n19  matter of law. Regents III, 908 F.3d at 510 (“[B]ecause the Acting Secretary [of Homeland \n20  Security] was . . . incorrect in her belief that DACA was illegal and had to be rescinded, plaintiffs \n21  are likely to succeed in demonstrating that the rescission must be set aside.”); Batalla Vidal II, 279 \n22  F.

By relying on legal analyses that \n6  were wrong as a matter of law, the government’s decision to rescind DACA was necessarily \n7  arbitrary and capricious. Regents III, 908 F.3d at 505 (“[I]t is black letter law that where an agency \n8  purports to act solely on the basis that a certain result is legally required, and that legal premise \n9  turns out to be incorrect, the action must be set aside, regardless of whether the action could have \n10  been justified as an exercise of discretion.”) (emphasis in original); Batalla Vidal II, 279 F.

In this case, the plaintiffs have not identified a similarly fatally \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  flawed legal assessment or analysis by the government. DHS has expressed its view that the better \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  interpretation of the statutory language of the parole statute is that it “appears to strongly counsel \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  in favor of using the parole authority sparingly and only in individual cases where, after careful \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  consideration of the circumstances, parole is necessary because of demonstrated urgent \nS de nre 17  humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.”109 That interpretation is not flawed in the same \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  way that — according to the DACA courts — DHS’s interpretation of the legality of DACA was \n19  flawed. In construing a predecessor version of the parole statute (that did not include the “case-by-\n20  case” requirement that the current version does), the Ninth Circuit held \n21  The legislative history of the parole provision indicates that Congress intended that \ntemporary admission be granted infrequently. . . .

(1965), reprinted in 1965 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3328, 3335).110 Congress reemphasized this view of \n3  parole when it amended the parole statute to restrict the government’s discretion to approve parole \n4  “only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.” Illegal \n5  Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.

In \nrecent years, however, parole has been used increasingly to admit entire categories \n10 \nof aliens who do not qualify for admission under any other category in immigration \n11  law, with the intent that they will remain permanently in the United States. This \ncontravenes the intent of section 212(d)(5), but also illustrates why further, specific \na  12  limitations on the Attorney General’s discretion are necessary. \ntr in\nuoro 13  H.R. Rep. No. 104-469, at 140 (1996). The court cannot say that DHS’s view — that the parole \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  statute counsels in favor of awarding parole sparingly — is legally erroneous, or that its decision \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  to terminate a program that awarded parole broadly was based on a flawed legal analysis in the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  same way that its attempt to terminate DACA were.111 \nS d nr\nee 17  The plaintiffs analogize to the TPS cases, but those are distinguishable too. The TPS program \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  is a humanitarian program that authorizes DHS to temporarily permit nationals from certain \n19  countries to live and work in the United States when an ongoing armed conflict, environmental \n20  disaster, or other conditions prevent the safe return of those persons to their country of origin. See \n21  8 U.S.C. § 1254a(b)(1)(A)–(C). Prior administrations (both Republican and Democratic) evaluated \n22 \n                                                 \n23 \n110 The version of the parole statute in effect at the time that Mason was decided read, “[t]he Attorney \nGeneral may . . . in his discretion parole into the United States temporarily, under such conditions as \n24 \nhe may prescribe for emergent reasons or for reasons deemed strictly in the public interest any alien \napplying for admission to the United States.” Mason, 862 F.2d at 194 (ellipsis in original) (quoting \n25 \n8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5) (1988)). \n26  111 The court expresses no opinion about whether the parole statute prohibits a program such as the \nCAM Parole Program, which awarded parole broadly. It holds only that the Trump Administration’s \n27  view — that programs that award parole broadly are not consistent with the Administration’s reading \nof the parole statute and thus should be terminated — is not based on a legally erroneous analysis. \n28 \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  44 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 51   Filed 12/10/18   Page 45 of 64\n \n1  whether to extend TPS status for countries beyond the period of their initial designation by \n2  considering both the originating conditions that led to the countries’ initial designations and \n3  subsequent intervening events that prevented safe return of the countries’ nationals.

Parole is at the discretion of DHS, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A), and an \n5  application for parole that has not been approved does not engender a reliance interest. See Wong \n6  v.

The costs were discrete, short-term \n8  costs.

It does not otherwise require the \n4  Secretary to consider any particular factors or mandate how the Secretary must weigh competing \n5  interests. Among other things, it does not require the Secretary to consider (1) the general country \n6  conditions in the Northern Triangle or any other country or (2) whether Central American minors \n7  would otherwise decide to journey by land to the United States — neither of which is a “case-by-\n8  case basis” — in deciding what procedures she will establish or terminate for parole applications. \n9  The previous administration might have weighed these considerations more heavily in establishing \n10  the CAM Parole Program, but that does not obligate future administrations to consider and weigh \n11  them similarly. Cf. Organized Vill. of Kake v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 795 F.3d 956, 968 (9th Cir. \n12  2015) (en banc) (“[Agency] was entitled in 2003 to give more weight to socioeconomic concerns \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  than it had in 2001, even on precisely the same record. . . .

The plaintiffs \n22  characterize this as a “secret shutdown” of the Program that was arbitrary and capricious and \n23  violated the notice requirements in 5 U.S.C. § 552. Even if this were the case, DHS’s subsequent \n24  public termination of the CAM Parole Program in August 2017 moots that challenge, at least with \n25  respect to DHS’s decision to terminate the Program going forward. See Util. Air Regulatory Grp. \n26  v. EPA, 744 F.3d 741, 750 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (holding that challenges to agency’s failure to provide \n27  notice of new rule were mooted by agency’s later re-promulgation of the rule with notice, even if \n28  the two rules were identical) (citing Nat.

Setting aside DHS’s “secret shutdown” of \n3  the CAM Parole Program in January 2017 would afford the plaintiffs no relief in light of DHS’s \n4  public termination of the Program in August 2017. The plaintiffs’ objections to the “secret \n5  shutdown,” as they relate to the termination of CAM Parole Program going forward, are moot. \n6  2.2  Rescinding Conditional Approvals of Parole \n7  The analysis is different with respect to DHS’s decision to rescind all conditional approvals of \n8  parole that it issued before it terminated the CAM Parole Program in August 2017. Program \n9  participants who received conditional approvals of parole (and made arrangements based on those \n10  approvals) had more serious reliance interests than individuals who never received approvals. The \n11  court holds that DHS’s failure to take into account and address those more serious reliance \n12  interests when it mass-rescinded parole for those participants was arbitrary and capricious. \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  The government first argues that those participants do not have reliance interests because their \nCfi\n tclaC 14  parole approvals were only “conditional.”124 But as the plaintiffs plead in their complaint and as \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  the administrative record confirms, the only steps following conditional approval to travel to the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  United States and be fully paroled were nondiscretionary ones: the completion of a medical exam, \nS de nre 17  final security checks, and making travel arrangements.125 (By contrast, participants who had never \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18 \n                                                 \n19  124 Defs.

This distinction means that CAM Parole \n2  Program participants with approved applications for parole had “serious reliance interests.” The \n3  government argues that the Secretary of Homeland Security retained discretion to rescind parole \n4  for participants who had conditionally approval.126 But that does not mean that participants with \n5  approval had no reliance interests in their parole. Cf. Batalla Vidal II, 279 F. Supp. 3d at 432 \n6  (while DHS could in its discretion rescind DACA at any time, “it does not follow that \n7  [beneficiaries] had no reliance interests therein, such that Defendants were free to end the DACA \n8  program without considering such interests”) (emphasis in original) (citing Encino Motorcars, 136 \n9  S. Ct. at 2124–26). \n10  The government next argues that it took reliance interests into account because it did not \n11  rescind parole for beneficiaries who had arrived in the United States.127 The court cannot see how \n12  this decision for beneficiaries in the United States takes into account the serious reliance interests \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  of participants with conditional approval who had not arrived or whose family members had not \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  arrived in the United States.

Mot. to Dismiss – ECF No. 32 at 20. \n25 \n127 Id. \n26 \n128 Id. \n27  129 August 2017 Info Sheet – ECF No. 33-6 at 4 (AR000037); Rescission Form Letter – ECF No. \n33-46 at 2 (AR000454). \n28 \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  54 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 51   Filed 12/10/18   Page 55 of 64\n \n1  The court holds that when DHS mass-rescinded the conditional parole approvals of CAM \n2  Parole Program participants, it did not adequately take into account and address the participants’ \n3  serious reliance interests. Consequently, its actions in mass-rescinding approvals were arbitrary \n4  and capricious and must be set aside under the APA. \n5  The “serious reliance interests” requirement does not mean that DHS lacks the authority to \n6  rescind conditional approvals of parole for CAM Parole Program participants, notwithstanding the \n7  participants’ reliance on their approvals. DHS has that authority. It has the authority to rescind \n8  parole even from Program beneficiaries who have arrived in the United States and similarly has \n9  the authority to rescind conditional approvals of applications where the beneficiaries are still \n10  outside the United States. See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A). But DHS must recognize and \n11  acknowledge that Program participants who were approved for parole had serious reliance \n12  interests in that parole, take those reliance interests into account, and explain why it felt it \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  appropriate to nonetheless mass-rescind their parole in the face of that reliance. This ensures \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  transparency and accountability. If DHS thinks that Program participants’ reliance on their parole \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  is less important than its new policies in mass-rescinding that parole, it can make that choice, so \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  long as it explains its reasons so that it can be held accountable. Cf. NAACP, 298 F. Supp. 3d at \nS d nr\nee 17  249 (the government must explain its actions so that “members of the public know how their \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  elected officials have used their enforcement powers, and they can hold those officials accountable \n19  by speaking out, by petitioning their representatives, or ultimately at the ballot box”). \n20  When it mass-rescinded conditional approvals, DHS failed to take into account and address the \n21  serious reliance interests of CAM Parole Program participants whom it had approved. Its mass-\n22  rescission was arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA.130 \n23  *  *  * \n24 \n25                                                   \n130 Because the court finds that DHS’s mass-rescission of parole approvals was arbitrary and \n26  capricious because DHS failed to take into account serious reliance interests, it is unnecessary to \naddress whether the mass-rescission was also arbitrary and capricious because it was impermissibly \n27  retroactive or because it violated DHS’s own guidance and thus ran afoul of the doctrine in United \nStates ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260 (1954). \n28 \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  55 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 51   Filed 12/10/18   Page 56 of 64\n \n1  For the foregoing reasons, the court denies the defendants’ motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ \n2  APA claims as they relate to the government’s mass-rescinding of conditional approvals of parole. \n3  The court otherwise grants the defendants’ motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ APA claims. \n4   \n5  3.  Due Process \n6  The plaintiffs bring a claim on behalf of the plaintiffs in the United States for violation of due \n7  process.131 \n8  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that no person may be “deprived of \n9  life, liberty, or property, without due process of law[.]” U.S. Const. amend. V. “‘A threshold \n10  requirement to a substantive or procedural due process claim is the plaintiff’s showing of a liberty \n11  or property interest protected by the Constitution.’” Regents III, 908 F.3d at 514 (quoting Wedges/\n12  Ledges of Cal., Inc. v. City of Phoenix, 24 F.3d 56, 62 (9th Cir. 1994)). The applicant-parent \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  plaintiffs claim as their protected interest a general constitutional liberty interest in “the \nCfi\n tclaC 14  companionship and society of their family members who are stranded in Central America.”132 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  In Gebhardt v. Nielsen, 879 F.3d 980 (9th Cir. 2018), the Ninth Circuit held that the general \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  right to familial companionship cannot form the basis of a due-process claim for a plaintiff in the \nS d nr\nee 17  United States challenging a government decision not to admit non-citizen family members located \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  outside the United States. The plaintiff in Gebhardt was a U.S. citizen who filed legal-permanent-\n19  resident petitions for his non-citizen wife and her three non-citizen children. Id. at 983. USCIS \n20  approved the petitions initially but then revoked them based on the plaintiff’s criminal conviction \n21  from years earlier. Id. at 983–84. The plaintiff challenged USCIS’s denials of his petition, arguing \n22  that (among other things) “USCIS, by denying his petitions, denied him the fundamental right to \n23  preserve the integrity of his family.” Id. at 988. The Ninth Circuit rejected that argument: \n   \n24 \n25 \n                                                 \n26 \n131 Compl. – ECF No. 1 at 42 (¶ 137). The plaintiffs do not bring a due-process claim on behalf of any \nbeneficiary children outside the United States. See id. \n27 \n132 Id. \n28 \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  56 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 51   Filed 12/10/18   Page 57 of 64\n \n \n1  Plaintiff’s theory is that he has a fundamental right to reside in the United States \nwith his non-citizen relatives. But that theory runs headlong into Congress’ plenary \n2 \npower over immigration. We acknowledge, of course, that individuals have a \nstrong interest in living with their family members. But that interest cannot be so \n3 \nfundamental that it overrides Congress’ plenary power in this domain. As we have \n4  said before, the generic right to live with family is “far removed” from the specific \nright to reside in the United States with non-citizen family members. . . . We \n5  therefore conclude that Plaintiff’s substantive due process claim is not colorable, \nand we decline to consider it further. \n6 \n7  Id. (citations omitted). So too here. The applicant-parent plaintiffs’ right to familial \n8  companionship for their non-citizen children located outside the United States does not give rise to \n9  a protected interest that can form the basis of a due-process claim.133 \n10  The plaintiffs’ authorities do not change this conclusion. The plaintiffs cite Justice Kennedy’s \n11  concurring opinion in Kerry v. Din, 135 S. Ct. 2128 (2015), for the proposition that they have a \n12  protected interest.134 In Din, the government denied an immigrant visa to the husband of a U.S. \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  citizen. Id. at 2131 (plurality op.). The husband was a citizen and resident of Afghanistan. Id. The \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  U.S.-citizen spouse challenged the denial because the government did not explain its reasons for \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  the denial. Id. at 2131–32. The Ninth Circuit reversed the district court’s order dismissing the case. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Id. The Supreme Court then reversed the Ninth Circuit. Id. at 2138. In his concurring opinion, \nS d nr\nee 17  Justice Kennedy assumed for the sake of argument that the U.S. citizen plaintiff in the United \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  States had a protected interest in the visa application of her non-U.S. citizen spouse and concluded \n19  that the government had provided her with sufficient due process in any event. Id. at 2139 \n20  (Kennedy, J., concurring). He expressly refrained from deciding the protected-interest issue, \n21 \n                                                 \n22 \n133 Gebhardt addresses the issue of the constitutional right to familial companionship specifically in \nthe context of a plaintiff located in the United States and his non-citizen family members located \n23 \noutside the United States who were not separated due to any government action. The other cases that \nthe plaintiffs cite are inapposite because they address familial companionship in the context of families \n24 \nwho were all originally present in the United States and were separated by the government’s actions. \nCf. Rosenbaum v. Washoe Cty., 663 F.3d 1071, 1074–75, 1079–80 (9th Cir. 2011) (family members \n25 \nwho were together in the United States were separated allegedly by the government’s actions); Kelson \nv. City of Springfield, 767 F.2d 651, 653–55 (9th Cir. 1985) (same); Morrison v. Jones, 607 F.2d 1269, \n26 \n1271–73, 1275 (9th Cir. 1979) (same). \n27  134 The Ninth Circuit has adopted Justice Kennedy’s concurring opinion as the binding opinion in Din. \nCardenas v. United States, 826 F.3d 1164, 1171–72 (9th Cir. 2016). \n28 \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  57 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 51   Filed 12/10/18   Page 58 of 64\n \n1  writing that “[t]oday’s disposition should not be interpreted as deciding whether a citizen has a \n2  protected liberty interest in the visa application of her alien spouse.” Id. That opinion thus does not \n3  bear on the issue here. \n4  The plaintiffs also cite Bustamante v. Mukasey, 531 F.3d 1059 (9th Cir. 2008), which involved \n5  a U.S.-citizen wife who brought a due-process claim after the government denied her non-citizen \n6  husband an immigrant visa. But the source of the protected interest at issue there was not a general \n7  constitutional liberty interest in familial companionship. Instead, the protected interest was \n8  statutory: a U.S. citizen’s statutorily created entitlement to an immigration visa for his or her \n9  spouse. See Ching v. Mayorkas, 725 F.3d 1149, 1155–56 (9th Cir. 2013) (“[G]rant of an I-130 \n10  petition for immediate relative status is a nondiscretionary decision. Immediate relative status for \n11  an alien spouse is a right to which citizen applicants are entitled as long as the petitioner and \n12  spouse beneficiary meet the statutory and regulatory requirements for eligibility. This protected \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  interest is entitled to the protections of due process.”) (citing Bustamante, 531 F.3d at 1061–62, \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  and other authorities). Because the plaintiff in Bustamante satisfied the threshold requirement of \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  having a protected interest in a visa for her husband, the Ninth Circuit addressed the second \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  question: whether the government had deprived her of that interest without sufficient procedural \nS d nr\nee 17  protections. Bustamante, 531 F.3d at 1062. Bustamante thus does not bear on the question here: \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  whether the applicant-parent plaintiffs have a protected interest. \n19  By contrast to the spousal immigrant visas in Bustamante, there is no statutorily created \n20  protected interest in parole. Wong, 373 F.3d at 968 (“The INA does not create any liberty interest \n21  in temporary parole that is protected by the Fifth Amendment. Rather, the statute makes clear that \n22  whether and for how long temporary parole is granted are matters entirely within the discretion of \n23  the [Secretary of Homeland Security].”); Munoz v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 950, 954 (9th Cir. 2003) \n24  (“Since discretionary relief is a privilege created by Congress, denial of such relief cannot violate \n25  a substantive interest protected by the Due Process Clause.”); Regents II, 298 F. Supp. 3d at 1310 \n26  (“Our court of appeals has accordingly held there is no protected interest in temporary parole, \n27  since such relief is ‘entirely within the discretion of the [Secretary of Homeland Security].’ . . . \n28  [This] foreclose[s] any argument that plaintiffs have a protected interest in . . . advance parole[.]”) \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  58 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 51   Filed 12/10/18   Page 59 of 64\n \n1  (citing Wong, 373 F.3d at 967–68). And Gebhardt forecloses the argument that a general \n2  constitutional right to familial companionship gives rise to a protected interest in this context. \n3  Because the plaintiffs have not made a threshold showing that they have a protected liberty or \n4  property interest, the court dismisses their due-process claim. \n5   \n6  4.  Equal Protection \n7  The plaintiffs bring a claim on behalf of the plaintiffs in the United States for violation of \n8  equal protection.135 \n9  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment incorporates a guarantee of equal protection \n10  and prohibits unjustified discrimination by federal actors. United States v. Navarro, 800 F.3d \n11  1104, 1112 n.6 (9th Cir. 2015) (citing Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 498–99 (1954)). Courts \n12  assess equal-protection claims against federal actors under the Fifth Amendment in the same way \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  that they assess equal-protection claims against state actors under the Fourteenth Amendment. Id. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  (citing Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S. 636, 638 n.2 (1975)). The plaintiffs argue that the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  government’s termination of the CAM Parole Program and its mass-rescission of conditional \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  approvals of parole violate equal protection because the decisions were substantially motivated by \nS d nr\nee 17  discriminatory intent and animus against Latinos, as evidenced by President Trump’s history of \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  purported slurs and epithets toward Latinos.136 \n19  The termination of the CAM Parole Program and the rescission of conditional approvals of \n20  parole affect the admission of foreign nationals into the United States.137 As the Supreme Court \n21  held in Trump v. Hawaii, “a circumscribed inquiry applies to any constitutional claim concerning \n22  the entry of foreign nationals.” Trump, 138 S. Ct. at 2420 n.5. \n23 \n24                                                   \n135 Compl. – ECF No. 1 at 43 (Count IV header). The plaintiffs do not bring an equal-protection claim \n25  on behalf of any beneficiary children outside the United States. See id. \n136 Id. (¶¶ 144–45). \n26 \n137 The government did not rescind parole for beneficiaries who were in the United States at the time it \n27  terminated the CAM Parole Program. See Termination of the Central American Minors Parole \nProgram, 82 Fed. Reg. at 38,927. \n28 \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  59 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 51   Filed 12/10/18   Page 60 of 64\n \n1  The Trump case is instructive here. That case involved a challenge to the government’s so-\n2  called “travel ban,” a presidential proclamation limiting entry by foreign nationals from eight \n3  countries; most of the countries are predominately Muslim. Trump, 138 S. Ct. at 2405. The \n4  plaintiffs there argued that the primary purpose of the proclamation was to discriminate against \n5  Muslims. Id. at 2417. In support of their discrimination claims and as evidence of religious bias \n6  against Muslims, the plaintiffs cited purportedly anti-Muslim statements that President Trump \n7  made. Id. \n8  In rejecting the plaintiffs’ challenge, the Supreme Court wrote that “[f]or more than a century, \n9  this Court has recognized that the admission and exclusion of foreign nationals is a ‘fundamental \n10  sovereign attribute exercised by the Government’s political departments largely immune from \n11  judicial control.’” Trump, 138 S. Ct. at 2418 (quoting Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U.S. 787, 792 (1977)). \n12  The Court acknowledged that “although foreign nationals seeking admission have no \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  constitutional right to entry, this Court has engaged in a circumscribed judicial inquiry when the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  denial of a visa allegedly burdens the constitutional rights of a U.S. citizen.” Id. at 2419. “But [the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Court] limited [its] review to whether the Executive gave a ‘facially legitimate and bona fide’ \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  reason for its action.” Id. (quoting Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753, 769 (1972)). “Given the \nS d nr\nee 17  authority of the political branches over admission, [the Court] held that ‘when the Executive \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  exercises this delegated power negatively on the basis of a facially legitimate and bona fide \n19  reason, the courts will neither look behind the exercise of that discretion, nor test it by balancing \n20  its justification’ against the asserted constitutional interests of U.S. citizens.” Id. (internal brackets \n21  omitted) (quoting Kleindienst, 408 U.S. at 770). \n22  The test that the Supreme Court applied in evaluating the presidential proclamation was \n23  whether “it is impossible to ‘discern a relationship to legitimate state interests’” and “the policy is \n24  ‘inexplicable by anything but animus.’” Id. at 2420–21. The Court held that the proclamation was \n25  premised on legitimate purposes, namely, “preventing entry of [foreign] nationals who cannot be \n26  adequately vetted and inducing other nations to improve their practices.” Id. at 2421. The Court \n27  upheld the proclamation as “a facially neutral policy denying certain foreign nationals the \n28  privilege of admission.” Id. at 2423. \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  60 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 51   Filed 12/10/18   Page 61 of 64\n \n1  While the Court considered President Trump’s statements about Muslims, see id. at 2420, it \n2  declined to credit the plaintiffs’ argument that President Trump’s statements supported a \n3  constitutional challenge to the proclamation: \n4  The entry suspension is an act that is well within executive authority and could \nhave been taken by any other President — the only question is evaluating the \n5 \nactions of this particular President in promulgating an otherwise valid \nProclamation. . . . [T]he Government has set forth a sufficient national security \n6 \njustification to survive rational basis review. We express no view on the soundness \n7  of the policy. We simply hold today that plaintiffs have not demonstrated a \nlikelihood of success on the merits of their constitutional claim. \n8 \n9  Id. at 2423. \n10  The plaintiffs’ challenge here to the termination of the CAM Parole Program is analogous to \n11  the Trump plaintiffs’ challenge to the presidential proclamation. In both cases, plaintiffs residing \n12  in the United States challenge government policies that prevent their foreign relatives from \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  entering the United States.138 In both cases, “[i]t cannot be said that it is impossible to ‘discern a \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  relationship to legitimate state interests’ or that the policy is ‘inexplicable by anything but \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  animus.’” Cf. Trump, 138 S. Ct. at 2420–21. The government’s view is that parole should be used \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  “sparingly and only in individual cases” and that “[t]he practice of granting parole to certain aliens \nS d nr\nee 17  in pre-designated categories in order to create immigration programs not established by Congress, \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  has contributed to a border security crisis, undermined the integrity of the immigration laws and \n19  the parole process, and created an incentive for additional illegal immigration.”139 These are \n20  facially legitimate and bona fide reasons for terminating the CAM Parole Program. Cf. Jeanty v. \n21  Bulger, 204 F. Supp. 2d 1366, 1377–78, 1381 (S.D. Fla. 2002) (finding that discouraging mass \n22  migration of Haitians to the United States by applying parole criteria in a more restrictive manner \n23  was a “facially legitimate and bona fide reason[]” for changing from a policy of favoring parole \n24 \n                                                 \n138 While the plaintiffs here are bringing an equal-protection claim under the Fifth Amendment, and \n25 \nthe plaintiffs in Trump brought an Establishment Clause claim under the First Amendment, the \nSupreme Court “ha[s] reaffirmed and applied its deferential standard of review across different \n26 \ncontexts and constitutional claims.” Trump, 138 S. Ct. at 2419. \n27  139 See Kelly Memo – ECF No. 33-5 at 10 (AR000030); accord Exec. Order 13,767, 82 Fed.

Moise v. Bulger, 321 F.3d 1336 (11th Cir. 2003). Because the government has \n3  facially legitimate and bona fide reasons for terminating the CAM Parole Program, here, as in \n4  Trump, the court cannot “look behind the exercise of that discretion, nor test it by balancing its \n5  justification’ against the asserted [equal-protection] constitutional interests of [the plaintiffs].” Cf. \n6  Trump, 138 S. Ct. at 2419 (quoting Kleindienst, 408 U.S. at 770).140 \n7  Citing cases that do not involve the admission of foreign nationals into the United States, the \n8  plaintiffs argue that the court should infer from President Trump’s anti-Latino statements that the \n9  government acted with discriminatory animus and thus violated their equal-protection rights. Their \n10  arguments might carry more weight in the context of a program like the DACA or TPS programs \n11  that involve only individuals located in the United States. Cf. Regents III, 908 F.3d at 518–20 \n12  (plaintiffs could plausibly plead an equal-protection that the government’s decision to terminate \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  the DACA program was based on racial animus based on President Trump’s anti-Latino \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  statements); Ramos I, 321 F. Supp. 3d at 1131–32 (same re the TPS program); Ramos II, __ F. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Supp. 3d __, 2018 WL 4778285, at *16–21 (same re the TPS program). But unlike the DACA or \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  TPS programs, the CAM Parole Program involves the admission of foreign nationals presently \nS d nr\nee 17  outside the United States into the United States, and the court’s review of constitutional equal-\nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  protection claims thus is circumscribed. Trump, 138 S. Ct. at 2418–20 & n.5; cf. Regents III, 908 \n19  F.3d at 520 (“[DACA] differs from [Trump v.] Hawaii in several potentially important respects, \n20 \n                                                 \n140 The plaintiffs argue that these reasons do not match the government’s actions in terminating the \n21 \nCAM Parole Program because, they allege, the Program operated on a case-by-case basis. Pls. Mot. to \nDismiss Opp’n – ECF No. 34 at 24. But the plaintiffs do not plead that the Program granted parole \n22 \n“sparingly,” that it granted parole “only in individual cases,” or that it did not “grant[] parole to certain \naliens in pre-designated categories in order to create immigration programs not established by \n23 \nCongress.” Contrary to the plaintiffs’ claims, there is no mismatch between the government’s view \nthat parole should be granted sparingly and not used to create an immigration program not established \n24 \nby Congress and its decision to terminate the CAM Parole Program. \n25    The plaintiffs also try to distinguish Trump by arguing that it was decided on a preliminary-injunction \nmotion, not a motion to dismiss. Pls. Mot. to Dismiss Opp’n – ECF No. 34 at 23–24. They cite no \n26  authorities to support their argument that a court cannot decide the question of whether the government \nhas “facially legitimate and bona fide reasons” on a motion to dismiss. Cf., e.g., Bustamante, 531 F.3d \n27  at 1062–63 (evaluating whether government had a “facially legitimate and bona fide reason” for \ndenying visa on a motion to dismiss). \n28 \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  62 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 51   Filed 12/10/18   Page 63 of 64\n \n1  including the physical location of the plaintiffs within the geographic United States”) (citing \n2  Lopez-Valenzuela v.

The plaintiffs’ general equal-protection cases are inapposite \n9  here. \n10  The government has facially legitimate and bona fide reasons for terminating the CAM Parole \n11  Program. Because the court cannot test those reasons by balancing them against the plaintiffs’ \n12  constitutional interests, cf. Trump, 138 S.

Equitable Estoppel \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  The parties dispute whether equitable estoppel can be pleaded as an affirmative claim or \nS de nre 17  whether it is only an affirmative defense.141 The court need not resolve this question because the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  plaintiffs have not pleaded the elements of equitable estoppel as either a claim or defense. \n19  Equitable estoppel requires that (among other things) the government engaged in “affirmative \n20  misconduct,” which the Ninth Circuit has defined to mean a “deliberate lie” or “a pattern of false \n21  promises.” Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176, 1184 (9th Cir. 2001) (en banc) (citing \n22  Mukherjee v. INS, 793 F.2d 1006, 1008 (9th Cir. 1986)). “Negligently providing misinformation to \n23  an alien does not meet this definition” and thus is insufficient to plead equitable estoppel. Id. \n24 \n25                                                   \n141 Compare Defs. Mot. to Dismiss – ECF No. 32 at 25 (“‘Equitable Estoppel is not an affirmative \n26  claim, but rather an affirmative defense.’”) (quoting Johnson v. Mazza, No. 2:15-cv-09183-ODW(AS), \n2016 WL 5842186, at *4 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 4, 2016)) with Pls. Mot. to Dismiss Opp’n – ECF No. 34 at \n27  24 (“Ninth Circuit precedent recognizes an affirmative cause of action for equitable estoppel.”) (citing \nWatkins v. U.S. Army, 875 F.2d 699 (9th Cir. 1989) (en banc)). \n28 \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  63 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 51   Filed 12/10/18   Page 64 of 64\n \n1  The plaintiffs allege that during the time between January and August 2017, when the \n2  government was purportedly engaged in a “secret shutdown” of the CAM Parole Program, \n3  (1) government web pages continued to represent that the Program was active and that participants \n4  should not delay in paying for plane tickets,142 and (2) IOM contacted participants to solicit and \n5  accept payments for plane tickets.143 This does not plead a deliberate lie or a pattern of false \n6  promises on the part of the government, as opposed to (for example) the government’s negligently \n7  failing to update its websites and inform IOM of the purported shutdown (or IOM’s not getting the \n8  message and inadvertently providing participants with incorrect information). The plaintiffs have \n9  not pleaded that the government engaged in a deliberate lie or a pattern of false promises, and the \n10  court thus dismisses their equitable-estoppel claim. \n11   \n12  CONCLUSION \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  The court grants in part and denies in part the defendants’ motion to dismiss. The court denies \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  the motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ APA claims as they relate to the government’s mass-\ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  rescinding conditional approvals of parole made under the CAM Parole Program. In all other \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  respects, the court grants the defendants’ motion to dismiss.144 \nS d nr\nee 17   \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n19  Dated: December 10, 2018 \n20  ______________________________________ \nLAUREL BEELER \n21 \nUnited States Magistrate Judge \n22 \n23 \n24 \n                                                 \n25  142 Compl. – ECF No. 1 at 21–22 (¶¶ 57–60). \n143 Id. at 20 (¶¶ 54–55). \n26 \n144 Because the court grants the defendants’ motion to dismiss with respect to all claims other than a \n27  portion of the APA claims and President Trump is not named as a defendant in the APA claims, the \ncourt does not address the defendants’ arguments regarding naming the president as a defendant. \n28 \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  64 ",

The Parties will jointly move the Court to convert its PI Order (ECF No. 77) into a permanent \n2  injunction, which the Court will have continuing jurisdiction to enforce. \n3  2.  USCIS agrees to abandon its reconsideration process of its decision to rescind conditional \n4  approvals for parole for CAM beneficiaries (ECF No. 76), and USCIS agrees not to initiate any new \n5  process to reconsider its decision to rescind conditional approvals for parole for CAM beneficiaries who \n6  were conditionally approved at the time the program was terminated.   \n7  3.  The Parties agree to waive their rights to appeal the Court’s Orders on Plaintiffs’ motion for \n8  preliminary injunction and Defendants’ motion to dismiss (ECF Nos. 51, 77). \n9  4.  The Parties agree to waive their rights to move for fees and costs.  The Parties will bear their \n10  own attorneys’ fees and costs.  \n11  5.  USCIS agrees to process the approximately 2700 individuals who were conditionally \n12  approved for parole prior to the CAM Parole program’s termination and then issued rescission notices, \n13  as well as any later born children who are classified as add-ons, pursuant to the Court’s PI Order (ECF \n14  No. 77).  Specifically, USCIS agrees that the conditionally approved beneficiaries shall be processed \n15  pursuant to the CAM policies, guidance, and practices in effect on January 1, 2017.  USCIS agrees that \n16  pursuant to such CAM policies, guidance, and practices, beneficiaries are eligible for CAM processing \n17  so long as they were under 21 years old as of the date on which their Affidavit of Relationship forms \n18  were filed, regardless of their age at the time of parole into the United States.  USCIS shall notify CBP \n19  of the resumption of CAM parole processing and the timeframe for the first beneficiaries arriving at U.S. \n20  ports of entry.  The Parties anticipate that as a result of this agreement, most conditionally approved \n21  beneficiaries will be paroled into the United States, so long as they and their U.S.-based parents continue \n22  to remain eligible, are able to pay the associated costs for medical exams and travel, and desire parole. \n23  6.  Given the use of the same CAM program policies, guidance and practice as prior to the \n24  termination of the program, individuals who previously had conditional approval but whose \n25  circumstances have changed such that they no longer meet the program requirements will not be eligible \n26  for parole, notwithstanding this agreement, such as if their parent in the U.S. is no longer lawfully \n27  present or if a child is no longer eligible due to a legal marriage.   \n28  BINDING MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT; [PROPOSED] ORDER \nCase No. 18-CV-03539 LB \n      3 \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 90   Filed 04/12/19   Page 4 of 8\n \n \n \n1  7.  With respect to the two Plaintiff families whose beneficiaries had not yet received a decision \n2  on their CAM applications when USCIS terminated the CAM Parole program—specifically, the \n3  beneficiaries are (1) A.B.’s son; (2) A.B.’s son’s child; (3) H.F.; (4) A.F.; and (5) H.F. and A.F.’s \n4  mother—these beneficiaries shall have their cases re-opened and be considered for parole for purposes \n5  of this settlement.  These two Plaintiff families are the exception—otherwise this settlement only covers \n6  individuals who were conditionally approved for parole prior to the termination of the CAM Parole \n7  program and then issued rescission notices from USCIS. \n8  8.  By April 18, 2019, USCIS agrees to file with the Court a more detailed plan for CAM \n9  processing with benchmarks for assessing compliance, which shall not conflict with this Memorandum \n10  of Agreement and shall contain the following provisions: \n11  a. A plan for providing individualized notice to U.S.-based parents and in-country \n12  beneficiaries regarding Defendants’ resumption of CAM Parole processing, and such notice shall \n13  remind applicants and beneficiaries that there are costs for medical exams and travel which are \n14  borne by applicants. \n15  b. A plan for accepting updated contact information from U.S.-based parents and \n16  beneficiaries, including by establishing an email address by which U.S.-based parents, \n17  beneficiaries and/or their attorney or accredited representatives can inquire whether they are \n18  eligible for resumed CAM processing.  USCIS will respond to such queries in a reasonable \n19  amount of time, while maintaining confidentiality.  The parties will continue to discuss ways to \n20  develop and improve communication channels between USCIS and program participants. \n21  9.  Defendants will report in writing to the Court on their progress in implementing this \n22  agreement beginning on July 1, 2019 (the first quarterly report) and every three months thereafter until \n23  processing is complete (i.e., until the last beneficiary’s case is adjudicated and all approved beneficiaries \n24  travel).  Subject to revisions to the extent necessary to track the categories of information Defendants \n25  collect, the reports to the Court are expected to include the following numbers once initially:  \n26  •             The number of parents who appear to be in the US lawfully.  \n27  •             The number of parents for whom Defendants cannot confirm lawful presence (and who \n28  BINDING MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT; [PROPOSED] ORDER \nCase No. 18-CV-03539 LB \n      4 \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 90   Filed 04/12/19   Page 5 of 8\n \n \n \n1  will receive requests to provide such evidence within 87 days).  In addition, with respect to the U.S.-\n2  based parents for whom Defendants cannot confirm lawful presence, Defendants would later make a \n3  one-time report of the number of parents for whom Defendants were later able to confirm lawful \n4  presence. \n5  •             The number of beneficiaries who require fingerprint collection (i.e. the number of \n6  beneficiaries who are now at least 13 ½ and who hadn’t had their fingerprints collected previously for \n7  CAM).  \n8  Defendants would then provide the following numbers every three months: \n9  A.            The number of beneficiaries who submitted fingerprints after their case was reopened;  \n10  B.            The number of beneficiaries for whom a medical exam is scheduled (*Note, these will \n11  be beneficiaries with a scheduled appointment and who have not yet attended their appointment);  \n12  C.            The number of beneficiaries for whom USCIS has received the medical exam results; \n13  D.            The number of beneficiaries who have a pending request for a re-interview;  \n14  E.            The number of beneficiaries who completed a re-interview;   \n15  F.            The number of beneficiaries for whom USCIS authorized parole; \n16  G.            The number of beneficiaries for whom USCIS denied parole; and \n17  H.            The number of beneficiaries who traveled to the United States. \n18  Defendants would also report in the third quarterly report (1) the number of beneficiaries for whom the \n19  U.S.-based parent did not respond to USCIS contact efforts and (2) the number of beneficiaries who did \n20  not respond to USCIS contact efforts.  With respect to this population who did not respond to \n21  Defendants’ contact efforts, the Parties shall meet and confer after the third quarterly report.   \n22  10.  The signatories hereto represent that they have authority, whether on behalf of the \n23  Defendants or on behalf of their clients, to enter into this Memorandum of Agreement.  The \n24  Memorandum of Agreement is to be construed under federal law as an agreement made in and to be \n25  performed in the United States. \n26  11. This Memorandum of Agreement is intended to be binding as a contract between the Parties \n27  and shall be enforceable and admissible in any proceeding, notwithstanding any settlement or mediation \n28  BINDING MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT; [PROPOSED] ORDER \nCase No. 18-CV-03539 LB \n      5 \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 90   Filed 04/12/19   Page 6 of 8\n \n \n \n1  privilege.

The submitted timeline \nrepresented the fastest estimated process assuming all external parties met the estimated milestones, but will be \nupdated as more information becomes available.  The estimated timeline is also based on previous CAM parole \nadjudications, and does not account for unforeseen differences.  There are several rate-limiting steps upon \nwhich timeframes are dependent, including, most importantly, re-establishment/updating of the prior contract \nwith IOM for in-country assistance and contracting with panel physicians to update medical exams, Further, \nUSCIS previously made the decision to restructure its International Operations (IO) division including closing \ncertain overseas offices (but has recently determined that the El Salvador, Mexico City and Guatemala offices \nwill remain open); it is unknown at this time how this will impact timeframes or available resources. \n \nTimeline Updates \nSteps: Estimated timelines are approximate and may shift depending on unforeseen factors as well as those \nnoted above. \n \nFurther to paragraph 8 of the MOA, USCIS notes the following progress on the Compliance Plan.  For \nreference, USCIS has reproduced the tasks, estimated timeline and comments from the Compliance Plan, and \nprovided a status update and date of completion on each tasking. \n \nStatus updates  \nCompliance Plan filed on  for October 1, 2019 Parole Status \n April 18, 2019   Report \n   \nEstimated  \nActual \nCompletion \nTask  Timeline   Comments  Completion Date  Comments \nUSCIS will verify  March 21  Completed initial  Completed on May 20.

See, e.g., In re Arrabally, 25 I. & N. \nDec. 771, 777 n.5 (B.I.A. 2012). \n28 \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 77   Filed 03/01/19   Page 2 of 30\n \n1  their children and other qualifying family members in three countries — Honduras, Guatemala, \n2  and El Salvador, collectively known as the “Northern Triangle” — into the United States. A \n3  Program goal was to discourage children from making the long and dangerous journey from the \n4  Northern Triangle to the United States to try to reunite with their parents. The Program sought to \n5  achieve this goal by allowing applicant parents to apply for their beneficiary children while the \n6  children remained in their original countries.2 \n7  The CAM Program had two components: a refugee component and a parole component. U.S. \n8  Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”), an agency within the U.S. Department of \n9  Homeland Security (“DHS”), first evaluated beneficiaries to see if they qualified for refugee status \n10  (which, among other things, requires persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution “on \n11  account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political \n12  opinion”). If the beneficiaries qualified, USCIS referred them for approval as refugees under the \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  CAM Refugee Program. If they did not qualify, USCIS automatically considered them for parole \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  into the United States under the CAM Parole Program. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  In January 2017, following a change in presidential administrations, President Donald Trump \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  issued an Executive Order that (among other things) directed the Secretary of Homeland Security \nS d nr\nee 17  to “take all appropriate action” to ensure that DHS exercised its parole authority “only on a case-\nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  by-case basis” and “only when an individual demonstrates urgent humanitarian reasons or a \n19  significant public benefit derived from such parole.” Exec. Order 13,767 § 11(d), 82 Fed. Reg. \n20  8793, 8796 (2017). Beginning in January or February 2017, DHS stopped processing CAM \n21  Program applications — including the applications for beneficiaries who had been conditionally \n22  approved for parole and were awaiting processing to finalize their arrangements to travel to the \n23  United States — and began a review of the CAM Parole Program.

This order uses “applicant” to refer to the parents present in the United \n27  States, “beneficiary” to refer to the children or qualifying family members in the Northern Triangle \ncountries, and “participant” to refer to applicants and beneficiaries.  \n28 \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  2 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 77   Filed 03/01/19   Page 3 of 30\n \n1  announced that it was terminating the CAM Parole Program. It also announced that it was \n2  rescinding the decisions it had previously made under the Program for 2,714 beneficiaries whom it \n3  had conditionally approved for parole but who had not yet traveled to the United States. \n4  The plaintiffs in this case — applicant parents lawfully residing in the United States who \n5  applied to the CAM Program, their beneficiary children in Northern Triangle countries, and the \n6  nonprofit immigrant-rights organization CASA — filed this putative class-action lawsuit, bringing \n7  claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), the Due Process Clause, and the equal-\n8  protection component of the Due Process Clause, and a claim for equitable estoppel. The claims \n9  challenge as unlawful DHS’s termination of the CAM Parole Program and its decision to rescind \n10  en masse its prior decisions to conditionally approve parole for the 2,714 beneficiaries (including \n11  named beneficiary-children plaintiffs in this case). \n12  The defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs’ claims. On December 10, 2018, the court \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion to dismiss. S.A. v. Trump, __ F.

Id. at *32–33. The court held that DHS acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it \n20  failed to take into account and address the serious reliance interests of participants who were \n21  conditionally approved for parole when it mass-rescinded those approvals. Id. \n22  The plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction (1) enjoining DHS from terminating the \n23  CAM Parole Program and (2) vacating DHS’s mass-rescission of conditional approvals of parole. \n24  With respect to the second request, the plaintiffs do not seek an injunction mandating that DHS \n25  admit any particular Program beneficiary into the United States. Instead, they seek only an order \n26 \n                                                 \n27  3 Order – ECF No. 51.

Because the court \n8  dismissed the plaintiffs’ claims challenging the termination of the CAM Parole Program going \n9  forward, it also denies the plaintiffs’ motion to enjoin DHS from terminating the Program going \n10  forward.

The process was as follows. \n9  First, a parent lawfully residing in the United States had to file an application with the \n10  assistance of a “resettlement agency” (a nonprofit organization partially funded by the government \n11  to welcome refugees into the country) and provide proof of identity, proof of legal status in the \n12  United States, and a passport photo of the beneficiary child.9 Second, the International \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Organization for Migration (“IOM”) — the intergovernmental organization that the State \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Department contracted to run its Resettlement Support Center in Latin America — invited the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  child to come to the capital of the country where the child was located so that IOM could \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  interview the child, take the child’s biometric data and background information, prepare a case \nS de nre 17  file, and initiate security checks.10 Third, USCIS verified the relationship between parent and child \nth\nintr\nUoN 18  through documentary evidence and DNA tests.11 (The parent had to pay for DNA testing, but \n19  USCIS reimbursed the parent if the testing confirmed a parent-child relationship.12) Fourth, \n20  USCIS conducted an interview with the child in the country capital.13 Fifth, after confirming \n21 \n                                                 \n22  7 Id.; accord 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42) (defining “refugee” as requiring, among other things, persecution \nor a well-founded fear of persecution “on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a \n23  particular social group, or political opinion”). \n8 Compl. – ECF No. 1 at 12–13 (¶ 38). \n24 \n9 Id. at 14 (¶ 42(a)). \n25 \n10 Id.

Broadly speaking, the travel-ban cases involved presidential executive \n8  orders limiting immigrant and non-immigrant entry into the United States from several \n9  enumerated countries (most of which are predominately Muslim). In one line of cases, an \n10  individual U.S. citizen of Egyptian descent, Ismail Elshikh (together with the State of Hawaii) \n11  brought a suit to challenge the executive orders. Dr. Elshikh alleged that the second of these \n12  executive orders (“EO-2”) prevented his mother-in-law, a Syrian national residing in Syria, from \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  obtaining a visa to travel to the United States to reunite with their shared family. Hawaii v. Trump, \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  859 F.3d 741, 762 (9th Cir. 2017) (Trump I), stay granted in part and denied in part, Trump v. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Int’l Refugee Assistance Project, 137 S. Ct. 2080 (2017) (Trump II), vacated as moot, Trump v. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 377 (2017) (Trump III). Dr. Elshikh’s mother-in-law had not visited the United \nS d nr\nee 17  States for over ten years (long before EO-2 was issued), and hence her separation from her family \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  members had not been directly caused by the executive order. See id. The Ninth Circuit \n19 \n                                                                                                                                                                \n20 \ncountries to warrant awarding them parole.

The defendants do not meaningfully contest those DHS \n24 \ndeterminations either. See 2017 RTQ – ECF No. 33-9 at 6 (AR000049) (DHS expressly stating that in \nterminating the CAM Parole Program, it was not determining that children were no longer in danger). \n25 \n34 Defs.

Id. at 782–83. The Ninth Circuit thus implicitly held that the causal-connection \n4  requirement was satisfied in that case. On a petition for a writ of certiorari, the Supreme Court \n5  considered the Ninth Circuit’s injunction and left it in place with respect to individuals in the \n6  United States and family members abroad. Trump II, 137 S. Ct. at 2087.35 The Supreme Court did \n7  not stay or set aside the Ninth Circuit’s injunction for failure to satisfy a causal-connection \n8  requirement. See id. \n9  The Supreme Court subsequently vacated the Ninth Circuit’s order as moot after the \n10  government rescinded EO-2 and replaced it with a new executive order (“EO-3”). Trump III, 138 \n11  S. Ct. 377. On Dr. Elshikh’s (and Hawaii’s) renewed challenge to EO-3, the Ninth Circuit once \n12  again held that Dr. Elshikh made a showing of irreparable harm warranting an injunction. Hawaii \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  v. Trump, 878 F.3d 662, 698–99 (9th Cir. 2017) (Trump IV), rev’d, Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  2392 (2018) (Trump V). The Ninth Circuit thus implicitly reaffirmed that the causal-connection \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  requirement was satisfied in that case. (The Supreme Court ultimately reversed Trump IV on the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  issue of whether the plaintiffs had shown a likelihood of success on the merits, without addressing \nS d nr\nee 17  the issue of irreparable harm or any causal-connection requirement. Trump V, 138 S. Ct. at 2423.) \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  While the Ninth Circuit’s decisions in Trump I and Trump IV were ultimately vacated or \n19  reversed (on grounds unrelated to the irreparable-harm prong), the decisions nonetheless provide \n20  insight into the application of the causal-connection requirement here. See generally Doe v. \n21  Trump, 288 F. Supp. 3d 1045, 1069 n.15 (W.D. Wash. 2017) (Doe I) (“[Trump v.] Hawaii I . . . \n22  remains persuasive authority despite the Supreme Court’s vacatur.”) (citing Orhorhaghe v.

Like this case, those cases involved a U.S. resident plaintiff separated from family members \n25 \n26                                                   \n35 The Supreme Court stayed the injunction with respect to foreign nationals who did not have a \n27  “credible claim” of a “bona fide relationship” with a person or entity in the United States.

As in this case, in those cases the government was not the \n2  immediate direct cause of the familial separation, which long predated the government’s actions. \n3  The Ninth Circuit nonetheless affirmed injunctions in those cases, thereby implicitly holding that \n4  there was a sufficient causal connection in those cases between the alleged irreparable harm \n5  (prolonged familial separation) and the activity to be enjoined (the government’s travel ban \n6  preventing family members from traveling to the United States) to warrant injunctive relief. The \n7  court here similarly finds that there is a sufficient causal connection between alleged irreparable \n8  harm (prolonged familial separation and physical danger to the beneficiary-children plaintiffs) and \n9  the activity to be enjoined (the government’s mass-rescission of beneficiaries’ conditional parole \n10  into the United States). Cf. Trump I, 859 F.3d at 782–83; Trump IV, 878 F.3d at 698–99; see Nat’l \n11  Wildlife, 886 F.3d at 819 (“[A] plaintiff ‘need not further show that the action sought to be \n12  enjoined is the exclusive cause of the injury.’ . . . Irreparable harm may be caused by activities \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  broader than those that plaintiffs seek to enjoin.”) (quoting M.R., 697 F.3d at 728). \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  The defendants also argue that even if the court were to vacate DHS’s mass-rescission of \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  conditional parole, DHS would retain discretion whether to ultimately grant or deny parole to any \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  conditionally approved beneficiary. Whether DHS retains discretion or whether CAM Parole \nS d nr\nee 17  Program participants lack an enforceable “right” to parole in any individual case does not vitiate \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  the causal connection or render injunctive relief inappropriate.

As the Ninth Circuit has recognized, “[i]t is not an abuse of \n4  discretion for a court to issue an injunction that does not completely prevent the irreparable harm \n5  that it identifies.” Nat’l Wildlife, 886 F.3d at 822.36 \n6  2.2.2  CASA \n7  2.2.2.1  Harm \n8  The Ninth Circuit has recognized that an organizational plaintiff’s suffering “ongoing harms to \n9  [its] organizational missions” can constitute irreparable harm.

National Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7 (2008). The \nplaintiffs there sought to enjoin the Navy from conducting sonar exercises that the plaintiffs alleged \n19 \nharmed marine mammals. Id. at 16–17. The plaintiffs’ ultimate legal claims there, however, were that \nthe Navy had to prepare an environmental-impact statement (“EIS”), not that it had to stop conducting \n20 \nsonar exercises. Id. at 32. The portion of the Winter opinion that the defendants cite is dictum about \nwhat the appropriate relief after a final judgment might be and how a permanent injunction barring \n21 \nsonar exercises (as opposed to an injunction tailored to the preparation of an EIS) might be an abuse of \ndiscretion. Id. at 32–33. This case does not address the causal-connection requirement for irreparable \n22 \nharm on a preliminary injunction. The defendants also cite Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U.S. 787, 792 (1977), to \nargue that the exclusion of aliens is a “fundamental sovereign attribute exercised by the Government’s \n23 \npolitical departments largely immune from judicial control,” and Bruker v. City of New York, No. \n93Civ.3848(MGC) (HBP), 2003 WL 256801, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 4, 2003), and Gebhardt v. Nielsen, \n24 \n879 F.3d 980, 988 (9th Cir. 2018), to argue that the plaintiffs have no due-process right to reunite with \ntheir families. These arguments go to the merits of the plaintiffs’ claims, not the separate issue of \n25 \nirreparable harm and its attendant causal-connection requirement. Cf. Leiva-Perez, 640 F.3d at 969 \n(consideration of irreparable harm should be “determined apart from merits issues”). \n26 \n37 While purely monetary harm is not normally considered “irreparable,” it may be irreparable in \n27  certain contexts, including in APA cases because the APA does not permit recovery of monetary \ndamages. Azar, 911 F.3d at 581 (citing 5 U.S.C. § 702). \n28 \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  15 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 77   Filed 03/01/19   Page 16 of 30\n \n1  argued that a government rule that makes anyone who crosses the U.S. southern border \n2  somewhere other than at a designated point of entry ineligible for asylum, inflicted irreparable \n3  harm on the organizations.

Id. at *13 (citing \n7  Valle del Sol, 732 F.3d at 1029). Similarly, in Doe I, 288 F. Supp. 3d 1045, two organizations that \n8  provide services to and help resettle refugees in the United States argued that an executive order \n9  and agency memo suspending certain derivative refugees from entering the United States inflicted \n10  irreparable harm on them because resources that the organizations had devoted to resettling \n11  refugees would be wasted, and the organizations would have to divert resources to address fears \n12  raised by the executive order and agency memo, cancel established programs, lose relationships \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  and goodwill with volunteers and community partners, and lay off employees. Id. at 1061–62, \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  1066.

East Bay II, __ F. \n4  Supp. 3d __, 2018 WL 6660080, at *13 (issuing preliminary injunction based on showing of \n5  ongoing harms to organizational missions, including ongoing diversion of resources to find \n6  alternatives to asylum). \n7  *  *  * \n8  The plaintiffs have satisfied the second preliminary-injunction factor. \n9   \n10  3.

The plaintiffs challenge not just DHS’s formal announcement in August 2017 that it was \n24  mass-rescinding conditional approvals of parole but also DHS’s decision in January or February \n25 \n                                                 \n26  48 The plaintiffs there also brought due-process and equal-protection claims and a claim for equitable \nestoppel, Regents I, 279 F. Supp. 3d at 1027–28, but the district court relied on only the APA claims in \n27  issuing a preliminary injunction, see id. at 1037–46; accord Regents II, 908 F.3d at 511 (affirming \npreliminary injunction on the basis of district court’s “APA merits holding”). \n28 \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  22 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 77   Filed 03/01/19   Page 23 of 30\n \n1  2017 to stop processing beneficiaries conditionally approved for parole without announcing that it \n2  was doing so (which the plaintiffs characterize as a “secret shutdown”).49 Given this context, the \n3  status quo ante litem is the point before January or February 2017 when DHS was still processing \n4  conditionally approved beneficiaries.50 Cf. GoTo.com, 202 F.3d at 1210 (“The status quo ante \n5  litem refers not simply to any situation before the filing of a lawsuit, but instead to ‘the last \n6  uncontested status which preceded the pending controversy.’”) (citation omitted). \n7  To preserve the status quo ante litem, the court orders the following. \n8  First, the court vacates DHS’s decision to mass-rescind conditional approvals for the 2,714 \n9  beneficiaries conditionally approved for parole but who had not traveled to the United States. Cf. \n10  Regents II, 908 F.3d at 511–12 (affirming preliminary injunction vacating agency action that \n11  likely violates the APA and noting that “[s]uch relief is commonplace in APA cases”). \n12  Second, the court orders DHS to continue the post-conditional-approval processing for these \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  2,714 beneficiaries under the policies and procedures that it had in place prior to January 2017 for \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  processing such beneficiaries, including the procedures described in USCIS’s publication Central \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  American Minors (CAM) Parole Program: Information for Conditionally Approved Applicants \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  (Exhibit 48 in the administrative record).51 Cf.

Supp. 3d at 409 (similarly \n20  enjoining DHS from rescinding the DACA program and ordering DHS to “continue processing \n21 \n22                                                   \n49 The defendants do not deny that DHS stopped processing conditionally approved beneficiaries in \n23  January or February 2017. See Defs. Suppl. Opp’n – ECF No. 61 at 2. \n50 The court held that DHS’s public announcement in August 2017 that it was terminating the CAM \n24 \nParole Program mooted the plaintiffs’ APA challenge to the “secret shutdown” as it relates to DHS’s \nterminating the CAM Parole Program going forward. S.A., __ F. Supp. 3d __, 2018 WL 6470253, at \n25 \n*32. By contrast, the plaintiffs’ challenge here relates to the mass-rescinding of conditional approvals \nof parole that had already been issued. The alleged “secret shutdown” is relevant in determining the \n26 \nstatus quo ante litem with respect to that issue. \n27  51 U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Servs., Central American Minors (CAM) Parole Program: \nInformation for Conditionally Approved Applicants (Nov. 23, 2015) – ECF No. 33-48. \n28 \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  23 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 77   Filed 03/01/19   Page 24 of 30\n \n1  both initial DACA applications and DACA renewal requests under the same terms and conditions \n2  that applied before September 5, 2017, subject to [certain] limitations”).52 \n3  The court notes that the defendants have raised the prospect that, even if DHS’s decision to \n4  mass-rescind conditional approvals of parole were vacated and the beneficiaries’ conditional \n5  approval were restored, DHS might refuse to process the beneficiaries in good faith and instead \n6  might place the beneficiaries on an indefinite hold.53 The court thus explicitly orders that DHS \n7  may not adopt any policy, procedure, or practice of not processing the beneficiaries or placing \n8  their processing on hold en masse. Instead, DHS must process the beneficiaries in good faith. \n9  Nothing in this order prevents DHS from placing any beneficiary’s processing on hold on an \n10  individualized basis to the extent that it could do so under the policies and procedures it had in \n11  place prior to January 2017. \n12  Third, the court orders DHS, by March 21, 2019, to submit to the court and counsel a plan for \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  resuming processing the 2,714 beneficiaries, with benchmarks for assessing compliance. Cf. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Regents I, 279 F. Supp. 3d at 1048 (ordering DHS to prescribe a process consistent with the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  court’s injunction order); Ramos, 336 F.

Suppl. Opp’n – ECF No. 61 at 2 (“If the Court were to stay the August 2017 agency \n27  decision terminating that CAM Parole Program, as Plaintiffs request, the natural result would be for \nthe program to return to the holding pattern it was in prior to that decision, not to active processing.”). \n28 \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  24 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 77   Filed 03/01/19   Page 25 of 30\n \n1  Nothing in this order compels DHS to reach any particular outcome with respect to the \n2  processing of any individual beneficiary or prevents DHS from exercising its discretion with \n3  respect to the parole of any individual beneficiary. \n4  Nothing in this order prevents DHS from reconsidering its decision to mass-rescind \n5  conditional approvals of parole, including reassessing the serious reliance interests of participants \n6  conditionally approved for parole. \n7  4.2.2  The defendants’ objections \n8  The defendants raise several objections to the entry of a preliminary injunction. \n9  The defendants first object that the preliminary injunction “does not seek to preserve the status \n10  quo, as plaintiffs posit. Instead, plaintiffs seek to alter the status quo, asking the Court to turn back \n11  the clock . . . and reinstate the [CAM Parole] program for applicants in the pipeline at the time it \n12  was officially terminated.”54 To the extent that the court’s injunction “turn[s] back the clock,” it \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  does so to preserve the status quo ante litem, which — contrary to the defendants’ claims — is not \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  measured from the moment the plaintiffs filed their complaint but “instead to the ‘last uncontested \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  status which preceded the pending controversy.’” GoTo.com, 202 F.3d at 1210 (citation omitted). \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  The defendants argue that the plaintiffs did not file their complaint until ten months after DHS \nS d nr\nee 17  announced the termination of the CAM Parole Program and that this delay counsels against entry \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  of an injunction. “But, ‘courts are loath to withhold relief solely’ because of delay, which ‘is not \n19  particularly probative in the context of ongoing, worsening injuries.’” Disney, 869 F.3d at 866 \n20  (quoting Arc of Cal. v. Douglas, 757 F.3d 975, 990 (9th Cir. 2014)). Also, here, a number of the \n21  plaintiffs initially responded to DHS’s decision to rescind their conditional approvals of parole by \n22  first filing requests for review (“RFRs”) of the decisions denying them refugee status under the \n23  CAM Refugee Program.55 Two plaintiffs, M.C. and J.C., did not have their RFRs denied until \n24  June 2018.56 The other plaintiffs who filed RFRs received no responses when they filed this \n25                                                   \n54 Defs.

Arc. of Cal., 757 F.3d at 991. \n4  The defendants argue that the plaintiffs are requesting a mandatory injunction that alters the \n5  status quo, rather than a prohibitory injunction that maintains the status quo, and that their request \n6  thus should be subject to a heightened standard. The Ninth Circuit has held, however, that \n7  preliminary injunctions “that prohibit enforcement of a new law or policy . . . [are] prohibitory,” \n8  not mandatory. Ariz. Dream Act Coalition v. Brewer, 757 F.3d 1053, 1061 (9th Cir. 2014); accord \n9  Regents I, 279 F. Supp. 3d at 1025–26, 1048 n.20 (where plaintiffs did not file their complaint for \n10  three months after DHS terminated the DACA program, court nonetheless held that its injunction \n11  vacating DHS’s rescission of DACA and ordering DHS to continue processing DACA renewal \n12  applications was prohibitory, not mandatory, as it simply preserved the status quo ante litem).

The preliminary injunction the \nplaintiff sought thus would not have preserved a preexisting status quo but would have imposed new, \n26  never-before-instituted obligations on the Army. The court held that such a preliminary injunction \nwould be mandatory. Id. at 17 (“the plaintiff’s requested injunction is mandatory — that is, . . . its \n27  terms would alter, rather than preserve, the status quo by commanding some positive act”). Here, by \ncontrast, a preliminary injunction would return to a preexisting status quo. \n28 \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  26 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 77   Filed 03/01/19   Page 27 of 30\n \n1  the context of APA challenges in immigration matters, “[w]hen a reviewing court determines that \n2  agency regulations are unlawful, the ordinary result is that the rules are vacated,” and the fact that \n3  vacatur is the ordinary relief provided on a final judgment does not undermine a preliminary \n4  injunction that vacates the agency’s actions on a preliminary basis. Regents II, 908 F.3d at 511–12 \n5  (quoting Nat’l Mining Ass’n v. U.S. Army Corps. of Eng’rs, 145 F.3d 1399, 1409 (D.C. Cir. \n6  1998)).59 \n7  The defendants next object that the court cannot enjoin the Secretary of Homeland Security’s \n8  exercise of discretion with respect to parole decisions. This concern is misplaced. As stated above, \n9  the court does not enjoin the Secretary’s exercise of discretion and does not require DHS to reach \n10  a particular ultimate decision on parole with respect to any given beneficiary. Cf. Regents I, 279 F. \n11  Supp. 3d at 1048 (issuing injunction but allowing DHS to exercise fair discretion on an \n12  individualized basis and not constraining DHS’s ability to remove any individual DACA enrollee \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  that DHS determines in its judgment should be removed); Batalla Vidal, 279 F.

Scialabba, No. 17-cv-0805-PJH, 2017 WL 747460 (N.D. Cal. Feb. \nee 17 \ntinhtr 27, 2017), to argue that a preliminary injunction that provides the same relief that the plaintiffs \nUo ultimately seek after a full judgment is improper. That case, which was not an APA case, is inapposite. \nN 18 \nThe plaintiff there was a non-citizen who sought a writ of mandamus compelling USCIS to process his \napplication for an adjustment of his immigration status. Id. at *1. The plaintiff sought a preliminary \n19 \ninjunction compelling USCIS to process his application — the same relief he requested in his petition \nfor a writ of mandamus. Id. at *2–3. The court denied the plaintiff’s request for a preliminary \n20 \ninjunction on the grounds that the plaintiff was not seeking to preserve any preexisting status quo and \ninstead “[wa]s seeking a mandatory injunction that would require the government to immediately \n21 \nadjudicate his petition for adjustment of status.” Id. at *3. Here, by contrast, a preliminary injunction \nwould return the plaintiffs to a preexisting status quo. \n22 \n  The defendants also cite University of Texas v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390 (1981), to argue that “[i]t is \n23  generally inappropriate for a federal court at the preliminary-injunction stage to give a final judgment \non the merits.” Defs. Opp’n – ECF No. 32 at 16 (citing Camenisch, 451 U.S. at 395). This argument \n24  does not change the outcome either. Camensich said nothing about the form that preliminary injunctive \nrelief could or could not take: the question of a preliminary injunction in that case was moot, and the \n25  Court declined to address it. Id. at 394. What the Court was saying was that findings of fact and \nconclusions of law made by a court in granting a preliminary injunction are just that — preliminary — \n26  and do not bind the court at a trial on the merits. Id. at 395. As a result, it is inappropriate to enter a \nfinal judgment (such as a summary judgment) at the preliminary-injunction stage. See id. at 395–96. \n27  The court is not entering a final judgment here — and nothing in Camenisch holds that the scope of a \npreliminary injunction cannot overlap with the relief requested for an eventual final judgment. \n28 \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  27 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 77   Filed 03/01/19   Page 28 of 30\n \n1  case-by-case, individualized basis”). The court requires only that DHS follow the procedures that \n2  were previously in place with respect to processing conditionally approved beneficiaries.60 \n3  The defendants next argue that any preliminary injunction should be limited to the named \n4  plaintiffs who were CAM Parole Program participants. In support of this argument, the defendants \n5  cite Azar, 911 F.3d 558, where the Ninth Circuit narrowed a preliminary injunction issued in \n6  connection with a challenge to regulations promulgated under the Affordable Care Act from \n7  applying nationwide to applying only in those states that were plaintiffs in the case. Id. at 582–\n8  84.61 The defendants do not explain how an injunction limited to the named individual plaintiffs in \n9  this case would provide full relief to CASA. Cf. East Bay I, 909 F.3d at 1256 (declining to narrow \n10  nationwide injunction where “the Government failed to explain how the district court could have \n11  crafted a narrower remedy that would have provided complete relief to the Organizations”) \n12  (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted) (citing Regents II, 908 F.3d at 512). Azar also did \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  not involve immigration, an area where the Ninth Circuit has “consistently recognized the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  authority of district courts to enjoin unlawful policies on a universal basis” to “promote[] \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  uniformity in immigration enforcement, and . . . provide the plaintiffs . . . with complete redress.” \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  East Bay I, 909 F.3d at 1255 (citing Regents II, 908 F.3d at 511–12; Trump IV, 878 F.3d at 701; \nS d nr\nee 17  Washington, 847 F.3d at 1166–67). “Because Azar did not involve immigration laws, it did not \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  cast doubt on the Ninth Circuit’s ‘uncontroverted line of precedent’ regarding nationwide \n19  injunctions in this context, which assuredly involve issues of ‘nationwide impact.’” East Bay II, __ \n20  F. Supp. 3d __, 2018 WL 6660080, at *17 (citing East Bay I, 909 F.3d at 1256; Azar, 911 F.3d at \n21  584). \n22  Finally, the defendants argue that the court should remand DHS’s decision to mass-rescind \n23  conditional approvals of parole to DHS for reconsideration, rather than enjoining or vacating \n24 \n                                                 \n25 \n60 Accord Pls. Suppl. Reply – ECF No. 67 at 3 (“Plaintiffs do not ask the Court to mandate a particular \noutcome in any given CAM application, but simply to require Defendants (including Border Patrol) to \n26 \nfollow their own procedures that were in place during the last uncontested status.”). \n27  61 Within those states, the injunction still applied statewide and thus affected nonparties beyond the \nnamed plaintiffs in the case. \n28 \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  28 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 77   Filed 03/01/19   Page 29 of 30\n \n1  DHS’s decision.62 (On February 27, 2019, two weeks after the second hearing in this case, the \n2  Director of USCIS submitted a declaration stating that USCIS is currently undergoing a \n3  reconsideration process that is expected to take approximately 60 days.63) The Ninth Circuit has \n4  affirmed the propriety of preliminary injunctions in APA cases staying or vacating agency action \n5  over remanding the matter to the agency. See Regents II, 908 F.3d at 511–12. While “‘[a] federal \n6  court ‘is not required to set aside every unlawful agency action,’ and the ‘decision to grant or deny \n7  injunctive or declaratory relief under APA is controlled by principles of equity,’” the defendants \n8  have not persuaded the court why it should decline to issue an injunction here. All. for the Wild \n9  Rockies v. U.S. Forest Serv., 907 F.3d 1105, 1121 (9th Cir. 2018) (quoting Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n v. \n10  Espy, 45 F.3d 1337, 1343 (9th Cir. 1995)). While DHS can consider the issue for as long as it \n11  wants, the court issues a preliminary injunction now to preserve the status quo ante litem.64 \n12   \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  CONCLUSION \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  The court grants in part and denies in part the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  The court denies the plaintiffs’ motion to enjoin DHS from terminating the CAM Parole Program \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  going forward.

      "text": " \n \n \nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE           \n \nJune 14, 2018    \n \nPRESS CONTACTS \n \nSarah Blume, IRAP, sblume@refugeerights.org, 646-602-5654 \nNicole Houston, Arnold & Porter, Nicole.Houston@arnoldporter.com, 202-942-6418    \n           \n \nGROUPS FILE CLASS ACTION CHALLENGE TO TRUMP ADMINISTRATION’S TERMINATION OF \nHUMANITARIAN PAROLE PROGRAM FOR CENTRAL AMERICAN CHILDREN \n \nSan Francisco, C.A. –  Yesterday, applicants and beneficiaries of the Central American Minors \n(CAM) Parole program filed a class action challenge to the Trump Administration’s termination \nof this life-saving humanitarian assistance for Central American children, including the \nrevocation of conditional parole for nearly 3,000 children.  The complaint, filed in the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of California, asks the Court to strike down the \nAdministration’s discriminatory attempt to deny vulnerable Central American children the \npossibility to safely reunite with their family members in the United States. \n \nIn 2014, the Departments of Homeland Security and State set up the CAM program as a dual \nrefugee/parole program, in response to the humanitarian crisis for children in the “Northern \nTriangle” countries of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala.  That crisis persists today, with \nchildren from these countries desperately trying to reach the southern U.S. border to apply for \nasylum.  Rather than keeping in place a program that processed children’s applications in an \norderly manner while they were still in Central America, and that helped thousands of children \ncome to safety in the United States, the Trump Administration shut it down without any \nexplanation.   \n \nShortly after President Trump’s inauguration, the Trump Administration secretly shut down the \nCAM Parole program and stopped processing applications, even as it continued to collect fees \nfrom applicants.  Seven months later, it publicly terminated the CAM Parole program, including \nby revoking grants of conditional parole for almost 3,000 children who had been told they \nwould travel to the United States as long as they completed all the application steps.  The \nTrump Administration revoked their status en masse without explanation and for no reason.  \nSome of the children had already completed every step of the process, including paying \nthousands of dollars for plane tickets, and had travel dates, when their status was revoked. \n \n \n \n40 Rector St., 9th Floor, New York, NY 10006 \nT 646.602.5600  refugeerights.org • twitter.com/RefugeeAssist • facebook.com/RefugeeAssist \n\n \n \nThis case is brought just as the Trump Administration is turning away migrants seeking asylum \nat the southern U.S. border and tearing apart Central American families who enter the country-\n-claiming these actions are necessary to protect law and order.  It is the height of hypocrisy that \nthis same Administration shut down an existing, lawful program that allowed thousands of \nchildren to be processed for humanitarian parole in their home countries and to come to the \nU.S. through an orderly, legal process. \n \nThe plaintiff class includes about 3,000 children and family members who were conditionally \napproved for parole before August 16, 2017. The individual plaintiffs, along with CASA, are \nrepresented by the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) at the Urban Justice Center \nand Arnold & Porter.  \n \nJ.F., Plaintiff who has lived in the U.S. for 20 years and applied to CAM on behalf of his 8-year-\nold and 2-year-old daughters and his wife, said: “I think that the President is trying to hurt \nCentral Americans like me and my family.  I am afraid and feel a lot of uncertainty about what’s \ngoing to happen to me here. . . . I miss the warmth and love of my family. . . . I worry about my \nwife and daughters day and night, constantly.”           \n \nD.D., Plaintiff whose daughter finished every step of the process, including paying for plane \ntickets to the U.S. and had a travel date, said: “I never doubted that my daughter would travel \nto the United States. . . .  Her process was over.  I never thought she would be affected by the \ntermination after going through the whole process, after we did everything that was asked of \nus.”                                                                        \n \nLinda Evarts, Staff Attorney for IRAP, said: “It is unconscionable that, in the middle of a \nhumanitarian crisis, the Administration blocked parents lawfully in the United States from \nreuniting with their children escaping the dangerous conditions of their home countries. We \nhope the Court recognizes the humanitarian importance of the CAM parole program and \nreaffirms this country’s commitment to helping the most vulnerable.” \n \nJohn A. Freedman, Partner Arnold & Porter, said: “CAM was a critical humanitarian program \nwhich was illegally shut down because the beneficiaries were Latino.  In taking these secret but \nshameful actions, the Administration acted in a remarkably cruel manner that betrayed the \nexpectations of thousands of families that hoped to reunite in safety in the United States.”   \n \nTo view the complaint, click here. \n \n \n### \n \n \n40 Rector St., 9th Floor, New York, NY 10006 \nT 646.602.5600  refugeerights.org • twitter.com/RefugeeAssist • facebook.com/RefugeeAssist ",

Unless otherwise noted, the information in this report is \ncurrent as of December 19, 2019. \n \nNote: Update on Paragraph 7 Plaintiffs \n  \nFurther to paragraph 7 of the MOA, USCIS agreed to re-open two Plaintiff family cases and consider them for \nparole, specifically, the beneficiaries (1) A.B.’s son; (2) A.B.’s son’s child; (3) H.F.; (4) A.F.; and (5) H.F. and \nA.F.’s mother.  USCIS reopened their cases and has issued them all advance parole documents.  A.B.’s son \ntraveled to the U.S. on October 23, 2019.  He opted not to take his child.  A.F., H.F., and A.F. were issued their \ntransportation letters, but have yet to travel because they are awaiting required travel authorization from the \nnon-present parent, a requirement of the Honduran government.  \n \nNote: Update on Paragraph 9 for third quarterly report only: \n \nUSCIS agreed to report on (1) the number of beneficiaries for whom the U.S.-based parent did not respond to \nUSCIS contact efforts and (2) the number of beneficiaries who did not respond to USCIS contact efforts.  \nUSCIS issued written notices to all U.S.-based parents about the court order and continued case processing. \nUSCIS received returned from the USPS as undeliverable 301 notices, representing 190 petitioners, but of those \n190 petitioners, USCIS was later able to locate most of those petitioners and/or their beneficiaries by phone \nand/or email.  At this point in time, USCIS has been unable to contact 33 U.S. based parents, or petitioners, and \ntheir 50 beneficiaries about the court order and continued processing.   \n \nThe re-opening notice sent to U.S.-based parents provided contact information for USCIS and instructions to \nprovide USCIS with updated contact information about beneficiaries if the previous information had changed.  \nIt did not specifically require that affected individuals respond to USCIS in order to “opt in” to the settlement \nagreement.  IOM calls all eligible beneficiaries to schedule updated medical examinations and, when necessary, \nschedule fingerprinting appointments.  IOM completes these calls on a rolling basis, based on how many \nadditional individuals IOM is able to process operationally at a given time. Four individuals have declined to \nmove forward with case processing.  Two hundred and seventy applicants are currently being processed.  Sixty \neight have already traveled to the U.S. and been paroled.  No cases that were re-opened have been denied. \n \nThe 270 cases currently being processed include individuals contacted for medical payment, individuals whose \nmedical payment is complete, individuals with scheduled medicals, individuals contacted for travel payment, \nand individuals whose travel payment is complete. \n \nAssumptions: \n \nAs noted previously in the USCIS operational compliance plan, USCIS will leverage IOM’s expertise and \nresources as it did when the CAM Parole program was previously operating.  The submitted timeline \nrepresented the fastest estimated process assuming all external parties met the estimated milestones, but will be \nupdated as more information becomes available.  The estimated timeline was also based on previous CAM \nparole adjudications, and does not account for unforeseen differences.   \n \n \n \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 103   Filed 12/27/19   Page 4 of 11\nTimeline Updates \n \nSteps: Estimated timelines are approximate and may shift depending on unforeseen factors as well as those \nnoted above. \n \nIt is important to note that in addition to assisting with the processing of the CAM parole cases, IOM has had to \nre-establish contact with the local government partners such as the Ministry of External Relations and \nSalvadoran Immigration (DGME), as well as hire additional staff to manage the workload.   \n \nFurther to paragraph 8 of the MOA, USCIS notes the following progress on the Compliance Plan.  For \nreference, USCIS has reproduced the tasks, estimated timeline and comments from the Compliance Plan, and \nprovided a status update and date of completion on each tasking. \n \nStatus updates  \nfor January 1, 2019 Parole Status \nReport* \nCompliance Plan filed on \n*Unless otherwise noted, information current as of December \n April 18, 2019  \n19, 2019 \n   \nEstimated  \nActual \nCompletion \nTask  Timeline   Comments  Completion Date  Comments \nUSCIS will verify  March 21  Completed initial  Completed on May 20.

Governing Law \n6  “A minor or an incompetent person who does not have a duly appointed representative may \n7  sue by a next friend or by a guardian ad litem. The court must appoint a guardian ad litem — or \n8  issue another appropriate order — to protect a minor or incompetent person who is unrepresented \n9  in an action.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(c)(2). An individual’s capacity to sue is determined by the law of \n10  the individual’s domicile. Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(b). Under California law, an individual under the age \n11  of eighteen is a minor. Cal. Fam. Code § 6500. A minor may bring suit as long as a guardian \n12  conducts the proceedings and the court may appoint a guardian ad litem to protect the minor’s \n \na\nrt ni\nouor 13  interests in the litigation. Cal. Fam. Code § 6601; Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 372(a); Williams v. \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  Super. Ct., 147 Cal. App. 4th 36, 46–47 (2007). \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  The court “has broad discretion in ruling on a guardian ad litem application.” Williams, 147 \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  Cal. App. 4th at 47. In the case of parent representatives, “‘[w]hen there is a potential conflict \nd Srn \nee 17  between a perceived parental responsibility and an obligation to assist the court in achieving a just \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  and speedy determination of the action,’ a court has the right to select a guardian ad litem who is \n19  not a parent if that guardian would best protect the child’s interests.” Id. at 49 (quoting M.S. v. \n20  Wermers, 557 F.2d 170, 175 (8th Cir. 1977)). Thus, “if the parent has an actual or potential \n21  conflict of interest with his [or her] child, the parent has no right to control or influence the child’s \n22  litigation.” Id. at 50. If, on the other hand, “a parent brings an action on behalf of a child, and it is \n23  evident that the interests of each are the same, no need exists for someone other than the parent to \n24  represent the child’s interests under Rule 17(c).” J.M. v. Liberty Union High Sch. Dist., No. 16-cv-\n25  05225-LB, 2016 WL 4942999, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 16, 2016) (citing cases). “‘In the absence of \n26 \n27                                                   \n3 Pets. for Appointment of Guardian Ad Litem – ECF Nos. 13–16. \n28 \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  2 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 19   Filed 06/19/18   Page 3 of 3\n \n1  a conflict of interest, the appointment is usually made on application only and involves little \n2  exercise of discretion.’” Williams, 147 Cal. App. 4th at 47 (internal ellipsis omitted) (quoting In re \n3  Marriage of Caballero, 27 Cal. App. 4th 1139, 1149 (1994)). \n4   \n5  2.  Application \n6  A.F., H.F., B.E., and J.C. are all under eighteen years old and therefore are minors under \n7  California law. Their ability to sue is contingent on appointments of guardians ad litem. A parent \n8  may serve as guardian ad litem if the parent does not have an adverse interest. \n9  A.F., H.F., B.E., and J.C. ask to appoint their respective fathers as guardian ad litem. The \n10  fathers — J.F., G.E., and R.C. — are all plaintiffs in this action, and the fathers’ and children’s \n11  interests are the same. The court finds no conflicts in their claims. The guardian ad litem \n12  appointments are therefore appropriate. See J.M., 2016 WL 4942999, at *2 (“Generally, when a \n \na\nrt ni\nouor 13  minor is represented by a parent who is a party to the lawsuit and who has the same interests as the \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  child there is no inherent conflict of interest.”) (quoting Burke v. Smith, 252 F.3d 1260, 1264 (11th \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  Cir. 2001)). \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16   \nd Srn \nee 17  CONCLUSION \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  The court grants the petitions and appoints J.F. as guardian ad litem for A.F. and H.F., G.E. as \n19  guardian ad litem for B.E., and R.C. as guardian ad litem for J.C. \n20   \n21  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n22  Dated: June 19, 2018 \n23  ______________________________________ \nLAUREL BEELER \n24 \nUnited States Magistrate Judge \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  3 ",

The Federal Defendants also seek to \n11  have all claims of the alien parole applicants, who are nationals of, and currently residing in, either \n12  Honduras, El Salvador or Guatemala, dismissed for lack of standing, as well as the direct injury claims \n13  of CASA dismissed for lack of standing.

Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392 (2018), compels the \n3  conclusion that plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their action challenging the termination \n4  of the Central American Minors (“CAM”) Parole Program.  In Hawaii, the Supreme Court emphasized \n5  that judgments about immigration policy are to be made by Congress and the Executive, not the \n6  Judiciary.  “For more than a century, this Court has recognized that the admission and exclusion of \n7  foreign nationals is a fundamental sovereign attribute exercised by the Government’s political \n8  departments largely immune from judicial control.”  138 S. Ct. at 2418.  The Court’s review of the \n9  Executive’s admission decisions concerning foreign nationals is limited “to whether the Executive gave \n10  a facially legitimate and bona fide reason for its action.”  Id. at 2419.  “It is not the judicial role in cases \n11  of this sort to probe and test the justifications of immigration policies.”  Id. \n12  The Hawaii plaintiffs sought to cast doubt on the immigration policy at issue—the Presidential \n13  Proclamation—by relying on “a series of statements by the President and his advisers.”  Id. at 2417.  \n14  The Court, however, reaffirmed the applicability of Kleindienst v. Mandel’s “narrow standard of review” \n15  in “admission and immigration cases.”  Id. at 2419; see Kleindienst, 408 U.S. 753 (1972).  At most, the \n16  court should conduct rational basis review, considering “whether the entry policy is plausibly related to \n17  the Government’s stated objective.”  Id. at 2420.  “As a result, [a court] may consider plaintiffs’ \n18  extrinsic evidence, but [must] uphold the policy so long as it can reasonably be understood to result from \n19  a justification independent of unconstitutional grounds.”  Id.   \n20  In light of the standard of review, “it should come as no surprise that the Court hardly ever \n21  strikes down a policy as illegitimate under rational basis scrutiny.”  Id.  The Hawaii Court found that the \n22  Presidential Proclamation at issue easily satisfied rational basis review.  “[B]ecause there is persuasive \n23  evidence that the entry suspension has a legitimate grounding in national security concerns, quite apart \n24  from any religious hostility, we must accept that independent justification.”  Id. at 2421.  The Court \n25  declined to “substitute [its] own assessment for the Executive’s predictive judgments on such matters, \n26  all of which are delicate, complex, and involve large elements of prophecy.”  Id.  The Court thus held \n27  that plaintiffs had “not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their constitutional claim,” \n28  and reversed the grant of a preliminary injunction.  Id. at 2423. \n  1 \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 32   Filed 08/24/18   Page 10 of 33\n \n \n \n1  Termination of the CAM Parole Program passes Hawaii’s rational basis scrutiny.  The Secretary \n2  of Homeland Security’s rescission of the CAM Parole Program was based on the facially legitimate \n3  view that only Congress—not the Executive—should create immigration programs applicable to pre-\n4  designated categories of aliens.  (AR Exs. 2, 5, 6, 9.1)  The plain language of section 212(d)(5)(A) of the \n5  Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A), which establishes the Secretary’s \n6  discretionary authority to grant temporary parole “only on a case-by-case basis,” “strongly counsel[s] in \n7  favor of using the parole authority sparingly and only in individual cases[.]”  (AR Ex. 5.)  This facially \n8  neutral reason for rescission of the CAM Parole Program will plainly survive Hawaii’s rational basis \n9  scrutiny.  Accordingly, plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction must be denied. \n10  The request for a preliminary injunction must also be denied because it seeks to alter, not \n11  maintain, the status quo.  The CAM Parole Program was terminated on August 16, 2017—nearly ten \n12  months before plaintiffs filed suit and eleventh months before they moved for a preliminary injunction.  \n13  The Ninth Circuit has made it clear that a preliminary injunction may not be used to obtain “a \n14  preliminary adjudication on the merits,” but only to preserve the status quo pending final judgment.  \n15  Sierra On-Line, Inc. v. Phoenix Software, Inc., 739 F.2d 1415, 1422 (9th Cir. 1984).  Through their \n16  preliminary injunction motion, plaintiffs seek to undermine the status quo, and resurrect a program that \n17  has long been terminated.  This fact counsels strongly against entry of a preliminary injunction.   \n18    BACKGROUND \n19  A.  General Principles of Parole. \n20  “Parole” exists separate and apart from the CAM Parole Program.  Parole allows a foreign \n21  national to be physically present in the United States for a specific, temporary period.  See, e.g., Leng \n22  May Ma v. Barber, 357 U.S. 185, 190 (1958) (observing that parole “was never intended to affect an \n23  alien’s status” or result in a determination that “parole placed [the alien] legally within the United \n24  States”).  Parole of a foreign national into the United States is not an “admission” of that person into the \n25  country in a valid immigrant or nonimmigrant status.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A).  Under the \n26 \n                                                 \n27 \n1 The agency’s Administrate Record is submitted herewith, and cited as “AR.”  The \nAdministrative Record is comprised of 62 documents, which are appended as exhibits (“Ex.”) to the \n28 \nIndex of the Administrative Record.   \n  2 \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 32   Filed 08/24/18   Page 11 of 33\n \n \n \n1  Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), the decision to parole an alien into the United States \n2  temporarily is a wholly discretionary determination made by the Secretary of Homeland Security, who is \n3  to exercise such authority “only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant \n4  public benefit[.]”  Id.2   \n5  Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) regulations generally describe DHS’s discretionary \n6  parole authority.  See 8 C.F.R. § 212.5.  DHS may terminate parole at any time in the agency’s \n7  discretion, consistent with existing regulations, and in those cases, the individual is “restored to the \n8  status that he or she had at the time of parole.”  8 C.F.R. § 212.5(e); see also 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A).   \n9  A decision by DHS to exercise its discretion favorably that is made while the parole applicant is \n10  still in his or her home country is a conditional authorization only.  Conditional parole authorization \n11  permits the applicant to travel to the United States.  If an applicant is granted conditional parole \n12  authorization, either U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”), a DHS component, or the \n13  Department of State, at DHS’s direction, will issue travel documents to enable the applicant to travel to \n14  a U.S. port-of-entry and request parole from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).  (AR Ex. 1.)  \n15  The ultimate determination whether to parole an individual into the United States is made by CBP \n16  officers upon the individual’s arrival at a U.S. port of entry.  (Id.)  If parole is ultimately granted, the \n17  parolee may stay in the United States unless and until the parole period expires or is terminated.  See 8 \n18  C.F.R. § 212.5(e). \n19  B.  The CAM Parole Program. \n20  The CAM Parole Program was established by the DHS in 2014, along with the CAM Refugee \n21  Program, to provide certain qualified minors in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras with a path to \n22  reunite with parents already lawfully present in the United States.  (AR Ex. 1.)  The CAM programs \n23  began accepting applications from qualifying parents in the United States for their children on December \n24  1, 2014.  (AR Ex. 11.)  The CAM Refugee and Parole Programs provided eligible children the \n25  opportunity to be considered, while still in their home country, for refugee resettlement in the United \n26 \n                                                 \n27 \n2 Although 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5) continues to refer to the Attorney General, this parole authority \nnow resides exclusively with the Secretary of Homeland Security.  See Matter of Arrabally & \n28 \nYerrabelly, 25 I. & N. Dec. 771, 777 n.5 (BIA 2012). \n  3 \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 32   Filed 08/24/18   Page 12 of 33\n \n \n \n1  States.  Qualifying children who were denied refugee status were automatically considered for parole \n2  into the United States.  (AR Ex. 1.) \n3  A qualifying child’s accompanying parent, sibling, or child could also be considered for parole \n4  into the United States under the program.  (AR Ex. 1.)  If USCIS found a child or qualifying family \n5  member to be ineligible for refugee status, the decision notice informed the applicant of whether he or \n6  she had been instead conditionally approved for parole into the United States under the CAM Parole \n7  program.  (AR Exs. 1, 44.)  “Significant public benefit” for parole was considered established if the \n8  qualifying child or family member was found to meet the criteria for the program.  (AR Exs. 41 at \n9  AR000442, 44.)  The applicant also had to merit a favorable exercise of discretion to be conditionally \n10  approved for parole, which qualifying children typically did absent some adverse information in their \n11  background.  The CAM Parole Program was established, without notice and comment procedures, based \n12  on the Secretary’s discretionary parole authority and broad authority to administer the immigration laws.  \n13  (AR Ex. 1.)   \n14  On August 16, 2017, then Acting Secretary Elaine Duke announced the termination of the \n15  discretionary CAM Parole Program.  (Id).  Her decision to rescind the CAM Parole Program was made \n16  in accordance with Executive Order 13767, which called for DHS to take appropriate action to ensure \n17  that parole authority under § 212(d)(5) of the INA was exercised only individually, on a case-by-case \n18  basis, in accordance with the plain language of the statute, “and in all circumstances only when an \n19  individual demonstrates urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit derived from such \n20  parole.”  (AR Exs. 2, 5, 6, 9.)  The decision was motivated by the administration’s legitimate view that \n21  only Congress should establish programs “granting parole to certain aliens in pre-designated categories.”  \n22  (AR Ex. 5.)  The statutory language of the INA “counsel[s] in favor of using the parole authority \n23  sparingly and only in individual cases[.]”  (Id.)  Thus, “[c]onsistent with the Executive order, the Acting \n24  Secretary of Homeland Security [] reviewed the CAM Parole Program and decided to rescind the \n25  program, which automatically considered for parole all individuals found ineligible for refugee status \n26  under the in-country refugee program in Guatemala, Honduras, or El Salvador.”  (AR Ex. 6.) \n27  Individuals who had been conditionally approved for parole, but had not yet travelled, were \n28  notified that the CAM Parole Program had been terminated, and that their conditional parole had been \n  4 \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 32   Filed 08/24/18   Page 13 of 33\n \n \n \n1  rescinded.  (AR Exs. 1, 6.)  However, individuals who had already been paroled into the United States \n2  (i.e., had already traveled to the United States) under the CAM Parole Program are able maintain their \n3  parole until the expiration of its period, unless there are other grounds for termination under DHS \n4  regulations, set forth at 8 C.F.R. § 212.5(e).  (AR Exs. 1, 6.)  CAM Program parolees already in the \n5  United States may also apply for re-parole on Form I-131 or for any immigration status for which they \n6  may be otherwise eligible.  (Id.)  Moreover, although the CAM Parole Program was rescinded, minors in \n7  Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador are still able to apply for parole consideration independent of the \n8  CAM Parole Program by filing USCIS Form I-131, Application for Travel Document.  (Id.)  \n9  Additionally, individuals who were conditionally approved for parole before the CAM Parole Program \n10  was rescinded were given an additional 90 days to submit a request for review of the denial of their \n11  refugee cases.  (Id.) \n12    LEGAL STANDARDS \n13  A.  Preliminary Injunction Standard. \n14  A preliminary injunction is an “extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear \n15  showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.”  Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. \n16  7, 22 (2008).  Preliminary injunctions are “never awarded as of right.”  Id. at 24.   \n17  “A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must show that: (1) she is likely to succeed on the \n18  merits, (2) she is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, (3) the balance of \n19  equities tips in her favor, and (4) an injunction is in the public interest.”  Garcia v. Google, Inc., 786 \n20  F.3d 733, 740 (9th Cir. 2015) (citing Winter, 555 U.S. at 20).  Alternatively, a plaintiff can show that \n21  there are “’serious questions going to the merits’ and the ‘balance of hardships tips sharply towards’ \n22  [plaintiff], as long as the second and third Winter factors are [also] satisfied.”  Disney Enters., Inc. v. \n23  VidAngel, Inc., 869 F.3d 848, 856 (9th Cir. 2017).  “[P]laintiffs seeking a preliminary injunction face a \n24  difficult task in proving that they are entitled to this extraordinary remedy.”  Earth Island Inst. v. \n25  Carlton, 626 F.3d 462, 469 (9th Cir. 2010).  Plaintiffs’ burden is aptly described as a “heavy” one.  Id. \n26  The purpose of a preliminary injunction “is to preserve the status quo and the rights of the parties \n27  until a final judgment issues in the cause.”  U.S. Philips Corp. v. KBC Bank N.V., 590 F.3d 1091, 1094 \n28  (9th Cir. 2010).  A preliminary injunction may not be used to obtain “a preliminary adjudication on the \n  5 \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 32   Filed 08/24/18   Page 14 of 33\n \n \n \n1  merits,” but only to preserve the status quo pending final judgment.  Sierra On-Line, Inc. v. Phoenix \n2  Software, Inc., 739 F.2d 1415, 1422 (9th Cir. 1984).   \n3  Accordingly, where a plaintiff seeks mandatory injunctive relief—seeking to alter the status \n4  quo—“courts should be extremely cautious.”  Stanley v. Univ. of S. California, 13 F.3d 1313, 1319 (9th \n5  Cir. 1994).  A mandatory injunction “goes well beyond simply maintaining the status quo pendente lite \n6  and is particularly disfavored.”  Id. at 1320 (internal quotations and alteration omitted).  A mandatory \n7  injunction “should not be issued unless the facts and law clearly favor the moving party.”  Anderson v. \n8  United States, 612 F.2d 1112, 1114 (9th Cir. 1980).  Mandatory injunctions “are not granted unless \n9  extreme or very serious damage will result and are not issued in doubtful cases[.]”  Id. at 1115.  A party \n10  seeking a mandatory injunction “must establish that the law and facts clearly favor her position, not \n11  simply that she is likely to succeed.”  Garcia, 786 F.3d at 740 (9th Cir. 2015) (emphasis in original). \n12  B.  Rule 12(b)(6) Standard. \n13  Dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) is proper where there is either a “lack \n14  of a cognizable legal theory” or “the absence of sufficient facts alleged under a cognizable legal theory.”  \n15  Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Dep’t, 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1990).  The Supreme Court’s decisions \n16  in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007), and Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009), \n17  make it clear that conclusory allegations are no longer sufficient to withstand a challenge under Rule \n18  12(b)(6).  To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must plead facts sufficient to “state a claim to \n19  relief that is plausible on its face.”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570.  A claim has “facial plausibility” only if \n20  the complaint pleads facts sufficient to allow “the court to draw the reasonable inference that the \n21  defendant is liable for misconduct alleged.”  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.  While the Court must treat all \n22  factual allegations as true for purposes of a motion to dismiss, the Court is “not bound to accept as true a \n23  legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.”  Iqbal, 556 U.S. 678.   \n24     \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n  6 \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 32   Filed 08/24/18   Page 15 of 33\n \n \n \n1  C.  Review Under the Administrative Procedure Act. \n2  Whether an agency complied with the governing Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) \n3  standard is a question of law.  See Am. Bioscience, Inc. v. Thompson, 269 F.3d 1077, 1083 (D.C. Cir. \n4  2001).  The APA “sets forth the full extent of judicial authority to review executive agency action for \n5  procedural correctness.”  FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 513 (2009).  It requires \n6  courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions” that are “arbitrary, \n7  capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  This \n8  is a “deferential” standard, Nat’l Ass’n of Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife, 551 U.S. 644, 658 \n9  (2007), which “presume[s] the validity of agency action,” Sw. Bell Tel. Co. v. FCC, 168 F.3d 1344, 1352 \n10  (D.C. Cir. 1999), and bars a court from substituting its judgment for that of the agency, see Motor \n11  Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  The Court “will not \n12  disturb the decision of an agency that has examine[d] the relevant data and articulate[d] a satisfactory \n13  explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.”  \n14  Ams. for Safe Access v. DEA, 706 F.3d 438, 449 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (quotations and citation omitted).   \n15    ARGUMENT \n16  I.  PLAINTIFFS’ REQUEST FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION THAT ALTERS THE \nSTATUS QUO SHOULD BE DENIED.  \n17 \n18  The CAM Parole Program was officially terminated on August 16, 2017.  (AR Ex. 1.)  Plaintiffs \n19  did not file this lawsuit until June 13, 2018 (ECF 1) and did not file their motion for a preliminary \n20  injunction until July 11, 2018 (ECF 24), nearly eleven months after the program’s termination.  \n21  Plaintiffs’ delay in “filing their Complaint and [Preliminary Injunction] Motion, [is] something which \n22  weighs decidedly against granting the extraordinary relief they seek.”  Republican Party of Pennsylvania \n23  v. Cortes, 218 F. Supp. 3d 396, 404 (E.D. Pa. 2016); accord AARP v. EEOC, 226 F. Supp. 3d 7, 22 \n24  (D.D.C. 2016), and cases cited therein.   \n25  Plaintiffs’ motion does not seek to preserve the status quo, as plaintiffs posit.  (ECF 24 at 9.)  \n26  Instead, plaintiffs seek to alter the status quo, asking the Court to turn back the clock to August 2017 and \n27  “set[] aside the termination of the CAM Parole program . . . and reinstat[e] the program for applicants in \n28  the pipeline at the time it was officially terminated.”  (Id. at 31.)  This is precisely the same affirmative, \n  7 \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 32   Filed 08/24/18   Page 16 of 33\n \n \n \n1  injunctive relief that plaintiffs seek in their complaint.  (Compare ECF 1 at Prayer for Relief with ECF \n2  24 at 31.)  See Taiebat v. Scialabba, No. 17-CV-0805-PJH, 2017 WL 747460, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 27, \n3  2017) (“The relief petitioner is seeking in this [preliminary injunction] motion is not ‘temporary’ or \n4  ‘preliminary,’ but rather is the exact same ultimate relief he seeks in his petition.”).”  “[I]t is generally \n5  inappropriate for a federal court at the preliminary-injunction stage to give a final judgment on the \n6  merits.”  Univ. of Texas v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981).  “The purpose of a preliminary \n7  injunction is merely to preserve the relative positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be \n8  held.”  Id.   \n9  The mandatory injunction plaintiffs seek alters, rather than preserves, the status quo pending a \n10  final judgment in this case.  See Singh v. Carter, 185 F. Supp. 3d 11, 16–17 (D.D.C. 2016) (indicating \n11  that a mandatory injunction alters, rather than preserves the status quo by “commanding some positive \n12  act.”).  “When a mandatory preliminary injunction is requested, [as here] the district court should deny \n13  such relief unless the facts and law clearly favor the moving party.”  Stanley v. Univ. of S. California, 13 \n14  F.3d 1313, 1320 (9th Cir. 1994).  Plaintiffs cannot meet this heightened burden.  See id. (affirming \n15  denial of request for mandatory preliminary injunction). \n16  A mandatory injunction would be especially inappropriate here, as the APA “does not confer \n17  jurisdiction onto the Court to alter the status quo nor does it allow the Court in issuing interim relief to \n18  actually dictate specific terms or conditions to a governmental agency.”  Salt Pond Assocs. v. U.S. Army \n19  Corps of Eng’rs, 815 F. Supp. 766, 776 (D. Del. 1993).  The APA authorizes courts to provide \n20  preliminary injunctive relief only to “postpone the effective date of an agency action” or to “preserve \n21  status or rights pending conclusion of the review proceedings.”  5 U.S.C. § 705.  The CAM Parole \n22  Program has already been terminated.  It was terminated many months ago.  See Select Milk Producers, \n23  Inc. v. Johanns, 400 F.3d 939, 955 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (citations omitted) (“Judicial precedent confirms \n24  that the status quo is the last uncontested status which preceded the pending controversy.”).  As \n25  plaintiffs are asking the Court to “issue a preliminary injunction setting aside the termination of the \n26  CAM Parole program” (ECF 24 at 31), plaintiffs are undeniably seeking a mandatory injunction that \n27  alters the status quo.  This is impermissible under the APA.  See Salt Pond Assocs., 815 F. Supp. at 775-\n28  76; 5 U.S.C. § 705.  The Court cannot provide plaintiffs with the affirmative injunctive relief they seek \n  8 \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 32   Filed 08/24/18   Page 17 of 33\n \n \n \n1  because the APA does not permit entry of a mandatory injunction against DHS. \n2  II.  PLAINTIFFS CANNOT SATISFY THEIR HEIGHTENED BURDEN FOR OBTAINING \nA MANDATORY PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION. \n3 \n4  In addition to being impermissible under the APA, a preliminary injunction is otherwise \n5  unwarranted.  Plaintiffs cannot show that they are clearly likely to succeed on the merits of their claims.  \n6  The Secretary lawfully exercised her discretion to terminate the CAM Parole Program based on the \n7  facially legitimate view that parole authority should only be exercised individually, on a case-by-case \n8  basis, and not through the creation of immigration programs applicable to pre-designated categories of \n9  aliens.  It would be inappropriate for the court to interfere with the executive branch’s authority to \n10  enforce immigration laws consistent with a Presidential Executive Order.   \n11  A.  Plaintiffs Cannot Show That They Will Clearly Succeed On The Merits. \n12  1.  Plaintiffs Will Not Clearly Succeed On Their APA Causes Of Action. \n13  Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on their APA claim.  It is well established that “[t]he scope of \n14  review under the ‘arbitrary and capricious’ standard is narrow and a court is not to substitute its \n15  judgment for that of the agency.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. \n16  Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  “[I]t is irrelevant whether this Court, a judge in California or New York, or \n17  even a justice on the Supreme Court might have made a different decision while standing in the shoes of \n18  DHS.”  Casa De Maryland v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 284 F. Supp. 3d 758, 772 (D. Md. 2018), \n19  appeal pending, No. 18-1522 (4th Cir. filed May 8, 2018).  The relevant inquiry is whether the decision \n20  was made with “a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the \n21  facts found and the choice made.”  State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43. \n22  Here, the Administrative Record reflects that DHS terminated the CAM Parole Program based \n23  on the facially legitimate view that only Congress should create immigration programs applicable to pre-\n24  designated categories of aliens.  (AR Exs. 2, 5, 6, 9.)  The plain language of section 212(d)(5)(A) of the \n25  INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A), which establishes the Secretary’s discretionary authority to grant \n26  temporary parole “only on a case-by-case basis,” “strongly counsel[s] in favor of using the parole \n27  authority sparingly and only in individual cases[.]”  (AR Ex. 5.)  In tension with the INA’s instruction to \n28  grant parole “only on a case-by-case basis,” individuals considered for  parole under the CAM Parole \n  9 \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 32   Filed 08/24/18   Page 18 of 33\n \n \n \n1  Program were found categorically to meet the “significant public benefit” requirement for parole by \n2  meeting pre-established criteria, which was “all qualifying children found ineligible for refugee status \n3  under the in-country refugee program in Guatemala, Honduras, or El Salvador,” who demonstrated a \n4  well-founded fear of harm.  (AR Ex. 41 at AR000440, AR000442, Ex. 9 at AR000038.)  Tellingly, data \n5  from November 2016 indicates that 99 percent of applicants were conditionally approved for either \n6  refugee resettlement or parole under the CAM Program, prior to the program’s termination.  (AR Ex. 17 \n7  at AR000103.)  \n8  There is a rational connection between the Secretary’s conclusion that the INA counsels in favor \n9  of using parole authority sparingly and only in individual cases and the decision to cancel the CAM \n10  Parole Program.  Plaintiffs emphasize the fact that “the humanitarian crisis that led to the creation of the \n11  CAM program has not abated.”  (ECF 24 at 15.)  But this fact is not inconsistent with the Secretary’s \n12  decision, and was, in fact, expressly considered by the agency.  (See, e.g., AR Ex. 9 at AR000049 \n13  (“Q16.  Does the United States believe that these children are no longer in danger?  A16.  The review \n14  and subsequent termination of the CAM Parole Program is unrelated to the risk of harm that USCIS \n15  evaluates within each CAM Parole case.”) and Ex. 33 at AR000182 (acknowledging that “DHS is \n16  pursuing a new strategy to secure the U.S. southern border”).) \n17  Deference to the Secretary’s decision to terminate the CAM Parole Program is especially \n18  appropriate here, as the Secretary has broad discretion regarding parole.  Congress has precluded judicial \n19  review of individual parole determinations.3  See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii); Bolante v. Keisler, 506 \n20  F.3d 618, 621 (7th Cir. 2007).  As the Ninth Circuit explained in Mason v. Brooks, 862 F.2d 190, 193-94 \n21  (9th Cir. 1988), the Secretary’s “decision to deny parole is not reviewed under the ‘traditional abuse of \n22  discretion standard.’”  “Instead, a rejection of parole will be upheld if the agency advanced a facially \n23  legitimate and bona fide reason for the denial.”  Id. at 193–94.  See also Jeanty v. Bulger, 204 F. Supp. \n24 \n                                                 \n25  3 Parole decisions are specifically committed to agency discretion.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A).  \nPlaintiffs fail to demonstrate how this Court has jurisdiction to review the termination of the CAM \n26 \nParole Program, given that it is a discretionary “decision or action” covered by the review preclusion \nprovision at 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).  See Kucana v. Holder, 558 U.S. 233, 248 (2010) (8 U.S.C. \n27 \n§ 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) shields decisions or actions specified by statute to be in the discretion of the \n28  Secretary from court oversight); see also Hassan v. Chertoff, 593 F.3d 785, 788 (9th Cir. 2010).  This \njurisdictional issue further counsels against entry of a preliminary injunction. \n  10 \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 32   Filed 08/24/18   Page 19 of 33\n \n \n \n1  2d 1366, 1380 (S.D. Fla. 2002), aff’d sub. nom., Moise v. Bulger, 321 F.3d 1336 (11th Cir. 2003) (noting \n2  “extremely deferential” standard of review, limited to whether the agency has articulated “a facially \n3  legitimate and bona fide reason” for its decision).  The Supreme Court has instructed that “when the \n4  Executive exercises this power [to exclude aliens] negatively on the basis of a facially legitimate and \n5  bona fide reason, the courts will neither look behind the exercise of that discretion, nor test it by \n6  balancing its justification against other [constitutional interests].”  Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753, \n7  770 (1972).  The Secretary’s reasons for terminating the CAM Parole Program were facially legitimate \n8  and bona fide.   \n9  The fact that the Secretary made the decision to terminate the CAM Parole Program without \n10  notice and comment procedures does not undermine the validity of the decision.  The CAM Parole \n11  Program was instituted by the Obama administration without notice and comment procedures.  (See \n12  AR.)  As Judge Alsup held in the context of a challenge to the termination of the DACA policy, “it \n13  remains the case that because the original promulgation of the discretionary program did not require \n14  notice and comment, a return to the status quo ante also does not require notice and comment.”  Regents \n15  of Univ. of California v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 298 F. Supp. 3d 1304, 1310 (N.D. Cal. 2018).   \n16  Nor was there a “secret shutdown” of the CAM Parole Program as plaintiffs allege.  (ECF 24 at \n17  19-21.)  On February 20, 2017, following the issuance of Executive Order 13767, then Secretary Kelly \n18  issued an implementing memorandum, instructing DHS to undertake a review of its various parole \n19  policies.  (AR Ex. 5 at AR000030.)  DHS thereafter conducted a careful review of the Central American \n20  Minors (CAM) Parole program, and Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke decided to \n21  terminate the program.  (AR Ex. 9 at AR000046.)  “While the CAM program was under review, USCIS \n22  ceased considering or offering parole or further processing individuals who had been conditionally \n23  approved for parole under the program.”  (Id.)  This is not a secret shutdown—there is nothing nefarious \n24  about a new administration taking the time to evaluate a program that had been put in place through \n25  executive action by the prior administration and pausing processing cases while conducting that \n26  evaluation.   \n27  Agency action is not subject to a heightened standard of review simply because it represents a \n28  change in administrative policy.  See F.C.C. v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 514 (2009).  \n  11 \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 32   Filed 08/24/18   Page 20 of 33\n \n \n \n1  “Elections have policy consequences.”  Organized Vill. of Kake v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 795 F.3d 956, \n2  968 (9th Cir. 2015).  “[R]eevaluation [of policy choices after an election] is well within an agency’s \n3  discretion.”  Id.  “There is nothing improper about the political branches of the government carrying out \n4  such changes in policy.  To the contrary, such policy changes are often how successful presidential \n5  candidates implement the very campaign promises that helped secure their election.  That is simply the \n6  way the modern political process works.”  Id. at 980 (Smith, J., dissenting).   \n7  Parole under the CAM Parole Program was never guaranteed.  Even those applicants who had \n8  been conditionally approved for parole, were informed that the DHS Secretary retained discretion to \n9  terminate parole.  (AR Ex. 48 at AR 000465.)  See also AR Ex. 17 at AR000105 (“Q.  Is there any \n10  guarantee this arrangement will be permitted to proceed under the Trump Administration?  • President \n11  Obama is in office until January 20, 2017.  • We are not in a position to speculate on the plans of \n12  President-elect Trump.”).   \n13  The agency did consider and account for reliance interests.  The Secretary chose not to terminate \n14  the parole of those who had already been paroled into the county under the CAM Parole Program.  (AR \n15  Ex. 1 at AR000002 (“Although DHS is terminating the CAM Parole Program, individuals who have \n16  been paroled into the United States will maintain parole until the expiration of that period of parole \n17  unless there are other grounds for termination of parole under DHS regulations[.]).)  Moreover, although \n18  plaintiffs reference fees for “medical examinations and plane tickets” for “examinations and flights \n19  [that] were never actually scheduled” (ECF 24 at 27), the termination decision called for such fees to be \n20  refunded.  (See e.g., AR Ex. 6 at AR 000037.) \n21  Plaintiffs’ arguments based on United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260 \n22  (1954), cannot save their APA claims.  (ECF 24 at 21.)  As an initial matter, the CAM Parole Program \n23  was not a formally promulgated regulation, of the type at issue in Accardi.  See Walker v. Reno, 925 F. \n24  Supp. 124, 131 (N.D.N.Y. 1995); see also Perez v. Mortg. Bankers Ass’n, 135 S. Ct. 1199, 1206 (2015) \n25  (“Because an agency is not required to use notice-and-comment procedures to issue an initial \n26  interpretive rule, it is also not required to use those procedures when it amends or repeals that \n27  interpretive rule.”).  Regardless, “the Accardi doctrine does not bar an agency from amending its \n28  regulations,” let alone its informal guidance.  Pennzoil Co. v. Dep’t of Energy, 480 F. Supp. 1126, 1131 \n  12 \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 32   Filed 08/24/18   Page 21 of 33\n \n \n \n1  (D. Del. 1979).  “[T]he Accardi doctrine does not prohibit all changes in agency practice and procedure, \n2  but only such as are arbitrary and unexplained.”  Id. at 132.  As set forth above, the reasons for the \n3  termination of the CAM Parole Program are clearly set forth in the Administrative Record.  Moreover, \n4  as discussed below, plaintiffs have no cognizable due process interest in continuation of the CAM Parole \n5  program.  This fact alone takes termination of the CAM Parole program outside the Accardi doctrine.  \n6  See Hall v. E.E.O.C., 456 F. Supp. 695, 703 (N.D. Cal. 1978) (“But the message of [Accardi] remains \n7  clear that an agency’s violation of its regulations is not a violation of due process if no interests within \n8  the protection of the due process clause are involved.”).   \n9  In short, the agency satisfactorily explained its reasons for termination the CAM Parole Program, \n10  and there is a rational relationship between those reasons and the decision to terminate the program.  As \n11  such, plaintiffs have not shown that they will clearly succeed on their APA claims. \n12  2.  Plaintiffs Will Not Clearly Succeed On Their Due Process Claim. \n13  Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on their due process claims (both substantive and procedural) \n14  either.  “To assert a due process claim, a plaintiff must first show that he or she has an interest in liberty \n15  or property protected by the Constitution.”  Regents of Univ. of California, 298 F. Supp. 3d at 1310.  \n16  Plaintiffs do not have a protected interest in the continuation of the CAM Parole Program here.   \n17  “In the immigration context, courts have long recognized the power to expel or exclude aliens as \n18  a fundamental sovereign attribute exercised by the Government’s political departments largely immune \n19  from judicial control.”  Munoz v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 950, 954 (9th Cir. 2003).  Because discretionary \n20  immigration relief “is a privilege created by Congress, denial of such relief cannot violate a substantive \n21  interest protected by the Due Process clause.”  Id.  “Our court of appeals has accordingly held there is no \n22  protected interest in temporary parole, since such relief is entirely within the discretion of the \n23  [Secretary].”  Regents of Univ. of California, 298 F. Supp. 3d at 1310 (granting motion to dismiss due \n24  process claims in DACA context) (citing Kwai Fun Wong v. United States, 373 F.3d 952, 967-68 (9th \n25  Cir. 2004)); see also Garcia-Mir v. Smith, 766 F.2d 1478, 1484 (11th Cir. 1985) (holding that \n26  inadmissible aliens lack a cognizable due process interest in parole under § 1182(d)(5)); Jeanty v. \n27  Bulger, 204 F. Supp. 2d 1366, 1375 (S.D. Fla. 2002) (same), aff’d, 321 F.3d 1336 (11th Cir. 2003).  \n28  These authorities foreclose any argument that plaintiffs have a protected interest in continuation of the \n  13 \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 32   Filed 08/24/18   Page 22 of 33\n \n \n \n1  CAM Parole Program here.  See Regents of Univ. of California, 298 F. Supp. 3d at 1310.  Accordingly, \n2  plaintiffs cannot show that the termination of the CAM Parole Program violated substantive due process.   \n3  The fact that the termination of the CAM Parole Program was the result of a change in \n4  administration does not undermine this conclusion.  “There is nothing surprising or unfair about policies, \n5  laws, or enforcement thereof changing with an election cycle.  Furthermore, the election process, and \n6  not federal litigation, is the appropriate method for resolving any fairness implicated in” the termination \n7  of the CAM Parole program.  Casa De Maryland, 284 F. Supp. 3d at 777 (holding, in DACA context, \n8  that plaintiffs’ substantive due process claim lacked merit).   \n9  Plaintiffs’ attempt to buttress their constitutional claims by highlighting their reliance interest \n10  fares no better.  Plaintiffs do not have a constitutionally-protected reliance interest in the continuation of \n11  the CAM Parole program.  “[A] person’s belief of entitlement to a government benefit, no matter how \n12  sincerely or reasonably held, does not create a protected right if that belief is not mutually held by the \n13  government.”  Regents of Univ. of California, 298 F. Supp. 3d at 1311 (citing Gerhart v. Lake Cty., \n14  Mont., 637 F.3d 1013, 1020 (9th Cir. 2011)).  Moreover, an “agency’s past practice of generally \n15  granting a government benefit is also insufficient to establish a legal entitlement.”  Id; accord Gerhart, \n16  637 F.3d at 1020 (“The Supreme Court has explained, ‘[a] constitutional entitlement cannot be \n17  created—as if by estoppel—merely because a wholly and expressly discretionary state privilege has \n18  been granted generously in the past.’” (quoting Conn. Bd. of Pardons v. Dumschat, 452 U.S. 458, 465 \n19  (1981))).  Plaintiffs’ argument that they have “[r]eli[ed] on the government’s representations, . . . \n20  spen[ding] thousands of dollars to pre-pay for required DNA tests, medical examination, and plane \n21  tickets, as well as hundreds or thousands of dollars to pay for their children’s successive required trips to \n22  the capital cities where all CAMP appointments took place” (ECF 24 at 12) are similar to the reliance \n23  interests advanced by plaintiffs in Regents of the University of California, challenging the rescission of \n24  the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.  Judge Alsup nevertheless rejected the \n25  notion that such reliance could give rise to a constitutional claim.  The court “empathize[d] with those \n26  DACA recipients who have built their lives around the expectation that DACA, and its associated \n27  benefits, would continue to be available to them if they played by the rules.  That expectation, however, \n28  remains insufficient to give rise to a constitutional claim under the Fifth Amendment.”  Id. \n  14 \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 32   Filed 08/24/18   Page 23 of 33\n \n \n \n1  Plaintiffs’ procedural due process arguments are similarly unavailing.  “[B]ecause the \n2  requirements of procedural due process apply only to the deprivation of interests encompassed by the \n3  Constitution’s protection of liberty and property and because the range of interests protected by \n4  procedural due process is not infinite, the first inquiry in every due process challenge is whether the \n5  plaintiff has been deprived of a protected interest in ‘property’ or ‘liberty.’”  Ass’n of Proprietary \n6  Colleges v. Duncan, 107 F. Supp. 3d 332, 347 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (emphasis in original).  “Only upon a \n7  finding that the plaintiff has been deprived of such an interest do courts look to see if the government’s \n8  procedures comport with due process.”  Id.; see also Bd. of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. \n9  564, 569 (1972) (“The requirements of procedural due process apply only to the deprivation of interests” \n10  protected by the Constitution); Sorannos Gasco, Inc. v. Morgan, 874 F.2d 1310, 1316 (9th Cir. 1989) \n11  (“The procedural due process guarantees . . . apply only when a constitutionally protected liberty or \n12  property interest is at stake.”).   \n13  Thus, for the same reason that plaintiffs lack a constitutionally-protected interest in continuation \n14  of the CAM Parole Program sufficient to support a substantive due process claim, their procedural due \n15  process claims fail.  See Casa De Maryland, 284 F. Supp. 3d at 776 (holding that DACA’s termination \n16  did not violate procedural due process because DACA did not create an entitlement).  The procedural \n17  due process argument fails for the additional reason that procedural due process does not attach to \n18  programmatic policy changes.  “[P]rocedural due process only applies to individualized deprivations, \n19  not policy-based deprivations for an entire class.”  Id.   \n20  As such, plaintiffs cannot show that they are clearly likely to succeed on their due process \n21  claims.   \n22  3.  Plaintiffs Will Not Clearly Succeed On Their Equal Protection Claim. \n23  The Supreme Court’s recent decision in Trump v. Hawaii forecloses plaintiffs’ equal protection \n24  claims.  The agency’s reasons for terminating the CAM Parole Program are set forth in the \n25  Administrative Record.  Those reasons—the belief that parole authority should only be exercised \n26  sparingly, on an individual, case-by-case basis, and that use of parole authority to create immigration \n27  programs not established by Congress is inappropriate—are “facially legitimate and bona fide.”  Hawaii, \n28  138 S. Ct. at 2419.  The Supreme Court has instructed that courts must “neither look behind the \n  15 \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 32   Filed 08/24/18   Page 24 of 33\n \n \n \n1  [Executive’s] exercise of [its] discretion [over the admission and exclusion of foreign nationals], nor test \n2  it by balancing its justification against the asserted constitutional interests[.]”  Id. (citing Kleindienst v. \n3  Mandel, 408 U.S. 753, 770 (1972)).  The Executive’s policy decision must be upheld “so long as it can \n4  reasonably be understood to result from a justification independent of unconstitutional grounds.”  Id. at \n5  2420.  “Given the standard of review, it should come as no surprise that the Court hardly ever strikes \n6  down a policy as illegitimate under rational basis scrutiny.”  Id. \n7  “The Administrative Record—the basis from which the Court must make its judicial review—\n8  does not support the notion that [the agency] was targeting a subset of the immigrant population, and it \n9  does not support any supposition that the decision was derived on a racial animus.”  Casa De Maryland, \n10  284 F. Supp. 3d at 774.  The rescission of the CAM Parole Program did not single out nationals of El \n11  Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras for less favorable parole consideration than nationals of other \n12  countries.  Instead, it put them on the same footing as nationals of other countries.  Now, all aliens may \n13  apply for parole by filing USCIS Form I-131, Application for Travel Document.  (AR Ex. 1, 6.)  What \n14  plaintiffs are really complaining about is not the failure to receive equal treatment, but the fact that they \n15  are no longer receiving preferential treatment. \n16  The Administrative Record here makes it clear that the CAM Parole Program was terminated \n17  based on the administration’s facially legitimate view that only Congress should establish programs \n18  “granting parole to certain aliens in pre-designated categories.”  (AR Ex. 5.)  The statutory language of \n19  the INA “counsel[s] in favor of using the parole authority sparingly and only in individual cases[.]”  \n20  (Id.)  Thus, “[c]onsistent with the Executive order, the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security [] \n21  reviewed the CAM Parole Program and decided to rescind the program, which automatically considered \n22  for parole all individuals found ineligible for refugee status under the in-country refugee program in \n23  Guatemala, Honduras, or El Salvador.”  (AR Ex. 6.)  The rescission of the CAM Parole program \n24  “merely fulfills the duty of the executive branch to faithfully enforce the laws passed by Congress.  \n25  Accordingly, no affirmative showing of bad faith can follow.”  Casa De Maryland, 284 F. Supp. 3d at \n26  775 (considering termination of DACA program).  Review of the agency’s reasons, as set forth in the \n27  Administrative Record “is where the judicial inquiry should end.”  Casa De Maryland, 284 F. Supp. 3d \n28  at 774.  See also id. (“reject[ing] Plaintiffs’ reliance on the President’s misguided, inconsistent, and \n  16 \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 32   Filed 08/24/18   Page 25 of 33\n \n \n \n1  occasionally irrational comments made to the media to establish an ulterior motive”); Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. \n2  at 2417-2420 (refusing to invalidate Presidential Proclamation No. 9645 based on “a series of statements \n3  by the President and his advisers casting doubt on the official objective of the Proclamation” in light of \n4  the government’s proffered justification, which was “independent of unconstitutional grounds.”).   \n5  The Supreme Court’s decision in Hawaii, which also concerns the authority of the Executive to \n6  make decisions about the admission and exclusion of foreign nationals, is directly on-point and \n7  controlling.  Plaintiffs simply cannot prevail on their equal protection claims after Hawaii.   \n8  4.  Plaintiffs Will Not Clearly Succeed On Their Equitable Estoppel Cause Of \nAction.   \n9 \nPlaintiffs’ equitable estoppel claims appear to be based on what plaintiffs label the “secret shut \n10 \ndown” of the CAM Program in January 2017, prior to the publicly announced termination on August 16, \n11 \n2017.  (ECF 1 at 44.)  Plaintiffs allege that they relied to their detriment on various website statements \n12 \nthat the CAM Program remained in effect.  (Id.)4 \n13 \nBut, plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on their equitable estoppel cause of action, because \n14 \nequitable estoppel is not a cause of action at all.  “Equitable Estoppel is not an affirmative claim, but \n15 \nrather an affirmative defense.”  Johnson v. Mazza, No. 215CV09183ODWAS, 2016 WL 5842186, at *4 \n16 \n(C.D. Cal. Oct. 4, 2016); see also Dobrowski v. Jay Dee Contractors, Inc., 571 F.3d 551, 554 n.1 (6th \n17 \nCir. 2009) (“[E]quitable estoppel is not a cause of action but a judicial doctrine that bars the assertion of \n18 \na claim or defense.”).  Equitable estoppel is a tolling doctrine that can excuse a plaintiff’s failure to \n19 \ntimely raise his claims.  As the Ninth Circuit has explained, “although the doctrines of equitable tolling \n20 \nand equitable estoppel are often confused, the better reasoning states that equitable tolling applies when \n21 \nthe plaintiff is unaware of his cause of action, while equitable estoppel applies when a plaintiff who \n22 \nknows of his cause of action reasonably relies on the defendant’s statements or conduct in failing to \n23 \nbring suit.”  Estate of Amaro v. City of Oakland, 653 F.3d 808, 814 (9th Cir. 2011).   \n24 \n                                                 \n25 \n4 A number of the named plaintiffs candidly acknowledge that, prior to August 16, 2017, they \nwere informed that the CAM Parole Program was on hold due to the new administration.  (See, e.g., \n26 \nECF 24-7 [Declaration of A.D.] at ¶ 12 (“After almost a month had passed, IOM told my mom that \neverything was frozen because of the new President.”); ECF 1 [Complaint] at ¶ 53 (alleging that an \n27 \n“IOM employee [informed plaintiff D.D.] that none of the CAM cases could be processed because the \nnew government had changed its position, and IOM had to wait for orders from the new \n28 \nAdministration.”).)   \n  17 \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 32   Filed 08/24/18   Page 26 of 33\n \n \n \n1  Tellingly, none of the equitable estoppel cases plaintiffs cite in the immigration context endorse \n2  the use of equitable estoppel as an affirmative cause of action.  (ECF 24 at 26.)  See Salgado-Diaz v. \n3  Gonzales, 395 F.3d 1158, 1165-66 (9th Cir. 2005), (applying equitable estoppel to bar the INS’s claim \n4  of removability); Villena v. Immigration & Naturalization Serv., 622 F.2d 1352, 1361 (9th Cir. 1980) \n5  (holding that where “INS did not respond to [plaintiff’s] petition until almost four years later [with] no \n6  apparent justification for this delay[,] INS [wa]s estopped from claiming that Villena failed to \n7  adequately pursue his claim for preference classification”); Sun Il Yoo v. Immigration & Naturalization \n8  Serv., 534 F.2d 1325, 1328 (9th Cir. 1976) (holding that INS could not use its “unreasonable [one-year] \n9  delay in recognizing the bona fides of Yoo’s petition” against him). \n10  Equitable estoppel does not come into play in the context of this case.  The government is not \n11  claiming that plaintiffs’ challenge to the rescission of the CAM Parole Program is barred by the statute \n12  of limitations or their delay.  Instead of using equitable estoppel to block one of the government’s \n13  defenses, as the doctrine is intended to be used, plaintiffs are attempting use the label affirmatively, as a \n14  catch-all cause of action to challenge the government’s change in policy.  They cannot do so.  “[C]ourts \n15  invoke the doctrine of estoppel against the government with great reluctance.”  Emery Min. Corp. v. \n16  Sec’y of Labor, 744 F.2d 1411, 1416 (10th Cir. 1984).  “Application of the doctrine is justified only \n17  where it does not interfere with underlying government policies or unduly undermine the correct \n18  enforcement of a particular law or regulation.”  Id.  Here, application of estoppel would interfere with \n19  the government’s policy decision to end the CAM Parole Program.  The Acting Secretary of DHS issued \n20  her decision to terminate the CAM Parole Program on August 16, 2017, a decision which was \n21  committed to the Secretary’s discretion by law.  (AR Ex. 1.) \n22  Even if equitable estoppel were available as an affirmative cause of action to challenge a change \n23  in policy (which it is not), plaintiffs could not satisfy its elements.  In the rare situations in which \n24  equitable estoppel may apply against the government, the party advocating estoppel must show \n25  “affirmative misconduct going beyond mere negligence.”  Watkins v. U.S. Army, 875 F.2d 699, 707 (9th \n26  Cir. 1989).  In the immigration context, courts have described “affirmative misconduct” as a “deliberate \n27  lie” or “a pattern of false promises.”  Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176, 1184 (9th Cir. 2001) (en \n28  banc); see also Sulit v. Schiltgen, 213 F.3d 449, 454 (9th Cir. 2000) (“Neither the failure to inform an \n  18 \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 32   Filed 08/24/18   Page 27 of 33\n \n \n \n1  individual of his or her legal rights nor the negligent provision of misinformation constitute affirmative \n2  misconduct.”).  “[E]ven then, estoppel will only apply where the government’s wrongful act will cause a \n3  serious injustice, and the public’s interest will not suffer undue damage by imposition of the liability.”  \n4  Watkins, 875 F.2d at 707; accord Morgan v. Gonzales, 495 F.3d 1084, 1092 (9th Cir. 2007).  Plaintiffs \n5  cannot meet this standard. \n6  Plaintiffs cannot plausibly allege that the government engaged in any “affirmative misconduct \n7  going beyond mere negligence.”  The CAM Parole Program was not “secretly” shut down, as plaintiffs \n8  allege.  Instead, after President Trump issued Executive Order 13767 on January 25, 2017, which \n9  instructed the DHS Secretary to ensure that parole authority was exercised “only on a case-by-case basis \n10  in accordance with the plain language of the statute” (AR Ex. 2 at AR000006), then Secretary Kelly \n11  issued a February 20, 2017 implementing memorandum, instructing DHS to undertake a review of its \n12  various parole policies (AR Ex. 5 at AR000030).  DHS then “conducted a careful review of the Central \n13  American Minors (CAM) Parole program, and Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke \n14  decide to terminate the program.”  (AR Ex. 9 at AR000046.)  “While the CAM program was under \n15  review, USCIS ceased considering or offering parole or further processing individuals who had been \n16  conditionally approved for parole under the program.”  (Id.)  This is not affirmative misconduct—there \n17  is nothing nefarious about a new administration taking the time to evaluate a program that had been put \n18  in place through executive action by the prior administration.  CAM Parole Program applicants, even \n19  those who had been conditionally approved, were informed that the DHS Secretary retained discretion to \n20  terminate parole.  (AR Ex. 48 at AR 000465.)  See also Ex. 17 at AR000105 (“Q.  Is there any guarantee \n21  this arrangement will be permitted to proceed under the Trump Administration?  • President Obama is in \n22  office until January 20, 2017.  • We are not in a position to speculate on the plans of President-elect \n23  Trump.”).  Although plaintiffs reference fees for “medical examinations and plane tickets” for \n24  “examinations and flights [that] were never actually scheduled” (ECF 24 at 27), the termination decision \n25  contemplated that such fees would be refunded.  (See e.g., AR Ex. 6 at AR 000037.)  This does not \n26  amount to “affirmative misconduct going beyond mere negligence.” \n27  Plaintiffs’ equitable estoppel claims merely repackage their policy challenges.  The doctrine is \n28  unavailable as an affirmative cause of action for such broad-based challenges.  And, even if it were, \n  19 \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 32   Filed 08/24/18   Page 28 of 33\n \n \n \n1  plaintiffs cannot satisfy its elements.  Plaintiffs are not clearly likely to succeed on their equitable \n2  estoppel claim. \n3  B.  Plaintiffs’ Request For Preliminary Injunctive Relief Is Contrary To The Public \nInterest. \n4 \n5  Granting a preliminary injunction would be contrary to the public interest.  The balance of harms \n6  and the public interest elements of the injunctive relief test merge when the government is the opposing \n7  party.  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009).  Courts must “pay particular regard for the public \n8  consequences in employing the extraordinary remedy of injunction.”  Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, \n9  456 U.S. 305, 312-13 (1982).  “Particularly in cases involving important public issues which implicate \n10  significant policy considerations, it is appropriate that the trial judge consider possible harm to other \n11  interested parties and the public interest in deciding whether to issue the preliminary injunction.”  \n12  Republican Party of Pennsylvania v. Cortes, 218 F. Supp. 3d 396, 412 (E.D. Pa. 2016).  Entry of a \n13  preliminary injunction would be contrary to the public interest here.   \n14  At its core, plaintiffs’ motion is asking for special treatment from the United States’s \n15  immigration laws.  It also seeks to use the courts to undermine the policy consequences of an election.  \n16  But, plaintiffs fail to show that their claimed “irreparable injury” outweighs the threatened harm that an \n17  injunction would cause, or that it would not “adversely affect [the] public interest[.]”  Weinberger, 456 \n18  U.S. at 312; Southdown, Inc. v. Moore McCormack Res., Inc., 686 F. Supp. 595, 596 (S.D. Tex. 1988) \n19  (explaining that it is petitioner’s burden to show that an injunction would cause “no disservice to \n20  unrepresented third parties”).  Any order that enjoins a governmental agency from enforcing statutes and \n21  executive orders promulgated by the duly-elected representatives of the people constitutes an irreparable \n22  injury that weighs heavily against the entry of injunctive relief, see, e.g., New Motor Vehicle Bd. v. \n23  Orrin W. Fox Co., 434 U.S. 1345, 1351 (1977).  See AR Ex. 2 [Executive Order 13767] (“The Secretary \n24  [of Homeland Security] shall take appropriate action to ensure that parole authority under section \n25  212(d)(5) of the INA (8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)) is exercised only on a case-by-case basis in accordance \n26  with the plain language of the statute, and in all circumstances only when an individual demonstrates \n27  urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit derived from such parole.”).  See also United \n28  States v. Valenzuela–Bernal, 458 U.S. 858, 864 (1982) (“The power to regulate immigration—an \n  20 \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 32   Filed 08/24/18   Page 29 of 33\n \n \n \n1  attribute of sovereignty essential to the preservation of any nation—has been entrusted by the \n2  Constitution to the political branches of the Federal Government.”); Fogo de Chao (Holdings) Inc. v. \n3  U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 769 F.3d 1127, 1151 n.10 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (“[O]ur Constitution places \n4  such sensitive immigration and economic judgments squarely in the hands of the Political Branches, not \n5  the courts[.]”). \n6  The Court’s entry of a mandatory injunction against DHS would interfere with the executive \n7  branch’s ability to enforce the U.S. immigration laws.  For these reasons, plaintiffs’ requested injunction \n8  is inconsistent the public interest, and the request for a preliminary injunction should be denied.   \n9  III.  NEITHER THE ALIEN PAROLE APPLICANTS NOR CASA HAS STANDING. \n10  Neither the alien parole applicants nor CASA has standing to proceed.  As such, their claims \n11  must be dismissed, and they are not entitled to injunctive relief.   \n12  Standing requires (1) that the plaintiff has suffered an “injury in fact” that is “concrete and \n13  particularized,” and “actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical,” (2) that the injury is “fairly \n14  traceable to the challenged action,” and (3) that “it is likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the \n15  injury will be redressed by a favorable [judicial] decision.”  Friends of the Earth Inc., v. Laidlaw Envtl. \n16  Servs. Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180-81 (2000).  “[B]ecause standing is a necessary predicate to any exercise \n17  of the Court’s jurisdiction, the plaintiff and [his] claims have no likelihood of success on the merits, if \n18  the plaintiff lacks standing.”  Arpaio v. Obama, 27 F. Supp. 3d 185, 207 (D.D.C. 2014).  Similarly, an \n19  absence of standing “dooms the plaintiff’s ability to show irreparable harm.”  Id.  Thus, when plaintiffs \n20  lack standing, the Court must deny their requests for injunctive relief and dismiss their claims outright.  \n21  Id.   \n22  Under these principles, neither the alien parole applicants nor CASA has established standing \n23  and their claims must be dismissed. \n24  A.  The Alien Parole Applicants Lack Article III Standing To Proceed. \n25  The alien parole applicants, who are nationals of, and currently residing in either Honduras, El \n26  Salvador or Guatemala, lack standing because they cannot establish that they suffer from an injury in \n27  fact.  Aliens abroad have no legally protected interest in parole, which is a wholly-discretionary \n28  determination, so their inability to obtain parole under the CAM Parole Program is not a cognizable \n  21 \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 32   Filed 08/24/18   Page 30 of 33\n \n \n \n1  legal injury in fact.   \n2  Establishing injury in fact requires a showing of “an invasion of a legally protected interest.”  \n3  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560; see also Fleck & Assocs., Inc. v. Phoenix, City of, an Arizona Mun. Corp., 471 \n4  F.3d 1100, 1104 (9th Cir. 2006).  But, “unadmitted nonresident aliens have no constitutional right of \n5  entry to this country” and thus lack standing to challenge the denial of their admission, or here, parole.  \n6  Benjamin v. United States Dep’t of State, No. 17-CV-03587-LB, 2018 WL 1142124, at *4 (N.D. Cal. \n7  Mar. 2, 2018) (Beeler, J.).  See also Chinese Am. Civic Council v. Attorney Gen., 396 F. Supp. 1250, \n8  1251 (D.D.C. 1975) (“Standing apparently has never been granted to a person outside the United States \n9  challenging the denial of entry or immigration eligibility.”); Chun v. Powell, 223 F. Supp. 2d 204, 207 \n10  (D.D.C. 2002) (“[A]n unadmitted nonresident alien, has no standing to challenge the denial of her entry \n11  into the United States.”). \n12  Moreover, the grant of parole under the INA is not a legally protected interest because it “is \n13  clearly a discretionary decision under the statute.”  Maldonado v. Macias, 150 F. Supp. 3d 788, 794-95 \n14  (W.D. Tex. 2015) (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A)).  An alien has no legally protected interest in a \n15  discretionary immigration determination.  See, e.g., Mendez-Garcia v. Lynch, 840 F.3d 655, 665 (9th \n16  Cir. 2016); Dave v. Ashcroft, 363 F.3d 649, 653 (7th Cir. 2004) (indicating that “in immigration \n17  proceedings, a petitioner has no liberty or property interest in obtaining purely discretionary relief”); \n18  Smith v. Ashcroft, 295 F.3d 425, 430 (4th Cir. 2002) (stating that an alien’s eligibility for discretionary \n19  relief is not a constitutionally protected interest).  Accordingly, the alien-plaintiffs’ inability to obtain \n20  parole under the CAM Parole Program does not amount to “an invasion of a legally protected interest” \n21  sufficient to establish an injury in fact.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560.   \n22  For these reasons, the alien-parole-applicant plaintiffs lack Article III standing to proceed, and \n23  their claims must be dismissed. \n24  B.  CASA Also Lacks Prudential Standing To Pursue Relief On Its Own Behalf. \n25  CASA also lacks direct standing to pursue relief on its own behalf.  The government reserves for \n26  another day the questions of whether CASA has associational standing to proceed on behalf of its \n27  members in the United States, but CASA clearly does not have associational standing to proceed on \n28  behalf of the alien-parole-applicant plaintiffs, as such plaintiffs lack standing to sue in their own right, as \n  22 \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 32   Filed 08/24/18   Page 31 of 33\n \n \n \n1  discussed above.  See Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advert. Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (U.S. 1977) \n2  (Associational standing requires that the organizations’ “members would otherwise have standing to sue \n3  in their own right.”).  Nor does CASA have standing “to bring this case based on the direct harm it \n4  [allegedly] suffered.”  (ECF 24 at 30.) \n5  Direct organizational standing requires CASA to satisfy “both constitutional and prudential” \n6  requirements.  McMichael v. Napa Cty., 709 F.2d 1268, 1270 (9th Cir. 1983).  CASA “lack[s] prudential \n7  standing because [it is] not within the zone of interests protected by the laws upon which [it] rel[ies].”  \n8  Am. Baptist Churches in the U.S.A. v. Meese, 666 F. Supp. 1358, 1368 (N.D. Cal. 1987).  “[T]he fact \n9  that the refugee organizations are attempting to assert the rights of aliens whom they serve does not \n10  provide any independent basis for standing.”  Id.  Like the non-profit immigrant assistance organization \n11  in Northwest Immigrant Rights Project v. United States Citizenship & Immigration Services, CASA \n12  bases its claimed direct standing on a “different injury [than that of its members]—diversion of scarce \n13  resources—and that [distinct] injury is the toehold that supports [CASA’s alleged direct] standing.”  No. \n14  C15-0813JLR, 2016 WL 5817078, at *12 (W.D. Wash. Oct. 5, 2016).  (See ECF 24 at 30.)  But, CASA \n15  is not within the zone of interests protected by the CAM Parole Program.  See 2016 WL 5817078, at *12 \n16  (concluding that immigrant assistance organization was not within the zone of interests of the “INA and \n17  regulatory provisions”).  See also Immigrant Assistance Project of Los Angeles Cty. Fed’n of Labor \n18  (AFL-CIO) v. I.N.S., 306 F.3d 842, 867 (9th Cir. 2002) (Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 \n19  “did not give organizational plaintiffs standing to sue on their own behalf.”) (emphasis in original).  \n20  Accordingly, because CASA is not within the zone of interests protected by the INA, CASA lacks \n21  standing to proceed with this case on its own behalf.   \n22  Because they lack standing, the claims of both CASA and the alien parole applicants must be \n23  dismissed.   \n24  IV.  THIS COURT LACKS JURISDICTION TO ENJOIN THE PRESIDENT, AND THE \nCLAIMS AGAINST THE PRESIDENT MUST BE DISMISSED.   \n25 \n26  Plaintiffs cannot succeed on their claims against President Trump, and this Court lacks authority \n27  to enter an injunction against the President.  “[T]he Supreme Court has determined that certain \n28  government officials require absolute immunity from liability in order to enable them to function \n  23 \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 32   Filed 08/24/18   Page 32 of 33\n \n \n \n1  independently and effectively, without fear of intimidation or harassment.  Accordingly, the Court has \n2  granted absolute immunity to the President[.]”  Fry v. Melaragno, 939 F.2d 832, 835–36 (9th Cir. 1991).  \n3  “[A]bsolute immunity bars suit when the allegations regarding a President’s conduct are ‘within the \n4  perimeter of his responsibilities as chief of the executive branch,’” as they clearly are here.  Stevens v. \n5  Hayes, No. A-11-CA-550 LY, 2012 WL 2572790, at *12 (W.D. Tex. July 2, 2012), subsequently aff’d, \n6  535 F. App’x 358 (5th Cir. 2013).  Accordingly, this Court lacks jurisdiction to issue an injunction \n7  against the President.  Newdow v. Roberts, 603 F.3d 1002, 1013 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (“With regard to the \n8  President, courts do not have jurisdiction to enjoin him and have never submitted the President to \n9  declaratory relief.”) (internal citations omitted).  As such, plaintiffs will not succeed on their claims \n10  against President Trump and this Court may not enjoin him.  All claims against the President must be \n11  dismissed.   \n12  V.  THE COURT CANNOT ENTER CLASSWIDE, NATIONWIDE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. \n13  Plaintiffs seek a classwide, nationwide preliminary injunction “setting aside termination of the \n14  CAM Parole program . . . and reinstating the program for applicants in the pipeline at the time it was \n15  officially terminated.”  (ECF 24 at 31.)  Even if this Court were to conclude that the named plaintiffs are \n16  entitled to preliminary injunctive relief, it could not provide such relief nationwide, to putative class \n17  members.   \n18  As the Ninth Circuit has made clear, until a class has been certified, an injunction in a putative \n19  class action applies only to the named plaintiffs.  See Zepeda v. I.N.S., 753 F.2d 719, 727-28 n.1 (9th \n20  Cir. 1983) (vacating class-wide preliminary injunction as overbroad, unless and until the district court \n21  certified a class of plaintiffs; “[u]ntil class certification is granted, these plaintiffs are entitled to no more \n22  than protection of themselves alone from the challenged INS practices”); M.R. v. Dreyfus, 697 F.3d 706, \n23  738 (9th Cir. 2012) (enjoining enforcement of regulation only as to named plaintiffs where class \n24  certification motion not yet decided by district court); McCormack v. Hiedeman, 694 F.3d 1004, 1020 \n25  (9th Cir. 2012) (same).  The Court should decline plaintiffs’ invitation to enter a classwide, nationwide \n26  preliminary injunction here.   \n27  VI.  PLAINTIFFS’ COMPLAINT SHOULD BE DISMISSED. \n28  For the reasons set forth above, plaintiffs’ APA, due process, equal protection and equitable \n  24 \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 32   Filed 08/24/18   Page 33 of 33\n \n \n \n1  estoppel claims fail and should be dismissed.  Additionally, as set forth above, the alien parole \n2  applicants, who are nationals of, and currently residing in, either Honduras, El Salvador or Guatemala, \n3  lack Article III standing and should be dismissed as plaintiffs in this litigation.  CASA also lacks direct \n4  standing to sue in its own right and its direct claims should be dismissed.  Finally, as set forth above, the \n5  Court lacks jurisdiction over the claims against President Trump, and all claims against the President \n6  should be dismissed.   \n7    CONCLUSION \n8  For the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction \n9  in its entirety and dismiss plaintiffs’ complaint. \n10   \n11   \n12  DATED:  August 24, 2018  Respectfully submitted, \n13  ALEX G.

The Department of Homeland Security’s (“DHS’s”) decision to mass-rescind conditional \n8  approvals for the approximately 2,700 beneficiaries conditionally approved for parole but \n9  who had not traveled to the United States is vacated.  \n10  2.  DHS must continue the post-conditional-approval processing for the approximately 2,700 \n11  beneficiaries under the policies, guidance, and practices for processing beneficiaries that \n12  it had in place before January 2017, including the procedures described in USCIS’s \n13  publication Central American Minors (CAM) Parole Program: Information for \n14  Conditionally Approved Applicants (Exhibit 48 in the administrative record), and as \n15  further explicated in USCIS’s CAM Parole Project Plan (ECF 93-1).  DHS is enjoined \n16  from adopting any policy, procedure, or practice to not process the approximately 2,700 \n17  beneficiaries or to place their processing on hold en masse.  Nothing in this order \n18  prevents DHS from placing any beneficiary’s processing on hold on an individualized \n19  basis to the extent that it would do so under the policies and procedures it had in place \n20  before January 2017.  \n21  3.  Nothing in this order compels DHS to reach any particular outcome with respect to the \n22  processing of any individual beneficiary or prevents DHS from exercising its discretion \n23  with respect to the parole of any individual beneficiary.  This Order does require DHS to \n24  process the approximately 2,700 beneficiaries in good faith pursuant to the policies, \n25  guidance, and practices it had in place prior to January 2017.  \n26  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, as set forth in the Parties’ Agreement (ECF 90 at 3, 6), the \n27  Court will have continuing jurisdiction to enforce this Injunction and the Parties’ Agreement. \n28     \n[PROPOSED] STIPULATED FINAL JUDGMENT AND ORDER FOR PERMANENT INJUNCTION \nCase No. 18-CV-03539 LB \n    4 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 99   Filed 05/17/19   Page 5 of 5\n \n \n \n1  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, as set forth in the Parties’ Agreement (ECF 90 at 3), each \n2  party shall bear his/her/its own attorneys’ fees and costs. \n3   \n \n4  Dated:    May 17,201 9    \n \n5   \n \n6                     \nHONORABLE LAUREL BEELER \n7  United States Magistrate Judge \n \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n[PROPOSED] STIPULATED FINAL JUDGMENT AND ORDER FOR PERMANENT INJUNCTION \nCase No. 18-CV-03539 LB \n    5 ",

Unless otherwise noted, the information in this report is \ncurrent as of March 20, 2020. \n \nNote: Update on Paragraph 7 Plaintiffs \n  \nFurther to paragraph 7 of the MOA, USCIS agreed to re-open two Plaintiff family cases and consider them for \nparole, specifically, the beneficiaries (1) A.B.’s son; (2) A.B.’s son’s child; (3) H.F.; (4) A.F.; and (5) H.F. and \nA.F.’s mother.  USCIS reopened their cases and has issued them all advance parole documents.  A.B.’s son \ntraveled to the U.S. on October 23, 2019.  He opted not to take his child.  A.F., H.F., and A.F. were issued their \ntransportation letters and traveled to the United States on December 27, 2019. \n \nNote: Impact of coronavirus on CAM processing:  \nIn mid-March, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak resulted in airport closures in Guatemala City, \nSan Salvador, and Tegucigalpa.  On or around March 15, 2020, shortly prior to the airport closures, flight \ncancelations began to affect CAM parolees, causing IOM to cancel planned CAM flights on March 17 and 19 \nand all flights since then.  National governments in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras have also declared \nmandatory stay at home orders.  Though some USCIS staff in those locations are working from home and \ncontinue to process parole cases, locally employed USCIS staff are not reporting to work during this time and \ndo not have telework capability.  USCIS staff are unable to issue travel letters, withdrawal or closure notices \nwhile working from home, though other tasks can be completed from home.  The initial review of completed \nmedicals may also be delayed due to limitations of available personnel resources. The validity period of medical \nexams is determined by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and it is possible that some individuals will have \nthe validity period of their already completed medical exams expire during the closure of airports, such that \nmedical exams may have to be re-done for those individuals.  However, the philanthropic foundation funding \nparolee travel has stated that it will also provide funding for repeat medical exams for individuals whose \nmedical exams expire during the lapse in flights to the U.S.  IOM Operations has also instituted telework and \nwill electronically process as many completed medical exams as possible during this time.  New medical exams \ncannot be scheduled or occur however during this time, with the panel physicians conducting the last medical \nexams on March 17, 2020.     \n \nAssumptions: \n \nAs noted previously in the USCIS operational compliance plan, USCIS will leverage IOM’s expertise and \nresources as it did when the CAM Parole program was previously operating.  The submitted timeline \nrepresented the fastest estimated process assuming all external parties met the estimated milestones, but will be \nupdated as more information becomes available.  The estimated timeline was also based on previous CAM \nparole adjudications, and does not account for unforeseen differences.   \n \n \nTimeline Updates \n \nSteps: Estimated timelines are approximate and may shift depending on unforeseen factors as well as those \nnoted above. \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 104   Filed 03/31/20   Page 4 of 10\nFurther to paragraph 8 of the MOA, USCIS notes the following progress on the Compliance Plan.  For \nreference, USCIS has reproduced the tasks, estimated timeline and comments from the Compliance Plan, and \nprovided a status update and date of completion on each tasking. \n \nStatus updates  \nfor April 1, 2020 Parole Status \nReport* \nCompliance Plan filed on \n*Unless otherwise noted, information current as of March 20, \n April 18, 2019  \n2020 \n   \nEstimated  \nActual \nCompletion \nTask  Timeline   Comments  Completion Date  Comments \nUSCIS will verify  March 21  Completed initial  Completed on May 20.

Parole does not constitute admission in a valid immigration or nonimmigrant \n6  status, but it allows a foreign national to enter and physically be present in the United States. \n7  In 2014, the government instituted a program called the Central American Minors (“CAM”) \n8  Program, which allowed parents who were lawfully present in the United States to apply to bring \n9  their children and other qualifying family members in three countries — Honduras, Guatemala, \n10  and El Salvador, collectively known as the “Northern Triangle” — to reunite with them in the \n11  United States. A goal of the Program was to discourage children from making the long and \n12  dangerous journey from the Northern Triangle to the United States to try to reunite with their \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  parents; the Program sought to achieve this goal by allowing applicant parents to apply for their \nCfi\n tclaC 14  beneficiary children while their children remained in their original countries.1 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  The CAM Program had two components: a refugee component and a parole component. U.S. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”), an agency within the U.S. Department of \nS d nr\nee 17  Homeland Security (“DHS”), first evaluated beneficiaries to see if they qualified for refugee status \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  (which, among other things, requires persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution “on \n19  account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political \n20  opinion”). If the beneficiaries qualified, USCIS referred them for approval as refugees under the \n21  CAM Refugee Program. If they did not qualify, USCIS automatically considered them for parole \n22  into the United States under the CAM Parole Program. \n23 \n24 \n25                                                   \n1 Some documents related to the CAM Program use the term “applicant” to refer to the parents present \n26  in the United States, while others use it to refer to the children or qualifying family members in the \nNorthern Triangle countries. This order uses “applicant” to refer to the parents present in the United \n27  States, “beneficiary” to refer to the children or qualifying family members in the Northern Triangle \ncountries, and “participant” to refer to applicants and beneficiaries.  \n28 \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  3 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 51   Filed 12/10/18   Page 4 of 64\n \n1  By the end of 2016, USCIS had interviewed over 5,500 beneficiaries. It approved 99% for \n2  either refugee resettlement or parole under the CAM Program: it approved approximately 30% \n3  interviewed beneficiaries as refugees and approximately 99% of the remaining beneficiaries (69% \n4  out of 70%) for parole. Over 1,335 beneficiaries arrived in the United States. \n5  In January 2017, following a change in presidential administrations, incoming president \n6  Donald Trump issued an Executive Order that (among other things) directed the Secretary of \n7  Homeland Security to “take all appropriate action” to ensure that DHS exercised its parole \n8  authority “only on a case-by-case basis” and “only when an individual demonstrates urgent \n9  humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit derived from such parole.” DHS stopped \n10  processing CAM Program applications — including the applications for beneficiaries who had \n11  been conditionally approved for parole and were awaiting processing to finalize their \n12  arrangements to travel to the United States — and began a review of the CAM Parole Program. In \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  August 2017, DHS announced that it was terminating the CAM Parole Program. It also announced \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  that it was rescinding parole for the approximately 2,700 beneficiaries who had been conditionally \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  approved for parole but who had not yet traveled to the United States.2 It stated that those \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  individuals, and other individuals who wanted to apply for parole, could still do so independent of \nS d nr\nee 17  the CAM Parole Program but that it would no longer award parole through the Program. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  The plaintiffs in this case — applicant parents lawfully residing in the United States who \n19  applied to the CAM Program, their beneficiary children in Northern Triangle countries, and the \n20  nonprofit immigrant-rights organization CASA — filed this putative class-action lawsuit against \n21  President Trump, DHS, USCIS, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of USCIS, the \n22  State Department, the Secretary of State, and the United States, alleging that the government’s \n23  termination of the CAM Parole Program and its rescinding of conditional approvals of parole were \n24  unlawful. The plaintiffs bring the following four categories of claims:  \n25 \n26 \n                                                 \n27  2 DHS did not rescind parole for any beneficiary who had entered the United States before the time it \nterminated the CAM Parole Program. \n28 \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  4 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 51   Filed 12/10/18   Page 5 of 64\n \n1  1.  claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), arguing that the \n2  government’s termination of the CAM Parole Program and rescinding of conditional \n3  approvals for parole were arbitrary and capricious, \n4  2.  a claim under the Due Process Clause, arguing that the applicant-parent plaintiffs have \n5  a constitutionally protected liberty interest in the companionship and society of their \n6  family members in Central America, and that the government deprived them of this \n7  liberty interest without due process by terminating the CAM Parole Program in an \n8  arbitrary, irrational, and unlawful manner, \n9  3.  a claim under the equal-protection component of the Due Process Clause, arguing that \n10  the government’s termination of the CAM Parole Program was substantially motivated \n11  by discriminatory animus by President Trump and the Trump Administration toward \n12  Latinos, and \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  4.  a claim for equitable estoppel, arguing that the government engaged in affirmative \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  misconduct by publicly representing between January 2017 and August 2017 that the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  CAM Parole Program was still in operation, when it actually had been secretly \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  terminated. \nS d nr\nee 17  The putative class is all applicants and beneficiaries who applied for the CAM Program before \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  August 16, 2017, who were denied refugee status under the CAM Refugee Program, and who then \n19  were denied parole under the CAM Parole Program due to its termination.3 \n20  The plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction (1) enjoining the government from \n21  terminating the CAM Parole Program and (2) requiring the government to reinstate the conditional \n22  approvals of parole that were rescinded pursuant to that termination. The defendants moved to \n23  dismiss the complaint. \n24 \n25 \n                                                 \n26  3 The plaintiffs do not bring any claims with respect to the refugee portion of the CAM Program or any \ngovernment actions regarding that portion. They bring claims only regarding the parole portion. See \n27  Compl. – ECF No. 3 (¶ 3), 40–44 (¶¶ 128–50).

(The court will address the plaintiffs’ \n2  motion for a preliminary injunction in a separate order.) The court denies the motion to dismiss the \n3  plaintiffs’ APA claims as they relate to the government’s mass-rescinding conditional approvals of \n4  parole made under the CAM Parole Program. In all other respects, the court grants the defendants’ \n5  motion to dismiss. \n6   \n7  STATEMENT \n8  1.  The Immigration and Nationality Act and Parole Generally \n9  The INA provides that the Secretary of Homeland Security “may, [subject to certain \n10  exceptions], in [her] discretion parole into the United States temporarily under such conditions as \n11  [s]he may prescribe only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant \n12  public benefit any alien applying for admission to the United States[.]”4 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A). \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  The INA also provides that “such parole of such alien shall not be regarded as an admission of the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  alien[.]” Id. The INA further provides that “when the purposes of such parole shall, in the opinion \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  of the [Secretary], have been served[,] the alien shall forthwith return or be returned to the custody \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  from which he was paroled and thereafter his case shall continue to be dealt with in the same \nS d nr\nee 17  manner as that of any other applicant for admission to the United States.” Id. The Secretary’s \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  parole authority is in turn delegated to various DHS officials. 8 C.F.R. § 212.5(a). \n19   \n20  2.  The Complaint \n21  2.1  September–December 2014: The Creation of the CAM Parole Program \n22  The government first proposed the CAM Program on September 18, 2014, as part of the \n23  President’s annual recommendations to Congress on proposed refugee admissions for the \n24  following year, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1157(d) and (e).5 The annual Presidential Determination on \n25 \n                                                 \n4 Section 1182(d)(5)(A) refers to the Attorney General, but pursuant to 6 U.S.C. § 557, that authority \n26 \nhas now been transferred to the Secretary of Homeland Security.

An individual considered \n10  for parole may be eligible for parole if DHS finds that the individual is at risk of \nharm, he/she clears all background vetting, there is no serious derogatory \n11  information, and someone has committed to financially support the individual \nwhile he/she is in the United States. . . .

Border security is critically important to the national \n seirt security of the United States. Aliens who illegally enter the United States without \ntatsiD 16  inspection or admission present a significant threat to national security and public \nS d nr safety. Such aliens have not been identified or inspected by Federal immigration \nee 17 \ntinhtr officers to determine their admissibility to the United States. The recent surge of \nUo\nN 18  illegal immigration at the southern border with Mexico has placed a significant \nstrain on Federal resources and overwhelmed agencies charged with border security \n19  and immigration enforcement, as well as the local communities into which many of \nthe aliens are placed. \n20 \n. . . . \n21 \nSec. 11.

There are approximately 2,700 \n7 \nindividuals currently conditionally approved.

This termination of the CAM Parole program does not preclude \n11 \nsuch individuals from applying for parole consideration independent of the CAM \n12  Parole program by filing USCIS Form I-131, Application for Travel Document, \na \ntr in consistent with the instructions for that form.

Since that time, DHS conducted a careful review of the Central American \nMinors (CAM) Parole program and has decided to terminate the program. The \n21 \ndecision to terminate the program was made because the CAM Parole program \nprovided parole very broadly and not in accordance with the statu[t]e and the \n22 \nPresident’s Executive Order. \n23 \nQ7: By eliminating this program, do you anticipate there will be an upswing in \nthe number of UACs [unaccompanied alien children] who attempt to enter the \n24 \nUnited States illegally? \n25 \nA7: The CAM Refugee program is unaffected by the termination of the CAM \nParole program and will continue to provide a means through which vulnerable \n26 \nchildren in-country may be considered for resettlement to the United States.

Other Claims \n24  In evaluating the defendants’ motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ non-APA claims, the court is \n25  limited to considering the complaint, documents incorporated into the complaint by reference, and \n26  matters of which it may take judicial notice.

Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555–56 (2007). \n4  A complaint must contain a “short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is \n5  entitled to relief” to give the defendant “fair notice” of what the claims are and the grounds upon \n6  which they rest. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2); Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. A complaint does not need \n7  detailed factual allegations, but “a plaintiff’s obligation to provide the ‘grounds’ of his \n8  ‘entitlement to relief’ requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the \n9  elements of a cause of action will not do. Factual allegations must be enough to raise a claim for \n10  relief above the speculative level[.]” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (citations omitted). \n11  To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual allegations, which \n12  when accepted as true, “‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). “A claim has facial plausibility \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Id. “The plausibility standard is not akin to a \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  ‘probability requirement,’ but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted \nS d nr\nee 17  unlawfully.” Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557). “Where a complaint pleads facts that are \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  merely consistent with a defendant’s liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and \n19  plausibility of ‘entitlement to relief.’” Id.

As the applicant parents are plaintiffs with respect \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  to all of the claims in the complaint and all of the relief sought, their presence is sufficient to \n19  render this case justiciable, and it is unnecessary to address at this juncture whether the \n20  beneficiary-children plaintiffs or CASA independently have standing. \n21   \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25                                                   \n88 Defs.

The facts found were \n7  that the CAM Parole Program was granting parole to virtually all beneficiaries who were \n8  interviewed. The conclusion made was that doing so was not in keeping with the new \n9  administration’s view of the parole statute and its policies on immigration. Whether the court \n10  agrees or disagrees with the government’s conclusion, it is “not empowered to substitute [its] \n11  judgment for that of the agency,” Sierra Club, 510 F.3d at 1022, and it cannot say that the \n12  agency’s actions were arbitrary or capricious. \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  The plaintiffs cite to cases where courts have found that the government’s attempts to \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  terminate aspects of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) or the Temporary \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Protected Status (“TPS”) programs were arbitrary and capricious under the APA and argue that the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  termination of the CAM Parole Program similarly violates the APA.

Cir. filed Aug. 10, 2018). \n11  By claiming that court decisions had left the DACA program legally unsupportable — instead \n12  of saying that it disagreed with DACA based on its own policy choices — DHS tried to rescind \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  the program (which is popular and supported by a majority of Americans) without taking political \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  responsibility for doing so. The DACA courts that have held that DHS’s attempts to terminate \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  DACA were arbitrary and capricious did so in large part because DHS tried to blame the courts for \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  its decision instead of assuming responsibility and accountability itself. As the Ninth Circuit \nS d nr\nee 17  explained: \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  [P]ublic accountability for agency action can only be achieved if the electorate \nknows how to apportion the praise for good measures and the blame for bad ones. \n19 \nWithout knowing the true source of an objectionable agency action, “the public \ncannot ‘determine on whom the blame or the punishment of a pernicious measure, \n20 \nor series of pernicious measures ought really to fall.’” . . . . \n21 \n. . . . When an agency justifies an action solely with an assertion that the law \nprohibits any other course, it shifts responsibility for the outcome from the \n22 \nExecutive Branch to Congress (for making the law in question) or the courts (for \n23  construing it). If the Executive is correct in its interpretation of the law, then the \npublic is correct to blame the other two branches for any resulting problems. But if \n24  the Executive is wrong, then it avoids democratic accountability for a choice that \nwas the agency’s to make all along. . . . “[A]n official cannot claim that the law ties \n25 \nher hands while at the same time denying the courts’ power to unbind her. She may \nescape political accountability or judicial review, but not both.” \n26 \n27 \n28 \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  41 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 51   Filed 12/10/18   Page 42 of 64\n \n1  Regents III, 908 F.3d at 498–99 (citations omitted); accord Batalla Vidal II, 279 F. Supp. 3d at \n2  421 (“This rule . . . ensures that agencies are accountable for their decisions: If an agency makes a \n3  decision on policy grounds, it must say so, not act as if courts have tied its hands.”). \n4  Here, by contrast, the government and DHS are assuming accountability and responsibility for \n5  terminating the CAM Parole Program on policy grounds. This is a crucial distinction. President \n6  Trump announced his new policy on parole in Executive Order 13,767: “It is the policy of the \n7  executive branch to end the abuse of parole and asylum provisions currently used to prevent the \n8  lawful removal of removable aliens.” Exec. Order 13,767, 82 Fed. Reg. at 8795. Secretary Kelly \n9  similarly memorialized that DHS policy’s views were that “[t]he practice of granting parole to \n10  certain aliens in pre-designated categories in order to create immigration programs not established \n11  by Congress, has contributed to a border security crisis, undermined the integrity of the \n12  immigration laws and the parole process, and created an incentive for additional illegal \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  immigration.”107 The government recognized that it was changing policy qua policy.108 The issue \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  that was present in the DACA cases — trying to shift responsibility to the courts for the decision \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  to rescind a popular program instead of the agency itself claiming responsibility — is not present \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  in the same way here. \nS d nr\nee 17  Another factor that distinguishes this case from the DACA cases is that (in the opinion of \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  many DACA courts), the government’s legal assessment and analyses of DACA were wrong as a \n19  matter of law. Regents III, 908 F.3d at 510 (“[B]ecause the Acting Secretary [of Homeland \n20  Security] was . . . incorrect in her belief that DACA was illegal and had to be rescinded, plaintiffs \n21  are likely to succeed in demonstrating that the rescission must be set aside.”); Batalla Vidal II, 279 \n22  F.

By relying on legal analyses that \n6  were wrong as a matter of law, the government’s decision to rescind DACA was necessarily \n7  arbitrary and capricious. Regents III, 908 F.3d at 505 (“[I]t is black letter law that where an agency \n8  purports to act solely on the basis that a certain result is legally required, and that legal premise \n9  turns out to be incorrect, the action must be set aside, regardless of whether the action could have \n10  been justified as an exercise of discretion.”) (emphasis in original); Batalla Vidal II, 279 F.

In this case, the plaintiffs have not identified a similarly fatally \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  flawed legal assessment or analysis by the government. DHS has expressed its view that the better \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  interpretation of the statutory language of the parole statute is that it “appears to strongly counsel \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  in favor of using the parole authority sparingly and only in individual cases where, after careful \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  consideration of the circumstances, parole is necessary because of demonstrated urgent \nS de nre 17  humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.”109 That interpretation is not flawed in the same \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  way that — according to the DACA courts — DHS’s interpretation of the legality of DACA was \n19  flawed. In construing a predecessor version of the parole statute (that did not include the “case-by-\n20  case” requirement that the current version does), the Ninth Circuit held \n21  The legislative history of the parole provision indicates that Congress intended that \ntemporary admission be granted infrequently. . . .

(1965), reprinted in 1965 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3328, 3335).110 Congress reemphasized this view of \n3  parole when it amended the parole statute to restrict the government’s discretion to approve parole \n4  “only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.” Illegal \n5  Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.

In \nrecent years, however, parole has been used increasingly to admit entire categories \n10 \nof aliens who do not qualify for admission under any other category in immigration \n11  law, with the intent that they will remain permanently in the United States. This \ncontravenes the intent of section 212(d)(5), but also illustrates why further, specific \na  12  limitations on the Attorney General’s discretion are necessary. \ntr in\nuoro 13  H.R. Rep. No. 104-469, at 140 (1996). The court cannot say that DHS’s view — that the parole \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  statute counsels in favor of awarding parole sparingly — is legally erroneous, or that its decision \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  to terminate a program that awarded parole broadly was based on a flawed legal analysis in the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  same way that its attempt to terminate DACA were.111 \nS d nr\nee 17  The plaintiffs analogize to the TPS cases, but those are distinguishable too. The TPS program \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  is a humanitarian program that authorizes DHS to temporarily permit nationals from certain \n19  countries to live and work in the United States when an ongoing armed conflict, environmental \n20  disaster, or other conditions prevent the safe return of those persons to their country of origin. See \n21  8 U.S.C. § 1254a(b)(1)(A)–(C). Prior administrations (both Republican and Democratic) evaluated \n22 \n                                                 \n23 \n110 The version of the parole statute in effect at the time that Mason was decided read, “[t]he Attorney \nGeneral may . . . in his discretion parole into the United States temporarily, under such conditions as \n24 \nhe may prescribe for emergent reasons or for reasons deemed strictly in the public interest any alien \napplying for admission to the United States.” Mason, 862 F.2d at 194 (ellipsis in original) (quoting \n25 \n8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5) (1988)). \n26  111 The court expresses no opinion about whether the parole statute prohibits a program such as the \nCAM Parole Program, which awarded parole broadly. It holds only that the Trump Administration’s \n27  view — that programs that award parole broadly are not consistent with the Administration’s reading \nof the parole statute and thus should be terminated — is not based on a legally erroneous analysis. \n28 \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  44 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 51   Filed 12/10/18   Page 45 of 64\n \n1  whether to extend TPS status for countries beyond the period of their initial designation by \n2  considering both the originating conditions that led to the countries’ initial designations and \n3  subsequent intervening events that prevented safe return of the countries’ nationals.

Parole is at the discretion of DHS, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A), and an \n5  application for parole that has not been approved does not engender a reliance interest. See Wong \n6  v.

The costs were discrete, short-term \n8  costs.

It does not otherwise require the \n4  Secretary to consider any particular factors or mandate how the Secretary must weigh competing \n5  interests. Among other things, it does not require the Secretary to consider (1) the general country \n6  conditions in the Northern Triangle or any other country or (2) whether Central American minors \n7  would otherwise decide to journey by land to the United States — neither of which is a “case-by-\n8  case basis” — in deciding what procedures she will establish or terminate for parole applications. \n9  The previous administration might have weighed these considerations more heavily in establishing \n10  the CAM Parole Program, but that does not obligate future administrations to consider and weigh \n11  them similarly. Cf. Organized Vill. of Kake v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 795 F.3d 956, 968 (9th Cir. \n12  2015) (en banc) (“[Agency] was entitled in 2003 to give more weight to socioeconomic concerns \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  than it had in 2001, even on precisely the same record. . . .

The plaintiffs \n22  characterize this as a “secret shutdown” of the Program that was arbitrary and capricious and \n23  violated the notice requirements in 5 U.S.C. § 552. Even if this were the case, DHS’s subsequent \n24  public termination of the CAM Parole Program in August 2017 moots that challenge, at least with \n25  respect to DHS’s decision to terminate the Program going forward. See Util. Air Regulatory Grp. \n26  v. EPA, 744 F.3d 741, 750 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (holding that challenges to agency’s failure to provide \n27  notice of new rule were mooted by agency’s later re-promulgation of the rule with notice, even if \n28  the two rules were identical) (citing Nat.

Setting aside DHS’s “secret shutdown” of \n3  the CAM Parole Program in January 2017 would afford the plaintiffs no relief in light of DHS’s \n4  public termination of the Program in August 2017. The plaintiffs’ objections to the “secret \n5  shutdown,” as they relate to the termination of CAM Parole Program going forward, are moot. \n6  2.2  Rescinding Conditional Approvals of Parole \n7  The analysis is different with respect to DHS’s decision to rescind all conditional approvals of \n8  parole that it issued before it terminated the CAM Parole Program in August 2017. Program \n9  participants who received conditional approvals of parole (and made arrangements based on those \n10  approvals) had more serious reliance interests than individuals who never received approvals. The \n11  court holds that DHS’s failure to take into account and address those more serious reliance \n12  interests when it mass-rescinded parole for those participants was arbitrary and capricious. \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  The government first argues that those participants do not have reliance interests because their \nCfi\n tclaC 14  parole approvals were only “conditional.”124 But as the plaintiffs plead in their complaint and as \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  the administrative record confirms, the only steps following conditional approval to travel to the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  United States and be fully paroled were nondiscretionary ones: the completion of a medical exam, \nS de nre 17  final security checks, and making travel arrangements.125 (By contrast, participants who had never \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18 \n                                                 \n19  124 Defs.

This distinction means that CAM Parole \n2  Program participants with approved applications for parole had “serious reliance interests.” The \n3  government argues that the Secretary of Homeland Security retained discretion to rescind parole \n4  for participants who had conditionally approval.126 But that does not mean that participants with \n5  approval had no reliance interests in their parole. Cf. Batalla Vidal II, 279 F. Supp. 3d at 432 \n6  (while DHS could in its discretion rescind DACA at any time, “it does not follow that \n7  [beneficiaries] had no reliance interests therein, such that Defendants were free to end the DACA \n8  program without considering such interests”) (emphasis in original) (citing Encino Motorcars, 136 \n9  S. Ct. at 2124–26). \n10  The government next argues that it took reliance interests into account because it did not \n11  rescind parole for beneficiaries who had arrived in the United States.127 The court cannot see how \n12  this decision for beneficiaries in the United States takes into account the serious reliance interests \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  of participants with conditional approval who had not arrived or whose family members had not \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  arrived in the United States.

Mot. to Dismiss – ECF No. 32 at 20. \n25 \n127 Id. \n26 \n128 Id. \n27  129 August 2017 Info Sheet – ECF No. 33-6 at 4 (AR000037); Rescission Form Letter – ECF No. \n33-46 at 2 (AR000454). \n28 \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  54 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 51   Filed 12/10/18   Page 55 of 64\n \n1  The court holds that when DHS mass-rescinded the conditional parole approvals of CAM \n2  Parole Program participants, it did not adequately take into account and address the participants’ \n3  serious reliance interests. Consequently, its actions in mass-rescinding approvals were arbitrary \n4  and capricious and must be set aside under the APA. \n5  The “serious reliance interests” requirement does not mean that DHS lacks the authority to \n6  rescind conditional approvals of parole for CAM Parole Program participants, notwithstanding the \n7  participants’ reliance on their approvals. DHS has that authority. It has the authority to rescind \n8  parole even from Program beneficiaries who have arrived in the United States and similarly has \n9  the authority to rescind conditional approvals of applications where the beneficiaries are still \n10  outside the United States. See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A). But DHS must recognize and \n11  acknowledge that Program participants who were approved for parole had serious reliance \n12  interests in that parole, take those reliance interests into account, and explain why it felt it \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  appropriate to nonetheless mass-rescind their parole in the face of that reliance. This ensures \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  transparency and accountability. If DHS thinks that Program participants’ reliance on their parole \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  is less important than its new policies in mass-rescinding that parole, it can make that choice, so \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  long as it explains its reasons so that it can be held accountable. Cf. NAACP, 298 F. Supp. 3d at \nS d nr\nee 17  249 (the government must explain its actions so that “members of the public know how their \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  elected officials have used their enforcement powers, and they can hold those officials accountable \n19  by speaking out, by petitioning their representatives, or ultimately at the ballot box”). \n20  When it mass-rescinded conditional approvals, DHS failed to take into account and address the \n21  serious reliance interests of CAM Parole Program participants whom it had approved. Its mass-\n22  rescission was arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA.130 \n23  *  *  * \n24 \n25                                                   \n130 Because the court finds that DHS’s mass-rescission of parole approvals was arbitrary and \n26  capricious because DHS failed to take into account serious reliance interests, it is unnecessary to \naddress whether the mass-rescission was also arbitrary and capricious because it was impermissibly \n27  retroactive or because it violated DHS’s own guidance and thus ran afoul of the doctrine in United \nStates ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260 (1954). \n28 \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  55 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 51   Filed 12/10/18   Page 56 of 64\n \n1  For the foregoing reasons, the court denies the defendants’ motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ \n2  APA claims as they relate to the government’s mass-rescinding of conditional approvals of parole. \n3  The court otherwise grants the defendants’ motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ APA claims. \n4   \n5  3.  Due Process \n6  The plaintiffs bring a claim on behalf of the plaintiffs in the United States for violation of due \n7  process.131 \n8  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that no person may be “deprived of \n9  life, liberty, or property, without due process of law[.]” U.S. Const. amend. V. “‘A threshold \n10  requirement to a substantive or procedural due process claim is the plaintiff’s showing of a liberty \n11  or property interest protected by the Constitution.’” Regents III, 908 F.3d at 514 (quoting Wedges/\n12  Ledges of Cal., Inc. v. City of Phoenix, 24 F.3d 56, 62 (9th Cir. 1994)). The applicant-parent \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  plaintiffs claim as their protected interest a general constitutional liberty interest in “the \nCfi\n tclaC 14  companionship and society of their family members who are stranded in Central America.”132 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  In Gebhardt v. Nielsen, 879 F.3d 980 (9th Cir. 2018), the Ninth Circuit held that the general \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  right to familial companionship cannot form the basis of a due-process claim for a plaintiff in the \nS d nr\nee 17  United States challenging a government decision not to admit non-citizen family members located \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  outside the United States. The plaintiff in Gebhardt was a U.S. citizen who filed legal-permanent-\n19  resident petitions for his non-citizen wife and her three non-citizen children. Id. at 983. USCIS \n20  approved the petitions initially but then revoked them based on the plaintiff’s criminal conviction \n21  from years earlier. Id. at 983–84. The plaintiff challenged USCIS’s denials of his petition, arguing \n22  that (among other things) “USCIS, by denying his petitions, denied him the fundamental right to \n23  preserve the integrity of his family.” Id. at 988. The Ninth Circuit rejected that argument: \n   \n24 \n25 \n                                                 \n26 \n131 Compl. – ECF No. 1 at 42 (¶ 137). The plaintiffs do not bring a due-process claim on behalf of any \nbeneficiary children outside the United States. See id. \n27 \n132 Id. \n28 \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  56 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 51   Filed 12/10/18   Page 57 of 64\n \n \n1  Plaintiff’s theory is that he has a fundamental right to reside in the United States \nwith his non-citizen relatives. But that theory runs headlong into Congress’ plenary \n2 \npower over immigration. We acknowledge, of course, that individuals have a \nstrong interest in living with their family members. But that interest cannot be so \n3 \nfundamental that it overrides Congress’ plenary power in this domain. As we have \n4  said before, the generic right to live with family is “far removed” from the specific \nright to reside in the United States with non-citizen family members. . . . We \n5  therefore conclude that Plaintiff’s substantive due process claim is not colorable, \nand we decline to consider it further. \n6 \n7  Id. (citations omitted). So too here. The applicant-parent plaintiffs’ right to familial \n8  companionship for their non-citizen children located outside the United States does not give rise to \n9  a protected interest that can form the basis of a due-process claim.133 \n10  The plaintiffs’ authorities do not change this conclusion. The plaintiffs cite Justice Kennedy’s \n11  concurring opinion in Kerry v. Din, 135 S. Ct. 2128 (2015), for the proposition that they have a \n12  protected interest.134 In Din, the government denied an immigrant visa to the husband of a U.S. \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  citizen. Id. at 2131 (plurality op.). The husband was a citizen and resident of Afghanistan. Id. The \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  U.S.-citizen spouse challenged the denial because the government did not explain its reasons for \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  the denial. Id. at 2131–32. The Ninth Circuit reversed the district court’s order dismissing the case. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Id. The Supreme Court then reversed the Ninth Circuit. Id. at 2138. In his concurring opinion, \nS d nr\nee 17  Justice Kennedy assumed for the sake of argument that the U.S. citizen plaintiff in the United \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  States had a protected interest in the visa application of her non-U.S. citizen spouse and concluded \n19  that the government had provided her with sufficient due process in any event. Id. at 2139 \n20  (Kennedy, J., concurring). He expressly refrained from deciding the protected-interest issue, \n21 \n                                                 \n22 \n133 Gebhardt addresses the issue of the constitutional right to familial companionship specifically in \nthe context of a plaintiff located in the United States and his non-citizen family members located \n23 \noutside the United States who were not separated due to any government action. The other cases that \nthe plaintiffs cite are inapposite because they address familial companionship in the context of families \n24 \nwho were all originally present in the United States and were separated by the government’s actions. \nCf. Rosenbaum v. Washoe Cty., 663 F.3d 1071, 1074–75, 1079–80 (9th Cir. 2011) (family members \n25 \nwho were together in the United States were separated allegedly by the government’s actions); Kelson \nv. City of Springfield, 767 F.2d 651, 653–55 (9th Cir. 1985) (same); Morrison v. Jones, 607 F.2d 1269, \n26 \n1271–73, 1275 (9th Cir. 1979) (same). \n27  134 The Ninth Circuit has adopted Justice Kennedy’s concurring opinion as the binding opinion in Din. \nCardenas v. United States, 826 F.3d 1164, 1171–72 (9th Cir. 2016). \n28 \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  57 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 51   Filed 12/10/18   Page 58 of 64\n \n1  writing that “[t]oday’s disposition should not be interpreted as deciding whether a citizen has a \n2  protected liberty interest in the visa application of her alien spouse.” Id. That opinion thus does not \n3  bear on the issue here. \n4  The plaintiffs also cite Bustamante v. Mukasey, 531 F.3d 1059 (9th Cir. 2008), which involved \n5  a U.S.-citizen wife who brought a due-process claim after the government denied her non-citizen \n6  husband an immigrant visa. But the source of the protected interest at issue there was not a general \n7  constitutional liberty interest in familial companionship. Instead, the protected interest was \n8  statutory: a U.S. citizen’s statutorily created entitlement to an immigration visa for his or her \n9  spouse. See Ching v. Mayorkas, 725 F.3d 1149, 1155–56 (9th Cir. 2013) (“[G]rant of an I-130 \n10  petition for immediate relative status is a nondiscretionary decision. Immediate relative status for \n11  an alien spouse is a right to which citizen applicants are entitled as long as the petitioner and \n12  spouse beneficiary meet the statutory and regulatory requirements for eligibility. This protected \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  interest is entitled to the protections of due process.”) (citing Bustamante, 531 F.3d at 1061–62, \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  and other authorities). Because the plaintiff in Bustamante satisfied the threshold requirement of \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  having a protected interest in a visa for her husband, the Ninth Circuit addressed the second \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  question: whether the government had deprived her of that interest without sufficient procedural \nS d nr\nee 17  protections. Bustamante, 531 F.3d at 1062. Bustamante thus does not bear on the question here: \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  whether the applicant-parent plaintiffs have a protected interest. \n19  By contrast to the spousal immigrant visas in Bustamante, there is no statutorily created \n20  protected interest in parole. Wong, 373 F.3d at 968 (“The INA does not create any liberty interest \n21  in temporary parole that is protected by the Fifth Amendment. Rather, the statute makes clear that \n22  whether and for how long temporary parole is granted are matters entirely within the discretion of \n23  the [Secretary of Homeland Security].”); Munoz v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 950, 954 (9th Cir. 2003) \n24  (“Since discretionary relief is a privilege created by Congress, denial of such relief cannot violate \n25  a substantive interest protected by the Due Process Clause.”); Regents II, 298 F. Supp. 3d at 1310 \n26  (“Our court of appeals has accordingly held there is no protected interest in temporary parole, \n27  since such relief is ‘entirely within the discretion of the [Secretary of Homeland Security].’ . . . \n28  [This] foreclose[s] any argument that plaintiffs have a protected interest in . . . advance parole[.]”) \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  58 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 51   Filed 12/10/18   Page 59 of 64\n \n1  (citing Wong, 373 F.3d at 967–68). And Gebhardt forecloses the argument that a general \n2  constitutional right to familial companionship gives rise to a protected interest in this context. \n3  Because the plaintiffs have not made a threshold showing that they have a protected liberty or \n4  property interest, the court dismisses their due-process claim. \n5   \n6  4.  Equal Protection \n7  The plaintiffs bring a claim on behalf of the plaintiffs in the United States for violation of \n8  equal protection.135 \n9  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment incorporates a guarantee of equal protection \n10  and prohibits unjustified discrimination by federal actors. United States v. Navarro, 800 F.3d \n11  1104, 1112 n.6 (9th Cir. 2015) (citing Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 498–99 (1954)). Courts \n12  assess equal-protection claims against federal actors under the Fifth Amendment in the same way \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  that they assess equal-protection claims against state actors under the Fourteenth Amendment. Id. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  (citing Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S. 636, 638 n.2 (1975)). The plaintiffs argue that the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  government’s termination of the CAM Parole Program and its mass-rescission of conditional \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  approvals of parole violate equal protection because the decisions were substantially motivated by \nS d nr\nee 17  discriminatory intent and animus against Latinos, as evidenced by President Trump’s history of \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  purported slurs and epithets toward Latinos.136 \n19  The termination of the CAM Parole Program and the rescission of conditional approvals of \n20  parole affect the admission of foreign nationals into the United States.137 As the Supreme Court \n21  held in Trump v. Hawaii, “a circumscribed inquiry applies to any constitutional claim concerning \n22  the entry of foreign nationals.” Trump, 138 S. Ct. at 2420 n.5. \n23 \n24                                                   \n135 Compl. – ECF No. 1 at 43 (Count IV header). The plaintiffs do not bring an equal-protection claim \n25  on behalf of any beneficiary children outside the United States. See id. \n136 Id. (¶¶ 144–45). \n26 \n137 The government did not rescind parole for beneficiaries who were in the United States at the time it \n27  terminated the CAM Parole Program. See Termination of the Central American Minors Parole \nProgram, 82 Fed. Reg. at 38,927. \n28 \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  59 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 51   Filed 12/10/18   Page 60 of 64\n \n1  The Trump case is instructive here. That case involved a challenge to the government’s so-\n2  called “travel ban,” a presidential proclamation limiting entry by foreign nationals from eight \n3  countries; most of the countries are predominately Muslim. Trump, 138 S. Ct. at 2405. The \n4  plaintiffs there argued that the primary purpose of the proclamation was to discriminate against \n5  Muslims. Id. at 2417. In support of their discrimination claims and as evidence of religious bias \n6  against Muslims, the plaintiffs cited purportedly anti-Muslim statements that President Trump \n7  made. Id. \n8  In rejecting the plaintiffs’ challenge, the Supreme Court wrote that “[f]or more than a century, \n9  this Court has recognized that the admission and exclusion of foreign nationals is a ‘fundamental \n10  sovereign attribute exercised by the Government’s political departments largely immune from \n11  judicial control.’” Trump, 138 S. Ct. at 2418 (quoting Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U.S. 787, 792 (1977)). \n12  The Court acknowledged that “although foreign nationals seeking admission have no \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  constitutional right to entry, this Court has engaged in a circumscribed judicial inquiry when the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  denial of a visa allegedly burdens the constitutional rights of a U.S. citizen.” Id. at 2419. “But [the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Court] limited [its] review to whether the Executive gave a ‘facially legitimate and bona fide’ \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  reason for its action.” Id. (quoting Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753, 769 (1972)). “Given the \nS d nr\nee 17  authority of the political branches over admission, [the Court] held that ‘when the Executive \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  exercises this delegated power negatively on the basis of a facially legitimate and bona fide \n19  reason, the courts will neither look behind the exercise of that discretion, nor test it by balancing \n20  its justification’ against the asserted constitutional interests of U.S. citizens.” Id. (internal brackets \n21  omitted) (quoting Kleindienst, 408 U.S. at 770). \n22  The test that the Supreme Court applied in evaluating the presidential proclamation was \n23  whether “it is impossible to ‘discern a relationship to legitimate state interests’” and “the policy is \n24  ‘inexplicable by anything but animus.’” Id. at 2420–21. The Court held that the proclamation was \n25  premised on legitimate purposes, namely, “preventing entry of [foreign] nationals who cannot be \n26  adequately vetted and inducing other nations to improve their practices.” Id. at 2421. The Court \n27  upheld the proclamation as “a facially neutral policy denying certain foreign nationals the \n28  privilege of admission.” Id. at 2423. \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  60 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 51   Filed 12/10/18   Page 61 of 64\n \n1  While the Court considered President Trump’s statements about Muslims, see id. at 2420, it \n2  declined to credit the plaintiffs’ argument that President Trump’s statements supported a \n3  constitutional challenge to the proclamation: \n4  The entry suspension is an act that is well within executive authority and could \nhave been taken by any other President — the only question is evaluating the \n5 \nactions of this particular President in promulgating an otherwise valid \nProclamation. . . . [T]he Government has set forth a sufficient national security \n6 \njustification to survive rational basis review. We express no view on the soundness \n7  of the policy. We simply hold today that plaintiffs have not demonstrated a \nlikelihood of success on the merits of their constitutional claim. \n8 \n9  Id. at 2423. \n10  The plaintiffs’ challenge here to the termination of the CAM Parole Program is analogous to \n11  the Trump plaintiffs’ challenge to the presidential proclamation. In both cases, plaintiffs residing \n12  in the United States challenge government policies that prevent their foreign relatives from \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  entering the United States.138 In both cases, “[i]t cannot be said that it is impossible to ‘discern a \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  relationship to legitimate state interests’ or that the policy is ‘inexplicable by anything but \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  animus.’” Cf. Trump, 138 S. Ct. at 2420–21. The government’s view is that parole should be used \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  “sparingly and only in individual cases” and that “[t]he practice of granting parole to certain aliens \nS d nr\nee 17  in pre-designated categories in order to create immigration programs not established by Congress, \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  has contributed to a border security crisis, undermined the integrity of the immigration laws and \n19  the parole process, and created an incentive for additional illegal immigration.”139 These are \n20  facially legitimate and bona fide reasons for terminating the CAM Parole Program. Cf. Jeanty v. \n21  Bulger, 204 F. Supp. 2d 1366, 1377–78, 1381 (S.D. Fla. 2002) (finding that discouraging mass \n22  migration of Haitians to the United States by applying parole criteria in a more restrictive manner \n23  was a “facially legitimate and bona fide reason[]” for changing from a policy of favoring parole \n24 \n                                                 \n138 While the plaintiffs here are bringing an equal-protection claim under the Fifth Amendment, and \n25 \nthe plaintiffs in Trump brought an Establishment Clause claim under the First Amendment, the \nSupreme Court “ha[s] reaffirmed and applied its deferential standard of review across different \n26 \ncontexts and constitutional claims.” Trump, 138 S. Ct. at 2419. \n27  139 See Kelly Memo – ECF No. 33-5 at 10 (AR000030); accord Exec. Order 13,767, 82 Fed.

Moise v. Bulger, 321 F.3d 1336 (11th Cir. 2003). Because the government has \n3  facially legitimate and bona fide reasons for terminating the CAM Parole Program, here, as in \n4  Trump, the court cannot “look behind the exercise of that discretion, nor test it by balancing its \n5  justification’ against the asserted [equal-protection] constitutional interests of [the plaintiffs].” Cf. \n6  Trump, 138 S. Ct. at 2419 (quoting Kleindienst, 408 U.S. at 770).140 \n7  Citing cases that do not involve the admission of foreign nationals into the United States, the \n8  plaintiffs argue that the court should infer from President Trump’s anti-Latino statements that the \n9  government acted with discriminatory animus and thus violated their equal-protection rights. Their \n10  arguments might carry more weight in the context of a program like the DACA or TPS programs \n11  that involve only individuals located in the United States. Cf. Regents III, 908 F.3d at 518–20 \n12  (plaintiffs could plausibly plead an equal-protection that the government’s decision to terminate \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  the DACA program was based on racial animus based on President Trump’s anti-Latino \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  statements); Ramos I, 321 F. Supp. 3d at 1131–32 (same re the TPS program); Ramos II, __ F. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Supp. 3d __, 2018 WL 4778285, at *16–21 (same re the TPS program). But unlike the DACA or \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  TPS programs, the CAM Parole Program involves the admission of foreign nationals presently \nS d nr\nee 17  outside the United States into the United States, and the court’s review of constitutional equal-\nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  protection claims thus is circumscribed. Trump, 138 S. Ct. at 2418–20 & n.5; cf. Regents III, 908 \n19  F.3d at 520 (“[DACA] differs from [Trump v.] Hawaii in several potentially important respects, \n20 \n                                                 \n140 The plaintiffs argue that these reasons do not match the government’s actions in terminating the \n21 \nCAM Parole Program because, they allege, the Program operated on a case-by-case basis. Pls. Mot. to \nDismiss Opp’n – ECF No. 34 at 24. But the plaintiffs do not plead that the Program granted parole \n22 \n“sparingly,” that it granted parole “only in individual cases,” or that it did not “grant[] parole to certain \naliens in pre-designated categories in order to create immigration programs not established by \n23 \nCongress.” Contrary to the plaintiffs’ claims, there is no mismatch between the government’s view \nthat parole should be granted sparingly and not used to create an immigration program not established \n24 \nby Congress and its decision to terminate the CAM Parole Program. \n25    The plaintiffs also try to distinguish Trump by arguing that it was decided on a preliminary-injunction \nmotion, not a motion to dismiss. Pls. Mot. to Dismiss Opp’n – ECF No. 34 at 23–24. They cite no \n26  authorities to support their argument that a court cannot decide the question of whether the government \nhas “facially legitimate and bona fide reasons” on a motion to dismiss. Cf., e.g., Bustamante, 531 F.3d \n27  at 1062–63 (evaluating whether government had a “facially legitimate and bona fide reason” for \ndenying visa on a motion to dismiss). \n28 \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  62 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 51   Filed 12/10/18   Page 63 of 64\n \n1  including the physical location of the plaintiffs within the geographic United States”) (citing \n2  Lopez-Valenzuela v.

The plaintiffs’ general equal-protection cases are inapposite \n9  here. \n10  The government has facially legitimate and bona fide reasons for terminating the CAM Parole \n11  Program. Because the court cannot test those reasons by balancing them against the plaintiffs’ \n12  constitutional interests, cf. Trump, 138 S.

Equitable Estoppel \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  The parties dispute whether equitable estoppel can be pleaded as an affirmative claim or \nS de nre 17  whether it is only an affirmative defense.141 The court need not resolve this question because the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  plaintiffs have not pleaded the elements of equitable estoppel as either a claim or defense. \n19  Equitable estoppel requires that (among other things) the government engaged in “affirmative \n20  misconduct,” which the Ninth Circuit has defined to mean a “deliberate lie” or “a pattern of false \n21  promises.” Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176, 1184 (9th Cir. 2001) (en banc) (citing \n22  Mukherjee v. INS, 793 F.2d 1006, 1008 (9th Cir. 1986)). “Negligently providing misinformation to \n23  an alien does not meet this definition” and thus is insufficient to plead equitable estoppel. Id. \n24 \n25                                                   \n141 Compare Defs. Mot. to Dismiss – ECF No. 32 at 25 (“‘Equitable Estoppel is not an affirmative \n26  claim, but rather an affirmative defense.’”) (quoting Johnson v. Mazza, No. 2:15-cv-09183-ODW(AS), \n2016 WL 5842186, at *4 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 4, 2016)) with Pls. Mot. to Dismiss Opp’n – ECF No. 34 at \n27  24 (“Ninth Circuit precedent recognizes an affirmative cause of action for equitable estoppel.”) (citing \nWatkins v. U.S. Army, 875 F.2d 699 (9th Cir. 1989) (en banc)). \n28 \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  63 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 51   Filed 12/10/18   Page 64 of 64\n \n1  The plaintiffs allege that during the time between January and August 2017, when the \n2  government was purportedly engaged in a “secret shutdown” of the CAM Parole Program, \n3  (1) government web pages continued to represent that the Program was active and that participants \n4  should not delay in paying for plane tickets,142 and (2) IOM contacted participants to solicit and \n5  accept payments for plane tickets.143 This does not plead a deliberate lie or a pattern of false \n6  promises on the part of the government, as opposed to (for example) the government’s negligently \n7  failing to update its websites and inform IOM of the purported shutdown (or IOM’s not getting the \n8  message and inadvertently providing participants with incorrect information). The plaintiffs have \n9  not pleaded that the government engaged in a deliberate lie or a pattern of false promises, and the \n10  court thus dismisses their equitable-estoppel claim. \n11   \n12  CONCLUSION \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  The court grants in part and denies in part the defendants’ motion to dismiss. The court denies \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  the motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ APA claims as they relate to the government’s mass-\ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  rescinding conditional approvals of parole made under the CAM Parole Program. In all other \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  respects, the court grants the defendants’ motion to dismiss.144 \nS d nr\nee 17   \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n19  Dated: December 10, 2018 \n20  ______________________________________ \nLAUREL BEELER \n21 \nUnited States Magistrate Judge \n22 \n23 \n24 \n                                                 \n25  142 Compl. – ECF No. 1 at 21–22 (¶¶ 57–60). \n143 Id. at 20 (¶¶ 54–55). \n26 \n144 Because the court grants the defendants’ motion to dismiss with respect to all claims other than a \n27  portion of the APA claims and President Trump is not named as a defendant in the APA claims, the \ncourt does not address the defendants’ arguments regarding naming the president as a defendant. \n28 \nORDER – No. 18-cv-03539-LB  64 ",

Over the years, the CAM \n6  Program enabled thousands of Central American parents lawfully residing in the United States to \n7  safely and legally bring their children to the United States as refugees or parolees through an \n8  orderly process in which eligibility determinations were made in the minors’ home countries.   \n9  2. This Administration’s highly erratic and unexplained termination of the CAM Parole \n10  program, which began with secretly shutting down its operations immediately after inauguration \n11  and culminated with the mass rescission of conditional approval for parole status for nearly 3,000 \n12  children in August 2017, can only be understood as another one of this Administration’s cruel and \n13  xenophobic policies against people it has publicly labeled “animals.” \n14  3. The termination of the CAM Parole program pulled the rug out from under Plaintiffs \n15  and proposed class members—thousands of families who had spent years and thousands of dollars \n16  in reliance on the availability of this safe pathway to family reunification, and thousands of whom \n17  had attained conditional approval for parole status and believed they would imminently travel.  \n18  Plaintiffs include U.S.-based parents and their children in Central America who completed every \n19  step of the application process, including paying for plane tickets to come to the United States.  \n20  They include a teenage girl who was forced to drop out of high school a few months shy of her \n21  graduation because an MS-13 gang member was trying to forcibly “date” her and she feared being \n22  raped or killed.  They include a teenage boy who was beaten so badly by the MS-13 after he refused \n23  to join the gang that he needed emergency surgery and still has trouble walking and bathing himself.  \n24  They include a teenage boy whose uncle was shot and killed by the MS-13 right outside the boy’s \n25  home, and now the gang has repeatedly threatened to do the same to him.  They include Central \n26  American parents who have lived lawfully in the United States for decades, including in Northern \n27  California, are raising U.S. citizen children, have earned state professional licenses, and have spent \n28  years and sometimes decades at jobs in the U.S. as teacher’s assistants, butchers, and mechanics. \n-1- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 4 of 46\n1  4. Meanwhile, the life-threatening conditions in the Central American countries that led \n2  to the creation of the CAM Program have not abated.  Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala—\n3  sometimes called “the Northern Triangle”—are among the countries with the highest child \n4  homicide rates in the world.  Just in the past month, a refugee “caravan,” including children from \n5  these countries fleeing violence and seeking asylum, arrived at the Southern border of the United \n6  States.  The caravan was organized to raise awareness of the conditions in the Northern Triangle \n7  countries and to protect the migrants from the dangers they would otherwise face on the journey to \n8  the U.S. border—a journey that the CAM Program had made unnecessary for thousands of children.   \n9  5. Having shut down the CAM Program’s pathway to safety for Central Americans, the \n10  Trump Administration is now turning away Central Americans seeking to apply for asylum at ports \n11  of entry and prosecuting those who desperately attempt to enter the border illegally.  In short, \n12  President Trump has acted on his promise to get Central Americans out of the United States by \n13  trying to shut down every possible avenue for relief for people, often children, fleeing the \n14  humanitarian crisis in their home countries.   \n15  6. When the CAM Parole program was terminated, the Trump Administration told \n16  many of the named Plaintiffs and the proposed class members that they could request review of the \n17  denial of their refugee applications under the CAM Program.  But with only a few months left to \n18  this fiscal year, many who have requested review of their denials have not yet received a response—\n19  raising the prospect and the fear that this final opportunity to safely reach the United States will also \n20  be foreclosed.  \n21  7. The termination of the CAM Parole program violated, among other things, the \n22  Administrative Procedure Act and the Fifth Amendment guarantees of Due Process and Equal \n23  Protection.  Individual Plaintiffs, along with CASA, request that the Court set aside the termination \n24  of the CAM Parole program and the mass rescission of conditional approval for parole, and thereby \n25  restore the important, historic American tradition of protecting and aiding the most vulnerable \n26  people fleeing perilous circumstances abroad.  \n27  // \n28  // \n-2- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 5 of 46\n1  PARTIES \n2  8. Plaintiffs S.A. and J.A. are a family.  Plaintiff S.A. is a national of El Salvador and a \n3  lawful resident of Concord, California, where she has worked for the same small business for 12 \n4  years.  S.A. was eligible to apply for the CAM Program and in August 2015 submitted an \n5  application on behalf of her biological daughter, J.A., who was then 20 years old, and her \n6  daughter’s baby son, who was then a year old.  J.A. and her son are both nationals and residents of \n7  El Salvador.  They were conditionally approved for parole and progressed through every stage of \n8  the CAM application process, including paying thousands of dollars for plane tickets.  They never \n9  traveled, however, because their conditional approval for parole was rescinded when the CAM \n10  Parole program was publicly terminated in August 2017.  Soon after learning that her family would \n11  not be able to reunite with her, S.A. was diagnosed with breast cancer and has gone through surgery \n12  and multiple rounds of radiation without the support and assistance of her daughter. \n13  9. Plaintiff A.B. is a national of El Salvador and a lawful resident of San Jose, \n14  California, where he is raising a U.S. citizen child and has been working as a cashier at a local \n15  Safeway for 15 years.  A.B. was eligible to apply for the CAM Program and in November 2015 \n16  submitted an application on behalf of his biological son who is a national and resident of El \n17  Salvador and who was 20 years old at the time of application.  After President Trump’s \n18  inauguration, A.B.’s son’s application process ground to a halt, and a year later, he was denied \n19  refugee status and not considered for parole status because the CAM Parole program had been \n20  terminated.  A.B.’s son has been repeatedly threatened and robbed by members of the MS-13, \n21  which is very active in his community. \n22  10. Plaintiffs R.C., M.C., and J.C. are a family.  Plaintiff R.C. is a national of El \n23  Salvador and a lawful resident of Oxnard, California, where he is raising three U.S. citizen children \n24  and has been working for the same company as a celery packer for ten years.  R.C. was eligible to \n25  apply for the CAM Program and in May 2016 submitted applications on behalf of his three \n26  biological children who are nationals and residents of El Salvador, including M.C., who at the time \n27  was 17 years old, and J.C., who at the time was 14 years old.  The three children were conditionally \n28  approved for parole and had progressed through every stage of the CAM application process, \n-3- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 6 of 46\n1  including receiving a travel date of February 20 after R.C. paid thousands of dollars for their plane \n2  tickets.  They never traveled, however, because their conditional approval for parole was rescinded \n3  when the CAM Parole program was publicly terminated.  Around the time that the family learned \n4  about the rescission of their conditional approval, J.C. was brutally attacked by MS-13 gang \n5  members and required emergency surgery.  M.C. has been aggressively pursued by an MS-13 gang \n6  member demanding that she “date” him, and she has been forced to drop out of school.   \n7  11. Plaintiff D.D. is a national of El Salvador and a lawful resident of Hyattsville, \n8  Maryland, where she is raising a U.S. citizen son and has been working as a licensed teacher’s \n9  assistant at a day care.  She was eligible to apply for the CAM Program and in May 2015 submitted \n10  an application on behalf of her biological daughter who is a national and resident of El Salvador and \n11  who at the time was 15 years old.  D.D.’s daughter was conditionally approved for parole and \n12  progressed through every stage of the CAM application process, including receiving a travel date of \n13  February 13, 2017 after D.D. paid more than a thousand dollars for her plane ticket.  D.D.’s \n14  daughter never traveled, however, because her conditional approval for parole was revoked when \n15  the CAM Parole program was publicly terminated.  D.D.’s daughter remains in El Salvador and \n16  remains at risk. \n17  12. Plaintiffs G.E. and B.E. are a family.  G.E. is a national of El Salvador and a lawful \n18  resident of Montgomery Village, Maryland, where he is raising two U.S. citizen children and has \n19  been working as a mechanic at the same car shop for more than six years.  He was eligible to apply \n20  for the CAM Program and in December 2015 submitted an application on behalf of his biological \n21  son who is a national and resident of El Salvador and who at the time was 15 years old.  B.E. was \n22  conditionally approved for parole and was waiting for his medical exam—which G.E. paid for—to \n23  be scheduled when President Trump was inaugurated and processing on his application stopped.  \n24  B.E.’s conditional approval for parole was revoked when the CAM Parole program was publicly \n25  terminated.  B.E. has been repeatedly threatened by MS-13 gang members and leaves his home as \n26  little as possible.  \n27  13. Plaintiffs J.F., H.F., and A.F. are a family.  J.F. is a national of Honduras and a \n28  lawful resident of Jamaica, New York where he has been working at the same restaurant for two \n-4- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 7 of 46\n1  decades.  He was eligible to apply for the CAM Program and in June 2016 submitted an application \n2  on behalf of his biological daughters, H.F. and A.F., and his wife—their biological mother—who \n3  are nationals and residents of Honduras.  At the time of application, H.F. was 4 years old, and A.F. \n4  was an infant.  After President Trump was inaugurated, J.F.’s family waited almost a year for a \n5  decision on their applications, and then they were deemed ineligible for refugee resettlement and \n6  not considered for parole.  While waiting for the decision on their applications, MS-13 gang \n7  members threatened J.F.’s wife at her job.   \n8  14. Plaintiff CASA is a nonprofit advocacy and assistance organization headquartered in \n9  Langley Park, Maryland, with offices in Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania.  Founded in 1985, \n10  CASA is the largest membership-based immigrant rights organization in the mid-Atlantic region, \n11  with more than 90,000 members.  Its mission is to create a more just society by building power and \n12  improving the quality of life in low-income immigrant communities.  Seeing in the CAM Program \n13  the opportunity to advance its mission by lawfully uniting its members with their children living in \n14  the Northern Triangle, CASA helped 235 of its members to apply for CAM.  Through its \n15  investment of significant staff and volunteer time and resources to assist its members, CASA \n16  developed substantial expertise in the CAM Program.  CASA continued to expend staff and \n17  volunteer time assisting members with the CAM Program following the unannounced shutdown of \n18  the CAM Program.  Following the announcement of the termination of the program and mass \n19  rescission of conditional approval for parole, CASA had to expend further staff and volunteer time \n20  and resources counseling CAM applicants on their options, and had to redirect staff and resources \n21  elsewhere.  At least two of CASA’s members submitted CAM applications for their family \n22  members, the family members were conditionally approved for parole, and their parole was \n23  rescinded by Defendants.  Moreover, CASA suffered reputational harm due to the CAM termination \n24  and mass rescission; CAM applicants frustrated that their time and money was wasted directed their \n25  anger at CASA.  As a result of the termination of the CAM Program and the mass rescission of \n26  conditional approval for parole status, CASA suffered in a way sufficient to establish organizational \n27  standing and associational standing on behalf of its members. \n28  15. Defendant Donald J. Trump is the President of the United States.  He is sued in his \n-5- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 8 of 46\n1  official capacity. \n2  16. Defendant United States Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) is a \n3  Department of the Executive Branch of the United States Government and is an agency within the \n4  meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(f)(l).  Along with Defendant United States Department of State \n5  (“DOS”), it is jointly responsible for administering the CAM Program.   \n6  17. Defendant United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) is an \n7  Operational and Support Component agency within DHS.  USCIS is the DHS sub-agency \n8  responsible for making determinations on CAM applications and for processing cases in the CAM \n9  Program generally and in the CAM Parole program.  \n10  18. Defendant DOS is a Department of the Executive Branch of the United States \n11  Government and is an agency within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(f)(l).  Along with Defendant \n12  DHS, it is jointly responsible for administering the CAM Program.  DOS has contracted the \n13  International Organization for Migration (“IOM”) to run the United States Government’s \n14  Resettlement Support Center in Latin America, which is responsible for processing CAM \n15  applications.   \n16  19. Defendant Kirstjen Nielsen is the Secretary of Homeland Security.  She oversees \n17  DHS.  She is sued in her official capacity. \n18  20. Defendant Michael R. Pompeo is the Secretary of State.  He oversees DOS.  He is \n19  sued in his official capacity. \n20  21. Defendant L. Francis Cissna is the Acting Director of U.S. Citizenship and \n21  Immigration Services.  He oversees USCIS.  He is sued in his official capacity. \n22  22. Defendant United States of America includes all government agencies and \n23  departments responsible for the termination of the CAM Parole program and mass rescission of \n24  conditional approval for parole. \n25  JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n26  23. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because this action arises \n27  under the Constitution and laws of the United States.  This Court has additional remedial authority \n28  under the Declaratory Judgment Act, see 28 U.S.C. § 2201 et seq., and the Administrative \n-6- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 9 of 46\n1  Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706. \n2  24. The federal government has waived its sovereign immunity and permitted judicial \n3  review of agency action pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 702.  See Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) v. United \n4  States, 870 F.2d 518, 525 (9th Cir. 1989).  Sovereign immunity does not bar claims against federal \n5  officials which seek only to prevent future violations of federal law, rather than monetary relief.  \n6  See, e.g., Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 697-99 & nn. 18-19 \n7  (1949); Shields v. Utah Idaho Cent. R. Co., 305 U.S. 177, 183-84 (1938). \n8  25. Venue is proper in the Northern District of California pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n9  § 1391(e)(1) because at least one plaintiff resides in this judicial district and each defendant is an \n10  agency of the United States or an officer of the United States sued in his or her official capacity. \n11  INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT \n12  26. A substantial part of the events or omissions which give rise to the claim occurred in \n13  each of Santa Clara County and Contra Costa County, given that at least one of the plaintiffs resides \n14  in each such county.  Accordingly, for purposes of Civil Local Rule 3-2(c) and 3-5(b), this case may \n15  be assigned to the San Francisco, Oakland, or San Jose Division.\n16 \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n17 \nTHE CAM PROGRAM WAS CREATED \n18  TO RESPOND TO A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS FOR CHILDREN \n19  27. DOS and DHS proposed and implemented the CAM Program in 2014 as part of a \n20  multi-prong effort to respond to a humanitarian crisis for children in the Americas and an \n21  unprecedented rise in the number of unaccompanied Central American children crossing the border \n22  between Mexico and the United States.   \n23  28. Beginning in 2012, the number of unaccompanied children from the Northern \n24  Triangle countries attempting to cross the southern U.S. border rose exponentially.  In the years \n25  preceding 2012, approximately 4,000 unaccompanied children from Northern Triangle countries \n26  were apprehended at the southern border each year.  In 2012, that number more than doubled, and \n27  by 2014, more than 50,000 unaccompanied children from the Northern Triangle countries were \n28  stopped at the border.  Many of these children were younger than 12.  A significant portion of these \n-7- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 10 of 46\n1  children were seeking to reunify with parents or other family members present in the United States. \n2  29. The overland journey from Central America through Mexico and into the United \n3  States is extremely dangerous.  While some immigrant smugglers, or “coyotes,” deliver migrants to \n4  their destinations, others rob, exploit, enslave, or abandon them.  Among the reported stories: \n5  a) Many migrants of all ages have been raped or sexually assaulted, extorted, or \nabducted by drug cartels and other criminal groups.  Indeed, the likelihood of rape is \n6  so high that girls and women obtain prophylactic shots of the contraceptive Depo-\nProvera before setting out to avoid pregnancy.     \n7 \nb) Children are regularly crushed to death or lose limbs under the tracks of “La Bestia,” \n8  the freight train that runs south to north through Mexico, where many migrants hitch \na ride.   \n9 \nc) In 2017, at least 85 migrants died on the journey through Mexico—many of them hit \n10  or run over while attempting to hitch a ride on trains and trucks, and another 415 \nmigrants drowned or died of exposure while attempting to cross the Southern Border.   \n11 \n12  30. As then-DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson acknowledged on July 10, 2014—two months \n13  before DHS, DOS, and the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) proposed the CAM Program—“the long \n14  journey for a child, in the custody of a criminal smuggling organization, from Central America to \n15  the United States is dangerous. Many of the children are exploited, abused and hurt.”    \n16  31. Despite the dangers of the journey, unaccompanied children from the Northern \n17  Triangle countries risked their lives on this passage in record numbers because of increased \n18  violence in their home countries, particularly targeting young people.  In these countries, gangs like \n19  the MS-13 and Barrio 18—gangs originally formed in the United States that extended to Central \n20  America after their members were deported—have created a confederation of semi-autonomous \n21  mini-states within each country that coordinate more closely than the national governments.  \n22  Attacks on buses, abductions and gang rapes, and shootings in broad daylight occur daily in many \n23  neighborhoods in the Northern Triangle, along with omnipresent efforts to recruit even small \n24  children as gang members or sex slaves.  Children are executed by gang members for refusing to \n25  join a gang or to have sex or to pay extortion money, or simply because they are in the wrong place \n26  at the wrong time.  In one city in Honduras, morgue technicians have regularly received corpses of \n27  children under 10, and sometimes as young as two.  In 2014, the collapse of a “truce” agreement \n28  between the MS-13 and the government of El Salvador led to an explosion in violence in that \n-8- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 11 of 46\n1  country.  The Northern Triangle countries have some of the highest homicide rates in the world for \n2  children under 18 years old, with a 2014 United Nations (“UN”) report identifying El Salvador and \n3  Guatemala as the two countries with the highest child homicide rates.   \n4  32. Nearly 60 percent of Central American children interviewed in U.S. custody by the \n5  U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in 2013 said they had suffered, been threatened, or feared \n6  serious harm—of the sort that would make them likely eligible for international protection as \n7  refugees.  By comparison, only 13 percent of children identified such concerns in similar interviews \n8  in 2006. \n9  33. Then-DHS Secretary Jeh C. Johnson determined that the situation at the border was a \n10  “humanitarian crisis.”  In the face of this crisis, the United States struggled to meet its legal \n11  obligations to the children streaming across its border.  Federal law—passed with overwhelming \n12  bipartisan support in the last months of the George W. Bush Administration—requires the \n13  government to provide unaccompanied Central American children with an opportunity for an \n14  immigration hearing prior to removal.  8 U.S.C. § 1232(a)(5)(D).  It also requires the Department of \n15  Health and Human Services to place the child “in the least restrictive setting that is in the best \n16  interest of the child” and to attempt to reunite children with their family members in the United \n17  States.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(2)(A).  The U.S. government opened emergency shelters on an Air \n18  Force base in order to house the young arrivals, and later enlisted the Federal Emergency \n19  Management Agency to manage the relief effort.   \n20  34. To address the refugee crisis, the U.S. government proceeded along multiple tracks \n21  to attempt to reduce the number of dangerous border crossings by unaccompanied Central American \n22  children.  Among other things, it: \n23  a) Worked with Mexico to secure its borders.   \n24  b) Put in place a public messaging campaign in Central America emphasizing the \ndangers of the journey through Mexico to the United States.  \n25 \nc) Delivered $750 million in aid to the Northern Triangle countries.    \n26 \n27  35. And the U.S. government implemented the Central American Minors program to \n28  allow children from the Northern Triangle countries to apply for refugee resettlement or parole \n-9- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 12 of 46\n1  status while still in their home countries, in order to be reunified with their parents lawfully residing \n2  in the United States. \n3 \nTHE CAM PROGRAM SUCCEEDED IN PROVIDING CHILDREN A \n4  LEGAL PATHWAY TO SAFETY AND FAMILY REUNIFICATION \n5  36. The Obama Administration first proposed the CAM Program on September 18, 2014 \n6  as part of the President’s annual recommendations to Congress on the proposed refugee admissions \n7  for the following fiscal year, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §§ 1157(d) & (e).  The annual Presidential \n8  Determination on Refugee Admissions incorporated these recommendations, identifying people in \n9  El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as being of special humanitarian concern.  From the start, \n10  the Administration trumpeted the CAM Program as a “safe, legal, and orderly alternative to the \n11  dangerous journey that some children are taking to reach the United States.”1\n12  37. Like many prior programs created by the U.S. government to address humanitarian \n13  crises in particular countries, CAM was structured as a dual refugee/parole program.  Under the \n14  CAM Refugee program, Central American parents lawfully living in the United States could apply \n15  for their minor children and qualifying family members in the Northern Triangle countries to be \n16  considered for refugee resettlement while still in their home countries.  This type of in-country \n17  refugee processing takes place only after DOS, in consultation with DHS/USCIS, NGOs, UNHCR, \n18  and other experts, identifies a specific group as being in need of resettlement.  The children and \n19  qualifying family members were accepted as refugees if they could establish that they qualified for \n20  resettlement under U.S. law—by demonstrating a well-founded fear of persecution based on \n21  religion, race, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular group.\n22  38.

USCIS promised participants that if they were eligible for the CAM Program but \n3  deemed ineligible for refugee status, they “will then be considered on a case-by-case basis for \n4  parole into the United States” and that “[a] separate application for this parole process is not \n5  required if the individual already has access to the CAM program” (emphasis added).2  Children \n6  and qualifying family members were eligible for parole to join their family members in the United \n7  States if USCIS determined that: (1) they were “at risk of harm”; (2) they “clear[ed] all background \n8  vetting”; (3) USCIS had received “no serious derogatory information”; and (4) a third party had \n9  committed to financially support them in the United States.3\n10  39. The CAM Program continued a long tradition by the United States of adopting \n11  mixed refugee/parole programs to address specific regional crises.4   For example, for more than \n12  two decades beginning in 1988, the United States considered applicants fleeing religious \n13  persecution in the former Soviet Union for refugee resettlement, and if they did not qualify, for \n14  extended parole status in the United States.5  Similarly, for a decade beginning in 1989, Vietnamese \n15  nationals who were denied refugee status were considered for admission to the United States as \n16  parolees under a program established to provide a safe and legal alternative to leaving Vietnam by \n17  boat.6\n18  40. To qualify as a CAM applicant, a U.S.-based parent had to be at least 18 years old \n19  and be lawfully present in the United States as a Legal Permanent Resident, Temporary Protected \n20  Status recipient, Parolee, or Deferred Action Recipient.  In order to be eligible, Parolees and \n21  Deferred Action Recipients had to have held that status for at least one year at the time of \n22 \n2 USCIS, Central American Minors (CAM) Refugee/Parole Program: Information for Conditionally Approved \n23  Applicants (from June 2, 2017—accessed using Wayback). \n3U.S. Dep’t of State, In-Country Refugee/Parole Program for Minors in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras with \n24  Parents Lawfully Present in the United States, 2009-2017 Archive for the U.S. Dep’t of State (Nov. 14, \n2014), https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/prm/releases/factsheets/2014/234067.htm, supra n.1.\n25  4 USCIS Ombudsman, Recommendation on the Central American Minors (CAM) Refugee/Parole Program (Dec. 21, \n2016) at 13-14, available at \n26  https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Citizenship%20and%20Immigration%20Service%20Ombudsman.p\ndf. \n5 Id. at 14.   \n27 \n6 GAO, Report to the Chairman, Subcommittee on Immigration, Refugees, and International Law, Committee on the \nJudiciary, House of Representatives: Refugee Program – The Orderly Departure Program From Vietnam (Apr. 1990), \n28 \navailable at http://archive.gao.gov/t2pbat10/141353.pdf. \n-11- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 14 of 46\n1  application. \n2  41. To qualify as a CAM beneficiary, a child had to be under 21 years old; unmarried; a \n3  national of El Salvador, Guatemala, or Honduras, and the genetic, step- or legally adopted- child of \n4  a qualifying parent.  The CAM Program also allowed close family members of qualifying children \n5  to participate as beneficiaries under certain conditions.  In mid-2016, the Obama Administration \n6  expanded the program to allow additional immediate family members of the children to apply as \n7  “derivative” beneficiaries. \n8  42. The lengthy CAM application process had many components, which included the \n9  extensive screening and vetting process accompanying the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.  The \n10  CAM application process included the following steps: \n11  (a) First, a qualifying parent filed an application with assistance of a \n12  “resettlement agency” in the United States—a non-profit organization that is \n13  partially funded by the government to welcome refugees into the country.  \n14  The parent had to provide proof of identity, proof of legal status in the United \n15  States, and a passport size photo of the child.  Defendant DOS reviewed \n16  applications and forwarded eligible applications to the International \n17  Organization for Migration (“IOM”)—the inter-governmental organization \n18  DOS contracts to run its Resettlement Support Center7 in Latin America. \n19  (b) Second, IOM contacted the child in the Northern Triangle country and \n20  invited them to a pre-screening interview in the capital city of their country.   \n21  There, IOM interviewed the child, took their biometric data and background \n22  information, prepared their case file, and initiated security checks—following \n23  the standards for processing applicants to the U.S. Refugee Admissions \n24  Program.    \n25  (c) Third, USCIS verified the relationship between the parent and child and \n26 \n27  7 DOS funds and manages nine Resettlement Support Centers around the world to process refugee applications for U.S. \nresettlement consideration.  DOS contracts international and nongovernmental organizations, such as IOM, to operate \n28 \nthese centers.  \n-12- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 15 of 46\n1  performed security checks.  Part of the verification required the parent and \n2  child to take DNA tests at the parent’s expense.   After the parent paid for \n3  testing, the child had to travel to the capital city of their country to provide \n4  the test sample.  Where the testing confirmed the relationship, parents were \n5  subsequently reimbursed for the DNA tests.  USCIS’s Refugee Access \n6  Verification Unit also verified the relationship using documentary evidence.  \n7  If the relationship was not confirmed, USCIS rejected the application.   \n8  (d) Fourth, after confirming the relationship, USCIS scheduled and conducted \n9  an interview with the child in the capital city.  The U.S. Embassy in \n10  Honduras told CAM applicants that after they submitted an application, \n11  “DHS officials will interview eligible family members to determine who will \n12  be admitted as a refugee or offered parole to the U.S.”8\n13  (e) Fifth, after confirming security check results and DNA test results, USCIS \n14  made a determination on the refugee application.  CAM beneficiaries either \n15  received a decision letter or a phone call informing them of the \n16  determination.  For those who received letters, if refugee status was denied, \n17  the letter checked one of several boxes to explain the reason for the denial \n18  and outlined the process to request a review of the refugee determination.  \n19  The letter then indicated whether the child was eligible for the CAM Parole \n20  program.  Where USCIS had approved the child for the CAM Parole \n21  program, the letter said:   \n22  You have been conditionally approved for parole into \nthe United States.  Final approval is conditioned upon \n23  successful completion of any remaining clearances that \nare required in the screening process.  These clearances \n24  include medical examination by a U.S. approved panel \nphysician,  completion  of  security  clearance \n25  procedures,  and  verification  of  family  relationships.  \nPlease see attached information sheet for next steps \n26 \n27  8 U.S. Embassy in Honduras, In-Country Refugee/Parole Processing for Minors in Honduras, El Salvador, and \nGuatemala (Central American Minors – CAM): Frequently Asked Questions, available at https://hn.usembassy.gov/wp-\n28 \ncontent/uploads/sites/109/2016/07/visas_camprogram-faqs.pdf (last viewed on April 18, 2018). \n-13- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 16 of 46\n1  that must be completed for you to be paroled into the \nUnited States. \n2 \n3  (f) Sixth, after a child was conditionally approved for parole, they had to \n4  undergo a medical examination at the parent’s expense.  USCIS told \n5  applicants that if they were conditionally approved, “IOM will contact your \n6  relative in the United States to collect payment for the medical exam,” and \n7  “[a]fter receiving payment, IOM will contact you to arrange your exam.”9\n8  The child was required to travel to the capital city for the exam.10  If the child \n9  cleared the exam, they would receive a medical clearance valid for six \n10  months.11\n11  (g) Seventh, USCIS told applicants that “[i]f the medical exam results clear, \n12  IOM will contact your relatives in the United States to arrange for your \n13  flight,” and “[a]fter IOM receives payment for your travel, they will submit \n14  the travel itinerary to USCIS.”12\n15  (h) Eighth, USCIS told applicants that after receiving the travel itinerary from \n16  IOM, USCIS “will . . . [p]erform final security checks, [e]nsure the medical \n17  exam results remain valid until date of travel, and [v]erify that your relative \n18  still has a qualifying legal presence in the United States.”13  USCIS further \n19  represented to applicants that “[i]f we decide that you have met all \n20  requirements for parole under this program, we will issue Form I-512L, \n21  Authorization for Parole of an Alien Into the United States,” and “IOM will \n22  give you this document and your plane ticket the day you fly to the United \n23  States.”14  Under DHS regulations, “when parole is authorized,” “the alien \n24 \n25  9 USCIS, Central American Minors (CAM) Refugee/Parole Program: Information for Conditionally Approved \nApplicants (from June 2, 2017—accessed using Wayback), supra n.2. \n26  10Id. \n11Id.

USCIS told applicants \n6  that “[w]e will consider CAM parole extension requests for the duration of \n7  the program.”15\n8  43. The CAM application process was designed to proceed quickly, particularly after an \n9  applicant was conditionally approved for parole.  The required medical examination results were \n10  valid for only six months (and only three months for beneficiaries with certain medical diagnoses),16\n11  and needed to be repeated—and paid for again—if they expired.  Similarly, security checks were \n12  valid for only a limited period of time.  Accordingly, USCIS advised applicants “to book the travel \n13  [to the United States] within the time period suggested by IOM to avoid additional processing \n14  delays and costs if the medical exam or security checks expire.”17  Anticipating that conditionally \n15  approved parolee cases would be quickly processed, USCIS also advised applicants that if they \n16  needed additional time to pay for medical exams or flights to the United States to notify IOM or \n17  USCIS so their cases could be administratively closed and reopened when they had collected the \n18  necessary funds.18\n19  44. The CAM Program began accepting applications on December 1, 2014, and during \n20  the approximately two and a half years it was in operation, more than 13,000 people applied.  \n21  Because of the program, at least 1,627 individuals were able to resettle in the United States as \n22  refugees and 1,465 people were able to reunite with their families in the United States as parolees. \n23  // \n24  // \n25  // \n26 \n15Id.\n27 \n16Id. \n17Id.\n28 \n18Id.\n-15- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 18 of 46\n1  THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, \nMOTIVATED BY RACIAL ANIMUS TOWARD LATINOS, \n2  SHUT DOWN THE CAM PAROLE PROGRAM  \n3  The Trump Administration Campaigned on Anti-Latino Animus. \n4  45. President Trump launched his 2016 presidential campaign with the xenophobic claim \n5  that Latin America was “not sending their best” people to the United States: “They’re sending \n6  people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us.  They’re bringing \n7  drugs.  They’re bringing crime.  They’re rapists. . . . It’s coming from all over . . . Latin America.” \n8  46. Candidate Trump continued to categorize all Latinos as gang members, killers, and \n9  rapists in promising to deport and exclude Latinos from the country, at one point even suggesting \n10  that violence against Latinos was justified for people who “love this country and want this country \n11  to be great again.”  For example:  \n12  a) On August 21, 2015, when asked to respond to a report that two of his supporters \nhad urinated on a sleeping Latino man and then beat him with a metal pole, Trump \n13  responded, “people who are following me are passionate.  They love this country and \nwant this country to be great again.  They are passionate.” \n14 \nb) In May 2016, then-candidate Trump referred to anti-Trump protestors who carried \n15  the Mexican flag on Twitter as “criminals” and “thugs.”  \n16  c) In June 2016, then-candidate Trump stated that Judge Gonzalo Curiel could not be \nfair in presiding over a lawsuit because he was “Hispanic.”    \n17 \nd) In October 2016, during a presidential debate, then-candidate Trump responded to a \n18  question about immigration by referring to Latino immigrants as “bad hombres” and \npromising that “we’re going to get them out.”  \n19 \ne) In December 2016, Trump referred to an article about a recent crime wave on Long \n20  Island and said “They come from Central America. They’re tougher than any people \nyou’ve ever met.... They’re killing and raping everybody out there. They’re illegal. \n21  And they are finished.”  \n22 \nThe Trump Administration Shut Down the CAM Parole Program \n23  Immediately After Inauguration, Without Notifying the Public. \n24  47. Within days of President Trump’s inauguration, the Administration set to work to \n25  keep Central Americans from entering the United States, in part by shutting down the CAM Parole \n26  program.  But, the Trump Administration did so secretly, without informing the public or the CAM \n27  participants of what it was doing.   \n28  48. For example, without any public announcement, the Administration stopped USCIS \n-16- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 19 of 46\n1  interviews of CAM beneficiaries, thereby blocking all CAM applications at that stage from being \n2  processed.  Emails recently released in response to a Freedom of Information Act request show that \n3  within the first seven days of the Trump Presidency, USCIS cancelled more than 2,000 CAM \n4  interviews already scheduled to take place in January, February, and March 2017.  The interviews \n5  were cancelled in anticipation ofan Executive Order suspending the U.S. Refugee Admissions \n6  Program—what would later become Executive Order 13,769, Protecting the Nation from Foreign \n7  Terrorist Entry into the United States (“EO-1”).  Although EO-1 was immediately enjoined \n8  nationwide on February 3, 2017 by Washington v. Trump, 2017 WL 462040 (W.D. Wash. Feb. 3, \n9  2017), aff’d, 847 F.3d 1151 (9th Cir. 2017), USCIS did not reinstate the interviews; rather, USCIS \n10  confirmed on February 3, 2017 that all USCIS interviews in the Northern Triangle countries \n11  through the end of March 2017 were cancelled.\n12  49. The Trump Administration, without notifying the public, stopped issuing decisions \n13  post-interview to applicants who were likely candidates for parole.  For example, Plaintiff J.F.’s two \n14  young children, Plaintiffs H.F. and A.F., were interviewed in November 2016, but did not receive \n15  decisions on their applications for more than a year (when they were denied refugee resettlement \n16  and not considered for parole).   \n17  50. With regard to children who prior to President Trump’s inauguration had been \n18  conditionally approved for parole, the Trump Administration stopped scheduling the medical \n19  examinations that were required before conditionally approved parolees could travel to the United \n20  States.  Once again, the Administration did so secretly, without informing the public or the CAM \n21  participants of what it was doing.  And notwithstanding its secret shutdown of the CAM Program, \n22  the Trump Administration continued to solicit and accept funds from applicants, leading them to \n23  believe the program was still operational.   \n24  51. For example, Plaintiff B.E. was conditionally approved for parole in November \n25  2016, and on January 30, 2017, IOM contacted his father, Plaintiff G.E., requesting advance \n26  payment for B.E.’s medical exam by February 15, 2017.  G.E. paid for the exam before February \n27  15, but B.E.’s medical exam was never scheduled.  \n28  52. With respect to conditionally approved parolees who had cleared their medical \n-17- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 20 of 46\n1  examinations, completed every step of the application process, and whose parents had paid for their \n2  plane tickets to come to the United States, the Trump Administration—again without notifying the \n3  public—blocked their travel.   \n4  53. For example, days after President Trump’s inauguration—on or about January 22, \n5  2017—Plaintiff D.D., who had already paid for her daughter’s plane ticket on or about December 8, \n6  2016, sought information about when her daughter would fly to the United States.  An IOM \n7  employee told D.D. that IOM had received new orders and all the CAM cases were frozen for 120 \n8  days—the same length of suspension called for in EO-1 for refugee admissions—although her \n9  daughter’s case was in the Parole program.  The IOM employee told D.D. that her daughter had \n10  been scheduled to fly to the United States on February 13, 2017, but that she could not travel at that \n11  time and had to wait.  Finally, the IOM employee said that none of the CAM cases could be \n12  processed because the new government had changed its position, and IOM had to wait for orders \n13  from the new Administration.  The employee told D.D. that IOM would call her in 120 days.  D.D. \n14  was never called by IOM again.  \n15  54. Similarly, Plaintiff R.C. paid approximately $3,875 for his three children’s plane \n16  tickets to the United States in January 2017.  R.C., who packs produce for a living, took a loan from \n17  friends and managed to send the money to IOM within three days as instructed.  IOM told his \n18  family that the children would travel on February 20, 2018 and would receive a follow up call with \n19  more information.  The children, including Plaintiffs M.C. and J.C., never received a call.    \n20  55. Notwithstanding the secret shutdown of the program, the Trump Administration \n21  continued to solicit and accept payments for plane tickets from applicants, thus leading applicants to \n22  believe that the program was still operational.  For example, on February 1, 2017, Plaintiff S.A. \n23  received an email from IOM saying that it had received “the payment information for the Flight \n24  Reservation” for her daughter, Plaintiff J.A., and baby grandson, and she needed to send IOM over \n25  $2,500 “no later than FEB 25, 2017.”  S.A. sent the funds within days, and IOM confirmed receipt \n26  on February 9, 2017.  IOM told S.A. that her daughter and grandson would be able to travel to the \n27  United States approximately two weeks after her payment was received, but they never received \n28  flight information and never traveled.  When J.A. called IOM for an update in approximately April \n-18- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 21 of 46\n1  2017, she was told that all the CAM parole cases were frozen.   \n2  56. Despite shutting down the CAM Parole program and stopping USCIS interviews of \n3  all CAM applicants in January 2017, Defendants failed to notify the public of what they were doing \n4  or to provide any explanation, much less a reasoned one, for why they were shuttingdown the \n5  program.  Instead, Defendants continued to publicly misrepresent—for 7 months—that the CAM \n6  Parole program was functioning normally and continued to solicit and accept payments from \n7  applicants for various steps of the program, including DNA testing and medical tests.   \n8  57. Notably, even after the Administration secretly shut down the CAM Parole program, \n9  the USCIS program webpage for CAM applicants conditionally approved for parole, which \n10  discussed USCIS’s and IOM’s obligations vis-à-vis those applicants, remained active.  This website \n11  and another USCIS website specifically disclaimed any plan to terminate the CAM Parole program, \n12  saying “[c]urrently there is no planned end datefor the CAM parole program,”19 and “[t]here is \n13  currently no filing deadline for this program.”20\n14  58. Similarly, following the secret shutdown of the CAM Parole program, the USCIS \n15  program webpage for conditionally approved CAM applicants continued to recommend that \n16  applicants not delay in paying for plane tickets—the single largest CAM-related expense—to avoid \n17  delayed processing:  “We encourage your relative to book the travel within the time period \n18  suggested by IOM to avoid additional processing delays and costs if the medical exam or security \n19  checks expire.”21  USCIS estimated that the cost of a single plane ticket for a child or adult ranged \n20  from $1,110 to $1,401.22\n21  59. And following the secret shutdown of the CAM Parole program, a DOS webpage \n22  discussing the CAM Program expansion continued to represent that applications for newly-eligible \n23  derivative beneficiaries would be processed if they were filed before September 30, 2017: \n24  For a temporary period of time, the expansion of the CAM program will apply \nretroactively in certain cases.

Moreover, for months following the secret shutdown of the CAM Parole program, in \n6  no fewer than five webpages controlled by USCIS, DOS, and the U.S. Embassies in El Salvador \n7  and Honduras, Defendants represented well into the summer of 2017 that the CAM Program \n8  continued to offer: \n9  a) “a legal means of family reunification for qualified individuals,”24\n10  b) “a safe, legal, and orderly alternative to the dangerous journey that some children are \ncurrently undertaking to the United States,”25 and \n11 \nc) “protect[ion for] Central Americans at risk by allowing lawfully present parents in \n12  the United States to request refugee status for their children in El Salvador, \nHonduras, and Guatemala via the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.”26\n13 \nThe Trump Administration Waited Until August 2017 \n14  to Publicly Announce the Termination of CAM. \n15  61. President Trump and his Administration officials had ample opportunity to publicly \n16  acknowledge that they had shut down the CAM Parole program—and indeed they issued repeated \n17  announcements about the use of parole authority—but they specifically failed to mention any \n18  changes to the CAM Parole program.   \n19 \n20 \n23 U.S. Dep’t of State, Expansion of the Central American Minors (CAM) Program, Fact Sheet (Jan. 20, 2017), \n21  https://www.state.gov/j/prm/releases/factsheets/2017/266363.htm (emphasis added).

For example, President Trump issued Executive Order 13,767 (“the Parole EO”), 82 \n2  Fed. Reg. 8,793, on January 25, 2017, in which he ordered the Homeland Security Secretary to take \n3  “appropriate action” to ensure that his statutory parole authority was exercised “only on a case-by-\n4  case basis” and “only when an individual demonstrates urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant \n5  public benefit derived from such parole.”  The Parole EO made no mention of the CAM Program.   \n6  63. Similarly, on February 20, 2017, then-Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly \n7  issued a memorandum purporting to implement the Parole EO, and said that in his judgment, \n8  statutory parole authority “should be exercised sparingly.”  Without any explanation, he asserted \n9  that “[t]he practice of granting parole to certain aliens in pre-designated categories in order to create \n10  immigration programs not established by Congress, has contributed to a border security crisis, \n11  undermined the integrity of the immigration laws and the parole process, and created an incentive \n12  for additional illegal immigration.”  He ordered the Director of USCIS to “ensure that . . . \n13  appropriate written policy guidance and training is provided to employees . . . so that such \n14  employees are familiar with the proper exercise of parole . . . and exercise such parole authority \n15  only on a case-by-case basis,” pending the issuance of final regulations on the use of parole.  \n16  Secretary Kelly omitted any mention of the CAM Program.   \n17  64. Not until August 16, 2017 did Defendants finally publicly announce the termination \n18  of the CAM Parole program by publishing a notice in the Federal Register.  82 Fed. Reg. 38,926 \n19  (Aug. 16, 2017).   \n20  65. In the August Federal Register notice, then-Acting Secretary of Homeland Security \n21  Elaine Duke announced that, effective immediately, USCIS was no longer considering or \n22  authorizing parole under the CAM Parole program.  In the same notice, DHS rescinded conditional \n23  approval for parole en masse for all CAM beneficiaries whom USCIS had granted this status but \n24  had not yet traveled to the United States. \n25  66. Notably, DHS’s Federal Register notice did not provide any explanation for the \n26  termination of the CAM Parole program or for the mass rescission of conditional approval for \n27  parole.  Furthermore, the notice failed to acknowledge that in fact the program had been shut down \n28  without any explanation since January 2017. \n-21- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 24 of 46\n1  67. Nor did DHS’s Federal Register notice claim that conditions in the Northern \n2  Triangle counties had improved from the conditions in 2014 that led to the establishment of the \n3  CAM Program.  Indeed, they have not, even according to the U.S. government.  For example: \n4  a) In March 2017, DOS issued a report on El Salvador’s human  rights practices.  This \nreport described rampant human rights abuses throughout El Salvador that “stem[] \n5  from . . . widespread extortion and other crime,” “widespread corruption,” “weak \nrule of law, which contributed to high levels of impunity and government abuse, \n6  including unlawful killings by security forces,” “widespread” violence against \nwomen and girls, and the commercial sexual exploitation of women and children. \n7 \nb) On January 10, 2018, DOS issued a Level Three travel advisory for El Salvador that \n8  warns travelers to “[r]econsider travel” to the country “due to crime.”  The advisory \nstates that “[v]iolent crime, such as murder, assault, rape, and armed robbery, is \n9  common,” and that “[g]ang activity, such as extortion, violent street crime, and \nnarcotics and arms trafficking, is widespread.”   \n10 \nc) According to DOS, nearly one out of every five persons in El Salvador has been a \n11  victim of violent crime.  Approximately ten women per day experience violence or \nsexual assault in El Salvador, and 7 of every 10 victims of sexual violence are under \n12  the age of 20. \n13  d) In a report published in August 2017, the U.N. World Food Program identified the \nviolence in El Salvador as “a humanitarian emergency” that “has significantly \n14  impeded development” in the country. \n15  e) DOS’s 2017 Human Rights Report for El Salvador stated that over 48,000 students \ndropped out of school in 2015 due to gang threats, crime, or forced displacement due \n16  to gang activity.  In 2017, the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre estimated \nthat nearly 220,000 people were forced to flee violence in El Salvador in 2016 alone.  \n17  The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops Delegation noted that the estimated \nnumber of displaced persons in El Salvador could be as high as 400,000. \n18 \nf) El Salvador has one of the world’s highest homicide rates.  In 2017, the homicide \n19  rate was nearly twelve people per day. \n20  g) In January 2018, Human Rights Watch reported that Honduras continues to have the \nhighest murder rate in the world. \n21 \nh) On January 10, 2018, DOS issued a Level 3 Travel Advisory for Honduras, noting \n22  that homicide and armed robbery are “common” and that “[v]iolent gang activity,” \nincluding rape, violent street crime, and human trafficking, is “widespread.”  The \n23  advisory further notes that “[l]ocal police and emergency services lack the resources \nto respond effectively to serious crime.” \n24 \ni) DOS’s 2017 Human Rights Report for Honduras identified widespread human rights \n25  violations including arbitrary killings and arrests, killings of journalists, and \nwidespread corruption, as well as “murder, extortion, kidnapping, torture, human \n26  trafficking,” and other forms of violence by “local and transnational gangs and \nnarcotics traffickers.”  It stated “that the judiciary was “subject to intimidation, \n27  corruption, politicization, and patronage,” and that “organized criminal groups . . . \nexercised influence on the outcomes of some court proceedings.”  \n28 \n-22- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 25 of 46\n1  j) Honduras has a femicide rate of 14.6 per 100,0000, and in 2016, 463 women were \nmurdered in Honduras.  Authorities only investigated 15 of those cases. \n2 \nk) On January 10, 2018, DOS issued a Level 3 Travel Advisory for Guatemala, asking \n3  that U.S. citizens “[r]econsider travel” to the country.  The Advisory noted that \n“sexual assault, carjacking, armed robbery, and murder” are “common” and that \n4  “gang activity,” including “extortion, violent street crime, and narcotics trafficking, \nis widespread.” \n5 \nl) DOS’s 2017 Human Rights Report for Guatemala says that government officials \n6  “frequently engaged in corrupt practices with impunity.”  The report cited major \ncrimes committed with stunning flagrancy, including an MS-13 attack on a large \n7  public hospital that killed five civilians and freed a fellow gang member. \n8  m) Violence against women remained at epidemic levels.  DOS’s 2017 report mentions \nthat “[p]olice had minimal training or capacity to investigate sexual crimes or assist \n9  survivors of such crimes, and the government did not enforce the law effectively.” \n10  n) DOS’s 2017 report mentions rampant abuse of children, including “children engaged \nin the worst forms of child labor.”  It reported that 683 minors had been violently \n11  killed in the country between January 2017 and August 2017.  It also noted that in \n2016, 41 girls at a government-run shelter for adolescents died after a fire started in \n12  the room where the shelter had locked them. \n13  68. The Federal Register notice was silent about the grave risks to the life and safety of \n14  unaccompanied minors that motivated the original creation of the CAM Program.  It did not suggest \n15  that those risks had abated or would be addressed by other approaches. \n16  69. The August 16, 2017 Federal Register notice stated that the CAM Refugee program \n17  would be left in place, but the reprieve for the CAM Refugee program was short-lived.  On \n18  November 8, 2017, DOS announced that it would stop accepting CAM applications the following \n19  day, and soon thereafter it announced that it would stop interviews in January 2018.  Since January \n20  31, 2018, children with pending CAM applications who had not been interviewed have been \n21  receiving communications denying their applications and advising them to seek assistance at child \n22  welfare agencies in their countries of origin.  On information and belief, the Administration plans to \n23  deny the nearly 4,000 CAM applicants who were not interviewed by January 31, 2018. \n24  70. After the Administration formally terminated the CAM Parole program, IOM told \n25  applicants whose conditional approval for parole was rescinded—all of whom had previously been \n26  deemed ineligible for refugee resettlement under the CAM Refugee program—that they could file a \n27  Request for Review (“RFR”) of the denial of refugee status within 90 days of notice of the \n28  rescission.   \n-23- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 26 of 46\n1  71. Many of the CAM applicants affected by the mass rescission relied upon \n2  Defendants’ representations and filed RFRs, including Plaintiffs H.F., A.F., and B.E. \n3  72. Nonetheless, upon information and belief, while RFRs are often adjudicated within \n4  two to four months of filing, many CAM applicants who filed RFRs have not yet received decisions \n5  for RFRs filed in 2017 or early 2018.  Fiscal Year 2018 is drawing to a close, and the Fiscal Year \n6  2019 Presidential Determination on refugee admissions may further limit refugee admissions from \n7  Central America or end in-country processing, and thereby prevent even people deemed eligible for \n8  refugee resettlement from entering the United States. \n9  73. The termination of the CAM Parole program—its secret termination, the mass \n10  rescission of conditional approval of parole status for nearly 3,000 people, and failure to consider \n11  parole eligibility for people already in the pipeline in August 2017—was unprecedented.  The \n12  United States has created or maintained many refugee/parole programs in the past, but it has never \n13  before secretly and abruptly terminated one in this fashion.  For example: \n14  a) When the Lautenberg parole program27 was publicly terminated in 2011, USCIS \ngave applicants conditionally approved for parole who had not yet traveled 90 days \n15  to complete their processing and enter the United States.  The vast majority of parole \napplicants travelled to the United States before the deadline, and USCIS later \n16  extended the deadline to give another chance to those who missed the window.   \n17  b) When the Vietnamese Public Interest Parole program was ended in 1999, applicants \nwho were already conditionally approved for parole were allowed to travel to the \n18  United States after the termination.   \n19  c) When a program considering Cuban medical professionals for parole ended in the \nearly days of 2017, USCIS announced that it would process all pending applications \n20  and parolees would be given six months to submit applications on behalf of \nderivative family members. \n21 \n22  74. The termination of the CAM Program—specifically, shutting it down first before \n23  officially announcing its permanent termination—does, however, follow the Trump \n24  Administration’s modus operandi in its various attempts to ban immigrants and refugees from this \n25  country.  For example, in the context of immigrant and non-immigrant visas, President Trump \n26  issued successive Executive Orders purporting to temporarily suspend Muslim travelers from six \n27 \n27 The Lautenberg Amendment, first enacted in 1990 and subsequently expanded, lowered the standard for proving \n28 \nrefugee status for persecuted religious minorities in the former Soviet Union and later in other countries. \n-24- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 27 of 46\n1  countries from entering the United States—allegedly, to enable a security review—before issuing an \n2  order that permanently subjected nearly the same group of Muslim travelers to nearly an identical \n3  ban.  See Exec. Order No. 13,769, 82 Fed. Reg. 8,977 (Feb. 1, 2017); Exec. Order No. 13,780, 82 \n4  Fed. Reg. 13,209; Presidential Proclamation 9,645 (Sept. 24, 2017). \n5  75. Similarly, in the refugee context, President Trump issued successive Executive \n6  Orders purporting to temporarily suspend the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program—again, allegedly, \n7  to enable successive security reviews.  See Exec. Order No. 13,769, 82 Fed. Reg. 8,977 (Feb. 1, \n8  2017); Exec. Order No. 13,780, 82 Fed. Reg. 13,209.  On the day the second “temporary” \n9  suspension was slated to end, the Trump Administration publicly purported to resume refugee \n10  admissions, but the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of State, and the Director of \n11  National Intelligence released a memorandum which further suspended admissions of all refugees \n12  from nine Muslim-majority countries.  See Exec. Order No., 13,815, 82 Fed. Reg. 50,055, 50,057, \n13  and its accompanying memorandum.  To this day, only a handful of refugees from those nine \n14  Muslim-majority countries have been admitted to the United States this fiscal year. \n15 \nThe CAM Termination Is Part and Parcel of Trump Administration Policies \n16  Motivated by Racial Animus Against Latinos. \n17  76. This unprecedented, unexplained, and unsupported termination of the CAM Parole \n18  program can only be understood as one of this Administration’s many policies fueled by anti-Latino \n19  animus.  For example, since coming to office, the Administration has announced the termination of \n20  Temporary Protected Status (“TPS”) for Salvadorans, Nicaraguans, and Hondurans, many of whom \n21  had lived in the United States for decades.  The Administration forged ahead with these TPS \n22  terminations in deliberate disregard of the advice of senior career diplomats with regional expertise \n23  to the contrary.   \n24  77. Moreover, recently disclosed USCIS emails further call into question whether the \n25  Administration’s decision to end these and other TPS programs were made in good faith and \n26  whether the stated reasons for TPS terminations were pretextual.  The emails demonstrate that \n27  Administration officials sought negative details about Haitian TPS holders before terminating TPS \n28  for Haiti—despite the fact that such details were irrelevant to the Administration’s purported reason \n-25- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 28 of 46\n1  for termination: that there was no longer any humanitarian need for the program.   \n2  78. Nearly 200,000 Salvadorans, 60,000 Hondurans, and 5,000 Nicaraguans will lose \n3  legal status in the United States as a result.  The TPS terminations have been challenged as \n4  discriminatory and based on unconstitutional animus.  See Ramos v. Nielsen, 3:18-cv-01554, Class \n5  Action Compl. (N.D. Cal. filed Mar. 12, 2018); Centro Presente v. Trump, 1:18-cv-10340, First \n6  Amended Compl. (D. Mass. filed May, 9, 2018); CASA de Maryland v. Trump, 8:18-cv-00845, \n7  Compl. (D. Md. filed Mar. 23, 2018). \n8  79. Similarly, the Trump Administration has ended other programs and reversed policies \n9  affecting unaccompanied minors, primarily from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, in an \n10  effort to facilitate their deportation.  Within days of his inauguration, President Trump ordered \n11  federal officials to take policy actions relating to the treatment of unaccompanied minors from \n12  Central America, and in response, the DOJ issued memoranda making it easier to strip \n13  unaccompanied minors of their legal rights and protections.  DOJ has also removed guidelines—in \n14  place since the George W. Bush Administration—on child-sensitive questioning techniques, and \n15  declined to renew funding for a program providing legal services to 7,000 unaccompanied minors.   \n16  80. The Trump Administration has also embraced a widely criticized policy of \n17  separating migrant parents from their children by prosecuting any adult who illegally crosses the \n18  border.  Administration officials say the goal is to discourage Central American families from \n19  traveling to the border and applying for asylum—indeed, the very goal that the CAM Program was \n20  designed to, and did, address.  The separation policy has been challenged as unconstitutional and \n21  unlawful, and a federal judge recently denied the government’s motion to dismiss a case involving \n22  such a challenge, finding that the alleged behavior shocks the conscience and violates the migrant \n23  parents’ and children’s constitutional right to family integrity.  Ms. L. v. U.S. Immig.t and Customs \n24  Enforcement, 3:18-cv-00428, Order on Motion to Dismiss (S.D. Cal. June 6, 2018).   \n25  81. And most notoriously, the Trump Administration illegally terminated the Deferred \n26  Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) program through which approximately one million \n27  immigrants who had illegally come to the United States as children applied for and received \n28  deferred action allowing them to legally work, study, and drive in this country.  The majority of the \n-26- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 29 of 46\n1  people affected by the termination are Latino, and in response to legal challenges, three courts have \n2  issued nationwide injunctions of the termination.  NAACP v. Trump, 1:17-cv-02325-JDB (D.C. Cir. \n3  Apr. 24, 2018); Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 279 F. Supp. 3d 1011, \n4  1026 (N.D. Cal. 2018); Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen, 279 F. Supp. 401, 437–38 (E.D.N.Y. 2018).  One \n5  court held that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their constitutional claim that the DACA \n6  termination was the result of animus toward Latinos.  Batalla Vidal, 279 F. Supp. at 437–38. \n7  82. Even as the Trump Administration has been accused of promoting and implementing \n8  these and other anti-Latino policies motivated by racial animus, President Trump has persisted in \n9  labeling all Latinos as gang members and drug traffickers and calling Central Americans as a group \n10  “true animals” and “bad people.”  For example:  \n11  a) On January 25, 2017, shortly after signing executive orders calling for immediate \nconstruction of a wall along the southern U.S. border and withholding federal funds \n12  from “sanctuary” cities, President Trump condemned the “unprecedented surge” of \nmigrants from Central America for eroding safety in the United States, claiming that \n13  these two orders “will save thousands of lives.” \n14  b) On January 27, 2017, newly-inaugurated President Trump and Mexico’s President \nPeña Nieto discussed President Trump’s proposal for a border wall over the phone.  \n15  During that transcribed conversation, President Trump once again referred to \nMexicans as “tough hombres.”  \n16 \nc) On February 3, 2017, during a visit to the Customs and Border Protection training \n17  center, President Trump said “You know they’re bad. They’re pouring in from El \nSalvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, all over. They’re just pouring into our \n18  country!”  \n19  d) In February 2017, President Trump said “What has been allowed to come into our \ncountry, when you see gang violence that you've read about like never before, and all \n20  of the things—much of that is people that are here illegally .  . . They’re rough and \nthey’re tough . . . So we're getting them out.” \n21 \ne) On June 21, 2017, President Trump implied that thousands of immigrants are \n22  members of the Central American gang MS-13.  He said “These are true animals. \nWe are moving them out of the country by the thousands, by the thousands.” \n23 \nf) Similarly, on June 28, 2017, President Trump suggested that the MS-13 gang had \n24  taken over swaths of U.S. territory, and said: “They are bad people. And we’ve \ngotten many of them out already. . .  We’re actually liberating towns, if you can \n25  believe that we have to do that in the United States of America.  But we’re doing it, \nand we’re doing it fast.”   \n26 \ng) On August 25, 2017, President Trump pardoned former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe \n27  Arpaio, who was to be sentenced for criminal contempt for failing to comply with a \nfederal judge’s order to stop racially profiling Latinos.  Before issuing the pardon, \n28  President Trump asked rhetorically, “Was Sheriff Joe convicted for doing his job?” \n-27- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 30 of 46\n1  After issuing the pardon, President Trump sent a tweet calling Mr. Arpaio “an \nAmerican patriot.” \n2 \nh) On September 5, 2017, in conjunction with the Administration’s announcement of \n3  the termination of the DACA program, President Trump issued a statement decrying \n“the massive surge of unaccompanied minors from Central America including, in \n4  some cases, young people who would become members of violent gangs throughout \nour country, such as MS-13.” \n5 \ni) On January 11, 2018, President Trump infamously referred to El Salvador as a \n6  “shithole country” during a meeting with lawmakers about immigration, asking \n“Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?”  He then \n7  suggested that the United States should bring more people from countries such as \nNorway, which has an overwhelmingly white population.   \n8 \nj) In February 2018, President Trump claimed that immigrants from El Salvador, \n9  Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico are “just pouring into our country . . . . These \ncountries are not our friends, you know.  We think they’re our friends, and we send \n10  them massive aid . . . and they’re pouring drugs into our country and they’re \nlaughing at us”—returning to his common refrain that Central Americans are \n11  somehow gaming the U.S. immigration system. \n12  k) In May 2018, President Trump said of people crossing the Mexican border into the \nUnited States: “You wouldn’t believe how bad these people are.  These aren’t \n13  people.  These are animals.” \n14 \nTHE CAM PAROLE PROGRAM TERMINATION AND MASS RESCISSION \n15  HAVE BEEN DEVASTATING AND ARE CONTINUING TO HARM \nPARENTS AND THEIR CHILDREN SEEKING TO REUNITE \n16  IN THE UNITED STATES AWAY FROM DANGER \n17  83. The CAM Parole program termination and mass rescission devastated thousands of \n18  families in the United States and the Northern Triangle countries.  The termination meant that \n19  thousands of children and family members who had applied for CAM in reliance on the possibility \n20  of parole under that program—including nearly 3,000 children and family members who had been \n21  conditionally approved for parole and who relied on Defendants’ representation that if they met all \n22  the requirements for parole under the CAM Program, they would travel to the United States—were \n23  deprived of the opportunity to reunite with their loved ones in the safety of the United States.   \n24  84. Moreover, the families who had applied for CAM prior to its termination had \n25  reasonably relied on Defendants’ representations about the availability of the CAM Parole program \n26  in applying for CAM in the first place and in proceeding with their applications during the first \n27  seven months of President Trump’s Administration, even though the Administration had secretly \n28  shut down the program.  During that time, Defendants continued to publicly promise parents that \n-28- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 31 of 46\n1  their children, including children who had been denied refugee status but had been conditionally \n2  approved for parole, had a legal pathway to the United States, and Defendants continued to solicit \n3  and accept parents’ money to process the applications.  Defendants’ misrepresentations led families \n4  to continue to expend significant financial resources and to put their lives in danger in order to \n5  pursue the false promise of parole.   \n6  85. The CAM application process required applicant parents to pay a significant amount \n7  of money, particularly for individuals who often must support themselves, their families in the \n8  United States, and their families living in danger in Central America.  Parents had to pay \n9  approximately $400 per parent-child pair for DNA tests, which was required to be reimbursed if the \n10  tests confirmed a biological relationship.   \n11  86. After a child was conditionally approved for parole, parents had to pay \n12  approximately $100 for their required medical exam, and sometimes additional money for a follow-\n13  up exam.  Then, parents had to pay approximately $1,400 for each child’s plane ticket to the United \n14  States.  The Trump Administration continued to solicit and accept these fees from January to \n15  August 15, 2017, even after they secretly shut down the CAM Parole program.   \n16  87. Parents whose children had already completed their medical exam, such as Plaintiffs \n17  D.D., R.C., S.A., and G.E., were not reimbursed when their children’s conditional approval for \n18  parole was revoked en masse.   \n19  88. Moreover, even when parents were eventually reimbursed the thousands of dollars \n20  they paid for their children’s plane tickets, they incurred additional expenses that were not \n21  reimbursed and suffered hardships that could not be remedied.  For example, Plaintiff R.C. had to \n22  take out loans from friends in order to pay about $4,000 for his three children’s plane tickets within \n23  the three-day deadline IOM gave him, and he was not reimbursed the $200 interest he paid.  \n24  Plaintiff S.A. was not able to travel to El Salvador to visit her family because she used her limited \n25  income to pay approximately $2,500 for her daughter and grandson’s plane tickets to the United \n26  States and didn’t receive a refund until nine months later.   \n27  89. In addition to these costs specifically required by the CAM Program, parents and \n28  children by necessity incurred other application-related costs.  Each step of the application \n-29- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 32 of 46\n1  process—prescreening, DNA testing, USCIS interviews, medical examinations, and dropping off \n2  and receiving required documentation—took place in San Salvador, Tegucigalpa, or Guatemala \n3  City.  Many of the children, including Plaintiffs A.F., H.F., M.C., J.C., B.E., and J.A., lived hours \n4  outside of their respective capital cities and repeatedly had to travel long distances for each step of \n5  the process.  Because road travel in the Northern Triangle countries is extremely unsafe and public \n6  transportation is especially dangerous—gangs routinely attack buses, rob or abduct passengers, and \n7  murder bus drivers (driving a bus in Guatemala has been characterized as the most dangerous job on \n8  the planet)—Plaintiff children regularly drove in private cars to and from their CAM appointments.  \n9  Plaintiff parents thus had to pay for gasoline, tolls, and food for the trip, and frequently had to \n10  reimburse the family member or friend who drove the child for a day’s lost wages.  Plaintiffs R.C., \n11  S.A., D.D., J.F., G.E., and A.B. sent their children one hundred dollars or more for each of their \n12  long trips to and from capital cities for their CAM appointments. \n13  90. And, even private transportation did not fully mitigate the risk of being stopped on \n14  the highway by gangs, particularly when driving in the dark.  Plaintiff J.C., for example, worried \n15  about being stopped or harassed on the road every time he and his siblings traveled to San Salvador \n16  for their CAM appointments.  Nevertheless, the CAM families continued to take these risks and \n17  incur these costs because they reasonably relied on Defendants’ representations that the program \n18  was still operating in the first seven months of the Trump Administration. \n19  91. Moreover, Plaintiff parents—particularly those whose children had been \n20  conditionally approved for parole and expected their children to travel to the United States \n21  imminently—incurred significant expenses in preparing their homes and buying clothes, furniture, \n22  and luggage in anticipation of the promised arrival of their children.  For example, Plaintiff R.C. \n23  spent more than $2,000 to buy new furniture and clothes for his three children after he paid for their \n24  plane tickets and believed they would arrive at his California home within weeks. \n25  92. The U.S. Government was well aware of the financial burden and safety risks CAM \n26  families faced in proceeding with their CAM applications.  The USCIS Ombudsman stated in a \n27  December 2016 report that the CAM Program imposed “significant financial hardships” on the \n28  families of applicants.  She noted that some families “require[d] extended time to gather the funds \n-30- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 33 of 46\n1  necessary to pay DNA testing costs or, in the case of parolees, to cover the costs of travel to the \n2  United States,” and that the upfront cost for DNA testing in particular was “prohibitive for some \n3  families.”  Defendants, specifically DOS, have recognized the danger associated with travel to \n4  capital cities in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, identifying each as a “critical-threat \n5  location.” \n6  Plaintiff family S.A. and J.A. \n7  93. Twenty-three year old Plaintiff J.A. remains in El Salvador with her four-year-old \n8  son.  She is harassed daily by gang members who congregate outside her house.  They threaten to \n9  kidnap her, demand that she “date” them, and extort her.  J.A. remains at risk, and at one point in \n10  2017, she became so fearful when a gang member aggressively demanded to “date” her that she \n11  temporarily fled with her son to San Salvador for their safety.  \n12  94. J.A. and her son were conditionally approved for parole, and had progressed through \n13  every step of the process.  S.A. had purchased plane tickets for her daughter and grandson, and they \n14  expected to travel to the United States two weeks later.  To reach this stage of the process, J.A. had \n15  to make approximately eight trips to San Salvador, a four-hour drive each way from where she \n16  lives, often with her baby son in tow.  Then, inexplicably, processing of her and her son’s \n17  applications ground to a halt.  After about eight months of waiting desperately for news, the family \n18  learned that J.A. and her son’s conditional approval for parole had been rescinded and they would \n19  not travel to the United States. \n20  95. S.A. and J.A. lost the opportunity to reunite in the United States—and S.A. to protect \n21  her daughter from the dangers she faces in El Salvador.  S.A. has not lived with her daughter since \n22  she was just a baby—when S.A. fled the violence of El Salvador’s civil war and an abusive ex-\n23  husband.  S.A. is deeply aware of all the events, big and small, in her daughter’s life that she has \n24  missed and had been filled with hope at the possibility of sharing their lives together.      \n25  96. Soon after her family members’ conditional approval for parole was rescinded, S.A. \n26  was diagnosed with breast cancer.  S.A. missed the opportunity to have her daughter care for her \n27  during her recovery from surgery and her chemotherapy.  \n28  97. S.A. lost the money she spent on her daughter’s and grandson’s applications and \n-31- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 34 of 46\n1  associated expenses, including $196 and $137 she spent on two medical exams, $250 she spent on \n2  suitcases and clothing, and approximately $800 total for her daughter’s trips to San Salvador for \n3  CAM appointments.  \n4  Plaintiff A.B. \n5  98. Plaintiff A.B. worries every day about the safety of his 23-year-old son who lives in \n6  a neighborhood in El Salvador where the MS-13 is very active.  The MS-13 killed A.B.’s nephew in \n7  the community several years ago.  MS-13 members have robbed A.B.’s son multiple times and \n8  violently attacked a bus he was traveling in, injuring some of the passengers.  Recently, the MS-13 \n9  murdered a young man and his family in the son’s community.  \n10  99. A.B.’s son, a university graduate with a degree in computer systems, has struggled to \n11  find work in El Salvador, and recently felt compelled to take the only job he could find—collecting \n12  interest on loans—which requires him to travel to dangerous neighborhoods in his community.  \n13  A.B. tried to convince not to take the job, but recognizes that his son has little choice, given that \n14  coming to the United States is no longer a possibility.        \n15  100. A.B. filed a CAM application for his son in 2015, and his son had completed the \n16  initial steps of the CAM process.  He was waiting for USCIS to schedule an interview with him \n17  when processing of his application inexplicably ground to a halt.  About a year later in January \n18  2018, he was finally interviewed.  Weeks later, he was denied refugee status and not considered for \n19  parole—even though he had applied to the CAM Program more than a year and a half before the \n20  parole program was publicly terminated, and his life is in grave danger.  A.B.’s son submitted an \n21  RFR in approximately March 2018, but has not received a decision to date. \n22  101. The CAM Parole program termination deprived A.B. of the opportunity to reunite \n23  with his son, his first child.  A.B. has not been able to live with his son since he left El Salvador \n24  when his son was a baby, but he has stayed in close touch with him, and was deeply looking \n25  forward to having a life together in the United States. \n26  102. In addition to the program fees, A.B. spent approximately $100 for each of four trips \n27  his son had to make to San Salvador for CAM-related appointments. \n28  // \n-32- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 35 of 46\n1  Plaintiff family R.C., M.C., and J.C. \n2  103. Plaintiffs M.C. and J.C. remain in El Salvador and are at grave risk.  In Fall 2017, \n3  while playing soccer outside, J.C. was beaten by MS-13 members to the point where he lost \n4  consciousness and required emergency surgery.  He now requires a cane to walk and he struggles to \n5  bathe himself.  He is terrified to leave his house, and he dropped out of school to minimize the time \n6  he must spend outside. \n7  104. M.C.  has been stalked by a known gang member and rapist in her community and \n8  became so afraid that she dropped out of school just a few months short of graduation.  She would \n9  have been the first person in her family to graduate from high school.  She, too, has become a \n10  prisoner in her own home. \n11  105. R.C. fears for the safety of M.C., J.C., and his younger son.  He submitted CAM \n12  applications on behalf of all three children, and they were conditionally approved for parole and \n13  completed every step of processing, including payment for plane tickets.  The siblings were so far \n14  along in the CAM parole process that they had packed all of their belongings, M.C.’s friends threw \n15  her a goodbye party, and the children were waiting for IOM to contact them with confirmation \n16  details for their flight to the United States.  The rescission of the children’s conditional approval for \n17  parole and the lost opportunity to live together in the United States was very upsetting for R.C., \n18  M.C., and J.C., as well as the rest of their family. \n19  106. R.C. spent thousands of dollars on his children’s CAM applications and associated \n20  expenses, relying on Defendants’ representations about the program. R.C. is an agricultural worker \n21  who works long days packing celery, and it was no small feat for him to pay these expenses, while \n22  also supporting his three children in the United States and his family in El Salvador.   Each time \n23  R.C.’s children traveled to San Salvador in connection with their CAM application—a total of six \n24  trips—R.C. sent them approximately $300 in order to hire a private driver and reimburse their aunt \n25  for chaperoning them, as well as pay for gas and food.  He also spent $450 on their medical \n26  examinations, and sent them $280 to help them buy suitcases for their trip.  Finally, R.C. spent \n27  $1,200 to prepare his home for their arrival by purchasing beds and blankets, and spent a further \n28  $1,000 to purchase clothing and shoes for his children to use on arrival. \n-33- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 36 of 46\n1  107. After IOM gave R.C. a three-day deadline to pay $3,875 for his children’s flights to \n2  the United States, he had to take out a loan from friends, with interest, to pay the fee on time.  Even \n3  though R.C.’s children never traveled to the United States, IOM did not reimburse him for almost a \n4  year. \n5  Plaintiff D.D. \n6  108. Plaintiff D.D. and her eight-year-old U.S. citizen son were heartbroken when D.D.’s \n7  daughter’s conditional approval for parole was rescinded after the family had completed every step \n8  of the application process.  D.D. has not lived with her daughter since her daughter was a baby.  The \n9  family had hoped to celebrate Christmas together for the first time, and D.D. had prepared a room \n10  for her daughter and bought winter clothes for her.  D.D. also planned to buy a puppy for her \n11  daughter and son to take care of together.  After learning that his older sister would not be coming \n12  to United States through CAM, D.D.’s young son cried for days.  \n13  109. D.D. had struggled to pay for all the costs associated with the CAM Program on her \n14  teacher’s aide salary, but did so happily—in reliance on the opportunity to reunite with her \n15  daughter.  Each of her daughter’s approximately six CAM appointments were in San Salvador—\n16  about a three-hour drive from D.D.’s daughter’s home—and each time, D.D. sent her daughter $100 \n17  to cover the cost of gas, food, and to repay her sister for taking the whole day off work to drive her \n18  daughter back and forth.   \n19  110. D.D. paid additional fees in connection with the CAM Program: $1,551 for her \n20  daughter’s flight to the United States; $100 for the required medical examination; and $800 for \n21  DNA testing (which was later reimbursed).  D.D. had to take out a loan in order to pay for her \n22  daughter’s flight by IOM’s quick deadline, and while she was ultimately reimbursed for the flight \n23  about a year after paying for it, she had to pay interest on the loan.  \n24  Plaintiff family G.E. and B.E. \n25  111. Seventeen-year-old Plaintiff B.E. continues to live in the house in El Salvador where \n26  he heard the gun shots that killed his uncle.  MS-13 gang members murdered B.E.’s uncle in 2014, \n27  and his grandfather testified against them at the trial for their crime.  Ever since, the gang has \n28  sought to make the family, and particularly B.E., pay.  MS-13 members have repeatedly pursued \n-34- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 37 of 46\n1  B.E., harassed him, and threatened to kill him.  Terrified to leave the house, B.E. has become \n2  essentially a prisoner in his own home, and avoids leaving without an adult by his side. \n3  112. Plaintiff G.E. lives in fear that his son will be attacked or killed by the MS-13.  He is \n4  particularly fearful because his brother’s killers will be released from prison in a year. \n5  113. G.E. struggled to pay the fees and expenses associated with his son’s CAM \n6  application.  G.E. sent his son approximately $100 each time he had to travel to San Salvador for a \n7  CAM appointment—a journey B.E. made approximately six times.  This money paid for the cost of \n8  a private driver, gasoline, and food.  It was also intended to reimburse the lost wages of B.E.’s \n9  grandfather who accompanied him on his trips.  G.E. paid approximately $223 for his son’s medical \n10  exam, which was never scheduled.  IOM finally refunded this fee more than a year after G.E. paid \n11  it.  G.E. also spent approximately $500 to purchase a new bed for his son, among other costs to \n12  prepare his home for his son’s expected arrival. \n13  114. After B.E.’s conditional approval for parole was rescinded, B.E. filed an RFR.  To \n14  date, he has not received a decision. \n15  Plaintiff family J.F., H.F. and A.F. \n16  115. Plaintiff J.F. felt desperate after processing of the CAM applications for his young \n17  daughters, H.F. and A.F., and his wife inexplicably stopped for the first eight months of 2017.  \n18  Then, soon after his family was interviewed in Fall 2017, they were denied refugee status and not \n19  considered for parole.  After being filled with hope at the prospect of being reunited with his family, \n20  J.F. now feels afraid and uncertain about his future because he believes that President Trump is \n21  trying to harm Central Americans like them.   He has lived and worked in the United States for two \n22  decades and has never had an opportunity to share a home with his wife and daughters.   \n23  116. J.F.’s eight-year-old daughter, H.F., does not understand why her family cannot join \n24  her father in the United States.  She became very angry after their CAM applications were denied \n25  and blames her father for their situation. \n26  117. H.F., A.F., and their mother remain in Honduras, where J.F.’s wife has been \n27  threatened by MS-13 gang members at the school where she works as a kindergarten teacher.  J.F.’s \n28  wife knows of other female heads of household in her area who have been raped and killed, and she \n-35- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 38 of 46\n1  fears for her safety and the safety of her daughters \n2  118. J.F. lost money in connection with his family’s CAM applications.  Each time H.F., \n3  A.F., and their mother traveled to Tegucigalpa in connection with CAM—a nearly four-hour trip \n4  that required them to leave their house around 3:00 AM—J.F. sent them $200 to cover the costs of \n5  the trip, including tolls, gas, and food.  \n6  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n7  119. Plaintiffs D.D., J.F., H.F., A.F., R.C., M.C., J.C., G.E., B.E., S.A., J.A., and A.B. \n8  bring this action as a class action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(1) and (b)(2), \n9  on behalf of themselves and all other similarly situated persons who applied for the CAM Program \n10  as applicants or as beneficiaries prior to August 16, 2017, who were denied refugee status under the \n11  CAM Refugee program, and who were denied parole under the CAM Parole program as a result of \n12  its termination.  This class includes but is not limited to all CAM applicants and beneficiaries who \n13  were conditionally approved for parole prior to August 16, 2017, and whose conditional approval \n14  was rescinded en masse by the August 16, 2017 Federal Register notice.  \n15  120. The Plaintiff Class is so numerous that joinder is impracticable.  On information and \n16  belief, the Plaintiff Class consists of over 5,000 putative class members.  Conditional approval for \n17  parole was mass rescinded for approximately 2,714 in-country family members.  An estimated \n18  several hundred in-country family members were beneficiaries of CAM applications filed before \n19  August 16, 2017 and were interviewed by USCIS, but were never considered for the CAM Parole \n20  program.  Each of these beneficiaries has a family member lawfully present in the United States \n21  who applied for CAM on his or her behalf. \n22  121. The claims of the Plaintiff Class members share common issues of law, including but \n23  not limited to: \n24  a) Whether the termination of the CAM Parole program violated the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”) and the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. \n25  Constitution;  \n26  b) Whether the mass rescission of conditional approval for parole violated the \nAPA and the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; \n27 \nc) Whether the decision in January 2017 to secretly terminate the CAM \n28  Program violated the APA and the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution;  \n-36- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 39 of 46\n1  d) Whether the Defendants’ failure to issue travel documentation to individuals \nwho had received parole violated the APA and the Fifth Amendment to the \n2  U.S. Constitution; and \n3  e) Whether the Defendants’ ongoing acceptance of payments from CAM \napplicants following the secret shutdown of the CAM Parole program \n4  requires that they be equitably estopped from benefitting from their \naffirmative misconduct. \n5 \n6  122. The claims of the Plaintiff Class members share common issues of fact, including \n7  but not limited to: \n8  a) Whether the Defendants secretly shut down the CAM Parole program in \nJanuary 2017; \n9 \nb) Whether, following the secret shutdown of the CAM Parole program, the \n10  Defendants continued to accept payments from CAM applicants; \n11  c) Whether, following the secret shutdown of the CAM Parole program, the \nDefendants continued to represent to the public that the CAM Parole program \n12  was still operational; \n13  d) Whether, following the secret shutdown of the CAM Parole program, the \nDefendants failed to issue travel documentation to individuals who had \n14  received parole; \n15  e) Whether, at the time the CAM Parole program was formally terminated, the \nDefendants rescinded en masse all conditional approval for parole without \n16  providing individualized process; \n17  f) Whether the Defendants provided a legally sufficient justification for \nterminating the CAM Parole program; and  \n18 \ng) Whether the Defendants’ termination of the CAM Parole program was \n19  motivated by animus against persons of a certain race or national origin. \n20  123. The claims or defenses of the named Plaintiffs are typical of the claims or defenses \n21  of the members of the Plaintiff Class.  \n22  124. The named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Plaintiff \n23  Class.  The named Plaintiffs have no interest that is now or may be potentially antagonistic to the \n24  interests of the Plaintiff Class.   \n25  125. The attorneys representing the named Plaintiffs include experienced attorneys who \n26  are considered able practitioners in federal civil litigation, including civil rights litigation.  These \n27  attorneys should be appointed as class counsel.   \n28  126. Defendants have acted, have threatened to act, and will act on grounds generally \n-37- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 40 of 46\n1  applicable to the Plaintiff Class, thereby making final injunctive and declaratory relief appropriate \n2  to the class as a whole.  The Plaintiff Class may therefore be properly certified under Federal Rule \n3  of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2). \n4  127. Prosecution of separate actions by individual members of the Plaintiff Class would \n5  create the risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications and would establish incompatible standards \n6  of conduct for individual members of the Plaintiff Class.  The Plaintiff Class may therefore be \n7  properly certified under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(1). \n8  CAUSES OF ACTION\n9  COUNT ONE \nADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT — ARBITRARY & CAPRICIOUS \n10 \nOn Behalf of All Plaintiffs, Including the Class,  \n11  Against All Defendants Except President Trump \n12  128. The shutdown of the CAM Parole program in January 2017 with no notice to \n13  applicants and while holding out the program as operational constitutes a final agency action that is \n14  “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § \n15  706(2)(A).   \n16  129. In addition, Defendants’ failure to provide notice of the termination violated 5 \n17  U.S.C. § 552(a)(1)(E). \n18  130. The official termination of the CAM Parole program in August 2017 without any \n19  explanation and without identifying any change in circumstances to justify the termination of a \n20  policy upon which thousands of people had relied to their detriment constitutes a final agency action \n21  that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  \n22  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n23  131. The mass rescission of conditional approval for parole without any explanation, \n24  without any individualized process, and without identifying any change in circumstances to justify \n25  the rescission of a status upon which thousands of people relied to their detriment constitutes a final \n26  agency action that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance \n27  with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).   \n28  132. The final agency actions should therefore be set aside pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 702 and \n-38- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 41 of 46\n1  5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n2 \n3  COUNT TWO \nADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT — ACCARDI \n4 \nOn Behalf of All Plaintiffs, Including the Class,  \n5  Against All Defendants Except President Trump \n6  133. The termination of the CAM Parole program and mass rescission of conditional \n7  approval for parole are final agency actions that violate agency procedures, including those \n8  identified on USCIS and DOS public webpages directed at CAM applicants and beneficiaries.  \n9  These agency procedures include: \n10  a) “Once a DS-7699 form has been filed, . . . IOM will contact the applicants in their \ncountry of origin, and will conduct pre-screening interviews for the qualifying child \n11  and family members and support processing as the case proceeds through DNA \ntesting, Department of Homeland Security interview, and all medical and security \n12  checks.” \n13  b) “After form DS-7699 is submitted, . . . DHS officials will interview eligible family \nmembers to determine who will be admitted as a refugee or offered parole to the \n14  U.S.” \n15  c) “A separate application for this parole process is not required if the individual \nalready has access to the CAM program.” \n16 \nd) “If refugee status is denied, your decision letter will state whether you have been \n17  conditionally approved for parole into the United States.” \n18  e) “If you are a conditionally approved CAM applicant, IOM will contact your relative \nin the United States to collect payment for the medical examination.” \n19 \nf) “After receiving payment [for the medical examination], IOM will contact you to \n20  arrange your exam.” \n21  g) “If the medical exam results clear, IOM will contact your relative in the United \nStates to arrange for your flight.” \n22 \nh) “After IOM receives payment for your travel, they will submit the travel itinerary to \n23  USCIS.” \n24  i) After receiving the travel itinerary from IOM, USCIS “will:  \n1) [p]erform final security checks, \n25  2) [e]nsure the medical exam results remain valid until date of travel, and \n3) [v]erify that your relative still has a qualifying legal presence in the United \n26  States.” \n27  j) “If [USCIS] decide[s] that you have met all requirements for parole under this \nprogram, [USCIS] will issue Form I-512L, Authorization for Parole of an Alien Into \n28  the United States.” \n-39- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 42 of 46\n1  k) “IOM will give you [Form I-512L] and your plane ticket the day you fly to the \nUnited States.” \n2 \nl) With respect to certain CAM derivative beneficiaries eligible only after the 2016 \n3  program expansion, a DS-7699 form “filed on or before [September 30, 2017] will\nbe processed regardless of where the qualifying child is in the process as long as the \n4  relationships of the expanded category relatives can be verified through DNA \ntesting.” \n5 \n6  134. The mass rescission of conditional approval for parole for individuals for whom \n7  parole was authorized violated 8 U.S.C. § 212.5(f). \n8  135. The termination of the CAM Parole program and the mass rescission of conditional \n9  approval for parole should therefore be set aside under the principle articulated in United States ex. \n10  rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260 (1954). \n11  136. In addition, Defendants’ failure to comply with their own procedures and regulations \n12  render the termination of the CAM Parole program and the mass rescission of conditional approval \n13  for parole “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 \n14  U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  The termination of the CAM Parole program and the mass rescission should \n15  therefore be set aside pursuant to 5 U.S.C. §§ 702 and 706(2). \n16  COUNT THREE \nFIFTH AMENDMENT — DUE PROCESS \n17 \nOn Behalf of All Plaintiffs in the U.S., Including the Class Members in the U.S.,  \n18  Against All Defendants \n19  137. Plaintiff parents, who are lawfully present in the United States, have constitutionally \n20  protected liberty interests in the companionship and society of their family members who are \n21  stranded in Central America.   \n22  138. The Due Process Clause protects Plaintiffs against arbitrary or irrational deprivations \n23  of their constitutionally protected interests, as well as from deprivations that are outside the normal \n24  manner prescribed by law.  The government’s burden is greater where, as here, the liberty interests \n25  at stake derive from well-established and significant reliance interests. \n26  139. Defendants’ unprecedented, unexplained, and unsupported secret shutdown of the \n27  CAM Parole program, their August 16, 2017 termination of the CAM Parole program, and their \n28  mass rescission of conditional approval for parole violated U.S.-based Plaintiffs’ right to due \n-40- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 43 of 46\n1  process because Defendants’ actions were arbitrary, irrational, and outside the manner prescribed by \n2  law.   \n3  140. Defendants’ failure to provide notice of the secret shutdown violated 5 U.S.C. \n4  § 552(a)(1)(E). \n5  141. Moreover, Defendants’ deprivation of U.S.-based Plaintiffs’ liberty interests served \n6  no rational purpose other than to “disrespect and subordinate” Latinos.  Denying a fundamental \n7  right based on such discriminatory intent is “so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the \n8  heart of the [Due Process Clause]” that it “deprive[s these persons] of liberty without due process of \n9  law.”  Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 12 (1967); see Obergefell v. Hodges, —— U.S. ——, 135 S. \n10  Ct. 2584, 2603-05 (2015). \n11  142. Defendants’ conduct violates the substantive and procedural due process rights \n12  protected by the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution.   \n13  COUNT FOUR \nFIFTH AMENDMENT — EQUAL PROTECTION \n14 \nOn Behalf of Plaintiffs in the U.S., Including Class Members in the U.S., \n15  Against All Defendants \n16  143. The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment contains a guarantee of equal \n17  protection.  \n18  144. Defendants’ decisions to terminate the CAM Parole program and implement mass \n19  rescission of conditional approval for parole violate the equal protection guarantee because they \n20  were substantially motivated by discriminatory intent on the basis of race, ethnicity, and national \n21  origin.  The conclusion that the secret shutdown, official termination, and mass rescission were \n22  substantially motivated by discriminatory intent is inescapable in light of the Trump \n23  Administration’s unprecedented departures from normal procedure, the lack of any explanation for \n24  the termination and rescission, the continuing nature of the humanitarian crisis that the program was \n25  intended to address, President Trump’s long history of racial slurs and epithets toward Latinos, and \n26  the Trump Administration’s targeting of Latinos for disfavored treatment.  \n27  145. Defendants have thus violated the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth \n28  Amendment by engaging in intentional discrimination based on race, ethnicity, and national origin.  \n-41- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 44 of 46\n1  COUNT FIVE \nEQUITABLE ESTOPPEL \n2 \nOn Behalf of All Plaintiffs, Including the Class, \n3  Against All Defendants \n4  146. Defendants engaged in affirmative misconduct by falsely representing that the CAM \n5  Parole program remained in effect between January and August 2017 and by actively soliciting \n6  money from CAM applicants during that time period and encouraging CAM applicants to expend \n7  resources in connection with their applications.  Defendants failed to comply with 5 U.S.C. \n8  § 552(a)(1)(E) and failed to notify the public of the secret shutdown of the CAM Parole program. \n9  147. In fact, Defendants knew the truth that the CAM Parole program had been secretly \n10  shut down in January 2017, and that USCIS had stopped conducting interviews for the CAM \n11  Program, IOM had stopped arranging medical exams, and IOM and USCIS had stopped making \n12  arrangements for people to travel to the United States through the CAM Parole program.  They \n13  nevertheless intended through their misconduct to induce CAM applicants and beneficiaries to \n14  continue to make payments and expend resources to advance their applications.   \n15  148. Plaintiffs were ignorant of the truth that the CAM Parole program had been shut \n16  down, and they detrimentally relied on Defendants’ misconduct.  \n17  149. Defendants’ misconduct caused a serious injustice to U.S.-based parent Plaintiffs, \n18  who reasonably relied on Defendants’ misrepresentations in paying fees required by the program, \n19  paying expenses associated with repeated trips to capital cities required by the program, paying for \n20  home remodeling, furniture, clothes, and other supplies for family members they reasonably \n21  expected to join them in the United States.   Defendants’ wrongful acts also caused a serious \n22  injustice to in-country children and family member Plaintiffs, who put their lives at risk to travel \n23  long distances to participate in CAM processing in capital cities.   \n24  150. Defendants shall therefore be equitably estopped from terminating the CAM Parole \n25  program and mass rescinding conditional approval for parole. \n26  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n27  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court: \n28  A. Declare that Defendants’ termination of the CAM Parole program and mass \n-42- \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 3:18-cv-03539-LB   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 45 of 46\n1  rescission of conditional approval for parole were unlawful under the APA, the Fifth Amendment, \n2  and principles of equitable estoppel; \n3  B. Set aside Defendants’ unlawful termination of the CAM Parole program and \n4  unlawful mass rescission of conditional approval for parole;  \n5  C. Enjoin and restrain all Defendants, and their officers, agents, servants, employees, \n6  attorneys, and all persons who are in active concert or participation with any of them, from \n7  implementing or enforcing the decisions to terminate the CAM Parole program and mass rescind \n8  conditional approval for parole status; \n9  D. Direct Defendants to reinstate conditional approval for parole status for all \n10  beneficiaries for whom they rescinded it en masse, and process those applications to completion in \n11  the manner in which Defendants publicly represented they would.   \n12  E. Direct Defendants to complete processing of all cases conditionally approved for \n13  parole and to organize flights to ports of entry in the United States for individuals granted parole \n14  within a reasonable time, not to exceed six months, or to provide this Court with case-by-case \n15  explanations for delay; \n16  F.  Certify this case as a class action lawsuit as proposed herein, appoint Individual \n17  Plaintiffs D.D., J.F., H.F., A.F., R.C., M.C., J.C., G.E., B.E., S.A., J.A., and A.B. as class \n18  representatives of the class and the undersigned counsel as class counsel;  \n19  G. Award Plaintiffs reasonable attorney’s fees and costs for this action; and  \n20  H. Grant any other and further relief that this Court may deem just and proper. \n21 \n22  DATED:  June 13, 2018. \n23  Respectfully submitted, \n24  DANIEL B. ASIMOW  LINDA EVARTS* \nMATTHEW H.
