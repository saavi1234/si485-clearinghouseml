    "summary": "<p>A group of practicing Muslim prisoners at the Monroe Correctional Complex filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington on June 10, 2018, alleging that prison staff deprived them of nighttime meals while they were fasting during Ramadan. Represented by the Center for American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), they brought this action against the Washington State Department of Corrections (DOC) and sought declaratory and emergency injunctive relief. According to the plaintiffs, despite their requests, the prison chaplain refused to add them to a list of prisoners to be served specially-timed meals during the month of Ramadan (โthe Ramadan Listโ), in effect subjecting them to a โstarvation policyโ because the normal schedule for meals at the prison all fell within the time of day when they are fasting. They alleged that this violated the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause, the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, the Eighth Amendmentโs ban on cruel and unusual punishment, and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA). </p><p>Along with their complaint, the plaintiffs also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order that would force the prison to provide them with legally adequate meals through the end of Ramadan; that motion was granted by District Judge Ronald B. Leighton the same day. </p><p>In its answer, the DOC denied virtually all of the pertinent allegations in the complaint. It disputed the plaintiffsโ contention that it refused to add them to the Ramadan List, maintaining that the prisoners had not signed up during the established sign-up period. It denied the existence of a โstarvation policyโ towards Muslims at the prison. Finally, it made a number of different affirmative defenses, including qualified immunity for state government officials. The case has been assigned to District Judge Ricardo S. Martinez. </p><p>The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on September 4, 2018. On October 3, 2018, in light of the plaintiffs' amended complaint, submitted on September 12, 2018, the court dismissed the defendants' motion as moot. The parties began discovery in preparation for the trial, scheduled for October 7, 2019. </p><p>The defendants moved for summary judgment on July 9, 2019. Their motion asserted that the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust administrative remedies before filing their amended complaint. Defendants also argued that the sign-up procedures for the \"Ramadan List\" did not significantly burden the plaintiffs' religious beliefs and served a compelling government interest, making the RLUIPA claims not viable. They defendants further asserted that they were entitled to qualified immunity on the constitutional claims.</p><p>The plaintiffs filed their own motion for summary judgment that same day. Their brief reasserted an argument for the validity of their RLUIPA claims, the 8th Amendment claim, and their Equal Protection and Free Exercise claim. They also argued that the defendants should not be entitled to qualified immunity. </p><p>The court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment on September 6, 2019 and dismissed all of the plaintiffs' claims as moot. 2019 WL 4246981. Defendants filed for costs on September 27, 2019. Their request was granted in part and denied in part on October 22, 2019. </p><p>The plaintiffs appealed the order granting the defendants motion for summary judgment to the Ninth Circuit. On December 29, 2020, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the decision. The Ninth Circuit found that the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their available administrative remedies, and therefore could not bring their claims in court. The case is now closed.</p>",

INTRODUCTION & RELIEF REQUESTED \n20 \n  Plaintiffs are five individuals who are currently or were previously in Washington \n21 \nDepartment  of  Corrections  (DOC)  custody.  Plaintiffs  allege  Defendants  violated  their \n22 \nconstitutional  rights  and  RLUIPA  by  denying  them  the  opportunity  to  participate  in  the \n23 \nRamadan meal program and having a Ramadan meal program that requires individuals to sign \n24 \n                                                 \n25 \n1 Plaintiffsโ amended complaint lists an โUnidentified Chaplainโ as a Defendant. ECF No. 59, at 3 & 7. It \nis unclear who Plaintiffs are referencing. Because the arguments raised in this motion would apply equally to this \n26 \nunidentified person and this person has not been served, dismissal of all claims is still appropriate. \n \n \nDEFENDANTSโ MOTION FOR  1  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCorrections Division \nSUMMARY JUDGMENT \nPO Box 40116 \nNO. 2:18-CV-00837-RSM-BAT   Olympia, WA 98504-0116 \n(360) 586-1445 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00837-RSM   Document 73   Filed 07/09/19   Page 2 of 25\n \n1  up months in advance of Ramadan. Defendants seek dismissal of Plaintiffsโ claims. Contrary to \n2  the statements in Plaintiffsโ complaint and ex parte motion for a temporary restraining order, \n3  the original four plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies and John James did \n4  not exhaust until after Plaintiffs filed their amended complaint. As such, all of Plaintiffsโ \n5  claims can be dismissed for failure to exhaust.2  \n6    On the merits, Plaintiffsโ challenge to DOCโs Ramadan policy fails as a matter of law. \n7  Requiring inmates to complete and submit a simple form to participate in a religious event \n8  does not impose any substantial burden on Plaintiffsโ religious beliefs. To the extent that \n9  completing a form that takes less than five minutes imposes a substantial burden, the sign-up \n10  process  serves  compelling  government  interests.  As  such,  Plaintiffs  do  not  have  viable \n11  RLUIPA claims. Furthermore, any claims for injunctive reliefโto the extent such claims are \n12  viableโare now moot. Finally, because Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on the \n13  constitutional claims and there is no monetary liability on RLUIPA claims, all claims for \n14  monetary damages must also be dismissed. Therefore, the Court should dismiss Plaintiffsโ \n15  claims with prejudice \n16 \nII.  STATEMENT OF FACTS \n17 \nA.  DOCโs Food Service Program \n18    DOC's food service program is unlike any other. DOC has to account for the dietary \n19  needs of all 18,000 individuals in its custody. Declaration of Bryan King (King Dec.), at ยถ 1. \n20  This requires sourcing, preparing, and providing 50,000 meals each day. King Dec., at ยถ 1. \n21  DOC  accomplishes  this  task  within  the  unique  confines  of  prison,  where  activities  and \n22  movement of inmates are highly regulated to ensure the safety and security of DOC staff and \n                                                 \n23 \n2 When this case was first filed, the parties focused on Plaintiffsโ allegations regarding their weight loss. \n24  As explained in Defendantsโ motion to dissolve and their response to Plaintiffsโ motion to amend and motion to \nextend discovery, there are many reasons to be skeptical of Plaintiffsโ claims of weight loss. For purposes of \nDefendantsโ summary judgment motion, however, these allegations are not material because they do not affect the \n25 \nlegal analysis and there is no indication that any Defendant was aware of their claimed weight loss prior to the \nfiling of this lawsuit. Defendants reserve the right to file an appropriate motion in the future regarding these \n26 \nclaims of weight loss that appear to be unsupported. \n \n \nDEFENDANTSโ MOTION FOR  2  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCorrections Division \nSUMMARY JUDGMENT \nPO Box 40116 \nNO. 2:18-CV-00837-RSM-BAT   Olympia, WA 98504-0116 \n(360) 586-1445 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00837-RSM   Document 73   Filed 07/09/19   Page 3 of 25\n \n1  incarcerated individuals. Id. DOC offers five standard diets (mainline, a vegetarian mainline \n2  alternative, a milk mainline alternative, Kosher, and Halal) as well as a variety of medically \n3  prescribed  therapeutic  diets  (Consistent Carbohydrate  (Diabetic),  Lower  Protein,  Low  K+ \n4  (Renal), Mechanical Soft, No Gluten, No Peanut, No Tomato, Metabolic (lighter fare), Puree, \n5  and Liquid diets). King Declaration, at ยถ 2. To provide these diets and ensure consistency \n6  across facilities, DOC plans the diets centrally, and they are reviewed by the Dietary Services \n7  Manager to ensure they meet dietary guidelines. Id.; Declaration of Counsel (Counsel Dec.), \n8  Ex. 1, Brent Carney Deposition, at 19:18-25, 23:12-21. DOCโs menu is intended to meet \n9  nutritional standards identified in DOC policy that are based on the Dietary Guidelines for \n10  Americans. Counsel Dec., Ex. 1, at 26:2-17, 31:1-12, 31:22-32:4; King Dec., at ยถ 2. \n11    Although DOC facilities do not establish their own menus, they are responsible for \n12  ordering the food needed to serve the menus. King Dec., at ยถ 4. The Monroe Correctional \n13  Complex (MCC), where Plaintiffs were housed in 2018, serves approximately 2,400 inmates in \n14  the five separate prison facilities. Declaration of Linda Heise (Heise Dec.), at ยถ 1. Because of \n15  the volume of food that MCC provides (approximately 7,000 meals per day), the number of \n16  special diets that require accommodation, and the fact that DOC needs to meet the nutritional \n17  and dietary needs of those in its custody, strict adherence to policy is required. Id. \n18 \nB.  DOCโs Ramadan Meal Program \n19    DOC has a longstanding practice of accommodating the religious beliefs and practices \n20  of its incarcerated population, including by providing meals to Muslim inmates who fast during \n21  Ramadan. ECF No. 16, Declaration of Belinda Stewart (Stewart Dec.), at ยถ 3 & Ex. 1. At \n22  various times over the years, DOC has sought the input of Muslim community members, \n23  including CAIR Washington, regarding the development of a halal diet and the Ramadan meal \n24  program. ECF No. 16, Stewart Dec., at ยถ 8; King Dec., at ยถ 3. In the tightly controlled prison \n25  environment, accommodating religious practices requires that incarcerated individuals follow \n26  established process and procedure so that DOC knows who wishes to participate in a particular \n \n \nDEFENDANTSโ MOTION FOR  3  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCorrections Division \nSUMMARY JUDGMENT \nPO Box 40116 \nNO. 2:18-CV-00837-RSM-BAT   Olympia, WA 98504-0116 \n(360) 586-1445 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00837-RSM   Document 73   Filed 07/09/19   Page 4 of 25\n \n1  religious event and can make necessary custody, food service, and other plans for the event. \n2  ECF No. 16, Stewart Dec., at ยถยถ 5 & 7. \n3    DOCโs Ramadan meal program accommodates Muslim inmates who wish to fast for \n4  Ramadan by providing meals for Muslim inmates to break their fast. Heise Dec., at ยถ 6; King \n5  Dec.,  at  ยถ  6.  As  with  other  meals,  DOC  centrally  develops  a  Ramadan  menu  to  ensure \n6  consistency and DOC staff perform a nutritional analysis to ensure that the menu meets dietary \n7  guidelines. Counsel Dec., Ex. 1, at 23:18-21. DOCโs Ramadan menu meets the daily caloric \n8  requirements for inmates of 2,600 to 2,900 calories. Counsel Dec., Ex. 1, at 31:22-32:6. The \n9  caloric and nutritional content in the Ramadan menu is comparable to the nutritional and \n10  caloric content of DOCโs mainline menu. Counsel Dec., Ex. 1, at 62:24-64:3. \n11    The Ramadan meals are Halal and consist of a fasting tray and a microwavable hot \n12  meal. Heise Dec., at ยถ 6; King Dec., at ยถ 6. The fasting tray includes: two sandwiches (turkey \n13  or bologna and peanut butter and jelly), a whole grain muffin, whole grain cookies, an oatmeal \n14  packet, powdered milk, chips, a breakfast bar, dates, and condiments. Heise Dec., at ยถ 6; King \n15  Dec., at ยถ 6. The tray also includes supplements of hard-boiled eggs, fresh fruit, and veggie \n16  sticks. King Dec., at ยถ 6. The microwavable hot meal is manufactured โTV dinnerโ style and \n17  contains a protein entrรฉe, hot vegetable, and starch. Id. For example, the microwavable hot \n18  meal may contain breaded fish, Halal chicken patty, Halal turkey casserole, or Halal beef with \n19  gravy. Heise Dec., at ยถ 6. All meals come with a starch, fresh vegetables, and a fresh fruit. Id. \n20  Although the microwavable hot meal is the same hot meal offered to inmates on the Halal diet, \n21  production of the Halal meals is on a much greater scale leading up to Ramadan because there \n22  typically are 500 or more inmates who participate in Ramadan, but only 100 or so who are on \n23  the Halal diet at any given time. King Dec., at ยถ 6. Also, the fasting trays contain items that are \n24  not served year round. Id. \n25    DOCโs Ramadan meal program is designed to ensure that all inmates receive the same \n26  Ramadan meals. DOC has not traditionally provided alternative meals to inmates in place of \n \n \nDEFENDANTSโ MOTION FOR  4  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCorrections Division \nSUMMARY JUDGMENT \nPO Box 40116 \nNO. 2:18-CV-00837-RSM-BAT   Olympia, WA 98504-0116 \n(360) 586-1445 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00837-RSM   Document 73   Filed 07/09/19   Page 5 of 25\n \n1  the Ramadan meals. Instead, when an inmate is on a medical/therapeutic diet, the medical diet \n2  supersedes any religious diet absent an inmate signing a form to refuse the medical diet. King \n3  Declaration, at ยถ 11. As such, DOC typically provides the medical diet over the religious diet. \n4  Id. DOC has also not created hybrid medical/religious diets. Id. Blending therapeutic and \n5  religious diets would raise significant health and logistical concerns. Id. Not only would it be \n6  difficult to logistically manage, it creates the risk that kitchen staff make an error in providing \n7  the inmate an meal suited to his individual medical needs. Id. \n8    DOC puts significant planning into the Ramadan meal program in order to accomplish \n9  the task of providing nutritionally adequate Ramadan meals while also meeting the needs of \n10  the entirety of the DOCโs population. ECF No. 16, Stewart Dec., at ยถ 7. To accommodate the \n11  provision of fasting trays, DOCโs Correctional Industries sources and purchases the food from \n12  vendors and then assembles the meals in time to ensure that the meals are available for \n13  Ramadan. King Dec., at ยถ 7. This requires DOC to prepare and have ready more than 30,000 \n14  special meals for the month-long Ramadan observance. King Dec., at ยถ 7. Again, all of this \n15  work is in addition to the feeding of the remaining inmate population and other religious feasts, \n16  including  Passover  (which  in  recent  years  is  close  in  time  with  Ramadan,  requiring \n17  contemporaneous planning for the two observances). King Dec., at ยถ 7; Heise Dec., at ยถ 5.  \n18    To facilitate the planning necessary for DOC to accommodate the needs of Muslim \n19  inmates who wish to fast during Ramadan, there is an established sign-up process. The sign-up \n20  process is simple: complete a one page form that Plaintiffs estimate would take fewer than five \n21  minutes to complete and return it to the Chaplain. ECF No. 16, at ยถ 5; Counsel Dec., Ex. 2, \n22  Roberts Deposition, at 41:6-7; Counsel Dec., Ex. 5, Livingston Deposition, at 54:19-55:3; \n23  Counsel Dec., Ex. 4, Mohamed Deposition, at 27:5-15. This sign-up process occurs several \n24  months in advance of Ramadan to allow DOC to produce the meals in time for Ramadan. King \n25  Dec., at ยถ 8. This advance planning allows DOC facilities to order in advance and ensure that \n26  they receive the correct amount of food in time for Ramadan. Heise Dec., at ยถ 9.

Id. The 2018 Ramadan sign-up process began in January. On \n3  January  16,  2018,  DOC  notified  the  incarcerated  population  of  the  requirements  for \n4  participation through a written memo. ECF No. 16, Stewart Dec., at ยถ 6 & Ex. 2. The memo \n5  was posted and made readily available to inmates. ECF No. 16 Stewart Dec., at ยถยถ 5-7; \n6  Declaration of David Sherman (Sherman Dec.), at ยถ 4. As it pertains to the Washington State \n7  Reformatory (WSR) at MCC, the memo was posted in hallways in the units where inmates \n8  pass every day and in the activity centers. Sherman Dec., at ยถ 4; Counsel Dec., Ex. 7, at 15:9-\n9  17:15. In addition, Chaplain Sherman sent a copy of the memo and a sign-up form to inmates \n10  that had been participating in Muslim religious programming. Sherman Dec., at ยถ 4; Counsel \n11  Dec., Ex. 7, at 15:9-16:3.  \n12    Once the sign-up period closed, religious programs  staff compiled  and distributed \n13  participant lists to each facility and the facility Chaplains would post the list so that individuals \n14  could confirm their presence on the list or request to be added if they believed they were \n15  inappropriately left off. ECF No. 16, Stewart Dec., at ยถ 6 & Ex. 2. As it pertains to MCC/WSR, \n16  Sherman periodically posted a list of inmates from whom he had received forms and approved \n17  prior to the expiration of the sign-up period and posted another list after the end of the sign-up \n18  period. Sherman Dec., at ยถ 6. Sherman also met with inmate Muslim leaders, including James, \n19  to go over the list of inmates who had been approved to participate in Ramadan in February \n20  2018. Counsel Dec., Ex. 7, at 40:23-44:12. Of the Plaintiffs, only Jamesโ name was on the list \n21  of individuals who had signed up to participate in February. Sherman Dec., Ex. 2. \n22 \nC.  Plaintiffsโ Individual Participation in the Ramadan Meal Program \n23    As discussed in more detail below, all five Plaintiffs were inmates in DOCโs custody \n24  during both the sign-up period for Ramadan 2018 and Ramadan 2018. Other than John James, \n25  Plaintiffs did not submit the required paperwork to participate in the Ramadan meal program \n26  and did not raise the issue with any DOC staff until the eve of Ramadan. \n \n \nDEFENDANTSโ MOTION FOR  6  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCorrections Division \nSUMMARY JUDGMENT \nPO Box 40116 \nNO. 2:18-CV-00837-RSM-BAT   Olympia, WA 98504-0116 \n(360) 586-1445 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00837-RSM   Document 73   Filed 07/09/19   Page 7 of 25\n \n1  1.  Plaintiff Demario Roberts   \n2  Roberts has been in DOC custody since May 2017 and was housed at MCC from June \n3  2017 until May 2019. Counsel Dec., Ex. 2, at 6:2-4, 8:4-6; Counsel Dec., Ex. 3. He has not \n4  requested a religious diet during his incarceration. Roberts indicates he has not requested a \n5  halal meal because he does not like DOC food and โjust donโt eat here.โ Counsel Dec., Ex. 2, \n6  at 20:21-21:5. DOC did not receive a Ramadan meal request form from Roberts in 2018. ECF \n7  No. 16, Stewart Dec. ยถ 12; Sherman Dec., at ยถ 6. Because DOC did not receive a form, Roberts \n8  was not on the list of approved inmates that was given to fellow John James in February 2018. \n9  Sherman Dec., Ex. 2. There is no evidence that Roberts communicated with Sherman about his \n10  desire to be on the list prior to the first day of Ramadan, May 16. ECF No. 20-1, at 11.3 \n11  On May 21, 2018, DOC received a grievance from Roberts that he was not receiving \n12  Ramadan meals. ECF No. 17, Declaration of Peter Maxson (Maxson Dec.), at ยถ 7 & Ex. 2. \n13  Maxson  interviewed  Roberts  that  day  and  asked  Roberts  whether  he  signed  up  for  the \n14  Ramadan meal program. Id. Roberts responded he had not. ECF No. 17, Maxson Dec. at ยถ 7. \n15  Maxson also asked Roberts whether he had seen the sign-up information posted in January. Id. \n16  Roberts said he had, but that he did not submit the required form. Id. Maxson asked Roberts if \n17  he agreed to informally resolve the grievance on that basis, and the grievance was marked \n18  informally resolved at Level 0. Id. Roberts did not appeal or pursue the grievance further. Id. \n19  2.  Plaintiff Mohamed Mohamed \n20    Mohamed entered DOC custody in 2015. Counsel Dec., Ex. 4, Mohamed Deposition, at \n21  9:13-14. He was housed at the Coyote Ridge Corrections Center in 2016 and 2017, where he \n22  signed up for and participated in the Ramadan meal program. Stewart Dec., at ยถ 13; Counsel \n23  Dec.,  Ex.  4,  at  22:19-25.  Mohamed  transferred  to  MCC  in  December  2017  and  had  an \n24  anticipated earned early release date in May. Stewart Dec., at ยถ 13; Counsel Dec., Ex. 4, at \n25  16:16-18. However, in April 2018, while housed in the minimum security unit, Mohamed \n                                                 \n26 \n3 The page numbers referenced are contained on the bottom left of the page. \n \n \nDEFENDANTSโ MOTION FOR  7  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCorrections Division \nSUMMARY JUDGMENT \nPO Box 40116 \nNO. 2:18-CV-00837-RSM-BAT   Olympia, WA 98504-0116 \n(360) 586-1445 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00837-RSM   Document 73   Filed 07/09/19   Page 8 of 25\n \n1  received a serious infraction for violating WAC 137-25-030(603) โ Introducing or transferring \n2  any unauthorized drug or drug paraphernalia โ based on evidence that Mohamed had conspired \n3  to introduce marijuana and spice into the prison. Stewart Dec., at ยถ 13. A hearings officer \n4  found Mohamed guilty of the infraction and sanctioned him to a loss of 30 days of good \n5  conduct time. Stewart Dec., at ยถ 13. This extended his early release date past Ramadan, to June \n6  20, 2018, and he was demoted to the medium custody unit at MCC. Stewart Dec., at ยถ 13. \n7    There is no evidence that Mohamed gave a Ramadan meal sign-up form to a Chaplain \n8  at MCC. Records show that on May 2, 2018, after Mohamedโs release date was extended, he \n9  sent an electronic kiosk message to the Chaplain and asked โCan I get put on Ramadan List? I \n10  missed the deadline...โ ECF No. 20-1, at 16. The Chaplain responded that it was too late to \n11  sign up. ECF No. 20-1, at 17. Mohamed responded by saying โI didnt (sic) have a choice \n12  because I lost good time, 30 days. I have to get on that list. Religious purposes cause I will not \n13  go too mainline. Thank you.โ ECF No. 20-1, at 18.  \n14    Mohamed  filed  a  grievance  on  May  16,  2018.  ECF  No.  17-1,  at  41.  Maxson \n15  investigated  the  grievance,  determined  DOC  had  no  record  of  Mohamed  submitting  the \n16  Ramadan form, and concluded that Mohamed could not be given the requested relief as a \n17  result. ECF No. 17-1, Maxson Dec., at ยถ 8 & Ex. 3. Mohamed did not appeal the grievance \n18  response. Id. Mohamed purchased a significant amount of food from the commissary, and \n19  items Mohamed received on May 17, 2018, included ten packages of white rice, ten packages \n20  of cheesy rice and beans, cheese, summer sausages, cookies, Doritos, potato chips, a hot \n21  pickle, and swiss rolls.

Livingston did not sign up for Ramadan during \n3  the Ramadan sign-up period. Counsel Dec., Ex. 5, at 51:19-52:20. \n4    On May 15, 2018, Livingston sent a kiosk message to the Chaplain asking to be placed \n5  on call out for Ramadan night studies and stating he had not been placed on the Ramadan List. \n6  ECF No. 20-1, at 6. Livingston sent another message on May 17, 2018, asking to be put on the \n7  Ramadan List. Id. The Chaplain responded and indicated he had no record of Livingston \n8  signing up for Ramadan and that he (the Chaplain) had emailed the WCC Chaplain to see if \n9  there  was  a  record  of  Livingston  signing  up  while  at  WCC.  Id.  The  Chaplain  asked  if \n10  Livingston had a record showing he had signed up, and Livingston responded โI left WCC \n11  before I could sign up plus it was too far before Ramadan even started. Is there anyway you \n12  can accomodadate (sic) me for Ramadan?โ Id. In follow up, the Chaplain confirmed that notice \n13  of the Ramadan sign-up process was posted in all living units at WCC, and that there was no \n14  record of correspondence from Livingston to the WCC Chaplain requesting participation in the \n15  Ramadan meal program. ECF No. 20-1, Ex. 1, at 8; Sherman Dec., at ยถ 6. \n16    On May 16, 2018, Livingston submitted an emergency grievance stating he requested a \n17  Ramadan meal in a kiosk message and had not received the meal. In the grievance, Livingston \n18  stated he was on a Halal diet and that he โhad received it but not my meal for when I break my \n19  fast after sundown.โ ECF No. 17, Maxson Dec., at ยถ 9. Maxson interviewed Livingston about \n20  his grievance on May 22, 2018, asking why he did not sign up at WCC. Id. Livingston said he \n21  was in segregation and never saw a posting. Id. Upon further questioning, Livingston indicated \n22  he knew about the sign up process from being in prison before. Id. Maxson explained there was \n23  no record of Livingston signing up for Ramadan as was required and asked Livingston whether \n24  he agreed his grievance was resolved on this basis. Id. Livingston stated that he โguessed that it \n25  was  resolvedโ  but  believed  DOC  still  had  to  feed  him.  Id.

On May 17, 2018, Lao sent a kiosk message to the Chaplain to ask to get on the Ramadan \n10  List to receive meals. ECF No. 20-1, at 14. The Chaplain responded that he could add Lao to \n11  the daily prayer but not the fast list because Lao needed to sign up by January 30, 2018. Id. Lao \n12  sent a kiosk message to the Chaplain a few days later complaining he was not on the daily \n13  prayer list and the chaplain responded that Lao had been placed on the callout list for prayer. \n14  Id. On May 23, 2018, Lao received an exception and was added to the Ramadan Meal List and \n15  began receiving meals. Stewart Dec. ยถ 15; Counsel Dec., Ex. 6, at 57:1-4.  \n16 \n5.

James has been on a gluten free to treat a medical condition. Counsel Dec., Ex. 7, at 81:16-\n21  20, 84:7-9. James submitted a Ramadan meal request form and was added to the Ramadan \n22  meal program in January 2018. Counsel Dec., Ex. 7, at 8:22-24. James was on the Ramadan \n23  list  and  received  the  Ramadan  meals.  Counsel  Dec.,  Ex.  7,  at  89:24-90:1.  Some  of  the \n24  Ramadan meals contain gluten.

Events After Ramadan 2018 Involving Plaintiffs \n10    Since Ramadan 2018, three Plaintiffs released from DOC custody. Mohamed released \n11  in August 2018. Counsel Dec., Ex. 4, at 7:8-9. Lao transferred to Bishop Lewis work release \n12  and released from there on June 10, 2019. Counsel Dec., Ex. 6, at 14:4-10. Livingston released \n13  from DOC in February 2019. Counsel Dec., Ex. 5, at 11:14-16. Roberts is still incarcerated, but \n14  he successfully signed up to participate in the Ramadan meal program in 2019. Counsel Dec., \n15  Ex. 3, at 2 of 8 (showing Roberts was on Ramadan meal program). James was given a special \n16  accommodation of gluten free meals during Ramadan 2019.

Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 251 \n22  (1986). To determine if summary judgment is appropriate, the court must consider whether a \n23  particular fact is material and whether there is a genuine dispute as to that material fact left to \n24  be resolved. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). If the nonmoving party bears the burden of proof at trial, the \n25  moving party is not required to bring forth any additional evidence in support of the motion as \n26  long as the motion demonstrates the absence of genuine disputes of material facts and that the \n \n \nDEFENDANTSโ MOTION FOR  11  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCorrections Division \nSUMMARY JUDGMENT \nPO Box 40116 \nNO. 2:18-CV-00837-RSM-BAT   Olympia, WA 98504-0116 \n(360) 586-1445 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00837-RSM   Document 73   Filed 07/09/19   Page 12 of 25\n \n1  moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, \n2  323-25 (1986). Where there is a complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of \n3  the non-moving partyโs case, all other facts are rendered immaterial, and the moving party is \n4  entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 323.  \n5 \nA.  Plaintiffs Failed to Exhaust Their Claims \n6    Incarcerated individuals are required to properly exhaust their administrative remedies \n7  before bringing lawsuits about prison conditions. 42 U.S.C. ยง 1997e(a). Inmates must not only \n8  fully exhaust available administrative remedies, but they also must exhaust those remedies in a \n9  timely manner and abide by the administrative rules governing the internal grievance process. \n10  Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 83 (2006). To effectively exhaust his administrative remedies, \n11  an inmate must use all the formal steps of the prison grievance process. Griffin v. Arpaio, 557 \n12  F.3d 1117, 1119 (9th Cir. 2009). Exhaustion must be accomplished prior to the filing of the \n13  lawsuit. McKinney v. Carey, 311 F.3d 1198, 1199 (9th Cir. 2002) (requiring dismissal when \n14  exhaustion was ongoing).  But see Cano v. Taylor, 739 F.3d  1214, 1220 (9th Cir. 2014) \n15  (indicating that exhaustion is proper when a claim is exhausted between the filing of the \n16  original  complaint  and  the  filing  of  the  amended  complaint).  RLUIPA  incorporates  the \n17  PLRAโs exhaustion requirements. Fuqua v. Ryan, 890 F.3d 838, 844 (9th Cir. 2018). \n18    When prison officials move for summary judgment based on exhaustion, they bear the \n19  initial burden of showing that there was an available administrative remedy and that the \n20  plaintiff did not exhaust that administrative remedy. Albino v. Baca, 747 F.3d 1162, 1172 (9th \n21  Cir. 2014). If prison officials make such a showing, a prisoner can overcome the exhaustion \n22  defense by producing evidence showing that the administrative remedies were effectively \n23  unavailable to him. Id. If the evidence shows that the remedies were available and the inmate \n24  failed to properly exhaust such remedies, the inmateโs claims must be dismissed. \n25    Here, four of the Plaintiffs (Roberts, Mohamed, Lao, and Livingston) failed to pursue \n26  their grievances through all of the stages of the grievance program.

James filed his grievance after the \n4  lawsuit was originally filed. He pursued his grievance through Level III, but he did not receive \n5  a Level III response until after the filing of the amended complaint. Second Maxson Dec., at ยถ \n6  7. As such, James also failed to fully exhaust his administrative remedies related to Ramadan \n7  2018  prior  to  filing  suit.  Therefore,  because  all  five  Plaintiffs  failed  to  exhaust  their \n8  administrative remedies, their claims must be dismissed. \n9 \nB.  Plaintiffsโ RLUIPA Claims Are Moot \n10  Plaintiffsโ RLUIPA claims seek only injunctive and declaratory relief.4 Three of the \n11  five plaintiffs (Mohamed, Livingston, and Lao) no longer are in prison. Their RLUIPA claims \n12  are therefore moot. โAn inmateโs release from prison while his claims are pending generally \n13  will moot any claims for injunctive relief relating to the prisonโs policies unless the suit has \n14  been certified as a class action.โ Alvarez v. Hill, 667 F.3d 1061, 1064 (9th Cir. 2012) (quoting \n15  from Dilley v. Gunn, 64 F.3d 1365, 1368 (9th Cir. 1995)). โThe same is true for claims seeking \n16  declaratory relief.โ Id. (citing Rhodes v. Stewart, 488 U.S. 1, 2-4 (1988)).  \n17  There are two, narrow exceptions to mootness, neither of which applies here. The first \n18  exception applies when the claims are capable of repetition, yet will continue to evade review. \n19  This exception โis limited to extraordinary cases in which (1) the duration of the challenged \n20  action is too short to be fully litigated before it ceases, and (2) there is a reasonable expectation \n21  that the plaintiff will be subjected to the same action again.โ Id. (quoting from C.F. ex rel. \n22  Farnan v. Capistrano Unified Sch. Dist., 654 F.3d 975, 983 (9th Cir. 2011). Notably, a plaintiff \n23  who releases from prison has no reasonable expectation of returning to prison for purposes of \n24 \n                                                 \n4 Plaintiffsโ RLUIPA claims appear to be appropriately limited to such relief because RLUIPA does not \n25 \nprovide for monetary damages against a state, an official acting in his or her official capacity, or an official acting \nin his individual capacity. See Sossamon v. Texas, 563 U.S. 277 (2011); Holley v. Cal. Depโt of Corr., 599 F.3d \n26 \n1108, 1112 (9th Cir. 2010); Wood v.

Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 497 (1974) (case-or-\n2  controversy requirement is not satisfied by the possibility that a party will be prosecuted for \n3  violating criminal laws).  \n4  The second mootness exception is a variation of the first; it applies where, although \n5  there is no reasonable likelihood the plaintiff himself will be subject to the same alleged harm \n6  in the future, he is challenging ongoing policies to which others will be subject. Id. at 1065 \n7  (citations omitted).  Importantly,  courts have limited their application  of this exception to \n8  โshort-lived pretrial proceedings in criminal prosecutions, where civil class actions would not \n9  be conducive to obtaining the relief sought.โ Id. Moreover, as held in Alvarez, even if the \n10  exception applies more broadly, it would not apply to claims (including RLUIPA claims) \n11  challenging prison policies affecting conditions of confinement. Id. (โWhile we have assumed, \n12  for purposes of this appeal, that at least some of the policies and practices Alvarez challenged \n13  remain ongoing and, thus, will continue to affect current ODOC inmates, those inmates can \n14  bring their own RLUIPA claims....โ). Accordingly, Mohamed, Livingston, and Lao no longer \n15  have cognizable RLUIPA claims. \n16  Although Roberts and James remain incarcerated, and will be so for Ramadan 2020, \n17  neither has a viable claim for prospective relief under RLUIPA. Roberts signed up for and \n18  participated in the 2019 Ramadan meal program. Counsel Dec., Ex. 3. As such, he certainly is \n19  aware of and cannot claim likely to be burdened by the sign-up process going forward, thereby \n20  negating any claim for injunctive relief. See Saddiq v. Ryan, 703 Fed. Appx. 570, 571 (9th Cir. \n21  2017) (โFurthermore Saddiq now has notice of the prisonโs thirty-day notice policy and will \n22  not be substantially burdened by future unforeseen implementations of this prison policy.โ). As \n23  to James, DOC accommodated his request for a gluten-free Ramadan meal in 2019 and will \n24  continue to do so in the future. Heise Dec., at ยถ 10; King Dec., at ยถ 12. Therefore, all of \n25  Plaintiffโs claims under RLUIPA should be dismissed as moot.  \n26 \n \n \nDEFENDANTSโ MOTION FOR  14  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCorrections Division \nSUMMARY JUDGMENT \nPO Box 40116 \nNO. 2:18-CV-00837-RSM-BAT   Olympia, WA 98504-0116 \n(360) 586-1445 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00837-RSM   Document 73   Filed 07/09/19   Page 15 of 25\n \n1  C.  Mootness Aside, Plaintiffs Do Not Have Viable RLUIPA Claims \n2  Even if Plaintiffsโ RLUIPA claims were not moot, the claims fail on the merits as a \n3  matter of law. RLUIPA prohibits state correctional facilities from substantially burdening \n4  inmatesโ religious exercise unless the burden furthers a compelling government interest and \n5  does so by the least restrictive means. 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000cc-1(1)-(2). Under RLUIPA, the inmate \n6  bears the initial burden to show a prima facie case that the government regulation imposes a \n7  substantial burden on the exercise of his religious beliefs. Warsoldier v. Woodford, 418 F.3d \n8  989, 994 (9th Cir. 2005). Plaintiffs cannot meet that burden here because the Ramadan meal \n9  signup process they challenge is not a substantial burden on their religious exercise. Moreover, \n10  even if it were a substantial burden, the signup process serves a compelling government \n11  interest โ allowing DOC to plan for, procure, and prepare sufficient meals to meet the demand \n12  for the Ramadan observance โ and is the least restrictive means to achieve that interest.   \n13  1.  The Sign-up Process Does Not Impose a Substantial Burden  \n14  โ[A] burden is substantial under RLUIPA when the state denies [an important benefit] \n15  because of conduct mandated by religious belief, thereby putting substantial pressure on an \n16  adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs.โ Shakur v. Schriro, 514 F.3d 878, \n17  888 (9th Cir. 2008) (internal quotes omitted). Requiring an inmate to sign a piece of paper or \n18  submit a form requesting to participate in a religious activity does not impose a substantial \n19  burden on the inmateโs religious practices. See Resnick v. Adams, 348 F.3d 763, 768 n.6 (9th \n20  Cir. 2003). โ[R]egistration places, at most, a slight burden on an inmateโs right to religious \n21  freedom while serving as an important and beneficial โbright lineโ that enables prison officials \n22  to ascertain the seriousness of the inmateโs religious commitment and respond accordingly.โ \n23  Jackson-Bey v. Hansimaier, 115 F.3d 1091, 1097 (2d Cir. 1997).  \n24  Indeed, absent some requirement that inmates notify prison officials of their desire to \n25  participate in religious festivities, it would be impossible for prison staff to accommodate such \n26  requests. Therefore, DOCโs requirement that Plaintiffs sign up to receive Ramadan meals does \n \n \nDEFENDANTSโ MOTION FOR  15  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCorrections Division \nSUMMARY JUDGMENT \nPO Box 40116 \nNO. 2:18-CV-00837-RSM-BAT   Olympia, WA 98504-0116 \n(360) 586-1445 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00837-RSM   Document 73   Filed 07/09/19   Page 16 of 25\n \n1  not impose a substantial burden on Plaintiffsโ religious practices. Courts have recognized the \n2  legitimacy of a prison systemโs interest in the orderly administration of its diet programs. See \n3  Resnick,  348  F.3d  at  769.  Courts  also  have  upheld  similar  sign-up  requirements  from \n4  challenges in the past. See Williams v. Fluiatt, No. CV-12-5017-JTR, 2013 WL 6795947 (E.D. \n5  Wash. Dec. 23, 2013); McDaniels v. Sherman, No. 09-1296-JCC, 2011 WL 197441 (W.D. \n6  Wash. Jan. 21, 2011).  \n7  Each year, approximately 500 individuals sign up for and participate in the Ramadan \n8  meal program. King Dec. at ยถ 6. The signup process is not burdensome. In fact, Plaintiffs \n9  concede that filling out the single page form takes only a few minutes. Counsel Dec., Ex. 2, at \n10  41:6-7; Counsel Dec., Ex. 5, at 54:24-55:3; Counsel Dec., Ex. 4, at 27:5-15. Additionally, \n11  because it is easy to determine the approximate time of Ramadan, Muslim inmates in DOC \n12  custody can anticipate the timing that the sign-up process will occur. Counsel Dec., Ex. 7, at \n13  70:11-70:25. Moreover, the two Plaintiffs who remain incarcerated were able to fill out the \n14  form and thereby observe their faith during Ramadan 2019 with DOC-provided fasting meals. \n15  DOCโs  requirement  that  Muslim  inmates  who  wish  to  participate  in  the  Ramadan  meal \n16  program  fill  out  and  submit  a  short  form  to  the  facility  chaplain  several  months  before \n17  Ramadan represents, at most, a negligible burden โ hardly one that puts โsubstantial pressure \n18  on an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs.โ Shakur, 514 F.3d at 888. \n19  Plaintiffsโ RLUIPA claims thus fail as a matter of law. \n20 \n2.  The Sign-up Process Serves a Compelling Interest  \n21    Even if the signup process were a substantial burden, it serves a compelling interest in \n22  that it enables DOC Food Service to plan for, source, prepare, and deliver the 30,000 Ramadan \n23  meals necessary for DOC to feed the Muslim inmates who observe Ramadan and sign up to \n24  participate in the Ramadan meal program while allowing it to also meet the needs of its own \n25  incarcerated inmates. See King Dec. at ยถ 7. Providing meals for the 500 or more individuals \n26  who participate in the Ramadan meal program each year is a significant undertaking. The \n \n \nDEFENDANTSโ MOTION FOR  16  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCorrections Division \nSUMMARY JUDGMENT \nPO Box 40116 \nNO. 2:18-CV-00837-RSM-BAT   Olympia, WA 98504-0116 \n(360) 586-1445 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00837-RSM   Document 73   Filed 07/09/19   Page 17 of 25\n \n1  17,500 inmates who do not participate in Ramadan have to be fed, and so the Ramadan meals \n2  are produced in addition to normal food production. As with all other diets, DOC is obligated \n3  to ensure the Ramadan meals are nutritious and meet dietary guidelines. King Dec. at ยถ 7. The \n4  Halal  certified  food  items  included  in  the  Ramadan  meals  come  from  limited  vendors \n5  nationwide. Those vendors require notice and lead time to produce and ship the food product to \n6  the food factory at Airway Heights Corrections Center (AHCC). King Dec. at ยถ 8. The AHCC \n7  food  factory  requires  time  to  plan  and  implement  a  production  schedule  to  prepare  and \n8  assemble the meals, and then deliver them to the other DOC facilities. Id. The other facilities \n9  require time to order food to meet their need, and to receive and prepare the meals for delivery \n10  to participating inmates. Heise Dec. at ยถ 7. This includes procuring and adding fresh fruit and \n11  vegetables to the meals received from the AHCC food factory. Id. \n12    Without a signup process that requires Muslim inmates to confirm in advance their \n13  desire to participate in the Ramadan meal program, DOC would not be able to meet its legal \n14  obligation to accommodate those inmates with nutritious, Halal meals to break their fast for the \n15  duration of the month-long Ramadan observance. The signup process therefore furthers the \n16  DOCโs  compelling  interest  in  planning  for  and  accommodating  the  religious  exercise  of \n17  individuals  in  its  custody.  See  Walker  v.  Beard,  789  F.3d  1125,  1136  (9th  Cir.  2015) \n18  (compliance with the Constitution can be a compelling state interest). And it does so in the \n19  least restrictive manner by requiring only that Muslim inmates fill out a short form that takes \n20  only a few minutes to complete, and to return the form to the facility Chaplain. The fact that \n21  500 or more inmates fill out and return the form and participate in the Ramadan meal program \n22  each  year  (including  several  of  the  Plaintiffs)  undermines  any  claim  that  the  process  is \n23  restrictive or burdens Plaintiffsโ or othersโ religious exercise.  \n24 \nD.  Plaintiffs Have Failed to Show a Viable Eighth Amendment Claim \n25    It is only โโthe unnecessary and wanton infliction of painโ . . . [which] constitutes cruel \n26  and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth Amendment.โ Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312, \n \n \nDEFENDANTSโ MOTION FOR  17  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCorrections Division \nSUMMARY JUDGMENT \nPO Box 40116 \nNO. 2:18-CV-00837-RSM-BAT   Olympia, WA 98504-0116 \n(360) 586-1445 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00837-RSM   Document 73   Filed 07/09/19   Page 18 of 25\n \n1  319 (1986) (citing Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 670 (1977)). The Eighth Amendment \n2  standard requires proof of both an objective and a subjective component. Hudson v. McMillian, \n3  503 U.S. 1 (1992). The objective component of an Eighth Amendment claim requires that the \n4  deprivation must be โsufficiently serious.โ Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834 (1994). The \n5  subjective component relates to the defendantโs state of mind, and requires deliberate indifference. \n6  Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834. In this case, Plaintiffsโ claims fail to meet both prongs. \n7    To be objectively, sufficiently serious, an individual must have been deprived of the \n8  minimal civilized measure of lifeโs necessities. Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 347 (1981). \n9  Although  inmates  have  a  right  to  adequate  food,  the  food  does  not  need  to  be  tasty  or \n10  aesthetically pleasing. See LeMaire v. Maass, 12 F.3d 1444, 1456 (9th Cir. 1993); Williams v. \n11  Berge, 102 Fed. Appโx 506, 507 (7th Cir. 2004) (inmate being served stale raisins and moldy \n12  peanut butter with other food was not an Eighth Amendment violation). Additionally, as long \n13  as an inmate is being provided adequate food, it does not matter the manner in which prisons \n14  deliver that food. See LeMaire, 12 F.3d at 1456; Green v. Ferrell, 801 F.2d 765, 770-71 (5th \n15  Cir. 1986) (two meals per day was adequate); Griffis v. Gundy, 47 Fed. Appโx 327, 328 (6th \n16  Cir. 2002) (diet of food loaf did not violate Eighth Amendment when loaf met nutritional and \n17  caloric requirements). Repeated  and unjustified failures to  provide inmates with  adequate \n18  sustenance could rise to the level of an Eighth Amendment violation. See Mendiola-Martinez \n19  v. Arpaio, 836 F.3d 1239, 1259 (9th Cir. 2016); Foster v. Runnels, 554 F.3d 807, 814 (9th Cir. \n20  2009). However, the Eighth Amendment is not violated when prison officials place reasonable \n21  conditions on receiving meals. Freeman v. Berge, 441 F.3d 543, 545 (7th Cir. 2006). \n22    The four Plaintiffs who were not on the Ramadan menu were not denied food adequate \n23  to meet their nutritional needs because each had the option to get mainline food. To the extent \n24  they argue the mainline meals did not meet their needs because of their sincerely held religious \n25  beliefs, that claim is more properly analyzed under RLUIPA or the First Amendment, not the \n26  Eighth Amendment. To the extent any of these four plaintiffs now try to raise an eleventh hour \n \n \nDEFENDANTSโ MOTION FOR  18  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCorrections Division \nSUMMARY JUDGMENT \nPO Box 40116 \nNO. 2:18-CV-00837-RSM-BAT   Olympia, WA 98504-0116 \n(360) 586-1445 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00837-RSM   Document 73   Filed 07/09/19   Page 19 of 25\n \n1  claim that they were denied access to the mainline food, such claims would not be exhausted \n2  because none of the plaintiffs filed grievances related to being denied the mainline food during \n3  Ramadan. Additionally, each of the four had the opportunity to get Ramadan meals in 2018; all \n4  they had to do was complete a simple form by the deadline. Therefore, regardless of the merit \n5  of such claims under RLUIPA or the First Amendment, these four Plaintiffsโ allegations do not \n6  raise an Eighth Amendment claim because they have failed to show a sufficiently serious \n7  deprivation. See McEachin v. McGuinnis, 357 F.3d 197, 204 (2d Cir. 2004); LeFevers v. Saffle, \n8  936 F.2d 1117, 1120 (10th Cir. 1991) (denial of religious diet does not state a cognizable \n9  Eighth Amendment claim). \n10    Jamesโ Eighth Amendment claims fail for similar reasons. James concedes he was \n11  given a Ramadan meal every day. Counsel Dec., Ex. 7, at 89:24-90:1. As such, James will not \n12  be able to present sufficient evidence to show that he was deprived of a nutritionally adequate \n13  diet during Ramadan because he was given the Ramadan meals that he requested and had the \n14  option to have his gluten free diet by not signing up to participate in the Ramadan meal \n15  program. โProviding meals that only accommodate either a prisonโs allergies or his religious \n16  beliefs  but  not  both  is  not  a  deprivation  of  โthe  minimal  civilized  measure  of  lifeโs \n17  necessities.โโ Payne v. Doe, 636 Fed. Appโx 120, 123 (3d Cir. 2016) (citations omitted). Thus, \n18  James does not present an objectively serious risk of harm under the Eighth Amendment. \n19    Even  if  Plaintiffs  were  able  to  establish  that  their  claimed  deprivations  met  the \n20  objective prong, Plaintiffs cannot establish that any of Defendants were deliberately indifferent \n21  to their need for basic sustenance. Two of the defendants (Jeff Uttecht and Chaplain Askren) \n22  were located at a different prison facility in 2018 and there is no evidence that they were aware \n23  of Plaintiffโs situation during Ramadan 2018 prior to this lawsuit being filed. Similarly, there is \n24  no evidence that Jamie Dolan, Steven Sinclair, or Superintendent Obenland were aware of \n25  Plaintiffsโ situations before this lawsuit. Although there is evidence that Fischer, Maxson, \n26  Parks, Rose, and Stewart were aware after the start of Ramadan that at least some of the four \n \n \nDEFENDANTSโ MOTION FOR  19  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCorrections Division \nSUMMARY JUDGMENT \nPO Box 40116 \nNO. 2:18-CV-00837-RSM-BAT   Olympia, WA 98504-0116 \n(360) 586-1445 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00837-RSM   Document 73   Filed 07/09/19   Page 20 of 25\n \n1  Plaintiffs were not on the Ramadan meal list, there is no evidence that these Defendants were \n2  aware of a serious risk to these inmatesโ health or that they acted unreasonably based on the \n3  information they had. Thus, there is insufficient evidence that any of the Defendants were \n4  deliberately indifferent to any of Plaintiffsโ health. \n5 \nE.  Plaintiff Have Failed to Show a Viable Free Exercise Claim \n6    For  a  prisoner  to  satisfy  a  First  Amendment  religious  claim,  he  โmust  show  the \n7  [defendant]  burdened  the  practice  of  [his]  religion,  by  preventing  him  from  engaging  in \n8  conduct  mandated  by  his  faith,  without  any  justification  reasonably  related  to  legitimate \n9  penological interests.โ Freeman v. Arpaio, 125 F.3d 732, 735 (9th Cir. 1997) (citing Turner v. \n10  Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89, 107 S. Ct. 2254 (1987). The Turner court provided four factors to \n11  guide reviewing courts in determining the reasonableness of the regulation. โFirst, there must \n12  be a โvalid, rational connectionโ between the prison regulation and the legitimate governmental \n13  interest put forward to justify it.โ Id. (citations omitted). A second factor is โwhether there are \n14  alternative means of exercising the rights that remain open to prison inmates.โ Id. at 90. The \n15  third consideration is the โimpact accommodation of the asserted constitutional right will have \n16  on guards and other inmates, and the allocation of prison resources generally.โ Id. Last, the \n17  โabsence of ready alternatives is evidence of the reasonableness of the regulation.โ Id. \n18    Because RLUIPA provides greater protection than the First Amendment, a policy that \n19  survives  RLUIPA  analysis  also  survives  a  First  Amendment  challenge.  Florer  v.  Bales-\n20  Johnson, 752 F. Supp. 2d 1185, 1202 (W.D. Wash. 2010). Because Defendantsโ actions did not \n21  violate  RLUIPA  for  the  reasons  discussed  above,  they  also  did  not  violate  the  First \n22  Amendment. Even if the Court were to find a triable RLUIPA claim, dismissal of the First \n23  Amendment claims would be appropriate. Plaintiffsโ First Amendment claims fail because the \n24  sign-up process does not impose a burden or prevent an inmate from exercising their faith.  \n25    Even  assuming,  for  the  sake  of  argument,  that  the  Ramadan  signup  process  does \n26  impose a burden, the process would still be constitutional because it is reasonably related to \n \n \nDEFENDANTSโ MOTION FOR  20  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCorrections Division \nSUMMARY JUDGMENT \nPO Box 40116 \nNO. 2:18-CV-00837-RSM-BAT   Olympia, WA 98504-0116 \n(360) 586-1445 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00837-RSM   Document 73   Filed 07/09/19   Page 21 of 25\n \n1  legitimate penological interests. DOCโs sign-up process is ultimately designed to ensure that \n2  DOC has accurate numbers of Ramadan participants to allow it effectively plan to provide the \n3  Ramadan  meal  program.  Cf.  Walker  v.  Beard,  789  F.3d  1125,  1138  (9th  Cir.  2015) \n4  (recognizing  avoiding  potential  legal  liability  as  a  legitimate  penological  interest).  As \n5  discussed above, the sign-up process is simple and the burden on an inmateโs exercise of their \n6  religion is minimal, if any. There is a logical and rational connection between this sign-up \n7  process and the goal of ensuring DOC can adequately provide enough food. Furthermore, if \n8  inmates do not wish to participate in the Ramadan meal program, there are alternative ways for \n9  inmates to practice their faith, including by fasting and breaking the fast with food purchased \n10  through the commissary, participating in the Ramadan prayer, or participating in other Islamic \n11  activities. The absence of a sign-up process will harm other inmates because it will create the \n12  potential that DOC be unable to plan adequately for Ramadan and run short of Ramadan meals. \n13  It will also create confusion and an increased burden on prison guards and kitchen staff who \n14  help administrate the Ramadan meal program.  There is no evidence that DOCโs sign up \n15  process is an exaggerated response to these concerns. Finally, with respect to Jamesโ claims, \n16  prison officials do not violate the First Amendment by providing regular Ramadan meals to an \n17  inmate on a therapeutic diet. Payne v. Doe, 636 Fed Appโx 120, 124 (3d Cir. 2016). Therefore, \n18  Plaintiffs do not have viable First Amendment claims and such claims should be dismissed. \n19 \nF.  Plaintiffs Have Failed to Show a Viable Equal Protection Claim \n20    The  Equal  Protection  Clause  โis  essentially  a  direction  that  all  persons  similarly \n21  situated should be treated alike.โ City of Cleburne, Tex. v. Cleburne Living Center, 473 U.S. \n22  432, 439 (1985). An Equal Protection claim requires an individual to โshow intentional or \n23  purposeful discrimination.โ See Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239 (1976); Draper v. Rhay, \n24  315 F.2d 193, 198 (9th Cir. 1963). The Equal Protection Clause, however, does not require \n25  absolute equality among inmates. Bruce v. Ylst, 351 F.3d 1283, 1288 (9th Cir. 2003). To \n26  survive summary judgment, an inmate must show he was not afforded a reasonable opportunity \n \n \nDEFENDANTSโ MOTION FOR  21  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCorrections Division \nSUMMARY JUDGMENT \nPO Box 40116 \nNO. 2:18-CV-00837-RSM-BAT   Olympia, WA 98504-0116 \n(360) 586-1445 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00837-RSM   Document 73   Filed 07/09/19   Page 22 of 25\n \n1  to pursue his faith compared to prisoners of other faiths and that such conduct was intentional. \n2  Freeman v. Arpaio, 125 F.3d 732 (9th Cir. 1997), overruled in part by Shakur v. Schriro, 514 \n3  F.3d 878, 884 (9th Cir. 2008).  If an inmate establishes that prison officials  intentionally \n4  discriminated based on an inmateโs religion, prison officials must bring forth some justification \n5  about the reason for the distinction. The Ninth Circuit has applied the Turner test to inmatesโ \n6  equal protection claims based on alleged religious discrimination. Shakur v. Schriro, 514 F.3d \n7  878, 891 (9th Cir. 2008).5 \n8    There is no evidence to support the claim that Muslim inmates were treated differently \n9  than other similarly situated inmates. All DOC inmates were required to follow the same sign-\n10  up process to participate in Ramadan, and there is no evidence that the sign-up process for \n11  Ramadan is more onerous than the sign-up process for Passover or other religious events. See \n12  Counsel Dec., Ex. 8, at 201:24-202:8. Assuming that inmates signed up through the process, \n13  Muslim  inmates  were  given  food  that  met  the  daily  calorie  requirements,  just  like  other \n14  inmates in DOC custody. Therefore, Plaintiffs are not able to show that they were treated \n15  differently than similarly situated inmates based on their religion. Furthermore, to the extent \n16  that Plaintiffs can claim that there are differential treatment, such treatment serves legitimate \n17  penological goals for the reasons discussed in the prior section.  \n18 \nG.  Plaintiffsโ  Money  Damage  Claims  Fail  Because  Defendants  Are  Entitled  to \nQualified Immunity \n19 \n \n20    In determining whether defendants are entitled to qualified immunity, the court makes a \n21  two-step inquiry. First, the court determines if plaintiff has shown that defendants violated his \n22  constitutional rights. Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001), overruled on other grounds by \n                                                 \n23 \n5 The level of scrutiny is not entirely clear in terms of equal protection claims related to alleged religious \ndiscrimination. Some district courts, at least in unpublished cases, in the Ninth Circuit have suggested that strict \n24 \nscrutiny applies to equal protection claims related to religious discrimination. See, e.g., Black v. Hansen, Cause \nNo. 11-2782-CMK-P, 2015 WL 1294965, at *7 (E.D. Cal. March 23, 2015). However, the Ninth Circuit has not \n25 \nsaid that explicitly and has applied Turner in cases like Shakur. The Court need not settle this question to resolve \nthis case because even if the Court were to apply strict scrutiny, Plaintiffs have failed to show intentional \n26 \ndiscrimination and the Ramadan meal programโs simple sign-up process would survive strict scrutiny. \n \n \nDEFENDANTSโ MOTION FOR  22  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCorrections Division \nSUMMARY JUDGMENT \nPO Box 40116 \nNO. 2:18-CV-00837-RSM-BAT   Olympia, WA 98504-0116 \n(360) 586-1445 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00837-RSM   Document 73   Filed 07/09/19   Page 23 of 25\n \n1  Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223 (2009). Second, the court must determine if the right was \n2  clearly established. Id. This requires the court to determine if it would have been clear to a \n3  reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted. Id. at 202. For \n4  a  right  to  be  clearly  established,  โexisting  precedent  must  have  placed  the  statutory  or \n5  constitutional  question  beyond  debate.โ  Reichle  v.  Howards,  566  U.S.  658,  664  (2012) \n6  (quoting Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. 731, 741 (2011)). The plaintiff bears the burden of \n7  proving that the right was clearly established. See Davis v. Scherer, 468 U.S. 183, 197 (1984).  \n8    Because Plaintiffs have failed to present viable claims of constitutional violations for \n9  the reasons discussed above, Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. Even if Plaintiffs \n10  could  raise  viable  constitutional  claims,  Defendants  would  still  be  entitled  to  qualified \n11  immunity because the law is not clearly established. There is no clearly established case law \n12  holding that prisons violate the First Amendment by requiring inmates to sign up in advance to \n13  participate in Ramadan. In fact, the published Ninth Circuit cases suggest otherwise.  See \n14  Resnick v. Adams, 348 F.3d 763, 771 (9th Cir. 2003) (concluding application requirement to \n15  receive religious diet did not violate First Amendment). And this Court has rejected similar \n16  challenges to similar sign-up requirements. See Williams v. Fluiatt, No. CV-12-5017-JTR, \n17  2013 WL 6795947 (E.D. Wash. Dec. 23, 2013); McDaniels v. Sherman, No. 09-1296-JCC, \n18  2011 WL 197441 (W.D. Wash. Jan. 21, 2011). There is also no published case law that \n19  suggests Defendants were required to create a therapeutic Ramadan diet for James or that they \n20  violated the First Amendment by declining to offer a gluten free Ramadan meal in 2018. See \n21  Payne v. Doe, 636 Fed Appโx 120, 124 (3d Cir. 2016); see also Leggett v. Solomon, No. 14-\n22  CT-3228-FL, 2017 WL 421915, at *4 (E.D.N.C. Jan. 31, 2017). With respect to Plaintiffsโ \n23  Eighth Amendment claims, courts have rejected similar claims and Plaintiffs will be unable to \n24  point to a consensus of authority on this issue. Finally, although Plaintiffsโ equal protection \n25  claims are somewhat difficult to decipher, Plaintiffs will be unable to point to any case law that \n26  clearly establishes that having a sign-up process violates the Equal Protection Clause. See \n \n \nDEFENDANTSโ MOTION FOR  23  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nCorrections Division \nSUMMARY JUDGMENT \nPO Box 40116 \nNO. 2:18-CV-00837-RSM-BAT   Olympia, WA 98504-0116 \n(360) 586-1445 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00837-RSM   Document 73   Filed 07/09/19   Page 24 of 25\n \n1  Garnica v. Wash. Depโt of Corr., 965 F. Supp. 2d 1250, 1275 (W.D. Wash. 2013) (rejecting \n2  equal protection challenge to Ramadan meal program). Therefore, Defendants are entitled to \n3  qualified immunity and Plaintiffsโ claims for monetary damages must be dismissed. \n4 \nH.  Plaintiffs Do Not Have a Viable Claim for Injunctive Relief Under Section 1983  \n5    In addition to meeting the traditional requirements for injunctive relief, a party seeking \n6  a permanent injunction must actually succeed on the merits. See e.g., Valley View Health Care \n7  Inc. v. Chapman, 992 F. Supp. 2d 1016, 1042 (E.D. Cal. 2014). An inmateโs release generally \n8  moots any injunctive relief claim. Dilley v. Gunn, 64 F.3d 1365 (9th Cir. 1995).Three Plaintiffs \n9  (Lao, Livingston, and Mohamed) have released from prison; their claims for injunctive relief \n10  are therefore moot. As to Roberts and James, they are not entitled to injunctive relief because \n11  they cannot show a viable Section 1983 claim on the merits, and their constitutional claims are \n12  also moot for the reasons discussed in Section III.B. Therefore, Plaintiffsโ claims for injunctive \n13  relief must be dismissed. \n14 \nIV.  CONCLUSION \n15    Defendants  respectfully  request  that  the  Court  grant  their  motion  for  summary \n16  judgment and dismiss Plaintiffsโ claims with prejudice.   \n17    RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED this 9th day of July, 2019. \n \n18 \n            ROBERT W.

Plaintiffs Damario \n3  Roberts, Mohamed Mohamed, Jeremy Livingston, Naim Lao, and John James are all sincere Muslims \n4  who observe the Ramadan fast.  But Defendants, all officials and employees of the Washington \n5  Department of Corrections, refused to feed them accordingly.  So when given the choice between \n6  starving and violating their religious faith, Plaintiffs chose to starve.  Fasting during the day and \n7  unable to eat at night, Plaintiffs lost significant weight and became sick with malnourishment. They \n8  were forced to purchase their own food and beg for other inmates to share food, against policy, to \n9  survive.  They did this all because Defendants imposed, and continue to impose, onerous and \n10  intrusive requirements for inmates to participate in Ramadan.   \n11  These requirements are illegal.  They are without justification.  Defendants did not refuse to \n12  feed Plaintiffs because it was too difficult.  They acknowledge they always have enough food on \n13  hand, and that itโs easy to take a halal meal out of the freezer, heat it up after sunset, and feed fasting \n14  Muslim inmates.  Instead Defendants refused to feed Plaintiffs because of their irrational, \n15  bureaucratic policies.  After all, the Defendants reasoned, it was Plaintiffsโ choice to starve.  \n16  Defendants gave themselves discretion to disagree with Plaintiffsโ religious beliefs, suggesting โAllah \n17  is all mercifulโ and will forgive Plaintiffs if โ due to Defendantsโ refusal to provide Ramadan meals โ \n18  Plaintiffs violate their faith by eating lunch.   \n19  The U.S. Constitution and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act forbid \n20  the Washington Department of Corrections from substituting the Governmentโs discretionary \n21  opinions regarding religious accommodations for Muslimsโ actual religious practice of Ramadan.  The \n22  Department is required to accommodate fasting inmates, not starve them.   \n23  This Court should enter summary judgment on liability against all Defendants and enjoin the \n24  WSDOC from adopting or implementing any policy which prevents Muslim inmates from fasting \n25  during any future Ramadan. \n26  STATEMENT OF MATERIAL UNDISPUTED FACTS \n27  A.  Plaintiffsโ Sincere Religious Beliefs Require Fasting During Ramadan \n28  1.  All the Plaintiffs are practicing Muslims who sincerely believe that observing the \n    - 1 -   \nPLAINTIFFSโ MEMORANDUM ISO SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00837-RSM   Document 79-1   Filed 07/09/19   Page 5 of 24\n \n1  Ramadan fast is required by their religious faith.  Livingston Dep., Ex. 25, 27:24-30-25; Mohamed \n2  Dep., Ex. 27, 21:20-22:25; James Dep., Ex. 26, 8:8-8:13, 20:3-20:11; Lao Dep., Ex. 33, 24:20-26:5; \n3  Roberts Dep., Ex. 34, 12:18-13:7, 23:5-23:7. \n4  2.  In accordance with their Islamic faith, Plaintiffs, along with Muslims worldwide, \n5  observe  Ramadan  as  a  month  of  fasting.   See  Ramadan  Memo, Ex. 2 at 5. During Ramadan, \n6  โparticipating Muslims refrain from eating and drinking from dawn until sunset.โ Id.  According to the \n7  sincerely-held religious beliefs of the plaintiffs, Muslims fast โfor the sake of God.โ Id. Though Muslims \n8  fast from dawn until sunset, Muslims are permitted to consume food and drink liquids during the \n9  remaining hours of the day (sunset until dawn). Id.; see also Obenland Dep., Ex. 28, 22:5-23:13 \n10  (explaining Ramadan). \n11  B.  The WSDOC Ramadan Sign-Up Process Is Intentionally Designed to Restrict \n12  Inmate Participation in the Ramadan Meal Program \n13  3.  Each year, the Washington Department of Corrections issues a Memorandum from \n14  the Corrections Program Administrator and the Food Services Administrator addressed to โAll \n15  Incarcerated Individuals.โ  Stewart Dep, Ex. 20, 63:20-25, 64:1-2.  The Memorandum (the โRamadan \n16  Memoโ) explains the Ramadan sign-up process that inmates are required to follow in order to be added \n17  to the Ramadan Meal Program.  It sets a sign-up deadline for two weeks after the issuance date of the \n18  Ramadan Memo.  Stewart Dep., Ex. 20, 32:12-24, 52:19-54:18.  Attached to the Ramadan Memo is a \n19  Ramadan Meal Request Form the inmates are required to fill out as part of the sign-up process. Stewart \n20  Dep., Ex. 20, 34:17-37:9; Ex. 2 at 1-3. \n21  4.  The Department and WDOC headquarters do not follow up with any of the twelve \n22  correctional facilities to ensure the Ramadan Memo is in fact posted in visible areas. Stewart Dep., Ex. \n23  20, 40:6-41:17, Sherman Dep., Ex. 23, 41:19-24, 56:4-22.  In 2019 the Department conducted a focus \n24  group at the Washington State Penitentiary and concluded the facility had failed to post the Ramadan \n25  Memo, but did not follow-up regarding other facilitiesโ compliance.  Stewart 30(b)(6) Dep., Ex. 21 at \n26  46:7-47:7, 47:24-48:19.  In fact, Defendant Sherman, Chaplain of Monroe Correctional Complex \n27  (โMCCโ) responsible for posting the Ramadan Memo at his facilities, acknowledged that he never \n28  verified whether the Ramadan Memo was ever posted at any of MCCโs units.  Sherman Dep., Ex. 23 \n    - 2 -   \nPLAINTIFFSโ MEMORANDUM ISO SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00837-RSM   Document 79-1   Filed 07/09/19   Page 6 of 24\n \n1 \nat 56:4-22. \n2 \n5.  Upon being hired as the Correctional Program Administrator in 2012, Defendant \n3 \nStewart added criteria for participation in the Ramadan Meal Program.  Stewart Dep., Ex. 20, 36:6-\n4 \n37:9.  The added criteria have not been changed since, remaining the same in 2019.  Stewart Dep., Ex. \n5 \n20, 64:3-17; Stewart 30(b)(6) Dep., Ex. 21, 6:25-7:2; Ramadan 2019 Memo, Ex. 35. \n6 \n6.  Inmates are eligible to participate in the Ramadan Meal Program if they satisfy one of \n7 \ntwo criteria as of the date of the Ramadan Memo: โRamadan participant approval will be based on \n8 \nparticipation in Islamic/Muslim religious programming over the past six (6) months or those currently \n9 \non a halal meal.โ  Stewart Dep., Ex. 20, 37:25-38:17, 64:10-14; see ex. Ex. 2 at 1-3. \n10 \n7.  Defendant Stewart added the criteria as requirements to the Ramadan Sign-Up Process \n11 \nin order โto try to weed out individuals who donโt practice the faith,โ and to ensure that only people \n12 \nwho are โpracticing some aspect of the faithโ and โhave some sort of sincerity toward the faithโ are \n13 \nadded.  Stewart Dep., Ex. 20, 43:1-21, 50:17-52:24. \n14 \n8.  An inmate can be denied participation in the Ramadan Meal Program based on how \n15 \nthey  answer  the  questions  on  the  Ramadan  Meal  Request  Form  that  pertain  to  criteria \n16 \neligibility.  Stewart Dep., Ex. 20, 37:11-16.  See, e.g., Ex. 2. at 3. \n17 \n9.  An inmate who immediately signs up for Islamic religious programming after the \n18 \nRamadan Memo is issued cannot satisfy the first criteria of โparticipation in Islamic/Muslim religious \n19 \nprogramming over the past six (6) months.โ  Stewart Dep., Ex. 20, 47:18-48:21. \n20 \n10.  An inmate who immediately signs up for a halal meal diet after the Ramadan Memo is \n21 \nissued cannot satisfy the second criteria of being โcurrently on a halal meal,โ and would therefore only \n22 \nbe permitted to participate in the Ramadan Meal Program if they attended Islamic/Muslim religious \n23 \nprogramming for six months prior to the date of the Ramadan Memo.  Stewart Dep., Ex. 20, 41:18-\n24 \n43:5. \n25 \n11.  The religious diet sign-up period occurs twice a year (November to April 15 and May \n26 \nto October 15) and the religious diet is implemented twice a year (May 1 and November 1).  Stewart \n27 \nDep., Ex. 20, 55:5-56:21. An inmate who signs up for a halal diet during the current religious diet sign-\n28 \n    - 3 -   \nPLAINTIFFSโ MEMORANDUM ISO SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00837-RSM   Document 79-1   Filed 07/09/19   Page 7 of 24\n \n1 \nup period and before the date of the Ramadan Memo and whose halal diet will not be implemented \n2 \nuntil after the date the Ramadan Memo is issued, cannot satisfy the second criteria of being โcurrently \n3 \non a halal meal.โ  Stewart Dep., Ex. 20, 38:10-25, 42:8-24.  \n4 \n12.  Participation in the Islamic religious holidays Eid al-Fitr or Eid al-Adha is not enough \n5 \nto qualify an inmate to participate in the Ramadan Meal Program.  Stewart Dep., Ex. 20, 116:22-25. \n6 \n13.  Nor is possession of Islamic religious items or an affidavit from a Muslim religious \n7 \nleader confirming the inmate is a Muslim enough to qualify an inmate for participation.  Stewart Dep., \n8 \nEx. 20, 117:1-9. \n9 \n14.  If a facility chaplain believes an exception should be applied to allow an inmate to \n10 \nparticipate in the Ramadan Meal Program, they are required to contact Defendant Stewartโs office to \n11 \nexplain the reasons for the exception.  Stewart Dep., Ex. 20, 59:13-60:19. Someone from Defendant \n12 \nStewartโs office would then decide whether to allow that inmate to participate.  Id. \n13 \n15.  In 2018, Ramadan began on May 16.  The Ramadan Memo was issued on January 16, \n14 \n2018 and inmates had until 5 pm on January 30, 2018 to sign-up to participate in the Ramadan Meal \n15 \nProgram.  Ex. 2.  Facility chaplains had a separate deadline of February 15, 2018 to submit a request \n16 \nfor an exception to Defendant Stewartโs office for consideration.  Stewart Dep., Ex. 20, 69:12-25 to \n17 \n70:1-16.  โNo signup forms [were] accepted after February 15, 2018.  Inmates are not notified of the \n18 \ndeadline set for chaplains to submit requests for exceptions.  Stewart Dep., Ex. 20, 69:12-25 to 70:1-\n19 \n16. \n20 \n16.  An inmate that has been denied from participating in the Ramadan Meal Program will \n21 \nnot receive any Ramadan meals.  Stewart Dep., Ex. 20, 67-68.  The Department does not provide \n22 \ninmates that choose to fast Ramadan but missed the sign-up period with any food to eat that they can \n23 \nconsume from sunset to sunrise, in accordance with their sincerely held religious beliefs.  Stewart \n24 \n30(b)(6) Dep., Ex. 21 at 10:4-12. \n25 \n17.  An inmate prescribed a medical diet is forced to choose between (a) maintaining their \n26 \nhealth by continuing their medical diet and sacrificing their sincerely-held religious beliefs by not \n27 \nparticipating in the Ramadan Meal Program and (b) participating in the Ramadan Meal Program and \n28 \n    - 4 -   \nPLAINTIFFSโ MEMORANDUM ISO SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00837-RSM   Document 79-1   Filed 07/09/19   Page 8 of 24\n \n1 \nsacrificing their health by discontinuing their medical diet.  Stewart Dep., Ex. 20, 63:3-12. \n2 \n18.  When asked what options an inmate has to sustain himself if he has a sincerely-held \n3 \nreligious belief that he is prohibited from eating during daylight hours during the month of Ramadan \n4 \nand he was also denied from getting meals during nighttime hours, Defendant Sherman responded that \n5 \nโ[h]is options would be to eat the mainline food thatโs coming in.  That Allah is called merciful and \n6 \nthat he would understand that he did not have any other options in order to sustain himself and that \n7 \nhe would then be required to โ that he would be forgiven for eating during non-Ramada[n] hours or \n8 \ndays.โ  Sherman Dep., Ex. 23 at 122:18-25, 123:8-13. \n9 \nC.  Defendants Denied Plaintiffsโ Participation in Ramadan \n10 \n19.  Damario Roberts was denied multiple grievances for being denied participation in \n11 \nRamadan 2018.  In one of those grievances, he stated โI am a practicing Muslim and Chaplain Sherman \n12 \nrefuses to put me on the ramadan list because I have not gone to 6 straight months of jumah, It is not \n13 \nagainst my religion not to go to jumah. It is not against my religion not to go to jumah and I am fasting \n14 \nfor ramadan.  I am not getting fed through DOC.โ  Ex. 8. \n15 \n20.  Mohamed was denied grievances he filed during 2017 and 2018 regarding participation \n16 \nin Ramadan.  In his grievance filed May 30, 2018, he stated โ[t]his is the second year am going thru this \n17 \nprocess and they keep not putting me on the Ramadan list after I filled out the form before the deadline.  \n18 \nI canโt go to regular mainline because I canโt bring the food back and Iโll get infracted.  I canโt eat after \n19 \nsundown and I have no food to practice my religion.  This is mandatory to fast the month of Ramadan.  \n20 \nI spoke with the Chaplain and told me he canโt help.โ  Defendants Sherman and Maxson denied this \n21 \ngrievance  despite  confirming  that  he  met  the  religious  event  participation  requirement  because \n22 \nโChaplain Fischer stated he searched his office for the form and was unable to find a Ramadan Meal \n23 \nrequest form.โ  Ex. 7.   \n24 \n21.  Jeremy Livingston was denied an emergency grievance he filed during Ramadan 2018 \n25 \nfor being denied Ramadan meals.  Livingston had sent numerous messages complaining over the prior \n26 \nmonths to Defendant Sherman and others that he keeps being placed on callout for Christian services \n27 \nwhen he has repeatedly requested to be placed on callout for jumuโah prayer.  Nonetheless, Defendant \n28 \n    - 5 -   \nPLAINTIFFSโ MEMORANDUM ISO SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00837-RSM   Document 79-1   Filed 07/09/19   Page 9 of 24\n \n1 \nSherman denied his request to participate in Ramadan based on failure to meet the six month Islamic \n2 \nevent participation criteria.  Ex. 6; Ex. 14l Sherman Dep., Ex. 23 at 175:4 to 182:7. \n3 \n22.  Defendant Sherman testified he initially denied Mohamedโs grievance because he didnโt \n4 \nfind a record of his participation in jumuโah services at that time because Mohamed was likely โslipping \n5 \nout and going to Jumahโ instead of going to his GED classes.  Sherman Dep., Ex. 23 at 158:12-22.  \n6 \nEx. 14. \n7 \n23.  Naim Lao filed multiple emergency grievances regarding the denial of his participation \n8 \nin Ramadan, all of which were denied.  โYesterday I was feeling dizzy and my limbs were tingly and \n9 \napproached [sic] Sargent Parks stating that there is something clearly wrong with me and that I am \n10 \nabout to pass out and explain to him what was going on and he said that if I donโt start eating then \n11 \nsooner or later they are going to have to force feed me.  My friend Vincent had to help me walk the \n12 \nrest of the way back to my cellโฆ There is no need to force feed me just let me bring some food back \n13 \nto the cell and I will eat when my religion allows it.  Please feed me.  This is the fourth day in a row \n14 \nthat DOC has yet to feed me for ramadan and I am very HUNGRY.โ  Lao Dep., Ex. 9. \n15 \n24.  John James has Celiacโs Disease, which requires him to eat a gluten-free diet.  James \n16 \nDep., Ex. 26 at 89:5-13.  Nevertheless, James was denied multiple grievances filed over the course of \n17 \nseveral years to obtain gluten-free meals during Ramadan.  James Dep., Ex. 26 at 107:12-20; Stewart \n18 \nDep., Ex. 20 at 142:11-143:19; Stewart 30(b)(6) Dep., Ex. 21 at 57:11-14; 58:13-16; 60:17-25; Ex. 10. \n19 \nWSDOCโs policy does not allow โalternative mealsโ during Ramadan, which the Department deems \n20 \nโspecial meals for special people.โ Stewart Dep., Ex. 20, 60:21-61:22. The WSDOC had no other \n21 \nreason besides its โno special meals for special peopleโ rule to deny this request.  This is even though \n22 \nit is not difficult for WSDOC to accommodate a single request of a Ramadan gluten-free meal for the \n23 \nmonth of Ramadan.  Stewart Dep., Ex. 10; Ex. 20 at 144:6-147:8. In one of multiple grievances that \n24 \nwere denied, filed during Ramadan 2015, he stated โI want to grieve against SCCC Food Service for \n25 \npoisoning meโฆ I began experiencing extreme diarrhea, head achs [sic] and body pains. Which lead to \n26 \nthrowing upโฆ PA Erin Lystad examined me andโฆ told me I had food poisoningโฆ I told her all Iโve \n27 \nhad to eat since 6-17-2015 was Ramadan meals.โ  Ex. 10 at 13. \n28 \n    - 6 -   \nPLAINTIFFSโ MEMORANDUM ISO SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00837-RSM   Document 79-1   Filed 07/09/19   Page 10 of 24\n \n1 \n25.  In 2014, WSDOC modified its Religious Programs Policy (Policy No. DOC 560.200) \n2 \nto โ[a]djust[] that therapeutic diets take precedence over religious diets unless refused at the time of \n3 \nmedical encounter.โ  Thus, inmates are forced to choose between their prescribed medical diet and \n4 \ntheir religious dietary needs.  This modification was made despite WSDOC having only received a \n5 \nsingle request โ by Plaintiff John James โ for a Ramadan diet to also be a therapeutic diet.  Stewart \n6 \n30(b)(6), Ex. 21 at 57:6-25 to 58:10-20; Sherman Dep., Ex.  23 at 10:14-17; Ex. 12 at 1; Simpson Dep., \n7 \nEx. 29 at 88: 8-12. \n8 \nD.  Defendants Denied Other Inmatesโ Participation in Ramadan \n9 \n26.  On January 28, 2018, Chaplain Luce submitted a request to Defendant Stewart for \n10 \nguidance as to whether an exception can be given to Inmate Vader stating:  \n11 \nโฆ [H]e has not attended any Muslim services at all, and is not on Halal dietโฆ He said he did \n12  Ramadan in the past; on OMNI he did Ramadan in 2013 and 2015.  He said he grew up in an \nAfrican-American foster home and did Ramadan on the street.  However he is clear that he is \n13  not a practicing Muslim.  From his description he is more like Bahai where all religions are \none.  Because of this I gave him information on the Bahaโi The Fast which is coming up in \n14  March and encouraged him to think it over.  Please provide guidance to me as to if I can deny \nhim or should add him specifically for Ramadan as an exception to the Islamic faith.  The \n15  tension would be that he does not pray to Allah and does not recognize Allah as God per \nse.  This might offender our Muslim men, rightfully so. Ex 3 at 4145. \n16 \nStewart responded โI do not understand why you need guidance.  The answer is 100 percent \n17 \nevident.โ  Inmate Vader was denied participation.  Stewart Dep., Ex. 20 at 78:2-80:18. Ex. 3 at 4147-\n18 \n4147. \n19 \n27.  On May 16, 2018, Defendant Stewart removed Inmate Hussein from participating in \n20 \nthe Ramadan Meal Program without explanation despite having been added as an exception the day \n21 \nprior by the Superintendent of that correctional facility.  Stewart Dep., Ex. 20 at 81:21-82:20; Ex. 3 at \n22 \n9680-9681. \n23 \n28.  Defendant Stewart denied Inmate Costello from participating in the Ramadan Meal \n24 \nProgram despite Chaplain Jakstas of Larch Corrections Center requesting an exception be made on \n25 \nthe basis that he was admitted to the Department after the Ramadan sign-up deadline: โIโm not adding \n26 \nCostello because he did not meet the requirement of signing up on timeโฆ  [Statewide Muslim \n27 \nChaplain] Rasheed, I believe you said at one time a new convert should not participate in Ramadan \n28 \n    - 7 -   \nPLAINTIFFSโ MEMORANDUM ISO SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00837-RSM   Document 79-1   Filed 07/09/19   Page 11 of 24\n \n1 \nuntil they know more about the faith as it will be too hard on them.โ  Ex. 3 at 9796-9801.  Defendant \n2 \nStewart explained that โ[she] did that based on conversations that I had in the past with Chaplain \n3 \nRasheed, and he said new converts should not be added the first year... new converts should not be โ \n4 \nshould not go through Ramadan during early on in their conversion because it is too hard to do that \n5 \n30-day fast.  They have no idea of the magnitude of what it takes to do that.โ  Stewart Dep., Ex. 20 at \n6 \n87:10-90:12. \n7 \n29.  In the same email, Defendant Stewartโs staff added two other inmates Chaplain Jakstas \n8 \nhad identified along with Inmate Costello to participate in the Ramadan Meal Program because they โ \n9 \nlike Costello โ arrived at the Department after the sign-up period.

Ex. 3 at 7634-7635; Stewart Dep., Ex. 20 at 97:8-101:21. He explained in his \n13 \ngrievance: โI received a message back from Chaplain Wakemanโฆthat due to me not participating in \n14 \nthe Islamic Juma service within the last six (6) months that I wonโt be allowed to participate in \n15 \nRamada[n].

Inmate Rollins was denied \n23 \nagain in 2018 for the same reason.

Heise Dep., Ex. 32, 37:2-38:25; Stewart Dep., \n13 \nEx. 20, 62:2-10. The only difference is that instead of having three or more meals a day, at Ramadan \n14 \nthere are only two significant meals, the Suhoor (morning meal) and the Iftar (evening/break fast meal).   \n15 \nHeise Dep., Ex. 32, 37:2-9. \n16 \n34.  Halal meals are kept frozen on site at the correctional facilities. Heise Dep, Ex. 32, \n17 \n35:14-21. Each costs about $1.50.  Simpson 54:12-25. They can be ordered in as short as one week in \n18 \nadvance.  Heise Dep., Ex. 32, 47:6-13. There is always enough.  Heise Dep., Ex. 32, 20:20-23:3; 35:14-\n19 \n36:22. The inmates heat up their own food without a problem.  Heise Dep., Ex. 32, 46:14-18; Stewart \n20 \nDep., Ex. 20, 61:5-9. If the inmates could not heat them up, there is no issue with The WSDOC doing \n21 \nso.  Heise Dep., Ex. 32, 39:16-17.  \n22 \n35.  To the extent they require more halal meals, The WSDOC can just order additional \n23 \nfood.  Heise Dep., Ex. 32, 47:6-13. To the extent the prison orders too many Ramadan meals, the \n24 \nRamadan meals can simply be repurposed as ordinary halal meals.  Heise Dep., Ex. 32, 38:14-25. The \n25 \ncost effects are minimal, and The WSDOC has not calculated any additional cost to add anyone to the \n26 \nRamadan List.  Heise Dep., Ex. 32, 27:25-29:6. \n27 \n36.  There is no administrative problem requiring any significant lead time to prepare.  \n28 \n    - 9 -   \nPLAINTIFFSโ MEMORANDUM ISO SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00837-RSM   Document 79-1   Filed 07/09/19   Page 13 of 24\n \n1 \nIndeed, in 2019, the prison needed more Ramadan meals and with one phone call those meals arrived \n2 \nwithin a couple of hours.  In 2018, The WSDOC was forced by court order to add people at the last \n3 \nsecond to the Ramadan List, and yet The WSDOC could not identify any additional costs or problems \n4 \nwith compliance.  Obenland Dep., Ex. 28, 43:17-46:16; Stewart 30(b)(6) Dep., Ex. 21, 26:2-27:7.  In \n5 \n2019, the Monroe Correctional Complex added six inmates to the Ramadan list the first week of \n6 \nRamadan, Obenland Dep., Ex. 28, 15:21-17:13,  and there were zero logistical problems, Obenland \n7 \nDep., Ex. 28, 28:2-13. \n8 \n37.  Department of Corrections creates menus with a range of caloric levels to meet the \n9 \nneeds of most of their population.  Carney Dep., Ex. 22, 8:7-9. The WSDOC use nutritional standards \n10 \nfor their menus that come from established dietary guidelines. Carney Dep., Ex. 22, 13:6-20. And there \n11 \nis no reason that The WSDOC could not do the same for Ramadan meals.

Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247 (1986). \n17 \nI.  Defendantsโ Ramadan Policies and Practices Violate RLUIPA \n18 \nFor reasons no greater than marginal administrative convenience, knowing the pain it will cause \n19 \nthe many Muslim inmates who observe Ramadanโs fast, Defendants deprived Plaintiffs of food.  In \n20 \ndoing so, they violate RLUIPA, the law Congress passed to ensure prisons and jails across the country \n21 \nallow inmates in custody to practice their faith.   \n22 \nA.  RLUIPA Requires Defendants to Accommodate Ramadan Fasting \n23 \n  RLUIPA exists to make it illegal for the Department to do what it has done here: deprive \n24 \nMuslim inmates of food, and sometimes even water, between sunset and dawn so the inmates may \n25 \nobserve the Ramadan fast during the day.  Section 3 of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized \n26 \nPersons Act of 2000, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000cc creates a private cause of action for such persons who allege \n27 \nthat a state government has substantially burdened their religious conduct. 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000cc-1(a), \n28 \n    - 10 -   \nPLAINTIFFSโ MEMORANDUM ISO SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00837-RSM   Document 79-1   Filed 07/09/19   Page 14 of 24\n \n1  2(a).  Unlike cases arising under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, RLUIPA applies \n2  even where the burden on the prisoner โresults from a rule of general applicability.โ  42 U.S.C. ยง \n3  2000cc-1(a).  \n4    To establish a claim under RLUIPA, a plaintiff bears the initial burden of showing (1) that he \n5  seeks to engage in an exercise of religion, and (2) that the challenged practice substantially burdens that \n6  exercise of religion. 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000cc-2(b). Once a plaintiff has established this prima facie case, a \n7  defendant bears the burden of proving that imposition of the burden is in โfurtherance of a compelling \n8  governmental interestโ and โis the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental \n9  interest.โ  42 U.S.C. ยง 2000cc-1(a)(1)-(2). \n10  B.  All Plaintiffs Are and Were Muslims who Adhere to One of the Five Pillars of \n11  Islam Directing Adherents to Fast During Ramadan  \n12  All of the Plaintiffs are Muslims who believe that observing the Ramadan fast is required by \n13  their faith.  Livingston Dep., Ex. 25, 27:24-30-25; Mohamed Dep., Ex. 27, 21:20-22:25; James Dep., \n14  Ex. 26, 8:8-8:13, 20:3-20:11; Lao Dep., Ex. 33, 24:20-26:5; Roberts Dep., Ex. 34, 12:18-13:7, 23:5-23:7.  \n15  It is why, in spite of Defendants failure to provide them food, they maintained their fast through \n16  substantial weight loss and symptoms of malnutrition and starvation.   \n17  C.  Without food after sunset, Defendants Substantially Burden The Ability of \n18  Muslim Inmates to Observe Ramadanโs Fast \n19  In passing RLUIPA, Congress required that all prisons, jails, and detention centers make great \n20  efforts to accommodate the religious practices of those in custody.  Those great efforts, whatever else \n21  they include, must give Plaintiffs and other Muslim inmates food compatible with their religious \n22  practices.  โCongress enacted RLUIPA โฆ in order to provide very broad protection for religious \n23  libertyโ to prisoners.  Holt v. Hobbs, 135 S. Ct. 853, 859 (2015).   \n24  As the Ninth Circuit has made clear, all inmatesโincluding the plaintiffsโโhave the right to \n25  be provided with food sufficient to sustain them in good health that satisfies the dietary laws of their \n26  religion.โ McElyea v. Babbitt, 833 F.2d 196, 198 (9th Cir. 1987); see also England v. Walsh, 727 Fed. Appx \n27  255, 256-7 (9th Cir. 2018) (unpublished opinion); Porter v. Wegman, 671 Fed. Appx. 442, 443 (9th Cir. \n28  2016) (unpublished opinion); Dickinson v. Arizona Depโt of Corr., 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 16026 *3 (9th \n    - 11 -   \nPLAINTIFFSโ MEMORANDUM ISO SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00837-RSM   Document 79-1   Filed 07/09/19   Page 15 of 24\n \n1  Cir. 1999) (unpublished opinion); Logan v. Lewis, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 3751 *3-4 (9th Cir. 1998) \n2  (unpublished opinion). Courts have โrepeatedly held that forcing an inmate to choose between daily \n3  nutrition and religious practice is a substantial burden,โ particularly during Ramadan.  See, e.g., Thompson \n4  v. Holm, 809 F.3d 376, 380 (7th Cir. 2016) (collecting cases and finding a substantial burden where \n5  prison denied inmate Ramadan meals for two days).   \n6  A substantial burden exists, then, whenever a facility either forces an inmate to choose between \n7  eating a diet that violates his faith and going without food at all for a period of time that inflicts on \n8  Plaintiffs an โadverse physical effect..โ Shakur v. Schriro, 514 F.3d 878, 888-89 (9th Cir. 2008); see also \n9  Vincent v. Stewart, 757 Fed. Appx. 578, 580-81 (9th Cir. 2018) (unpublished opinion); Rawlins v. Stewart, \n10  10 Fed. Appx. 446, 446 (9th Cir. 2001) (unpublished opinion).  With respect to this point of law, the \n11  Ninth Circuit is much like other circuit courts that have confronted similar issues. See Love v. Reed, 216 \n12  F.3d 682, 689-690 (8th Cir. 2000) (finding prison's failure to accommodate prisoner's religious diet a \n13  violation of RLUIPA and rejecting prison's suggestion that the prisoner could fast as an alternative to \n14  the prison's accommodation of the desired diet); Nelson v. Miller, 570 F.3d 868, 879 (7th Cir. 2009); \n15  Hunafa v. Murphy, 907 F.2d 46 (7th Cir. 1990).   \n16  Here, the undisputable facts show that the Departmentโs Ramadan practices offered Plaintiffs \n17  food only when their faith did not allow them to eat.  It is a fact that the Department will, because it \n18  must, concede. All four plaintiffs urged Defendants to provide them with food after sunset so that \n19  they could break their daily, dawn-to-sunset fast and prepare for the next dayโs fast.  The Defendants \n20  knew because they were told repeatedly that plaintiffs could not and would not eat food from dawn to \n21  sunset.  For example, Naim Lao begged for food, explaining that he โwas feeling dizzyโ and that his \n22  โlimbs were tingly.โ  Lao Dep., Ex. 9 at 4.  โPlease feed me,โ he wrote in a grievance that was \n23  thoughtlessly rejected.  โ[J]ust let me bring some food back to the cell and I will eat when my religion \n24  allows it.โ  Id.  John James, who has Celiac disease, also pleaded his case to Defendants, explaining that \n25  eating gluten-laden meals caused him โextreme diarrhea, head aches, and body pains.โ  Ex. 10 at 13.  \n26  From Mr. Jamesโ perspective, it seemed as if the facility, with deliberate intention, was โpoisoningโ \n27  him.  Id.  And still, Defendants unthinking obedience to Department Ramadan practices prevented \n28  them from providing all fasting inmates with food at a time that they could make use of it.  Because \n    - 12 -   \nPLAINTIFFSโ MEMORANDUM ISO SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00837-RSM   Document 79-1   Filed 07/09/19   Page 16 of 24\n \n1  Defendants would not provide food when Plaintiffsโ religious beliefs permitted them to eat, and \n2  altogether denied John James gluten-free food during Ramadan, Defendants have denied Muslim \n3  inmates observing Ramadan food โthat satisfies the dietary laws of their religion.โ McElyea v. Babbitt, \n4  833 F.2d 196, 198 (9th Cir. 1987).  For RLUIPA, this burden is as substantial of a burden as there ever \n5  was.   \n6  D.  Because Depriving Muslim Inmates of Food Consistent with their Religious \n7  Beliefs Substantially Burdens RLUIPA rights, Defendants Must Identify a \n8  Compelling Interestโa Showing They Cannot Make \n9  A compelling interest does not exist just because a defendant labels its interest as compelling.  \n10  This Court must do more and ferret out exactly what interest is at stake.  And here, Defendantsโ interest \n11  in denying food to Muslim inmates observing Ramadanโs fast boils down to, at most, a marginal effort \n12  to achieve a small, indeterminate amount of cost savings.  \n13  Defendants acknowledge that Ramadan meals are halal meals kept frozen that cost just $1.50 \n14  each.  Simpson 54:12-25 They acknowledge that it takes just a weekโnot six monthsโto order and \n15  receive halal meals.  And the undisputed evidence indicates that Muslim inmates seeking to fast during \n16  Ramadan can heat up their own frozen meals without creating any extra administrative burdens for \n17  Defendants.  Nothing indicates how flimsy Defendants interest is here than the fact that, though \n18  Defendants have been compelled to add Muslim inmates to the Ramadan list this year and last year, \n19  they cannot any additional costs or problems with compliance.  Obenland Dep., Ex. 28, 43:17-46:16; \n20  Stewart 30(b)(6) Dep., Ex. 21, 26:2-27:7. \n21  These ethereal savings and conveniences, if they exist at all and are not just a pretext for \n22  religious animosity, do not constitute compelling need. RLUIPA itself recognizes that it โmay require \n23  a government to incur expenses in its own operations to avoid imposing a substantial burden on \n24  religious exercise.โ 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000cc-3(c). Thus, RLUIPA may override some fiscal policy decisions, \n25  and, without more, a desire to curb costs is not a compelling interest that can justify a substantial \n26  burden on the free exercise of religion. See Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S.Ct 2751, 2781 (2014) \n27  (stating  that  RFRA  and  RLUIPA  may  require  the  government  to  expend  additional  funds  to \n28  accommodate citizensโ religious beliefs).   \n    - 13 -   \nPLAINTIFFSโ MEMORANDUM ISO SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00837-RSM   Document 79-1   Filed 07/09/19   Page 17 of 24\n \n1  If cost containment were a compelling government interest in all circumstances, RLUIPA \n2  would be irreparably weakened. โTo allow government conduct to survive strict scrutiny each time the \n3  government claims that accommodating an inmateโs religion would impose some cost or inefficiency, \n4  would be to impermissibly weaken RLUIPAโs effect.โ Bilal v. Lehman, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93152 at \n5  *30 (W.D. Wash. Oct. 2, 2006) (quoting Madison v. Riter, 240 F. Supp. 2d 566, 578 n. 10 (W.D. Va. 2003)). \n6  While some courts have held that limiting costs can be a compelling interest in certain \n7  circumstances, marginal cost savings is never a compelling interest. See Luckette v. Lewis, 883 F. Supp. \n8  471, 480 (D. Ariz. 1995) (recognizing that limiting costs is a compelling interest, but holding that the \n9  additional expense of providing Kosher meals to inmates was not a compelling interest because it was \n10  โminimalโ); see also Agrawal v. Briley, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16997 *8 (N.D. Ill. 2004) (โIt is undeniable \n11  that,  in  the  abstract,  safety,  security,  internal  order  and  discipline,  and  the  management  and \n12  conservation of resources are โcompelling interests.โ It does not follow, however, that anything that \n13  furthers one or more of these interests, however marginally, is equally โcompelling.โ โฆ. [T]he possibility \n14  that Plaintiffโs preferred diet cost a small amount more per year could not be considered compelling.\"). \n15  It is difficult to see how Defendants have established a compelling state interest not to incur \n16  costs associated with providing Ramadan meals to a few additional Muslim inmates who, according to \n17  their sincerely-held beliefs, have a religious obligation to fast during Ramadan. And other states are \n18  able to offer Ramadan meals that do not mimic the one at issue in this case.  Alaskaโs Ramadan Policy, \n19  for example, provides hot meals totaling 2400-3000 calories a day with no hoops or signups required.1  \n20  It is also why Plaintiff James has had no issue receiving Ramadan meals at all prior facilities.   \n21  In order for Defendantsโ administrative concerns to have an impact on this Courtโs analysis, \n22  the Department must still establish that avoiding additional administrative burden amounts to a \n23  compelling interest. Bilal, 2006 Dist. LEXIS 93152 at *34. In the 9th Circuit, when looking at whether \n24  budgetary and administrative concerns of the prison can justify a burden on free exercise, courts must \n25  look to whether there are reasonable alternatives to the current policy. The existence of alternatives is \n26  evidence that a prison policy is not reasonable and cannot be justified by reference to administrative \n27 \n                                           \n28 \n1 http://www.correct.state.ak.us/pnp/pdf/805.03.pdf at 8.  \n    - 14 -   \nPLAINTIFFSโ MEMORANDUM ISO SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00837-RSM   Document 79-1   Filed 07/09/19   Page 18 of 24\n \n1  concerns.

That few other prisons appear to have \n3  the same issue that Defendants have is strong evidence that the administrative burdens here are \n4  imagined. And of course, many alternatives exist to minimalize any administrative burden. \n5  Meanwhile, Defendants have not provided evidence to demonstrate that the burden on their \n6  efficiency is compelling other than conclusory statements. F.T.C. v. Publishing Clearing House, Inc., 104 \n7  F.3d 1168, 1171 (9th Cir. 1997) (such statements insufficient to avoid summary judgment). \n8  Likewise, Defendants have not shown that the outright denial of Ramadan meals to a number \n9  of inmates is the least restrictive means of achieving that goal. โThe least-restrictive-means standard is \n10  exceptionally demanding.โ Holt v. Hobbs, 135 S.Ct. 853, 864 (2015). It โrequires the government to \n11  show that it lacks other means of achieving its desired goal without imposing a substantial burden.โ Id. \n12  โIf a less restrictive means is available for the Government to achieve its goals, the Government must \n13  use it.โ Id. \n14  The same alternatives that show a lack of compelling interest also show the lack of least \n15  restrictive means.

See also, Estelle, supra, 429 U.S., at 102 (proscribing \n28  torture  and  barbarous  punishment  was  โthe  primary  concern  of  the  draftersโ  of  the  Eighth \n    - 16 -   \nPLAINTIFFSโ MEMORANDUM ISO SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00837-RSM   Document 79-1   Filed 07/09/19   Page 20 of 24\n \n1  Amendment); Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U.S. 130, 136 (1879) (โ[I]t is safe to affirm that punishments of \n2  torture ... and all others in the same line of unnecessary cruelty, are forbidden by [the Eighth \n3  Amendment]โ).  When the cumulative impact of the conditions of incarceration threatens the physical, \n4  mental, and emotional health and well-being of the inmates and/or creates a probability of recidivism \n5  and future incarceration, the court must conclude that the conditions violate the Constitution.โ Rhodes \n6  v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 364 (1981).  \n7  Under the Eighth Amendment, โ[p]rison officials have a duty to ensure that prisoners are \n8  provided adequate shelter, food, clothing, sanitation, medical care, and personal safety. Johnson v. Lewis, \n9  217 F.3d 726, 731 (9th Cir. 2000). See Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832 (1994); Keenan v. Hall, 83 \n10  F.3d 1083, 1089 (9th Cir. 1996); Hoptowit v. Ray, 682 F.2d 1237, 1246 (9th Cir. 1982). โWhile prison \n11  food need not be โtasty or aesthetically pleasing,โ it must be โadequate to maintain health.โ Keenan v. \n12  Hall, 83 F.3d 1083, 1091 (9th Cir. 1996), quoting LeMaire v. Maass, 12 F.3d 1444, 1456 (9th Cir. 1993).  \n13  An Eighth Amendment violation will be found when (1) the alleged deprivation must be \n14  objectively sufficiently serious, and (2) the prison official acted with deliberate indifference to inmateโs \n15  serious needs.  Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834 (1994); Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337 (1981).  \n16  Those violations that deny basic necessities are sufficiently grave to form the basis for an Eighth \n17  Amendment claim.  Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294 (1991). Deliberate indifference is found when the \n18  government is โaware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious \n19  harm exists,โ and, as a result, draws such an inference. Id. at 837. But even a prison official who was \n20  unaware of the risk of substantial risk of harm violates the Eighth Amendment if the risk was obvious \n21  so that a reasonable person should have inferred a substantial risk of serious harm.  Id. \n22  The deliberate indifference of Defendants is pronounced.  All four plaintiffs put in writing \n23  repeatedly that they were going without food.  Mohamed Mohamed explained his predicament: โI canโt \n24  go to the regular mainline because I canโt bring the food back andโฆI canโt eat after sundown.โ  Ex. 7.  \n25  Demario Roberts stated in plain English to Defendants that he โwas not getting fed through DOC.โ  \n26  Ex. 8.  Defendants knew that Plaintiffs were not getting food between sunset and dawn, the only time \n27  during which they could eat as Muslims observing Ramadanโs fast.  Indeed, rather than provide \n28  Plaintiffs with food, a guard noticing Naim Laoโs ragged appearance threatened to force feed him if he \n    - 17 -   \nPLAINTIFFSโ MEMORANDUM ISO SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00837-RSM   Document 79-1   Filed 07/09/19   Page 21 of 24\n \n1  continues to fast in accordance with his faith.  Lao Dep., Ex. 9 at 4.   \n2  Depriving adequate nutrition and caloric intake to inmates constitutes an actionable Eighth \n3  Amendment violation. The Eighth Amendment imposes a duty on officials to provide โhumane \n4  conditions of confinement,โ including ensuring, among other things, that prisoners receive adequate \n5  clothing, food and medical care. Johnson, 217 F.3d at 731 (quoting Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. at 832).  \n6  A deprivation that denies prisoners the โminimal civilized measure of lifeโs necessitiesโ can form the \n7  basis of an Eight Amendment Claim. Id. (quoting Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 347 (1981)); see also \n8  Keenan, 83 F.3d at 1089. Further, โthe more basic the need, the shorter the time it can be withheld.โ \n9  Hoptowit, 682 F.2d at 1259; see also Anderson v. County of Kern, 45 F.3d 1310, 1314, as amended, 75 F.3d 448 \n10  (9th Cir. 1995).     \n11  That requires providing [food]โฆOther courts have also held that inadequate food is actionable \n12  under the Eighth Amendment. See, e.g., Cunningham v. Jones, 567 F.2d 653, 656 (6th Cir. 1977); Berry v. \n13  Brady, 192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir. 1999); Thompson v. Gibson, 289 F.3d 1218, 1222 (10th Cir. 2002) (โA \n14  substantial deprivation of food may be sufficiently serious to state a conditions of confinement claim \n15  under the Eighth Amendment.โ); Landman v. Royster, 333 F. Supp. 621 (E.D. Va. 1971).  \n16  III.  Defendants Violate the Equal Protection Clause and Free Exercise Clause \n17  Defendants violate the Equal Protection Clause if Plaintiffs can show a difference in treatment \n18  between Muslims and other protected groups, unless the difference โis reasonably related to legitimate \n19  penological interests.โ Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89 (1987); see Shakur v. Schriro, 514 F.3d 878, 891 \n20  (9th Cir. 2008).  Under the four part Turner test, reasonableness looks to (1) the logicalness of the \n21  connection between the regulation and the goal, (2) the alternate means of exercising the right in \n22  question that currently exist, (3) the impact of accommodation on others, and (4) the absence of ready \n23  alternatives. Turner, 482 U.S. at 89-91. \n24  Here, Ramadan and Passover are treated differently.  The evidence shows that Plaintiffs and \n25  other Muslims were scrutinized heavily before being permitted to obtain Ramadan meals.  But for \n26  Passover, a different story emerges.  โA few years ago, the Department experienced 1,800 individuals \n27  who signed up for Passover.โ  Simpson Dep., Ex. 29, 59:14-15. But instead of scrutinizing and rejecting \n28  those individuals because they did not sign up ahead of time or pass any religious tests, the Department \n    - 18 -   \nPLAINTIFFSโ MEMORANDUM ISO SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00837-RSM   Document 79-1   Filed 07/09/19   Page 22 of 24\n \n1  of Corrections simply provided the 1,800 all-of-a-sudden Jewish inmates Passover meals.  Simpson \n2  Dep., Ex. 29, 59:14-15; 60:13-62:14. This created โa third of a million dollars divotโ into the \n3  Department of Correctionsโ budget.  Simpson Dep., Ex. 29, 59:15-16. And yet, despite that, the meals \n4  were provided, no questions asked.  Simpson Dep., Ex. 29, 59:15-16; 60:13-62:14. \n5  This unequal treatment violates the Equal Protection Clause.  Discrimination and differential \n6  treatment on the basis of religion also violates the Free Exercise Clause.  See, e.g., Bd. of Educ. of Kiryas \n7  Joel Vill. Sch. Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U.S. 687, 715 (1994) (OโConnor, J., concurring); see also Awad v. Ziriax, \n8  670 F.3d 1111, 1128 (10th Cir. 2012).  Such discrimination cannot be justified under any of the Turner \n9  factors.  In fact, the Departmentโs Passover meals are more expensive than the Halal meals.  Simpson \n10  Dep., Ex. 42:25-43:20; see also Bilal, 2006 WL 3626808, at *7. \n11  IV.  Defendants Are Not Entitled to Qualified Immunity \n12  Plaintiffs seek damages against individual-capacity Defendants for violations of Plaintiffs \n13  constitutional rights. 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 provides a cause of action against persons acting under the color \n14  of state law who have violated rights guaranteed by the Constitution. Buckley v. City of Redding, 66 F.3d \n15  188, 190 (9th Cir. 1995). Here, though the Defendants are likely to assert qualified immunity as a \n16  defense against these damages claims, the clarity of the constitutional violation precludes its application \n17  to this case.   \n18  There  can  be  no  qualified  immunity  when  a  constitutional  right  at  issue  was  โclearly \n19  establishedโ at the time of the alleged violation. Dela Cruz v. Kauai County, 279 F.3d 1064, 1069 (9th \n20  Cir. 2002).  And there are few rights more clearly established than the right of an inmate to adequate \n21  nutrition.  โThere is no question that an inmateโs Eighth Amendment right to adequate food is clearly \n22  established.โ Foster v. Runnels, 554 F.3d 807, 815 (9th Cir. 2009).  Defendants have always known that, \n23  as the government officials who exercise control over Plaintiffs during their incarceration, it is their \n24  constitutional obligation to provide them โwith food sufficient to sustain them in good health that \n25  satisfies the dietary laws of their religion.โ  McElyea v. Babbitt, 833 F.2d 196, 198 (9th Cir. 1987).  \n26  Defendant Stewart, an architect of the Departmentโs Ramadan practices, acknowledged as much when \n27  she conceded in deposition that, of course, โit would be not right to not provide people food to be \n28  able to sustain themselves.โ  Stewart Dep, 153:11-12.  Though the Supreme Court does \"not require a \n    - 19 -   \nPLAINTIFFSโ MEMORANDUM ISO SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00837-RSM   Document 79-1   Filed 07/09/19   Page 23 of 24\n \n1  case directly on point\" to satisfy the โclearly establishedโ threshold that must be met to defeat qualified \n2  immunity, the Ninth Circuit in McElyea and other cases has spoken plainly on the nonnegotiable \n3  requirement  that  inmates  be  fed  and  otherwise  not  coerced  into  abandoning  their  religious \n4  beliefs.  Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 131 S. Ct. 2074, 2083, 563 U.S. 731, 179 L. Ed. 2d 1149 (2011) \n5  More than twenty years ago, the Ninth Circuit directed a prison to provide a kosher2 diet to a \n6  Jewish inmate โsufficient to sustain [him] in good health without violating the laws of kashruthf.โ \n7  Ashelman v. Wawrzaszek, 111 F.3d 674, 677 (9th Cir. 1997). The case embraced McElyeaโs holding \n8  explicitly, emphasizing that providing food in accordance with the โdietary laws of their religionโ is \n9  what the Ninth Circuit requires.  Id.  Indeed, in Ashelman, the Ninth Circuit approvingly noted that the \n10  Arizona prison at the center of the dispute already โaccommodates the dietary requirements of other \n11  religious groups, including Muslims, Sikhs, and Seventh-Day Adventists.โ  Id, at 678.  Simply put, \n12  Defendants have had decades of notice from the Ninth Circuit that the Constitution requires that they \n13  must accommodate the religious dietary needs of their inmates.   \n14  The Ninth Circuit has also looked to other circuit courts to support its holding that a prisonerโs \n15  right to a religious diet is clearly established law. See Navajo Nation v. United States Forest Serv., 535 F.3d \n16  1058, 1091 (9th Cir. 2008), citing Lovelace v. Lee, 472 F.3d 174, 198-99 (4th Cir. 2006) (โUnder both \n17  the Free Exercise Clause and RLUIPA in its most elemental form, a prisoner has a โclearly established \n18  โฆ right to a diet consistent with his โฆ religious scruples,โ including proper food during Ramadan.โ) \n19  (quoting Ford v. McGinnis, 352 F.3d 582, 597 (2d Cir. 2003)). \n20  Department prison authorities are familiar with Islam and have provided Ramadan meal \n21  services for a number of years. Moreover, the presence of Muslim inmates is sufficient to alert the \n22  authorities to their constitutional and statutory duty to accommodate the religious exercise of those \n23  inmates. The law is clearly established that unthinkingly depriving inmates of food consistent with their \n24  religious beliefs is illegal.  A reasonable official would realize that the actions taken by Defendantsโโ\n25 \n26 \n                                           \n27 \n2 While a kosher diet implicates what food is served, an Islamic diet also regards when food is \nserved.  During Ramadan, for example, an Islamic diet would provide Muslim inmates with food \n28 \nbetween sunset and dawn so that they can eat and observe their daily daytime fast.   \n    - 20 -   \nPLAINTIFFSโ MEMORANDUM ISO SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00837-RSM   Document 79-1   Filed 07/09/19   Page 24 of 24\n \n1 \nforcing Plaintiffs to choose between their sincerely-held religious beliefs and foodโwould thus violate \n2 \nclearly established law.  \n3 \nMoreover, the law is clearly established that withholding food from inmates is a violation of \n4 \nthe Plaintiffsโ rights under the Eighth Amendment. โThere is no question that an inmateโs Eighth \n5 \nAmendment right to adequate food is clearly established.โ Foster v. Runnels, 554 F.3d 807, 815 (9th Cir. \n6 \n2009); see also supra Part II. It is also not a defense that the Ramadan policy is a written regulation. \n7 \nDefendants cannot โseek shelter in the reasonableness of [their] actions on the basis of [a memo or \n8 \nregulation].โ Id. at 816; see Cooper v. Sheriff, 929 F.2d 1078, 1083 (5th Cir. 1991).   \n9 \nCONCLUSION \n10 \nPlaintiffsโ motion for summary judgment as to liability and a permanent injunction should be \n11 \ngranted. \n12 \nRespectfully submitted, \n13   \nDated:  July 10, 2019            CAIR LEGAL DEFENSE FUND \n14   \nBy /s/ Lena F.
