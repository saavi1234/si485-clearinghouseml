    "summary": "<p>On May 22, 2018, two prisoners at the Anchorage Correctional Complex, both practicing Muslims, brought this lawsuit against the Alaska Department of Corrections (DOC), alleging that prison officials failed numerous times to accommodate their religious needs during Ramadan. According to the plaintiffs, during both the 2017 and 2018 Ramadan seasons they received only two bagged meals per day, which were smaller, less in number, and lower in calorie count than the legally required amount. In some instances these meals allegedly included sandwiches containing pork, which they did not eat because of their religious beliefs. They alleged that this โRamadan Policyโ violated the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause, the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, the Eighth Amendmentโs ban on cruel and unusual punishment, and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA). Represented by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), they filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorneys' fees. </p><p>Since Ramadan was still ongoing at the time the complaint was filed, the plaintiffs also moved for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction that would compel prison officials to provide them with nutritionally adequate and pork-free meals through the end of Ramadan on June 15. The case was initially assigned to District Judge John W. Sedwick, but was re-assigned to District Judge H. Russel Holland on May 23, 2018 after Judge Sedwick recused himself (Judge Sedwick did not give a reason in his recusal order). After a hearing, Judge Holland granted the plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order after deciding that they were likely to succeed on their RLUIPA claims. 2018 WL 2392498. The court reserved the issue of a preliminary injunction for later adjudication after the parties briefed the issue. But on May 31, the defendants stipulated that they would comply with the TRO's provisions through the end of the month of Ramadan and any subsequent Ramadan that occurred during the litigation. The plaintiffs withdrew the motion for preliminary injunction as moot. </p><p>The DOC filed its answer to the complaint on June 26, 2018, largely denying the plaintiffs' pertinent factual allegations. In addition, the department also asserted several affirmative defenses: that the DOC official defendants in the suit were protected by qualified immunity, that the plaintiffsโ alleged failure to exhaust administrative remedies made a lawsuit in federal court premature, and that the damages suffered by the plaintiffs were de minimis.</p><p>On July 6, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint to further allege that officials at the prison prohibited Muslims from holding religious services or study groups, while allowing Christian prisoners to do the same. The DOC denied these allegations in its answer filed on July 20, 2018.</p><p>After the parties proceeded through discovery, the court ordered the case ready for trial by the end of August 2019. But on September 3, the parties notified the court that they had reached a settlement. They filed the agreement with the court on September 5, 2019 and the court filed approval the next day. The court dismissed the case with prejudice and retained jurisdiction to enforce the settlement.</p><p>The settlement provided that prisoners fasting during the month of Ramadan would receive meals consisting of 3,000 calories per day, and that they would be two hot meals between sunset and dawn. The defendants agreed to provide pork-free meals with labels indicating as much. And the settlement provided that Muslim prisoners would be permitted to congregate for daily prayers, weekly religious services, and Islamic study groups. The settlement also included that CAIR would provide a four-hour religious sensitivity training to staff statewide. The defendants agreed to pay $102,500 in damages and attorneys' fees. The settlement did not indicate an enforcement period, but that the court would retain jurisdiction to enforce the settlement's terms.</p><p>The case appears closed.</p>",

A hearing on the motion was held on May 24, 2018, at which\ncounsel for plaintiffs and counsel for the Alaska Department of Corrections participated. \nDiscussion\nโ[T]he legal standards applicable to TROs and preliminary injunctions are โsubstan-\ntially identical.โโ  Wash. v. Trump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1159 n.3 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting \nStuhlbarg Intโl Sales Co., Inc. v. John D. Brush & Co., Inc., 240 F.3d 832, 839 n.7 (9th Cir.\n4Id. at 8, ยถ 29.  \n5Id. at ยถ 34.  \n6Id. at ยถยถ 36-37.  \n7Docket No. 2.  Although the motion for a temporary restraining order was filed ex\nparte, the court declined to consider the motion on an ex parte basis.  See Order re Motion\nfor Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order at 1, Docket No. 7.  \n-2-\nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 18   Filed 05/25/18   Page 2 of 7\n\n2001)).  โA party seeking a preliminary injunction must meet one of two variants of the same\nstandard.โ  Alliance for the Wild Rockies v. Pena, 865 F.3d 1211, 1217 (9th Cir. 2017). \nโUnder the original Winter standard, a party must show โthat he is likely to succeed on the\nmerits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that\nthe balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.โโ  Id.\n(quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20  (2008)).  โUnder the โsliding\nscaleโ variant of the Winter standard, โif a plaintiff can only show that there are serious\nquestions  going  to  the  meritsโa  lesser  showing  than  likelihood  of  success  on  the\nmeritsโthen a preliminary injunction may still issue if the balance of hardships tips sharply\nin the plaintiffโs favor,โ and the other two Winter factors are satisfied.โโ  Id. (quoting Shell\nOffshore, Inc. v. Greenpeace, Inc., 709 F.3d 1281, 1291 (9th Cir. 2013)).  A plaintiff need\nnot establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits of all his claims.  A TRO or\npreliminary injunction may issue if a plaintiff can show he is likely to succeed on one claim\nand that he meets the other three requirements for injunctive relief.  League of Wilderness\nDefenders/Blue Mountains Biodiversity Project v. Connaughton, 752 F.3d 755, 766 n.3 (9th\nCir. 2014).  \nThe Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 โโrequires that a prisoner challenging\nprison conditions exhaust available administrative remedies before filing suit.โโ  Jackson v.\nFong, 870 F.3d 928, 933 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting Albino v. Baca, 747 F.3d 1162, 1165 (9th\nCir. 2014)).  Plaintiffs state that they each filed an emergency grievance on May 21, 2018,\n-3-\nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 18   Filed 05/25/18   Page 3 of 7\n\nand that on May 22, 2018, defendants determined that these grievances were not emergen-\ncies.8  Because the Emergency Grievance procedure provides that the decision as to whether\nan  issue  constitutes an  emergency is not administratively appealable,9 plaintiffs have\nexhausted the Emergency Grievance procedure.  The court concludes that, for purposes of\nthe instant motion, plaintiffs have exhausted their available administrative remedies.  \nTurning then to the merits of plaintiffsโ motion for a TRO, plaintiffs only argue that\nthey are likely to succeed on their claim in Count II that defendants have violated The\nReligious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA).  \nSection 3 of RLUIPA provides, in relevant part, that โ[n]o\ngovernment shall impose a substantial burden on the religious\nexercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution . . .\neven if the burden results from a rule of general applicability,โ\nunless the government establishes that the burden furthers โa\ncompelling governmental interest,โ and does so by โthe least\nrestrictive means.โ\nWarsoldier  v.  Woodford,  418  F.3d  989,  994  (9th  Cir.  2005)  (quoting  42  U.S.C.  ยง\n2000ccโ1(a)(1)-(2)).  \nโ[A] burden is substantial under RLUIPA when the state โdenies [an important\nbenefit] because of conduct mandated by religious belief, thereby putting substantial pressure\non an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs.โโ  Shakur v. Schriro, 514\nF.3d 878, 888 (9th Cir. 2008) (quoting Warsoldier, 418 F.3d at 995).  Courts โhave\n8Verified Complaint [etc.] at 15, ยถยถ 75-76, Docket No. 1.  \n9Id. at 15, ยถ 78.  \n-4-\nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 18   Filed 05/25/18   Page 4 of 7\n\nrepeatedly held that forcing an inmate to choose between daily nutrition and religious\npractice is a substantial burden.โ  Thompson v. Holm, 809 F.3d 376, 380 (7th Cir. 2016); see\nalso, McElyea v. Babbitt, 833 F.2d 196, 198 (9th Cir. 1987) (โ[i]nmates . . . have the right\nto be provided with food sufficient to sustain them in good health that satisfies the dietary\nlaws of their religionโ).  Plaintiffs contend that they are being provided with Ramadan meals\nthat contain only 500 to 1100 calories per day, rather than the recommended federal guideline\ncaloric intake of 2600 to 2800 calories per day.  Even if plaintiffs received sufficient food\non some days, there is evidence that they have not received sufficient food every day.10  At\nleast one court has held that having insufficient food on only two days constituted a\nsubstantial burden.  Thompson, 809 F.3d at 380.  The court cannot perceive of any\ncompelling governmental interest that would be furthered by providing plaintiffs with\nRamadan meals that do not contain sufficient nutrition or that contain pork product.  That it\nmay cost slightly more to feed Muslim prisoners during Ramadan is not a compelling\ninterest, given that RLUIPA โโmay require a government to incur expenses in its own\noperations to avoid imposing a substantial burden on religious exercise.โโ  Burwell v. Hobby\nLobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2751, 2781 (2014) (quoting 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000cc-3).  In sum,\nbased on the facts as stated in plaintiffsโ verified complaint, plaintiffs have shown that they\nare likely to succeed on their  RLUIPA claim in Count II.\n10Declaration of Lena F. Masri [etc.] at 2, ยถยถ 2-5, Docket No. 9.  \n-5-\nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 18   Filed 05/25/18   Page 5 of 7\n\nBecause plaintiffs have shown that they are likely to succeed on one of their RLUIPA \nclaims, they have met the other requirements for a TRO.  โ[T]he loss of religious freedom\ncaused by a RLUIPA violationโstanding aloneโis sufficient to show irreparable harm. . . .โ\nHarris v. Wall, 217 F. Supp. 3d 541, 560 (D.R.I. 2016).  Plaintiffs are also being irreparably\nharmed because they may not be receiving adequate nutrition on a daily basis.  As for the\nbalance of equities and public interest, โ[i]t is clear that it would not be equitable or in the\npublicโs interest to allow the state . . . to violate the requirements of federal law[.]โโ  Ariz.\nDream Act Coalition v. Brewer, 757 F.3d 1053, 1069 (9th Cir. 2014) (quoting Valle del Sol\nInc. v. Whiting, 732 F.3d 1006, 1029 (9th Cir. 2013)).\nโAlthough Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c) generally provides that aโ temporary\nrestraining order โwill not issue except upon the giving of security, it is not required where\nplaintiffs are indigent or where considerations of public policy make waiver of a bond\nappropriate.โ  Miller v. Carlson, 768 F. Supp. 1331, 1340 (N.D. Cal. 1991).  Because\nplaintiffs are currently incarcerated, the court will waive the bond requirement.   \nBased on the foregoing, plaintiffsโ motion for a temporary restraining order is granted. \nEffectively immediately, defendants are enjoined from\n1) providing plaintiffs, and other fasting Muslim inmates, Ramadan meals that\ncontain less than 2600 calories per day; defendants shall provide plaintiffs, and\nother fasting Muslim inmates, with daily Ramadan meals that contain at least\n2600 calories; \n-6-\nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 18   Filed 05/25/18   Page 6 of 7\n\n2) providing plaintiffs, and other fasting Muslim inmates, Ramadan meals that\ncontain pork products; and \n3) removing either or both of plaintiffs from the Ramadan Meal List for any\nreason.  If either or both of plaintiffs are not currently on the Ramadan Meal\nList, defendants shall put them back on the list immediately.   \nThis temporary restraining order shall remain in effect until the court rules on\nplaintiffsโ motion for a preliminary injunction.  \nDefendantsโ response to plaintiffsโ motion for a preliminary injunction shall be filed\nby 4 p.m. Alaska Daylight Time, on May 31, 2018.  Plaintiffsโ reply shall be filed no later\nthan June 4, 2018.  In further briefing plaintiffsโ motion for a preliminary injunction, counsel\nare again directed to consider D. Ak.

Anchorage Correctional Complex is an โinstitutionโ within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. ยง \n2000cc-1(a) and 42 U.S.C. ยง 1997. \n23.  Defendants  have  not  identified  any  compelling  government  interest  for  denying \nPlaintiffsโ requests for a religious diet that satisfies nutritional and caloric requirements during the \nmonth of Ramadan.1 \n24.  Nor  have  Defendants  identified  any  compelling  government  interest  for  denying \nPlaintiff Dowlโs requests, and Muslim inmates similarly situated, to participate in Friday religious \nservices2 or conduct Muslim study groups.  \n25.  Defendants have failed to enforce the applicable laws, policies, directives and regulations \nin the least restrictive means possible. \n26.  Defendants have unlawfully imposed a separate religious services policy for Muslims \nthat substantially burdens the rights of Plaintiff Dowl, and Muslim inmates similarly situated, to the \nfree exercise of religion by means that are not the least restrictive means available to the correctional \nfacility to protect their asserted governmental interest.  \n27.  Defendants have allowed inmates who are not Muslim to practice their faith in a manner \nsimilar to the manner in which Plaintiff Dowl, and Muslim inmates similarly situated, desire to practice \ntheir faith.  \n28.  Defendants have unlawfully imposed a Muslim-specific and Ramadan-specific dietary \npolicy that substantially burdens the rights of Plaintiffs to be free from cruel and unusual punishment \n                                                             \n1 Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic Calendar, which is based on a lunar calendar.  \nMuslims worldwide observe Ramadan as a month of fasting.  This annual observance is regarded as \none of the Five Pillars of Islam.  Among other things, while fasting from dawn until sunset, Muslims \nrefrain from consuming food, drinking liquids, smoking and sexual relations.  In 2018, Ramadan \ncommenced on May 16, 2018 and will end on approximately June 15, 2018. \n2 Muslims are required to conduct and participate in religious services every Friday, usually \nafter noon, which consists of a religious sermon followed by a congregational prayer.   \n7 \nDowl, et al., v. Williams, et al.  \nCase No. 3:18-cv-00119-HRH    \nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 35   Filed 07/06/18   Page 7 of 35\n\nand to the free exercise of religion by means that are not the least restrictive means available to the \ncorrectional facilities to protect their asserted governmental interest.   \n29.  Defendants have imposed regulations that unreasonably subject Plaintiffs to cruel and \nunusual punishment and that limit religious exercise, discriminate against Plaintiffs on the basis of \nreligious denomination, and treat Plaintiffs on less than equal terms with other religious and non-\nreligious similarly-situated persons. \n30.  Plaintiff Dowl has a sincerely-held religious belief that he, and other Muslim inmates \nsimilarly situated, is required, in accordance with his Muslim faith, to conduct and participate in Friday \nreligious services every Friday and to perform the five obligatory daily prayers as a congregation.   \nDenial of a Proper Nutritional and Caloric Intake During the Month of Ramadan \n(โRamadan Policyโ) \n31.  Under State of Alaska Department of Corrections Policy and Procedure Directive \n805.01 โFood Service Standards,โ Section VI.A., all menus and meals at correctional facilities, which \ninclude Anchorage Correctional Complex, are required to be โnutritious, well-balanced and heart-\nhealthy.โ \n32.  Further, under State of Alaska Department of Corrections Policy and Procedure \nDirective 805.01 โFood Service Standards,โ Section VII.B.1., the food menu is required to โmeet all \nrecommended daily dietary allowances, with adjustments for age, sex, and activity.โ \n33.  Pursuant to the โDietary Guidelines for Americans 2015-2020โ issued by the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Plaintiffsโ \nestimated calorie needs in accordance with their age, sex and physical activity level ranges from 2,600 \nto 2,800 calories per day.3 \n                                                             \n3 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2015-\n2020  Dietary  Guidelines  for  Americans,  8th  Edition,  December  2015.    Available  at:  \nhttps://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/resources/2015-2020_Dietary_Guidelines.pdf. \n8 \nDowl, et al., v. Williams, et al.  \nCase No. 3:18-cv-00119-HRH    \nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 35   Filed 07/06/18   Page 8 of 35\n\n34.  Additionally, under State of Alaska Department of Corrections Policy and Procedure \nDirective 805.01 โFood Service Standards,โ Section VII.A.1., prisoners shall receive three meals a day, \nat least two of which are hot meals. \n35.  Under State of Alaska Department of Corrections Policy and Procedure Directive \n805.03 โSpecial and/or Religious Meals,โ Section E.1., each Superintendent is required to develop \nstandard  operating  procedures  (โSOPsโ)  in  coordination  with  the  DOC  Statewide  Chaplaincy \nCoordinator to allow for the temporary accommodation of multi-day religious fasting and dietary \nprohibitions, including fasting during Ramadan.   \n36.  Upon information and belief, the Ramadan Policy and the Ramadan Bagged Meal \nMenu implemented at Anchorage Correctional Complex during the confinement of Plaintiffs was \ncoordinated with Defendant Silliman as Chaplain for Anchorage Correctional Complex. \n37.  Upon information and belief, during Ramadan, Defendants do not provide Muslim \ninmates who participate in the Ramadan fast at Anchorage Correctional Complex, including Plaintiffs, \na balanced nutritional and caloric diet on any given day during Ramadan.  (This policy will hereinafter \nbe referred to as the โRamadan Policy.โ) \n38.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Defendants  provide  other  inmates  at  Anchorage \nCorrectional Complex and throughout Alaska Department of Corrections facilities between 2,600 and \n2,800 calories and a balanced nutritional diet on any given day. \n39.  Upon information and belief, pursuant to the Ramadan Policy, Defendants provide \nMuslim inmates participating in the Ramadan fast, including Plaintiffs, with two bagged meals every \nevening that contain cold meals that range from approximately 500 to approximately 1,100 calories \nper day, depending on the day, which is substantially lower than what is required under Policy and \nProcedure Directive 805.01 โFood Service Standards,โ and the โDietary Guidelines for Americans \n2015-2020.โ \n9 \nDowl, et al., v. Williams, et al.  \nCase No. 3:18-cv-00119-HRH    \nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 35   Filed 07/06/18   Page 9 of 35\n\n40.  Additionally, pursuant to the Ramadan Bagged Meal Menu, during several days, \nDefendants provide Muslim inmates participating in the Ramadan fast, including Plaintiffs, with \nbologna sandwiches which upon information and belief contain pork product that, in accordance with \ntheir sincerely-held religious beliefs, Plaintiffs and other Muslim inmates are not permitted to eat. \n41.  As a result, on the days that Plaintiffs and other Muslim inmates participating in the \nRamadan fast receive bologna sandwiches, in accordance with their sincerely-held religious beliefs, \nthey forego eating the sandwiches and as a result receive even less calories than the already substantially \nlow amount they are given. \n42.  Upon information and belief, pursuant to the Ramadan Policy, Defendants do not \npermit Muslim inmates participating in the Ramadan fast to receive hot meals, nor do they permit \nthem to eat any food from the regular meal line that other inmates eat at. \n43.  Upon information and belief, pursuant to the Ramadan Policy, Defendants do not \npermit Muslim inmates participating in the Ramadan fast to keep any food in their cells or eat any \nfood other than the food that is contained in the two bagged meals provided to them by Defendants. \n44.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs other Muslim inmates at that facility, are completely dependent \nupon the Defendants to provide them with food. \n45.  The nutritional and caloric intake of the Ramadan Bagged Meal Menu given to \nPlaintiffs and other Muslim inmates participating in the Ramadan fast by Defendants is approximately \nless than half the number of calories that other inmates receive on any given day. \n46.  Plaintiffs observe the Ramadan fast, in accordance with their sincerely-held religious \nbelief that fasting the month of Ramadan is a religious obligation which is compulsory on all healthy \nadult Muslims. \n47.  During the month of Ramadan, Muslims fast from sunrise to sundown by, among \nother things, abstaining from eating and drinking.  Muslims believe Ramadan is a time for spiritual \n10 \nDowl, et al., v. Williams, et al.  \nCase No. 3:18-cv-00119-HRH    \nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 35   Filed 07/06/18   Page 10 of 35\n\nreflection, self-improvement, and increased devotion and worship. \n48.  During the month of Ramadan, Muslims are permitted to eat and drink from sundown \nto sunrise. \n49.  In order to ensure that Plaintiffs receive their meals before sunrise and after sundown, \nas opposed to regular meal times, Plaintiffs, along with other Muslim inmates, submitted a written \napplication to eat from the Ramadan menu.   \n50.  Each of Plaintiffsโ requests to eat from the Religious Ramadan menu were approved. \n51.  However, by requesting to eat from the Ramadan menu, Plaintiffs, along with other \nMuslim inmates, are forced to sacrifice a proper nutritional and caloric diet in order to adhere to their \nsincerely-held religious beliefs. \n52.  Upon information and belief, other inmates on religious diets, menus or meal plans \nare not forced to consume such a significantly reduced number of calories or sacrifice a proper \nnutritional diet. \n53.  Defendants, via the Ramadan Policy, have subjected and continue to subject Plaintiffs \nand other Muslim inmates with a religious basis for participating in the Ramadan fast to cruel and \nunusual punishment, distinctive and disparate treatment, and less than equal terms than inmates of \nother faith backgrounds by denying them a proper nutritional and caloric diet on a daily basis. \n54.  Defendants, via the Ramadan Policy, have subjected and continue to subject have \nimposed and continue to impose a substantial burden upon the rights of Plaintiffs and other Muslim \ninmates to the free exercise of religion, and discriminate and continue to discriminate against Plaintiffs \non the basis of religion or religious denomination in violation of, among other laws, RLUIPA. 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 2000cc(b)(2). \n55.  Defendants are capable of providing Plaintiffs and other Muslim inmates with a proper \ncaloric and nutritional diet because it provides other inmates at its facilities with a proper caloric and \n11 \nDowl, et al., v. Williams, et al.  \nCase No. 3:18-cv-00119-HRH    \nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 35   Filed 07/06/18   Page 11 of 35\n\nnutritional diet. \n56.  The substantial burden that the Defendants, via the Ramadan Policy, impose on \nPlaintiffs and other Muslim inmates participating in the Ramadan fast is not necessary, or the least \nrestrictive means, to achieve any compelling state interest.   \nThe Impact of the Ramadan Policy on Plaintiffs Anas A. Dowl and Ernest Jacobsson \n57.  As discussed above, upon information and belief, the meals provided to Plaintiff Dowl \nduring the month of Ramadan in the years 2017 and 2018 and Plaintiff Jacobsson in the year 2018 did \nnot and do not meet the minimum requirements that all inmates receive a balanced nutritional diet \ncontaining between 2,600 and 2,800 calories on any given day during Ramadan. \n58.  In fact, the meals provided to Plaintiffs Dowl and Jacobsson are less than half the \nestimated number of calories that they need per day, based on their age, sex and activity level, in \naccordance with the โDietary Guidelines for Americans 2015-2020,โ which ranges from 2,600 to 2,800 \ncalories per day.4 \n59.  Moreover, the meals Plaintiffs Dowl and Jacobsson receive are โcold meals,โ whereas \nother inmates at the same facility are receiving โhot meals.โ \n60.  In  addition  to  receiving  meals  that  are below  caloric  and nutritional  standards, \noftentimes during the month of Ramadan, Plaintiffs Dowl and Jacobssonโs bagged meals contain pork \nproduct, which in accordance with their sincerely-held religious beliefs, they are not permitted to eat. \n61.  As such, on the days where their bagged meals contain pork product, they cannot and \ndo not consume the pork product; and as a result, they eat even less than the already substantially low \nnumber of calories that they are given. \n62.  Plaintiff Dowl filed several Requests for Interview Form (โROIโ) (Form 808.11A) in \n                                                             \n4 Id. at 78. \n12 \nDowl, et al., v. Williams, et al.  \nCase No. 3:18-cv-00119-HRH    \nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 35   Filed 07/06/18   Page 12 of 35\n\naccordance with State of Alaska Department of Corrections Policy and Procedure Directive 808.03 \nโPrisoner Grievances,โ Section VII.A., in an attempt to informally resolve his grievances regarding \nthe inadequate nutrition and calories that he is receiving pursuant to the Ramadan Policy, the pork \nproducts that he is being provided by Defendants that he cannot consume in accordance with his \nsincerely-held religious beliefs, and the lack of hot meals during both Ramadan 2017 and Ramadan \n2018. \n63.  Similarly, and for the same reasons, Plaintiff Jacobsson filed several ROIs regarding \nthe inadequate nutrition and calories that he is receiving pursuant to the Ramadan Policy, the pork \nproducts that he is being provided by Defendants that he cannot consume in accordance with his \nsincerely-held religious beliefs, and the lack of hot meals during Ramadan 2018. \n64.  The grievances in the ROIs were either ignored, denied or left unanswered. \n65.  Also in accordance with State of Alaska Department of Corrections Policy and \nProcedure Directive 808.03 โPrisoner Grievances,โ Section VII.B.2., in an attempt to informally \nresolve their grievances regarding the inadequate nutrition and calories that Defendants are providing \nthem pursuant to the Ramadan Policy directly, the pork products that Defendants are providing them \nthat they cannot consume in accordance with their sincerely-held religious beliefs, and the hot meals \nthat the Defendants are prohibiting them to eat during Ramadan 2018 (Plaintiff Dowl filed similar \nROIs regarding Ramadan 2017), they spoke with Defendant Silliman, Defendant Mata, Defendant \nLuper, Defendant Helms and other staff members aware of or directly involved in their grievances. \n66.  On May 19, 2018, Plaintiff Dowl had a prescheduled call with his undersigned counsel. \n67.  At the time of the prescheduled call, Plaintiff Dowlโs undersigned counsel spoke with \nDefendant Luper and requested to be connected to Plaintiff Dowl. \n68.  Minutes after Plaintiff Dowlโs phone call with his undersigned counsel, Defendant \nLuper conducted a โshake downโ of Plaintiff Dowl and Plaintiff Jacobssonโs cell, and confiscated all \n13 \nDowl, et al., v. Williams, et al.  \nCase No. 3:18-cv-00119-HRH    \nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 35   Filed 07/06/18   Page 13 of 35\n\nfood items that they had saved in their cells to eat that day, including the two bagged meals provided \nto them the evening before and four hamburgers that they traded with other inmates in exchange for \nthe bologna sandwiches that they could not eat in accordance with their sincerely-held beliefs. \n69.  In response to Plaintiffsโ inquiries as to why Defendant Luper confiscated their food \nthat they had either received from the facility to eat or saved as they were not aware of any policy that \nhas been posted that prohibits them from doing so, she responded that Defendant Williams issued a \npolicy directive by email that prohibited Muslim inmates participating in the Ramadan fast from saving \nfood in their cells. \n70.  In  another  attempt  to  informally  resolve  their  grievances,  Plaintiffs  Dowl  and \nJacobsson explained to Defendant Luper that they were starving and needed food to eat, and that she \ntook the only food they had to eat. \n71.  Defendant Luper responded by advising Plaintiffs that she was confiscating their food \nas a punishment for saving food in their cells. \n72.  Defendant Luper further informed Plaintiffs that she was going to remove both \nPlaintiff Dowl and Plaintiff Jacobsson from the Ramadan list as an added disciplinary measure for \nsaving food in their cells. \n73.  That day, neither Plaintiff Dowl nor Plaintiff Jacobsson were given any bagged meals \nto eat; and accordingly, they ate nothing that day. \n74.  In accordance with their sincerely-held religious beliefs, they continued fasting the next \nday without having had anything to eat the day before. \n75.  In accordance with State of Alaska Department of Corrections Policy and Procedure \nDirective 808.03 โPrisoner Grievances,โ Section VII.A.1.c., Plaintiff Dowl immediately submitted an \nROI and afterwards two Prisoner Grievance Forms (Form 808.03C) regarding the lack of adequate \nmeals and the pork products that he is being fed by Defendants, and Defendant Luper removing him \n14 \nDowl, et al., v. Williams, et al.  \nCase No. 3:18-cv-00119-HRH    \nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 35   Filed 07/06/18   Page 14 of 35\n\nfrom the Ramadan list and confiscating the only food he had to eat. \n76.  Similarly and for the same reasons, Plaintiff Jacobsson also immediately submitted two \nROIs and afterwards a Prisoner Grievance Form regarding the lack of adequate meals and the pork \nproducts that he is being fed by Defendants, and Defendant Luper removing him from the Ramadan \nlist and confiscating the only food he had to eat. \n77.  As of the date of this filing, Plaintiffs have not received any response to the grievances \nfiled by Plaintiffs. \n78.  On May 21, 2018, both Plaintiffs Dowl and Jacobsson were told by a correctional \nofficer that Defendant Luper advised that they cannot get food from the main meal line to supplement \nthe inadequate bagged meals Defendants are providing to Plaintiffs. \n79.  On May 21, 2018, in accordance with State of Alaska Department of Corrections \nPolicy and Procedure Directive 808.03 โPrisoner Grievances,โ Section VI.B.1., both Plaintiffs Dowl \nand Jacobsson requested emergency grievances regarding the lack of adequate meals and the pork \nproducts being fed to them by Defendants.  Defendants provided Plaintiffs with standard grievance \nforms instead, and Plaintiff Dowl wrote โemergencyโ across the top. \n80.  On May 22, 2018, both of Plaintiffsโ emergency grievances were denied processing as \nan emergency, and upon information and belief, are being processed in accordance with standard \ngrievance procedure timelines. \n81.  Because Ramadan commenced on May 16, 2018 and will end on approximately June \n16, 2018; it is unlikely that Plaintiffsโ grievances will be resolved before Ramadan concludes. \n82.  In accordance with State of Alaska Department of Corrections Policy and Procedure \nDirective  808.03  โPrisoner  Grievances,โ  Section  VII.D.1.C.,  prisoners  โcannot  appeal  the \nDepartmentโs determination as to whether the issue grieved is an emergency.โ \n83.  In the meantime, Plaintiffs are suffering irreparable harm to their health, including \n15 \nDowl, et al., v. Williams, et al.  \nCase No. 3:18-cv-00119-HRH    \nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 35   Filed 07/06/18   Page 15 of 35\n\nmalnutrition, starvation, weight loss, hunger pangs, headaches, dizziness, among other things. \n84.  Both Plaintiffs have exhausted their administrative remedies related to emergency \ngrievances. \nDenial of Muslims from Participating in Friday Religious Services and Muslim Study \nGroups (โMuslim Religious Services Policyโ) \n85.  Section 816.01 of the Department of Corrections Policies and Procedures provides \nthat โ[i]t is the policy of the Department [of Corrections] to allow prisoners to participate in faith-\nbased programs and practices consistent with facility security and available resourcesโ (โDOC \nReligious Services Policyโ).  DOC Religious Services Policy further provides in pertinent part:  \nPrisoner  participation  in  organized  faith  group  activities  where  there  is \nsupervision of an Institutional Chaplain, Lay Leader or Clergy Volunteer shall \nnot be limited except by documented threat to the secure or orderly operation \nof the institution.  \n86.  Upon information and belief, Defendants have not permitted Muslims to perform \nFriday religious services or conduct Muslim study groups, in violation of their own written policy.  \n(The DOC policy as applied to Muslim inmates and Plaintiff Dowl will hereinafter be referred to as \nthe โMuslim Religious Services Policy.โ).  \n87.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Defendants  permit  Christian  inmates  to  perform \nreligious services every day.   \n88.  Upon information and belief, Defendants permit Christian inmates to have bible study \non Fridays and Sundays.  Christian religious groups that are permitted bible study religious services by \nDefendants include but are not limited to โAnch Bible Study;โ โCatholic Bible-Study;โ Seventh-day \nAdventistsโ; โAnch. City Church Bib St;โ โRock of Ages;โ โChurch of Nations;โ and Lighthouse \nChristian Fell.โ  \n89.  Upon information and belief, nonreligious groups are also permitted to congregate \nand regularly meet in groups.   \n16 \nDowl, et al., v. Williams, et al.  \nCase No. 3:18-cv-00119-HRH    \nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 35   Filed 07/06/18   Page 16 of 35\n\n90.  In order to ensure they are meeting their religious obligations, Muslim inmates, \nincluding Plaintiff Dowl, have requested to perform Friday religious services and Muslim study groups \nin accordance with DOC Religious Services Policy.   \n91.  However, Defendants have refused to allowed Plaintiff Dowl and other Muslim \ninmates to congregate for Friday religious services and conduct Muslim study groups.   \n92.  On June 30, 2017, Plaintiff Dowl submitted an ROI requesting Friday religious \nservices for him and other similarly situated Muslim inmates.   \n93.  On July 5, 2017, Defendant Silliman replied, โwe a looking for a approved leader who \nwill come in when schedule will allow.โ  \n94.  Plaintiff Dowl subsequently submitted a grievance requesting Friday religious services \nbut his grievance has not been returned or responded to.   \n95.  On  April  21,  2018,  Plaintiff  Dowl  submitted  another  ROI  requesting  Friday \ncongregational religious services.  On April 24, 2018, Defendant Chaplain Silliman once again denied \nPlaintiff Dowlโs request and replied that โwe are looking for an approved outside leader.โ  \n96.  On May 1, 2018, Plaintiff Dowl submitted two ROIs requesting Friday congregational \nreligious services and received the same denial and response from Defendant Silliman on May 2, 2018.   \n97.  On May 1, 2018, Plaintiff Dowl also submitted an ROI requesting a Muslim study \ngroup similar to the Christian bible study groups permitted by Defendants.  \n98.  Once again, Defendant Silliman denied the request and instructed Plaintiff Dowl that \nโas soon as we can get a approved leader โ it will take place.โ  \n99.  Plaintiff Dowl submitted grievances in response to Defendant Sillimanโs denials to his \nROIs.  Plaintiff Dowl has not received a response to these grievances. \n100.  By failing to respond to Plaintiff Dowlโs grievances, Plaintiff Dowlโs grievances are \nconsidered denied; and, therefore he has exhausted his administrative remedies. \n17 \nDowl, et al., v. Williams, et al.  \nCase No. 3:18-cv-00119-HRH    \nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 35   Filed 07/06/18   Page 17 of 35\n\n101.  By denying Plaintiff Dowlโs requests, Defendants have unlawfully forced Plaintiffs, \nand other similarly situated Muslim inmates, to sacrifice their obligations in accordance with their \nsincerely-held beliefs.  \n102.  The Muslim Religious Services Policy imposes a substantial burden upon the rights of \nPlaintiffs,  and  other  Muslim  inmates  similarly  situated,  to  the  free  exercise  of  religion,  and \ndiscriminates, and continues to discriminate, against Plaintiffs, and other similarly situated inmates, on \nthe basis of religion or religious denomination in violation of, among other laws, RLUIPA, 42 U.S.C. \nยง 2000cc(b)(2).  \n103.  Defendants are capable of permitting Plaintiffs, and other similarly situated Muslim \ninmates, to perform Friday religious services and participate in Muslim study groups because they \npermit other inmates at its facilities to perform regular congregational prayers and participate in \nreligious (namely Christian) study groups.   \n104.  The Muslim Religious Services Policy subjects Plaintiffs and other Muslim inmates \nsimilarly situated to disparate treatment by denying them the right to perform Friday religious services \nand Muslim study groups.   \n105.  The substantial burden that the Muslim Religious Services Policy imposes on these \ninmates is not necessary, or the least restrictive means, to achieve any compelling state interest.  \nCount I \nViolation of Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution \n(Cruel and Unusual Punishment) \n106.  Plaintiffs hereby reallege and incorporate by reference the foregoing paragraphs of this \nAmended Complaint as if fully set forth herein. \n107.  Under the Eighth Amendment, prisoners have the right to be from cruel and unusual \npunishment. \n108.  The Eighth Amendment imposes a duty on Defendants to provide humane conditions \n18 \nDowl, et al., v. Williams, et al.  \nCase No. 3:18-cv-00119-HRH    \nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 35   Filed 07/06/18   Page 18 of 35\n\nof confinement, including insuring, among other things, that prisoners receive adequate food.  See \nFarmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825 (1994). \n109.  Upon information and belief, the Ramadan Policy does not provide Plaintiffs or \nMuslim inmates who observe the holy fast during Ramadan, a balanced nutritional diet containing \nbetween 2,600 and 2,800 calories on any given day during Ramadan.   \n110.  Upon information and belief, the daily caloric intake under the Ramadan Policy ranges \nfrom approximately 500 calories to approximately 1,100 calories, on any given day during Ramadan.   \n111.  The nutritional and caloric intake under the Ramadan Policy is approximately less than \nhalf the number of calories that other inmates receive on any given day during Ramadan. \n112.  Defendants, acting under color of state law, took Plaintiffs into physical police \ncustody.  In doing so, they established a special custodial relationship with Plaintiffs, giving rise to \naffirmative duties on their part to secure and ensure that Plaintiffs would be given adequate food and \nto secure for Plaintiffs the constitutionally-protected rights identified above. \n113.  Defendants,  acting  under  color  of  state  law,  violated  Plaintiffsโ  above-stated \nconstitutionally-protected rights by wrongfully denying them adequate food. \n114.  Specifically, Defendants, acting under color of law, owed Plaintiffs the duty to follow, \nimplement, and comply with State of Alaska Department of Corrections Policy and Procedure \nDirective 805.01 โFood Service Standards,โ Section VI.A., and Policy and Procedure Directive 805.01 \nโFood Service Standards,โ Section VII.B.1., which mandate that all menus and meals at correctional \nfacilities  provide  Plaintiffs  โnutritious,  well-balanced  and  heart-healthyโ  meals  that  โmeet  all \nrecommended daily dietary allowances, with adjustments for age, sex, and activity.โ \n115.  Defendants, acting under color of law, violated State of Alaska Department of \nCorrections Policy and Procedure Directive 805.01 โFood Service Standards,โ Section VI.A., and \nPolicy and Procedure Directive 805.01 โFood Service Standards,โ Section VII.B.1. by deliberately \n19 \nDowl, et al., v. Williams, et al.  \nCase No. 3:18-cv-00119-HRH    \nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 35   Filed 07/06/18   Page 19 of 35\n\nfailing to provide Plaintiffs and other Muslim prisoners who observe the holy fast during Ramadan, a \nbalanced nutritional diet containing between 2,600 and 2,800 calories on any given day during \nRamadan. \n116.  Defendantsโ depravation of a balanced nutritional diet containing between 2,600 and \n2,800 calories on any given day during Ramadan is objectively sufficiently serious in that it fails to \nprovide Plaintiffs adequate food (i.e. a humane condition of confinement). \n117.  Despite Plaintiffsโ repeated pleas and requests for a proper nutritional and caloric diet \non any given day during Ramadan, Defendants failed to take adequate measures to ensure that \nPlaintiffs were receiving adequate food. \n118.  Defendants subjectively perceived, or should have subjectively perceived, Plaintiffsโ \ncomplaints, regarding the inadequacy of food.  \n119.  Defendantsโ acts and omissions were sufficiently harmful to evidence a substantial risk \nof serious harm to Plaintiffs and other Muslim inmates observing the Ramadan fast.  \n120.  Defendantsโ acts and omissions were sufficiently harmful to offend evolving standards \nof decency in violation of the Eighth Amendment.   \n121.  Defendantโ acts and omissions in depriving Plaintiffs of a balanced nutritional diet \ncontaining between 2,600 and 2,800 calories on any given day during Ramadan were such that they \ndenied Plaintiffs and other Muslim inmates the minimal civilized measure of lifeโs necessities.   \n122.  Defendantsโ actions while acting under color of state law, in denying Plaintiffs a \nbalanced nutritional diet containing between 2,600 and 2,800 calories on any given day during \nRamadan, amounts to cruel and unusual punishment and excessive force in violation of their \nconstitutionally-protected rights as stated above.  \n123.  Defendantsโ conduct as outlined above, was so grossly incompetent, inadequate, or \nexcessive so as to shock the conscience or to be intolerable to fundamental fairness and violates the \n20 \nDowl, et al., v. Williams, et al.  \nCase No. 3:18-cv-00119-HRH    \nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 35   Filed 07/06/18   Page 20 of 35\n\nEighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.   \n124.  Defendants,  acting  under  the  color  of  state  law,  authorized,  tolerated,  ratified, \npermitted, or acquiesced in the creation of policies, practices, and customs, establishing a de facto \npolicy of depriving Plaintiffs and other Muslim prisoners observing the holy fast during Ramadan with \na balanced nutritional diet containing between 2,600 and 2,800 calories on any given day during \nRamadan. \n125.  Defendantsโ policies, customs and practices were carried out willfully and with wanton \ndisregard and with the spirit of gross negligence, were the direct and deliberate cause of constitutional \ndeprivations including Plaintiffsโ rights to liberty and due process, and were the direct cause of \nPlaintiffsโ cruel and unusual punishment and excessive force. \n126.  As a direct and proximate result of these polices, practices and customs, Plaintiffs were \ndeprived of their constitutionally-protected rights as described above, by Defendants. \n127.  As a direct and proximate result of these polices, practices and customs, Plaintiffs were \nand are forced to choose on a daily basis during the month of Ramadan whether to adhere to their \nsincerely-held religious beliefs or sacrifice their basic nutritional needs. \n128.  As a direct and proximate result of these polices, practices and customs, Plaintiffs have \nsuffered and will continue to suffer from starvation, weight loss, hunger pangs, severe headaches, \ndizziness, among other things. \n129.  As a result of their conduct described above, Defendants are also liable under 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 1983. \n130.  Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that the Ramadan Policy is a violation of \nPlaintiffsโ Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. \n131.  Ramadan commenced on May 16, 2018 and ended on June 14, 2018. \n132.  Upon information and belief, it is unlikely that this case will be resolved before \n21 \nDowl, et al., v.

Plaintiffs are entitled to issuance of a preliminary and permanent injunction granting \nthe relief described in the Prayer for Relief below. \n134.  Plaintiffs are entitled to issuance of a preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining \nDefendants from denying Plaintiffs a proper caloric and nutritional diet on any given day. \n135.  Defendantsโ unlawful actions caused Plaintiffs harm and Plaintiffs are entitled to \ninjunctive and declaratory relief, compensatory and punitive damages, in addition to all such other \nrelief this Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneysโ fees in this action. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request this Honorable Court grant declaratory relief and injunctive \nrelief barring Defendants from engaging in further unconstitutional practices in prohibiting Plaintiffs \nand other Muslim prisoners from receiving a balanced nutritional diet containing between 2,600 and \n2,800 calories on any given day during Ramadan.  Further, Plaintiffs request compensatory and \npunitive damages against the Defendants sued in their individual capacity, only, plus all such other \nrelief this Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneysโ fees incurred in this action. \nCount II \nViolation of Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act \n(Religious Exercise) \n136.  Plaintiffs hereby reallege and incorporate by reference the foregoing paragraphs of this \nAmended Complaint as if fully set forth herein. \n137.  Defendantsโ Ramadan Policy, whereby Defendants do not provide Plaintiffs with a \nbalanced nutritional diet containing between 2,600 and 2,800 calories on any given day in Ramadan \nand Defendantsโ Muslim Religious Services Policy, whereby Defendants do not permit Plaintiffs and \nother similarly situated Muslims to perform Friday religious services or Muslim study groups, chill \nPlaintiffsโ right to free exercise of religion. \n138.  Defendants have deprived and continue to deprive Plaintiffs of their right to the free \n22 \nDowl, et al., v. Williams, et al.  \nCase No. 3:18-cv-00119-HRH    \nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 35   Filed 07/06/18   Page 22 of 35\n\nexercise of religion as secured by the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, \n42 U.S.C. ยง 2000cc(a) et seq., by imposing and implementing an unconstitutional and discriminatory \nRamadan and Muslim Religious Services policies that substantially burden Plaintiffsโ religious exercise. \n139.  Defendantsโ Ramadan and Muslim Religious Services policies, in addition to the \nabove-mentioned unlawful actions, caused and continue to cause Plaintiffs harm because it forces \nthem to choose, on a daily basis between violating their core religious beliefs (the first requires them \nto fast during the month of Ramadan and the second, requires them to abstain from foods that violate \ntheir religious tenets) and waiving their right to receiving a menu that meets minimum nutritional \nstandards, and because it forces them to sacrifice their core sincerely-held religious beliefs. \n140.  Defendants have arbitrarily and unjustly  established a Ramadan Policy requiring \nMuslim inmates to receive meals that do not provide a balanced nutritional diet containing between \n2,600 and 2,800 calories on any given day during Ramadan. \n141.  Defendants have arbitrarily and unjustly established a Muslim Religious Services Policy \nthat prohibits Plaintiffs and other similarly situated Muslims from performing Friday religious services \nand conducting Muslim study groups.  \n142.  Defendants have not established a dietary policy requiring inmates of other faiths \nparticipating in religious diets to receive meals that do not meet minimum nutritional standards. \n143.  By imposing and implementing the above-described Ramadan Policy on Plaintiffs and \nother Muslim inmates observing the Ramadan fast, Defendants have imposed a substantial burden on \nPlaintiffsโ exercise of Islam within Anchorage Correctional Complex. \n144.  Defendants have not established a religious services policy that prohibits inmates of \nother faiths from participating in or conducting religious congregational prayers and services. \n145.  The restrictions imposed on Plaintiffs and other Muslim inmates have substantially \nburdened their religious exercise. \n23 \nDowl, et al., v. Williams, et al.  \nCase No. 3:18-cv-00119-HRH    \nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 35   Filed 07/06/18   Page 23 of 35\n\n146.  By imposing and implementing the above-described Muslim Religious Services and \nRamadan policies, Defendants have imposed a substantial burden on Plaintiffsโ exercise of Islam.   \n147.  Imposition of such a burden is not in furtherance of a compelling government interest \nand is not the least restrictive means of furthering any governmental interest, compelling or otherwise. \n148.  Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that the Ramadan and Muslim Religious Services \npolicies are a substantial burden to the free exercise of Plaintiffsโ religion, is not justified by a \ncompelling government interest, and is in violation of RLUIPA. \n149.  Ramadan commenced on May 16, 2018 and ended on June 14, 2018. \n150.  Upon information and belief, it is unlikely that this case will be resolved before \nRamadan concludes. \n151.  Plaintiffs are entitled to issuance of a preliminary and permanent injunction granting \nthe relief described in the Prayer for Relief below. \n152.  Defendantsโ unlawful actions caused Plaintiffs harm and Plaintiffs are entitled to \ninjunctive and declaratory relief, as well as compensatory and punitive damages, in addition to all such \nother relief this Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneysโ fees in this action. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request this Honorable Court grant declaratory relief and injunctive \nrelief in the form requested in the Prayer for Relief below.

Defendants have arbitrarily and unjustly established a Muslim Religious Services Policy \nprohibiting these Plaintiffs and other Muslim inmates similarly situated from performing Friday \nreligious services and daily congregational prayers. \n163.  Defendants have not established a policy prohibiting inmates of other faiths from \nperforming Friday religious services and daily congregational prayers. \n164.  Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that Defendantsโ Ramadan and Muslim Religious \nServices policies constitute discrimination on the basis of Plaintiffsโ religion, are not justified by a \ncompelling government interest, and are in violation of RLUIPA. \n165.

Defendantsโ Muslim Religious Services Policy, in addition to the above-mentioned \nunlawful actions caused and continues to cause Plaintiffs harm because it forces them to sacrifice their \ncore sincerely-held religious beliefs. \n192.  Defendants have deprived and continue to deprive  Plaintiffs and other Muslim \ninmates of their right to equal protection of the laws as secured by the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution, by imposing and implementing a Ramadan and Muslim Religious Services \npolicies in a manner that discriminates against them on the basis of religion. \n193.  Defendants  have  imposed onerous  restrictions on  Plaintiffs that have  not been \nimposed on prisoners of other faiths at Anchorage Correctional Complex and throughout Alaska \nDepartment of Corrections facilities. \n194.  Defendants have arbitrarily and unjustly established a Ramadan Policy requiring \nMuslim inmates to receive meals that do not meet minimum nutritional standards during the month \nof Ramadan. \n195.  Defendants have not established a dietary policy requiring inmates of other faiths \nparticipating in religious diets to receive meals that do not meet minimum nutritional standards. \n196.  The restrictions imposed on Plaintiffs are unconstitutional and have substantially \nburdened their religious exercise. \n197.  By imposing and implementing the above-described Ramadan Policy and denying a \nhalal food diet to Muslim inmates, Defendants have imposed a substantial burden on Plaintiffsโ \nexercise of Islam. \n198.  Imposition of such a burden is not in furtherance of a compelling government interest \nand is not the least restrictive means of furthering any governmental interest, compelling or otherwise.  \n199.  Defendants have arbitrarily and unjustly established a Muslim Religious Services Policy \n30 \nDowl, et al., v. Williams, et al.  \nCase No. 3:18-cv-00119-HRH    \nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 35   Filed 07/06/18   Page 30 of 35\n\nprohibiting these Plaintiffs and other Muslim inmates similarly situated from performing Friday \nreligious services and conducting Muslim study groups. \n200.  Defendants have not established a policy prohibiting inmates of other faiths from \nperforming Friday religious services and conducting religious study groups. \n201.  The restrictions imposed on Plaintiffs are unconstitutional and have substantially \nburdened their religious exercise. \n202.  By imposing and implementing the above-described Muslim Religious Services Policy, \nDefendants have imposed a substantial burden on Plaintiffsโ exercise of Islam within the correctional \nfacilities.  \n203.  Imposition of such a burden is not in furtherance of a compelling government interest \nand is not the least restrictive means of furthering any governmental interest, compelling or otherwise. \nPlaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that the Ramadan and Muslim Religious Services policies are a \nsubstantial burden to the free exercise of  Plaintiffsโ religion, are not justified by a compelling \ngovernment  interest,  and  are  in  violation of  Plaintiffsโ  Fourteenth  Amendment  right to  equal \nprotection of the laws. \n204.  Ramadan commenced on May 16, 2018 and ended on June 14, 2018. \n205.  Upon information and belief, it is unlikely that this case will be resolved before \nRamadan concludes. \n206.  Plaintiffs are entitled to issuance of a preliminary and permanent injunction granting \nthe relief described in the Prayer for Relief below. \n207.  Defendantsโ unlawful actions caused Plaintiffs harm and Plaintiffs are entitled to \ninjunctive and declaratory relief, compensatory and punitive damages, in addition to all such other \nrelief this Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneysโ fees in this action. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request this Honorable Court grant declaratory relief and injunctive \n31 \nDowl, et al., v.

Further, Plaintiffs request compensatory \nand punitive damages against the Defendants sued in their individual capacity, only, plus all such other \nrelief this Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneysโ fees incurred in this action. \nPrayer for Relief \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that this Honorable Court enter judgment in their favor \nand against Defendants on each and every count in this complaint, and enter an Order awarding the \nfollowing relief: \n1.  A declaratory judgment that: \na.  Defendantsโ  policies,  practices,  and  customs  violate  the  First,  Eighth  and \nFourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, the Religious \nLand Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (โRLUIPAโ), and 42 U.S.C. ยง \n1983; \nb.  Defendantsโ  Ramadan  Policy  constitutes  cruel  and  unusual  punishment  in \nviolation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution;  \nc.  Defendantsโ denial of a balanced nutritional diet containing between 2,600 and \n2,800 calories on any given day during Ramadan constitutes a violation of the First \nAmendment to the United States Constitution and creates a chilling effect on \nPlaintiffsโ free exercise of religion; \nd.  Defendantsโ denial of Plaintiffsโ request for a balanced nutritional diet containing \nbetween 2,600 and 2,800 calories on any given day during Ramadan is a substantial \nburden to the free exercise of Plaintiffsโ religion and is not justified by a compelling \ngovernment interest; \ne.  Defendantsโ Ramadan Policy treats these prisoners on less than equal terms with \nother religious and non-religious prisoners in Anchorage Correctional Complex \n32 \nDowl, et al., v. Williams, et al.  \nCase No. 3:18-cv-00119-HRH    \nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 35   Filed 07/06/18   Page 32 of 35\n\nand throughout Alaska Department of Corrections facilities;  \nf.  Defendantsโ actions in preventing these Plaintiffs and other similarly situated \nMuslim inmates from performing Friday religious services and conducting Muslim \nstudy groups, constitutes a violation of the First Amendment to the United States \nConstitution and creates a chilling effect on Plaintiffsโ free exercise of religion; \ng.  Defendantsโ denial of Plaintiffsโ requests to perform Friday religious services and \nMuslim study groups is a substantial burden to the free exercise of Plaintiffsโ \nreligion and is not justified by a compelling government interest; \nh.  The Muslim Religious Services Policy treats these Plaintiffs and similarly situated \nMuslim inmates on less than equal terms with other religious and non-religious \ninmates; and, \ni.  Defendantsโ  unique  application  of  the  Muslim  Religious  Services  Policy  to \nPlaintiffs, and other Muslim inmates similarly situated, treats these Plaintiffs and \nMuslim inmates similarly situated on less than equal terms than inmates of other \nfaiths, thereby creating a denominational preference against Islam as a religion. \n2.  An injunction that: \na.  Enjoins Defendants from denying Plaintiffs a balanced nutritional diet containing \nbetween 2,600 and 2,800 calories on any given day during Ramadan, because \nDefendantsโ denial of the proper caloric and nutritional diet forces Plaintiffs, who \nhave a religious basis for fasting during the month of Ramadan, to choose, on a \ndaily basis, between violating their core religious beliefs (ie: fasting during the \nmonth of Ramadan and abstaining from foods that violate their beliefs) and \nreceiving a menu that meets minimum nutritional standards; \nb.  Requires  Defendants  to  remedy  the  constitutional  and  statutory  violations \n33 \nDowl, et al., v.

Enjoins Defendants from denying Plaintiffs, and other Muslim inmates similarly \nsituated, from performing Friday religious services and conducting Muslim study \ngroups, because Defendantsโ denial of Muslims from performing Friday religious \nservices and Muslim study groups caused and continues to cause Plaintiffs harm \nas it forces them to sacrifice their core sincerely-held religious beliefs; and, \nd.  Requires  Defendants  to  remedy  the  constitutional  and  statutory  violations \nidentified above, including, but not limited to, eliminating any existing policy \nwhereby Plaintiffs, and other Muslim inmates similarly-situated, are denied from \nperforming Friday religious services and conducting Muslim study groups. \n3.  An award of compensatory and punitive damages against the individual capacity \ndefendants, only, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \n4.  An award of attorneysโ fees, costs, and expenses of all litigation, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \nยง 1988; and, \n5.

Upon information and belief, pursuant to the Ramadan Policy, Defendants provide \nMuslim inmates participating in the Ramadan fast, including Plaintiffs, with two bagged meals every \nevening that contain cold meals that range from approximately 500 to approximately 1,100 calories \nper day, depending on the day, which is substantially lower than what is required under Policy and \nProcedure Directive 805.01 โFood Service Standards,โ and the โDietary Guidelines for Americans \n2015-2020.โ \n36. Additionally, pursuant to the Ramadan Bagged Meal Menu, during several days, \nDefendants provide Muslim inmates participating in the Ramadan fast, including Plaintiffs, with \nbologna sandwiches which upon information and belief contain pork product that, in accordance with \ntheir sincerely-held religious beliefs, Plaintiffs and other Muslim inmates are not permitted to eat. \n37. As a result, on the days that Plaintiffs and other Muslim inmates participating in the \nRamadan fast receive bologna sandwiches, in accordance with their sincerely-held religious beliefs, \nthey forego eating the sandwiches and as a result receive even less calories than the already substantially \nlow amount they are given. \n9 \n \nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 1   Filed 05/22/18   Page 9 of 31\n\n38. Upon information and belief, pursuant to the Ramadan Policy, Defendants do not \npermit Muslim inmates participating in the Ramadan fast to receive hot meals, nor do they permit \nthem toeat any food from the regular meal line that other inmates eat at.\n39. Upon information and belief, pursuant to the Ramadan Policy, Defendants do not \npermit Muslim inmates participating in the Ramadan fast to keep any food in their cells or eat any \nfood other than the food that is contained in the two bagged meals provided to them by Defendants. \n40. Accordingly, Plaintiffs other Muslim inmates at that facility, are completely dependent \nupon the Defendants to provide them with food. \n41. The nutritional and caloric intake of the Ramadan Bagged Meal Menu given to \nPlaintiffs and other Muslim inmates participating in the Ramadan fast by Defendants is approximately \nless than half the number of calories that other inmates receive on any given day. \n42. Plaintiffs observe the Ramadan fast, in accordance with their sincerely-held religious \nbelief that fasting the month of Ramadan is a religious obligation which is compulsory on all healthy \nadult Muslims. \n43. During the month of Ramadan, Muslims fast from sunrise to sundown by, among \nother things, abstaining from eating and drinking.  Muslims believe Ramadan is a time for spiritual \nreflection, self-improvement, and increased devotion and worship.\n44. During the month of Ramadan, Muslims are permitted to eat and drink from sundown \nto sunrise. \n45. In order to ensure that Plaintiffs receive their meals before sunrise and after sundown, \nas opposed to regular meal times, Plaintiffs, along with other Muslim inmates, submitted a written \napplication to eat from the Ramadan menu.   \n46. Each of Plaintiffsโ requests to eat from the Religious Ramadan menu were approved. \n47. However, by requesting to eat from the Ramadan menu, Plaintiffs, along with other \n10 \n \nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 1   Filed 05/22/18   Page 10 of 31\n\nMuslim inmates,are forced to sacrifice a proper nutritional and caloric dietin order toadhere to their \nsincerely-held religious beliefs.\n48. Upon information and belief, other inmates on religious diets, menus or meal plans \nare not forced to consume such a significantly reduced number of calories or sacrifice a proper \nnutritional diet.\n49. Defendants, viathe Ramadan Policy,have subjected and continue to subject Plaintiffs \nand other Muslim inmates with a religious basis for participating in the Ramadan fast to cruel and \nunusual punishment, distinctive and disparate treatment, and less than equal terms than inmates of \nother faith backgrounds by denying them a proper nutritional and caloric diet on a daily basis.\n50. Defendants, via the Ramadan Policy, have subjected and continue to subject have \nimposed and continue to impose a substantial burden upon the rights of Plaintiffs and other Muslim \ninmates to the free exercise of religion, and discriminate and continue to discriminate against Plaintiffs \non the basis of religion or religious denomination in violation of, among other laws, RLUIPA. 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 2000cc(b)(2). \n51. Defendants are capable of providing Plaintiffs and other Muslim inmates with a proper \ncaloric and nutritional diet because it provides other inmates at its facilities with a proper caloric and \nnutritional diet.\n52. The substantial burden that the Defendants, via the Ramadan Policy, impose on \nPlaintiffs and other Muslim inmates participating in the Ramadan fast is not necessary, or the least \nrestrictive means, to achieve any compelling state interest.   \nPlaintiffs Anas A. Dowl and Ernest Jacobsson \n53. As discussed above,upon information and belief, the meals provided to Plaintiff Dowl \nduring the month of Ramadan in the years 2017 and 2018 and Plaintiff Jacobsson in the year 2018 did \nnot and do not meet the minimum requirements that all inmates receive a balanced nutritional diet \n11 \n \nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 1   Filed 05/22/18   Page 11 of 31\n\ncontaining between 2,600 and 2,800 calories on any given day during Ramadan.\n54. In fact, the meals provided to Plaintiffs Dowl and Jacobsson are less than half the \nestimated number of calories that they need per day, based on their age, sex and activity level, in \naccordance with the โDietary Guidelines for Americans 2015-2020,โwhich ranges from 2,600 to 2,800 \ncalories per day.3\n55. Moreover, the meals PlaintiffsDowland Jacobsson receiveare โcold meals,โ whereas \nother inmates at the same facility are receiving โhot meals.โ\n56. In  addition  to  receiving  meals  that  are  below  caloric  and  nutritional  standards, \noftentimes during the month of Ramadan, PlaintiffsDowland Jacobssonโs bagged meals containpork \nproduct, which in accordance with their sincerely-held religious beliefs, they are not permitted to eat. \n57. As such, on the days where their bagged meals contain pork product, they cannot and \ndo not consume the pork product; and as a result, they eat even less than the already substantially low \nnumber of calories that they are given. \n58. Plaintiff Dowl filed several Requests for Interview Form (โROIโ) (Form 808.11A) in \naccordance with State of Alaska Department of Corrections Policy and Procedure Directive 808.03 \nโPrisoner Grievances,โ Section VII.A., in an attempt to informally resolve his grievances regarding \nthe inadequate nutrition and calories that he is receiving pursuant to the Ramadan Policy, the pork \nproducts that he is being provided by Defendants that he cannot consume in accordance with his \nsincerely-held religious beliefs, and the lack of hot meals during both Ramadan 2017 and Ramadan \n2018. \n59. Similarly, and for the same reasons, Plaintiff Jacobsson filed several ROIs regarding \nthe inadequate nutrition and calories that he is receiving pursuant to the Ramadan Policy, the pork \nproducts that he is being provided by Defendants that he cannot consume in accordance with his \n                   \n3 Id. at 78. \n12 \n \nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 1   Filed 05/22/18   Page 12 of 31\n\nsincerely-held religious beliefs, and the lack of hot meals during Ramadan 2018.\n60. The grievances in the ROIs were either ignored, denied or left unanswered.\n61. Also in accordance with State of Alaska Department of Corrections Policy and \nProcedure Directive 808.03 โPrisoner Grievances,โ Section VII.B.2., in an attempt to informally \nresolve their grievances regarding the inadequate nutrition and calories that Defendants are providing \nthem pursuant to the Ramadan Policydirectly, the pork products that Defendants are providing them \nthat they cannot consume in accordance with their sincerely-held religious beliefs, and the hot meals \nthat the Defendants are prohibiting them to eat during Ramadan 2018 (Plaintiff Dowl filed similar \nROIs regarding Ramadan 2017), they spoke with Defendant Silliman, Defendant Mata, Defendant \nLuper, Defendant Helms and other staff members aware of or directly involved in their grievances. \n62. On May 19, 2018, Plaintiff Dowl had a prescheduled call with his undersigned counsel. \n63. At the time of the prescheduled call, Plaintiff Dowlโs undersigned counsel spoke with \nDefendant Luper and requested to be connected to Plaintiff Dowl. \n64. Minutes after Plaintiff Dowlโs phone call with his undersigned counsel, Defendant \nLuper conducted a โshake downโ of Plaintiff Dowl and Plaintiff Jacobssonโs cell, and confiscated all \nfood items that they had saved in their cells to eat that day, including the two bagged meals provided \nto them the evening before and four hamburgers that they traded with other inmates in exchange for \nthe bologna sandwiches that they could not eatin accordance with their sincerely-held beliefs.\n65. In response to Plaintiffsโ inquiries as to why Defendant Luper confiscated their food \nthat they had either received from the facility to eat or saved as they were not aware of any policy that \nhas been posted that prohibits them from doing so, she responded that Defendant Williams issued a \npolicy directive by email that prohibited Muslim inmates participating in the Ramadan fast from saving \nfood in their cells. \n66. In  another  attempt  to  informally  resolve  their  grievances,  Plaintiffs  Dowl  and \n13 \n \nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 1   Filed 05/22/18   Page 13 of 31\n\nJacobsson explained to Defendant Luper that they were starving and needed food to eat, and that she \ntook the only food they had to eat.\n67. Defendant Luper responded by advising Plaintiffs that she was confiscating their food \nas a punishment for saving food in their cells.\n68. Defendant Luper further informed Plaintiffs that she was going to remove both \nPlaintiff Dowl and Plaintiff Jacobsson from the Ramadan list as an added disciplinary measure for \nsaving food in their cells. \n69. That day, neither Plaintiff Dowl nor Plaintiff Jacobsson were given any bagged meals \nto eat; and accordingly, they ate nothing that day. \n70. In accordance with their sincerely-held religious beliefs, they continued fasting the next \nday without having had anything to eatthe day before.\n71. In accordance with State of Alaska Department of Corrections Policy and Procedure \nDirective 808.03 โPrisoner Grievances,โ Section VII.A.1.c., Plaintiff Dowl immediately submitted an \nROI and afterwards two Prisoner Grievance Forms (Form 808.03C) regarding the lack of adequate \nmeals and the pork products that he is being fed by Defendants, and Defendant Luper removing him \nfrom the Ramadan list and confiscating the only food he had to eat. \n72. Similarly and for the same reasons, Plaintiff Jacobsson also immediately submitted two\nROIs and afterwards a Prisoner Grievance Form regarding the lack of adequate meals and the pork \nproducts that he is being fed by Defendants, and Defendant Luper removing him from the Ramadan \nlist and confiscating the only food he had to eat. \n73. As of the date of this filing, Plaintiffs have not received any response to the grievances \nfiled by Plaintiffs. \n74. On May 21, 2018, both Plaintiffs Dowl and Jacobsson were told by a correctional \nofficer that Defendant Luper advised that they cannot get food from the main meal line to supplement \n14 \n \nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 1   Filed 05/22/18   Page 14 of 31\n\nthe inadequate bagged meals Defendants are providing to Plaintiffs.\n75. On May 21, 2018, in accordance with State of Alaska Department of Corrections \nPolicy and Procedure Directive 808.03 โPrisoner Grievances,โ Section VI.B.1., both Plaintiffs Dowl \nand Jacobsson requested emergency grievances regarding the lack of adequate meals and the pork \nproducts being fed to them by Defendants. Defendants provided Plaintiffs with standard grievance \nforms instead, and Plaintiff Dowl wrote โemergencyโ across the top. \n76. On May 22, 2018, both of Plaintiffsโ emergency grievances were denied processing as \nan emergency, and upon information and belief, are being processed in accordance with standard \ngrievance procedure timelines. \n77. Because Ramadan commenced on May 16, 2018 and will end on approximately June \n16, 2018; it is unlikely that Plaintiffsโ grievances will be resolved before Ramadan concludes. \n78. In accordance with State of Alaska Department of Corrections Policy and Procedure \nDirective  808.03  โPrisoner  Grievances,โ  Section  VII.D.1.C.,  prisoners  โcannot  appeal  the \nDepartmentโs determination as to whether the issue grieved is an emergency.โ \n79. In the meantime, Plaintiffs are suffering irreparable harm to their health, including \nmalnutrition, starvation, weight loss, hunger pangs, headaches, dizziness, among other things. \n80. Both Plaintiffs have exhausted their administrative remedies related to emergency \ngrievances.\nCount I \nViolation of Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\n(Cruel and Unusual Punishment) \n81. Plaintiffs hereby reallege and incorporate by reference the foregoing paragraphs of this \nVerified Complaint as if fully set forth herein. \n82. Under the Eighth Amendment, prisoners have the right to be from cruel and unusual \npunishment. \n15 \n \nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 1   Filed 05/22/18   Page 15 of 31\n\n83. The Eighth Amendment imposes a duty on Defendants to provide humane conditions \nof confinement, including insuring, among other things, that prisoners receive adequate food.  See\nFarmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825 (1994).\n84. Upon information and belief, the Ramadan Policy does not provide Plaintiffs or \nMuslim inmates who observe the holy fast during Ramadan, a balanced nutritional diet containing \nbetween 2,600 and 2,800 calories on any given day during Ramadan.  \n85. Upon information and belief, the daily caloric intake under the Ramadan Policy ranges \nfrom approximately 500 calories to approximately 1,100 calories, on any given day during Ramadan.  \n86. The nutritional and caloric intake under the Ramadan Policy is approximately less than \nhalf the number of calories that other inmates receive on any given day during Ramadan. \n87. Defendants, acting under color of state law, took Plaintiffs into physical police \ncustody.  In doing so, they established a special custodial relationship with Plaintiffs, giving rise to \naffirmative duties on their part to secure and ensure that Plaintiffs would be given adequate food and \nto secure for Plaintiffs the constitutionally-protected rights identified above.\n88. Defendants,  acting  under  color  of  state  law,  violated  Plaintiffsโ  above-stated \nconstitutionally-protected rights by wrongfully denying them adequate food.\n89. Specifically, Defendants, acting under color of law, owed Plaintiffs the duty to follow, \nimplement, and comply with State of Alaska Department of Corrections Policy and Procedure \nDirective 805.01 โFood Service Standards,โ Section VI.A., and Policy and Procedure Directive 805.01 \nโFood Service Standards,โ Section VII.B.1., which mandate that all menus and meals at correctional \nfacilities  provide  Plaintiffs  โnutritious,  well-balanced  and  heart-healthyโ  meals  that  โmeet  all \nrecommended daily dietary allowances, with adjustments for age, sex, and activity.โ \n90. Defendants, acting under color of law, violated State  of Alaska Department of \nCorrections Policy and Procedure Directive 805.01 โFood Service Standards,โ Section VI.A., and \n16 \n \nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 1   Filed 05/22/18   Page 16 of 31\n\nPolicy and Procedure Directive 805.01 โFood Service Standards,โ Section VII.B.1. by deliberately \nfailing to provide Plaintiffs and other Muslim prisoners who observe the holy fast during Ramadan, a \nbalanced nutritional diet containing between 2,600 and 2,800 calories on any given day during \nRamadan.\n91. Defendantsโ depravation of a balanced nutritional diet containing between 2,600 and \n2,800 calories on any given day during Ramadan is objectively sufficiently serious in that it fails to \nprovide Plaintiffs adequate food (i.e. a humane condition of confinement). \n92. Despite Plaintiffsโ repeated pleas and requests for a proper nutritional and caloric diet \non any given day during Ramadan, Defendants failed to take adequate measures to ensure that \nPlaintiffs were receiving adequate food.\n93. Defendants subjectively perceived, or should have subjectively perceived, Plaintiffsโ \ncomplaints, regarding the inadequacy of food.  \n94. Defendantsโ acts and omissions were sufficiently harmful to evidence a substantial risk \nof serious harmto Plaintiffs and other Muslim inmates observing the Ramadan fast.  \n95. Defendantsโ acts and omissions were sufficiently harmful to offend evolving standards \nof decency in violation of the Eighth Amendment.   \n96. Defendantโ acts and omissions in depriving Plaintiffs of a balanced nutritional diet \ncontaining between 2,600 and 2,800 calories on any given day during Ramadan were such that they \ndenied Plaintiffs and other Muslim inmates the minimal civilized measure of lifeโs necessities.   \n97. Defendantsโ actions while acting under color of state law, in denying Plaintiffs a \nbalanced nutritional diet containing between 2,600 and 2,800 calories on any given day during \nRamadan, amounts to cruel and unusual punishment and excessive force in violation of their\nconstitutionally-protected rights as stated above.  \n98. Defendantsโ conduct as outlined above, was so grossly incompetent, inadequate, or \n17 \n \nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 1   Filed 05/22/18   Page 17 of 31\n\nexcessive so as to shock the conscience or to be intolerable to fundamental fairness and violates the \nEighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.  \n99. Defendants,  acting  under  the  color  of  state  law,  authorized,  tolerated,  ratified, \npermitted, or acquiesced in the creation of policies, practices, and customs, establishing a de facto \npolicy of depriving Plaintiffs and other Muslim prisoners observing the holy fast during Ramadan with \na balanced nutritional diet containing between 2,600 and 2,800 calories on any given day during \nRamadan.\n100. Defendantsโ policies, customs and practices were carried out willfully and with wanton \ndisregard and with the spirit of gross negligence, were the direct and deliberate cause of constitutional \ndeprivations including Plaintiffsโ rights to liberty and due process, and were the direct cause of \nPlaintiffsโ cruel and unusual punishment and excessive force. \n101. As a direct and proximate result of these polices, practices and customs, Plaintiffs were \ndeprived of their constitutionally-protected rights as described above, by Defendants. \n102. As a direct and proximate result of these polices, practices and customs, Plaintiffs were \nand are forced to choose on a daily basis during the month of Ramadan whether to adhere to their \nsincerely-held religious beliefs or sacrifice their basic nutritional needs. \n103. As a direct and proximate result of these polices, practices and customs, Plaintiffs have \nsuffered and will continue to suffer from starvation, weight loss, hunger pangs, severe headaches, \ndizziness, among other things. \n104. As a result of their conduct described above, Defendants are also liable under 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 1983. \n105. Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that the Ramadan Policy is a violation of \nPlaintiffsโ Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. \n106. Ramadan commenced on May 16, 2018 and will end on approximately June 15, 2018. \n18 \n \nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 1   Filed 05/22/18   Page 18 of 31\n\n107. Upon information and belief, it is unlikely that this case will be resolved before \nRamadan concludes.\n108. Plaintiffs are entitled to issuance of a preliminary and permanent injunction granting \nthe relief described in the Prayer for Relief below.\n109. Plaintiffs are entitled to issuance of a preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining \nDefendants from denying Plaintiffs a proper caloric and nutritional diet on any given day. \n110. Defendantsโ unlawful actions caused Plaintiffs harm and Plaintiffs are entitled to \ninjunctive and declaratory relief, compensatory and punitive damages, in addition to all such other \nrelief this Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneysโ fees in this action. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request this Honorable Court grant declaratory relief and injunctive \nrelief barring Defendants from engaging in further unconstitutional practices in prohibiting Plaintiffs \nand other Muslim prisoners from receiving a balanced nutritional diet containing between 2,600 and \n2,800 calories on any given day during Ramadan.  Further, Plaintiffs request compensatory and \npunitive damages against the Defendants sued in their individual capacity, only, plus all such other \nrelief this Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneysโ fees incurred in this action. \nCount II \nViolation of Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act\n(Religious Exercise)\n111. Plaintiffshereby reallegeand incorporateby reference the foregoing paragraphs of this \nVerified Complaint as if fully set forth herein. \n112. Defendantsโ Ramadan Policy, whereby Defendants do not provide Plaintiffs with a \nbalanced nutritional diet containing between 2,600 and 2,800 calories on any given day in Ramadan \nchill Plaintiffsโ right to free exercise of religion. \n113. Defendants have deprived and continue to deprive Plaintiffs of their right to the free \nexercise of religion as secured by the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, \n19 \n \nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 1   Filed 05/22/18   Page 19 of 31\n\n42 U.S.C. ยง 2000cc(a) et seq., by imposing and implementing an unconstitutional and discriminatory\nRamadan Policy that substantially burdensPlaintiffsโ religious exercise.\n114. Defendantsโ Ramadan Policy, in addition to the above-mentioned unlawful actions \ncaused and continues to cause Plaintiffs harm because it forces them to choose, on a daily basis\nbetween violating their core religious beliefs (the first requires them to fast during the month of \nRamadan and the second, requires them to abstain from foods that violate their religious tenets) and \nwaiving their right to receiving a menu that meets minimum nutritional standards. \n115. Defendants have arbitrarily and unjustly established a Ramadan Policy requiring \nMuslim inmates to receive meals that do not provide a balanced nutritional diet containing between \n2,600 and 2,800 calories on any given day during Ramadan. \n116. Defendants have not established a dietary policy requiring inmates of other faiths \nparticipating in religious diets to receive meals that do not meet minimum nutritional standards.\n117. The restrictions imposed on Plaintiffs and other Muslim inmates have substantially \nburdened their religious exercise.\n118. By imposing and implementing the above-described Ramadan Policyon Plaintiffs and \nother Muslim inmates observing the Ramadan fast, Defendants have imposed a substantial burden on \nPlaintiffsโ exercise ofIslam within Anchorage Correctional Complex.\n119. Imposition of such a burden is not in furtherance of a compelling government interest \nand is not the least restrictive means of furthering any governmental interest, compelling or otherwise. \n120. Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that the Ramadan Policy is a substantial burden \nto the free exercise of Plaintiffsโ religion, is not justified by a compelling government interest, and is \nin violation of RLUIPA. \n121. Ramadan commenced on May 16, 2018 and will end on approximately June 15, 2018. \n122. Upon information and belief, it is unlikely that this case will be resolved before \n20 \n \nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 1   Filed 05/22/18   Page 20 of 31\n\nRamadanconcludes.\n123. Plaintiffs are entitled to issuance of a preliminary and permanent injunction granting \nthe relief described in the Prayer forRelief below.\n124. Defendantsโ unlawful actions caused Plaintiffs harm and Plaintiffs are entitled to \ninjunctiveand declaratoryrelief, as well as compensatory and punitive damages, in addition to all such \nother relief this Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneysโ fees in this action. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request this Honorable Court grant declaratory relief and injunctive \nrelief barring Defendants from engaging in further unconstitutional practices in prohibiting Plaintiffs \nand other Muslim prisoners from receiving a balanced nutritional diet containing between 2,600 and \n2,800 calories on any given day during Ramadan.  Further, Plaintiffs request compensatory and \npunitive damages against the Defendants sued in their individual capacity, only, plus all such other \nrelief this Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneysโ fees incurred in this action. \nCount III \nViolation of Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act\n(Discrimination on the Basis of Religion)\n125. Plaintiffshereby reallege and incorporate by reference the foregoing paragraphs of this \nVerified Complaint as if fully set forth herein. \n126. Defendantsโ Ramadan Policytreats Plaintiffs and other Muslim inmates observing the \nRamadan fast on less than equal terms with other religious and non-religious prisoners in Anchorage \nCorrectional Complex and throughout Alaska Department of Corrections facilities.\n127. Defendantsโ Ramadan Policy, in addition to the above-mentioned unlawful actions \ncaused and continues to cause Plaintiffs and other Muslim inmates observing the Ramadan fast harm \nbecause it forces them to choose, on a daily basis between violating their core religious beliefs (the \nfirst requires them to fast during the month of Ramadan and thesecond requires them to abstain from \nfoods that violate their religious tenets) and waiving their right to receiving a menu that meets \n21 \n \nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 1   Filed 05/22/18   Page 21 of 31\n\nminimum nutritional standards.\n128. Defendants have deprived and continue to deprive Plaintiffs and other Muslim \ninmates observing the Ramadan fast of their right to be free from religious discrimination as secured \nby the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000cc(a) et seq., by \nimposing and implementing a Ramadan Policyin a manner that discriminates on the basis of religion.\n129. Defendants have imposed onerous restrictions on Plaintiffs that have  not been \nimposed on prisoners of other faith backgrounds in Anchorage Correctional Complex and throughout \nAlaska Department of Corrections facilities. \n130. Defendants have arbitrarily and unjustly established a Ramadan Policy requiring \nPlaintiffs and other Muslim inmates observing the Ramadan fast to receive meals that do not meet \nminimum nutritional standards during the month of Ramadan. \n131. Defendants have not established a dietary policy requiring inmates of other faith \nbackgrounds participating in religious diets to receive meals that do not meet minimum nutritional \nstandards. \n132. Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that Defendantsโ Ramadan Policy constitutes \ndiscrimination on the basis of Plaintiffsโ religion, is not justified by a compelling government interest, \nand is in violation of RLUIPA.\n133.

Defendantsโ  Ramadan  Policy  and  the  above-mentioned  unlawful  actions  chill \nPlaintiffsโ right to free exercise of religion. \n141. Defendants have deprived and continue to deprive Plaintiffs of their right to free \nexercise of religion as secured by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, made \napplicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, by imposing \nand implementing a Ramadan Policy that substantially burdens Plaintiffsโ religious exercise. \n23 \n \nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 1   Filed 05/22/18   Page 23 of 31\n\n142.

Defendantsโ unlawful actions caused Plaintiffs harm and Plaintiffs are entitled to \ninjunctive and declaratory relief, compensatory and punitive damages, in addition to all such other \nrelief this Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneysโ fees in this action. \n24 \n \nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 1   Filed 05/22/18   Page 24 of 31\n\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request this Honorable Court grant declaratory relief and injunctive \nrelief barring Defendants from engaging in further unconstitutional practices in prohibiting Plaintiffs \nand other Muslim prisoners from receiving a balanced nutritional diet containing between 2,600 and \n2,800 calories on any given day during Ramadan.  Further, Plaintiffs request compensatory and \npunitive damages against the Defendants sued in their individual capacity, only, plus all such other \nrelief this Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneysโ fees incurred in this action.\nCount V \nViolation of First and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\n(Equal Protection)\n152. Plaintiffs hereby reallege and incorporateby reference the foregoing paragraphs of this \nVerified Complaint as if fully set forth herein. \n153. Defendantsโ Ramadan Policy treats these prisoners on less than equal terms with other \nreligious and non-religious prisoners in Anchorage Correctional Complex and throughout Alaska \nDepartment of Corrections facilities, thereby creating a denominational preference against Islam as a \nreligion. \n154. Defendantsโ Ramadan Policy, in addition to the above-mentioned unlawful actions \ncaused and continues to cause Plaintiffs and other Muslim inmates observing the Ramadan fast harm \nbecause it forces them to choose, on a daily basis between violating their core religious beliefs (the \nfirst requires them to fast during the month of Ramadanand the secondrequires them to abstain from \nfoods that violate their religious tenets) and waiving their right to receiving a menu that meets \nminimum nutritional standards. \n155. Defendants have deprived and continue to deprive Plaintiffs and other Muslim \ninmates observing the Ramadan fast of their right to equal protection of the laws as secured by the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, by imposing and implementing a Ramadan \nPolicy in a manner that discriminates on the basis of religion.\n25 \n \nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 1   Filed 05/22/18   Page 25 of 31\n\n156. Defendants have imposed onerous restrictions on Plaintiffs that have  not been \nimposed on prisoners of other faiths at Anchorage Correctional Complex and throughout Alaska \nDepartment of Corrections facilities.\n157. Defendants have arbitrarily and unjustly established a Ramadan Policy requiring \nMuslim inmates to receive meals that do not meet minimum nutritional standards during the month \nof Ramadan. \n158. Defendants have not established a dietary policy requiring inmates of other faiths \nparticipating in religious diets to receive meals that do not meet minimum nutritional standards.\n159. The restrictions imposed on Plaintiffs are unconstitutional and have substantially \nburdened their religious exercise. \n160. By imposing and implementing the above-described Ramadan Policy and denying a \nhalal food diet to Muslim inmates, Defendants have imposed a substantial burden on Plaintiffsโ \nexercise of Islam. \n161. Imposition of such a burden is not in furtherance of a compelling government interest \nand is not the least restrictive means of furthering any governmental interest, compelling or otherwise.\n162. Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that the Ramadan Policy is a substantial burden \nto the free exercise of Plaintiffsโ religion, is not justified by a compelling government interest, and is \nin violation of Plaintiffsโ Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection of the laws.\n163. Ramadan commenced on May 16, 2018 and will end on approximately June 15, 2018. \n164. Upon information and belief, it is unlikely that this case will be resolved before \nRamadan concludes. \n165. Plaintiffs are entitled to issuance of a preliminary and permanent injunction granting \nthe relief described in the Prayer for Relief below. \n166. Defendantsโ unlawful actions caused Plaintiffs harm and Plaintiffs are entitled to \n26 \n \nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 1   Filed 05/22/18   Page 26 of 31\n\ninjunctive and declaratory relief, compensatory and punitive damages, in addition to all such other \nrelief this Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneysโ fees in this action.\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request this Honorable Court grant declaratory relief and injunctive \nrelief barring Defendants from engaging in further unconstitutional practices in prohibiting Plaintiffs \nand other Muslim prisoners from receiving a balanced nutritional diet containing between 2,600 and \n2,800 calories on any given day during Ramadan.  Further, Plaintiffs request compensatory and \npunitive damages against the Defendants sued in their individual capacity, only, plus all such other \nrelief this Court deems just and proper including costs and attorneysโ fees incurred in this action.\nPrayer for Relief\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that this Honorable Court enter judgment in their favor \nand against Defendants on each and every count in this complaint, and enter an Order awarding the \nfollowing relief: \n1. A declaratory judgment that: \na. Defendantsโ  policies,  practices,  and  customs  violate  the  First,  Eighth and \nFourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, the Religious \nLand Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (โRLUIPAโ), and 42 U.S.C. ยง \n1983;\nb. Defendantsโ  Ramadan  Policy  constitutes  cruel  and  unusual  punishment  in \nviolation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution;  \nc. Defendantsโ denial of a balanced nutritional diet containing between 2,600 and \n2,800 calories on any given day during Ramadan constitutes a violation of the First \nAmendment to the United States Constitution and creates a chilling effect on \nPlaintiffsโ free exercise of religion; \nd. Defendantsโ denial of Plaintiffsโ request for a balanced nutritional diet containing \n27 \n \nCase 3:18-cv-00119-HRH   Document 1   Filed 05/22/18   Page 27 of 31\n\nbetween 2,600and 2,800calories on any given day during Ramadan is a substantial \nburden to the free exercise of Plaintiffsโ religion and is not justified by a compelling \ngovernment interest;\ne. Defendantsโ Ramadan Policy treats these prisoners on less than equal terms with \nother religious and non-religious prisoners in Anchorage Correctional Complex \nand throughout Alaska Department of Corrections facilities;  \n2. An injunction that: \na. Enjoins Defendants from denying Plaintiffs a balanced nutritional diet containing \nbetween 2,600 and 2,800 calories on any given day during Ramadan, because \nDefendantsโ denial of the proper caloric and nutritional diet forces Plaintiffs, who \nhave a religious basis for fasting during the month of Ramadan, to choose, on a \ndaily basis, between violating their core religious beliefs (ie: fasting during the \nmonth of Ramadan and abstaining from foods that violate their beliefs) and \nreceiving a menu that meets minimum nutritional standards; \nb. Requires  Defendants  to  remedy  the  constitutional  and  statutory  violations \nidentified above, including, but not limited to, eliminating any existing policy \nwhereby Plaintiffs and other Muslim prisoners, and others similarly-situated, are \ndenied a balanced nutritional diet containing between 2,600 and 2,800 calories on \nany given day during Ramadan; \n3.
