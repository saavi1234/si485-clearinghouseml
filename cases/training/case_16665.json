Sessions , No. 3:18−cv−1106. There is no objection. The Court finds that these two cases involve \"common question[s] of law or fact,\" see Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(a), relating to the same government policy of separating minor children from their asylum−seeking or migrant parents, as reflected in Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order or Preliminary Injunction and the supporting memorandum of law. ECF No. 17. The Court therefore grants the motion to consolidate the cases. See R.W. Grand Lodge of Free & Accepted Masons of Pennsylvania v. Meridian Capital Partners, Inc. , 634 Fed. App'x 4, 6 (2d Cir. 2015) (\"A party moving for consolidation 'must bear the burden of showing the commonality of factual and legal issues in different actions, and a district court must examine the special underlying facts with close attention before ordering a consolidation.'\")(quoting In re Repetitive Stress Injury Litig. , 11 F.3d 368, 373 (2d Cir. 1993)). The new caption will be J.S.R. and V.F.B. v. Sessions , No. 3:18−cv−1106. The Court will also consolidate the two hearings currently scheduled for Wednesday, July 11, 2018. The Court will hear argument in the consolidated case, No. 3:18−cv−1106, at 11:30 a.m. on July 11, 2018. To the extent that the parties believe that consolidation requires modification of the Court's Order granting in part and denying in part the motion for writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum, the parties should submit a request to modify that Order as needed.

Sessions, No. 3:18-cv-1106. There is no objection. The Court finds that these two cases involve \"common question[s] of law or fact,\" see Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(a), relating to the same government policy of separating minor children from their asylum-seeking or migrant parents, as reflected in Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order or Preliminary Injunction and the supporting memorandum of law. ECF No. 17. The Court therefore grants the motion to consolidate the cases. See R.W. Grand Lodge of Free & Accepted Masons of Pennsylvania v. Meridian Capital Partners, Inc., 634 Fed. App'x 4, 6 (2d Cir. 2015) (\"A party moving for consolidation 'must bear the burden of showing the commonality of factual and legal issues in different actions, and a district court must examine the special underlying facts with close attention before ordering a consolidation.'\")(quoting In re Repetitive Stress Injury Litig., 11 F.3d 368, 373 (2d Cir. 1993)). The new caption will be J.S.R. and V.F.B. v. Sessions, No. 3:18-cv-1106. The Court will also consolidate the two hearings currently scheduled for Wednesday, July 11, 2018. The Court will hear argument in the consolidated case, No. 3:18-cv-1106, at 11:30 a.m. on July 11, 2018. To the extent that the parties believe that consolidation requires modification of the Court's Order granting in part and denying in part the motion for writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum, the parties should submit a request to modify that Order as needed.

    "summary": "<p>This lawsuit grew out of the Trump Administration's family separation policy, by which kids were separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border. </p><p>On July 2, 2018, two children from Central America who had been separated from their parents after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border filed these separate lawsuits and petitions for habeas corpus against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut. The plaintiffs, who were represented by the Yale Law School's clinic (the Jerome Frank Legal Services Organization) and by Connecticut Legal Services, sought injunctive relief, habeas relief, and attorneys fees. The plaintiffs claimed violations of Fifth Amendment substantive and procedural due process, Fifth Amendment equal protection, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. § 701), and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. §§ 551 et seq.). The plaintiffs alleged that after they were apprehended in Texas by Border Patrol, a subagency of the Department of Homeland Security, they were forcibly separated from their parents and placed with a resettlement agency in Connecticut. They alleged that they were then kept incommunicado from their parents for several weeks at a time, and that the forced separation caused severe mental and emotional trauma.</p><p>The plaintiffs each filed motions for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction on July 5, 2018, arguing that separation from their parents caused them irreparable harm. The government objected that a preliminary injunction in this case would interfere with its efforts to implement the relief ordered in a concurrent lawsuit, <i>Ms. L. v. ICE</i>, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. The judge in that case had already ordered the government to reunite all families separated by the Trump Administration’s “zero tolerance” policy by July 26. 2018 WL 3129486. There's more information on the Ms. L. case <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16620\">here</a>.</p><p>The two Connecticut cases were consolidated on July 9, 2018. After a hearing on the plaintiffs’ motions on July 11, District Judge Victor A. Bolden granted the plaintiffs' motions in part and denied them in part. Judge Bolden sided with the plaintiffs’ arguments that their constitutional rights were violated. 2018 WL 3421321. Although he agreed with the government that ordering the immediate reunification of the parents with the plaintiffs would merely duplicate the relief ordered in the California case, he noted that the relief in that case was designed to remedy the constitutional wrong suffered by parents separated from their children, whereas his injunction in this case was designed to remedy that suffered by children. He thus issued writs of habeas corpus ad testificandum so that the parents would be physically present at a July 18 status conference intended to address the proper form of relief for the two plaintiffs, including any treatment for the trauma they had suffered. He also ordered that the plaintiffs be allowed to communicate daily with their parents via video conference. </p><p>On July 16, the government filed a notice of compliance indicating that the plaintiffs would be reunited with their parents that same day, and that ICE would parole the parents from custody.</p><p>As <a href=\"https://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/children_trauma_separation/\">this article</a> explains, the plaintiffs' lawyers offered this case as a model for other litigators elsewhere. Because the lawsuit focused on repairing harm to the children, Judge Bolden allowed the kids to be released to their parents outside of federal custody, without even ankle monitors to keep track of their location. </p><p>At the July 18 status conference, the plaintiffs' attorneys requested additional time to confer and determine what, if any, other forms of relief they might seek. The defendants argued that this case was now moot, and the court continued the matter to July 27. </p><p>On July 26, the plaintiffs filed a motion seeking a continuance of the status conference. The same day, the defendants objected to the plaintiffs' motion, arguing that the defendants had already advised the plaintiffs that they would be provided with referrals for treatment and other services, and that the case should be dismissed. In response, the court cancelled the July 27 hearing and scheduled a hearing for September 5 to address the issue of mootness. </p><p>On August 29, 2018, the parties filed a stipulation of dismissal with the court. Each party was to bear its own costs, expenses, and fees. </p><p>The case is now closed. </p><p></p>",

    "summary_short": "In 2018, two children from Central America filed separate complaints and petitions for habeas corpus in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut. The plaintiffs alleged that after being apprehended by ICE, they were forcibly separated from their parents as part of the Trump Administration's \"zero tolerance\" policy toward illegal border crossings, in violation of their Fifth Amendment due process rights. Before the two complaints were filed, a federal district court in California had already held that ICE's forcible family separations violated parents' constitutional rights and ordered the government to reunify them with their children, but the plaintiffs in this case successfully argued that the relief ordered in that case would be inadequate for them, because as children they were not in the class affected by that order. The court ordered ICE to make the parents physically present for a later status conference, and a few days later the government filed a notice of compliance indicating that the plaintiffs would be immediately reunified with their parents and the parents would be paroled from detention by ICE. The government agreed to make referrals for the plaintiffs so that they could receive treatment for the trauma they suffered while separated from their parents. On August 29, 2018, the parties filed a stipulation of dismissal with the court and the case was closed. ",

J.S.R. is a nine-year-old boy who fled with his father from Honduras after J.S.R.’s \ngrandparents were murdered and a body was left in the family’s backyard. Fearing for their lives, \nJ.S.R. and his father sought refuge in this country. Defendants-Respondents (“Defendants”) \ndetained J.S.R and his father near the southern border of the United States in June 2018. The \nfederal government’s response to the plight of J.S.R. and his father was to hold them in freezing \nconditions near the border, separate the young child from his father while the child was sleeping, \nand refuse to provide J.S.R. accurate information about his father. The federal government has \nput two thousand miles between a frightened nine-year-old boy and the most important person in \nhis life, causing J.S.R acute psychological harm and exposing him to the significant risk of long-\nterm mental, emotional, and physical damage as a result of his trauma.   \n2.  J.S.R. and his father, J.S.G., arrived in the United States soon after Defendants \nannounced implementation of their “zero tolerance policy,” which subjects asylum seekers to \nprosecution for unlawful entry and forcibly separates parents from children, for the express \npurpose of deterring asylum seekers from coming to the United States. J.S.G. is a caring and \ndedicated father: J.S.R. sees him as his hero and protector against the dangers that drove him \nfrom the country of his birth. There is no basis to believe that J.S.R. has ever been subject to \nabuse and neglect by his father, J.S.G. \n3.  Upon information and belief, the government has taken no steps to reunite J.S.R. \nand his father. As a result, the initial trauma of government agents wresting a frightened nine-\nyear-old child from his father has been compounded by their indefinite separation and prolonged \ndetention. This has unnecessarily inflicted additional emotional harm on J.S.R. while frustrating \n1 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 1   Filed 07/02/18   Page 3 of 21\nhis ability to pursue his legal claims, including asylum and the present action, without the \nopportunity for meaningful communication with his father. \n4.  The government’s continued detention of J.S.R., and its continued, forcible \nseparation of J.S.R. from his father is unlawful, and it subjects J.S.R. to ongoing harm that \ncannot be remediated without releasing him from detention and reuniting him with his father.   \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1346, 2201-2202, \n2241, and Article I, clause 9 § 2 and Article III of the U.S. Constitution. \n6.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C § 1391 because Plaintiff J.S.R. is currently in \ncustody of Defendants in Mystic, Connecticut and a substantial part of the events or omissions \ngiving rise to the claims made herein occurred or are occurring in Connecticut.  \nPARTIES \n7.  Plaintiff J.S.R. is a nine-year old national of Honduras. He has been in the custody \nof the federal government for at least three weeks. J.S.R. brings this lawsuit through a next friend \nas a result of his incapacity due to his minor status, his trauma-related disability, his limited \naccess to the courts while detained, his unfamiliarity with U.S. law, and his inability to seek \nadvice and counsel from the most important person in his life – his father, J.S.R. – as a result of \nthe government’s actions.  \n8.  Joshua Perry is Deputy Director of Connecticut Legal Services (CLS), a non-\nprofit law firm that is dedicated to improving the lives of low-income people, including children \nand immigrants, by providing access to justice. CLS has established an attorney-client \nrelationship with J.S.R. to assist him in obtaining relief from removal from the United States.

He has responsibility for the administration of the \nimmigration laws pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1103, oversees the Executive Office of Immigration \nReview, and is empowered to grant relief from removal.  \n10.  Defendant U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has responsibility for \nenforcing the immigration laws of the United States. \n11.  Defendant Kirstjen Nielsen is the Secretary of DHS and is sued in her official \ncapacity. She directs each of the component agencies within DHS, including ICE. Defendant \nNielsen is responsible for implementing U.S. immigration laws and policies, including policies \nrelated to family separation and family detention at the U.S. southern border. \n12.  Defendant U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) is the sub-agency of \nDHS that is responsible for enforcement operations along the borders of the United States, \nincluding the southern border. \n13.

He oversees the apprehension and detention of individuals, including asylum \nseekers, who enter the United States at or near the U.S. border. \n14.  Defendant U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) is the sub-agency \nof DHS that is responsible for the detention and removal operations of DHS. \n15.  Defendant Ronald D. Vitiello is the Acting Director of ICE and is sued in his \nofficial capacity. He directs the nation’s immigration detention system and oversees the removal \nof families ordered deported at ICE detention facilities. Defendant Vitiello plays a critical role in \n3 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 1   Filed 07/02/18   Page 5 of 21\nsetting detention policies that affect asylum seekers who are held in detention while they await \nthe first steps of the asylum process. \n16.  Defendant U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) is the sub-\nagency of DHS that, through its asylum officers, conducts interviews of certain individuals \napprehended at or near the border to determine whether they have a credible fear of persecution \nand must be permitted to apply for asylum.   \n17.  Defendant L. Francis Cissna is the Director of USCIS and is sued in his official \ncapacity.  \n18.

Defendant Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”) is the component of HHS \nwhich provides placement and care for “unaccompanied” non-citizen minor children and holds \nlegal custody of J.S.R. \n21.  Scott Lloyd is the director of ORR and is sued in his official capacity. \nLEGAL AND FACTUAL FRAMEWORK OF FAMILY SEPARATION \nArriving Families’ Right to Seek Asylum \n22.  United States law entitles non-citizens on American soil to seek asylum, without \nregard to how they arrive. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1). Since 1996, immigration law has also provided \nauthority for “expedited removal,” or the removal of certain individuals from the United States \nwithout a removal hearing. Id. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i).  \n4 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 1   Filed 07/02/18   Page 6 of 21\n23.  Even an individual subject to expedited removal, however, must receive a \nremoval hearing if the person “indicates either an intention to apply for asylum . . . or a fear of \npersecution.” Id. Under such circumstances, an asylum officer evaluates whether the individual \nhas a “credible fear” of persecution in their home country. Id. U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii). If an \nasylum officer determines that there is a “significant possibility” that such an individual could \nprove eligibility for fear-based relief, id. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v), then the asylum seeker is placed \ninto regular removal proceedings. Id. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii).   \nThe Government’s Policies Before “Zero Tolerance” \n24.  Prior to implementing a systematic policy of family separation in 2018, the \ngovernment did not detain some families apprehended at the border at all, instead placing them \nin regular removal proceedings. For others, the government followed expedited removal \nprocedures, and detained members of these families together. If Defendants found these family \nmembers to have a credible fear of persecution, they would release the family from detention.  \n25.  When the government decides to detain children, it is subject to the Flores \nSettlement, which implements a “general policy favoring release” of minors. See Settlement \nAgreement, Flores v. Reno, No. CV-85-4544-RJK (C.D. Cal. Jan. 17, 1997), available at \nhttps://tinyurl.com/y9fxrbsp (hereinafter “Flores Settlement”). The Flores Settlement \n“unambiguously applies both to accompanied and unaccompanied minors” in DHS custody. \nFlores v. Lynch, 828 F.3d 898, 901 (9th Cir. 2016), and requires the government to “place each \ndetained minor in the least restrictive setting appropriate to the minor’s age and special needs . . \n.” Flores Settlement ¶ 11.  \n26.  Under the settlement, children must be released from detention within five days, \nor within twenty days in certain emergency circumstances, to a parent, legal guardian, adult \n5 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 1   Filed 07/02/18   Page 7 of 21\nrelative, adult designated by a legal guardian, or (if none of these individuals are available) a \nlicensed program willing to accept legal custody. Id. ¶¶ 12, 14.  \n27.  Starting in January 2016, the government piloted the Family Case Management \nProgram (“FCMP”) as an “alternative to detention . . . initiative that use[d] qualified case \nmanagers to promote participant compliance with their immigration obligations” through a wrap-\naround service model. The ICE Office of Inspector General determined that the FCMP was 99 \npercent effective at ensuring participant attendance for ICE check-ins and appointments, and 100 \npercent effective at ensuring attendance for court hearings. U.S. Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement’s Award of the Family Case Management Program Contract (Redacted), DHS \nOffice of Inspector General, at 5 (OIG-18-22) (Nov. 30, 2017), available at \nhttps://tinyurl.com/y96l9t8y. Nevertheless, the government closed the program in June 2017. \nThe Government’s “Zero Tolerance” Family Separation Policy \n28.  In early 2017, DHS contemplated changing its policy on asylum-seeking families \nby implementing family separation to deter migration from Central America into the United \nStates. In March 2017, then-DHS Secretary John Kelly stated that he was considering separating \narriving children from their parents “in order to deter more movement” into the United States. \n29.  On May 7, 2018, Defendant Sessions announced a “zero tolerance policy” of \ncoercive family separation in order to deter asylum seekers and other migrants from crossing into \nthe United States. Defendant Sessions explained, “If you cross this border unlawfully, then we \nwill prosecute you. It’s that simple. . . . If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you \nand that child will be separated from you . . . .” Remarks Discussing the Immigration \nEnforcement Actions of the Trump Administration (May 7, 2018), available at \nhttps://tinyurl.com/ybqbfubb. \n6 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 1   Filed 07/02/18   Page 8 of 21\n30.  The government applied its “zero-tolerance policy” against parents who crossed \nthe border with their own children seeking asylum, including J.S.R. Defendants have forcibly \nseparated over 2,300 children from their parents while crossing the border, some only months \nold.  \n31.  Children forcibly separated from their parents were transferred to the custody of \nthe Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”), a component of HHS, and sent to shelters and \ntemporary housing. ORR deems these children as “unaccompanied minors.”  \n32.  Under ORR policies, a child will be released from ORR custody only after ORR \nundertakes an onerous and lengthy procedure to determine that a potential custodian, or \n“sponsor,” is suitable for providing for the child’s physical and mental well-being.  \n33.  In the face of widespread public condemnation of coerced family separation as a \ngrave violation of American values, President Trump purportedly retracted the policy on June \n20, 2018. Exec. Order, Affording Congress an Opportunity to Address Family Separation, 2018 \nWL 3046068 (June 20, 2018) (hereinafter “EO”). The EO continued the policy of initiating \ncriminal proceedings for all individuals who crossed the border without authorization; however, \nin place of systematic separation of families, the EO called for indefinite detention of families in \ncamps and makeshift facilities. Id. \nThe Government’s Ongoing Failure to Reunify Families \n34.  The EO did not include any provisions to reunite families that had been separated \nat the border, nor did it purport to remediate the trauma or other harms caused by family \nseparation. \n35.  DHS has not disclosed any process for reunification of families prior to removal, \nincluding during the pendency of asylum claims, which may last for months. In litigation in the \n7 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 1   Filed 07/02/18   Page 9 of 21\nU.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, Defendants did not dispute that they \nhad “no plans or procedures to reunify the parent with the child other than arranging for them to \nbe deported together after the parent’s immigration case is concluded.” Ms. L. v. ICE, __ F. \nSupp. 3d __, 2018 WL 3129486, at *5 (S.D. Cal. June 26, 2018) (internal quotations omitted). \nThe court found that “under the present system migrant children are not accounted for with the \nsame efficiency and accuracy as property.” Id. at *7 (emphasis in original). \nThe Racial Animus Underlying Coerced Family Separation \n36.  The Trump Administration adopted its policy of coerced family separation as a \ncentral part of an anti-immigrant agenda, motivated primarily by racial animus against \nindividuals of Hispanic origin and individuals from Central America.  \n37.  On the first day of his presidential campaign, Candidate Trump stated: “When \nMexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. . . . They’re bringing drugs. They’re \nbringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” Donald Trump \nAnnounces a Presidential Bid, WASH. POST (June 16, 2015), available at \nhttps://tinyurl.com/gl6ofm5. \n38.  Since taking office, President Trump has consistently pursued immigration \npolicies motivated by racial animus against non-European immigrants. In summer 2017, he \nstated that the 15,000 Haitians admitted to the United States “all have AIDS,” and expressed \nconcern that Nigerian nationals in the United States would never “go back to their huts” in \nAfrica. Aaron Blake, Trump’s ‘shithole’ comment about Haiti lends credence to report he said \nHaitians ‘all have AIDS’, WASH. POST (Jan. 11, 2018), available at \nhttps://tinyurl.com/ybspu5qa.  \n8 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 1   Filed 07/02/18   Page 10 of 21\n39.  In January 2018, President Trump complained about protections for individuals \nfrom specific Central American and African countries, asking why the United States was \nadmitting “all these people from shithole countries,” as opposed to countries like Norway. Id. In \nMay 2018, President Trump characterized certain unauthorized migrants as “animals.” Jamelle \nBouie, The “Animal” Debate is Over, SLATE, June 19, 2018, https://tinyurl.com/yckbshah. The \nnext month, defending his coerced family separation policy, the President alleged that families \ncrossing the border with their children “could be murderers and thieves and so much else,” and \nwarned that “[t]he United States will not be a migrant camp. . . .” Id. \n40.  The Administration’s shifting race-neutral explanations for coerced family \nseparation are pretextual. President Trump falsely asserted that family separation was required \nunder an unnamed law, but he unilaterally ended the policy through an executive order two days \nlater. DHS Secretary Nielsen claimed that the policy was necessary due to arriving adults and \nchildren fraudulently claiming to be family units, but less than one percent of families \napprehended at the border made such fraudulent claims.

J.S.R. and his father, J.S.G. came to the United States in or around June 2018, \nfearing for their lives if they stayed in Honduras. They traveled for approximately two months, \noften by foot, in order to seek asylum in the United States. \n42.  Shortly after J.S.R. and J.S.G. entered the U.S., federal immigration officials \napprehended them near the southern border and detained them. They have both been detained by \nthe federal government since then. \n43.  Upon information and belief, J.S.G. expressed a fear to return to Honduras to a \nfederal immigration official.  \n44.  Defendants initially detained J.S.G. and J.S.R. together, first at a detention facility \nthat J.S.R. knows as the “hielera,” or “freezer” in Spanish. During this time, J.S.R. saw his father \ncrying and shaking. The freezing temperatures and his father’s emotional state caused J.S.R. \nsignificant distress.  \n45.  After holding them at the “hielera,” Defendants transferred J.S.G. and J.S.R. to an \nimmigration detention center in Texas.  \n46.  One day in early-to-mid June, while J.S.R. was sleeping, federal agents took his \nfather away from him. Defendants brought J.S.R. into an area with other parents and children, \nwhere he thought he would be reunited with his father. He observed other children being \nreunited, but his father was not there. Since J.S.R. awoke that day, J.S.R. has not seen his father.   \n47.  Defendants are currently detaining J.S.G. over 2,000 miles from J.S.R., at the Port \nIsabel Service Detention Center in Los Fresnos, Texas.  \n48.  Left alone, J.S.R. asked over and over about his father. In response, federal agents \nhave variously refused to disclose information about his father, told him inaccurately that his \n1 0\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 1   Filed 07/02/18   Page 12 of 21\nfather was just doing paperwork and would return soon, and claimed that they did not know why \nhe was not with his father.  \n49.  After Defendants took J.S.R. away from his father, they kept J.S.R. in cages with \nother young children for approximately four days. The location in which J.S.R. was detained had \nno windows. During this time, J.S.R. suffered significant harm, constantly crying for his father, \nwitnessing other young children cry, and experiencing enormous confusion over his father’s \nabsence and his own detention. J.S.R. did not understand why he was separated from his father, \nwhen he would see him again, or whether he was at risk of being returned to Honduras, which he \nassociates with the risk of violence and death.  \n50.  Defendants eventually transferred J.S.R. from ICE custody to the custody of the \nORR in mid-June 2018. When J.S.R. was informed he would be transferred, federal officials \nprovided him conflicting information. One immigration official stated that he was going far away \nfrom his father and would not be able to see his father, while another stated that he would soon \nbe close to his father and be able to see him often. \n51.  On or around June 16, 2018, ORR placed J.S.R. with Noank Community Support \nServices, Inc., a non-profit agency based in Groton, Connecticut that contracts to house children \nin custody of the federal government. Noank Community Support Services receives federal \nfunding as a result of its contract with ORR, but does not offer legal representation. J.S.R. has \nbeen held in ORR custody at Noank Community Support Services since on or around June 16.  \n52.  Defendants’ actions in separating J.S.R. from his father, together with \nDefendants’ other actions and failures to act, have caused significant and immediate mental and \nemotional harm to J.S.R., and threaten even greater long-term harm.   \n1 1\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 1   Filed 07/02/18   Page 13 of 21\n53.  On information and belief, J.S.R. has been exposed to multiple significant \ntraumatic events throughout his young life – from grinding poverty to destruction of his home in \na hurricane to seeing the executed bodies of his grandparents. In the face of this trauma, his \nfather has been his primary caregiver and source of protection and strength. To an even greater \nextent than other children his age, J.S.R. relies on the love and support of his father to help him \nsurvive a terrifying world.  \n54.  J.S.R. is suffering deeply as a result of result of Defendants’ actions. Since \nDefendants separated him from his father, J.S.R has begun exhibiting severe and debilitating \nsymptoms of acute trauma. He manifests numerous symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder \n(PTSD), and on information and belief, suffers from PTSD.  He cries often, and worries \nconstantly about his father. He does not sleep at night. He is deeply depressed. He has trouble \nconcentrating or communicating, and cannot bring himself to trust others.   \n55.  Defendants’ actions are not only causing short-term trauma but also threaten \nsignificant long-term damage to J.S.R. Childhood trauma and enforced separation from loved \nones carries a dramatically increased risk of long-term psychiatric illness, including major \ndepressive disorder, and anxiety disorders. Children who have suffered from trauma are also at \nsignificantly increased risk of physical illness. \n56.  J.S.R. has expressed to CLS his desire to be reunited with his father and his fear if \nreturned to Honduras.  \n57.  On information and belief, J.S.R. has no relatives in Connecticut and, since his \ndetention at Noank Community Support Services, he has been able to speak with his father only \nonce. J.S.R. does not know whether Defendants will reunite him with his father or when he can \n1 2\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 1   Filed 07/02/18   Page 14 of 21\nsee his father next.  During the one phone call he has been permitted with his father, J.S.R. was \nunable to discuss with him his legal rights, including the issues presented in the present action. \n58.  The government does not have any legitimate interest in separating J.S.R. from \nhis father. There is no allegation that J.S.G. is an unfit parent to J.S.R.  \n59.  J.S.R. requests an order that Defendants immediately release him into the custody \nof his father, or to such other suitable adult as J.S.G. may direct. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n  \nCOUNT I  \n(Violation of Substantive Due Process) \n \n60.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set \nforth herein.  \n61.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment applies to all “persons” on \nUnited States soil and thus applies to J.S.R.  \n62.  J.S.R. has a liberty interest under the Due Process Clause in remaining together \nwith his father, J.S.G., as a family.  \n63.  The separation of J.S.R. from his father violates substantive due process because \nit furthers no legitimate purpose, much less a compelling governmental interest.  \nCOUNT II \n (Violation of Procedural Due Process) \n \n64.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set \nforth herein.  \n65.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment applies to all “persons” on \nUnited States soil and thus applies to J.S.R.  \n1 3\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 1   Filed 07/02/18   Page 15 of 21\n66.  J.S.R. has a liberty interest under the Due Process Clause in remaining together \nwith his father, J.S.G., as a family.  \n67.  The separation of J.S.R. from his father violates procedural due process because it \ndeprived J.S.R. of his protected liberty interest without notice or any opportunity to be heard. \nCOUNT III \n(Violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act) \n \n68.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set \nforth herein. \n69.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Section 504”) provides that “no \notherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of his or her disability, \nbe excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination \nunder any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.” 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n70.  Disability is defined to include “(A) a physical or mental impairment that \nsubstantially limits one or more major life activities . . .” 29 U.S.C. § 705(20)(B); 42 U.S.C. § \n12102. \n71.  J.S.R. suffers from the effects of chronic trauma and acute PTSD. The effects of \nchronic trauma cause an impairment that limits J.S.R.’s ability to concentrate, think, and \ncommunicate. J.S.R. thus has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or \nmore major life activities. \n72.  Defendants’ separation of J.S.R. from his father and decision to detain J.S.R \nthousands of miles away exacerbate J.S.R.’s existing limitations in communication, including \nwhen relating his past trauma. As a result, J.S.R. faces barriers in presenting his claims and is \nbeing denied equal and equally effective access to the asylum process on the basis of disability.  \n1 4\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 1   Filed 07/02/18   Page 16 of 21\n73.  J.S.R. is “otherwise qualified” to participate in any removal proceedings currently \npending against him and in affirmative asylum proceedings, as well as in the programs and \nactivities of his temporary placement by ORR in a children’s shelter.   \n74.  The children’s shelter at which J.S.R. is currently detained by ORR has received \nsubstantial federal financial assistance. Immigration proceedings, including asylum adjudications \nbefore USCIS and removal proceedings prosecuted by ICE before an Immigration Judge, are \nfederal programs. \n75.  The regulations implementing Section 504 prohibit entities receiving federal \nfinancial assistance from utilizing “criteria or methods of administration (i) that have the effect \nof subjecting qualified handicapped persons to discrimination on the basis of handicap, (ii) that \nhave the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the \nobjectives of the recipient’s program or activity with respect to handicapped persons.” 34 C.F.R. \n§ 104.4(b)(4). \n76.  In separating J.S.R. from his father and detaining son and parent thousands of \nmiles apart, the Defendants have exacerbated J.S.R.’s disabilities, interfered with his ability to \nmeaningfully participate in immigration proceedings, excluded him from the protections \nafforded by the asylum statutes, and discriminated against J.S.R. on the basis of his disability. \n77.  Defendants have a legal duty to provide reasonable accommodations to J.S.R. to \nensure his meaningful access to the federal program of asylum and removal proceedings. \n78.  J.S.R. has provided Defendants with notice of his disabilities and requested \nreasonable accommodations no later than service of this pleading. Defendants have not granted \nthese requests.  \n1 5\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 1   Filed 07/02/18   Page 17 of 21\n79.  There are effective reasonable accommodations that Defendants could implement. \nIn particular, Defendants could immediately cease the forced separation of J.S.R. from his father. \nDefendants have failed to implement any reasonable accommodations.    \n80.  The reasonable accommodation requested by J.S.R. would not be unduly \nburdensome nor would it require a fundamental alteration in the program. The burden of \nshowing that any such relief or accommodation would require a fundamental alteration or pose \nan undue burden rests with Defendants. 6 C.F.R. § 15.50(a)(2).  \n81.  By forcibly separating J.S.R. from his father, Defendants have denied J.S.R. equal \nand effective access to a federal program.  \n82.  As a result of this discrimination and failure to reasonably accommodate J.S.R.’s \ndisabilities, and solely based on his disability, J.S.R. cannot receive the benefits of the asylum \nprocess or the placement by Defendants in a children’s shelter in Connecticut. \nCOUNT IV \n(Violation of Administrative Procedure Act)  \n \n83.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set \nforth herein. \n84.  The Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) prohibits agency action that is \narbitrary and capricious. \n85.  The forcible separation of J.S.R. from his father and the decision to detain them \nthousands of miles from one another constitutes final agency action under the APA.  \n86.  Defendants’ separation of J.S.R. from his father without a legitimate justification \nis arbitrary and capricious and accordingly violates the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 706.  \n1 6\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 1   Filed 07/02/18   Page 18 of 21\n87.  ORR’s decision to apply its policies and procedures for “sponsoring” an \n“unaccompanied alien child” to the parents who were forcibly separated from their children by  \nthe U.S. government is also a final agency action for purposes of the APA.  \n88.  In light of ORR’s mission to “promptly place” minors into “the least restrictive \nsetting that is in the best interest of the child,” ORR’s insistence that J.S.R. remain detained and \nseparated from his father is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with the law. \nCOUNT V \n(Violation of Equal Protection Guarantee) \n \n89.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set \nforth herein. \n90.  The Fifth Amendment contains an implicit guarantee of equal protection that \ninvalidates any official action that in part reflects a racially discriminatory intent or purpose. \nClassifications based on race or national origin receive exacting scrutiny, and even facially \nneutral policies and practices will be held unconstitutional when they reflect a pattern \nunexplainable on grounds other than race or national origin. \n91.  Defendants’ decisions to separate families from Central and South America \narriving at the southern border seeking asylum, and to isolate children in detention facilities \nseparate from their parents, are unconstitutional because they were motivated, at least in part, by \nintentional discrimination based on race, ethnicity, and/or national origin. This intentional \ndiscrimination includes bias against immigrants perceived to come from Central or South \nAmerican countries. \n92.  As a result of these decisions, including the decisions that have caused the \nseparation of J.S.R. from his father, J.S.R. has been and is being denied equal protection. \n1 7\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 1   Filed 07/02/18   Page 19 of 21\nCOUNT VI \n(Declaratory Judgment Act) \n \n93.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set \nforth herein. \n94.  The Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202, provides that “[i]n a \ncase of actual controversy within its jurisdiction . . . any court of the United States . . . may \ndeclare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration, \nwhether or not further relief is or could be sought.” 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a). \n95.  There is an actual controversy between the parties because Defendants have \nrefused to immediately release J.S.R. The Court should exercise its authority under the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act to declare that Defendants have no basis to refuse to release J.S.R. and \nto order Defendants to immediately release J.S.R., into the custody of his father or another \nsuitable relative as directed by J.S.G. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEEFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court enter a judgment against \nDefendants and award the following relief: \n  A.   Declare that Defendants have no basis to hold or maintain custody over J.S.R.; \n  B.   Declare that Defendants’ failure to reasonably accommodate J.S.R.’s disabilities, \nor their failure to provide J.S.R. equal and effective access to a federal program, violates Section \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; \n  C.  Declare that Defendants must immediately release J.S.R. into the custody of his \nfather, or to such other suitable adult as J.S.G. may direct; \n  D.

Forty-six days ago, the United States government forcibly separated Plaintiff \nV.F.B., a 14-year-old girl, from her mother, as part of an abhorrent and illegal scheme to deter \nasylum-seekers from seeking protection from persecution in the United States. On the pretext of \ntaking her to bathe, government officials lured V.F.B. away from her mother at a detention \nfacility in Texas and transferred her to a shelter in Connecticut, thousands of miles from her \nmother.   \n2.  V.F.B. was held incommunicado from her mother for over a month and remains \nphysically separated from her to this day.  The forced separation of V.F.B. from her mother was \ntraumatic, and the ongoing separation continues to cause V.F.B. anguish and fear, and threatens \neven greater long-term mental, emotional, and physical harm. \n3.  V.F.B. and her mother arrived in the United States in May 2018 after fleeing \npersecution in El Salvador.  They arrived in the United States soon after Defendants announced \nimplementation of their “zero tolerance policy,” which subjects asylum seekers to prosecution \nfor unlawful entry and forcibly separates parents from children, for the express purpose of \ndeterring asylum seekers from coming to the United States.  \n4.  V.F.B.’s mother is her primary caregiver, her source of comfort and protection, \nand the most important person in her life.  There is no basis to believe that V.F.B. has ever been \nsubjected to abuse or neglect by her mother, and there is no lawful or proper basis for Defendants \nto separate them. \n5.  Upon information and belief, Defendants have taken no steps to reunite V.F.B. \nand her mother, despite the President’s purported disavowal of family separation.  As a result, \nthe initial trauma of government agents secreting a 14-year-old child away from her mother has \n1  \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01110-VAB   Document 1   Filed 07/02/18   Page 3 of 21\nbeen compounded by their indefinite separation and prolonged detention.  This has unnecessarily \ninflicted, and continues to unnecessarily inflict, additional emotional harm on V.F.B. while \nfrustrating her ability to pursue her legal claims, including asylum and the present action, without \nthe opportunity for meaningful communication with her mother. \n6.  The government’s continued detention of V.F.B., and its continued, forcible \nseparation of V.S.B. from her mother, is unlawful, and it subjects V.F.B. to ongoing harm that \ncannot be remediated without releasing her from detention and reuniting mother and child. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1346, 2201-2202, \n2241, and Article I, clause 9 § 2 and Article III of the U.S. Constitution. \n8.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C § 1391 because Plaintiff V.F.B. is currently in \ncustody of Defendants in Mystic, Connecticut and a substantial part of the events or omissions \ngiving rise to the claims made herein occurred or are occurring in Connecticut.  \nPARTIES \n9.  Plaintiff V.F.B. is a 14-year old national of El Salvador.  She has been in the \ncustody of the federal government for approximately 46 days. V.F.B. brings this lawsuit through \na next friend as a result of her incapacity due to her minor status, her trauma-related disability, \nher limited access to the courts while detained, her unfamiliarity with U.S. law, and her inability \nto seek advice and counsel from the most important person in her life – her mother – as a result \nof the government’s actions.  \n10.  Joshua Perry is Deputy Director of Connecticut Legal Services (CLS), a non-\nprofit law firm that is dedicated to improving the lives of low-income people, including children \nand immigrants, by providing access to justice. CLS has established an attorney-client \n2  \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01110-VAB   Document 1   Filed 07/02/18   Page 4 of 21\nrelationship with V.F.B. to assist her in obtaining relief from removal from the United States. \nMr. Perry brings this suit as next friend and on behalf of V.F.B. in order to protect V.F.B.’s \nrights and out of dedication to V.F.B.’s expressed interest in reuniting with her mother.  \n11.  Defendant Jefferson B. Sessions III is the Attorney General of the United States \nand is sued in his official capacity. He has responsibility for the administration of the \nimmigration laws pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1103, oversees the Executive Office of Immigration \nReview, and is empowered to grant relief from removal.  \n12.  Defendant U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has responsibility for \nenforcing the immigration laws of the United States. \n13.  Defendant Kirstjen Nielsen is the Secretary of DHS and is sued in her official \ncapacity. She directs each of the component agencies within DHS, including CBP, ICE, and \nUSCIS. Defendant Nielsen is responsible for implementing U.S. immigration laws and policies, \nincluding policies related to family separation and family detention at the U.S. southern border. \n14.  Defendant U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) is the sub-agency of \nDHS that is responsible for enforcement operations along the borders of the United States, \nincluding the southern border. \n15.  Defendant Kevin K. McAleenan is the Commissioner of CBP and is sued in his \nofficial capacity. He oversees the apprehension and detention of individuals, including asylum \nseekers, who enter the United States at or near the U.S. border. \n16.  Defendant U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) is the sub-agency \nof DHS that is responsible for the detention and removal operations of DHS. \n17.  Defendant Ronald D. Vitiello is the Acting Director of ICE and is sued in his \nofficial capacity. He directs the nation’s immigration detention system and oversees the removal \n3  \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01110-VAB   Document 1   Filed 07/02/18   Page 5 of 21\nof families ordered deported at ICE detention facilities. Defendant Vitiello plays a critical role in \nsetting detention policies that affect asylum seekers who are held in detention while they await \nthe first steps of the asylum process. \n18.  Defendant U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) is the sub-\nagency of DHS that, through its asylum officers, conducts interviews of certain individuals \napprehended at or near the border to determine whether they have a credible fear of persecution \nand must be permitted to apply for asylum.   \n19.  Defendant L. Francis Cissna is the Director of USCIS and is sued in his official \ncapacity.  \n20.  Defendant U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) is a \ndepartment of the executive branch that is responsible for “unaccompanied” non-citizen minor \nchildren. \n21.  Defendant Alex Azar is the Secretary of HHS and is sued in his official capacity.  \n22.  Defendant Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”) is the component of HHS \nthat provides placement and care for “unaccompanied” non-citizen minor children and holds \nlegal custody of V.F.B. \n23.  Defendant Scott Lloyd is the director of ORR and is sued in his official capacity. \nLEGAL AND FACTUAL FRAMEWORK OF FAMILY SEPARATION \nArriving Families’ Right to Seek Asylum \n24.  United States law entitles non-citizens on American soil to seek asylum, without \nregard to how they arrive. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1). Since 1996, immigration law has also provided \nauthority for “expedited removal,” or the removal of certain individuals from the United States \nwithout a removal hearing. Id. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i).  \n4  \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01110-VAB   Document 1   Filed 07/02/18   Page 6 of 21\n25.  Even an individual subject to expedited removal, however, must receive a \nremoval hearing if the person “indicates either an intention to apply for asylum . . . or a fear of \npersecution.” Id. Under such circumstances, an asylum officer evaluates whether the individual \nhas a “credible fear” of persecution in their home country. Id. U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii). If an \nasylum officer determines that there is a “significant possibility” that such an individual could \nprove eligibility for fear-based relief, id. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v), then the asylum seeker is placed \ninto regular removal proceedings. Id. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii).   \nThe Government’s Policies Before “Zero Tolerance” \n26.  Prior to implementing a systematic policy of family separation in 2018, the \ngovernment did not detain some families apprehended at the border at all, instead placing them \nin regular removal proceedings. For others, the government followed expedited removal \nprocedures, and detained members of these families together. If Defendants found these family \nmembers to have a credible fear of persecution, they would release the family from detention.  \n27.  When the government decides to detain children, it is subject to the Flores \nSettlement, which implements a “general policy favoring release” of minors. See Settlement \nAgreement, Flores v. Reno, No. CV-85-4544-RJK (C.D. Cal. Jan. 17, 1997), available at \nhttps://tinyurl.com/y9fxrbsp (hereinafter “Flores Settlement”). The Flores Settlement \n“unambiguously applies both to accompanied and unaccompanied minors” in DHS custody, \nFlores v. Lynch, 828 F.3d 898, 901 (9th Cir. 2016), and requires the government to “place each \ndetained minor in the least restrictive setting appropriate to the minor’s age and special \nneeds….” Flores Settlement ¶ 11.  \n28.  Under the settlement, children must be released from detention within five days, \nor within twenty days in certain emergency circumstances, to a parent, legal guardian, adult \n5  \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01110-VAB   Document 1   Filed 07/02/18   Page 7 of 21\nrelative, adult designated by a legal guardian, or (if none of these individuals are available) a \nlicensed program willing to accept legal custody. Id. ¶¶ 12, 14.  \n29.  Starting in January 2016, the government piloted the Family Case Management \nProgram (“FCMP”) as an “alternative to detention . . . initiative that use[d] qualified case \nmanagers to promote participant compliance with their immigration obligations” through a wrap-\naround service model. The ICE Office of Inspector General determined that the FCMP was 99 \npercent effective at ensuring participant attendance for ICE check-ins and appointments, and 100 \npercent effective at ensuring attendance for court hearings.

Nevertheless, the government closed the program in June 2017. \nThe Government’s “Zero Tolerance” Family Separation Policy \n30.  In early 2017, DHS contemplated changing its policy on asylum-seeking families \nby implementing family separation to deter migration from Central America into the United \nStates. In March 2017, then-DHS Secretary John Kelly stated that he was considering separating \narriving children from their parents “in order to deter more movement” into the United States. \nDaniella Diaz, Kelly: DHS Is Considering Separating Children From Their Parents At the \nBorder, CNN (Mar. 6, 2017), available at https://tinyurl.com/yctz5qct. \n31.  On May 7, 2018, Defendant Sessions announced a “zero tolerance policy” of \ncoercive family separation in order to deter asylum seekers and other migrants from crossing into \nthe United States. Defendant Sessions explained, “If you cross this border unlawfully, then we \nwill prosecute you. It’s that simple. . . . If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you \nand that child will be separated from you . . . .” Remarks Discussing the Immigration \n6  \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01110-VAB   Document 1   Filed 07/02/18   Page 8 of 21\nEnforcement Actions of the Trump Administration (May 7, 2018), available at \nhttps://tinyurl.com/ybqbfubb. \n32.  The government applied its “zero-tolerance policy” against parents who crossed \nthe border with their own children seeking asylum, including V.F.B. Defendants have forcibly \nseparated over 2,300 children from their parents while crossing the border, some only months \nold. Faith Karimi & Tal Kopan, There Are 2,300 Migrant Kids Spread Across the U.S. What \nHappens to Them Next?, CNN (June 21, 2018), available at https://tinyurl.com/ybjtxyz5. \n33.  Children forcibly separated from their parents were transferred to the custody of \nthe Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”), a component of HHS, and sent to shelters and \ntemporary housing. ORR deems these children as “unaccompanied minors.”  \n34.  Under ORR policies, a child will be released from ORR custody only after ORR \nundertakes an onerous and lengthy procedure to determine that a potential custodian, or \n“sponsor,” is suitable for providing for the child’s physical and mental well-being. Office of \nRefugee Resettlement, Children Entering the United States Unaccompanied, available at \nhttps://tinyurl.com/y9ccsgeo. \n35.  In the face of widespread public condemnation of coerced family separation as a \ngrave violation of American values, President Trump purportedly retracted the policy on June \n20, 2018. Exec. Order, Affording Congress an Opportunity to Address Family Separation, 2018 \nWL 3046068 (June 20, 2018) (hereinafter “EO”). The EO continued the policy of initiating \ncriminal proceedings for all individuals who crossed the border without authorization; however, \nin place of systematic separation of families, the EO called for indefinite detention of families in \ncamps and makeshift facilities. Id. \n \n7  \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01110-VAB   Document 1   Filed 07/02/18   Page 9 of 21\nThe Government’s Ongoing Failure to Reunify Families \n36.  The EO did not include any provisions to reunite families that had been separated \nat the border, nor did it purport to remediate the trauma or other harms caused by family \nseparation. \n37.  DHS has not disclosed any process for reunification of families prior to removal, \nincluding during the pendency of asylum claims, which may last for months. In litigation in the \nU.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, Defendants did not dispute that they \nhad “no plans or procedures to reunify the parent with the child other than arranging for them to \nbe deported together after the parent’s immigration case is concluded.” Ms. L. v. ICE, __ F. \nSupp. 3d __, 2018 WL 3129486, at *5 (S.D. Cal. June 26, 2018) (internal quotations omitted). \nThe court found that “under the present system migrant children are not accounted for with the \nsame efficiency and accuracy as property.” Id. at *7 (emphasis in original). \nThe Racial Animus Underlying Coerced Family Separation \n38.  The Trump Administration adopted its policy of coerced family separation as a \ncentral part of an anti-immigrant agenda, motivated primarily by racial animus against \nindividuals of Hispanic origin and individuals from Central America.  \n39.  On the first day of his presidential campaign, Candidate Trump stated: “When \nMexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. . . . They’re bringing drugs. They’re \nbringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” Donald Trump \nAnnounces a Presidential Bid, WASH. POST (June 16, 2015), available at \nhttps://tinyurl.com/gl6ofm5. \n40.  Since taking office, President Trump has consistently pursued immigration \npolicies motivated by racial animus against non-European immigrants. In summer 2017, he \n8  \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01110-VAB   Document 1   Filed 07/02/18   Page 10 of 21\nstated that the 15,000 Haitians admitted to the United States “all have AIDS,” and expressed \nconcern that Nigerian nationals in the United States would never “go back to their huts” in \nAfrica. Aaron Blake, Trump’s ‘shithole’ comment about Haiti lends credence to report he said \nHaitians ‘all have AIDS’, WASH. POST (Jan. 11, 2018), available at \nhttps://tinyurl.com/ybspu5qa.  \n41.  In January 2018, President Trump complained about protections for individuals \nfrom specific Central American and African countries, asking why the United States was \nadmitting “all these people from shithole countries,” as opposed to countries like Norway. Id. In \nMay 2018, President Trump characterized certain unauthorized migrants as “animals.” Jamelle \nBouie, The “Animal” Debate is Over, SLATE, June 19, 2018, https://tinyurl.com/yckbshah. The \nnext month, defending his coerced family separation policy, the President alleged that families \ncrossing the border with their children “could be murderers and thieves and so much else,” and \nwarned that “[t]he United States will not be a migrant camp. . . .” Id. \n42.  The Administration’s shifting race-neutral explanations for coerced family \nseparation are pretextual. President Trump falsely asserted that family separation was required \nunder an unnamed law, but he unilaterally ended the policy through an executive order two days \nlater. DHS Secretary Nielsen claimed that the policy was necessary due to arriving adults and \nchildren fraudulently claiming to be family units, but less than one percent of families \napprehended at the border made such fraudulent claims. Linda Qiu, Fact-Checking the Trump \nAdministration’s Case for Child Separation at the Border, N.Y. TIMES (June 19, 2018), \navailable at https://tinyurl.com/yddv5oef.

V.F.B. and her mother arrived in the United States in May 2018, after fleeing \npersecution in El Salvador. \n44.  V.F.B.’s mother is her primary caretaker and has been during V.F.B.’s entire life.  \nV.F.B. is emotionally close to her mother and relies upon her more than anyone else in her life.  \nV.F.B. does not have a relationship with her father or his family.   \n45.  V.F.B.’s step-father was killed in 2017 outside a church in El Salvador while she \nand her mother waited for him inside.  Because of the murder, V.F.B. and her family moved in \norder to avoid a similar fate. Eventually V.F.B. and her mother fled El Salvador in order to save \ntheir lives and avoid official persecution. \n46.  Upon information and belief, V.F.B and her mother were detained in Texas by \nCBP officials soon after they arrived in the United States. \n47.  Upon information and belief, V.F.B. and her mother both expressed to CBP \nofficials a fear of returning to El Salvador. \n48.  Defendants initially detained V.F.B. and her mother together, first at a detention \nfacility that V.F.B. knows as the “hielera,” or “freezer” in Spanish, at a CBP facility in Texas. \nUpon information and belief, V.F.B. and her mother were in CPB custody at the time that they \nwere forcibly separated.   \n49.  During the time that V.F.B. and her mother were in government custody in Texas, \ngovernment agents took V.F.B. away from her mother to bathe.  Although she expected to see \nher mother after showering, she never did.  That was the last time that V.F.B. saw her mother. \n1 0 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01110-VAB   Document 1   Filed 07/02/18   Page 12 of 21\n50.  Over the course of two days, V.F.B. asked government agents multiple times \nabout the whereabouts of her mother.  Each time, officers told V.F.B. that they would go and \nlook for her mother in a room used to hold adults, and each time they subsequently told V.F.B. \nthat her mother was not there.  Eventually, government agents told V.F.B. that her mother was \ndetained. \n51.   On or about May 17, 2018, ORR placed V.F.B. with Noank Community Support \nServices, Inc., a non-profit agency based in Groton, Connecticut that contracts to house children \nin custody of the federal government. Noank Community Support Services receives federal \nfunding as a result of its contract with ORR, but does not offer legal representation. V.F.B. has \nbeen held in ORR custody at Noank Community Support Services since on or about May 17.  \nShe arrived in Connecticut after taking two planes and a car.   \n52.  V.F.B. was allowed to speak to her mother by telephone for the first time on or \nabout June 25, 2018, approximately 39 days after they were forcibly separated.  The call lasted \napproximately ten minutes, and shelter staff were in the room during that time.  V.F.B. and her \nmother were so distraught that they cried for nearly the entire call and as a result were unable to \nmore meaningfully communicate with one another.  V.F.B. does not know when she will next be \nallowed to speak with her mother. \n53.  Defendants’ actions in separating V.F.B. from her mother, together with \nDefendants’ other actions and failures to act, caused significant and immediate mental and \nemotion harm to V.F.B. and threaten even greater long-term harm.   \n54.  On information and belief, V.F.B. has been exposed to significant traumatic \nevents in her young life, including the murder of her step-father.  In the face of this trauma, her \nmother has been her primary caregiver and source of protection and strength.  To an even greater \n1 1 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01110-VAB   Document 1   Filed 07/02/18   Page 13 of 21\nextent than other children her age, V.F.B. relies on the love and support of her mother to help her \nsurvive a terrifying world. \n55.  V.F.B. manifests numerous symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), \nand on information and belief, suffers from chronic PTSD. Defendants’ actions, including taking \nher away from her mother under pretense of bathing, and then separating her halfway across the \ncountry, are exacerbating V.F.B.’s PTSD.  Having already lost one caregiver—her step-father— \nV.F.B. is at risk of severe retraumatization by virtue of the government’s forcible separation of \nher from her mother. V.F.B. has trouble concentrating and thinking, as a result of her disability, \nwhich is amplified by Defendants’ actions.  \n56.  V.F.B. has been distraught as a result of the government’s forcible separation of \nher from her mother.  She has cried on a regular basis following the separation and is concerned \nfor her safety and that of her mother.  Upon information and belief, V.F.B. has suffered, and \ncontinues to suffer, significant psychological harm as a result of the government’s forcible \nseparation of her from her mother. \n57.  Defendants’ actions are not only causing short-term trauma but also threaten \nsignificant long-term damage to V.F.B.  Childhood trauma and enforced separation from loved \nones carries a dramatically increased risk of long-term psychiatric illness, including major \ndepressive disorder, and anxiety disorders. Children who have suffered from trauma are also at \nsignificantly increased risk of physical illness. \n58.  V.F.B.’s mother is currently detained by ICE at the Lasalle County Regional \nDetention Center in Encinal, Texas. \n59.  Upon information and belief, V.F.B.’s mother is not represented by counsel. \n1 2 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01110-VAB   Document 1   Filed 07/02/18   Page 14 of 21\n60.  V.F.B.’s counsel, CLS, has made repeated attempts to contact V.F.B.’s mother, \nbut to date has been unable to do so.  Neither V.F.B. nor CLS have been able to discuss V.F.B.’s \nlegal claims, including those made in the present action, with V.F.B.’s mother. \n61.  The government does not have any legitimate interest in separating V.F.B. from \nher mother. There is no allegation that V.F.B.’s mother is an unfit parent.  \n62.  V.F.B. has expressed to CLS her desire to be reunited with her mother and her \nfear if returned to El Salvador.  \n63.  On information and belief, V.F.B. has no relatives in Connecticut. V.F.B. does not \nknow whether Defendants will reunite her with her mother or when she can see her mother next.  \nDuring the one phone call she has been permitted with her mother, V.F.B. was unable to discuss \nher legal rights, including the issues presented in the present action. \n64.  V.F.B. requests an order that Defendants immediately release her into the custody \nof her mother, or to such other suitable adult as her mother may direct. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n  \nCOUNT I  \n(Violation of Substantive Due Process) \n \n65.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set \nforth herein.  \n66.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment applies to all “persons” on \nUnited States soil and thus applies to V.F.B.  \n67.  V.F.B. has a liberty interest under the Due Process Clause in remaining together \nwith her mother as a family.  \n68.  The separation of V.F.B. from her mother violates substantive due process \nbecause it furthers no legitimate purpose, much less a compelling governmental interest.  \n1 3 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01110-VAB   Document 1   Filed 07/02/18   Page 15 of 21\nCOUNT II \n (Violation of Procedural Due Process) \n \n69.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set \nforth herein.  \n70.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment applies to all “persons” on \nUnited States soil and thus applies to V.F.B.  \n71.  V.F.B. has a liberty interest under the Due Process Clause in remaining together \nwith her mother as a family.  \n72.  The separation of V.F.B. from her mother violates procedural due process because \nit deprived V.F.B. of her protected liberty interest without notice or any opportunity to be heard. \nCOUNT III \n(Violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act) \n \n73.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set \nforth herein. \n74.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Section 504”) provides that “no \notherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of his or her disability, \nbe excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination \nunder any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.” 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n75.  Disability is defined to include “a physical or mental impairment that \nsubstantially limits one or more major life activities . . .” 29 U.S.C. § 705(20)(B); 42 U.S.C. § \n12102. \n76.  V.F.B. suffers from the effects of chronic trauma and acute PTSD. The effects of \nchronic trauma cause an impairment that limits V.F.B.’s ability to concentrate, think, and \ncommunicate. V.F.B. thus has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or \nmore major life activities. \n1 4 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01110-VAB   Document 1   Filed 07/02/18   Page 16 of 21\n77.  Defendants’ separation of V.F.B. from her mother and decision to detain her \nmother thousands of miles away exacerbate V.F.B.’s existing limitations in communication, \nincluding when relating her past trauma. As a result, V.F.B. faces barriers in presenting her \nclaims and is being denied equal and equally effective access to the asylum process on the basis \nof disability.  \n78.  V.F.B. is “otherwise qualified” to participate in any removal proceedings \ncurrently pending against her and in affirmative asylum proceedings, as well as in the programs \nand activities of her temporary placement by ORR in a children’s shelter.   \n79.  The children’s shelter at which V.F.B. is currently detained by ORR has received \nsubstantial federal financial assistance. Immigration proceedings, including asylum adjudications \nbefore USCIS and removal proceedings prosecuted by ICE before an Immigration Judge, are \nfederal programs. \n80.  The regulations implementing Section 504 prohibit entities receiving federal \nfinancial assistance from utilizing “criteria or methods of administration (i) that have the effect \nof subjecting qualified handicapped persons to discrimination on the basis of handicap, (ii) that \nhave the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the \nobjectives of the recipient’s program or activity with respect to handicapped persons.” 34 C.F.R. \n§ 104.4(b)(4). \n81.  In separating V.F.B. from her mother and detaining daughter and parent \nthousands of miles apart, the Defendants have exacerbated V.F.B.’s disabilities, interfered with \nher ability to meaningfully participate in immigration proceedings, excluded her from the \nprotections afforded by the asylum statutes, and discriminated against V.F.B. on the basis of her \ndisability. \n1 5 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01110-VAB   Document 1   Filed 07/02/18   Page 17 of 21\n82.  Defendants have a legal duty to provide reasonable accommodations to V.F.B. to \nensure her meaningful access to the federal program of asylum and removal proceedings. \n83.  V.F.B. has provided Defendants with notice of her disabilities and requested \nreasonable accommodations no later than service of this pleading. Defendants have not granted \nthese requests.  \n84.  There are effective reasonable accommodations that Defendants could implement. \nIn particular, Defendants could immediately cease the forced separation of V.F.B. from her \nmother. Defendants have failed to implement any reasonable accommodations.    \n85.  The reasonable accommodation requested by V.F.B. would not be unduly \nburdensome nor would it require a fundamental alteration in the program. The burden of \nshowing that any such relief or accommodation would require a fundamental alteration or pose \nan undue burden rests with Defendants. 6 C.F.R. § 15.50(a)(2).  \n86.  By forcibly separating V.F.B. from her mother, Defendants have denied V.F.B. \nequal and effective access to a federal program.  \n87.  As a result of this discrimination and failure to reasonably accommodate V.F.B.’s \ndisabilities, and solely based on her disability, V.F.B. cannot receive the benefits of the asylum \nprocess or the placement by Defendants in a children’s shelter in Connecticut. \nCOUNT IV \n(Violation of Administrative Procedure Act)  \n \n88.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set \nforth herein. \n89.  The Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) prohibits agency action that is \narbitrary and capricious. \n1 6 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01110-VAB   Document 1   Filed 07/02/18   Page 18 of 21\n90.  The forcible separation of V.F.B. from her mother and the decision to detain them \nthousands of miles from one another constitutes final agency action under the APA.  \n91.  Defendants’ separation of V.F.B. from her mother without a legitimate \njustification is arbitrary and capricious and accordingly violates the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 706.  \n92.  ORR’s decision to apply its policies and procedures for “sponsoring” an \n“unaccompanied alien child” to the parents who were forcibly separated from their children by \nthe U.S. government is also a final agency action for purposes of the APA.  \n93.  In light of ORR’s mission to “promptly place” minors into “the least restrictive \nsetting that is in the best interest of the child,” ORR’s insistence that V.F.B. remain detained and \nseparated from her mother is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with the law. \nCOUNT V \n(Violation of Equal Protection Guarantee) \n \n94.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set \nforth herein. \n95.  The Fifth Amendment contains an implicit guarantee of equal protection that \ninvalidates any official action that in part reflects a racially discriminatory intent or purpose. \nClassifications based on race or national origin receive exacting scrutiny, and even facially \nneutral policies and practices will be held unconstitutional when they reflect a pattern \nunexplainable on grounds other than race or national origin. \n96.  Defendants’ decisions to separate families from Central and South America \narriving at the southern border seeking asylum, and to isolate children in detention facilities \nseparate from their parents, are unconstitutional because they were motivated, at least in part, by \nintentional discrimination based on race, ethnicity, and/or national origin. This intentional \n1 7 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01110-VAB   Document 1   Filed 07/02/18   Page 19 of 21\ndiscrimination includes bias against immigrants perceived to come from Central or South \nAmerican countries. \n97.  As a result of these decisions, including the decisions that have caused the \nseparation of V.F.B. from her mother, V.F.B. has been and is being denied equal protection. \nCOUNT VI \n(Declaratory Judgment Act) \n \n98.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set \nforth herein. \n99.  The Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202, provides that “[i]n a \ncase of actual controversy within its jurisdiction . . . any court of the United States . . . may \ndeclare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration, \nwhether or not further relief is or could be sought.” 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a). \n100.  There is an actual controversy between the parties because Defendants have \nrefused to immediately release V.F.B. The Court should exercise its authority under the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act to declare that Defendants have no basis to refuse to release V.F.B. \nand to order Defendants to immediately release V.F.B., into the custody of her mother or another \nsuitable relative as directed by her mother. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEEFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court enter a judgment against \nDefendants and award the following relief: \n  A.   Declare that Defendants have no basis to hold or maintain custody over V.F.B.; \n  B.   Declare that Defendants’ failure to reasonably accommodate V.F.B.’s disabilities, \nor their failure to provide V.F.B. equal and effective access to a federal program, violates Section \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; \n1 8 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01110-VAB   Document 1   Filed 07/02/18   Page 20 of 21\n  C.  Declare that Defendants must immediately release V.F.B. into the custody of her \nmother, or to such other suitable adult as her mother may direct; \n  D.  Order Defendants to produce the mother of V.F.B. in the District of Connecticut, \non a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum or otherwise, so that she may visit in person with her \ndaughter V.F.B. so as to advise this Court whether V.F.B.’s mother requests her daughter’s \nimmediate release to another suitable relative or continued detention, together with her mother, \nfor as long as Defendants detain them both; \n  E.   Preliminarily and permanently enjoin Defendants from continuing to separate \nV.F.B. from her mother and from refusing to release V.F.B. into the custody of her mother, or to \nsuch other suitable adult as V.F.B.’s mother may direct; \n  F.    Grant a writ of Habeas Corpus requiring Defendants to release V.F.B. \nimmediately to the custody of her mother or such other suitable relative as her mother may \ndirect, or issue an order directing the Defendants to show cause within three days why the writ \nshould not be granted, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2243; \n  G.   Require Defendants to pay Plaintiff’s reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs; and \n  H.   Grant all other relief that is just and proper. \n \nDated: July 2, 2018 \nNew Haven, Connecticut \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ Muneer I.

SESSIONS, III, Attorney  : \nGeneral of the United States, et al    : \n \n \nNOTICE OF COMPLIANCE \n \n  On July 11, 2018, the Court conducted a hearing on Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary \nRestraining Order or Preliminary Injunction seeking reunification with their parents by July 13, \n2018.  During the hearing, the Defendants advised the Court that the Plaintiffs’ parents are class \nmembers in a court case in California, Ms. L., et al v. ICE, et al, Case No. 18-cv-0428 (S.D. Cal.), \nand are beneficiaries of the preliminary injunction order issued in that case which requires \nreunification of those Plaintiffs with their children by July 26, 2018.  On July 13, 2018, the Court \nissued a ruling declining to interfere with the Order issued by the Ms. L Court and allowing the \nDefendants up to July 26, 2018, to reunite the Plaintiffs with their parents. \n  During the hearing on July 11, 2018, the United States Attorney’s Office advised the Court \nthat it had submitted a formal request that Plaintiffs’ reunification with their parents be expedited.  \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 63   Filed 07/16/18   Page 2 of 3\nThe Defendants also advised the Court that they would give the Court and Plaintiffs’ counsel notice \nif they learned that the reunification was to occur prior to July 26, 2018.  The Defendants hereby \nnotify the Court that the request of the United States Attorney’s Office has been acted upon, and \nPlaintiffs will be reunited with their parents today, July 16, 2018. \n  Additionally, although Plaintiffs’ parents are subject to mandatory detention and are \nsubject to administratively final orders of removal, the United States Department of Homeland \nSecurity, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, (“ICE”), has considered Plaintiffs request to \nparole their parents from custody.  At this stage, Plaintiffs’ parents can only be released from \ndetention through a solely discretionary grant of parole under narrowly prescribed circumstances, \nsuch  as  a  present  “urgent  humanitarian  reason  or  significant  public  benefit.”    8  U.S.C.  § \n1182(b)(5); 8 C.F.R. § 212.5(b).  Having considered all the factors presented in this case, ICE will \nbe granting Plaintiffs’ parents’ request for parole from custody under the terms and conditions set \nforth by ICE at the time of parole.  Plaintiffs’ parents parole from custody will also take place on \nJuly 16, 2018. \n                Respectfully submitted, \n              John H.

Signed by\nJudge Victor A. Bolden on 7/9/2018. (McDonough, S.) (Entered: 07/09/2018)\n07/09/2018 35  ORDER granting 33 Motion to Consolidate Cases. Plaintiff in V.F.B. v. Sessions, No.\n3:18−cv−1110 has moved orally to consolidate that case with J.S.R. v. Sessions, No.\n3:18−cv−1106. There is no objection. The Court finds that these two cases involve\n\"common question[s] of law or fact,\" see Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(a), relating to the same\ngovernment policy of separating minor children from their asylum−seeking or migrant\nparents, as reflected in Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order or\nPreliminary Injunction and the supporting memorandum of law. ECF No. 17. The\nCourt therefore grants the motion to consolidate the cases. See R.W. Grand Lodge of\nFree & Accepted Masons of Pennsylvania v. Meridian Capital Partners, Inc., 634 Fed.\nApp'x 4, 6 (2d Cir. 2015) (\"A party moving for consolidation 'must bear the burden of\nshowing the commonality of factual and legal issues in different actions, and a district\ncourt must examine the special underlying facts with close attention before ordering a\nconsolidation.'\")(quoting In re Repetitive Stress Injury Litig., 11 F.3d 368, 373 (2d Cir.\n1993)). The new caption will be J.S.R. and V.F.B. v. Sessions, No. 3:18−cv−1106.\nThe Court will also consolidate the two hearings currently scheduled for Wednesday,\nJuly 11, 2018. The Court will hear argument in the consolidated case, No.\n3:18−cv−1106, at 11:30 a.m. on July 11, 2018. To the extent that the parties believe\nthat consolidation requires modification of the Court's Order granting in part and\ndenying in part the motion for writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum, the parties\nshould submit a request to modify that Order as needed.

At the July 11th preliminary\ninjunction hearing, Mr. Perry's status as \"next friend\" to Plaintiffs should be more fully\naddressed. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(c)(2) (\"A minor or an incompetent person who does\nnot have a duly appointed representative may sue by a next friend or by a guardian ad\nlitem. The court must appoint a guardian ad litem−−or issue another appropriate\norder−−to protect a minor or incompetent person who is unrepresented in an action.\").\nSigned by Judge Victor A.

The Court held a hearing on July \n11, 2018. ECF No. 52. \n  For the following reasons, the motion for a preliminary injunction is GRANTED IN \nPART AND DENIED IN PART.   \nRecognizing, as all parties have, that the constitutional rights of J.S.R. and V.F.B. have \nbeen violated, and that irreparable harm has occurred as a result, the motion for a preliminary \ninjunction is GRANTED and relief directed towards the effects of the constitutional violation \nsuffered by these minor children, namely trauma or more precisely, Post-Traumatic Stress \nDisorder (“PTSD”), shall be provided.  \nAt the upcoming hearing on Wednesday, July 18, 2018 at 11:00 a.m., each party shall \npresent a plan for addressing the children’s PTSD not only up to and including family \nreunification, but also after it. Their respective parents, J.S.G. and A.B.A., are ordered to be at \nthis hearing and the Court therefore will issue writs of habeas corpus ad testificandum to ensure \ntheir availability for testimony, to the extent warranted. \nTo the extent that J.S.R. and V.F.B. seek immediate reunification with their respective \nparents, the motion for a preliminary injunction is DENIED. As further discussed below, such \nrelief is being addressed by another court. Indeed, these parents are class members and therefore \nparties in that other case and any such relief should be obtained in and through that proceeding.   \nI.  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n  A.  Facts2 \n  Dr. Andrés Martin, M.D., M.P.H., a child psychiatrist with “more than twenty years of \nexperience interviewing, assessing, and treating vulnerable children, including survivors of \n                                                            \n2 The facts are based on the parties’ written submissions, as well as testimony and oral argument at the July 11th \npreliminary injunction hearing.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 57   Filed 07/13/18   Page 3 of 23\n  \ntrauma,” testified before the Court on July 11th. See Decl. of Andrés Martin (“Martin Decl.”), \nMot. for TRO, ECF No. 17-5 (listing numerous credentials and publications). Dr. Martin, a \nprofessor of child psychiatry at the Child Study Center at Yale University School of Medicine, is \nalso the Medical Director of the children’s Psychiatric Inpatient Service at Yale-New Haven \nChildren’s Hospital, a sixteen-bed in-patient unit for children under age fourteen with serious \npsychopathology. The Court found him to be qualified as an expert in child psychiatry.  \n  Dr. Martin and a team of child psychologists interviewed J.S.R. and V.F.B. in Spanish on \nJuly 1, 2018. Using two standardized instruments, they diagnosed both children with post-\ntraumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”). The following facts are based on Dr. Martin’s testimony and \nother information submitted by the parties. No other witnesses were called at the hearing, \nalthough the Court considered the various affidavits and other documents submitted by the \nparties. \n    1.  J.S.R. \n  Dr. Martin testified that J.S.R., a nine-year-old boy, fled with his father from Honduras \nafter his grandparents were murdered and the body of a family friend was left in his backyard. \nWhile in Honduras, J.S.R. had witnessed gang violence, including witnessing his grandmother \ndead, with her body tossed in a river and her neck split open. He also saw the dead body of \nsomeone he knew from his neighborhood dropped in his backyard. That second murder was \nblamed on his father by gang members who had made repeated threats to his father. Dr. Martin \nreported that, as far as J.S.R. knew, his father was being framed for the murder.  \nJ.S.R. has a strong and loving bond and relationship with his father, whom J.S.R. \nidentifies as the key protector and role model in his life. While the two were traveling, his father \nwould find work so that he could bring home food for J.S.R., and J.S.R. reported to Dr. Martin \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 57   Filed 07/13/18   Page 4 of 23\n  \nthat there would be times when his father did not eat so that J.S.R. could eat. Dr. Martin \nexplained that the trip from Honduras to Texas was not itself a particularly traumatic event for \nJ.S.R.; it was long, arduous, hot, and there was hunger, but it was not itself traumatic.  \nJ.S.R. and his father arrived in Hidalgo, Texas, and were confined in freezing \nconditions—J.S.R. described being held in an “ice box” or “freezer”—and were eventually \ntransferred to an immigration detention center. J.S.R. described to Dr. Martin being puzzled and \nsurprised by the last time that he saw his father. He explained being told that his father was going \nto sign some paperwork and that he would be right back, but he never returned. \nAccording to Dr. Martin’s testimony, J.S.R. experienced being kept in a windowless cage \nwith other young children for approximately four days while he was being transferred to the \ncustody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”). He is now with Noank Community \nSupport Services, Inc. (“Noank”), in Groton, Connecticut. His father is now located at a \ndetention center in Texas. Before the filing of this lawsuit, J.S.R. had spoken with his father two \ntimes over the three weeks at Noank.  \nDr. Martin reported that J.S.R. does not sleep well, does not trust adults, and is depressed \nand tearful. He is terrified of the prospect of returning to Honduras, because of his fear of gang \nviolence there and the harm that could befall his father or his family.  \nDr. Martin successfully employed two standardized instruments commonly used for a \ndiagnosis of PTSD with J.S.R. The first, the trauma health questionnaire (“THQ”), is a list of a \nwide array of potentially traumatic events. J.S.R. scored 14 out of a total of 23 points on that \nscale. The second, the childhood post-traumatic stress symptom scale, quantifies the symptoms \nof PTSD and has a maximum score of 51, with a score of 15 or higher qualifying a child for a \ndiagnosis of PTSD. According to Dr. Martin, J.S.R. scored 38, which Dr. Martin described as an \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 57   Filed 07/13/18   Page 5 of 23\n  \nextraordinarily high score. Dr. Martin testified that J.S.R. has a full-blown acute PTSD \nsymptomatology, on top of a chronic, traumatic background, resulting in a more pronounced \ntrauma.  \n    2.   V.F.B. \n  According to Dr. Martin, V.F.B., a fourteen-year-old girl, fled with her mother from El \nSalvador after her step-father was killed by a gang. They entered the United States mid-May \n2018, and reportedly were held in freezing conditions near the border while they awaited \nremoval proceedings. \n  Dr. Martin observed that V.F.B. has a close-knit relationship with her mother. She has \nlearned crafting skills from her mother, and they have survived together through the murder of \nV.F.B.’s step-father and an arduous trek from El Salvador to Texas. Dr. Martin explained that, \nlike J.S.R.’s journey, V.F.B.’s trip itself was not especially traumatic; the separation from her \nmother, however, did result in considerable trauma.  \nOne day at the detention center, V.F.B. went to take a shower. When she returned, her \nmother was gone.  \n  On May 16, 2018, the Government transferred V.F.B. to ORR custody and detained her \nin Noank. Her mother is in a detention center in Texas. During the six weeks preceding this \nlitigation, V.F.B. had spoken with her mother once. She has since had more contact.  \n  On July 1, 2018, Dr. Martin’s team interviewed V.F.B. and found her affect to be blunt \nand flat. Uncomfortable talking about the material, she would hide her face behind her arm or \nshy away from the interviewer. During the interview, she cried often.  \n  The team attempted to apply the same two standardized instruments with V.F.B. On the \nchildhood post-traumatic stress symptom scale, V.F.B. scored 21 out of 51.  A score of 15 or \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 57   Filed 07/13/18   Page 6 of 23\n  \nabove is considered consistent with PTSD. The team had more difficulty using the trauma health \nquestionnaire because V.F.B. had difficulty answering many questions and often avoided them. \nDr. Martin considered her so distressed that she did not understand certain simple concepts and \ntherefore could not answer the questions coherently.  \nDr. Martin expressed grave concern for the children if they are not reunited with their \nfamilies, and he testified that there likely will be both short-term and long-term physical and \nmental health consequences for the children. He explained that symptoms of trauma, including \nsleeplessness, depression, anxiety, tearfulness, and hopelessness, will not remit on their own, and \nthat the children are at risk for mental health consequences, including higher rates of depression, \nanxiety, symptoms of PTSD, substance abuse disorders, and more. They are also at a higher risk \nof physical conditions, such as cardio-vascular disease, diabetes, and even cancer.  \nDr. Martin recommended that the most important remedy for both children would be to \ntake away the traumatic stressor, J.S.R.’s separation from his father and V.F.B.’s separation from \nher mother. Dr. Martin also recommended that they be reunified in a non-stressful environment, \nwhere they could have freedom of movement, space, safety, and access to schools. He also \nrecommended that the children have ongoing trauma-informed psychotherapy and care. He \nexpressed that the timing of the reunification mattered: that the children had already been \nseparated from their parents too long, and that every day adds to the gravity of their situation. \nB.  Procedural History \n  On July 2, 2018, J.S.R. and V.F.B. each filed Complaints and petitions for habeas corpus. \nCompl., ECF No. 1. Each plaintiff also filed a motion for a hearing. ECF No. 8. On July 3, 2018, \nthe Court granted the motion, ECF No. 9, and held a telephonic status conference. ECF No. 12. \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 57   Filed 07/13/18   Page 7 of 23\n  \nAfter the conference, the Court issued a scheduling order that set a briefing schedule and a date \nfor a hearing on an anticipated motion for a preliminary injunction. ECF No. 13.  \n  On July 5, 2018, J.S.R. and V.F.B. each filed a motion for a temporary restraining order \nor a preliminary injunction. ECF No. 17; ECF No. 43. That same day, J.S.R. and V.F.B. each \nfiled a motion for a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum, seeking to compel the Government to \nproduce J.S.R., V.F.B., and their parents at the July 11th hearing. ECF No. 18. \n  The Court granted in part and denied in part the motion for a writ of habeas corpus ad \ntestificandum. Order on Motion for Writ, ECF No. 27; Supplemental Order on Motion for Writ, \nECF No. 37. The Court denied the motion to command the in-person appearance of J.S.R.’s \nfather and V.F.B.’s mother on July 11th. Order on Motion for Writ at 2. The Court required, \nhowever, that the Government make appropriate accommodations to ensure that the parents \ncould speak with the children on July 9th and July 10th, and so that the parents could appear at the \nJuly 11th hearing through a videoconference. Id. at 2, 8. The Court also commanded the presence \nof J.S.R. and V.F.B. in person at the hearing. Supp. Order on Motion for Writ at 2. \n  The Court also noted that the Government is purportedly in the process of complying \nwith an Order from the Southern District of California, which, as relevant here, requires United \nStates Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“I.C.E.”) to, “[u]nless there is a determination \nthat the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child, or the parent affirmatively, knowingly, \nand voluntarily declines to be reunited with the child . . . reunify all Class Members [i.e., parents] \nwith their minor children age five (5) and over within thirty (30) days of the entry of this Order.” \nOrder on Motion for Writ at 3–4 (citing Ms. L. v. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \n(“I.C.E.”), No. 18CV0428 DMS (MDD), 2018 WL 3129486, at *1 (S.D. Cal. June 26, 2018) \n(the “California Order”)). The Order applies to the following class: “All adult parents who enter \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 57   Filed 07/13/18   Page 8 of 23\n  \nthe United States at or between designated ports of entry who (1) have been, are, or will be \ndetained in immigration custody by [the United States Department of Homeland Security \n(‘DHS’)] and (2) have a minor child who is or will be separated from them by DHS and detained \nin the [Office of Refugee Resettlement (‘ORR’)], ORR foster care, or DHS custody absent a \ndetermination that the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child.” Ms. L., 2018 WL \n3129466, at *3 n.5.  \n  The Court ordered the Government to facilitate communication between J.S.R., V.F.B., \ntheir counsel, and their parents, on Monday, July 9th, Tuesday, July 10th, and Wednesday, July \n11th. Order on Motion for Writ at 7. The Court also stated that, if it denied J.S.R.’s and V.F.B.’s \nmotions for preliminary injunctions, but the Government did not comply with the California \nOrder by July 26, 2018, the Court would hold another hearing on July 27, 2018, at 10:00 a.m., \nand a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum would issue and the Government would be required \nto make arrangements to transport J.S.R.’s father and V.F.B.’s mother to that hearing. Id. at 8.   \n  The Court held another telephonic status conference on July 9, 2018. ECF No. 32. \nPlaintiffs orally moved to consolidate the two cases, J.S.R. v. Sessions, No. 3:18-cv-1106, and \nV.F.B. v. Sessions, No. 3:18-cv-1110. ECF No. 33. The Court granted the motion and \nconsolidated the cases into J.S.R and V.F.B. v. Sessions, No. 3:18-cv-1106. ECF No. 35. \n  Plaintiffs also filed motions for J.S.R.’s father, J.S.G., and V.F.B.’s mother, A.B.A., \nrespectively, to appear as each child’s next friend. ECF Nos. 48, 49. \n  On July 11, 2018, the Court held a hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction. \nThe parents appeared through video teleconference, and the Court granted Plaintiffs’ motions to \nadd each parent, in addition to Joshua Perry, as each child’s next friend. ECF Nos. 53, 54.3   \n                                                            \n3 Before their parents were added as their next friends, the children were represented by and through their next \nfriend, Joshua Perry, who is the Deputy Director of Connecticut Legal Services. See ECF No. 18-4. On July 9, 2018, \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 57   Filed 07/13/18   Page 9 of 23\n  \nII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \n  The Second Circuit applies similar standards for temporary restraining orders and \npreliminary injunctions, “and district courts have assumed them to be the same.” See Foley v. \nState Elections Enforcement Comm’n, No. 3:10CV1091 (SRU) (D. Conn. July 16, 2010), 2010 \nWL 2836722, at *3 (quoting Allied Office Supplies, Inc. v. Lewandowski, 261 F. Supp. 107, 108 \nn.2 (D. Conn. 2005)). Preliminary injunctive relief is an extraordinary remedy and is never \nawarded as a matter of right. Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008).  \n“A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on \nthe merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the \nbalance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.” New York \nProgress and Prot. PAC v. Walsh, 733 F.3d 483, 486 (2d Cir. 2013) (quoting Winter, 555 U.S. at \n20); see also Jolly v. Coughlin, 76 F.3d 468, 473 (2d Cir. 1996) (“In most cases, a party seeking \nto obtain a preliminary injunction must establish that it will suffer irreparable harm in the \nabsence of an injunction and demonstrate either (1) ‘a likelihood of success on the merits’ or (2) \n‘sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation and a \n                                                            \nthe Court issued an Order requesting that Plaintiffs more fully address Mr. Perry’s status as the children’s next \nfriend. ECF No. 36; see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(c)(2) (providing that a minor “who does not have a duly appointed \nrepresentative may sue by a next friend or by a guardian ad litem”); Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 163–64 \n(1990) (explaining that burden is on “next friend” to establish “First . . . why the real party in interest cannot appear \non his own behalf to prosecute the action . . . . Second, the ‘next friend’ must be truly dedicated to the best interests \nof the person on whose behalf he seeks to litigate,” and that some courts also require the “next friend” to “have some \nsignificant relationship with the real party in interest.”).  \n  Plaintiffs moved to add J.S.R.’s father, J.S.G., and V.F.B.’s mother, A.B.A., as their next friends, and at the \nhearing, Plaintiffs explained that they intended to add the parents in addition to Joshua Perry. The Court granted the \nmotions, and with the additional presence of the children’s parents as next friends, the question of representation has \nbeen properly addressed. Cf. T.W. by Enk v. Brophy, 124 F.3d 893, 897 (7th Cir. 1997) (“[T]he next friend must be \nan appropriate alter ego for a plaintiff who is not able to litigate in his own right . . . ordinarily the eligible will be \nconfined to the plaintiff’s parents, older siblings (if there are no parents), or a conservator or other guardian, akin to \na trustee; that persons having only an ideological stake in the child’s case are never eligible; but that if a close \nrelative is unavailable and the child has no conflict-free general representative the court may appoint a personal \nfriend of the plaintiff or his family, a professional who has worked with the child, or, in desperate circumstances, a \nstranger whom the court finds to be especially suitable to represent the child’s interests in the litigation.”).     \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 57   Filed 07/13/18   Page 10 of 23\n  \nbalance of the hardships tipping decidedly’ in the movant’s favor.”) (quoting Waldman Publ’g \nCorp. v. Landoll, Inc., 43 F.3d 775, 779–80 (2d Cir. 1994)).  \nA court will presume that a movant has established irreparable harm in the absence of \ninjunctive relief if the movant’s claim involves the alleged deprivation of a constitutional right. \nSee Mitchell v. Cuomo, 748 F.2d 804, 806 (2d Cir. 1984) (“When an alleged deprivation of a \nconstitutional right is involved, most courts hold that no further showing of irreparable injury is \nnecessary.”) (quoting 11 C.

Newport Lorillard, No. 01 Civ. \n9587 (SAS), 2003 WL 169797, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 23, 2003).  \nIII.  THE PARTIES’ ARGUMENTS \n  A.  J.S.R. and V.F.B. \n  Plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction on the grounds that forcibly separating the \nchildren from their parents: (1) violates the children’s substantive and procedural Fifth \nAmendment due process rights; (2) denies the children’s equal access to the asylum program and \nconstitutes disability discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act; (3) violates the Administrative \nProcedure Act; (4) and deprives the children of equal protection under the laws. Mot. for TRO at \n10. Plaintiffs argue that, “[b]ecause the children are likely to succeed on the merits on these four \nclaims, and because the remaining applicable factors weigh in favor of Plaintiffs, this Court \nshould grant J.S.R. and V.F.B. a temporary restraining order or, in the alternative, preliminary \ninjunctive relief.” Id.   \n  First, Plaintiffs argue that J.S.R. and V.F.B., as persons in the United States, have been \ndeprived of their substantive due process rights under the Fifth Amendment of the United States \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 57   Filed 07/13/18   Page 11 of 23\n  \nConstitution. Mot. for TRO at 10–11. Plaintiffs argue that they have “a protected liberty interest \nin being reunited with their parents.” Id. at 11. Plaintiffs also argue that “the government lacks \nany legitimate, let alone compelling, interest in the separation of these children from their \nfamilies.” Id. at 11–12.  \nPlaintiffs argue that “[d]ue process forbids the government from separating parents and \ntheir children unless there is a case-specific determination that separation is in the best interests \nof the child—as, for instance, when the child is in danger or the parent is shown to be unfit.” Id. \nat 12. Plaintiffs argue that there has not been and could not be a case-specific determination that \nJ.S.R. and V.F.B. should have been separated from their parents, and that instead, the separation \nhas caused “significant and on-going trauma.” Id.  \nPlaintiffs also argue that they are likely to succeed on their claim that Defendants have \nviolated J.S.R. and V.F.B.’s procedural due process rights under the Fifth Amendment because \nthey were forcibly separated from their parents “without any—let alone the constitutionally-\nrequired—process that is due before families can be indefinitely split up.” Mot. for TRO at 13. \nPlaintiffs argue that procedural due process would have required a pre-deprivation hearing before \nthe Government could separate children from their parents, given “the enormous stakes of \nremoving a child from the care of their parents and placing them into the custody of the state.” \nId. at 14. Here, Plaintiffs argue, “Defendants failed to provide any process at all, before or after, \ntearing J.S.R. and V.F.B. from their parents.” Id. Plaintiffs argue that, “[a]t the very least, \nprocedural due process requires affected parties be given notice and a set of procedural \nopportunities to protect their liberty interests.” Id. \nPlaintiffs also argue that, by separating these children, who are currently suffering from \nPTSD, from their parents, the Government has “further limited the children’s ability to access . . \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 57   Filed 07/13/18   Page 12 of 23\n  \n. the most crucial support the children need at this moment—their parents—and thereby is \nunlawfully denying them equal access to a federal program.” Mot. for TRO at 15; see 29 U.S.C. \n§ 794(a). Plaintiffs argue that the children are suffering from trauma-related mental disabilities, \nboth as a result of their forced separations from their parents and also as a result of trauma they \nendured before entering the United States.  \nPlaintiffs argue that Defendants “are violating the Rehabilitation Act through their failure \nto provide J.S.R. and V.F.B. reasonable accommodations in the asylum, removal, and sponsor \nplacement processes.” Id. at 18. Plaintiffs argue that “Defendants have failed to implement \navailable and reasonable accommodations, such as reuniting the children with their parents and \nreleasing them from detention.” Id. Plaintiffs also argue that “Defendants intentionally are \npreventing the children from turning to their parents for counsel and assistance in coping with, \nprocessing, and speaking about the experiences of violence, persecution, and loss that contributes \nto their disability and form the basis for their asylum claims.” Id. at 19.  \nPlaintiffs also argue that Defendants’ actions violate the Administrative Procedure Act \n(“APA”) because Defendants have failed to give adequate reasons for their actions, and \nDefendants have instead arbitrarily and capriciously separated the children from their parents, \nsacrificing their “important and fundamental rights” without a legitimate reason for doing so. Id. \nat 19–21.  \nFinally, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants’ decision to separate the children from their \nparents was driven by animus against individuals of Latino ethnicity. Id. at 23. Plaintiffs argue \nthat “Defendants’ coerced family separation policy, while facially neutral, violates equal \nprotection for two reasons: (1) it was applied in a discriminatory fashion, and (2) it was \nmotivated by discriminatory animus and resulted in a discriminatory effect.” Id. at 24. Plaintiffs \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 57   Filed 07/13/18   Page 13 of 23\n  \nargue that the policy discriminated against people in the “Northern Triangle” of Central America, \nincluding Honduras and El Salvador, the countries from where J.S.R. and V.F.B. came, \nrespectively. Id. They also assert that “the consistently racialized statements of the president and \nhis top advisers demonstrate that their family separation policy was motivated by animus, and \nthe evidence shows that it resulted in a discriminatory effect.” Id. at 25. \nB.  The Government \n  Defendants object to Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. Defendants argue \nthat Plaintiffs’ lawsuits, which seek reunification by July 13, 2018, interfere with the \nGovernment’s ongoing effort to implement the relief ordered in Ms. L., 2018 WL 3129486. Opp. \nto Mot. for TRO at 25–26. Defendants argue that there is substantial overlap with Ms. L., and \nthat “[d]uplicative litigation is disfavored in the federal courts because of the risk of inconsistent \njudgments, as well as the waste of the parties’ and judicial resources.” Id. at 27. Defendants \nargue that they have “already undertaken extensive efforts towards compliance with the \npreliminary injunction order.” Id. at 29. \n  Defendants “do not dispute plaintiffs’ allegation that their separation from their parents \nwas, and remains, traumatic,” and instead argue that “Plaintiffs are receiving excellent care, both \nmedical and otherwise, in the most least restrictive environment available.” Id. at 30. Defendants \nrepresent that they are “willing to comply with any reasonable accommodation requests made on \nbehalf of the children,” but that they “have received no accommodation requests relating to \nproviding care to the Plaintiffs.” Id.  \nDefendants explain that Noank is licensed by the State of Connecticut to provide \nresidential care to children, and that it is “set up much like a group home and is located near the \nMystic River.” Id. at 31. Defendants state that it is staffed “with a teacher, medical coordinator, \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 57   Filed 07/13/18   Page 14 of 23\n  \nclinician, case manager, supervisor, director as well as 8 youth care workers,” that the children \nattend school, and that they “engage in a variety of recreational activities daily at local parks in \nthe community or at the local YMCA.” Id. Defendants assert that J.S.R. plays soccer and “is also \na great artist and is constantly surprising his therapists with pictures he has drawn.” Id. \nDefendants assert that V.F.B. is social with other teenage girls, does art projects, and plays \nbasketball. Id. Defendants assert that both children are in “excellent health,” neither takes \nmedication, and “the medical coordinator has not reported any concerns that the children have \nany mental health conditions which warrant psychiatric treatment or psychotropic medications.” \nId. Defendants represent that the children receive weekly individual counseling, semi-weekly \ngroup therapy, and that they frequently drop in to say hello to their therapist without an \nappointment. Id. at 32.  \nDefendants argue that, according to the “mental health clinician working directly with \nPlaintiffs, neither child has demonstrated severe emotional distress or physical reactions as a \nresult of being separated from their parents,” and that “[t]here are likewise no recent reports of \nnightmares, flashbacks, or depressed mood.” Id. at 33–34. Defendants argue that, “[w]hile the \nPlaintiffs at times are appropriately sad and tearful when they speak to their respective parents, \nand would, of course, like to be reunified with their parents or another relative as soon as \npossible, they are now adjusting well to life at Noank and have expressed some joy and \nhappiness in taking part in ordinary recreational activities provided for the children at the \nshelter.” Id. at 34.   \nFinally, Defendants represent that the Government is in the process of reuniting J.S.R. \nand V.F.B., and will continue to make efforts to comply with the California Order. Specifically, \none of V.L.B.’s aunts “submitted a sponsorship application yesterday, July 9, 2018,” but the \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 57   Filed 07/13/18   Page 15 of 23\n  \n“application is incomplete because Plaintiff V.F.B.’s mother has not yet decided whether to sign \na consent form in support of the application.” Id. at 35–36. And, the Government represents, \n“agents were working on Plaintiff J.S.R.’s reunification with his father prior to the filing of this \nlitigation and the agents have continued working on this process[.]” Id. at 36. \nIV.  DISCUSSION \n  Both parties in this case have recognized that the constitutional rights of J.S.R. and \nV.F.B. have been violated, and that irreparable harm has and will continue to result. See, e.g., \nMot. for TRO at 12 (arguing that family separation is unconstitutional and that it has caused \n“significant and on-going trauma” to J.S.R. and V.F.B.); see also Opp. to Mot. for TRO at 25–26 \n(noting that the Government is implementing, not challenging, the relief ordered by the Southern \nDistrict of California in Ms. L.); id. at 30 (conceding that the children’s “separation from their \nparents was, and remains, traumatic”). \n  The Government argues, however, that the Court should deny preliminary injunctive \nrelief so that the Government has a meaningful opportunity to comply with the California Order \nand reunite the children affected by that Order, including J.S.R. and V.F.B., by July 26. Id. at 36.  \n  For the following reasons, the Court agrees in part and disagrees in part. The Court grants \npreliminary injunctive relief to address the constitutional injury that the parties agreed occurred, \nnamely the children’s trauma as a result of their unconstitutional separation from their parents. \nThe Court denies preliminary injunctive relief requiring the immediate reunification of the \nchildren with their parents, a matter before another court.  \n  A.   Likelihood of Success on the Merits  \nFirst, the Court finds that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that \nJ.S.R. and V.F.B. suffered a constitutional violation. The Government has not challenged the \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 57   Filed 07/13/18   Page 16 of 23\n  \nCalifornia Order, and the parties agree that a constitutional violation occurred when the \nGovernment separated children from their parents—both on the basis of substantive due process, \nas the separation deprived the children of their right to family integrity, and procedural due \nprocess, as J.S.R. and V.F.B. were given no notice and no fair opportunity for a hearing before \nbeing separated from their parents. See Ms. L., 2018 WL 3129486, at *8 (“This practice of \nseparating class members [i.e., migrant parents] from their minor children, and failing to reunify \nclass members with those children, without any showing the parent is unfit or presents a danger \nto the child is sufficient to find Plaintiffs have a likelihood of success on their due process \nclaim.”); cf. Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 753 (1982) (noting “absence of dispute \nreflect[ing] historical recognition that freedom of personal choice in matters of family life is a \nfundamental liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment”); Southerland v. City of \nNew York, 680 F.3d 127, 142 (2d Cir. 2012) (“The Fourteenth Amendment imposes a \nrequirement that except in emergency circumstances, judicial process must be accorded both \nparent and child before removal of the child form his or her parent’s custody may be effected.”); \nMathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 332 (1976) (“Procedural due process imposes constraints on \ngovernmental decisions which deprive individuals of ‘liberty’ or ‘property’ interests within the \nmeaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment.”).  \nThe Court agrees that the Government violated J.S.R.’s and V.F.B.’s constitutional rights \nby forcibly removing them from their parents without due process of law. The Government \nfailed to provide the children with notice or a hearing, instead taking their parents, while \ndistracting the children. See Brock v. Roadway Express, Inc., 481 U.S. 252, 261 (1987) (“Though \nthe required procedures may vary according to the interests at stake in a particular context ‘the \nfundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 57   Filed 07/13/18   Page 17 of 23\n  \nin a meaningful manner.”) (quoting Mathews, 424 U.S. at 333). Even now, the Government has \nnot established a compelling reason for depriving the children of their family integrity—\ndepriving them of their primary and only consistent source of support—or that its policy was \nnarrowly tailored to achieve that compelling reason. See Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 658 \n(1972) (“The integrity of the family unit has found protection in the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment [and] the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.”) \n(internal citations omitted); see also Bohn v. Cty. of Dakota, 772 F.2d 1433, 1435 (8th Cir. 1985) \n(“The privacy and autonomy of familial relationships involved in a case like this are unarguably \namong the protectable interests which due process protects. We can conceive of no more \nimportant relationship, no more basic bond in American society, than the tie between parent and \nchild.”).   \nThe Court’s conclusion is also supported by the California Order. Although that case \nconsidered a class of parents, not children, it held that the parents’ constitutional rights were \nviolated when they were separated from their children, and that this constitutional violation \nrequired reunification. Ms. L., 2018 WL 3129486, at *11 (“What Plaintiffs do seek by way of the \nrequested injunction is to uphold their rights to family integrity and association while their \nimmigration proceedings are underway. This right, specifically, the relationship between parent \nand child, is constitutionally protected and well established.”) (internal quotation marks and \ncitations omitted).  \nObviously, the children will be beneficiaries of that remedy, and this Court acknowledges \nthat the harm that the Government caused to the children is connected with the harm that the \nGovernment caused to the parents, as the Southern District of California identified. Id. at *9 \n(explaining that family separation policy has caused irreparable harm to parents partly because of \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 57   Filed 07/13/18   Page 18 of 23\n  \npain inflicted on their children, and noting that “parents, however, are not the only ones suffering \nfrom the separations,” and that “there is ample evidence that separating children from their \nmothers or fathers leads to serious, negative consequences to children’s health and \ndevelopment,” including higher rates of anxiety, depression, PTSD, and more). The California \nOrder therefore, while it did not directly address the children’s constitutional harm, has a \ncollateral impact on the children and on this Court’s approach to this case.  \nThe Court therefore finds that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their \nconstitutional claim.  \nB.  Irreparable Injury \nHaving established that a constitutional claim has occurred, Plaintiffs are entitled to a \npresumption that an irreparable injury has occurred. See Mitchell, 748 F.2d at 806 (“When an \nalleged deprivation of a constitutional right is involved, most courts hold that no further showing \nof irreparable injury is necessary.”) (quoting 11 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and \nProcedure, § 2948, at 440 (1973)). Here, Plaintiffs have also offered more than enough evidence \nto establish that the Government’s actions traumatized J.S.R. and V.F.B., therefore establishing \nan irreparable injury. See Tucker Anthony Realty Corp. v. Schlesinger, 888 F.2d 969, 975 (2d \nCir. 1989) (“To establish irreparable harm, plaintiffs must demonstrate an injury that is neither \nremote nor speculative, but actual and imminent.”) (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted); see also Levia-Perez v. Holder, 640 F.3d 962, 969–70 (9th Cir. 2011) (“In addition, as \nwe have previously held, ‘[o]ther important [irreparable harm] factors include separation from \nfamily members, medical needs, and potential economic hardship.’”) (quoting Andreiu v. \nAshcroft, 253 F.3d 477, 484 (9th Cir. 2001) (en banc)). \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 57   Filed 07/13/18   Page 19 of 23\n  \nDr. Martin offered evidence that J.S.R. struggles to sleep, distrusts adults, and is \ndepressed and tearful. Dr. Martin found that J.S.R. is suffering from PTSD, and that he had an \nextraordinarily high score on the childhood post-traumatic stress symptom scale, as a result of \nthe acute trauma of being separated from his father, an adult with whom he has a loving, \nsupportive relationship. Dr. Martin offered evidence that V.F.B. is tearful, avoidant, and has a \nblunted and flat affect. She had a score consistent with PTSD on the childhood post-traumatic \nstress symptom scale, and Dr. Martin explained that she was so distressed that she had trouble \nanswering many of his questions. Even if this Court did not presume irreparable harm, as it \nshould, this evidence firmly establishes it.  \nAs a result, the Court finds that Plaintiffs likely would succeed on the merits of their \nmotion for a preliminary injunction, and that Plaintiffs established that the Government violated \nJ.S.R.’s and V.F.B’s constitutional rights to due process and caused them irreparable harm. See \nWalsh, 733 F.3d at 486 (noting that, first, the plaintiff “must establish that he is likely to succeed \non the merits, [and] that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary \nrelief”).  \nC.  Balance of the Equities and the Public Interest \nFinally, the Court must determine whether “the balance of equities tips in [Plaintiffs’] \nfavor” and whether “an injunction is in the public interest.” Walsh, 733 F.3d at 486; see also \nWinter, 555 U.S. at 20 (“A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is \nlikely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \npreliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the \npublic interest.”). “As with irreparable injury, when a plaintiff establishes ‘a likelihood that \nDefendants’ policy violates the U.S.  Constitution, Plaintiffs have also established that both the \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 57   Filed 07/13/18   Page 20 of 23\n  \npublic interest and the balance of the equities favor a preliminary injunction.’” Ms. L., 2018 WL \n3129486, at *10 (quoting Arizona Dream Act Coalition v. Brewer, 757 F.3d 1053, 1069 (9th Cir. \n2014)).  \nDefendants argue that, although Plaintiffs have suffered a constitutional violation, and \nalthough the trauma of the unconstitutional separation has harmed them, the balance of the \nequities and the public interest disfavor this Court issuing a preliminary injunction because that \norder could interfere with the Government’s ability to comply with the relief ordered in Ms. L., \n2018 WL 3129486. Opp. to Mot. for TRO at 25–26. Defendants also argue that the Court should \navoid entering an order duplicative of the California Order. Id. at 27 (“Duplicative litigation is \ndisfavored in the federal courts because of the risk of inconsistent judgments, as well as the \nwaste of the parties’ and judicial resources.”) (citing Barapind v. Reno, 225 F.3d 1100, 1109 (9th \nCir. 2000); Gillespie v. Crawford, 858 F.2d 1101, 1103 (5th Cir. 1988)).  \nThe Court agrees with Defendants, but only to the extent that the California Order will \nprovide relief for J.S.R.’s and V.F.B.’s constitutional harm through reunification. This Court thus \nwill avoid duplicating the California Order and the relief provided by that court.  \nBut the California Order addresses a constitutional harm suffered by a class of parents—\nnot the children who are Plaintiffs here. The cases that Defendants cite, admonishing courts to \navoid duplicative litigation, therefore are distinguishable because they involve cases “where a \ncomplaint involving the same parties and issues has already been filed in another district.” \nBarapind, 225 F.3d at 1109; see also Gillespie, 858 F.2d at 1102–03 (“[T]he individual class \nmember should be barred from pursuing his own individual lawsuit that seeks equitable relief \nwithin the subject matter of the class action.”) (quoting Green v. McKaskle, 770 F.2d 445, 446–\n47 (5th Cir. 1985)). And even though J.S.R. and V.F.B. will benefit from the remedy required by \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 57   Filed 07/13/18   Page 21 of 23\n  \nthe California Order, that court necessarily considered only the harms suffered by the class of \nPlaintiffs before it—parents—and not the two Plaintiffs before this Court—J.S.R. and V.F.B.   \nThe Court therefore finds that the balance of the equities and the public interest both \nfavor a preliminary injunction, to the extent that it can address the particular harms that J.S.R. \nand V.F.B. have suffered, and to the extent that those harms are not already being remedied by \nthe California Order. See, e.g., Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 738 (1974) (“Traditionally, \nequity has been characterized by a practical flexibility in shaping its remedies and by a facility \nfor adjusting and reconciling public and private needs.”); id. at 744  (“The controlling principle \nconsistently expounded in our holdings is that the scope of the remedy is determined by the \nnature and extent of the constitutional violation.”).  \nAt the July 11th hearing, Plaintiffs indicated that, although they wanted immediate relief \nin the form of reunification and release for J.S.R. and V.F.B. and their parents, if the Court were \nnot inclined to grant that relief, they would request that the Court order continued daily \nvideoconferences with the parents, order the Government to provide a clear timeline so that the \nparents and the children could know what to expect, and order psychotherapy for the children. \nJ.S.R. and V.F.B. are entitled to relief to address the consequences of the Government’s \nunconstitutional separation of them from their parents, a harm, based on Dr. Martin’s unrebutted \ntestimony, likely to continue even after family reunification.4 \nAt the upcoming status conference on July 18, 2018 at 11:00 a.m., the parties shall \naddress the form of this relief for J.S.R. and V.F.B., both before and after family reunification. \n                                                            \n4 To the extent that Plaintiffs also sought relief under the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), the Administrative \nProcedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Court need \nnot reach those claims because the only remedies that the Court will address are related to the trauma that Plaintiffs \nendured, which is being adequately remedied by the Court’s decision based on the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment. To the extent that Plaintiffs seek reunification and release under any of these alternative theories, as \ndiscussed above, the Court will not duplicate relief for those who are a part of a class action governed by the \nCalifornia Order. \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 57   Filed 07/13/18   Page 22 of 23\n  \nThe Court will issue writs of writs of habeas corpus ad testificandum to have the parents of \nJ.S.R. and V.F.B. present for this proceeding. The Court will also issue writs of habeas corpus ad \ntestificandum to have J.S.R. and V.F.B. present for the proceeding. As noted in the Court’s \nprevious order, “[i]f the Court determines at the July 11th hearing that immediate constitutional \nrelief is warranted before July 26th or that additional proceedings are necessary before July 26th \nand these proceedings require the physical presence of J.S.R.’s father [or V.F.B.’s mother], then \nthe Court will consider such relief at that time.” Order at 7, ECF No. 27; see also V.F.B. v. \nSessions, No. 3:18-cv-1110, Order at 7, ECF No. 18 (regarding V.F.B. making the same \npronouncement). Because this proceeding will now address specific constitutional relief related \nto the well-being of the children, the Court believes it necessary to have them and their parents \nthere, in the event any testimony is necessary from either of the children or their respective \nparents. \nAdditionally, while modern technology provides opportunities for the virtual presence of \nparties and witnesses at court proceedings beyond what historically had been possible, the \nlogistical challenges presented by the July 11th preliminary injunction hearing make clear the \nnecessity of their physical presence, at least for the July 18th proceeding. \nV.  CONCLUSION \n  The Court therefore orders the following: \n  The Court will hold a status conference on July 18, 2018, at 11:00 a.m., in Courtroom \nTwo, 915 Lafayette Boulevard, Bridgeport, Connecticut. \n  At the July 18th hearing, each party shall present a plan for addressing the children’s \ntrauma as a result of the Government’s unconstitutional separation of the children from \ntheir parents. \n  The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion for writs of habeas corpus ad testificandum for \nJ.S.G. and A.B.A. ECF No. 56. Those writs will follow in a subsequent order. The \nparents shall be brought to Courtroom Two, 915 Lafayette Boulevard, Bridgeport, \n22 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01106-VAB   Document 57   Filed 07/13/18   Page 23 of 23\n  \nConnecticut, at 9:00 a.m. on July 18, 2018, and shall remain there until the conclusion of \nthe hearing. \n  The Court will also issue writs of habeas corpus ad testificandum for J.S.R. and V.F.B., \nwho shall also be brought to Courtroom Two, 915 Lafayette Boulevard, Bridgeport, \nConnecticut, at 9:00 a.m. on July 18, 2018, and shall remain there until the conclusion of \nthe hearing. \n  The Government is directed to continue to facilitate video teleconferences between J.S.R. \nand his father, and between V.F.B. and her mother, on a daily basis between July 13, \n2018, and July 18, 2018. The Court will determine whether to continue this contact at the \nJuly 18th hearing. \nSO ORDERED at Bridgeport, Connecticut, this 13th day of July, 2018. \n     \n    /s/ Victor A.
