    "summary": "<p>On July 12, 2018, three mothers seeking asylum in the United States filed this putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on behalf of all those similarly situated nationwide. The plaintiffs sued the Attorney General of the United States, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), along with their respective agency heads, for allegedly violating the plaintiffs’ Fifth Amendment rights to due process and equal protection. Each of the three named plaintiffs had been separated from their minor children upon being detained in the United States. The plaintiffs, represented by the Immigrant Advocacy and Litigation Center, the University of Southern California, and public counsel, sought an injunction requiring the defendants to provide mental-health screenings and appropriate trauma-informed remedial medical and mental-health services to those parents and children who were separated as a result of the government’s immigrant family separation policy. See <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/16/us/politics/family-separation-trump.html\">“How Trump Came to Enforce a Practice of Separating Migrant Families.”</a> The plaintiffs also sought attorney's fees. The case was assigned to Judge John A. Kronstadt. </p><p>Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged the following:  </p><p>Plaintiff Ms. P, along with her daughter, arrived in the United States on or around May 17, 2018 after fleeing a physically and sexually abusive relationship in her native Guatemala. Ms. P and her daughter were detained near the border and placed in a windowless room that lacked basic amenities alongside 150 other detainees. Here, Ms. P witnessed other children being forcibly taken from their parents, whose distress was mocked by the detention officers. On May 20, after several days in these conditions, Ms. P’s daughter was taken away, with no indication given as to when, or if, Ms. P would see her again.  About two weeks later, Ms. P received notice of her daughter’s location. They were not permitted contact with one another until June 22, when they were able to speak via telephone. According to licensed clinical social workers familiar with Ms. P and her daughter, they are both showing signs of trauma, anxiety, and depression as a result of the ongoing separation. Ms. P has not received any mental health or counseling services from the government to address these concerns.  </p><p>Plaintiff Ms. O, along with her daughter, arrived in the United States on or around May 17, 2018 after fleeing gang violence in her native Honduras. Upon crossing the border, Ms. O and her daughter flagged down a patrol car. They were then processed and detained separately at a nearby facility. Ms. O was placed in a holding cell that resembled a chain-link dog kennel with 50 other women and no basic amenities. Here, Ms. O witnessed other children being forcibly taken from their parents, who were taunted by the detention officers. On May 21, Ms. O, along with 50 other detainees, was taken to court where she plead guilty to criminal illegal entry though she did not understand the consequences. After the proceeding, Ms. O was transferred to another facility without her daughter. Ms. O did not learn of her daughter’s whereabouts until May 30. She and her daughter have spoken over the phone only three times for less than five minutes since being separated.    Ms. O has not received any mental health or counseling services from the government to address her trauma.  </p><p>Plaintiff Ms. M, along with her daughter, arrived in the United States on or around May 18, 2018 after fleeing domestic and gang violence in her native El Salvador.  Upon crossing the border, Ms. M and her daughter flagged down a patrol car and were immediately taken to facility and separated for questioning. Ms. M was mocked by detention officers during this questioning. Ms. M was kept in a “cage” that lacked basic amenities with 40-50 other women. Food was scarce, and the guards would sometimes throw crackers on the floor of the cell and laugh as the hungry women scrambled to pick them up. From her cage, Ms. M could see her daughter crying in a separate cell. On May 21, Ms. M was taken to criminal proceedings with 50 other detainees where she believed she had to, and did, plead guilty though she did not understand the consequences. After these proceedings, Ms. M was transferred to another facility. She did not learn of her daughter’s location or condition until her mother, who is a permanent legal resident of the United States, provided her with this information on May 25. On June 22, Ms. M was able to speak with her daughter, who was crying uncontrollably, on the phone for about one minute. Ms. M was released on bond on July 12.    </p><p>On July 12, the plaintiffs sought to have their lawsuit declared “related” to the <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=9493\">1985 Flores</a> case, which had resulted in an important and long-lasting immigration settlement agreement. Judge Dolly M. Gee declined to transfer the case to Flores because this action sought affirmative relief separate and apart from the Flores Settlement Agreement and did not call for a determination of the same questions of law or fact. </p><p>On July 18, 2018, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction requiring the defendants to provide meaningful access to mental health care screening and treatment to the plaintiffs and other proposed class members. On July 27, 2018, the plaintiffs moved for class certification, proposing to define the class as all adult parents nationwide who (1) were, are, or will be detained in immigration custody by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), and (2) have a minor child who has been, is, or will be separated from them by DHS and detained in DHS or Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”) custody or foster care, absent a demonstration in a hearing that the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child.</p><p>On September 18, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss. </p><p>In January 2019 the parties entered settlement discussions and the court selected Senior District Judge James S. Otero to preside over settlement proceedings between the parties. Several settlement conferences were held but the case was eventually sent back to Judge Kronstadt in October 2019 after the parties failed to come to an agreement. </p><p>On November 5, 2019, Judge Kronstadt granted the plaintiffs' motions for class certification and a preliminary injunction, and denied the defendants' motion to dismiss. He certified the following class: <blockquote>\"All adult parents nationwide who entered the U.S. at or between designated ports of entry, who (1) on or after July 1, 2017, were, are, or will be detained in immigration custody by DHS; and (2) have a minor child who has been, is, or will be separated from them by DHS and detained in DHS or ORR custody or foster care, absent a demonstration in a hearing that the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child.\"</blockquote> He also certified the following subclasses: <blockquote>\"(i) the Custody Subclass, which is defined as all members of the class who are currently or will be detained in immigration custody by DHS; and (ii) the Released Subclass, which is defined as all members of the class who were previously detained in immigration custody by DHS, but who have since been release.\"</blockquote> Next, Judge Kronstadt found that the plaintiffs had shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their due process claim with respect to both subclasses. 2019 WL 6723686.</p><p>The court ordered that the defendants make available, to all members of the subclasses who elect to have them, medically appropriate initial mental health screenings, diagnoses, and treatment (if requested) by qualified professionals.</p><p>On November 27, the defendants appealed to the Ninth Circuit (docket no. 19-56400). They also requested that the district court stay the case pending resolution of the appeal. </p><p>On February 21, 2020, the defendants filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss their appeal. </p><p>On March 24, 2020, the parties filed a joint stipulation to stay the case, including pending discovery, through January 10, 2021. The parties reported that on March 11, 2020, defendant DHHS had finalized a contract with a non-profit organization to implement the preliminary injunction as to the Released Subclass. As to the Custody Subclass, defendant DHS would provide notice to class members of available services and the ICE Health Service Corps Behavioral Health Unit would provide screenings and any necessary treatment. Consequently, the parties requested a stay while this relief is provided. </p><p>The district court granted the stay the same day, ordering the defendants to file status reports every sixty days, with the first report due on May 22, 2020. </p><p>The case is ongoing.</p>",

That the relief sought by Plaintiffs in the Complaint and Injunction \nMotion Included their release .and reunification \\Vfth their chUdreo does not reqUire the.a pplication of the \nfirst-tcrfiJe rule: aHhough these aJe fogicat and n·ecessary first steps In·a ddressing the needed mental \nhealth relief, they were not deemed sufficient See Expert Oectaratlon of Ma~een Wong (•wong Dec!.\"). \nOkt461J25 (\"~eunification with caregivers ·is the first necessary step in mitigating· the trauma these \nchildren experienced. HO'Never, reunification·with caregivers is not enough to mltiga.te the effects of the \nfOrced separation.-). Moreover. even if it were determined that the policy itself did not violate the \nConstitution, that would not necessari1y Pfedud'e the claim that the manner of its fmplementation \neffected s.uct'l a violation. Because a success:ful defense in one aclion rnay not deterr11ine the outcome \nof the other, Optec, 2008 Wl11338470, at '4, the \"central questions• presented by the two cases are \ndistinct. See Pacesetter. 678 F.2d at 95. The plaintiffs In each case assert different ano llistinct \nconstitutional viOlations, for which they seek different relief. Therefore, the·first-to-file rule does not bar \nthis action. See cedars-Sinai. 125 F.3d at 769. \nThere Is an overlap between members of lhe certified class in Ms. L and the proposed dass he(e. \nThere is also a relationship between the oonsfitutional righiS asserted by the members of each class. \nTherefore. some judicial and party effiCiency could be achieved If lhe two actions were inigated \ntogether. Indeed. other actions seeking relief related to ·the family separation policy have bee.n \nconsolidated wilh the Ms. L. proceedings. See M.M.M. v. Sessions, No. 3'18-cv-1832-DMS (S.D.

For example, tbe Ofder transferring the· N.

Defendants have provided no authority \nsupporting the posiUon that injunctive relief becomes compensatory for the purposes of Rule 23(b)(2) \nbecause it imposes what a defendant deems burdensome conditions. The proposed relief here is not \nthe es.tablishment of a comlll!>n fund to pay for the costs of medical care. See. e.g. . O'Connor v. Bcelng \nN.A., Inc. . 180 F.R. D. 359. 378 n23 (N.D.

In addition to the di:lficlencies wjth respect to commonality. it was atso improper to \ncertify a claim for bacl<pay under Rule 23(b)(2): \n[C]Iaims for Individualized refief (lfkelhe bact<pay at issue here) do not satisfy the Rule. \nThe key to the (b )(2) class is \"llle lndrvisible nature of the lnjunctlve or declar'\\tory \nremedy wamlnted-the notion that the oonduct is such that it can be enjOined or \ndeclared unlaWfUl only as to aJI of the da.ss. members or as to none of them:  In other \nWords, Rule 23(b)(2).app!ies only When a single Injunction ot declaratory judgment would \nprovide relief to each member of lhe class.

Grounds \nThe frrst four of the Matters raised ih the Motion 10 Dismiss have been addressed ab:ove In tol'l·neelion \nwith the lf1iunctlon Motion. Plaintiffs' daims are not moot, because tt>elr injuries are not resolved by the \nrelease and reunification of most dass members. See supra§§ III(C), IV(8)(2)(b)(4). Plaintiffs have \nade_quately stated a claim that the family separation poficy In combination with the Insufficient' mental \n1 \nhealthcare provided during detention, viola!ed their due process rights. See wpm§ V(8)(2)(c). The \nclaims are not barred by sovereign immunity. See supra § V(B)(2)(a). Th~ Ms. L action does, not \nwarrant djsmlssat or transfer of this action. See supra§ Ill. \n2.  Venue \na.  Legal Standards \nUnder Fed. R Clv.

INTRODUCTION \n2  In the last several months, the government, and Defendants working on its \n3  behalf, deliberately, needlessly, and unconstitutionally separated thousands of children \n4  from their parents, refused to allow parents and children to communicate, failed to \n5  provide information about the well-being of the separated family members, and kept \n6  separated family members in intolerable suspense by refusing to explain when or even \n7  if family would ever be reunified.   \n8  The government’s misconduct inflicted devastating psychological trauma on \n9  both parents and children, which trauma is multiplied the longer the families remain \n10  separated and/or untreated.  Its effects do not evaporate once families are united; \n11  instead, there is a risk of long-lasting damage to the physical and mental health of \n12  parents and children alike, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress \n13  disorder (“PTSD”).  Plaintiffs and the group of parents whom they seek to represent in \n14  this action need immediate mental health screenings, and if appropriate, family-\n15  centered mental health treatment designed to alleviate such trauma and to reduce the \n16  risk of long-term consequences to both parent and child.  In their Motion for \n17  Preliminary Injunction, filed July 18, 2018 (Dkt. No. 45) (“PI Motion”), Plaintiffs \n18  seek an order requiring the government to live up to its constitutional obligations by \n19  screening Plaintiffs and the proposed class members to identify those who require \n20  treatment and providing effective treatment in an appropriate setting to address the \n21  harm inflicted by the unconstitutional separation of families. \n22  Together with this injunctive relief, Plaintiffs seek to certify the following \n23  nationwide class under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2): \n24 \nAll adult parents nationwide who (1) were, are, or will be \ndetained in immigration custody by the Department of \n25 \nHomeland Security (“DHS”), and (2) have a minor child \n26  who has been, is, or will be separated from them by DHS \nand detained in DHS or Office of Refugee Resettlement \n27  (“ORR”) custody or foster care, absent a demonstration in a \n28 \n1 \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 81   Filed 07/27/18   Page 11 of 30   Page ID #:1068\n \n1  hearing that the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the \nchild. \n2 \nThe proposed class satisfies the requirements of numerosity, commonality, \n3 \ntypicality, and adequacy in Rule 23(a) and is ascertainable: \n4 \nNumerosity.  The proposed class includes over one thousand individuals whose \n5 \nminor children were separated from them, and many members of the proposed class \n6 \nhave not been reunited with their minor children.  \n7 \nCommonality.  The class raises numerous common questions of fact and law. \n8 \nEach of the class members has been subject to the government’s family separation \n9 \npolicy, and had their minor children forcibly taken from their care, triggering the \n10 \ntrauma and other harms alleged in the Complaint and described in the PI Motion. In \n11 \naddition, the question of whether and to what extent the government has developed an \n12 \nappropriate policy for mitigating the harms inflicted by the family separation policy is \n13 \ncommon to all proposed class members.  Multiple questions of law also are common \n14 \nto the proposed class, namely whether Defendants’ family separation practice violates \n15 \nthe substantive due process and equal protection rights of the proposed class members \n16 \nand the appropriate relief to address the harm. \n17 \nTypicality.  Plaintiffs’ due process and equal protection claims are typical of \n18 \nthe class of individuals whom they seek to represent—that is, other parents who were \n19 \nforcibly separated from their children without a finding of unfitness or that they \n20 \npresent a danger to their children, and who have not been provided with appropriate \n21 \nmental-health screening or offered appropriate trauma-informed intervention.  \n22 \nPlaintiffs assert the same rights under the Fifth Amendment as the members of the \n23 \nproposed class.  \n24 \nAdequacy.  The proposed class representatives satisfy the adequacy \n25 \nrequirement as the Plaintiffs assert the same claims and seek the same relief—\n26 \nappropriate mental-health screen and any appropriate trauma-informed intervention \n27 \nunder appropriate conditions—and will defend the rights of all the proposed class \n28 \n2 \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 81   Filed 07/27/18   Page 12 of 30   Page ID #:1069\n \n1  members fairly and adequately.  Additionally, the proposed class counsel is a team of \n2  attorneys from Public Counsel and Sidley Austin LLP with significant experience \n3  litigating class actions and other complex cases in federal court, including civil rights \n4  cases on behalf of noncitizens.  \n5  Ascertainable.  The proposed class is ascertainable using Defendants’ records.  \n6  Plaintiffs’ proposed class likewise satisfies Rule 23(b)(2) because Defendants have \n7  “acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final \n8  injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class \n9  as a whole.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). Defendants have forcibly separated migrant \n10  parents from their children under a common policy and have failed to provide \n11  adequate mental health evaluation and care to the families to remedy the harm \n12  inflicted on the proposed class members and their minor children.  As a result, the \n13  declaratory and injunctive relief sought by the plaintiffs will be appropriate with \n14  respect to the class as a whole. \n15  Accordingly, this Court should grant class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) for \n16  purposes of entering Plaintiffs’ requested classwide preliminary and permanent \n17  injunctions.1 See Carrillo v. Schneider Logistics, Inc., No. 11-cv-8557, 2012 WL \n18  556309, at *9 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 31, 2012) (“courts routinely grant provisional class \n19  certification for purposes of entering [preliminary] injunctive relief” under Rule \n20  23(b)(2) where the plaintiff establishes that the four prerequisites in Rule 23(a) are \n21  also met) (citing Baharona-Gomez v. Reno, 167 F.3d 1228, 1233 (9th Cir. 1999)). \n22  II.  BACKGROUND \n23  A.  The Government’s Implementation of its Unconstitutional Family \nSeparation Policy \n24 \nOn May 7, 2018, Defendant Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a “zero-\n25 \ntolerance” policy of forced family separation to deter migrants from crossing the \n26 \n27                                             \n1 Plaintiffs also request that they be appointed Class Representatives, and that \n28  undersigned counsel be appointed Class Counsel. \n3 \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 81   Filed 07/27/18   Page 13 of 30   Page ID #:1070\n \n1  southern border, announcing “If you cross this border unlawfully, then we will \n2  prosecute you.  It’s that simple. . . .  If you are smuggling a child, then we will \n3  prosecute you and that child will be separated from you. . . .”2  But the policy was not \n4  limited to “smugglers.”  Rather, ordinary immigrant families—many of whom are \n5  seeking asylum—bore its brunt.  In the first month of the policy, nearly 3,000 children \n6  were separated from their parents while crossing the border.3  Some children were as \n7  young as 18 months old, and more than 100 were younger than four years old.4   \n8  The government mischaracterized family separation as necessary to enforce the \n9  law.  But DHS expressly contemplated using family separation to deter migration \n10  from Central America into the United States at least a year before the “zero tolerance” \n11  policy was adopted,5 and administration officials have confirmed the goal of deterring \n12  Central American immigrants.6     \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n                                           \n18  2 Attorney General Sessions Delivers Remarks Discussing the Immigration \nEnforcement Actions of the Trump Administration, DOJ Justice News (May 7, 2018), \n19 \nhttps://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-sessions-delivers-remarks-\n20  discussing-immigration-enforcement-actions. \n3 Caitlin Dickerson, Trump Administration in Chaotic Scramble to Reunify Migrant \n21  Families, N.Y.

The Plaintiffs and the Government’s Separation of Plaintiffs and \ntheir Minor Children \n2 \n1.  Plaintiff Ms. J.P. (“Ms. P”) \n3 \nAfter Ms. P fled Guatemala with her 16-year-old daughter, both crossed the \n4 \nborder and were detained by Customs and Border Patrol (“CBP”).7 Ms. P fled \n5 \nGuatemala to escape death threats from a former partner who sexually abused and \n6 \nbeat her.8 Because Ms. P spoke a Mayan dialect rarely spoken in the United States, \n7 \nMs. P could not communicate with detention officers.9 \n8 \nWhen they arrived in the United States, Ms. P and her daughter, L.P. initially \n9 \nwere detained by the government in a windowless room without beds or showers and \n10 \nfed nothing but lukewarm soup.10 Guards at the facility taunted mothers, saying: “If \n11 \nyou’re such a good mother, why would you bring your child here?”11 Three days after \n12 \nentering the United States, with no explanation, the government removed L.P. from \n13 \nthe detention center where the government was holding Ms. P.12 When she realized \n14 \nwhat was happening, L.P. fainted in terror, which injured her mouth and left her face \n15 \nswollen for several days.13 The government did not permit Ms. P to speak to her \n16 \ndaughter until June 22, 2018, when, after 30 hours of advocacy by her attorney, she \n17 \nwas allowed to speak with L.P. by phone.14 \n18 \nMs. P “is displaying symptoms of [PTSD] . . . as a result of her separation from \n19 \nher daughter” and is also “displaying symptoms of both depression and anxiety.”15  If \n20 \nleft untreated, these symptoms “could escalate into a diagnosis of PTSD, Dissociative \n21 \nDisorder, and Major Depressive Disorder.”16 “Ms. P speaks a Mayan dialect and \n22 \n                                           \n7 Declaration of Ms. J.P.

Named Plaintiff: Ms. R.M. (“Ms. M”) \n4  Ms. M and her 15-year-old daughter, S.Q., fled El Salvador in fear of Ms. M’s \n5  husband, a former military officer, who severely beat them both and threatened their \n6  lives.28 On or around May 18, 2018, Ms. M and her daughter entered the United States \n7  near Hidalgo, Texas, where they encountered a CBP officer and claimed fear of \n8  returning to their country of origin.29 \n9  CBP immediately detained and separated Ms. M and her daughter.30 Officers \n10  told Ms. M that she was to be deported without her daughter, and that she would be \n11  punished for exposing her daughter to such a harsh journey. 31 Upon hearing this, Ms. \n12  M began to cry, and one officer said, “You can thank Trump.”32 \n13  Ms. M was kept in a holding cell that resembled a dog kennel tightly packed \n14  with at least 40 – 50 other women.33 The guards fed them with pieces of soggy bread \n15  and a frozen piece of what looked like ham.34 The guards would humiliate the women \n16  by opening the cage door and throwing crackers at them.35   \n17  Within several days of her detention, Ms. M was prosecuted on federal criminal \n18  charges and transferred to the SeaTac Federal Prison in SeaTac, Washington.36 She \n19  was subsequently transferred to the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, \n20  Washington.37 Ms. M’s daughter was detained in Southwest Key Programs, Inc.—\n21 \n                                           \n22 \n27 Declaration of Alfonso Mercado (“Mercado Decl.”) ¶ 7. \n28 Declaration of Ms. R.M.

The Government’s Family Separation Policy is Found Likely \nUnconstitutional and Enjoined in Ms. L. v. U.S. Immigration & \n6  Customs Enforcement \n7  The government’s policy of separating families was met with widespread \n8  condemnation and, unsurprisingly, litigation.  One of the cases challenging the policy \n9  was filed by a refugee known as “Ms. L.” in the Southern District of California, and is \n10  pending before Judge Dana Sabraw.  Ms. L. v. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enf’t, \n11  Case No. 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD, 2018 WL 3129486 (S.D. Cal. June 26, 2018) \n12  (“Ms. L. Case”).  On June 26, 2018, Judge Sabraw preliminarily certified a class of \n13  parents who enter the United States who were, are or will be detained in immigration \n14  custody, and who have a minor child who is or will be separated from them absent a \n15  determination that the parent is unfit or endangers the child.  Ms. L. Case, Dkt. No. 82 \n16  at 17.   \n17  That same day, Judge Sabraw also concluded that the Ms. L Case plaintiffs had \n18  submitted evidence demonstrating they were likely to succeed in showing that the \n19  government’s family separation practice violates due process and “shocks the \n20  conscience” and “interferes with rights implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, \n21  … and is so brutal and offensive that it [does] not comport with traditional ideas of \n22  fair play and decency,” Ms. L. Case, Dkt. No. 83 at 12, 17, and entered a preliminary \n23  injunction that required the following: \n24  •  Defendants . . . are preliminarily enjoined from detaining Class Members in \n25  DHS custody without and apart from their minor children, absent a \n26  determination that the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child . . . . \n27  •  Defendants must reunify all Class Members with their minor children who are \n28  under the age of five (5) within fourteen (14) days of the entry of this Order; \n9 \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 81   Filed 07/27/18   Page 19 of 30   Page ID #:1076\n \n1  and . . . Defendants must reunify all Class Members with their minor children \n2  age five (5) and over within thirty (30) days of the entry of this Order. \n3  •  Defendants . . . are preliminarily enjoined from removing any Class Members \n4  without their child . . . . \n5  Id. at 22-24.  The government has struggled to comply with the injunction ordered in \n6  the Ms. L Case and has not fully complied with that order as of the filing of this \n7  Motion.  Ms. L. Case, Dkt.

The Plaintiffs’ PI Motion Seeks Relief for the Trauma the \nGovernment’s Separation Policy Inflicted on Plaintiffs and the \n18  Proposed Class Members  \n19  As detailed in the PI Motion, the consensus among trauma experts is that \n20  tearing children from their parents inflicts severe complex trauma on parents and \n21  children alike.  This trauma increases the longer the separation continues and/or goes \n22  untreated.  Accordingly, in the PI Motion, Plaintiffs seek for themselves and the \n23  proposed class members mental health screening and appropriate and sufficient mental \n24  health services to alleviate the psychological and neurobiological consequences of the \n25  government’s forcible separation of migrant parents and their children.  See Dkt. No. \n26  45.  As set forth below, certification of the proposed class in this action is appropriate \n27  under Rule 23. \n28 \n10 \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 81   Filed 07/27/18   Page 20 of 30   Page ID #:1077\n \n1  III.  ARGUMENT \n2  A plaintiff whose suit meets the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil \n3  Procedure 23 has a “categorical” right “to pursue his claim as a class action.” Shady \n4  Grove Orthopedic Assocs., P.A. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.S. 393, 398 (2010). To \n5  meet these requirements, the “suit must satisfy the criteria set forth in [Rule 23(a)] \n6  (i.e., numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation), and it also \n7  must fit into one of the three categories described in subdivision (b).” Id. \n8  Plaintiffs’ proposed class satisfies all four of the Rule 23(a) prerequisites, as \n9  well as the judicially implied requirement of ascertainability. The proposed class \n10  likewise meets the requirements for certification under Rule 23(b)(2). This Court \n11  should certify the proposed class in keeping with the numerous court decisions \n12  certifying classes in similar actions challenging the federal government’s \n13  administration of immigration programs. See, e.g., Walters v. Reno, 145 F.3d 1032 \n14  (9th Cir. 1998) (affirming certification of nationwide class of individuals challenging \n15  adequacy of notice in document fraud cases); Arnott v. U.S. Citizenship & \n16  Immigration Servs., 290 F.R.D. 579 (C.D. Cal. 2012) (certifying nationwide class of \n17  immigrant investors challenging USCIS’ retroactive application of new rules \n18  governing approval petitions to remove permanent residency conditions); Santillan v. \n19  Ashcroft, No. 04-cv-2686, 2004 WL 2297990 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 12, 2004) (certifying \n20  nationwide class of lawful permanent residents challenging delays in receiving \n21  documentation of their status); Wagafe v. Trump, No. 17-cv-0094, 2017 WL 2671254, \n22  at *1 (W.D. Wash. June 21, 2017) (certifying nationwide class of naturalization \n23  applicants challenging national security screening procedures); Mendez Rojas, et al. v. \n24  Johnson, No. 16-cv-1024, 2017 WL 1397749 (W.D. Wash. Jan. 10, 2017) (certifying \n25  two nationwide classes of asylum seekers challenging defective asylum application \n26  procedures); see also Ms. L. Case, 2018 WL 3129486, at *3, 11-12  (certifying a class \n27  of parents who enter the United States at or between designated ports of entry who (1) \n28  have been, are, or will be detained in immigration custody by the DHS, and (2) have a \n11 \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 81   Filed 07/27/18   Page 21 of 30   Page ID #:1078\n \n1  minor child who is or will be separated from them absent a determination that the \n2  parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child).  \n3  A.  The Proposed Class Satisfies Rule 23(a)’s Requirements \n1.  The Proposed Class Satisfies the Numerosity Requirement  \n4 \nRule 23(a)(1) requires that a class be “so numerous that joinder of all members \n5 \nis impracticable.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1). “‘[I]mpracticability’ does not mean \n6 \n‘impossibility,’ but only the difficulty or inconvenience of joining all members of the \n7 \nclass.” Franco-Gonzales v. Napolitano, No. 10-cv-02211, 2011 WL 11705815, at *6 \n8 \n(C.D. Cal. Nov. 21, 2011) (quoting Harris v. Palm Springs Alpine Estates, Inc., 329 F. \n9 \n2d 909, 913-14 (9th Cir. 1964)). No fixed number of class members is required. \n10 \nPerez-Funez v. Dist. Dir., I.N.S., 611 F. Supp. 990, 995 (C.D. Cal. 1984). Moreover, \n11 \nwhere a plaintiff seeks injunctive and declaratory relief, the “requirement is relaxed \n12 \nand plaintiffs may rely on [] reasonable inference[s] arising from plaintiffs’ other \n13 \nevidence that the number of unknown and future members of [the] proposed subclass \n14 \n… is sufficient to make joinder impracticable.” Arnott v. U.S. Citizenship & \n15 \nImmigration Servs., 290 F.R.D. 579, 586 (C.D. Cal. 2012) (quoting Sueoka v. United \n16 \nStates, 101 Fed. App’x 649, 653 (9th Cir. 2004)). \n17 \nHere, the number of class members far exceeds the requirement for numerosity.  \n18 \nThe government admitted that as recently as July 5, 2018, 3,000 minor children were \n19 \nheld in detention after being forcibly separated from their parents. Caitlin Dickerson, \n20 \nTrump Administration in Chaotic Scramble to Reunify Migrant Families, NY. TIMES \n21 \n(July 5, 2018), https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/us/migrant-children-chaos-\n22 \nfamily-separation.html; Separating families at the border: How we got here, CBS \n23 \nNEWS (June 18, 2018), https://cbsn.ws/2MAkOvq.  The Court can thus reasonably \n24 \nconclude that the proposed class is sufficiently numerous. See Cervantez v. Celestica \n25 \nCorp., 253 F.R.D. 562, 569 (C.D. Cal. 2008) (noting that “where the exact size of the \n26 \nclass is unknown but general knowledge and common sense indicate that it is large, \n27 \nthe numerosity requirement is satisfied”) (quotation marks omitted); see also, e.g., \n28 \n12 \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 81   Filed 07/27/18   Page 22 of 30   Page ID #:1079\n \n1  Hum v. Dericks, 162 F.R.D. 628, 634 (D. Haw. 1995) (“Courts have certified classes \n2  with as few as thirteen members.”); Ark. Educ. Ass’n v. Bd. of Ed. of Portland, Ark. \n3  Sch. Dist., 446 F.2d 763, 765-66 (8th Cir. 1971) (class of 20 sufficient). \n4  Second, in addition to the number of individuals who have already been \n5  separated from their children, the proposed class also includes individuals who will \n6  have a child taken from them. The presence of such future class members renders \n7  joinder inherently impractical, thereby satisfying the purpose behind the numerosity \n8  requirement. See, e.g., Ali v. Ashcroft, 213 F.R.D. 390, 408 (W.D. Wash. 2003), aff’d, \n9  346 F.3d 873 (9th Cir. 2003), vacated on other grounds, 421 F.3d 795 (9th Cir. 2005) \n10  (quotation marks omitted) (“[W]here the class includes unnamed, unknown future \n11  members, joinder of such unknown individuals is impracticable and the numerosity \n12  requirement is therefore met, regardless of class size.”) (quoting Nat’l Ass’n of \n13  Radiation Survivors v. Walters, 111 F.R.D. 595, 599 (N.D. Cal. 1986)); Smith v. \n14  Heckler, 595 F. Supp. 1173, 1186 (E.D. Cal. 1984) (in injunctive relief cases, \n15  “[j]oinder in the class of persons who may be injured in the future has been held \n16  impracticable without regard to the number of persons already injured”); Hawker v. \n17  Consovoy, 198 F.R.D. 619, 625 (D.N.J. 2001) (“The joinder of potential future class \n18  members who share a common characteristic, but whose identity cannot be \n19  determined yet is considered impracticable.”). \n20  2.  The Class Presents Common Questions of Law and Fact \nTo satisfy commonality, Plaintiffs must show that “there are questions of law or \n21 \nfact common to the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2). Rule 23(a)(2)’s commonality \n22 \nrequirement “has been construed permissively.” Preap v. Johnson, 303 F.R.D. 566, \n23 \n585 (N.D. Cal. 2014), aff’d, 831 F.3d 1193 (9th Cir. 2016) (quoting Hanlon v. \n24 \nChrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1019 (9th Cir. 1998)) (quotation marks omitted). A \n25 \nplaintiff “need not show . . . that every question in the case, or even a preponderance \n26 \nof questions, is capable of class wide resolution.” Parsons v. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657, 675 \n27 \n(9th Cir. 2014) (quotation marks omitted). Rather, even one shared legal issue can be \n28 \n13 \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 81   Filed 07/27/18   Page 23 of 30   Page ID #:1080\n \n1  sufficient. See, e.g., Mazza v. Am. Honda Motor Co., 666 F.3d 581, 589 (9th Cir. \n2  2012) (noting that “commonality only requires a single significant question of law or \n3  fact”); Walters, 145 F.3d at 1046 (“What makes the plaintiffs’ claims suitable for a \n4  class action is the common allegation that the INS’s procedures provide insufficient \n5  notice.”). \n6  Moreover, “[i]ndividual variation among plaintiffs’ questions of law and fact \n7  does not defeat underlying legal commonality, because ‘the existence of shared legal \n8  issues with divergent factual predicates is sufficient’ to satisfy Rule 23.” Santillan v. \n9  Ashcroft, 2004 WL 2297990, at *10 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 12, 2004) (quoting Hanlon, 150 \n10  F.3d at 1019). The commonality standard is even more liberal in a civil rights suit like \n11  this one, in which “the lawsuit challenges a system-wide practice or policy that affects \n12  all of the putative class members.” Armstrong v. Davis, 275 F.3d 849, 868 (9th Cir. \n13  2001), abrogated on other grounds, Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499 (2005). \n14  Plaintiffs’ lawsuit raises numerous legal and factual questions common to the \n15  proposed class. First, whether and to what extent the government has an obligation to \n16  develop an appropriate policy for mitigating the harms inflicted by the family \n17  separation policy.  Second, and relatedly, whether Defendants’ policies and practices \n18  actions have violated the substantive due process rights of proposed class members \n19  and their rights to equal protection of the law.  Each of these raises multiple common \n20  questions of law and fact.  And any one of these common issues, standing alone, is \n21  enough to satisfy Rule 23(a)(2)’s permissive standard. See Perez-Olano v. Gonzalez, \n22  248 F.R.D. 248, 257 (C.D. Cal. 2008) (“Courts have found that a single common issue \n23  of law or fact is sufficient.”) (citation omitted); Sweet v. Pfizer, 232 F.R.D. 360, 367 \n24  (C.D. Cal. 2005) (observing that “there must only be one single issue common to the \n25  proposed class”) (quotation and citation omitted). \n26  Plaintiffs and proposed class members also share a common core of facts: all \n27  came to the United States with their children and were subsequently detained; all were \n28  separated from their children without any allegation or showing that they present a \n14 \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 81   Filed 07/27/18   Page 24 of 30   Page ID #:1081\n \n1  danger to their child; the scientific consensus is that child—parent separation is a \n2  traumatic event; there is no existing policy to provide class members appropriate \n3  mental-health screening or appropriate trauma-informed intervention. Plaintiffs and \n4  proposed class members, thus, “have suffered the same injury.” Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. \n5  v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011) (quoting Gen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. \n6  147, 157 (1982)). And that common injury is clearly “capable of class wide \n7  resolution.” Id. Should the Court agree that Defendants’ policies or practices violate \n8  the Due Process Clause, all who fall within the class will benefit from the requested \n9  relief: mental-health screenings for Plaintiffs and their children to assess their need for \n10  subsequent trauma-informed remedial medical and appropriate mental-health services \n11  to address the trauma of separation and child detention. A common answer as to the \n12  legality of the challenged policies and practices will “drive the resolution of the \n13  litigation.” Ellis v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 657 F.3d 970, 981 (9th Cir. 2011) \n14  (quoting Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350). \n15  Significantly, courts have made clear that even “[w]here the circumstances of \n16  each particular class member vary but retain a common core of factual or legal issues \n17  with the rest of the class, commonality exists.” Evon v. Law Offices of Sidney Mickell, \n18  688 F.3d 1015, 1029 (9th Cir. 2012) (quotation marks omitted); see also Walters, 145 \n19  F.3d at 1046 (“Differences among the class members with respect to the merits of \n20  their actual document fraud cases, however, are simply insufficient to defeat the \n21  propriety of class certification. What makes the plaintiffs’ claims suitable for a class \n22  action is the common allegation that the INS’s procedures provide insufficient \n23  notice.”); Arnott, 290 F.R.D. at 586-87 (factual variations did not defeat certification \n24  where core legal issues were similar). Moreover, any factual differences that may exist \n25  among Plaintiffs and individual proposed class members are immaterial to their core \n26  claim that they are entitled to mental health care screenings and effective family \n27  treatment to address and remediate the effects of the trauma that the government \n28  wantonly and knowingly inflicted on them under the unconstitutional policy of \n15 \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 81   Filed 07/27/18   Page 25 of 30   Page ID #:1082\n \n1  separating parents from their children.  See, e.g., Orantes-Hernandez v. Smith, 541 F. \n2  Supp. 351, 370 (C.D. Cal. 1982) (granting certification in challenge to common \n3  agency practices in asylum cases, even though the outcome of individual asylum cases \n4  would depend on individual class members’ varying entitlement to asylum). \n5  3.  Typicality:  Plaintiffs’ Claims Are Typical of Class Members’ \nClaims  \n6 \nRule 23(a)(3) requires that “the claims or defenses of the representative parties \n7 \n[be] typical of the claims or defenses of the class.” The purpose of this requirement is \n8 \nto “assure[] that the interests of the named representatives align with those of the \n9 \nclass” as a whole. Weinberger v. Thornton, 114 F.R.D. 599, 603 (S.D. Cal. 1986). \n10 \n“Under the rule’s permissive standards, representative claims are ‘typical’ if they are \n11 \nreasonably coextensive with those of the absent class members.” Parsons, 754 F.3d at \n12 \n685 (quoting Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1020). “The test of typicality is ‘whether other \n13 \nmembers have the same or similar injury, whether the action is based on conduct \n14 \nwhich is not unique to the named plaintiffs, and whether other class members have \n15 \nbeen injured by the same course of conduct.’” Id. (citation omitted). \n16 \nPlaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the proposed class, for largely the \n17 \nsame reasons that the class presents common questions of law and fact. Each proposed \n18 \nclass member—like each proposed class representative, Ms. P, Ms. O, and Ms. M—\n19 \nwas forcibly separated from her child without a finding of unfitness or that she \n20 \npresented a danger to her child, and she has not been provided with appropriate \n21 \nmental-health screenings or offered appropriate trauma-informed intervention.  \n22 \nAdditionally, Plaintiffs assert the same rights under the Fifth Amendment.  Plaintiffs’ \n23 \nclaims are not only typical of proposed class members, they are nearly identical. \n24 \nMoreover, as with commonality, any factual differences between Plaintiffs and \n25 \nproposed class members are not material enough to defeat typicality.  See, e.g., \n26 \nHanlon, 150 F.3d at 1020 (under “permissive” typicality standard, representative \n27 \nclaims need only be “reasonably co-extensive with those of absent class members; \n28 \n16 \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 81   Filed 07/27/18   Page 26 of 30   Page ID #:1083\n \n1  they need not be substantially identical”); LaDuke v. Nelson, 762 F.2d 1318, 1332 (9th \n2  Cir. 1985) (“The minor differences in the manner in which the representative’s Fourth \n3  Amendment rights were violated does not render their claims atypical of those of the \n4  class.”); cf. Marisol A. v. Giuliani, 126 F.3d 372, 378 (2d Cir. 1997) (certifying Rule \n5  23(b)(2) class despite differences in the exact nature of the harm suffered by class \n6  members). \n7  4.  Adequacy: Plaintiffs Will Adequately Protect the Interests of \nthe Proposed Class, and Plaintiffs’ Counsel Are More Than \n8  Qualified to Litigate this Action \n9  Rule 23(a)(4) requires that “[t]he representative parties will fairly and \n10  adequately protect the interests of the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  Adequacy \n11  depends on “the qualifications of counsel for the representatives, an absence of \n12  antagonism, a sharing of interests between representatives and absentees, and the \n13  unlikelihood that the suit is collusive.”  Walters, 145 F.3d at 1046 (quotation marks \n14  omitted).  Plaintiffs’ counsel are deemed qualified when they possess experience in \n15  previous class actions and cases involving the same area of law.  Lynch v. Rank, 604 \n16  F. Supp. 30, 37 (N.D. Cal. 1984), aff’d 747 F.2d 528 (9th Cir. 1984), amended on \n17  reh’g, 763 F.2d 1098 (9th Cir. 1985).  Here, putative Class Counsel are attorneys from \n18  Public Counsel and Sidley Austin LLP with significant experience in immigrants’ \n19  rights issues and hundreds of class action cases.  Class Counsel have more than \n20  sufficient resources to litigate this matter vigorously.  \n21  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the proposed class, \n22  and therefore, are adequate class representatives. Plaintiffs do not seek any unique or \n23  additional benefit from this litigation that may make their interests different from or \n24  adverse to those of absent class members. Instead, Plaintiffs’ aim is to secure \n25  injunctive relief that will protect themselves and the entire class from Defendants’ \n26  challenged practices and enjoin Defendants from further violations. Nor do Plaintiffs \n27  or Class Counsel seek financial gain at the cost of absent class members’ rights. \n28 \n17 \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 81   Filed 07/27/18   Page 27 of 30   Page ID #:1084\n \n1  Accordingly, Plaintiffs lack any antagonism with the class, and their interests align \n2  squarely with the other proposed class members. \n3  5.  The Class Is Sufficiently Ascertainable \nAlthough ascertainability is not required for class certification in the Ninth \n4 \nCircuit, Briseno v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., 844 F.3d 1121, 1133 (9th Cir. 2017), the \n5 \nproposed class is, nevertheless, sufficiently ascertainable because it is \n6 \n“administratively feasible” to ascertain whether an individual is a member.  Greater \n7 \nLos Angeles Agency on Deafness, Inc. v. Reel Servs. Mgmt. LLC, No. 13-cv-7172, \n8 \n2014 WL 12561074, at *5 (C.D. Cal. May 6, 2014) (quotation marks omitted) \n9 \n(finding ascertainable proposed class of individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing \n10 \nand require closed captioning).  Here, membership in the class is defined by clear and \n11 \nobjective criteria: class members were, are, or will be in immigration detention, their \n12 \nchildren were taken from them without a hearing and showing of unfitness, and their \n13 \nchildren were or are held elsewhere by ORR or DHS.  See supra at 3.  These \n14 \nparameters are “precise, objective, and presently ascertainable.”  O’Connor v. Boeing \n15 \nN. Am., Inc., 184 F.R.D. 311, 319 (C.D. Cal. 1998) (quotations omitted) (observing \n16 \nthat class definitions for actions maintained under Rule 23(b)(2) involve less precision \n17 \nthan actions for damages requiring notice to the class); see also, e.g., Lamumba Corp. \n18 \nv. City of Oakland, No. 05-cv-2712, 2007 WL 3245282, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 2, \n19 \n2007) (“Plaintiffs putative class is based on the objective factors of business \n20 \nownership, race, and indebtedness to the City, and therefore is sufficiently defined.”).  \n21 \nThe fact that some administrative process may be required to identify class members \n22 \ndoes not undermine ascertainability. See, e.g., Moreno v. Napolitano, No. 11-cv- \n23 \n5452, 2014 WL 4911938, at *6-7 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 30, 2014) (finding that the necessity \n24 \nof manually reviewing tens of thousands of detainer forms to identify class members \n25 \ndid not undermine ascertainability) (citing Young v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 693 \n26 \nF.3d 532, 539 (6th Cir. 2012)). \n27 \n28 \n18 \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 81   Filed 07/27/18   Page 28 of 30   Page ID #:1085\n \n1  B.  This Action Satisfies the Requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) \n2  In addition to satisfying the four requirements of Rule 23(a), a class must also \n3  come within one of the subsections of Rule 23(b).  Certification of a class under Rule \n4  23(b)(2) requires that “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on \n5  grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or \n6  corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.” Fed. \n7  R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  In the Ninth Circuit, “[i]t is sufficient” to meet Rule 23(b)(2)’s \n8  requirements that “class members complain of a pattern or practice that is generally \n9  applicable to the class as a whole.” Walters, 145 F.3d at 1047. Indeed, Rule “23(b)(2) \n10  was adopted in order to permit the prosecution of civil rights actions” like this one. Id. \n11  “‘The key to the (b)(2) class is the indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory \n12  remedy warranted—the notion that the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or \n13  declared unlawful only as to all of the class members or as to none of them.’” Lyon v. \n14  ICE, 308 F.R.D. 203, 213 (N.D. Cal. 2015) (quoting Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2557). \n15  Rule 23(b)(2)’s requirements are met here.  Plaintiffs ask the Court for \n16  declaratory and injunctive relief to remedy the harm inflicted on the proposed class \n17  members and their minor children by Defendants’ practice—common to all class \n18  members—of forcibly separating them from their children without a hearing and \n19  showing that they are unfit or present a danger to their children and failing to provide \n20  adequate family based mental health evaluations and care for this traumatic event.  If \n21  Defendants’ failure to provide adequate mental health services to parents and children \n22  traumatized by Defendants’ unconstitutional family separation practice violates \n23  substantive due process or the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment, it \n24  does so as to all proposed class members.  A single injunction would protect both \n25  Plaintiffs and the other class members from this same practice and would provide \n26  relief to Plaintiffs and the other class members through mental-health screenings and \n27  appropriate trauma-informed remedial medical and mental-health services. See, e.g., \n28  Walters, 145 F.3d at 1047 (certifying Rule 23(b)(2) class based on Defendants’ \n19 \nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 81   Filed 07/27/18   Page 29 of 30   Page ID #:1086\n \n1  practice of providing deficient notice of deportation procedures). \n2  This relief would benefit Plaintiffs as well as all members of the proposed class \n3  in the same fashion. No individual class member would be entitled to a different \n4  injunction or declaratory judgment. The requested relief would address these policies \n5  or practices in a single stroke, and, therefore, the proposed class warrants certification \n6  under Rule 23(b)(2). See Parsons, 754 F.3d at 689 (finding declaratory and injunctive \n7  relief proper as to the whole class where “every [member] in the proposed class is \n8  allegedly suffering the same (or at least a similar) injury and that injury can be \n9  alleviated for every class member by uniform changes in . . . policy and practice”). \n10  Because Plaintiffs and proposed class members all have suffered or will suffer \n11  the same constitutional violations as a result of the government’s challenged practice, \n12  and because they seek singular injunctive and corresponding declaratory relief that \n13  remedy those injuries, certification under Rule 23(b)(2) is proper. \n14  IV.  CONCLUSION \n15  Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court grant this Motion and enter an \n16  order certifying the proposed class under Rule 23(b)(2); appoint Plaintiffs as Class \n17  Representatives; and appoint the Plaintiffs’ counsel from Public Counsel and Sidley \n18  Austin LLP as Class Counsel. \n19   \nDated:  July 27, 2018  Respectfully Submitted, \n20 \n  /s/ Amy P.

This complaint challenges the federal government’s infliction of \n3 enormous emotional trauma on immigrant families through its extraordinary, \n4 deliberate, and needless policy of separating parents from their children without a \n5 showing of that the parents are unfit, and then holding the parents and children each in \n6 separate detention with no access to one another.  This family separation policy \n7 inflicts severe harm on Plaintiffs and their children and violates their Fifth \n8 Amendment rights to due process and equal protection.  To remedy these \n9 constitutional violations and address the severe harm from trauma the government has \n10 inflicted, Plaintiffs and their children are entitled to appropriate screening and trauma-\n11 informed and family-centered mental-health services under conditions conducive to \n12 effective treatment.  \n13 2.  Leading trauma experts agree that forcible separation of children from \n14 their parents is a traumatic event that can have both immediate and long-term \n15 psychological consequences if left unaddressed by professional care.  As one expert \n16 explains, “[s]eparation of a child from his/her mother would be a traumatic event for \n17 both the child/adolescent and for the mother and father, causing … [p]anic and terror, \n18 frightening dreams, flashbacks, dissociation (blanking out and lack of awareness), \n19 depersonalization (sense of unreality and separation from oneself), withdrawal into \n20 intense grief and depression, an ongoing sense of fear and terror.”1  Acute \n21 psychological distress from separation not only produces mental symptoms such as \n22 anxiety and depression but also has serious consequences for the physical health of \n23 parent and child as well as for child development. \n24 3.  The circumstances of separation under the government’s policy—\n25 including the lack of information on the children’s whereabouts, the inability of \n26 parents and children to communicate with each other, their detention in crowded \n27 facilities with poor food and round-the-clock lighting, the extended nature of the \n                                         \n28 1 Declaration of Marti Loring, ¶ 8. \n  1 \n COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 1   Filed 07/12/18   Page 5 of 64   Page ID #:5\n \n1 separation, and the lack of procedures for and information about reunification, all \n2 coupled with the stressors and trauma that initially led the families to flee their homes \n3 and that they may have experienced on their journey—further exacerbates the trauma \n4 and distress inflicted on the families.  According to trauma experts, “[w]hen the \n5 separation is sudden and frightening, when it is initiated by adults unknown to the \n6 child, when the parent has no opportunity to prepare the child, when it is done \n7 forcefully, and when there is no or minimal contact between the child and parent after \n8 and during the separation, then the distress will be greater and the effects significantly \n9 more damaging to the child.”2 \n10 4.  Plaintiffs in this case are three mothers who have been separated from \n11 their minor children under the family separation policy and have been held in \n12 detention by the federal government.  Each Plaintiff came to the United States with a \n13 child under the age of 18, fleeing from persecution in her native country, and seeking \n14 asylum here as permitted under the laws of the United States.  They have been \n15 detained separately from their children.  Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of all \n16 similarly situated parents.   \n17 5.  Defendants are each charged with faithfully executing the laws of the \n18 United States.  Nonetheless, Defendants have adopted their family separation policy \n19 with the deliberate objective of defying these laws and deterring families from Central \n20 America from seeking asylum.  The policy is a component of Defendants’ racially-\n21 motivated effort to stem immigration from non-European countries.   \n22 6.  Defendants implemented their cruel policy in a chaotic manner.  They \n23 subjected parents already fleeing violence and persecution in their home countries to \n24 one of the most brutal traumas: forced separation from their children.  Parents and \n25 children were torn away from each other with little explanation.  Guards mocked \n26 children and parents for their tears.  Parents received little or no information about \n27                                          \n2 Declaration of Kenneth Berrick, John Sprinson & Kevin Campbell, ¶ 16 (hereinafter \n28 “Berrick Decl.”). \n  2 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 1   Filed 07/12/18   Page 6 of 64   Page ID #:6\n \n1 their children’s whereabouts or well-being, and no explanation as to when or whether \n2 they would ever see their children again.   \n3 7.  The harms inflicted by the family separation policy were avoidable.  In \n4 the past, the federal government found alternatives to family separation, including the \n5 release of parents and children.  In those rare cases where release on recognizance is \n6 insufficient, there are a variety of effective programs to ensure attendance at court \n7 hearings and other proceedings.  For instance, under the Family Case Management \n8 Program, the government released asylum-seeking parents and children together.  In \n9 this program, which costs far less than detention, immigrants appeared for their \n10 removal hearings over 99% of the time.   \n11 8.  Defendants’ policy of family separation during detention was thus a new \n12 and gratuitous injury inflicted solely to terrify immigrant parents and children, deter \n13 other refugees from seeking asylum, and extract political concessions.  Executive \n14 Order No. 13841, which summarily and prospectively terminates the family separation \n15 policy, confirms that the policy of separating parents and children was never required \n16 by law.   \n17 9.  Indeed, on June 26, 2018, the United States District Court for the \n18 Southern District of California enjoined the federal government’s unjustifiable policy, \n19 finding a likelihood that the policy violates the Constitution.  See Ms. L v. U.S. \n20 Immigration & Customs Enf’t, 18-cv-0428, 2018 WL 3129486 (S.D. Cal. June 26, \n21 2018).  The court recognized that the putative class of migrant parents was likely to \n22 succeed on the due process challenge because the federal government was separating \n23 children from their parents without any finding that the parents were unfit or presented \n24 a danger to their children.  Id. at *7.  Additionally, the court found that the \n25 government’s policy “was implemented without any effective system or procedure for \n26 (1) tracking the children after they were separated from their parents, (2) enabling \n27 communication between the parents and their children after separation, and (3) \n28 reuniting the parents and children after the parents are returned to immigration \n  3 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 1   Filed 07/12/18   Page 7 of 64   Page ID #:7\n \n1 custody following completion of their criminal sentence.”  Id.  As a result, the court \n2 ordered the government to reunify all class member parents with their children under \n3 five years old by July 10, 2018, and with all their children by July 26, 2018.  Id. at \n4 *12. \n5 10.  Despite indicating on July 5, 2018 that it would comply with the court-\n6 imposed deadlines,3 the federal government sought clarification and/or relief from \n7 these deadlines later the same day.  See Ms. L v. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enf’t, \n8 No. 18-cv-428, ECF No. 86 (S.D. Cal. July 5, 2018).  As of July 9, 2018, Defendants \n9 had reunited only four of the approximately 100 children under the age of five who \n10 have been separated from their parents.4  On July 10, 2018, the district court issued a \n11 number of rulings related to the reunification process and stated that “[w]ith these \n12 rulings, the Court anticipates the Government will be reuniting fifty-nine (59) Class \n13 Members with their children by the end of the day today,” i.e., July 10, 2018, in \n14 addition to the four parents and children already reunified.5   \n15 11.  Defendants have also contended that they require relief from the Flores \n16 Settlement sufficient to detain asylum-seeking parents and children indefinitely in \n17 substandard unlicensed detention centers.  On July 9, 2018, the District Court for the \n18 Central District of California rejected this argument entirely.  See Flores v. Sessions, \n19 No. CV 85-4544-DMG, ECF No. 455 (C.D. Cal. July 9, 2018).  The Court found that \n20 Defendants’ arguments turned on “a tortured interpretation of the Flores Agreement” \n21 that would render key provisions “meaningless,” and that “[a]bsolutely nothing [in the \n22 Ms. L order or the Flores Settlement] prevents Defendants from reconsidering their \n23 current blanket policy of family detention and reinstating prosecutorial discretion.”  \n                                         \n24\n3 See Merrit Kennedy, Trump Administration Says It Will Comply with Family \nReunification Deadlines, NPR (July 5, 2018) (reporting statements of Defendant Alex \n25\nM. Azar II), https://www.npr.org/2018/07/05/626216102/trump-administration-says-\nit-will-comply-with-family-reunification-deadlines. \n26\n4 See Ms. L v. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enf’t, No. 18-cv-428, ECF No. 101 (S.D. \n27 Cal. July 10, 2018).   \n5 Id. \n28\n  4 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 1   Filed 07/12/18   Page 8 of 64   Page ID #:8\n \n1 Id. at 5.  Indeed, the Court concluded that “it is apparent that Defendants’ Application \n2 is a cynical attempt … to shift responsibility to the Judiciary for over 20 years of \n3 Congressional inaction and ill-considered Executive action that have led to the current \n4 stalemate.”  Id. at 7.  As a result, the Court denied the application as “procedurally \n5 improper and wholly without merit.”  Id.  \n6 12.  These decisions make clear that Defendants’ efforts to avoid their legal \n7 responsibilities are unacceptable.  Plaintiffs have been harmed by Defendants’ \n8 unconstitutional family separation policy and have further suffered from Defendants’ \n9 failure to prepare for that policy shift.  Defendants must remedy this crisis of their \n10 own making.  What is needed is for the government to act promptly and to remedy the \n11 significant harms that it has caused by reunifying the separated families and providing \n12 immediate and appropriate mental-health services under conditions conducive to \n13 effective treatment as required under the Constitution and the Flores Settlement.   \n14 13.  Plaintiffs and their children are entitled to these services for three \n15 separate reasons.  First, under the Due Process Clause, the government has an \n16 obligation to provide adequate medical care, including mental-health services, to \n17 individuals that it detains against their will.  See, e.g., Wakefield v. Thompson, 177 \n18 F.3d 1160, 1164 (9th Cir. 1999); Gibson v. Cty. of Washoe, Nev., 290 F.3d 1175, 1188 \n19 (9th Cir. 2002), overruled on other grounds by Castro v. Cty. of Los Angeles, 833 F.3d \n20 1060 (en banc) (9th Cir. 2016).   \n21 14.  Second, the egregious and gratuitous family separation policy has \n22 directly caused Plaintiffs’ injuries that only appropriate mental-health services can \n23 remedy, and thus, Defendants have an obligation to provide those services.  See, e.g., \n24 Kennedy v. City of Ridgefield, 439 F.3d 1055, 1061 (9th Cir. 2006) (citing, inter alia, \n25 DeShaney v. Winnebago Cty. Dep’t of Soc. Serv., 489 U.S. 189, 197 (1989)).   \n26 15.  Third, under the Flores Settlement, the government must provide \n27 noncitizen children detained in immigration custody with “[a]ppropriate routine \n28 medical and dental care” and “appropriate mental health interventions when \n  5 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 1   Filed 07/12/18   Page 9 of 64   Page ID #:9\n \n1 necessary.”  Flores Settlement, Ex. 1, ¶ 2.  In these circumstances, where the \n2 government has inflicted trauma through family separation, those services must \n3 include appropriate mental-health screenings and any services deemed necessary by \n4 medical professionals, including family counseling, under conditions conducive to \n5 effective treatment. \n6 Plaintiff Ms. J.P.6 \n7 16.  Plaintiff Ms. J. P. (“Ms. P”) is the 37-year-old mother of 16-year-old L.P. \n8 Ms. P is currently being detained in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs \n9 Enforcement (“ICE”) at the James A. Musick Facility in Irvine, California.  Her \n10 daughter, L.P., is currently being held at Casa Phoenix, a Southwest Key Programs, \n11 Inc., facility in Phoenix, Arizona. \n12 17.  Ms. P entered the United States with her daughter near San Luis, \n13 Arizona, on or around May 17, 2018, after having fled Guatemala in fear for her life. \n14 Ms. P sought to escape death threats from a former partner who had sexually abused \n15 and beaten Ms. P.  Ms. P and L.P. were detained by U.S. Customs and Border \n16 Protection (“CBP”) officers shortly after crossing the border.  Ms. P’s native \n17 language, Q’eqchi’, is a Mayan dialect that is rarely spoken in the United States.  She \n18 cannot speak or understand English, and understands very little Spanish.  As a result, \n19 Ms. P was not able communicate with the CBP officers who detained her and L.P.   \n20 18.  Upon their detention, CBP officials placed Ms. P and L.P. in a cold, \n21 windowless room alongside approximately 150 other detainees.  There were no beds, \n22 showers, or private toilets, and the lights were on 24 hours a day.  The room was too \n23 crowded to allow them to lie down, and they were provided only nylon blankets.  Ms. \n24 P and L.P. were fed nothing but lukewarm soup for days, and the only water available \n25 was from the bathroom tap.  L.P. recalls witnessing other children forcibly taken from \n26\n                                         \n6 See Declaration of J.P. (“J.P. Decl.”); Declaration of Alejandra Acuña (“Acuña \n27\nDecl.”); Declaration of Chandra Allen (“Allen Decl.”); Declaration of Lucero Chavez \nre. L.P. (“Chavez L.P. Decl.”). \n28\n  6 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 1   Filed 07/12/18   Page 10 of 64   Page ID #:10\n \n1 their parents’ arms, and seeing a mother being physically restrained by guards as her \n2 son was taken away.  Guards at the facility taunted mothers, saying:  “If you’re such a \n3 good mother why would you bring your child here.”   \n4 19.  Ms. P and L.P. were not told if or when they would be released.  L.P. was \n5 questioned without her mother and given papers to sign in English, which she does not \n6 speak or read.  On or around May 20, 2018, officers came in and took L.P. away from \n7 Ms. P.  L.P. fainted in terror when she realized what was happening, causing injury to \n8 her mouth that left her face swollen for several days.  This cut was not treated until \n9 L.P. was moved to Southwest Key Programs.  Ms. P was not told or able to \n10 understand why her daughter was being taken, where she was going, or when—or if—\n11 she would see her daughter again. \n12 20.  On June 1, 2018, with the assistance of a fellow detainee, Ms. P \n13 submitted a request to ICE seeking information on her daughter’s whereabouts.  Ms. P \n14 can neither read nor write, and was not able to understand the written response that \n15 she received several days later, which, in any event, contained only her daughter’s \n16 location and not a telephone number or other way to reach her daughter.  Ms. P had no \n17 contact with her daughter until June 22, 2018, when, after 30 hours of advocacy by her \n18 attorney, she was allowed to speak with L.P. by phone.  Until then, Ms. P feared that \n19 she would never see or speak to her daughter again.  She still fears that she faces \n20 certain death if she is forced to return to Guatemala, and remains worried that she will \n21 be deported and separated from her daughter.  Ms. P believes that she has been to \n22 court, but does not understand the purpose or substance of the court hearings that she \n23 attended.   \n24 21.  L.P. says that she has felt isolated during this period.  She has been kept \n25 hundreds of miles from her mother, and her only regular contact is with a counselor \n26 whom she sees once a week but who tells her not to cry even though L.P. feels crying \n27 helps her cope with the situation.  She feels depressed, hopeless, and confused by her \n28 detention and separation.  She cannot speak about her mother or the experience of \n  7 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 1   Filed 07/12/18   Page 11 of 64   Page ID #:11\n \n1 separation without crying.  She dreams of her mother and prays to be reunited with \n2 her.  According to according to a family member, L.P. “[i]s suffering without her \n3 mother.”  Declaration of C.I., ¶ 3. \n4 22.  Based on the preliminary evaluation of a licensed clinical social worker, \n5 Chandra Allen, L.P shows signs of depression, anxiety, adjustment to trauma, and \n6 traumatic grief.  L.P.’s constant uncertainty as to her situation and whether she will be \n7 reunited with her mother could lead to dissociative detachment and anxiety.   \n8 23.  Ms. P reports almost always having upsetting thoughts about being \n9 separated from her daughter, and repeatedly experiences bad dreams or nightmares.  \n10 She has significant difficulty sleeping and concentrating since L.P. was taken from \n11 her, and reports crying four times a day.  Based on the preliminary evaluation of a \n12 licensed clinical social worker, Alejandra Acuña, Ms. P is displaying symptoms of \n13 post-traumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”), depression, and anxiety as a result of being \n14 separated from L.P.  Ms. P has not reported having access to mental-health treatment. \n15 Plaintiff Ms. J.O.7 \n16 24.  Plaintiff Ms. J.O. (“Ms. O”) is the mother of 16-year-old T.B. Ms. O and \n17 her daughter fled their native Honduras in fear for their lives after gangs killed her \n18 husband in 2015 and beat her teenage son.  Ms. O and T.B. entered the United States \n19 near Granjeno, Texas, on or around May 17, 2018.  Rather than continuing into the \n20 interior, Ms. O and her daughter waited along a dirt road for a patrol car to arrive and \n21 flagged one down the next day.  They claimed fear of returning to Honduras and \n22 hoped to live with her sister in the United States.   \n23 25.  Ms. O and T.B. were processed separately and kept apart at the detention \n24 center that Ms. O called “La Hielera”—the icebox—because of the cold temperature \n25 inside.  While there, Ms. O was moved to “La Perrera,” the doghouse, section of the \n26 facility where the holding cells resemble dog kennels.  During this transfer, Ms. O saw \n                                         \n27\n7 See Declaration of J.O. (“J.O. Decl.”); Declaration of Lucero Chavez re. T.B. \n(“Chavez T.B. Decl.”). \n28\n  8 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 1   Filed 07/12/18   Page 12 of 64   Page ID #:12\n \n1 a young child taken from his mother, and the guards told the parents that a new law \n2 permitted them to take away their children permanently.  This statement terrified the \n3 parents, including Ms. O who feared she would be separated from T.B. forever. \n4 26.  Ms. O was kept in a holding cell with over 50 other women.  There were \n5 no beds or pillows, and the lights were kept on 24 hours per day.  Ms. O was provided \n6 a piece of bread and a juice box for food.  From her cell, she could see T.B. in a \n7 similar chain-link cell with other children, some no more than five years old.  Because \n8 there were no adults in the cell, the older children were forced to care for the younger \n9 ones.  T.B., for instance, braided the younger girls’ hair to provide them with some \n10 comfort.  During her time at La Hielera, Ms. O was moved from cell to cell.  But each \n11 cell was overcrowded, and at no time was she placed with her daughter.  Ms. O was \n12 not provided clean clothes or permitted to shower for the five days that she was in the \n13 facility.  She slept little, if at all, due to the cold temperature, 24-hour-a-day lighting, \n14 and her and others’ constant crying. \n15 27.  Ms. O spoke to T.B. once more in the facility, when they passed each \n16 other on the way to the restroom.  T.B. urged Ms. O not to sign deportation papers, \n17 fearing that Ms. O would be returned to Honduras without her.   \n18 28.  Ms. O’s time in La Hielera separated from T.B. was traumatizing.  She \n19 lost track of which day it was, and the constant exposure to crying parents and \n20 children left her shaken.  \n21 29.  On or about May 21, 2018, Ms. O was taken with more than 50 other \n22 detainees to court for criminal proceedings.  Ms. O was told that she was to be \n23 charged with illegal entry in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1325(a)(1).  Like the 35 people \n24 before her, she pleaded guilty, though she was not able to meet with an attorney \n25 before the proceedings and she did not understand the consequences of her plea.   \n26 30.  After these proceedings, CBP explained that Ms. O would be transferred \n27 to another facility without her daughter.  On or about May 21, 2018, Ms. O was \n28 moved to the SeaTac Federal Prison in SeaTac, Washington, and subsequently \n  9 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 1   Filed 07/12/18   Page 13 of 64   Page ID #:13\n \n1 transferred to the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, Washington.  On July 12, \n2 2018, Ms. O was released on bond. \n3 31.  Ms. O has not seen her daughter since approximately May 21, 2018 when \n4 Ms. O was moved to SeaTac.  For nine days thereafter, Ms. O was unable to obtain \n5 any information regarding her daughter, despite multiple pleas to immigration \n6 officials.  Ms. O did not learn of T.B.’s whereabouts until May 30, 2018.  She learned \n7 from her sister that T.B. is currently being detained in Southwest Key Programs, \n8 Inc.—Casa Antigua in San Benito, Texas. Ms. O has since spoken with her daughter \n9 only three times for less than five minutes per call.  Ms. O has attempted to call a \n10 social worker to set up further calls, but the social worker has not answered the phone.   \n11 32.  To date, Ms. O has not received any mental-health or counseling services \n12 from the government to address the trauma she has experienced due to the separation \n13 from her daughter. \n14 Plaintiff Ms. R.M.8 \n15 33.  Plaintiff Ms. R. M. (“Ms. M”) and her 15-year-old daughter, S.Q., fled El \n16 Salvador to get away from Ms. M’s husband, a former military officer, who had \n17 severely beaten her and threatened her life, and in fear of gangs who have threatened \n18 S.Q.  On or around May 18, 2018, Ms. M and S.Q. entered the United States near \n19 Hidalgo, Texas.  Ms. M and her daughter waited under a tree and flagged down a \n20 patrol car.  They claimed fear of returning to their country of origin.  \n21 34.  Ms. M and her daughter were immediately taken to a facility and \n22 separated for questioning.  Ms. M was unable to concentrate on the officials’ \n23 questions until she saw where her daughter was taken.  Once she located her daughter \n24 and turned her attention to the officials, they began yelling at her that she would be \n25 deported without her daughter and punished for bringing S.Q. from El Salvador.  Ms. \n26 M. started crying, and one official told her:  “You can thank Trump.”  The officials \n                                         \n27\n8 See Declaration of R.M. (“R.M. Decl.”); Declaration of Lucero Chavez re. S.Q. \n(“Chavez S.Q..

Ms. M refused for fear of being deported without her daughter.  \n3 The officials laughed at her.  The questioning ended only when Ms. M reiterated that \n4 she feared returning to El Salvador. \n5 35.  After this questioning, Ms. M was taken to La Perrera and placed into a \n6 cage with 40 or 50 other women.  They sat shoulder to shoulder on the floor.  They \n7 were not provided beds, mats, pillows, or blankets.  There was only one toilet in the \n8 cell, and it was in the open without walls or a door.  Women would stand to create a \n9 human wall to provide the person using the toilet a small measure of privacy. \n10 36.  Ms. M and the women in her cell were provided a soggy piece of bread, a \n11 frozen piece of ham, and a juice box for sustenance twice a day.  The guards would \n12 also open the cell door and throw crackers on the floor.  When the hungry women \n13 scrambled to pick them up, the guards would laugh.  One time when Ms. M was \n14 standing close to the door, she reached out her hand for a cracker.  Instead of handing \n15 her the cracker, the guard asked, “do you want five-star treatment,” and then threw the \n16 cracker on the floor, saying “there is your room service.”   \n17 37.  Ms. M was also not permitted to brush her teeth for four days, and she \n18 was not given a change of clothes.   \n19 38.  From her cage, Ms. M could see her daughter in a different cage with \n20 other children.  She was not permitted to speak with her, but she could see her \n21 continuously crying.   \n22 39.  On or about May 21, 2018, Ms. M was taken with over 50 detainees \n23 before a judge for criminal proceedings.  Ms. M was told that she was being charged \n24 with illegal entry into the United States pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1325(a)(1).  She was \n25 placed in shackles and handcuffs, and before the proceedings began, a man stood up \n26 and advised the detainees to plead guilty in order to receive a lower sentence.  Ms. M \n27 and the 25 people before her pleaded guilty because she thought that she had to do so.  \n28 She did not understand the consequences of her plea.   \n  11 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 1   Filed 07/12/18   Page 15 of 64   Page ID #:15\n \n1 40.  Following these proceedings, Ms. M was placed on a bus and transferred \n2 to Laredo, Texas.  Ms. M and the other women cried out, asking for their children.  \n3 One guard yelled, “stop asking about your kids!”  Ms. M began crying uncontrollably \n4 once she realized that she was going to be separated from her daughter.  For three \n5 days, she slept no more than one hour per night.  She could not eat and she could not \n6 talk to anyone.  No official told her where her daughter was or even whether she was \n7 safe, though she learned from her mother on May 25, 2018, that her daughter was in \n8 San Benito, Texas at Southwest Key Programs, Inc.—Casa Antigua. \n9 41.  Eventually, Ms. M was transferred to the SeaTac Federal Prison in \n10 SeaTac, Washington.  She was later moved to the Northwest Detention Center in \n11 Tacoma, Washington.  On July 12, 2018, Ms. M was released on bond. \n12 42.  On or about June 22, 2018, Ms. M was finally able to speak with her \n13 daughter for about one minute.  S.Q was crying uncontrollably and could not speak.  \n14 Ms. M has tried to set up additional calls through S.Q.’s social worker, but the social \n15 worker does not answer the phone.   \n16 43.  Ms. M believes that her daughter has suffered significantly due to their \n17 separation and detention and that she will need trauma-based counseling as a result.  \n18 To date, Ms. M has not received any mental-health services from the government to \n19 address the trauma she has experienced due to the separation from her daughter. \n20 44.  Ms. M’s mother—S.T.—is a permanent legal resident in the United \n21 States and has lived here since 1989.  See Declaration of S.T.  Based on her \n22 conversations with her daughter and granddaughter, she believes that their separation \n23 has been traumatic for them.  Additionally, she is “ready, willing, and able to take care \n24 of, and provide a home for[,] both R.M. and S.Q. at any time, and [is] committed to \n25 doing what [she] can to have R.M. released and to support her while she is in the \n26 United States.”  Id. ¶ 15. \n27\n28\n  12 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 1   Filed 07/12/18   Page 16 of 64   Page ID #:16\n \n1 Defendants \n2 45.

This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 \n16 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1346, and 2241 because this action arises under the Constitution and \n17 laws of the United States. \n18 59.  Sovereign immunity does not bar claims against federal officials seeking \n19 solely to prevent future violations of federal law (rather than monetary relief).  See, \n20 e.g., Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 697-99 & nn.18-\n21 19 (1949); Shields v. Utah Idaho Cent. R.R. Co., 305 U.S. 177, 183-84 (1938); 5 \n22 U.S.C. § 702. \n23 60.  Venue is proper in the Central District of California under 28 U.S.C. \n24 §§ 84(c) and 1391(e)(1) because at least one plaintiff resides in this judicial district \n25 and each defendant is an agency of the United States or an officer of the United States \n26 sued in his or her official capacity.   \n27 61.  The Court has authority to provide declaratory relief under 28 U.S.C. \n28 §§ 2201-2202. \n  14 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 1   Filed 07/12/18   Page 18 of 64   Page ID #:18\n \n1 STATUTORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK \n2 U.S. Law Permits Families to Seek Asylum upon Arrival \n3 62.  The laws of the United States permit non-citizens on American soil to \n4 seek asylum regardless of how, or where, or with whom they arrive at the border.  \n5 Specifically, these laws establish that “[a]ny alien” who arrives in the United States, \n6 “whether or not at a designated port of arrival” may apply for asylum “irrespective of \n7 such alien’s status.” 8 U.S.C. § 1158. \n8 63.  Statutes that govern the process for seeking asylum in the United States \n9 have their roots in the refugee crisis that followed World War II.  They incorporate \n10 concepts from international law (see, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 101(a)(42) (incorporating the \n11 definition of “refugee” from the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of \n12 Refugees)), and provide a process for individuals who fear persecution in their native \n13 countries to seek protection in the United States (see, e.g., Refugee Act of 1980, Pub. \n14 L. No. 96-212 § 201(b), 94 Stat. 102 (1980)).   \n15 64.  The United States does not limit the right to seek asylum to those who \n16 cross into the country at a port of entry.  Those apprehended for the first time crossing \n17 into the United States outside a port of entry may be subject to expedited removal, a \n18 process under which an individual may be removed from the United States without a \n19 full hearing before an immigration judge.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i).  But there \n20 are safeguards to protect those seeking asylum in that context.  If an individual \n21 “indicates either an intention to apply for asylum . . . or a fear of persecution,” \n22 immigration officers must refer the individual “for an interview by an asylum officer” \n23 to evaluate whether the individual has a credible fear of persecution if returned to their \n24 country.  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii).   \n25 65.  If an asylum officer concludes that there is a “significant possibility” the \n26 individual can prove eligibility for asylum, the asylum seeker receives a positive \n27 credible fear determination and is placed into regular removal proceedings.  During \n28 those regular removal proceedings, the putative refugee may submit an asylum \n  15 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 1   Filed 07/12/18   Page 19 of 64   Page ID #:19\n \n1 application, obtain a hearing before an immigration judge, and appeal an adverse \n2 decision through the Board of Immigration Appeals and the federal courts.  8 U.S.C. \n3 § 1225 (b)(1)(B)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 235.6(a)(1)(ii), (iii).   \n4 66.  An asylum seeker may also be placed directly into regular removal \n5 proceedings with issuance of a Notice to Appear for a future hearing date.  See 8 \n6 U.S.C. §§ 1225(b)(2), 1229(a)(1), 1229a.   \n7 67.  No law requires the detention of asylum seekers throughout this process, \n8 and no law requires the prolonged separation of families either. \n9 The Flores Settlement Sets Standards for Housing and Providing Services to \n10 Detained Children \n11 68.  When the government detains children, it must comply with the Flores \n12 Settlement, regardless of whether the children arrive unaccompanied or with their \n13 families.  Flores v. Lynch, 828 F.3d 898 (9th Cir. 2016). \n14 69.  The Flores Settlement requires the government to “place each detained \n15 minor in the least restrictive setting appropriate to the minor’s age and special needs.”  \n16 Settlement ¶ 11.  Children should generally be released within five days to one of the \n17 following recipients, in order of preference:  a parent, a legal guardian, an adult \n18 relative, an adult designated by a parent or legal guardian, or, if no such individuals \n19 are available, a licensed program willing to accept legal custody.  Id. ¶¶ 12, 14.  In the \n20 event of an “emergency” or an “influx” of minors into the country, the government is \n21 required to place minors “as expeditiously as possible.”  Id. ¶ 12.C.  The Flores court \n22 found that up to 20 days may be as expeditious as possible for the government under \n23 extenuating circumstances, a time frame that has been widely reported in the press.   \n24 70.  The government must “make and record the prompt and continuous \n25 efforts on its part toward family reunification and the release of the minor,” and \n26 “[s]uch efforts at family reunification shall continue so long as the minor is in [the \n27 government’s] custody.”  Settlement ¶ 18. \n28\n  16 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 1   Filed 07/12/18   Page 20 of 64   Page ID #:20\n \n1 71.  When the government transfers a detained minor to any person or entity \n2 other than a parent, guardian, adult relative, or a parent or guardian’s designee, such \n3 person or entity is required to be “licensed by an appropriate State agency to provide \n4 residential, group, or foster care services for dependent children.”  Settlement ¶ 6.  \n5 Any such licensed person or entity to which the government transfers a minor is \n6 required to meet certain additional standards, as described in Exhibit 1 of the Flores \n7 Settlement. \n8 72.  Among other services, licensed programs must provide “appropriate \n9 mental health interventions when necessary,” “identification of the minor’s special \n10 needs including any specific problem(s) which require immediate intervention,” “[a]t \n11 least one (1) individual counseling session per week conducted by trained social work \n12 staff,” “[g]roup counseling,” and “[v]isitation and contact with family members \n13 (regardless of their immigration status).”  Settlement, Exhibit 1. \n14 73.  The government is required by the Flores Settlement to “treat minors \n15 with dignity, respect, and special concern for their particular vulnerability.”  \n16 Settlement, Exhibit 2.  The government is further required to “hold minors in a facility \n17 that is safe and sanitary and that is consistent with . . . the particular vulnerability of \n18 minors.”  Id.  Any such facility in which minors are held by the government following \n19 arrest must provide for “contact with family members who were arrested with the \n20 minor.”  Id.9 \n21\n22\n23\n24\n                                         \n25\n9 On June 21, 2018, the government requested relief from the Flores Settlement so as \nto permit it to detain minors who are arrested with their parents indefinitely through \n26\nthe pendency of their immigration proceedings, in facilities unlicensed by any state \nauthority.  Flores v. Sessions, No. 85-cv-04544, Dkt. 435 (C.D. Cal. Jun. 21, 2018).  \n27\nThe Court rejected this request as “procedurally improper and wholly without merit.”  \nFlores v.

Defendants have falsely claimed that the family separation policy was \n4\nrequired by existing law. 10  Their position is belied by the June 20, 2018 Executive \n5\nOrder ending the policy on a prospective basis.  It is also belied by the practice of \n6\nprior administrations11 and the undeniable existence of effective alternatives.  \n7\n75.  Several alternatives to detention would allow asylum seekers and their \n8\nfamilies to remain together.  For example, in recent years community supported \n9\nmodels have proven particularly effective and economical.  For many migrants, \n10\nrelease on recognizance is sufficient to ensure that they attend court hearings and \n11\nother proceedings. 12 \n12\n76.  In other cases, case management programs have proven effective. Indeed, \n13\nthe American Academy of Pediatrics (“AAP”) endorses community-based case \n14\nmanagement as an alternative solution to detention.13  Beginning on January 21, 2016, \n15\nthe Family Case Management Program (“FCMP”) was offered as an “alternative to \n16\ndetention . . . that use[d] qualified case managers to promote participant compliance \n17\nwith their immigration obligations.”14 The program used a wrap-around services \n18\n                                         \n19\n10 Linda Qiu, Fact-Checking the Trump Administration’s Case for Child Separation at \n20 the Border, N.Y.

The FCMP was designed, but not limited, to serve victims of domestic \n6 violence or sexual abuse, pregnant women, nursing mothers, and families with \n7 physical and/or mental illness. The FCMP operated in five cities across the United \n8 States: Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, and New York.  The program \n9 allowed families for whom detention in ICE centers or more traditional alternative \n10 programs would exacerbate their trauma or illness to exit detention into the \n11 community while they moved through their immigration proceedings. The program \n12 facilitated access to holistic community-based services tailored to each family’s needs, \n13 including:17 \n14 •  Orientation and education for participants about their legal rights and \n15 responsibilities; \n16 •  Individualized family service plans; \n17 •  Assistance in accessing low-cost or pro bono legal assistance for housing, \n18 education, and—as most relevant here—mental health providers (if \n19 needed); \n20 •  Assistance with transportation logistics; \n21\n                                         \n15 Id.; see also Loiselle, Mary F., GEO Care’s New Family Case Management \n22\nProgram,” GEO World, at 3 (2016), available at \nhttps://www.geogroup.com/userfiles/1de79aa6-2ff2-4615-a997-7869142237bd.pdf. \n23\n16 Elise Foley & Jennifer Bendery, This Alternative to Detaining Immigrant Families \n24 Works.

It was a step forward in procuring dignity for immigrant \n6 families, and it satisfied ICE’s primary goal of ensuring compliance with participants’ \n7 immigration obligations—99% for ICE check-ins and appointments, and 100% for \n8 attendance at court hearings.18   \n9 78.  Despite its success in terms of the government’s stated compliance \n10 priorities, the program was closed in June 2017.   \n11  “Zero Tolerance” Family Separation Policy Rationalized as Deterrent \n12 79.  On May 7, 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a “zero-\n13 tolerance” policy of forced family separation to deter migrants from crossing the \n14 southern border of the United States.  Sessions said, “If you cross this border \n15 unlawfully, then we will prosecute you.  It’s that simple. . . .  If you are smuggling a \n16 child, then we will prosecute you and that child will be separated from you. . . .”19   \n17 80.  The family separation policy was by no means limited to “smugglers.”  \n18 In the first month of the policy, nearly 3,000 children were separated from their \n19 parents while crossing the border.20  Some children were as young as 18 months old, \n20\n21\n                                         \n22\n18 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Award of the Family Case \nManagement Program Contract (Redacted).

The children are often \n4 housed hundreds of miles away from their parents.  There are an estimated 100 \n5 shelters in 17 states, including Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, \n6 Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, \n7 Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, and Washington.22  Of course, \n8 separation of a mere mile between a child and parent is a terrifying situation for both \n9 when there is no certainty of where the parent or child is being kept and no guarantee \n10 that the two ever will be reunited. \n11 81.  Defendants have mischaracterized family separation as necessary to \n12 enforce the law.  But DHS expressly contemplated using family separation to deter \n13 migration from Central America into the United States at least a year before the “zero \n14 tolerance” policy was adopted.23  In March 2017, then-DHS Secretary John Kelly \n15 confirmed that family separation was under consideration as a means to deter \n16 migration across the southern border.  After experts and members of Congress \n17 strongly opposed the idea, DHS Secretary Kelly testified in April 2017 that DHS \n18 would not “routinely” separate children from their families at the border, except under \n19 extenuating circumstances.24  Nevertheless, non-profit organizations observed a trend \n                                         \n20\n21 Caitlin Dickerson, Hundreds of Immigrant Children Have Been Taken From \n21 Parents at U.S. Border, N.Y.

In his words, “a big name of the game is \n6 deterrence.”25 \n7 Separated Families Held Hostage to Exact Political Concessions \n8 83.  As the horrors of family separation reached the media, President Trump \n9 insisted that he would not change the policy unless lawmakers agreed to his \n10 immigration reform demands.26  He asserted that if lawmakers had passed the \n11 aggressive anti-immigration legislation he wanted, the policy would be unnecessary.27  \n12 He urged Congress to crack down on asylum seekers, reduce visas, and spend $25 \n13 billion on a border wall.28   \n14 84.

Any \n3 Immigration Bill MUST HAVE full funding for the Wall, end Catch & Release, Visa \n4 Lottery and Chain, and go to Merit Based Immigration.  Go for it!  WIN!”30   \n5 85.  Despite his administration’s previous characterization of the family \n6 separation policy as a means to deter future immigration, President Trump also \n7 advanced the fiction that existing federal law already compelled family separation.  \n8 On June 19, 2018, he said, “[W]e have to get the Democrats to go ahead and work \n9 with us.  Because as a result of Democrat-supported loopholes in our federal laws, \n10 most illegal immigrant families and minors from Central America who arrive \n11 unlawfully at the border cannot be detained together or removed together, only \n12 released.  These are crippling loopholes that cause family separation, which we don’t \n13 want.”31   \n14 86.  As children and parents suffered the consequences of being torn apart \n15 with no certainty that they would ever see each other again, President Trump used \n16 their suffering as a bargaining chip in his political negotiations to advance his broader \n17 anti-immigrant agenda. \n18 Family Separation is Motivated by Racial Animus \n19 87.  The family separation policy was adopted as part of an anti-immigration \n20 agenda that is motivated by racial animus.  On the first day of his presidential \n21 campaign, then-Candidate Trump categorically labeled Mexican immigrants as \n22 criminals and rapists: “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their \n                                         \n23\n29 Linda Qiu, Fact-Checking the Trump Administration’s Case for Child Separation at \n24 the Border, N.Y.

They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re \n3 rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”32  \n4 88.  Three years later, when Chief of Staff Kelly discussed the family \n5 separation policy, he echoed similar sentiments about the categorical undesirability of \n6 migrants from Central America.  “[T]hey’re also not people that would easily \n7 assimilate into the United States into our modern society.  They’re overwhelmingly \n8 rural people in the countries they come from—fourth, fifth, sixth grade educations are \n9 kind of the norm.  They don’t speak English, obviously that’s a big thing.  They don’t \n10 speak English.  They don’t integrate well, they don’t have skills.”33 \n11 89.  The Trump Administration has consistently demonstrated a pattern of \n12 pursuing immigration policies motivated by racial animus toward non-European \n13 immigrants.  For example, in or around June 2017, in a meeting with Secretary of \n14 State Rex Tillerson and then-DHS Secretary Kelly, President Trump reportedly said of \n15 the 15,000 Haitians admitted to the United States, they “all have AIDS.”34  At this \n16 same meeting, the President, after learning that 40,000 people had entered the United \n17 States from Nigeria, reportedly stated that they would never “go back to their huts” in \n18 Africa.35   \n19 90.

President Trump grew frustrated when the conversation turned to \n2 protections for foreign nationals from certain Central American and African countries.  \n3 “Why,” the President asked, “are we having all these people from shithole countries \n4 come here?”36  President Trump asked, “Why do we need more Haitians?”  He \n5 insisted that lawmakers “[t]ake them out” of any potential immigration deal.37  \n6 Instead, he expressed a preference for immigrants from countries like Norway, which \n7 is overwhelmingly white, or from Asian countries, which he felt would help the \n8 United States economically.38   \n9 91.  Senator Dick Durbin, who was present at the January 11, 2018, meeting \n10 in the Oval Office, characterized the President’s “shithole” comments as “clearly \n11 racial,” “hate-filled,” and “vile.”39  Senator Durbin reportedly warned the President \n12 that exclusion of immigrants based on those grounds would be “an obvious racial \n13 decision.”40   \n14 92.

In fact, President Trump explicitly stated on May 16, 2018, “These \n2 aren’t people.  These are animals.” 41   \n3 93.  On June 18, 2018, he again asserted that migrant parents crossing the \n4 border with their children “could be murderers and thieves and so much else.”42  He \n5 also argued that his political opponents “don’t care about crime and want illegal \n6 immigrants, no matter how bad they may be, to pour into and infest our Country, like \n7 MS-13.”43  He refers to migrants, including asylum seekers, as people who “invade \n8 our Country” and who should not receive the process due to them under United States \n9 and international law: “When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no \n10 Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came.”44 \n11 94.  These categorical insults expose the racial animus motivating recent \n12 policies.  Other explanations have proven false and pretextual.  DHS Secretary \n13 Nielsen argued that the policy was necessary due to a marked increase in the number \n14 of adults arriving at the border with children and fraudulently claiming to be a family \n15 unit.  In the last five months, however, less than one percent of families apprehended \n16 at the border fraudulently claimed to be a family unit.45  President Trump has also \n17 claimed that 80 percent of migrants who are released never show up for their \n18\n                                         \n41 Julie H.

Governors from at least eight states announced that they would withhold \n2 or recall National Guard troops from efforts to secure the border in response to the \n3 separation policy.63  North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said that the “cruel policy \n4 of tearing children away from their parents requires a strong response” and that he was \n5 pulling his state’s troops from the border.64  Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker \n6 called the policy “cruel and inhumane.”65 \n7 103.

The government has not provided for a comprehensive and independent \n4 investigation by qualified mental-health professionals into the circumstances under \n5 which Plaintiffs and other asylum-seeking parents were separated from their children \n6 or into the effects of that separation on the families.  Absent relief from this Court, \n7 Plaintiffs, even if eventually reunited with their children, will have no way adequately \n8 to determine and respond to the harms inflicted by the separation policy. \n9 President Trump Issues An Executive Order To Halt Prospective Application Of \n10 Family Separation Policy \n11 109.  Faced with national revulsion at family separation and legislative refusal \n12 to accede to his political demands as the price of ending the policy, President Trump \n13 abruptly changed course. \n14 110.  On June 20, 2018, President Trump issued an executive order entitled \n15 “Affording Congress an Opportunity to Address Family Separation” (“Executive \n16 Order”).77  The Executive Order continued the policy of initiating criminal \n17 proceedings for all who cross the border illegally and called for indefinite detention of \n18 families, including children covered by the Flores Settlement, in camps and makeshift \n19 detention centers.78   \n20 111.  President Trump’s Executive Order did not and could not end the trauma \n21 of family separation.  Most families still have not been reunited.  Parents still do not \n22 know where their children are and, like Plaintiffs, are not able to care for them or even \n23 speak with them.  Traumatized children remain in deplorable detention conditions.  \n24 Some may be lost in the system.  Detention centers “are often unable to locate the \n                                         \n25\n76 Id. \n26 77 Executive Order, Affording Congress an Opportunity to Address Family Separation, \nWHITE HOUSE (June 20, 2018), https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-\n27 actions/affording-congress-opportunity-address-family-separation/. \n78 Id. \n28\n  32 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 1   Filed 07/12/18   Page 36 of 64   Page ID #:36\n \n1 parent of separated children because the children arrive without proper records.”79  \n2 Once a child arrives at a detention center, “there is no firm process in place to \n3 determine whether they have been separated from someone who was legitimately their \n4 parent, or for reuniting parents and children who had been mistakenly separated.”80 \n5 112.  Critically, the Executive Order failed to provide any remediation for the \n6 trauma and devastation unnecessarily inflicted by the government on the children and \n7 parents whom it separated.  To mitigate the negative effects of the trauma suffered, \n8 separated families must be immediately reunited and provided with access to mental \n9 health screenings, and to appropriate and effective intensive trauma treatment services \n10 outside of the traumatizing environment of the current detention environment.81  \n11 Without these remedies, the deleterious impact of forcible separation is debilitating \n12 and causes life-long harm.82 \n13 A System in Utter Chaos and Confusion: Difficulties in Reunification \n14 113.  Because the Executive Order was a surprise to many, further chaos \n15 ensued.  Agencies carrying out the policy received no advanced notice about the major \n16 changes.  And one official who works for ICE said that an internal email about the \n17 Executive Order arrived “literally at the same time that it was breaking on CNN.”83  \n18\n                                         \n19 79 Caitlin Dickerson, Hundreds of Immigrant Children Have Been Taken From \nParents at U.S. Border, N.Y.

Notably, the Executive Order failed to mention what would happen to the \n4 nearly 3,000 children who had been separated from their parents.  There is no reliable \n5 plan in place yet to reunite families.  On the day the Executive Order was issued, a \n6 spokesman for HHS initially said that the government would not try to reunite \n7 separated families, but later backtracked, saying that “it is still very early, and we are \n8 awaiting further guidance on the matter.”85  Anthony Enriquez, director of the \n9 unaccompanied minors program for Catholic Charities, explained, “There is no system \n10 whatsoever to track these family separations, no efforts systemically to reunite these \n11 families.  There is no supervisor, there is no database saying, ‘child here, parent \n12 there,’ so they can come back together.”86  While HHS insists that it “is working with \n13 relevant agency partners to foster communications and work towards reuniting every \n14 minor and every parent or guardian via well-established reunification processes,” very \n15 few details have been released about how HHS will go about reuniting families and \n16 what the timeline is for reunification.87 \n17 115.  Indeed, even after the Executive Order was signed, many parents had still \n18 not spoken with their children and did not know where they were being held.  Parents \n19 report repeatedly calling the government-established hotline number, but nobody \n                                         \n20\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/23/us/migrant-children-federal-agency-\nborder.html. \n21\n84 Michelle Goldberg, They Really Don’t Care About Migrant Families, N.Y.

Compounding the difficulties, detained \n2 parents do not have a phone number where agencies may call them back.88  As a \n3 result, parents and children have no idea if and when they will see each other again.  \n4 One separated parent said, “I feel like I am going to die.  I feel powerless.”89   \n5 116.  Out of pure desperation, some parents have agreed to give up their \n6 asylum claims in the hopes of seeing their children again.  Knowing how desperate \n7 separated parents are, the government has taken advantage of their fears and \n8 vulnerability by encouraging parents to sign voluntary deportation orders in exchange \n9 for the return of their children.  One Honduran detainee agreed to abandon his asylum \n10 case and signed voluntary deportation forms in the hopes of seeing his 6-year-old \n11 daughter again.90 \n12 THE FEDERAL COURTS ENJOIN SIGNIFICANT ASPECTS OF THE \n13 FAMILY SEPARATION POLICY AND REJECT ATTEMPTS TO ALTER \n14 THE FLORES SETTLEMENT \n15 117.  Faced with the government’s inhumane and cruel policy, migrant parents \n16 separated from their children have turned to the federal courts.

See Ms. L, 2018 WL \n5 3129486, at *11-12.  Additionally, the Court ordered the government to reunite \n6 detained parents with the children under the age of five by July 10, 2018, and to \n7 reunite detained parents with their other children by July 26, 2018.  Id. at *12; see also \n8 Souza v. Sessions, No. 18-cv-4412, ECF No. 23 (N.D. Ill. June 28, 2018) (ordering \n9 government to release child to custody of parent). \n10 119.  In providing this relief, the Court had to find first that the parents were \n11 likely to succeed on their Fifth Amendment challenge to the family separation policy.  \n12 The parents argued that “the Government’s practice of separating class members from \n13 their children, and failing to reunite those parents who have been separated, without a \n14 determination that the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child violates the \n15 parents’ substantive due process rights to family integrity.”  Ms. L, 2018 WL 3129486, \n16 at *6.   \n17 120.  The Court agreed with the parents for several reasons.  First, the Court \n18 found that, even when the Executive Branch “is acting within its powers to detain \n19 individuals lawfully entering the United States and to apprehend individuals illegally \n20 entering the country,” “the right to family integrity still applies.”  Id. at *7.  Second, it \n21 recognized that “asylum seekers [like the plaintiffs] may be fleeing persecution and are \n22 entitled to careful consideration by government officials.  Particularly so if they have a \n23 credible fear of persecution.”  Id. To that end, Congress has “plainly stated [the nation’s] \n24 intent  to  treat  refugees  with  an  ordered  process,  and  benevolence,  by  codifying \n25 principles of asylum.”  Id.  But, in its view, “[t]he Government’s treatment of [migrant \n26 parents] does not meet this standard, and it is unlikely to pass constitutional muster.”  \n27 Id.  Third, the Court highlighted that “the practice of separating these families was \n28 implemented without any effective system or procedure for (1) tracking the children \n  36 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 1   Filed 07/12/18   Page 40 of 64   Page ID #:40\n \n1 after they were separated from their parents, (2) enabling communication between the \n2 parents and their children after separation, and (3) reuniting the parents and children \n3 after the parents are returned to immigration custody following completion of their \n4 criminal sentence.”  Id.  In the Court’s words, “[t]his is a startling reality,” particularly \n5 given that the government routinely tracks detained individuals’ personal property with \n6 efficiency and accuracy.  Id.  The Court concluded these practices, taken together, \n7 “shock the conscience” and are likely inconsistent with due process. \n8 121.  The Court also found that “the Ninth Circuit has repeatedly found” that \n9 “separation of a parent from his or her child” “constitutes irreparable harm.”  Id. at *9 \n10 (citing Leiva-Perez v. Holder, 640 F.3d 962, 969-70 (9th Cir. 2011); Washington v. \n11 Trump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1169 (9th Cir. 2017)).  The Court also determined that the \n12 injuries inflicted by the family separation policy “deserve[] special mention,” noting \n13 that “the separations at issue have been agonizing for parents who have endured them.”  \n14 Id.  In particular, the Court noted that declarations submitted by class representatives in \n15 the case and press reports of the trauma caused by the policy, including reports that \n16 government officials ripped one mother’s crying 18-month-old son from her and that \n17 one parent committed suicide as a result of being separated from his three-year-old son.  \n18 The  Court  further  noted  that  press  reports  and  declarations  submitted  by  class \n19 representatives demonstrate that these separations have inflicted a “highly destabilizing, \n20 traumatic experience that has long term consequences on child well-being, safety, and \n21 development.”  Id. at *9-10. \n22 122.  Finally, the Court concluded that the balance of equities and the public \n23 interest  favored  injunctive  relief.    Specifically,  the  Court  found  that  stopping  the \n24 needless separation of parents from children would not “have a negative impact on the[] \n25 [government’s] ability to enforce the criminal and immigration laws.”  Id. at *10.  It \n26 also found that “[t]he public interest in upholding and protecting th[e] [right to family \n27 integrity and association] would be served by issuance of the requested injunction.”  Id. \n28 at *11. \n  37 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 1   Filed 07/12/18   Page 41 of 64   Page ID #:41\n \n1 Damus v. Nielsen (D.D.C.) \n2 123.  On July 2, 2018, the District Court for the District of Columbia entered a \n3 preliminary injunction requiring the government to follow its 2009 Directive, “Parole \n4 of Arriving Aliens Found to Have a Credible Fear of Persecution or Torture,” issued by \n5 Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  See Damus v. Nielsen, 2018 WL 3232515, at \n6 *2 (D.D.C. July 2, 2018).  This ICE Directive mandates that ‘“[e]ach alien’s eligibility \n7 for parole should be considered and analyzed on its own merits and based on the facts \n8 of the individual alien’s case,’ and that if an asylum-seeker establishes his identity and \n9 that he presents neither a flight risk nor a danger to the public, ‘[ICE] should, absent \n10 additional factors ... parole the alien on the basis that his or her continued detention is \n11 not in the public interest.’”  Id.  The plaintiffs in Damus—a provisional class covering \n12 asylum seekers in five ICE Field Offices who have been found to have a credible fear \n13 of persecution or torture and who are being detained by ICE after having been denied \n14 parole—showed that when the ICE Directive was in force, more than 90 percent of \n15 asylum seekers were granted parole, while 92 to 100 percent of similar individuals were \n16 denied parole between February and September 2017.  Id. at *15. \n17 124.  The Court concluded that, on the basis of these statistics and declarations \n18 from  class  members,  the  plaintiffs  were  likely  to  succeed  on  their  Administrative \n19 Procedure Act claim because it appears that the government is no longer following its \n20 own directives.  Id. at *16-17.  The Court also found that plaintiffs sufficiently showed \n21 they would suffer irreparable harm absent an injunction given that “detention pursuant \n22 to an unlawful departure from agency procedure cannot be remediated after the fact.”  \n23 Id. at *17.  Finally, the Court determined that the balance of harms and the public \n24 interest would be served by the injunction because the plaintiffs were asking only for \n25 the government to follow its own procedures. \n26 Flores v. Sessions (C.D. Cal.) \n27 125.  On July 9, 2018, the District Court for the Central District of California \n28 denied the government’s efforts to modify the Flores Settlement.  Flores v. Sessions, \n  38 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 1   Filed 07/12/18   Page 42 of 64   Page ID #:42\n \n1 No. CV 85-4544, ECF No. 455 (C.D. Cal. July 9, 2018).  The Flores Settlement is a \n2 consent  agreement  between  a  class  including  all  immigrant  children  held  by  the \n3 government and the government, which “sets out nationwide policy for the detention, \n4 release, and treatment of minors in the custody of [the federal government].”  Flores v. \n5 Lynch, 828 F.3d 898, 901 (9th Cir. 2016). The government asked for two specific \n6 exemptions:  (1) permission to detain children indefinitely with their parents in ICE \n7 custody,  and  (2)  permission  to  detain  children  in  facilities  that  do  not  meet  the \n8 agreement’s state licensure requirement.  Flores, ECF No. 455, at 1.   \n9 126.  The  Court  first  found  that  Defendants’  ex  parte  application  was \n10 procedurally improper because it was a “thinly veiled motion for reconsideration” of \n11 previous motion asking for similar relief.  Id.  Second, the Court concluded that the \n12 government failed to satisfy Rule 60’s requirements for altering a settlement agreement, \n13 given that the current so-called difficulties, to the extent they exist, were foreseeable.  \n14 Id. at 2.  To that end, the Court also determined that Defendants had not shown that the \n15 Flores Settlement bore any responsibility for the uptick in family border crossings, that \n16 families routinely fail to appear at required proceedings, or that the Ms. L injunction \n17 prevents the government from meeting its obligations.  Rather, in the Court’s view, “[i]t \n18 is  apparent  that  Defendants’  Application  [was]  a  cynical  attempt  …  to  shift \n19 responsibility to the Judiciary  for over 20 years of Congressional inaction and ill-\n20 considered Executive action that have led to the current stalemate.”  Id. at 7.  The Court \n21 therefore denied the application as “procedurally improper and wholly without merit.”  \n22 Id.   \n23 THE FAMILY SEPARATION POLICY HAS INFLICTED SIGNIFICANT \n24 TRAUMA ON MIGRANT PARENTS AND THEIR CHILDREN \n25 127.  The family separation policy has caused traumatic harm to separated \n26 families.  The consensus among leading experts on trauma is that tearing children \n27 from their parents inflicts severe complex trauma on both parents and children alike \n28\n  39 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 1   Filed 07/12/18   Page 43 of 64   Page ID #:43\n \n1 that might never be fully remedied.91  As Senior Vice Dean and Professor of Mental \n2 Health at University of Southern California Dr. Marleen Wong explains, trauma is the \n3 body’s neurobiological stress response to experiencing or witnessing an event \n4 involving life-threatening circumstances or threat of serious injury that causes him or \n5 her to feel intense fear, helplessness, or horror.92  Complex trauma describes multiple, \n6 repeated, persistent, or prolonged exposure to trauma such that the body’s stress \n7 response impacts the development and functioning of the brain.93  Left untreated, such \n8 trauma causes immediate and long-lasting physical and psychological harm, especially \n9 in children, whose still-developing bodies and brains are ill-equipped to cope with \n10 traumatic stress. 94   \n11 Trauma Experienced by Parents \n12 128.  Parents experience trauma due to forcible separation from their \n13 children.95  Psychologists and other mental-health professionals, including Drs. Gee, \n14 Hidalgo, Sprinson, Loring, and Zayas, Messrs. Berrick and Campbell, and Professor \n15 Wong, expect that parents who experience their children being taken away from them \n16 will likely suffer acute psychological distress that manifests in physical and mental \n17 symptoms of anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, loss of appetite, and/or loss of \n18 sleep.96  After all, “[s]eparation of a child from his/her mother would be a traumatic \n                                         \n19\n91 Declaration of Kenneth Berrick, John Sprinson & Kevin Campbell (“Berrick \nDecl.”), ¶¶ 10, 12; Gee Decl. ¶ 5; Declaration of Jose Hidalgo (“Hidalgo Decl.”), \n20\n¶¶ 12, 13; Declaration of Bruce Perry (“Perry Decl.”), ¶ 21; Declaration of Marleen \nWong (“Wong Decl.”), ¶ 23; Declaration of Luis Zayas (“Zayas Decl.”), ¶¶ 12, 14. \n21\n92 Wong Decl. ¶ 12. \n22\n93 Id. \n23 94 Berrick Decl. ¶ 15; Gee Decl. ¶¶ 5, 8, 9; Hidalgo Decl. ¶ 12; Perry Decl. ¶ 21; \nWong Decl.  ¶ 24 (“Prolonged exposure to such stress has a debilitating effect on \n24 children even after the particular traumatic event is over.”).  \n95 See, e.g., Hidalgo Decl. ¶ 14; Gee Decl. ¶ 6; Berrick Decl. ¶¶ 17, 19; Declaration of \n25\nMarti T.

His child was forcibly taken from his arms, and then Mr. \n13 Muñoz was placed in a chain-link detention cell.

Parents, like their children, must also cope with the events that prompted \n2 their migration in the first place, as well as the stressors and trauma experienced on \n3 the way. 100  As with their children, such experiences are only compounded by \n4 subsequent detention and separation from their families.101 \n5 Trauma Experienced by Children \n6 132.  Recent media reports offer but a hint at the on-going suffering caused by \n7 forced family separation on children.  Recently, an audio recording from inside a CBP \n8 facility captured the voices of ten Central American children separated from their \n9 parents.  The children, as young as four, can be heard crying out desperately for their \n10 parents.  They repeatedly scream “Mami” and “Papa,” many crying so hard it sounds \n11 like they can barely breathe.  Above the heart wrenching weeping and crying is the \n12 voice of a Border Patrol agent who jokes: “Well, we have an orchestra here.  What’s \n13 missing is a conductor.”102 \n14 133.  A pediatrician visiting the Texas detention facility known as “the Ursula” \n15 reported seeing somewhere between 20 and 30 ten-year-old boys caged in by a chain \n16 link fence crying and sobbing for their mothers—some of them reaching out through \n17 the fence as they screamed.  Their mothers, who were in identical cages about 50 feet \n18 away, could only look on, unable to help or console them.103   \n19 134.  Upon separation, children experience acute psychological distress.104 \n20 Indeed, “[f]or children younger than seven or eight years of age, separation from \n21 parents is even worse than the concept of death, as at young ages children see death as \n                                         \n22\n100 See, e.g., Gee Decl. ¶ 7; Zayas Decl. ¶ 8. \n23 101 See, e.g., Gee Decl. ¶ 7; Zayas Decl. ¶ 8. \n102 Ginger Thompson, Listen to Children Who’ve Just Been Separated From Their \n24\nParents at the Border, PROPUBLICA (June 18, 2018), \nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/children-separated-from-parents-border-patrol-cbp-\n25\ntrump-immigration-policy.  \n26 103 Sady Doyle, Child Trauma Can’t Be Undone With an Executive Order, ELLE \nMAGAZINE (June 21, 2018), https://www.elle.com/culture/career-\n27 politics/a21748590/child-trauma-cant-be-undone-with-an-executive-order/.  \n104 Hidalgo Decl. ¶ 9. \n28\n  42 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 1   Filed 07/12/18   Page 46 of 64   Page ID #:46\n \n1 something that can be reversible and is not universal.”105  According to founder and \n2 Chief Executive Office of Seneca Family of Agencies Kenneth Berrick, founder of the \n3 Center for Family Finding and Youth Connectedness Kevin Campbell, and Clinical \n4 Director of Seneca Family of Agencies Dr. John Sprinson, such trauma may be \n5 particularly severe when the separation is sudden or forcible.106  During the moment \n6 of separation, a child can experience “severe neurobiological stress causing the child \n7 to feel intense fear, helplessness, or horror.”107  “Immediate reactions include obvious \n8 emotional suffering in the form of inconsolable crying, desperate efforts to pursue or \n9 search for the parent and anger.”108  Instructor of Psychiatry at the Harvard Medical \n10 School and Massachusetts General Hospital Dr. Jose Hidalgo notes these effects may \n11 be exacerbated by the additional trauma caused when witnessing a parent’s reaction to \n12 separation.109  \n13 135.  In the immediate aftermath of separation, children are likely to continue \n14 to suffer from “extraordinary stress and pain.”110  They may show signs of regression, \n15 reverting to crying and bed-wetting, or suffer the loss of other important \n16 developmental milestones.111  Separated children are also likely to exhibit a variety of \n17 negative behaviors from aggressiveness to withdrawal.112  \n18\n19\n                                         \n20 105 Declaration of Victor Carrion (“Carrion Decl.”) ¶ 5.   \n106 Berrick Decl. ¶ 9 (“When the separation is sudden, unpredictable, or in a strange \n21\nenvironment with no other familiar adult figures present then the response is likely to \nbe extreme.”); see Hidalgo Decl. ¶ 9; Wong Decl. ¶ 22. \n22\n107 Wong Decl. ¶ 23. \n23\n108 Berrick Decl. ¶ 10. \n24 109 Hidalgo Decl. ¶ 9. \n110 Zayas Decl. ¶ 11; see also Gee Decl. ¶ 5 (“The immediate psychological \n25\nconsequences of exposure to traumatic events involving caregivers include, but are not \nlimited to, anxiety, distress, despair, and terror for both the child and the parent.”); \n26\nPerry Decl. ¶ 21; Wong Decl. ¶ 22. \n27 111 Doyle, supra note 103; see also Berrick Decl. ¶ 10. \n112 Berrick Decl. ¶ 10; Wong Decl. ¶¶ 18, 22. \n28\n  43 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 1   Filed 07/12/18   Page 47 of 64   Page ID #:47\n \n1 136.  The longer the parent and child are separated, the greater the harms the \n2 child experiences.113  Decades of public health research demonstrate that the child-\n3 parent bond is a crucial factor in healthy child development.114  The absence of \n4 interaction between parent and child “acts as a ‘double whammy’ for healthy \n5 development: not only does the brain not receive the positive stimulation it needs, but \n6 the body’s stress response is activated, flooding the developing brain with potentially \n7 harmful stress hormones.”115  Moreover, separation disrupts and severely damages the \n8 relationship between a child and their parent.116   \n9 137.  Assistant Professor of Psychology at Yale University Dr. Dylan Gee \n10 writes that “For a child who has been separated from their parent at the border, their \n11 body and brain are being shaped to anticipate danger and prepare for the worst.”117  As \n12 detailed by substantial research conducted by Adjunct Professor in the Department of \n13 Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Feinberg School of Medicine at \n14 Northwestern University Dr. Bruce Perry, stress hormones induce a state of \n15\n                                         \n113 Hidalgo Decl. ¶ 12; Jessica Henderson Daniel, PhD, Statement of APA President \n16\nRegarding Executive Order Rescinding Immigrant Family Separation Policy, AM. \n17 PSYCHOLOGICAL ASS’N (June 20, 2018), http://www.apa.org/news/ \npress/releases/2018/06/family-separation-policy.aspx.  \n18 114 Karen Dineed Wagner, MD, PhD, President’s Statement on Separating Children \nFrom Families, AMER.

Separation is not the only source of trauma migrant children will face \n10 upon arrival at the border.  After separation, children are likely to be held in detention \n11 centers, where even a short length of stay is known to cause traumatic effects.120  \n12 According to Dr. Luis Zayas, Dean of Steve Hicks School of Social Work and \n13 Professor of Psychiatry at Dell Medical School at the University of Texas, Austin, \n14\n15\n                                         \n118 Id.; see also Perry Decl. ¶ 13 (“[T]rauma, neglect, and maltreatment during \n16\nchildhood have profound effects on physical, social, emotional, behavioral, and \ncognitive development.

Indeed, separation and detention are likely to be only some of many \n12 traumatic experiences already suffered by a migrant child.  The families arriving daily \n13 at this nation’s borders are likely to be fleeing endemic levels of crime, violence, and \n14 victimization in their home countries.125  They are likely to have been victims of \n15 violence, both in their homes and communities.126  On top of that, migrant children \n16 and their families are likely to have endured a harrowing journey across thousands of \n17 miles without adequate food, water, or protection.127  To be suddenly separated from \n18\n                                         \n19 121 Zayas Decl. ¶ 11. \n122 Council on Community Pediatrics, supra note 120. \n20\n123 Zayas Decl. ¶¶ 11, 15-19. \n21\n124 Council on Community Pediatrics, supra note 120. \n22 125 Adriana Beltrán, Fleeing Violence in Central America, WOLA: COMMENTARY \n(Feb. 21, 2017), https://www.wola.org/analysis/people-leaving-central-americas-\n23 northern-triangle/ (“In [] Guatemala and Honduras, homicide levels have decreased \noverall, but both remain among the world’s most violent countries not at war.”); \n24 (“Extortion is widespread, with small businesses, the public transportation sector, and \npoor neighborhoods being the most heavily hit. . . .

These symptoms due to family separation are compounded by the \n6 presence of other traumatized parents in confinement and by the traumatic events that \n7 caused them to migrate in the first place.  For instance, R.M. has reported that “she \n8 saw other parents ‘wailing and crying until they could cry no more.’”137  J.P. has \n9 similarly reported that “[s]he worries what will happen to her next,” in part, because \n10 “when she sees women leave the detention center, she does not know where they go \n11 and what happens to them.”138  Further, Dr. Hidalgo notes that “[m]any of the \n12 parents”—including the Plaintiffs—“have previously experienced other traumas and \n13 have fled their home countries seeking sanctuary from violence,” and that for “parents \n14 who have a prior history of trauma and losses, the forcible separation from their \n15 children can lead to higher rates of posttraumatic stress disorders, depression, anxiety, \n16 suicidal behavior, among other impacts.”139   \n17 145.  Plaintiffs’ children have also experienced identifiable trauma.  For \n18 instance, L.P. recalls having “a hard time thinking of anything but her mother” and \n19 “spen[t] most of the time crying” until she could speak with her mother.140  When she \n20 attempts not to cry, she experiences nosebleeds and headaches.141  The harm is made \n21 worse because other children in the facility are also distressed.

Ms. P and her \n10 daughter were held in deplorable conditions for three days before their forced \n11 separation.145  Officers made no efforts to help Ms. P communicate with her daughter \n12 until counsel became involved, despite her obvious distress.146  In an act particularly \n13 symbolic of the subhuman way that detainees are treated, a CBP officer threw \n14 crackers on the floor to force Ms. M pick them up, rather than simply handing them to \n15 her.147  These actions inevitably and purposely exacerbate the trauma for the Plaintiffs. \n16 147.  To date, Plaintiffs have not received trauma-informed mental-health \n17 screenings or services to address the harms suffered. \n18 TO REMEDY TRAUMA INFLICTED BY ITS CRUEL POLICY, THE \n19 GOVERNMENT MUST OFFER SEPARATED FAMILIES \n20 COMPREHENSIVE MENTAL-HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED UNDER \n21 APPROPRIATE CONDITIONS \n22 148.

If the separated families \n2 are to recover from the trauma imposed by Defendants’ actions, these mental-health \n3 services cannot be provided in the same slipshod manner as the government \n4 implemented its initial trauma-inducing policy.  Instead, they must be provided under \n5 conditions conducive to effective treatment. \n6 149.  Most importantly, the treatment must be evidence-based and trauma-\n7 informed, meaning that it must be designed especially to alleviate the psychological \n8 and neurobiological consequences of forcible separation.148  Such treatments exist and \n9 have been shown to be effective across cultural backgrounds.149  Some have been \n10 successfully adapted for immigrant populations.150  These mental-health services often \n11 take the form of trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy.151 \n12 150.  For these services to be effective, several conditions must be met. \n13 151.  First, the families must be reunified in short order consistent with the Ms. \n14 L injunction.  The longer the separation, the more pervasive and intense the trauma \n15 becomes.152  “The effects of trauma on separated children are [already] significant, \n16 long-lasting, and difficult to mitigate.”153  Prolonging the separation understandably \n17 increases the trauma and thus requires more intense mental-health services. \n18 152.  Second, all parents and children must be immediately screened “to \n19 identify those whose anxiety is toxic and detrimental to themselves and their families, \n20 as well as those whose anxiety has grown into trauma with its accompanying \n21\n                                         \n22 148 See, e.g., Perry Decl. ¶ 22; Hidalgo Decl. ¶ 21; Gee Decl. ¶ 10. \n149 See Gee Decl. ¶ 10; Hidalgo Decl. ¶ 18. \n23\n150 See Gee Decl. ¶ 10.  \n24\n151 See, e.g., id. \n25 152 See id.

For these \n8 screenings to be effective given the special trauma inflicted upon the families, they \n9 must be conducted according to trauma-informed procedures and by appropriately \n10 trained trauma-informed professionals.157 Specifically, they must meet several \n11 conditions:  to start, a tool must show “efficacy (i.e., reliability, validity, and accuracy \n12 in identifying individuals with trauma) and effectiveness (i.e., generalizability to the \n13 real-world that adults and children inhabit).”158  A tool must also show “sensitivity \n14 (i.e., number of individuals correctly identified, that is true positives) and specificity \n15 (i.e., eliminating those who do not demonstrate a problem, that is true negatives).”159  \n16 153.  Third, to the extent that professionals conducting the screening find that \n17 the families are experiencing or have experienced trauma due to Defendants’ policy, \n18 appropriate mental-health services must be offered in an appropriate environment.  \n19 While each family’s ultimate treatment must be tailored to its particular \n20\n21\n                                         \n22 154 Loring Decl. ¶ 11; see Hidalgo Decl. ¶ 16; Zayas Decl. ¶¶ 20-21; Mercado Decl. \n¶ 9. \n23\n155 Zayas Decl. ¶ 21. \n24 156 Perry Decl. ¶ 22.   \n157 See Gee Decl. ¶ 18 (“All mental health assessment and treatment provided to \n25\nplaintiffs and all similarly situated parents and children be delivered in a culturally \ncompetent and linguistically sensitive manner and by mental health clinicians trained \n26\nin evidence-based trauma-informed interventions.”); Zayas Decl. ¶ 28. \n27 158 Zayas Decl. ¶ 21. \n159 Id. \n28\n  51 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 1   Filed 07/12/18   Page 55 of 64   Page ID #:55\n \n1 circumstances, extensive research suggests that several baseline factors will be \n2 common for all affected families.   \n3 154.  One, counseling services are most effective in such situations when \n4 provided at the family level, meaning that “the adult caregivers must be a part of the \n5 trauma intervention provided to these children.”160 “Appropriate treatment for trauma \n6 caused by separation should consist of family therapy” because the trauma touched \n7 “all family members” and their relationships with each other, and thus family therapy \n8 “is necessary to address family pain.”161 Put another way, this approach is necessary \n9 not only to assist the child in “reestablishing [his or her] ability to effectively regulate \n10 himself [or herself],” but also “to treat [the parent’s] own primary trauma and to \n11 effectively support their traumatized child.”162  Indeed, “[d]ecades of research \n12 demonstrates that the most significant protective factor for vulnerable children facing \n13 adversity are bonds to those that love them.”163   \n14 155.  Two, these services must “be delivered in a culturally competent and \n15 linguistically sensitive manner and by mental health clinicians trained in evidence-\n16 based trauma-informed interventions.”164  The trauma caused by family separation is \n17 acute, and the migrant families are diverse.

Three, these services must be provided in an environment that does not \n4 continue or prolong the trauma.  “[T]herapeutic work while in a setting or \n5 circumstance where there is continuing distress, threat, uncertainty and \n6 unpredictability can undermine, or even make impossible, meaningful therapeutic \n7 progress.”165 In addition, “[f]or a child and an adult to remain in a setting he/she \n8 associates with the traumatic separation (even after reunification with the mother or \n9 father), … will cause additional and profound anticipation of further traumatic events: \n10 The mother and father who also experienced traumatic separation from their child \n11 would need to be placed in a safe family setting with their child(ren) to avoid an \n12 increase in such trauma symptoms as persistent negative thoughts and expectations \n13 about oneself, one’s world, and others.”166   \n14 157.  An environment like the detention centers where class members are \n15 currently housed can prevent and even undermine trauma intervention.167  AAP has \n16 stated that “continuing to maintain the ‘zero tolerance’ policy will put more children \n17 in detention facilities, an environment [that] is no place for a child, even if they are \n18 accompanied by their families.”168  AAP explained, “Studies of detained immigrants \n19 have shown that children and parents may suffer negative physical and emotional \n20 symptoms from detention, including anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress \n21 disorder.

No child should ever have to endure these conditions.”169 \n3 158.  Data from Texas Health and Human Services Commission and the \n4 Department of Family and Protective Services shows that numerous of the centers \n5 where children are being sent pursuant to this policy “have been cited by state child \n6 care facility regulators for dozens of violations in recent years,” some of which have \n7 been for serious issues.170 \n8 159.  Such centers have also been the subject of “fire-code violations, lawsuits \n9 claiming abuse, and complaints from employees alleging wrongful termination and \n10 unpaid wages.”171 \n11 160.  At family detention centers, former detainees have reported a dozen or \n12 more people sharing a single cell, guards ordering that toddlers not be allowed to \n13 crawl, and toys barred from living quarters.172  A 2014 evaluation of children at family \n14 detention centers found that “children regressed to bed wetting.

Guards at family detention centers have been accused of sexual assault, \n2 abusive treatment, and neglect.174 \n3 162.

Finally, given that Defendants’ actions have caused this trauma, mental-\n7 health services must be provided for a sufficient period of time, including after \n8 release. \n9 CLASS ALLEGATIONS \n10 164.    Plaintiffs bring this action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n11 23(b)(2) on behalf of themselves and a nationwide class of all other persons similarly \n12 situated. \n13 165.  Plaintiffs seek to represent the following nationwide class: \n14 All adult parents nationwide who (1) were, are, or will be detained in \n15 immigration custody by the Department of Homeland Security, (2) have \n16 a minor child who has been, is, or will be separated from them by DHS \n17 and detained in DHS or ORR custody or foster care, absent a \n18 demonstration in a hearing that the parent is unfit or presents a danger to \n19 the child. \n20 166.  The proposed class is so numerous that joinder of all members is \n21 impractical, satisfying Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)(1).  According to \n22 Defendants, nearly 3,000 children have been separated from their parents under the \n23 Trump Administration’s immigration policy.  Nearly all of these children’s parents \n24 remain in DHS’s custody.   \n25\n26\n                                         \n174 Id.; Manny Fernandez and Katie Benner, The Billion-Dollar Business of Operating \n27\nShelters for Migrant Children, N.Y.

The proposed class meets the commonality requirements of Federal Rule \n2 of Civil Procedure 23(a)(2) for several reasons.  First, the proposed class members \n3 have all been subject to the government’s family separation policy and, as a result, \n4 have had their children forcibly taken from their care, triggering the harms alleged.  \n5 Second, other factual questions are common to the proposed class, including whether \n6 and to what extent the government has developed an appropriate policy for mitigating \n7 the harms inflicted by the family separation policy.  Third, multiple questions of law \n8 are common to the proposed class, namely whether Defendants’ actions have violated \n9 their substantive due process rights and their rights to equal protection of the law.   \n10 168.  The proposed class meets the typicality requirements of Federal Rule of \n11 Civil Procedure 23(a)(3).  Ms. P, Ms. O, and Ms. M have all have been forcibly \n12 separated from their children without a finding of unfitness or that they present a \n13 danger to their children, and they have not been provided with appropriate mental-\n14 health screening or offered appropriate trauma-informed intervention.  Additionally, \n15 Plaintiffs assert the same rights under the Fifth Amendment. \n16 169.  The proposed class meets the adequacy requirements of Federal Rule of \n17 Civil Procedure 23(a)(4).  Ms. P, Ms. O, and Ms. M assert the same claims and seek \n18 the same relief as the other members of the class, namely an order that they be \n19 provided appropriate mental-health screening and any appropriate trauma-informed \n20 intervention in an appropriate environment.  The named plaintiffs will defend the \n21 rights of all proposed class members fairly and adequately. Further, the proposed class \n22 is represented by Sidley Austin LLP and Public Counsel.  Counsel have extensive \n23 experience litigating class action suits and other complex cases in federal court, \n24 including civil rights suits on behalf of noncitizens. \n25 170.  The members of the proposed class are readily ascertainable through \n26 Defendants’ records. \n27 171.  Finally, the proposed class satisfies Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n28 23(b)(2).  Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to \n  56 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 1   Filed 07/12/18   Page 60 of 64   Page ID #:60\n \n1 the class by forcibly separating the migrant parents from their children under a \n2 common policy and failing to provide adequate medical care for detained individuals \n3 and to remedy the harms inflicted.  As a result, the declaratory and injunctive relief \n4 sought by the proposed class will be appropriate with respect to the class as a whole. \n5 CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n6 FIRST CLAIM \n7 Violation of Substantive Due Process \n8 172.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation \n9 contained in the preceding paragraphs. \n10 173.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n11 provides that “[n]o person shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty, or property, without \n12 due process of law.”  U.S. Const. amend. V. \n13 174.  The Due Process Clause applies to all persons on United States soil and \n14 thus applies to Plaintiffs and their children.  Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678 (2001). \n15 175.  The guarantee against the deprivation of liberty without due process bars \n16 the government from infringing on certain fundamental liberty interests.  The \n17 continued separation and confinement of Plaintiffs and their children violates those \n18 rights in several respects.   \n19 176.  Plaintiffs and their children have a liberty interest under the Due Process \n20 Clause in remaining together as a family and a right to be protected against the \n21 government’s arbitrary destruction of the integrity of their families.  See, e.g., \n22 Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745 (1982); Moore v. E. Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494 \n23 (1977); Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923).  Under the Fifth Amendment, \n24 Plaintiffs also have “the right … to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and \n25 control of their children.”  Fields v. Palmdale Sch. Dist., 427 F.3d  1197, 1204 (9th \n26 Cir. 2005) (citing Troxel v. Granville, 430 U.S. 57, 66 (2000) (plurality op.)).  The \n27 continued separation of Plaintiffs from their children, without any determination that \n28 Plaintiffs were unfit or present a danger to their children, plainly violates these rights.   \n  57 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 1   Filed 07/12/18   Page 61 of 64   Page ID #:61\n \n1 177.  Plaintiffs’ separation and the resulting trauma occurred while Plaintiffs \n2 and their children were in the custody of the United States Department of Homeland \n3 Security and the Department of Health and Human Services.  Once Defendants \n4 detained Plaintiffs and their children, the Defendants incurred a duty not to \n5 gratuitously inflict emotional and psychological harm and a duty to provide for their \n6 safety and general well-being.  See DeShaney v. Winnebago Cty. Dept. of Soc. Servs., \n7 489 U.S. 189 (1989).   \n8 178.  By forcibly separating Plaintiffs from their children and keeping them \n9 apart, Defendants have inflicted and will continue to inflict upon Plaintiffs \n10 extraordinary harm that they would not have otherwise have faced.  During Plaintiffs’ \n11 confinement and since the time Defendants arbitrarily separated Plaintiffs from their \n12 children, Plaintiffs have not received the intensive family mental-health screenings \n13 and services that they need on an ongoing basis—including for a period following \n14 their release from detention—as a result of Defendants’ intentional infliction of \n15 emotional and psychological harm. \n16 179.  The separation of Plaintiffs from their children and their continued \n17 detention is arbitrary and shocks the conscience.  Defendants forcibly separated \n18 Plaintiffs from their children without explanation or basis in fact, which deliberately \n19 induced severe trauma to both parent and child.  Defendants did so despite clear \n20 warnings, including from numerous professionals and organizations such as the \n21 American Academy of Pediatrics, that their actions were tantamount to child abuse \n22 and could result in long-term adverse mental health consequences.  \n23 180.  Defendants intentionally took these actions pursuant to a policy of \n24 detention and family separation that lacked any legitimate basis.  Subjecting parents \n25 and their minor children to the cruel practice of separating families for the purposes of \n26 deterring other legitimate asylum seekers, and to use their profound suffering as a \n27 political bargaining chip, clearly violates due process.  \n28\n  58 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 1   Filed 07/12/18   Page 62 of 64   Page ID #:62\n \n1 181.  Plaintiffs and their children have suffered and will continue to suffer \n2 irreparable injury from the arbitrary and cruel separation of their families and their \n3 unnecessary continued detention.  \n4 SECOND CLAIM \nViolation of the Equal Protection Guarantee of the Due Process Clause  \n5\nof the Fifth Amendment  \n6\n182.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation \n7\ncontained in the preceding paragraphs. \n8\n183.  The Fifth Amendment contains an implicit guarantee of equal protection \n9\nthat invalidates any official action that in part reflects a racially discriminatory intent \n10\nor purpose. Classifications based on race or national origin receive exacting scrutiny, \n11\nand even facially neutral policies and practices will be held unconstitutional when \n12\nthey reflect a pattern unexplainable on grounds other than race. Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 \n13\nU.S. 497, 499 (1954); Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. \n14\n252, 265-66 (1977). \n15\n184.  Defendants’ decisions to forcibly separate families and to isolate children \n16\nin detention facilities separate from their parents, are unconstitutional because they \n17\nwere motivated, at least in part, by intentional discrimination based on race, ethnicity, \n18\nand/or national origin and, in particular, reflect bias against immigrants perceived to \n19\ncome from non-white, non-European countries. \n20\n185.  Plaintiffs have suffered and continue to suffer irreparable injury resulting \n21\nfrom the separation and continued detention of asylum-seeking parents and children, \n22\nand the denial of adequate, remedial, family medical and mental-health services in a \n23\nsetting conducive to effective treatment. \n24\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n25\nPlaintiffs ask this Court to grant the following relief:   \n26\n1.  Certify a class of all adult parents nationwide who (1) were, are, or will \n27\nbe detained in immigration custody by the Department of Homeland Security, and (2) \n28\n  59 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 1   Filed 07/12/18   Page 63 of 64   Page ID #:63\n \n1 have a minor child who has been, is, or will be separated from them by DHS and \n2 detained in DHS or ORR custody or foster care, absent a demonstration in a hearing \n3 that the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child; \n4 2.  Name Ms. O, Ms. P., and Ms. M. as representatives of the class, and \n5 appoint Plaintiffs’ counsel as class counsel; \n6 3.  Order Defendants to provide mental-health screenings of Plaintiffs and \n7 their children immediately as well as after reunification in order to assess their need \n8 for subsequent trauma-informed remedial medical and mental-health services to \n9 address the trauma of separation and child detention;  \n10 4.  Order Defendants to offer appropriate trauma-informed remedial medical \n11 and mental-health services appropriate to address the trauma of separation and \n12 detention to Plaintiffs and to Plaintiffs’ children and under conditions conducive to \n13 effective treatment;  \n14 5.

They also know \n4 that separation can become traumatic where it is forcible, sudden, or prolonged, and \n5 where loved ones cannot contact one another while separated.  Yet the government, \n6 including Defendants, deliberately, needlessly, and unconstitutionally separated \n7 thousands of children from their parents, refused to allow parents and children to \n8 communicate, failed to provide information about the well-being of separated family \n9 members, and kept separated family members in intolerable suspense by refusing to \n10 explain when or even if families would ever be reunified.   \n11   Even if the government somehow failed fully to anticipate the trauma that its \n12 actions would cause, the reactions of the separated family members immediately \n13 informed the government that it was inflicting severe harm.  Media reports and \n14 personal accounts of the separations are replete with vivid descriptions of obviously \n15 terrified children and desperate parents.  Compl., Dkt. No. 1 (“Compl.”) ¶¶ 107, 130, \n16 132-33.  The experience of the putative class representatives in this case and their \n17 families likewise shows the obvious nature of the harm inflicted by the government.  \n18 Plaintiff Ms. J.P.’s daughter fainted in terror when she realized she was about to be \n19 separated from her mother, and after nearly two months of separation feels depressed \n20 and cannot speak about her mother without crying.

This trauma is being \n25 multiplied each day that these families remain separated and its effects will not \n26 evaporate once families are reunited; instead, it risks causing long-lasting damage to \n27 the physical and mental health of parents and children alike, including anxiety, \n28 depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”).

This failure violates the government’s constitutional obligations in two \n8 independent ways.  First, the government must provide adequate health care, including \n9 mental health care, to persons it detains.  Second, having inflicted grievous harm on \n10 thousands of people by its misconduct, which has already been found likely to violate \n11 due process, the government is promptly required to remedy the damage it has caused \n12 and prevent further damage by providing effective trauma-focused family therapy.  \n13 This motion seeks an order from the Court requiring the government to live up to its \n14 constitutional obligations by providing effective treatment in an appropriate setting to \n15 address the harm inflicted by its unconstitutional family separation policy. \n16 FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n17 A.  Plaintiffs and the Proposed Class. \n18   Plaintiffs in this case are three mothers who were separated from their minor \n19 children under the government’s family separation policy.1  They seek to represent the \n20 following nationwide class: \n21 All adult parents nationwide who (1) were, are, or will be detained in \nimmigration custody by the Department of Homeland Security, (2) have \n22 a minor child who has been, is, or will be separated from them by DHS \nand detained in DHS or ORR [Office of Refugee Resettlement] custody \n23 or foster care, absent a demonstration in a hearing that the parent is unfit \nor presents a danger to the child. \n24\nB.  The Government Implemented the Family Separation Policy. \n25\nOn May 7, 2018, Defendant Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a “zero-\n26\ntolerance” policy of forced family separation to deter migrants from crossing the \n27\n                                                \n28 1 Compl. ¶ 4. \n  2 \nNOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT \nTHEREOF \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 45   Filed 07/18/18   Page 12 of 35   Page ID #:654\n \n1 southern border, announcing “If you cross this border unlawfully, then we will \n2 prosecute you.  It’s that simple. . . .  If you are smuggling a child, then we will \n3 prosecute you and that child will be separated from you. . . .”2 But the policy was not \n4 limited to “smugglers.”  Rather, ordinary immigrant families – many of whom are \n5 seeking asylum – bore its brunt.  In the first month of the policy, nearly 3,000 children \n6 were separated from their parents while crossing the border.3  Some children were as \n7 young as 18 months old, and more than 100 were younger than four years old.4   \n8 The government mischaracterized family separation as necessary to enforce the \n9 law.  But DHS expressly contemplated using family separation to deter migration \n10 from Central America into the United States at least a year before the “zero tolerance” \n11 policy was adopted.5  In March 2017, then-DHS Secretary Kelly confirmed that \n12 family separation was under consideration as a means to deter migration across the \n13 southern border.  On May 11, 2018, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly confirmed \n14 that the family separation policy was put in place to deter other migrants, specifically \n15 Central Americans, from coming to the United States.  In his words, “a big name of \n16 the game is deterrence.”6 \n17 C.

One of the cases challenging the policy \n2 was filed by a refugee known as “Ms. L.” in the Southern District of California, and is \n3 pending before Judge Dana Sabraw.  Ms. L. v. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enf’t, \n4 Case No. 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD (S.D. Cal.) (“Ms. L. Case”).  On June 26, 2018, \n5 Judge Sabraw preliminarily certified a class of parents who enter the United States \n6 who were, are or will be detained in immigration custody, and who have a minor child \n7 who is or will be separated from them absent a determination that the parent is unfit or \n8 endangers the child.  Ms. L. Case, Dkt. No. 82 at 17.  That same day, he entered a \n9 preliminary injunction that included the following provisions, among others: \n10 •  Defendants . . . are preliminarily enjoined from detaining Class Members in \n11 DHS custody without and apart from their minor children, absent a \n12 determination that the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child . . . . \n13 •  Defendants must reunify all Class Members with their minor children who are \n14 under the age of five (5) within fourteen (14) days of the entry of this Order; \n15 and . . . Defendants must reunify all Class Members with their minor children \n16 age five (5) and over within thirty (30) days of the entry of this Order. \n17 •  Defendants . . . are preliminarily enjoined from removing any Class Members \n18 without their child . . . . \n19 Ms. L. Case, Dkt. No. 83 at 22-24. \n20   In support of this injunction, Judge Sabraw found that the Ms. L. Case plaintiffs \n21 had submitted evidence demonstrating that they were likely to succeed in showing that \n22 the government’s family separation practice violates due process and “shocks the \n23 conscience.”  Id. at 12.  Judge Sabraw found that the government implemented this \n24 practice “without any effective system or procedure for (1) tracking the children after \n25 they were separated from their parents, (2) enabling communication between the \n26 parents and their children after separation, and (3) reuniting the parents and children \n27 after the parents are returned to immigration custody following completion of their \n28 criminal sentence.”  Id. at 14.  Noting that the government routinely catalogs, stores, \n  4 \nNOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT \nTHEREOF \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 45   Filed 07/18/18   Page 14 of 35   Page ID #:656\n \n1 and returns property seized from detainees upon their release, Judge Sabraw found \n2 that the government’s failure to do the same with respect to children “cannot satisfy \n3 the requirements of due process.”  Id. at 14-15.  Going further, Judge Sabraw found \n4 that the government improperly placed the onus on parents to “search for their \n5 children and make application for reunification;” he found that placing that burden on \n6 parents “is backwards” because “the Government has an affirmative obligation to \n7 track and promptly reunify these family members.”  Id. at 16-17.  In summary, Judge \n8 Sabraw found that the government’s practice of separating families, as implemented, \n9 “is likely to be so egregious, so outrageous, that it may fairly be said to shock the \n10 contemporary conscience . . . interferes with rights implicit in the concept of ordered \n11 liberty, . . . and is so brutal and offensive that it [does] not comport with traditional \n12 ideas of fair play and decency.”  Id. at 17 (citations and quotation marks omitted). \n13   Judge Sabraw also found that the plaintiffs were likely to suffer irreparable \n14 harm because they were likely deprived of their constitutional rights.  Id.  Judge \n15 Sabraw further found that the balance of equities and public interest favored the \n16 plaintiffs, because they had established a likelihood that the government’s policy was \n17 unconstitutional, because the injunction would not interfere with the government’s \n18 ability to enforce criminal and immigration laws, and to exercise discretion in matters \n19 of release and detention consistent with law, and because the injunction would protect \n20 the interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children, which is \n21 perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by the Supreme \n22 Court.  Id. at 20-21 (quoting Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 (2000)). \n23 D.  The Government’s Family Separation Policy Inflicts Trauma and \nIncreased Risk of Lifelong Health Problems on Plaintiffs, Class \n24 Members, and Their Children. \n25 The government’s policy of separating families has caused harm to separated \n26 families.  The consensus among trauma experts is that tearing children from their \n27 parents inflicts severe complex trauma on parents and children alike.

According \n10 to Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Seneca Family of Agencies Kenneth \n11 Berrick, founder of the Center for Family Finding and Youth Connectedness Kevin \n12 Campbell, and Clinical Director of Seneca Family of Agencies Dr. John Sprinson, \n13 such trauma may be particularly severe when the separation is sudden or forcible.10  \n14 During the moment of separation, a child can experience “severe neurobiological \n15 stress causing the child to feel intense fear, helplessness, or horror.”11  “Immediate \n16 reactions include obvious emotional suffering in the form of inconsolable crying, \n17 desperate efforts to pursue or search for the parent and anger.”12  Instructor of \n18 Psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital Dr. \n19 Jose Hidalgo notes these effects may be exacerbated by the additional trauma caused \n20\n                                                \n21 7 Declaration of Marleen Wong, Dkt.

Plaintiffs, Class Members, and Their Children Require Trauma-\nInformed Family Mental Health Screenings and Services to Recover \n7 From the Trauma Inflicted by the Government.  \n8 If the separated families are to recover from the trauma caused by the \n9 government’s separation, they require mental health screening and services that meet \n10 several criteria.  Most importantly, the treatment must be evidence-based and trauma-\n11 informed, meaning that it must be designed especially to alleviate the psychological \n12 and neurobiological consequences of forcible separation.32  Such treatments exist and \n13 have been shown to be effective across cultural backgrounds.33  Some have been \n14 successfully adapted for immigrant populations.34  These mental-health services often \n15 take the form of trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy.35 \n16 For these services to be effective, several conditions must be met.  First, the \n17 families must be reunified quickly.  The longer the separation, the more pervasive \n18 and intense the trauma becomes.36  “The effects of trauma on separated children are \n19 [already] significant, long-lasting, and difficult to mitigate.”37  Prolonging the \n20 separation increases the trauma and thus requires more intense mental-health services. \n21 Second, all reunited parents and children must be immediately screened “to \n22 identify those whose anxiety is toxic and detrimental to themselves and their families, \n23 as well as those whose anxiety has grown into trauma with its accompanying \n24\n25                                                 \n32 See, e.g., Perry Decl. ¶ 22; Hidalgo Decl. ¶¶ 17-20. \n26 33 See Gee Decl. ¶ 10. \n34 Id. \n27 35 Id. \n36 See id.; Hidalgo Decl. ¶ 12. \n28 37 Id. ¶ 13. \n  10 \nNOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT \nTHEREOF \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 45   Filed 07/18/18   Page 20 of 35   Page ID #:662\n \n1 symptoms,”38 so that treatment plans can be developed for them.  This screening \n2 process is essential because “[t]he longer [appropriate] interventions are delayed, the \n3 greater the negative cumulative effect the acute neurophysiological, neuroendocrine, \n4 and neuropsychological response will have on these children and their parents.”39  For \n5 these screenings to be effective given the special trauma inflicted upon the families, \n6 they must be conducted according to trauma-informed procedures and by \n7 appropriately trained trauma-informed professionals.40  Such screenings must also be \n8 repeated following family reunification to determine whether the process of \n9 reunification revealed trauma not previously evident. \n10 Third, mental-health services must be offered to those requiring them in an \n11 environment that does not continue or prolong the trauma.  Treatment for trauma \n12 requires the restoration of a sense of safety and it is much easier to achieve this goal \n13 when the person receiving the service is in an environment of actual safety.41  When \n14 an individual must remain vigilant for threats and is preoccupied with uncertain and \n15 unknown possible outcomes they are less likely to, or are much slower to, develop a \n16 trusting alliance and an emotionally resonant connection with a therapist.42  The \n17 detention centers in which Plaintiffs, class members, and their children were or are \n18 held are not suitable locations to provide such therapy:  “[f]or a child and an adult to \n19 remain in a setting he/she associates with the traumatic separation (even after \n20 reunification with the mother or father) . . . will cause additional and profound \n21 anticipation of further traumatic events[.] The mother and father who also experienced \n22 traumatic separation from their child would need to be placed in a safe family setting \n23 with their child(ren) to avoid an increase in such trauma symptoms as persistent \n24 negative thoughts and expectations about oneself, one’s world, and others.”43     \n                                                \n25 38 Declaration of Marti T.

For the trauma to be \n13 appropriately mitigated, the mental-health services must be tailored to address the \n14 specific individuals harmed and their symptoms.   \n15 Sixth, mental-health services must be provided for a sufficient period of time \n16 in order to effectively mitigate the harm the government has caused, including after \n17 the families’ ultimate release from detention. \n18 F.  Mental Health Care Services Provided by the Government Are Not \nEffective Or Sufficient. \n19\n  The mental health services actually offered by the government in detention \n20\nfacilities are sporadic to nonexistent.  Family detention centers operated by the Office \n21\nof Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”) do not routinely provide mental health services at \n22\nall.48  As to centers where minors reside, ORR provides general case management \n23\npersonnel and mental health follow-up services, but does not provide trauma-informed \n24\nmental health care services for minors at such centers.49  In fact, some “clinicians” at \n25                                                 \n44 Perry Decl. ¶ 23. \n26 45 Id. ¶¶ 23-24; see also Hidalgo Decl. ¶ 25. \n46 Hidalgo Decl. ¶ 31. \n27 47 Gee Decl. ¶ 18 (emphasis added).  \n48 Declaration of Alfonso Mercado, Dkt.

Far from providing an environment that \n5 makes patients feel safe and reduces their toxic stress levels, conditions in law-\n6 enforcement detention facilities “are highly stressful and do not provide children with \n7 sufficient opportunities for positive, social-emotional supports.”51  Just as importantly, \n8 because Plaintiffs, class members, and their children experienced trauma while in \n9 detention at the hands of those in control of the detention environment, “children and \n10 parents would not be likely to feel safe in such facilities and are likely to be re-\n11 traumatized by the conditions.”52 \n12 LEGAL STANDARD \n13   Plaintiffs are entitled to preliminary injunctive relief if they show: (1) likely \n14 success on the merits; (2) likely irreparable harm absent preliminary relief; (3) the \n15 balance of equities tips in their favor; and (4) an injunction is in the public’s interest.  \n16 Pimentel v. Dreyfus, 670 F.3d 1096, 1105–06 (9th Cir. 2012); Sierra Forest Legacy v. \n17 Rey, 577 F.3d 1015, 1021-23 (9th Cir. 2009).  Plaintiffs seeking a mandatory \n18 injunction must show that the law and facts clearly favor their position.  See Garcia v. \n19 Google, Inc., 786 F.3d 733, 740 (9th Cir. 2015) (en banc).  Under the Ninth Circuit’s \n20 “sliding scale” approach, a stronger showing of one element may offset a weaker \n21 showing of another, as long as plaintiffs “establish that irreparable harm is likely.” All. \n22 for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1131 (9th Cir. 2011). “While \n23 Plaintiffs carry the burden of demonstrating likelihood of success, they are not \n24 required to prove their case in full at the preliminary injunction stage but only such \n25 portions that enable them to obtain the injunctive relief they seek.” Ms. L.

PLAINTIFFS ARE LIKELY TO SUCCEED ON THE MERITS. \n3 Plaintiffs and the Class are likely to prevail on their substantive due process \n4 claim under the Fifth Amendment and obtain an order directing the government to \n5 provide them with effective mental health screening and treatment on two separate \n6 and independent grounds.  First, the government is required to provide effective \n7 mental health care services to all persons it detains, both during detention and for a \n8 reasonable period thereafter. See Wakefield v. Thompson, 177 F. 3d 1160, 1164-65 \n9 (9th Cir. 1999).  To date, it has provided no such services to Plaintiffs and class \n10 members, in violation of its clearly established constitutional obligations.   \n11 Second, the government’s separation of Plaintiffs and class members from their \n12 children, which has already been found likely to violate due process and shock the \n13 conscience, directly and foreseeably injured Plaintiffs and class members, and the \n14 government is obligated to remedy the injuries and risk of future injuries that its \n15 violations caused.  See Kennedy v. City of Ridgefield, 439 F.3d 1055, 1062 (9th Cir. \n16 2006) (“this circuit has held state officials liable . . . for their roles in creating or \n17 exposing individuals to danger they otherwise would not have faced.”) \n18 A.  The Government’s Detention of Class Members Created a Special \nRelationship Requiring It to Provide Effective Mental Health \n19 Treatment During and Following Detention. \n20 Detained persons have a due process right requiring the government to provide \n21 adequate medical care. Henry A. v. Willden, 678 F.3d 991, 1000 (9th Cir. 2012); see \n22 also Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976); DeShaney v. Winnebago Cty. Dep’t \n23 of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 199–200 (1989)). The reason for this right is clear: while \n24 the government restricts a person’s ability to provide for his or her own medical care, \n25 it must bear the responsibility of providing it.  See Wakefield, 177 F.3d at 1164.  \n26 The government held or is holding Plaintiffs and class members in detention. \n27 Accordingly, it is required to provide adequate medical care including mental health \n28 services. DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 199–200; see also, e.g., Doe v. Kelly, 878 F.3d 710, \n  14 \nNOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT \nTHEREOF \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 45   Filed 07/18/18   Page 24 of 35   Page ID #:666\n \n1 722–23 (9th Cir. 2017) (“There is no question that detainees are entitled to ‘adequate \n2 medical care’” as a component of their due process rights); Gibson v. Cty. of Washoe, \n3 290 F.3d 1175, 1188 (9th Cir. 2002), overruled on other grounds by Castro v. Cty. of \n4 Los Angeles, 833 F.3d 1060 (9th Cir. 2016) (en banc) (“With regard to medical needs, \n5 the due process clause imposes, at a minimum, the same duty the Eighth Amendment \n6 imposes: ‘persons in custody ha[ve] the established right to not have officials remain \n7 deliberately indifferent to their serious medical needs.’ This duty to provide medical \n8 care encompasses detainees’ psychiatric needs.”) (citation omitted).  “In order to \n9 comply with their duty not to engage in acts evidencing deliberate indifference to \n10 inmates’ medical and psychiatric needs, jails must provide medical staff who are \n11 ‘competent to deal with prisoners’ problems.’” Gibson, 290 F.3d at 1187 (quoting \n12 Hoptowit v. Ray, 682 F.2d 1237, 1253 (9th Cir. 1982)).   \n13 Here, Plaintiffs and class members have suffered serious psychological trauma \n14 as a result of the government’s conduct, and as such they need immediate \n15 psychological screening and appropriate mental health care by appropriately-trained \n16 therapists to prevent further trauma and injury. See supra at 5-11.  To be effective, \n17 such care must be provided to reunited families in an environment that does not \n18 continue or prolong the trauma.  See supra at 11-12.  Especially while class members \n19 remain in the government’s custody, effective care must be provided by the \n20 government.  \n21 Moreover, the government’s obligation to continue to provide effective, trauma-\n22 focused mental health care to Plaintiffs and class members remains in force for a \n23 period following their release.  The Ninth Circuit has recognized that as “a matter of \n24 common sense,” a prisoner’s ability to secure medication is “not necessarily restored \n25 the instant he walks through the prison gates and into the civilian world.” Wakefield, \n26 177 F.3d at 1164.  Instead, the court found that “it may take a number of days, or \n27 possibly even weeks, for a recently released prisoner to find a doctor, schedule an \n28 examination, obtain a diagnosis, and have a prescription filled.”  Accordingly, the \n  15 \nNOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT \nTHEREOF \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 45   Filed 07/18/18   Page 25 of 35   Page ID #:667\n \n1 Ninth Circuit held that to comply with its due process obligations, a government \n2 releasing a prisoner “who is receiving and continues to require medication” must \n3 provide the prisoner “with a supply sufficient to ensure that he has that medication \n4 available during the period of time reasonably necessary to permit him to consult a \n5 doctor and obtain a new supply.”  Id.; see also Cook v. California, No. 1:16-CV-\n6 00674-LJO-SAB, 2016 WL 4161114, at *5 (E.D. Cal. Aug. 5, 2016) (a three-month \n7 period following confinement could plausibly fall within the transitional period \n8 outlined in Wakefield). \n9 Similarly here, the government’s responsibility to provide effective \n10 psychological care extends beyond the period of confinement.  Many Plaintiffs and \n11 class members will be unable to immediately obtain effective mental health care upon \n12 release from detention.  As many Plaintiffs and class members have never lived in the \n13 United States, they are unlikely to know how to navigate the process of identifying an \n14 appropriate mental health care provider.  These difficulties are compounded by the \n15 fact that certain Plaintiffs and many class members do not speak English or Spanish, \n16 but instead speak languages that are not widely spoken in the United States.  Thus, the \n17 length of time the government’s obligation to provide effective mental health care will \n18 continue after the release of Plaintiffs and class members in this case is not yet known, \n19 but what is clear is that Plaintiffs have a right to trauma-appropriate mental health care \n20 for a reasonable period after their confinement has ended. \n21 B.  The Government Must Provide Effective Mental Health Care to \nPlaintiffs and Class Members to Remedy the Injury That It Caused.  \n22\nThe government is responsible for remedying the injuries that it caused to \n23\nPlaintiffs and class members under the “state-created danger” doctrine.  That doctrine \n24\napplies where “the state action ‘affirmatively place[s] the plaintiff in a position of \n25\ndanger,’ that is, where state action creates or exposes an individual to a danger which \n26\nhe or she would not have otherwise faced.” Kennedy, 439 F.3d at 1061 (quoting \n27\n28\n  16 \nNOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT \nTHEREOF \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 45   Filed 07/18/18   Page 26 of 35   Page ID #:668\n \n1 DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 197). 53  The Ninth Circuit has adopted a three-part test to \n2 determine whether this doctrine applies: “(1) whether any affirmative actions of the \n3 official placed the individual in danger he otherwise would not have faced; (2) \n4 whether the danger was known or obvious; (3) whether the officer acted with \n5 deliberate indifference to that danger.” Henry A., 678 F.3d at 1002.  In this case, \n6 Plaintiffs will succeed in demonstrating that each of these prongs is met. \n7 The Government Put Plaintiffs and Class Members in Danger.  The \n8 government’s actions satisfy the first prong of the Henry A. test because it \n9 affirmatively decided to separate Plaintiffs and class members from their children, \n10 directly inflicting trauma and injury on Plaintiffs and class members and exposing \n11 them to additional risk of future serious health problems that they would not face but \n12 for the government’s actions, including PTSD, anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, \n13 loss of appetite, and loss of sleep.  See supra at 5-10.  \n14 Neither Plaintiffs, class members, nor their children would have experienced \n15 this trauma, or the consequential risk of lifelong physical and mental illness, but for \n16 the government’s decision to separate Plaintiffs and class members from their \n17 children.  The government gratuitously exacerbated that injury by effecting that \n18 separation suddenly, using force, and without providing information about loved ones’ \n19 well-being or whereabouts, and with little or no communication between separated \n20 family members.  These deliberate actions by the government have injured Plaintiffs \n21 and class members, and the government is responsible for remedying that injury. \n22 Notably, the government’s actions that injured Plaintiffs and class members \n                                                \n23 53 The state-created danger doctrine is not limited to circumstances in which the \ngovernment bears sole responsibility for a particular risk – it applies in instances \n24 where a government official exposes an individual to additional risk. Penilla v. City of \nHuntington Park, 115 F.3d 707 (9th Cir. 1997) (per curiam) (doctrine applicable \n25 against police officers who, after finding a man in need of medical care, cancelled a \nrequest for paramedics and locked him inside his house); see also Estate of Gonzales \n26 v. Hickman, No. ED CV 05-00660 MMM (RCx), 2006 WL 4959780, at *13 (C.D. \nCal. Jan. 30, 2006) (“The name of the doctrine . . . is something of a misnomer. \n27 Liability is not restricted to situations where the state actors create a danger; rather \nstate actors who act affirmatively to increase an existing risk of danger . . . .”) \n28 (citations omitted).   \n  17 \nNOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT \nTHEREOF \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 45   Filed 07/18/18   Page 27 of 35   Page ID #:669\n \n1 have already been found likely to violate substantive due process.  The Ninth Circuit \n2 has held that executive action violates substantive due process when it “shocks the \n3 conscience.”  Porter v. Osborn, 546 F.3d 1131, 1137 (9th Cir. 2008); see generally \n4 Cty. of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 846–47 (1998) (collecting cases). That \n5 standard is “not subject to a rigid list of established elements.”  Ms. L. Case, Dkt. No. \n6 83 at 12 (citing Lewis, 523 U.S. at 850).  Instead, “an investigation into substantive \n7 due process involves an appraisal of the circumstances rather than a formalistic \n8 examination of fixed elements.”  Id. (citation omitted).  \n9 Here, it is abundantly clear that the government’s gratuitous and unnecessary \n10 separation of children from their parents meets this standard.  As Judge Sabraw \n11 recently found in the Ms. L. Case, the totality of the government’s conduct is likely to \n12 be found to “shock[] the conscience,” including the government’s separation of \n13 children from their parents without an individualized determination that the parents \n14 were unfit or presented a danger to their children (Ms. L. Case, Dkt. No. 83 at 12-13, \n15 17); its separation of parents who presented themselves at a point of entry and thus \n16 committed no crime from their children (id. at 13); and its implementation of the \n17 family separation policy “without any effective system or procedure for (1) tracking \n18 the children after they were separated from their parents, (2) enabling communication \n19 between the parents and their children after separation, and (3) reuniting the parents \n20 and children after the parents are returned to immigration custody following \n21 completion of their criminal sentence” (id. at 14). \n22 Here, the government’s conduct vis-à-vis Plaintiffs and class members is the \n23 same conduct found likely by Judge Sabraw to “shock the conscience” and thus \n24 violate due process.  This Court should accordingly find that Plaintiffs and class \n25 members are likely to prevail in showing that the government violated their \n26 substantive due process rights and that that violation injured them. \n27 The Government Knew That Separating Children From Parents Would \n28 Cause Injury. As to the second prong of the Henry A. test, the danger that forced \n  18 \nNOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT \nTHEREOF \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 45   Filed 07/18/18   Page 28 of 35   Page ID #:670\n \n1 separation of children from their parents would cause psychological and physical \n2 harm was known and obvious to Defendants. As set forth in the prior section, the \n3 danger of family separation is well-understood in the medical and psychological \n4 communities.  In fact, in a recent report, the government stated that “[s]tudies have \n5 found that both private and government-run residential institutions for children, or \n6 places such as orphanages and psychiatric wards that do not offer a family-based \n7 setting, cannot replicate the emotional companionship and attention found in family \n8 environments that are prerequisites to healthy cognitive development.”54 \n9 Courts themselves have frequently recognized that separating children from \n10 their parents is harmful to both.  See, e.g., Leiva-Perez v. Holder, 640 F.3d 962, 969-\n11 70 (9th Cir. 2011) (“separation from family members” identified as a factor in \n12 irreparable harm analysis); Halet v. Wend Inv. Co., 672 F.2d 1305, 1311 (9th Cir. \n13 1982) (“Family life, in particular the right of family members to live together, is part \n14 of the fundamental right of privacy” and noting that “[a] fundamental right is even \n15 more clearly involved” when it involves the right of children to live with their \n16 parents.”). \n17 The facts of this case establish that Defendants were aware of the harm that \n18 would be caused to Plaintiffs, class members, and their children by ripping apart \n19 families and failing to reunify them.

Kent Sch. Dist., 648 F.3d 965, 974 (9th Cir. \n4 2011). In evaluating whether a government official acted with deliberate indifference \n5 in the context of a due process claim, the Ninth Circuit recently held that “the proper \n6 standard of review for such claims is one of objective indifference, not subjective \n7 indifference.”  Gordon v. Cty. of Orange, 888 F.3d 1118, 1120–24 (9th Cir. 2018).  \n8 That is, a plaintiff must show that the government official took a harmful action \n9 notwithstanding that “a reasonable official in the circumstances would have \n10 appreciated the high degree of risk involved—making the consequences of the \n11 defendant’s conduct obvious.”  Id. at 1125.   \n12 Here, reasonable officials in the Defendants’ positions would have appreciated \n13 the high risk that ripping the Plaintiffs and class members from their small children \n14 would inflict psychological trauma and consequent harm.  As set forth above, experts, \n15 courts, and the government all have recognized that separating children from their \n16 parents inflicts trauma and imposes a high degree of risk that the separated family \n17 members will suffer psychological and physiological consequences for years to come.  \n18 See supra at 5-10.  Even if reasonable officials could somehow fail to anticipate what \n19 every human being would intuit, viz., that tearing families apart would impose a high \n20 risk of trauma, the heart-rending reactions of separated families (including at least one \n21 suicide) would put those officials on immediate notice of the harm they were \n22 inflicting.  In addition, there are a number of measures available that the government \n23 could have taken to avoid the harm caused here.  For example, the government could \n24 have kept families together by using community-based case management, such as the \n25 arbitrarily terminated Family Case Management Program. Compl. ¶¶ 7, 76-78.  \n26 Particularly in light of these alternatives, a reasonable government official would have \n27 appreciated that tearing families apart imposed a high risk of harm.

The Government Has Failed To Provide Adequate Mental Health \nScreenings and Treatment. \n2\n  The government has completely failed to provide effective, trauma-focused \n3\nmental health care screenings and treatment to Plaintiffs and class members, which is \n4\na further violation of their constitutional rights. \n5\n  The government has not staffed the detention facilities with therapists trained in \n6\nrecovery from traumatic experiences,55 and has not offered any family-based, trauma-\n7\ninformed treatment.  In fact, some “clinicians” who purportedly provide mental health \n8\nservices at centers where minors reside are not licensed mental health professionals.56  \n9\nEven as to children separated from their parents, who are at the greatest risk of \n10\nsuffering lifelong mental and physical harm as a result of the stress inflicted on them, \n11\nthe government does not provide specialized trauma-informed mental health care \n12\nservices, and does not routinely provide any mental health services at family detention \n13\ncenters operated by the Office of Refugee Resettlement.57  The government has thus \n14\nfallen far short of the constitutional standard of providing “medical staff who are \n15\ncompetent to deal with prisoners’ problems.” Gibson, 290 F.3d at 1187.  The \n16\ngovernment has also wholly abdicated its constitutional responsibilities to Plaintiffs \n17\nand class members who have been released from detention by providing absolutely no \n18\nmental health care screenings or services to any class members following their release.  \n19\nThe government’s failure to provide these mental health services constitutes a second \n20\nConstitutional violation. \n21\nII.

The \n24\ngovernment compounded that trauma and constitutional violation by failing to provide \n25\nPlaintiffs and class members the trauma-focused therapy that is their constitutional \n26\n                                                \n27 55 Mercado Decl. ¶ 4. \n56 Id. \n28 57 Id. \n  21 \nNOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT \nTHEREOF \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 45   Filed 07/18/18   Page 31 of 35   Page ID #:673\n \n1 due as detainees and as persons injured by the government’s violations of their rights.  \n2 The government’s failure to provide effective therapy itself violates the constitutional \n3 rights of Plaintiffs and class members, and thus constitutes irreparable harm.  Worse, \n4 however, the government’s failure to provide such treatment risks subjecting Plaintiffs \n5 and class members to a lifetime of psychological and physical problems, intangible \n6 injuries that cannot be remedied by monetary damages alone. \n7   “It is well established that the deprivation of constitutional rights \n8 unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.”  Hernandez v. Sessions, 872 F.3d 976, \n9 994 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting Melendres v. Arpaio, 695 F.3d 990, 1002 (9th Cir. \n10 2012)).  As set forth above at 14-20, the government’s ongoing failure to provide \n11 effective, trauma-focused therapy to Plaintiffs and class members violates its \n12 constitutional obligations to them, both as persons who were or are detained by the \n13 government, and as persons injured by the government’s unconstitutional policy of \n14 separating parents from their children.  This violation alone constitutes irreparable \n15 injury. \n16 Without the injunctive relief sought by this motion, Plaintiffs and class \n17 members also are likely to suffer lifelong intangible injuries, which also constitute \n18 irreparable harm.  In Arizona Dream Act Coalition v. Brewer, the Ninth Circuit \n19 explained that “[i]rreparable harm is traditionally defined as harm for which there is \n20 no adequate legal remedy, such as an award of damages.” 757 F.3d 1053, 1068 (9th \n21 Cir. 2014).  In that case, which challenged Arizona’s policy of refusing to issue \n22 driver’s licenses to beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals \n23 program, the Ninth Circuit held that Arizona’s policy caused the plaintiffs to suffer \n24 irreparable harm because the plaintiffs’ inability to obtain driver’s licenses “limit[ed] \n25 their professional opportunities” and “diminished their opportunity to pursue their \n26 chosen professions.” Id.  It found that “[t]he irreparable nature of Plaintiffs’ injury is \n27 heightened by Plaintiffs’ young age and fragile socioeconomic position.  Setbacks \n28 early in their careers are likely to haunt Plaintiffs for the rest of their lives.” Id.  It \n  22 \nNOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT \nTHEREOF \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 45   Filed 07/18/18   Page 32 of 35   Page ID #:674\n \n1 noted that “[n]o award of damages can compensate Plaintiffs[] for the myriad personal \n2 and professional harms caused by their inability to obtain driver’s licenses.  Thus, \n3 Plaintiffs are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction.”  Id. \n4 Here, the harm caused by the government’s failure to provide effective mental \n5 health care and screenings to Plaintiffs and class members are more profound than the \n6 harm in Arizona Dream Act Coalition.  Absent such therapy, Plaintiffs and class \n7 members risk a lifetime of mental health conditions including PTSD, depression, and \n8 anxiety, which have consequences including an increased risk of suicide and \n9 professional and social difficulties.  See supra at 5-10.  All of these conditions, if \n10 realized, will diminish Plaintiffs’ and class members’ professional opportunities and \n11 life prospects in myriad ways.  Accordingly, the government’s failure to provide the \n12 constitutionally-required screenings and treatment constitutes irreparable harm under \n13 the standard set forth in Arizona Dream Act Coalition.  This is precisely the type of \n14 harm that warrants the injunctive relief requested here.  See Hernandez, 872 F.3d at \n15 999 (noting that injunction is appropriate where maintenance of “the status quo . . . is \n16 exactly what will inflict the irreparable injury”) (citation omitted). \n \n17 III.  THE BALANCE OF HARDSHIPS FAVORS THE INJUNCTION. \n18 The government needlessly traumatized Plaintiffs by forcibly separating them \n19 from their children and continuing to keep them apart.  Beginning to appropriately \n20 treat that trauma is in the public interest and outweighs any purported injury the \n21 government may assert.  As explained above (at 14-20), the Due Process Clause \n22 requires that Plaintiffs be provided with trauma-focused mental health services.  These \n23 mental health services are plainly in the interests of Plaintiffs and class members, as \n24 they are the sole means by which the harm inflicted by the government might be \n25 mitigated. \n26 On the other hand, ordering the government to provide treatment does no harm \n27 because it simply requires the government to live up to its constitutional and legal \n28 obligations.  See Rodriguez v. Robbins, 715 F.3d 1127, 1145 (9th Cir. 2013) (citing \n  23 \nNOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT \nTHEREOF \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 45   Filed 07/18/18   Page 33 of 35   Page ID #:675\n \n1 Zepeda v. I.N.S., 753 F.2d 719, 727 (9th Cir. 1983) (“[T]he INS cannot reasonably \n2 assert that it is harmed in any legally cognizable sense by being enjoined from \n3 constitutional violations.”)); Haskins v. Stanton, 794 F.2d 1273, 1277 (7th Cir. 1986) \n4 (where an injunction seeks to require defendants to comply with existing law, the \n5 injunction imposes no burden but “merely seeks to prevent the defendants from \n6 shirking their responsibilities”).58  The balance of hardships favors the injunction. \n7 IV.  THE PUBLIC INTEREST FAVORS THE INJUNCTION.   \n8 The requested injunction serves the interest of the general public by ensuring \n9 that the government complies with its constitutional obligations.  This alone is \n10 sufficient to justify entry of the requested injunction.  See Hernandez, 872 F.3d at 996 \n11 (“public interest concerns are implicated when a constitutional right has been violated, \n12 because all citizens have a stake in upholding the Constitution.”). Melendres, 695 F.3d \n13 at 1002 (“[I]t is always in the public interest to prevent the violation of a party’s \n14 constitutional rights.” (internal quotation omitted)); see also United States v. Raines, \n15 362 U.S. 17, 27 (1960) (“[T]here is the highest public interest in the due observance of \n16 all the constitutional guarantees.”). \n17 The injunction also serves the public interest by reducing “the indirect hardship \n18 to . . . friends and family members” of the Plaintiffs and class members.  Hernandez, \n19 872 F.3d at 996.  Without effective, trauma-focused screening and treatment, the \n20 psychological and physical health conditions that Plaintiffs and class members may \n21 suffer will place heavy burdens on their friends and family members, both as a result \n22 of the care to Plaintiffs and class members that friends and family members may be \n23 required to provide directly or pay for, and as a result of the diminution in the ability \n24 of Plaintiffs and class members to act as breadwinners and caretakers. \n25                                                 \n58 In the event the government claims that providing appropriate mental health care \n26 creates a financial burden, the Ninth Circuit has repeatedly rejected such arguments.  \nSee, e.g., Hernandez, 872 F.3d at 996 (“Faced with such a conflict between financial \n27 concerns and preventable human suffering, we have little difficulty concluding that \nthe balance of hardships tips decidedly in plaintiffs’ favor.” (internal quotation marks \n28 omitted)); see also M.R. v. Dreyfus, 697 F.3d 706, 737-38 (9th Cir. 2012). \n  24 \nNOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT \nTHEREOF \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 45   Filed 07/18/18   Page 34 of 35   Page ID #:676\n \n1 Finally, allowing the suffering of Plaintiffs and class members to continue \n2 untreated is contrary to the public interest.  See Norsworthy v. Beard, 87 F. Supp. 3d \n3 1164, 1194 (N.D. Cal. 2015) (“[t]here is no public interest in [Plaintiff]’s continued \n4 suffering during the pendency of this litigation”). The public interest favors the \n5 injunctive relief requested in this motion. \n6 CONCLUSION \n7   Plaintiffs and class members are entitled to mental health care screenings and \n8 effective family treatment to address and remediate the effects of the trauma that the \n9 government wantonly and knowingly inflicted on them under its unconstitutional \n10 policy of separating parents from their children.  The government has wholly failed to \n11 provide such treatment, violating its constitutional obligations to care for persons it \n12 detains and on whom it has inflicted injury.  The balance of harms and public interest \n13 favor requiring the government to live up to its obligations.  The Court should enter an \n14 injunction requiring the government to provide meaningful access to: \n15 •  mental health screening for all Plaintiffs and class members to identify those \nwho require further treatment as a result of the trauma inflicted on them, which \n16 must be performed by persons trained to recognize the signs and symptoms of \nsuch trauma, within fourteen (14) days of the entry of the Court’s injunction; \n17\n•  subsequent mental health screening for all Plaintiffs and class members to \n18 identify those who require further treatment as a result of the trauma inflicted \non them, which must be performed by persons trained to recognize the signs \n19 and symptoms of such trauma, within fourteen (14) days of the reunification of \nthe Plaintiff or class member with his/her child(ren) if such reunification takes \n20 place after the screening ordered as referenced above;  \n21 •  mental health care treatment, for those Plaintiffs and class members whose \nscreenings indicate that such treatment is needed, which must: \n22\no  be provided in a safe environment that will not reinforce trauma; \n23\no  be provided on a family basis to all members of the reunified family \n24 together; \n25 o  be provided in a culturally competent manner by mental health clinicians \ntrained in evidence-based trauma-informed interventions; and \n26\no  be provided for a period of time sufficient to treat the trauma inflicted; \n27 and \n28 •  such other relief as is permitted by law. \n  25 \nNOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT \nTHEREOF \n\nCase 2:18-cv-06081-JAK-SK   Document 45   Filed 07/18/18   Page 35 of 35   Page ID #:677\n \n1  \n2 Dated:  July 18, 2018  Respectfully Submitted, \n3 MARK ROSENBAUM (SBN 59940)  /s/ Amy P.
