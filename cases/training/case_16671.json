First, the Tribe asks that six documents be included in the administrative record. There is a dispute about whether these documents were properly before the Corps when it made its permitting decisions, and thus whether they should be included in the administrative record. As the Court has reviewed the documents and concluded that they would not change the outcome in its 239 Opinion on the various Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment, the Court need not resolve this procedural question and therefore DENIES the Motion to Supplement. Second, and in the alternative, the Tribe asks that the Court consider eight extra-record documents. The Court DENIES the Motion to Consider Documents Outside the Administrative Record for the same reasons given in its 239 Opinion regarding Standing Rock's request that the Court consider extra-record evidence.

As Cheyenne River points out that Standing Rock will shortly seek amendment of its Complaint, see Mot. at 5-6, the Court believes the wiser course is for the two Plaintiffs to file one Amended Complaint, setting forth the separate (or joint) claims each wishes to make. If either Plaintiff believes it would somehow be prejudiced by such a course of action, the Court ORDERS that it may file a pleading by September 30, 2016, articulating such prejudice.

          "description": "MINUTE ORDER: In its 220 Motion to Supplement the Administrative Record and Alternative Motion to Consider Documents Outside the Administrative Record, Cheyenne River makes two separate arguments. First, the Tribe asks that six documents be included in the administrative record. There is a dispute about whether these documents were properly before the Corps when it made its permitting decisions, and thus whether they should be included in the administrative record. As the Court has reviewed the documents and concluded that they would not change the outcome in its 239 Opinion on the various Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment, the Court need not resolve this procedural question and therefore DENIES the Motion to Supplement. Second, and in the alternative, the Tribe asks that the Court consider eight extra-record documents. The Court DENIES the Motion to Consider Documents Outside the Administrative Record for the same reasons given in its 239 Opinion regarding Standing Rock's request that the Court consider extra-record evidence.

As Movant-Intervenors' [145-1] Proposed Complaint adds President Trump as a defendant and seeks relief beyond that sought by the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux Tribes, such intervention would unduly expand the scope of the case. If Movant-Intervenors wish to proceed against President Trump, either individually or in his official capacity, they must file a separate action. If they wish to join this case under the conditions stated herein, the Court will grant their Motion to Intervene. They shall file a notice by June 20, 2017, indicating their position.

    "summary": "<p>On July 27, 2016, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The Tribe, represented by Earthjustice, sued the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to block the Corps’ actions related to the Dakota Access Pipeline (a 1,168-mile crude oil pipeline running from North Dakota to Illinois).  The Tribe sought injunctive and declaratory relief and attorneys’ fees and costs under the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA), the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), the Clean Water Act (CWA), and the Rivers and Harbors Act (RHA). The case was assigned to Judge James E. Boasberg.</p><p>The Tribe challenged the application of Nationwide Permit 12, which authorized discharges into federal waters, but which was issued without meeting NHPA requirements. The Tribe also challenged the issuance of multiple federal authorizations that were needed to construct certain segments of the pipeline. The plaintiff alleged that these authorizations were made in violation of the CWA and its governing regulations and without compliance with NHPA and NEPA.</p><p>On August 4, 2016, the plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction requiring the Corps to withdraw Nationwide Permit 12 as applied to the Dakota Access Pipeline and to withdraw verifications issued for the Dakota Access Pipeline to discharge in federally regulated waters at 204 sites along the pipeline route. </p><p>The following day, Dakota Access, LLC (the company authorized to construct the pipeline), filed an unopposed motion to intervene as a defendant. The court granted this motion on August 8, 2016.</p><p>On August 10, 2016, the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe moved to intervene as plaintiff. The court granted this motion on August 19, 2016.</p><p>To prevent further destruction of sacred and culturally significant sites near Lake Oahe, North Dakota, the Standing Rock Tribe filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO). The Cheyenne River Tribe filed a separate motion for a similar TRO, additionally asking the court to enjoin Dakota Access from harming and antagonizing members of the Tribe who were peacefully protesting at the site of construction.</p><p>On September 8, 2016, the Cheyenne River Tribe filed an amended complaint with allegations similar to the complaint of the Standing Rock Tribe. Additionally, it alleged violations of the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851, the Sioux Nation Treaty of 1868, and the Flood Control Act of 1944.</p><p>On September 9, 2016, the court denied the plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction, finding that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate that the court could prevent damage to important cultural resources by enjoining the Corps’ issuance of pipeline-related permits. 205 F.Supp.3d 4. That same day, the plaintiffs appealed the court’s decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On January 18, 2017, the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the decision of the lower court and dismissed the appeal.</p><p>On November 15, 2016, Dakota Access filed an answer to Cheyenne River Tribe’s first amended complaint that included crossclaims against the Corps. This cross-claim sought a judgment declaring that Dakota Access had legal right-of-way, within the meaning of the Mineral Leasing Act, to build and operate an oil pipeline beneath the federal land that borders Lake Oahe. On December 5, 2016, Dakota Access moved for summary judgment on this cross-claim.</p><p>On January 6, 2017, the Corps moved to dismiss Dakota Access’ cross-claim, arguing that Dakota Access did not plausibly allege that the United States Department of the Army had completed the administrative decision-making process required to grant Dakota Access an easement to install a pipeline under Corps-managed Federal land at Lake Oahe, pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act. </p><p>On that same day, the Cheyenne River Tribe moved to dismiss Dakota Access’ cross-claim for lack of ripeness, as its claim challenged an agency action that was not yet final. In the alternative, it requested the court to enter summary judgment against Dakota Access’ cross-claim.</p><p>On February 9, 2017, the Cheyenne River Tribe moved for a preliminary injunction directing the Corps to withdraw the easement/right-of-way allowing Dakota Access to drill an oil pipeline under federally-owned lands. On March 7, 2017, the court denied this motion, finding that the Tribe had failed to show that the Corps’ decision to grant an easement to Dakota Access constituted a substantial burden on its members’ free exercise of religion. 239 F.Supp.3d 77. The Tribe appealed this decision to the District of Columbia Circuit but then voluntarily dismissed the appeal.</p><p>Also on February 9, 2017, the Cheyenne River Tribe moved for an ex parte TRO to halt construction and drilling of an oil pipeline under federally-owned lands.</p><p>In the meantime, President Donald Trump took office. Within days of his inauguration, President Trump directed the Corps to “review and approve” pipeline permits on an expedited basis. The Corps obeyed this direction, and on February 8, 2017, it issued the easement and summarily terminated the environmental impact statement process. After the permit was issued, construction began. On February 14, 2017, the Standing Rock Tribe sought partial summary judgment on this issue, claiming that this easement decision, as well as the Corps’ July regulatory actions and accompanying NEPA analysis, violated the Administrative Procedure Act. The Cheyenne River Tribe made a similar motion; the Corps and Dakota Access also moved for summary judgment (in two motions that are not available on the docket). In response to all of these motions, on June 14, 2017, the court found the Corps’ environmental analysis unlawful, and remanded the matter to the Corps for further analysis. 255 F.Supp.3d 101.</p><p>While those motions were pending, in March 2017 the court ordered that this case be consolidated with <i>Yankton Sioux Tribe v. United States Army Corps of Engineers</i> and <i>Oglala Sioux Tribe v. United States Army Corps of Engineers</i>. </p><p>The Cheyenne River Tribe filed a second amended complaint against Dakota Access and Corps on June 14, 2017, seeking additional declaratory relief. The Standing Rock Tribe filed a first amended complaint, alleging violations under the Mineral Leasing Act, the Fort Laramie Treaty, and the Flood Control Act. </p><p>On December 4, 2017, in order to mitigate the risk of potential oil spills during the pendency of the litigation, the court ordered the parties to coordinate to finalize a spill response plan for the tribal areas in dispute. 280 F.Supp.3d 187. The court also ordered Dakota Access, with input from the Tribes, to select a third-party independent expert to review conditions and assess the pipeline’s compliance. Finally, Dakota Access was required to submit bi-monthly reports to the court.</p><p>On March 19, 2018, the court dismissed the Tribes’ NHPA claims as moot (in light of the completed construction of the pipeline), and granted summary judgment to the Corps and Dakota Access on the treaty-based claims and the NEPA claims. 301 F.Supp.3d 50.</p><p>On December 12, 2018, the court entered judgment in favor of the Corps and Dakota Access on the plaintiffs’ RFRA claims (by the plaintiffs’ consent). The court also ruled that the Tribes could argue that their NHPA claims were not, in fact, moot. </p><p>On January 3, 2019, the court permitted the plaintiffs to file 4 supplemental complaints, alleging that the Corps’ decision to affirm its original decision (on remand) was arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, NEPA, and the Tribes’ treaty rights. </p><p>On March 25, 2020, the court granted partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs, ruling that the Corps had violated NEPA by determining that an environmental impact statement was unnecessary; it ordered the Corps to complete an environmental impact statement. Correspondingly, the court ordered the parties to brief the question of whether the original easement should be vacated during the pendency of this second remand. In the same order, the court granted summary judgment to the Corps and Dakota Access on the Tribes’ renewed NHPA claims and on the Oglala Tribe’s claims under the Mni Waconi Act of 1988. 2020 WL 1441923. </p><p>In May 2020, the court received nearly a dozen amicus briefs. These included a brief from 14 states, another from 37 members of Congress, and a third brief from 28 federally recognized Indian tribes and related organizations. </p><p>On July 6, 2020, the court vacated the easement which had authorized construction of the pipeline under the Missouri River near Lake Oahe. It ordered that the pipeline must be closed and emptied by August 5, to remain closed until the Corps completed  an Environmental Impact Statement (which was expected to take until 2021). 2020 WL 3634426. Dakota Access immediately appealed to the D.C. Circuit; the district court denied a motion for stay on July 9, 2020.</p><p>On July 14, 2020, the D.C. Circuit (Judges Rogers, Griffith, and Pillard) issued an administrative stay of the district court’s order regarding closure of the pipeline.  </p><p>On August 5, it denied the motion to stay the district court’s order vacating the original easement; however, although that ruling stood (and the pipeline was therefore not legally authorized), the D.C. Circuit found that the district court had not made the “findings necessary for injunctive relief” under the four-factor test in <i>Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council</i>.  The court therefore remanded to the district court for further consideration, indicating that the Corps must clarify its position on continued operation of the pipeline in view of the vacated easement, after which the district court could take further action as appropriate.  As of August 26, 2020, further proceedings are pending in the district court.</p>",

In 2017, it remanded several National \nEnvironmental Policy Act issues to the Army Corps of Engineers for reconsideration.  The Corps \nhas now issued its decision on remand, which is the subject of challenges from Plaintiffs, \nassorted American Indian Tribes.  The substance of those challenges is not yet at issue; instead, \nthe Court now addresses a threshold matter.  Plaintiffs have moved for the inclusion of several \ndocuments and sets of documents in the administrative record that they believe were considered \n1  \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 418   Filed 05/08/19   Page 2 of 13\nby the agency but improperly excluded.  Finding merit in some of these requests but not in \nothers, the Court will grant in part and deny in part the Motion to Complete the Administrative \nRecord. \nI.  Background \nThe legal and factual background of this case has been laid out extensively in the Court’s \nprior Opinions.  Only a small subset is relevant to the present dispute. \nOn June 14, 2017, the Court ruled on cross-motions for partial summary judgment \nrelating to “the Corps’ alleged failure to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act” \nwhen it “grant[ed] permits to Dakota Access to construct and operate [the pipeline] under Lake \nOahe.”  Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs (Standing Rock III), 255 F. \nSupp. 3d 101, 112 (D.D.C. 2017).  NEPA requires that an agency “prepare an Environmental \nImpact Statement [(EIS)] for any proposed major federal action ‘significantly affecting the \nquality of the human environment.’”  Id. at 113 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C)).  To determine \nwhether it must prepare an EIS, an agency “first drafts an Environmental Assessment [(EA)].”  \nId.  “If, after preparing an EA, the agency determines that an EIS is not necessary, it must \nprepare a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) setting forth the reasons why the action will \nnot have any significant impact on the environment.”  Id.  If there will be no significant impact \non the environment because of the agency’s commitment to ensure mitigation measures are \nperformed, it prepares a Mitigated FONSI.  Id.  In this case, the Corps determined, after \npreparing an EA, that a Mitigated FONSI was all that was required.  Id. at 116. \nThe Court found that “the Corps’ decision . . . largely complied with NEPA,” but with \n“substantial exceptions.”  Id. at 147.  Consequently, it remanded to the Corps to consider: “(1) \nthe degree to which the project’s effects are likely to be highly controversial; (2) the \n2  \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 418   Filed 05/08/19   Page 3 of 13\nconsequences of a spill for the Tribes’ fishing and hunting rights; and (3) the environmental-\njustice impacts of the project.”  Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs \n(Standing Rock IV), 282 F. Supp. 3d 91, 96 (D.D.C. 2017) (citing Standing Rock III, 255 F. \nSupp. 3d at 111–12). \nThe Corps completed the remand process on August 31, 2018.  See ECF No. 407, Exh. \nA-1 (Remand Administrative Record) at 1.  It “conclude[d] that a formal reconsideration of the \n. . . [EA] and [FONSI] or the preparation of supplemental [NEPA] documentation [was] not \nrequired.”  Id.  That is, upon further analysis, it stood by its prior conclusions.  Plaintiffs have \nnow moved to complete the Administrative Record on which the Corps relied in reaching its \ndecision after remand.  See ECF No. 401 (Plaintiffs’ Motion).  In doing so, they seek to have the \nCorps add documents that they contend it actually considered in its decision.  Id. at 4.  Plaintiffs \nrequest, consequently, that the Court “direct the Corps to complete the record” with the \ndocuments they enumerate.  Id. at 5.  The purpose of their effort is to ensure that the Court has \ncertain material before it when assessing the merits of the Corps’ decision on remand. \nII.  Legal Standard \nIn any regulatory challenge, the Court’s “review is to be based on the full administrative \nrecord that was before the Secretary at the time [s]he made h[er] decision.”  Citizens to Preserve \nOverton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 420 (1971); see also 5 U.S.C. § 706 (“[T]he court \nshall review the whole record or those parts of it cited by a party.”).  As part of the record, the \nCourt may consider “any document that might have influenced the agency’s decision” and not \nmerely those documents the agency expressly relied on in reaching its final determination.  See \nNat’l Courier Ass’n v. Bd. of Governors of Fed. Reserve Sys., 516 F.2d 1229, 1241 (D.C. Cir. \n1975); see also Amfac Resorts, LLC v. U.S. Dep’t of the Interior, 143 F. Supp. 2d 7, 12 (D.D.C. \n3  \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 418   Filed 05/08/19   Page 4 of 13\n2001).  The goal, ultimately, is for the Court to have before it a “record that delineates the path \nby which [the agency] reached its decision.”  Occidental Petroleum Corp. v. SEC, 873 F.2d 325, \n338 (D.C. Cir. 1989). \nAnd so the agency is responsible for producing such administrative record.  See Univ. of \nColo. Health at Mem. Hosp. v. Burwell, 151 F. Supp. 3d 1, 12 (D.D.C. 2015).  When the agency \ndoes so, the record “is entitled to a strong presumption of regularity.”  Sara Lee Corp. v. Am. \nBakers Ass’n, 252 F.R.D. 31, 34 (D.D.C. 2008); see also Marcum v. Salazar, 751 F. Supp. 2d 74, \n78 (D.D.C. 2010).  A plaintiff may show that the record is “[i]nsufficien[t]” — i.e., incomplete \n— only if she is able to “specif[y] . . . documents that ha[ve] been omitted.”  NRDC v. Train, 519 \nF.2d 287, 291 (D.C. Cir. 1975).  In other words, “a plaintiff must put forth concrete evidence” \nand “identify reasonable, non-speculative grounds for its belief that the documents were \nconsidered by the agency and not included in the record.”  Marcum, 751 F. Supp. 2d at 78 \n(quoting Pac. Shores Subdivision Cal. Water Dist. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 448 F. Supp. 2d \n1, 6 (D.D.C. 2006)).  Then, if the Court finds that the record produced “clearly do[es] not \nconstitute the ‘whole record’ compiled by the agency,” it will order the agency to complete the \nrecord.  See Overton Park, 401 U.S. at 419 (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 706). \nIII.  Analysis \nThe instant dispute revolves around three categories of documents Plaintiffs believe \nshould have been included in the record.  They originally sought five but have apparently \naccepted the Corps’ representation that the other two either were not considered or already \nappear in the record — namely, those relating to a third-party audit and final versions of \ndocuments they believed were provided only in draft.  See ECF No. 405 (Plaintiffs’ Reply) at \n11–12.  At issue here, consequently, are: (1) sources discussed in the Remand Analysis; (2) \n4  \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 418   Filed 05/08/19   Page 5 of 13\ndocuments Plaintiffs maintain should have been included in the prior Administrative Record \nunderlying the Corps’ original NEPA decision; and (3) documents related to the terms of Dakota \nAccess’s easement to operate the pipeline at Lake Oahe.  The Court will address each in turn. \nA.  Sources Discussed in Remand Analysis \n  Plaintiffs first contend that the “Remand Analysis cites to and relies on a number of \ntechnical supporting documents that are not in the record.”  Pl. Mot. at 8.  Several of these the \nCorps has agreed should properly have been included and has thus committed to add them.  See \nECF No. 402 (Defendant’s Opposition) at 4, 17.  Remaining at issue, therefore, are a report on \npipeline spills and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) data \nunderlying it; technical citations from the EA cited in the Remand Analysis; and the list of \nreferences and sources cited within “two key supporting technical documents that support the \nRemand Decision” — the “Downstream Receptor Report” (DRR) and the “Spill Model Report” \n(SMR).  See Pl. Mot. at 8, 9.  In addition to specifically enumerating those documents, Plaintiffs \nalso request generally that the “Corps . . . complete the record with all sources cited in the \nRemand Analysis.”  Id. at 10.  The Court will begin with the report derived from PHMSA data \nbefore moving to the sources cited in the Remand Analysis and, finally, the sources cited within \nthe DRR and SMR. \n  The Tribes believe that, rather than including the report on pipeline spills or underlying \nPHMSA data in the record, the Corps provided only a website where one could generate a new \nreport.  Id. at 8.  Inclusion of the website, they contend, is no substitute.  Id.  The Corps rejoins \nthat the information Plaintiffs request is “already contained within the record.”  See Def. Opp. at \n6.  In the Remand Analysis, the Corps — based on annual reporting data from PHMSA’s website \n— “analyzed the frequency of reported hazardous liquid ‘accidents.’”  RAR 14 & n.4; see Def. \n5  \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 418   Filed 05/08/19   Page 6 of 13\nOpp., Exh. 1 (Declaration of Colonel John L. Hudson), ¶ 3.  The Remand Analysis expresses that \ndata in a series of tables.  See RAR 15–16.  Plaintiffs have not offered reasonable, non-\nspeculative grounds to believe that the agency had access to additional data or reports that are not \nincluded.  Indeed, they barely press this claim in their Reply.  See Pl. Reply at 2–5.  The Court, \naccordingly, finds that no additional documents are required on this score. \n  Next, Plaintiffs posit that the record ought to include, apparently, both the material \nunderlying the technical citations from the EA that appears in block quotations in the Remand \nAnalysis and “all sources cited in the Remand Analysis.”  Pl. Mot. at 10.  Rather than contending \nthat these documents lack sufficient indicia of consideration, the Corps instead responds only \nthat Plaintiffs’ request fails for lack of specificity.  Plaintiffs must, in the Corps’ view, request \nparticular documents, rather than this broad category.  See Def. Opp. at 6.  The Corps’ exacting \nposition finds no support in the case law, however.  While requesters may not satisfy their burden \nto identify specific documents by asking for amorphous categories of information that may or \nmay not exist or have been before the agency, see, e.g., Charleston Area Med. Ctr. v. Burwell, \n216 F. Supp. 3d 18, 25–26 (D.D.C. 2016); Comm. of 100 on the Fed. City v. Foxx, 140 F. Supp. \n3d 54, 60–61 (D.D.C. 2015), it is not legally necessary for Plaintiffs to enumerate every \ndocument they want in a list or appendix. \n  Additional specificity would, however, have been helpful since the Remand Analysis is \nwell over a hundred pages.  It is clear, at least, that Plaintiffs are entitled to more than what the \nCorps has now agreed to include in the record.  For example, the Tribes specifically request an \nO’Reilly study cited by the Remand Analysis, contending its use is sufficient indication that \nagency decisionmakers considered it.  See Pl. Mot. at 8–9.  The Corps has agreed that that study \nis properly included in the record.  See Def. Opp. at 17.  Yet, as Plaintiffs point out, see Pl. Reply \n6  \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 418   Filed 05/08/19   Page 7 of 13\nat 4–5, the Remand Analysis cites several additional studies on the same page for similar \npropositions.  The Corps has not agreed to include those, nor explained how, in its view, the \nO’Reilly study is distinguishable from the others.  There seem also to be additional sources in the \nRemand Analysis that, like those studies, are cited to support a factual proposition.  And while \nthe Corps is correct that a mere reference to a document is not sufficient to meet a movant’s \nburden to show that the agency actually considered it, see Franks v. Salazar, 751 F. Supp. 2d 62, \n70 (D.D.C. 2010), citation of a source to support a factual proposition is generally enough to \nmanifest actual consideration by the agency and support inclusion in the record.  See Oceana, \nInc. v. Ross, 290 F. Supp. 3d 73, 79–80 (D.D.C. 2018) (reasoning that “documents . . . that were \ncited substantively, i.e. to justify a factual statement or assertion made in the [decisional \ndocument] . . . [were] clearly considered” while “mere mention of a document’s existence” does \nnot show agency consideration).  The Court, accordingly, will require Plaintiffs, within fourteen \ndays, to file a Notice containing a list of sources substantively cited in the Remand Analysis to \nsupport a factual proposition.  The Corps should, in the fourteen days thereafter, indicate which, \nif any, of those documents it objects to including in the record.  The Court will resolve any \ndisagreement that persists. \n  Finally, Plaintiffs request all sources cited in the DRR and SMR.  See Pl. Mot. at 9.  \nThese reports themselves are heavily cited in the Remand Analysis, and they appear in the \nrecord.  Plaintiffs’ request to include all documents cited within the DRR and SMR, however, \nfalls short because they have offered no reasonable, non-speculative basis to believe that the \nagency considered those citations.  The DRR and SMR were prepared by a third party, and \nalthough the Corps relied on them, there is no suggestion the agency also actually relied on the \nsources those reports cite.  Plaintiffs cite to a case holding that documents cited in an EIS must \n7  \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 418   Filed 05/08/19   Page 8 of 13\nbe included in the record.  See Pl. Mot. at 10 (citing Oceana, 290 F. Supp. at 79).  Yet the EIS is \nprepared by the agency itself; the reports in question were not.  Plaintiffs protest that, although \nthe SMR and DRR were prepared by a third party, the Corps relied on them so heavily that they \nare functionally part of the decision and that the sources cited therein are equivalent to those \ncited by the Remand Analysis.  See Pl. Reply at 5–6.  Yet the Corps’ heavy reliance on the \nreports suggests only that they should be in the record, as they are.  Requiring otherwise would \nstretch the chain of indirect consideration ad infinitum.  Plaintiffs offer no authority for the \nproposition that agencies must include in the record all sources cited within the documents on \nwhich they rely — or even heavily rely — in preparing their decision.  That absence makes \nsense, since there is no indication here that agency decisionmakers considered not only the \nreports but every source they cite. \n  B.  Documents from Original Administrative Record \n  Plaintiffs next explain that they have now reviewed the original administrative record — \nthe one the Corps lodged in March 2017, related to its February 2017 Lake Oahe easement \ndecision — and identified several “documents that were missing from it.”  Pl. Mot. at 10–11.  In \nparticular, they identify the absence of a “spill model” in the original record, which would be \n“important to the Tribes’ challenge of the remand decision.”  Id. at 11.  In addition, they contend \nthat a “key document in the original administrative record was a lengthy review compiling and \nresponding to internal technical comments,” and that it “in turn references several critical \ncomments that bear directly on the adequacy of the Corps’ analysis.”  Id.  Those comments \nreferred to or elicited responses that are not themselves in the record.  Id.  Finally, Plaintiffs point \nto “other examples,” including a mention of an email — not itself in the record — that “provided \nthe rationale” for certain calculations.  Id. at 12.  In Plaintiffs’ view, these documents “were \n8  \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 418   Filed 05/08/19   Page 9 of 13\ndirectly relevant to the Corps’ decision, . . . plainly relate to whether the Corps’ original decision \nwas arbitrary and capricious,” and “will help the Tribes explain why the Corps’ conclusions on \nremand ignore critical information and fail to address contrary conclusions.”  Id. \nAs an initial matter, the Court is dubious about the Tribes’ contention that it is raising \nthese claims now because “there was never an opportunity for any plaintiff Tribe to challenge the \nscope or adequacy of the original administrative record during the initial round of summary \njudgment motions.”  Id. at 10.  The Corps lodged the record at issue over two years ago — in \nMarch 2017 — and Dakota Access challenged the record’s completeness not long afterward.  \nSee ECF No. 216 (Dakota Access’s Motion to Compel Prompt Completion of the Administrative \nRecord).  In June 2017, the Court ruled on Plaintiffs’ claims challenging the decision that the \nrecord underlies.  While the Tribes are correct, therefore, that they have not flouted a specific \ndeadline to challenge that record’s completeness, see Pl. Reply at 7, their claims are less than \ntimely and, in any event, are moot given that the Court has already passed on the lawfulness of \nthe agency decision supported by that record. \nIt would not be appropriate to add those documents to the record at issue here, moreover, \nbecause Plaintiffs have not made any showing that any of these documents were actually before \nagency decisionmakers in the remand process.  Their assertions that the documents were relevant \nto the lawfulness of the original decision or provide additional information Plaintiffs could use to \nrebut the Corps’ conclusions on remand do not conform to that standard.  The question is not \nwhether the documents would now be useful to Plaintiffs, but whether they can provide \n“reasonable, non-speculative grounds for [the] belief that the documents were considered by the \n9  \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 418   Filed 05/08/19   Page 10 of 13\nagency and not included in the record.”  Marcum, 751 F. Supp. 2d at 78 (quoting Pac. Shores, \n448 F. Supp. 2d at 6).  That they have not done. \n  C.  Documents Relating to Easement \n  Finally, Plaintiffs point out that under the terms of the easement, Dakota Access is \n“required to submit to the Corps” an “extensive body of technical information . . . related to the \nintegrity and ongoing safe operation of the pipeline at Lake Oahe.”  Pl. Mot. at 13.  Three reports \n— including any root-case-failure analyses, inspection reports from the cathodic protection \nsystems, and an annual report with any deviations from limits imposed to reduce corrosion — are \nat issue.  Id. at 13–14.  (Plaintiffs concede, however, based on the Corps’ representation that the \nfirst of those does not exist — because no failure has occurred requiring its generation — that it \nneed not be included in the record, leaving two at issue.  See Pl. Reply at 10.)  Additionally, \nDakota Access is required to submit an operations and maintenance manual, an integrity-\nmanagement plan, and “as-built drawings” for the Lake Oahe crossing.  See Pl. Mot. at 13.  The \nrecord should be completed with these documents, Plaintiffs maintain, because they “are \ncentrally relevant to the issues before the Corps on remand, [since] they bear[] on the integrity \nand safe operation of the pipeline.”  Id. at 14.  These contentions are a mixed bag for the Tribes.  \nBecause the documents require differing treatment, the Court will analyze them in order, \nbeginning with the two reports and proceeding to the O & M manual, integrity-management \nplan, and as-built drawings. \nAs to the two remaining reports, Plaintiffs have not made the required showing.  As \nbefore, they emphasize the relevance of these documents to the Corps’ action.  But that is not the \nproper inquiry.  See Pac. Shores, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 6 (“Pacific Shores cannot meet its burden \nsimply by asserting that the documents are relevant[.]”); Stand Up for Cal.! v. U.S. Dep’t of \n1 0 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 418   Filed 05/08/19   Page 11 of 13\nInterior, 315 F. Supp. 3d 289, 295 (D.D.C. 2018) (“Plaintiffs’ mere assertion that these \ndocuments ‘are obviously important to the decision’ do not warrant supplementing the record.”).  \nThe Tribes must identify reasonable, non-speculative grounds to support their contention that the \nCorps considered them in formulating the remand decision but did not include them in the \nrecord.  The fact that Dakota Access is required to submit them to the agency is not enough.  See \nPac. Shores, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 5 (“[I]nterpreting the word ‘before’ so broadly as to encompass \nany potentially relevant document existing within the agency or in the hands of a third party \nwould render judicial review meaningless.” (citation omitted)).  That Plaintiffs have not been \nable to make the required showing is perhaps not surprising.  It is not obvious that the agency \nwould consider any of that material during the course of the remand, given that those three \nreports relate to the pipeline’s ongoing operation but not necessarily on the precise set of issues \nthe Corps had to resolve. \nThe Court moves next to the O & M manual and the integrity-management plan.  Both of \nthose documents do, in fact, appear in the record.  See RAR 4507, 4827, 4830.  Plaintiffs protest \nthat the included O & M manual and integrity-management plan are generic documents, rather \nthan being specific to the pipeline, as required by the terms of the easement.  See Pl. Reply at 9–\n10 (citing RAR 4499–4500, 4741–42).  The Corps insists that they are appropriately specific in \nthat they are plainly applicable to this pipeline.  See Def. Opp. at 13–14.  This dispute only \ndemonstrates, however, that the Tribes are really taking issue with Dakota Access’s compliance \nwith the easement conditions, not with whether the agency considered some additional set of \ndocuments on remand.  Indeed, Plaintiffs suggest as much themselves.  See Pl. Mot. at 13 \n(“Either [Dakota Access] is out of compliance with . . . easement conditions, or the Corps has \nfailed to provide materials that have been provided to it that are salient to its decision on \n1 1 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 418   Filed 05/08/19   Page 12 of 13\nremand.”).  Dakota Access’s compliance with easement conditions during the pendency of the \nCorps’ remand analysis is separate from the question of whether the Corps considered documents \nit did not include in the record. \n  Last at issue are the as-built drawings.  These present a different issue from the previous \nsets of documents because they are in the record but are redacted.  See RAR 4894–4901.  The \nrecord index indicates that they are redacted because they contain critical infrastructure data, \nalthough the Corps now avers that this is incorrect and that they are instead “properly redacted in \naccordance with PHMSA guidance.”  See Hudson Decl., ¶ 5.  Plaintiffs protest that this \nexplanation is “inscrutable” because the “Corps does not cite to any guidance, or any statute or \nregulation, which allows this material to be redacted.”  Pl. Reply at 10.  As a result, Plaintiffs \nbelieve, this “information is protected by the existing protective order,” and “the Corps should be \nrequired to complete the record with an unredacted version of this document.”  Id. \n  Without the precise provision the Corps is invoking to support the redaction, the Court \ncannot resolve this dispute.  Some categories of information can properly be excluded from the \nrecord based entirely on their sensitive status.  See, e.g., Amfac Resorts, 143 F. Supp. at 13  \n(information subject to deliberative-process privilege); Serono Labs., Inc. v. Shalala, 35 F. Supp. \n2d 1, 3–4 (D.D.C. 1999) (trade secrets).  Information redacted pursuant to agency guidance, \nhowever, is not in one of those entirely excludable categories.  Whether it can remain redacted, \ntherefore, is a harder question that courts in this circuit have not clearly resolved.  What is clear, \nhowever, is that at least some information redacted pursuant to a specific statutory scheme may \nproperly remain withheld, even where subject to a protective order.  See Pub. Emps. for Envtl. \nResponsibility v. Beadreau, 2012 WL 12942599, at *8 (D.D.C. Nov. 9, 2012) (affirming as \n“proper” withholding of six photographs “in accordance with the National Historic Preservation \n1 2 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 418   Filed 05/08/19   Page 13 of 13\nAct” notwithstanding that protective order was in effect).  The Court will thus require the Corps \nto submit, within two weeks, an affidavit detailing its legal rationale for the redaction of the as-\nbuilt drawings and the reasons, if any, that the information could not be revealed to Plaintiffs \nsubject to the protective order. \nIV.  Conclusion \nFor these reasons, the Court will grant in part and deny in part Plaintiffs’ Motion to \nComplete the Administrative Record.  A separate Order so stating will issue this day. \n/s/ James E. Boasberg \nJAMES E. BOASBERG \nUnited States District Judge \nDate:  May 8, 2019 \n1 3 ",

      "text": "Case 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 546   Filed 07/06/20   Page 1 of 24\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \n  FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n \n     \nSTANDING ROCK SIOUX TRIBE, et al., \n \n  Plaintiffs, \n \n            and \n \nCHEYENNE RIVER SIOUX TRIBE, et al., \n \n  Plaintiff-Intervenors, \n  v.  Civil Action No. 16-1534 (JEB)  \nU.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS,    \n   \nDefendant, \n \n            and \n \nDAKOTA ACCESS, LLC, \n \n  Defendant-Intervenor. \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \n \nLake Oahe is a large reservoir lying behind a dam on the Missouri River and stretching \nbetween North and South Dakota.  Fearing severe environmental consequences, American Indian \nTribes on nearby reservations have sought for several years to invalidate federal permits \nallowing the Dakota Access Pipeline to carry oil under the lake.  Today they finally achieve that \ngoal — at least for the time being. \nFollowing multiple twists and turns in this long-running litigation, this Court recently \nfound that Defendant U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had violated the National Environmental \nPolicy Act when it granted an easement to Defendant-Intervenor Dakota Access, LLC to \nconstruct and operate a segment of that crude-oil pipeline running beneath the lake.  This was \n  1 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 546   Filed 07/06/20   Page 2 of 24\nbecause the Corps had failed to produce an Environmental Impact Statement despite conditions \nthat triggered such a requirement.  The Court consequently remanded the case to the agency to \nprepare such an EIS, but it asked for separate briefing on the appropriate interim remedy.  In \nother words, the Court asked the parties whether the easement should be vacated and the pipeline \nemptied during the remand process.  Although mindful of the disruption such a shutdown will \ncause, the Court now concludes that the answer is yes.  Clear precedent favoring vacatur during \nsuch a remand coupled with the seriousness of the Corps’ deficiencies outweighs the negative \neffects of halting the oil flow for the thirteen months that the Corps believes the creation of an \nEIS will take. \nI.   Background  \nThe Court recounts here only the background information necessary to set the stage for \nthe remedy analysis.  For the full history of this case, the interested reader can refer to the \nCourt’s ten prior Opinions in this matter.  See, e.g., Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army \nCorps. of Eng’rs (Standing Rock III), 255 F. Supp. 3d 101, 114–16 (D.D.C. 2017); see also ECF \nNos. 39, 158, 206, 239, 284, 304, 392, 418, 496.  The Court begins with the relevant statute and \nthen describes the procedural history of the litigation. \nA.  Statutory Scheme \nThe National Environmental Policy Act requires agencies to “consider every significant \naspect of the environmental impact of a proposed action,” Balt. Gas & Elec. Co. v. NRDC, 462 \nU.S. 87, 97 (1983) (quoting Vt. Yankee Nuclear Power Corp v. NRDC, 435 U.S. 519, 553 \n(1978)), so as to “inform the public that it has indeed considered environmental concerns in its \ndecisionmaking process.”  Id. (citing Weinberger v. Catholic Action of Haw., 454 U.S. 139, 143 \n(1981)).  In order to achieve these goals, NEPA imposes on agencies certain procedural \n  2 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 546   Filed 07/06/20   Page 3 of 24\nrequirements, Citizens Against Burlington, Inc. v. Busey, 938 F.2d 190, 193–94 (D.C. Cir. \n1991), but it “does not mandate particular consequences.”  Id. at 194.   \nFirst, an agency must draft an Environmental Assessment, see 40 C.F.R. § 1501.4(b), that \n“[b]riefly provide[s] sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an \nenvironmental impact statement [EIS] or a finding of no significant impact [FONSI].”  Id. § \n1508.9(a).  “If any ‘significant’ environmental impacts might result from the proposed agency \naction[,] then an EIS must be prepared before agency action is taken.”  Grand Canyon Trust v. \nFAA, 290 F.3d 339, 340 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (quoting Sierra Club v. Peterson, 717 F.2d 1409, 1415 \n(D.C. Cir. 1983)); see also 42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C) (requiring statement of environmental impact \nof any proposed action “significantly affecting the quality of the human environment”).  If, on \nthe other hand, the agency determines that no EIS is required, it must prepare either a FONSI or \na Mitigated FONSI, depending on whether the lack of significant impact results from an \nagency’s commitment to mitigation measures.  See 40 C.F.R. §§ 1501.4(e), 1508.13; Council on \nEnvironmental Quality, Appropriate Use of Mitigation and Monitoring and Clarifying the \nAppropriate Use of Mitigated Findings of No Significant Impact 2, 7 (2011), https://ceq.doe.gov/ \ndocs/ceq-regulations-and-guidance/Mitigation_and_Monitoring_Guidance_14Jan2011.pdf. \nIn order to determine whether its actions may result in “significant” environmental \nimpacts — and therefore whether it must prepare an EIS — an agency must examine both the \n“context” and the “intensity” of the action.  See 40 C.F.R. § 1508.27.  [I]n evaluating intensity,” \nthe agency must consider ten factors, id. § 1508.27(b), only one of which is relevant here. \n“Implicating any one of the[se] factors may be sufficient to require development of an EIS.”  \nNat’l Parks Conservation Ass’n v. Semonite, 916 F.3d 1075, 1082 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (citing Grand \nCanyon Trust, 290 F.3d at 347).  The decision here turned on the fourth of these factors — “[t]he \n  3 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 546   Filed 07/06/20   Page 4 of 24\ndegree to which the effects on the quality of the human environment are likely to be highly \ncontroversial.”  40 C.F.R. § 1508.27(b)(4). \nEffects are “controversial” where “substantial dispute exists as to the size, nature, or \neffect of the major federal action rather than to the existence of opposition to a use.”  Town of \nCave Creek v. FAA, 325 F.3d 320, 331 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (emphasis omitted) (quoting Found. for \nN. Am. Wild Sheep v. USDA, 681 F.2d 1172, 1182 (9th Cir. 1982)).   While “what constitutes \nthe type of ‘controversy’ that requires a full EIS is not entirely clear,” Nat’l Parks Conservation \nAss’n v. United States, 177 F. Supp. 3d 1, 33 (D.D.C. 2016) (quoting Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n v. \nNorton, 332 F. Supp. 2d 170, 184 (D.D.C. 2004)), “something more is required besides the fact \nthat some people may be highly agitated and be willing to go to court over the matter.”  Id. \n(quoting Fund for Animals v. Frizzell, 530 F.2d 982, 988 n.15 (D.C. Cir. 1975)). \nB.  Procedural History \nThis case involves efforts by several American Indian Tribes to enjoin Defendant United \nStates Army Corps of Engineers from permitting Defendant-Intervenor Dakota Access, LLC to \nconstructe and operate a segment of its oil pipeline under Lake Oahe, which lies on the Missouri \nRiver.  In 2016, Plaintiff Standing Rock Sioux Tribe filed its Complaint in this Court, followed \nshortly by Plaintiff-Intervenor Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and later by Plaintiffs Oglala and \nYankton Sioux Tribes, the latter two in cases that have now been consolidated into the present \none.  Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs (Standing Rock VI), No. 16-\n1534, 2020 WL 1441923, at *3 (D.D.C. Mar. 25, 2020).  Early on, both Standing Rock and \nCheyenne River were unsuccessful in seeking preliminary injunctions under the National \nHistoric Preservation Act and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.  Standing Rock Sioux \nTribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs (Standing Rock II), 239 F. Supp. 3d 77, 100 (D.D.C. 2017); \n  4 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 546   Filed 07/06/20   Page 5 of 24\nStanding Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs (Standing Rock I), 205 F. Supp. 3d 4, \n37 (D.D.C. 2016).  In between these two Opinions, the Corps “announced that DAPL \nconstruction would be suspended pending the Corps’ reconsideration of its statutory obligations” \nunder NEPA.  Standing Rock VI, 2020 WL 1441923, at *3.  A few months later, however, \nfollowing the change of administration in January 2017 and a presidential memorandum urging \nacceleration of the project, the Corps again reconsidered and decided to move forward.  Id.  It \ngranted the sought permit, construction was completed, and oil commenced flowing through the \nDakota Access Pipeline.  Standing Rock III, 255 F. Supp. 3d at 120. \nUndeterred, later in 2017, Standing Rock and Cheyenne River switched focus and \n“sought summary judgment under [the National Environmental Policy Act], arguing that the \nCorps was required to prepare an [Environmental Impact Statement], and Defendants similarly \ncross-moved.”  Standing Rock VI, 2020 WL 1441923, at *4.  The Court found that the Corps’ \ndecision “not to issue an EIS largely complied with NEPA,” but three “substantial exceptions” to \nthat compliance necessitated a remand.  Standing Rock III, 255 F. Supp. 3d at 147.  Specifically, \nthe Court “found wanting the Corps’ analysis of: (1) whether the project's effects were likely to \nbe highly controversial; (2) the impact of an oil spill on the Tribe’s fishing and hunting rights \nunder the Treaty of 1851; and (3) ‘whether,’ under a required environmental-justice analysis, \n‘Standing Rock would be disproportionately harmed by a spill.’”  Standing Rock VI, 2020 WL \n1441923, at *5 (citations omitted) (quoting Standing Rock III, 255 F. Supp. 3d at 140).  This \nraised the significant question of whether the permit should be vacated — and the oil flow \narrested — during the remand.  In a subsequent Opinion, the Court declined to so order, finding \nthat there was a “‘serious possibility’ that the Corps w[ould] be able to substantiate its prior \n  5 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 546   Filed 07/06/20   Page 6 of 24\nconclusions.”  Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs (Standing Rock IV), \n282 F. Supp. 3d 91, 109 (D.D.C. 2017). \nDuring the remand, which stretched on for well over a year, the D.C. Circuit “issued a \nsignificant opinion clarifying a court’s role in reviewing an agency’s finding that a project was \nnot ‘highly controversial.’”  Standing Rock VI, 2020 WL 1441923, at *7.  In Semonite, that \ncourt held that it was not sufficient for an agency to simply “acknowledge and try to address \nconcerns raised during the NEPA process.”  916 F.3d at 1085 (emphasis added).  “The question \nis not whether the Corps attempted to resolve the controversy, but whether it succeeded.”  Id. at \n1085–86.  Because the Corps in that case had failed to resolve the scientific controversy raised \nby expert and agency comments, the Semonite court found that it had been wrong to choose not \nto prepare an EIS and remanded for such action.  Id. at 1087–88. \nAfter the remand in this case was completed, the parties again cross-moved for summary \njudgment.  Realizing that Semonite guided both “the nature and scope of [this Court’s] review,”  \nStanding Rock VI, 2020 WL 1441923, at *8; see id. at *6–8 (detailing reasons for following \nSemonite), the Court conducted a detailed analysis of some of the many expert critiques of the \nenvironmental effects of the proposed project.  Id. at *8–16 (discussing leak-detection system, \noperator safety record, winter conditions, and worst-case discharge).  Ultimately, “even this non-\nextensive selection suffice[d] to show the necessity of an EIS.”  Id. at *9.  The Court found that \n“the Corps ha[d] not ‘succeeded’ in ‘resolv[ing] the controversy’ created by ‘consistent and \nstrenuous opposition, often in the form of concrete objections to the Corps’ analytical process \nand findings,’ by ‘organizations with subject-matter expertise.’”  Id. at *16 (second alteration in \noriginal) (quoting Semonite, 916 F.3d at 1086).  As in Semonite, “[t]his demonstrate[d] the \n‘something more’ needed to show that the ‘effects on the quality of the human environment are \n  6 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 546   Filed 07/06/20   Page 7 of 24\nlikely to be highly controversial.’”  Id. (first alteration in original) (quoting Semonite, 916 F.3d \nat 1086).  “The Corps ha[d] thus violated NEPA by determining that an EIS was unnecessary \neven though one of the EIS-triggering factors was met.”  Id. \nWhile there were two remaining NEPA topics — other than the “highly controversial” \nfactor — that had formed the basis for the Court’s first remand, it found no need to reach them, \nsince the remedy for any finding in the Tribes’ favor would be the same — viz., an EIS — and \nsuch EIS would require consideration of them in any case.  Id.  After disposing of a handful of \nother, non-NEPA issues, id. at *16–19, the Court again “remand[ed] to the agency for it to \ncomplete such EIS.”  Id. at *16 (citing Semonite, 916 F.3d at 1082; then citing Grand Canyon \nTrust, 290 F.3d at 340).  It asked for separate briefing, however, on “the status of the \neasement — and, ultimately, the oil — in the meantime.”  Id. at *19.  Unsurprisingly, the Tribes \nhave argued for vacatur of the permits, Defendants have opposed, and each side is joined by an \narmy of amici.  See ECF Nos. 504, 514–19, 521, 532–33, 537.  With the benefit of this bountiful \nbriefing, the Court is now prepared to rule as to vacatur. \nII.   Legal Standard \n“The ordinary practice is to vacate unlawful agency action.”  United Steel v. Mine Safety \n& Health Admin., 925 F.3d 1279, 1287 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (citing 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)); accord FCC \nv. NextWave Personal Comms. Inc., 537 U.S. 293, 300 (2003) (“In all cases agency action must \nbe set aside if the action . . . failed to meet statutory, procedural, or constitutional requirements.”) \n(quoting Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 413–14 (1971)).  \nVacatur is also the “standard remedy” in this Circuit for an “action promulgated in violation of \nNEPA.”  Humane Soc’y of U.S. v. Johanns, 520 F. Supp. 2d 8, 37 (D.D.C. 2007) (citing Am. \nBioscience, Inc. v. Thompson, 269 F.3d 1077, 1084 (D.C. Cir. 2001)); see Reed v. Salazar, 744 \n  7 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 546   Filed 07/06/20   Page 8 of 24\nF. Supp. 2d 98, 118–20 (D.D.C. 2010) (finding NEPA violation and ordering vacatur); Sierra \nClub v. Van Antwerp, 719 F. Supp. 2d 77, 78–80 (D.D.C. 2010) (finding NEPA violation and \nordering remand with partial vacatur); Greater Yellowstone Coal. v. Kempthorne, 577 F. Supp. \n2d 183, 204–05, 210 (D.D.C. 2008) (finding NEPA violation and ordering vacatur); see also Pub. \nEmps. for Envtl. Responsibility v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Serv., 189 F. Supp. 3d 1, 2 (D.D.C. \n2016) (surveying “cases in this district” and noting “the primacy of vacatur to remedy NEPA \nviolations”).   \nAlthough vacatur may be the “presumptively appropriate remedy,” Sierra Club, 719 F. \nSupp. 2d at 78, it is not the only option.  Instead, as equity requires, the reviewing court has \ndiscretion to leave the agency action in place.  See, e.g., Advocates for Highway & Auto Safety \nv. Fed. Motor Carrier Safety Admin., 429 F.3d 1136, 1151 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (declining to vacate \nvehicle-safety rule found arbitrary and capricious under APA); Int’l Union, United Mine \nWorkers of Am. v. Fed. Mine Safety & Health Admin., 920 F.2d 960, 966–67 (D.C. Cir. 1990) \n(same for mine-safety rule).  Indeed, that is precisely what this Court did last time around.  See \nStanding Rock IV, 282 F. Supp. 3d at 109. \nIn Allied-Signal v. United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 988 F.2d 146 (D.C. \nCir. 1993), the court laid out the operative test for whether to vacate a deficient agency action \nduring remand.  First, a court must consider “the seriousness of the order’s deficiencies (and thus \nthe extent of doubt whether the agency chose correctly).”  Id. at 150 (quoting Int’l Union, 920 \nF.2d at 967).  Second, it analyzes “the disruptive consequences of an interim change that may \nitself be changed.”  Id. at 150–51 (quoting Int’l Union, 920 F.2d at 967).  “Because vacatur is the \ndefault remedy, . . . defendants bear the burden to prove that vacatur is unnecessary.”  Nat’l \nParks Conservation Ass’n v. Semonite, 422 F. Supp. 3d 92, 99 (D.D.C. 2019). \n  8 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 546   Filed 07/06/20   Page 9 of 24\nIII.   Analysis \nThe Court analyzes each prong of the Allied-Signal test separately, keeping in mind that \n“[t]here is no rule requiring either the proponent or opponent of vacatur to prevail on both \nfactors.”  Shands Jacksonville Med. Ctr. v. Burwell, 139 F. Supp. 3d 240, 270 (D.D.C. 2015).  It \nultimately concludes that shutting down the pipeline is warranted. \nA.  Seriousness of Deficiencies \nUnlike the Court’s last Opinion on remedy in this case, the first Allied-Signal prong is \nquite straightforward here.  The Court’s task in considering this first factor is to determine \nwhether there is “a significant possibility that the [agency] may find an adequate explanation for \nits actions” on remand.  Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Co. v. FERC, 519 F.3d 497, 504 \n(D.C. Cir. 2008) (citing Allied-Signal, 988 F.2d at 150–51); accord Nat’l Parks Conservation \nAss’n v. Jewell, 62 F. Supp. 3d 7, 20 (D.D.C. 2014) (“[R]emand without vacatur is appropriate \nwhere ‘there is at least a serious possibility that the [agency] will be able to substantiate its \ndecision on remand.’”) (second alteration in original) (quoting Allied-Signal, 988 F.2d at 151).  \nIn its prior remedy Opinion, this Court went through the three topics to be covered on remand in \nsignificant detail, see Standing Rock IV, 282 F. Supp. 3d at 97–103, finding in each case that the \nCorps was likely to be able to “substantiate its prior decision to issue an EA.”  Id. at 100 (fishing \nand hunting rights); see also id. at 99 (highly controversial); id. at 102 (environmental justice). \nNow, however, that decision has been weighed, it has been measured, and it has been \nfound wanting.  The Court’s March 2020 Opinion examined the first of the three remand \ntopics — namely, whether the effects were highly controversial — and found definitively that, \nnotwithstanding the Court’s earlier optimism, the Corps had not been able to substantiate its \ndecision to publish only an EA and not an EIS: \n  9 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 546   Filed 07/06/20   Page 10 of 24\nAs shown at great length in the preceding analysis, the Corps has \nnot  “succeeded”  in  “resolv[ing]  the  controversy”  created  by \n“consistent and strenuous opposition, often in the form of concrete \nobjections  to  the  Corps’  analytical  process  and  findings,”  by \n“organizations with subject-matter expertise.”  As in Semonite, \n“[t]his demonstrates the ‘something more’ needed to show that the \n‘effects on the quality of the human environment are likely to be \nhighly controversial.’”  The Corps has thus violated NEPA by \ndetermining that an EIS was unnecessary even though one of the \nEIS-triggering factors was met. \n \nStanding Rock VI, 2020 WL 1441923, at *16 (alterations in original) (citations omitted) (quoting \nSemonite, 916 F.3d at 1086).  There is no longer any question of the Corps being able to justify \nits choice. \nIn such a circumstance, Circuit precedent overwhelmingly dictates that vacatur is \nappropriate.  That court routinely vacates agency action when remanding for preparation of an \nEIS, and often without discussion.  See, e.g., Sierra Club v. FERC, 867 F.3d 1357, 1379 (D.C. \nCir. 2017) (vacating agency approval of interstate natural-gas pipelines); Am. Wild Horse \nPreservation Campaign v. Perdue, 873 F.3d 914, 932 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (vacating Forest Service \ndecision to eliminate 23,000 acres of wild horse territory); see also Sierra Club v. U.S. Army \nCorps of Eng’rs, 803 F.3d 31, 43 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (“If the NEPA analysis were legally \ninadequate, ‘we could order that the [pipeline] be closed or impose restrictions on its use,’ at \nleast on federally authorized segments, ‘until [the agencies] complied with NEPA.’”) (alterations \nin original) (quoting Airport Neighbors All., Inc. v. United States, 90 F.3d 426, 429 (10th Cir. \n1996)).  When vacatur is discussed, the seriousness of a failure to produce an EIS under NEPA is \nemphasized.  See, e.g., Oglala Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Comm’n, 896 F.3d 520, \n536 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (“The seriousness of the NEPA deficiency is particularly clear here because \nthe point of NEPA is to require an adequate EIS before a project goes forward . . . .”).   \n  10 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 546   Filed 07/06/20   Page 11 of 24\nIn fact, to the Court’s and the parties’ knowledge, only twice has a court (once the \nCircuit, once the district court here) not vacated agency action that violated NEPA because of a \nmissing or defective EIS.  Defendants attempt to hang their hat on these cases, but to no avail.  In \nboth, the second prong of the Allied-Signal test, but not the first, weighed in favor of remand \nwithout vacatur, leading those courts to find that the scales tipped toward the agency.  See id.; \nSemonite, 422 F. Supp. 3d at 99–100 (“[T]he seriousness of the defect is significant.  If the first \nAllied-Signal factor were the only consideration, the standard remedy [of vacatur] would likely \napply.”); id. at 103 (“For all of these reasons, the second Allied-Signal factor forces the Court to \nconclude that vacating the permit would be inappropriate.”).  That second factor will be analyzed \npresently, see infra Section III.B, and the Court will revisit these two cases at that time.  As to \nthis first prong, however, both decisions strongly support the Court’s conclusion here. \n  Defendants and Defendant-Intervenor next argue that, instead of focusing on the Corps’ \ndecision not to prepare an EIS, the Court should be analyzing whether “the Corps will likely \nsubstantiate its substantive easement decision.”  ECF No. 507 (Corps Remedy Brief) at 7 \n(emphasis added); see ECF No. 509-1 (DA Remedy Brief) at 14 (“The Corps’ key premises for \ngranting the easement . . . remain intact, and they strongly suggest that the Corps will be able to \nreach the same top-line conclusion on remand.”).  They maintain that focusing on the EIS \ndecision “would render the first part of th[e Allied-Signal] test surplusage,” since it suggests that \nany agency action that is invalid for failure to produce an EIS will always flunk this first prong \nof the vacatur test.  See ECF No. 536 (Corps Remedy Reply) at 5; see ECF No. 541 (DA \nRemedy Reply) at 9 (arguing that focusing on the EIS “alter[s] that prong such that it could \nnever apply in NEPA cases like this”).  Instead, they would have the Court evaluate their ability \nin an EIS to remedy the specific areas of concern stated in its prior Opinion.  They thus spill \n  11 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 546   Filed 07/06/20   Page 12 of 24\nconsiderable ink rehashing the merits of the Court’s prior Opinions.  See, e.g., DA Remedy Br. at \n19–31 (arguing in great detail why Corps will be able to “easily address the four discrete issues \nthat this Court found ‘highly controversial,’” id. at 19); Corps Remedy Br. at 10–14 (arguing that \npipeline’s Mineral Leasing Act easement is valid for the reasons argued in first round of \nsummary judgment). \nTo the extent that Defendants complain that the “seriousness” of an agency’s failure to \nproduce an EIS under NEPA is a foregone conclusion, they are taking issue with the caselaw in \nthis Circuit, as just explained.  See also Dep’t of Transp. v. Pub. Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 757 \n(2004) (describing EIS as being “[a]t the heart of NEPA”).  But the magnitude of those \nshortcomings is even clearer here, where the Court had the benefit of a second round of \nsummary-judgment briefing to determine that the defects in the EA were, in fact, too serious to \nbe ignored.  See generally Standing Rock VI, 2020 WL 1441923.  The Court determined in \nMarch of this year that these infirmities were so significant as to merit the preparation of an \nEnvironmental Impact Statement, id. at *16, and, as just explained, an EIS failure under NEPA is \nconsidered a very serious deficiency in this Circuit.  The Court’s focus on the EIS, rather than on \nthe entire easement decision, is in fact supported by one of the aforementioned two cases on \nwhich Defendants rely.  See Semonite, 422 F. Supp. 3d at 99 (“Looking at the first Allied-Signal \nfactor, the Court does not assess the deficiency of the ultimate decision itself — the choice to \nissue the permit — but rather the deficiency of the determination that an EIS was not \nwarranted.”) (emphasis added). \nDefendants’ argument, moreover, betrays what appears to be a misunderstanding of their \nobligations going forward.  The time for justifying the Environmental Assessment has passed — \nthe Court has ordered an Environmental Impact Statement, and another limited remand analysis \n  12 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 546   Filed 07/06/20   Page 13 of 24\nwill not fit the bill.  Contra DA Remedy Br. at 14 (arguing that task on remand is to address only \n“four areas of criticism pertaining to one remand topic”).  Indeed, the Court explicitly did not \nreach the other two remand topics because “the remedy for them would be the same,” and “‘[i]n \npreparing its EIS, the Corps [would] have to revisit’ those issues in any case.”  Standing Rock \nVI, 2020 WL 1441923, at *16 (alterations in original) (quoting Semonite, 916 F.3d at 1088).  \nContra Corps Remedy Br. at 10 (“[T]he Court found no fault with the Corps’ consideration of \nenvironmental justice or of the impacts to the Tribes’ treaty hunting and fishing rights . . . .”).   \nAn EIS, it is important to remember, is a separate regulatory beast, with its own \nrequirements.  See, e.g, Taxpayers of Mich. Against Casinos v. Norton, 433 F.3d 852, 857 (D.C. \nCir. 2006) (describing EIS as “detailed” and “comprehensive”).  The fact that the Corps has \nsubmitted a detailed EA does not minimize its obligations when preparing that EIS.  See \nAnderson v. Evans, 371 F.3d 475, 494 (9th Cir. 2004) (“No matter how thorough, an EA can \nnever substitute for preparation of an EIS, if the proposed action could significantly affect the \nenvironment.”).  Compare 40 C.F.R. § 1501.4 (laying out considerations for “whether to prepare \nan environmental impact statement”), with 40 C.F.R. §§ 1502.1–1502.24 (laying out \nrequirements for environmental impact statement).  Contra DA Remedy Br. at 10 (arguing that \nCorps can “continue to rely largely, if not exclusively, on its prior analysis”).  The Corps must \nperform a full and complete EIS for the entire project, potentially subject to the full scope of \njudicial review normally applied to environmental impact statements.  See, e.g., 40 C.F.R. \n§ 1502.14 (comparison of environmental impacts of alternatives to proposed agency project “is \nthe heart of the environmental impact statement”); Sierra Club, 867 F.3d at 1371–72 (discussing \nagency’s duty in preparing EIS to consider indirect environmental effects of pipeline operations). \n  13 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 546   Filed 07/06/20   Page 14 of 24\nIn sum, the first Allied-Signal factor weighs entirely in favor of vacatur.  The Court has \nhad ample opportunity to consider the serious deficiencies in the Corps’ decision not to prepare \nan EIS, see Standing Rock VI, 2020 WL 1441923, at *8–16, and it finds no “possibility that the \n[agency] may find an adequate explanation for its actions.”  Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline, \n519 F.3d at 504; see Allied-Signal, 988 F.2d at 151. \nB.  Disruptive Consequences \nThe second Allied-Signal factor is less straightforward here than the first.  At issue are \n“the disruptive consequences of vacating,” 988 F.2d at 151, particularly those that threaten to \n“‘set back’ the Act’s objective[s].”  Am. Bankers Ass’n v. Nat’l Credit Union Admin., 934 F.3d \n649, 674 (D.C. Cir. 2019); accord Envtl. Def. Fund, Inc. v. EPA, 898 F.2d 183, 190 (D.C. Cir. \n1990) (remanding without vacatur when no party requested to vacate and doing so would defeat \n“the enhanced protection of the environmental values covered by the [Clean Air Act]”).  Courts \nmay choose “not [to] vacate regulations when doing so would risk significant harm to the public \nhealth or the environment.”  Wisconsin v. EPA, 938 F.3d 303, 336 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (citing \nAllied-Signal, 988 F.2d at 150–51). \n1.  Economic Disruption \n  Dakota Access’s central and strongest argument as to the second Allied-Signal prong is \nthat shutting down the pipeline would cause it, and the industries that rely on it, significant \neconomic harm, including substantial job losses.  See, e.g., DA Remedy Br. at 32 (stating that \nshutdown would “pose an existential threat to DAPL” due to “massive” revenue loss).  It submits \ndeclarations stating that DAPL could lose as much as $643 million in the second half of 2020 \nand $1.4 billion in 2021 if shut down pursuant to the Court’s order.  See ECF No. 509-9 \n(Declaration of Glenn Emery), ¶ 10.  “All of these financial losses would be absorbed by the \n  14 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 546   Filed 07/06/20   Page 15 of 24\nowners of Dakota Access,” particularly Energy Transfer Partners, the current parent company of \nDAPL after a merger with Sunoco.  See DA Remedy Br. at 33; Standing Rock VI, 2020 WL \n1441923, at *10.   \nIn addition, both Dakota Access and many amici argue, shutting the pipeline down would \nhave serious repercussions for the entire North Dakota oil industry.  “There is no viable pipeline \nalternative for transporting the 570,000 barrels of Bakken crude that DAPL is capable of \ncarrying each day,” Dakota Access states, and railroads do not have the capacity “to fill the \nbreach.”  DA Remedy Br. at 35–36; see ECF No. 504 (Amicus Brief of State of North Dakota) at \n11 (“An increase in crude by rail volumes sufficient to offset current pipeline deliveries by \nDAPL would take an unknown amount of time to assemble the required tank cars, engines, and \ncrews, and to ensure market destinations would be prepared for a surge in rail volume.”).  \nSeveral states also argue that their grain farmers would be harmed by having to pay a premium \nfor railroad cars once oil, which is more valuable by volume, enters that market and drives up \nprices.  See ECF No. 514 (Amicus Brief of IN, MT, AL, AR, IA, KS, KY, LA, NE, OH, SD, TX, \nUT, and WV) at 9–10.  “[M]any North Dakota oil producers,” meanwhile, with no way to get \ntheir oil to market, “would have no choice but to respond by ‘shutting in’ some of their wells and \nceasing production entirely,” with consequent effects on the workers at those wells.  See DA \nRemedy Brief at 35 (citing ECF No. 509-11 (Declaration of Jeff D. Makholm), ¶ 17; then citing \nEmery Decl., ¶¶ 14, 18).  Specifically, Dakota Access estimates, “producers would have to shut-\nin between 3,460 and 5,400 wells, stranding up to 34.5% of North Dakota crude production.”  Id. \nat 36; see also, e.g., North Dakota Br. at 8 (estimating that “[e]ach of those wells represents 1.6 \nfull time jobs”) (citing ECF No. 504-2 (Declaration of Lynn Helms), ¶ 10).  This would also \nhave a reverberating effect on the state of North Dakota, whose economy derives a large part of \n  15 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 546   Filed 07/06/20   Page 16 of 24\nits revenue from oil and gas taxes, largely from the Williston Basin, which includes the Bakken \nfields that supply DAPL.  See North Dakota Br. at 2–3; DA Remedy Br. at 4; see also North \nDakota Br. at 2 (explaining that “despite the small overall size of North Dakota’s economy, [it] is \na large producer of oil and natural gas”).   \nThe Tribes and other amici respond that these projected consequences are “wildly \nexaggerated” because, following “a precipitous collapse in oil prices, demand, and production” \ncaused in part by the COVID-19 pandemic, “production in North Dakota has [already] \nplummeted.”  ECF No. 527 (Tribes Remedy Brief) at 21–22; see also ECF No. 531 (Amicus \nBrief of Members of Congress) at 9 (“Since [the Court’s last remedy Opinion in this case in] \n2017, the price and demand for oil has plummeted due to factors well beyond the operation of \nthis pipeline.”); ECF No. 519 (Amicus Brief of North Dakota Petroleum Council) at 8 (“In recent \nweeks, of course, the coronavirus pandemic has turned the nation’s economy and the oil industry \nupside down.”).  They point out that North Dakota estimates that “as many as 5,000 wells may \nnow be shut-in” because of “the current economic situation,” North Dakota Br. at 3 n.4, noting \nthat this is more than the number of wells Dakota Access claimed would be affected by a DAPL \nshutdown.  See Tribes Remedy Br. at 22–23; see also id. at 23 (citing news articles reporting that \nNorth Dakota well shut-ins have now increased to 7,000).  Other briefs allude to the pandemic, \nadmitting some effect on the oil market but maintaining more optimism than realism.  See, e.g., \nN.D. Petroleum Council Br. at 8 (“In recent weeks, of course, the coronavirus pandemic has \nturned the nation’s economy and the oil industry upside down.  Nevertheless, NDPC continues to \nhope and expect that our country’s economy and the industry will recover in coming months.”); \nNorth Dakota Br. at 12 (“[T]he potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are impossible to \nquantify due to rapidly changing oil prices, employment numbers, and capital investment \n  16 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 546   Filed 07/06/20   Page 17 of 24\nplans . . . .”).  The Tribes further claim that this drop in production may mean that there will be \n“little or no increase in rail transportation.”  Tribes Remedy Br. at 25 (citing ECF No. 527-2 \n(Declaration of Marie Fagan), ¶ 5).  And to the extent that a DAPL shutdown causes crude-oil \ndemand to drop even further or its transportation to switch to railroads, the Tribes argue that with \n“some participants in the North Dakota oil market [facing] increased costs,” “other participants,” \nsuch as railroads and other oil-producing states, would “benefit from the shift.”  Tribes Remedy \nBr. at 26 (citing ECF No. 272-2 (Third Declaration of Richard Krupewicz), ¶ 30; then citing \nFagan Decl., ¶ 7).  Defendant-Intervenors, for their part, dismiss the Tribes’ take on the \npandemic, calling their analysis of the continuing effects of a pandemic-depressed oil market \n“bearish” and “erroneous[].”  DAPL Remedy Rep. at 17–18. \nThe Court need not pick apart the various positions in these disputes, for it is clear that at \nleast some immediate harm to the North Dakota oil industry should be expected from a DAPL \nshutdown, even if its effects are tempered by a decreased demand for oil.  See DA Remedy Rep. \nat 18 (averring that “demand for [the pipeline]’s services has remained strong”).  Indeed, the \nCourt does not take lightly the serious effects that a DAPL shutdown could have for many states, \ncompanies, and workers.  Losing jobs and revenue, particularly in a highly uncertain economic \nenvironment, is no small burden.  Ultimately, however, these effects do not tip the scales \ndecisively in favor of remanding without vacatur.  This is so for several reasons. \nFirst, “the Corps anticipates the [EIS] process” for DAPL “will take approximately \nthirteen months,” Corps Remedy Br. at 5, whereas in general “the mean time from initiation to \ncompletion of an EIS is 3.6 years” across all federal agencies, and the Corps’ own average time \nis even longer.  See Tribes Remedy Br. at 16 n.4 (citing Council on Envtl. Quality, \nEnvironmental Impact Statement Timelines (2010–2017), at 1, 8, https://www.whitehouse.gov/ \n  17 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 546   Filed 07/06/20   Page 18 of 24\nwp-content/uploads/2017/11/CEQ-EIS-Timelines-Report.pdf).  This expedited process, if it \nproceeds on track, would cabin the economic disruption of a shutdown.  See Standing Rock IV, \n282 F. Supp. 3d at 108 (“[T]he Corps' assertions regarding the timing of the remand process are \nalso relevant to analyzing the disruption in this case.”).  Without vacatur, conversely, the Corps \nand Dakota Access would have little incentive to finish the EIS in a timely matter. \nSecond, while economic disruption is a proper consideration for the second Allied-Signal \nprong, it may not necessarily be “determinative.”  Standing Rock IV, 282 F. Supp. 3d at 104; see \nalso Am. Water Works Ass’n v. EPA, 40 F.3d 1266, 1273 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (considering \n“disrupti[on] to the [affected] industries” in vacatur analysis).  Courts more often cite “harm to \nthe public health or the environment,” Wisconsin, 938 F.3d at 336 (citing Allied-Signal, 988 \nF.2d at 150–51), and those that “‘set back’ the Act’s objective[s].”  Am. Bankers Ass’n, 934 F.3d \nat 674.  The Court will discuss environmental disruption shortly.  See infra Section III.B.2,. \nThird, accepting Dakota Access’s arguments wholesale would subvert the structure of \nNEPA, the “objective[s]” of which are an important touchstone when considering disruption.  \nAm. Bankers Ass’n, 934 F.3d at 674.  NEPA’s “requirement that a detailed environmental \nimpact statement be made for a ‘proposed’ action makes clear that agencies must take the \nrequired hard look before taking that action.”  Oglala Sioux Tribe, 896 F.3d at 532; see also \nRobertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 349 (1989) (“The statutory \nrequirement that a federal agency contemplating a major action prepare such an environmental \nimpact statement serves NEPA’s ‘action-forcing’ purpose  . . . .”) (citing Baltimore Gas & Elec. \nCo. v. NRDC, 462 U.S. 87, 97 (1983); then citing Weinberger v. Catholic Action of Haw., 454 \nU.S. 139, 143 (1981)).  When it comes to NEPA, it is better to ask for permission than \n  18 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 546   Filed 07/06/20   Page 19 of 24\nforgiveness: if you can build first and consider environmental consequences later, NEPA’s \naction-forcing purpose loses its bite.   \nDakota Access attempts the same workaround of this principle as was offered last time, \nand the Court again finds it unavailing.  In 2017, Defendants “argue[d] that vacatur here would \n‘have greater disruptive consequences than in the typical NEPA case’ because the pipeline has \nalready been completed.”  Standing Rock IV, 282 F. Supp. 3d at 107 (citing ECF No. 258 at 12); \nsee DA Remedy Br. at 33–34 (“[H]owever one might have quantified what the ‘economic \ndisruption’ risk was back then, the potential economic risk now is quantifiable and catastrophic.  \nAnd after almost three years of operations and several court rulings, it has been reasonable for \nDakota Access, the state of North Dakota, and all the other interested third parties to assume that \nthe ‘risk’ of a shutdown would decrease significantly over time.”)  The Court’s response to these \narguments is the same now as then: \n[D]enying vacatur on the basis of alleged economic harm risks \ncreating  undesirable  incentives  for  future  agency  actions.    If \nprojections of financial distress are sufficient to prevent vacatur, the \nCourt fears that agencies and third parties may choose to devote as \nmany resources as early as possible to a challenged project — and \nthen claim disruption in light of such investments. Such a strategy \nis contrary to the purpose of NEPA, which seeks to ensure that the \ngovernment “looks before it leaps.” \n \nStanding Rock IV, 282 F. Supp. 3d at 106 (quoting ECF No. 269-1). \n  Fourth and finally, such “economic myopia,” id. at 105, causes Dakota Access to \n“address the ‘potentially disruptive effects of vacatur as if they occur in a vacuum,’ thus giving \nshort shrift to the ‘potentially disruptive effects that could flow from remand without vacatur.’”  \nId. at 105 (quoting Friends of Capital Crescent Trail v. Fed. Transit Admin., 218 F. Supp. 3d 53, \n60 (D.D.C. 2016)).  As before, “there is no doubt that allowing oil to flow through the pipeline \nduring remand risks the potentially disruptive effect about which the Tribes are most \n  19 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 546   Filed 07/06/20   Page 20 of 24\nconcerned — a spill under Lake Oahe.”  Id.  Indeed, even while “[t]he likelihood of any such \nrupture may be low,” id., the impact of such a spill has been one of the Court’s central concerns \nthroughout the case.  See Standing Rock III, 255 F. Supp. 3d at 139 (“As to the effects from a \nspill (as distinct from the risk of a spill occurring), the EA’s discussion is minimal . . . .”); \nStanding Rock IV, 282 F. Supp. 3d at 105 (“[T]he possible effects of an oil spill on the Tribes’ \ntreaty rights and communities were at the center of this Court’s prior Opinion.”).  Indeed, while \nthe most recent Opinion in this case did not have cause to reach the topic of the impact of a spill \non tribal hunting and fishing rights, it did spend much time discussing the possibility that, in the \nunlikely event of a spill, systems may not be in place to prevent that spill from becoming \ndisastrous.  See, e.g., Standing Rock VI, 2020 WL 1441923, at *10 (discussing unaddressed \npossibility that DAPL’s leak-detection system was incapable of detecting leaks of less than 1% \nof its flow rate, meaning that “6,000 barrels per day” could leak without triggering an alarm); id. \nat *11 (noting that 30% of spills on pipelines operated by DAPL’s operator occurred outside of \noperator property); id. at *11–12 (recounting expert concerns that wintertime spill would be \ndifficult to contain and had not been sufficiently prepared for in EA).  Even assuming the risk of \na spill remains small, “pausing the operation of the pipeline would mitigate even this small risk.”  \nStanding Rock IV, 282 F. Supp. 3d at 105. \nOne final word here so that the Court may make good on its earlier promise to address \nthe two cases offered by Defendant-Intervenor as examples of courts’ declining to vacate when \nfaced with an EIS failure.  Recall that both cases based their decision not on the first Allied-\nSignal factor, which they found supported vacatur, but on the second.  See Oglala Sioux Tribe, \n896 F.3d at 538; Semonite, 422 F. Supp. 3d at 99–100, 103.  In Oglala Sioux Tribe, the D.C. \nCircuit held that this second factor disfavored vacatur simply because a “South Dakota \n  20 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 546   Filed 07/06/20   Page 21 of 24\npermitting requirement independently bar[red] it from moving forward with construction on the \nsite until the [agency] complete[d] its compliance with NEPA.”  896 F.3d at 538.  In Semonite, \nhowever, there was significant disruption anticipated from vacatur: the district court was \nconcerned by “the risk that hundreds of thousands of people will be left with an unreliable power \nsource if the permit is vacated.”  422 F. Supp. 3d at 103.  It would be “unjust,” that court \nreasoned, “to force all of those people to bear the brunt of the harm when they are not \nresponsible for its cause.”  Id. at 102.  Such is not the case here: the disruption Dakota Access \nfocuses on is to its own interests and those of the industry, both of whom relied on the continued \noperation of the pipeline in the face of ongoing litigation as well as changes in the \nadministration’s stance on the environmental propriety of the pipeline.  The parties do not raise \nany possibility that hundreds of thousands of ordinary citizens will be deprived of a reliable \nsource of oil if DAPL is shut down, and, in fact, as already discussed, oil wells are currently \nbeing closed given a low demand having nothing to do with the pipeline. \nThe other reason that the district court in Semonite considered the disruption too weighty \nto ignore was that the removal of the agency project in question — which “would [have] \ninvolve[d] dismantling seventeen steel lattice towers and removing 37.8 miles of conductor, 8.4 \nmiles of fiber optic shield wire, 32 solar panels and solar lighting systems, and all associated \nhardware” would have posed a “risk of massive waste” should the Corps ultimately “reissue the \npermit after conducting an EIS.”  422 F. Supp. 3d at 103.  The Corps admittedly does raise a \nsimilar removal issue here, pointing out that the dismantling of the pipeline under Lake Oahe \nwould lead to “waste of time, energy, and resources, as well as environmental impacts such as \nground disturbance and increased emissions from heavy construction machinery.”  Corps \nRemedy Br. at 17.  But the Court is not ordering that such step be taken, and any decision to \n  21 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 546   Filed 07/06/20   Page 22 of 24\nremove is entirely within the Corps’ control.  As the agency explains, once the Court vacates the \neasement, the pipeline is considered an “encroachment” on federal lands and can be dealt with in \none of four ways at the Corps’ discretion.  See id. at 6.  Removal is indeed one of those options, \nbut so is “outgrant or consent (for easements).”  Id. (quoting one of the Corps’ engineering \nregulations).  Removal is therefore not the remedy being considered by the Court today, and it \nmay not be the remedy chosen by the Corps in the future.  Accord Standing Rock IV, 282 F. \nSupp. 3d at 107 (“Plaintiffs are not asking for the pipeline itself, or for any existing \ninfrastructure, to be dismantled.”). \n2.  Environmental Disruption \nDakota Access here attempts to resurrect an unsuccessful argument from the last round of \nremedy briefing.  It argues that if DAPL is inoperative, the crude oil must be transported by rail, \nand rail transport has worse environmental consequences than any potential pipeline spill.  In \n2017, however, the Court “reject[ed] th[e] argument” that “alternative modes of transport \nrequired by vacatur, if any, will necessarily increase the risk of an oil spill.”  Id. at 107. \nNot much has changed this time around.  DAPL once again frames the shift to rail \ntransportation in speculative terms.  Compare id. (“Defendants[] assert[] that vacatur ‘could \nresult in at least some portion’ of the oil being moved via train . . . .”), with Corps Remedy Br. at \n21 (“The Corps cannot state definitively that a particular percentage of the oil currently being \ntransported by pipeline would be switched to rail in the event the Pipeline’s easement is \nwithdrawn.”).  Even assuming that some more oil will be transported by rail than would have \nbeen without a shutdown, the only new evidence the Corps and DAPL point to is a recent study \nby the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration comparing modes of oil \ntransport, which ultimately concluded that “[e]ach mode has its own unique safety risks, and \n  22 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 546   Filed 07/06/20   Page 23 of 24\nmore factors or different methodologies need to be considered to comprehensively answer the \nquestion of which mode is the safest.”  ECF No. 507-2 (PHMSA Report) at 9; see id. \n(“Significant knowledge gaps exist for the exposure, vulnerability, and consequences of crude oil \ntransportation.”).  The report did find that, subject to these warnings, pipelines appear to have \nlower spill occurrences and amounts than rail transport.  Id.  While this is certainly an \nimprovement on the dearth of information provided in the last round of remedy briefing, the \nreport’s self-stated limitations do not get Defendants and Defendant-Intervenor much farther \nthan before. \nThe Court cannot forget, moreover, its responsibility to consider the potential \nenvironmental disruption of not vacating the easement, which it has discussed at length in prior \nOpinions and recapped above.  See supra Section III.B.1.  On balance, the inconclusive evidence \nof environmental harm from an unknown number of barrels being transferred to rail \ntransportation does not move the needle toward remand without vacatur. \n* * * \n  Putting this all together, the Court finds that vacatur is the only appropriate remedy here.  \nThe first Allied-Signal prong weighs strongly in its favor, even if the second is a much closer \ncall.  The Court does not reach its decision with blithe disregard for the lives it will affect.  It \nreadily acknowledges that, even with the currently low demand for oil, shutting down the \npipeline will cause significant disruption to DAPL, the North Dakota oil industry, and potentially \nother states.  Yet, given the seriousness of the Corps’ NEPA error, the impossibility of a simple \nfix, the fact that Dakota Access did assume much of its economic risk knowingly, and the \npotential harm each day the pipeline operates, the Court is forced to conclude that the flow of oil \nmust cease.  Not wishing to micromanage the shutdown, it will not prescribe the method by \nwhich DAPL must achieve this.  The Court will nonetheless require the oil to stop flowing and \n  23 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 546   Filed 07/06/20   Page 24 of 24\nthe pipeline to be emptied within 30 days from the date of this Opinion and accompanying \nOrder.  This time period was proposed by the Tribes and should provide sufficient time for the \npipeline to be shut down in a safe and efficient manner, which is undoubtedly in everyone’s \ninterest. \nIV.  Conclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court will vacate the Corps’ decision to grant Dakota \nAccess an easement under the Mineral Leasing Act and order that the Dakota Access Pipeline be \nshut down within 30 days.  A separate Order consistent with this Opinion shall issue this day. \n/s/ James E. Boasberg \n            JAMES E.

Civil Action No. 16-1534 (JEB) (and \nConsolidated Case Nos. 16-1769 and \n16-267) \nU.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS,    \n   \nDefendant, \n \n            and \n \nDAKOTA ACCESS, LLC, \n \n  Defendant-Intervenor and Cross-    \n            Claimant. \n \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nTwo months ago, this Court determined that oil could continue to flow through the \nDakota Access Pipeline while the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducted further \nenvironmental analyses.  See Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \n(Standing Rock IV), 2017 WL 4564714 (D.D.C. Oct. 11, 2017).  Although the prior Opinion \ndeclined to vacate the agency’s easement approval, it left open the question of whether to impose \nany conditions during the remand period.  Plaintiffs, the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 304   Filed 12/04/17   Page 2 of 8\nSioux Tribes, have asked for a series of interim measures to monitor the ongoing operation of the \npipeline.  Defendants oppose such conditions, arguing that the Tribes have not demonstrated a \nneed for injunctive relief and that the proposed measures are unnecessary during remand.   \nAs a threshold matter, the Court concludes that the interim conditions are not a request \nfor injunctive relief; they are instead a means by which the Court can ensure that it receives up-\nto-date and necessary information about the operation of the pipeline and the facts on the ground.  \nIt next determines that the requested measures, each of which is tailored to keeping the Court \nabreast of the conditions at Lake Oahe pending further Corps analysis, are reasonable and \nappropriate.  \nI.  Background \nAs explained in prior Opinions, the parties here are engaged in a protracted dispute over \nthe placement of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) under Lake Oahe in North Dakota.  See, \ne.g., Standing Rock IV, 2017 WL 4564714, at *1-3.  The Lake is a federally regulated body of \nwater that borders the Tribes’ reservations, and it is considered sacred within their spiritual \npractices.  Id. \nIn their most recent challenge to the project, Plaintiffs alleged that the Corps had erred in \nits analysis of the environmental impact of the pipeline crossing, in violation of the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act.  See Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \n(Standing Rock III), 255 F. Supp. 3d 101 (D.D.C. June 14, 2017).  The Court agreed in part and \nremanded the case to the Corps for further analysis.  Id. at 140.  In a subsequent Opinion, issued \non October 11, 2017, the Court examined whether the NEPA violations warranted vacatur of the \nagency’s decisions – and thus a stoppage in the oil flow – during remand.  See Standing Rock \nIV, 2017 WL 4564714.  Finding a “significant likelihood” that the Corps could substantiate its \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 304   Filed 12/04/17   Page 3 of 8\nprior conclusions, the Court answered that question in the negative.  Id. at *8.  In denying such \nrelief, however, it left open the possibility of imposing other, interim conditions during remand.  \nId. at *12.  It ordered further briefing on the issue from both sides, which is now complete. \nII.   Analysis \nA.   Authority to Issue Conditions \nThe Court turns first to the matter of its authority to impose conditions during remand.  \nAs the Tribes correctly note, this question has already been decided by the prior Opinion, in \nwhich the Court found that it possessed jurisdiction to order interim remedies other than vacatur.  \nId. at *12 (rejecting Defendants’ argument that Court lacks jurisdiction to enter interim relief).  \nAlthough the Court therefore considers this matter largely settled, Defendants nonetheless \ncontinue to contend that the proposed conditions are beyond the scope of the Court’s power.  \nThis is not so. \nThe fundamental flaw in Defendants’ argument is in how they characterize the relief \nPlaintiffs seek.  Defendants assert that the Tribes are, in effect, asking for an injunction.  \nAccording to the Corps, “Plaintiffs’ request for ‘alternative measures’ is . . . nothing more than a \nrequest for additional injunctive relief.”  ECF 287 (Corps Brief) at 1-2.  Asserting that the Tribes \nfail to meet the test for such a remedy, the Corps contends that Plaintiffs are not entitled to \ninterim relief.  Id.  \nYet the conditions sought do not constitute injunctive relief.  They do not affect \nDefendants’ ongoing environmental analysis, nor do they constrain the outcome of the remand \nprocess.  Rather, they are largely a means of providing the Court with relevant information \nduring this period.  Each of the interim conditions is tailored to address the Court’s ongoing \nconcern with the risk of a spill at Lake Oahe – a hazard that the previous Opinion described as \n“at the center of this Court’s prior” decision to remand the matter to the Corps.  See Standing \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 304   Filed 12/04/17   Page 4 of 8\nRock IV, 2017 WL 4564714, at *10.  Such information-gathering measures are within the \nCourt’s managerial discretion over this pending case. See also West Virginia v. EPA, Order, No. \n15-1363 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (ordering EPA to file status reports at 30-day intervals while case held \nin abeyance). \nBecause the interim conditions here do not affect the remand process, Defendants’ \nreliance on Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms, 561 U.S. 139 (2010), is misplaced.  The \nCourt there held that the district court had exceeded its authority when, after vacating the Animal \nand Plant Health Inspection Service’s decision to completely deregulate a genetically engineered \ncrop, it additionally entered an injunction preventing the agency from partially deregulating the \ncrop during the remand period.  Id. at 156, 158-59.  Such an injunction, the Court concluded, \ninterfered with the agency’s authority “to decide whether and to what extent it would pursue a \npartial deregulation” and thus impermissibly “pre-empt[ed] the very procedure by which the \nagency could determine . . . that a limited deregulation would not pose any appreciable risk of \nenvironmental harm.”  Id. at 159, 164.  The holding in Monsanto thus resolved an issue \nunconnected with the facts of this case – whether a district court may impose constraints on an \nagency’s authority and decisionmaking during remand.  The interim measures proposed here do \nnot have any such effect. \nOther cases addressing the scope of a court’s supervision during remand are similarly \ninapposite.  These decisions all concern the imposition of injunctive relief relating to the relevant \nagency’s analysis or discretion on remand.  See Bennett v. Donovan, 703 F.3d 582, 588-89 (D.C. \nCir. 2013) (noting that court would not direct agency on remand “to take [a] precise series of \nsteps” with respect to plaintiffs’ mortgage, including “accept[ing] assignment of the mortgage, \npay[ing] off the balance . . .  and then declin[ing] to foreclose”); Palisades Gen. Hosp. Inc. v. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 304   Filed 12/04/17   Page 5 of 8\nLeavitt, 426 F.3d 400, 403 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (stating that district court lacked authority to “order \nspecific relief” after vacating agency decision); Berge v. United States, 949 F. Supp. 2d 36, 47 \n(D.D.C. 2013) (noting no district court jurisdiction to “order specific relief that deprives an \nagency of the ability to reconsider the matter in light of the Court’s decision”). \nYet here, as explained in more detail below, the conditions are not constraints on the \nCorps’ analysis or a grant of “specific relief” to the Tribes.  They do not concern the scope of the \nremand, nor do they affect the agency’s authority over the pipeline.  They are instead means by \nwhich the Court can gather information about the risks posed by the pipeline pending remand \nand can ensure that the status quo is preserved for both sides.  As discussed in the prior Opinion, \nsuch an interim remedy clearly falls within the Court’s general equitable powers.  \nRecent events have made clear, moreover, that there is a pressing need for such ongoing \nmonitoring.  Earlier this month, the Keystone Pipeline leaked 210,000 gallons of oil in Marshall \nCounty, South Dakota.  See Mitch Smith and Julie Bosman, Keystone Pipeline Leaks 210,000 \nGallons of Oil in South Dakota, N.Y. TIMES (Nov. 16, 2017), https://www.nytimes.com/2017/ \n11/16 /us/keystone-pipeline-leaks-south-dakota.html.  The spill occurred near the boundaries of \nthe Lake Traverse Reservation, home of the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate Tribe, thus highlighting \nthe potential impact of pipeline incidents on tribal lands.  Id.  Although the Court is not \nsuggesting that a similar leak is imminent at Lake Oahe, the fact remains that there is an inherent \nrisk with any pipeline.  As stated in the prior Opinion, “[T]here is no doubt that allowing oil to \nflow through the pipeline during remand risks the potentially disruptive effect about which the \nTribes are most concerned – a spill under Lake Oahe.”  Standing Rock IV, 2017 WL 4564714, at \n*10.  Such incidents, the Court noted, “have the potential to wreak havoc on nearby communities \nand ecosystems.”  Id. at *11.  In light of these concerns, it is in the Court’s interests to stay \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 304   Filed 12/04/17   Page 6 of 8\nabreast of any relevant changes during the remand period and to order the parties to provide up-\nto-date information about the pipeline’s operation.  Such reporting will allow the Court to ensure \nthat remand without vacatur remains the appropriate remedy and to monitor any factual \ndevelopments in this ongoing case. \nThe Corps is thus incorrect that the interim conditions are “unwarranted” and “unlikely to \naddress Plaintiffs’ stated concerns with the operation of the pipeline.”  Corps Brief at 4.  Indeed, \nDefendants’ assertion that the Tribes’ “rights, resources, and land are fully protected by the \nexisting easement” presupposes that the status quo will be maintained during the remand process.  \nId. at 5.  Yet without measures to ensure that Defendants share information about ongoing \noperations, there is no clear way for the Court, the parties, or the public to evaluate the efficacy \nof the extant safety measures.  \nB.   Interim Conditions \nPlaintiffs request three specific conditions during the remand period: (1) the finalization \nand implementation of oil-spill response plans at Lake Oahe; (2) completion of a third-party \ncompliance audit; and (3) public reporting of information regarding pipeline operations.  See \nECF 272 (Tribes’ Brief Regarding Remedy) at 36-39.  The Court agrees that each of these \nmeasures is appropriately tailored to monitoring the status of the pipeline during remand.   \nAs to the first, the Corps contends that the Tribes and Dakota Access “either have \nresolved, or are in the process of resolving, the Tribe’s request” and that the relief sought is \ntherefore not “necessary because it appears that the parties have already engaged in the requested \ncoordination.”  Corps Brief at 6.  Dakota Access similarly states that it is “already coordinating” \nwith the Tribes’ emergency-management personnel.  See ECF 288 (Dakota Access Brief) at 4.  \nThe Court, of course, encourages the parties to collaborate in efforts to resolve any pipeline-\n6 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 304   Filed 12/04/17   Page 7 of 8\nrelated dispute.  Yet, in light of the case’s history of contested versions of discussions between \nPlaintiffs and Defendants, it will not rest on such representations.  Instead, the Court will order \nthat the Corps, Dakota Access, and the Tribes coordinate to finalize spill response plans at Lake \nOahe, and that the parties file such plans with the Court by April 1, 2018.  Such a condition is \ndirectly related to the risk of a spill during remand, and it is directed to keeping the Court \ninformed as to all parties’ efforts to preserve the status quo pending the Corps’ further \nenvironmental analysis.  \nThe Court will additionally impose the second requested condition – namely, the \ncompletion of a third-party compliance audit.  In contesting this measure, Dakota Access relies \nheavily on the ongoing authority of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration \nto ensure DAPL’s compliance with federal laws and regulations.  See DA Brief at 5-6.  The \nTribes note, however, that PHMSA itself recognized the potential benefit of having an \nindependent, third-party review.  See Tribes Brief at 10.  Defendants’ assertion that such a \nprocess would be duplicative of PHMSA oversight is therefore unavailing.  As to the Tribes’ \ninvolvement in the process, the Corps asserts that Plaintiffs are asking for their “own experts [to] \nactually participate in the audit,” Corps Brief at 6, and Dakota Access contends that the Tribes \nare seeking to “insert[]” themselves into the process.  See DA Brief at 6.  Yet the Tribes in fact \nrequest only that they be permitted to participate in the selection of the auditor and have the \nopportunity to share their relevant data during the audit process.  See Tribes Brief at 10.  This \nseems reasonable.  The Court will therefore order that Dakota Access select an independent, \nthird-party auditor in consultation with the Tribes.  Because these conditions are imposed in \norder to keep the Court informed of the circumstances at Lake Oahe pending remand, it will \nrequire that the results of this audit process be filed with the Court by April 1, 2018. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 304   Filed 12/04/17   Page 8 of 8\nFinally, the Court will require that Dakota Access file bi-monthly reports regarding the \nstatus of the pipeline during remand, beginning at the end of this month.  With respect to this \ncondition, the Corps contends that such reporting is “unnecessary” and “unlikely to lead to any \nmeaningful differences in the safety of the pipeline.”  Corps Brief at 7.  Yet it never explains \nhow additional information and transparency during the remand process would not enhance \npublic safety and the Court’s understanding of the facts on the ground.  In light of Dakota \nAccess’s agreement to “voluntarily” report on many of the issues raised by the Tribes, there is \nsimilarly no concern that this condition will be unduly burdensome for the company.  See DA \nBrief at 7.  The Court will therefore order that Dakota Access file bi-monthly reports of any \nrepairs or incidents occurring at the segment of the pipeline crossing Lake Oahe. \nIII.   Conclusion \n  The Court, the parties, and the public all have an interest in ensuring that the status quo at \nLake Oahe is preserved pending remand.  In order to obtain the information necessary to monitor \nthe conditions in North Dakota, and to mitigate the risk of any potential spill, the Court will thus \nimpose a series of interim measures.  A separate Order consistent with this Opinion will be \nissued this day.  \n/s/ James E. Boasberg \n            JAMES E.

Civil Action No. 16-1534 (JEB) \nU.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS, et   \nal., \n \n  Defendants. \n \n \nORDER  \n \n  Last week this Court issued a decision denying Plaintiff Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe’s \nMotion for a Preliminary Injunction, which sought to block the introduction of oil into the stretch \nof the Dakota Access Pipeline that runs under Lake Oahe.  See Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. \nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 2017 WL 908538 (D.D.C. Mar. 7, 2017).  Having filed its Notice \nof Appeal on March 10, see ECF No. 164, the Tribe that same day also filed with this Court a \nMotion for Injunction Pending Appeal.  See ECF No. 165.  As oil is likely to enter this segment \nof the pipeline next week, see ECF No. 169 (Status Report), that Motion asked for an immediate \nruling.  See Mot. at 1.  After permitting Defendants only one day to respond, see Minute Order of \nMarch 13, 2017, the Court complies with the timing of Plaintiff’s request, but not with its \nsubstance.  The Motion will thus be denied. \nI.  Legal Standard \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 62(c) provides: “While an appeal is pending from an \ninterlocutory order . . . that . . . denies an injunction, the court may . . . grant an injunction on . . . \nterms that secure the opposing party’s rights.”  To assess the propriety of a stay or an injunction \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 171   Filed 03/14/17   Page 2 of 3\npending appeal, the Court looks to four factors: “(1) the likelihood that the party seeking the stay \nwill prevail on the merits of the appeal; (2) the likelihood that the moving party will be \nirreparably harmed absent a stay; (3) the prospect that others will be harmed if the court grants \nthe stay; and (4) the public interest in granting the stay.”  Cuomo v. Nuclear Regulatory \nComm’n, 772 F.2d 972, 974 (D.C. Cir. 1985); see also Wash. Metro. Area Transit Comm’n v. \nHoliday Tours, Inc., 559 F.2d 841, 842 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 1977); McCammon v. United States, 584 \nF. Supp. 2d 193, 197 (D.D.C. 2008) (consider same factors when party seeks stay or injunction \npending appeal).  In doing so, it bears in mind that an “injunction pending appeal is an \nextraordinary remedy.”  Memphis Publishing Co. v. F.B.I., 195 F. Supp. 3d 1, 3 (D.D.C. 2012) \n(citing Cuomo, 772 F.2d at 978). \nII.  Analysis \nAs in the Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, the critical factor here is Cheyenne River’s \nlack of likelihood of success on the merits.  The Court is well aware of the delicate position a \nmovant like the Tribe faces in asking a court to conclude that its decision is likely to be \noverturned on appeal.  See Loving v. I.R.S., 920 F. Supp. 2d 108, 110 (D.D.C. 2013).  This \nCourt is equally aware (via reversals or remands) that the Court of Appeals does not always \nagree with its decisions.  That said, it nevertheless believes that Plaintiff does not have a strong \ncase on appeal, and an injunction here, unlike a stay in some of the cases cited by Cheyenne \nRiver, would not preserve the status quo.  See Mot. at 2-3 (citing Loving, 920 F. Supp. 2d at 109; \nCREW v. Office of Admin., 593 F. Supp. 2d 156, 158-60 (D.D.C. 2009)).   \nAs to the remaining factors, the Court acknowledges that the Tribe is likely to suffer \nirreparable harm to its members’ religious exercise if oil is introduced into the pipeline, but \nDakota Access would also be substantially harmed by an injunction, given the financial and \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 171   Filed 03/14/17   Page 3 of 3\nlogistical injuries that would ensue.  Finally, the public interest, if consistent with the principles \narticulated in the Presidential Memorandum Regarding Construction of the Dakota Access \nPipeline, see ECF No. 124-1, Exh. G, likely sides with denial.  As the Corps points out, \nmoreover, the Court’s laches analysis in the original Opinion, Standing Rock, 2017 WL 908538, \nat *4-7, also demonstrates that “[t]he public interest would not be served by an injunction \npending appeal.”  Corps Opp. at 6.   A weighing of all four factors, therefore, tips the scale \nagainst the Tribe.   \nIII.  Conclusion \nThe Court, consequently, ORDERS that the Motion for an Injunction Pending Appeal is \nDENIED. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n                                /s/ James E.

This is an action for injunctive and declaratory relief by which Plaintiffs Yankton \nSioux Tribe and the duly elected chairman of its Business and Claims Committee, Robert Flying \nHawk Gointly, \"Tribe\") seek both declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent Federal Defendants \nfrom violating the substantive and procedural requirements of the National Historic Preservation \nAct (\"NHPA\"), the National Environmental Policy Act (\"NEPA\"), the Clean Water Act (\"CWA\"), \nthe 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie (\"1851 Treaty\"), and the Administrative Procedures Act (\"APA\") \nthrough their various decisions, approvals, and verifications under these statutes for the proposed \nDakota Access Pipeline (\"DAPL\" or the \"Pipeline\"). \n2.  DAPL is a proposed crude oil pipeline that would run approximately 1,168 miles \nfrom North Dakota, through South Dakota and Iowa, and into Illinois. \n3.  As currently conceived, DAPL would pump a minimum 570,000 barrels or over 2 \nmillion gallons of crude oil per day from the Bakken and Three Forks production region in North \nDakota to a crude oil market hub located near Patoka, Illinois, and ultimately to refineries located \nin the Midwest and the Gulf Coast. \n4.  The Pipeline will be one of the largest crude oil pipelines in the nation, carrying \nover half of the current capacity ofNorth Dakota's oil production. \n5.  DAPL is one of several pipelines proposed for North Dakota's oil production area. \n6.  The Pipeline's route passes through the Tribe's ancestral homeland, treaty territory, \naboriginal title lands, and other areas of significant cultural, religious and spiritual significance. \n7.  Approximately  38  miles  of the  Pipeline  route  pass  through  treaty  territory \nbelonging to the Tribe and to other member tribes of the Oceti Sakowin, or \"Great Sioux Nation.\" \n2 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01796-JEB   Document 1   Filed 09/08/16   Page 3 of 36\n8.  Pipeline construction requires clearing and grading a permanent 1,168 mile 100-\n150 foot thoroughfare, digging a trench as deep as  10 feet,  building and burying the 30-inch \ndiameter pipeline, and permanent maintenance of a 50-foot right of way above the Pipeline. \n9.  Pipeline  construction  will  permanently  destroy  sites  of  enormous  cultural \nimportance to the Tribe and its members including burial grounds, sacred sites, and other areas of \ncultural and historic importance to the Tribe. \n10.  Once  constructed,  the  Pipeline poses an imminent threat for  leaks  and  spills, \nenvironmental contaminations that are commonly associated with both old and new pipelines. \n11.  The Pipeline will cross six wetland and grassland easements in North Dakota and \n112 wetland and grassland easements in South Dakota impacting a total of71.8 acres ofwetlands \neasements; 23,619 feet and 30.34 acres of projects and flowage easements under the jurisdiction \nof the Army Corps of Engineers (\"Corps\") St.  Louis District; and 3.04 miles of projects and \nflowage easements under the jurisdiction of the Corps Omaha District.  In addition, the Pipeline \nwill cross more than 200 locations containing waters of the United States up to Yz acre in size. \n12.  Instead of conducting a coordinated approach and issuing a consolidated decision, \nthe  Federal government's decision-making and approval process for  the Pipeline has been a \nlabyrinth of fragmented and piecemeal decisions by multiple Federal agencies.  The Federal \ngovernment's approach has led to a complete absence of meaningful consultation with the Tribe \non the environmental and cultural impacts of the proposed Pipeline - consultation that could have \nresulted in the adoption and implementation of reasonable mitigation measures. \n13.  In August of 2016, the Corps St. Louis District released a Final Environmental \nAssessment (\"EA'') and Finding of No Significant Impact (\"FONSI\") purporting to analyze the \ncrossing of federal Corps projects including McGee Creek levee west of the Illinois River (Pike \n3 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01796-JEB   Document 1   Filed 09/08/16   Page 4 of 36\nCounty, IL), the navigation channel of the Illinois River (Pike and Morgan counties, IL), and the \nCoon Run levees east of the Illinois River (specifically, Coon Run Northwest levee and Coon Run \nSoutheast levee) (Scott County, IL).  The Pipeline will cross a total of30.34 acres of projects and \neasements under the jurisdiction of the Corps St. Louis District. \n14.  In June of 2016, Defendant U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (\"FWS\") released an \nEA and FONSI covering authorization to  cross  approximately 417.3  miles of grassland and \nwetland easements in North and South Dakota. \n15.  In July of2016, the Corps Omaha District released an EA and FONSI.  The Corps \nOmaha EA's analysis is limited to the effects of allowing the Pipeline to cross federal flowage \neasements near the upper end of Lake Sakakawea and federally owned lands at Lake Oahe in North \nDakota. \n16.  In March of 2012, the Corps issued a suite of 50 Nationwide Permits (\"NWPs\") \ncovering a wide array of Pipeline-related activities involving discharges into regulated waters of \nthe United States and in \"most cases\" without any further Federal agency involvement. \n17.  Included among this suite of Federal decisions was Nationwide Permit 12 (\"NWP \n12\"),  pursuant  to  which  Dakota  Access,  LLC  sought  verifications  of more  than  200  pre \nconstruction notification (\"PCN\") sites of up to lh acre. \n18.  Upon information and belief, additional Federal approvals are necessary for the \nDAPL. \n19.  As set forward herein, Plaintiffs challenge the Corps' decisions to issue the Corps \nOmaha EA and FONSI and the Corps St. Louis EA and FONSI, and FWS' decision to issue the \nFWS EA and FONSI, for failure to obtain the Tribe's free, prior and informed consent as required \n4 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01796-JEB   Document 1   Filed 09/08/16   Page 5 of 36\nby  the  1851  Fort  Laramie  Treaty,  the  federal  trust  responsibility,  and  the  United  Nations \nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. \n20.  Plaintiffs challenge the Corps' decisions to issue the Corps Omaha EA, the Corps \nOmaha FONSI, NWP 12, and more than 200 PCN verifications for failure to consult with the Tribe \npursuant to the NHPA, Executive Order 13175  (\"EO  13175\"), and agency and departmental \npolicies in the development of the Corps Omaha EA.  Plaintiffs further challenge the Corps' \ndecisions to issue the Corps Omaha EA and the Corps Omaha FONSI for defining the scope of the \narea of potential effects unlawfully narrowly. \n21.  Plaintiffs challenge the Corps' decisions to issue the Corps Omaha EA and FONSI, \nthe Corps St. Louis EA and FONSI, the FWS EA and FONSI, and the Corps' NWP 12 verifications \nof more than 200 PCNs due to the federal agencies' unlawful segmentation of analysis of project \ncomponents,  failure  to  adequately  consider  indirect  and  cumulative  impacts,  and  failing  to \nmeaningfully involve the Tribe on a government-to-government basis in an effort to achieve \nenvironmental justice obligations in violation ofNEPA  . \n22.  Finally, Plaintiffs challenge the Corps' decision to verify more than 200 PCNs for \nfailure to consider the public interest in violation of the CW A. \n23.  Plaintiffs seek orders declaring that Defendants committed the above-described \nviolations  of law,  vacating  and  remanding  Defendants'  unlawful  decisions,  and  enjoining \nDefendants from re-issuing or reinstating their respective decisions unless and until they have \ncomplied with applicable Federal law. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n24.  This is a civil action brought by an Indian tribe with a body duly recognized by the \nSecretary of the Interior, wherein the matter in controversy arises under the Constitution, laws, and \n5 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01796-JEB   Document 1   Filed 09/08/16   Page 6 of 36\ntreaties of the United States. This Court has jurisdiction over the action under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 \n(federal question);  28  U.S.C.  § 1362 (action brought by an Indian tribe);  28  U.S.C.  §  1343 \n(protection of civil rights); the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 701  et seq., which authorizes a federal court to \nfind unlawful and set aside any final agency action that is \"arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law;\" and the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \n§ 2201-2202. \n25.  Venue in this district is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because it is the district \nin which Federal Defendants are headquartered and in which \"a substantial part of the events or \nomissions giving rise to the claim occurred.\" \nPARTIES \n26.  Plaintiff YANKTON SIOUX TRIBE is a federally recognized Indian tribe that is \nnot incorporated under the Indian Reorganization Act, but rather, is governed by a duly adopted \nconstitution and by-laws through its General Council. The Tribe is a member of the Oceti Sakowin \n(\"Seven Council Fires,\" also known as the Great Sioux Nation).  The Tribe brings this suit on its \nown behalf and as parens patriae on behalf of its members to protect its members'  cultural, \nhistoric,  and  environmental  interests  in  the  Tribe's treaty territory,  aboriginal  territory,  and \nancestral lands. \n27.  The Tribe has approximately 9,000 enrolled members. \n28.  The Tribe's headquarters is located at 800 Main Avenue Southwest, Wagner, South \nDakota 57380. \n29.  Plaintiff ROBERT FLYING HAWK is  Chairman of the Yankton Sioux Tribe \nBusiness and Claims Committee.  The claims against Defendants are made in Plaintiff Flying \n6 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01796-JEB   Document 1   Filed 09/08/16   Page 7 of 36\nHawk's personal and official capacity as parens patriae on behalf of the enrolled members of the \nYankton Sioux Tribe. \n30.  The Pipeline route passes through the Tribe's treaty and aboriginal title lands which \nare areas of significant cultural, spiritual, and historical importance to the Tribe. Construction of \nDAPL includes activities such as clearing and grading, digging a trench, and building and burying \nthe pipe, all of which would cause injury to Plaintiffs on a cultural, spiritual, and historical level \nthrough the destruction of burial grounds, sacred sites, and other cultural resource sites. \n31.  Plaintiffs have an interest in preserving the quality of the water, land, air, flora and \nfauna within and outside the Tribe's aboriginal title area and treaty territory. \n32.  Plaintiffs have significant historical ties to the lands in North Dakota (both within \nand outside the treaty territory), South Dakota, and Iowa which would be trenched and traversed \nby the Pipeline. \n33.  As a result of the Tribe's rich historical, ancestral, and aboriginal ties to the lands \nthat would be disturbed by the Pipeline, Plaintiffs have substantial cultural, spiritual, and historical \ninterests in these lands that would be devastated by construction of the Pipeline. \n34.  In addition to numerous cultural sites already identified along the proposed route, \nthere are countless cultural sites of significance to Plaintiffs that the Corps has not identified. \n35.  Destruction or damage to any one cultural, spiritual, or historical resource is an \ninjury to Plaintiffs. \n36.  Plaintiffs also have vital ties to the waters of Missouri River, which are used for \nceremony and viewed as the \"first medicine\" by the Tribe. \n37.  Of particular importance to Plaintiffs is the location where DAPL crosses the James \nRiver.  From time immemorial, the Yankton camped up and down the banks of the James River \n7 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01796-JEB   Document 1   Filed 09/08/16   Page 8 of 36\nand as a consequence, burial, cultural, and historical sites remain along the James River that are at \nimmediate risk of irreparable injury as a result of Defendants' actions and Dakota Access, LLP's \nplanned activities. \n38.  Defendant U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS is a federal agency charged with \nadministering and enforcing Section 404 of the CW A regarding the discharge of dredged or fill \nmaterial into waters of the United States and Sections 10 and 14 of the Rivers and Harbors Act \n(\"RHA\"). \n39.  Defendant Corps issued an EA and a FONSI through its Omaha District for two \nwater crossings in North Dakota and prepared a separate EA through its St. Louis District for \ncrossings of the Illinois River, two levee systems, and a flowage easement in Illinois for the \nPipeline. \n40.  Defendant Corps was responsible for issuing NWP  12, pursuant to  which the \nPipeline would cross over 200 jurisdictional waters of the United States. \n41.  Defendant Corps was responsible for verifying more than 200 PCNs in North \nDakota, South Dakota, Iowa, and Illinois for the Pipeline pursuant to section 10 of the RHA and \nsection 404 of the CW A. \n42.  Defendant Corps is a component ofthe Department of Defense (\"DOD\"). \n43.  Defendant LIEUTENANT GENERAL TODD SEMONITE is the Commanding \nGeneral and Chief of Engineers for the Corps. \n44.  Defendant Semonite was responsible for reviewing and reissuing NWP 12. \n45.  Defendant COLONEL JOHN HENDERSON is the Omaha District Commander \nfor the Corps. \n8 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01796-JEB   Document 1   Filed 09/08/16   Page 9 of 36\n46.  Defendant Henderson was responsible for approving the FONSI for two section \n408 permits for the Pipeline's Missouri River crossings in North Dakota. \n47.  Defendant  COLONEL  ANTHONY  MITCHELL  is  the  St.  Louis  District \nCommander for the Corps. \n48.  Defendant Mitchell was responsible for approving the FONSI for the section 408 \npermit for the Pipeline's various crossings of Corps projects and flowage easements in Illinois. \n49.  Defendant U.S.  FISH  AND  WILDLIFE  SERVICE  is  the  federal  agency that \nmanages wetland and grassland easements that the Pipeline would cross in North Dakota and South \nDakota. \n50.  Defendant FWS was responsible for preparing an EA and FONSI for a Special Use \nPermit (\"SUP\") for the Pipeline. \n51.  Defendant DAN ASHE is the Director ofFWS. \n52.  Defendant Ashe was responsible for overseeing the agency approving the FONSI \nfor the SUP for the crossings of wetland and grassland easements in North Dakota and South \nDakota. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n53.  Plaintiffs reallege paragraphs 1 through 52 and incorporate them by reference. \n54.  During  the  seventeenth  century,  the  Yankton  band  of the  Oceti  Sakowin,  or \n\"Sioux,\" began moving from eastern present-day Minnesota to eastern present-day North Dakota \nand northeastern present-day South Dakota.  By the mid-eighteenth century, the Yankton began \noccupying southeastern South Dakota.  In  1851, along with several other bands of the Oceti \nSakowin, the Yankton signed a peace treaty (the  1851  Treaty) with the United States which \nestablished boundaries of the \"territory of the Sioux or Dahcotah Nation\" (\"treaty territory\"), \n9 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01796-JEB   Document 1   Filed 09/08/16   Page 10 of 36\nwhich consists of vast portions of North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, and Nebraska.  The \ntreaty territory is bounded to the north by the Heart River and to the east by the Missouri River. \n55.  The Pipeline would cross the Heart River at approximately mile post 126.5 of the \nPipeline.  The Pipeline would cross the Missouri River at approximately mile post 164.5 of the \nPipeline. \n56.  The Pipeline would therefore traverse approximately 38 miles of the Tribe's treaty \nterritory.  A map showing the route of the Pipeline through the Tribe's treaty territory is attached \nhereto as \"Exhibit A.\" \n57.  The Tribe has not authorized Dakota Access, LLC to cross its treaty territory. \n58.  The Indian Claims Commission found that the Yankton Sioux Tribe held aboriginal \ntitle to a majority of the land known as \"Royce Area 41 0,\" which encompasses most of southern \nand central present-day South Dakota east of the Missouri River.  A map of the Tribe's aboriginal \ntitle territory is attached hereto as \"Exhibit B.\" \n59.  All of the PCN sites for DAPL within the state of South Dakota lie within this \naboriginal title area.  A map demonstrating the locations of the PCN sites in relation to the Tribe's \naboriginal title territory is attached hereto as \"Exhibit C.\" \n60.  Dakota Access, LLC claims to have completed cultural resource surveys along the \nPipeline route; however, these surveys were performed by non-local and non-Yankton consultants \nhired by  Dakota Access,  LLC  who,  respectfully,  do  not  possess  the  cultural  knowledge  to \nunderstand the significance of and in some cases even identify sites. \n61.  The Tribe was not consulted on protocols that the consultants would follow during \nthe cultural surveys, and those surveys were performed without the participation of the Tribe. \n10 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01796-JEB   Document 1   Filed 09/08/16   Page 11 of 36\n62.  A NWP is a general permit that authorizes activities across the country under CWA   \nsection 404(e). \n63.  In 2012, the Corps issued NWP 12 authorizing the construction, maintenance, or \nrepair of utility lines and associated excavation, backfill, or bedding in all waters of the United \nStates, provided there is no change in pre-construction contours.  The term \"utility line\" includes \npipelines for the transportation of liquid for any purpose, such as oil pipelines.  Under NWP 12, a \npermittee is required to submit a PCN to the Corps district engineer prior to commencing activity \nif any of certain specified criteria is met. \n64.  Dakota Access, LLC sought authorization to construct the Pipeline in waters of the \n_United States which are under the jurisdiction of the Corps under NWP 12. \n65.  As a result of various anticipated water crossings meeting criteria that trigger the \nPCN requirement, Dakota Access, LLC  submitted PCNs to the Corps for 209 sites along the \nPipeline route.  Upon information and belief, some of these PCNs have been withdrawn but the \ntotal number of PCN sites still exceeds 200. \n66.  On July 25, 2016, the Corps issued verification letters verifying ten PCNs in South \nDakota, 62 PCNs in Iowa, and 45 PCNs in Illinois.  Plaintiffs do not have information regarding \nthe  number  of PCNs  issued  in  North  Dakota  at  this  time.  These  verifications  constitute \nauthorization for Dakota Access, LLC to proceed with construction of the Pipeline at the PCN \nsites. \n67.  There was no ability or opportunity for the Tribe to review or comment on the \nCorps' verifications and PCN approvals prior to authorization. \n11 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01796-JEB   Document 1   Filed 09/08/16   Page 12 of 36\n68.  Upon information and belief, the Corps is awaiting further information from a \ncultural resource survey at one PCN site in South Dakota before making a determination about \nverification. \n69.  No EA has been developed for any of the more than 200 PCN sites along the \nPipeline route. \n70.  No tribal consultation has occurred with respect to the more than 200 PCN sites \nalong the Pipeline route. \n71.  No public comment period was held with respect to the more than 200 PCN sites \nalong the Pipeline route. \n72.  Pursuant to the RHA, Dakota Access must obtain a section 408 permit in order to \nconstruct the Pipeline at two  locations in North Dakota where the Pipeline would cross the \nMissouri River. \n73.  With respect to the section 408 permits in North Dakota, the Corps released a draft \nEA on December 8, 2015.  The Corps released the final Corps Omaha EA on or about July 27, \n2016.  The Corps issued the Corps Omaha FONSI on or about July 27, 2016. \n74.  The Corps has failed to provide the Tribe with a copy of the Corps Omaha EA or \nthe Corps Omaha FONSI. \n75.  With respect to the section 408 permits in Illinois, the Corps released the Corps St. \nLouis EA and the Corps St. Louis FONSI in August 2016. \n76.  The Pipeline will cross wetland and grassland easements in North Dakota and South \nDakota, requiring a SUP from FWS. \n12 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01796-JEB   Document 1   Filed 09/08/16   Page 13 of 36\n77.  In addition to the two EAs developed by the Corps, FWS developed a third EA for \nthe Pipeline with respect to grassland and wetland easements.  FWS issued the FWS FONSI on \nJune 22, 2016. \n78.  Pursuant to a letter the Corps sent the Tribe on July 25, 2016, Dakota Access LLC \nwas  set to  begin construction of the Pipeline on July  30,  2016.  The Tribe's tribal  historic \npreservation officer (\"THPO\") later received an email from Dakota Access LLC on August 8, \n2016, notifying the THPO that construction would begin on August 10, 2016. Upon information \nand belief, construction has now commenced. \n79.  On August 3, 2016, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe filed a complaint against the \nCorps for declaratory and injunctive relief in the United States District Court for the District of \nColumbia. \n80.  On August 10, 2016, the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe moved to intervene in the \ncase filed by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in the United States District Court for the District of \nColumbia.  Intervention was granted on August 19,2016. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation oft he 1851 Treaty, the Federal Trust Responsibility, and the United Nations \nDeclaration on the Rights ofI ndigenous Peoples \n81.  Plaintiffs reallege paragraphs 1 through 80 and incorporate them by reference. \n82.  The Corps and FWS violated the 1851 Treaty, their federal trust responsibilities to \nthe Tribe, and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (\"UNDRIP\") \nby issuing the EAs, FONSis, and NWP 12 verifications for PCNs that enable Dakota Access, LLC \nto construct the Pipeline without first obtaining the Tribe's free, prior and informed consent. \n83.  Because  the  Tribe,  as  a  signatory  to  the  1851  Treaty,  does  not  consent  to \nconstruction and operation of the Pipeline, which would traverse its treaty territory, construction \n13 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01796-JEB   Document 1   Filed 09/08/16   Page 14 of 36\nand operation of the Pipeline would constitute a trespass in violation of the 1851 Treaty.  While \nthe boundaries of the Tribe's possessory interest in the treaty territory have been diminished by \nCongress pursuant to its \"plenary powers,\" such alleged powers in fact violate Article VI of the \nUnited States Constitution which declares treaties to be the supreme law of the land.  Federal \napprovals for a trespass to the Tribe's treaty territory violate Article VI  of the United States \nConstitution. \n84.  The  federal  agencies'  decisions violate the non-possessory rights  of the  Tribe \nsecured by the 1851 Treaty and aboriginal rights in land that the Pipeline will cross. \n85.  Furthermore, the Tribe's free,  prior and informed consent is required prior to \nfederal  approval  of the Pipeline.  Indigenous peoples'  free,  prior and informed consent is  a \nprerequisite for the government taking any action that will affect said peoples.  G.A. Res. 61/295, \nU.N. GAOR, 61st Sess., Supp. No. 49, at 6, U.N. Doc. A/RES/611295 (2007). \n86.  The requirement of free, prior and informed consent stems from treaties and the \nfiduciary  relationship  established by  virtue  of those treaties.  It is  a heightened standard of \nconsultation which exceeds the requirements imposed by the NHP A and other federal laws because \nit is the result of the government-to-government relationship between a tribe and the United States \nestablished by treaty. \n87.  The doctrine of free, prior and informed consent has been internationally codified \nin the UNDRIP.  \"States shall consult and cooperate in good faith with the indigenous peoples \nconcerned  in  order  to  obtain  their  free,  prior  and  informed  consent  before  adopting  and \nimplementing legislative or administrative measures that may affect them.\"  UNDRIP at Article \n19. \n14 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01796-JEB   Document 1   Filed 09/08/16   Page 15 of 36\n88.  The Corps and FWS failed to act in good faith with respect to the Tribe in their \ndecisions. \n89.  The Corps and FWS failed to obtain the Tribe's consent prior to issuing their \ndecisions. \n90.  Because the Corps and FWS failed to obtain the Tribe's free, prior and informed \nconsent prior to issuing their decisions to authorize and permit construction of the Pipeline, their \nactions were arbitrary, capricious, abuses of discretion, and not in accordance with law and must \nbe held unlawful and set aside pursuant to the AP A. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation ofS ection I 06 oft he NHPA  , EO 13175 , and Agency and Departmental Policies with \nRespect to Development oft he Corps Omaha EA \n91.  Plaintiffs reallege paragraphs 1 through 90 and incorporate them by reference. \n92.  In the development of the Corps Omaha EA for the North Dakota Lake Sakakawea \nand Lake Oahe crossings, Defendant Corps violated the consultation requirements contained in the \nNHPA, EO  13175, and DOD and Corps policies including Department of Defense Instruction \nNumber 4710.02 (\"DOD Instruction\") and the United States Army Corps of Engineers Tribal \nConsultation Policy (\"Corps Consultation Policy\"). \n93.  The NHPA requires federal agencies to engage in consultation with Indian tribes \nprior to  any federal  undertaking that may affect property of traditional religious and cultural \nimportance to those tribes.  54 U.S.C. § 302706(b). \n94.  In 2000, President Clinton issued EO  13175, which requires federal agencies to \nengage in \"meaningful consultation\" when engaging in a federal undertaking.  Exec. Order No. \n13175, 65 Fed. Reg. 67249 (Nov. 6, 2000). \n15 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01796-JEB   Document 1   Filed 09/08/16   Page 16 of 36\n95.  The  DOD  Instruction  \"implements  DoD  policy,  assigns  responsibilities,  and \nprovides procedures for DoD interactions with federally-recognized tribes.\"  DOD Instruction at \n1. \n96.  Pursuant to the DOD Instruction, the DOD's policy is to \"[m]eet its responsibilities \nto tribes as derived from the Federal trust doctrine, treaties, and agreements between the United \nStates Government and tribal governments, and to comply with Federal statutes, regulations, \nPresidential Memorandums, and Executive Orders governing DoD interactions with tribes.\"  !d. \nat 2. \n97.  The DOD Instruction allocates responsibility to heads of DOD components to \n\"[c  ]onsult with federally-recognized tribal governments on a government-to government basis on \nmatters that may have the potential to significantly affect protected tribal resources, tribal rights, \nor Indian lands.\" !d. at 4.  Furthermore, \"[t]he DoD Components shall involve tribal governments \nearly in the planning process for proposed actions that may have the potential to affect protected \ntribal  rights,  land,  or  resources,  and  shall  endeavor  to  complete  consultations  prior  to \nimplementation of the proposed action. Early involvement means that a tribal government is given \nan opportunity to comment on a proposed action in time for the tribal government to provide \nmeaningful comments that may affect the decision.\" !d. at 4-5. \n98.  The Corps Consultation Policy acknowledges the consultation mandate contained \nin EO 13175 and requires the Corps to honor and fulfill the federal trust responsibility, address \ntribal concerns regarding tribal resources, tribal rights (including treaty rights) and Indian lands, \nprotect tribal  resources  under the  Corps' jurisdiction,  maintain a  government-to-government \nrelationship with tribes, and make tribal consultation an integral process of Corps planning and \nimplementation.  !d. at 2-3.  This necessarily includes taking tribal comments into consideration \n16 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01796-JEB   Document 1   Filed 09/08/16   Page 17 of 36\nwith respect to an activity that has potential to significantly affect tribal resources, tribal rights \n(including treaty rights), and Indian lands. \n99.  The  Corps  Consultation  Policy  defines  consultation  as  an  \"[o]pen,  timely, \nmeaningful, collaborative and effective deliberative communication process that emphasizes trust, \nrespect, and shared responsibility.\"  Id. at 2. \n100.  Additionally,  upon  information  and  belief,  the  Corps  has  been  relying  on  a \nconsultation process set forth in the amended Programmatic Agreement for the Operation and \nManagement of the Missouri River Main Stem System for Compliance with the National Historic \nPreservation Act of 2004 (\"P A\") to fulfill its NHP A section 106 duties.  The P A narrowly applies \nto the Corps' actions involved with \"the ongoing operation and maintenance of the Missouri River \nsystem of main stem dams,\" a scope which does not include the section 408 permits. \n101.  Further, the Yankton Sioux Tribe is not a signatory to the PA. \n102.  The requirements of the PA cannot replace the NHPA's section 106 requirements. \nTo the extent that the consultation process followed by the Corps varies from the requirements of \nsection 106, this process is unlawful and cannot substitute for the section 10 6 process with respect \nto the Tribe. \n103.  To date, the Corps has not engaged in meaningful consultation with the Tribe or \nconsultation that meets the definition contained in the Corps Consultation Policy. \n104.  As a result of the Corps' failure to consult with the Tribe, the Corps' findings of \n\"No Historical Properties Affected\" were \"premature, based on an incomplete identification effort, \nwhich was not sufficiently informed by the knowledge and perspective of consulting parties, \nincluding federally recognized Indian tribes who ascribe religious and cultural significance to \n17 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01796-JEB   Document 1   Filed 09/08/16   Page 18 of 36\nproperties in the APE that may be affected,\" as stated in a letter from the Advisory Council on \nHistoric Properties (\"ACHP\") to the Corps dated May 19,2016. \n105.  On May 18, 2016, representatives from the Corps Omaha District attended a pre \nconsultation meeting with the Tribe at the Tribe's request in order to lay the groundwork for \nconsultation on the EA regarding the Lake Sakakawea and Lake Oahe crossings in North Dakota. \nThe Corps agreed with the Tribe that the meeting would not be deemed \"consultation.\" \n106.  The May 18, 2016 meeting was the first and only meeting between the Tribe and \nthe Corps regarding DAPL. \n107.  The Tribe was in the process of developing Tribal Consultation Protocols to govern \nconsultation between the Tribe and federal agencies at the time of the pre-consultation meeting. \nThe Corps was notified of this fact during the pre-consultation meeting and in a follow-up letter \nfrom the Tribe indicating that the Tribal Consultation Policies were forthcoming. \n108.  The Corps issued the Corps Omaha EA and the Corps Omaha FONSI before the \nTribe had an opportunity to provide the Corps with its Tribal Consultation Protocols and engage \nin meaningful consultation with the  Corps.  The  Corps denied the Tribe the  opportunity to \ncomment on the proposed action in time for the Tribe to provide meaningful comments that may \naffect the Corps' decision. \n109.  In its letter of May 19, 2016 to the Corps, the ACHP stated that \"the Corps does not \nappear to have adequately consulted with the tribes regarding the identification and assessment of \neligibility and effects on properties of religious and cultural significance to them that may be \naffected by the undertaking in PCN areas in the vicinity of water crossings within the project ROW \nthat the applicant assumes will not require PCNs under General Conditions 20 and 31  of the \nNationwide Permit protocols, and in the larger undertaking between water crossings.\" \n18 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01796-JEB   Document 1   Filed 09/08/16   Page 19 of 36\n110.  The  ACHP  repeatedly  alerted  the  Corps  that  their  segmented  approach  was \nresulting in inadequate and fragmented consultation, yet the Corps took no action to remedy its \nblatant consultation failure. \n111.  As the ACHP concluded in its May 19, 2016letter to the Corps, \"[t]he segmented \noversight by three Corps districts and a Corps Civil Works facility has resulted in disjointed and \ninadequate consultation with Indian tribes who may ascribe religious and cultural significance to \nhistoric properties that may be affected by the undertaking.\" \n112.  To date, the Corps has not engaged in meaningful consultation with the  Tribe \nregarding the section 408 permits for the Pipeline's Lake Sakakawea and Lake Oahe crossings. \n113.  Defendant Corps' failure to comply with the consultation requirements contained \nin the NHPA, EO 13175, the DOD Instruction, and the Corps Consultation Policy resulted in a \nFONSI that was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law and \nwhich must be held unlawful and set aside pursuant to the AP A. \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation ofSection 106 ofthe NHPA, EO 13175, and Agency and Departmental Policies with \nRespect to Issuance ofNationwide Permit 12 \n114.  Plaintiffs reallege paragraphs 1 through 113 and incorporate them by reference. \n115.  In  issuing  NWP  12,  Defendant  Corps  violated  the  consultation  requirements \ncontained  in  the  NHPA,  EO  13175,  and the  DOD  and  Corps  policies  including  the  DOD \nInstruction and the Corps Consultation Policy. \n116.  On March 19,2012, the Corps approved 50 NWPs, including NWP 12. \n117.  The Tribe was unaware that the Corps was considering approving NWP 12 before \nit was approved. \n118.  The Corps failed to consult with the Tribe regarding the approval ofNWP 12. \n19 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01796-JEB   Document 1   Filed 09/08/16   Page 20 of 36\n119.  Upon information and belief, no attempt was even made by the Corps to consult \nwith the Tribe regarding NWP 12. \n120.  Defendant Corps' failure to comply with the consultation requirements contained \nin the NHPA, EO 13175, the DOD Instruction, and the Corps Consultation Policy resulted in the \ndecision to approve NWP 12 which was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in \naccordance with law and which must be held unlawful and set aside pursuant to the AP A. \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation ofS ection I 06 oft he NHPA  , E. 0. 13175 , and Agency and Departmental Policies with \nRespect to Verification ofP  CNs \n121.  Plaintiffs reallege paragraphs 1 through 120 and incorporate them by reference. \n122.  Upon information and belief, on July 25, 2016, the Corps issued letters verifying \nthe more than 200 PCNs for the Project located in North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, and Illinois \nwithout meaningfully consulting with the Tribe in violation of the NHPA, EO 13175, and DOD \nan Corps policies including the DOD Instruction and the Corps Consultation Policy. \n123.  The Corps has alleged that it was not required to comply with section 106 of the \nNHP A with respect to the PCN verifications because it claims that it complied with the NHP A \nwhen it issued NWP 12. \n124.  As previously stated, the Tribe was not consulted regarding issuance ofNWP 12 in \n20 12; therefore, the Corps could not possibly have complied with the NHP A for purposes of the \nPCN verifications. \n125.  Upon information and belief, no cultural resource studies were conducted at the \nmore than 200 PCN sites when NWP 12 was approved. \n20 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01796-JEB   Document 1   Filed 09/08/16   Page 21 of 36\n126.  When it issued NWP 12, the Corps unlawfully purported to transfer its section 106 \nduties under the NHP A to private parties, such as Dakota Access, LLC, seeking approval for \nprojects such as DAPL. \n127.  Under NWP 12, the Corps only addresses historic impacts if the project proponent \nalerts the Corps that historical properties would be affected. \n128.  At no time did the Corps even attempt to initiate consultation with the Tribe with \nrespect to the more than 200 PCN sites along the route of the Pipeline, at least eleven of which are \non the Tribe's aboriginal title lands. \n129.  Defendant Corps' failure to complete the section 106 process with regard to the \nPCNs and to comply with the consultation requirements contained in the NHPA, EO 13175, the \nDOD Instruction, and the Corps Consultation Policy resulted in verifications of more than 200 \nPCNs that were arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law and \nwhich must be held unlawful and set aside pursuant to the AP A. \nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation oft he NHPA   in Defining the Area ofP  otential Effects \n130.  Plaintiffs reallege paragraphs 1 through 129 and incorporate them by reference. \n131.  Defendant Corps violated the NHP A by defining the  area of potential effects \n(\"APE\") for the Pipeline in the Corps Omaha EA and the Corps St. Louis EA unlawfully narrowly, \nexcluding from the APE the majority of the Pipeline route, all of which would be affected by the \nCorps' actions to approve section 408 permits. \n132.  In performing an EA, the NHPA requires an agency to determine \"the geographic \narea or areas within which an undertaking may directly or indirectly cause alterations in the \ncharacter or use of historic properties,\" which constitutes the APE.  36 C.F.R. § 800.4(a)(1). \n21 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01796-JEB   Document 1   Filed 09/08/16   Page 22 of 36\n133.  \"Undertaking\"  is  defined  in the  ACHP  regulations  as  \"a project,  activity,  or \nprogram funded in whole or in part under the direct or indirect jurisdiction of a Federal agency, \nincluding those carried out by or on behalf of a Federal agency; those carried out with Federal \nfinancial assistance, and those requiring a Federal permit, license or approval.\"  36 C.F.R.  § \n800.16(y). \n134.  In  this  instance,  the  undertaking  (the  project  requmng  a  federal  permit)  1s \nconstruction of the Pipeline. \n135.  The APE, therefore, is the geographic area or areas within which construction of \nthe  Pipeline  may  directly  or indirectly  cause  alterations  in the  character  or use  of historic \nproperties. \n136.  Even if the undertaking is defined as construction of the Pipeline at the locations \nwhere Corps authorization is required, the APE still encompasses a much broader area than just \nthose locations, as the scope of the APE must include the geographic area or areas within which \nthe undertaking may have direct or indirect effects on historic properties. \n137.  In the Corps EAs, the Corps determined the APE unlawfully narrowly, limiting the \ngeographical scope of the EAs to the crossings of Corps-owned lands and flowage easements. \n138.  In both EAs,  the  Corps failed to  consider construction of the  Pipeline as the \nundertaking and failed to consider direct and indirect effects of construction of the Pipeline in its \nanalyses in violation of the ACHP regulations. \n139.  The clearing, grading, excavation, and construction that would occur along the \nduration of the Pipeline route would destroy any historic or culturally significant sites encountered. \n140.  Given the history and the nature of the land where these activities would occur, \nsuch destructive encounters are highly likely because, as the Corps admitted in the Corps Omaha \n22 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01796-JEB   Document 1   Filed 09/08/16   Page 23 of 36\nEA, \"much of the region has been inhabited by human populations for approximately 12,000 years \n.... The current Project Area has a moderate to high probability for archaeological deposits based \non proximity to permanent water sources, topography, lack of significant ground disturbances, and \ndepositional processes.\"  Corps Omaha EA at 76. \n141.  Upon information and belief, ancient burials are located at or in the immediate \nvicinity of the Pipeline's Lake Oahe crossing. \n142.  Upon information and belief, the remains of an Ihanktowanna, or \"Yanktonai,\" \ncamp are located at or in the immediate vicinity of the Pipeline's Lake Oahe crossing.  The \nIhanktowana are closely related to the Ihanktonwan, or \"Yankton.\" \n143.  Upon information and belief, the remains of an Arikara camp are located at or in \nthe immediate vicinity of the Pipeline's Lake Oahe crossing. \n144.  Upon information and belief, multiple cairns are located at or in the immediate \nvicinity of the Pipeline's Lake Oahe crossing. \n145.  Upon information and belief, numerous burials are located on the Pipeline route \nwhere it crosses the Big Sioux River Wildlife Management Area in Iowa. \n146.  The APEs as defined by the Corps in both of the EAs were unlawfully limited to \nthe \"permit area\" and excluded the vast majority of the Pipeline route, all of which may affect \nhistorical and cultural properties and despite the fact that the Pipeline cannot be completed without \nthe Corps issuing permits and approvals. \n14 7.  In determining the level of effort required for assessing potential effects, including \ndefining the APE, the section 10 6 regulations instruct agencies to consider the degree of federal \ninvolvement.  36 C.F.R. § 800.4(b)(l). \n23 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01796-JEB   Document 1   Filed 09/08/16   Page 24 of 36\n148.  The ACHP pointed out the need for the Corps to expand the unlawfully narrow \nscope ofthe APE in a letter dated March 15, 2016, stating: \nGiven the sheer number of individual permits and the unlikelihood that the pipeline \ncould be constructed but for the issuance of these numerous permits, it is unclear \nhow the Omaha District concluded that its jurisdiction and responsibilities to assess \nenvironmental impacts from the broader undertaking are limited only to the 209 \ncrossings.  We urge the Corps to consider expanding its review of this undertaking \nby redefining the area of potential effects (APE) consistent with 36 CFR Section \n800.16( d) of our regulations, \"Protection of Historic Properties\" (36 CFR Part 800). \n149.  In addition, as the ACHP asserted in a letter to the Corps dated May 6, 2016, \"[i]n \nthe case ofDAPL, three Corps regulatory offices, a Corps Civil Works facility, the Farm Service \nAgency, and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service all have actions related to portions of the \nlarger undertaking.  Accordingly, it appears that the level of federal involvement justifies a greater \nfederal effort to identify and evaluate historic properties.\" \n150.  Furthermore, the ACHP letter stated, \"the pipeline could not be constructed 'but-\nfor' the Corps permits required.\" \n151.  The Corps therefore should have defined the APE to include the entire geographical \narea within which construction of the Pipeline may directly or indirectly affect historic properties. \n152.  The Corps has erroneously taken the position that its review of the Pipeline for \npurposes of the NHP A is governed solely by 33 C.F .R. § 325 Appendix C (\"Appendix C\"), which \npurports to limit the required scope of agency review to the \"permit area\" (33 C.F.R. app. C (5)(f)), \nrather than by the ACHP regulations. \n153.  While  federal  agencies  are  permitted  to  promulgate  their  own  section  106 \nregulations, such regulations must be consistent with the ACHP regulations and must be approved \nby the ACHP.  54 U.S.C. § 306102(b)(5); 36 C.F.R. § 800.14(a)(l)-(2). \n24 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01796-JEB   Document 1   Filed 09/08/16   Page 25 of 36\n154.  Appendix C conflicts with the ACHP regulations governing the scope of required \nagency review. \n155.  Furthermore, the ACHP has never approved Appendix C. \n156.  The Corps' reliance on Appendix C in place of the ACHP regulations violates the \nNHPA  and  has  resulted  in  a  grossly  inadequate  review  of the  Pipeline  under  the  NHP A, \njeopardizing the Tribe's vast cultural and historic resources that lie in the path of the Pipeline's \ndestruction. \n157.  Because  the  Corps  failed  to  properly  define  the  APE  and  instead  excluded \ngeographic areas  within which  construction of the Pipeline may  directly or indirectly  cause \nalterations in the character or use of historic properties, the Corps failed to provide a complete \ncultural and historic resource analysis or properly assess the potential effects of the Pipeline as \nrequired by the NHP A. \n158.  The Corps'  reliance upon regulations which were required to  be  approved but \nwhich were not approved by the ACHP is a violation ofthe NHPA. \n159.  The Corps' lack of consideration of a significant portion of the potential effects of \nthe Pipeline due to the unlawfully narrow scope of the EAs violated the NHP A and resulted in \nFONSis that were arbitrary, capricious, abuses of discretion, and not in accordance with law and \nwhich must be held unlawful and set aside pursuant to the AP A. \nSIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation ofN  EPA   and APA  for Unlawful Segmentation ofP  roject Components, Failing to \nAdequately Consider Indirect and Cumulative Impacts, and Failing to Meaningfully Involve the \nTribe on a Government-to-Government Basis in an Effort to Achieve Environmental Justice \nObligations \n160.  Plaintiffs reallege paragraphs 1 through 159 and incorporate them by reference. \n25 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01796-JEB   Document 1   Filed 09/08/16   Page 26 of 36\n161.  Federal Defendants' numerous Federal authorizations and decisions served as a \ncondition precedent to accomplishment of the Pipeline and triggered NEPA's requirement for \nproduction of an Environmental Impact Statement (\"EIS\") and should have been analyzed in a \nsingle NEP A document. \n162.  NEPA requires production of an EIS for all \"major Federal actions significantly \naffecting the quality of the human environment ... \" 42 U.S.C. §4332(B). A federal action \"affects\" \nthe environment when it \"will or may have an effect\" on the environment.  40 C.F.R. § 1508.3. \nAn EIS is required if the agency finds that the proposed action may have a significant impact on \nthe human environment. \n163.  Council on Environmental Quality (\"CEQ\") regulations explicitly recognize that \nagency actions that are  determined to  have a \"significant\" effect on the human environment \nnormally require production of an EIS.  40 C.F.R. §1501.4. \n164.  Federal agencies are required to develop, discuss in detail, and identify the likely \nenvironmental consequences of proposed mitigation measures.  40 C.F .R. § 1508.25(b) ; 40 C.F .R. \n§ 1502.14(±); 40 C.F.R. § 1502.16(h); 40 C.F.R. § 1505.2(c). \n165.  The NEPA process requires Federal agencies to assess not only the direct impacts \nof a proposed action, but also the indirect and cumulative impacts of past, present, and reasonably \nforeseeable future actions regardless of what agency (Federal or non-Federal) or person undertakes \nsuch other actions.  40 C.F.R. §1508.25(c). \n166.  NEPA mandates consideration of separate components of a single project in a \nsingle NEPA review.  40 C.F .R. § 1508.25.  Specifically, NEP A regulations require that connected \nactions be considered in a single EIS, defining them as actions that \"cannot or will not proceed \n26 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01796-JEB   Document 1   Filed 09/08/16   Page 27 of 36\nunless other actions are taken previously or simultaneously,\" and \"are interdependent parts of a \nlarger action and depend on the larger action for their justification.\" \n167.  Guidance  promulgated  by  the  CEQ  elucidates  the  responsibilities  of Federal \nagencies to achieve environmental justice obligations in the context ofNEPA   compliance.  These \ninclude: consideration of \"the interrelated cultural, social, occupational, historical, or economic \nfactors that may amplify the natural and physical environmental effects of the proposed agency \naction;\"  development of \"effective public participation strategies;\" assurance  of \"meaningful \ncommunity representation in the process;\" and assurance of\"tribal representation in the process in \na manner that is consistent with the government-to-government relationship between the United \nStates  and  tribal  governments,  the  federal  government's  trust  responsibility  to  federally \nrecognized tribes, and any treaty rights.\" CEQ, Environmental Justice: Guidance under the NEPA \n15-16 (1997); accord 59 Fed. Reg. 7629 (Feb. 16, 1994) at§§ 1-101, 3-3, and 4-401  (directing \nagencies to develop policies, programs, procedures, and activities to ensure that minority, low \nincome and impacted communities are meaningfully involved in environmental decision-making). \n168.  Here, Federal Defendants have unlawfully piecemealed and segmented approval \nand analysis of the Pipeline utilizing three separate EAs and FONSis as well as  conducting \n\"verifications\" for more than 200 pre-construction notices along the route of the proposed Pipeline \n- verifications which do not include NEP A analysis or public participation. \n169.  Federal  Defendants  issued  numerous  Federal  authorizations  and  decisions \nincluding, but not limited to, the Omaha EA/FONSI, the Corps St. Louis EA/FONSI, the Corps' \nNWP 12 verifications for more than 200 PCNs along the route of the proposed pipeline as well as \nthe  FWS  EA/FONSI  (collectively,  \"Federal  approvals\")  served  as  a  condition  precedent  to \naccomplishment of the Pipeline. \n27 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01796-JEB   Document 1   Filed 09/08/16   Page 28 of 36\n170.  By piecemealing  the  Federal  approvals  and  analysis  of the  Pipeline,  Federal \nDefendants failed to consider the full indirect and cumulative effects of the Pipeline as required \nbyNEPA. \n17 1.  No  NEP A  document  prepared  by  Federal  Defendants  and  challenged  herein \nanalyzes the indirect and cumulative impacts of Pipeline construction. \n172.  The  Federal  approvals  did  not  properly  consider the  indirect  and  cumulative \nimpacts of Federal Defendants' actions and the scopes of their reviews were too narrow. \n173.  By  piecemealing  the  Federal  approvals  and  analysis  of the  Pipeline,  Federal \nDefendants failed  as  a matter of environmental justice to  adequately involve the Tribe on a \ngovernment-to-government basis in the agency's decisionmaking process. \n174.  Pursuant to Executive Order 12898 (\"EO 12898\"), \"Federal Actions to Address \nEnvironmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations,\" \"each Federal \nagency  shall  make  achieving  environmental  justice  part  of its  mission  by  identifying  and \naddressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental \neffects  of its  programs,  policies,  and  activities  on  minority  populations  and  low-income \npopulations.\"  Exec. Order No. 12898,59 Fed. Reg. 7629 (Feb. 11, 1994). \n175.  In the memorandum to heads of all departments and agencies which accompanied \nEO  12898,  President  Clinton clarified the  environmental justice  duties  of federal  agencies, \nexplaining that \"each Federal agency shall analyze the environmental effects, including human \nhealth, economic and social effects, of Federal actions, including effects on minority communities \nand low-income communities, when such analysis is required by [NEPA].\"  Memorandum from \nWilliam Clinton, President of the United States, for the Heads of All Departments and Agencies \n28 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01796-JEB   Document 1   Filed 09/08/16   Page 29 of 36\n(Feb.  11,  1994),  available  at  https :// www .epa.govI  sites/production/files/20 15-\n02/documents/clinton memo  12898.pdf(Last visited Sept. 7, 2016). \n176.  Because construction of the Pipeline will result in damage to and destruction of \ncultural  and historical  sites  of great importance  to  the  Tribe - a  minority  and  low-income \ncommunity - and because of the spiritual value the Tribe ascribes to the waters of the Missouri \nRiver which will  be threatened by the Pipeline, the Tribe is  disproportionately impacted by \nDefendants' approvals and authorizations for the Pipeline.  These effects on the Tribe were not \nanalyzed in Defendants' NEPA reviews, resulting in arbitrary and capricious decisions. \n177.  The Federal approvals on the whole have a significant impact on the quality of \nhuman environment and require production of an EIS. \n178.  Federal Defendants' unlawful segmentation of Federal approvals for the Pipeline \nand failure to analyze the Pipeline's impacts in a single EIS is arbitrary and capricious, an abuse \nagency discretion, a failure to act in accordance with law and thereby a violation of the AP A, 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \nSEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation oft he CWA and APA  for Failing to Consider the Public Interest When Authorizing the \nNWP 12 Verifications and PCNs \n179.  Plaintiffs reallege paragraphs 1 through 178 and incorporate them by reference. \n180.  The Corps violated the CWA   and AP A by failing to consider the public interest \nwhen authorizing the NWP verifications for the Pipeline. \n181.  The CWA   provides that the Corps \"may issue permits, after notice and opportunity \nfor public hearings[,] for the discharge of dredged or fill material into the navigable waters\" of the \nUnited States. 33 U.S.C. § 1344(a). \n29 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01796-JEB   Document 1   Filed 09/08/16   Page 30 of 36\n182.  The statute authorizes the Corps to issue both individual permits on an activity-by \nactivity  basis  and  general  permits  on a nationwide basis  for  certain categories  of activities \ninvolving discharges of dredged or fill material.  33 U.S.C. § 1344(e)(l). \n183.  Such general permits remain in effect for up to five  years, and are  subject to \nrevocation or modification by the Corps. 33 U.S.C. § 1344(e)(2). \n184.  In reliance on this Congressional directive, the Corps has issued a number ofNWPs \nwhich \"are designed to regulate with little, if any, delay or paperwork certain activities having \nminimal impacts. The NWPs are proposed, issued, modified, reissued (extended), and revoked \nfrom time to time after an opportunity for public notice and comment.\" 33 C.F.R. § 330.l(b). \n185.  NWPs require the permittee to provide advance notification to the Corps before \nengaging in an activity that it believes to be within the scope of the NWP.  The Corps' District \nEngineer (\"DE\") \"will review the notification and may add activity-specific conditions to ensure \nthat the activity complies with the terms and conditions of the NWP and that the adverse impacts \non  the  aquatic  environment  and  other  aspects  of the  public  interest  are  individually  and \ncumulatively minimal.\" 33 C.F.R. § 330.1(e)(2); see also 33 C.F.R. § 330.6(a)(3)(i)(\"The DE may \nadd conditions on a case-by-case basis to clarify compliance with the terms and conditions of an \nNWP or to ensure that the activity will have only minimal individual and cumulative adverse \neffects on the environment, and will not be contrary to the public interest.\"). \n186.  This review process may culminate in the DE issuing a verification to the permittee, \nthereby allowing the activity to move forward. \n187.  The NWP of interest in this case is NWP 12, which the Corps issued on February \n21,  2012.  See  77  Fed.Reg.  10,184.  By  its  terms,  \"[t]his NWP  authorizes  the  construction, \nmaintenance, or repair of utility lines ... and the associated excavation, backfill, or bedding for the \n30 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01796-JEB   Document 1   Filed 09/08/16   Page 31 of 36\nutility lines, in all waters of the United States, provided there is no change in preconstruction \ncontours.\" 77 Fed.Reg. 10,271. \n188.  NWP 12 requires the permittee to submit a PCN to the Corps if certain criteria are \npresent. \n189.  Corps rules  specify that \"[t]o qualify  for  NWP  authorization,  the  prospective \npermittee must comply with ... general conditions\" enumerated therein. 77 Fed.Reg. 10,282. \n190.  The agency rule enumerates 31 general conditions.  Of those, General Condition 31 \nstates that \"[i]n reviewing the PCN for the proposed activity, the district engineer will determine \nwhether the activity authorized by the NWP will result in more than minimal individual or \ncumulative adverse environmental effects or may be contrary to the public interest.\" 77 Fed. Reg. \nat 10,287. \n191.  In conducting a public  interest review, the  Corps must consider the  probable \nimpacts ofthe proposed action and weigh \"all those factors which become relevant.\"  33 C.F.R. § \n320.4(a).  The Corps must balance the benefits \"which reasonably may be expected to accrue\" \nfrom the action against the reasonably foreseeable detriments.  /d.  \"All factors\" which may be \nrelevant to the proposal must be considered, including the extent of the public and private need for \nthe proposal,  and the existence of umesolved conflicts around the resource use.  The DE is \nauthorized to make an \"independent review of the need for the project from the perspective of the \noverall public interest.\"  /d.  § 320.4(g). \n192.  The Corps failed to perform a sufficient public interest review in its verification of \nPCNs for North Dakota, South Dakota, Illinois, and Iowa. \n193.  Specifically, the Corps conducted an arbitrary and segmented approach that ignored \nvirtually all ofthe indirect and cumulative effects of its decision, specifically, the construction and \n31 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01796-JEB   Document 1   Filed 09/08/16   Page 32 of 36\noperation of the Pipeline itself including, but not limited to, an arbitrary and one-sided economic \nbalance in which the benefits of the entire Pipeline were weighted against the impacts of tiny \nsegments of the pipeline. \n194.  The Corps' failure to perform a sufficient public interest review in its verification \nof PCN s for North Dakota, South Dakota, Illinois, and Iowa is arbitrary and capricious, an abuse \nagency discretion, a failure to act in accordance with law and thereby a violation of the AP A, 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nBased upon the foregoing allegations, the Tribe respectfully prays that the Court grant the \nfollowing relief: \nPRAYER FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF: \nA.

This is a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief.  The Cheyenne River Sioux \nTribe (“Tribe”) brings this action in connection with federal actions relating to the Dakota Access \nPipeline (“DAPL”), a 1,168-mile-long crude oil pipeline running from North Dakota to Illinois \nowned by the oil company, Dakota Access LLP (“Dakota Access”).  The Tribe, a federally-\nrecognized Indian Tribe with a reservation in South Dakota (25 U.S.C. § 479a; 81 Fed. Reg. 5020 \n(Jan. 29, 2016), brings this case against Defendant U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”), \n1 \n \n\n \nC  ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 2 of 59\nwhose authorization of DAPL violates the United States’ trust and protectorate relationship with \nthe Tribe, as embodied in the United States Constitution, multiple treaties with the Tribe, federal \nstatutes, executive orders, and regulations, in addition to violating multiple federal statutes that \ngovern pipeline construction and operation.  The construction and operation of the pipeline, as \nauthorized by the Corps, represents an existential threat to the Tribe’s permanent homeland and \nour environmental and economic well-being, and will damage and destroy sites of great historic, \nreligious, and cultural significance to the Tribe. \n2.  Specifically, the DAPL crude oil pipeline approved by the Corps is planned to \ntransect the heart of the Tribe’s ancestral and treaty lands and will run directly under the Missouri \nRiver at the site of the Oahe Reservoir, which is the primary source of water for the Cheyenne \nRiver Sioux Reservation.  The waters of the Missouri River or Mni Šoše are sacred to the Lakota \npeople of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and constitute the lifeblood of our religion and \ntraditions.  Further, the Tribe’s treaties and the federal statutes that govern the Tribe’s rights with \nregard to the Missouri River establish that the Tribe enjoys a clear property right in the waters of \nthe Missouri and enjoys a right to waters that are clean and suitable for drinking, agricultural use, \nhunting, fishing, and other rights.  This property right is subject to the special trust relationship \nbetween the United States and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe.   \n3.  Should this oil pipeline fail, like so many before it have, it will contaminate this \nessential resource and deprive the Tribe of the right guaranteed to us by the United States to rely \non the Missouri River to sustain our homeland.  These public health and safety concerns caused \nDakota Access to abandon an early proposal to run the pipeline under the Missouri River near the \ncity  of  Bismarck,  North  Dakota,  which  relies  upon  these  waters  for  its  municipal  waters.  \nNevertheless, when the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Interior, and the \n2 \n \n\n \nC  ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 3 of 59\nTribe communicated their grave concerns about the environmental impact of siting the DAPL \nunder Tribally-owned waters, the Corps improperly relied upon an Environmental Assessment \n(“EA”) that failed to analyze the significant environmental effects of the oil pipeline on the Tribe’s \nwater.  The Corps’ issuance of the permits that allow Dakota Access to run its pipeline through the \nTribe’s waters was arbitrary and capricious and should be set aside because it violated the National \nEnvironmental  Policy  Act  (“NEPA”),  Department  of  Defense  policies  and  regulations,  and \nbecause it breached the United States’ trust responsibility to the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. \n4.  The Tribe also brings an as-applied challenge to Nationwide Permit 12 (“NWP \n12”), issued by the Corps in 2012 pursuant to the federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and Rivers \nand Harbors Act (“RHA”).  DAPL crosses hundreds if not thousands of federally-regulated rivers, \nstreams, and wetlands along its route.  The discharge of any fill material in such waters is \nprohibited absent authorization from the Corps.  Federal authorization under these statutes, in turn, \ntriggers requirements under the National Historic Preservation Act (“NHPA”), intended to protect \nsites of historic and cultural significance to Tribes like Cheyenne River.  In issuing NWP 12, \nhowever, the Corps authorized discharges into federal waters without ensuring compliance with \nthe NHPA.  In essence, in enacting NWP 12, the Corps pre-authorized construction of DAPL in \nall but a handful of places requiring federal authorization without any oversight from the Corps.  \nIn so doing, the Corps abdicated its statutory responsibility to ensure that such undertakings do not \nharm historically and culturally significant sites. \n5.  In addition, on July 25, 2016, the Corps issued multiple federal authorizations \nneeded to construct the pipeline in certain designated areas along the pipeline route.  One such \nauthorization  allows  Dakota  Access  to  construct  the  pipeline  underneath  Lake  Oahe, \napproximately seventy miles upstream of the Tribe’s reservation.  Others authorize the DAPL to \n3 \n \n\n \nC  ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 4 of 59\ndischarge into waters of the United States at multiple locations throughout the Tribe’s ancestral \nlands.  The Tribe brings this challenge because these authorizations were made in violation of the \nCWA and its governing regulations and without compliance with NHPA, and the NEPA.  These \nauthorizations also violate the Corps’ responsibility to manage the waters of Lake Oahe, which are \nowned by the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, pursuant to the Flood Control Act of 1944, P.L. 83-\n776, Department of Defense policies and regulations, and in violation of the Corps’ trust and \nfiduciary responsibility to the Tribe set forth in statute and Treaty.  \n6.  The Tribe seeks a declaration that the Corps violated the NHPA in issuing NWP \n12, and an injunction preventing the Corps from using NWP 12 as applied to DAPL and directing \nthe Corps to ensure full compliance with § 106 of the NHPA at all sites involving discharges into \nwaters of the United States.  The Tribe also seeks a declaration that the July 25, 2016 authorizations \nwere made in violation of the CWA, NEPA, and NHPA, and an order vacating all existing \nauthorizations and verifications pending full compliance with the CWA, NEPA, and NHPA.  The \nTribe finally seeks a declaration that the Corps’ authorization of the DAPL crossing under the \nMissouri River violated the United States’ trust responsibility to the Tribe, and an order vacating \nall existing authorizations and verifications.  \n7.  The Tribe seeks a declaration the Corps violated the Mineral Leasing Act (“MLA”) \nand the Administrative Procedures in its failure to promulgate regulations in accordance with the \nMLA.  The Tribe also seeks a declaration that any right-of-way issued by the Corps was made in \nviolation of the MLA, and an order vacating the issues of any right-of-way on lands with the Corps \nexercises jurisdiction. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n \n8.  This case arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States, including  the \nSupremacy Clause, U.S. Const., Art. 6; the Treaty of Fort Laramie, 11 Stat. 749 (Sep. 17, 1851); \n4 \n \n\n \nC  ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 5 of 59\nand the 1868 Sioux Nation Treaty, 15 Stat. 635 (Apr. 29, 1868).  This case also states a claim \nunder the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq. (“APA”), which authorizes a \nfederal court to find unlawful and set aside any final agency action that is “arbitrary and capricious, \nan abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  Id. at § 706.  Jurisdiction arises \nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1362 (“district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions, brought \nby any Indian Tribe or band with a governing body duly recognized by the Secretary of the Interior, \nwherein the matter in controversy arises under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United \nStates”); § 2201 (declaratory relief); § 2202 (injunctive relief). \n9.  Venue in this district is appropriate under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because it is the \ndistrict in which the Defendant resides and in which “a substantial part of the events or omissions \ngiving rise to the claim occurred.” \nPARTIES \n \n10.  The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe is a federally-recognized Indian tribe with a \ngoverning body recognized by the Secretary of the Interior.  The Tribe is a member of the Oceti \nŠakowiŋ (“Seven Council Fires,” also known as the Great Sioux Nation), which includes the \nLakota, Dakota, and Nakota people.  The Tribe is comprised of four of the seven bands of Lakota \n(Itazipco, Minnicoujou, Oohenumpa, and Siha Sapa) and is a party to the 1851 Fort Laramie Treaty \nand the 1868 Sioux Nation Treaty.  In those Treaties, the United States made solemn promises to \nthe Tribe, including the explicit guarantee of “protection” and the reservation of lands intended to \nprovide a homeland and subsistence for the Tribe “set apart for [their] absolute and undisturbed \nuse and occupation.”  In consideration for those promises, the Tribe ceded a large portion of their \naboriginal territory in the northern Great Plains.   \n11.  The original territory set aside by the United States for the Tribe was diminished \nover time to create nine much smaller Sioux reservations, including the Cheyenne River.  The \n5 \n \n\n \nC  ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 6 of 59\npresent Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation is bordered on the north by the Standing Rock Sioux \nReservation and bordered on the east by Lake Oahe, upon which the Tribe relies for its very \nsubsistence—its drinking water, its agricultural water, its industrial water, and the waters that \nsupport subsistence and sport hunting, fishing, and boating.  Lake Oahe is the same reservoir of \nthe  Missouri  that  the  proposed  pipeline  is  intended  to  cross.    The  Cheyenne  River  Sioux \nReservation is approximately seventy miles downstream of that proposed crossing.   \n12.  The territory set aside for the Tribe in the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie was vast, \nincluding all of the Dakotas west of the Missouri River and large sections of Montana, Wyoming, \nand Nebraska.  These Treaty lands encompass exactly the site of the proposed pipeline.  Further, \nthe Tribe’s aboriginal territory prior to 1851 included the entirety of the Dakotas (in addition to \nother areas).  Hence, a great portion of the rest of the DAPL pipeline crossing through the Dakotas \nis within the Tribe’s ancestral and ceded lands.   \n13.  The present-day borders of the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation were established \nby the Act of March 2, 1889, 25 Stat. 888, but a significant portion of those lands were later taken \nby an unconsented inundation of Tribal lands when the Defendant here flooded the Missouri River \nto create Lake Oahe in the 1950s which took 104,420 acres of the our very best lands.  Since the \nbeginning of its interactions with the Tribe, however, the United States has reiterated time and \nagain by statute, regulation, and executive order its promise to provide the Tribe with protection, \nsubsistence, a livable homeland, and the waters necessary to maintain the same. \n14.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is an agency of the United States government \nand a division of the U.S. Army, part of the U.S. Department of Defense.  It is charged with \nregulating any dredging and filling of the waters of the United States under § 404 of the CWA and \n6 \n \n\n \nC  ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 7 of 59\n§ 10 of the RHA.  The Corps is empowered by statute to exercise comprehensive control over the \nwaters of Lake Oahe.  33 U.S.C. § 707. \n15.  By filing this action, the Tribe does not waive its sovereign immunity and does not \nconsent to suit as to any claim, demand, offset, or cause of action of the United States, its agencies, \nofficers, agents, or any other person or entity in this or any other court. \n \nTREATIES, STATUTES, AND REGULATONS, RELATED TO THE CORPS’ \nOBLIGATIONS TO MANAGE WATERS OF LAKE OAHE AND TRUST DUTY TO \nTHE TRIBE \n \nI.  THE FORT LARAMIE TREATY OF 1851 AND 1868 SIOUX NATION TREATY \n \n16.  At the close of the War of 1812, the United States settled with Great Britain in the \nTreaty of Ghent, promising that Indian nations and tribes would enjoy the same status with the \nUnited States as they had prior to the War.  Accordingly, the United States sent out treaty \ndelegations to Indian country.  In 1851, the United States entered into a treaty with the Great Sioux \nNation, including the four bands of the Lakota who comprise the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe.  \n1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie, 11 Stat. 749 (Sep. 17, 1851).  In this peacetime treaty, the Tribe \nreserved a vast territory encompassing all of the Dakotas west of the Missouri River and large \nswaths of Montana, Wyoming, and Nebraska.  The United States bound itself to “protect” the \nGreat Sioux Nation “against the commission of all depredations by the people of the said United \nStates, after the ratification of this treaty.” \n17.  From 1867 to 1868, the Great Sioux Nation fought the Powder River War, a series \nof military engagements in which the Sioux Tribes fought to protect the integrity of the Treaty \nlands recognized by the United States in1851 from the incursion of white settlers.  The United \nStates, acting under the auspices of the Indian Peace Commission, sought a treaty to end the war.  \nThe Treaty Commission travelled up the Missouri River to meet with the leaders of the Great Sioux \n7 \n \n\n \nC  ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 8 of 59\nNation where they negotiated the 1868 Sioux Nation Treaty.  15 Stat. 635 (Apr. 29, 1868).  In the \nTreaty of 1868, the Sioux Nation reserved all of the lands west of the low water mark of the \nMissouri River in South Dakota and adjacent lands in North Dakota as the Tribe’s permanent \nhomeland, including without limitation appurtenant waters, natural resources, grazing, timber, \nmineral rights, hunting and fishing rights, usufructuary rights, and absolute and undisturbed use, \noccupancy, ownership, self-government and treaty rights protected by the United States’ honor, \nthe Full Faith and Credit of the United States, the federal trust responsibility and the Constitution \nof the United States.  The Reservation of the Great Sioux Nation’s permanent homeland includes \nthe sacred pledge by the United States that it would be a livable homeland. \nII.  ACT OF MARCH 2, 1889, 25 Stat. 888 \n18.  In 1889, after a prior illegal abrogation of the 1868 Treaty, the United States \nreserved the present-day Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation as the permanent home for the four \nLakota bands that comprise the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe today.  The Act states: \nThat the following tract of land, being a part of the said Great Reservation of the \nSioux Nation, in the Territory of Dakota, is hereby set apart for a permanent \nreservation for the Indians receiving rations and annuities at the Cheyenne River \nAgency, in the said Territory of Dakota, namely:  Beginning at a point in the center \nof the main channel of the Missouri River, ten miles north of the mouth of the \nMoreau River, said point being the southeastern corner of the Standing Rock \nReservation; thence down said center of the main channel of the Missouri River, \nincluding also entirely within said reservation all islands, if any, in said river, to a \npoint opposite the mouth of the Cheyenne River; thence west to said Cheyenne \nRiver, and up the same to its intersection with the one hundred and second meridian \nof longitude; thence north along said meridian to its intersection with a line due \nwest from a point in the Missouri River ten miles north of the mouth of the Moreau \nRiver; thence due east to the place of beginning. \n \n25 Stat. 888, §4. \nThe reservation includes treaty lands, appurtenant waters, natural resources, grazing, timber, \nmineral rights, hunting and fishing rights, usufructuary rights, and absolute and undisturbed use, \n8 \n \n\n \nC  ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 9 of 59\noccupancy and ownership, self-government and treaty rights.  This reservation of land was \naccompanied by a reservation of water rights in the Missouri River to fulfill the purpose of the \nreservation to provide for the Tribe’s self-sufficiency.  Winters v. United States, 207 U.S. 564 \n(1908).  The Tribe enjoys a clear property right in the waters of Lake Oahe and the Missouri River \nreserved to it by the United States by the creation of the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation.  Id.  \nThis Winters right includes the right to clean, safe water that is consistent with the purpose of the \nreservation.  Id. \nIII.  FLOOD CONTROL ACT OF 1944, PUBLIC LAW 83-776 \n19.  In Public Law 83-776, the United States directed the Defendant Army Corps of \nEngineers to construct the Oahe Dam on the Missouri River to provide for federal flood control \nfor Americans living downstream of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe.  The Act permitted a taking \nof Tribal lands that resulted in the inundation 104,420 acres of the Tribe’s very best lands.  Public \nLaw 83-776, however, reserved the Reservation boundaries, appurtenant waters, natural resources, \ngrazing, timber, mineral rights, hunting and fishing rights, usufructuary rights, and absolute and \nundisturbed use occupancy and ownership, self-government and treaty rights. \n20.  The Flood Control Act also granted to the Army Corps of Engineers comprehensive \npower over federally-owned reservoirs such as Lake Oahe, including authority over water use, \nleases, construction, recreation, storage, flood control and navigation, and regulations related to \nthe same.  See 16 U.S.C. §§ 460d, 825s (1946 Ed.); 33 U.S.C. §§ 708, 709 (1946 Ed.).  The Corps’ \ncontrol over federally-owned reservoirs is pervasive, excluding even its sister agencies.  ETSI \nPipeline Project v. Missouri, 484 U.S. 495 (1988). \n21.  The Flood Control Act, further, explicitly prohibits the Corps from taking any \naction  in  its  management  of  Lake  Oahe  that  conflicts  with  present  and  future  beneficial \n9 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 10 of 59\nconsumptive uses of the waters in Lake Oahe for domestic, municipal, stock water, irrigation, \nmining, or industrial purposes.  Act of December 22, 1944, 58 Stat. 887, §1(b). \nIV.  THE CORPS’ TRUST RESPONSIBILITY TO THE TRIBE \n22.  The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe owns reserved water rights guaranteed by its \nTreaties in the waters of Lake Oahe.  “Indian reserved water rights are vested property rights for \nwhich the United States has a trust responsibility, with the United States holding legal title to such \nwater in trust for the benefit of the Indians.”  Criteria and Procedures for the Participation of the \nFederal Government in Negotiations for the Settlement of Indian Water Rights Claims, 55 Fed. \nReg. 9223 (Mar. 12, 1990).  Under the federal trust responsibility, the United States has a duty to \nconserve Indian lands, waters, and natural resources, and appropriately manage tribal natural \nresources  25 U.S.C. § 162(a)-(d).  It is also “the policy of the United States, that all Indian \ncommunities . . . be provided with safe and adequate water supply. . . .”  25 U.S.C § 1632(a) (5).  \nAmong the United States’ core obligations is their duty to prevent upstream users from impairing \na tribes’ reserved right.  See Winters, 207 U.S. at 577-78.  \n23.  The Corps and the Department of Defense exercise their trust responsibility to \nprotect tribes and tribal trust resources by government-to-government consultation with tribes on \nany action under their authority that could impair tribal trust resources or tribal rights.  Department \nof  Defense  Instruction  4710.02  (Sept.  14,  2006);  see  also  Secretary  of  Defense  Policy  on \n“Department of Defense American Indian and Alaska Native Policy,” Oct. 20, 1998; Executive \nOrder 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments (Nov. 6, 2000); \nPresidential Memorandum on Tribal Consultation (Nov. 6, 2009).   While the courts and the Corps \nitself recognize that the Corps owes a trust duty to Tribes, particularly with regard to ensuring that \nTreaty rights are given full effect, the Corps also owes a specific trust responsibility to the Tribe \n10 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 11 of 59\nto protect its reserved water emanating from its comprehensive statutory control over the Tribe’s \ntrust property.     \n24.  The Corps’ duty to the Tribe is a moral obligation of the highest responsibility and \ntrust that should be judged by the most exacting fiduciary standards.  United States v. Jicarilla \nApache Nation, 564 U.S. 162, 207 (2011). \nTHE CLEAN WATER ACT \n \n25.  Congress  enacted  the  CWA  in  order  to  “restore  and  maintain  the  chemical, \nphysical, and biological integrity of the Nation’s waters.”  33 U.S.C. § 1251(a).  To accomplish \nthis goal, the CWA prohibits the discharge of any pollutant, including dredged soil or other fill \nmaterial, into waters of the United States unless authorized by a permit.  Id. at § 1311(a).  Unless \nstatutorily exempt, all discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States must \nbe authorized under a permit issued by the Corps.  Id. at §§ 1344(a)–(e). \n26.  The Corps is authorized to issue two types of permits under § 404:  individual \npermits and general permits.  Id.  The Corps issues individual permits under § 404(a) on a case- \nby-case basis.  Id. at § 1344(a).  Such permits are issued after a review involving, among other \nthings, site specific documentation and analysis, public notice and opportunity for a hearing, public \ninterest analysis, and formal determination.  33 C.F.R. § 322.3, Parts 323, 325. \n27.  The CWA also authorizes the Corps to issue “general” permits on a state, regional, \nor nationwide basis.  33 U.S.C. § 1344(e).  Such general permits may be issued for any category \nof similar activities that “will cause only minimal adverse environmental effects when performed \nseparately, and will have only minimal cumulative adverse effect on the environment.”  Id.  “No \ngeneral permit . . . shall be for a period of more than five years after the date of its issuance.”  33 \n11 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 12 of 59\nU.S.C. § 1344(e)(2).  The purpose of this approach to permitting is to “regulate with little, if any, \ndelay or paperwork certain activities that have minimal impacts.”  33 C.F.R. § 330.1(b). \n28.  The Corps issued the current set of 48 nationwide permits (“NWPs”) in February \nof 2012.  77 Fed. Reg. 10184 (Feb. 21, 2012).  The 2012 NWPs in “most cases” authorize discharge \ninto regulated waters without any further process involving the Corps.  In effect, the NWP pre-\nauthorizes  certain  categories  of  discharge,  without  any  additional  approval  from,  or  even \nnotification to, the Corps.  33 C.F.R. § 330.1(e)(1).  In other instances, discharges cannot occur \nuntil the proponent of the action files a “pre-construction notification” (“PCN”) to the Corps, and \nreceives verification that the proposed action is consistent with the terms of the NWP.  Id. at § \n330.6(a).  The specifics of whether or not a PCN is required are spelled out in each individual \nNWP as well as a series of “general conditions” accompanying the NWP.  77 Fed. Reg. at 10282 \n(listing 31 general conditions). \nTHE RIVERS AND HARBORS ACT \n \n29.  The Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 is the nation’s oldest environmental law.  The \nstatute prohibits a number of activities that impair ports, channels, and other navigable waters.  \nUnlike the CWA, which applies in all waters of the United States, the RHA applies only in \n“navigable” waters, defined as waters subject to the ebb and flow of the tides, or waters that are \n“presently used, or have been used in the past, or may be susceptible for use to transport interstate \nor foreign commerce.”  33 C.F.R. § 329.4. \n30.  Section 10 of the RHA, 33 U.S.C. § 403, among other things, makes it unlawful “to \nexcavate or fill, or in any manner to alter or modify the course, location, condition, or capacity of” \nany navigable water without a permit from the Corps.  Like § 404 permits, § 10 permits may be \nissued as individual permits or pursuant to the NWP program and are generally subject to many of \nthe same regulations. \n12 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 13 of 59\n \n31.  Tunneling under a navigable water requires a § 10 permit from the Corps, even \nwithout any discharge into navigable waters.  33 C.F.R. § 322.3(a) (“For purposes of a Section 10 \npermit, a tunnel or other structure or work under or over a navigable water of the United States is \nconsidered to have an impact on the navigable capacity of the waterbody.”). \n32.  A separate provision of the RHA, known as “Section 408,” makes it unlawful to \n“build upon, alter, deface, destroy, move, injure, obstruct by fastening vessels thereto or otherwise, \nor in any manner whatever impair the usefulness of any sea wall, bulkhead, jetty, dike, levee, \nwharf, pier, or other work built by the United States” without a permit from the Corps.  33 U.S.C. \n§ 408.  Unlike § 10 permits, § 408 permits cannot be issued pursuant to the NWP program but are \nonly issued as individual permits.  Prior to issuance of a § 408 permit, the Corps must determine \nwhether the use or occupation will be injurious to the public interest or impair the usefulness of \nthe project. \nTHE NATIONAL HISTORIC PRESERVATION ACT \n \n33.  Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act requires that, prior to issuance \nof a federal permit or license, federal agencies shall take into consideration the effects of that \n“undertaking” on historic properties.  54 U.S.C. § 306108.  Agencies “must complete the Section \n106 process prior to the approval of the expenditure of any Federal funds on the undertaking or \nprior to the issuance of any license.”  36 C.F.R. § 800.1. \n34.  The NHPA defines undertaking as “a project, activity, or program funded in whole \nor in part under the direct or indirect jurisdiction of a Federal agency, including (1) those carried \nout by or on behalf of the Federal agency; (2) those carried out with Federal financial assistance; \n(3) those requiring a Federal permit, license, or approval; and (4) those subject to State or local \nregulation administered pursuant to a delegation or approval by a Federal agency.”  54 U.S.C. § \n300320; 36 C.F.R. § 800.16(y). \n13 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 14 of 59\n \n35.  Early in the NHPA process, an agency must determine the area of potential effects \n(“APE”) of a federal undertaking.  36 C.F.R. § 800.4(1)(1).  The APE is defined by regulation to \ninclude the area “within which an undertaking may directly or indirectly cause alterations in the \ncharacter or use of historic properties.  The [APE] is influenced by the scale and nature of an \nundertaking and may be different for different kinds of effects caused by the undertaking.”  Id. at \n§ 800.16(d). \n36.  The § 106 process requires consultation with Indian tribes on federal undertakings \nthat potentially affect sites that are culturally significant to Indian tribes.  36 C.F.R. § 800.2(c)(2); \n54 U.S.C. § 302707 (properties “of traditional religious and cultural importance to” a Tribe may \nbe included on the National Register, and federal agencies “shall consult with any Indian Tribe . . \n. that attaches religious or cultural significance” to such properties).  Consultation must occur \nregarding sites with “religious and cultural significance” even if they occur on ancestral or ceded \nland.  Id. at § 800.2(c)(2)(II)(D). \n37.  Under the consultation regulations, an agency official must “ensure” that the \nprocess provides Tribes with “a reasonable opportunity to identify its concerns about historic \nproperties, advise on the identification and evaluation of historic properties . . . articulate its views \non the undertaking’s effects on such properties, and participate in the resolution of adverse effects.”  \nId. at § 800.2(c)(ii)(A).  This requirement imposes on agencies a “reasonable and good faith effort” \nto consult with tribes in a “manner respectful of tribal sovereignty.”  Id. at § 800.2(c)(2)(II)(B). \n38.  Acting “in consultation with . . .  any Indian tribe  . . . that might attach religious \nand cultural significance to properties within the area of potential effects, the agency official shall \ntake steps necessary to identify historic properties within the area of potential effects.”  Id. at § \n14 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 15 of 59\n800.4(b).  The agency must evaluate the historic significance of such sites and determine whether \nthey are potentially eligible for listing under the National Register.  Id. at § 800.4(c).   \n \n39.  If  the  agency  determines  that  no  historic  properties  will  be  affected  by  the \nundertaking, it must provide notice of such finding to the state and tribal historic preservation \noffices, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (“ACHP”), which administers the \nNHPA.  Id. at § 800.4(d).  The regulations give those parties the opportunity to object to such a \nfinding, which elevates the consultation process further.  Id. \n40.  If the agency finds that historic properties are affected, it must provide notification \nto all consulting parties and invite their views to assess adverse effects.  Id.  Any adverse effects \nto historic properties must be resolved, involving all consulting parties and the public.  Id. at § \n800.6.  If adverse effects cannot be resolved, the process is elevated again to the ACHP and the \nhead of the agency undertaking the action.  Id. at § 800.7.  Until this process is complete, the action \nin question cannot go forward. \n41.  The ACHP authorizes agencies to adopt their own regulations for implementing its \n§ 106 obligations.  Such regulations must be reviewed and approved by the ACHP in order to be \nvalid.  Id. at § 800.14. \n42.  The Corps has adopted procedures intended to satisfy its § 106 obligations.  See \nApp. C to 33 C.F.R. Part 325.  Those procedures, which predate amendments to the NHPA that \nsignificantly broaden the role of tribes in the § 106 process, have never been approved by the \nACHP.  Several courts have concluded that the Corps’ NHPA procedures are legally invalid.  \nHowever, the Corps continues to follow these procedures for purposes of § 106 consultation, \nincluding in the process surrounding DAPL. \n15 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 16 of 59\n \n43.  Section 106 regulations also provide an alternative compliance mechanism under \nwhich agencies can negotiate a “programmatic agreement” with the ACHP to resolve “complex \nproject situations or multiple undertakings.”  36 C.F.R. § 800.14(b).  Such agreements are suitable \nfor “when effects on historic properties are similar and repetitive or are multi-State or regional in \nscope;” “when effects on historic properties cannot be fully determined prior to approval of an \nundertaking;” or when “nonfederal parties are delegated major decisionmaking responsibilities,” \namong other situations.  Id. at § 800.14(b)(1).  Programmatic agreements require consultation with \nTribes, among others, as well as public participation. \n44.  The Corps has never adopted a programmatic agreement with the ACHP regarding \nits CWA/RHA permits or any other activity. \nTHE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT \n \n45.  NEPA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321–4370f, is our “basic national charter for protection of \nthe environment.”  40 C.F.R. § 1500.1(a).  It makes environmental protection a part of the mandate \nof every federal agency.  42 U.S.C. § 4332(1). \n46.  NEPA seeks to ensure that federal agencies take a “hard look” at environmental \nconcerns.  One of NEPA’s primary purposes is to ensure that an agency, ‘“in reaching its decision, \nwill have available, and will carefully consider, detailed information concerning significant \nenvironmental impacts.’”  Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 349 \n(1989).  NEPA also “guarantees that the relevant information [concerning environmental impacts] \nwill be made available to the larger audience,” including the public, “that may also play a role in \nthe decisionmaking process and the implementation of the decision.”  Id. \n47.  NEPA requires agencies to fully disclose all of the potential adverse environmental \nimpacts of its decisions before deciding to proceed.  42 U.S.C. § 4332(C).  NEPA also requires \n16 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 17 of 59\nagencies to use high quality, accurate scientific information and to ensure the scientific integrity \nof the analysis.  40 C.F.R. §§ 1500.1(b), 1502.24. \n48.  If an agency action has adverse effects that are “significant,” they need to be \nanalyzed in an environmental impact statement (“EIS”).  40 C.F.R. § 1501.4.  If it is unclear \nwhether impacts are significant enough to warrant an EIS, it may prepare an “environmental \nassessment” (“EA”) to assist in making that determination.  Id.  If the agency determines that no \nEIS is required, it must document that finding in a “finding of no significant impact” (“FONSI”). \n49.  NEPA’s governing regulations define what “range of actions, alternatives, and \nimpacts [must] be considered in an environmental impact statement.”  40 C.F.R. § 1508.25.  This \nis in part what is known as the “scope” of the EIS.  The EIS must consider direct and indirect \neffects.  The direct effects of an action are those effects “which are caused by the action and occur \nat the same time and place.”  40 C.F.R. § 1508.8(a).  The indirect effects of an action are those \neffects “which are caused by the action and are later in time or farther removed in distance, but are \nstill reasonably foreseeable.”  40 C.F.R. § 1508.8(b). \n50.  An agency must also analyze and address the cumulative impacts of a proposed \nproject.  40 C.F.R. § 1508.25(c)(3).  Cumulative impacts are the result of any past, present, or \nfuture actions that are reasonably certain to occur.  Such effects “can result from individually minor \nbut collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time.”  40 C.F.R. § 1508.7. \nTHE MINERAL LEASING ACT \n51.  The Mineral and Leasing Act imposes a mandatory duty that rights-of-way or \npermits  granted  or  renewed  pursuant  to  30  U.S.C.  §  185  shall  be  subject  to  promulgated \nregulations.  \n52.  The relevant section is set forth in 30 U.S.C. § 185(f). \n17 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 18 of 59\n53.  The section is intended to ensure that permits and rights-of-way granted or renewed \npursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act are promulgated in accordance with the provisions of section \n185.  In addition to the mandatory requirement of regulations being promulgated in accordance \nwith the provisions of section 185, the Secretary of the Interior or agency head may prescribe \nadditional terms and conditions regarding the extent, duration, survey, location, construction, \noperation, maintenance, use and termination of such permits and grants.  \n54.  The Corps has not promulgated any regulations or final rule regarding the grant of \nrights-of-way or permits granted or renewed pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act. \n55.   The APA requires promulgated rulemaking by agencies after the public receives \nnotice and an opportunity to comment.  \n56.  It is incumbent upon an agency to follow is own procedures.  Morton v. Ruiz, 415 \nU.S. 199 (1974). \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n \nVI.  INTERESTS OF THE CHEYENNE RIVER SIOUX TRIBE \n \n57.  Since time immemorial, the Tribe’s ancestors—the Oceti Šakowiŋ, also known as \nthe Great Sioux Nation—used and occupied a broad area throughout the northern Great Plains, \nincluding much of the area that Dakota Access proposes to cross with its pipeline.  Although the \nTribe followed migrating buffalo herds without limitation across the North American landscape \n(including present-day Iowa and Illinois), the Tribe’s aboriginal territory prior to the 1851 Fort \n \nLaramie Treaty has been understood to include all of the Dakotas and large parts of Montana, \nWyoming, and Nebraska.  The Tribe’s traditional territories as set forth in the various treaties has \nbeen judicially established to include all of the Dakotas west of the Missouri River and large parts \nof Montana, Wyoming, and Nebraska.  This broad territory embraces a landscape filled with \ncultural and historical significance central to the Tribe’s identity. \n18 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 19 of 59\n58.  The Tribe’s traditional and ancestral territory extends well beyond the current \nReservation’s exterior boundaries, encompassing lands that are the subject of this action, but \nespecially those lands that have been judicially established as treaty territories of the tribe.  The \nCorps and other federal agencies have repeatedly acknowledged the traditional use of lands within \nand around the DAPL route by the Tribe’s ancestors. \n59.  The Tribe’s cultural resources are historically and culturally interrelated over the \nentirety of the land within the Tribe’s traditional territory, within and outside of the exterior \nboundaries of the Reservation.  Protection of the Tribe’s cultural heritage is of significant \nimportance to the Tribe.  Destruction or damage to any one cultural resource, site, or landscape \ncontributes to destruction of the Tribe’s culture, history, and religion.  Injury to the Tribe’s cultural \nresources causes injury to the Tribe and its people. \n60.  Cultural resources of significance to the Tribe are located on the lands that are the \nsubject of this action and adjacent lands.  In addition to specific archaeological sites that have been \nidentified to date, there are numerous significant culturally important sites that have not been \nidentified.  The lands within the pipeline route are culturally and spiritually significant. \n61.  The waters of the Missouri River moreover are sacred to the Tribe and essential to \nthe Tribe’s practice of our religion.  The waters of the Missouri River are themselves a Tribal \ncultural and spiritual resource. \n62.  The Tribe and its members also have a cultural interest in preserving the quality of \nthe land, water, air, fauna, and flora within the Tribe’s traditional territory, within and outside the \nReservation.  For example, the Tribe is concerned with impacts to the habitat of wildlife species \nsuch as piping plovers, least tern, Dakota skipper, the black-footed ferret, and pallid sturgeon, \namong others.  The Tribe has a particular concern for bald eagles, which remain federally protected \n19 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 20 of 59\nand play a significant role in the Tribe’s culture, and which would be adversely affected by the \nproposed pipeline.  The Tribe is greatly concerned with the possibility of oil spills and leaks from \nthe pipeline should it be constructed and operated, particularly into waters that are of considerable \neconomic, religious, and cultural importance to the Tribe. \n63.  The Tribe has a clear legally recognized property right in the waters of Lake Oahe.  \nSee Winters v. United States, 207 U.S. 564 (1908).  When the United States set aside the lands that \ncomprise the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation, it impliedly reserved waters both sufficient to \nsustain the Reservation and of a quality to serve that purpose.  Id.  Although the Tribe has never \nquantified those rights, the Tribe relies upon the waters of Lake Oahe for nearly all of its drinking \nwater, agricultural and industrial water, as well as water to support subsistence and sport hunting \nand fishing.  The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe relies upon the waters of Lake Oahe for its health, \nsafety, and economy.  In light of the Tribe’s almost total reliance upon Lake Oahe for its water, \ncontamination of those waters by toxic discharge or by a failure of the proposed pipeline would \ndevastate the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation, impair our property rights, and threaten the \nTribe’s very existence.  \nTHE CORPS’ ISSUANCE OF NWP 12 \n \n64.  The Corps issued the current suite of 48 NWPs, covering a wide array of potential \nactivities involving discharges into regulated waters, in February of 2012.  77 Fed. Reg. 10184 \n(Feb. 21, 2012).  Of relevance here, NWP 12 governs “utility line activities.”  Id. at 10271.  NWP \n12 authorizes the “construction, maintenance, repair and removal of utility lines and associated \nfacilities” in waters of the United States, providing that the activity does not result in the loss of \ngreater than a ½ acre of waters “for each single and complete project.”  Counterintuitively, a \n“single and complete project” in the case of linear projects like utility lines is any crossing of a \n20 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 21 of 59\nseparate waterbody.  33 C.F.R. § 330.2(i).  Under this definition, a pipeline like DAPL is made up \nof hundreds if not thousands of “single and complete projects.” \n65.  The  NWP  defines  “utility  line”  to  include  “any  pipe  or  pipeline  for  the \ntransportation of any gaseous, liquid, liquescent, or slurry substance, for any purpose.”  77 Fed. \nReg. at 10271.  The Corps considers pipelines carrying crude oil to be covered by NWP 12. \n66.  Under NWP 12, preconstruction notification (“PCN”) to the Corps by a non-federal \nproject proponent, and a verification from the Corps, is required if any one of several criteria is \nmet.  Id. at 10272.  If none of the criteria are met, the proponent is authorized by NWP 12 to \nproceed with the work in regulated waters without additional notification to, or approval from, the \nCorps.  None of the NWP 12-specific criteria relates to historic or cultural preservation. \n67.  The NWP program also includes a set of general conditions that are applicable to \nall NWPs, including NWP 12.  General Condition 20 (“GC 20”) addresses historic properties.  \nUnder GC 20, a non-federal permittee must submit a PCN “if the authorized activity may have the \npotential to cause effects to any historic priorities listed on, determined to be eligible for listing \non, or potentially eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, including \npreviously unidentified properties.”  Id. at 10284.  If a PCN is provided, the Corps purports to \ncomply with § 106 of the NHPA prior to verifying that the NWP is applicable, and work may not \ncommence until such verification is provided.  33 C.F.R. § 330.5(g)(2).  Conversely, if no PCN is \nprovided, no § 106 process occurs. \n68.  GC 20 puts the responsibility on the proponent, not the Corps, to determine whether \nhistoric or culturally significant properties are present, and requires Corps’ verification only if the \nproponent finds such sites and reports them to the Corps via a PCN. \n21 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 22 of 59\n69.  NWP 12 was formally adopted by the Corps in a “Decision Document” signed by \nMajor General Michael J. Walsh on Feb. 13, 2012.  In responding to public comment regarding \npotential impacts to tribal sites, the Decision Document states that compliance with NHPA on \nNWP implementation is carried out via GC 20. \nFACTS RELEVANT TO CHALLENGE TO NWP 12 \n \n70.  The proponent of DAPL proposes to construct a major crude oil pipeline across \n1,168 miles through North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, and Illinois.  The pipeline will have a \ncapacity of 570,000 barrels of crude oil per day, making it one of the largest crude oil pipelines in \nthe nation, carrying over half of the current capacity of North Dakota’s oil production. \n71.  DAPL is one of several pipelines that have been proposed for the North Dakota oil \nproduction area, some of which have been moving on a slower timeline due to environmental \nreview requirements.  DAPL has moved aggressively to get the pipeline constructed as quickly as \npossible. \n72.  The pipeline’s route passes through the Tribe’s ancestral lands, and areas of great \ncultural, religious, and spiritual significance to the Tribe.  Construction of the pipeline includes \nclearing and grading a 100-150 foot access pathway nearly 1,200 miles long, digging a trench as \ndeep as 10 feet, and building and burying the pipeline.  Such work would destroy burial grounds, \nsacred sites, and historically significant areas in its path.  These sites carry enormous cultural \nimportance to the Tribe and its members. \n73.  DAPL claims to have completed cultural resource surveys along the entire pipeline \nlength.  However, the out-of-state, non-Tribal consultants hired by DAPL to do cultural surveys \nare unable to assess the potential cultural significance of sites in this area to the affected Tribes.  \nOnly Tribally-trained and approved consultants have the ability to assess such sites.  The Tribe has \n22 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 23 of 59\nnever had the opportunity to discuss protocols for cultural surveys, or participate in the surveys \nthat were conducted.  Instead, it was provided copies of partial surveys after they were completed. \n74.  Compared to other pipelines, DAPL has taken a highly unusual approach to Corps \npermitting for activities involving discharges into regulated waters.  Rather than seek Corps’ \nverifications on all waters of the U.S. in which pipeline construction would cause a discharge, as \nhas been typical, DAPL has only sought Corps’ verification for a tiny minority of the impacts to \nfederally-regulated waters. \n75.  For example, DAPL’s route through North Dakota is 359 miles.  A 2015 “Wetlands \nand Waterbodies Delineation Report” provided to the state Public Service Commission identifies \n263 waterbodies and 509 wetlands that would be impacted by the pipeline.  However, this \ninformation was never provided to the Corps.  Instead, DAPL submitted PCNs for only two of \nthese sites, at crossings of the Missouri River.  Neither of these PCNs was submitted based on \npotential impacts to historic sites. \n76.  In South Dakota, DAPL would cross 273 miles.  DAPL’s state Public Utilities \nCommission filings reveal 288 waterbody crossings and 102 acres of wetlands impacts.  However, \nDAPL only provided the Corps with PCNs for 10 of these sites.  None of the PCNs in South Dakota \nwas triggered by impacts to historic sites. \n77.  In both states, this delineation of waterbody impacts was only partially complete, \nas DAPL did not have landowner access to all sites along the pipeline route.  Accordingly, some \nof the features were estimated through desktop analysis.  The ultimate number of waterbody and \nwetland impacts remains unknown. \n23 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 24 of 59\n78.  One of the places in South Dakota where Corps’ authorization is required is at Lake \nOahe, where the pipeline would cross underneath the Lake (a dammed section of the Missouri \nRiver) immediately upstream of the Tribe’s reservation. \n79.  Due to its concerns about the configuration of the pipeline and inadequacies in the \nregulatory process, the Tribe has participated in the public meeting process associated with the \npermits, including joining Standing Rock Sioux’s formal technical comments on the Lake Oahe \ncrossing.  The Tribe has repeatedly attempted to interact with the Corps to facilitate in person \ngovernment-to-government consultation with the Tribal Council.  The Tribe is greatly concerned \nabout the risks to the Tribe that would occur if the pipeline was to move forward in its current \nconfiguration.  The Tribe has in particular highlighted the inadequacies of the Corps’ § 106 \nconsultation process with regard to historic and cultural impacts at the Lake Oahe site. \n80.  On  July  25,  2016,  the  Corps  issued  the  NWP  12  verification  and  other \nauthorizations required at the roughly 204 sites in the four states for which verification has been \nrequested along the pipeline’s entire length.  However, prior to that time, construction started along \nthe remainder of the route, including construction involving discharges into the hundreds if not \nthousands of sites where pipeline construction involves discharges into waters of the United States, \nbut for which no PCN is required. \n81.  The Tribe has repeatedly expressed concerns to the Corps regarding construction \nin waters of the United States pursuant to NWP 12 without any § 106 consultation on historic \nimpacts.  On May 19, 2016, the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Historic Preservation Officer, Steve \nVance, wrote to the Corps Omaha District Engineer regarding the extensive work proceeding on \nthe  DAPL  Project  without  any  §  106  consultation.    This  letter  explained  that  non-Tribal \narchaeologists were unable to appreciate the cultural significance of Tribal historic sites, and that \n24 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 25 of 59\nhis office had found the DAPL cultural surveys, conducted by out-of-state archaeologists with no \ntraining in the cultural practices of the Oceti Šakowiŋ to be “gravely deficient.” \n82.  The  letter  requested  that  other  federal  agencies,  such  as  the  United  States \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy, and the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission, take part in the § 106 consultation.  The letter also stated that the DAPL Project \nimpacts to waters of the United States beyond those identified by the Corps and has numerous \npotential historic impacts.   \n83.  The Corps did not respond to Mr. Vance’s raised concerns.  \n84.  The  Tribe’s  concerns  were  highlighted  in  June  of  2016  when  archaeologists \nworking on behalf of the Upper Sioux Tribe discovered a site of great religious and cultural \nsignificance to Oceti Šakowiŋ in the pipeline’s route in Iowa.  The site was not discovered by \nDAPL during its cultural resource surveys, even though it lay directly in the pipeline’s route. \n85.  The pipeline will also impact historic and culturally significant sites in uplands \nalong the pipeline’s route in between areas of Corps’ jurisdiction.  The Corps views any impacts \nto such uplands sites as outside of its responsibility under § 106, as the Corps interprets § 106 to \napply only within the immediate area of CWA jurisdiction. \n86.  The ACHP regulations take a different approach.  In a May 6, 2016 letter to the \nCorps regarding DAPL, the ACHP explained that its regulations “define the undertaking as the \nentire project, portions of which may require federal authorization or assistance.”  Even where the \njurisdiction is limited to particular portions of a project, the ACHP explained, “the federal agency \nremains responsible for taking into account the effects of the undertaking on historic properties.”  \nThe letter concluded that given the close relationship between the project and multiple federal \napprovals, “a greater effort to identify and evaluate historic properties” was required. \n25 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 26 of 59\n87.  In a May 19, 2016, letter, the ACHP formally objected to the Corps’ finding of “no \neffect” at the site of the Lake Oahe crossing, one of only two sites in the entire state of North \nDakota for which the Corps even purported to engage in § 106 consultation.  The ACHP asserted \nthat the Corps misapplied § 106 by considering only historic properties within its areas of \njurisdiction, when it should consider indirect impacts to historic sites in uplands that could not \noccur but for the Corps’ authorization to discharge into waters of the United States. \n88.  At the time of filing this Complaint, DAPL has not executed agreements with all \nlandowners, and eminent domain proceedings are underway in several states.  Additionally, several \nlawsuits have been filed against DAPL and state regulatory agencies which challenge the legality \nof DAPL approvals, and seeking the remedy of vacating such approvals, which would require \nDAPL to stop work.  However, DAPL has chosen to move ahead with construction in places where \nregulatory approval is secured and where landowner consent has been obtained. \n89.  DAPL has been repeatedly told by state regulatory agencies that any construction \nprior to the completion of the regulatory and eminent domain process is at its own risk.  DAPL has \nrepeatedly acknowledged that it bears the risk of starting construction prior to the completion of \nthe regulatory and legal process. \nGENERAL FACTS REGARDING THE CORPS’ ISSUANCE OF THE § 408 \nPERMITS AND CWA VERIFICATIONS \n \n90.  On July 25, 2016, the Corps issued authorizations pursuant to § 408 of the RHA for \nDAPL to cross federally-managed or owned lands on the Missouri River in two places, at Lake \nSakakawea and Lake Oahe, roughly 230 miles apart.  Accompanying this authorization, the Corps \nreleased  a  final  environmental  assessment  (“EA”)  and  “finding  of  no  significant  impact” \n(“FONSI”) with respect to two components of the DAPL in North Dakota.  The EA and FONSI \nconcluded  that  these  two  small  segments  of  the  pipeline  did  not  have  sufficient  adverse \n26 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 27 of 59\nenvironmental impact to warrant preparation of an environmental impact statement (“EIS”), which \nwould  have  triggered  substantially  broader  environmental  review,  a  closer  comparison  of \nalternatives, and greater public engagement. \n91.  Also on that date, the Corps issued verifications pursuant to the CWA and RHA \nfinding that 204 crossings of jurisdictional waters of the United States, for which PCNs had been \nfiled, met the terms of NWP 12.  The verifications include federally-protected waters in four states:  \nNorth Dakota (2 verifications), South Dakota (10 verifications), Iowa (61 verifications), and \nIllinois (45 verifications).  The verifications authorize DAPL proponents to begin construction of \nthe pipeline through federally-regulated streams, rivers, and wetlands, and operate the pipeline to \ntransport  crude  oil  in  the  Tribe’s  culturally  significant  ancestral  lands,  and  adjacent  to  its \nreservation.  DAPL notified tribes that construction was set to begin at many of these sites on or \nbefore August 1, 2016.  Permits have been granted at the Lake Oahe site and construction is \nongoing at this time.   \n92.  On January 5, 2016, the St. Louis District of the Corps released a public notice \nannouncing that it intended to authorize another segment of the pipeline under § 408 of the RHA.  \nThat segment crossed federal flowage easements and federally-managed levees on the Illinois \nRiver.  To date, no permit or even draft environmental review document has been issued for this \nsegment of the pipeline. \n93.  On or about December 17, 2015, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“FWS”) \nreleased a draft EA for yet another segment of the pipeline.  That EA reviewed potential impacts \nof the pipeline over grassland easements held by FWS and managed for wildlife values.  A final \nEA and FONSI were issued by the FWS on June 22, 2016. \n27 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 28 of 59\n94.  The current proposed route crosses Lake Oahe about 70 miles upstream of the \nTribe’s reservation boundary, where any leak or spill from the pipeline would flow directly into \nthe reservation.  The Tribe and its members have been deeply concerned about the potential \nimpacts of the Lake Oahe crossing since its inception, for two primary reasons.  First, the Tribe \nrelies on the waters of Lake Oahe for drinking water, irrigation, fishing, and recreation, and to \ncarry out cultural and religious practices.  The public water supply for the Tribe, which provides \ndrinking water for thousands of people, is located directly downstream of the proposed pipeline \ncrossing route.  Additionally, the cultural and religious significance of these waters cannot be \noverstated.  An oil spill from the pipeline into Lake Oahe would cause an economic, public health \nand welfare, and cultural crisis of the greatest magnitude. \n95.  Pipeline leaks and spills are routine in both new and old pipelines.  A segment of \nthe Keystone pipeline built in 2010 recorded 35 leaks in its first year of operations.  A study of \nNorth Dakota’s pipelines revealed over 300 leaks in two years, most of which were unreported to \nthe public.  Major spills from crude oil pipelines have occurred recently on the Kalamazoo and \nYellowstone Rivers, with devastating economic and environmental impacts.  The Corps does not \nrequire, and DAPL does not propose, any technology or mitigation approaches that reduce risk \nrelative to other recent pipelines that have been the source of major and minor spills and leaks in \nrecent years. \n96.  Second, the Lake Oahe crossing will take place in an area of great cultural, religious \nand spiritual significance to the Tribe.  Construction of the pipeline, which includes clearing and \ngrading a 100-150 foot access pathway nearly 1,200-miles long, digging a trench as deep as 10 \nfeet, and building and burying the pipeline, would destroy burial grounds, sacred sites, and \n28 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 29 of 59\nhistorically significant areas on either side of Lake Oahe.  These sites carry enormous cultural \nimportance to the Tribe and its members. \n97.  Construction  of  pipelines  involves  other  significant  environmental  impacts, \nincluding massive amounts of water required for hydrostatic testing and permanent maintenance \nof a 50-foot right-of-way above the pipeline. \n98.  The confluence of the Cannonball and Missouri Rivers, where the crossing would \ntake place, is a sacred place to the Tribe.  It is a place of great historical significance, serving as a \nplace of peace, prayer, and trade where traditional enemies could meet without risk of violence.  \nThere are numerous sacred stones and historically important sites in the immediate landscape of \nthe Lake Oahe Crossing, few of which have been fully evaluated by Tribal archaeologists. \n99.  The Corps operates Oahe dam, downstream of the Lake Oahe crossing, for flood \ncontrol and other purposes.  The result of its management is that water levels fluctuate greatly in \nthe reservoir, with attendant erosion, scouring, and deposition of sediments.  The geomorphology \nof the segment of Lake Oahe to be crossed by the pipeline is highly dynamic. \n100.  Due to its concerns about the configuration of the pipeline and inadequacies in the \nregulatory process, the Tribe has participated in the public process associated with the permits, \nincluding filing formal technical and legal comments on the Lake Oahe crossing.  The Tribe has \nattempted numerous times to engage in government-to-government consultation with the Corps to \nexpress its concerns, but no avail, and in violation of § 106.  The Tribe has repeatedly conveyed \nto the Corps and other government officials the significance of its concerns and the risks to the \nTribe about moving ahead with the pipeline in its current configuration. \n   \n29 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 30 of 59\nSPECIFIC FACTS RELATED TO NHPA COMPLIANCE FOR  \nJULY 25, 2016 AUTHORIZATIONS \n \n101.  The confluence of the Cannonball and Missouri Rivers is sacred ground to the \nCheyenne River Sioux people.  It is rich in history, and it is rich in cultural and religious \nsignificance.  Industrial development of that site for the crude oil pipeline has a high potential to \ndestroy sites eligible for listing in the National Register. \n102.  The Corps undertook a process to consider the impacts of the Missouri River \ncrossing on historic and culturally significant sites that was flawed in multiple respects.  It defined \nthe “area of potential effects” (“APE”) for the Lake Oahe crossing exceptionally narrowly to \ninclude only a tiny parcel immediately surrounding the horizontal directional drilling (“HDD”) \npits on each side of the river and a narrow strip for an access road and “stringing area” on the west \nside of the crossing.  On the east side of the river, the APE is difficult to determine because in \nsome of the Corps’ figures, the “project workspace” includes both the access road and stringing \narea, while in others only the HDD pit is included. \n103.  The Corps’ attempts at § 106 consultation omit the actual pipeline route that will \nbe entering and existing the HDD borehole.  The pipeline itself will involve a 100-150 yard swath \nof industrial development—clearing, grading, excavation of a 6 to 10 foot trench, and construction \nwork to shape and place the pipeline. \n104.  It  is  likely  that  such  development  would  destroy  any  historic  or  culturally \nsignificant sites in its path.  There are already known but unevaluated historic sites—in other \nwords, sites that may be eligible for protection under the National Historic Preservation Act \n(“NHPA”)—in the direct path of the pipeline immediately in the area of the HDD crossing.  For \nexample, according to the draft EA, several sites are directly in the pipeline’s path in the first mile \noutside of the HDD site. \n30 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 31 of 59\n105.  Consultation with the Tribal Historic Preservation Office (“THPO”) on the DAPL, \nwhich would be routed on historic ancestral land with great cultural and religious importance to \nthe Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, has been profoundly inadequate.  The Tribe has never been able \nto participate meaningfully in assessing the significance of sites that are potentially affected by the \nproject.  \n106.  The non-Tribal consultants hired by DAPL to do cultural surveys are not equipped \nto suitably assess the potential cultural significance of sites in this area.  The Tribe has never had \nthe opportunity to discuss protocols for cultural surveys or participate in the surveys that were \nconducted. \n107.  The Tribe’s first record of correspondence from the Corps related to the DAPL is \ndated October 29, 2014, when a Corps representative contacted the THPO addressing proposed \nsoil boring in Section 10 and 11, Township 134N, Range 79 W, Morton and Emmons Counties, \nNorth Dakota.   \n108.  The Cheyenne River Sioux THPO, Steve Vance, joined Standing Rock Sioux \nTHPO’s formal Complaint, which objected to the Corps’ conclusion that no historic properties \nwould be affected by the bore hole drilling, documenting numerous specific important sites that \ncould be affected as well as the cultural significance of the area generally, and requesting a full \nClass III survey with tribal archaeologists before any work was done. \n109.  No response to this urgent correspondence was ever provided, despite several \nfollow up requests from the Cheyenne River Sioux and Standing Rock Sioux THPOs, and the work \nwas done without any additional tribal consultation or process.   \n31 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 32 of 59\n110.  On February 17, 2015, the Corps sent the THPO a generic form letter seeking to \ninitiate consultation under § 106 on the DAPL.  The Tribe has attempted numerous times to initiate \nsuch government-to-government contact, with no meaningful response from the Corps.  \n111.  In the months that followed, both the THPO and the Chairman of the Tribe followed \nup with numerous additional letters and several in-person requests to the Corps outlining concerns \nabout cultural impacts, and seeking to engage the Corps in a good-faith consultation process as \nrequired by § 106 regulations. \n112.  The Tribe has indicated its significant concerns with properties on the site, and its \nongoing exclusion from the § 106 process.  Due to the lack of interaction and meaningful response \nby the Corps, it became clear to the Tribe that the Corps was attempting to circumvent the § 106 \nprocess.  The THPO urged the Corps to include other federal agencies in the § 106 process and \nbroaden its review to include affected areas outside the Corps’ jurisdiction, as required by \ngoverning regulations.   \n113.  Instead, the Corps’ next action was to publish a draft environmental assessment \n(“EA”) that included not a single mention of the potential impacts of the pipeline project on the \nCheyenne River Sioux or areas of historic and cultural significance to the Tribe. \n114.  Additionally,  the  Corps  received  critical  letters  from  the  U.S.  Environmental \nProtection Agency, the U.S. Department of Interior, and the ACHP, all of whom questioned the \nCorps’ approach to consultation with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.  The ACHP observed that it \nhad “not been provided evidence that the Corps has met” the requirements of § 106, observing that \n“there is likely to be significant tribal interest” and that “[t]he Corps’ approach to meeting its \ngovernment- to-government consultation is extremely important.”  It later asked to be formally \nmade a party to consultation on the project. \n32 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 33 of 59\n115.  Around the time of the draft EA, the Tribe also learned that the proponent had \nconducted cultural surveys at the Lake Oahe site and along the pipeline route during 2014 and \n2015.  Neither the proponent nor the Corps ever consulted with the Tribe about the protocols for \nthose assessments or the area of potential affects, or had invited their participation as the Tribe had \nrepeatedly requested.  Instead, the proponent provided the Tribe with a massive quantity of its \nsurvey data, after it was complete, and provided an opportunity to comment. \n116.  During this same time frame, i.e., late 2015 and early 2016, the proponent stated \nrepeatedly in public and private meetings that construction was slated to start in mid-May of 2016, \nregardless of any additional process requirements or needs. \n117.  The THPO and Chairman Frazier continued attempts to facilitate government-to-\ngovernment consultation with the Corps through the commander of the Omaha District, Col. John \nHenderson.  As the Corps had not met its consultation requirement vis-a-vis the Cheyenne River \nSioux Tribe, the Tribe did not participate in the informal multi-tribe informational meetings and \nsite visits conducted by the Corps.  \n118.  To date there has been no formal government-to-government meeting between the \nCorps and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe.  \n119.  The Tribe has repeatedly advised the Corps that the site generally is rich in \nunassessed sites of historic and cultural significance.  Representatives of the Standing Rock Sioux \nTribe have specifically identified evidence of such sites and notified the Corps of the same.  The \nCorps has refused to acknowledge the Tribes’ identification of its own culturally and historically \nsignificant material on the sites at issue.  \n120.  On April 22, 2016, the Corps made a formal finding that no historic properties were \naffected by the Lake Oahe decision. \n33 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 34 of 59\n121.  On May 19, 2016, the ACHP sent a letter responding to the Corps in response to its \nApril 22, 2016 determination.  The letter laid out a number of significant criticisms of the Corps’ \ncompliance with § 106 and made recommendations for additional steps that Corps should take. \n122.  The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe’s THPO sent a letter to the Corps formally \nobjecting to the “no historic properties effected” on May 19, 2016.  No response was received to \nthese formal objections besides additional general information from the Corps on their permitting \nprocess. \n123.  On May 19, 2016, the ACHP formally objected to the effects determinations made \nby the Corps for DAPL.  The ACHP outlined several fundamental flaws with the Corps § 106 \ncompliance, including a failure to properly define the undertaking and area of potential effects; \ninadequate Tribal consultation and incomplete identification efforts; and numerous procedural \nflaws. \n124.  The April 22, 2016 finding pertains only to the Lake Oahe crossing site.  It does \nnot apply to any the other hundreds of NWP 12 verifications along the pipeline’s route. \n125.  Section 106 consultation is required for the Corps’ verifications as well.  But the \nCorps has not consulted with the Tribe to evaluate the impacts of PCN verifications on historic \nsites within its ancestral lands, including sites in South Dakota, Iowa, and Illinois.  Instead, in \nissuing the verifications, it provided for tribal monitoring during construction. \nSPECIFIC FACTS RELATED TO NEPA COMPLIANCE FOR  \nJULY 25, 2016 AUTHORIZATIONS \n \n126.  The  Corps  is  evaluating  different  components  of  DAPL  in  multiple  separate \nsegments, each following an independent process and on its own timeline.  The Corps’ documents \nfor each segment fail to acknowledge the existence or impacts of the other segments. \n34 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 35 of 59\n127.  One segment is made up of two crossings of Corps-managed or Corps-owned lands \nin North Dakota, at Lake Sakakawea and at Lake Oahe, roughly 230 miles apart from one another.  \nAnother segment is the crossing of Corps-managed and operated land and levees towards the other \nend of the pipeline, on the Illinois River.  Finally, the Corps issued 204 verifications in four states \nthat DAPL can proceed under NWP 12 where they cross jurisdictional waters. \n128.  In  yet  another  NEPA  process,  the  FWS  reviewed  the  impacts  of  providing \nauthorization to cross easements on private land intended to protect wildlife.  In June of 2016, \nFWS released a final EA covering authorization to cross miles of grasslands and wetlands \neasements in North and South Dakota. \n129.  The Corps and FWS have pursued a NEPA process for each of these components \nindependently of the other components.  For the North Dakota crossings, the Omaha District of \nthe Corps released a draft EA in December 2015 and a final EA and FONSI on July 25, 2016.  For \nthe Illinois River crossings, the St. Louis District of the Corps released an EA and FONSI on July \n25, 2016, but without having provided a draft EA and any opportunity for public comment.  For \nthe FWS easements, an EA was issued in June of 2016.  For the CWA NWP 12 verifications, the \nCorps has not taken any action to comply with NEPA, asserting that verifications are not federal \nactions subject to NEPA. \n130.  The North Dakota EA looks narrowly at the impacts of pipeline construction at the \nHDD crossing site only.  It does not look at the indirect effect of facilitating pipeline construction \nto, from, and through the two HDD crossings.  Accordingly, the EA is silent on the impacts to the \nenvironment associated with pipeline construction outside the immediate confines of the HDD \ncrossing site, including oil spill risks to waters or lands of cultural significance to the Tribe. \n35 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 36 of 59\n131.  The North Dakota EA also does not analyze the environmental impacts of the North \nDakota crossings in the context of either the CWA verifications for the pipeline, the Illinois River \n§ 408. \n132.  The North Dakota EA also does not analyze the environmental impacts of the North \nDakota crossings in the context of either the CWA verifications for the pipeline, the  Illinois River \n§ 408  permit, or the FWS easement crossings, all of which are integrally related to a single pipeline \nproject. \n133.  In multiple sets of legal comments, the Tribe expressed its concerns regarding these \nand many other issues associated with the NEPA process. \n134.  On January 8, 2016, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) sent \ncomments to the Corps on the draft EA saying that the document lacked “sufficient analysis of \ndirect and indirect impacts to water resources,” lacks information related to the operation of the \npipeline, and that the document is “limited to small portions of the complete project and does not \nidentify the related effects of the entire project segment.” \n135.  EPA sent additional comments on March 11, 2016, highlighting the proximity of \ntribal drinking water intake to the pipeline crossing.  The letter highlighted multiple risks to water \nresources  from  the  project,  recommended  additional  analysis  of  emergency  preparedness \nmeasures, and urged consideration of additional alternatives that reduced potential conflicts with \ndrinking water supplies. \n136.  On March 29, 2016, the U.S. Department of the Interior sent a comment letter to \nthe Corps urging preparation of a full Environmental Impact Statement (“EIS”).  DOI highlighted \nthe risks to the tribal lands and drinking water resources.  The letter also observed that the Corps’ \nNEPA analysis should consider more of the pipeline route as a connected action under NEPA. \n36 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 37 of 59\n137.  The Corps did not prepare a full EIS.  Instead, it released its final EA on July 25, \n2016.  The final EA provided only cursory responses to the agency and tribal comments regarding \ndrinking water and downstream impact. \nSPECIFIC FACTS RELATED TO CWA/RHA COMPLIANCE FOR  \nJULY 25, 2016 AUTHORIZATIONS \n \n138.  Construction of the DAPL will involve dredge and/or fill in waters of the United \nStates in hundreds if not thousands of locations.  Construction of DAPL will also involve \nobstructions to the capacity of navigable waters of the United States. \n139.  The Corps is only issuing individual permits at three locations on the entire length \nof the pipeline:  at the two North Dakota reservoir crossings, and at the Illinois River crossing.  \nThose components of the pipeline require a permit under § 408 of the Rivers and Harbors Act and \nreal estate actions because the pipeline will cross federally-owned or managed land. \n140.  The remainder of the pipeline’s impacts on jurisdictional waters is being processed \nunder NWP 12, which authorizes certain actions without an individual permit. \n141.  With respect to PCNs and verifications, the final verifications identify 2 locations \nin North Dakota, 10 locations in South Dakota, 61 locations in Iowa, and 45 locations in Illinois, \nfor a total of 204 crossings in 1,168 miles of pipeline. \n142.  Since the purpose of the pipeline is to carry crude oil developed in western North \nDakota to sites in Illinois, no component of the pipeline is useful without all of the other \ncomponents of the pipeline in place. \n143.  The Lake Oahe pipeline crossing will take place in to the Tribe’s public water \nsupply, as well as a number of private water supplies, and irrigation intakes.  The crossing will \nalso impair tribal treaty rights on the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation, including reserved water \nrights. \n37 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 38 of 59\nFACTS RELATING TO CORPS’ FAILURE TO MEET TRUST \nRESPONSIBILITY TO TRIBE AND THE CORPS’ VIOLATION OF  \nFLOOD CONTROL ACT \n \n144.  The Corps has authorized Dakota Access to discharge into Lake Oahe and to \nconstruct a crude oil pipeline under this body of water. \n145.  The Tribe has a clear property right in the waters of Lake Oahe under federal law \nand it is a trust property of the Tribe. \n146.  The Tribe draws nearly all of its drinking water from a water intake that pumps \nwater directly from the Lake Oahe. \n147.  The Corps has never consulted with the Tribe concerning any discharges into this \ntrust property nor the effects of the construction and operation of this oil pipeline on the trust \nproperty. \n148.  The Corps failed to include any consideration of the effects of the discharges into \nthe trust property and effects of the construction and operation of this oil pipeline on the trust \nproperty on the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe in its EA. \nSPECIFIC FACTS RELATING THE CORPS  \nFAILURE TO PROMULGATE REGULATIONS \n \n149.  Dakota Access requires a right-of-way across lands owned by the Corp in order to \nengage in HDD boring under Lake Oahe. \n150.  The Corps had indicated that it has granted this right-of-way. \n151.  The  Mineral  Leasing  Act  imposed  a  clear  duty  on  the  Corps  to  promulgate \nregulations associated with grants or renewals of rights-of-way or permits it issues pursuant to the \nMLA. \n152.  Corps has failed to promulgate any regulations or final rule. \n38 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 39 of 59\n153.  Corps failure to provide notice to the public and opportunity to comment on any \nproposed rules.  \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n \nI.  FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \nFAILURE TO CONSULT UNDER § 106 OF THE NHPA \n \n154.  Intervenor-Plaintiff reincorporates the allegations in all preceding paragraphs. \n155.  Issuance of an individual or general § 404 permit is an “undertaking” as defined in \nthe NHPA.  As such, § 106 consultation is required to determine the effect of such undertaking on \nhistoric properties. \n156.  The Corps failed to consider the impacts of NWP 12 on historic or culturally \nsignificant properties, or otherwise engage in the § 106 process, prior to issuance of NWP 12 in \n2012. \n157.  The Corps has never developed a programmatic agreement with the ACHP with \nrespect to the NWP program. \n158.  Issuance of NWP 12 is a “final agency action” within the meaning of the APA. \n159.  The  Corps’  failure  to  comply  with  the  requirements  of  the  NHPA  and  its \nimplementing regulations is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law in violation of the APA, 5 \nU.S.C. § 706. \nII.  SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \nUNLAWFUL ABDICATION OF § 106 RESPONSIBILITIES \n \n160.  Intervenor-Plaintiff reincorporates the allegations in all preceding paragraphs. \n161.  Section 106 of the NHPA directs federal agency heads to take into account the \neffect of any undertaking on historic properties, and provide the ACHP and affected parties a \nreasonable opportunity to comment on such undertaking. \n39 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 40 of 59\n162.  Under ACHP regulations, “it is the statutory obligation of the Federal agency to \nfulfill the requirements of section 106 and to ensure that an agency official with jurisdiction over \nan undertaking takes legal and financial responsibility for section 106 compliance . . . .”  36 C.F.R. \n§ 800.2(a). \n163.  In issuing NWP 12, however, the Corps does not fulfill the requirements of § 106 \nor  “take  legal  and  financial  responsibility”  for  compliance.    Rather,  it  provided  up-front \nCWA/RHA authorization to discharge fill into waters of the United States, effectively ending its \ninvolvement in most situations.  In so doing, it improperly abdicated its § 106 responsibility, and \ndelegated to the proponent its NHPA duty to determine whether there would be any potential \nimpact to historic properties.  If the proponent determines for itself that no historic properties are \naffected,  the  Corps  is  not  notified  of  the  action  and  provides  no  verification  of  NWP  12 \nauthorization.  In such circumstances, the Corps does not consider, and does not give the ACHP \nor interested parties a reasonable opportunity to comment on, the potential impacts to historic sites.  \nIn so doing, the Corps abdicated its § 106 duties and/or improperly delegated them to private \nparties. \n164.  ACHP regulations direct that agencies “shall involve” consulting parties in findings \nand determinations made during the § 106 process.  36 C.F.R. § 800.2(a)(4).  Consulting parties \nmust include Indian Tribes “that attach religious and cultural significance to historic properties \nthat may be affected by an undertaking.”  Id. § 800.2(c)(2).  The agency “shall ensure” that the § \n106 process provides such Tribe “ a reasonable opportunity” to “identify its concerns about historic \nproperties, advise on the identification and evaluation of historic properties, including those of \ntraditional religious and cultural importance, articulate its views on the undertaking’s effects on \nsuch properties, and participate in the resolution of adverse effects.”  Id. § 800.2(c)(2)(ii)(A).  \n40 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 41 of 59\nFurther, it is the “responsibility of the agency official to make a reasonable and good faith effort \nto identify Indian Tribes” to be consulted in the § 106 process.  Id. § 800.2(c)(4). \n165.  Applicants for federal permits are “entitled to participate” as consulting parties in \n§ 106 consultation, and the responsible official may “authorize an applicant . . . to initiate \nconsultation  with”  consulting  parties,  but  “remains  legally  responsible  for  all  findings  and \ndeterminations charged to the agency official.”  Id.  Such authorization requires notice to all state \nand  tribal  historic  preservation  offices,  and  federal  agencies  “remain  responsible  for  their \ngovernment-to-government relationships with Indian Tribes.”  Id.  Moreover “the views of the \npublic are essential” to the § 106 process and agencies “shall seek and consider the views of the \npublic” in carrying out its responsibilities.  Id. § 800.2(d). \n166.  Additionally, ACHP regulations require Federal agencies to “ensure”  that all \nactions taken by employees or contractors “shall meet professional standards under regulations \ndeveloped by” the ACHP.  However, in issuing NWP 12 and GC 20, the Corps did not “ensure” \nthat any standards at all would be used by private parties delegated to make their own § 106 \nthreshold determinations. \n167.  In enacting NWP 12 and GC 20, the Corps authorized discharges into waters of the \nUnited States in a way that sidesteps virtually all of the requirements of the ACHP § 106 \nregulations.    Under  NWP  12  and  GC  20,  private  project  proponents  can  make  their  own \ndeterminations as to the effects on tribally-significant sites without any involvement of the Tribes.  \nUnder NWP 12 and GC 20, Tribes are not provided any opportunity, let alone a reasonable one, \nto identify their concerns or assist in the identification of historic sites.  Under NWP 12 and GC \n20, the Corps is not responsible for the findings and determinations regarding adverse effects.  \nUnder NWP 12 and GC 20, private project proponents can be made in a vacuum, with no input, \n41 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 42 of 59\nno notice, no accountability, and no oversight.  Moreover NWP 12 and GC 20 do not establish \ndefinitions or standards to be used by private project proponents on how to make determinations \nof historic impacts, leaving it up to the proponents’ unfettered discretion to determine whether a \nPCN is required or not. \n168.  NWP 12 and CG 20 are being applied to DAPL to authorize discharges into waters \nof the United States with no verification or oversight by the Corps, and no accompanying § 106 \nprocess.  Through NWP 12 and GC 20, the Corps is violating non-delegable duties:  there is no \nconsultation process, there are no standards governing determinations made by private parties, and \nthe Corps has no mechanism to “ensure” compliance with its legal responsibilities. \n169.  The Tribe is harmed by NWP 12 and GC 20 because they have led and will continue \nto lead to the destruction of culturally significant sites.  Following NWP 12 and GC 20, DAPL \nproponents have conducted gravely deficient cultural surveys, with no involvement by the Tribes.  \nDAPL  proponents  have  not  found  historic  properties  that  would  be  affected  by  pipeline \nconstruction in Corps’ jurisdictional areas.  Accordingly, they have not filed PCNs and sought \nverification at the vast majority of sites at which they will be discharging into waters of the United \nStates. \n170.  The ACHP wrote to the Corps on May 6, 2016 to share the concern that Tribes like \nthe Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe have not had the opportunity to share relevant information “in the \nvicinity of water crossings and within the project [right-of-way] that the applicant assumes will \nnot require PCNs under General Conditions 20 and 31 [standards for PCNs] of the NWP \nprotocols.” \n171.  Issuance of NWP 12 is a “final agency action” within the meaning of the APA. \n42 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 43 of 59\n172.  The Corps’ delegation of its § 106 responsibilities to private parties in NWP 12 and \nGC 20 is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law in violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706. \nIII.  THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \n \nFAILURE TO REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF  \nINDIRECT EFFECTS UNDER § 106 \n \n173.  Intervenor-Plaintiff reincorporates the allegations in all preceding paragraphs. \n174.  Under NHPA, federal agencies must consult on the effects of “undertakings” to \nhistoric properties.  An undertaking is defined by rule to mean “a project, activity, or program \nfunded in whole or in part under the direct or indirect jurisdiction of a Federal agency, including \nthose carried out by or on behalf of a federal agency, those carried out with Federal financial \nassistance, and those requiring a federal permit, license or approval.”  36 C.F.R. § 800.16(y) \n(emphasis added). \n175.  The entirety of a private pipeline project that requires Corps’ authorization for \nhundreds if not thousands of discharges into waters of the United States is an “undertaking” for \npurposes of § 106 because it requires federal approval in order to occur and because it is under the \n“indirect jurisdiction” of the Corps. \n176.  GC 20 directs permittees to file a PCN with the Corps if the authorized activity will \nhave the potential to cause effects to historic properties.  However, the Corps directs permittees to \nonly consider the direct effects of activities in jurisdictional waters, and not indirect impacts such \nas construction impacts in uplands. \n177.  ACHP regulations require consideration of indirect effects of agency undertakings, \nincluding areas in uplands outside of Corps jurisdiction.  With respect to DAPL, in a May 19, 2016 \nletter, the ACHP confirmed that the entire 1,168-mile crude oil pipeline is the “undertaking” for \npurposes of § 106 consultation, and accused the Corps of “not differentiating appropriately \n43 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 44 of 59\nbetween federal action and the undertaking . . . .”  The ACHP concluded that “the Corps’ effects \ndeterminations, thus far, fail to consider the potential for effects from the larger undertaking on \nhistoric properties including those of cultural and religious significance to Indian Tribes.” \n178.  Issuance of NWP 12 is a “final agency action” within the meaning of the APA. \n179.  As applied to DAPL, the authorization to discharge into waters of the United States, \nwithout consideration of indirect impacts on historic sites as required by § 106, is arbitrary, \ncapricious, and contrary to law in violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706. \nIV.  FOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \nVIOLATIONS OF NATIONAL HISTORIC PRESERVATION ACT WITH \nRESPECT TO JULY 25, 2016 VERIFICATIONS AND § 408 PERMITS \n \n180.  Intervenor-Plaintiff reincorporates the allegations in all preceding paragraphs. \nA.  Incorrect Definition of “Area of Potential Effects” \n181.  Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (“NHPA”) requires that, prior \nto issuance of a federal permit or license, that federal agencies shall take into consideration the \neffects of that “undertaking” on historic properties.  54 U.S.C. § 306108.  Issuance of § 408 permits \nand CWA/RHA verifications under NWP 12 are federal undertakings within the meaning of the \nNHPA. \n182.  Early in the NHPA process, an agency, in consultation with the THPO, must \ndetermine the area of potential effects (“APE”) of a federal undertaking.  36 C.F.R. § 800.4(1)(1).  \nThe APE is defined by regulation to include the area “within which an undertaking may directly \nor indirectly cause alterations in the character or use of historic properties . . . .  The [APE] is \ninfluenced by the scale and nature of an undertaking and may be different for different kinds of \neffects caused by the undertaking.”  Id. § 800.16(d). \n44 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 45 of 59\n183.  The Corps defined the APE for the Lake Oahe crossing unlawfully narrowly, and \ninconsistently with both the ACHP regulations and its own guidance. \n184.  The APE for the crossing includes only a tiny parcel immediately surrounding the \nHDD pits on each side of the river and a narrow strip for an access road and “stringing area” on \nthe west side of the crossing.  On the east side of the river, the APE is difficult to determine because \nin some of the Corps’ figures, the “project workspace” includes both the access road and stringing \narea, while in others only the HDD pit is included. \n185.  The Corps unlawfully omits the actual pipeline route that will be entering and \nexiting the HDD borehole from the APE.  Pipeline construction would involve a 100-150 yard \nswath of industrial development—clearing, grading, excavation of a 6 to 10 foot trench, and \nconstruction work to shape and place the pipeline.  Such development would destroy any historic \nor culturally significant sites in its path.  But because these sites are outside the APE, the Corps’ \nconclusion does not consider them. \n186.  The pipeline path should be in the APE because, even where the Corps lacks direct \npermitting jurisdiction over segments in between regulatory areas, pipeline construction in such \nareas is an indirect effect of the HDD process.  Id. § 800.16(d). \n187.  The Corps’ failure to consider the impacts to historic and sacred sites outside of the \nimmediate and narrow confines of the HDD drilling sites was arbitrary, capricious, and not in \naccordance with law in violation of the APA and the NHPA. \nB.  Inadequate § 106 Consultation \n \n188.  The  Section  106  process  requires  consultation  with  Indian  Tribes  on  federal \nundertakings that potentially affect sites that are sacred or culturally significant to Indian tribes.  \n36 C.F.R. § 800.2(c)(2).  Consultation must occur regarding sites with “religious and cultural \n45 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 46 of 59\nsignificance” even if they occur on ancestral or ceded land.  Id. § 800.2(c)(2)(II)(D); 54 U.S.C. § \n302707. \n189.  Under the consultation regulations, an agency official must “ensure” that the \nprocess provides Tribes with “a reasonable opportunity to identify its concerns about historic \nproperties, advise on the identification and evaluation of historic properties . . . articulate its views \non the undertaking’s effects on such properties, and participate in the resolution of adverse effects.”  \nId. § 800.2(c)(ii)(A).  This requirement imposes a “reasonable and good faith effort” by agencies \nto consult with Tribes in a “manner respectful of tribal sovereignty.”  Id. § 800.2(c)(2)(II)(B). \n190.  The  Corps’  final  permit  decision  is  the  product  of  a  fundamentally  flawed \nconsultation process that does not meet the requirements of the ACHP regulations. \n191.  Consultation never occurred at all on the bore hole testing.  The Tribe was notified \nand the work was done before the Tribe’s serious concerns were even received by the Corps. \n192.  Consultation did not start at the earliest phases of the process.  Consultation did not \noccur on the “area of potential affects.”  Consultation did not occur on participation in the surveys \nor protocols for how they should be conducted.  36 C.F.R. § 800(c)(2)(II)(A). \n193.  Instead, the THPO was given a brief window to “comment” on the proponents’ \ndeeply flawed and completed surveys long after the route had been selected and construction \nscheduled. \n194.  The  Corps’  April  22,  2016  “no  effect”  determination  contains  citations  to \ndocuments, like “Landt & McCord, 2016,” that have never been provided to the Tribe. \n195.  The Tribe acted promptly and repeatedly to draw the Corps’ attention to its serious \nconcerns.   \n46 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 47 of 59\n196.  Information  was  not  sought  from  the  Tribe  in  determining  the  scope  of  its \nidentification efforts, as required by 36 C.F.R. § 800.4(a), nor was the Tribe given a meaningful \nopportunity to assist the Corps in the identification of this culturally rich but largely unassessed \nsite.  Id. § 800.4(b). \n197.  The Cheyenne River THPO formally objected to the Corps’ finding of no historic \nproperties affected on May 19, 2016.  Although the regulations required the Corps to either consult \nwith the objecting party to resolve the disagreement, or request action by the ACHP, neither of \nthose things have ever happened.  36 C.F.R. § 800.4(d)(1)(ii). \n198.  The ACHP formally objected to the Corps’ findings of no historic properties \naffected on May 19, 2016.  Under ACHP regulations, such an objection must be taken into account \nby the Corps prior to reaching a final decision, and the Corps must prepare a summary of the \ndecision and its rationale, along with evidence of consideration of the ACHP’s objection.  36 \nC.F.R. § 800.4(d)(1)(iv). \n199.  There are significant unevaluated properties in and near the Lake Oahe crossing \nwork site, as well as the broader pipeline route.  Some sites deemed “ineligible” by DAPL’s private \nsurveys may in fact be eligible.  Some sites deemed unevaluated have in fact been evaluated and \nare potentially eligible. \n200.  The Corps’ decision on the Lake Oahe crossing was arbitrary, capricious, and not \nin accordance with law in violation of the APA and the NHPA. \nC.  No § 106 Consultation for Verifications \n \n201.  The Corps’ NWP general conditions require completion of the § 106 process for \nNWP permit verifications and before work can begin.  The proponent must present a PCN to the \nCorps wherever an activity “may have the potential to cause effects to any historic properties listed \n47 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 48 of 59\non, determined to be eligible for listing on, or potentially eligible for listing” on the National \nRegister.  77 Fed. Reg. 10184, 10284 (Feb, 21, 2012). \n202.  The Corps has never consulted with the Tribe on issuance of verifications in its \nancestral lands, which span the length of the pipeline.  The Tribe is unaware of any formal § 106 \nfindings for verifications outside of the two sites in North Dakota. \n203.  The Corps’ decision that § 106 consultation had been completed on the 204 CWA \nverifications was arbitrary, capricious, and not in accordance with law in violation of the APA and \nthe NHPA. \nV.  FIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \nVIOLATIONS OF NEPA WITH RESPECT TO  \nJULY 25, 2016 VERIFICATIONS AND § 408 PERMITS \n \n204.  Intervenor-Plaintiff  hereby  alleges  and  incorporates  and  restates  all  previous \nparagraphs of this complaint. \nA.  Failure to Consider Indirect Effects of Missouri River Crossings \n \n205.  NEPA requires consideration of indirect effects of agency decision.  The Corps \nmisapplied these legal standards in the final North Dakota EA.  It looked narrowly at the impacts \nof the river crossings themselves, and did not disclose or consider the impacts of other components \nof the pipeline, either related to its construction or its operation to transport 570,000 barrels a day \nof crude oil over nearly 1,200 miles. \n206.  Pipeline construction is an indirect impact of the Corps § 408 permits because it is \nproximately caused by the Corps’ decision.  Without the ability to cross the Missouri River, the \npipeline could not be built.  Pipeline construction is a reasonably foreseeable outcome of the Corps’ \ndecision. \n48 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 49 of 59\n207.  Alternatively, pipeline construction could be considered an indirect effect of the \nCorps’ § 408 permit because it is a future action that is reasonably certain to occur as long as \nDAPL receives Corps’ authorization at the Missouri River crossings. \n208.  The Corps failure to consider and disclose the impacts of the pipeline’s construction \nand operation is arbitrary and capricious and not in accordance with law in violation of the APA \nand NEPA. \nB.  Unlawful Segmentation of Project Components \n \n209.  NEPA requires consideration of separate components of a single project in a single \nNEPA review.  40 C.F.R. § 1508.25.  NEPA regulations state that connected actions should be \nconsidered in a single EIS, defining them as action that “cannot or will not proceed unless other \nactions are taken previously or simultaneously,” and “are interdependent parts of a larger action \nand depend on the larger action for their justification.”  Id. \n210.  The Corps’ permitting regulations also require it to reject applications that seek to \nsegment a single project into multiple permits.  33 C.F.R. § 325.1(c)(2) (“All activities which the \napplicant plans to undertake which are reasonable related to the same project and for which a DA \npermit would be required should be included in the same permit application.”). \n211.  The Corps has not adhered to these requirements, despite having them pointed out \nto them by the Tribe, multiple federal agencies, and others.  Rather, it unlawfully segmented its \nNEPA review into separate components in North Dakota and in Illinois, each of which is \nproceeding independent of the other. \n212.  Moreover, the FWS issued its own EA and FONSI for a component of this pipeline \nproject.  That EA and FONSI did not evaluate the impacts of the FWS decision in the context of \nthe Corps permits or the larger project which it was a part of. \n49 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 50 of 59\n213.  The Illinois § 408 permit, the North Dakota § 408 permit, and the FWS grassland \neasements, are connected actions because they meet the criteria in 40 C.F.R. § 1508.25.  NEPA \nrequires them to be considered in a single NEPA document.  They were not. \n214.  By unlawfully segmenting multiple components of the same pipeline project, the \nCorps has acted in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, and not in accordance with law, in \nviolation of NEPA and the APA. \nC.  Arbitrary Economic Analysis \n \n215.  NEPA  and  its  implementing  regulations  require  the  Corps  to  produce \nenvironmental  review  documents  that  are  factually  accurate,  well  supported,  and  that  fully \ndiscloses the impacts of an action to the public.  40 C.F.R. § 1502. \n216.  These standards apply equally to an agency’s treatment of economic data.  40 \nC.F.R. §§ 1502.23 (cost benefit analysis), 1508.8 (EIS must evaluate economic effects).  An \nagency’s failure to include and analyze information that is important, significant, or essential \nrenders an EA and FONSI inadequate.  40 C.F.R. § 1500.1.  These fundamental NEPA principles \napply to both economic and environmental analyses in an EIS.  40 C.F.R. §§ 1502.24, 1508.8 \n(“effects” in an EIS must evaluate include economic impacts.). \n217.  In reaching its decision on the North Dakota crossings, the Corps looked very \nnarrowly at only two tiny segments of the pipeline, ignoring the environmental and economic risks \nand harms of the pipeline as a whole. \n218.  However, it balanced these narrow risks and harms against the full economic \nbenefit of the pipeline as a whole.  For example, the EA cites the full $3.78 billion investment \n“directly  impacting  the  local,  regional,  and  national  labor  force  by  creating  nearly  12,000 \nconstruction jobs.”  Final EA, at 80.  It repeats DAPL’s public talking points about providing \n50 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 51 of 59\n“considerable labor income and state income tax revenue—including the generation of more than \n$13.4 million in ad valorem taxes.”  Id. \n219.  The Corps’ decision to balance the full economic benefits of building and operating \nthe entire pipeline against the economic risks of constructing tiny segments of that pipeline is \narbitrary and capricious and not in accordance with law, in violation of NEPA and the APA. \nVI.  SIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \nVIOLATIONS OF THE CLEAN WATER ACT AND RIVERS AND HARBORS \nACT WITH RESPECT TO JULY 25, 2016  \nVERIFICATIONS AND § 408 PERMITS \n \n220.  Intervenor-Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs. \nA.  Arbitrary and Inadequate Public Interest Review for North Dakota Permits \n \n221.  Prior to issuance of a § 408 permit, or any other CWA/RHA permit, the Corps is \nrequired to conduct a “public interest” review consistent with its governing regulations, 33 C.F.R. \n§ 320.4(a). \n222.  In conducting a public interest review, the Corps must consider the probable \nimpacts of the proposed action, and weigh “all those factors which become relevant.”  Id.  The \nCorps must balance the benefits “which reasonably may be expected to accrue” from the action \nagainst the “reasonably foreseeable detriments.”  Id.  “All factors” which may be relevant to the \nproposal must be considered, including the extent of the public and private need for the proposal, \nand the existence of unresolved conflicts around resource use.  The District Engineer is authorized \nto make an “independent review of the need for the project from the perspective of the overall \npublic interest.”  Id. § 320.4(q). \n223.  The Corps’ did not conduct a valid public interest review of the § 408 authorizations \nin North Dakota.  To the extent it conducted any public interest review at all, it suffered from all \nof the same flaws as the NEPA review identified above.  Specifically, the Corps conducted an \n51 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 52 of 59\narbitrary and segmented approach that ignored virtually all of the indirect effects of its decision, \nspecifically, the construction and operation of the pipeline itself; and it conducted an arbitrary and \none-sided economic balance in which the benefits of the entire $4 billion pipeline were weighed \nagainst the impacts of tiny segments of the pipeline. \n224.  By failing to undertake a lawful and adequate public interest review of the actions \nproposed in its § 408 decision, the Corps has acted in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, and \nnot in accordance with law, in violation of the CWA and the APA. \nB.  Unlawful Verification For Lake Oahe Crossing \n \n225.  In addition to a § 408 permit, the portion of the pipeline that crosses under Lake \nOahe requires a Rivers and Harbors Act § 10 permit.  33 C.F.R. § 322.3(a). \n226.  On July 25, 2016, the Corps issued verification that the Lake Oahe pipeline crossing \ncomplied with the conditions of NWP 12, and hence was authorized under § 10 of the Rivers and \nHarbors Act. \n227.  In order to “qualify” for NWP authorization, proposals must meet a number of \ngeneral conditions.  77 Fed. Reg. 10184, 10282 (Feb. 21, 2012). \n228.  The Lake Oahe crossing does not comply with these conditions and, accordingly, \ndoes not “qualify” for NWP 12.  See also 33 C.F.R. § 330.6(a)(2)  (“If the [Army Corps] decides \nthat an activity does not comply with the terms or conditions of an NWP, he will notify the person \ndesiring to do the work and instruct him on the procedures to seek authorization under a regional \ngeneral permit or individual permit.”). \n229.  General Condition 7 states that no activity may be authorized under a NWP that is \nin “proximity” to public water supplies.  77 Fed. Reg. at 10283.  The Lake Oahe crossing is in \n52 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 53 of 59\nclose proximity to the Tribe’s source of drinking water for a significant portion of the reservation \ncommunity. \n230.  The potential impact on drinking water for the Cheyenne River and many other \ntribes and communities has also been emphasized by the Environmental Protection Agency and \nthe U.S. Department of Interior, as well as the Tribal government and many of its members. \n231.  Further, General Condition 17 states that no activity authorized by a NWP may \n“impair tribal rights” including “reserved water rights.”  77 Fed. Reg. at 10283.  DAPL is routed \njust upstream of the Tribe’s reservation boundary, where any oil spill would have devastating \neffects within the reservation.  The Reservation necessarily includes the protection of adequate \nwater quality.  The Lake Oahe crossing does not “qualify” for a NWP 12 because of the risks to \nTribal resources protected by treaty. \n232.  The Corps’ decision to verify that the Lake Oahe crossing was consistent with NWP \n12 was arbitrary, capricious and not in accordance with law, in violation of the APA. \nC.  Issuance of Verifications for 204 Jurisdictional Waters \n \n233.  Under the Corps’ regulations, a single project can only proceed under both an NWP \nand an individual permit where the “portions qualifying for NWP authorization would have \nindependent utility and are able to function or meet their purpose independent of the total project.”  \n33 C.F.R. § 330.6(d). \n234.  For the reasons discussed immediately above, the Lake Oahe crossing requires an \nindividual permit.  Moreover, § 408 authorizations are individual “permits” within the meaning of \nthis regulation.  See id., § 320.2(e); § 320.4 (general policies applicable to “all” Army permits). \n53 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 54 of 59\n235.  No component of DAPL has “independent utility” or the “ability to function” \nwithout the other components of the pipeline.  As a result of this, the Corps cannot authorize some \nportions of DAPL under NWP 12, and other portions as individual permits. \n236.  Because the Lake Oahe crossing requires an individual permit, no other component \nof the pipeline can be authorized under NWP 12. \n237.  Issuance of a verification by the Corps constitutes a final agency action within the \nmeaning of the APA. \n238.  The Corps’ verification of 204 additional crossings of jurisdictional waters was \narbitrary and capricious and not in accordance with law, in violation of the APA and the CWA. \nVII.  SEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \nBREACH OF TRUST RESPONSIBILITY \n \n239.  Intervenor-Plaintiff reincorporates the allegations in all preceding paragraphs. \n240.  The Tribe has a vested property right in the waters of Lake Oahe, which is held in \ntrust for us by the United States. \n241.  The Act of March 2, 1889, the 1868 Sioux Nation Treaty, 15 Stat. 635, and the Fort \nLaramie Treaty of 1851, 11 Stat. 749 , which reserved to the Tribe its right in the waters of Lake \nOahe, include a right to clean, safe water to sustain the a livable permanent homeland and self-\nsufficiency for the Tribe and its people. \n242.  The  United  States  and  the  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  have  a  specific  trust \nresponsibility to manage and protect the trust property on behalf of the Tribe based generally in \nthe Treaties and statutes governing the Tribe and its reservation and the general federal trust \ndoctrine as well as specifically in the Flood Control Act of 1944, P.L. 83-777. \n54 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 55 of 59\n243.  The United States’ and the Corps’ trust responsibility to protect and manage the \ntrust property can be exercised, in part, by engaging in government-to-government consultation \nwith tribes on actions that could impair tribal trust resources or tribal rights.   Department of \nDefense Instruction 4710.02 (Sept. 14, 2006). \n244.  The authorizations and verifications the Corps issued to Dakota Access on July 25, \n2016 pursuant to § 408 of the CWA and § 10 of the RHA, authorizing construction of the oil \npipeline under Lake Oahe was a final agency action for purposes of the APA. \n245.  The Corps’ issuance authorizations and verifications to Dakota Access on July 25, \n2016 pursuant to § 408 of the CWA and § 10 of the RHA, without any consultation with the \nCheyenne River Sioux Tribe regarding the impact on the trust property and without a full EIS to \naddress concerns about the safety of the Tribe’s water was arbitrary and capricious as it breached \nthe Corps’ trust responsibility to the Tribe. \nVIII.  EIGHTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \nVIOLATION OF FLOOD CONTROL ACT \n \n246.  Intervenor-Plaintiff reincorporates the allegations in all preceding paragraphs. \n247.  The authorizations and verifications the Corps issued to Dakota Access on July 25, \n2016 pursuant to § 408 of the CWA and § 10 of the RHA, authorizing construction of the oil \npipeline under Lake Oahe was a final agency action for purposes of the APA. \n248.  The Corps’ issuance authorizations and verifications to Dakota Access on July 25, \n2016 pursuant to § 408 of the CWA and § 10 of the RHA was arbitrary and capricious as it has \nviolates § 1(b) of the Flood Control Act of 1944, P.L. 83-777 by prioritizing discharges into Lake \nOahe and construction and operation of the oil pipeline over the beneficial consumptive uses \nenumerated in the Act. \n55 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 56 of 59\nIX.  NINTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nFAILURE TO PROMULGATE REGULATIONS \n \n149.  Intervenor-Plaintiff reincorporates the allegations in all preceding paragraphs. \n150.  The Mineral and Leasing Act imposes a mandatory duty that rights-of-way or \npermits  granted  or  renewed  pursuant  to  30  U.S.C.  §  185  shall  be  subject  to  promulgated \nregulations.  \n151.  The relevant section is set forth in 30 U.S.C. §185(f). \n152.  The Corps has not promulgated any regulations or final rule regarding the grant of \nrights-of-way or permits granted or renewed pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act. \n153.  The APA requires promulgated rulemaking by agencies after the public receives \nnotice and an opportunity to comment. \n154.  The Corps’ failure to promulgate was arbitrary and capricious.  \n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \nWHEREFORE, Intervenor-Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court grant the following \nrelief: \n1.  Declare that NWP 12 is invalid as applied to DAPL because the Corps failed to \ncomply with § 106 at the time of its issuance, in violation of the NHPA. \n2.  Declare that NWP 12 is invalid as applied to DAPL because the Corps unlawfully \ndelegated its responsibility to comply with § 106 to private parties, effectively allowing discharge \ninto waters of the United States without any consideration of impacts to historic properties, in \nviolation of the NHPA. \n56 \n \n\n \nC ase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 37   Filed 09/08/16   Page 57 of 59\n3.  Declare that NWP 12 is invalid as applied to DAPL because the Corps authorized \ndischarge into waters of the United States without consideration of indirect impacts on historic \nsites, in violation of the NHPA. \n4.  Declare  that  the  July  25,  2016  authorizations  and  verifications  are  arbitrary, \ncapricious, in violation of the NHPA, NEPA, CWA and RHA, and implementing regulations, and \nin violation of the Corps’ trust responsibility to the Tribe. \n5.  Vacate NWP 12 as applied to DAPL. \n \n6.  Enjoin the Corps to direct DAPL to seek either an individual permit covering all \ndischarges along the entire pipeline route, or submit PCNs for all impacts to waters of the United \nStates, and fully comply with § 106 prior to finalizing such permit or verifications. \n7.  Vacate the final EA and FONSI. \n \n8.  Enjoin the Corps and direct it to withdraw its permits as improvidently granted, to \nrequire an EIS, and to assess the protection of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe’s treaty and trust \nprotected property that is the Tribe’s water rights in Lake Oahe, a Reservoir of the Missouri River. \n9.  Declare that the Corps violated the MLA for failure to promulgate regulations in \naccordance with the MLA.   \n10.  Enjoin the Corps and direct it to vacate any rights-of-way on lands with the Corps’ \njurisdiction granted in violation of the MLA. \n11.  Retain jurisdiction over this matter to ensure that the Corps complies with the law. \n \n12.  Award Intervenor-Plaintiff its reasonable fees, costs, expenses, and disbursements, \nincluding attorneys’ fees, associated with this litigation; and \n13.

This supplemental complaint challenges the decision of the United States Army \nCorps of Engineers (“Corps”), issued in a Memorandum for Record dated August 31, 2018 (Doc. \n362-1), following a remand in this case, reaffirming earlier decisions approving the construction \nand operation of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) across Lake Oahe.  In the Memorandum \nfor Record, the Corps erroneously found that (1) the potential impacts of an oil spill on hunting \nand fishing resources did not reveal any significant impacts, (2) approval of the DAPL crossing \nat Lake Oahe does not result in disproportionately high and adverse human health or \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 377-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 2 of 14\n \n \n \nenvironmental effects on minority populations, and (3) no substantial dispute exists as to the size, \nnature and effect of the environmental action. The Corps concluded that its July 2016 Final \nEnvironmental Assessment (Final EA) and Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) need not \nbe reconsidered, and that the preparation of supplemental documentation pursuant to the \nNational Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) was not required.  This decision, together with the \nCorps’ earlier decisions approving the DAPL crossing at Lake Oahe, violates NEPA and the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA), as well as the Tribe’s Treaty rights and rights under the \nMni Wiconi Project Act and the Mineral Leasing Act (MLA).  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n  2.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because it arises under the \nConstitution, laws, and treaties of the United States, including but not limited to the Treaty of \nFort Laramie, 11 Stat. 749 (Sep. 17, 1851); the 1868 Sioux Nation Treaty, 15 Stat. 635 (Apr. 29, \n1868); NEPA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321–4370f; the Mineral Leasing Act, 30 U.S.C. §§ 181 et seq.; the \nMni Wiconi Project Act of 1988, 102 Stat. 2566 (Oct. 24, 1988), as amended1 (Mni Wiconi \nProject Act); the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq., which authorizes the Court to “hold unlawful and \nset aside” agency action that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law” or “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity,” 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A)–(B); 28 U.S.C. § 1362 (“district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all \ncivil actions, brought by any Indian Tribe or band with a governing body duly recognized by the \nSecretary of the Interior, wherein the matter in controversy arises under the Constitution, laws, or \ntreaties of the United States”); 28 U.S.C. § 2201 (declaratory relief); and 28 U.S.C. § 2202 \n(“necessary or proper relief based on a declaratory judgment”).   \n                                                           \n1 Pub. L. 103-434 (October 21, 1994); Pub. L. 105-277 (October 21, 1998); Pub. L. 106-53 (August 17, \n1999); Pub. L. 107-367 (December 2, 2002); and Pub.

Venue in the District of Columbia is appropriate under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) \nbecause this is an action in which the Defendant is an agency of the United States and a \nsubstantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred within this judicial \ndistrict. \nPARTIES \n  4.  Plaintiff Oglala Sioux Tribe is an Indian Nation that is part of the Oceti Sakowin \n(the Seven Council Fires), which is also known as the Great Sioux Nation.  The Tribe is federally \nrecognized and maintains a government-to-government relationship with the United States of \nAmerica.  The Oglala Sioux Tribe is a party to the 1851 Fort Laramie Treaty, 11 Stat. 749, and \nthe 1868 Sioux Nation Treaty, 15 Stat. 635.  The DAPL runs through lands that are the Oglala \nSioux Tribe’s aboriginal territory as well as its ancestral Treaty lands.  The Oglala Sioux Tribe, \nalong with its sister Sioux Tribes, has rights to the water in the Missouri River based on the 1851 \nand 1868 Treaties.  The Oglala Sioux Tribe operates the Oglala Sioux Rural Water Supply \nSystem, a part of the Mni Wiconi (meaning “Water is Life”) Project, which provides drinking \nwater to the Pine Ridge (Oglala Sioux Tribe) Indian Reservation as well as to the Rosebud Sioux \nReservation, Lower Brule Sioux Reservation, and the non-Indian West River/Lyman Jones \nWater District.  The Mni Wiconi Project draws its water from the Missouri River downstream \nfrom the DAPL crossing. \n  5.  Defendant U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is an agency in the Executive Branch of \nthe Federal government and a division of the Department of the Army.  It is charged with \nregulating any dredging and filling of the waters of the United States under § 404 of the Clean \nWater Act and § 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act.  It also has the authority to issue rights-of-\n3 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 377-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 4 of 14\n \n \n \nway or easements for pipeline purposes for the transportation of oil through federal land over \nwhich it has jurisdiction under the Mineral Leasing Act.  30 U.S.C. § 185.  \n  6.  Intervenor-Defendant Dakota Access, LLC is a limited liability company formed \nto construct and own Dakota Access Pipeline.  The beneficial owners of Dakota Access, LLC \n(Dakota Access) are Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. (ETP), Sunoco Logistics Partners, L.P., \nEnergy Transfer Equity, which recently purchased ETP, and Phillips 66. \nSUPPLEMENTAL FACTS \n  7.  Plaintiff Oglala Sioux Tribe initially filed a complaint challenging the Corps’ \napproval of the DAPL crossing on February 11, 2017, three days after the Corps granted the \neasement at Lake Oahe to Dakota Access, LLC. (case no. 17-cv-00267) That case was later \nconsolidated with this case which was brought by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, and in which \nCheyenne River Sioux Tribe had intervened.  The Court granted Dakota Access leave to \nintervene as Defendant in the Oglala case.   \n  8.  On June 14, 2017, this Court decided motions for partial summary judgment as to \nenvironmental impact claims brought by plaintiffs Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and Cheyenne \nRiver Sioux Tribe.  Doc. 239.  Although the Court upheld some of the Corps’ environmental \nanalysis, it determined that the Corps’ analysis of three specific issues was arbitrary, capricious, \nand in violation of NEPA.  First, the Court held that the Corps had failed to address the \nsignificant scientific “controversy” around its dismissal of oil spill risk and impacts by not \naddressing expert reports submitted by the Oglala Sioux Tribe, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, \nand the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe before the easement was granted.  In addition, the Court \nruled that the Corps failed to adequately analyze the impacts of an oil spill on the Standing Rock \nSioux Tribe’s treaty hunting and fishing rights, and that the Corps’ consideration of \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 377-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 5 of 14\n \n \n \nenvironmental justice implications of the permit was flawed.  The Court remanded the analysis \nback to the Corps for further consideration in light of its decision. \n  9.  During the remand, the Corps received various submittals from Dakota Access or \nETP.  Although the Oglala Sioux Tribe requested that information provided by Dakota Access \nrelating to the remand be provided to the Tribe, none was provided, and the Tribe had no \nopportunity to review or comment on any information provided by Dakota Access or generated \nby the Corps during the remand.   \n  10.  During the remand, ETP publicly announced its intention to expand the capacity \nof DAPL by 100,000 barrels a day.  On information and belief, expansion could take place \nwithout additional Corps authorization at Lake Oahe.  A significant increase in operation volume \nwould render obsolete much of the spill risk and impact analysis and emergency response \nplanning conducted by Dakota Access, ETP, and/or the Corps to date. \n11.  The Corps concluded the remand process with the issuance of the Memorandum \nfor Record dated August 31, 2018 (Doc. 362-1), in which the Corps concluded that there was no \nneed to formally reconsider its July 2016 Final EA, or to perform further NEPA studies, and that \nan EIS was not necessary.  The Memorandum for Record briefly addressed the three flaws in its \nenvironmental analyses which the Court directed the Corps to review on remand.  As to tribal \nhunting and fishing Treaty rights, the Corps concluded that they would not be impacted “because \nthe risk of an incident is low and any impacts to hunting and fishing resources [sic] will be of \nlimited scope and duration.”  As to the issue of environmental justice, the Corps concluded that \nthe Oahe crossing “does not result in disproportionately high and adverse human health or \nenvironmental effects on minority populations, including Tribes, and low-income populations.”  \nFinally, as to the issue of whether the Corps conclusions were likely to be “highly controversial,” \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 377-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 6 of 14\n \n \n \nthe Corps incorrectly characterized information provided by the Oglala Sioux Tribe and other \ntribal plaintiffs as simply being opposed to the pipeline authorizations, stating that the Tribes did \nnot “provide information that a substantial dispute exists as to the size, nature or effect of the \nfederal action.” \n  12.  The Memorandum of Record stated that the rationale supporting these findings \nwas contained in the “enclosed document” and in the administrative record, but no document \nwas enclosed or provided to the Tribe or the Court on August 31.  On October 9, 2018, \nundersigned counsel were provided with a copy of the enclosed analysis supporting the remand \ndecision (“Remand Analysis”), which was subject to confidentiality restrictions pending \nagreement of the parties or Court decision on protected information contained therein.  On \nOctober 24, 2018, after all parties reached agreement as to what information was subject to the \nProtective Order in this case, a redacted version of the Remand Analysis was made available for \nthe public. \n  13.  Although the Oglala Sioux Tribe has been provided a copy of the Remand \nAnalysis, it has not been provided copies of any other materials contained in the administrative \nrecord. The Remand Analysis relies extensively upon two documents that have not been \nprovided—the “Spill Model Report,” a technical document describing the results of various oil \nspill scenarios, and the “Downstream Receptor Report,” a technical document assessing rate and \ntransport of spilled crude.  The Oglala Sioux Tribe therefore reserves its right to challenge the \nanalyses in those documents and the Corps’ reliance on them once provided in this litigation. \n  14.  Even without access to the underlying studies relied upon, it is plain that the \nRemand Analysis itself is highly flawed.  For instance, in addressing the highly controversial \nintensity issue, the Remand Analysis unsuccessfully attempted to dismiss or refute the study \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 377-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 7 of 14\n \n \n \nsubmitted by Earthfax Engineering Group, LLC (EarthFax) on behalf of the Oglala Sioux Tribe. \nThe Corps’ effort in this regard fell far short. As one example, the Remand Analysis justifies the \nFinal EA’s worst case scenario focus on benzene alone, ignoring other constituents of crude oil. \nIn doing so, the Remand Analysis relies in part on a study identified only as “(O’Reilly 2001)” \nthat cannot be located, even while admitting “that benzene is volatile and that other hydrocarbon \ncomponents are present and responsible for impacts beyond benzene.”  The Remand Analysis, \nlike the EA, thus fails to adequately address whether a worst case spill would present a \nsignificant risk to drinking water.  \n15.  Like the Final EA, the Remand Analysis failed to provide a lawfully adequate \n“worst case spill” (WCD).  In the Remand Analysis, the Corps fails to address the impact of \ncircumstances listed in the definition of WCD in 49 C.F.R. § 194.5, including adverse weather \nconditions.  The WCD also fails to correctly implement the formula required by 49 C.F.R. § \n194.105(b)(1), including consideration of the operators’ “historic discharge[s]” and relies on \nunrealistic shutdown times that bear little resemblance to multiple real-world pipeline incidents.  \nFurthermore, the WCD calculation fails to take into account Dakota Access’s parent companies’ \nabysmal safety record, as required by the regulation. \n16.  As another example of a serious flaw, the Remand Analysis errs in finding no \nsignificant impact to tribal hunting and fishing rights, despite its findings in Table I-7 that predict \n100% mortality to aquatic biota in the event of a spill.  The table shows, for example, that, \ndepending on various factors, a spill from the ND-380 valve located just west of the Lake Oahe \ncrossing could result in 100% mortality to sensitive aquatic species over an area of up to 74.7 \nsquare kilometers (28.8 mi2 or 18,400 acres).  The predicted extent of this mortality impact area \nis substantially higher than estimated by the Final EA and contradicts the Final EA, which, as \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 377-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 8 of 14\n \n \n \nnoted in the Remand Analysis, concluded that “under the conservative assumptions, a large oil \nspill over 10,000 barrels would still not result in sufficient benzene concentrations large enough \nto surpass the acute toxicity threshold for aquatic organisms.” The Remand Analysis also \nacknowledges that ingestion of contaminated fish could create human health issues. \n17.  Unlike the Final EA, which never addressed the Mni Wiconi intake serving the \nOglala Sioux Tribe, the Remand Analysis does address it, but it assumes that there would be no \nimpact to the intake because of its location south of the Oahe Dam, and the depth of the dam’s \ndischarge pipes.  The Remand Analysis predicts there will be no hydrocarbons that flow through \nthe discharge pipes in the event of a spill.  This assumption is incorrect for many reasons, \nincluding the erroneous WCD calculation, and because the Corps relied upon a 10-day spill \nmodel, although a spill would take longer to reach the dam. This assumption also fails to account \nfor the fact that even if spilled oil and the associated dissolved constituents may initially be \nconcentrated within the upper 10 meters of the Lake Oahe water column, it is likely that some of \nthe oil will combine with the suspended sediment in the water to form OPAs and sink within the \nwater column.  It also fails to account for the hydroelectric plant at the Oahe Dam which pulls \nwater from various depths and creates turbulence. In its 2010 Final Master Plan for Oahe Dam, \nthe Corps has noted that “[t]he area around the intakes is a good fishery because the turbulent \nwater attracts many species of fish.”  \n18.  The Remand Analysis also relies upon the Facility Response Plan (FRP) and the \nGeographic Response Plan (GRP). These plans, which address response to an oil spill, are \nthemselves flawed.  For example, they do not provide, either through on-site storage or by \ncontract, for sufficient containment boom or sorbent boom in the event of a spill at the Oahe \ncrossing. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 377-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 9 of 14\n \n \n \n  19.  The above examples are intended as illustrations of the flaws in the Corps’ \nanalysis, not a comprehensive list. \n20.  These and other fundamental flaws in the Corps’ estimate of the risk and impact \nof oils spills infect all three of the remand topics. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n(The Causes of Action in this Supplemental Complaint are numbered consecutively beginning \nwith VI, because the Oglala Sioux Tribe’s initial Complaint contains Counts I-V.) \nVI.  SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION: VIOLATION OF NEPA AND THE APA \n \n21.  Plaintiff reincorporates the allegations in all preceding paragraphs. \n22.  Under NEPA, federal agencies are required to prepare an EIS for “major Federal \nactions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.”  42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C).   \n23.  Binding Council of Environmental Quality (“CEQ”) regulations further define \nwhether impacts are “significant” enough to warrant a full EIS, requiring consideration of both \n“context” (i.e., the various scales, regions, and interests affected by the action) and “intensity” \n(i.e. the severity of the impact”).  40 C.F.R. § 1508.27.  With respect to the latter, the regulations \nlay out several factors that are to be considered.  Examples of these criteria include:  “the degree \nto which the proposed action affects public health or safety”; “unique characteristics of the \ngeographic area such as proximity to historic or cultural resources…”; the degree to which the \neffects on the environment “are likely to be highly controversial,” are “highly uncertain” or \n“involve unique or unknown risks”; and “the degree to which the action … may cause loss or \ndestruction of significant scientific, cultural, or historical resources.” Id. \n24.  Full and effective public participation in agency decision-making is a cornerstone \nof NEPA. Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 349 (1989) (NEPA \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 377-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 10 of 14\n \n \n \n“guarantees that the relevant information [concerning environmental impacts] will be made \navailable to the larger audience,” including the public, “that may also play a role in the \ndecisionmaking process and implementation of the decision.”); 40 C.F.R. § 1500.1(b) (“NEPA \nprocedures must insure that environmental information is available to public officials and \ncitizens before decisions are made and before actions are taken.”)  See also id. §1500.2 (d). \n25.  In June of 2017, the Court found “significant” flaws in the Army Corps’ analysis \nof the risk and impacts of its decision to authorize DAPL underneath Lake Oahe, and ordered the \nCorps to conduct a remand to give “serious consideration” to those flaws.   \n26.  By concluding the remand by affirming its original decision, the Corps acted \narbitrarily, capriciously, contrary to the evidence before it, and in violation of NEPA and the \nCEQ regulations and contrary to the APA.  The Corps also acted arbitrarily, capriciously, and in \nviolation of NEPA and the CEQ regulations by failing to meaningfully engage with the Tribe by \nproviding information so that the Tribe could provide input during the remand. \nVII.  SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION: VIOLATION OF MINERAL LEASING \nACT AND THE APA \n \n27.  Plaintiff reincorporates the allegations in all preceding paragraphs. \n28.  Section 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act (MLA), 30 U.S.C. § 185, known as Section \n185, provides federal agencies with the authority to grant rights-of-way over federal lands for \npipeline purposes, including for oil and natural gas pipelines.  Section 185 imposes specific \nenvironmental review and public hearing requirements, without altering the applicability of \nNEPA.  30 U.S.C. § 185(h)(1)–(2). \n29.  In its June 14, 2017 Memorandum Opinion, the Court reserved its decision on the \nCheyenne River Sioux Tribe’s MLA claim, pending the Corps’ analysis on remand as to the \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 377-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 11 of 14\n \n \n \nthree issues identified above. For the reasons explained above, the Corps’ decision on remand is \nflawed. \n30.  For these reasons, the Corps has acted in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, \nand not in accordance with law, in violation of the MLA and the APA.   \nVIII.  EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION: BREACH OF TREATY RIGHTS AND THE \nAPA \n \n31.  Plaintiff reincorporates the allegations in all preceding paragraphs. \n32.  The Oglala Sioux Tribe holds vested Treaty Rights in the waters of Lake Oahe \nand the Missouri River.   The Tribe enjoys reserved water rights to the waters in the Missouri \nRiver and its tributaries, including sufficient water to fulfill the purpose of the reservation to \nprovide for a permanent livable homeland.  The Tribe’s reserved waters rights “are vested \nproperty rights for which the United States has a trust responsibility, with the United States \nholding legal title to such water in trust for the benefit of the Indians.”  Notice, Department of the \nInterior, Working Group in Indian Water Settlements, Criteria and Procedures for the \nParticipation of the Federal Government in Negotiations for the Settlement of Indian Water \nRights Claims, 55 Fed. Reg. 9223, 9223 (Mar. 12, 1990). These rights include water rights, \nincluding the right to clean and safe drinking water.   \n33.  The Corps, by virtue of the Treaties, has a duty to consider the Tribe’s Treaty \nrights when taking actions, so as not to destroy or impair those rights, and to consult the Tribe \nwith regard to any action that may destroy or impair those rights, and to assess any such \nimpairment.   \n34.  In issuing the approvals for the DAPL crossing at Lake Oahe, and in reaffirming \nits decision following the remand, the Corps has acted in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, \nand not in accordance with law, in violation of its trust responsibility and the APA.   \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 377-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 12 of 14\n \n \n \nIX.  NINTH CAUSE OF ACTION: BREACH OF TRUST, MNI WICONI \nPROJECT ACT, AND THE APA \n \n35.  Plaintiff reincorporates the allegations in all preceding paragraphs. \n36.  The Mni Wiconi Project Act provides: “the United States has a trust responsibility \nto ensure that adequate and safe water supplies are available to meet the economic, \nenvironmental, water supply, and public health needs of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation….”  \nId. § 2(a).  Among the purposes of the Act are to “ensure a safe and adequate municipal, rural, \nand industrial water supply for the residents of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation….”  Id. §§ \n2(b)(1).  The United States holds the title to the Oglala Sioux Rural Water Supply System of the \nMni Wiconi Project in trust for the Tribe. Id. § 3(e).   \n37.  In issuing the approvals for the DAPL crossing at Lake Oahe, and in reaffirming \nits decision following the remand, the Corps has breached its trust obligations to the Tribe by \nfailing to ensure compliance with federal law in authorizations for the DAPL, which threaten the \nTribe’s rights in the Mni Wiconi Project. \n38.  For these reasons, the Corps has acted in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, \nand not in accordance with law, in violation of trust responsibility, the Mni Wiconi Project Act, \nand the APA.   \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests this Court grant the following relief:  \n1.  Declare that the Remand Analysis, and the underlying Final EA/FONSI, are inadequate \nbecause the Corps failed to conduct a full EIS that analyzed impacts to the Tribe’s \nTreaty-protected water rights and rights in the Mni Wiconi Project and failed to make a \nreasoned analysis of the risks and potential impacts of a spill; \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 377-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 13 of 14\n \n \n \n2.  Declare that the Corps has breached its trust responsibility to the Tribe by issuing a Final \nEA/FONSI without assessing impacts to the Tribe’s Treaty rights and rights in the Mni \nWiconi Project, and by reaffirming that decision in the Remand Analysis and \nMemorandum for Record; \n3.  Declare that the Corps has violated the Mineral Leasing Act by failing to fulfill its \nindependent environmental review requirements, and by not correcting such failure in the \nRemand Analysis and Memorandum for Record; \n4.  Vacate the Final EA/FONSI, and the Remand Analysis; \n5.  Enjoin the Corps and direct it to vacate the easement issued on February 8, 2017, and any \nrights-of-way for DAPL on lands within the Corps’ jurisdiction; \n6.  Enjoin the Corps from allowing Dakota Access to drill or transport oil under Lake Oahe \nuntil such time as a full EIS is completed that assesses impacts to the Tribe’s rights; \n7.  Retain jurisdiction over this matter to ensure that the Corps complies with the law; \n8.  Award Plaintiff its reasonable fees, costs, expenses, and disbursements, including \nattorney’s fees, associated with this litigation; and \n   \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 377-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 14 of 14\n \n \n \n9.

      "text": "Case 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 1 of 42\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n   \nSTANDING ROCK SIOUX TRIBE, et al., \n \n            Plaintiffs, \n  v.         Civil Action No. 16-1534 (JEB) \n   \nU.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS, et \nal., \n \nDefendants. \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nThe Court returns once more to the segment of the Dakota Access Pipeline running under \nthe Missouri River and to its effects on the Indian Tribes living nearby.  In February 2017, \nDefendant U.S. Army Corps of Engineers concluded that granting an easement for the crossing \nwould yield no significant environmental impact, thus exempting the agency from having to \nprepare an Environmental Impact Statement under the requirements of the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act.  In these consolidated cases, several Tribes whose reservations lie \nnear Lake Oahe challenge that decision. \nIn one of its many prior Opinions in this case, the Court held that the agency’s decision \n“not to issue an EIS largely complied with NEPA.”  Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army \nCorps of Eng’rs (Standing Rock III), 255 F. Supp. 3d 101, 147 (D.D.C. 2017).  “Yet there [we]re \nsubstantial exceptions” to such compliance, one of which being the agency’s failure to address \nexpert comments noting that the pipeline suffered from serious flaws that could result in \nextensive environmental harm in the event of a spill.  Id.  The Court thus ordered the Corps to \n1  \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 2 of 42\nconsider these issues on remand.  Id. at 160.  That remand is now complete, and the Tribes, not \nsurprisingly, strongly disagree with the Corps’ most recent conclusions.   \nIn analyzing those conclusions, this Court has received significant guidance from a recent \ncase decided by the D.C. Circuit, National Parks Conservation Association v. Semonite, 916 F.3d \n1075, 1082 (D.C. Cir. 2019).  The appeals court there clarified the inquiry to be conducted by a \ndistrict court when determining whether an agency has adequately dealt with expert criticisms \nsuch as these.  Applying Semonite, this Court ultimately concludes that too many questions \nremain unanswered.  Unrebutted expert critiques regarding leak-detection systems, operator \nsafety records, adverse conditions, and worst-case discharge mean that the easement approval \nremains “highly controversial” under NEPA.  As the Court thus cannot find that the Corps has \nadequately discharged its duties under that statute, it will remand the matter to the agency to \nprepare an Environmental Impact Statement. \nI.  Background \nIn order to reacquaint the reader with the landscape against which this dispute unfolds, \nthe Court will first briefly set out the statutory framework of NEPA.  It will then separately \ndiscuss the factual background, the procedural history, and the recent remand and resulting \nclaims. \nA.  Statutory and Regulatory Scheme \nThe National Environmental Policy Act requires agencies to “consider every significant \naspect of the environmental impact of a proposed action,” Baltimore Gas & Elec. Co. v. NRDC, \n462 U.S. 87, 97 (1983) (quoting Vt. Yankee Nuclear Power Corp v. NRDC, 435 U.S. 519, 553 \n(1978)), so as to “inform the public that it has indeed considered environmental concerns in its \ndecisionmaking process.”  Id. (citing Weinberger v. Catholic Action of Haw., 454 U.S. 139, 143 \n2  \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 3 of 42\n(1981)).  In order to achieve these goals, NEPA imposes on agencies certain procedural \nrequirements, Citizens Against Burlington, Inc. v. Busey, 938 F.2d 190, 193–94 (D.C. Cir. \n1991), but it “does not mandate particular consequences.”  Id. at 194.   \nFirst, an agency must draft an Environmental Assessment, see 40 C.F.R. § 1501.4(b), that \n“[b]riefly provide[s] sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an \nenvironmental impact statement [EIS] or a finding of no significant impact [FONSI].”  Id. \n§ 1508.9(a).  “If any ‘significant’ environmental impacts might result from the proposed agency \naction[,] then an EIS must be prepared before agency action is taken.”  Grand Canyon Trust v. \nFAA, 290 F.3d 339, 340 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (quoting Sierra Club v. Peterson, 717 F.2d 1409, 1415 \n(D.C. Cir. 1983)); see also 42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C) (requiring a statement of the environmental \nimpact of any proposed action “significantly affecting the quality of the human environment”).  \nIf, on the other hand, the agency determines that no EIS is required, it must prepare either a \nFONSI or a Mitigated FONSI, depending on whether the lack of significant impact results from \nan agency’s commitment to mitigation measures.  See 40 C.F.R. §§ 1501.4(e), 1508.13; Council \non Environmental Quality, Appropriate Use of Mitigation and Monitoring and Clarifying the \nAppropriate Use of Mitigated Findings of No Significant Impact 2, 7 (2011), https://ceq.doe.gov/ \ndocs/ceq-regulations-and-guidance/Mitigation_and_Monitoring_Guidance_14Jan2011.pdf. \nIn order to determine whether its actions may result in “significant” environmental \nimpacts — and therefore whether it must prepare an EIS — an agency must examine both the \n“context” and the “intensity” of the action.  See 40 C.F.R. § 1508.27.  When looking at intensity, \nan agency must consider ten factors, id. § 1508.27(b), and “[i]mplicating any one of the[se] \nfactors may be sufficient to require development of an EIS.”  Semonite, 916 F.3d at 1082 (citing \nGrand Canyon Trust, 290 F.3d at 347).  Relevant here is the fourth of these factors — viz., “[t]he \n3  \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 4 of 42\ndegree to which the effects on the quality of the human environment are likely to be highly \ncontroversial.”  40 C.F.R. § 1508.27(b)(4).  This factor will be discussed at length below.  See \ninfra Section III.A.1. \nAlthough not in the above-described list of ten factors, two other issues require the \nCorps’ attention under its NEPA obligations.  First, in this Circuit, NEPA creates, through the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, a right of action deriving from Executive Order 12,898.  This \norder requires federal agencies to “make achieving environmental justice part of their \nmission” — “[t]o the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law” — “by identifying and \naddressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental \neffects of [their] programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income \npopulations.”  59 Fed. Reg. 7629 (Feb. 11, 1994), § 1-101; see Cmtys. Against Runway \nExpansion, Inc. v. FAA, 355 F.3d 678, 688–89 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (recognizing right to \nenvironmental-justice review under NEPA and APA).  Indian tribes are one of the populations \nthat must be considered.  See Council on Envtl. Quality, Environmental Justice: Guidance Under \nthe National Environmental Policy Act 9 (1997), https://ceq.doe.gov/docs/ceq-regulations-and-\nguidance/regs/ej/justice.pdf. \n  Second, the parties agreed during the first round of summary-judgment briefing that \nNEPA additionally requires an agency to determine how a project will affect a tribe’s treaty \nrights, in this case those arising from the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851.  Standing Rock III, 255 F. \nSupp. 3d at 130–31 (citing Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851, art. 5, 11 Stat. 749, 1851 WL 7655).  As \nrelevant at this stage, the Corps is required to consider how the pipeline would affect the Tribes’ \nhunting and fishing resources.  Id. at 130–32; see 11 Stat. 749, art. 5 (reserving to Tribes “the \nprivilege of hunting” and “fishing” on treaty lands). \n4  \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 5 of 42\nB.  Factual History \nAs the issues present in the current round of briefing are fairly cabined, the Court will \nprovide only an abbreviated version of the factual history laid out in its prior Opinions in this \ncase.  See, e.g., Standing Rock III, 255 F. Supp. 3d at 114–16. \nThe Dakota Access Pipeline, designed to carry crude oil from North Dakota to Illinois, \ncrosses several waterways along its 1,200-mile path.  Id. at 114 (citing Standing Rock Sioux \nTribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs (Standing Rock I), 205 F. Supp. 3d 4, 7 (D.D.C. 2016)).  \nOne of these is Lake Oahe, an artificial reservoir in the Missouri created by construction of a \ndam in 1958.  Id. (citing Standing Rock I, 205 F. Supp. 3d at 13).  The “lake” begins near \nBismarck, North Dakota, and extends about 231 miles south, ending at the Oahe Dam in South \nDakota.  See ECF No. 172-1 (Final EA) at 35.  In creating Lake Oahe, Congress effected a \ntaking of 56,000 acres from Standing Rock’s Reservation and 104,420 acres from the trust lands \nof the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe.  Standing Rock III, 255 F. Supp. 3d at 114 (citing Act of \nSept. 2, 1958, Pub. L. No. 85-915, 72 Stat. 1762).  The Tribes now rely on the waters of Lake \nOahe in myriad ways, including for drinking, agriculture, industry, and sacred religious and \nmedicinal practices.  Id.; see, e.g., ECF No. 289-3 (Declaration of Faith Spotted Eagle), ¶¶ 5–22. \nAs the first step in determining whether it would permit Dakota Access to construct a \nportion of DAPL under Lake Oahe, the Corps published a Draft EA, finding that it would not \nneed to prepare the more involved EIS.  Standing Rock III, 255 F. Supp. 3d at 115–16; ECF No. \n6-19 (Draft EA) at 1.  The Tribes and the Department of the Interior commented, both urging the \nCorps to go further and prepare an EIS.  Standing Rock III, 255 F. Supp. 3d at 115–16.  The EPA \nalso commented, suggesting that the Corps must at least prepare a Mitigated FONSI.  Id. at 116.  \nIn July 2016, the Corps published its Final EA — again finding that no EIS was required — and \n5  \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 6 of 42\na Mitigated FONSI.  See ECF Nos. 172-1 (Final EA), 172-2 (Mitigated FONSI).  Both the Draft \nand the Final EA were prepared by Dakota Access with input from the Corps, as is permitted by \nNEPA regulations under certain circumstances.  Standing Rock III, 255 F. Supp. 3d at 116 \n(citing 40 C.F.R. § 1506.5(a)-(b)).   \nC.  Procedural History \nShortly after the Corps published the Final EA, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe filed suit \nagainst the agency in this Court, principally claiming that its decisions violated the National \nHistoric Preservation Act and NEPA.  See Complaint, ¶¶ 128–93.  Dakota Access moved \nsuccessfully to intervene as a defendant, see ECF No. 7; Minute Order of Aug. 8, 2016 (granting \nintervention), and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe so moved as a plaintiff.  See ECF No. 11; \nMinute Order of Aug. 19, 2016 (granting intervention).  On September 9, 2016, the Court denied \nPlaintiffs’ Motion to enjoin construction of the pipeline, finding that the Tribes were unlikely to \nprevail on their NHPA claims that the construction process desecrated sacred lands adjoining \nLake Oahe.  Standing Rock I, 205 F. Supp. 3d at 37.  As political protests in the pipeline’s \nvicinity grew, the Departments of Justice, the Interior, and the Army that same day jointly \nannounced that DAPL construction would be suspended pending the Corps’ reconsideration of \nits statutory obligations.  See ECF No. 42-1 at 1–2.  Reversing course, the Corps subsequently \npublished notice of its intent to prepare an EIS as to Dakota Access’s request for an easement to \ncross Lake Oahe.  See 82 Fed. Reg. 5,543 (Jan. 18, 2017). \nFollowing the change of administration in January 2017 and a presidential memorandum \nencouraging acceleration of the DAPL project, see 82 Fed. Reg. 8,661 (Jan. 24, 2017), the Corps \nagain reconsidered its decision and ultimately decided to terminate its intent to prepare an EIS.  \nSee 82 Fed. Reg. 11,021 (Feb. 17, 2017).  After notifying Congress on February 7, 2017, see \n6  \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 7 of 42\nECF No. 172-10, the agency then issued the easement to Dakota Access on February 8, 2017.  \nSee ECF No. 172-11.  The Court thereafter rejected a second preliminary-injunction motion, this \ntime brought by Cheyenne River on Religious Freedom Restoration Act grounds, finding \nobstacles in both the doctrine of laches and the Tribe’s low likelihood of success on the merits.  \nStanding Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs (Standing Rock II), 239 F. Supp. 3d \n77, 100 (D.D.C. 2017).  Around this time, the case was consolidated with two others against the \nCorps, such that the Oglala Sioux Tribe and Yankton Sioux Tribe were added as Plaintiffs in this \nmatter.  See Minute Order of Mar. 16, 2017.  All four Tribes currently remain in the suit. \nFinally sending their ace pitcher out to the mound in Game 3 — after previously pushing \nweaker counts under the NHPA and RFRA — Standing Rock and Cheyenne River next sought \nsummary judgment under NEPA, arguing that the Corps was required to prepare an EIS, and \nDefendants similarly cross-moved.  In June 2017, the Court largely upheld the Corps’ decision, \nincluding on the ground that it had fulfilled any consultation duties toward the Tribes.  Standing \nRock III, 255 F. Supp. 3d at 147.  Yet, it nonetheless found “substantial exceptions” warranting \nremand.  Id.  As to Standing Rock, there were three such deficiencies in the Corps’ work.  The \nagency had inadequately considered, in accordance with its obligations under NEPA: (1) whether \nthe project’s effects were likely to be “highly controversial,” id. at 127–29 (citing 40 C.F.R. \n§ 1508.27(b)(4)); (2) the impact of a hypothetical oil spill on the Tribe’s fishing and hunting \nrights, id. at 132–34; and (3) the environmental-justice effects of the project.  Id. at 136–40.  The \nCourt consequently remanded the matter to the agency to address these issues.  Id. at 160.  It also \nreserved decision on two of Cheyenne River’s arguments pending the results of the remand, id. \nat 150, 153, but the Tribe does not now re-assert those positions.  See ECF No. 436 (Cheyenne \nRiver Second MSJ). \n7  \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 8 of 42\nOglala’s and Yankton’s claims, meanwhile, were in earlier stages.  Yankton and \nDefendants cross-moved for summary judgment the following year, and the Court found in favor \nof the Corps.  Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs (Standing Rock V), 301 \nF. Supp. 3d 50, 75 (D.D.C. 2018).  Both Yankton and Oglala later preserved issues they intended \nto pursue following a remand.  See ECF Nos. 385 (Oglala); 386 (Yankton).    \nD.  Remand and Results \nWhile the Court remanded to the agency a few of Standing Rock’s and Cheyenne River’s \nclaims, it did not at that point determine whether the easement for the pipeline would be vacated \nduring the remand.  Standing Rock III, 255 F. Supp. 3d at 147–48.  In October 2017, it found \nthat “[i]n light of the ‘serious possibility’ that the Corps w[ould] be able to substantiate its prior \nconclusions,” vacatur was not appropriate.  Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of \nEng’rs (Standing Rock IV), 282 F. Supp. 3d 91, 109 (D.D.C. 2017) (quoting Nat’l Parks \nConservation Ass’n v. Jewell, 62 F. Supp. 3d 7, 20 (D.D.C. 2014)).   \nThe Corps completed its remand analysis in February 2019, see ECF No. 398 (Notice of \nService of Remand Analysis), and the parties filed a joint appendix containing that record the \nfollowing month.  See ECF No. 406 (Remand Analysis Record).  The Corps’ work on remand \nwill be discussed in more detail below.  See infra Section III.   \nAll parties have now again moved for summary judgment — for the first time, in the case \nof Oglala.  In their briefs, the Tribes raised not only the remanded issues but several others.  All \nTribes jointly argue that the Corps has failed to remedy its three NEPA violations on remand.  In \naddition, Standing Rock, Cheyenne River, and Yankton attempt to resurrect their NHPA claims, \nwhich the Court rejected in earlier Opinions.  See Standing Rock I, 205 F. Supp. 3d at 10; \nStanding Rock V, 301 F. Supp. 3d at 64.  Yankton also raised a preserved non-NHPA \n8  \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 9 of 42\nconsultation claim (as to the Corps’ actions before the remand), and Oglala argued its preserved \nclaims under the Mni Waconi Act.  All Tribes further contend that the Corps violated its \nconsultation duties toward them during remand.  The Court heard oral argument via \nteleconference on March 18, 2020, and it is now prepared to rule on the Motions. \nII.  Legal Standard \nUpon a party’s motion, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a) requires the Court to “grant \nsummary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact \nand the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  A fact is material if it would change \nthe outcome of the litigation, Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986); \nHolcomb v. Powell, 433 F.3d 889, 895 (D.C. Cir. 2006), and a dispute is genuine if the evidence \nis such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party.  Scott v. Harris, \n550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007); Holcomb, 433 F.3d at 895.  In the event of conflicting evidence on a \nmaterial issue, the Court is to construe the conflicting evidence in the light most favorable to the \nnon-moving party.  Sample v. Bureau of Prisons, 466 F.3d 1086, 1087 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  \n“Factual assertions in the moving party’s affidavits or declarations may be accepted as true \nunless the opposing party submits its own affidavits[,] . . . declarations[,] or documentary \nevidence to the contrary.”  Defs. of Wildlife v. U.S. Border Patrol, 623 F. Supp. 2d 83, 87 \n(D.D.C. 2009) (citing Neal v. Kelly, 963 F.2d 453, 456 (D.C. Cir. 1992)). \nThe above-described standard, however, does not apply to the Tribes’ NEPA claims, \nwhich will be analyzed under the Administrative Procedure Act’s judicial-review standard.  \nSierra Club v. FERC, 867 F.3d 1357, 1367 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (“[B]ecause NEPA does not create a \nprivate right of action, we can entertain NEPA-based challenges only under the [APA] and its \ndeferential standard of review.”).  That standard, set out below, applies in place of the typical \n9  \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 10 of 42\nsummary-judgment standard of Rule 56: “[W]hen a party seeks review of agency action under \nthe APA, . . . the district judge sits as an appellate tribunal.”  Rempfer v. Sharfstein, 583 F.3d \n860, 865 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (quoting Am. Bioscience, Inc. v. Thompson, 269 F.3d 1077, 1083 \n(D.C. Cir. 2001)).  In other words, “[t]he entire case on review is a question of law.”  Id. (quoting \nMarshall Cty. Health Care Auth. v. Shalala, 988 F.2d 1221, 1226 (D.C. Cir. 1993)). \nThe Administrative Procedure Act “sets forth the full extent of judicial authority to \nreview executive agency action for procedural correctness.”  FCC v. Fox Television Stations, \nInc., 556 U.S. 502, 513 (2009).  It requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \nfindings, and conclusions” that are “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not \nin accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  Agency action is arbitrary and capricious if, for \nexample, the agency “entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an \nexplanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so \nimplausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency \nexpertise.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 \n(1983).  \n“‘The scope of review [in an APA case] is narrow and a court is not to substitute its \njudgment for that of the agency,’ provided the agency has ‘examine[d] the data and articulate[d] \na satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found \nand the choice made.’” Airmotive Eng’g Corp. v. FAA, 882 F.3d 1157, 1159 (D.C. Cir. 2018) \n(second and third alterations in original) (quoting State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43).  While the Court \n“may not supply a reasoned basis for the agency’s action that the agency itself has not given, [it] \nwill uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency’s path may reasonably be \ndiscerned.”  Bowman Transp., Inc. v. Ark.-Best Freight Sys., Inc., 419 U.S. 281, 286 (1974) \n1 0 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 11 of 42\n(citation omitted) (citing SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 196 (1947); then citing Colo. \nInterstate Gas Co. v. FPC, 324 U.S. 581, 595 (1945)).  It is only these “certain minimal standards \nof rationality” to which a reviewing court holds an agency.  Nat’l Envtl. Dev. Ass’n’s Clean Air \nProject v. EPA, 686 F.3d 803, 810 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (quoting Ethyl Corp. v. EPA, 541 F.2d 1, \n36–37 (D.C. Cir. 1976) (en banc)). \nIII.  Analysis \nWe now arrive at the crux of the matter: has the Corps remedied the three NEPA \nshortcomings that necessitated remand?  And what of the other claims raised by the Tribes?  The \nCourt will focus on NEPA and then briefly address the remaining claims brought under two \nother statutes.  \nA.  NEPA \nAs noted above, while the Court “[found] that the Corps’ decision on July 25, 2016, and \nFebruary 3, 2017, not to issue an EIS largely complied with NEPA,” it also concluded that there \nwere three “substantial exceptions” — that is, the Corps had violated NEPA in three ways.  \nStanding Rock III, 255 F. Supp. at 147.  To wit, it found wanting the Corps’ analysis of: (1) \nwhether the project’s effects were likely to be highly controversial, id. at 129; (2) the impact of \nan oil spill on the Tribe’s fishing and hunting rights under the Treaty of 1851, id. at 134; and (3) \n“whether,” under a required environmental-justice analysis, “Standing Rock would be \ndisproportionately harmed by a spill.”  Id. at 140. \nThe Court will begin its analysis by discussing relevant aspects of the standard of review \nof agency action under NEPA.  It will then proceed to consider how the Corps fares under that \nstandard.  It will finish by explaining how its findings on the “highly controversial” factor \n1 1 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 12 of 42\nobviate a need for discussion of the other two remand issues as well as some other claims raised \nby the Tribes. \n  NEPA Standard \nNEPA requires an agency to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement “[i]f any \n‘significant’ environmental impacts might result from the proposed agency action.”  Grand \nCanyon Trust, 290 F.3d at 340 (quoting Peterson, 717 F.2d at 1415).  A court’s “role in \nreviewing an agency’s decision not to prepare an EIS is a limited one, designed primarily to \nensure that no arguably significant consequences have been ignored.”  Myersville Citizens for a \nRural Cmty., Inc. v. FERC, 783 F.3d 1301, 1322 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (emphasis added) (internal \nquotation marks omitted) (quoting TOMAC v. Norton, 433 F.3d 852, 860 (D.C. Cir. 2006)).  It \n“must review whether the agency: ‘(1) has accurately identified the relevant environmental \nconcern, (2) has taken a hard look at the problem in preparing its EA, (3) is able to make a \nconvincing case for its finding of no significant impact, and (4) has shown that even if there is an \nimpact of true significance, an EIS is unnecessary because changes or safeguards in the project \nsufficiently reduce the impact to a minimum.’”  Michigan Gambling Opposition v. Kempthorne, \n525 F.3d 23, 29 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (quoting TOMAC, 433 F.3d at 861).  While NEPA does not \ndirect agencies “to take one type of action or another,” it does require courts to hold them \naccountable to its procedural requirements.  Busey, 938 F.2d at 193–94.  The decision not to \nprepare an EIS is part of the latter category — that is, courts may find that an agency was \narbitrary and capricious not to prepare an EIS and order it to do so.  See, e.g., Semonite, 916 F.3d \nat 1088. \nAs noted above, an agency considering whether a project will have a “significant” effect \non the environment — and thus whether it must prepare an EIS, see Peterson, 717 F.2d at 1415; \n1 2 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 13 of 42\n42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C) — must analyze both the proposed action’s “context” and its “intensity.”  \n40 C.F.R. § 1508.27.  “[I]n evaluating intensity,” the agency must consider ten factors, id. \n§ 1508.27(b), only one of which is relevant here.  “Implicating any one of these factors may be \nsufficient to require development of an EIS.”  Semonite, 916 F.3d at 1082.  For example, in \nGrand Canyon Trust, the D.C. Circuit found that, having decided that the FAA had not \nsufficiently considered one of the factors, it need not “reach[]” the plaintiff’s claim that the \nagency had also failed to adequately analyze another of the ten.  See 290 F.3d at 347. \nThe § 1508.27(b) factor at issue here is “[t]he degree to which [the project’s] effects on \nthe quality of the human environment are likely to be highly controversial.”  40 C.F.R. \n§ 1508.27(b)(4).  Effects are “controversial” where “substantial dispute exists as to the size, \nnature, or effect of the major federal action rather than to the existence of opposition to a use.”  \nTown of Cave Creek v. FAA, 325 F.3d 320, 331 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (emphasis added) (quoting \nFound. for N. Am. Wild Sheep v. USDA, 681 F.2d 1172, 1182 (9th Cir. 1982)).  While “what \nconstitutes the type of ‘controversy’ that requires a full EIS is not entirely clear,” Nat’l Parks \nConservation Ass’n v. United States, 177 F. Supp. 3d 1, 33 (D.D.C. 2016) (quoting Nat’l \nWildlife Fed’n v. Norton, 332 F. Supp. 2d 170, 184 (D.D.C. 2004)), “something more is required \nbesides the fact that some people may be highly agitated and be willing to go to court over the \nmatter.”  Id. (quoting Fund for Animals v. Frizzell, 530 F.2d 982, 988 n.15 (D.C. Cir. 1975)).  In \nother words, the significant public protests near Lake Oahe do not transform the pipeline’s \napproval into a highly controversial action within the meaning of 40 C.F.R. § 1508.27(b)(4). \nThis “something more” is often “scientific or other evidence that reveals flaws in the \nmethods or data relied upon by the agency in reaching its conclusions.”  WildEarth Guardians v. \nZinke, 368 F. Supp. 3d 41, 81 (D.D.C. 2019) (quoting Nat’l Parks Conservation Ass’n, 177 F. \n1 3 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 14 of 42\nSupp. 3d at 33).  In its first summary-judgment Opinion, the Court found that “[t]he expert \nreports submitted to the Corps after the Final EA was published but before the Corps again \ndecided in February 2017 that an EIS was not required . . . present such scientific critiques.” \nStanding Rock III, 255 F. Supp. 3d at 129 (emphases omitted); see also id. (listing, as examples, \nseven methodological critiques made in the Tribes’ expert reports).  The agency’s failure to \nsufficiently respond to these critiques was one of the issues necessitating remand.  Id. \nWhile the remand in this case was ongoing, the D.C. Circuit issued a significant opinion \nclarifying a court’s role in reviewing an agency’s finding that a project was not “highly \ncontroversial.”  In Semonite, the Corps examined the construction of power lines that would run \nthrough historic Jamestown and determined that it did not need to prepare an EIS.  See 916 F.3d \nat 1078–80.  Many commenters, including the National Park Service, the Advisory Council on \nHistoric Preservation, the Virginia Department of Historic Resources, and “many non-\ngovernmental organizations,” raised concerns about various aspects of the project.  Id. at 1080.  \nSome of these commenters “identified what they viewed as serious flaws in the Corps’s \nmethodologies.”  Id.  In response, the Corps “twice directed [the power company building the \nlines] to revise its photo simulations,” but “[c]ommenters remained unsatisfied.”  Id.  The D.C. \nCircuit found that, contrary to the Corps’ position, the agency action was likely to be “highly \ncontroversial” — and thus the project must be halted while the Corps prepared an EIS — \nbecause there was “consistent and strenuous opposition, often in the form of concrete objections \nto the Corps’s analytical process and findings, from agencies entrusted with preserving historic \nresources and organizations with subject-matter expertise.”  Id. at 1086.   \nCrucially, the Semonite court explicitly rejected the agency’s argument that it had \nfulfilled its duty under NEPA by “acknowledg[ing] and try[ing] to address concerns raised \n1 4 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 15 of 42\nduring the NEPA process by, for example, instructing [the equivalent of DAPL here] to revise its \nanalyses to address the shortcomings identified by commenters.”  Id. at 1085.  That argument, \nthe D.C. Circuit stated, “misse[d] the point.”  Id.  “The question is not whether the Corps \nattempted to resolve the controversy, but whether it succeeded.  Given that many critical \ncomments, including from [agencies and non-governmental organizations], post-dated [those] \nrevisions, the Corps obviously failed.”  Id. at 1085–86 (emphases added).   \nThe Corps argues that Semonite does not control — and thus that “considering” \nresponses “is all that is required,” Oral Arg. Tr. at 44:5–6 — because in that case both private \norganizations and federal agencies with subject-matter expertise raised concerns with the \nagency’s proposed plans.  See ECF No. 458 (Corps Opp. to Standing Rock) at 29–30.  Whereas \n“in Semonite, you had the neutral expert agency” objecting to the Corps’ plans, it contends, \n“[Y]ou have the opposite here.”  Oral Arg. Tr. at 6:25–7:6.  By “the opposite,” the agency means \nthat in this case, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) “did not \nobject to the worst case discharge methodology or underlying assumptions.”  Corps Opp. to \nStanding Rock at 30. \nThe Court does not believe that these points distinguish the clear instruction of Semonite.  \nFirst, the D.C. Circuit in that case did not rest its holding exclusively on the existence of federal-\nagency criticisms, ignoring those raised by private organizations.  See, e.g., 916 F.3d at 1085 \n(describing the “considered responses” of “highly specialized governmental agencies and \norganizations”).  Second, both the Department of the Interior and the EPA, under the previous \nadministration, did express concerns with the agency’s analysis here.  Interior, for example, \nfound that the Corps’ Draft EA “did not adequately justify or otherwise support its conclusion \nthat there would be no significant impacts upon the surrounding environment and community.”  \n1 5 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 16 of 42\nUSACE_DAPL 5750.  EPA recommended, among other things, that the Corps analyze more \nclosely the leak-detection system it had selected, including its “ability . . . to identify small \nvolume leaks.”  USACE_DAPL 5746.  In fact, as the Corps itself noted, EPA’s own estimate for \na spill from a pipeline of DAPL’s size in that region was many times the size of the Corps’.  See \nUSACE_DAPL 72184, 72252 (citing U.S. Nat’l Response Team, Mid-Missouri River Sub-Area \nContingency Plan 9 (2015)).  The agencies’ position changed after a new administration took \noffice and President Trump urged the Corps to “review and approve [DAPL] in an expedited \nmanner.”  82 Fed. Reg. 8661.  This is certainly their prerogative, see State Farm, 463 U.S. at 59 \n(Rehnquist, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (“A change in administration brought \nabout by the people casting their votes is a perfectly reasonable basis for an executive agency's \nreappraisal of the costs and benefits of its programs and regulations.”), but the existence of the \nprior comments undercuts the Corps’ emphasis on the lack of federal-agency critique in this \ncase.   \nThird and finally, the Corps’ position treats the Tribes and their experts as more akin to \nthe “non-governmental organizations” in Semonite, 916 F.3d at 1080, than governmental \nentities.  As the Government well knows, however, “Indian tribes are ‘domestic dependent \nnations’ that exercise inherent sovereign authority over their members and territories.”  Okla. \nTax Comm’n v. Citizen Band Potawatomi Tribe of Okla., 498 U.S. 505, 509 (1991) (quoting \nCherokee Nation v. Georgia, 30 U.S. (5 Pet.) 1, 10 (1831)).  Here, these sovereign nations \nprepared expert comments with the help of not only third-party consultants but also their own \nrelevant governmental departments.  See, e.g., RAR 7453 (report submitted by Standing Rock in \ncollaboration with, among others, its Department of Water Resources, Department of Game and \nFish, Tribal Emergency Management Commission, Department of Environmental Regulation, \n1 6 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 17 of 42\nand a five-member “Technical Consulting Team”).  In sum, the Court does not find a reason to \ndeviate from Semonite here. \nIn addition to the nature of the Court’s review, the parties also disagree as to its scope.  \nDakota Access maintains that, in determining whether the Corps has fulfilled its NEPA \nobligations, the Court should consider only the critiques raised between July 2016 and February \n2017 — that is, those that generated the unresolved scientific controversy prompting the Court’s \nremand.  See ECF No. 456 (Dakota Access Consolidated Opp.) at 14; Oral Arg. Tr. at 46:8–11 \n(arguing that Court should consider “the results of [the] new modeling” but not Plaintiffs’ \nresponses to them).  The Tribes, on the other hand, believe that the Court should also review \ntheir comments submitted during the remand and the Corps’ responses to those.   \nOnce again, Semonite lights the way.  Arguably, under that precedent, the Court could \nfind the “highly controversial” factor met merely from the existence of “consistent and strenuous \nopposition” in the form of experts’ “concrete objections to the Corps’s analytical process and \nfindings” that “post-dated” the Corps’ revision efforts.  Semonite, 916 F.3d at 1085–86.  But this \ncase stands in a more developed procedural posture than Semonite: here the agency has had an \nadditional chance to respond to these renewed criticisms during the remand.  See RAR 103 \n(confirming Corps considered in its remand analysis “the letters, written comments, and expert \nreports” as well as “all information verbally communicated at the meetings with the Tribes” \nduring remand); id. at 104 tbl.III-1 (listing documents considered and responded to, including \nthose received after the easement and during remand).  As a result, and particularly since both \nDefendants argued the sufficiency of those responses in their briefs, see, e.g., Dakota Access \nConsolidated Opp. at 25–27; ECF No. 446 (Corps Opp. to Standing Rock) at 28, the Court finds \nit prudent to analyze the substance of expert comments made both before and during the remand \n1 7 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 18 of 42\nto determine whether they “succeed” in resolving the points of scientific controversy that \ncontinue to be raised by experts. \n  Points of Controversy \nHaving thus delineated the nature and scope of its review, the Court may now engage in \nthe business of reviewing.  Given the volume of expert comments submitted both before the \ngranting of the easement and during the remand, it finds that the best approach is to group these \ncriticisms by subject matter.  For each topic, the Court will discuss the concerns raised by the \nTribes’ experts, the responses offered by the Corps, and whether the latter succeed in resolving \nthe scientific controversy.  Plaintiffs’ experts will be introduced as they appear in the below \ncomments.  The Corps also relied on reports prepared for Dakota Access by a third-party \nconsulting expert.  See, e.g., RAR 8743 (noting that Spill Model Analysis was done by private \nconsulting group RPS for ETP); Final EA at 126–27 (including, in “List of Preparers and \nReviewers,” three “Environmental Specialists” from a private environmental consulting \ncompany).  Citations to Bates numbers beginning with USACE_ESMT, USACE_DAPL, \nUSFWS_DAPL, and OAHE indicate references to the pre-remand administrative record, \nincluding the expert comments contained therein.  Citations to Bates numbers beginning with \nRAR refer to the remand-analysis record, again including expert comments raised during that \ntime.   \nWhile there are many topics to choose from, the Court finds that examining four will be \nsufficient to demonstrate the amount of unresolved scientific controversy that remains.  As will \nbe explained, even this non-extensive selection suffices to show the necessity of an EIS. \n1 8 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 19 of 42\na.  Leak-Detection System \nThe Court begins by discussing concerns raised about DAPL’s leak-detection system — \none of the areas of unaddressed scientific controversy noted in the first summary-judgment \nOpinion.  Standing Rock III, 255 F. Supp. 3d at 129 (quoting USACE_ESMT 1081).  Experts for \nboth Standing Rock and Cheyenne River expressed their skepticism as to the effectiveness of this \nsystem both before and during the remand.   \nFirst, they asserted that there was serious reason to doubt the efficacy of the system.  As \nthe above-mentioned report submitted by Standing Rock noted, “A 2012 PHMSA \ncomprehensive leak detection study found one type of leak detection system[, called \nSCADA,] . . . detected hazardous liquid leaks 28 percent of the time,” and another, called CPM, \n“had a detection rate of 20 percent.”  RAR 7505.  Another expert for Standing Rock had also \npresented this data in October 2016, adding that “[t]his low success rate” was “consistent with \nAccufacts’ many liquid pipeline failure investigations spanning more than 40 years, especially \nmore recent investigations.”  ECF No. 117-15 (Accufacts Report of October 2016) at 4–5.  \nDAPL, it should be noted, uses a CPM leak-detection system.  See RAR 173–74.   \nThe Corps’ response to the first of these comments was to merely refer to its response to \na different comment that did not specifically address the PHMSA data.  See RAR 257 (directing \nreader to RAR 143–44); RAR 143–44 (addressing worst-case discharge generally and not \nPHMSA data from 2012).  Its response to the second — which raised the same PHMSA data — \naddressed only Accufacts’s assertion that the PHMSA data was consistent with its 40 years of \nexperience investigating pipeline failures: “ETP asserts that a comparison to data from 40 years \nago, and from older pipelines installed prior to modern pipeline standards, overstates the risk of \n1 9 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 20 of 42\nthis modern pipeline.”  RAR 173.  It then went on to describe some features of DAPL’s “state-\nof-the-art pipeline monitoring tools” and practices.  See RAR 173–74. \nThese responses plainly do not succeed in resolving the serious concerns raised.  Most \ncritically, the Corps failed entirely to respond to the 2012 PHMSA study that indicated an 80% \nfailure rate in the type of leak-detection system employed by DAPL.  Instead, it focused on the \nexpert’s comment that its own experience corroborated the PHMSA data.  The agency \nmischaracterized this comment as drawing only on “data from 40 years ago, and from older \npipelines installed prior to modern pipeline standards,” RAR 173, when the expert had \nspecifically stated that its experience was drawn from a 40-year period and “especially more \nrecent investigations.”  Accufacts Report at 5.  Accufacts made no indication that its experience \nwas only with “pipelines installed prior to modern pipeline standards.”  The Corps’ statement \nthat the expert’s comment “overstates” the risk of a leak-detection failure, therefore, holds no \nwater (or oil, as the case may be). \nSecond, experts noted that the apparent likelihood that DAPL’s leak-detection system \nwould not perform the detections for which it was designed was only part of the problem.  In \naddition, the system was not even designed to detect leaks that constituted 1% or less of the \npipe’s flow rate.  See RAR 7683.  At the current pipeline flow rate of about 600,000 barrels per \nday, this means that “6,000 bbs/day” — that is, about 25,200 gallons — “could be released \ncontinuously, over a long period of time, without detection.”  Id.  Oglala’s expert, a civil and \nenvironmental engineer working for an engineering consultancy group, made similar points in a \nDecember 2016 report.  See RAR 1250.  The Corps did not respond to these comments, see RAR \n155–59, 274, but in responses to other related topics, it stated that “[a]ccording to ETP,” the \nleak-detection system in place for DAPL “is capable of detecting leaks down to 1 percent or \n2 0 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 21 of 42\nbetter of the pipeline flow rate.”  RAR 127.  “In the event of a slow leak,” it continued, “even if \npressure measurements do not show a significant drop in pressure, a detectable meter imbalance \nwill develop over a period of time resulting in an alarm to the Control Center.”  Id.  “While the \nalarm threshold may be 1%,” DAPL’s leak-detection system is “sensitive to smaller changes in \nflow rate and pressure.”  Id. \nThe Court similarly cannot find that the agency adequately disposed of the experts’ \nconcerns here.  Even while stating that the system was “sensitive to smaller changes in flow rate \nand pressure,” the Corps confirmed that the threshold for a leak-detection alarm was 1%.  See \nRAR 127.  Its further response that a less-than-1% leak would eventually be detected over an \nunspecified “period of time” after building up enough to cause a meter imbalance, id., was less \nthan reassuring given that the amount of undetected leaking oil could be as much as 6,000 barrels \nper day.  See RAR 7683.  Indeed, one of the experts noted that Sunoco had experienced a spill of \n8,600 barrels on one of its pipelines when it had not recognized a leak even when there was an \n“imbalance indication[]” because that imbalance did not exceed “established normal operating \ntolerances.”  RAR 7491 (quoting PHMSA report of the incident).  At oral argument, moreover, \nwhen asked why the spill modeling did not include such a slow-leak scenario, the Corps stated \nthat “there was no particular reason that they didn’t look at a slow leak.”  Oral Arg. Tr. at 12:8–\n9. \nThird, Accufacts commented that a “complete risk analysis require[s], inter alia, \nconsideration of . . . location and type of ‘critical leak detection monitoring devices by \nmilepost.’”  RAR 7491 (quoting USACE_ESMT 1081); see also USACE_ESMT 1078–79 (same \nexpert finding “key variables” such as “time to remotely recognize and react to a possible \nrelease” were not considered by Corps).  The agency responded that the third-party engineering \n2 1 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 22 of 42\ncompany that had performed the risk analysis had, according to representations made to the \nCorps by ETP, considered “[i]nformation on critical leak detection monitoring devices associated \nwith the [leak-detection system] consisting of pressure transmitters and ultra-sonic flow meters \nby milepost location.”  RAR 129. \nThis response does not quite succeed in resolving the issues raised.  Stating that it had \nconsidered the information was a good start, but, while the Corps did indicate the type of \nmonitoring devices that were used, it did not mention their locations, and, most critically, it did \nnot point to any analysis that did in fact take these two details into consideration.  Were this the \nonly point of expert contention, it might be a closer call, but the Corps’ responses to the first two \ngroups of expert comments show that the scientific controversy surrounding DAPL’s leak-\ndetection system was not resolved. \nb.  Operator Safety Record \nThe next topic is the safety record of DAPL’s operator, referred to interchangeably by the \nparties as ETP and Sunoco (the two completed a merger during this litigation).  The thrust of \nthese comments was that any analysis of the risk or magnitude of a spill for a certain pipeline \nshould take into account the performance history of its operator.  Donald Holmstrom, an \n“attorney, investigator, and process safety practitioner with many decades of experience in the \noil industry and U.S. government,” ECF No. 272-4 (Declaration of Donald Holmstrom), ¶ 1, \ncommented, “A valid risk analysis would recognize the history of the operator, but that didn’t \nhappen here.”  Id., ¶ 9.  Standing Rock’s remand report made a similar comment.  See RAR 7503 \n(“Nowhere d[id] DAPL explain why historic shutdown discharges from other Sunoco/ETP \npipeline incidents are not discussed or relevant. . . . Leak detection estimates to be realistic or \nscientific need to be based on actual historic performance data.”).  In this case, the operator’s \n2 2 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 23 of 42\nhistory did not inspire confidence: “PHMSA data shows Sunoco has experienced 276 incidents \nresulting in over $53 million in property damage from 2006–2016,” which one expert described \nas “one of the lower performing safety records of any operator in the industry for spills and \nreleases.”  Holmstrom Decl., ¶ 9. \nThe Corps focused its responses on defending the operator’s performance record itself \nrather than on justifying its decision to not incorporate that record into its analysis.  It did not \ndirectly reply to the comment that it had not explained “why historic shutdown discharges from \nother Sunoco/ETP pipeline incidents are not discussed or relevant.”  RAR 7503; see RAR 255.  \nAnd in response to the comment that “[a] valid risk analysis would recognize the history of the \noperator,” Holmstrom Decl., ¶ 9, it gave a verbatim repetition of its answer to the comment that \n“PHMSA data shows Sunoco has experienced 276 incidents resulting in over $53 million in \nproperty damage from 2006–2016.”  Id.; compare RAR 235–36, with RAR 136–37.  That \nresponse, which addressed only the safety record (and not the failure to consider it), noted that \n70% of the 276 incidents were confined to operators’ property, and “if an incident is confined to \nthe operators’ property, then it would not reach Lake Oahe or any other land or water used by the \nTribe.”  RAR 137.  It also noted that Sunoco had increased inspections of its pipelines in recent \nyears, see RAR 235, and stated that the commenter(s) “d[id] not identify a specific alternative \nmethodology or particular criteria or performance metrics that the Corps should have \nconsidered” or studies “that would cause the Corps to doubt its previous methodologies and data \nsupporting [its] conclusion to rely on ETP’s risk analysis.”  Id. \nThis response does not resolve the issues raised by the Tribes’ experts.  Two central \nconcerns went unaddressed: (1) the 30% of spills — about 80 of them — that were not limited to \noperator property; and (2) the criticism that the spill analysis should have incorporated the \n2 3 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 24 of 42\noperator’s record.  Indeed, the 70% of spills that occurred on operator property may still be \nrelevant to the latter point — for example, by showing how an operator’s practices might affect \nthe risk of a spill, length of detection time, and speed of response.  Finally, the Corps’ form \nlanguage about lack of “specific alternative methodology” and studies “that would cause the \nCorps to doubt its previous methodologies” — which appears, without alteration or explanation, \nin many of its responses, see, e.g., RAR 116, 119, 125, 130, 132 — is a non sequitur and does \nnothing to resolve the specific issues raised by the Tribes’ experts. \nc.  Winter Conditions \nAnother concern captured in expert comments was the Corps’ failure to consider the \nimpact of harsh North Dakota winters on response efforts in the event of a spill.  First, as \nOglala’s expert noted, “[S]ubfreezing temperatures during winter months will affect emergency \nresponse conditions during cleanup of a spill,” creating “significant difficulties that are not \npresent during other periods,” such as that “workers require more breaks and move slower due to \nthe bundling of clothing,” “daylight hours are shorter,” and “slip-trip-fall risk increases \nsignificantly.”  Earthfax Report at 7.  The Final EA, then, “should have quantified the effect of \nthese factors on response time and the subsequent impacts to human health and the \nenvironment.”  Id.   \nThe same expert pointed out, moreover, that the EA’s statement that “ice itself often \nserves as a natural barrier to the spread of oil” by “naturally contain[ing]” pockets of oil, see \nFinal EA at 39 (USACE_DAPL 71263), was an “oversimplification of oil recovery operations \nbeneath ice.”  Earthfax Report at 7.  In the first place, the report stated, ice makes it “difficult to \ndetermine where the largest pockets of oil may occur.”  Id.  Beyond that, “[t]he trapped oil may \nmove,” and “[i]ce will naturally break both on the river and on the reservoir, shifting recovery \n2 4 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 25 of 42\nlocations and increasing safety hazards.”  Id.  Because of the above-described complications of \nemergency response during the winter, moreover, “the time required to recover the oil will be \nincreased,” in turn “increas[ing] the extent to which the oil dissolves into the water.”  Id. at 8.  \nThe expert noted that the study cited by the Corps for the proposition that ice may benefit spill \nresponse also indicated the ways in which winter may simultaneously hinder it.  Id.  Ultimately, \nthe expert concluded, “[T]he EA should have presented a more serious, quantitative evaluation \nof the winter spill scenario” to ensure that the above-described factors “were properly \nevaluated.”  Id.  Standing Rock and its experts made a similar point that will be discussed in the \nfollowing section.  See infra Section III.A.2.d.iii. \nIn its response to Oglala’s expert, the Corps “agree[d]” that “the recovery of oil under ice \nis difficult.”  RAR 150.  The agency stated that it had considered winter conditions in the EA, \npointing to parts of the Final EA that the Oglala expert had criticized.  Id.  (citing Final EA at \n39).  It also stated that it had “mandated full-scale winter/ice exercises at . . . Lake Oahe as a \ncondition to the easement,” and that such exercises were “tentatively scheduled” for February \n2019.  Id.  Finally, it noted that “the Spill Model Report includes an assessment of the winter \nspill scenario of oil movement under the ice at Lake Oahe.”  Id. (citing RAR 8875).  That report \n“predicts that ice cover retards the movement of oil downstream by trapping the hydrocarbons in \nthe vicinity of the release location.”  RAR 151.  Thus, “ETP anticipates that the difficult winter \nconditions will be counterbalanced by the slower movement of the oil beneath the ice.”  Id. \nThe Court finds the Corps’ response insufficient to resolve the points raised by Oglala’s \nexpert.  To start, the agency’s reference to the Spill Model Report does not necessarily support \nETP’s prediction.  The report in fact found that, in simulations presuming 100% ice coverage, \n“[t]he ice effectively capped the oil, prevented evaporation, and resulted in enhanced dissolution, \n2 5 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 26 of 42\nall of which led to the maximum mass of oil in the water column.”  RAR 8875.  This is in line \nwith the expert’s prediction, see Earthfax Report at 8 (winter response complications will \n“increase the extent to which the oil dissolves into the water”), and does not support ETP’s \nconclusion that slow winter flow rates and the entrapment of oil pockets within the ice would \ncounteract the response difficulties presented by winter conditions.  The Corps’ reference, \nmoreover, to the parts of the EA that formed the basis of the expert’s criticism does not “resolve” \nthe scientific controversy.  Semonite, 916 F. Supp. 3d at 1085–86.  And practicing a winter \nresponse, while prudent and perhaps a good avenue for producing data as to how exactly winter \nconditions would delay response efforts, does not get to the point of addressing the concern that \nthe spill model does not currently take that kind of data into account. \nd.  Worst-Case Discharge \nThe largest area of scientific controversy, particularly during remand, was the worst-case-\ndischarge estimate for DAPL used in the spill-impact analysis.  As relevant here, the “worst case \ndischarge” is \n[t]he pipeline’s maximum release time in hours, plus the maximum \nshutdown response time in hours (based on historic discharge data \nor in the absence of such historic data, the operator's best estimate), \nmultiplied by the maximum flow rate expressed in barrels per hour \n(based on the maximum daily capacity of the pipeline), plus the \nlargest line drainage volume after shutdown of the line section(s) in \nthe response zone expressed in barrels (cubic meters). \n \n40 C.F.R. § 194.105(b)(1).  In other words, \nWCD = ((maximum release time + maximum shutdown response \ntime) × maximum flow rate) + largest line drainage volume \n \nThe idea, then, is to calculate the maximum amount of oil that could possibly leak from the \npipeline before a spill is detected and stopped.  The regulations further provide that the “[w]orst \n2 6 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 27 of 42\ncase discharge means the largest foreseeable discharge of oil . . . in adverse weather conditions.”  \n49 C.F.R. § 194.5. \n  One final introductory note.  Defendants argue that the PHMSA regulations cited above, \nwhich require calculation of a worst-case discharge, see 40 C.F.R. § 194.105(a), are not \nmandatory under NEPA and thus that the Corps need not have complied with them under that \nstatute.  See Corps Opp. to Standing Rock at 12 (citing Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens \nCouncil, 490 U.S. 332 (1989)).  But even if it was not required to do so, the agency did perform \nsuch calculations using 40 C.F.R. § 194.105(b)(1), which formed the basis for other conclusions \nabout the effects of a spill.  See id. at 12–13 (“[T]he Corps based some of its analysis on an \nextremely pessimistic “worst case discharge” figure derived from a Spill Model Report prepared \npursuant to PHMSA regulations.”).  Expert critiques raising serious doubts about the Corps’ \napplication of 40 C.F.R. § 194.105(b)(1) cannot be resolved by the fact that the agency may not \nhave been required to use this particular method in the first place.  Such a rule would immunize \nvast swaths of the Corps’ analysis from judicial or expert review.  Cf., e.g., Sierra Club v. Sigler, \n695 F.2d 957, 966 (5th Cir. 1983) (“The purpose of judicial review under NEPA is to ensure the \nprocedural integrity of the agency’s consideration of environmental factors in the EIS and in its \ndecision to issue permits.  If the agency follows a particular procedure, it is only logical to \nreview the agency’s adherence to that procedure, not to some altogether different one that was \nnot used.”).  Indeed, the Corps seemed to concede this at oral argument.  See Oral Arg. Tr. at \n8:25–9:4 (“The Court: . . . But since you did [a WCD analysis] here, shouldn’t that analysis be \nsubject to expert criticism?” Mr. Schifman: “Yes.  It is absolutely, just as any analysis that the \nCorps or any agency does is subject to expert criticism in the appropriate comment period or \nwhatever the case may be.  So, it was subject to that criticism, the Corps evaluated the criticism \n2 7 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 28 of 42\nin great depth . . . .”).  The Court, therefore, will consider expert critiques of the agency’s \ncalculation of the WCD as valid as any other critique. \nBoth before the easement was issued and during remand, experts raised myriad concerns \nwith the WCD used by the Corps to evaluate impacts of a potential DAPL spill.  While there \nwere many axes on which the WCD was challenged, the Court will discuss only three, finding \nthem sufficient to illustrate the unresolved scientific criticisms posed by the Tribes’ experts. \ni.  Leak-Detection Time \nIn addition to the concerns raised about whether the leak-detection system would function \nas claimed and that it was not designed to detect spills of less than 1%, see supra Section \nIII.A.2.a, experts also voiced strong criticisms of how quickly the Corps claimed the system \nwould catch a spill in its WCD analysis.  Standing Rock’s remand report commented that, while \n“[l]eak detection time is intended to be part of the WCD calculation formula,” RAR 7502, “no \nactual detection time was provided or utilized.”  RAR 7501.  (Recall that inclusion of detection \ntime was also one of the areas for improvement suggested by EPA in its comment on the Draft \nEA.  See USACE_DAPL 5746 (“recommend[ing] that the NEPA analysis describe . . . the time \nthat would be required for detection and shutoff of the pipeline”).)  Instead, “[t]he DAPL \ncalculation multiplied only the pump shutdown time by the maximum flow rate and added the \ndrain down volume.”  RAR 7501.  And far from being instantaneous, several experts noted, the \nworst-case leak-detection time was likely to be quite long.  See, e.g., RAR 1347 (commenting \nthat spills have been documented to continue undetected for “hours and sometimes weeks”); \nRAR 7689 (recommending that the WCD “release time assumption” be increased to 8 hours to \n“reflect[] the actual (proven in use) performance of the Leak Detection System and the track \nrecord of the pipeline operator to identify pipeline leaks in remote locations such as the Lake \n2 8 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 29 of 42\nOahe pipeline crossing”); Accufacts Report at 8 (“There appears to be considerable optimism in \nthe EA in assuming a quick recognition and response by control room personnel.”). \nThe Corps countered that, after “review[ing] the Lake Oahe Crossing Report numerous \ntimes resulting in numerous revisions by the applicant,” it had determined that the estimated total \ntime for leak detection, pump shutdown, and valve closure used in the WCD was “12.9 \nminute[s].”  RAR 254.  This was “based on the sum of the time to detect a break on the line and \nshutdown pumps (9 minutes) and the time to close the valves (3.9 minutes for standard valves).”  \nId.  The agency stated that the 9-minute portion, to which it had previously referred only as the \namount of time required to shut down mainline pumps, was in fact “not limited to pump \nshutdown time as it already includes 1 minute for time of detection.”  Id.  The 1-minute figure \nwas used because, “[a]ccording to ETP, the typical time of detection for a WCD rupture is less \nthan 1 minute.”  Id.; see also RAR 126 (“According to ETP, the LeakWarn CPM system is . . . \ncapable of providing rupture detection within 1 to 3 minutes.”); RAR 127 (same). \nThe Corps’ response does not resolve the issues raised by the experts’ comments on \nmany levels.  To start, the Court finds it difficult to make sense of the agency’s statement that its \nprevious “reference to the mainline pumps being shutdown within 9 minutes of detection is not \njust limited to pump shutdown time as it already includes 1 minute for time of detection.”  RAR \n254 (emphasis added).  The “reference” is in the spill-model analysis prepared for Dakota \nAccess by a third-party private consultant.  See RAR 14959–87.  There, the consultant explains \nthat the numbers “utilized in the DAPL computer model” allow 12.9 minutes for “Detection and \nShutdown*.”  RAR 14967.  Below that, the asterisk is explained: “*The mainline pumps are \nshutdown within 9 minutes of detection and the adjacent block valves are completely closed \nwithin an additional 3.9 minutes.”  Id.  Given that the latter sentence is meant to explain the \n2 9 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 30 of 42\nreference to “Detection and Shutdown,” the Corps’ statement that the 9 minutes include 1 \nminutes for detection appears unsupported.  The clear meaning of “within 9 minutes of \ndetection” is “9 minutes after detection.”  At best, the Corps’ statement that the 9 minutes \nincluded time for detection requires more explanation. \nBut even if the Court accepted, arguendo, that the WCD did allow one minute for \ndetection of the rupture, this does not resolve the serious concerns noted by experts about the \npropriety of using that number to calculate the WCD.  Most obviously, what DAPL’s leak-\ndetection system is “capable of,” RAR 126, 127, or what its “typical” performance would be, see \nRAR 254, are not necessarily the same as the figure that should be used in calculating its \n“maximum release time.”  40 C.F.R. § 194.105(b)(1).  The Corps itself betrays that one minute is \nnot the longest time it could take for a full-bore rupture to be detected, since it admits that \nDAPL’s leak-detection system is “capable of providing rupture detection within 1 to 3 minutes.”  \nRAR 126, 127.  The difference between one and three minutes is not insignificant when speaking \nof a full-bore rupture: the current maximum flow rate of the pipeline (only half of its full \ncapacity) is 600,000 barrels a day, which translates to over 416 barrels per minute. \nBut the difference between the one-minute number used in the WCD and the actual \nmaximum detection time may be much larger.  In response to the many experts who commented \nthat hours, rather than minutes, were more accurate figures for the WCD, the Corps merely \nrepeated that ETP had assured it that DAPL’s system was capable of detecting a full-bore rupture \none to three minutes after it occurred.  See RAR 127, 205, 254.  Of course, the fact that the \nsystem is capable of detecting a leak in this time does not mean that it will do so, only that it \nmay.  And in neither case does the one-to-three-minute timeframe purport to be the maximum \n3 0 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 31 of 42\nrelease time the WCD regulation requires and which the experts posited could well be hundreds \nof times longer than ETP’s number. \nii.  Shutdown Time \nOnce a leak is detected, the pipeline’s pumps must be shut down in order to stop the flow \nof oil.  In addition, valves help to “reduce the total volume of oil that could be released in the \nevent of a spill,” RAR 120, by blocking already-pumped oil before it reaches the point of a leak \nor rupture.  DAPL has two such valves near Lake Oahe; failure of these valves would cause the \ndischarge amount to skyrocket.  See RAR 121. \nRecall that the WCD regulations require calculation of “the maximum shutdown response \ntime in hours (based on historic discharge data or in the absence of such historic data, the \noperator’s best estimate).”  40 C.F.R. § 194.105(b)(1).  As noted above, the Corps used a total \ntime of 12.9 minutes for shutdown — 9 minutes for the pumps and 3.9 minutes for the valves.  \nSee RAR 254, 14967.  (As discussed, the 9-minute figure may also include 1 minute for leak \ndetection, thus leaving 8 minutes for pump shutdown.  See supra Section III.A.2.d.i.) \nHolmstrom contended that the 12.9 (or possibly 11.9) minutes “from leak detection to the \nclosing of the shut-off valves lacks supporting data and is not credible.”  Holmstrom Decl., ¶ 14.  \nThis number, he pointed out, was “based on a ‘best case’ scenario in which all systems function \nprecisely as intended,” including that “the correct decision and response is immediately initiated, \nand all equipment such as controls, sensors, pumps and valves function as intended.”  Id., ¶ 11.  \nSuch assumptions have no place in a worst-case scenario, experts said, since in reality “[m]ajor \nspill incidents typically occur with multiple system causes, when people, or equipment, or \nsystems do not function exactly as they are expected to.”  Id.  By failing to consider such \n3 1 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 32 of 42\neventualities, which is the modern standard for major accident prevention, the model had not, in \nfact, given a worst-case discharge analysis.  Id. \nThe Corps responded to this criticism by stating that the valves at Lake Oahe “have a \nclosure time of no greater than three (3) minutes.”  RAR 155 (quoting Final EA at 90); see RAR \n236–37 (referring to RAR 155–59).  The other parts of Holmstrom’s comment — i.e., those \nidentifying why assuming a perfect valve-closure time was unrealistic for a WCD — were \nomitted from the Corps’ response to the relevant paragraph of his declaration.  See RAR 236.  In \nits limited answer, moreover, the agency largely focused on the fact that its WCD figure was \nlower than an earlier, non-WCD spill-volume estimate made by Oglala’s expert.  See RAR 143–\n44; see also RAR 236 (referring to RAR 143–44, 151–55).  It further explained that, “during the \ndesign process, ETP evaluated the potential for incorrect operation and/or equipment failure at \nthe . . . pump stations[ and] mainline valves,” resulting in a design that is “established to \nsafeguard against incorrect operation using alarms and shutdowns to operate the pipeline within \nthe guidelines of [the PHMSA pipeline regulations].”  RAR 151.   \nThe Corps’ responses are, again, inadequate.  The agency’s statement that it takes no \nmore than three minutes for the valve-closure process to occur, see RAR 155 (quoting Final EA \nat 90), does not respond to the fact that human or machine error might result in the valves’ not \nbeginning the closure process at all (even after a leak has been detected).  See Holmstrom Decl., \n¶ 11; see also Oral Arg. Tr. at 10:4–5 (“It does assume the valves close as they are, you know, \nable to do.”); id. at 10:25–11:2 (“[T]here’s no portion of the remand analysis that directly says \nhere’s what happened [if] the valves never closed.”). \nThe Corps’ myopic preoccupation with the Earthfax estimate, moreover, which pervades \nits responses to expert comments about flaws in the WCD, see RAR 143–44; see also RAR 155, \n3 2 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 33 of 42\n175, 213, 225, 226, 236, 237, 247, 248, 249, 251, 253, 257, 258, 261 (referring reader to RAR \n143–44 for discussion of WCD), is not the coup de grace the agency believes it to be.  The spill-\nvolume estimate provided by Earthfax, which responded to the July 2016 EA, was not intended \nas a WCD estimate, see Earthfax Report at 3, since the Tribes had not yet been provided with the \namount or supporting calculations of the Corps’ WCD.  See Final EA at 91 (USACE_DAPL \n71315) (stating only that it had determined “a largest possible release volume” “[b]ased on a \nworst case discharge (WCD) scenario specific to . . . Lake Oahe”).  Even had Earthfax’s estimate \nbeen a WCD estimate, the fact that it was lower than that calculated by ETP and the Corps would \nnot resolve the many comments raising concrete disagreements about factual assumptions \nunderlying the numbers used for the DAPL WCD.   \nFinally, that human error was considered in the design of the pumps and/or valves does \nnot mean that it was considered in a worst-case-discharge analysis, nor does the Corps so \ncontend.  The Court does not understand the Corps to be claiming that the design of the pipeline \nprecludes all opportunities for human error between detection of a leak and triggering of valve \nclosure such that it need never be considered when determining a worst-case discharge.  Indeed, \nsuch a statement would recall assurances like “God himself could not sink this ship” (RMS \nTitanic), or “You’re confused, RBMK reactor cores don’t explode” (Chernobyl).  The Corps’ \nresponse, then, does not address the heart of the issue raised by experts — namely, that the \nnumbers used in the WCD assume, contrary to the idea of a worst-case discharge, that “correct \ndecision and response is immediately initiated, and all equipment such as controls, sensors, \npumps and valves function as intended.”  Holmstrom Decl., ¶ 11. \n3 3 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 34 of 42\niii.  Adverse Conditions \nA third criticism of the worst-case-discharge calculation was that it did not comply with \nthe portion of the WCD regulation that defines a WCD as “the largest foreseeable discharge of \noil . . . in adverse weather conditions.”  49 C.F.R. § 194.5 (emphasis added); see RAR 7503 \n(quoting same).  Standing Rock’s remand report expressed concern that “DAPL d[id] not address \nthe adverse weather impact on the WCD for the shutdown of the pipeline.”  RAR 7503–04.  In so \ndoing, the report continued, it ignored important complicating factors like “harsh ND winter \nconditions, deep snow, ice cover limitations on oil spill sighting, extreme cold and availability \nand operation of the . . . shutdown valves in extreme environments.”  RAR 7504.  The Corps did \nnot respond to the first comment, see RAR 253–54, and in response to the second, it referred to \nthe WCD response that, as noted above, focuses on a non-WCD estimate provided by Earthfax.  \nSee RAR 256 (referring to RAR 247–48, which in turn refers to RAR 143–44).  It also provided \ninformation on equipment and personnel that are in place to respond to emergency situations and \nstated that “ETP provided design temperature specifications to . . . manufacturers to ensure that \nboth high- and low-temperature concerns would be considered in the manufacturing of those \nmaterials and equipment.”  RAR 248.   \nAs noted above, the Corps’ reference to its catch-all WCD discussion that focuses largely \non an Earthfax estimate does not move the needle.  The fact that DAPL manufacturers \nincorporated low-temperature considerations into their designs runs into the same problem as \ndiscussed in the previous section: assurances that a product was designed to prevent certain \nproblems does not answer the question of what the worst-case discharge would be if those \nproblems occurred.  Again, the Court cannot find that these rebuttals do away with the \ncontroversy created by expert comments. \n3 4 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 35 of 42\n* * * \nAs shown at great length in the preceding analysis, the Corps has not “succeeded” in \n“resolv[ing] the controversy” created by “consistent and strenuous opposition, often in the form \nof concrete objections to the Corps’ analytical process and findings,” by “organizations with \nsubject-matter expertise.”  Semonite, 916 F.3d at 1086.  As in Semonite, “[t]his demonstrates the \n‘something more’ needed to show that the ‘effects on the quality of the human environment are \nlikely to be highly controversial.’”  Id. (quoting 40 C.F.R. § 1508.27(b)(4)).  The Corps has thus \nviolated NEPA by determining that an EIS was unnecessary even though one of the EIS-\ntriggering factors was met. \nThe Court acknowledges that in projects of this scope, it is not difficult for an opponent \nto find fault with many conclusions made by an operator and relied on by the agency.  But here, \nthere is considerably more than a few isolated comments raising insubstantial concerns.  The \nmany commenters in this case pointed to serious gaps in crucial parts of the Corps’ analysis — to \nname a few, that the pipeline’s leak-detection system was unlikely to work, that it was not \ndesigned to catch slow spills, that the operator’s serious history of incidents had not been taken \ninto account, and that the worst-case scenario used by the Corps was potentially only a fraction \nof what a realistic figure would be — and the Corps was not able to fill any of them. \nThe Court will therefore remand to the agency for it to complete such EIS.  See id. at \n1082 (“Implicating any one of the factors may be sufficient to require development of an EIS.”) \n(citing Grand Canyon Trust, 290 F.3d at 347); Grand Canyon Trust, 290 F.3d at 340 (“If any \n‘significant’ environmental impacts might result from the proposed agency action[,] then an EIS \nmust be prepared before agency action is taken.”) (quoting Peterson, 717 F.2d at 1415). \n3 5 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 36 of 42\n  Effect on Other Claims \nHaving directed the Corps to prepare an EIS because the pipeline’s “effects on the quality \nof the human environment are likely to be highly controversial,” 40 C.F.R. § 1508.27(b)(4), the \nCourt need not discuss the other two NEPA issues on which it remanded, see Standing Rock III, \n255 F. Supp. 3d at 132–34, 136–40, given that the remedy for them would be the same.  See \nSemonite, 916 F.3d at 1088 (remanding for preparation of EIS without discussing all grounds for \nappeal because, as here, “[i]n preparing its EIS, the Corps [would] have to revisit” those issues in \nany case) (citing American Iron & Steel Inst. v. EPA, 115 F.3d 979, 1008 (D.C. Cir. 1997)).   \nThis holding also obviates examination of three groups of consultation claims: \n(1) Yankton’s preserved claim that the Corps violated its consultation duties prior to granting the \neasement, see ECF No. 435-1 (Yankton Second MSJ) at 19–21; (2) Oglala’s similar, also-\npreserved claim that the Corps did not consult with it under the Mni Waconi Act prior to issuing \nthe EA and Mitigated FONSI; and (3) all Tribes’ claims that the Corps violated its consultation \nduties during remand.  Id. at 22–24; ECF No. 433-2 (Standing Rock Second MSJ) at 39–45; ECF \nNo. 434 (Oglala MSJ) at 16–17; ECF No. 436-1 (Cheyenne River Second MSJ) at 18–22.  This \nis because the Court has already found the decisions on which they claim the Corps failed to \nconsult — that is, the EA, the Mitigated FONSI, and the Remand Analysis — to be invalid.  In \nother words, a favorable holding by the Court on those other issues would not change the result \nin this case or offer the Tribes any greater relief than their success on the “highly controversial” \nissue already has. \nB.  NHPA \nThree of the Tribes also “ask[] the Court to revisit” its prior holding that their claims \nunder the National Historic Preservation Act were moot.  See Standing Rock Second MSJ at 46–\n3 6 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 37 of 42\n47; see also Yankton Second MSJ at 19 (adopting this portion of Standing Rock’s brief); \nCheyenne River Second MSJ at 17–18 (same).  The Court so found because the construction of \nthe pipeline under and around Lake Oahe had been completed, thus inflicting all damage that \ncould have been enjoined by a successful NHPA claim.  Standing Rock V, 301 F. Supp. 3d at \n61–64 (finding no “means by which the Court can still grant Plaintiffs ‘meaningful relief’”) \n(quoting Sierra Club v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 803 F.3d 31, 44 (D.C. Cir. 2015)).  The \nTribes now contend that, even if the claim is moot, it falls into “an exception to the mootness \ndoctrine for a controversy that is “capable of repetition, yet evading review.”  Kingdomware \nTechs. v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 1969, 1976 (2016) (quoting Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1, 17 \n(1998)).  The exception on which the Tribes rely “applies ‘only in exceptional situations’ where \n(1) ‘the challenged action [is] in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation of or \nexpiration,’ and (2) ‘there [is] a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party [will] be \nsubject to the same action again.”  Id. (alterations in original) (quoting Spencer, 523 U.S. at 17).  \nThe parties here dispute both parts of this test. \nThe Court need only address the second element to find that this case does not qualify for \nthe exception.  The Tribes argue that “the legal questions presented” are “all but certain to arise \nagain.”  Standing Rock Second MSJ at 47.  Standing Rock’s Historic Preservation Office, it \nstates, “receives over 250 requests to consult with federal agencies annually, and participates in \naround 50,” including “other crude oil pipelines proposed in the Tribe’s ancestral homelands that \nwill need Corps permits.”  Id.  Because of this, the Tribe states that “[i]t is possible, if not \nprobable, that such permitting would trigger the same dispute over the scope of § 106 review \n[under the NHPA] that happened here.”  Id. \n3 7 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 38 of 42\nThe Tribes misconstrue the scope of the exception.  “The ‘wrong’ that is, or is not, \n‘capable of repetition’ must be defined in terms of the precise controversy it spawns.”  PETA v. \nGittens, 396 F.3d 416, 422 (D.C. Cir. 2005).  Here, that would not include all consultations with \nall agencies, as the Tribes suggest.  Even narrowing the scope to the other pipelines mentioned \nby Standing Rock, the Tribe provides no evidence for its bare assertion that the same NHPA \nissue may arise in a hypothetical litigation over those pipelines.  Without any supporting facts, \nthe Court cannot call such a remote and unsubstantiated possibility a “reasonable expectation” \nthat the same harm will befall the Tribe again. \nIn any event, even if the Tribes’ NHPA claims were not moot, they would fail on the \nmerits for the reasons stated in the Court’s first Opinion in this case.  See Standing Rock I, 205 \nF. Supp. 3d at 8–10 (finding Standing Rock unlikely to succeed on merits of its NHPA claim).  \nThe Tribes attempt to resurrect only one of the three NHPA issues considered in that Opinion — \nviz., whether the Corps used too narrow a scope when evaluating whether DAPL would have an \nadverse effect on an identified historic property by “alter[ing], directly or indirectly, any of the \ncharacteristics of a historic property that qualify it for inclusion in the National Register” under \nNHPA regulations.  Standing Rock I, 205 F. Supp. 3d at 10 (quoting 36 C.F.R. § 800.5(a)(1)).  \nThe Court found the scope to be appropriate, rejecting the Tribes’ “sweeping claim that the \nCorps was obligated in permitting this narrow activity — i.e., certain construction activities in \nU.S. waterways — to consider the impact on potential cultural resources from the construction of \nthe entire pipeline.”  Id. at 30.  Guided by highly relevant and binding precedent, the Court \nrefused to find “that a federal agency with limited jurisdiction over specific activities related to a \npipeline is required to consider all the effects of the entire pipeline to be the indirectly or directly \n3 8 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 39 of 42\nforeseeable effects of the narrower permitted activity.”  Id. at 31; see also id. (citing Sierra Club \nv. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 803 F.3d 31, 34–35 (D.C. Cir. 2015)). \n  The Court now affirms this holding at the summary-judgment stage, finding that the \nTribes’ arguments lack merit for the same reasons stated in that Opinion.  See id. at 30–32.  Even \nif correct that the controversy is not moot, Plaintiffs would not prevail on this count. \nC.  Mni Waconi Act \nLast up is the claim brought by Oglala under the Mni Waconi Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. \n100-516, 102 Stat. 2566.  (Mni wiconi means “water is life” in Lakota.)  The Act declares that \n“the United States has a trust responsibility to ensure that adequate and safe water supplies are \navailable to meet the economic, environmental, water supply, and public health needs of the Pine \nRidge Indian Reservation,” id. § 2(a)(4), which is home to the Oglala Sioux Tribe.  It directs the \nSecretary of the Interior to, among other things, “plan, design, construct, operate, maintain, and \nreplace a municipal, rural, and industrial water system, to be known as the Oglala Sioux Rural \nWater Supply System.”  Id. § 3(a).  The Act further provides that “[t]itle to the [OSRWSS] shall \nbe held in trust for the Oglala Sioux Tribe by the United States.”  Id. § 3(e).  After the passage of \nthe Act, the Corps duly created the OSRWSS as part of the Mni Waconi Project.  The OSRWSS \nhas its water intake 205 miles down the Missouri River from where DAPL now crosses Lake \nOahe.  See RAR 92; USACE_ESMT 1358–59. \nOglala argues that the Act imposes a continuing fiduciary duty on the Corps to “provid[e] \nclean drinking water to residents of the Reservation and ensur[e] that the OSRWSS is maintained \nand preserved for that purpose and others,” Oglala MSJ at 14, and that by failing to consider the \neffects of the pipeline’s Lake Oahe crossing on the Mni Waconi Project, the United States \n(through the agency) has breached that duty.  The Corps rejoins that Oglala overstates the scope \n3 9 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 40 of 42\nof the trust duty, that any duty was not breached by the approval of a project so far upstream \nfrom the OSRWSS, and that any breach of duty was remediated during the remand.  The Court \nwill first consider the nature of the duty owed to Oglala before taking up whether there has been \na violation of such duty. \nAs the Court has had occasion to note previously in this case, “The trust obligations of \nthe United States to the Indian tribes are established and governed by statute rather than the \ncommon law.”  Standing Rock III, 255 F. Supp. 3d at 143 (alteration omitted) (quoting United \nStates v. Jicarilla Apache Nation, 564 U.S. 162, 165 (2011)).  In order to bring a breach-of-trust \nclaim, therefore, Oglala “must identify a substantive source of law that establishes specific \nfiduciary or other duties, and allege that the Government has failed faithfully to perform those \nduties.”  United States v. Navajo Nation, 537 U.S. 488, 506 (2003).  It is not enough that a \nstatute places land in trust for the benefit of a tribe — it must also impose a “correlative duty of \nmanagement” over the trust corpus in order to give rise to a cause of action.  El Paso Natural Gas \nCo. v. United States, 750 F.3d 863, 897 (D.C. Cir. 2014). \nThe parties agree that the Mni Waconi Act does impose a trust duty on the United States, \nsee ECF No. 450 (Corps Opp. to Oglala MSJ) at 7, but they disagree as to the scope of that duty.  \nWhereas the Tribe believes that the Act’s direction to “maintain . . . a municipal, rural, and \nindustrial water system,” § 3(a) (emphasis added), requires the Corps to continue to provide \n“adequate and safe water supplies” for the reservation, id. § 2(a)(4), the agency argues that this \nduty is “cabined by limited Congressional appropriations” as set out in the Act.  See Corps Opp. \nto Oglala at 7 (citing Mni Waconi Act § 10(a)–(b)).  Rather than creating a “perpetual trust \nobligation,” the Corps argues, the Act limits any duty to the activities for which it provides \n4 0 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 41 of 42\nfunding.  Id. at 8; see also id. at 7 (citing Cobell v. Salazar, 573 F.3d 808, 811 (D.C. Cir. 2009); \nthen citing Mni Waconi Act § 6(b)). \nThe Court need not determine the precise contours of the United States’ trust duty toward \nOgalala with respect to the OSRWSS because, regardless of scope, the Corps has not breached \nthat duty by granting an easement under Lake Oahe for DAPL.  The Tribe does not dispute that, \nat present, the OSRWSS does constitute an “adequate and safe water suppl[y].”  Mni Waconi \nAct § 2(a)(4).  The possibility of a future spill, which this Court has accepted is low, see \nStanding Rock III, 255 F. Supp. 3d at 127, does not render the drinking water inadequate and the \nGovernment’s duty breached.  This is particularly true since the OSRWSS takes its water from a \npoint 205 miles downstream from where DAPL passes under Lake Oahe.  See RAR 92; \nUSACE_ESMT 1358–59. \nThe Tribe rejoins that the Corps owed it a fiduciary duty to consider the impacts of the \nLake Oahe crossing on the Mni Waconi Project.  See Oglala MSJ at 13 (citing Nw. Sea Farms \nInc. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 931 F. Supp. 1515, 1520 (W.D. Wash 1996); then citing \nMuckleshoot Indian Tribe v. Hall, 698 F. Supp. 1504, 1523 (W.D. Wash 1988)).  But the cases it \ncites, which in any case are not binding on this Court, discuss treaty rights, not statutory rights, \nand only the latter are at issue here.  Even if there were a duty to consider the project’s effects on \nthe OSRWSS, moreover, the Court agrees with the Corps that, at the very least, it has done so \nduring the remand.  See, e.g., RAR 94 (finding the OSRWSS unlikely to be affected because of \nthe predicted “near zero” concentration of hydrocarbons in water many miles upstream of the \nOSRWSS intake), 95 tbl.II-6 (listing predicted hydrocarbon concentrations at increasing points \ndownstream of the DAPL crossing).  The Court, accordingly, finds that the Corps has adequately \nperformed any fiduciary duty imposed by the Mni Waconi Act. \n4 1 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 496   Filed 03/25/20   Page 42 of 42\nD.  Remedy \nThe Corps must prepare an EIS, but what is the status of the easement — and, ultimately, \nthe oil — in the meantime?  As it has done before in this case, the Court will order the parties to \nbrief the issue of whether the easement should be vacated during the remand.  See Standing Rock \nIII, 255 F. Supp. 3d at 147–48.  Certainly, “vacating a rule or action promulgated in violation of \nNEPA is the standard remedy.”  Humane Soc’y of U.S. v. Johanns, 520 F. Supp. 2d 8, 37 \n(D.D.C. 2007) (citing Am. Bioscience, Inc. v. Thompson, 269 F. 3d 1077, 1084 (D.C. Cir. \n2001)).  Because “[s]uch a move” would “carry serious consequences that a court should not \nlightly impose,” Standing Rock III, 255 F. Supp. 3d at 147, the Court will ask the parties for \ndedicated briefing on the subject, which neither side addressed with much conviction in this \nround of briefing.  As before, “[t]his is not surprising — absent knowledge of whether or to what \nextent the Court would remand, the parties were unable to fully address the Allied-Signal factors \nin their summary-judgment briefs.”  Id. (citing Allied-Signal, Inc. v. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory \nComm’n, 988 F.2d 146, 150–51 (D.C. Cir. 1993)).  The Court will therefore allow the parties to \nargue the issue of vacatur with the benefit of knowing the basis for remand set out above. \nIV.  Conclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant in part and deny in part the Tribes’ \nMotions for Summary Judgment and grant in part and deny in part the Corps’ corresponding \nCross-Motion for Summary Judgment.  A contemporaneous Order so stating will issue this day. \n/s/ James E. Boasberg \nJAMES E. BOASBERG \nUnited States District Judge \nDate:  March 25, 2020 \n4 2 ",

Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(d), Plaintiffs Yankton Sioux Tribe and Robert \nFlying  Hawk  (together,  “Plaintiffs”  or  “Tribe”)  hereby  file  this  supplemental  complaint  in \nconnection with federal actions relating to the Dakota Access Pipeline (“DAPL”).  DAPL is a \n1,168-mile-long crude oil pipeline that crosses under the Missouri River at Lake Oahe. \n2.  This supplemental complaint addresses events that have occurred since this Court \ngranted in part the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s (“SRST”) Motion for Partial Summary Judgment \non June 14, 2017.  Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 255 F. Supp. 3d 101 \n(D.D.C. 2017).  In that decision, this Court found unlawful and remanded the environmental \n1 \n \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 379-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 2 of 22\nanalysis  conducted  by  Defendant  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  (“Corps”)  for  additional \nconsideration on specific issues.  It further admonished the Corps to give “serious consideration” \nto the errors identified in its decision, warning that compliance with the law “cannot be reduced to \na bureaucratic formality, and the Court expects the Corps not to treat remand as an exercise in \nfilling out the proper paperwork post hoc.”  Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, 282 F. Supp. 3d at 109. \n3.  The remand process is now complete and has resulted in another final decision by \nthe Corps.   \n4.  Regrettably but not surprisingly, the Corps ignored this Court’s admonition to \napproach the remand with an open mind.  Instead, it treated the remand as a post hoc effort to \njustify its unlawful decision to circumvent an adequate review of the pipeline and its impacts on \nthe Tribe and the Tribe’s rights.   \n5.  In the remand decision, the Corps, without qualification, affirmed its original \ndecision to authorize the pipeline without the comprehensive environmental review required by \nthe National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”).   \n6.  Rather than “serious consideration” of the remand issues, the Corps produced a \none-sided analysis that failed to provide a fair or transparent review of the matters this Court \nremanded to it. \n7.  This supplemental complaint challenges the Corps’ remand decision, which is a \nfinal agency action subject to review by this Court under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 \nU.S.C. § 701, et seq. (“APA”), and the process underlying it.  As directed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(d), \nthis supplemental complaint focuses on the additional background and claims that have arisen \nsince the Tribe’s Original Complaint was filed. \n2 \n \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 379-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 3 of 22\n8.  The Tribe seeks a declaration that the Corps’ decision to affirm its original \ndecision without a comprehensive environmental review and adequate consultation with the Tribe \nwas arbitrary, capricious, and in violation of the APA, NEPA, and the Department of Defense’s \n(“DOD”) and the Corps’ tribal consultation policies.  The Tribe asks that the Corps’ approval of \nthe Mineral Leasing Act (“MLA”) easement authorizing construction of DAPL under Lake Oahe \nbe vacated pending full compliance with the NEPA and the APA. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n9.  This supplemental complaint presents claims under the APA, which authorizes a \nfederal court to find unlawful and set aside any final agency action that is “arbitrary and capricious, \nan abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706.  Plaintiffs bring \nthese claims on their own behalf and on behalf of the Yankton Sioux Tribe’s members. \n10.  Jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. § 1362 (“district courts shall have original \njurisdiction of all civil actions, brought by any Indian Tribe or band with a governing body duly \nrecognized by the Secretary of the Interior, wherein the matter in controversy arises under the \nConstitution, laws, or treaties of the United States”); § 1331 (general federal question jurisdiction); \n§ 2201 (declaratory relief); § 2202 (injunctive relief). \n11.  Venue in this district is appropriate under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because it is the \ndistrict in which the defendant resides and in which “a substantial part of the events or omissions \ngiving rise to the claim occurred.”  No party has contested jurisdiction or venue during this \nlitigation to date. \nPARTIES \n9.  Plaintiff Yankton Sioux Tribe is a federally recognized Indian tribe that is not \nincorporated under the Indian Reorganization Act, but rather, is governed by a duly adopted \n3 \n \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 379-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 4 of 22\nconstitution and by-laws through its General Council. The Tribe is a member of the Oceti Sakowin \n(“Seven Council Fires,” also known as the Great Sioux Nation).  Plaintiff Yankton Sioux Tribe \nbrings this suit on its own behalf and as parens patriae on behalf of its members to protect its \nmembers’ cultural, historic, and environmental interests in its 1851 Treaty territory, its ancestral \nlands, and the Yankton Sioux Indian Reservation. \n10.  Plaintiff  Robert  Flying  Hawk  is  the  Chairman  of  the  Yankton  Sioux  Tribe \nBusiness and Claims Committee.  The claims against Defendants are made in Plaintiff  Flying \nHawk’s personal and official capacity as parens patriae on behalf of the enrolled members of the \nYankton Sioux Tribe. \n32.  Defendant  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  is  a  federal  agency  charged with \nadministering and enforcing Sections 404 and 408 of the Clean Water Act regarding the discharge \nof dredged or fill material into waters of the United States and issuing leases under the MLA. \n32.  Defendant Colonel John Henderson was the Omaha District Commander for the \nCorps until July 26, 2017, when he was replaced by Colonel John Hudson.  Until July 26, 2017, \nhe oversaw the Corps’ consultation with the Tribe during the remand process. \n33.  Defendant Colonel John Hudson, current Omaha District Commander, oversaw \nthe Corps’ consultation with the Tribe during the remainder of the remand process. \n34.  Lieutenant General Todd Semonite, Colonel Anthony Mitchell, U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service, and Director Dan Ashe are named defendants in the Tribe’s original complaint.  \nUpon  information  and  belief,  the  supplemental  claims  raised  herein  do  not  involve  these \nDefendants. \n35.  Intervenor-Defendant Dakota Access, LLC is a limited liability company formed \nto construct and own the Dakota Access Pipeline (“DAPL”).  Energy Transfer Partners, L.P., \n4 \n \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 379-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 5 of 22\nSunoco Logistics Partners, L.P., and Phillips 66 are the beneficial owners of Dakota Access, LLC. \n36.  By filing this action, the Tribe does not waive its sovereign immunity and does not \nconsent to suit as to any claim, demand, offset, or cause of action of the United States, its agencies, \nofficers, agents, or any other person or entity in this or any other court. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nI.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n37.  The Tribe filed this action on September 8, 2016, raising multiple statutory and \ncommon law claims against the Corps, Lieutenant General Semonite, Colonel Henderson, Colonel \nMitchell, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Defendant Ashe regarding permits and other \nauthorizations granted to Dakota Access, LLC that were necessary to construct DAPL.   \n38.  On March 17, 2017, this Court issued an order consolidating the Tribe’s action \nwith Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 16-1534 and Oglala Sioux Tribe \nv. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 17-267. \n39.  DAPL is a crude oil pipeline that runs approximately 1,168 miles from North \nDakota, through South Dakota and Iowa, and into Illinois.  \n40.  DAPL required multiple federal easements, authorizations, and permissions from \nmultiple federal agencies to construct, operate, and maintain the pipeline.  On July 27, 2016, the \nCorps’ Omaha District issued a Final EA and Finding of No Significant Impact (“FONSI”) and \nauthorized several permits.   \n41.  At that time, however, the Corps did not authorize an easement to cross federally \nowned land at Lake Oahe.  On September 9, 2016, the Corps stated that it would not authorize \nDAPL construction on this land until it could determine whether it would need to reconsider prior \ndecisions regarding the Lake Oahe site. \n5 \n \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 379-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 6 of 22\n42.  After several months of additional consideration regarding the easement, the \nCorps announced on December 4, 2016, that the MLA easement would not be granted without a \ncomprehensive  analysis of alternatives and impacts.  Shortly thereafter, the Corps formally \ninitiated that process with a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement (“EIS”), \nrequesting public input on the critical issues and scope of the EIS.  \n43.  A new U.S. President was inaugurated on January 20, 2017.  On January 24, the \nnew  President  executed  a  “Presidential  Memorandum”  directing  the  Corps  to  abandon  the \nDecember 4 decision and the EIS process.   \n44.  The Corps shortly thereafter issued the MLA easement at Lake Oahe without \nadditional environmental review, and formally terminated the EIS process.   \n45.  Construction of the pipeline under Lake Oahe resumed immediately. \n46.  Around this time, the SRST filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on its \nNEPA, Treaty, and APA claims against the Corps.  The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe (“CRST”) \njoined the SRST’s Motion and filed its own Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on additional \nclaims. \n47.  This Court issued its opinion on the SRST and CRST’s partial summary judgment \nmotions on June 14, 2017.  While rejecting some of the tribes’ claims, the Court agreed that the \nCorps’ analysis of three specific issues was arbitrary, capricious, and in violation of NEPA.  First, \nthe Court ruled that the Corps failed to adequately analyze the impacts of an oil spill on hunting \nand fishing rights.  Second, the Court held that the Corps’ consideration of environmental justice \nimplications of the permit was flawed.  Finally, the Court held that the Corps failed to address the \nsignificant scientific “controversy” around its dismissal of oil spill risk and impacts.  The Court \nremanded the analysis back to the Corps for further consideration in light of its decision. \n6 \n \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 379-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 7 of 22\n48.  This Court subsequently directed the finalization of oil spill response plans, \ncompletion of a third-party audit, and public reporting on various measures.  Standing Rock Sioux \nTribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 2017 WL 6001726, at *2 (D.D.C. 2017). \nII.  CONSULTATION POLICIES \n49.  Former President William J. Clinton promulgated Executive Order No. 13175 \n(“E.O. 13175”) on November 9, 2000.  E.O. No. 13175, Sec. 2, 65 Fed. Reg.  67249 (November \n9, 2000).  E.O. 13175 reaffirmed the United States’ government-to-government relationship with \ntribes as well as the United States’ trust responsibility to tribes.  Id. \n50.  E.O. 13175 required all agencies to establish procedures to ensure meaningful and \ntimely consultation with tribes during the development of regulatory policies that have tribal \nimplications.  Id.  \n51.  DOD Instruction 4710.02 regarding Interactions with Federally-Recognized Tribes \n(“DOD Instruction”) was issued in 2006 in order to implement E.O. 13175, as well as DOD \npolicies and directives.1  \n52.  The DOD Instruction applies to “[a]ll DoD operations, activities, and installations \nthat require interactions with tribes.”  DOD Instruction at 1.   Pursuant to the DOD Instruction, \nagencies “shall consult with tribes whenever proposing an action that may have the potential to \nsignificantly affect protected tribal resources, tribal rights, or Indian lands.”  Id. at 4.  \n53.  The  DOD  Instruction’s  Guidance  for  Consultation  with  Tribes  specifically \nacknowledges that “[c]onsultation may require multiple meetings over a period of months.”   \n                                                 \n1 The DOD issued a new DOD Instruction effective on September 24, 2018.  Because this DOD \nInstruction was not effective during the remand, the 2006 DOD Instruction is the version quoted \nherein. \n7 \n \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 379-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 8 of 22\n54.  In  2012,  the  Corps  formalized  its  tribal  consultation  procedures  (“Corps \nConsultation Policy”).  In its Corps Consultation Policy, the Corps defined consultation as: \nOpen, timely, meaningful, collaborative and effective deliberative communication \nprocess that emphasizes trust, respect and shared responsibility.  To the extent \npracticable and permitted by law, consultation works toward mutual consensus and \nbegins at the earliest planning stages . . . ; an active an respectful dialogue \nconcerning  actions  taken  by  the  USACE  that  may  significantly  affect  tribal \nresources, tribal rights (including treaty rights) or Indian lands. \n \nCorps Consultation Policy at 2. \n \n55.  The Corps Consultation Policy further provides that the Corps “will ensure that it \naddresses Tribal concerns regarding protected Tribal resources, tribal rights (including treaty \nrights) and Indian lands.”  Id. at 3. \n56.  Additionally,  the  Corps  acknowledged  that,  “[i]n  recognition  of  the  varied \norganizations and customs of different Tribes, written protocols for consultation procedures may \nbe considered and implemented at the local level with a specific Tribe.”  Id. at 4.   \n57.  The Tribal Consultation Policy was in fact kept “purposefully general in nature \nbecause each of the 565 federally recognized American Indian and Alaska Native Tribe are distinct \nand separate governments, requiring a consultation process that may be completely unique to \nthem.”  Mem. from U.S. Army Commanding Lieutenant General to U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs \n(Nov. 1, 2012). \nIII.  CONSULTATION DURING THE REMAND PROCESS. \n58.  The Tribe repeatedly attempted to engage with the Corps in good faith during the \nremand process, submitting many requests for information and for meetings, and submitting \ninformation intended to inform the Corps’ analysis of the remand issues.  \n8 \n \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 379-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 9 of 22\n59.  The Corps mistakenly sent the Tribe letters requesting information from the Oglala \nSioux Tribe in September, October, and November.2  In response to each of these letters, the Tribe \nexplained that, while it could not provide information on behalf of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, it \n“intend[ed] to participate to the fullest extent possible in the remand process.”   \n60.  In its very first response, the Tribe enclosed the Ihanktonwan Consultation Wo’ope \n(“Consultation Protocols”), the Tribe’s protocols for government-to-government consultation and \nrequested that the Corps proceed to consult with the Tribe in accordance with those protocols.  The \nTribe repeated this request in the subsequent letters. \n61.  On April 20, 2018, the Tribe wrote to the Corps, inviting it  to meet for a \npreconsultation on May 31, 2018, explaining that the “purpose of this preconsultation meeting \nshall be to exchange preliminary information and for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to provide \nan overview of the project at issue and the remand process.”  \n62.  The Tribe also once again attached its Consultation Protocols to the April 20, 2018 \nletter. \n63.  Responding to the letter in a May 27, 2018 email, Thomas Tracy, District Counsel \nfor the Corps Omaha District, stated that he “appreciate[s] the provision of the protocols from the \nTribe  that  will  help  advise  the  Corps  of  Engineers  of  the  general  standards  expected  for \nconsultation with the Yankton Sioux Tribe,” and that “[the Consultation Protocols are] an area \nwhere the parties may not always agree, but we certainly can aspire to reach an understanding, if \nnot an agreement.”  However, despite repeated prompting by the Tribe’s counsel, neither Mr. Tracy \nnor any other Corps official or employee has provided the Tribe with its final concerns or proposed \n                                                 \n2 On December 14, 2017, the Corps submitted a letter to this Court dated October 20, 2017 \nrequesting information from the Tribe to assist it in the remand process.  The Tribe was not aware \nof this letter until it was submitted to the Court on December 14, 2017. \n9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 379-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 10 of 22\nchanges to the Consultation Protocols or indicated that the Consultation Protocols would not be \nfollowed.   \n64.  Responding to an email from the Tribe’s counsel sent July 25, 2018, Mr. Tracy \nstated that “[t]he protocols being [sic] further discussed within the Corps of Engineers.  I will \nprovide a more detailed response when I can.”  To date, no such response has been provided.   \n65.  Despite the Tribe’s efforts, no good faith effort has been made by the Corps to \nresolve this “important” matter.3 \n66.  On May 30, 2018, the Tribe wrote to the Corps to reiterate that the May 31, 2018 \nmeeting was not a consultation but a preliminary informational session which would give the \nCorps the opportunity to provide an overview of the remand process and the issues on remand.  \nThe Tribe also explained that the Tribe’s General Council, its governing body, would not be \nattending the information session, a prerequisite to consultation under the Consultation Protocols. \n67.  When Colonel Hudson responded to the letter, he noted that he understood that \nthe entire General Council for the Tribe would not be attending the session.  Notably, he did not \nmention that the Corps might later assert that this meeting constituted the required consultation \nwith the Tribe’s government.   \n68.  During the May 31, 2018 informational session, Chairman Flying Hawk and \nothers repeatedly stressed that the Tribe had additional issues it would need to address with the \nCorps following the informational session.   \n                                                 \n3 Upon receipt of the Consultation Protocols in 2016, Charles Smith of the Office of the Assistant \nSecretary of the Army, which oversees the Corps, described the Consultation Protocols as an \n“important protocol,” stating that he would ensure that it was broadly distributed “from HQ to \nDivision to Omaha District.” \n10 \n \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 379-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 11 of 22\n69.  For example, Faith Spotted Eagle, Chair of the Ihanktonwan Treaty Steering \nCommittee, explained at the end of the session that “we absolutely need another meeting because \nwe have got like 3 pages of questions that we haven’t gotten to,” to which a representative from \nthe Corps responded “Okay we will work on that.”   \n70.  Following the meeting, the Tribe sent the Corps a letter stating that the Tribe felt \n“this preliminary meeting went well and looks forward to continuing conversations with you, \nleading up to actual consultation.” \n71.  Even though the Tribe had made it very clear that it had additional issues to discuss \nfollowing the informational session, when the Corps responded to the Tribe’s letter two months \nlater, it did not ask the Tribe for any additional information or seek a consultation meeting.  Instead \nthe Corps simply told the Tribe that it “expect[ed] to finish by August 10, 2018.”   \n72.  Finally, throughout the remand process, the Corps largely refused to provide any \nof the critical information requested by the Tribe.  For example, the Tribe asked the Corps twice \nto share with it a copy of the oil spill model, the data used in the model, and any associated report, \nso that the Tribe could review it and provide input to the Corps as to its reliability and accuracy.  \nThe Corps never provided this information. \nIV.  THE CORPS’ CONCLUSION OF THE REMAND PROCESS \n73.  The Corps concluded the remand process on August 31, 2018, with a two-page \n“memorandum for record” documenting the Corps’ position that there was no need to formally \nreconsider its July 2016 Environmental Assessment (“EA”) and FONSI, and stating that an EIS \nwas not necessary.   \n74.  As to the three flaws identified by this Court, the Corps asserted that its review of \nthe potential impacts to hunting and fishing resources “did not reveal any significant impacts \n11 \n \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 379-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 12 of 22\nbecause the risk of an incident is low and any impacts to hunting and fishing resource [sic] will be \nof limited scope and duration.”   \n75.  As to the issue of environmental justice, the Corps asserted that the Oahe crossing \n“does not result in disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on \nminority populations, including Tribes, and low-income populations.”   \n76.  As to the issue of whether the Corps’ conclusions were likely to be “highly \ncontroversial,” the Corps incorrectly characterized the tribes’ input as simply being opposed to the \npipeline authorizations, stating that they did not “provide information that a substantial dispute \nexists as to the size, nature, or effect of the federal action.” \n77.  The  Memorandum  stated  that  the  rationale  supporting  these  findings  was \ncontained in the “enclosed document” and in the administrative record.  However, at the time the \nMemorandum was filed, no such “document” was enclosed or provided to the Tribe or the Court.  \nIt was not until October 1, 2018, that undersigned counsel was provided with a copy of the analysis \nsupporting  the  remand  decision  (“Remand  Analysis”),  which  was  subject  to  confidentiality \nrestrictions and could not be shared publicly.  On October 24, 2018, a redacted version of the \nremand analysis was made available for the public. \n78.  The Remand Analysis mostly reiterates the flawed conclusions of the Corps’ \nearlier analyses.   \n79.  For example, the Remand Analysis continues to calculate risk based on generic \nnational statistics, without regard to any of the unique risk factors of this project in this place, in \nlight of DAPL’s parent companies’ abysmal safety record.   \n80.  Like the prior EA, the Remand Analysis fails to grapple with extensive evidence \nthat the risks of slow, undetectable leaks is higher than it claims.   \n12 \n \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 379-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 13 of 22\n81.  The Remand Analysis ignores Dakota Access’ failure to utilize vital industry \npipeline safety standards despite the Corps claim in the EA to do so.   \n82.  Similarly, it continues to underestimate the impacts of an oil spill (which rely on \nits erroneous worst case discharge (“WCD”) analysis and risk estimates) and the elevated hazards \nof Bakken crude oil, and to overestimate the ability of responders to clean it up—all of which place \nemergency responders at risk. \n83.  A key shortcoming of the remand analysis is its failure to provide a lawfully \nadequate WCD.  In the remand analysis, the Corps essentially repeats the identical WCD from \nbefore the remand.   \n84.  Furthermore, the Corps fails to address the impact of circumstances listed in the \n49 C.F.R. § 194.5 definition of WCD, including adverse weather conditions.   \n85.  The  WCD  also  fails  to  implement  the  formula  required  by  49  C.F.R.  § \n194.105(b)(1), including consideration of the operator’s “historic discharge[s]” and its conclusion \nis dependent upon the Corps’ use of unrealistic shutdown times that bear little resemblance to \nmultiple real-world pipeline incidents.   \n86.  As noted, Dakota Access’ parent companies have among the industry’s worst \nsafety records, which by law should have been considered in developing the WCD, but was not. \n87.  The remand also ignored critical findings regarding Dakota Access’ failure to \ncomply with easement conditions; for example, the requirement of supplying independent power \nto shutoff valves near Lake Oahe and an undocumented spill incident. \n88.  The remand analysis also calculates the risk and impacts of an oil spill based on \nDAPL’s original capacity.  While the remand process was underway, however, Dakota Access’ \n13 \n \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 379-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 14 of 22\ncorporate parents publicly announced their intention to expand the capacity of DAPL by 100,000 \nbarrels a day.   \n89.  On information and belief, expansion could take place without additional Corps \nauthorization at Lake Oahe.  The Corps conducted no new analyses to respond to DAPL’s \nannounced intention to increase capacity by 100,000 barrels a day.  \n90.  Such an increase fundamentally alters both the risks of a spill as well as its \npotential impacts.  \n91.  As such, the remand analysis is already out of date and inapplicable to anticipated \nfuture operations of the pipeline. \n92.  The above examples are intended as illustrations of the flaws in the Corps’ \nanalysis, not a comprehensive list. \n93.  These and other fundamental flaws in the Corps’ estimate of the risk and impact \nof oil spills infect all three of the remand topics.   \n94.  For example, the Remand Analysis dismisses the potential impacts to fish and \ngame by reasoning that the risk of an oil spill is low and its impacts manageable—a conclusion \nthat is fundamentally flawed due to the underestimated WCD and the other reasons discussed \nabove.   \n95.  The Remand Analysis incorporates and asserts that it is based upon on a number \nof technical documents that are cited throughout the document.   \n96.  For example, the “Spill Model Report” is a technical document describing the \nresults of various oil spill scenarios.  Neither this document nor any other technical document was \never made available to the Tribe during the course of the remand, despite many requests.  Nor have \n14 \n \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 379-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 15 of 22\nthey been made available to the Tribe or its counsel subsequent to the finalization of the Remand \nAnalysis, again despite requests. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nI.  FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF – VIOLATION OF NEPA \n97.  Plaintiffs hereby allege and incorporate and restate all previous paragraphs of this \ncomplaint and of their Original Complaint. \n98.  Under NEPA, federal agencies are required to prepare an EIS for “major Federal \nactions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.”  42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C). \n99.  Binding Council of Environmental Quality (“CEQ”) regulations further define \nwhether impacts are “significant” enough to warrant a full EIS, requiring consideration of both \n“context” (i.e., the various scales, regions, and interests affected by the action) and “intensity” (i.e., \nthe “severity of the impact”).  40 C.F.R. § 1508.27.  With respect to the latter, the regulations lay \nout several factors that are to be considered.  Examples of these criteria include: “the degree to \nwhich  the  proposed  action  affects  public  health  or  safety;”  “unique  characteristics  of  the \ngeographic area such as proximity to historic or cultural resources . . . ;” the degree to which the \neffects on the environment “are likely to be highly controversial,” are “highly uncertain” or \n“involve unique or unknown risks;” and “the degree to which the action . . . may cause loss or \ndestruction of significant scientific, cultural, or historical resources.” Id. \n100.  In June of 2017, the Court found “significant” flaws in the Corps’ analysis of the \nrisk and impacts of its decision to authorize DAPL underneath Lake Oahe, and ordered the Corps \nto conduct a remand to give “serious consideration” to those flaws.  Mem. Op. 28, ECF No. 371-\n1.   \n15 \n \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 379-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 16 of 22\n101.  By concluding the remand by affirming its original decision, the Corps acted \narbitrarily, capriciously, contrary to the evidence before it, and in violation of NEPA and the CEQ \nregulations and contrary to the APA.   \n102.  The Corps also acted arbitrarily, capriciously, and in violation of NEPA and the \nCEQ regulations by failing to meaningfully engage with the Tribe by providing information so \nthat the Tribe could provide input during the remand. \nII.  SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF – VIOLATION OF DUTY TO CONSULT \n \n103.  Plaintiffs hereby allege, incorporate, and restate all previous paragraphs of this \ncomplaint and of their Original Complaint. \n104.  DOD  and  Corps  policy  and  instructions  required  the  Corps  to  engage  in \nmeaningful consultation with the Tribe during the remand.  Corps Consultation Policy; DOD \nInstruction. \n105.  When an agency has  \nestablished a policy requiring prior consultation with a tribe, and has thereby \ncreated a justified expectation on the part of the Indian people that they will be \ngiven a meaningful opportunity to express their views before [agency] policy is \nmade, that opportunity must be afforded.   Failure of the [agency] to make any real \nattempt to comply with its own policy of consultation not only violates those \ngeneral principles which govern administrative decision-making, but also violates \n“the distinctive obligation of trust incumbent upon the Government in its dealings \nwith these dependent and sometimes exploited people.” \n \nOglala Sioux Tribe of Indians v. Andrus, 603 F.2d 707, 721 (8th Cir. 1979), quoting Morton v. \nRuiz, 415 U.S. 199 (1975) (internal citations omitted) (emphasis added). \n106.  An agency’s actions that are entitled to the force and effect of law are arbitrary \nand capricious if they fail to comply with departmental policies requiring meaningful consultation \nwith an affected tribe.  Wyoming v. United States Dep't of the Interior, 136 F. Supp. 3d 1317, 1346 \n16 \n \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 379-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 17 of 22\n(D. Wyo. 2015), vacated and remanded sub nom. Wyoming v. Sierra Club, No. 15-8126, 2016 WL \n3853806 (10th Cir. July 13, 2016).   \n107.  For the duration of the remand process, the Corps refused to engage in meaningful \nconsultation with the Tribe.   \n108.  Under the Corps Consultation Policy, consultation requires a meaningful and \ncollaborative  process  that  “emphasizes  trust,  respect  and  shared  responsibility.”    Corps \nConsultation Policy at 2.  Additionally, under this policy the Corps “will ensure that it addresses \nTribal concerns regarding protected Tribal resources, tribal rights (including treaty rights) and \nIndian lands.”  Id. at 3.  Further, the  Corps’  Consultation Policy  acknowledges that, “[i]n \nrecognition of the varied organizations and customs of different Tribes, written protocols for \nconsultation procedures may be considered and implemented at the local level with a specific \nTribe.”  Id. at 4.   \n109.  Instead of collaboratively working with the Tribe to ensure that it addressed Tribal \nconcerns, however, the Corps unilaterally informed the Tribe that the consultation process was \nover – even when it knew that the Tribe believed the consultation process was ongoing and had \nroughly “3 pages of questions that” it still needed to discuss.   Meeting between U.S. Army Corps \nof Engineers and the Yankton Sioux Tribe (May 31, 2018) (statement by Faith Spotted Eagle).   \n110.  The Corps never followed up regarding the Tribe’s request for an additional \nmeeting and did not even request a list of the outstanding questions so that it could ensure that it \naddressed Tribal concerns.   \n111.  Further, though the Tribe attempted to create a clear consultation procedure with \nthe Corps by repeatedly sending the Corps and its counsel copies of the Consultation Protocols \nand requesting that the Corps’ counsel review and provide redlines indicating any concerns or \n17 \n \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 379-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 18 of 22\ndesired changes, the Corps has failed to provide a substantive response to the Tribe’s request, \npreventing mutual agreement to the protocols.   \n112.  The Corps did not alert the Tribe to its unilateral decision that consultation was \nover until the Tribe received a letter from the Corps on August 10 in response to the Tribe’s June \n5, 2018 letter informing the Tribe that it looked forward to “continuing conversations with you, \nleading up to actual consultation” that the Corps “expect[ed] to finish by August 10, 2018.”   \n113.  The Tribe, which had up to this point justifiably believed that consultation would \nbe ongoing, never had the opportunity to have its entire General Council convened to meet with \nthe Corps, a required by the Consultation Protocols, or to present its remaining questions and \nconcerns to the Corps.   \n114.  Thus, the Corps effectively ignored any potential concerns yet to be raised by the \nTribe because it was the Tribe’s belief that there would be formal and ongoing tribal consultation \non a government-to-government basis.   \n115.  Consultation is intended to be government-to-government, and the consultation \nprocess must therefore be adapted to the Tribe’s form of government. \n116.  The governing body of the Yankton Sioux Tribe is its General Council, which \nconsists of enrolled members age 18 and older, making the Tribe more of a pure democracy than \nmany other tribal governments and mandating that consultation occur with the Tribe’s General \nCouncil. \n117.  The General Council has not delegated its consultation to any other entity, thus \nthe  lack  of  consultation  with  the  General  Council  means  that  the  required  government-to-\ngovernment consultation has not occurred. \n18 \n \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 379-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 19 of 22\n118.  Moreover, the Corps Consultation Policies provide that the Corps “will share \ninformation that is not otherwise controlled or classified information.”  Corps Consultation Policy \nat 3.   \n119.  However, throughout the remand process, the Corps consistently failed to provide \nrequested documents to the Tribe in a timely manner, if at all. \n120.  The Corps and Colonel Hudson ignored policies related to consultation with Tribe.   \n121.  The Corps’ “consultation” with the Tribe was a far cry from open, timely, \nmeaningful, collaborative, and effective deliberative communication.   \n122.  Moreover, by taking two months to respond to the Tribe’s letter indicating that it \nlooked forward to ongoing consultation only to inform the Tribe that it would be finalizing its \nreview very shortly thereafter, it fully failed to “maintain open lines of communication through \nconsultation.”  Corps Consultation Policy at 5.   \n123.  Additionally, by ending the consultation process when it knew that the Tribe had \noutstanding questions, the Corps and Colonel Hudson did not “ensure that it address[ed] Tribal \nconcerns regarding protected tribal resources, tribal rights (including treaty rights) and Indian \nlands.”  Corps Consultation Policy at 3.   \n124.  Finally, the Corps and Colonel Hudson undermined the consultation process by \nfailing to provide the Tribe requested documentation necessary to its review.   \n125.  As a result, the Corps’ conclusions were arbitrary, capricious, and otherwise not \nin accordance with the Corps’ duties under the DOD Instruction and the Corps Consultation Policy, \nin violation of the APA. \n   \n19 \n \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 379-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 20 of 22\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court grant the following relief: \n11.  Declare that the Remand Analysis, and the underlying MLA easement which it \nattempted to address, is arbitrary, capricious, and in violation of NEPA and the APA; \n12.  Vacate the Remand Analysis, the final EA and FONSI, and the underlying MLA \neasement pending full compliance with the law; \n13.  Direct the Corps to resume the EIS process initiated in November 2016 and \nprovide Plaintiffs with all technical documents related to oil spill and impact so that they can \nparticipate meaningfully in such EIS process; \n14.  Retain jurisdiction over this matter to ensure that the Corps complies with the law; \n15.  Award  Plaintiffs  their  reasonable  fees,  costs,  expenses,  and  disbursements, \nincluding attorneys’ fees, associated with this litigation; and \n16.

Box D \n \nBuilding No. 1., North Standing Rock Avenue \nFort Yates, ND  58538,  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY \n  AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nPlaintiff,   \n \n  v. \n \nU.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS \n441 G Street NW \nWashington, DC  20314-1000, \n \nDefendant. \n \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  This is a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief.  The Standing Rock \nSioux Tribe (“Tribe”) brings this action in connection with federal actions relating to the Dakota \nAccess Pipeline (“DAPL”), a 1,168-mile-long crude oil pipeline running from North Dakota to \nIllinois.  The Tribe, a federally recognized American Indian Tribe with a reservation in North \nDakota and South Dakota, brings this case because defendant U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \n(“Corps”) has taken actions in violation of multiple federal statutes that authorize the pipeline’s \nconstruction and operation.  The construction and operation of the pipeline, as authorized by the \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n1  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 2 of 48\nCorps, threatens the Tribe’s environmental and economic well-being, and would damage and \ndestroy sites of great historic, religious, and cultural significance to the Tribe.   \n2.  This complaint involves two kinds of claims.  First, the Tribe brings an as-applied \nchallenge to Nationwide Permit 12 (“NWP 12”), issued by the Corps in 2012 pursuant to the \nfederal Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and Rivers and Harbors Act (“RHA”).  DAPL crosses \nhundreds if not thousands of federally regulated rivers, streams, and wetlands along its route.  \nThe discharge of any fill material in such waters is prohibited absent authorization from the \nCorps.  Federal authorization under these statutes, in turn, triggers requirements under the \nNational Historic Preservation Act (“NHPA”), intended to protect sites of historic and cultural \nsignificance to Tribes like Standing Rock.  In issuing NWP 12, however, the Corps authorized \ndischarges into federal waters without ensuring compliance with the NHPA.  In essence, in \nenacting NWP 12, the Corps pre-authorized construction of DAPL in all but a handful places \nrequiring federal authorization without any oversight from the Corps.  In so doing, the Corps \nabdicated its statutory responsibility to ensure that such undertakings do not harm historically \nand culturally significant sites.  \n3.  Second, on July 25, 2016, the Corps issued multiple federal authorizations needed \nto construct the pipeline in certain designated areas along the pipeline route.  One such \nauthorization allows DAPL to construct the pipeline underneath Lake Oahe, approximately half a \nmile upstream of the Tribe’s reservation.  Others authorize the DAPL to discharge into waters of \nthe United States at multiple locations in the Tribe’s ancestral lands.  The Tribe brings this \nchallenge because these authorizations were made in violation of the CWA and its governing \nregulations and without compliance with NHPA, and the National Environmental Policy Act \n(“NEPA”).    \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n2  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 3 of 48\n4.  The Tribe seeks a declaration that the Corps violated the NHPA in issuing NWP \n12, and an injunction preventing the Corps from using NWP 12 as applied to DAPL and \ndirecting the Corps to ensure full compliance with § 106 at all sites involving discharges into \nwaters of the United States.  The Tribe further seeks a declaration that the July 25, 2016 \nauthorizations were made in violation of the CWA, NEPA, and NHPA, and an order vacating all \nexisting authorizations and verifications pending full compliance with the CWA, NEPA, and \nNHPA.       \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5.  This case states a claim under the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. § 701 \net seq. (“APA”), which authorizes a federal court to find unlawful and set aside any final agency \naction that is “arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance \nwith law.”  Id. § 706.  Jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. § 1362 (“district courts shall have \noriginal jurisdiction all civil actions, brought by any Indian Tribe or band with a governing body \nduly recognized by the Secretary of the Interior, wherein the matter in controversy arises under \nthe Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States”); § 2201 (declaratory relief); § 2202 \n(injunctive relief). \n6.  Venue in this district is appropriate under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because it is the \ndistrict in which the defendant resides and in which “a substantial part of the events or omissions \ngiving rise to the claim occurred.”   \nPARTIES \n7.  The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is a federally-recognized Indian tribe with a \ngoverning body recognized by the Secretary of the Interior.  The Tribe is a successor to the Great \nSioux Nation, a party to the two Treaties of Fort Laramie in 1851 and 1868.  In those Treaties, \nthe Sioux ceded a large portion of their aboriginal territory in the northern Great Plains, but \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n3  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 4 of 48\nreserved land rights “set apart for the absolute and undisturbed use and occupation” of the \nIndians.    \n8.  The reservation established in the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie included extensive \nlands that would be crossed by the proposed pipeline. The Tribe has a strong historical and \ncultural connection to such land.   Despite the promises made in the two Fort Laramie treaties, in \n1877 and again in 1889, Congress betrayed the treaty parties by passing statutes that took major \nportions of this land away from the Sioux.  In 1889, Congress stripped large portions of the Great \nSioux Reservation that had been promised to the Tribe forever, leaving nine much smaller Sioux \nreservations, including Standing Rock.  In the modern area, the Tribe suffered yet another loss of \nlands, this time in connection with the same Oahe dam and Reservoir.  In 1958, the Corps took \n56,000 acres of bottomlands on the Standing Rock reservation for the Oahe project without the \nTribe’s consent or agreement.  \n9.  Since time immemorial, the Tribe’s ancestors lived on the landscape to be crossed \nby the DAPL.  The pipeline crosses areas of great historical and cultural significance to the \nTribe, the potential damage or destruction of which greatly injures the Tribe and its members.  \nThe pipeline also crosses waters of utmost cultural, spiritual, ecological, and economic \nsignificance to the Tribe and its members.  The Tribe and its members have been, are being, and \nunless the relief sought herein is granted, harmed by the Corps’ failure to comply with \nenvironmental and historic preservation laws.   \n10.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is an agency of the United States government, \nand a division of the U.S. Army, part of the U.S. Department of Defense.  It is charged with \nregulating any dredging and filling of the waters of the United States under § 404 of the CWA \nand § 10 of the RHA.    \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n4  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 5 of 48\n11.  By filing this action, the Tribe does not waive its sovereign immunity and does \nnot consent to suit as to any claim, demand, offset, or cause of action of the United States, its \nagencies, officers, agents, or any other person or entity in this or any other court. \nSTATUTORY AND REGULATORY BACKGROUND \nI.  THE CLEAN WATER ACT \n12.  Congress enacted the CWA in order to “restore and maintain the chemical, \nphysical, and biological integrity of the Nation’s waters.” 33 U.S.C. § 1251(a).  To accomplish \nthis goal, the CWA prohibits the discharge of any pollutant, including dredged spoil or other fill \nmaterial, into waters of the United States unless authorized by a permit.  Id., § 1311(a).  Unless \nstatutorily exempt, all discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States must \nbe authorized under a permit issued by the Corps.  Id., §§ 1344(a)–(e). \n13.  The Corps is authorized to issue two types of permits under § 404: individual \npermits and general permits.  Id.  The Corps issues individual permits under § 404(a) on a case-\nby-case basis.  Id., § 1344(a).  Such permits are issued after a review involving, among other \nthings, site specific documentation and analysis, public notice and opportunity for a hearing, \npublic interest analysis, and formal determination. 33 C.F.R. § 322.3; Parts 323, 325. \n14.  The CWA also authorizes the Corps to issue “general” permits on a state, regional \nor nationwide basis.  33 U.S.C. § 1344(e).  Such general permits may be issued for any category \nof similar activities that “will cause only minimal adverse environmental effects when performed \nseparately, and will have only minimal cumulative adverse effect on the environment.”  Id.  “No \ngeneral permit … shall be for a period of more than five years after the date of its issuance.”  33 \nU.S.C. § 1344(e)(2).  The purpose of this approach to permitting is to “regulate with little, if any, \ndelay or paperwork certain activities that have minimal impacts.”  33 C.F.R. § 330.1(b).   \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n5  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 6 of 48\n15.  The Corps issued the current set of 48 nationwide permits (“NWPs”) in February \nof 2012.  77 Fed. Reg. 10184 (Feb. 21, 2012).  The 2012 NWPs in “most cases” authorize \ndischarge into regulated waters without any further process involving the Corps.  In effect, the \nNWP pre-authorizes certain categories of discharge, without any additional approval from, or \neven notification to, the Corps.  33 C.F.R. § 330.1(e)(1).  In other instances, discharges cannot \noccur until the proponent of the action files a “pre-construction notification” (“PCN”) to the \nCorps, and receives verification that the proposed action is consistent with the terms of the NWP.  \nId.  § 330.6(a).   The specifics of whether or not a PCN is required are spelled out in each \nindividual NWP as well as a series of “general conditions” accompanying the NWP.  77 Fed. \nReg. at 10282 (listing 31 general conditions).   \nII.  THE RIVERS AND HARBORS ACT  \n16.  The Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 is the nation’s oldest environmental law.  \nThe statute prohibits a number of activities that impair ports, channels and other navigable \nwaters.   Unlike the CWA, which applies in all waters of the United States, the RHA applies only \nin “navigable” waters, defined as waters subject to the ebb and flow of the tides, or waters that \nare “presently used, or have been used in the past, or may be susceptible for use to transport \ninterstate or foreign commerce.”  33 C.F.R. § 329.4. \n17.  Section 10 of the RHA, 33 U.S.C. § 403, among other things, makes it unlawful \n“to excavate or fill, or in any manner to alter or modify the course, location, condition, or \ncapacity of” any navigable water without a permit from the Corps.  Like § 404 permits, § 10 \npermits may be issued as individual permits or pursuant to the NWP program and are generally \nsubject to many of the same regulations.  \n18.  Tunneling under a navigable water requires a section 10 permit from the Corps, \neven without any discharge into navigable waters.  33 C.F.R. § 322.3(a) (“For purposes of a \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n6  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 7 of 48\nsection 10 permit, a tunnel or other structure or work under or over a navigable water of the \nUnited States is considered to have an impact on the navigable capacity of the waterbody.”). \n19.  A separate provision of the RHA, known as “Section 408,” makes it unlawful to \n“build upon, alter, deface, destroy, move, injure, obstruct by fastening vessels thereto or \notherwise, or in any manner whatever impair the usefulness of any sea wall, bulkhead, jetty, \ndike, levee, wharf, pier, or other work built by the United States” without a permit from the \nCorps.  33 U.S.C. § 408.  Unlike Section 10 permits, § 408 permits cannot be issued pursuant to \nthe NWP program but are only issued as individual permits.  Prior to issuance of a § 408 permit, \nthe Corps must determine whether the use or occupation will be injurious to the public interest or \nimpair the usefulness of the project. \nIII.  THE NATIONAL HISTORIC PRESERVATION ACT  \n20.  Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (“NHPA”) requires that, \nprior to issuance of a federal permit or license, federal agencies shall take into consideration the \neffects of that “undertaking” on historic properties.  54 U.S.C. § 306108.  Agencies “must \ncomplete the section 106 process prior to the approval of the expenditure of any Federal funds on \nthe undertaking or prior to the issuance of any license.”  36 C.F.R. § 800.1.   \n21.  The NHPA defines undertaking as “a project, activity, or program funded in \nwhole or in part under the direct or indirect jurisdiction of a Federal agency, including— (1) \nthose carried out by or on behalf of the Federal agency; (2) those carried out with Federal \nfinancial assistance; (3) those requiring a Federal permit, license, or approval; and (4) those \nsubject to State or local regulation administered pursuant to a delegation or approval by a Federal \nagency.”  54 U.S.C. § 300320; 36 C.F.R. § 800.16(y).   \n22.  Early in the NHPA process, an agency must determine the area of potential effects \n(“APE”) of a federal undertaking.  36 C.F.R. § 800.4(1)(1).  The APE is defined by regulation to \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n7  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 8 of 48\ninclude the area “within which an undertaking may directly or indirectly cause alterations in the \ncharacter or use of historic properties…. The [APE] is influenced by the scale and nature of an \nundertaking and may be different for different kinds of effects caused by the undertaking.”  Id. \n§ 800.16(d).   \n23.  The Section 106 process requires consultation with Indian Tribes on federal \nundertakings that potentially affect sites that are culturally significant to Indian Tribes.  36 \nC.F.R. § 800.2(c)(2); 54 U.S.C. § 302707 (properties “of traditional religious and cultural \nimportance to” a Tribe may be included on the National Register, and federal agencies “shall \nconsult with any Indian Tribe…that attaches religious or cultural significance” to such \nproperties).  Consultation must occur regarding sites with “religious and cultural significance” \neven if they occur on ancestral or ceded land.  Id. § 800.2(c)(2)(II)(D).   \n24.  Under the consultation regulations, an agency official must “ensure” that the \nprocess provides Tribes with “a reasonable opportunity to identify its concerns about historic \nproperties, advise on the identification and evaluation of historic properties….articulate its views \non the undertaking’s effects on such properties, and participate in the resolution of adverse \neffects.”  Id. § 800.2(c)(ii)(A).  This requirement imposes on agencies a “reasonable and good \nfaith effort” by agencies to consult with Tribes in a “manner respectful of tribal sovereignty.”  Id. \n§ 800.2(c)(2)(II)(B).    \n25.  Acting “in consultation with … any Indian tribe … that might attach religious and \ncultural significance to properties within the area of potential effects, the agency official shall \ntake steps necessary to identify historic properties within the area of potential effects.”  Id. \n§800.4(b).  The agency must evaluate the historic significance of such sites, and determine \nwhether they are potentially eligible for listing under the National Register.  Id. § 800.4(c). \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n8  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 9 of 48\n26.  If the agency determines that no historic properties will be affected by the \nundertaking, it must provide notice of such finding to the state and tribal historic preservation \noffices, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (“ACHP”), which administers the \nNHPA.  Id. § 800.4(d).  The regulations give those parties the opportunity to object to such a \nfinding, which elevates the consultation process further.  Id.  \n27.  If the agency finds that historic properties are affected, it must provide \nnotification to all consulting parties, and invite their views to assess adverse effects.  Id.  Any \nadverse effects to historic properties must be resolved, involving all consulting parties and the \npublic.  Id. § 800.6.  If adverse effects cannot be resolved, the process is elevated again to the \nACHP and the head of the agency undertaking the action.  Id.  §800.7.  Until this process is \ncomplete, the action in question cannot go forward.  \n28.  The ACHP authorizes agencies to adopt their own regulations for implementing \nits § 106 obligations. Such regulations must be reviewed and approved by the ACHP in order to \nbe valid.  Id. § 800.14.   \n29.  The Corps has adopted procedures intended to satisfy its § 106 obligations.  See \nApp. C to 33 C.F.R. Part 325.  Those procedures, which predate amendments to the NHPA that \nsignificantly broaden the role of Tribes in the § 106 process, have never been approved by the \nACHP.  Several courts have concluded that the Corps’ NHPA procedures are legally invalid.  \nHowever, the Corps continues to follow these procedures for purposes of § 106 consultation, \nincluding in the process surrounding DAPL.  \n30.  Section 106 regulations also provide an alternative compliance mechanism under \nwhich agencies can negotiate a “programmatic agreement” with the ACHP to resolve “complex \nproject situations or multiple undertakings.”  36 C.F.R. § 800.14(b).  Such agreements are \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n9  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 10 of 48\nsuitable for “when effects on historic properties are similar and repetitive or are multi-State or \nregional in scope;” “when effects on historic properties cannot be fully determined prior to \napproval of an undertaking;” or when “nonfederal parties are delegated major decisionmaking \nresponsibilities,” among other situations.  Id. § 800.14(b)(1).  Programmatic agreements require \nconsultation with Tribes, among others, as well as public participation.   \n31.  The Corps has never adopted a programmatic agreement with the ACHP \nregarding its CWA/RHA permits or any other activity.   \nIV.  THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT \n32.  NEPA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321–4370f, is our “basic national charter for protection of \nthe environment.”  40 C.F.R. § 1500.1(a).  It makes environmental protection a part of the \nmandate of every federal agency.  42 U.S.C. § 4332(1). \n33.  NEPA seeks to ensure that federal agencies take a “hard look” at environmental \nconcerns.  One of NEPA’s primary purposes is to ensure that an agency, ‘“in reaching its \ndecision, will have available, and will carefully consider, detailed information concerning \nsignificant environmental impacts.’”  Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. \n332, 349 (1989).  NEPA also “guarantees that the relevant information [concerning \nenvironmental impacts] will be made available to the larger audience,” including the public, \n“that may also play a role in the decisionmaking process and the implementation of the \ndecision.”  Id. \n34.  NEPA requires agencies to fully disclose all of the potential adverse \nenvironmental impacts of its decisions before deciding to proceed.  42 U.S.C. § 4332(C).  NEPA \nalso requires agencies to use high quality, accurate scientific information and to ensure the \nscientific integrity of the analysis.  40 C.F.R. §§ 1500.1(b), 1502.24. \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n10  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 11 of 48\n35.  If an agency action has adverse effects that are “significant,” they need to be \nanalyzed in an environmental impact statement (“EIS”).  40 C.F.R. § 1501.4.  If it is unclear \nwhether impacts are significant enough to warrant an EIS, it may prepare an “environmental \nassessment” (“EA”) to assist in making that determination.  Id.   If the agency determines that no \nEIS is required, it must document that finding in a “finding of no significant impact” (“FONSI”).   \n36.  NEPA’s governing regulations define what “range of actions, alternatives, and \nimpacts [must] be considered in an environmental impact statement.”  40 C.F.R. § 1508.25.  This \nis in part what is known as the “scope” of the EIS.  The EIS must consider direct and indirect \neffects.  The direct effects of an action are those effects “which are caused by the action and \noccur at the same time and place.”  40 C.F.R. § 1508.8(a).  The indirect effects of an action are \nthose effects “which are caused by the action and are later in time or farther removed in distance, \nbut are still reasonably foreseeable.”  40 C.F.R. § 1508.8(b).   \n37.  An agency must also analyze and address the cumulative impacts of a proposed \nproject.  40 C.F.R. § 1508.25(c)(3).  Cumulative impacts are the result of any past, present, or \nfuture actions that are reasonably certain to occur.  Such effects “can result from individually \nminor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time.”  40 C.F.R. \n§ 1508.7.   \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nI.  INTERESTS OF THE STANDING ROCK SIOUX TRIBE \n38.  Since time immemorial, the Tribe’s ancestors—the Oceti Sakowin, also known as \nthe Great Sioux Nation—used and occupied a broad area throughout the northern Great Plains, \nincluding much of the area that DAPL proposes to traverse with its pipeline. Within this broad \nregion, tribal members followed migrating buffalo herds and traversed a landscape filled with \ncultural and historical significance central to the Tribe’s identity. \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n11  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 12 of 48\n39.  The Tribe’s traditional and ancestral territory extends well beyond the current \nReservation’s exterior boundaries, encompassing lands that are the subject of this action.  The \nCorps and other federal agencies have repeatedly acknowledged the traditional use of lands \nwithin and around the DAPL route by the Tribe’s ancestors.   \n40.  The Tribe’s cultural resources are historically and culturally interrelated over the \nentirety of the land within the Tribe’s traditional territory, within and outside of the exterior \nboundaries of the Reservation.  Protection of the Tribe’s cultural heritage is of significant \nimportance to the Tribe.  Destruction or damage to any one cultural resource, site, or landscape \ncontributes to destruction of the Tribe’s culture, history, and religion. Injury to the Tribe’s \ncultural resources causes injury to the Tribe and its people. \n41.  Cultural resources of significance to the Tribe are located on the lands that are the \nsubject of this action and adjacent lands. In addition to specific archaeological sites that have \nbeen identified to date, there are numerous significant culturally important sites that have not \nbeen identified.  The lands within the pipeline route are culturally and spiritually significant. \n42.  The Tribe and its members also have a cultural interest in preserving the quality \nof the land, water, air, fauna, and flora within the Tribe’s traditional territory, within and outside \nthe Reservation.  For example, the Tribe is concerned with impacts to the habitat of wildlife \nspecies such as piping plovers, least tern, Dakota skipper, and pallid sturgeon, among others.  \nThe Tribe has a particular concern for bald eagles, which remain federally protected and play a \nsignificant role in the Tribe’s culture, and which would be adversely affected by the proposed \npipeline.  The Tribe is greatly concerned with the possibility of oil spills and leaks from the \npipeline should it be constructed and operated, particularly into waters that are of considerable \neconomic, religious, and cultural importance to the Tribe.   \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n12  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 13 of 48\nII.  THE CORPS’ ISSUANCE OF NWP 12  \n43.  The Corps issued the current suite of 48 NWPs, covering a wide array of potential \nactivities involving discharges into regulated waters, in February of 2012.  77 Fed. Reg. 10184 \n(Feb. 21, 2012).  Of relevance here, NWP 12 governs “utility line activities.”  Id. at 10271.  \nNWP 12 authorizes the “construction, maintenance, repair and removal of utility lines and \nassociated facilities” in waters of the United States, providing that the activity does not result in \nthe loss of greater than a ½ acre of waters “for each single and complete project.”  \nCounterintuitively, a “single and complete project” in the case of linear projects like utility lines \nis any crossing of a separate waterbody.  33 C.F.R. § 330.2(i).  Under this definition, a pipeline \nlike DAPL is made up of hundreds if not thousands of “single and complete projects.”   \n44.  The NWP defines “utility line” to include “any pipe or pipeline for the \ntransportation of any gaseous, liquid, liquescent, or slurry substance, for any purpose.”  77 Fed. \nReg. at 10271.  The Corps considers pipelines carrying crude oil to be covered by NWP 12.   \n45.  Under NWP 12, preconstruction notification (“PCN”) to the Corps by a non-\nfederal project proponent, and a verification from the Corps, is required if any one of several \ncriteria is met.  Id. at 10272.  If none of the criteria are met, the proponent is authorized by NWP \n12 to proceed with the work in regulated waters without additional notification to, or approval \nfrom, the Corps.  None of the NWP 12-specific criteria relates to historic or cultural preservation. \n46.  The NWP program also includes a set of general conditions that are applicable to \nall NWPs, include NWP 12.  General Condition 20 (“GC 20”) addresses historic properties.  \nUnder GC 20, a non-federal permittee must submit a PCN “if the authorized activity may have \nthe potential to cause effects to any historic priorities listed on, determined to be eligible for \nlisting on, or potentially eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, including \npreviously unidentified properties.”  Id. at 10284.  If a PCN is provided, the Corps purports to \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n13  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 14 of 48\ncomply with § 106 of the NHPA prior to verifying that the NWP is applicable, and work may not \ncommence until such verification is provided.  33 C.F.R. § 330.5(g)(2).  Conversely, if no PCN \nis provided, no § 106 process occurs.   \n47.  GC 20 puts the responsibility on the proponent, not the Corps, to determine \nwhether historic or culturally significant properties are present, and requires Corps’ verification \nonly if the proponent finds such sites and reports them to the Corps via a PCN.    \n48.  NWP 12 was formally adopted by the Corps in a “Decision Document” signed by \nMajor General Michael J. Walsh on Feb. 13, 2012.  In responding to public comment regarding \npotential impacts to tribal sites, the Decision Document states that compliance with NHPA on \nNWP implementation is carried out via GC 20.     \nIII.  FACTS RELEVANT TO CHALLENGE TO NWP 12 \n49.  The proponent of DAPL proposes to construct a major crude oil pipeline across \n1,168 miles through North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, and Illinois.  The pipeline will have a \ncapacity of 570,000 barrels of crude oil per day, making it one of the largest crude oil pipelines \nin the nation, carrying over half of the current capacity of North Dakota’s oil production.  \n50.  DAPL is one of several pipelines that have been proposed for the North Dakota \noil production area, some of which have been moving on a slower timeline due to environmental \nreview requirements.  DAPL has moved aggressively to get the pipeline constructed as quickly \nas possible.   \n51.  The pipeline’s route passes through the Tribe’s ancestral lands, and areas of great \ncultural, religious and spiritual significance to the Tribe.  Construction of the pipeline includes \nclearing and grading a 100-150 foot access pathway nearly 1200 miles long, digging a trench as \ndeep as 10 feet, and building and burying the pipeline.  Such work would destroy burial grounds, \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n14  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 15 of 48\nsacred sites, and historically significant areas in its path.  These sites carry enormous cultural \nimportance to the Tribe and its members.  \n52.  DAPL claims to have completed cultural resource surveys along the entire \npipeline length.  However, the out-of-state, non-Tribal consultants hired by DAPL to do cultural \nsurveys are unable to assess the potential cultural significance of sites in this area to the Tribes.  \nOnly Tribally trained and approved consultants have the ability to assess such sites.  The Tribe \nhas never had the opportunity to discuss protocols for cultural surveys, or participate in the \nsurveys that were conducted.  Instead, it was provided copies of partial surveys after they were \ncompleted.  \n53.  Compared to other pipelines, DAPL has taken a highly unusual approach to Corps \npermitting for activities involving discharges into regulated waters.  Rather than seek Corps’ \nverifications on all waters of the U.S. in which pipeline construction would cause a discharge, as \nhas been typical, DAPL has only sought Corps’ verification for a tiny minority of the impacts to \nfederally regulated waters.   \n54.  For example, DAPL’s route through North Dakota is 359 miles.  A 2015 \n“Wetlands and Waterbodies Delineation Report” provided to the state Public Service \nCommission identifies 263 waterbodies and 509 wetlands that would be impacted by the \npipeline. However, this information was never provided to the Corps.  Instead, DAPL submitted \nPCNs for only two of these sites, at crossings of the Missouri River.  Neither of these PCNs was \nsubmitted based on potential impacts to historic sites.   \n55.  In South Dakota, DAPL would cross 273 miles.  DAPL’s state Public Utilities \nCommission filings reveal 288 waterbody crossings and 102 acres of wetlands impacts.  \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n15  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 16 of 48\nHowever, DAPL only provided the Corps with PCNs for 10 of these sites.  None of the PCNs in \nSouth Dakota was triggered by impacts to historic sites.   \n56.  In both states, this delineation of waterbody impacts was only partially complete, \nas DAPL did not have landowner access to all sites along the pipeline route.  Accordingly, some \nof the features were estimated through desktop analysis.  The ultimate number of waterbody and \nwetland impacts remains unknown.   \n57.  One of the two places in North Dakota where Corps authorization is required is at \nLake Oahe, where the pipeline would cross underneath the Lake (a dammed section of the \nMissouri River) immediately upstream of the Tribe’s reservation.   \n58.  Due to its concerns about the configuration of the pipeline and inadequacies in the \nregulatory process, the Tribe has participated extensively in the public process associated with \nthe permits, including filing numerous formal technical comments on the Lake Oahe crossing, \nmeeting with Corps’ leadership and staff, and communicating with elected representatives and \nagency officials to express concerns.  The Tribe has repeatedly conveyed to the Corps and other \ngovernment officials the significance of its concerns and the risks to the Tribe about moving \nahead with the pipeline in its current configuration.  The Tribe has in particular highlighted the \ninadequacies of the Corps’ § 106 consultation process with regard to historic and cultural \nimpacts at the Lake Oahe site. \n59.  On July 25, 2016, the Corps issued the NWP 12 verification and other \nauthorizations required at the roughly 204 sites in the four states for which verification has been \nrequested along the pipeline’s entire length.  However, prior to that time, construction started \nalong the remainder of the route, including construction involving discharges into the hundreds if \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n16  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 17 of 48\nnot thousands of sites where pipeline construction involves discharges into waters of the United \nStates, but for which no PCN is required.  \n60.  The Tribe has repeatedly expressed concerns to the Corps regarding construction \nin waters of the United States pursuant to NWP 12 without any section 106 consultation on \nhistoric impacts.  On June 30, 2016, the Standing Rock Tribal Historic Preservation Officer, Jon \nEagle Sr., wrote to the Corps District Commander regarding the extensive work proceeding \nwithout any § 106 consultation under NWP 12.  This letter explained that non-Tribal \narchaeologists were unable to appreciate the cultural significance of Tribal historic sites, and that \nhis office had found the DAPL cultural surveys, conducted by out-of-state archaeologists with no \ntraining in the cultural practices of the Oceti Sakowin to be “gravely deficient.”   \n61.  The letter requested that the Corps declare that all impacts to waters of the United \nStates had potential historic impacts and requested that the Corps require PCNs from all such \ncrossings, so that full § 106 consultation could occur.  \n62.  In response, the regulatory branch chief of the Corps’ Omaha district invited Mr. \nEagle’s office to participate in “monitoring” for “post construction discoveries of cultural \nresources and/or burials” at six sites subject to PCNs in North and South Dakota.  The Corps did \nnot respond to the issue to which Mr. Eagle’s letter was actually addressed, specifically, cultural \nimpacts at sites that are not subject to a PCN.  \n63.  The Tribe’s concerns were highlighted in June of 2016 when archaeologists \nworking on behalf of Upper Sioux Tribe discovered a site of great religious and cultural \nsignificance to Oceti Sakowin in the pipeline’s route in Iowa.  The site was not discovered by \nDAPL during its cultural resource surveys, even though it lay directly in the pipeline’s route.  \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n17  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 18 of 48\n64.  The pipeline will also impact historic and culturally significant sites in uplands \nalong the pipeline’s route in between areas of Corps’ jurisdiction.  The Corps views any impacts \nto such uplands sites as outside of its responsibility under § 106, as the Corps interprets §106 to \napply only within the immediate area of CWA jurisdiction.   \n65.  The ACHP regulations take a different approach.  In a May 6, 2016 letter to the \nCorps regarding DAPL, the ACHP explained that its regulations “define the undertaking as the \nentire project, portions of which may require federal authorization or assistance.” Even where the \njurisdiction is limited to particular portions of a project, the ACHP explained, “the federal \nagency remains responsible for taking into account the effects of the undertaking on historic \nproperties.”  The letter concluded that given the close relationship between the project and \nmultiple federal approvals, “a greater effort to identify and evaluate historic properties” was \nrequired. \n66.  In a May 19, 2016, letter, the ACHP formally objected to the Corps’ finding of \n“no effect” at the site of the Lake Oahe crossing, one of only two sites in the entire state of North \nDakota for which the Corps even purported to engage in § 106 consultation.  The ACHP asserted \nthat the Corps misapplied § 106 by considering only historic properties within its areas of \njurisdiction, when it should consider indirect impacts to historic sites in uplands that could not \noccur but for the Corps’ authorization to discharge into waters of the United States.   \n67.  At the time of filing this complaint, DAPL has not executed agreements with all \nlandowners, and eminent domain proceedings are underway in several states.  Additionally, \nseveral lawsuits have been filed against DAPL and state regulatory agencies which challenge the \nlegality of DAPL approvals, and seeking the remedy of vacating such approvals, which would \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n18  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 19 of 48\nrequire DAPL to stop work.  However, DAPL has chosen to move ahead with construction in \nplaces where regulatory approval is secured and where landowner consent has been obtained.   \n68.  DAPL has been repeatedly told by state regulatory agencies that any construction \nprior to the completion of the regulatory and eminent domain process is at its own risk.  DAPL \nhas repeatedly acknowledged that it bears the risk of starting construction prior to the completion \nof the regulatory and legal process.  \nIV.  GENERAL FACTS REGARDING THE CORPS’ ISSUANCE OF THE § 408 PERMITS \nAND CWA VERIFICATIONS \n69.  On July 25, 2016, the Corps’ issued authorizations pursuant to § 408 of the RHA \nfor DAPL to cross federally managed or owned lands on the Missouri River in two places, at \nLake Sakakawea and Lake Oahe, roughly 230 miles apart.  Accompanying this authorization, the \nCorps released a final environmental assessment (“EA”) and “finding of no significant impact” \n(“FONSI”) with respect to two components of the DAPL in North Dakota.  The EA and FONSI \nconcluded that these two small segments of the pipeline did not have sufficient adverse \nenvironmental impact to warrant preparation of an environmental impact statement (“EIS”), \nwhich would have triggered substantially broader environmental review, a closer comparison of \nalternatives, and greater public engagement.   \n70.  This decision authorizes DAPL proponents to begin drilling a pipeline path \nunderneath each of the two reservoirs, install the pipeline, and begin operating it to transport \ncrude oil in the Tribe’s culturally significant ancestral lands, and adjacent its reservation. DAPL \nhas notified Tribes that construction at the site is scheduled to begin on July 30, 2016.  \n71.  Also on that date, the Corps issued verifications pursuant to the CWA and RHA \nfinding that 204 crossings of jurisdictional waters of the United States, for which PCNs had been \nfiled, met the terms of NWP 12.  The verifications include federally protected waters in four \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n19  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 20 of 48\nstates: North Dakota (2 verifications), South Dakota (10 verifications), Iowa (61 verifications), \nand Illinois (45 verifications).  The verifications authorize DAPL proponents to begin \nconstruction of the pipeline through federally regulated streams, rivers, and wetlands, and \noperate the pipeline to transport crude oil in the Tribe’s culturally significant ancestral lands, and \nadjacent its reservation.  DAPL has notified Tribes that construction is set to begin at such many \nof these sites on or before August 1, 2016.  \n72.  On January 5, 2016, the St. Louis District of the Corps released a public notice \nannouncing that it intended to authorize another segment of the pipeline under § 408 of the RHA.  \nThat segment crossed federal flowage easements and federally managed levees on the Illinois \nRiver.  To date, no permit or even draft environmental review document has been issued for this \nsegment of the pipeline.   \n73.  On or about December 17, 2015, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“FWS”) \nreleased a draft EA for yet another segment of the pipeline.  That EA reviewed potential impacts \nof the pipeline over grassland easements held by FWS and managed for wildlife values.  A final \nEA and FONSI were issued by the FWS on June 22, 2016. \n74.  The current proposed route crosses Lake Oahe a half of a mile upstream of the \nTribe’s reservation boundary, where any leak or spill from the pipeline would flow into the \nreservation. The Tribe and its members have been deeply concerned about the potential impacts \nof the Lake Oahe crossing since its inception, for two primary reasons.  First, the Tribe relies on \nthe waters of Lake Oahe for drinking water, irrigation, fishing, and recreation, and to carry out \ncultural and religious practices.  The public water supply for the Tribe, which provides drinking \nwater for thousands of people, is located a few miles downstream of the proposed pipeline \ncrossing route.  Additionally, the cultural and religious significance of these waters cannot be \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n20  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 21 of 48\noverstated.  An oil spill from the pipeline into Lake Oahe would cause an economic, public \nhealth and welfare, and cultural crisis of the greatest magnitude.   \n75.  Pipeline leaks and spills are routine in both new and old pipelines.  A segment of \nthe Keystone pipeline built in 2010 recorded 35 leaks in its first year of operations.  A study of \nNorth Dakota’s pipelines revealed over 300 leaks in two years, most of which were unreported to \nthe public.  Major spills from crude oil pipelines have occurred recently on the Kalamazoo and \nYellowstone Rivers, with devastating economic and environmental impacts.  The Corps does not \nrequire, and DAPL does not propose, any technology or mitigation approaches that reduce risk \nrelative to other recent pipelines that have been the source of major and minor spills and leaks in \nrecent years.  \n76.  Second, the Lake Oahe crossing will take place in an area of great cultural, \nreligious and spiritual significance to the Tribe.  Construction of the pipeline, which includes \nclearing and grading a 100-150 foot access pathway nearly 1200 miles long, digging a trench as \ndeep as 10 feet, and building and burying the pipeline, would destroy burial grounds, sacred \nsites, and historically significant areas on either side of Lake Oahe.  These sites carry enormous \ncultural importance to the Tribe and its members.  \n77.  Construction of pipelines involves other significant environmental impacts, \nincluding massive amounts of water required for hydrostatic testing and permanent maintenance \nof a 50-foot right of way above the pipeline.   \n78.  The confluence of the Cannonball and Missouri Rivers, where the crossing would \ntake place, is a sacred place to the Tribe.  It is a place of great historical significance, serving as a \nplace of peace, prayer, and trade where traditional enemies could meet without risk of violence.  \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n21  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 22 of 48\nThere are numerous sacred stones and historically important sites in the immediate landscape of \nthe Lake Oahe Crossing, few of which have been fully evaluated by Tribal archaeologists.   \n79.  The Corps operates Oahe dam, downstream of the Lake Oahe crossing, for flood \ncontrol and other purposes.  The result of its management is that water levels fluctuate greatly in \nthe reservoir, with attendant erosion, scouring, and deposition of sediments.  The geomorphology \nof the segment of Lake Oahe to be crossed by the pipeline is highly dynamic.  \n80.  Due to its concerns about the configuration of the pipeline and inadequacies in the \nregulatory process, the Tribe has participated extensively in the public process associated with \nthe permits, including filing numerous formal technical and legal comments on the Lake Oahe \ncrossing, meeting with Corps’ leadership and staff, and communicating with agency officials to \nexpress concerns.  The Tribe has repeatedly conveyed to the Corps and other government \nofficials the significance of its concerns and the risks to the Tribe about moving ahead with the \npipeline in its current configuration.  \nV.  SPECIFIC FACTS RELATED TO NHPA COMPLIANCE FOR JULY 25, 2016 \nAUTHORIZATIONS \n81.  The confluence of the Cannonball and Missouri Rivers is sacred ground to the \nStanding Rock Sioux people.  It is rich in history, and it is rich in cultural and religious \nsignificance.  Industrial development of that site for the crude oil pipeline has a high potential to \ndestroy sites eligible for listing in the National Register.  \n82.  The Corps undertook a process to consider the impacts of the Missouri River \ncrossing on historic and culturally significant sites that was flawed in multiple respects.  It \ndefined the “area of potential effects” (“APE”) for the Lake Oahe crossing exceptionally \nnarrowly to include only a tiny parcel immediately surrounding the horizontal directional drilling \n(“HDD”) pits on each side of the river and a narrow strip for an access road and “stringing area” \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n22  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 23 of 48\non the west side of the crossing.  On the east side of the river, the APE is difficult to determine \nbecause in some of the Corps’ figures, the “project workspace” includes both the access road and \nstringing area, while in others only the HDD pit is included.   \n83.  The Corps’ attempts at § 106 consultation omit the actual pipeline route that will \nbe entering and existing the HDD borehole.  The pipeline itself will involve 100-150 yard swath \nof industrial development—clearing, grading, excavation of a 6 to 10 foot trench, and \nconstruction work to shape and place the pipeline.   \n84.  It is likely that such development would destroy any historic or culturally \nsignificant sites in its path.  There are already known but unevaluated historic sites—in other \nwords, sites that may be eligible for protection under the National Historic Preservation Act \n(“NHPA”)—in the direct path of the pipeline immediately in the area of the HDD crossing.  For \nexample, according to the draft EA, several sites are directly in the pipeline’s path in the first \nmile outside of the HDD site.   \n85.  Consultation with the Tribal Historic Preservation Office (“THPO”) on the \nDAPL, which would be routed just outside the reservation boundary, on ancestral land with great \ncultural and religious importance to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, has been profoundly \ninadequate.  The Tribe has never been able to participate meaningfully in assessing the \nsignificance of sites that are potentially affected by the project.   \n86.  The non-Tribal consultants hired by DAPL to do cultural surveys are not \nequipped to suitably assess the potential cultural significance of sites in this area.  The Tribe has \nnever had the opportunity to discuss protocols for cultural surveys or participate in the surveys \nthat were conducted.  \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n23  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 24 of 48\n87.  The Tribe’s first record of correspondence from the Corps related to the DAPL is \ndated February 12, 2015, when a Corps representative emailed the THPO asking if there were \nconcerns related to preliminary bore hole testing to be conducted at the HDD site.   \n88.  The THPO, Ms. Waste’Win Young, wrote back immediately objecting to the \nCorps’ conclusion that no historic properties would be affected by the bore hole drilling, \ndocumenting numerous specific important sites that could be affected as well as the cultural \nsignificance of the area generally, and requesting a full Class III survey with tribal archaeologists \nbefore any work was done.   \n89.  No response to this urgent correspondence was ever provided, despite several \nfollow up requests from the THPO, and the work was done without any additional tribal \nconsultation or process.  Many months later, in a September 16, 2015 letter, a Corps official \nstated that the § 106 process had ended on January 18, 2015—nearly a month prior to the Corps’ \ninitial email about the project. \n90.  On February 17, 2015, the Corps sent the THPO a generic form letter seeking to \ninitiate consultation under § 106 on the DAPL.  The THPO wrote back immediately, committing \nthe SRST to participation in the § 106 process, highlighting the significance of the site, and \nrecommending full Class III surveys with tribal involvement.   \n91.  In the months that followed, both the THPO and the Chairman of the SRST \nfollowed up with numerous additional letters to the Corps outlining concerns about cultural \nimpacts, and seeking to engage the Corps in a good-faith consultation process as required by § \n106 regulations.    \n92.  However, no response was received from the Corps to this correspondence until \nSeptember of 2015, when another letter was sent to the Tribal Chairman that again inquired “if \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n24  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 25 of 48\nyou would like to consult” on the pipeline project.  The letter asked for any “knowledge or \nconcerns regarding historic properties” that the Tribe wanted the Corps to consider.  A deadline \nof less than a month later was provided.   \n93.  The THPO responded promptly, outlining the Tribe’s significant concerns with \nproperties on the site, and its ongoing exclusion from the § 106 process.  The THPO observed \nthat “it has become clear that the Corps is attempting to circumvent the Section 106 process” and \nurged it to broaden its review to include affected areas outside the Corps’ jurisdiction, as \nrequired by governing regulations.  The Corps did not respond to this letter. \n94.  Instead, the Corps’ next action was to publish a draft environmental assessment \n(“EA”) that included not a single mention of the potential impacts of the pipeline project on the \nSRST or areas of historic and cultural significance to the Tribe.  The draft EA also stated \nincorrectly that the SRST THPO had indicated to DAPL that the Lake Oahe site avoided impacts \nto tribally significant sites.     \n95.  SRST submitted extensive comments on the EA, on three occasions, highlighting \nboth the flaws in the § 106 consultation process as well as the significant cultural resources that \ncould be harmed by the project.   \n96.  Additionally, the Corps received critical letters from the U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency, the U.S. Department of Interior, and the ACHP, all of whom questioned the \nCorps’ approach to consultation with the SRST.  The ACHP observed that it had “not been \nprovided evidence that the Corps has met” the requirements of § 106, observing that “there is \nlikely to be significant tribal interest” and that “[t]he Corps’ approach to meeting its government-\nto-government consultation is extremely important.”  It later asked to be formally made a party \nto consultation on the project.  \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n25  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 26 of 48\n97.  Around the time of the draft EA, the Tribe also learned that the proponent had \nconducted cultural surveys at the Lake Oahe site and along the pipeline route during 2014 and \n2015.  Neither the proponent nor the Corps ever consulted with the Tribe about the protocols for \nthose assessments or the area of potential affects, or had invited their participation as the Tribe \nhad repeatedly requested.  Instead, the proponent provided the Tribe with a massive quantity of \nits survey data, after it was complete, and provided an opportunity to comment.   \n98.  During this same time frame, i.e., late 2015 and early 2016, the proponent stated \nrepeatedly in public and private meetings that construction was slated to start in mid-May of \n2016, regardless of any additional process requirements or needs.  \n99.  In February of 2016, the Tribe and the commander of the Omaha District, Col. \nJohn Henderson, entered discussions about a visit to the reservation and the Lake Oahe crossing \nsite.  SRST Chairman Archambault emphasized in a letter to the Colonel that “there can be no \nmeaningful consultation with respect to decisions that have already been made,” and urged a \nreopening of the NEPA process to assess route alternatives.   \n100.  The meeting with the Colonel took place on Feb. 29, 2016, at which time the \nColonel and Corps archaeologists toured the site with the Chairman, THPO, and tribal \narchaeologists.  Tribal participants in this meeting emphasized the cultural importance of the site, \nand demonstrated it with specific evidence.   \n101.  In a follow up letter, the Chairman expressed hope that the visit would constitute \na “turning point” in what had been to that point a flawed process, and that the Corps could \npursue greater consideration of the Tribe’s interests through a full EIS.   \n102.  A follow up visit between Corps and Tribal archaeologists occurred on March 7, \n2016, during which SRST staff pointed out places where moles had pushed dirt to the surface, \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n26  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 27 of 48\ncarrying prehistoric pottery shards, pieces of bone, flint, and tools.  The sites shown to the Corps \nstaff had never been previously assessed or recorded, consistent with the Tribe’s repeatedly \nexpressed belief that the site generally was rich in unassessed sites of historic and cultural \nsignificance.   \n103.  During this visit Corps archaeologists stated that they were unaware of many of \nthe sites that they were witnessing and agreed with Tribal staff that additional study was \nrequired.   \n104.  On March 15, 2016 the ACHP wrote to the Corps again, noting that the agency \n“remained perplexed” by the Corps’ difficulties in consulting with the SRST, pointing out that \nthere was no tribal participation in identification surveys and urging the Corps to look at \nalternative pipeline alignments as required by ACHP regulations.   \n105.  In later March 2016, Chairman Archambault invited Col. Henderson back to the \nreservation to continue the dialogue about impacts to historic properties.  However, on April 22, \n2016, the Corps’ next action was to make a formal finding that no historic properties were \naffected by the Lake Oahe decision. \n106.  The Tribal THPO requested that the ACHP review the April 22 decision by letter \non May 2, 2016.   \n107.  On May 6, 2016, the ACHP sent another letter responding to previous \ncorrespondence between the Corps and ACHP.  The letter laid out a number of significant \ncriticisms of the Corps’ compliance with § 106 and made recommendations for additional steps \nthat Corps should take.    \n108.  The Chairman of the SRST sent a letter to the Corps formally objecting to the “no \nhistoric properties effected” on May 18, 2015.  The THPO also sent an objection letter on May \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n27  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 28 of 48\n17, 2016.  Neither the Chairman nor the THPO received any response to these formal objections \nbesides additional general information from the Corps on their permitting process.   \n109.  On May 19, 2016, the ACHP formally objected to the effects determinations \nmade by the Corps for DAPL.  The ACHP outlined several fundamental flaws with the Corps \n§ 106 compliance, including a failure to properly define the undertaking and area of potential \neffects; inadequate Tribal consultation and incomplete identification efforts; and numerous \nprocedural flaws.   \n110.  The April 22, 2016 finding pertains only to the Lake Oahe crossing site.  It does \nnot apply to any the other hundreds of NWP 12 verifications along the pipeline’s route.   \n111.  Section 106 consultation is required for the Corps’ verifications as well.  But the \nCorps has not consulted with the Tribe to evaluate the impacts of PCN verifications on historic \nsites within its ancestral lands, including sites in South Dakota and Iowa.  Instead, in issuing the \nverifications, it provided for tribal monitoring during construction.  \nVI.  SPECIFIC FACTS RELATED TO NEPA COMPLIANCE FOR JULY 25, 2016 \nAUTHORIZATIONS \n112.  The Corps is evaluating different components of DAPL in multiple separate \nsegments, each following an independent process and on its own timeline.  The Corps’ \ndocuments for each segment fail to acknowledge the existence or impacts of the other segments.  \n113.  One segment is made up of two crossings of Corps-managed or Corps-owned \nlands in North Dakota, at Lake Sakakawea and at Lake Oahe, roughly 230 miles apart from one \nanother.  Another segment is the crossing of Corps-managed and operated land and levees \ntowards the other end of the pipeline, on the Illinois River.  Finally, the Corps issued 204 \nverifications in four states that DAPL can proceed under NWP 12 where they cross jurisdictional \nwaters. \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n28  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 29 of 48\n114.  In yet another NEPA process, the FWS reviewed the impacts of providing \nauthorization to cross easements on private land intended to protect wildlife.  In June of 2016, \nFWS released a final EA covering authorization to cross miles of grasslands and wetlands \neasements in North and South Dakota.   \n115.  The Corps and FWS have pursued a NEPA process for each of these components \nindependently of the other components.  For the North Dakota crossings, the Omaha District of \nthe Corps released a draft EA in December 2015 and a final EA and FONSI on July 25, 2016.  \nFor the Illinois River crossings, the St. Louis District of the Corps released an EA and FONSI on \nJuly 25, 2016, but without having provided a draft EA and any opportunity for public comment.  \nFor the FWS easements, an EA was issued in June of 2016.  For the CWA NWP 12 verifications, \nthe Corps has not taken any action to comply with NEPA, asserting that verifications are not \nfederal actions subject to NEPA.  \n116.  The North Dakota EA looks narrowly at the impacts of pipeline construction at \nthe HDD crossing site only.  It does not look at the indirect effect of facilitating pipeline \nconstruction to, from, and through the two HDD crossings.  Accordingly, the EA is silent on the \nimpacts to the environment associated with pipeline construction outside the immediate confines \nof the HDD crossing site, including oil spill risks to waters or lands of cultural significance to the \nTribe.  \n117.  The North Dakota EA also does not analyze the environmental impacts of the \nNorth Dakota crossings in the context of either the CWA verifications for the pipeline, the \nIllinois River § 408 permit, or the FWS easement crossings, all of which are integrally related to \na single pipeline project.    \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n29  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 30 of 48\n118.  In multiple sets of legal comments, the Tribe expressed its concerns regarding \nthese and many other issues associated with the NEPA process.  \n119.  On January 8, 2016, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) sent \ncomments to the Corps on the draft EA saying that the document lacked “sufficient analysis of \ndirect and indirect impacts to water resources,” lacks information related to the operation of the \npipeline, and that the document is “limited to small portions of the complete project and does not \nidentify the related effects of the entire project segment.”   \n120.  EPA sent additional comments on March 11, 2016, highlighting the proximity of \nthe Tribe’s drinking water intake to the pipeline crossing.  The letter highlighted multiple risks to \nwater resources from the project, recommended additional analysis of emergency preparedness \nmeasures, and urged consideration of additional alternatives that reduced potential conflicts with \ndrinking water supplies.  \n121.  On March 29, 2016, the U.S. Department of the Interior sent a comment letter to \nthe Corps urging preparation of a full Environmental Impact Statement (“EIS”).  DOI \nhighlighted the risks to the Tribe’s reservation and drinking water resources.  The letter also \nobserved that the Corps’ NEPA analysis should consider more of the pipeline route as a \nconnected action under NEPA.   \nVII.  SPECIFIC FACTS RELATED TO CWA/RHA COMPLIANCE FOR JULY 25, 2016 \nAUTHORIZATIONS \n122.  Construction of the DAPL will involve dredge and/or fill in waters of the United \nStates in hundreds if not thousands of locations. Construction of DAPL will also involve \nobstructions to the capacity of navigable waters of the United States.    \n123.  The Corps is only issuing individual permits at three locations on the entire length \nof the pipeline: at the two North Dakota reservoir crossings, and at the Illinois River crossing.  \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n30  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 31 of 48\nThose components of the pipeline require a permit under § 408 of the Rivers and Harbors Act \nand real estate actions because the pipeline will cross federally owned or managed land.  \n124.  The remainder of the pipeline’s impacts on jurisdictional waters is being \nprocessed under NWP 12, which authorizes certain actions without an individual permit.   \n125.  With respect to PCNs and verifications, the final verifications identify 2 locations \nin North Dakota, 10 locations in South Dakota, 61 locations in Iowa, and 45 locations in Illinois, \nfor a total of 204 crossings in 1,168 miles of pipeline.  \n126.  Since the purpose of the pipeline is to carry crude oil developed in western North \nDakota to sites in Illinois, no component of the pipeline is useful without all of the other \ncomponents of the pipeline in place   \n127.  The Lake Oahe pipeline crossing will take place in close proximity to the Tribe’s \npublic water supply, as well as a number of private water supplies, and irrigation intakes.  The \ncrossing will also impair tribal treaty rights on the Standing Rock reservation, including reserved \nwater rights.   \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nI.  FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF – FAILURE TO CONSULT UNDER § 106 OF THE \nNHPA  \n128.  Plaintiff reincorporates the allegations in all preceding paragraphs.   \n129.  Issuance of an individual or general § 404 permit is an “undertaking” as defined \nin the NHPA.  As such, § 106 consultation is required to determine the effect of such \nundertaking on historic properties.  \n130.  The Corps failed to consider the impacts of NWP 12 on historic or culturally \nsignificant properties, or otherwise engage in the § 106 process, prior to issuance of NWP 12 in \n2012.   \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n31  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 32 of 48\n131.  The Corps has never developed a programmatic agreement with the ACHP with \nrespect to the NWP program.   \n132.  Issuance of NWP 12 is a “final agency action” within the meaning of the APA.  \n133.  The Corps’ failure to comply with the requirements of the NHPA and its \nimplementing regulations is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law in violation of the APA, \n5 U.S.C. § 706.  \nII.  SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF – UNLAWFUL ABDICATION OF § 106 \nRESPONSIBILITIES \n134.  Plaintiff reincorporates the allegations in all preceding paragraphs.   \n135.  Section 106 of the NHPA directs federal agency heads to take into account the \neffect of any undertaking on historic properties, and provide the ACHP and affected parties a \nreasonable opportunity to comment on such undertaking. \n136.  Under ACHP regulations, “it is the statutory obligation of the Federal agency to \nfulfill the requirements of section 106 and to ensure that an agency official with jurisdiction over \nan undertaking takes legal and financial responsibility for section 106 compliance….”  36 C.F.R. \n§ 800.2(a).    \n137.  In issuing NWP 12, however, the Corps does not fulfill the requirements of § 106 \nor “take legal and financial responsibility” for compliance.  Rather, it provided up-front \nCWA/RHA authorization to discharge fill into waters of the United States, effectively ending its \ninvolvement in most situations.  In so doing, it improperly abdicated its § 106 responsibility, and \ndelegated to the proponent its NHPA duty to determine whether there would be any potential \nimpact to historic properties.  If the proponent determines for itself that no historic properties are \naffected, the Corps is not notified of the action and provides no verification of NWP 12 \nauthorization.  In such circumstances, the Corps does not consider, and does not give the ACHP \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n32  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 33 of 48\nor interested parties a reasonable opportunity to comment on, the potential impacts to historic \nsites.  In so doing, the Corps abdicated its § 106 duties and/or improperly delegated them to \nprivate parties.   \n138.  ACHP regulations direct that agencies “shall involve” consulting parties in \nfindings and determinations made during the § 106 process.  36 C.F.R. § 800.2(a)(4).  Consulting \nparties must include Indian Tribes “that attach religious and cultural significance to historic \nproperties that may be affected by an undertaking.”  Id. § 800.2(c)(2).  The agency “shall ensure” \nthat the § 106 process provides such Tribe “ a reasonable opportunity” to “identify its concerns \nabout historic properties, advise on the identification and evaluation of historic properties, \nincluding those of traditional religious and cultural importance, articulate its views on the \nundertaking’s effects on such properties, and participate in the resolution of adverse effects.”  Id. \n§800.2(c)(2)(ii)(A).  Further, it is the “responsibility of the agency official to make a reasonable \nand good faith effort to identify Indian Tribes” to be consulted in the § 106 process.  Id. § \n800.2(c)(4) \n139.  Applicants for federal permits are “entitled to participate” as consulting parties in \n§ 106 consultation, and the responsible official may “authorize an applicant … to initiate \nconsultation with” consulting parties, but “remains legally responsible for all findings and \ndeterminations charged to the agency official.”  Id.  Such authorization requires notice to all state \nand tribal historic preservation offices, and federal agencies “remain responsible for their \ngovernment-to-government relationships with Indian Tribes.”  Id.  Moreover “the views of the \npublic are essential” to the § 106 process and agencies “shall seek and consider the views of the \npublic” in carrying out its responsibilities.  Id. § 800.2(d). \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n33  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 34 of 48\n140.  Additionally, ACHP regulations require Federal agencies to “ensure” that all \nactions taken by employees or contractors “shall meet professional standards under regulations \ndeveloped by” the ACHP.  However, in issuing NWP 12 and GC 20, the Corps did not “ensure” \nthat any standards at all would be used by private parties delegated to make their own § 106 \nthreshold determinations. \n141.  In enacting NWP 12 and GC 20, the Corps authorized discharges into waters of \nthe United States in a way that sidesteps virtually all of the requirements of the ACHP § 106 \nregulations.  Under NWP 12 and GC 20, private project proponents can make their own \ndeterminations as to the effects on tribally significant sites without any involvement of the \nTribes.  Under NWP 12 and GC 20, Tribes are not provided any opportunity, let alone a \nreasonable one, to identify their concerns or assist in the identification of historic sites.  Under \nNWP 12 and GC 20, the Corps is not responsible for the findings and determinations regarding \nadverse effects.  Under NWP 12 and GC 20, private project proponents can be made in a \nvacuum, with no input, no notice, no accountability, and no oversight.  Moreover NWP 12 and \nGC 20 do not establish definitions or standards to be used by private project proponents on how \nto make determinations of historic impacts, leaving it up to the proponents’ unfettered discretion \nto determine whether a PCN is required or not.    \n142.  NWP 12 and CG 20 are being applied to DAPL to authorize discharges into \nwaters of the United States with no verification or oversight by the Corps, and no accompanying \n§ 106 process.  Through NWP 12 and GC 20, the Corps is violating non-delegable duties: there \nis no consultation process, there are no standards governing determinations made by private \nparties, and the Corps has no mechanism to “ensure” compliance with its legal responsibilities.   \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n34  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 35 of 48\n143.  The Tribe is harmed by NWP 12 and GC 20 because they have led and will \ncontinue to lead to the destruction of culturally significant sites.  Following NWP 12 and GC 20, \nDAPL proponents have conducted gravely deficient cultural surveys, with no involvement by the \nTribes.  DAPL proponents have not found historic properties that would be affected by pipeline \nconstruction in Corps’ jurisdictional areas.  Accordingly, they have not filed PCNs and sought \nverification at the vast majority of sites at which they will be discharging into waters of the \nUnited States.     \n144.  The ACHP wrote to the Corps on May 6, 2016 to share the concern that Tribes \nlike Standing Rock Sioux Tribe have not had the opportunity to share relevant information “in \nthe vicinity of water crossings and within the project [right of way] that the applicant assumes \nwill not require PCNs under General Conditions 20 and 31 [standards for PCNs] of the NWP \nprotocols.”   \n145.  Issuance of NWP 12 is a “final agency action” within the meaning of the APA.  \n146.  The Corps’ delegation of its § 106 responsibilities to private parties in NWP 12 \nand GC 20 is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law in violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706.  \nIII.  THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF – FAILURE TO REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF \nINDIRECT EFFECTS UNDER § 106 \n147.  Plaintiff reincorporates the allegations in all preceding paragraphs.   \n148.  Under NHPA, federal agencies must consult on the effects of “undertakings” to \nhistoric properties.  An undertaking is defined by rule to mean “a project, activity, or program \nfunded in whole or in part under the direct or indirect jurisdiction of a Federal agency, including \nthose carried out by or on behalf of a federal agency, those carried out with Federal financial \nassistance, and those requiring a federal permit, license or approval.”  36 C.F.R. § 800.16(y) \n(emphasis added).   \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n35  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 36 of 48\n149.  The entirety of a private pipeline project that requires Corps’ authorization for \nhundreds if not thousands of discharges into waters of the United States is an “undertaking” for \npurposes of § 106 because it requires federal approval in order to occur and because it is under \nthe “indirect jurisdiction” of the Corps.  \n150.  GC 20 directs permittees to file a PCN with the Corps if the authorized activity \nwill have the potential to cause effects to historic properties.  However, the Corps directs \npermittees to only consider the direct effects of activities in jurisdictional waters, and not indirect \nimpacts such as construction impacts in uplands.   \n151.  ACHP regulations require consideration of indirect effects of agency \nundertakings, including areas in uplands outside of Corps jurisdiction. With respect to DAPL, in \na May 19, 2016 letter, the ACHP confirmed that the entire 1,168-mile crude oil pipeline is the \n“undertaking” for purposes of § 106 consultation, and accused the Corps of “not differentiating \nappropriately between federal action and the undertaking….”  The ACHP concluded that “the \nCorps’ effects determinations, thus far, fail to consider the potential for effects from the larger \nundertaking on historic properties including those of cultural and religious significance to Indian \nTribes.”  \n152.  Issuance of NWP 12 is a “final agency action” within the meaning of the APA.  \n153.  As applied to DAPL, the authorization to discharge into waters of the United \nStates, without consideration of indirect impacts on historic sites as required by § 106, is \narbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law in violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706.  \nIV.  FOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF – VIOLATIONS OF NATIONAL HISTORIC \nPRESERVATION ACT WITH RESPECT TO JULY 25, 2016 VERIFICATIONS AND \n§ 408 PERMITS \n154.  Plaintiff reincorporates the allegations in all preceding paragraphs.   \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n36  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 37 of 48\nA.  Incorrect Definition of “Area of Potential Effects”  \n155.  Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (“NHPA”) requires that, \nprior to issuance of a federal permit or license, that federal agencies shall take into consideration \nthe effects of that “undertaking” on historic properties.  54 U.S.C. § 306108.  Issuance of § 408 \npermits and CWA/RHA verifications under NWP 12 are federal undertakings within the \nmeaning the NHPA.   \n156.  Early in the NHPA process,  an agency, in consultation with the THPO, must \ndetermine the area of potential effects (“APE”) of a federal undertaking.  36 C.F.R. \n§ 800.4(1)(1).  The APE is defined by regulation to include the area “within which an \nundertaking may directly or indirectly cause alterations in the character or use of historic \nproperties…. The [APE] is influenced by the scale and nature of an undertaking and may be \ndifferent for different kinds of effects caused by the undertaking.”  Id. § 800.16(d).   \n157.  The Corps defined the APE for the Lake Oahe crossing unlawfully narrowly, and \ninconsistently with both the ACHP regulations and its own guidance.   \n158.  The APE for the crossing includes only a tiny parcel immediately surrounding the \nHDD pits on each side of the river and a narrow strip for an access road and “stringing area” on \nthe west side of the crossing.  On the east side of the river, the APE is difficult to determine \nbecause in some of the Corps’ figures, the “project workspace” includes both the access road and \nstringing area, while in others only the HDD pit is included.   \n159.  The Corps unlawfully omits the actual pipeline route that will be entering and \nexiting the HDD borehole from the APE.  Pipeline construction would involve 100-150 yard \nswath of industrial development—clearing, grading, excavation of a 6 to 10 foot trench, and \nconstruction work to shape and place the pipeline.  Such development would destroy any historic \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n37  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 38 of 48\nor culturally significant sites in its path.  But because these sites are outside the APE, the Corps’ \nconclusion does not consider them.   \n160.  The pipeline path should be in the APE because, even where the Corps lacks \ndirect permitting jurisdiction over segments in between regulatory areas, pipeline construction in \nsuch areas is an indirect effect of the HDD process.  Id. § 800.16(d).    \n161.  The Corps’ failure to consider the impacts to historic and sacred sites outside of \nthe immediate and narrow confines of the HDD drilling sites was arbitrary, capricious, and not in \naccordance with law in violation of the APA and the NHPA.  \nB.  Inadequate § 106 Consultation \n162.  The Section 106 process requires consultation with Indian Tribes on federal \nundertakings that potentially affect sites that are sacred or culturally significant to Indian Tribes.  \n36 C.F.R. § 800.2(c)(2).  Consultation must occur regarding sites with “religious and cultural \nsignificance” even if they occur on ancestral or ceded land.  Id. § 800.2(c)(2)(II)(D); 54 U.S.C. § \n302707.  \n163.  Under the consultation regulations, an agency official must “ensure” that the \nprocess provides Tribes with “a reasonable opportunity to identify its concerns about historic \nproperties, advise on the identification and evaluation of historic properties….articulate its views \non the undertaking’s effects on such properties, and participate in the resolution of adverse \neffects.”  Id. § 800.2(c)(ii)(A).  This requirement imposes a “reasonable and good faith effort” by \nagencies to consult with Tribes in a “manner respectful of tribal sovereignty.”  Id. \n§ 800.2(c)(2)(II)(B).    \n164.  The Corps’ final permit decision is the product of a fundamentally flawed \nconsultation process that does not meet the requirements of the ACHP regulations.  \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n38  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 39 of 48\n165.  Consultation never occurred at all on the bore hole testing.  The Tribe was \nnotified and the work was done before the Tribe’s serious concerns were even received by the \nCorps.   \n166.  Consultation did not start at the earliest phases of the process.  Consultation did \nnot occur on the “area of potential affects.”  Consultation did not occur on participation in the \nsurveys or protocols for how they should be conducted.  36 C.F.R. § 800(c)(2)(II)(A). \n167.  Instead, the THPO was given a brief window to “comment” on the proponents’ \ndeeply flawed and completed surveys long after the route had been selected and construction \nscheduled.   \n168.  The Corps’ April 22, 2016 “no effect” determination contains citations to \ndocuments, like “Landt & McCord, 2016,” that have never been provided to the Tribe. \n169.  The Tribe acted promptly and repeatedly to draw the Corps’ attention to its \nserious concerns.  It immediately responded to all correspondence from the Corps.   \n170.  Information was not sought from the Tribe in determining the scope of its \nidentification efforts, as required by 36 C.F.R. § 800.4(a), nor was the Tribe given a meaningful \nopportunity to assist the Corps in the identification of this culturally rich but largely unassessed \nsite.  Id. § 800.4(b).   \n171.  The Standing Rock THPO formally objected to the Corps’ finding of no historic \nproperties affected on May 17, 2016.  Although the regulations required the Corps to either \nconsult with the objecting party to resolve the disagreement, or request action by the ACHP, \nneither of those things have ever happened.  36 C.F.R. § 800.4(d)(1)(ii). \n172.  The ACHP formally objected to the Corps’ findings of no historic properties \naffected on May 19, 2016.  Under ACHP regulations, such an objection must be taken into \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n39  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 40 of 48\naccount by the Corps prior to reaching a final decision, and the Corps must prepare a summary of \nthe decision and its rationale, along with evidence of consideration of the ACHP’s objection.  36 \nC.F.R. § 800.4(d)(1)(iv).   \n173.  There are significant unevaluated properties in and near the Lake Oahe crossing \nwork site, as well as the broader pipeline route.  Some sites deemed “ineligible” by DAPL’s \nprivate surveys may in fact be eligible.  Some sites deemed unevaluated have in fact been \nevaluated and are potentially eligible.   \n174.  The Corps’ decision on the Lake Oahe crossing was arbitrary, capricious, and not \nin accordance with law in violation of the APA and the NHPA.  \nC.  No § 106 Consultation for Verifications \n175.  The Corps’ NWP general conditions require completion of the § 106 process for \nNWP permit verifications and before work can begin.  The proponent must present a PCN to the \nCorps wherever an activity “may have the potential to cause effects to any historic properties \nlisted on, determined to be eligible for listing on, or potentially eligible for listing” on the \nNational Register.  77 Fed. Reg. 10184, 10284 (Feb, 21, 2012).   \n176.  The Corps has never consulted with the Tribe on issuance of verifications in its \nancestral lands, which span the length of the pipeline.  The Tribe is unaware of any formal § 106 \nfindings for verifications outside of the two sites in North Dakota.   \n177.  The Corps’ decision that § 106 consultation had been completed on the 204 CWA \nverifications was arbitrary, capricious, and not in accordance with law in violation of the APA \nand the NHPA.  \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n40  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 41 of 48\nV.  FIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF – VIOLATIONS OF NEPA WITH RESPECT TO \nJULY 25, 2016 VERIFICATIONS AND § 408 PERMITS \n178.  Plaintiff hereby alleges and incorporates and restates all previous paragraphs of \nthis complaint.  \nA.  Failure to Consider Indirect Effects of Missouri River Crossings \n179.  NEPA requires consideration of indirect effects of agency decision.  The Corps \nmisapplied these legal standards in the final North Dakota EA.  It looked narrowly at the impacts \nof the river crossings themselves, and did not disclose or consider the impacts of other \ncomponents of the pipeline, either related to its construction or its operation to transport 570,000 \nbarrels a day of crude oil over nearly 1200 miles.  \n180.  Pipeline construction is an indirect impact of the Corps § 408 permits because it is \nproximately caused by the Corps’ decision.  Without the ability to cross the Missouri River, the \npipeline could not be built.  Pipeline construction is a reasonably foreseeable outcome of the \nCorps’ decision.   \n181.  Alternatively, pipeline construction could be considered an indirect effect of the \nCorps’ § 408 permit because it is a future action that is reasonably certain to occur as long as \nDAPL receives Corps’ authorization at the Missouri River crossings.   \n182.  The Corps failure to consider and disclose the impacts of the pipeline’s \nconstruction and operation is arbitrary and capricious and not in accordance with law in violation \nof the APA and NEPA.  \nB.  Unlawful Segmentation of Project Components  \n183.  NEPA requires consideration of separate components of a single project in a \nsingle NEPA review.  40 C.F.R. § 1508.25.  NEPA regulations state that connected actions \nshould be considered in a single EIS, defining them as action that “cannot or will not proceed \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n41  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 42 of 48\nunless other actions are taken previously or simultaneously,” and “are interdependent parts of a \nlarger action and depend on the larger action for their justification.”   Id.   \n184.  The Corps’ permitting regulations also require it to reject applications that seek to \nsegment a single project into multiple permits.  33 C.F.R. § 325.1(c)(2) (“All activities which the \napplicant plans to undertake which are reasonable related to the same project and for which a DA \npermit would be required should be included in the same permit application.”). \n185.  The Corps has not adhered to these requirements, despite having them pointed out \nto them by the Tribe, multiple federal agencies, and others.  Rather, it unlawfully segmented its \nNEPA review into separate components in North Dakota and in Illinois, each of which is \nproceeding independent of the other.    \n186.  Moreover, the FWS issued its own EA and FONSI for a component of this \npipeline project.  That EA and FONSI did not evaluate the impacts of the FWS decision in the \ncontext of the Corps permits or the larger project which it was a part of.  \n187.  The Illinois § 408 permit, the North Dakota § 408 permit, and the FWS grassland \neasements, are connected actions because they meet the criteria in 40 C.F.R. § 1508.25.  NEPA \nrequires them to be considered in a single NEPA document.  They were not.  \n188.  By unlawfully segmenting multiple components of the same pipeline project, the \nCorps has acted in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, and not in accordance with law, in \nviolation of NEPA and the APA. \nC.  Arbitrary Economic Analysis \n189.  NEPA and its implementing regulations require the Corps to produce \nenvironmental review documents that are factually accurate, well supported, and that fully \ndiscloses the impacts of an action to the public.  40 C.F.R. § 1502.   \n190.  These standards apply equally to an agency’s treatment of economic data.  40 \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n42  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 43 of 48\nC.F.R. §§ 1502.23 (cost benefit analysis), 1508.8 (EIS must evaluate economic effects).  An \nagency’s failure to include and analyze information that is important, significant, or essential \nrenders an EA and FONSI inadequate.  40 C.F.R. § 1500.1.  These fundamental NEPA principles \napply to both economic and environmental analyses in an EIS.  40 C.F.R. §§ 1502.24, 1508.8 \n(“effects” in an EIS must evaluate include economic impacts.). \n191.  In reaching its decision on the North Dakota crossings, the Corps looked very \nnarrowly at only two tiny segments of the pipeline, ignoring the environmental and economic \nrisks and harms of the pipeline as a whole. \n192.  However, it balanced these narrow risks and harms against the full economic \nbenefit of the pipeline as a whole.  For example, the EA cites the full $3.78 billion investment \n“directly impacting the local, regional, and national labor force by creating nearly 12,000 \nconstruction jobs.”  Final EA, at 80.  It repeats DAPL’s public talking points about providing \n“considerable labor income and state income tax revenue – including the generation of more than \n$13.4 million in ad valorem taxes.”  Id.   \n193.  The Corps’ decision to balance the full economic benefits of building and \noperating the entire pipeline against the economic risks of constructing tiny segments of that \npipeline is arbitrary and capricious and not in accordance with law, in violation of NEPA and the \nAPA.  \nVI.  SIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF:  VIOLATIONS OF THE CLEAN WATER ACT AND \nRIVERS AND HARBORS ACT WITH RESPECT TO JULY 25, 2016 \nVERIFICATIONS AND § 408 PERMITS \n194.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs. \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n43  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 44 of 48\nA.  Arbitrary and Inadequate Public Interest Review for North Dakota Permits  \n195.  Prior to issuance of a § 408 permit, or any other CWA/RHA permit, the Corps is \nrequired to conduct a “public interest” review consistent with its governing regulations,  33 \nC.F.R. § 320.4(a).   \n196.  In conducting a public interest review, the Corps must consider the probable \nimpacts of the proposed action, and weigh “all those factors which become relevant.”  Id.  The \nCorps must balance the benefits “which reasonably may be expected to accrue” from the action \nagainst the “reasonably foreseeable detriments.”  Id.  “All factors” which may be relevant to the \nproposal must be considered, including the extent of the public and private need for the proposal, \nand the existence of unresolved conflicts around resource use.  The District Engineer is \nauthorized to make an “independent review of the need for the project from the perspective of \nthe overall public interest.”  Id. § 320.4(q) \n197.  The Corps’ did not conduct a valid public interest review of the § 408 \nauthorizations in North Dakota.  To the extent it conducted any public interest review at all, it \nsuffered from all of the same flaws as the NEPA review identified above.  Specifically, the Corps \nconducted an arbitrary and segmented approach that ignored virtually all of the indirect effects of \nits decision, specifically, the construction and operation of the pipeline itself; and it conducted an \narbitrary and one-sided economic balance in which the benefits of the entire $4 billion pipeline \nwere weighed against the impacts of tiny segments of the pipeline.   \n198.  By failing to undertake a lawful and adequate public interest review of the actions \nproposed in its § 408 decision, the Corps has acted in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, and \nnot in accordance with law, in violation of the CWA and the APA. \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n44  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 45 of 48\nB.  Unlawful Verification For Lake Oahe Crossing \n199.  In addition to a § 408 permit, the portion of the pipeline that crosses under Lake \nOahe requires a Rivers and Harbors Act § 10 permit.  33 C.F.R. § 322.3(a)  \n200.  On July 25, 2016, the Corps issued verification that the Lake Oahe pipeline \ncrossing complied with the conditions of NWP 12, and hence was authorized under § 10 of the \nRivers and Harbors Act.    \n201.  In order to “qualify” for NWP authorization, proposals must meet a number of \ngeneral conditions.  77 Fed. Reg. 10184, 10282 (Feb. 21, 2012).   \n202.  The Lake Oahe crossing does not comply with these conditions and, accordingly, \ndoes not “qualify” for NWP 12.  See also 33 C.F.R. § 330.6(a)(2)  (“If the [Army Corps] decides \nthat an activity does not comply with the terms or conditions of an NWP, he will notify the \nperson desiring to do the work and instruct him on the procedures to seek authorization under a \nregional general permit or individual permit.”). \n203.  General Condition 7 states that no activity may be authorized under a NWP that is \nin “proximity” to public water supplies.  77 Fed. Reg. at 10283. The Lake Oahe crossing is in \nclose proximity to the Tribe’s source of drinking water for a significant portion of the reservation \ncommunity.   \n204.  The potential impact on drinking water for the Standing Rock and many other \nTribes and communities has also been emphasized by the Environmental Protection Agency and \nthe U.S. Department of Interior, as well as the Tribal government and many of its members.  \n205.  Further, General Condition 17 states that no activity authorized by a NWP may \n“impair tribal rights” including “reserved water rights.”  77 Fed. Reg. at 10283.  DAPL is routed \njust upstream of the Tribe’s reservation boundary, where any oil spill would have devastating \neffects within the reservation.  The Reservation necessarily includes the protection of adequate \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n45  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 46 of 48\nwater quality.  The Lake Oahe crossing does not “qualify” for a NWP 12 because of the risks to \nTribal resources protected by treaty.   \n206.  The Corps decision to verify that the Lake Oahe crossing was consistent with \nNWP 12 was arbitrary, capricious and not in accordance with law, in violation of the APA.   \nC.  Issuance of Verifications for 204 Jurisdictional Waters  \n207.  Under the Corps’ regulations, a single project can only proceed under both an \nNWP and an individual permit where the “portions qualifying for NWP authorization would \nhave independent utility and are able to function or meet their purpose independent of the total \nproject.”  33 C.F.R. § 330.6(d).   \n208.  For the reasons discussed immediately above, the Lake Oahe crossing requires an \nindividual permit.  Moreover, Section 408 authorizations are individual “permits” within the \nmeaning of this regulation.  See id., § 320.2(e); § 320.4 (general policies applicable to “all” \nArmy permits).   \n209.  No component of DAPL has “independent utility” or the “ability to function” \nwithout the other components of the pipeline.  As a result of this, the Corps cannot authorize \nsome portions of DAPL under NWP 12, and other portions as individual permits.   \n210.  Because the Lake Oahe crossing requires an individual permit, no other \ncomponent of the pipeline can be authorized under NWP 12.   \n211.  Issuance of a verification by the Corps constitutes a final agency action within the \nmeaning of the APA.   \n212.  The Corps’ verification of 204 additional crossings of jurisdictional waters was \narbitrary and capricious and not in accordance with law, in violation of the APA and the CWA.   \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court grant the following relief:  \nEarthjustice \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n46  Seattle, WA  98104 \n(206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 1   Filed 07/27/16   Page 47 of 48\n1.

Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(d), plaintiff, Standing Rock Sioux Tribe (“Tribe”) \nhereby files this supplemental complaint in connection with federal actions relating to the Dakota \nAccess Pipeline (“DAPL”).  DAPL is a 1,168-mile-long crude oil pipeline that crosses the \nMissouri River at Lake Oahe half a mile upstream of the Tribe’s reservation, on the Tribe’s \ntreaty lands.   \n2.  This supplemental complaint addresses events that have occurred since this Court \ngranted in part the Tribe’s motion for partial for summary judgment on June 14, 2017.  Standing \nRock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 255 F. Supp.3d 101 (D.D.C. 2017).  In that \n \nEarthjustice \nFIRST SUPPLEMENTAL COMPLAINT \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n(No. 1:16-cv-1534-JEB)   Seattle, WA  98104 \n- 1 -  (206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 371-1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 2 of 16\ndecision, this Court found unlawful and remanded the environmental analysis conducted by \ndefendant U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”) for additional consideration on specific \nissues.  It further admonished the Corps to give “serious consideration” to the errors identified in \nits decision, warning that compliance with the law “cannot be reduced to a bureaucratic \nformality, and the Court expects the Corps not to treat remand as an exercise in filling out the \nproper paperwork post hoc.”  Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 282 \nF.Supp.3d 91, 109 (D.D.C. 2017).  \n3.  The remand process is now complete and has resulted in another final decision by \nthe Corps.  Regrettably but not surprisingly, the Corps ignored this Court’s admonition to \napproach the remand with an open mind.  Instead, it treated the remand as a post hoc effort to \njustify its unlawful decision to circumvent an adequate review of the pipeline and its impacts on \nthe Tribe and the Tribe’s rights.  In the remand decision, the Corps’ without qualification \naffirmed its original decision to authorize the pipeline without a comprehensive environmental \nreview under the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”).  Rather than “serious \nconsideration” of the remand issues, the Corps produced a one-sided analysis that failed to \nprovide a fair or transparent review of the matters this Court remanded to it.   \n4.  This supplemental complaint challenges the Corps’ remand decision, which is a \nfinal agency action subject to review by this Court under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 \nU.S.C. § 701, et seq., (“APA”), and the process underlying it.  As directed by Fed. R. Civ. P. \n15(d), it focuses on the additional background and claims that have arisen since the original \ncomplaints were filed.  \n5.  The Tribe seeks a declaration that the Corps’ decision to affirm its original \ndecision without a comprehensive environmental review and adequate consultation with the \n \nEarthjustice \nFIRST SUPPLEMENTAL COMPLAINT \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n(No. 1:16-cv-1534-JEB)   Seattle, WA  98104 \n- 2 -  (206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 371-1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 3 of 16\nTribe was arbitrary, capricious and in violation of the APA, NEPA, and the Tribe’s Treaty rights.  \nThe Tribe asks that the Corps’ permits authorizing DAPL under Lake Oahe be vacated pending \nfull compliance with NEPA and the APA.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n6.  This supplemental complaint presents claims under the APA, which authorizes a \nfederal court to find unlawful and set aside any final agency action that is “arbitrary and \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  Id. § 706.  The \nTribe brings these claims on its own behalf and on behalf of its members. \n7.  Jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. § 1362 (“district courts shall have original \njurisdiction of all civil actions, brought by any Indian Tribe or band with a governing body duly \nrecognized by the Secretary of the Interior, wherein the matter in controversy arises under the \nConstitution, laws, or treaties of the United States”); § 1331 (general federal question \njurisdiction); § 2201 (declaratory relief); § 2202 (injunctive relief). \n8.  Venue in this district is appropriate under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because it is the \ndistrict in which the defendant resides and in which “a substantial part of the events or omissions \ngiving rise to the claim occurred.”  No party has contested jurisdiction or venue during this \nlitigation to date.  \nPARTIES \n9.  The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is a federally recognized Indian tribe.  Since time \nimmemorial, the Tribe’s ancestors lived on the landscape crossed by DAPL.  The pipeline \ncrosses areas of great historical and cultural significance to the Tribe, the damage or destruction \nof which greatly injures the Tribe and its members.  The pipeline crosses waters of utmost \ncultural, religious, spiritual, ecological, and economic significance to the Tribe and its members.  \n \nEarthjustice \nFIRST SUPPLEMENTAL COMPLAINT \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n(No. 1:16-cv-1534-JEB)   Seattle, WA  98104 \n- 3 -  (206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 371-1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 4 of 16\nThe Tribe and its members have been, are being, and, unless the relief sought herein is granted, \nwill be harmed by the Corps’ failure to comply with environmental and administrative statutes \nand the Tribe’s Treaties. \n10.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is an agency of the United States government, \nand a division of the U.S. Army, part of the U.S. Department of Defense.  It is charged with \nregulating any dredging and filling of the waters of the United States under § 404 and § 408 of \nthe Clean Water Act, issuing leases under the Mineral Leasing Act (“MLA”), fulfilling the \nUnited States’ trust responsibility to Tribes, and complying with NEPA in the course of \nundertaking major federal actions.  Issuance of permits for DAPL is a major federal action \nsubject to NEPA and other laws.  \n11.  Intervenor-Defendant Dakota Access, LLC is a limited liability company formed \nto construct and own Dakota Access Pipeline.  Energy Transfer Partners, L.P., Sunoco Logistics \nPartners, L.P. and Phillips 66 are the beneficial owners of Dakota Access, LLC. \n12.  By filing this action, the Tribe does not waive its sovereign immunity and does \nnot consent to suit as to any claim, demand, offset, or cause of action of the United States, its \nagencies, officers, agents, or any other person or entity in this or any other court. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n13.  The Tribe originally filed this action on June 27, 2016, two days after the Corps \nissued an initial set of permits authorizing construction of DAPL at Lake Oahe, immediately \nupstream of the Tribe’s reservation and on territory that was part of the Tribe’s Treaty lands.  In \nits original complaint, the Tribe raised multiple statutory and common law claims against the \nCorps regarding its authorization of DAPL.  Shortly thereafter, DAPL moved to intervene as a \n \nEarthjustice \nFIRST SUPPLEMENTAL COMPLAINT \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n(No. 1:16-cv-1534-JEB)   Seattle, WA  98104 \n- 4 -  (206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 371-1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 5 of 16\ndefendant, and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe (“CRST”) moved to intervene as a plaintiff.  \nThis Court granted both motions.   \n14.  The Tribe immediately moved for a preliminary injunction pursuant to its claims \nunder the National Historic Preservation Act (“NHPA”), seeking to prevent further construction \nof the pipeline around Lake Oahe pending resolution of the legal claims in the case.  By the time \nof the Court’s consideration of that motion, the Tribe’s peaceful and principled opposition to \nDAPL at Lake Oahe had garnered global attention.   \n15.  On September 9, 2016, this Court denied the motion for a preliminary injunction.  \nStanding Rock Sioux Tribe v. Corps, 205 F. Supp.3d 4 (D.D.C. 2016).  That same day, multiple \nfederal agencies affirmed that the Tribe had raised serious concerns that necessitated a closer \nlook at the Corps’ permits at Lake Oahe and their underlying environmental analysis.  The Corps \naffirmed that the remaining authorization needed to construct the pipeline under Lake Oahe—an \neasement to cross federally owned land at Lake Oahe issued under the MLA—would not be \nissued at that time. \n16.  After several months of additional consideration, the Corps announced on Dec. 4, \n2016, that the MLA easement would not be granted without a comprehensive analysis of \nalternatives and impacts, including an analysis of the Tribe’s Treaty rights, and that this analysis \nwould most likely be undertaken through an environmental impact statement (“EIS”).  Shortly \nthereafter, the Corps formally initiated that process with a notice of intent to prepare an EIS, \nrequesting public input on the critical issues and scope of the EIS.  The Tribe, and many others, \nprovided the Corps with extensive comments in response to the notice of intent.   \n17.  A new President was inaugurated on January 20, 2017.  On January 24, the new \nPresident executed a “Presidential Memorandum” directing the Corps to abandon the December \n \nEarthjustice \nFIRST SUPPLEMENTAL COMPLAINT \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n(No. 1:16-cv-1534-JEB)   Seattle, WA  98104 \n- 5 -  (206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 371-1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 6 of 16\n4 decision and the recently initiated EIS process.  The Corps shortly thereafter issued the MLA \neasement at Lake Oahe without additional environmental review, and formally terminated the \nEIS process.  Construction of the pipeline under Lake Oahe resumed immediately.  \n18.  After filing an amended complaint, the Tribe moved for partial summary \njudgment on its NEPA, Treaty, and APA claims against the Corps.  The Corps and DAPL cross-\nmoved for summary judgment, and briefing was completed on April 4, 2017.  Construction of \nthe pipeline was finished soon thereafter, and DAPL announced that it had commenced \ncommercial operations of the pipeline on June 1, 2017. \n19.  This Court issued its opinion on the Tribes’ summary judgment motion on June \n14, 2017.  While rejecting some of the Tribe’s claims, the Court agreed that the Corps’ analysis \nof three specific issues was arbitrary, capricious, and in violation of NEPA.  First, the Court \nruled that the Corps failed to adequately analyze the impacts of an oil spill on the Tribe’s treaty \nhunting and fishing rights.  Second, the Court held that the Corps’ consideration of \nenvironmental justice implications of the permit was flawed.  Finally, the Court held that the \nCorps failed to address the significant scientific “controversy” around its dismissal of oil spill \nrisk and impacts.  The Court remanded the analysis back to the Corps for further consideration in \nlight of its decision. \n20.  This Court subsequently denied the Tribe’s request that the permits be vacated \nduring the remand process, finding a “serious possibility” that the Corps could substantiate its \ndecision on remand.  Standing Rock, 282 F. Supp.3d at 109.  In a further decision, this Court \ngranted the Tribe’s request to impose interim conditions on DAPL’s operation during the \nremand, finding that they were necessary to keep the Court informed of conditions and address \nits “ongoing concern with the risk of a spill at Lake Oahe.”  Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. \n \nEarthjustice \nFIRST SUPPLEMENTAL COMPLAINT \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n(No. 1:16-cv-1534-JEB)   Seattle, WA  98104 \n- 6 -  (206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 371-1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 7 of 16\nArmy Corps of Engineers, 2017 WL 6001726, at *2 (D.D.C. Dec. 4, 2017).  The Court cited a \nrecent oil spill from another nearby pipeline, noting that such events “have the potential to wreak \nhavoc on nearby communities and ecosystems.”  Id. at *3.  The Court directed the finalization of \noil spill response plans; completion of a third-party audit; and directed public reporting on \nvarious measures.   \n21.  The Tribe repeatedly attempted to engage with the Corps in good faith during the \nremand process, submitting many requests for information and for meetings, and submitting \nextensive technical and other information intended to inform the Corps’ analysis of the remand \nissues.  The Tribe retained multiple experts on oil spill risk and response in order to assist it in \nparticipating in the remand and in preparing for a potential oil spill affecting the reservation.  \nThe Tribe also dedicated significant staff and other resources to providing information to the \nCorps and participating in the remand.   \n22.  The Corps largely refused to provide any of the critical information requested by \nthe Tribe, nor did it take steps to address the Tribe’s request for meaningful consultation.  For \nexample, on multiple occasions, the Tribe asked the Corps to share with it the oil spill modeling \nthat the Corps was relying on, so that the Tribe’s technical team could review it and provide \ninput to the Corps as to its reliability and accuracy.  The Corps never provided this information, \nleaving the Tribe’s technical advisors to provide input on analyses that they were never permitted \nto see. \n23.  Despite these handicaps, the Tribe on February 21, 2018, provided the Corps with \na substantial body of technical material (“Remand Report”) for the Corps to consider in its \nreview.  Accompanied by multiple technical appendices, the Tribe’s Remand Report provided \nextensive expert input on the critical issues of spill risk and impact, authored by a team of \n \nEarthjustice \nFIRST SUPPLEMENTAL COMPLAINT \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n(No. 1:16-cv-1534-JEB)   Seattle, WA  98104 \n- 7 -  (206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 371-1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 8 of 16\nengineers, attorneys, a former federal safety regulator, a Ph.D. economist, and the directors of \nseveral of the Tribe’s governmental agencies.  The report also included detailed information on \nthe Tribe’s Treaty rights, supported by numerous declarations from hunters, elders, staff \nmembers, and others. \n24.  For example, the Remand Report and supplementary material provided by the \nTribe provided extensive expert information on how the Corps had seriously underestimated the \n“worst case spill” (“WCD”) discharge volume.  It provided extensive expert information on how \nthe Corps’ reliance on generic spill statistics understated the risk of an oil spill, which was \nconsiderably higher than the Corps had estimated due in part to the abysmal safety and \ncompliance record of DAPL’s corporate parents.  It provided extensive information about unique \nhealth and environmental risks presented by Bakken crude oil.  It provided extensive \nindependent analysis on the issue of environmental justice. \n25.  While the remand process was underway, DAPL’s corporate parents publicly \nannounced their intention to expand the capacity of DAPL by 100,000 barrels a day.  On \ninformation and belief, expansion could take place without additional Corps authorization at \nLake Oahe.  A significant increase in operation volume would render obsolete much of the spill \nrisk and impact analysis and emergency response planning conducted by DAPL and the Corps to \ndate.   \n26.  The Corps concluded the remand process on August 31, 2018, with a two-page \n“memorandum for record” documenting the Corps’ conclusion that there was no need to \nformally reconsider its July 2016 environmental assessment, and stating that an EIS was not \nnecessary.  As to the three flaws identified by this Court, the Corps concluded that its review of \nthe Tribe’s hunting and fishing Treaty rights would not be impacted “because the risk of an \n \nEarthjustice \nFIRST SUPPLEMENTAL COMPLAINT \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n(No. 1:16-cv-1534-JEB)   Seattle, WA  98104 \n- 8 -  (206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 371-1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 9 of 16\nincident is low and any impacts to hunting and fishing resource [sic] will be of limited scope and \nduration.” As to the issue of environmental justice, the Corps concluded that the Oahe crossing \n“does not result in disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on \nminority populations, including Tribes, and low-income populations.”  And as to the issue of \nwhether the Corps conclusions were likely to be “highly controversial,” the Corps incorrectly \ncharacterized the Tribe’s significant technical input as simply being opposed to the pipeline \nauthorizations, stating that they did not “provide information that a substantial dispute exists as \nto the size, nature, or effect of the federal action.”  \n27.  The Memorandum stated that the rationale supporting these findings was \ncontained in the “enclosed document” and in the administrative record.  However, at the time the \nMemorandum was filed, no such “document” was enclosed or provided to the Tribe or the Court.  \nIt was not until October 1, 2018, that undersigned counsel was provided with a copy of the \nenclosed analysis supporting the remand decision (“Remand Analysis”), which was subject to \nconfidentiality restrictions and could not be shared publicly.  On October 24, 2018, a redacted \nversion of the remand analysis was made available for the public.   \n28.  The Remand Analysis entirely ignores much of the information provided to the \nCorps by the Tribe.  It mostly reiterates the flawed conclusions of the Corps’ earlier analyses \nwithout even mentioning, let alone addressing, most of the Tribe’s information critiquing that \nanalysis.  For example, the Remand Analysis continues to calculate risk based on generic \nnational statistics, without regard to any of the unique risk factors of this project in this place, in \nlight of DAPL’s parent companies’ abysmal safety record.  Like previous versions, it fails to \ngrapple with extensive evidence that the risks of slow leaks that cannot be detected is higher than \nit claims.  The Remand Analysis ignores DAPL’s failure to utilize vital industry pipeline safety \n \nEarthjustice \nFIRST SUPPLEMENTAL COMPLAINT \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n(No. 1:16-cv-1534-JEB)   Seattle, WA  98104 \n- 9 -  (206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 371-1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 10 of 16\nstandards despite the Corps claim in the EA to do so.  Similarly, it continues to underestimate the \nimpacts of an oil spill (which rely on its erroneous WCD and risk estimates), the elevated \nhazards of Bakken crude oil, and to overestimate the ability of responders to clean it up—all of \nwhich place emergency responders at risk.   \n29.  A key shortcoming of the remand analysis is its failure to provide a lawfully \nadequate WCD.  In the remand analysis, the Corps essentially repeats the identical WCD from \nbefore the remand—without so much as a word about the Tribe’s extensive explanations of why \nthe Corps’ original estimate was deeply inaccurate.  Furthermore, the Corp fails to address the \nimpact of circumstances listed in the 49 C.F.R. § 194.5 definition of WCD, including adverse \nweather conditions.  The WCD also fails to implement the formula required by 49 C.F.R. § \n194.105(b)(1), including consideration of the operators’ “historic discharge[s]” and relies on \nunrealistic shutdown times that bear little resemblance to multiple real-world pipeline incidents.  \nAs noted, DAPL’s parent companies have among the industry’s worst safety records, which by \nlaw should have been considered in developing the WCD, but was not. \n30.  The remand also ignored critical findings regarding DAPL’s failure to comply \nwith easement conditions, for example, the requirement of independent power to shutoff valves \nnear Lake Oahe and an undocumented spill incident.   \n31.  The remand analysis calculates the risk and impacts of an oil spill based on \nDAPL’s original capacity.  The Corps conducted no new analyses to respond to DAPL’s \nannounced intention to increase capacity by 100,000 barrels a day.  Such an increase \nfundamentally alters both the risks of a spill as well as its potential impacts.  As such, the remand \nanalysis is already out of date and inapplicable to anticipated future operations of the pipeline.   \n \nEarthjustice \nFIRST SUPPLEMENTAL COMPLAINT \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n(No. 1:16-cv-1534-JEB)   Seattle, WA  98104 \n- 10 -  (206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 371-1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 11 of 16\n32.  The above examples are intended as illustrations of the flaws in the Corps’ \nanalysis, not a comprehensive list. \n33.  These and other fundamental flaws in the Corps’ estimate of the risk and impact \nof oil spills infect all three of the remand topics.  For example, the Remand Analysis dismisses \nthe potential impacts to the Tribe’s Treaty hunting and fishing rights by reasoning that the risk of \nan oil spill is low and its impacts manageable—a conclusion that is fundamentally flawed due to \nthe underestimated WCD and the other reasons discussed above.  Similarly, the Remand \nAnalysis dismisses the environmental justice implications of the pipeline permits by, again, \nrelying on the claimed low likelihood and manageable impacts of a spill.  And it simply ignores \nmost of the technical input provided by the Tribe in the Remand Report, thereby sidestepping the \nCourt’s directive to address the “controversy” over the Corps’ conclusions on spill risk and \nimpact.  Contrary to the Corps’ conclusions, the record reflects extensive unaddressed \n“controversy” over its WCD, risk analysis, impact analysis, and other conclusions.  \n34.  The Remand Analysis incorporates and relies on a number of technical documents \nthat are cited throughout the document.  For example, the “Spill Model Report” is a technical \ndocument describing the results of various oil spill scenarios.  The “Downstream Receptor \nReport” is a technical document assessing fate and transport of spilled crude.  The “Submission \nReview” is an assessment of the various comments submitted by the Tribe and other Tribes.  \nNone of these documents, or any other technical documents, was ever made available to the \nTribe during the course of the remand, despite many requests.  Nor have they been made \navailable to the Tribe or its counsel subsequent to the finalization of the Remand Analysis, again \ndespite requests.  \n \nEarthjustice \nFIRST SUPPLEMENTAL COMPLAINT \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n(No. 1:16-cv-1534-JEB)   Seattle, WA  98104 \n- 11 -  (206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 371-1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 12 of 16\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n  FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF – VIOLATION OF NEPA \n35.  Plaintiff hereby alleges and incorporates and restates all previous paragraphs of \nthis complaint and of the Amended Complaint. \n36.  Under NEPA, federal agencies are required to prepare an EIS for “major Federal \nactions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.”  42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C).   \n37.  Binding Council of Environmental Quality (“CEQ”) regulations further define \nwhether impacts are “significant” enough to warrant a full EIS, requiring consideration of both \n“context” (i.e., the various scales, regions, and interests affected by the action) and “intensity” \n(i.e., the “severity of the impact”).  40 C.F.R. § 1508.27.  With respect to the latter, the \nregulations lay out several factors that are to be considered.  Examples of these criteria include: \n“the degree to which the proposed action affects public health or safety”; “unique characteristics \nof the geographic area such as proximity to historic or cultural resources…”; the degree to which \nthe effects on the environment “are likely to be highly controversial,” are “highly uncertain” or \n“involve unique or unknown risks”; and “the degree to which the action … may cause loss or \ndestruction of significant scientific, cultural, or historical resources.”  Id. \n38.  In June of 2017, the Court found “significant” flaws in the Army Corps’ analysis \nof the risk and impacts of its decision to authorize DAPL underneath Lake Oahe, and ordered the \nCorps to conduct a remand to give “serious consideration” those flaws.  The three flaws \nidentified by the Court—involving the Tribe’s treaty rights, the environmental justice \nimplications, and the “controversy” attending its spill and impact analysis—struck at the heart of \nthe Tribe’s concerns with the Corps’ review of DAPL.   \n \nEarthjustice \nFIRST SUPPLEMENTAL COMPLAINT \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n(No. 1:16-cv-1534-JEB)   Seattle, WA  98104 \n- 12 -  (206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 371-1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 13 of 16\n39.  By concluding the remand by affirming its original decision, the Corps acted \narbitrarily, capriciously, contrary to the evidence before it, and in violation of NEPA and the \nCEQ regulations and contrary to the APA.  The Corps also acted arbitrarily, capriciously, and in \nviolation of NEPA and the CEQ regulations by failing to meaningfully engage with the Tribe by \nproviding information so that the Tribe could provide input during the remand. \n  SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF – FAILURE TO CONSIDER IMPACTS \nTO TREATY RIGHTS \n40.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs and of the Amended \nComplaint. \n41.  The Tribe holds vested Treaty rights in the Tribe’s lands within the Standing \nRock Sioux Reservation and the waters of Lake Oahe.  These rights include reserved water rights \nand Treaty rights to hunt, fish, and gather natural resources within the Reservation including the \nwaters of Lake Oahe.  The Tribe’s rights include the right to clean, safe water to sustain a livable \npermanent homeland and self-sufficiency for the Tribe and its people.  By virtue of various acts \nof Congress including the Pick-Sloan Act of 1944, the Corps manages and controls in many \nrespects the waters of Lake Oahe, where the Tribe exercises its Treaty rights.   \n42.  The Corps, by virtue of the Treaties, federal statutes, and the federal trust \nresponsibility, has a duty to consider the Tribe’s Treaty rights, including the Reservation, \nreserved water rights, and rights to hunt, fish, and gather, when taking other actions, and to avoid \ntaking actions that would damage, degrade or destroy these rights.  The Corps must fully assess, \nin consultation with the Tribe, the impacts of its actions like authorizations, permits, and \neasements for a pipeline crossing Treaty rights areas, and ensure that the Tribe’s Treaty rights \nwill be safeguarded.  \n \nEarthjustice \nFIRST SUPPLEMENTAL COMPLAINT \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n(No. 1:16-cv-1534-JEB)   Seattle, WA  98104 \n- 13 -  (206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 371-1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 14 of 16\n43.  In issuing the original permit, and in affirming them at the conclusion of the \nremand process, the Corps failed to adequately consider the Tribe’s treaty rights and its \nobligations to protect those rights.  It further ignored policies related to consultation with Tribes \non actions that impact treaty rights.  As a result, its conclusions were arbitrary, capricious, and \notherwise not in accordance with the Corps’ duties under the Treaties, its trust responsibility, and \nits obligation to consult appropriately under its U.S. government policies, in violation of the \nAPA.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court grant the following relief:  \n1.  Declare that the Remand Analysis, and the underlying MLA easement which it \nattempted to address, is arbitrary, capricious, and in violation of the NEPA and APA;  \n2.  Vacate the Remand Analysis, the final environmental analysis and finding of no \nsignificant impact, and the underlying MLA easement pending full compliance with the law; \n3.  Direct the Corps to resume the EIS process initiated in November 2016, and \nprovide the Tribe with all technical documents related to oil spill and impact so that it can \nparticipate meaningfully in such EIS process;  \n4.  Retain jurisdiction over this matter to ensure that the Corps complies with the \nlaw; \n5.  Award Plaintiff its reasonable fees, costs, expenses, and disbursements, including \nattorneys’ fees, associated with this litigation; and \n6.  Grant Plaintiff such further and additional relief as the Court may deem just and \nproper. \n \n \nEarthjustice \nFIRST SUPPLEMENTAL COMPLAINT \n705 Second Ave., Suite 203 \n(No. 1:16-cv-1534-JEB)   Seattle, WA  98104 \n- 14 -  (206) 343-7340 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 371-1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 15 of 16\nRespectfully submitted this 1st day of November, 2018. \n/s/ Jan E.

      "text": "Case 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 392   Filed 01/10/19   Page 1 of 6\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \n  FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n \n     \nSTANDING ROCK SIOUX TRIBE, \n \n  Plaintiff, \n \n            and \n \nCHEYENNE RIVER SIOUX TRIBE, \n \n  Plaintiff-Intervenor, \n \n  v.  Civil Action No. 16-1534 (JEB) (and \nConsolidated Case Nos. 16-267 and \n16-1769) \nU.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS,    \n   \nDefendant, \n \n            and \n \nDAKOTA ACCESS, LLC, \n \n  Defendant-Intervenor and Cross-    \n            Claimant. \n \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINON AND ORDER \nIn this long-running battle between American Indian Tribes and the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers over the Dakota Access Pipeline, the parties have engaged in an extensive motions \npractice, requiring the Court to issue myriad substantive Opinions.  Now, as the litigants focus on \nthe Corps’ remand efforts, one Tribe – the Oglala Sioux – asks to rewind the clock and amend its \nComplaint to return to an issue long since decided.  As such amendment is both prejudicial to \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 392   Filed 01/10/19   Page 2 of 6\nDefendants and futile, inasmuch as the Court has already addressed it, the Motion to Amend will \nbe denied. \nI.  Background \nAlthough the parties have briefed a congeries of complex issues throughout this \nlitigation, the one relevant to this Motion is the allegation by a number of Tribes that the Corps \nviolated the National Environmental Policy Act in early 2017 when it withdrew its notice of \nintent (NOI) to prepare an environmental-impact statement (EIS) and issued an easement to \nDakota Access to build its pipeline under Lake Oahe on the Missouri River.  See Standing Rock \nSioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 255 F. Supp. 3d 101, 117-20 (D.D.C. 2017).  This \nwas one subject (of many) that the Court addressed in its summary-judgment Opinion, issued in \nJune 2017, in which it held that the Corps’ reversal of field on this point was not arbitrary and \ncapricious.  Id. at 143.  In that Opinion, the Court granted Defendants summary judgment in part, \nfinding that the Government had substantially complied with NEPA, but remanding certain \nmatters unrelated to the NOI for the Corps to reconsider.  Id. at 112. \nThe remand is now complete, and the Court has set a briefing schedule relating to the \nadministrative record on remand and will then proceed to entertain another round of summary-\njudgment briefing, this time about the remand issues.  It permitted all Plaintiffs an opportunity to \nseek to supplement or amend their Complaints relating to remand.  Many have done so, which \nthe Court has permitted, see Minute Order of Jan. 3, 2019, as the supplementation relates solely \nto the remand process.  The Oglala Sioux alone have also sought to augment a claim unrelated to \nremand.  The Tribe asks for permission to add only one sentence of additional allegations.  More \nspecifically, it wishes to allege that the Corps’ decision to withdraw the NOI and issue the \neasement was made without reviewing thousands of submissions in response to the NOI.  See \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 392   Filed 01/10/19   Page 3 of 6\nECF No. 376 (Motion to Amend) at 3.  The Corps and Defendant-Intervenor Dakota Access \nresist, arguing that this ship has long since sailed. \nII.  Legal Standard \nA plaintiff may amend her complaint once as a matter of course within 21 days of serving \nit or within 21 days of being served a responsive pleading.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(1).  \nOtherwise, she must seek consent from the defendant or leave from the court.  See Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 15(a)(2).  “The court should freely give leave when justice so requires.”  Id.  In deciding \nwhether to grant leave to file an amended complaint, the court may consider “undue delay, bad \nfaith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by \namendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of \nthe amendment, futility of amendment, etc.”  Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962).  In this \nCircuit, “it is an abuse of discretion to deny leave to amend unless there is sufficient reason.”  \nFirestone v. Firestone, 76 F.3d 1205, 1208 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  Furthermore, under Rule 15, “the \nnon-movant generally carries the burden in persuading the court to deny leave to amend.”  \nNwachukwu v. Karl, 222 F.R.D. 208, 211 (D.D.C. 2004). \nIt is clear, however, that amendment should not be permitted if it would be futile.  In \nother words, if the proposed amendment would render the complaint deficient, the court need not \ngrant leave.  See In re Interbank Funding Corp. Sec. Litig., 629 F.3d 213, 218 (D.C. Cir. 2010) \n(“[A] district court may properly deny a motion to amend if the amended pleading would not \nsurvive a motion to dismiss.”); James Madison Ltd. v. Ludwig, 82 F.3d 1085, 1099 (D.C. Cir. \n1996) (“Courts may deny a motion to amend a complaint as futile . . . if the proposed claim \nwould not survive a motion to dismiss.”). \n   \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 392   Filed 01/10/19   Page 4 of 6\nIII.  Analysis \nIn contesting Plaintiff’s Motion to Amend, Defendants argue that the proposed \namendment here is both prejudicial and futile.  As to the former, Defendants correctly point out \nfirst that this is no simple litigation.  The docket’s heft bears this out.  Three cases have been \nconsolidated involving multiple Tribes, numerous individuals, and many amici.  Parties have \nintervened on both Plaintiffs’ and Defendants’ side.  The Court has issued numerous lengthy \nOpinions, including expedited ones on preliminary-injunction motions.  Through it all, the Court \nhas endeavored to manage the litigation in a way that permits all parties to be heard and that \ndevotes significant time and attention to the claims and defenses raised.  The current Motion \nseeks to derail and substantially delay that train.  See Thorp v. Dist. of Columbia, 325 F.R.D. \n510, 514 (D.D.C. 2018) (“Such prejudice is particularly pronounced because Plaintiff’s Motion \narrives at a critical juncture of [the] case . . . [where] the issues in this case . . . [have] been \nnarrowed by the Court’s prior Opinion . . . [and] the parties’ cross-motions for summary \njudgment are now ripe.”) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \nAlthough the principal Plaintiffs – the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne \nRiver Sioux Tribe – filed their suits in July and August 2016, the Oglala Sioux waited to file \ntheir initial Complaint until February 2017.  See No. 17-267, ECF No. 1.  The Tribe has also \nnow waited almost two years to seek amendment, even though the litigation has been proceeding \nthrough different stages.  In so doing, it offers no explanation whatsoever for such delay.  This \ndelay alone is sufficient grounds to deny the Motion.   \nOnce the Court granted summary judgment to the Corps on most claims while remanding \nothers, moreover, it fully expected that only the remanded claims would remain to be decided.  \nWhile the Oglala Sioux argue that the Court permitted amendment following remand, this was \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 392   Filed 01/10/19   Page 5 of 6\nsimply for Plaintiffs to refine any claims relating to remand, not to return to the starting blocks.  \nTo permit one Plaintiff among many to reset the litigation would prejudice at least Dakota \nAccess, which has long had to balance its obligations regarding the operation of the pipeline with \nthe demands of this litigation.  To require it and the Government to relitigate issues already \ndecided at an earlier stage would impose substantial expense and concomitant uncertainty.       \nIn addition, the Tribe has already raised the points it seeks to include in an Amended \nComplaint, thus showing the futility of amendment now.  In previously setting forth NEPA \nclaims, the Tribe alleged in its initial Complaint that “[t]he Corps’ decision to withdraw the NOI \nfor the EIS before the end of the public comment period and without holding a scoping session \nviolated NEPA.”  Id., ¶ 88.  In its summary-judgment briefing on the NEPA allegations, \nfurthermore, the parties directly contested the propriety of the Corps’ issuance of the NOI.  The \nOglala Sioux, appearing as amicus for Standing Rock’s motion for summary judgment, \nspecifically asserted that “[t]he withdrawal of the NOI is arbitrary and capricious because it does \nnot take into account the comments of the [Oglala Sioux] and its expert . . . , or other numerous \ncomments received by the Corps subsequent to the EA.”  ECF No. 138 (Oglala Sioux Amicus \nBrief) at 20.  Cheyenne River, similarly, contended that the Corps did not consider “more than \n200,000 comments filed in response to the EIS Notice.”  ECF No. 131 (Cheyenne River MSJ) at \n5 n.3.  This Court nonetheless determined that the withdrawal of the NOI and the issuance of the \neasement was not arbitrary and capricious.  Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, 255 F. Supp. 3d at 143.  \nWhile its earlier Opinion may not have specifically addressed the comments issue the Tribe \nseeks to include now, that question was subsumed in the NEPA claim regarding the issuance of \nthe easement.  The Tribe’s desire to offer slightly different arguments would not change the \nresult.   \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 392   Filed 01/10/19   Page 6 of 6\nThe Court, accordingly, ORDERS that the Oglala Sioux’s Motion to Amend is DENIED. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n/s/ James E.

Amici States include both those States that the Dakota \nAccess Pipeline passes through and those that it does not. But all Amici States, even those that the \npipeline does not pass through, stand to suffer disastrous consequences if the easement allowing \noperation of the pipeline is vacated.  \nFirst, many Amici States produce large amounts of grain currently shipped by rail—grain \nthat  will  suffer  displacement,  owing  to  competition  with  higher-revenue  oil  for  access  rail \ntransport, if the Dakota Access Pipeline is shut down. Such competition is likely to revisit the \nmarket conditions that obtained before the pipeline became operational in 2017, namely intractable \nrailroad congestion, rotting grain, higher food prices and, ultimately, a potential for food shortages.  \nThe Dakota Access Pipeline transports 570,000 barrels of crude oil per day, and if this \nCourt vacates the easement that allows it to operate, the market will demand that as much of that \noil as possible be diverted to other modes of transport. Railroads present the only viable alternative, \nmeaning that Bakken crude will compete for train space with the agricultural sector, which pro-\nduces food not only for the nation, but the world.  \nThe universal market principle of arbitrage dictates that commodities flow from low value \nareas to high value areas so long as the cost of transportation is less than the price difference. That \nprinciple explains why North Dakota oil—which carries a much higher value than grain—will find \na way to move either east or west by pipeline or rail to find a market, at the expense of stranding \ngrain at its production origins. In that environment, transportation competition from the oil indus-\n1 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 514   Filed 05/01/20   Page 7 of 28\n     \n \ntry makes the cost of procuring grain greater than the resale value, i.e., greater than the price dif-\nference between origin and destination. And so substantial portions of the Nation’s grain harvest \nwill sit and rot because it would be too expensive to transport. Amici States have a strong interest \nin preventing such a dire disruption of the food chain, especially amidst a global pandemic and \nother dramatic threats to worldwide food security.  \nSecond, crude oil shipments by rail or truck pose greater safety hazards than shipments by \npipeline. Data show that pipeline transport of crude have yielded fewer accidents, injuries and \ndeaths than truck and rail shipments, such that pipeline transport is both cheaper and less likely to \ncause widespread destruction—such as the rail accident that incinerated much of the town of Lac-\nMégantic, Quebec, with Bakken crude. And because railroad regulations are set by federal law, \nstate and local governments have very little recourse to protect their citizens against such accidents. \nMoreover, shipment by rail or by truck (in comparison with shipment by pipeline) has greater \nenvironmental effects due to the increased amount of greenhouse gases emitted by trains and au-\ntomobiles.  \nFor these reasons, Amici State urge this Court to leave the easement in place, allowing the \nDakota Access Pipeline to operate while the Army Corps of Engineers prepares the EIS.  \nARGUMENT \nWhen support for an agency rule is legally insufficient, “the decision to remand or vacate \nhinges upon court’s assessment of ‘the seriousness of the . . . deficiencies (and thus the extent of \ndoubt whether the agency chose correctly) and the disruptive consequences of an interim change \nthat may itself be changed.’” Chamber of Commerce v. S.E.C., 443 F.3d 890, 908 (D.C. Cir. 2006) \n(ellipsis in original; quoting Allied-Signal, Inc. v. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Comm’n, 988 F.2d 146, \n150–51 (D.C. Cir. 1993)). These factors are “balance[d]” against each other, and a “strong showing \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 514   Filed 05/01/20   Page 8 of 28\n     \n \nof one factor may obviate the need to find a similar showing of the other.” Am. Bankers Ass’n v. \nNat’l Credit Union Admin., 934 F.3d 649, 674 (D.C. Cir. 2019).  \nHere, remand without vacatur of the easement is appropriate because there is a “high like-\nlihood” vacatur “would cause significant disruption.” Defenders of Wildlife v. Jackson, 791 F. \nSupp. 2d 96, 118 (D.D.C. 2011). The widespread economic and safety disruptions that would arise \nfrom vacatur would far outweigh any actual harm caused by the short-term lack of an environmen-\ntal impact statement, which, after all, is a procedural agency obligation designed to provide more \npublic information, but which does not itself hold the prospect of changing the substantive outcome \nof the Corps’ ultimate decision about the easement. See Citizens Against Burlington, Inc. v. Busey, \n938 F.2d 190, 194 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (holding that the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) \nmandates certain procedures for agency action that may impact the environment, but not certain \nresults). The Dakota Access Pipeline has already been constructed, the oil is flowing, and the \nAmerican economy has come to rely on its benefits as an alternative to rail or truck transport. \n“Where the proverbial ‘egg has been scrambled and there is no apparent way to restore the status \nquo ante,’ the Court may remand without vacating.” Defenders of Wildlife, 791 F. Supp. 2d at 118. \nI.  Shutting Down DAPL Would Both Disrupt the Flow of Oil from the Bakken Fields \nand Tie Up Transportation for Other Commodities, Especially Grain \n \nShutting down DAPL would prove enormously disruptive to the producers and consumers \nwho have “relied on it in good faith” for years. A.L. Pharma, Inc. v. Shalala, 62 F.3d 1484, 1492 \n(D.C. Cir. 1995). As it happens, one need not speculate about how the world of commodities trans-\nportation would look without DAPL, for the agriculture economy sustained substantial congestion \nand attendant losses when the Bakken fields began pumping crude before DAPL opened. Shutting \ndown the pipeline would at the very least revisit those unsustainable market conditions. Vacatur \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 514   Filed 05/01/20   Page 9 of 28\n     \n \nwould divert hundreds of thousands of barrels of crude oil to rail transport. ECF No. 512-2, Dec-\nlaration of William J. Rennicke ¶ 5.a. And, because railways cannot adapt quickly to heightened \ndemand on capital-intensive infrastructure, crude oil would thereby displace grain commodities, \ndisrupt the economics of grain distribution and, ultimately, threaten the food supply chain. Partic-\nularly amidst a global pandemic and the recession it is inducing, the risk of creating conditions for \nfood insecurity in various pockets of the country—and of bankrupting farmers—makes vacatur \ninappropriate. \nA.  DAPL alleviated otherwise intractable logistical problems that arose for the na-\ntion’s farmers and food supply when Bakken oil displaced grain commodities on \ncritical railway corridors  \n \n1.  One fundamental of the commodities transportation market is that grain producers \nhave very few transportation options. Agricultural products are grown in remote, highly distributed \nfields, requiring farmers and dealers to aggregate grain from multiple sources for shipping to far-\naway food-processing purchasers. ECF No. 512-4, Declaration of Elaine Kub ¶ 8. Grain is too \nheavy to be transported economically as air cargo, and remote agricultural areas lack access to \ninland waterways. ECF No. 512-2 (Rennicke) ¶ 53. That leaves truck and rail, but trucks require \nfar more labor: While every truck needs a driver, a small team can drive a train carrying large \namounts of grain in multiple cars. Trains also use less fuel than a large fleet of trucks. Association \nof American Railroads, The Environmental Benefits of Moving Freight by Rail 1 (2019), available \nat  https://www.aar.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AAR-Environmental-Benefits-Movig-\nFreight-by-Rail.pdf.   \nAs a result, grain farmers have grown to rely substantially on rail for long-haul shipping; \nrail is “the primary source of transportation for moving the region’s bulk products, such as grain, \ncrude oil, and ores,” and in turn “agricultural products in aggregate represent 42 percent of rail \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 514   Filed 05/01/20   Page 10 of 28\n     \n \nloadings, with cereal grains accounting for nearly 24 percent of rail tonnage originating in the \nregion in 2018.” ECF No. 512-2 (Rennicke) ¶ 52.  \nCereal grains grown in the Upper Midwest or Rocky Mountain regions, like hard red spring \nwheat and barley from Montana and North Dakota, must typically be shipped westward toward \nmills and export facilities in the Pacific Northwest. See Grain Car Consolidation Facility Impact \nAnalysis,  2010  Montana  State  Rail  Plan  5-3,  available  at  https://www.mdt.mt.gov/publica-\ntions/docs/brochures/railways/railplan_sect5.pdf. In fact, Montana and North Dakota rely on rail \nservice to ship the vast majority of their grain out of State, Montana 84.6% and North Dakota \n79.2%. ECF No. 512-4 (Kub) Table 1. Meanwhile, the markets for oilseeds and feed grains from \nthe central Corn Belt States (primarily corn and soybeans) also rely on rail service to move grain \nsouth to export customers at the Gulf of Mexico, southwest toward cattle feeding facilities in the \nUnited States and Mexico, west toward dairies in California, or southeast toward poultry feeding \nfacilities in Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, and North Carolina. Xiaowen Lin et al., Food Flows \nBetween Counties in the United States, Environmental Research Letters, July 26, 2019, available \nat https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab29ae/pdf.  \nOverall, “the states of Illinois, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Montana rank 1, \n5, 8, 11, and 15, respectively in the US for transported grain originations (all modes), accounting \nfor 29 percent of all domestic originations in the United States.” ECF No. 512-2 (Rennicke) ¶ 52. \n2.  In the past decade, rapidly developing technology has made it feasible to extract oil \nfrom underground shale rock formations in the Bakken region of North Dakota. As the volume of \noil from that region increased, limited pipeline capacity meant that producers had to rely on rail \ntankers for transportation. Owing to the standard length of available railroad sidings, trains have a \npractical limit of just over 100 cars, and the railroads, already stretched to capacity with grain \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 514   Filed 05/01/20   Page 11 of 28\n     \n \nshipments, struggled to handle both crude oil and grain. Ivan Atanassov & C. Tyler Dick, Capacity \nof Single-Track Railway Lines with Short Sidings to Support Operation of Long Freight Trains, \n2475 Transportation Research Record 95, 95–96, available at https://railtec.illinois.edu/wp/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/01/Atanassov-et-al-2015-TRB-15-6026-TRR-final.pdf.  \nAs a consequence, railroads scrambled to obtain sufficient oil tanker rail cars. Oil, as it \nhappens, provides railroads substantially greater revenue than grain. In 2013—before the pipeline \nbecame operational—railroads were receiving average revenue of over $56 per originated ton for \nshipping crude petroleum, but only $38.45 per originated ton for shipping field crops. Freight \nCommodity Statistics, Association of American Railroads (2013), A.1, A.3 (dividing revenue for \nfield crops (011) and crude petroleum/natural gas (131) by originated tons for each); see also ECF \nNo. 512-4 (Kub) ¶ 30 (reciting similar data for 2018). So, from 2013 through 2015, unprecedented \nvolumes of crude oil tankers clogged the rail lines. ECF No. 512-4 (Kub) Figure 3. “In 2010, Class \nI railroads carried an average of 2 million barrels of crude oil per month; by 2014, this had in-\ncreased to an average of 31.8 million barrels per month, representing growth of more than 1,500 \npercent in four years (Exhibit 6). This run-up over several years was the result of domestic crude \noil production outpacing the development of pipeline capacity.” ECF No. 512-2 ¶ 19 (Rennicke) \n(footnotes omitted).  \nThe result was less rail capacity for the coal and grain that the trains had previously pulled. \nShippers of grain and other agricultural products saw significant increases in rates along oil-ship-\nment corridors, as well as historically high prices in the secondary grain railcar market (sublease \nprices bid among grain shippers for committed space on railcars). ECF No. 512-4 (Kub) ¶ 14. \nAverage bids just to get car space—above the tariff rate and fuel surcharges paid directly to rail-\nroads—reached a record high of $4,625 per car at the start of October 2014, equivalent to $1.03 \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 514   Filed 05/01/20   Page 12 of 28\n     \n \nper bushel paid by a grain shipper. U.S. Dep’t of Agriculture, Grain Transportation Report (Oct. \n2,  2014),  available  at  https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/GTR_10-02-14.pdf. \nThese higher freight costs yielded lower revenues for farmers, not only in areas where grain ship-\nments were dependent on rail transportation, but all across America where the secondary freight \nprices were inflated by competition between crude oil and grain. Id.  \nIn addition, service levels for grain deteriorated as crude by rail shipments increased. ECF \nNo. 512-4 (Kub) ¶ 16. In October of 2014, both grain and ethanol trains were moving as slow as \n19.8 mph. Id. ¶ 24. Trains carrying grain or ethanol were also more likely to have longer dwell \ntimes at their origin (loading) location—up to 35 hours per week for trains carrying grain and 35.8 \nhours for ethanol trains—74% longer than average. Id. Chicago became a particular chokepoint, \nwith rail capacity falling for both eastward and westward routes. ECF No. 512-2 (Rennicke) ¶ 82. \nWestward rail routes proved particularly vulnerable to freight congestion, as the few rail \npassages across the Rocky Mountains meant that a bottleneck on any route left all the grain behind \nit stranded. Id. ¶ 47. In January 2014, “grain unit trains from Minnesota to the Pacific Northwest \nwere taking up to 22 days, compared to a normal transit time of 12 days,” with grain carloads \nlagging behind normal levels in the tens (and hundreds) of thousands compared with prior years. \nId. ¶ 63. Observers traced the problem back to Bakken crude. “The executive director of the Min-\nnesota Grain and Feed Association blamed crude oil shipments for increasing congestion in re-\ngional rail yards (such as St. Paul and Chicago).” Id. ¶ 63. \nMoreover, congestion in rail shipments also posed problems for other industries. Ethanol \nrefineries experienced a spike in transportation rates that mirrored the increase in crude-by-rail \nshipments, prompting them to scale back production when they were unable to obtain rail cars for \ntransport. Id. ¶ 79. In 2014, a grain ship was held up for nearly a month in the Port of Duluth \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 514   Filed 05/01/20   Page 13 of 28\n     \n \nwaiting for rail shipments. Id. ¶ 72. And Mosaic, a Minneapolis-based fertilizer company, saw a \n43% decline in earnings due to its inability to make spring fertilizer shipments. Id. ¶ 77. Congestion \nproblems also caused disruption for auto manufacturers that were unable to ship new cars to deal-\ners. Id. ¶ 81.  \nAll of this congestion and delay in rail service led to higher food prices for consumers and \nlower profits for farmers. In 2014, North Dakota farmers experienced depressed corn basis prices, \n$1.25 less than the benchmark futures price, nearly double the usual $0.65 discount off the futures \nprice. ECF No. 512-4 (Kub) at 15–16. Similarly, in the central Corn Belt, where local corn basis \nprices tend to be around $0.05 less than the benchmark futures price, local corn prices dropped by \na factor of eight to $0.40 less than the benchmark futures price during the freight congestion of \n2014.  \nTo be sure, these depressed basis prices were the result of many factors (including compet-\nitive forces between rail shippers and domestic processors that don’t rely on rail service). Yet the \ndata make clear that transportation costs are the primary influence on grain basis-price differen-\ntials. In 2015, USDA’s Office of the Chief Economist and the Agricultural Marketing Service, \nconcluded that, even accounting for the many variables at play, Upper Midwest farmers may have \nreceived $570 million less for their crops in 2014 than they would have earned in a regular seasonal \ntransport cost environment. ECF No. 512-4 (Kub) ¶ 13. \n3.  When DAPL opened in 2017, it provided much-needed transportation relief for the \nBakken region. In 2014, the volume of crude oil shipped by rail hit a peak of 31.8 million barrels \nper month. ECF No. 512-2 (Rennicke) ¶ 19. In 2017, the volume of crude shipped by rail declined \nto a low of less than 10 million barrels per month, and by 2019 remained at a mere 70% of the \nvolume shipped by rail in 2014. Id. ¶ 19 & Ex. 6. As a percentage of Bakken crude, “at the end of \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 514   Filed 05/01/20   Page 14 of 28\n     \n \n2014, rail accounted for about 60 percent of North Dakota crude oil production, dropping to 17 \npercent of production in 2019; at the same time, pipeline share grew from about 31 percent in 2014 \nto 72 percent in 2019.” Id. ¶ 20. \nThat relief benefitted grain farmers and shippers as well, for transporting crude oil by pipe-\nline frees up rail capacity for agricultural products, plain and simple. The ultra-depressed North \nDakota corn basis, seen at $1.20 less than the benchmark futures contract during the peak of the \nfreight congestion in 2014, has once again settled in its normal seasonal basis of $0.65 less than \nthe benchmark futures contract price. ECF No. 512-4 (Kub) ¶ 22. Nationwide, rail service to the \ngrain industry has returned to normal train speeds and dwell times. Id. Table 2.  \nB.  Shutting down the pipeline would return to pre-DAPL railroad congestion—this \ntime amidst a global pandemic where food security is already compromised \n \nVacating the DAPL easement would force oil producers to find new ways of transporting \noutput, with a likely return to pre-DAPL depression on corn basis prices, and worse. While three \nnon-DAPL pipelines also transport oil from the Bakken, they have capacity for at most 12–18 \npercent of the oil that would be displaced as result of vacatur. See ECF No. 512-2 (Rennicke) ¶ 5.a. \nFor the balance, rail—itself two or three times more expensive than pipeline—is the only econom-\nically viable alternative, as shipping crude by truck can be twice as expensive as rail. Megan E. \nHansen & Ethan Dursteler, Pipelines, Rail & Trucks, Strata, at 3. At trucking transport rates, the \nprice advantage Bakken crude generally enjoys over other sources of crude evaporates. See ECF \nNo. 512-2 (Rennicke) ¶ 5.a. (stating that Bakken crude that cannot be transported by pipeline or \nrail “would have no immediate viable transportation outlet”). \nIf the pipeline is shut down, it will displace 208.1 million barrels of crude oil per year. \nEven if only one-third of the displaced crude were transported by rail, the result would still be \ncrude volumes exceeding the average amount of crude on railways in 2014—and even approaching \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 514   Filed 05/01/20   Page 15 of 28\n     \n \nthe maximum volume of that year. Id. ¶¶ 20, 22 & Ex. 7. And now, amplifying the congestion, \nregulatory changes since 2014 will push crude oil trains onto the hazardous materials network, a \nmore limited set of tracks featuring “positive train control,” or PTC. It happens, however, that \n“PTC corridors are also rail main lines, which already have among the highest overall traffic den-\nsities . . . .” Id. ¶ 25. As a consequence, “[d]iverting DAPL’s volume to rail could create a higher \nlevel of congestion on the region’s rail lines than that which was experienced during the last peak \nin rail shipments of crude oil, in 2014.” Id. ¶ 27. \nYet railroads are already operating near full capacity, so even small, unexpected changes \nin the supply or demand for rail services may cause significant problems. Id. ¶ 5.c. If the DAPL \noil is shipped by rail rather than by pipeline, the effects will be largely felt in certain corridors \nwhere the oil is shipped, and many of these corridors already carry high density shipments of other \ngoods. Id. ¶ 59. Because crude oil must be shipped from the Bakken to Patoka or Chicago, Illinois, \nrail lines in the upper Midwest would experience the worst of the congestion. Id. ¶ 32. And since \nPatoka does not currently have rail access, facilities will need to be built to accommodate multiple \nloads of crude oil per day. Id.  \nMoreover, grain shippers are especially vulnerable to price spikes because they do not enter \ninto long-term transportation contracts with railroads due to varying shipment volumes and chang-\ning routes. See Expanding Access to Rate Relief: Opening Comments of National Grain and Feed \nAssociation and Other Interested Agricultural Parties, STB Docket No. EP. 665 (Sub-No.2), No-\nvember 14, 2016, at 4-6, https://www.ngfa.org/wp-content/uploads/NGFA-and-Other-Interested-\nAgricultural-Parties-Statement-to-STB-on-Rail-Rate-Proceeding-EP-665-2Nov.-14-2016.pdf. \nFor this reason, agricultural producers require reliable and on-demand rail service to move prod-\n10 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 514   Filed 05/01/20   Page 16 of 28\n     \n \nucts quickly and meet favorable price windows. ECF No. 512-2 (Rennicke) ¶ 55. Added competi-\ntion from crude oil producers will likely reduce the competitiveness of farmers reliant on rail lines \nthat are already near or above capacity. Id.  \nSwitching the bulk of America’s long-haul grain movement from rail to truck would likely \nbe impossible. The trucking industry, already struggling to find sufficient drivers, Bob Costello, \nTruck Driver Shortage Analysis 2019, American Trucking Associations, at 2 (July 2019), is not \nequipped to move grain efficiently over the long-distance routes currently served by the rail sys-\ntem. Given the standard limit of 900 bushels per semi-truck load, the lost carrying capacity from \na single 110-car grain shuttle train would require 544 truckloads to haul an equivalent volume. For \nthose volumes, hauling a bushel of corn 1,730 miles from Minneapolis to Portland, Oregon rou-\ntinely costs about $1.31 by rail. See U.S. Dep’t of Agriculture, Grain Transportation Report (Oct. \n2, 2014), available at https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/GTR_10-02-14.pdf. But \nat the standard rate of $1.00 per truckload mile, those 900 bushels would cost $3.84 each for the \nsame 3,460 mile round-trip by semi. Truck transportation alone would thus very likely exceed the \narbitrage value of the corn itself—roughly $3.00 per bushel, see U.S. Dep’t of Agriculture, Grain \nTransportation  Report  (Apr.  23,  2020),  available  at  https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/de-\nfault/files/media/GTR04232020.pdf—with the result that, without rail service, billions of bushels \nof grain would be effectively stranded in the center of the continent, unable to reach coastal export \nfacilities or the central domestic processing facilities and collection points which underpin Amer-\nica’s food supply chain. \nIn addition, an influx of crude-by-rail traffic would almost certainly inflict substantial harm \non the economies of ag-dependent States, as exemplified by the following estimated losses: \n  Indiana: $24 to $59 million in revenue  \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 514   Filed 05/01/20   Page 17 of 28\n     \n \n  Minnesota: $98 to $243 million in revenue \n  Montana: $41 to $104 million in revenue  \n  North Dakota: $127 to $317 million in revenue \n  South Dakota: $55 to $137 million in revenue \nECF No. 512-4 (Kub) ¶ 39 & Table 3. In Indiana alone, those revenue losses would be the equiv-\nalent of 1,450 lost jobs. Id. What is more, recent analysis looking at present-day grain production \nvolumes in twelve high-producing States, applying the same methodology as the 2015 USDA \nstudy that revealed staggering farm losses from the 2014 congestion, suggests that if rail conges-\ntion were to affect the grain markets over an entire marketing year, the revenue losses to America’s \nfarmers could range from $526 million to $1.3 billion. Id. ¶ 38.  \nThese estimates do not include losses to other segments of the agriculture industry, includ-\ning ethanol plants, soybean processors, and other grain customers who must also transport their \nfinished goods by rail. The grain processing industry, struggling during a short-term slow-down in \ndemand during the COVID-19 pandemic, already faces challenging market conditions. When do-\nmestic demand slows for grain products (ethanol, distillers grain, soybean meal, and soybean oil), \na higher proportion of total production must be directed toward foreign sales. Before being ex-\nported in ocean-going vessels, grain products must first be transported to an export facility either \nby barge or rail. As it happens, the Illinois Waterway that normally ships agricultural goods from \nseveral surrounding States to the Mississippi will close for repairs from July through October 2020. \nLindsay Mitchell, Illinois River Will Close to Traffic in 2020, Illinois Corn, Nov. 12, 2018, \nhttps://ilcorn.org/news-and-media/current-news/article/2018/11/illinois-river-will-close-to-traf-\nfic-in-2020. Without that significant route for southbound agriculture exports, rail will be the only \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 514   Filed 05/01/20   Page 18 of 28\n     \n \nviable option for many processors to reach profitable markets—but not if Bakken crude takes over \nthe rail network. \nIn addition, in January of 2020, the United States entered into a two-year trade agreement \nthat provided China would purchase $40 billion of American agricultural products. In order to \nfulfill this trade deal, the United States will need to ship even higher volumes of grain by rail, \ncompared to record-high 2017 volumes, to the Gulf of Mexico or the Pacific Northwest for loading \non ocean vessels and shipping to China. These shipments will make the agriculture industry more \ndependent on timely rail service than ever before, and less able to withstand railroad congestion \nthan ever before. If these shipments are not made, Chinese purchasers will likely turn to South \nAmerican producers instead, which would cause U.S. farmers to lose billions of dollars along with \ntheir reputation as a reliable supplier. ECF No. 512-2 (Rennicke) ¶¶ 67–68.  \nMeanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic provides a stark demonstration of how food supply \nchain interruption harms both consumers and producers, with consumers already facing higher \nfood prices due to end-point shortages, and agricultural producers forced to discard (for zero rev-\nenue) perishable commodities, even as processing facilities contend with labor shortages. Already, \nCOVID-19 has forced meat processors such as Tyson to shutter facilities, leaving hog farmers with \nnowhere to send their hogs and, with new generations coming behind, nowhere to house them—\nwith massive porcine euthanasia (a threat to the availability of animal protein for a hungry world) \nbeing the contemplated result. Jacob Bunge & Kirk Maltais, Pork Industry, USDA Discuss Eu-\nthanizing  Hogs  After  Coronavirus  Closes  Plants,  Wall  Street  Journal,  Apr.  27,  2020, \nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/pork-industry-usda-discuss-euthanizing-hogs-after-coronavirus-\nclosesplants11588015611?shareToken=ste5d9e790670e42c5bada946ff0483acf&reflink=arti-\ncle_email_share. For some animals, however, another possibility may be that livestock will need \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 514   Filed 05/01/20   Page 19 of 28\n     \n \nto be fed for longer periods while farmers await processing capacity—further increasing volumes \nof grain to be shipped west, southwest, and southeast out of the Corn Belt in 2020.  \nEither way, the food supply chain already stands to be under duress in 2020. Agricultural \nministers from the G20 group of major developed and developing nations recently observed that, \nwhile the global inventory of agricultural commodities is presently sufficient, governments should \nnot create any “unnecessary . . . disruption to global food supply chains” and should avoid “food \nlosses and waste caused by disruptions throughout food supply chains, which would exacerbate \nfood insecurity and nutrition risks and economic loss.” G20 Extraordinary Agriculture Ministers \nMeeting Ministerial Statement on COVID-19 Virtual Meeting, April 21, 2020, https://g20.org/en/\nmedia/Documents/G20_Agriculture%20Ministers%20Meeting_Statement_EN.pdf.  Yet  adding \nBakken crude oil to the rail transport load would threaten to cause exactly the sort of disruption to \nthe global food supply chain that the G20 ministers warned about.   \nOn this point, it is worth observing that the recent precipitous decline in the price of oil \nfutures is unlikely to have any significant bearing on the market dynamics of shipping oil from the \nBakken region. Even when crude oil futures head into negative territory, Bakken crude will still \nmove as long as it represents a cheaper alternative to other sources of oil—and as long as it is \nworth more at the refinery at Patoka, Illinois than it is straight from the ground in Williston, North \nDakota. As long as Americans still need fuel to operate their cars, haul their goods, and conduct \nthe business of life, and as long as traders can make the oil worth more by transporting it to a \nhigher-value location, arbitrage will take place, and oil will move, at the cost of pushing grain off \nthe nation’s railways. \nWith no substitute freight provider available to serve America’s farmers, the implications \nof shutting down DAPL for the world’s food supply become unthinkable. If grain cannot be \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 514   Filed 05/01/20   Page 20 of 28\n     \n \nshipped from its origins and is stranded across the Midwest, swaths of grain customers with time-\ncritical needs—such as animal feedlots that demand grain each day—would quickly fail, with \nstaggering implications for animal welfare and food security. The most food-secure nation on earth \ncould well experience food shortages, to say nothing of the consequences for developing nations \nwhose industries and food security also rely on American grain exports. \nThe mere delay in the Corps’ preparation of an EIS does not merit such drastic conse-\nquences.  \nII.  Shutting Down the Pipeline Will Threaten Safety and Create Environmental Hazards \nThe burdens of vacating the DAPL easement are not just a function of economic impact, \nas dramatic as those impacts will be. Rather, vacating the easement also threatens serious safety \nand environmental hazards owing to the volatility of crude oil and the potential for trains to collide \nand derail. \nTransporting crude oil by pipeline is safer than transporting it by rail or truck owing to the \nvolatility of the crude and the safety of pipelines compared to rail and truck shipments. A 2016 \nUSDOT comparison of freight-related fatalities among various modes of transportation showed \nthat rail transportation fatality rates were nearly 35 times higher than pipeline transportation on a \nper-billion ton-miles basis. United States Department of Transportation Federal Highway Admin-\nistration, Freight Quick Facts Report 32 Table 35 (2016). Trucks are even less safe. Crude oil \ntransportation by truck kills an average of 10.2 people per year, whereas rail transportation results \nin 2.4 fatalities per year and pipeline transportation results in 1.7 fatalities per year. Megan E. \nHansen & Ethan Dursteler, Pipelines, Rail & Trucks, Strata, at 4–5. And in terms of injuries (rather \nthan fatalities), rail transportation injury rates exceed 50 times the rate for pipeline shipments. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 514   Filed 05/01/20   Page 21 of 28\n     \n \nUnited States Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration, Freight Quick \nFacts Report 32 Table 35 (2016).  \nPipelines also compare favorably to rail when considered in terms of incident and accident \nrates. A 2015 report by the Fraser Institute showed that, for the decade 2003–13, rail transport of \ncrude oil was 4.5 more times more likely to result in an accident than pipeline transport of crude \noil. Fraser Research Bulletin 1. And a 2017 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research \nconcluded that, on a normalized cost-per-million-barrel-mile basis, crude-by-rail accidents and \nspills cost roughly 600% more than pipeline accidents and spills. Karen Clay et al., The External \nCosts of Transporting Petroleum Products by Pipelines and Rail: Evidence from Shipments of \nCrude Oil from North Dakota, National Bureau of Economic Research, at 20 (Sept. 2017). \nThe result is not simply higher economic costs, but sometimes tragic human suffering, such \nas happened in the 2013 rail disaster in Lac-Mégantic Quebec, when an unattended 74-car train \ncarrying Bakken crude oil rolled down some low-grade track, ultimately derailing. Lac-Mégantic \nRunaway Train and Derailment Investigation Summary, Transportation Safety Board of Canada, \nhttps://www.tsb.gc.ca/eng/rapports-reports/rail/2013/r13d0054/r13d0054-r-es.html. The resulting \nconflagration killed over 40 people and forced 2000 more people from their homes. Id. \nBy prompting shipment of crude by rail, an order from this Court vacating the DAPL ease-\nment will threaten States and localities with similar disasters. Absent the DAPL easement, Bakken \noil shipments will likely to cause 11.4 more accidents each year, with attendant additional injuries \nand fatalities, than would occur if the oil continues to be transported by pipeline. ECF No. 512-2 \n(Rennicke) ¶ 90 & Ex. 36. State and local governments have very few options to protect themselves \nfrom these costs owing to preemption by the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act, \n49 U.S.C. § 10501(b). In light of ICCTA, States and localities may not, for example, regulate the \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 514   Filed 05/01/20   Page 22 of 28\n     \n \nair pollution created by trains, Ass’n of Am. R.R. v. S. Coast Air Quality Mgmt. Dist., 622 F.3d \n1094 (9th Cir. 2010); prohibit railroad switching activities, City of Seattle v. Burlington N. R.R. \nCo., 41 P.3d 1169 (Wash. 2002); set speed limits for trains, CSX Transp., Inc. v. Easterwood, 507 \nU.S. 658 (1993); prohibit idling, Delaware v. Surface Transp. Bd., 859 F.3d 16 (D.C. Cir. 2017); \nset negligence standards for trains, Elam v. Kansas City Southern Ry. Co., 635 F.3d 796 (5th Cir. \n2011); or regulate the use of sidings, Maynard v. CSX Transp., Inc., 360 F. Supp. 2d 836 (E.D. \nKy. 2004).  \nIndeed, States and localities may not even prohibit trains from blocking intersections. See \nState v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 107 N.E.3d 468 (Ind. 2018). When trains block intersections, they \nimpose significant burdens on the economies and quality of life of rural (and sometimes urban) \ncommunities. “[S]uch blockages can impact public safety, because police and fire departments \nmay be delayed or unable to reach emergency sites or hospitals in the many communities where \nrail crossings intersect main roads, which are often the only viable routes in smaller and/or older \ntowns.” ECF No. 512-2 (Rennicke) ¶ 91. Towns in the Upper Midwest suffered increased instances \nof blocked intersections during the 2014 peak congestion—a circumstance likely to repeat if DAPL \nis shut down and more crude is transported by rail. Id. \nShipping crude by train is also likely to inflict substantial more environmental damage than \nshipping by pipeline, even as the Corps completes its EIS. Railroads would likely transport the \ndisplaced DAPL crude along main lines, which means introducing the hazardous cargo “near or \nthrough rivers, population centers, national parks, and many environmentally sensitive areas.” Id. \n¶ 95. These rail lines crisscross various branches and tributaries of the Mississippi and Missouri \nRivers, for example. Id. \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 514   Filed 05/01/20   Page 23 of 28\n     \n \n  Environmental protection in western States is of particular importance for the people liv-\ning, working, and recreating there. First, States such as Montana rely heavily on tourism revenues \nresulting from non-residents seeking to enjoy the pristine beauty of the environments of these \nStates. Consequently, in Montana, for example, “non-resident tourism supports 59,380 local jobs, \nadds over $3.7 billion to the economy annually, and contributes to the preservation of historical, \ncultural and recreational treasures.” COVID-19 Update—Tourism Industry for Montana, Voices \nof Montana Tourism, http://www.voicesoftourism.com/. As western States have experienced in \nrecent years with wildfires, environmental harms translate to lost tourism revenues. It is thus vital \nto the economies of western States that potential threats to the environment—such as oil spills \ncaused by train derailments—be minimized to the greatest extent possible.  \n  The potential environmental harms—and risks to human lives—from oil transported by \nrail are not hypothetical. For example, before DAPL became operational, in July 2015 a train haul-\ning oil from North Dakota derailed in rural northeastern Montana, and four tank cars leaked an \nestimated 35,000 gallons of oil. Matt Volz, 35,000 Gallons of Oil Spills After Montana Train De-\nrailment,  Independent  Record  (July  17,  2015),  available  at  https://helenair.com/missoula/ \nnews/state-and-regional/gallons-of-oil-spills-after-montana-train-derailment/article_9a7778f6-\ne118-5dad-afe3-3ea4aaf9a2d3.html. In addition to the 2013 Quebec derailment referenced above \n(in which 47 people were killed and much of the town of Lac-Megantic was incinerated), “trains \nhauling crude from the Bakken region of North Dakota and Montana have been involved in fiery \nderailments in six states.” Id. \n  If the easement is vacated and DAPL ceases to be operational, to the extent a significant \nadditional portion of Bakken oil is shipped westward by rail, it would pass through environmen-\ntally sensitive areas. Trains heading west from the Bakken skirt the banks of the upper Missouri \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 514   Filed 05/01/20   Page 24 of 28\n     \n \nRiver from Snowden, Montana, to east of Glasgow, Montana, nearly to Ft. Peck Lake. On the west \nside of Montana, the line climbs through the Rockies over Marias Pass and skirts the southern \nboundary of Glacier National Park from East Glacier to Columbia Falls. At Columbia Falls it \ncrosses the Flathead River heading west to Whitefish and then along the shore of Whitefish Lake. \nEast of Libby, Montana, the railroad parallels the Kootenai River all the way to Bonner’s Ferry, \nIdaho. These areas, including Glacier National Park, pristine wilderness, and blue ribbon trout \nstreams, are some of the most environmentally sensitive areas in the country. Oil spills from train \nderailments would not merely be disruptive; they would be devastating.  \n  Indeed, the beauty of the mountains and the clear running mountain rivers and streams \nbrought many people to make places like Montana their home. Thus, the importance of preserva-\ntion and protection of the environment cannot be overstated. In 1972 Montana adopted a new \nConstitution reflecting this value, as the first enumerated, inalienable, fundamental constitutional \nright is “the right to a clean and healthful environment.” Mont. Const. art. 2, sec. 3. This is not a \nmere aspirational statement. On the contrary, Article 9, section 1 of the Constitution mandates: \n(1) The state and each person shall maintain and improve a clean and healthful \nenvironment in Montana for present and future generations.  \n \n(2) The legislature shall provide for the administration and enforcement of this \nduty. \n \n(3) The legislature shall provide adequate remedies for the protection of the envi-\nronmental life support system from degradation and provide adequate remedies \nto prevent unreasonable depletion and degradation of natural resources.  \n \nThe right to a clean and healthy environment was deemed paramount by the delegates to Montana’s \n1972 Constitutional Convention and was, therefore, included as a fundamental right by a vote of \n79 to 7. Montana Constitutional Convention, Vol. V at 1640, March 7, 1972.  \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 514   Filed 05/01/20   Page 25 of 28\n     \n \nMoreover, as the Montana Supreme Court has concluded, “the delegates’ intention was to \nprovide language and protections which are both anticipatory and preventative”—and not “merely \nprohibit that degree of environmental degradation which can be conclusively linked to ill health or \nphysical endangerment.” Mont. Envtl. Info. Ctr. v. Dep’t of Envtl. Quality, 988 P.2d 1236, 1249 \n(Mont. 1999). Indeed, the Montana Constitution “does not require that dead fish float on the sur-\nface of our state’s rivers and streams before its farsighted environmental protections can be in-\nvoked.” Id. Rather, the legislature has a textual obligation “to provide adequate remedies for deg-\nradation of the environmental life support system and to prevent unreasonable degradation of nat-\nural resources,” period. Id. In short, a shut-down of DAPL would create an entirely avoidable set \nof dangers and risks to the values those in the West hold most dear. \nShutting down DAPL will likely introduce negative environmental externalities in other \nways as well. One study found that, for moving Bakken crude to the Gulf of Mexico in 2014, the \nsum of air pollution and greenhouse gas costs were nearly twice for rail as for pipeline. Karen Clay \net al., The External Costs of Transporting Petroleum Products by Pipelines and Rail: Evidence \nfrom Shipments of Crude Oil from North Dakota, National Bureau of Economic Research, at 15 \n(Sept. 2017). That report estimated that a fully loaded 100-car train of Bakken crude headed to the \nGulf Coast would impose air pollution and greenhouse gas costs of $150,000, compared to $78,000 \nif it moved by pipeline. Id. at 21. And as trains move through more densely populated areas, those \ncosts increase as trains idle for substantial periods of time in hubs like Chicago, often threatening \nmore environmental harm in under-resourced residential urban areas than affluent suburbs. Id. at \n11. By contrast, not only do pipelines pose no threat to residential urban areas themselves, but they \nterminate at refineries which do not sit in residential areas. Id. at 9.   \n*** \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 514   Filed 05/01/20   Page 26 of 28\n     \n \n  This case is ostensibly about the Corps’ failure to study the environmental impact of an oil \npipeline. But if pipeline flow must cease while the environment is studied, it is not only oil pro-\nducers who will suffer—so will grain farmers, the world food supply, public safety, and the envi-\nronment itself (particularly in the West). One way or another, oil will continue to pour out of the \nBakken fields. The questions for this Court are at what cost and whether, pending study of an oil \npipeline’s environmental impact, grain will too.  \nCONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, Amici States urge this Court not to vacate the easement that allows con-\ntinued operation of the Dakota Access Pipeline.  \n  Respectfully submitted, \n   \nTIM FOX  CURTIS T.

It\nis  \n   \nFURTHER ORDERED that, to the extent the district court issued an injunction by\nordering Dakota Access LLC to shut down the Dakota Access Pipeline and empty it of\noil by August 5, 2020, the injunction be stayed. The district court did not make the\nfindings necessary for injunctive relief. See Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms, 561\nU.S. 139, 158 (2010) (explaining that, before issuing an injunction in a National\nEnvironmental Policy Act case, “a court must determine that an injunction should issue\nunder the traditional four-factor test”).

At this juncture, appellants have\nfailed to make a strong showing of likely success on their claims that the district court\nerred in directing the Corps to prepare an environmental impact statement, see Nat’l\nParks Conservation Ass'n v. Semonite, 916 F.3d 1075, 1087 (D.C. Cir.), amended on\nrehearing, 925 F.3d 500 (D.C.

We expect appellants to clarify their positions before the\ndistrict court as to whether the Corps intends to allow the continued operation of the\npipeline notwithstanding vacatur of the easement and for the district court to consider\nadditional relief if necessary. It is\n \nFURTHER ORDERED that the motions for leave to participate as amicus be\ndenied without prejudice. The court will entertain motions to participate as amicus that\nare accompanied by merits briefs. It is \nFURTHER ORDERED, on the court’s own motion, that these consolidated cases\nbe expedited.

Pursuant to Fed R. Civ. P. 15(d), Intervenor-Plaintiff Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe \n(“Tribe”) hereby supplements its Second Amended Complaint in the above-captioned case. \n2.  This Supplemental Complaint sets out the claims the Tribe now brings forth against \nthe Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”) and Dakota Access, LLC (“Dakota Access”) following \nthis Court’s Order dated June 14, 2017 granting in part and denying in part the Tribe’s Motion for \nPartial Summary Judgement.  ECF 238.  In that Order, this Court held the Corps’ granting of \n1 \n \nEXHIBIT A\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 378-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 2 of 13\npermits to Dakota Access to construct an oil pipeline under Lake Oahe to be unlawful and \nremanded for additional consideration on specific issues. \n3.  The Court further ordered the Corps to give “serious consideration” to the errors \nidentified in the Corps’ decision, warning that compliance with the law “cannot be reduced to a \nbureaucratic formality, and that the Court expects the Corps not to treat remand as an exercise in \nfilling out the proper paperwork post hoc.”  ECF 284 at p. 28. \n4.  The Corps’ Remand Analysis unlawfully affirms the Corps’ pre-remand decision \nauthorizing the Dakota Access Pipeline (“DAPL”) without an environmental impact statement \n(“EIS”) as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). \n5.  Rather than conduct a comprehensive analysis of available data, including data \ndisfavorable to Dakota Access, the Corps merely relied upon the same data used in its pre-remand \nanalysis to conclude that DAPL would not result in significant harm to the environment, the Tribe, \nor the hunting and fishing rights reserved by the Tribe in its Treaties. \n6.  The Corps’ decision to authorize DAPL without a NEPA-required EIS is a final \nagency action that is reviewable by this Court under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”). \n7.  The Corps’ decision not to require an EIS is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, and not in accordance with law, and therefore violates the APA. \n8.  The Tribe seeks a declaration that the Corps’ affirmation of its pre-remand decision \nto authorize DAPL without an EIS (as required by NEPA), and without an adequate tribal \nconsultation violates the APA, NEPA, and the Tribe’s Treaty rights. \n9.  The Tribe asks this Court to vacate the permits issued to Dakota Access by the \nCorps pending the Corps’ compliance with the APA and NEPA. \n   \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 378-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 3 of 13\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n10.  The Tribe’s Supplemental Complaint is brought pursuant to the APA, which \nauthorizes a federal court to find unlawful and set aside any final agency action that is arbitrary, \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.  5 U.S.C. § 706. \n11.  Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question \njurisdiction), 28 U.S.C. § 1362 (Indian tribe as a plaintiff), 28 U.S.C. § 2201 (declaratory relief), \nand 28 U.S.C. § 2202 (injunctive relief). \n12.  Venue in this district is appropriate pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because this is \nthe district where the Defendant resides and in which a substantial part of the events or omissions \ngiving rise to the claim occurred.  No party has contested jurisdiction or venue during this \nlitigation. \nPARTIES \n13.  The  Tribe  is  a  federally-recognized  Indian  tribe  whose  ancestors,  since  time \nimmemorial, lived on the land that DAPL crosses.  DAPL crosses the Tribe’s sacred waters which \nhold cultural, religious, and economic significance to the Tribe and its members.  DAPL also \ncrosses areas of great historical, cultural, and religious significance to the Tribe.  The damage \nDAPL causes to the Tribe in these areas is substantial and irreparable.  This harm is the direct \nresult of the Corps’ failure to abide by the APA, NEPA, and the Tribe’s Treaties. \n14.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is an agency of the United States federal \ngovernment.  Among the Corps’ duties is fulfilling the United States’ trust responsibility to the \nTribe and other federally-recognized tribes, complying with the APA, and complying with NEPA \nwhen  undertaking  major  federal  actions  that  significantly  affect  the  quality  of  the  human \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 378-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 4 of 13\nenvironment.  Issuing permits for the continued construction and operation of DAPL is a major \nfederal action that significantly affects the quality of the human environment. \n15.  Intervenor-Defendant Dakota Access, LLC is a limited liability company formed \nto construct and own DAPL. \n16.  By filing this action, the Tribe does not waive its sovereign immunity and does not \nconsent to suit as to any claims, demand, offset, or cause of action of the United States, its agencies, \nofficers, agents, or other persons or entities in this or any other court. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n17.  The Corps issued an initial set of permits on July 25, 2016 to construct DAPL at \nLake Oahe.   \n18.  The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe (“SRST”) filed its initial complaint two days later \non July 27, 2018 raising several statutory and common law claims against the Corps. \n19.  Shortly thereafter, this Court granted motions by Dakota Access to intervene as \ndefendant and the Tribe to intervene as plaintiff. \n20.  On  September  9,  2016,  this  Court  denied  SRST’s  motion  for  a  preliminary \ninjunction pursuant to the National Historic Preservation Act.  On that same day, multiple federal \nagencies affirmed that the tribes had raised serious concerns that necessitated a closer look at the \nCorps’ permits at Lake Oahe and the underlying environmental analyses of these permits.  The \nCorps affirmed that the remaining authorization needed to construct the pipeline under Lake \nOahe—an easement to cross federally-owned land at Lake Oahe issued under the Mineral Leasing \nAct (“MLA”)—would not be issued at that time. \n21.  On December 4, 2016, the Corps announced that the MLA easement would not be \ngranted without a comprehensive analysis of alternatives and impacts, including an analysis of the \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 378-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 5 of 13\nTribe’s Treaty rights.  The Corps then formally initiated that process by publishing a Notice of \nIntent  to prepare an EIS and the Corps requested public comments on the critical issues and scope \nof the EIS. \n22.  On January 24, 2017, the newly-inaugurated President executed a “Presidential \nMemorandum” directing the Corps to abandon its December 4, 2016 decision to initiate the EIS \nprocess.  The Corps then changed course, terminated the EIS process, issued the MLA easement \nat  Lake  Oahe,  and  allowed  construction  of  DAPL  to  begin  immediately  without  further \nenvironmental review. \n23.  The Tribe moved this Court for partial summary judgment on its APA, NEPA, and \nTreaty claims against the Corps.  The Corps and Dakota Access cross-moved for summary \njudgment. \n24.  This Court ruled on June 14, 2017 that the Corps’ failure to adequately analyze the \nimpacts of an oil spill on the Tribe’s Treaty rights to hunt and fish on the land, in Lake Oahe, and \nin the Missouri River violated the requirements of NEPA.  Additionally, this Court held that the \nCorps did not adequately consider issues of environmental justice as required by federal law.  \nFinally, this Court held that the Corps failed to address issues of significant scientific controversy \nregarding the risk of an oil spill and the potential impacts therefrom. \n25.  This Court remanded the Corps’ analysis back to the Corps and ordered the Corps \nto correct its errors in the initial analysis.  The Court ordered that the Corps must complete oil spill \nresponse plans, that a third-party audit of the project must be completed, and that public reporting \nof the project must occur. \n26.  During the time when the Corps was ordered to conduct its Remand Analysis, the \nbeneficial owners of Dakota Access, LLC publicly announced their intention to expand the \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 378-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 6 of 13\ncapacity of DAPL by 100,000 barrels of crude oil per day.  On information and belief, this \nexpansion could take place without additional Corps’ authorization at the Lake Oahe crossing.  \nSuch a significant increase in crude oil flow would make the Corps’ spill risk and impact analysis \nand emergency response planning useless as these analyses would be based on, at best, inaccurate \ndata, and at worst, false data. \n27.  The Corps completed its Remand Analysis on August 31, 2018 and concluded that \nit did not need to reconsider its 2016 environmental assessment nor was it required to complete an \nEIS.  The Corps affirmed its pre-remand conclusion that the risk of an oil spill is low, and therefore, \n“. . . any impacts on hunting and fishing resource [sic] will be of limited scope and duration.”  ECF \n362-1 at p. 1.  Additionally, the Corps concluded that the Lake Oahe crossing “does not result in \ndisproportionately  high  and  adverse  human  health  or  environmental  effects  on  minority \npopulations, including Tribes, and low-income populations.”  Id.  Finally, as to whether the Corps’ \nconclusions were likely to be highly controversial, the Corps incorrectly characterized technical \ninput and data from interested stakeholders as mere opposition to the pipeline and stated that these \nstakeholders did not “provide information that a substantial dispute exists as to the size, nature, or \neffect of the federal action.”  Id. at p. 2. \n28.  The Corps’ Remand Analysis ignores much of the information provided to the \nCorps during the remand period by interested stakeholders, it does not provide a critical response \nto these data, and it simply reiterates the Corps’ flawed pre-remand conclusions.  The Remand \nAnalysis continues to calculate risk based on generic national statistics rather than accounting for \nDAPL’s specific risk factors particular to its specific route.  The Remand Analysis fails to address \nthe extensive evidence that the risks of slow pipeline leaks that cannot be detected is higher than \nthe Corps acknowledges.  The Remand Analysis relies heavily upon an ill-founded worst case \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 378-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 7 of 13\ndischarge (“WCD”) analysis that grossly underestimates the impacts of an oil spill, does not \nadequately account for the unique hazards of Bakken crude oil, and severely overestimates the \nability of responders to clean up oil after it has spilled. \n29.  The Remand Analysis fails to address adverse weather conditions and the impact \nof circumstances listed in the regulatory definition of “worst case discharge” in 49 C.F.R. § 194.5. \n30.  The Remand Analysis fails to implement the formula required by 49 C.F.R. § \n194.105(b)(1), including consideration of the operators’ historic discharges. \n31.  The Remand Analysis relies heavily upon unrealistic shutdown times that bear \nlittle-to-no resemblance to multiple real-world oil pipeline spills. \n32.  The Remand Analysis ignored DAPL’s failure to comply with easement conditions, \nincluding the requirement that shutoff valves near Lake Oahe have independent power sources to \nensure operational safety. \n33.  The Remand Analysis fails to calculate the risks and impacts of an oil spill based \nupon Dakota Access’s publicly-stated intention to increase DAPL’s capacity by 100,000 barrels \nof crude oil per day.  Such a drastic increase changes both the risks of a spill as well as the potential \nimpacts of a spill.  By not accounting for this volume of crude oil flow through the pipeline, the \nWCD analysis is rendered useless and constitutes little more than the Corps merely checking an \nadministrative box to proceed with its pre-determined decision. \n34.  The failures in the Remand Analysis endanger the Tribe’s hunting and fishing \nTreaty rights, disproportionately endanger low-income and Tribal residents along the pipeline \nroute, and do not adequately address the controversy over the Corps’ conclusions that the risk of \noil spill is low and the effects therefrom are minimal. \n   \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 378-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 8 of 13\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nI.  VIOLATION OF NEPA \n35.  Intervenor-Plaintiff  hereby  alleges,  incorporates,  and  restates  all  previous \nparagraphs of this Supplemental Complaint and of Intervenor-Plaintiff’s prior Second Amended \nComplaint. \n36.  Federal agencies are required under NEPA to prepare an EIS for all “major Federal \nactions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.”  42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C). \n37.  In determining whether any federal action is significant, Council of Environmental \nQuality (“CEQ”) regulations require consideration of both the context of the action and the \nintensity of its impacts.  40 C.F.R. § 1508.27. \n38.  Factors to be considered when determining the intensity of an action include “the \ndegree to which the proposed action affects public health or safety”; “unique characteristics of the \ngeographic area such as proximity to historic or cultural resources…”; the degree to which the \neffects on the environment “are likely to be highly controversial,” are “highly uncertain” or \n“involve unique or unknown risks”; and “the degree to which the action … may cause loss or \ndestruction of significant scientific, cultural, or historical resources.”  Id.  \n39.  In June of 2017, this Court found significant flaws in the Corps’ analysis of the risk \nand the impacts of its decision to authorize DAPL beneath Lake Oahe.  The three flaws identified \nby the Court failed to adequately consider effects to the Tribe’s Treaty rights to hunt and fish, \nfailed to adequately consider the environmental justice effects of DAPL on low-income and tribal \ncommunities, and failed to consider the controversy of the Corps’ spill and impact analysis. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 378-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 9 of 13\n40.  The  Corps’  decision  to  affirm  its  pre-remand  analysis  without  adequately \nconsidering the Tribe’s Treaty rights, environmental justice implications, or controversy of DAPL \nviolated NEPA’s requirement to take a hard look at the action. \nII.  VIOLATION OF THE APA \n41.  Intervenor-Plaintiff  hereby  alleges,  incorporates,  and  restates  all  previous \nparagraphs of this Supplemental Complaint and of Intervenor-Plaintiff’s prior Second Amended \nComplaint. \n42.  The APA requires a reviewing court to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \nfindings, and conclusions found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise \nnot in accordance with law . . . .”  5 U.S.C. § 706. \n43.  The Corps’ Remand Analysis largely affirms its pre-remand analysis of the risk of \noil spills and the effects of those spills on Tribal members and the Treaty rights secured to these \nmembers and to the Tribe. \n44.  This Court found the Corps’ pre-remand analysis to be deficient with regard to \nTreaty rights to hunt and fish, with regards to environmental justice concerns, and with regard to \nthe controversy surrounding DAPL. \n45.  The Corps’ Remand Analysis fails to provide a WCD analysis that complies with \nthe requirements of 49 C.F.R. § 194.5 because the Corps relies on its pre-remand WCD that does \nnot account for the impact of circumstances such as adverse weather conditions and other factors \nlisted in 49 C.F.R. § 194.5. \n46.  The Corps’ Remand Analysis fails to comply with the requirements of 49 C.F.R. § \n194.105(b)(1), including the requirement to consider the historic discharges from DAPL’s pipeline \noperators, even though DAPL’s parent companies have among the industry’s worst safety records. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 378-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 10 of 13\n47.  The  Corps’  Remand  Analysis  fails  even  to  consider  Dakota  Access’s  public \nstatement that it intends to increase the flow of crude oil through DAPL by 100,000 barrels per \nday. \n48.  Given the Corps’ failure to abide by CEQ regulations in its Remand Analysis, and \nits failure to consider the increased crude oil flow through DAPL, the Corps’ decision to reaffirm \nits pre-remand analysis is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with \nthe law. \nIII.  FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY CONSIDER IMPACTS TO TREATY RIGHTS \n49.  Intervenor-Plaintiff  hereby  alleges,  incorporates,  and  restates  all  previous \nparagraphs of this Supplemental Complaint and of Intervenor-Plaintiff’s prior Second Amended \nComplaint. \n50.  The Tribe holds vested Treaty rights in the lands within the Cheyenne River Sioux \nReservation, the waters of Lake Oahe, and the Missouri River.  These rights include reserved water \nrights and Treaty rights to hunt, fish, and gather natural resources from the lands within the \nCheyenne River Sioux Reservation, including the waters of Lake Oahe and the Missouri River.  \nThese rights include the right to clean, safe water to sustain a livable permanent homeland and \nself-sufficiency for the Tribe and its people.  The Corps manages and controls the waters of Lake \nOahe where the Tribe exercises its treaty rights. \n51.  The  Corps,  by  virtue  of  the  Treaties,  federal  statutes,  and  the  federal  trust \nresponsibility, has a duty to consider the Tribe’s treaty rights when taking action.  The Corps also \nhas a duty to avoid taking actions that would damage, degrade, or destroy the Tribe’s reserved \nwater rights and the Tribe’s Treaty rights to hunt, fish, and gather.  The Corps must fully assess, \nin consultation with the Tribe, the impacts of its actions such as authorizing, permitting, or granting \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 378-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 11 of 13\neasements for pipelines to cross areas where the Tribe retains rights guaranteed to the Tribe and \nits members by Treaties. \n52.  The Corps’ Remand Analysis renews its pre-remand assertion that the likelihood \nof an oil spill is minimal, and concludes therefrom that the effects and impacts of an oil spill on \nthe Tribe’s hunting and fishing rights are minimal.  This conclusion relies upon a narrow selection \nof data used to confirm the Corps’ pre-remand decision, and fails to analyze data critical of the \nCorps’ pre-remand decision.  This conclusion excludes much of the feedback provided by the \nTribe, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, and other Tribal parties to this action in violation of the \nCorps’ obligation to consult with the Tribes before taking action that could jeopardize the Tribes’ \ntreaty rights and resources. \n53.  By reaffirming its pre-remand decisions, the Corps’ Remand Analysis failed to \nadequately consider the Tribe’s Treaty rights and failed to consider the Corps’ duty to act as trustee \nto protect those rights. \nIV.  VIOLATION OF THE RIVERS AND HARBORS ACT \n54.  Intervenor-Plaintiff  hereby  alleges,  incorporates,  and  restates  all  previous \nparagraphs of this Supplemental Complaint. \n55.  Section 408(a) of the Rivers and Harbors Act prohibits the alteration, occupation, \nor use of public works if such activity will be “injurious to the public interest.”  In determining if \nthe activity will be injurious to the public interest, the Corps must consider the benefits that \nreasonably may be expected to accrue from the activity against the reasonably foreseeable \ndetriments. \n56.  The Corps is required to consider the effects on the Tribe’s hunting and fishing \nrights in its determination of whether DAPL will be injurious to the public interest. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 378-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 12 of 13\n57.  This Court found the Corps’ pre-remand analysis to be deficient with regards to \nTreaty rights to hunt and fish. \n58.  The Corps’ Remand Analysis does not take into account Dakota Access’s intention \nto expand the capacity of DAPL by 100,000 barrels of crude oil per day. \n59.  The Corps’ Remand Analysis does not provide an adequate analysis of how the \nCorps weighed the risks of DAPL to the Tribe’s Treaty rights against the reasonably anticipated \nbenefits of DAPL.  The Remand Analysis fails to even consider Dakota Access’s public statement \nthat it intends to increase the flow of crude oil through DAPL by 100,000 barrels per day. \n60.  By failing to provide an adequate analysis of how the Corps weighed the risks and \nbenefits of DAPL, the Corps violated its duty under Section 408 of the Rivers and Harbors Act to \nensure that any alteration to a public works project is not injurious to the public interest. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE,  Intervenor-Plaintiff  respectfully  requests  that  this  Court  grant  the \nfollowing relief: \ni.  Declare  that  the  Remand  Analysis  and  the  underlying  MLA \neasement which it attempted to address is arbitrary, capricious, and in violation of \nNEPA and the APA; \nii.  Vacate the Remand Analysis, the final environmental analysis and \nfinding of no significant impact, and the underlying MLA easement pending full \ncompliance with the law; \niii.  Direct the Corps to resume the EIS process initiated in November \n2016, and provide the Tribe with all technical documents related to oil spill and \nimpact so that it can meaningfully participate in the EIS process; \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 378-1   Filed 11/26/18   Page 13 of 13\niv.  Retain jurisdiction over this matter to ensure that the Corps complies \nwith the law; \nv.  Award Intervenor-Plaintiff its reasonable fees, costs, expenses, and \ndisbursements, including attorneys’ fees, associated with this litigation; and \nvi.  Grant Intervenor-Plaintiff such further and additional relief as the \nCourt may deem just and proper. \n \nDated this 26th day of November, 2018. \n \nCHEYENNE RIVER SIOUX TRIBE, \n              Intervenor-Plaintiff, \n \n \n             By:    /s/ Nicole E.

Failure to properly analyze the impacts of the DAPL on Plaintiffs’ treaty rights \nand their communities violates NEPA and Executive Order 12898 and only \nvacatur will ensure that a proper environmental justice analysis is completed. ... 14 \nC.  Vacatur is proper because the Trump Administration’s disregard for treaty rights \nand tribal sovereignty erodes the laws and policies that Congress and the \nexecutive branch have carefully constructed Since 1962, in support of tribal self-\ndetermination. ....................................................................................................... 19 \nCONCLUSION ............................................................................................................................. 23 \nAPPENDIX: .................................................................................................................................

Congress passed NEPA \n50 years ago to ensure federal agencies “look before they leap” into approving a project with \npossible consequences for the human environment.  As members of Congress who wish to \npreserve the integrity of this historic act, amici are concerned with the Trump administration’s \nefforts to roll back NEPA’s strict procedural requirements through executive orders and by \nforging ahead with projects (including the Dakota Access Pipeline) without first taking the \nnecessary “hard look” at the consequences of the proposed action in full view of the public.  In \nthis case, amici are particularly concerned that allowing the Lake Oahe easement to remain in \nplace on remand will embolden federal agencies (and applicants) to avoid NEPA’s procedural \nrequirements by strategically using the judiciary’s equitable powers to act first and justify their \ndecision afterwards.  Amici’s concerns are especially acute here because this Court has already \nforgiven the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ transgressions once without vacating the Lake Oahe \neasement.  If the Court again allows the Army Corps to act first and comply later while leaving \nits three-year-old easement decision in place (for an indeterminate time), amici fear the precedent \nwill cause incalculable harm to NEPA and the values Congress intended the statute to protect.  \nAmici are similarly concerned that the Army Corps’ failures to adequately analyze Plaintiffs’ \nenvironmental justice concerns and treaty rights during its NEPA process, as well as the full \n \n1 No person or entity other than amici and their counsel assisted in or made a monetary \ncontribution to the preparation or submission of this brief. \n  1 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 531   Filed 05/20/20   Page 8 of 34\n \nimpacts of the pipeline on its communities and treaty rights, will impair Plaintiffs’ sovereignty \nand self-determination.   \nINTRODUCTION \n  The undersigned members of Congress offer this brief in support of Plaintiffs’ request for \nthis Court to vacate the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ (Army Corps) Lake Oahe easement for \nthe Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL).  The Lake Oahe easement should never have been \napproved without the Army Corps first fully complying with the National Environmental Policy \nAct (NEPA).  But it was approved, and the pipeline became fully operational on June 1, 2017.  \nWithin two weeks, this Court held that Army Corps’ easement decision violated NEPA, though it \nlater decided to leave the easement in place on remand.  Almost three years later, this Court \nagain held that the Army Corps’ decision to grant the easement violated NEPA.  The question \nnow is whether the Court should, for a second time, allow the Corps’ unlawfully granted \neasement to remain in place while the Corps (again) is asked to comply with the law.  With \nrespect, it should not. \nNEPA requires federal agencies to “look before they leap.”  The statute accomplishes this \ngoal by establishing strict procedural requirements that agencies must comply with before acting.  \nThis charge, however, is only as strong as the judiciary’s willingness to vacate agency actions \nmade in violation of the statute’s strict procedural requirements.  If agencies can violate NEPA \ntwice without significant consequences (including vacatur), the statute will be rendered \nmeaningless and the values Congress sought to protect will suffer.   \nThese values include protecting Plaintiffs’ treaty rights in the Missouri River, Lake Oahe, \nand the surrounding off-reservation lands.  The Army Corps’ failure to comply with NEPA has \nthreatened the Plaintiffs’ treaty rights and undermined the decades-long efforts of the \n  2 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 531   Filed 05/20/20   Page 9 of 34\n \nundersigned members, and previous Congress’s attempts to reverse the nation’s destructive past \npractice of diminishing tribal sovereignty, breaking treaties with indigenous nations, and \nundermining tribal self-determination.  By allowing the pipeline to continue operating without \nfirst complying with NEPA, the momentary interests of a non-native corporation will be elevated \nabove the long-term interests of the tribes — protected environmental justice communities — in \nthe sanctity of the resources they rely on and that are protected by treaty. \nIn order to protect NEPA’s integrity and ensure the Army Corps takes seriously the issues \nraised by Plaintiffs in the primary pleadings and briefs, as well as to protect the Plaintiffs’ treaty \nrights, we respectfully ask this Court to vacate the Lake Oahe easement pending the Corps’ \ncompletion of an adequate environmental impact statement (EIS).   \nI.  This Court Should Vacate The Lake Oahe Easement During The Second Remand \nTo Protect The Integrity Of NEPA. \nWhen Congress passed NEPA 50 years ago, it recognized the “critical importance” of the \nenvironment to our nation and declared the “federal government’s responsibility to preserve \nimportant historic, cultural, and natural aspects of our national heritage.”  42 U.S.C. § 4331; see \nalso Oglala Sioux Tribe v. NRC, 896 F.3d 520, 529 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (recognizing that “the \nenvironmental values protected by NEPA are of a high order.”).  The statute seeks to protect \nthese important values by instructing federal agencies to prepare an EIS before taking any major \nactions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.  Oglala Sioux Tribe, 896 \nF.3d at 523.  By completing an EIS before approving a proposed action, NEPA “ensures that the \nagency, in reaching its decision, will have available, and will carefully consider, detailed \ninformation concerning significant environmental impacts.”  Robertson v. Methow Valley \nCitizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 349 (1989).  It also “guarantees that the relevant information will \nbe made available to the larger audience that may also play a role in both the decisionmaking \n  3 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 531   Filed 05/20/20   Page 10 of 34\n \nprocess and the implementation of that decision.”  Id.  Otherwise, NEPA’s procedural \nrequirements become a paper tiger—exactly what Congress did not intend.  Calvert Cliffs’ \nCoordinating Comm., Inc. v. U.S. Atomic Energy Comm’n, 499 F.2d 1109, 1114 (D.C. Cir. \n1971).  \nNothing in the statute’s text authorizes agency actions to continue in force when taken in \nviolation of NEPA.  Without a textual basis in the statute for allowing actions (like the Lake \nOahe easement) to remain in force pending NEPA compliance, agencies have turned to the \njudiciary’s equitable powers to avoid vacatur.  Under the framework for vacatur established by \nthe D.C. Circuit, “[t]he decision whether to vacate depends on the seriousness of the order’s \ndeficiencies (and thus the extent of doubt whether the agency chose correctly) and the disruptive \nconsequences of an interim change that may itself be changed.”  Allied-Signal v. NRC, 988 F.2d \n146, 151 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (internal quotations omitted).  Vacatur is the default remedy in cases \nwhere the plaintiffs have demonstrated an APA violation and the burden is on the defendants to \n“prove that vacatur is not necessary.”  Nat'l Parks Conservation Ass'n v. Semonite, 422 F. Supp. \n3d 92, 99 (D.D.C. 2019).  When analyzing the appropriateness of this remedy, this Court has \nruled that the Allied Signal factors are not dispositive and that vacatur is appropriate based on a \ncourt’s assessment of the “overall equities and practicality of the alternatives.”  Id. at 99; see \nWood v. Burwell, 837 F.3d 969, 976 (9th Cir. 2016) (noting that remand without vacatur is \nremedy that should be “used sparingly.”).  Forgiving NEPA violations by remanding uninformed \nagency decisions without vacatur (or the functional equivalent) means “there will be nothing left \nto the protections that Congress intended [NEPA] to provide.”  Oglala Sioux Tribe, 896 F.3d at \n534.  If the judiciary is going to strip the statute of these protections on equitable grounds, it \nshould do so only in the rarest circumstances, which are not present here.  \n  4 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 531   Filed 05/20/20   Page 11 of 34\n \nA.  Leaving the Lake Oahe easement in place will encourage the Corps (and \nother agencies) to act first and comply with NEPA later. \nMore than two years ago, this Court held that remand without vacatur was an appropriate \nremedy for the Army Corps’ NEPA violations.  The Court was satisfied the first Allied-Signal \nfactor had been met having found there was a “serious possibility” that the Corps “[would] be \nable to substantiate the prior [environmental assessment].”  Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. \nArmy Corps of Eng’rs, 282 F. Supp. 3d 91, 99 (D.D.C. 2017) (“Standing Rock IV”).  But in \nhindsight, the Court’s faith in the Corps was undeserved — the Army Corps was unable to \nsubstantiate its decision to forego an EIS because there were  “serious gaps in crucial parts of the \nCorps’ analysis” of pipeline safety issues and the Corps was “not able to fill any of them.”  \nStanding Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 2020 WL 1441923 *16 (D.D.C. Mar. \n25, 2020) (“Standing Rock V”) (emphasis added).  These gaps tainted the Corps’ evaluation of \ncritical issues including: (1) DAPL’s leak detection system; (2) how quickly that system can \ncatch spills; (3) the impact of “harsh North Dakota winters on spill response efforts”; (4) the \noperator’s safety record; (5) potential human or machine error; and (6) the Corps’ related \nevaluation of potential worse case discharges from the pipeline.  Id. at *9–16.  Thus, oil has \ncontinued to flow for almost three years through an unlawfully approved pipeline despite \nCongress’s “manifest concern with preventing uninformed action.”  Marsh v. Oregon Nat. Res. \nCouncil, 490 U.S. 360, 371 (1989).  Given this history, the Court should not put its faith in the \nCorps again.   \n  The Corps’ failure to comply with NEPA on the first remand is not surprising.  Courts \nhave warned against bureaucratic momentum upending NEPA for decades.  In 1983, then Judge \nBreyer described the problem in Massachusetts v. Watt, 716 F.2d 946 (1st Cir. 1983).  He wrote \nthat “once large bureaucracies are committed to a course of action, it is difficult to change that \n  5 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 531   Filed 05/20/20   Page 12 of 34\n \ncourse—even if new, or more thorough, NEPA statements are prepared and the agency is told to \n‘redecide.’”  Id. at 952–53.  But bureaucratic momentum is only part of the story here.  The \nCorps is also facing pressure from the President who on his fourth day in office instructed the \nSecretary of the Army to “review and approve [the Dakota Access pipeline] in an expedited \nmanner . . . .”  82 Fed. Reg. 8661 (Jan. 24, 2017) (emphasis added).  With the White House and \nthe Army Corps having already committed to approving the Lake Oahe easement, there is little \nincentive for the Army Corps to approach its earlier decision with an open mind and the rigor \ndemanded by NEPA’s procedural requirements.  The Corps’ actions during remand suggest it is \nmore concerned with keeping the oil flowing and merely checking the box on NEPA.  See, e.g., \nStanding Rock V, 2020 WL 1441923 *10 (finding that the pipeline operator’s history “did not \ninspire confidence” yet on remand the Corps “focused its response on defending the operator’s \nperformance record”).  This is precisely the kind of executive branch momentum and uninformed \nagency action that NEPA was meant to protect against and that has led courts to halt projects \nauthorized in violation of NEPA.  See, e.g., Montana Wilderness Ass’n v. Fry, 408 F. Supp. 2d \n1032, 1037–38 (D. Mont. 2006) (enjoining an operational natural gas pipeline); Marsh, 490 U.S. \nat 371. \nWhen the judiciary permits uninformed agency actions to remain in effect on remand, it \nundermines Congress’s command in NEPA that agencies “look before they leap.”  Standing \nRock IV, 282 F. Supp. 3d at 106.  Allowing (or indeed encouraging) agencies to justify their \nactions in the face of NEPA violations a second time creates “undesirable incentives for future \nagency actions” similar to those this Court recognized in its first decision on vacatur.  Id.  Just as \n“agencies and third parties may choose to devote as many resources as early as possible to a \nchallenged project—and then claim disruption in light of such investments” so too may they \n  6 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 531   Filed 05/20/20   Page 13 of 34\n \nchoose to approve projects without the rigor NEPA demands if courts are unwilling vacate that \napproval.  Id.  Strategic maneuverings like these are “contrary to the purpose of NEPA, which \nseeks to ensure that the government looks before it leaps,” id., and allows for meaningful public \ninvolvement in the decisionmaking process, especially by those members of the public likely to \nbe impacted.  Robertson, 490 U.S. at 349.   \nThe D.C. Circuit recently admonished another agency for “disparaging” NEPA violation \nas “merely procedural” and leaving a federal license in place while the agency sought to cure it.  \nSee Oglala Sioux Tribe, 896 F.3d at 534 (internal quotations omitted).  But agencies are left to \nbelieve NEPA’s requirements are “merely procedural” when their actions remain undisturbed \ndespite repeated violations.  If the Court does not vacate the Lake Oahe easement, it is \nunreasonable to believe that the Corps will fully and fairly evaluate the environmental impacts of \noperating the DAPL under Lake Oahe and seriously consider reasonable alternatives.  \nRemanding without vacatur again would further signal to the Corps and other agencies that \nacting first and complying with NEPA later is a strategy worth taking.   \nB.  There is no decision left for the Corps to justify under the first Allied-Signal \nfactor. \nVacatur is warranted under the first Allied-Signal factor because there is no NEPA \ndecision left for the Corps to justify.  This court has previously held that “[o]n remand, the Corps \ncannot substantiate its initial procedural decision to forego an EIS, as the [court] has already \nfound that such a decision would violate NEPA.”  Semonite, 422 F. Supp. 3d at 99.  The Corps \nmust instead produce an EIS.   \nEven if there were a NEPA decision left to substantiate, asking whether the Army Corps \ncan justify its decision to grant the Lake Oahe easement a second time is squarely at odds with \n“the EIS requirement [that] inhibits post hoc rationalizations of inadequate environmental \n  7 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 531   Filed 05/20/20   Page 14 of 34\n \ndecisionmaking.”  Friends of the River v. Fed. Energy Reg. Comm’n, 720 F.2d 93, 106 (D.C. Cir. \n1983); see also Metcalf v. Daley, 214 F.3d 1135, 1142 (9th Cir. 2000) (noting that “[p]roper \ntiming is one of NEPA’s central themes.  An assessment must be ‘prepared early enough so that \nit can serve practically as an important contribution to the decisionmaking process and will not \nbe used to rationalize or justify decisions already made.’”) (quoting 40 C.F.R. § 1502.5).  Courts \nshould not remand without vacatur when doing so risks the very harm Congress sought to protect \nagainst in NEPA—uninformed agency action.  See Cal. Cmtys. Against Toxics v. Envtl. Prot. \nAgency, 688 F.3d 989, 994 (9th Cir. 2012) (remanding without vacatur where vacatur could \nincrease air pollution and undermine the Clean Air Act’s goals).   \nC.  Federal pipeline safety regulations offer no shelter for “serious gaps in \ncrucial parts” of the Army Corps’ flawed analysis.  \nThe existence of federal pipeline safety regulations does not render the Corps’ NEPA \nviolations any less serious.  The regulations are simply not very stringent.  For example, the \nDepartment of Transportation, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration’s \n(PHMSA) leak detection regulations merely require that an operator “have a means to detect \nleaks on its pipeline system.”  49 C.F.R. § 195.452(i)(3).  The regulations do not set any \nparticular standard that the leak detection system must meet.  It is merely up to the operator to \n“evaluate the capability of its leak detection means.”  Id.    \nCongress set out to improve pipeline safety regulations roughly 10 years ago after two \nmajor pipeline incidents.  The first incident involved a crude oil pipeline rupture near Marshall, \nMichigan, which spilled approximately 800,000 gallons of crude oil into the Kalamazoo River \ncausing $1 billion in damages.  The second incident involved a natural gas pipeline rupture in \nSan Bruno, California that killed 8 people, sent 51 people to the hospital, destroyed 38 homes, \ndamaged 70 other homes, and required 300 households to evacuate.  See Pipeline Safety: Valve \n  8 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 531   Filed 05/20/20   Page 15 of 34\n \nInstallation and Minimum Rupture Detection Standards, 85 Fed. Reg. 7162, 7163 (Feb. 6, 2020) \n(notice of proposed rulemaking).  Congress responded by passing the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory \nCertainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011.  125 Stat. 1904.  Section 4 of this statute requires \nPHMSA to issue regulations, if appropriate, requiring the use of automatic or remote-controlled \nshutoff valves, or equivalent technology to improve safety.  49 U.S.C. § 60102(n).  Yet nine \nyears after its passage, PHMSA has only recently given notice of a proposed rulemaking and \nsoliciting comments on its proposals.  85 Fed. Reg. 7162 (Feb. 6, 2020).  These rules, based on \nCongress’s 2011 statute, have not gone into effect. \nThe proposed rulemaking references significant shortcomings in PHMSA’s existing \nregulations that were identified by the Government Accountability Office.  Id. at 7166.  For \nexample, current safety regulations for incident response are too general, requiring merely that \noperators respond in a “prompt and effective manner.”  Id. at 7167.  Regulations requiring \noperators to install automatic shutoff valves and remote-controlled valves are similarly vague.  \nThese valves are required only “if the operator determines, through risk analysis, such valves are \nnecessary to protect [High Consequence Areas].”  Id. (citing 49 C.F.R. § 192.935(c)) (emphasis \nadded).  Thus, PHMSA’s pipeline safety regulations do not make the “serious gaps in crucial \nparts of the Corps’ analysis” relating to pipeline leaks and spills any less serious for purposes of \ncrafting an appropriate remedy on remand.  \nD.  The second Allied-Signal factor does not favor remand without vacatur. \nIn 2017, this Court held that the disruptive effect of remand “does not counsel strongly in \nfavor of remand without vacatur” and “tip[ped] only narrowly in favor of [the Corps].”  Standing \nRock IV, 282 F. Supp. 3d at 108.  Since 2017, the price and demand for oil has plummeted due to \nfactors well beyond the operation of this pipeline.  Those factors include international oil \n  9 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 531   Filed 05/20/20   Page 16 of 34\n \nproduction wars between Russia and Saudi Arabia and the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.  At one \npoint this year, U.S. oil prices fell to less than zero dollars per barrel.2  As of May 4, 2020, \neconomic conditions have resulted in 6,800 shut-in wells and a 450,000 barrels per day drop in \nproduction.3  Factoring into these difficulties is the fact that Bakken oil is among the costliest to \nproduce and must be transported longer distances to refineries when compared to other regions.4  \nAs in other producing regions of the U.S., oil producers in the Bakken region that ship oil \nthrough the DAPL are curtailing investment in new production, shutting in oil wells, and \ninvesting in storing oil rather than shipping it to refineries.5  The reality is that these economic \nconditions are likely to continue for some time.  For example, North Dakota state regulators are \nallowing companies to seek waivers so they can halt production from wells for longer than a year \nwithout deciding whether to permanently plug a well or start operating again.  Id.  Given the \nsignificantly reduced demand for Bakken oil, vacating the Lake Oahe easement during remand \nwould likely have fewer and less severe disruptive impacts on oil markets than in 2017. \n Without vacatur, the Tribes have borne the risk of the Corps’ unlawful decision to \napprove the Lake Oahe easement and will continue to bear those risks until the Corps prepares an \nadequate EIS and makes a fully informed decision about spill risks.  While the Tribes’ resources \nhave not yet been affected by a spill, it may be only a matter of time.

Inadequate NEPA Analysis Erodes Tribal Sovereignty And Tribal Self-\nDetermination and Potentially Violates Plaintiffs’ Treaty Rights, So Vacatur Is The \nOnly Appropriate Remedy In This Case. \nThe Court should view the Allied-Signal/Semonite framework through the lens of the \nsignificant sovereign rights of the Plaintiffs, which may be potentially lost if the Court does not \nvacate this easement issued by the Army Corps.  The seriousness of the Army Corps’ above-\nreferenced deficiencies cannot be overstated against the foundational backdrop of Plaintiffs’ \ntreaty rights.  Moreover, the Supreme Court has held that Congress is the only branch of \ngovernment with the power to abrogate, eliminate, or alter treaty rights, guaranteeing that if this \ndrastic outcome is to occur, it happens only after careful consideration by hundreds of members \nof Congress.   \nA.  Failure to vacate the easement may result in abrogation of Plaintiffs’ treaty \nrights without an act of Congress, which is impermissible under Minnesota v. \nMille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians. \nThe Allied-Signal decision, as interpreted by Semonite, instructs the court to evaluate “the \nseriousness” of an agency decision’s “deficiencies” in light of the “overall equities” involved.  \nSemonite, 422 F. Supp. 3d at 99 (citing Allied-Signal, 988 F.2d at 150–51).  When federal and \ntribal interests are in tension, the lens through which courts resolve that tension is different from \nthat involved in a federal-state conflict, or a conflict between a private individual and an agency.  \n \n6 Alleen Brown, Five Spills, Six Months in Operation: Dakota Access Track Record Highlights \nUnavoidable Reality–Pipelines Leak, THE INTERCEPT (Jan. 9, 2018), \nhttps://theintercept.com/2018/01/09/dakota-access-pipeline-leak-energy-transfer-partners/.  \n  11 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 531   Filed 05/20/20   Page 18 of 34\n \nSee New Mexico v. Mescalero Apache Tribe, 462 U.S. 324, 334 (1983) (noting “certain broad \nconsiderations” that guide the Court’s analysis of federal and tribal interests).  The Supreme \nCourt has held that courts should analyze statutory conflicts involving tribes using “traditional \nnotions of Indian sovereignty [as] a crucial ‘backdrop.’”  Id. (quoting White Mtn. Apache Tribe \nv. Bracker, 448 U.S. 136,143 (1980)).  Moreover, courts should analyze conflicts arising from \nfederal statutes in a way that respects the federal government’s commitment “to the goal of \npromoting tribal self-government, a goal embodied in numerous federal statutes.”  Id. at 335.  \nThe Supreme Court has “stressed that Congress' objective of furthering tribal self-government \nencompasses far more than encouraging tribal management of disputes between members, but \nincludes Congress’ overriding goal of encouraging ‘tribal self-sufficiency.’”  Id. (quoting \nBracker, 448 U.S. at 143).  \nAltering or abrogating treaty rights is a serious act that is not undertaken lightly, \nespecially in the modern era.  Herrera v. Wyoming, 139 S. Ct. 1686, 1698 (2019) (holding that \nCrow Treaty rights had not been abrogated by implication by Wyoming Enabling Act or act \ncreating Bighorn National Forest).  Moreover, the Supreme Court has long held that only an act \nof Congress can abrogate tribal treaty rights, and that the Executive branch lacks the authority to \nabrogate treaties unless it has been clearly delegated that authority by Congress.  Minnesota v. \nMille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians, 526 U.S. 172, 188 (1999) (holding that President Taylor’s \n1850 Executive Order could not terminate tribal hunting, fishing and gathering rights protected \nby 1837 Treaty).  For a congressional abrogation to occur, there must be clearly expressed intent \nto eliminate the treaty rights; or, in the words of the Supreme Court, “clear evidence that \nCongress actually considered the conflict between its intended action on the one hand and Indian \ntreaty rights on the other, and chose to resolve that conflict by abrogating the treaty.”  Herrera, \n  12 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 531   Filed 05/20/20   Page 19 of 34\n \n139 S. Ct. at 1698.  The strength of treaty rights cannot be overstated—they survive statehood \nacts, establishment of protected public lands by Congress, and they do not “expire” with time or \nby implication.  Id.  \nIt is also well settled that tribal treaty rights are to be construed in a manner that is most \nbeneficial to tribes, not the federal government.  Washington v. Wash. St. Comm. Passenger \nFishing Vessel Ass'n, 443 U.S. 658, 676 (1979), modified sub nom. Washington v. United States, \n444 U.S. 816 (1979) (noting that “treaty must therefore be construed, not according to the \ntechnical meaning of its words to learned lawyers, but in the sense in which they would naturally \nbe understood by the Indians”).  When governmental actions threaten treaty rights, the actions \nmust be paused, or vacated entirely, until the treaty rights can be fully defined, and in some \ncases, quantified.  Id. at 695 (holding that district court may assume “direct supervision of the \n[Columbia River] fisheries if state recalcitrance or state-law barriers should be continued.”).   \nSimilarly, courts must take precautions to ensure that treaties impacted by government agency \ndecisions are not violated, or worse yet, abrogated, without an express act of Congress.  See id. \nThe undersigned members have the utmost respect for tribal treaty rights as an essential \nfunction of tribal self-government and self-determination.  In the case of NEPA, it is the \nundersigned members’ view that NEPA requires an agency to thoroughly consider and respect \ntreaty rights as part of the NEPA “hard look” analysis and applying NEPA in any other manner \ndiminishes the respect for tribal sovereignty, tribal self-determination, and treaty rights that \nCongress and the Supreme Court have demonstrated since the beginning of the self-\ndetermination era.  The undersigned are of the view that NEPA in no way abrogates treaty rights, \nnor does it delegate the authority to the executive branch to abrogate or alter treaty rights.  \nAllowing the easement to stand, and a post hoc NEPA analysis to be conducted while oil flows \n  13 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 531   Filed 05/20/20   Page 20 of 34\n \nthrough the pipeline, risks violation and potential abrogation of the Plaintiffs’ treaty rights at the \nhands of a federal agency, which would contravene the Supreme Court’s rules from Mille Lacs \nand Fishing Vessel.  526 U.S. at 188; 443 U.S. at 676. \nWithout knowing the full scope and extent of Plaintiffs’ treaty rights in Lake Oahe and \nthe surrounding lands subject to the 1851 Treaty, neither the Army Corps, nor this Court, can be \nsure that they are adequately protected.  It is entirely possible that the pipeline is currently \ninterfering with Plaintiffs’ treaty rights in a way that only Plaintiffs truly understand, and it is \nimpossible for the Army Corps to fully and meaningfully evaluate those treaty rights, their \nexercise in the modern context, and potential alternatives, while the pipeline is in situ and \noperating.  The purpose and intent of NEPA is for agencies like the Army Corps to fully evaluate \nall facts and information about a proposed project before authorizing the project, and this \nanalysis necessarily includes treaty rights.  The doctrine of treaty abrogation holds that only \nCongress can abrogate or alter treaty rights, to ensure that this extreme consequence is not lightly \nor accidentally undertaken.  Mille Lacs, 526 U.S. at 188.  Only a complete evaluation of \nPlaintiffs’ treaty rights will ensure that they are not violated, abrogated, or altered, especially by \nimplication due to the Army Corps’ NEPA decision on the pipeline easement.  Those are the \noverall equities at stake in this case and remanding this matter to the agency for another bite at \nthe NEPA apple, without vacating the easement, risks ongoing and perhaps even further and \nmore permanent treaty violations.       \nB.  Failure to properly analyze the impacts of the DAPL on Plaintiffs’ treaty \nrights and their communities violates NEPA and Executive Order 12898 and \nonly vacatur will ensure that a proper environmental justice analysis is \ncompleted.  \nWhen conducting an environmental justice analysis, agencies must consider whether the \nprojects they approve will have a “‘disproportionately high and adverse’ impact on low-income \n  14 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 531   Filed 05/20/20   Page 21 of 34\n \nand predominantly minority communities.”  Sierra Club v. Fed. Energy Regulatory Comm'n, 867 \nF.3d 1357, 1368 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (quoting Exec. Order 12898, § 1-101, 59 Fed. Reg. 7629 (Feb. \n11, 1994) (requiring each federal agency to “make achieving environmental justice part of its \nmission by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse \nhuman health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority \npopulations and low-income populations in the United States.”); Communities Against Runway \nExpansion, Inc. v. FAA, 355 F.3d 678, 689 (D.C. Cir. 2004).  According to Executive Order \n12,898, as interpreted by the D.C. Circuit, agencies must include an environmental justice \nanalysis in their NEPA review and follow the guidance of the Council on Environmental Quality \n(CEQ) with respect to environmental justice analyses.  Sierra Club, 867 F.3d at 1368.    \nThe Clinton Executive Order also requires an agency engaged in a NEPA analysis “to \nconsider alternatives to avoid or minimize disproportionately high adverse impacts on minority \npopulations.”  Latin Americans for Soc. & Econ. Dev. v. Adm'r of Fed. Highway Admin., 756 \nF.3d 447, 476–77 (6th Cir. 2014).  In short, “NEPA requires . . . that the [agency] consider the \nenvironmental impacts of its projects in making its decisions.”  Id. at 477.  The purpose of \nconducting an environmental justice analysis “is to determine whether a project will have a \ndisproportionately adverse effect on minority and low income populations,” including “Indian \ntribe[s].”  Mid States Coal. for Progress v. Surface Transp. Bd., 345 F.3d 520, 541 (8th Cir. \n2003).  Moreover, CEQ guidance provides that “[w]here a potential environmental justice issue \nhas been identified by an agency, the agency should state clearly in the EIS . . . whether, in light \nof all of the facts and circumstances, a disproportionately high and adverse human health or \nenvironmental impact on minority populations, low-income populations, or Indian tribe is likely \nto result from the proposed action and any alternatives.”  Council on Environmental Quality, \n  15 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 531   Filed 05/20/20   Page 22 of 34\n \nEnvironmental Justice: Guidance under the National Environmental Policy Act 13 (Dec. 10, \n1997) (CEQ Guidance) (emphasis added).  Finally, CEQ guidance requires agencies to consider \nhow to consult environmental justice communities regarding the potential adverse impacts of a \nproposed project, and notes that, “Participation of low-income populations [and] minority \npopulations . . . may require adaptive or innovative approaches to overcome linguistic, \ninstitutional, cultural, economic, historical, or other potential barriers to effective participation \nin the decision-making processes of Federal agencies under customary NEPA procedures.”  Id. \n(emphasis added).  \nThe environmental justice communities squarely within the path of the pipeline and \nbearing the greatest risks of its leaks and malfunctions are those of the Plaintiff tribes.  A primary \nreason these communities are environmental justice communities today is the historical failures \nof the federal government, and particularly, the Executive branch, to honor legal obligations to \nthe Sioux in various treaties, starting with the Treaty of Fort Laramie, signed in 1851.  Indeed, \nnearly “‘the entire course of dealings between the United States and the Sioux is marked, on the \npart of the Federal Government, primarily by broken promises, by the rapacious acquisition of \nland, by the repeated sacrifice of Sioux rights to non-Indian interests, and by the oppression of \nSioux society.’”  Sioux Tribe of Indians v. United States, 14 Cl. Ct. 94, 96–97 (1987), aff'd, 862 \nF.2d 275 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (quoting Sioux Tribe of Indians v. United States, 7 Cl. Ct. 468, 470 \n(1985)). \nIn the 1851 Treaty with the Sioux, the U.S. government made a promise to “maintain \ngood faith and friendship” in all dealings, to ensure “an effective and lasting peace” with the \ntribes.  Treaty of Fort Laramie with Sioux, et al., Art. I, 11 Stat. 749 (1851).  Article V of the \nTreaty guaranteed the Sioux the lands along the western bank of the Missouri River in what are \n  16 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 531   Filed 05/20/20   Page 23 of 34\n \nnow the Standing Rock Sioux Nation and the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation, along with \nrights in the river itself.  Id. Art. V (describing rights extending “on the Missouri River” and \n“down the Missouri River.”).  In 1868,  a second treaty was signed, in an attempt to rectify the \nrights of non-Indian settlers and the federal government on Sioux lands, under pressure of \ncontinual white settlement on Sioux lands, but this treaty preserved the boundary of the 1851 \nTreaty with respect to the Missouri River and Sioux lands.  Treaty of April 29, 1868, 15 Stat. \n635.  In violation of the Treaty, the federal government permitted miners and other settlers to \ninvade the treaty lands, eventually securing to themselves the most culturally vital and sacred \nplace to the Sioux people – the Black Hills.  Sioux Tribe, 7 Cl. Ct. at 473-74.  Congress also \nallotted Sioux lands, unlawfully reducing the Great Sioux Nation into smaller reservations, and \nbuilt dams, including the one that created Lake Oahe, flooding Sioux bottomlands.  Id. at 472.  \nThere are significant legal questions about the scope of rights preserved in the 1851 Treaty, \nwhich are before this Court in this action.  Vacatur is the appropriate remedy in this case, to \nrequire the Army Corps to conduct a thorough analysis of the 1851 Treaty rights, and evaluate \nthe potential impacts of the DAPL, before making the decisions required by NEPA (such as \nwhether to draft an Environmental Impact Statement).    \nIn addition, vacatur is the appropriate remedy given that the Army Corps did not properly \nconsider the institutional barriers that arose as a result of the federal government’s continued \nbreaching of treaties with the Sioux and the theft of its lands, which are significant.  See CEQ \nGuidance (requiring agency to consider “institutional barriers” as part of environmental justice \nanalysis).  Had the federal government complied with the terms of the 1851 and 1868 treaties, \nthe Sioux would have primary jurisdiction and some regulatory authority over the waters of the \nMissouri River within Lake Oahe, subject to specific limitations involving non-members and fee \n  17 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 531   Filed 05/20/20   Page 24 of 34\n \nlands.  Montana v. United States, 450 U.S. 544, 564 (1981).  Their citizens would have direct \naccess to the tribal government to raise concerns about the pipeline and its potential cultural and \nenvironmental consequences, and they would be able to raise these issues pursuant to tribal law, \nnot federal law.  See id. (citing United States v. Wheeler, 435 U.S. 313, 323 (1978) (tribes are \n“unique aggregations possessing attributes of sovereignty over both their members and their \nterritory.”).  Yet, that is not the history or present situation of the Plaintiff tribes.  They were \nunlawfully divested of jurisdiction over their lands and waters, and Congress vested that \nauthority in the Army Corps of Engineers and other federal agencies, which were delegated \nauthority to design processes of accepting public comment on environmentally harmful projects \naccording to federal law.  Sioux Tribe of Indians, 7 Cl. Ct. at 474-75.  The system in which they \nare forced to assert their legal rights is not their own, and in many ways, is designed to exclude \nthem.  See Ex Parte Crow Dog, 109 U.S. 556, 571 (1883) (noting the historical challenges tribal \nmembers faced when federal laws were applied to them without their consent).  Vacatur of the \nDAPL easement would signal that the Army Corps’ lackluster attempts at rectifying the \ninstitutional barriers to Sioux participation in the NEPA process will not stand.  \nFinally, Executive Order 12898 and CEQ Guidance require agencies to adequately \nconsult environmental justice communities about the potential impacts of a project on their \ncommunities.  Sierra Club, 867 F.3d at 1368; CEQ Guidance.  Despite the affirmative \nconsultation requirement in the regulations, agencies are not required to adopt the proffered \nsuggestions of tribes, and consultation often works against, rather than for, tribal interests.  See \nMichael Eitner, Meaningful Consultation with Tribal Governments: A Uniform Standard to \nGuarantee That Federal Agencies Properly Consider Their Concerns, 85 U. Colo. L. Rev. 867, \n900 (2014).  Members of Congress, including some of the undersigned, have repeatedly \n  18 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 531   Filed 05/20/20   Page 25 of 34\n \nemphasized the institutional obstacles and other shortcomings that tribes face in navigating the \nparticipation and consultation processes of statutes like NEPA and the National Historic \nPreservation Act.  Eitner, 85 U. Colo. L. Rev. at 900 (quoting Letter from Lisa Murkowski, \nUnited States Senator from Alaska, to Barack Obama, 44th President of the United States, (June \n22, 2012) & Press Release: Grijalva Introduces Bill to Mandate Federal Consultation With \nNative American Tribes During Rulemaking Process, Congressman Grijalva, \nhttp://grijalva.house.gov/news-and-press-releases/grijalva-introduces-bill-to-mandate-federal-\nconsultation-with-native-american-tribes-during-rulemaking-process/ (last visited Mar. 20, 2014) \n(expressing concerns that “the current consultation process is inadequate and inefficient,”  that \n“consultation is currently a ‘one way road of communication dissemination instead of discussion \nand dialogue,” that Indian tribes cannot be “an afterthought in federal policymaking” and that \n“[c]onsultation and discussion are a necessity, not a favor to be granted one day and denied the \nnext.”).  Given that this Court has concluded that the Army Corps did not adequately consider \nthe Plaintiffs’ treaty rights in the lands and waters in the path of the pipeline, or the impacts of \nthe pipeline on those treaty rights and communities, vacatur of the easement and a thorough \nexamination and environmental justice analysis are the only result that ensures proper \ncompliance with the NEPA process.    \nC.  Vacatur is proper because the Trump Administration’s disregard for treaty \nrights and tribal sovereignty erodes the laws and policies that Congress and the \nexecutive branch have carefully constructed Since 1962, in support of tribal self-\ndetermination. \nIn addition to the “overall equities” mentioned previously, the Court should consider how \nthe Army Corps’ decision to proceed with an environmental assessment and not complete a full \nEIS, including an analysis of Plaintiffs’ treaty rights and the impacts of the pipeline and related \ninfrastructure on environmental justice communities, contravenes the current policy of the \n  19 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 531   Filed 05/20/20   Page 26 of 34\n \nfederal government towards sovereign indigenous nations and threatens to repeat tragic events of \nthe past.  The current policy of the United States with respect to sovereign tribal nations is one \nbased on a government-to-government relationship, in which the United States recognizes and \nrespects tribal sovereignty, tribal self-determination, and tribal treaty rights.  This policy began \nwith the election of President John F. Kennedy, who declared that, as of 1962, there would be \n“no change in treaty or contractual relationships without the consent of the tribes concerned.  No \nsteps . . .  taken to impair the cultural heritage of any group . . . and [there] would be protection \nfor the Indian land base.”  Goldberg, Carol E., et al, American Indian Law:  Native Nations and \nthe Federal System, p. 35 (7th ed. 2015).  In the 58 years since Kennedy’s promise, the Executive \nbranch and Congress have taken tremendous strides to respect and further the government-to-\ngovernment relationship envisioned by tribes and the Founders in the earliest treaties signed with \nIndian nations.  See Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968, 25 U.S.C. §§ 1301–1303; Indian Self-\nDetermination and Education Assistance Act of 1975, 25 U.S.C. § 450a; Indian Child Welfare \nAct of 1978, 25 U.S.C. §§ 1901–1903; American Indian Religious Freedom Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ \n1996–1996a; Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, 25 U.S.C. §§ 3001–\n3013; Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C. §§ 2701–2721 (authorizing tribes to open and \nrun high-stakes gaming on tribal lands); Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. § 1377 (authorizing tribes \nto obtain primacy over water quality standards, permitting, and other regulatory functions that \nstates may perform); Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7601(d)(2)(B) (authorizing tribes to regulate air \nquality in Indian Country).  Congress has also begun to codify the requirement of tribal \nconsultation into some federal environmental statutes, in part to ensure that treaty rights are \nadequately safeguarded during federal agency decision making processes.  E.g. National Historic \nPreservation Act, 42 U.S.C. § 470(a)(d)(6) (requiring federal agencies to identify properties of \n  20 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 531   Filed 05/20/20   Page 27 of 34\n \nreligious and cultural significance to tribes and consult with tribes prior to authorizing activities \nthat will impact such properties).  Presidents from Kennedy to Obama echoed Congress’s \nsupport for tribal self-determination, tribal sovereignty, and treaty rights, forming a consistent \nand predictable governmental relationship with federally recognized tribes over nearly half a \ncentury.  Goldberg, American Indian Law, p. 35.  Courts have also recognized an affirmative \nobligation on the part of federal agencies administering statutes that affect tribal interests, \nholding that the “[a]pplication of federal statutes to Indian tribes must be viewed in light of the \nfederal policies which promote tribal self-government, self-sufficiency, and economic \ndevelopment.”  Nat’l Labor Relations Bd. v. Pueblo of San Juan, 280 F.3d 1278, 1284 (10th Cir. \n2000), reh'g en banc, 276 F.3d 1186 (10th Cir. 2002).   \nDespite the uniform application of this federal policy by the legislative, judicial, and \nExecutive branches in recent decades, the Trump Administration has taken a dramatically \ndifferent tack.  In the past three years, the Administration has undertaken what many indigenous \npeoples view as an assault on tribal sovereignty, tribal treaty rights, and tribal self-determination, \nparticularly when large corporate interests are involved.  In his first year in office, President \nTrump attempted to reverse President Obama’s protection of the submerged lands of the \ncontinental shelf from mineral leasing, over the objections of indigenous Alaskans, to increase \nthe pace of offshore oil and gas drilling in the Arctic and North Atlantic Oceans.  League of \nConservation Voters v. Trump, 363 F. Supp. 3d 1013, 1024 (D. Alaska 2019) (invalidating \nTrump Executive Order attempting to modify Obama withdrawal under Outer Continental Shelf \nLands Act).  The President also issued a Proclamation reducing the Bears Ears National \nMonument, breaching the terms of the agreement President Obama had negotiated with the Hopi, \nNavajo, Ute and Zuni nations to establish and protect the Bears Ears region from development, \n  21 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 531   Filed 05/20/20   Page 28 of 34\n \nincluding uranium mining and oil and gas leasing.  Pres. Procl. Modifying the Bears Ears \nNational Monument, 82 Fed. Reg. 58081 (Dec. 5, 2017) (reducing Bears Ears National \nMonument to allow mineral development); see also Amended Complaint, Hopi Tribe v. Trump, \n2019 WL 7943150, ¶ 29 (D.D.C., filed Nov. 7, 2019) (challenging Trump reduction of Bears \nEars National Monument).  The effects of diminishing the first tribally proposed national \nmonument were compounded by President Trump’s decisions to re-name part of the new \nnational monument using only the Navajo Nation’s term for Bears Ears (Shash Jaa’), rather than \nthe tribal Coalition’s agreed upon English name, Bears Ears National Monument, and his attempt \nto dilute the indigenous representation on the tribal advisory commission by changing the \nstructure of the commission to include a local county commissioner.  82 Fed. Reg. 58081.  The \nAdministration took these actions despite the strenuous objections of the affected tribes, leading \nmany to conclude that the Administration was directly attacking their sovereignty and self-\ndetermination.  See Bears Ears Coalition, Press Release - Tribal Leaders Extremely Disappointed \nOver Action by President Trump to Revoke and Replace Bears Ears National Monument (Dec. 4, \n2017), available at https://bearsearscoalition.org/tribal-leaders-extremely-disappointed-over-\naction-by-president-trump-to-revoke-and-replace-bears-ears-national-monument/     \nMore recently, the Department of Interior has advanced several proposals that threaten \ntribal communities, including increased drilling for natural gas near Chaco Canyon National \nHistoric Park, over the objection of neighboring tribal communities.  Dine Citizens Against \nRuining Our Env't v. Bernhardt, 923 F.3d 831, 842 (10th Cir. 2019), reh'g denied (June 24, \n2019).  In March 2020, the Department announced that it will remove the land-into-trust decision \nfor the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe, effectively disestablishing its reservation, in the midst of the \nCovid-19 global health pandemic, which has devastated several tribal communities.  This is \n  22 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 531   Filed 05/20/20   Page 29 of 34\n \ndespite Congress’s ongoing process of formally recognizing the Mashpee reservation; the House \nof Representatives passed the Mashpee Wampanoag Reservation Reaffirmation Act (H.R. 312) \non May 15, 2019 and the bill is currently under consideration in the Senate.  Collectively, these \nactions demonstrate unilateral and purposeful acts of an Executive branch set on diminishing \ntribal sovereignty and tribal self-determination, reversing the course of decades of federal Indian \npolicy and undermining the efforts of co-equal branches of government, Congress and the \njudiciary.  The overall equities in this case require the Court to vacate the easement to ensure that \nthe Trump Administration does not further diminish the Plaintiffs’ sovereign rights or their treaty \nrights, without the in-depth analysis that NEPA requires.    \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, the undersigned members of Congress request that this Court \nvacate the Lake Oahe easement on remand.  \n \nDated: May 20, 2020         Respectfully submitted,  \n \n \n/s/ William S.

Defendant-Intervenor Dakota Access LLC has now filed a Motion for a \nProtective Order in which it asks the Court to shield portions of eleven documents in that record \nfrom public disclosure based on its concern that terrorists or other individuals looking to damage \nthe pipeline could use such information to inflict environmental injury.  The Corps opposes the \nMotion in part, and the Tribes oppose it in full.  As the Court concludes that Dakota Access has \nlargely failed to meet its burden to show good cause for such an order, it will deny the Motion in \nthe main, but grant it as to parts of five of the eleven documents.       \nI.  Background  \n \n  On November 10, 2016, the Corps lodged the administrative record for its July 25, 2016, \ndecisions related to the permitting of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL).  See ECF No. 55.  It \ninitially withheld from its production 31 documents that Dakota Access had identified as \n  1\n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 206   Filed 04/07/17   Page 2 of 13\ncontaining confidential information warranting protection.  See ECF No. 95 (Mot.) at 2 n.1; ECF \nNo. 146 (Corps Opp.) at 2.  Upon further consideration, Dakota Access narrowed its concern to \neleven documents.  See Mot. at 2 & n.1.  It filed a Motion for a Protective Order on February 1, \n2017, asking the Court to withhold portions of those documents from public disclosure.   \nThe eleven documents at issue fall into three categories:  \n(1)  a  set  of  five  documents  entitled  “Spill Model  Discussion,” \nprepared for five different pipeline locations (two in North Dakota \nand three in Illinois); (2) a set of five corresponding geographic \nresponse  plans;  and  (3)  a  single  prevention  and  response  plan \nprepared  by  Dakota  Access’s  Horizontal  Directional  Drilling \ncontractor. \n \nECF No. 161 (Reply) at 3.  Within those documents, Dakota Access asks the Court to protect \n“geographic information that specifically details pipeline infrastructure routes through private \nland” and “spill response information that specifically details pipeline features, capacity, flow \nrate, transportation, and related emergency response information, safeguards, and plans in certain \nsensitive locations along the [DAPL] route.”  Mot. at 2.  Dakota Access believes that the \ninformation “pinpoints locations where intentional damage to an oil pipeline would generate the \ngreatest harm, and . . . reveals in great detail the manner in which the authorities would try to \nrespond to that damage.”  Id. at 1.  It therefore worries that “terrorists or others with . . . \nmalicious intent” will use the information to damage the pipeline in ways that maximize \nenvironmental harm.  Id. at 3.    \nThe Corps opposes redacting or otherwise withholding from public disclosure the five \ngeographic-response plans and the HDD prevention-and-response plan, but consents to a limited \nset of redactions to the five spill-model discussions.  See Corps Opp. at 1-2, 4.  The Tribes \noppose any withholding.  See ECF No. 150-1 (Tribes Opp.) at 3.  To be clear, all disputed \ndocuments have been provided in full to the Tribes’ counsel so that they may be cited in the \n  2\n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 206   Filed 04/07/17   Page 3 of 13\npending summary-judgment briefing.  Id. at 4.     \nII.  Analysis \n  Dakota Access offers three bases on which certain details in the eleven documents should \nbe protected from public disclosure: (1) the information constitutes Sensitive Security \nInformation; (2) the information constitutes Critical Infrastructure Information; and (3) the \ninformation should be withheld pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(c).  The Court \naddresses each in turn.  \nA.  Sensitive Security Information \nAfter the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress created the Transportation \nSecurity Administration and entrusted it with the authority “to shield information from disclosure \nwhen it determined the release of that information would be ‘detrimental to the security of \ntransportation.’”  Lacson v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 726 F.3d 170, 172 (D.C. Cir. 2013) \n(quoting Pub. L. No. 107-296, § 1601(b), 116 Stat. 2135, 2312 (2002) (codified as amended at \n49 U.S.C. § 114(r))).  TSA accordingly promulgated regulations regarding the protection of \nSensitive Security Information.  See 49 C.F.R. pt. 1520.  Those regulations define SSI as \n“information obtained or developed in the conduct of security activities, including research and \ndevelopment, the disclosure of which TSA has determined would . . . [b]e detrimental to the \nsafety of transportation.”  Id. § 1520.5(a).  They also set forth categories of information that can \nconstitute SSI, including “[a]ny security program or security contingency plan issued, \nestablished, required, received, or approved by [the Department of Transportation] or [the \nDepartment of Homeland Security],” and “[a]ny vulnerability assessment directed, created, held, \nfunded, or approved by the DOT, DHS, or that will be provided to DOT or DHS in support of a \nFederal security program.”  Id. § 1520.5(b)(1), (5).   \n  3\n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 206   Filed 04/07/17   Page 4 of 13\nAccording to Dakota Access, “Oil pipelines are a transportation activity and subject to \n[SSI] protection,” and the information it asks the Court to redact implicates “security programs,” \n“security contingency plans,” “vulnerability assessments,” or “information detailing or relating \nto DAPL security programs, security contingency plans, and/or vulnerability assessments.”  Mot. \nat 5-6.  The Chief of TSA’s SSI Program, however, who has the authority to make SSI \ndeterminations, see Lacson, 726 F.3d at 173 n.1, reviewed the eleven documents Dakota Access \nseeks to shield and determined that they “do not contain any SSI.”  ECF No. 146-2 (Letter from \nD. Blair, TSA, to E. Zilioli, DOJ, Feb. 27, 2017).  This Court lacks the power to disturb that \nconclusion, as federal circuit courts have exclusive jurisdiction to review TSA’s SSI \ndeterminations.  See 49 U.S.C. § 46110(a), (c); Elec. Privacy Info. Ctr. v. Dep’t of Homeland \nSec., 928 F. Supp. 2d 139, 146-47 (D.D.C. 2013).  The Court therefore must reject Dakota \nAccess’s argument that the documents should be withheld on the ground that they contain SSI.  \nB.  Critical Infrastructure Information \nThe Company next posits that “[c]ertain details in the documents also constitute Critical \nInfrastructure Information and should therefore be protected from public disclosure.”  Mot. at 7.  \nThe Court cannot agree.   \nDakota Access relies on the Critical Infrastructures Protection Act of 2001, a statute \nenacted to protect physical and information infrastructures.  Under that law, the term “critical \ninfrastructure” means “systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United \nStates that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating \nimpact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any \ncombination of those matters.”  42 U.S.C. § 5195c(e).  Because “DAPL is part of the national \ncritical physical infrastructure” and the eleven documents contain information that, if made \n  4\n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 206   Filed 04/07/17   Page 5 of 13\npublic, “might compromise and/or undermine DAPL security protections and procedures,” \nDakota Access asserts, permitting their public disclosure “would risk disrupting energy sector \ninfrastructure in subversion of the Act’s purpose.”  Mot. at 8.   \nThat Act does not prohibit the public disclosure of infrastructure-related information, but \nthe Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 established the Protected Critical \nInfrastructure Information Program, which protects from disclosure infrastructure information a \ncompany voluntarily shares with a federal agency.  See 6 U.S.C. § 133.  Yet that Program is of \nno use to the Company.  Written information receives protection under the Program when it is \nsubmitted with the following label: “This information is voluntarily submitted to the Federal \ngovernment in expectation of protection from disclosure as provided by the provisions of the \nCritical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002.”  6 C.F.R. § 29.5(a)(3)(i).  Dakota Access never \nalleges that the eleven documents contain this required statement, nor does it contend that they \nwere subsequently marked as Protected Critical Infrastructure Information by the relevant DHS \nofficial.  Id. § 29.2(g).  The Court, consequently, cannot endorse this second asserted basis for \nthe protective order. \nC.  Rule 26(c) \nAlthough success may not obtain via statute, Dakota Access is not yet out of cards.  It \nnext turns to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Where a movant can show “good cause,” \nRule 26(c)(1) permits courts to issue protective orders to guard against “annoyance, \nembarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense.”  As is relevant here, courts may use \nsuch orders to “requir[e] that a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or \ncommercial information not be revealed or be revealed only in a specified way.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n26(c)(1)(G).   \n  5\n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 206   Filed 04/07/17   Page 6 of 13\nAs a threshold matter, the Tribes note that application of Rule 26(c) to the present \ncircumstances would be inapposite — no party is seeking the discovery of materials outside the \nadministrative record; Dakota Access instead wishes to withhold from public disclosure \nmaterials already included in the administrative record.  See Tribes Opp. at 9-10.  But courts \nhave previously approved protective orders to shield portions of administrative records from \npublic disclosure, and the Court sees no reason it lacks the power to do so here.  See, e.g., \nRaytheon Co. v. Dep’t of Navy, 1989 WL 550581, at *1 n.2 (D.D.C. Dec. 22, 1989); Genentech, \nInc. v. Bowen, 1987 WL 10500, at *1-2 (D.D.C. Apr. 21, 1987).  \nTrial courts have “broad discretion . . . to decide when a protective order is appropriate \nand what degree of protection is required.”  Seattle Times Co. v. Rhinehart, 467 U.S. 20, 36 \n(1984).  “The ‘good cause’ standard is a flexible one that requires an individualized balancing of \nthe many interests that may be present in a particular case.”  United States v. Microsoft Corp., \n165 F.3d 952, 960 (D.C. Cir. 1999).  Ultimately, though, the party requesting the protective order \nhas the burden to establish that it should be granted.  See Ecomission Sols., LLC v. CTS \nHoldings, Inc., 2016 WL 4506974, at *2 (D.D.C. Aug. 26, 2016) (describing movant’s burden as \n“heavy”); Doe v. Provident Life & Accident Ins. Co., 247 F.R.D. 218, 221 (D.D.C. 2008).  To do \nso, the movant “must make a specific demonstration of facts in support of the request as opposed \nto conclusory or speculative statements about the need for a protective order and the harm which \nwill be suffered without one.”  Alexander v. FBI, 186 F.R.D. 71, 75 (D.D.C. 1998).  With these \nprinciples in mind, the Court now proceeds to identify and then to balance the relevant interests \nof the parties.  \nAs already noted, Dakota Access urges that a protective order is necessary to further its \ninterest in security and energy infrastructure.  It maintains that if the eleven documents are \n  6\n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 206   Filed 04/07/17   Page 7 of 13\nreleased in full — i.e., absent its proposed redactions — “persons with the malicious intent to \ndamage the pipeline will be better able to maximize the harm that they hope to inflict.”  Mot. at \n10-11.   \nThe Tribes, conversely, contend that public release of the full administrative record \n“would greatly assist other agencies, the public, and the Tribes in understanding the basis for the \nCorps’ conclusion that the risks and impacts of oil spills were so insignificant that no \n[Environmental Impact Statement] was necessary.”  Tribes Opp. at 2.  They further argue that the \ndocuments “address matters of keen public interest” and that “public scrutiny of the documents, \nand analysis by independent experts and other agencies, will support [the Tribes’] public \nadvocacy efforts regarding the pipeline.”  Id. at 11.   \nLikewise, in opposing the Motion as to the five geographic-response plans and the HDD \nprevention-and-response plan and consenting only to more limited redactions to the five spill-\nmodel discussions, the Corps asserts that, because “the documents in question are part of the \nCorps’ records, there is an interest in making the information publicly available.”  Corps Opp. at \n10.   \nIn weighing these interests, the Court first considers whether, as the movant, Dakota \nAccess has “ma[d]e a specific demonstration of facts in support of [its] request.”  Alexander, 186 \nF.R.D. at 75.  It certainly did not do so in its first brief.  The only evidence proffered therein is a \nnews article recounting comments made in 2014 by the Association of American Railroads and \nthe American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association to the Federal Railroad \nAdministration opposing a federal emergency order that required railroads to share oil-train route \nand volume data with state emergency-response commissions given their fear that \n“environmental extremists” and “[f]oreign terrorists” posed risks to “the transportation of crude \n  7\n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 206   Filed 04/07/17   Page 8 of 13\noil by rail.”  ECF No. 92-2 (Blake Sobczak, Rail Executives Feared Terrorists Would Disrupt \n“Virtual Pipeline”, E&E News, Jan. 24, 2017).  As this case concerns the transportation of oil by \npipeline in 2017, rather than by rail in 2014, that article can hardly be said to substantiate Dakota \nAccess’s assertions of harm from disclosure of the eleven documents.   \nThe Company’s Reply is somewhat more helpful in this respect.  It cites an October 2016 \nnews article that describes how climate activists broke through fences, locks, and chains to turn \noff the valves on five cross-border oil pipelines in an effort to oppose the Dakota Access \nPipeline.  See Reply at 11 & n.4 (citing Liz Hampton & Ethan Lou, Bolt Cutters Expose \nVulnerability of North America’s Oil Pipeline Grid, Reuters, Oct. 12, 2016, \nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-canada-pipelines-vulnerabilities-idUSKCN12C0BK).  \nYet, although pipeline operators and safety experts interviewed for the article noted that shutting \noff the valves was “extremely dangerous” and risked serious ruptures, the activists apparently did \nnot intend to cause harm to people or the environment.  See Hampton & Lou.  Rather, the \nprotestors claimed to have “spent months studying how to safely shut the valves,” even if they \nultimately “underestimated the risks.”  Id.  Dakota Access, conversely, expresses concern about \n“terrorists” and individuals with “malicious intent” who would want to use the information in the \nadministrative record to “maximize the harm that they hope to inflict.”  Mot. at 3, 10-11.  As the \nnews article cited in the Reply does not concern people with such intent, it does not go directly to \nthe concern animating the Motion.  \n Fortunately for Dakota Access, the Corps comes to its aid, at least as to the risks \npresented by disclosure of some of the information in the five spill-model reports.  At the Corps’ \nrequest, David Lehman, the Director of the Oil Spill Preparedness and Emergency Support \nDivision in the Office of Pipeline Safety at the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety \n  8\n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 206   Filed 04/07/17   Page 9 of 13\nAdministration (PHMSA), a unit within the Department of Transportation, reviewed the \ndocuments marked for redaction by Dakota Access.  See ECF No. 146-1 (Declaration of David \nLehman, Mar. 1, 2017), ¶¶ 2-4.  Lehman’s duties include “identifying information that should be \nprotected from public disclosure for security reasons,” id., ¶ 2, and he concluded that the spill-\nmodel reports “include[] information that PHMSA would redact from public disclosure under 5 \nU.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(F), which protects records compiled for law enforcement purposes and that if \nreleased, could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.”  \nId., ¶ 5.  Lehman accordingly identified approximately 50 redactions to the spill-model reports, \nwhich are both fewer and more targeted than the ones proposed by Dakota Access.  See ECF No. \n148-1 (Corps Redactions).   \nLehman’s reliance on the Freedom of Information Act’s Exemption 7(F) to recommend \nagainst full disclosure of the spill-model reports is permissible even though the question whether \nto release them did not arise in a FOIA action.  Third parties have the right to protect documents \nwith their information from improper disclosure by the government.  See Jurewicz v. U.S. Dep’t \nof Agric., 891 F. Supp. 2d 147, 151 (D.D.C. 2012) (“When an agency decides that no FOIA \nexemption applies, ‘[a] person whose information is about to be disclosed pursuant to a FOIA \nrequest may file a ‘reverse-FOIA action’ and seek to enjoin the Government from disclosing \nit.’”) (quoting Canadian Commercial Corp. v. Dep’t of Air Force, 514 F.3d 37, 39 (D.C. Cir. \n2008)), aff’d, 741 F.3d 1326 (D.C. Cir. 2014); see also Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, \n317-18 (1979) (holding that third parties can challenge under the Administrative Procedure Act \nagency decisions to disclose records in response to FOIA requests).   \nThe Court thus considers the spill-model documents first and then the ones in the \nremaining two categories.  \n  9\n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 206   Filed 04/07/17   Page 10 of 13\n1.  Spill-Model Discussions \nThe Court has reviewed the five spill-model discussions and the proposed redactions \nfrom Dakota Access and PHMSA.  Both entities would redact maps of DAPL at certain \ncrossings, the names of pipeline segments when paired with timelines for detecting and shutting \ndown spills, graphs of spill-risk scores at various points along the pipeline, maps of spill \nscenarios and predictions as to the volume of oil that would be released, the names of systems \nused to monitor the pipeline for leaks, and methods of communication with those monitoring \nsystems.  Compare, e.g., Corps Redactions at 6, 10, 15-17, 19-21 (AR 12402, 12406, 12411-13, \n12415-17), with ECF No. 94 (Dakota Access Redactions) at 6, 10, 15-17, 19-21 (AR 12402, \n12406, 12411-13, 12415-17).  Dakota Access would go further and have the Court conceal the \nname of the crossing to which each spill-model report corresponds.  Compare, e.g., Corps \nRedactions at 2-22 (AR 12398-418) with Dakota Access Redactions at 2-22 (AR 12398-418).   \nBased on its review and PHMSA’s determination, the Court concludes that there is good \ncause to protect from public disclosure the information PHMSA redacted from the five spill-\nmodel reports.  As noted, Lehman determined that this information would be withheld by \nPHMSA under FOIA Exemption 7(F), which permits an agency to withhold documents that were \n“compiled for law enforcement purposes” if their release “could reasonably be expected to \nendanger the life or physical safety of any individual.”  5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(F).  That conclusion \nis consistent with the D.C. Circuit’s recognition that, “in Exemption 7(F) cases involving \ndocuments relating to critical infrastructure, ‘it is not difficult to show that disclosure may \nendanger the life or physical safety of any individual.’”  Pub. Emps. for Envtl. Responsibility v. \nU.S. Section, Int’l Boundary & Water Comm’n, U.S.-Mexico, 740 F.3d 195, 205-06 (D.C. Cir. \n2014) (quoting Milner v. Dep’t of Navy, 562 U.S. 562, 582 (2011) (Alito, J., concurring)) \n  10\n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 206   Filed 04/07/17   Page 11 of 13\n(quotation omitted).  Indeed, in PEER, the Court of Appeals held that inundation maps that \ndisplayed the downstream areas and populations that would be affected if certain dams located \non the U.S-Mexico border were to break, the estimated time it would take for floodwater to reach \ndownstream locations, and the peak flow times at those locations were properly withheld under \nExemption 7(F).  Id. at 200, 206.  In so doing, it credited the government’s explanation that \ndisclosure of the inundation maps “would give anyone seeking to cause harm the ability to \ndeduce the zones and populations most affected by dam failure,” thus enabling “[t]errorists or \ncriminals” to “use that information to determine whether attacking a dam would be worthwhile, \nwhich dam would provide the most attractive target, and what the likely effect of a dam break \nwould be.”  Id. at 206 (quotation omitted).  The spill-model discussions in the administrative \nrecord here are much like the inundation maps described in PEER.  \nThe Court further concludes that, as to the PHMSA redactions in those five documents, \nthe asserted interest in limiting intentionally inflicted harm outweighs the Tribes’ generalized \ninterests in public disclosure and scrutiny, particularly given that all parties in the case will have \naccess to the full, unredacted administrative record for purposes of the summary-judgment \nlitigation.  \n2.  Geographic-Response Plans and HDD Prevention-and-Response Plan \nThe Court, however, does not reach the same outcome as to Dakota Access’s proposed \nredactions to the other six documents.  In the geographic-response plans, the Company suggests \nredacting the phone numbers of local government agencies, including the sheriff, fire \ndepartment, and levee districts; the names of waterways potentially affected by spills; and maps \nand descriptions of potential deflection/containment booms.  See, e.g., Dakota Access \nRedactions at 81-97 (AR 12477-93).  In the HDD contingency plan, Dakota Access similarly \n  11\n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 206   Filed 04/07/17   Page 12 of 13\nrequests the masking of the name, location, and mile post of each crossing at which HDD \nservices were provided, as well as the length of HDD pipe.  Id. at 117 (AR 67858).  Lehman saw \nno reason PHMSA would redact this or any other information from the six documents, see \nLehman Decl., ¶ 6, and the Court does not find that they obviously implicate the security \nconcerns Dakota Access raises.     \nAs already noted, Dakota Access offers very little in the way of specific facts to support \nits argument that terrorists or other individuals with malicious intent might use this information \nto craft a plan to harm the pipeline in a way that causes the greatest damage.  It also does not \npersuasively respond to the argument from the Corps and the Tribes that much of the information \nin the proposed redactions is already public.  See Corps Opp. at 11; Tribes Opp. at 2.  The \nCompany acknowledges that some of the information may be available, but claims that although \nit “poses no particular danger while standing alone,” such information may nonetheless “be \nvaluable to wrongdoers when available to them in conjunction with other information, such as \ndetails on how a spill response will be conducted at that location.”  Mot. at 9 n.7.  Such \ngeneralities, absent further explanation or factual support, cannot suffice to justify this Court’s \nexercise of its Rule 26(c) authority, particularly where the parties opposing the Motion have \nasserted reasonable interests in disclosure.  See Corps Opp. at 10 (interest in making agency’s \nown record publicly available); Tribes Opp. at 11 (interest in enabling public analysis and \ndebate).  For these reasons, the Court believes that Dakota Access has not carried its burden to \nshow good cause for the requested protective order as to the five geographic-response plans and \nthe HDD prevention-and-response plan.  \nThe Court will thus deny the Motion for a Protective Order except as to the \napproximately 50 redactions to the five spill-model discussions proposed by PHMSA.     \n  12\n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 206   Filed 04/07/17   Page 13 of 13\nIII.  Conclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant the Motion for a Protective Order in part \nand deny it in part.  A contemporaneous Order so stating will issue this day.  \n/s/ James E.

As Movant−Intervenors' [145−1] Proposed Complaint\nadds President Trump as a defendant and seeks relief beyond that sought by the\nStanding Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux Tribes, such intervention would unduly\nexpand the scope of the case. If Movant−Intervenors wish to proceed against President\nTrump, either individually or in his official capacity, they must file a separate action. If\nthey wish to join this case under the conditions stated herein, the Court will grant their\nMotion to Intervene. They shall file a notice by June 20, 2017, indicating their\nposition.

(lcjeb3) (Entered:\n06/14/2017)\n06/14/2017 MINUTE ORDER: In its 220 Motion to Supplement the Administrative Record and\nAlternative Motion to Consider Documents Outside the Administrative Record,\nCheyenne River makes two separate arguments. First, the Tribe asks that six\ndocuments be included in the administrative record. There is a dispute about whether\nthese documents were properly before the Corps when it made its permitting decisions,\nand thus whether they should be included in the administrative record. As the Court\nhas reviewed the documents and concluded that they would not change the outcome in\nits 239 Opinion on the various Cross−Motions for Summary Judgment, the Court need\nnot resolve this procedural question and therefore DENIES the Motion to Supplement.\nSecond, and in the alternative, the Tribe asks that the Court consider eight\nextra−record documents. The Court DENIES the Motion to Consider Documents\nOutside the Administrative Record for the same reasons given in its 239 Opinion\nregarding Standing Rock's request that the Court consider extra−record evidence.\nSigned by Judge James E.

Civil Action No. 16-1534 (JEB) \nU.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS, et   \nal.,  \n   \nDefendants. \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nDesigned to transport oil from the Bakken oil fields in North Dakota to a storage hub in \nsouthern Illinois, the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) has also borne substantial controversy in \nits wake.  Most significant has been the opposition from Indian tribes whose reservations lie in \nclose proximity to the pipeline’s crossing of the Missouri River at Lake Oahe.  To block Dakota \nAccess LLC’s construction of that last segment and its operation of DAPL, the Standing Rock \nSioux Tribe filed this suit in July 2016, and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe intervened shortly \nthereafter.  \nThe Tribes have since mounted two substantial legal challenges to DAPL, neither of \nwhich yielded success.  The first contended that the grading and clearing of land for the pipeline \nthreatened sites of cultural and historical significance, and that the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers had flouted its duty to engage in tribal consultations pursuant to the National Historic \nPreservation Act.  See Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs (Standing Rock \nI), 205 F. Supp. 3d 4, 7 (D.D.C. 2016).  The second maintained that the presence of oil in the \npipeline under Lake Oahe would desecrate sacred waters and make it impossible for the Tribes to \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 2 of 91\nfreely exercise their religious beliefs, thus violating the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.  See \nStanding Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs (Standing Rock II), No. 16-1534, 2017 \nWL 908538, at *1 (D.D.C. Mar. 7, 2017).   \nNow that the Court has rejected these two lines of attack, Standing Rock and Cheyenne \nRiver here take their third shot, this time zeroing in DAPL’s environmental impact.  They seek \nsummary judgment on several counts related to the Corps’ alleged failure to comply with the \nNational Environmental Policy Act.  In particular, the Tribes believe that the Corps did not \nsufficiently consider the pipeline’s environmental effects before granting permits to Dakota \nAccess to construct and operate DAPL under Lake Oahe, a federally regulated waterway.  This \nvolley meets with some degree of success.  Although the Corps substantially complied with \nNEPA in many areas, the Court agrees that it did not adequately consider the impacts of an oil \nspill on fishing rights, hunting rights, or environmental justice, or the degree to which the \npipeline’s effects are likely to be highly controversial.   \nTo remedy those violations, the Corps will have to reconsider those sections of its \nenvironmental analysis upon remand by the Court.  Whether Dakota Access must cease pipeline \noperations during that remand presents a separate question of the appropriate remedy, which will \nbe the subject of further briefing.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 3 of 91\nTable of Contents \n \nI.   Background ............................................................................................................... 4 \nA.  NEPA  4 \nB.  Factual History  6 \nC.  Litigation  11 \n1.  Filing of Suit .................................................................................................... 11 \n2.  Further Consideration ...................................................................................... 12 \n3.  A New Administration..................................................................................... 16 \nII.   Legal Standard ........................................................................................................ 19 \nIII.   Analysis of Standing Rock’s Claims ...................................................................... 21 \nA.  Decision Not to Prepare EIS  21 \n1.  Hard Look / Convincing Case ......................................................................... 22 \na.  Extent of Record ............................................................................................. 23 \nb.  Spill-Risk Analysis ......................................................................................... 27 \nc.  Impacts Analysis Re: Treaty Rights ............................................................... 36 \n2.  Alternatives ...................................................................................................... 43 \n3.  Environmental Justice...................................................................................... 47 \nB.  Decision to Grant the Easement  54 \n1.  Policy Change .................................................................................................. 55 \n2.  Trust Responsibilities ...................................................................................... 59 \nC.  NWP 12  63 \nD.  Remedy  66 \nIV.  Analysis of Cheyenne River’s Claims .................................................................... 67 \nA.  Section 408 Decision  68 \n1.  Impairment....................................................................................................... 69 \n2.  Injurious to Public Interest .............................................................................. 71 \n3.  Other Arguments ............................................................................................. 72 \nB.  Easement Decision  75 \n1.  Section 185(b)(1) ............................................................................................. 76 \n2.  Section 185(h)(2) ............................................................................................. 78 \n3.  Section 185(x).................................................................................................. 79 \nC.  Trust Responsibilities  80 \nD.  Consultation  81 \nV.  Conclusion .............................................................................................................. 91 \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 4 of 91\nI.   Background \n \nTo familiarize the reader with the background information relevant to its analysis, the \nCourt first briefly sets out the National Environmental Policy Act’s statutory framework and then \nseparately discusses the factual history and litigation to date. \nA.  NEPA \nThe National Environmental Policy Act, the statute under which the majority of the \nTribes’ claims are brought, has two aims: it “places upon an agency the obligation to consider \nevery significant aspect of the environmental impact of a proposed action,” and “it ensures that \nthe agency will inform the public that it has indeed considered environmental concerns in its \ndecisionmaking process.”  Baltimore Gas & Elec. Co. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 462 \nU.S. 87, 97 (1983) (citation omitted).  NEPA’s requirements are “procedural,” requiring \n“agencies to imbue their decisionmaking, through the use of certain procedures, with our \ncountry’s commitment to environmental salubrity.”  Citizens Against Burlington, Inc. v. Busey, \n938 F.2d 190, 193-94 (D.C. Cir. 1991).  Importantly, “NEPA does not mandate particular \nconsequences,” id. at 194, and courts are discouraged from substituting their own policy \njudgments for that of the agency.  See N. Slope Borough v. Andrus, 642 F.2d 589, 599 (D.C. Cir. \n1980); see also Marsh v. Or. Nat. Res. Council, 490 U.S. 360, 378 (1989).  “NEPA merely \nprohibits uninformed — rather than unwise — agency action.”  Robertson v. Methow Valley \nCitizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 351 (1989).  Agency actions with adverse environmental effects \ncan thus be NEPA compliant where “the agency has considered those effects and determined that \ncompeting policy values outweigh those costs.”  Ohio Valley Envtl. Coal. v. Aracoma Coal Co., \n556 F.3d 177, 191 (4th Cir. 2009) (citations omitted).   \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 5 of 91\n  Under NEPA, an agency must prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for any \nproposed major federal action “significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.”  42 \nU.S.C. § 4332(2)(C).  An EIS must detail the environmental impact of the proposed action, any \nunavoidable adverse effects, alternatives to the proposed action, the relationship between short-\nterm uses of the environment and long-term productivity, and any irreversible commitments of \nresources.  Id.  \nTo determine whether an agency must prepare an EIS, it first drafts an Environmental \nAssessment.  See 40 C.F.R. § 1501.4(b).  An EA is a “concise public document” that “[b]riefly \nprovide[s] sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an environmental \nimpact statement or a finding of no significant impact.”  Id. § 1508.9(a).  The EA must discuss \nthe need for the proposal, the alternatives, the environmental impacts of the proposed action and \nalternatives, and the agencies and persons consulted.  Id. § 1508.9(b).  If, after preparing an EA, \nthe agency determines that an EIS is not necessary, it must prepare a Finding of No Significant \nImpact (FONSI) setting forth the reasons why the action will not have any significant impact on \nthe environment.  Id. §§ 1501.4(e), 1508.13; cf. Grand Canyon Trust v. FAA, 290 F.3d 339, 340 \n(D.C. Cir. 2002) (“If any ‘significant’ environmental impacts might result from the proposed \nagency action then an EIS must be prepared before agency action is taken.”) (quoting Sierra Club \nv. Peterson, 717 F.2d 1409, 1415 (D.C. Cir. 1983)).  If the action will not have such impact \nbecause of the agency’s commitment to ensure the performance of mitigation measures, the \nagency prepares a Mitigated FONSI.  See Council on Environmental Quality, Appropriate Use of \nMitigation and Monitoring and Clarifying the Appropriate Use of Mitigated Findings of No \nSignificant Impact 2, 7 (2011), https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/NEPA-\nCEQ_Mitigation_and_Monitoring_Guidance_14Jan2011.pdf.  Mitigation includes “[a]voiding \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 6 of 91\nan impact by not taking a certain action”; “[m]inimizing an impact by limiting the degree or \nmagnitude of the action”; “[r]ectifying an impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the \naffected environment”; “[r]educing or eliminating an impact over time, through preservation and \nmaintenance operations”; and “[c]ompensating for an impact by replacing or providing substitute \nresources or environments.”  Id. at 4-5.  As will be explained below, the Corps here prepared an \nEA and a Mitigated FONSI.  The central question this Opinion answers is whether that was \nsufficient. \nB.  Factual History \nAs those who have followed this litigation and the concomitant public debate well know, \nDAPL is a nearly 1,200-mile pipeline designed to move more than half a million gallons of crude \noil from North Dakota to Illinois every day.  Standing Rock I, 205 F. Supp. 3d at 7.  Although no \ngovernment approval is necessary for oil pipelines traversing private lands, it is required for \nthose segments that cross federally regulated waters.  Id.  DAPL crosses such waterways at \nhundreds of discrete places along its route, including, most prominently, at Lake Oahe.  Id.     \nCreated by the Corps in 1958 via a dam constructed on the Missouri River, Lake Oahe is \na reservoir that spans North and South Dakota and borders the Standing Rock and Cheyenne \nRiver Sioux Reservations to the east.  Id. at 13; ECF No. 172-1 (Environmental Assessment) at \n35, 75; ECF No. 97-1 (CRST Second Amended Complaint), ¶ 29.  DAPL crosses the Lake 0.55 \nmiles north of the Standing Rock Reservation and 73 miles north of the Cheyenne River \nReservation.  See Standing Rock II, 2017 WL 908538, at *1; EA at 75.  For orientation purposes, \nthe southern border of the former Reservation also acts as the northern border of the latter.  See \nECF No. 117-5 (Map of Current Sioux Reservations).   \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 7 of 91\nLake Oahe holds special significance for the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux \nTribes.  Its creation necessitated the taking of approximately 56,000 acres of some of “the best \nland” from Standing Rock’s Reservation, as well as 104,420 acres of Cheyenne River’s trust \nlands.  See Act of Sept. 2, 1958, Pub. L. No. 85-915, 72 Stat. 1762; S. Rep. No. 102-267, at 188 \n(1992); Standing Rock II, 2017 WL 908538, at *16 (citing South Dakota v. Bourland, 508 U.S. \n679, 683 (1993)).  Today, Standing Rock members rely on Lake Oahe’s waters to service \n“homes, a hospital, clinics, schools, businesses and government buildings throughout the \nReservation” and to support agriculture and industrial activities.  See ECF No. 117 (SRST MSJ) \nat 4.  The Lake is also the primary source of water for the Cheyenne River Reservation.  See \nCRST Second Amend. Compl., ¶ 2.  Both Tribes consider the waters to be “sacred” and “central \nto [their] practice of religion.”  SRST MSJ at 4; see Standing Rock II, 2017 WL 908538, at *6, 8. \nDakota Access notified the Corps of its intent to construct a portion of DAPL under Lake \nOahe in June 2014, see ECF No. 183-1 (Email from Monica Howard, Dir. Envtl. Sci., Dakota \nAccess, to Jason Renschler, Project Manager, Corps, June 23, 2014), and first sought the Corps’ \napproval to do so in October 2014.  See ECF No. 159-1, Exh. A (Letter from Monica Howard to \nBrent Cossette, Nat. Resource Specialist, Corps, Oct. 21, 2014).  Specifically, the Company \nneeded three authorizations from the Corps: (1) verification that its activities satisfied the terms \nand conditions of Nationwide Permit 12; (2) permission under the Rivers and Harbors Act, 33 \nU.S.C. § 408; and (3) a real-estate easement under the Mineral Leasing Act, 30 U.S.C. § 185.  \nSee ECF No. 172-6 (Memorandum from John Henderson, Omaha District Commander & \nEngineer, Corps, Dec. 3, 2016), ¶ 4.  The Court has previously discussed some of the details of \nthese permitting schemes, see Standing Rock I, 205 F. Supp. 3d at 10-12, and will not repeat \nthem here.  \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 8 of 91\nIn December 2015, the Corps published and sought public comment on a Draft \nEnvironmental Assessment that evaluated the environmental effects of DAPL’s proposed \ncrossing of Lake Oahe and concluded that “construction of the proposed Project [was] not \nexpected to have any significant direct, indirect, or cumulative impacts on the environment.”  \nECF No. 6-19 (Draft EA) at 1; see EA at 1.  Standing Rock promptly submitted comments \ntouching on a range of concerns, including that the Draft EA failed to adequately address \npotential harm from the pipeline’s construction and operations to the Lake’s water and the \nTribe’s rights thereto; did not acknowledge the pipeline’s proximity to the Reservation; \ninsufficiently analyzed the risks of an oil spill; and did not properly address environmental-\njustice considerations.  See ECF No. 159-1, Exh. C (SRST Comments on Draft EA, Jan. 8, 2016) \nat 9-17; id., Exh. D (SRST Suppl. Comments on Draft EA, Mar. 24, 2016) at 2-3.  The Tribe, \naccordingly, asked that the Corps prepare an Environmental Impact Statement to assess the \npipeline’s effects, a request it had also made prior to the Draft EA’s release.  See ECF No. 209-6 \n(Notes for Feb. 18-19, 2016, Tribal Meeting) at 51; ECF No. 209-9 at 33-34 (Letter from Waste \nWin Young, Tribal Historic Preservation Officer, Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, to Martha Chieply, \nOmaha District Regulatory Branch, Corps, Feb. 25, 2015).  Cheyenne River expressed similar \nviews.  See ECF No. 185-1, Exh. II (Letter from Steve Vance, Tribal Historic Preservation \nOfficer, Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, to Richard Harnois, Sr. Field Archaeologist, Corps, May 2, \n2016); ECF No. 183-19 (Letter from Steve Vance to John Henderson, May 19, 2016); ECF No. \n183-20 (Letter from Harold Frazier, Chairman, Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, June 3, 2016).  \nOther federal agencies also weighed in on the Draft EA.  Like the Tribes, the Department \nof the Interior requested that the Corps prepare an EIS, a step it believed necessary given \nDAPL’s “potential impact on trust resources” — i.e., 800,000 acres of land held in trust for the \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 9 of 91\nTribe by Interior, as well as waters on which the Tribe and its members depend for drinking and \nother purposes — should a leak or spill occur.  See ECF No. 209-7 at 21 (Letter from Lawrence \nRoberts, Acting Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, Dep’t of Interior, to Brent Cossette, Mar. \n29, 2016).  Interior criticized the Corps for, inter alia, “not adequately justify[ing] or otherwise \nsupport[ing] its conclusion that there would be no significant impacts upon the surrounding \nenvironment and community” and not assigning a level of intensity to those potential adverse \nimpacts that were acknowledged.  Id.   \nThe Environmental Protection Agency similarly expressed concern that the Draft EA \n“lack[ed] sufficient analysis of direct and indirect impacts to water resources,” did not \nadequately address “the measures that will be required to assure that impacts from construction \nand operation of the pipeline are not significant,” and did “not identify the related effects from \nthe entire project segment.”  ECF No. 209-16 at 184 (Letter from Philip Strobel, Director of \nNEPA Compliance & Review Program, EPA, to Brent Cossette, Jan. 8, 2016).  Although the \nEPA did not believe that the Draft EA “would support a FONSI,” it did not call for the Corps to \nprepare an EIS; instead, it suggested that “information and mitigation could be added to the EA \nin order to support a mitigated FONSI.”  Id. at 187.   \nAfter “becom[ing] aware of the proximity” of DAPL to Standing Rock’s Reservation, the \nEPA supplemented its comments.  See ECF No. 209-8 at 123 (Letter from Philip Strobel to Brent \nCossette, Mar. 11, 2016).  It recommended that the Corps revise the Draft EA and provide a \nsecond public-comment period “to assess potential impacts to drinking water and the Standing \nRock Sioux Tribe,” as well as “additional concerns regarding environmental justice and \nemergency response actions to spills/leaks.”  Id.  Notably, the EPA took some issue with the \nDraft EA’s spill analysis, stating that although it indicated only a minimal spill risk associated \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 10 of 91\nwith the project, based on its “experience in spill response,” a break or leak could significantly \naffect water resources.  Id. at 124.  Given DAPL’s proposed capacity of 13,100 to 16,600 gallons \nper minute of crude oil and the proximity of drinking-water intakes to the Oahe crossing, the \nagency explained, “There would be very little time to determine if a spill or leak affecting \nsurface waters is occurring, to notify water treatment plants and to have treatment plant staff on \nsite to shut down the water intakes.”  Id. at 125.  Finally, the EPA urged the Corps to expand its \nanalysis for purposes of assessing environmental-justice considerations from “the area of \nconstruction disturbance” to “the impacts of the proposed project,” and to look at route \nalternatives.  Id. at 126; see also ECF No. 209-9 at 209 (Email “Quick Summary of Conference \nCall with EPA,” Feb. 25, 2016) (“EPA concerned over the lack of Environmental justice — \nTribal interests have not been addressed sufficiently.”).    \nOn July 25, 2016, about eight months after releasing the Draft EA, the Corps published \nits Final EA and a Mitigated Finding of No Significant Impact.  See EA; ECF No. 172-2 \n(FONSI).  The Final EA — like the Draft EA — was prepared by Dakota Access with \ninvolvement from the Corps, as is permitted, when certain conditions are met, by Council on \nEnvironmental Quality regulations.  See EA at 1; Draft EA at 1; 40 C.F.R. § 1506.5(a)-(b).  The \nMitigated FONSI explained that the Corps had “coordinated closely with Dakota Access to \navoid, mitigate and minimize potential impacts of the Proposed Action” — largely via horizontal \ndirectional drilling (HDD) technology — and that the Company was required to comply with a \nset of mitigation measures set out in the EA.  See FONSI at 3.  Given those measures and its \nevaluation of DAPL’s “anticipated environmental, economic, cultural, . . . social[, and] . . . \ncumulative effects,” the Corps concluded that the crossing at Lake Oahe would not “significantly \naffect the quality of the human environment,” and preparation of an EIS was therefore not \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 11 of 91\nrequired.  Id. at 6.  The Corps, accordingly, verified that the pipeline activities satisfied the terms \nand conditions of NWP 12 and granted permission under Section 408 of the Rivers and Harbors \nAct for DAPL’s placement at Lake Oahe.  See ECF No. 209-9 at 149-53 (NWP 12 Permit); ECF \nNo. 209-10 at 54 (Section 408 Permit).  The parties disagree as to whether the Corps also at that \ntime granted an easement pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act, 30 U.S.C. § 185.  See ECF Nos. \n57, 66, 73.  For purposes of this Opinion — and consistent with its understanding throughout the \nlitigation — the Court will assume that it did not.  Without such easement, Dakota Access could \nnot construct the pipeline under the Lake.   \nC.  Litigation \n1.  Filing of Suit \nWhile factual backgrounds to lawsuits are often considerably more involved than the \nlitigation itself, that is not the case here.  In part, that is because this action (as well as the 2016 \nelection) generated significant further maneuvers.  To begin, two days after the release of the EA \non July 25, 2016, Standing Rock filed this suit against the Corps for declaratory and injunctive \nrelief pursuant to the National Historic Preservation Act, National Environmental Policy Act, \nClean Water Act, and the Rivers and Harbors Act.  See ECF No. 1 (Complaint), ¶¶ 128-212.  \nDakota Access successfully moved to intervene in support of the Corps on August 5, see ECF \nNo. 7, and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe intervened as a Plaintiff on August 10.  See ECF No. \n11.  Cheyenne River then filed its own Complaint, see ECF No. 11-12, which it later amended on \nSeptember 8.  See ECF No. 37.  Like Standing Rock’s Complaint, Cheyenne River’s pleadings \nstated claims under the NHPA, NEPA, CWA, and RHA, as well as for breach of trust \nresponsibility and violations of the Flood Control Act and the Administrative Procedure Act.  Id. \nat 38-56.   \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 12 of 91\n  The Tribes initially sought a preliminary injunction based solely on the NHPA, \ncontending principally that the clearing and grading of land along the pipeline route desecrated \nsites sacred to them.  On September 9, 2016, immediately after this Court issued its Opinion \ndenying that motion, see Standing Rock I, 205 F. Supp. 3d at 7, the Departments of Justice, the \nInterior, and the Army issued a joint statement explaining that, because “important issues raised \nby the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and other tribal nations and their members regarding the \nDakota Access pipeline” remained, “construction of the pipeline on Army Corps land bordering \nor under Lake Oahe [would] not go forward” until the Army could determine whether \nreconsideration of any of its previous decisions regarding the Lake Oahe crossing under NEPA \nor other federal laws was necessary.  See ECF No. 42-1 at 1.  More specifically, the Corps at that \ntime refused to grant the necessary MLA easement. \n2.  Further Consideration \n  In response to the opportunity for additional consideration, Standing Rock sent several \nletters to Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, Jo-Ellen Darcy, expressing its \nconcerns regarding DAPL, the EA’s spill-risk analysis, and the impact of a potential spill on \nhunting, fishing, and other Treaty rights.  See ECF Nos. 117-11 (Sept. 22, 2016), 117-12 (Oct. \n28, 2016), 117-13 (Oct. 3, 2016), 117-14 (Oct. 21, 2016).  It also submitted an expert review of \nthe EA, which concluded that it was “seriously deficient and [could not] support the finding of \nno significant impact, even with the proposed mitigations.”  ECF No. 117-15 (Accufacts, Inc. \nReview of EA, Oct. 28, 2016).   \n  As part of the Corps’ internal-review process, its Chief Counsel prepared a memorandum \nconcluding that the agency had “adequately considered and disclosed the environmental, cultural \nand other potential impacts of its actions and that its decisions were not arbitrary or capricious,” \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 13 of 91\nand that “supplementation of the EA to address any new information [was] not legally required.”  \nECF No. 117-24 (Memorandum from David Cooper, Chief Counsel, Corps, Oct. 20, 2016) \n(Cooper Memo) at 36.  He also issued a memorandum that listed 36 possible conditions to be \nincluded in an easement that would “provide further protection from any perceived risks posed \nby the pipeline crossing at Lake Oahe.”  ECF No. 209-3 at 55 (Memorandum from David \nCooper, Oct. 31, 2016).  \nOn November 14, 2016, Assistant Secretary Darcy wrote to Standing Rock and Dakota \nAccess to inform them that the Army had completed the review called for on September 9, \n“accounting for information it . . . received from the Tribes and the pipeline company since \nSeptember,” and had “concluded that its previous decisions comported with legal requirements.”  \nECF No. 56-1 (Letter from Jo-Ellen Darcy, Nov. 14, 2016).  Nonetheless, in light of the United \nStates’ history with the Great Sioux Nation, the importance of Lake Oahe to Standing Rock, the \ngovernment-to-government relationship with Standing Rock, and the mandates of the Mineral \nLeasing Act regarding public safety and the interests of those who rely on fish, wildlife, and \nbiotic resources in the general area of a requested right-of-way, see 33 U.S.C. §§ 185(g), \n(h)(2)(D), (k), “the Army determined that additional discussion with the Standing Rock Sioux \nTribe and analysis [were] warranted.”  Darcy Nov. 2016 Letter at 2.  The Army thus invited \nStanding Rock to engage in discussions concerning “[p]otential conditions in an easement for the \npipeline crossing” that would reduce spill risk “or otherwise enhance the protection of Lake \nOahe, the Tribe’s water supplies, and its treaty rights”; the impact of those conditions on spill \nrisk; “whether to grant an easement for the pipeline to cross Lake Oahe at the location currently \nproposed” given those conditions; and anything else “the Tribe believes is relevant to the \nproposed pipeline crossing or easement.”  Id.  Darcy also wrote to Frazier to inform him of the \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 14 of 91\nCorps’ decision and to express the Corps’ interest in “confer[ring] with [him] to better \nunderstand” his concerns.  See ECF No. 131-4, Attach. A (Letter from Jo-Ellen Darcy to Harold \nFrazier, Nov. 14, 2016); see also ECF No. 131-4 (Declaration of Harold Frazier, Feb. 22, 2017), \n¶ 15.  Two days later, Darcy and other Corps officials met with representatives of the Great \nPlains Tribal Chairpersons’ Association, including Frazier, to confirm that the November 14 \nletters “constituted an invitation to the [T]ribes to provide any new information . . . relevant to \nthe Corps’ consideration of the easement.”  Id., ¶ 16. \n  During this next review phase, Standing Rock offered further comments urging the Corps \nto deny the easement because of the pipeline’s potential harm to its water, hunting, fishing, and \ngathering rights.  See ECF No. 117-17 (Dec. 2, 2016).  The Oglala Sioux Tribe, which had \nbrought a related case against the Corps that has been consolidated with Standing Rock’s action, \nsee Minute Order of Mar. 16, 2017, submitted an expert report critiquing the EA’s spill-volume \nanalysis.  See ECF No. 117-18 (EarthFax Review of EA, Dec. 2, 2016).  The Corps’ Omaha \nDistrict Commander met with representatives of Standing Rock and Dakota Access to review the \nTribe’s concerns and discuss conditions that could be imposed on an easement to reduce the risk \nof spill or rupture.  See ECF No. 209-5 at 1-2 (Email from Scott Spellmon, Commanding \nGeneral, NW Division, Corps, to Jo-Ellen Darcy, Dec. 2, 2016).  The day after the meeting, the \nDistrict Commander issued a memorandum recommending that the Corps grant an easement to \nDakota Access to cross Lake Oahe.  See Henderson Memo.  \n  The Corps also used this review phase to solicit the opinion of the Department of the \nInterior “on the extent to which tribal treaty rights . . . weigh in favor of or against authorizations \nneeded for the Lake Oahe crossing.”  ECF No. 117-6 (Memorandum from Hilary C. Tompkins, \nSolicitor, Dep’t of Interior, Dec. 4, 2016) at 1.  Interior’s Solicitor accordingly supplied a \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 15 of 91\nmemorandum concluding that the Corps had “ample legal justification to decline to issue the \nproposed Lake Oahe easement on the current record,” and that it “would be equally justified in \nsuspending or revoking the existing Section 408 permit as it relates to the Lake Oahe crossing.”  \nId. at 4.  Alternatively, the Solicitor recommended that the Corps not make a decision to issue the \neasement prior to engaging in government-to-government consultation with the Tribe; preparing \nan EIS to “adequately evaluate[] the existence of and potential impacts to tribal rights and \ninterests,” “consider a broader range of alternative pipeline routes,” and undertake “a \ncatastrophic spill analysis prepared by an independent expert”; and more comprehensively \nassessing “DAPL’s impact on tribal rights, lands, and resources, including the socio-economic \nimpacts, . . . in light of the fact that the reservation is a permanent homeland for the Tribes, as \nwell as other federal obligations towards the Tribes.”  Id.   \n  On December 4, the same day the Interior Solicitor issued her Opinion, Assistant \nSecretary Darcy issued a memorandum to the Corps’ Commander.  She explained that, to date, \nthe Army had “not made a final decision on whether to grant the easement pursuant to [the \nMineral Leasing Act].”  ECF No. 172-7 (Memorandum from Jo-Ellen Darcy, Dec. 4, 2016), ¶ 6.  \nDespite the Omaha District Commander’s recommendation that the Corps do so, Darcy stated \nthat she had “concluded that a decision on whether to authorize the Dakota Access Pipeline to \ncross Lake Oahe at the proposed location merits additional analysis, more rigorous exploration \nand evaluation of reasonable siting alternatives, and greater public and tribal participation and \ncomments.”  Id., ¶ 12.  “Accordingly,” she continued, the Army would “not grant an easement to \ncross Lake Oahe at the proposed location based on the current record.”  Id.  She directed a \n“robust consideration of reasonable alternatives . . . , together with analysis of potential spill risk \nand impacts, and treaty rights,” which she thought would be “best accomplished . . . by preparing \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 16 of 91\nan Environmental Impact Statement.”  Id.  Darcy emphasized, though, that her “policy decision” \ndid “not alter the Army’s position that the Corps’ prior reviews and actions have comported with \nlegal requirements.”  Id., ¶ 15.   \nOn January 18, 2017, Darcy followed up by publishing in the Federal Register a notice of \nintent to prepare an EIS.  See 82 Fed. Reg. 5,543 (Jan. 18, 2017).  Cheyenne River sent a letter to \nher that same day requesting that the Corps include it as a Cooperating Agency in the preparation \nand drafting of the EIS given the potential for the pipeline to affect the Tribe and its Reservation.  \nSee ECF No. 131-4, Attach. B (Letter from Harold Frazier to Jo-Ellen Darcy, Jan. 18, 2017).   \n3.  A New Administration \nAs we all know, elections have consequences, and the government’s position on the \neasement shifted significantly once President Trump assumed office on January 20, 2017.  A \nPresidential Memorandum issued on January 24 directed the Secretary of the Army to instruct \nthe Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works and the Corps “to take all actions necessary \nand appropriate to . . . review and approve in an expedited manner, to the extent permitted by law \nand as warranted, and with such conditions as are necessary or appropriate, requests for \napprovals to construct and operate the DAPL, including easements or rights-of-way” and to \n“consider, to the extent permitted by law and as warranted, whether to rescind or modify” the \nDecember 4 memorandum and the Notice of Intent to Prepare an EIS.  See ECF No. 172-8, § 2.   \nThe Army completed a technical and legal review on February 3 and determined that the \nFinal EA and FONSI “satisf[ied] the NEPA requirements for evaluating the easement required \nfor the DAPL to cross Corps-managed federal lands at Lake Oahe” and “support[ed] a decision \nto grant an easement.”  ECF No. 172-9 (Memorandum from Todd Semonite, Lieutenant General, \nCorps, Feb. 3, 2017) at 10.  Based on a review of the entire record, including the input received \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 17 of 91\nsince September 2016, the Corps also concluded that the Final EA did not require further \nsupplementation, as there were no “substantial changes in the proposed action” or “new \nsignificant circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns.”  Id. at 11 (citing \n40 C.F.R. §§ 1502.9(c)(1)(i)-(ii)).  The Corps thus published in the Federal Register a notice of \ntermination of its intent to prepare an EIS, see ECF No. 95-3, provided notice to Congress of its \nintent to issue the easement, see ECF No. 172-10 (Congressional Notifications, Feb. 7, 2017), \nand did so on February 8.  See ECF No. 172-11 (Easement).  The final easement contains 36 \nconditions intended to mitigate the risk of rupture at Lake Oahe and otherwise address the \nTribe’s concerns.  Id. at 37-43.  To facilitate the Corps’ granting of the easement, the Acting \nSecretary of the Interior withdrew the Interior Solicitor’s December 4 Opinion.  See ECF No. \n127-15 (Memorandum from K. Jack Haugrud, Acting Secretary, Dep’t of Interior, Feb. 6, 2017).  \nHaving finally been given the green light, Dakota Access, by late March, completed construction \nof this last segment beneath Lake Oahe and began placing oil in the pipeline.  See ECF No. 191 \n(DA Status Report, Mar. 27, 2017).  DAPL became fully operational on June 1, 2017.  See \nEnergy Transfer, Energy Transfer Announces the Bakken Pipeline Is in Service Transporting \nDomestic Crude Oil from the Bakken/Three Forks Production Areas, June 1, 2017, \nhttp://ir.energytransfer.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=106094&p=irol-newsArticle. \nThe day after the Corps granted Dakota Access the easement, Cheyenne River moved for \nleave to file a Second Amended Complaint, see ECF No. 97, and also filed a motion for \npreliminary injunction and application for a temporary restraining order, both based solely on the \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act.  See ECF Nos. 98, 99; Standing Rock II, 2017 WL 908538, \nat *3.  Standing Rock joined the TRO application, but not the preliminary-injunction motion.  \nSee ECF No. 107.  In both filings, Cheyenne River argued that its members “believe that the \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 18 of 91\nmere existence of a crude oil pipeline under the waters of Lake Oahe will desecrate those waters \nand render them unsuitable for use in their religious sacraments,” and that DAPL “correlates \nwith a terrible Black Snake prophesied to come into the Lakota homeland and cause \ndestruction.”  Standing Rock II, 2017 WL 908538, at *3 (quoting ECF No. 98 at 2-3).  After \norally denying the TRO, see Minute Order of Feb. 13, 2017; ECF No. 119 (TRO Oral Arg. Tr., \nFeb. 13, 2017) at 29:20-30:19, the Court issued an Opinion similarly denying the preliminary-\ninjunction motion, as it concluded that the extraordinary relief requested was not appropriate in \nlight of the equitable doctrine of laches and Cheyenne River’s unlikelihood of success on the \nmerits.  Standing Rock II, 2017 WL 908538, at *1. \nIn the midst of these proceedings, Standing Rock — after moving for leave to amend its \nComplaint to address new developments since it first filed this case in July 2016, see ECF No. \n106 — filed the instant Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on claims concerning the Corps’ \ndecision not to prepare an EIS for the Lake Oahe crossing; its granting of the easement; and its \npermitting of the Lake Oahe crossing under NWP 12.  The Corps responded with its own Cross-\nMotion for Partial Summary Judgment on these causes of action, see ECF No. 172 (Corps SRST \nMSJ), and Dakota Access filed briefs opposing Standing Rock’s Motion and joining the Corps’ \nCross-Motion.  See ECF Nos. 159 (DA SRST Opp.), 184 (Notice of Joinder), 202-1 (DA SRST \nReply).  Cheyenne River joined Standing Rock’s Motion, see ECF No. 131 (CRST MSJ) at 8, \nand filed its own Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on claims concerning the Corps’ \ndecisions to grant Dakota Access a permit under Section 408 of the RHA and an easement under \nthe MLA.  The Corps and Dakota Access then cross-moved for partial summary judgment on \nthose claims as well.  See ECF No. 183 (Corps CRST MSJ); ECF No. 185 (DA CRST MSJ).  \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 19 of 91\nThese Motions are now ripe.  Although the Tribes do not raise exactly the same causes of \naction, because their Motions are closely related and sometimes overlap, the Court addresses \nboth in this Opinion, turning first to Standing Rock’s claims and then to Cheyenne River’s.  For \npurposes of their resolution, the Court has also today issued a Minute Order granting the Tribes’ \nmotions for leave to amend, such that the claims relating to post-July 2016 events are properly \nbefore it.  After setting out the governing legal standard, the Court first addresses the relevant \nclaims raised by Standing Rock, see Section III, infra, and then turns to those asserted by \nCheyenne River.  See Section IV, infra.  \nII.   Legal Standard \n \nThe parties have cross-moved for partial summary judgment on the administrative record.  \nThe summary-judgment standard set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c), therefore, \n“does not apply because of the limited role of a court in reviewing the administrative record.”  \nSierra Club v. Mainella, 459 F. Supp. 2d 76, 89 (D.D.C. 2006); see also Bloch v. Powell, 227 F. \nSupp. 2d 25, 30 (D.D.C. 2002), aff’d, 348 F.3d 1060 (D.C. Cir. 2003).  “[T]he function of the \ndistrict court is to determine whether or not as a matter of law the evidence in the administrative \nrecord permitted the agency to make the decision it did.”  Sierra Club, 459 F. Supp. 2d. at 90 \n(quotation marks and citation omitted).  “Summary judgment is the proper mechanism for \ndeciding, as a matter of law, whether an agency action is supported by the administrative record \nand consistent with the [Administrative Procedure Act] standard of review.”  Loma Linda Univ. \nMed. Ctr. v. Sebelius, 684 F. Supp. 2d 42, 52 (D.D.C. 2010) (citation omitted), aff’d, 408 Fed. \nApp’x 383 (D.C. Cir. 2010).   \nThe Administrative Procedure Act “sets forth the full extent of judicial authority to \nreview executive agency action for procedural correctness.”  FCC v. Fox Television Stations, \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 20 of 91\nInc., 556 U.S. 502, 513 (2009).  It requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \nfindings, and conclusions” that are “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not \nin accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  Agency action is arbitrary and capricious if, for \nexample, the agency “entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an \nexplanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so \nimplausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency \nexpertise.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins., 463 U.S. 29, \n43 (1983).   \nThis is a “narrow” standard of review, under which “a court is not to substitute its \njudgment for that of the agency.”  Id.  Rather, the Court “will defer to the [agency’s] \ninterpretation of what [a statute] requires so long as it is ‘rational and supported by the record.’”  \nOceana, Inc. v. Locke, 670 F.3d 1238, 1240 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (quoting C & W Fishing Co. v. \nFox, 931 F.2d 1556, 1562 (D.C. Cir. 1991)).  In other words, an agency is required to “examine \nthe relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational \nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.”  State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43 (quoting \nBurlington Truck Lines v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  Courts, accordingly, “do \nnot defer to the agency’s conclusory or unsupported suppositions,” United Techs. Corp. v. Dep’t \nof Def., 601 F.3d 557, 562 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (quoting McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Dep’t of the \nAir Force, 375 F.3d 1182, 1187 (D.C. Cir. 2004)), and “agency ‘litigating positions’ are not \nentitled to deference when they are merely [agency] counsel’s ‘post hoc rationalizations’ for \nagency action, advanced for the first time in the reviewing court.”  Martin v. Occupational Safety \n& Health Review Comm’n, 499 U.S. 144, 156 (1991).  Although a reviewing court “may not \nsupply a reasoned basis for the agency’s action that the agency itself has not given,” a decision \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 21 of 91\nthat is not fully explained may, nevertheless, be upheld “if the agency’s path may reasonably be \ndiscerned.”  Bowman Transp., Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., 419 U.S. 281, 285-86 \n(1974) (citation omitted).   \nIII.   Analysis of Standing Rock’s Claims \n \n  As earlier noted, Standing Rock seeks summary judgment on three claims: (1) The \nCorps’ July 25, 2016, and February 8, 2017, conclusions that the Oahe crossing did not warrant \nan EIS violated NEPA because the agency did not make a convincing case that no significant \nimpacts would result and failed to take a hard look at the project’s effects on Treaty rights and \nenvironmental-justice considerations; (2) The Corps’ February 8, 2017, decision to grant the \neasement was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law because the Corps reversed a prior policy \nwithout reasoned justification and because the decision constituted a breach of trust \nresponsibilities; and (3) The Corps wrongfully concluded on July 25, 2016, that the pipeline \nactivities satisfied the terms and conditions of NWP 12.  The Court addresses each in turn.  \nA.  Decision Not to Prepare EIS    \n  In reviewing an agency’s decision not to issue an EIS, the Court’s role is a “‘limited’ one, \ndesigned primarily to ensure ‘that no arguably significant consequences have been ignored.’”  \nTOMAC, Taxpayers of Michigan Against Casinos v. Norton, 433 F.3d 852, 860 (D.C. Cir. 2006) \n(quoting Pub. Citizen v. Nat’l Highway Traffic Safety Admin., 848 F.2d 256, 267 (D.C. Cir. \n1988)).  An agency’s decision to issue a FONSI and thus not to prepare an EIS will be \noverturned only “if the decision was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.”  Sierra Club \nv. Peterson, 717 F.2d 1409, 1413 (D.C. Cir. 1983). \n  When examining the adequacy of the FONSI and the EA upon which it was based, courts \nmust determine whether the agency:  \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 22 of 91\n(1) has accurately identified the relevant environmental concern, (2) \nhas taken a hard look at the problem in preparing its [FONSI or \nEnvironmental Assessment], (3) is able to make a convincing case \nfor its finding of no significant impact, and (4) has shown that even \nif there is an impact of true significance, an EIS is unnecessary \nbecause changes or safeguards in the project sufficiently reduce the \nimpact to a minimum.  \n \nSierra Club v. Van Antwerp, 661 F.3d 1147, 1154 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (quoting TOMAC, 433 F.3d \nat 861) (internal quotation marks omitted).  In so doing, courts in this circuit apply “a rule of \nreason to an agency’s NEPA analysis” and decline to “‘flyspeck’ the agency’s findings in search \nof ‘any deficiency no matter how minor.’”  Myersville Citizens for a Rural Cmty., Inc. v. FERC, \n783 F.3d 1301, 1322–23 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (quoting Nevada v. Dep’t of Energy, 457 F.3d 78, 93 \n(D.C. Cir. 2006)).  \nStanding Rock contends that the EA for DAPL “runs afoul of these standards.”  SRST \nMSJ at 19.  In particular, the Tribe argues that the Corps did not take a hard look at or make a \nconvincing case that the Lake Oahe crossing will have no significant environmental impact, and \nthat it did not sufficiently consider route alternatives or environmental-justice implications.  Id. \nat 19-31.  For these reasons, it asserts that “[t]he Corps’ conclusion that the Oahe crossing was \nnot significant enough to warrant an EIS is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.”  SRST \nMSJ at 17; see Nevada, 457 F.3d at 87 (“[Courts] apply the APA’s arbitrary and capricious \nstandard to a NEPA challenge.”).  The Court begins its analysis with environmental impact and \nthen turns to alternatives and environmental justice.  \n1.  Hard Look / Convincing Case \n  Pursuant to NEPA’s “hard look” requirement, the agency must ensure that “the adverse \nenvironmental effects of the proposed action are adequately identified and evaluated.”  \nRobertson, 490 U.S. at 350.  In evaluating the significance of a proposed action’s impact, an \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 23 of 91\nagency is to consider, inter alia, the effect on “public health or safety”; “[u]nique characteristics \nof the geographic area such as proximity to historic or cultural resources”; the extent to which \nthe environmental effects “are likely to be highly controversial” or “are highly uncertain or \ninvolve unique or unknown risks”; “[w]hether the action is related to other actions with \nindividually insignificant but cumulatively significant impacts”; and the degree to which the \naction “may cause loss or destruction of significant . . . cultural[] or historical resources.”  40 \nC.F.R. § 1508.27.   \nThe Tribe identifies several ways in which the Corps allegedly failed to take a hard look \nat the environmental consequences of permitting DAPL’s construction and operation and to \nmake a convincing case of no significant impact.  It principally argues that the agency did not \nproperly assess the risk of a spill under Lake Oahe or sufficiently consider the environmental \nimpacts on Treaty rights of the construction of the pipeline or of a spill.  Before proceeding to \naddress each of the Tribe’s points, however, the Court must dispense with a threshold issue.   \na.  Extent of Record \nTo substantiate many of its critiques of the EA’s analysis, the Tribe relies on expert \nreports and other records dated after July 25, 2016, when the Final EA and Mitigated FONSI \nwere published.  Dakota Access argues that the Court should not consider these reports or any \nevidence from the Tribe that post-dates July 25. \n“It is a widely accepted principle of administrative law that the courts base their review \nof an agency’s actions on the materials that were before the agency at the time its decision was \nmade.”  IMS, P.C. v. Alvarez, 129 F.3d 618, 623 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (listing cases).  Here, in \nchallenging the Corps’ decision not to prepare an EIS, the Tribe in effect challenges \nauthorizations made at two different times: the RHA Section 408 authorization and NWP 12 \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 24 of 91\nverification on July 25, 2016, and the easement approval on February 8, 2017.  See ECF No. \n196-1 (SRST Reply) at 3.  The Section 408 and NWP 12 decisions were based on the conclusion \nset out in the EA and FONSI that the permissions would not have a significant impact on the \nenvironment, and the easement decision was also based on “additional review, analysis of terms \nand conditions for the easement, and on the Corps’ decision that supplementation of the \nEA/FONSI was not required.”  Corps SRST MSJ at 10.  The Corps thus decided at two junctures \nthat an EIS was not required, and it prepared an administrative record encompassing the \nmaterials that were before it at each decision date.  Although Dakota Access is technically \ncorrect that the expert reports and other evidence submitted after July 25, 2016, are outside the \nrecord for the RHA Section 408 and NWP 12 decisions, that offers them little aid.  This is \nbecause the Court can review the materials before the Corps as of February 8, 2017, for purposes \nof evaluating the decision to grant the easement absent an EIS.  The Court, consequently, will \nconsider all materials dated up to February 8. \nTo complicate matters further, however, the Tribe wishes the Court to also review “some \nuncontroversial background materials (e.g., maps) and declarations from its expert” that post-\ndate February 8.  See SRST Reply at 3.  It argues that such extra-record evidence comes within \nthe “accepted exceptions to the principle that the court cannot consider information that falls \noutside the agency record” — namely, where “the agency failed to examine all relevant factors \nor to adequately explain its grounds for decision, or . . . acted in bad faith or engaged in improper \nbehavior in reaching its decision.”  IMS, 129 F.3d at 624; SRST Reply at 3.   \nOn this point, the Tribe first contends that the Corps engaged in improper behavior by \nwithholding confidential spill-model discussions and geographic-response plans to which its \npost-easement expert declarations respond.  See SRST Reply at 3-4.  But the showing required \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 25 of 91\n“to justify supplementing the record” is a “‘strong’” one, IMS, 129 F.3d at 624 (quoting Citizens \nto Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 420 (1971)), and the Court does not find that \nthe Tribe has made it here.  The Corps has explained that it withheld from the Tribe and the \npublic a small number of documents supporting the EA “[b]ecause of security concerns and \nsensitivities.”  Dec. 4 Memo, ¶ 5.  Indeed, the Court recently concluded that there was good \ncause to protect from public disclosure certain information in some spill-model reports that, if \nreleased, could endanger life or physical safety.  Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps \nof Eng’rs (Standing Rock III), No. 16-1534, 2017 WL 1316918, at *5-6 (D.D.C. Apr. 7, 2017).  \nAbsent a showing to the contrary, the Court thus cannot permit supplementation of the record on \nthe ground of some withholding impropriety.   \nThe Tribe next argues that its extra-record evidence describes how the Corps failed to \nexamine all relevant factors and provide adequate grounds for its decision.  But “[t]his is not a \ncase where the agency failed ‘to explain administrative action [so] as to frustrate effective \njudicial review.’”  IMS, 129 F.3d at 624 (quoting Camp v. Pitts, 411 U.S. 138, 142-43 (1973)).  \nThe EA addressed each factor for which the Tribe marshals extra-record evidence, even if not \nwith the depth or ultimate conclusion the Tribe would prefer.  Compare SRST MSJ at 21 \n(criticizing Corps’ failure to address “slow leaks in the HDD bore,” which, based on Tribe-\ncommissioned expert review, would be “‘complicated if not impossible to clean up and likely \nwould have significant impacts on soils’ and underlying aquifers”) (quoting ECF No. 117-23 \n(Envy Report, Jan. 5, 2017) at 14); SRST Reply at 11 (“Landslides are a major source of pipeline \nfailures and a critical factor in route selection.”) (citing ECF No. 195-4 (Corrective Action \nOrder, Belle Fourche Pipeline Company, Dec. 20, 2016); Accufacts, Inc. Review at 3; ECF No. \n120 (Sealed Declaration of Richard Kuprewicz, Feb. 12, 2017), ¶ 21); id. at 12 (describing EA’s \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 26 of 91\nfailure to acknowledge “undisputed evidence” regarding failure rates of spill-detection systems) \n(citing ECF No. 209-5 at 110 (Letter from Sierra Club Indigenous Environmental Network, Oct. \n10, 2016); Accufacts, Inc.

Pritzker, \n126 F. Supp. 3d 110, 113 (D.D.C. 2015) (quoting Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership \nv. Salazar, 616 F.3d 497, 514 (D.C. Cir. 2010)).  As it proceeds through Standing Rock’s \narguments regarding the deficiencies in the EA’s analysis, therefore, the Court will not engage \nwith those contentions that turn on evidence that post-dates February 8, 2017.  This procedural \nbrush now cleared away, the Court tackles the substance of the Tribe’s no-convincing-case \nposition, beginning with spill risks and continuing to Treaty rights. \nb.  Spill-Risk Analysis \nAlthough grouped under the “spill-risk” heading, Standing Rock’s challenges here \nencompass the risk of spills, the degree of scientific controversy, and the cumulative risk of the \nproject, each of which is analyzed separately. \ni.  Risk of Spill \nStanding Rock first maintains that the EA understates and does not properly assess the \nrisk of an oil spill under Lake Oahe.  See SRST MSJ at 21 (“[T]he Corps falls back on a rote \nmantra that the risk of oil spills is low.”); id. at 22 (citing Solicitor Op. at 28-29 & n.171 (noting \nPHMSA data shows average of over 283 significant incidents involving gas, oil, or other \npipelines per year since 1996)).  It argues that, although the EA repeats that the spill risk is “very \nlow,” “unlikely,” or “negligible,” see, e.g., EA at 48, 63, 87, it does not explain what “low” \nmeans.  See SRST Reply at 9.  And “to conduct a credible assessment of spill risks,” the Corps \nshould have addressed concerns relating to landslide risks, inadequate spill-detection systems, \nunderground leaks, response times, spill volumes, water-quality analysis, and winter conditions, \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 28 of 91\nid. at 11-14, and looked at portions of the pipeline entering and exiting the boreholes.  Id. at 15-\n16. \nThe EA, in fact, devotes several pages to discussing DAPL’s “reliability and safety.”  EA \nat 88-94.  The relevant section first explains that, “[t]o prevent pipeline failures resulting in \ninadvertent releases,” DAPL will be constructed and maintained in accordance with “industry \nand governmental requirements and standards,” including those from PHMSA, the American \nSociety of Mechanical Engineers, the National Association for Corrosion Engineers, and the \nAmerican Petroleum Industry.  Id. at 88.  After its installation, the pipeline will undergo \n“hydrostatic pressure testing at the crossings, checking coating integrity, and X-ray inspection of \nthe welds.”  Id.  The pipeline right-of-ways will also “be patrolled and inspected by air . . . at \nleast every three weeks and not less than 26 times per year[] to check for abnormal conditions or \ndangerous activities, such as unauthorized excavation along the pipeline route.”  Id.  In addition, \nDakota Access plans to use “a supervisory control and data acquisition . . . system to provide \nconstant remote oversight of the pipeline facilities,” including the detection of “rapid drops in \npressure,” and pipeline-monitoring software to identify any leaks by tracking “pipeline pressure, \nflow, and temperature data” pulled every six seconds.  Id. at 89-90.  The EA reports that such a \nsystem “is capable of detecting leaks down to 1 percent or better of the pipeline flow rate within \na time span of approximately 1 hour or less and capable of providing rupture detection within 1 \nto 3 minutes.”  Id. at 90.  If a leak is detected, remotely operated valves are to be triggered and \nclosed within three minutes.  Id.   \nOther courts, including this Circuit, have favorably viewed similar agency reliance on \napplicable regulatory standards when assessing impacts as part of a NEPA-required analysis.  \nSee, e.g., EarthReports, Inc. v. FERC, 828 F.3d 949, 957 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (holding agency \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 29 of 91\nfulfilled its NEPA obligations to evaluate ballast-water impacts by, inter alia, noting \nrequirements of applicable regulatory agencies); Sierra Club v. Clinton, 746 F. Supp. 2d 1025, \n1047 (D. Minn. 2010) (holding agency properly considered impacts of pipeline abandonment by \nreferencing PHMSA regulations). \nThe EA then proceeds to review the basis for its conclusion that the risk of an oil spill is \n“low.”  EA at 92.  Specifically, that conclusion comes from a risk analysis conducted by Dakota \nAccess that was derived from criteria set out in “the W. Kent Muhlbauer Relative Index \nMethodology (2004), in accordance with 49 CFR 195.452 ‘Hazardous Liquid Pipelines in High \nConsequence Area’, API RP 1160 ‘Managing System Integrity for Hazardous Liquid Pipelines’, \nand ASME B31.8S ‘Managing System Integrity of Gas Pipelines.’”  Id.  That analysis \n“addressed nine industry-recognized pipeline integrity threat categories”: (1) third-party damage; \n(2) external corrosion; (3) internal corrosion; (4) pipe-manufacturing defects; (5) construction-\nrelated defects; (6) incorrect operations; (7) equipment failure; (8) stress-corrosion cracking; and \n(9) natural forces.  Id. at 92-94.   \nThe underlying analysis is not itself in the record, see SRST Reply at 8, but the EA \nsummarizes its conclusions as to each of the nine factors.  Although no explanation is provided, \nthree of the nine factors — external corrosion, internal corrosion, and construction-related \ndefects — are assessed only as to the crossing at Lake Sakakawea; the other six are applied to \nboth Sakakawea and Oahe.  See EA at 92-94.  The EA’s explanation of its choice of \nmethodology and subsequent treatment of the different factors is nonetheless enough to give \nsubstance to the Corps’ conclusion that the risk of a spill is low.  See Sierra Club v. Watkins, 808 \nF. Supp. 852, 868 (D.D.C. 1991) (explaining courts should “defer to an agency’s decision to use \na particular risk assessment methodology that is consistent with general principles of science”) \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 30 of 91\n(citing Sierra Club v. Dep’t of Transp., 753 F.2d 120, 128-29 (D.C. Cir. 1985)).  For example, \nthe EA explains that, at the Oahe crossing, spill risk due to third-party damage is low because the \npipeline is positioned 92 feet below the lakebed; spill risk from manufacturing defects is also \nslim because the pipeline will be “hydrostatically strength-tested”; and spill risk from “incorrect \noperations (e.g., overpressure event caused by human error)” is low because the pipeline is \ndesigned to withstand twice the maximum-allowable operating pressure.  See EA at 92-94.  The \nEA thus does not simply use “[a]n unbounded term” that “provides no objective standard for \ndetermining what kind of differential makes one impact more or less significant than another.”  \nMainella, 459 F. Supp. 2d at 101.  Admittedly, the EA does not quantify the risk of a spill with \nexact numerical precision.  But in setting out the specific factors that undergirded its risk analysis \nand explaining their application to DAPL, the EA reasonably gives the necessary content to its \ntop-line conclusion that the risk of a spill is low.  \nAs noted above in the discussion of extra-record evidence, moreover, the EA did not omit \ndiscussion of borehole leaks (EA at 19, 36); landslides (EA at 26-28); leak-detection systems \n(EA at 42, 46, 90-91); water quality (EA at 36-49); or winter temperatures (EA at 39, 43, 123).  \nTo the extent the Tribes’ experts disagree with the Corps’ technical assessments or overall \nconclusion, such disagreements are “a classic example of a factual dispute the resolution of \nwhich implicates substantial agency expertise.”  Wisc. Valley Improvement Co. v. FERC, 236 \nF.3d 738, 746 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (quoting Marsh, 490 U.S. at 376).  In such situations, courts \n“must defer to ‘the informed discretion of the responsible federal agencies.’”  Id. at 747 (quoting \nMarsh, 490 U.S. at 377); see also Nat’l Comm. for the New River v. FERC, 373 F.3d 1323, 1327 \n(D.C. Cir. 2004) (“When an agency ‘is evaluating scientific data within its technical expertise,’ \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 31 of 91\nan ‘extreme degree of deference to the agency’ is warranted.”) (quoting B&J Oil & Gas v. \nFERC, 353 F.3d 71, 76 (D.C. Cir. 2004)).  \nii.  Highly Controversial \nAlthough the Court cannot agree with Standing Rock that the Corps did not adequately \nconsider or explain its conclusion that the risk of an oil spill is low, a related position gains more \ntraction.  As explained above, CEQ regulations provide that one factor that “should be \nconsidered” in evaluating the significance of a proposed action’s impact is “[t]he degree to which \nthe effects on the quality of the human environment are likely to be highly controversial.”  40 \nC.F.R. § 1508.27(b)(4).  Standing Rock argues that evidence in the record indicated that the \npipeline’s effects were highly controversial, and that the Corps therefore should have concluded \nthat the project would have significant impacts on the environment.  See SRST MSJ at 20-21. \nSuch controversy is not measured by newsworthiness; instead, according to the Court of \nAppeals, “The term ‘controversial’ refers to cases where a substantial dispute exists as to the \nsize, nature, or effect of the major federal action rather than to the existence of opposition to a \nuse.”  Town of Cave Creek, Arizona v. FAA, 325 F.3d 320, 331 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (quoting \nFound. for N. Am. Wild Sheep v. Dep’t of Agric., 681 F.2d 1172, 1182 (9th Cir. 1982)).  Despite \nthat explanation, however, as other courts in this district have observed, “Just what constitutes \nthe type of ‘controversy’ that requires a full EIS is not entirely clear.”  Nat’l Parks Conservation \nAss’n v. United States, 177 F. Supp. 3d 1, 33 (D.D.C. 2016) (quoting Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n v. \nNorton, 332 F. Supp. 2d 170, 184 (D.D.C. 2004)).  At a minimum, “something more is required \nbesides the fact that some people may be highly agitated and be willing to go to court over the \nmatter.”  Id. (quoting Fund for Animals v. Frizzell, 530 F.2d 982, 988 n.15 (D.C. Cir. 1975)).  \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 32 of 91\n“Many courts have found ‘something more’ to be scientific or other evidence that reveals \nflaws in the methods or data relied upon by the agency in reaching its conclusions.”  Id. (citing \nNat’l Parks & Conservation Assoc. v. Babbitt, 241 F.3d 722, 736-37 (9th Cir. 2001) (holding \nagency action was highly controversial because “comments urg[ing] that the EA’s analysis was \nincomplete, and the mitigation uncertain, . . . cast substantial doubt on the adequacy of the Parks \nService’s methodology and data,” and thus the dispute went “beyond a disagreement of qualified \nexperts over the ‘reasoned conclusions’ as to what the data reveal[ed]”); Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, \n332 F. Supp. 2d at 185 (“Such a controversy exists where the Corps is presented with scientific \nevidence specifically evaluating the environmental effects of the proposed project or calling into \nquestion the adequacy of the EA.”); Fund for Animals v. Norton, 281 F. Supp. 2d 209, 235 \n(D.D.C. 2003) (“While plaintiffs have identified serious gaps in defendants’ assessment of the \nlocal effects of the proposed action, they do not appear to have identified any scientific \ncontroversy per se as to the extent of the effects.”); Sierra Club v. Van Antwerp, 719 F. Supp. 2d \n58, 67-68 (D.D.C. 2010) (“While declarations were submitted to the Corps from numerous \nexperts who claimed that [the development project] will have significant adverse impacts on \nCypress Creek and its wetlands, these declarations alone fail to rise to the level of ‘controversy’ \nunder NEPA.”), aff’d in part, rev’d in part on other grounds, 661 F.3d 1147 (D.C. Cir. 2011), as \namended (Jan. 30, 2012)); but cf. Humane Soc. of U.S. v. Dep’t of Commerce, 432 F. Supp. 2d \n4, 19–20 (D.D.C. 2006) (finding agencies’ decision not to prepare EIS highly controversial based \non comments from plaintiff and other agencies indicating disagreement with agencies’ \nconclusions).  \nHere, as evidence of controversy, Standing Rock refers only generally to “the multiple \ncritiques of the Corps’ unexamined conclusions, expert evidence indicating greater risks, and \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 33 of 91\ncritical comment from other federal agencies.”  SRST MSJ at 20-21.  The Tribe does not help the \nCourt to evaluate its argument by, for example, following these general references with specific \nstatements made by the Tribe, agencies, or experts critiquing the Corps’ methodology or data.  In \nany event, based on its review of the record, the Court first concludes that none of the evidence \nbefore the Corps as of July 25, 2016 — including Standing Rock’s comments, see ECF No. 159-\n1, Exh. C (SRST Comments on Draft EA, Jan. 8, 2016); id., Exh. D (SRST Suppl. Comments on \nDraft EA, Mar. 24, 2016); ECF No. 209-6 at 51 (Notes for Feb. 18-19, 2016, Tribal Meeting); \nECF No. 209-9 at 33 (Letter from Waste Win Young to Martha Chieply, Feb. 25, 2015), and \nsubmissions from the EPA and the Department of the Interior, see ECF No. 209-7 at 21 (Letter \nfrom Lawrence Roberts to Brent Cossette, Mar. 29, 2016), ECF No. 209-16 at 184 (Letter from \nPhilip Strobel to Brent Cossette, Jan. 8, 2016), ECF No. 209-8 at 123 (Letter from Philip Strobel \nto Brent Cossette, Mar. 11, 2016), ECF No. 209-9 at 209 (Email “Quick Summary of Conference \nCall with EPA,” Feb. 25, 2016) — suggested substantial methodological or data flaws in the \nCorps’ analysis.  \nThe expert reports submitted to the Corps after the Final EA was published but before the \nCorps again decided in February 2017 that an EIS was not required, see Semonite Memo at 14, \nhowever, do present such scientific critiques.  See, e.g., EarthFax Report at 1-3 (critiquing EA \nfor considering spill volumes from pipelines generally, rather than from pipelines with 16-inch or \nlarger diameters, like DAPL); id. at 4 (suggesting EA used incorrect river-flow rates to assess \nspill impacts); id. at 5-7 (explaining EA used inappropriate benzene-concentration limits); id. at \n9 (arguing EA should have included quantitative analysis of risk of failure of system \ncomponents); id. at 9 (contending EA wrongly relied upon premise that emergency block valves \nwould close immediately upon leak detection); Accufacts, Inc. Review at 7 (stating corrosion \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 34 of 91\nthreats should be assessed based on field readings of in-line inspection runs, not assumed rates); \nid. at 9-10 (arguing that complete risk analysis required, inter alia, consideration of pipeline \nelevation profile, maximum operating pressure, location of mainline valves, location and type of \n“critical leak detection monitoring devices by milepost”).   \nIt may well be the case that the Corps reasonably concluded that these expert reports \nwere flawed or unreliable and thus did not actually create any substantial evidence of \ncontroversial effects.  Dakota Access, for example, offers a scathing assessment of the reports’ \n“material flaws.”  DA SRST Opp. at 21 n.4.  But the Corps never said as much.  Its February 3, \n2017, memo determining that the Final EA and FONSI satisfied NEPA’s requirements and \nsupported the decision to grant the easement is devoid of any discussion of the methodological \nand data flaws identified in the reports.  Indeed, it acknowledges receiving only Standing Rock’s \nAccufacts, Inc. Review and wholly ignores the others.  See Semonite Memo at 12.  As the \nagency did not demonstrate that it considered, as the CEQ regulations require, the degree to \nwhich the project’s effects are likely to be highly controversial, despite being presented with \nevidence of scientific flaws, the Court cannot conclude that the Corps made a convincing case of \nno significant impact or took the requisite hard look.  The remedy for such violation is discussed \nin Section III.D, infra.  \niii. Cumulative Risk \nFinally, the Tribe contends that the EA “fails to consider the cumulative risk imposed by \nthe pipeline.”  SRST MSJ at 22 (citing 40 C.F.R. § 1508.27(b)(7) (“Significance exists if it is \nreasonable to anticipate a cumulatively significant impact on the environment.”)).  “Cumulative \nimpact is the impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action \nwhen added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 35 of 91\nagency (Federal or non-Federal) or person undertakes such other actions.”  40 C.F.R. § 1508.7.    \nSuch impacts “can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place \nover a period of time.”  Id.  Other pipelines cross under the Missouri River, but, the Tribe states, \nthe EA does not analyze how the addition of DAPL compounds the overall risk of a pipeline spill \nin the Missouri River, nor does it consider “the cumulative risk to Tribal resources from the rest \nof the pipeline outside Lake Oahe.”  SRST MSJ at 23; see also id. at 23 n.12 (criticizing Corps \nfor “unlawfully segmenting its NEPA review of one pipeline into [three] separate components”).  \nThis argument, like the Tribe’s first in this subsection, does not succeed. \nThe EA devotes eleven pages to a discussion of cumulative impacts on eleven types of \nresources, including geology and soils, water and aquatic life, agriculture, land use, cultural and \nhistoric resources, and environmental justice.  See EA at 98-107.  It acknowledges at the outset \nthat in the vicinity of the Oahe crossing are “oil and gas development and associated \ninfrastructure, utility installation, and agriculture,” and that the pipeline at the Oahe crossing is \nco-located with “a natural gas pipeline and a 345 kV power line.”  EA at 98.  Although the EA \ndoes not expressly state whether the presence of other pipelines increases the risk that DAPL (or \nthose pipelines) will rupture, it acknowledges the potential for unanticipated releases and refers \nback to the analysis of minimization and remediation activities to conclude that the potential \ncumulative impacts on water and aquatic resources from spills “would be minor.”  Id. at 101.  It \nalso considers the benefits of co-location, such as minimized land-use disturbance from \nconstruction.  Id. at 105.  The EA therefore does not simply conclude absent any actual analysis \nthat cumulative impacts would be minimal; on the contrary, there is enough to “allow the Court \nto review the agency’s finding.”  Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 109 F. \nSupp. 2d 30, 42 (D.D.C. 2000).   \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 36 of 91\nThe Corps, moreover, was not required to consider the impacts from the whole pipeline.  \nSee Sierra Club v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 803 F.3d 31, 34 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (holding that \nwhere federal easement and CWA permitting encompassed only five percent of pipeline’s \nlength, “the federal government was not required to conduct NEPA analysis of the entirety of the \n. . . pipeline, including portions not subject to federal control or permitting”); Sierra Club v. \nBostick, 787 F.3d 1043, 1051-54 (10th Cir. 2015) (holding Corps was not required to prepare \nNEPA analysis of entire pipeline when verifying NWPs for 485-mile oil pipeline crossing over \n2,000 waterways); Winnebago Tribe of Neb. v. Ray, 621 F.2d 269, 272-73 (8th Cir. 1980) (same \nfor electric utility line).  That it did not address the cumulative risk from the entire pipeline thus \ndoes not run afoul of NEPA.  \nc.  Impacts Analysis Re: Treaty Rights \nIn addition to challenging the EA’s analysis of the risk of a spill, Standing Rock raises \nconcerns about its discussion of the effects of the project, including a potential spill, should one \noccur, on the Tribe’s Treaty rights.  According to Standing Rock, “NEPA requires the Army \nCorps to disclose and assess the suite of risks from the Lake Oahe crossing to the full range of \nthe Tribe’s Treaty rights, in the context of the Corps’ heightened trust responsibilities.”  SRST \nMSJ at 24.  Here, the relevant Treaty rights are those implicating water, hunting, and fishing.  Id. \nat 25; Corps SRST MSJ at 20; see also Winters v. United States, 207 U.S. 564, 576-78 (1980) \n(holding that when federal government creates an Indian reservation, it impliedly reserves \notherwise unappropriated water to extent necessary to accomplish purposes of reservation); Fort \nLaramie Treaty of 1851, art. 55, 11 Stat. 749, 1851 WL 7655 (reserving for the Sioux tribes “the \nprivilege of hunting, fishing, or passing over” lands described in Treaty); United States v. Dion, \n476 U.S. 734, 738 (1986) (“As a general rule, Indians enjoy exclusive treaty rights to hunt and \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 37 of 91\nfish on lands reserved to them, unless such rights were clearly relinquished by treaty or have \nbeen modified by Congress.”).  The Court first explains the manner of the Corps’ analysis of \nthese rights and then turns separately to the effect of construction and the impact of a spill on \nsuch rights.  \ni.  Manner of Analysis \nBefore turning to whether the Corps adequately considered these impacts, the Court \ndiscusses how it was required to do so.  The Tribe contends that the Corps had to address these \nTreaty rights qua Treaty Rights, see SRST MSJ at 25-26; SRST Reply at 23-24, whereas the \nCorps asserts that it needed only to consider the effects on the resources implicated by the Treaty \nrights — i.e., water, fish, and game.  See Corps SRST MSJ at 20-21 & n.9.  To explain more \nfully, Standing Rock believes that the Corps’ position “misunderstands the Tribe’s Treaty \nrights,” which “embody the fundamental rights of a people tied to a place since time \nimmemorial” and thus demand a more “existential” analysis.  See SRST Reply at 23-24.  For \nexample, the Tribe explains that, although “[e]cological impacts to fish and game habitat and \npopulations present one dimension” of the impacts of an oil spill on aquatic resources, “[t]he \nimpact to Tribal members of losing the right to fish and hunt, which provides both much-needed \nsubsistence food to people facing extensive poverty as well as a connection to cultural practices \nthat Tribal members have engaged in since time immemorial, is a separate issue.”  Id.   \nStanding Rock may be right that the construction and operation of DAPL under Lake \nOahe could affect its members in the broad and existential ways it details, but it offers no case \nlaw, statutory provisions, regulations, or other authority to support its position that NEPA \nrequires such a sweeping analysis.  The Corps, conversely, points to several cases in which \ncourts have approved an approach consistent with its view of its NEPA obligations — i.e., an \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 38 of 91\nagency may assess impacts on treaty rights by analyzing the effects on a specific resource \nidentified in the treaty.  See Ground Zero Ctr. for Nonviolent Action v. Dep’t of the Navy, 918 F. \nSupp. 2d 1132, 1152 (W.D. Wash. 2013), on reconsideration in part No. 12-1455, 2013 WL \n357509 (W.D. Wash. Jan. 29, 2013) (assessing impact on tribe’s treaty fishing rights by \nconsidering surveys of fish patterns and Navy’s mitigation efforts); Nw. Sea Farms, Inc. v. U.S. \nArmy Corps of Eng’rs, 931 F. Supp. 1515, 1521-22 (W.D. Wash. 1996) (explaining Corps correctly \nconcluded that project would impair treaty fishing rights by considering impact on tribe’s access to \nfish); No Oilport! v. Carter, 520 F. Supp. 334, 356–57 (W.D. Wash. 1981) (concluding EIS’s \ndiscussion of effect of pipeline rupture on “the fish resource,” including via maps, adequately \nevaluated project’s impact on tribe’s treaty fishing rights).  Absent any controlling or persuasive \nauthority to the contrary, the Court sees no basis on which to conclude that NEPA demands the type \nof existential-scope analysis the Tribe advocates.  Rather, it is sufficient that the agency adequately \nanalyze impacts on the resource covered by a given treaty.  \nThe next question, then, is whether the agency’s weighing of those relevant Treaty rights here \n— viz., water, fishing, and hunting — was adequate.  The Court approaches that question by looking \nat the Corps’ assessment of the impacts on the different Treaty rights from (1) the construction of the \npipeline, and (2) an unanticipated oil spill.  In so doing, the Court keeps in mind the definition of \n“hard look” recently articulated by the D.C. Circuit: “[A]n agency has taken a ‘hard look’ at the \nenvironmental impacts of a proposed action if the statement contains sufficient discussion of the \nrelevant issues and opposing viewpoints, and the agency’s decision is fully informed and well-\nconsidered.”  Myersville Citizens for a Rural Community, Inc. v. FERC, 783 F.3d 1301, 1324-25 \n(D.C. Cir. 2015). \n \n \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 39 of 91\nii.  Construction \nThe EA discussed in several places the potential impact of DAPL’s construction on water \nresources, fish, and wildlife at Lake Oahe.  See EA at 36 (acknowledging that, during HDD-\nconstruction phase, drilling fluid could inadvertently be released “directly or indirectly into the \nwaterbody” and discussing mitigation measures); id. at 37 (explaining water required for HDD \nconstruction and hydrostatic testing at Oahe crossing would not be obtained from Lake Oahe); \nid. at 38 (“No waterbody would be permanently drained or filled as part of the DAPL Project, \nand effects on waterbodies are expected to be short-term and minor.”); id. at 45 (addressing \nimpacts of construction activities on groundwater); id. at 50 (explaining no wetlands exist within \nOahe Project Area or Connected Action Area); id. at 58 (discussing “[t]emporary impacts on \nwildlife” that “could occur during construction,” including displacement of “larger and more \nmobile animals”); id. (“No impacts to treaty fishing and hunting rights are anticipated due to \nconstruction within the Project Area or Connected Actions.”); id. at 69 (discussing possible \nadverse impacts on “fish eggs, juvenile fish survival, benthic community diversity and health, \nand spawning habitat,” as well as “fish fry[] and invertebrates inhabiting the river,” from \n“subsurface disturbing activities,” inadvertent release of drilling mud, and water withdrawal \nfrom Missouri River); id. at 75 (“The recreational enjoyment of wildlife (such as hunting or bird \nwatching) may be temporarily affected by construction activities, depending on season and \nlocation.”).  Because the EA “clearly addressed” these impacts and concluded that they would \neither be insignificant or could be mitigated, the Court finds that, in this respect, it was adequate.  \nSee Minisink Residents for Envtl. Pres. & Safety v. FERC, 762 F.3d 97, 112 (D.C. Cir. 2014) \n(finding EA adequately examined compressor-station project’s impact on property values where \nit recognized some adverse impacts might accrue but could be mitigated). \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 40 of 91\niii. Spill Impacts \n  As to the second issue — namely, the spill effects —the Tribe contends that the EA “never \nexamined the impacts of spills on the Tribe and its Treaty rights.”  SRST Reply at 1.  The Court \nagrees in part.  \nFirst, it bears noting that even though a spill is not certain to occur at Lake Oahe, the \nCorps still had to consider the impacts of such an event on the environment.  “[A]n agency \nconducting an EA generally must examine both the probability of a given harm occurring and the \nconsequences of that harm if it does occur.”  New York v. Nuclear Regulatory Comm’n, 681 \nF.3d 471, 482 (D.C. Cir. 2012).  “Only if the harm in question is so ‘remote and speculative’ as \nto reduce the effective probability of its occurrence to zero may the agency dispense with the \nconsequences portion of the analysis.”  Id. (quoting Limerick Ecology Action, Inc. v. Nuclear \nRegulatory Comm’n, 869 F.2d 719, 739 (3d Cir. 1989)).  Yet, “the finding that the probability of \na given harm is nonzero does not, by itself, mandate an EIS: after the agency examines the \nconsequences of the harm in proportion to the likelihood of its occurrence, the overall expected \nharm could still be insignificant and thus could support a FONSI.”  Id.; see also Gov’t of the \nProvince of Manitoba v. Salazar, 691 F. Supp. 2d 37, 50 (D.D.C. 2010) (“It may be that the risk \nof a breach is low given the pipeline’s construction, but that is not an excuse for Reclamation to \nrefuse entirely to analyze the consequences.  When the degree of potential harm could be great, \ni.e., catastrophic, the degree of analysis and mitigation should also be great.”); Sierra Club v. \nWatkins, 808 F. Supp. 852, 868 (D.D.C. 1991) (holding that, given disputed evidence concerning \nthe possibility of severe accidents, an agency may not simply “refus[e] to include certain low \nprobability risks” — it must at least “admit that such accidents are possible,” determine the \nprobability of occurrence, and “discuss[] their potential effects”).  Here, the Corps did not wholly \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 41 of 91\nignore the consequences of a possible oil spill, despite its conclusion that the risk of such an \nevent was low.  On the contrary, it adequately discussed the impacts of such “a low risk/high \nconsequence event,” EA at 92, on water — but not on hunting or aquatic — resources.  \nAs to water resources, the EA offered several comments.  It acknowledged that, during \noperations, “[d]rinking water intakes located downstream from the Missouri River and Lake \nOahe crossings could be at risk if there was a release that reached these bodies of water in the \nvicinity of the intake structures,” and that “the Standing Rock Sioux . . . have intake structures \nwithin the river downstream of the Lake Oahe Project area.”  Id. at 38; see also id. at 42 (“In the \nunlikely event of a release during pipeline operations, drinking and irrigation water intakes \nlocated downstream from the Missouri River and Lake Oahe crossings could be at risk if \nhydrocarbons were to reach these bodies of water in the vicinity of the intake structures.”); id. at \n87 (“Concerns have been expressed regarding an inadvertent release reaching intake structures \non Lake Oahe. . . .  In the unlikely event of a release, sufficient time exists to close the nearest \nintake valve to avoid human impact.”).  Later, the EA further explained: “Accidental releases \nfrom the pipeline system during operations could potentially affect groundwater. . . .  [C]rude oil \nreleased into soil can migrate toward water where certain constituents can dissolve into \ngroundwater or surface water in limited amounts.”  Id. at 45.   \nIt then presented a model estimating the concentrations of benzene, a potentially toxic \ncompound found in crude oil, that could be released during a very small, small, moderate, or \nlarge spill at the Oahe crossing, and discussed how those results might vary during winter \nmonths when temperatures are likely to be colder.  Id. at 46-47.  Even assuming that “[t]he entire \nvolume of a crude oil spill was released due to a catastrophic failure of the pipeline and reached \nthe waterbody; [c]omplete, instanteous mixing occurred; [and] [t]he entire benzene content of the \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 42 of 91\ncrude oil was solubilized into the water column,” the model concluded that under no spill \nscenario would the acute toxicity threshold for aquatic organisms be exceeded, and that under the \n“most probable spill volume,” benzene concentrations would not “exceed the drinking water \ncriteria.”  Id.  In addition, at the conclusion of its discussion of the nine spill-risk factors \npreviously discussed, the EA, under the header “Consequences,” stated: “In the event that a \npipeline failure occurs and product is released into the Missouri River at either crossing, the \nworst case consequence scenario is ranked high because several drinking water intake High \nConsequence Areas (HCAs) and multiple ecologically sensitive HCAs could be impacted.”  Id. \nat 94.  \nThe EA is not similarly attentive, however, to the impacts of a spill on fish or game, the \nresources implicated by the Tribe’s fishing and hunting rights.  As to aquatic resources, the EA \noffered only a cursory nod to the potential effects of an oil spill, stating simply that “[t]he \nprimary issue related to impacts on the aquatic environment from operation of the Proposed \nAction would be related to a release from the pipeline.”  Id. at 69.  It never explained, though, \nwhat those effects would be.  Instead, it simply reasoned that adherence to Dakota Access’s \nresponse plan “would minimize potential impacts on aquatic wildlife.”  Id. at 69-70; see also id. \nat 101.  Likewise, regarding hunting, the EA only discussed the effects of construction on \n“recreationally and economically important species and nongame wildlife”; it said nothing about \nthe effects of a spill.  Id. at 57-58.   \nStanding Rock, though, had alerted the Corps to its fishing- and hunting-related concerns \nafter the agency published the Draft EA.  See, e.g., ECF No. 159-1, Exh. C (SRST Comments on \nDraft EA, Jan. 8, 2016) at 13 (“[A] pipeline leak would threaten to damage . . . the fish and \nwildlife on which many Tribal members depend for subsistence.”); ECF No. 159-1, Exh. D \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 43 of 91\n(SRST Suppl. Comments on Draft EA, Mar. 24, 2016) at 15 (“The waters of Lake Oahe also \nprovide habitat for fish, wildlife, and plants important to the diet . . . of the Tribe.”).  The \nDirector of Standing Rock’s Department of Game, Fish, and Wildlife Conservation, moreover, \nexplained that many of the Tribe’s members rely on fishing as “an important supplemental \nsource of food and nutrition” and that the Tribe issued 199 family fishing permits in 2015.  See \nECF No. 117-16 (Declaration of Jeff Kelly, Nov. 28, 2016), ¶ 5.  An oil spill, he said, could \n“cause extensive fish kills.”  Id., ¶ 12.  He also spelled out the ways in which an oil spill could \nseriously affect game along the Oahe shoreline, including by poisoning animals that ingest, \ninhale, or are otherwise externally exposed to oil and preventing those birds and mammals whose \nfeathers or fur are coated with oil from maintaining their body temperatures.  Id., ¶ 13.  Although \nthe Corps did not have Kelly’s declaration before it when it issued the EA in July 2016, his \nremarks were before the agency when it concluded that the easement could be issued based on \nthe EA absent any supplementation.   \nWithout any acknowledgment of or attention to the impact of an oil spill on the Tribe’s \nfishing and hunting rights, despite Plaintiff’s efforts to flag the issue, the EA — in this limited \nrespect — was inadequate.  The appropriate remedy for such omission is discussed in Section \nIII.D, infra.  \n2.  Alternatives  \nTo comply with NEPA, an Environmental Assessment must include a “‘brief \ndiscussion[]’ of reasonable alternatives to the proposed action.”  Myersville, 783 F.3d at 1323 \n(quoting 40 C.F.R. § 1508.9(b)).  This consideration “need not be as rigorous as the \nconsideration of alternatives in an EIS.”  Id.; compare 40 C.F.R. § 1508.9(b) (requiring “brief \ndiscussion[]”) with id. § 1502.14(a) (requiring agency to “[r]igorously explore and objectively \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 44 of 91\nevaluate all reasonable alternatives” when EIS required).  “An alternative is ‘reasonable’ if it is \nobjectively feasible as well as ‘reasonable in light of [the agency’s] objectives.’”  Myersville, \n783 F.3d at 1323 (quoting Theodore Roosevelt Conservation P’ship v. Salazar, 661 F.3d 66, 72 \n(D.C. Cir. 2011)).  An agency’s “specification of the range of reasonable alternatives is entitled \nto deference.”  Id. \nStanding Rock believes that the Environmental Assessment lacks an adequate \nconsideration of such alternatives.  Specifically, the Tribe posits that the EA did not \nappropriately examine an alternative route that would have had the pipeline cross the Missouri \nRiver further north.  See SRST MSJ at 26, 30-31.  The Court disagrees: on this front, the EA \nadequately discharged the Corps’ NEPA obligations. \nBefore settling on the current DAPL route, Dakota Access considered routing the \npipeline to cross Lake Oahe approximately 10 miles north of Bismarck, North Dakota — i.e., \napproximately 50 miles north of its current location, which sits just 0.5 miles north of the \nStanding Rock Reservation.  See EA at 8, 161 (Figure 13).  The Company soon determined, \nhowever, that that route was not “a viable alternative.”  Id.  The EA explains why.  A table \ntherein compares the Bismarck and Oahe crossings in terms of overall route mileage; co-location \nwith other pipelines and powerlines; the number of existing pipelines, floodplains, water \nfeatures, and powerlines crossed; miles of agriculture, developed/low intensity, developed/open \nspace, and grass/pasture land crossed; whether Corps-owned land would be crossed; the number \nof waterbodies crossed; the number of high-consequence areas affected; and the number of \ntransportation crossings.  Id. at 9-10.  A separate table compares the two crossings in terms of \ntotal pipeline and total HDD length, as well as in terms of cost for road/railroad bores, \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 45 of 91\ninstallation for non-HDD areas, HDD, geotechnical investigation, above-ground facilities, right-\nof-way acquisition, and engineering and consulting.  Id. at 11.   \nThat data reveals that the Bismarck alternative would have required an additional 11 \nmiles of pipeline, “consisting of roughly 165 additional acres of impact,” 11 more floodplain \ncrossings, 1 more powerline crossing, and 27 more transportation crossings.  Id. at 8-10.  In \naddition, it would have “crossed through or in close proximity to several wellhead source water \nprotection areas” and “crossed other populated PHMSA high consequence areas” — i.e., “locales \nwhere a release from a pipeline could have the most significant adverse consequences” — “not \npresent on the [selected] route.”  Id. at 8.  The North Dakota Public Service Commission, \nmoreover, requires a 500-foot residential buffer, which would have “severely constrained” the \nBismarck route.  Id.  By contrast, on the Reservation, the residence closest to the pipeline at \nOahe is located more than 1.5 miles away.  Id. at 86.  And finally, the Bismarck alternative \nwould have cost nearly $33 million more and been co-located with other pipelines or utility \ncorridors for only 3% of the route as compared to the selected route’s 41%.  Id. at 9, 11.   \nStanding Rock largely focuses its critique on the EA’s reliance on a memo prepared by \nDAPL consultants, which it argues offers “a one-sided analysis that considered downstream \nimpacts for the Bismarck alternative, but not for the Oahe crossing.”  SRST MSJ at 30.  But that \nmemo, which the EA does not expressly cite, provides another reasonable basis on which the \nCorps could have rejected the Bismarck crossing in favor of Oahe.  It explains that the two \nclosest municipal-water intakes to the Bismarck crossing would have been at Mandan, 7.3 miles \ndownstream and serving 19,381 people, and Bismarck, 11.6 miles downstream and serving \n65,123 people.  See ECF No. 209-16 at 18 (Memorandum from Tom Siguaw, Dakota Access, & \nSteve Rove, HDR Engineering, Apr. 12, 2016).  The first downstream intake from the Oahe \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 46 of 91\ncrossing, comparatively, is 4.2 miles downstream but is non-tribal and for agricultural use.  Id.  \nThe second is 7.6 miles downstream and is used by Standing Rock also for agricultural purposes.  \nId.  The third — and the first to be used for drinking water — is 11.1 miles downstream and \nbelongs to the South Central Regional Water District, which serves 3,491 people in Emmons \nCounty, North Dakota.  Id.  The fourth — and the first Standing Rock intake for public \nconsumption — is 26.2 miles downstream at Fort Yates and serves 229 people in Fort Yates and \nup to 4,317 in Sioux County.  Id.  The Bismarck crossing thus would have been much closer — \nnearly four miles — to a drinking-water intake than the Oahe crossing.  The drinking-water \nintakes near Bismarck also serve many more people than the two closest to the Oahe crossing.  \nThis difference will be even more pronounced once construction is complete on a new water-\nintake structure being built to serve all communities on the Standing Rock Reservation, as that \nsystem will be located approximately 50 miles further downstream from the Oahe crossing than \nthe existing structure serving the Tribe at Fort Yates.  See Cooper Memo at 19.    \nThis is not to say that the EA’s analysis of the Bismarck alternative is without flaws.  As \nthe Cooper Memo points out, when counting the number of wetland and water features crossed, \nthe EA uses raw numbers of crossings, rather than “the total [number] of impacts measured as \nacreage or linear feet,” which would have given “a more accurate comparison of the route.”  \nCooper Memo at 9.  And although the Bismarck route would have crossed PHMSA high-\nconsequence areas that the Lake Oahe route does not, the Lake Oahe route also crosses high-\nconsequence areas.  Id.; EA at 94.  Despite these issues, by identifying and comparing several \nfeatures of the two routes as described, the EA easily clears NEPA’s hurdle requiring “brief \ndiscussion” of reasonable alternatives.  \n \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 47 of 91\n3.  Environmental Justice \nStanding Rock next contends that the Corps’ environmental-justice analysis was arbitrary \nand capricious.  A 1994 Executive Order requires that, “[t]o the greatest extent practicable and \npermitted by law,” federal agencies “shall make achieving environmental justice part of [their] \nmission by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse \nhuman health or environmental effects of [their] programs, policies, and activities on minority \npopulations and low-income populations.”  Exec. Order 12,898, Federal Actions to Address \nEnvironmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations, 59 Fed. Reg. 7629 \n(Feb. 11, 1994), § 1-101.  The Order expressly states that it does not create a private right to \njudicial review, id. § 6-609, but the D.C. Circuit has permitted challenges to environmental-\njustice analyses under NEPA and the APA.  See Communities Against Runway Expansion, Inc. \nv. F.A.A., 355 F.3d 678, 689 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (“The [agency] exercised its discretion to include \nthe environmental justice analysis in its NEPA evaluation, and that analysis therefore is properly \nsubject to arbitrary and capricious review under the APA.”).     \nAs the EA acknowledges, see EA at 84, the Council on Environmental Quality developed \nguidance to assist federal agencies in ensuring that environmental-justice concerns “are \neffectively identified and addressed.”  ECF No. 117-19 (CEQ, Environmental Justice Guidance \nUnder the National Environmental Policy Act, Dec. 10, 1997) at 1.  That guidance instructs that \nagencies “should consider the composition of the affected area, to determine whether minority \npopulations, low-income populations, or Indian tribes are present in the area affected by the \nproposed action, and if so whether there may be disproportionately high and adverse human \nhealth or environmental effects on minority populations, low-income populations, or Indian \ntribes”; “should recognize the interrelated cultural, social, occupational, historical, or economic \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 48 of 91\nfactors that may amplify the natural and physical environmental effects of the proposed agency \naction”; and “should recognize that the impacts within . . . Indian tribes may be different from \nimpacts on the general population due to a community’s distinct cultural practices.”  Id. at 9.  \n“Where environments of Indian tribes may be affected,” CEQ advises, “agencies must consider \npertinent treaty, statutory, or executive order rights and consult with tribal governments in a \nmanner consistent with the government-to-government relationship.”  Id. at 14.  Finally, the \n“unit of geographic analysis” for the environmental-justice assessment should “be chosen so as \nnot to artificially dilute or inflate the affected minority population.”  Id. at 26.  \nHere, the Corps defined the unit of geographic analysis for its environmental-justice \nassessment as a 0.5-mile radius around the crossing, yielding a focus on the two census tracts in \nwhich the HDD boreholes would be drilled — i.e., the places on either side of Lake Oahe at \nwhich the pipeline would enter the ground to pass under the water.  See EA at 84.  Those two \ncensus tracts were in Morton County and Emmons County; they did not include Sioux County, \nwhere the Reservation is located.  Id. at 80, 83.   \nTo identify the impact of the project on the populations in the chosen census tracts, the \nCorps compared the average demographic data from the two census tracts to that of “counties in \nthe general vicinity” of the Oahe crossing — Emmons, Morton, and Sioux Counties — and to \nthat of North Dakota generally.  Id. at 84.  Specifically, the Corps compared the areas by \npercentage of racial minorities and percentage of persons living below the poverty level.  Id. at \n83.  That data analysis revealed that the minority population in the two census tracts was 2% — \ni.e., 29% lower than the minority population in the general-vicinity counties and 9% lower than \nthe minority population in North Dakota as a whole.  Id. at 83, 85.  It also showed that the \npercentage of persons living below the poverty level in the two census tracts was 9%.  Id. at 83.  \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 49 of 91\nThe EA states that this figure was 3% lower than the impoverished population in the general-\nvicinity counties and 50% higher than in North Dakota as a whole.  Id.  Based on these \ncomparisons, the EA concluded that “there is no concern regarding environmental justice to \nminority populations at the Proposed Action Area at . . . Lake Oahe.”  Id. at 85.  In actuality, \nsome of the EA’s calculations are incorrect.  See Cooper Memo at 24 (identifying one of two \nerrors).  Using the correct figures, the percentage of persons living below the poverty line in the \ntwo census tracts was 11% lower than in the general-vicinity counties and 3% lower than in \nNorth Dakota as a whole.  Id. at 83; Cooper Memo at 24.  (As will be seen, the calculation errors \nplay no significant role in the outcome on this issue.) \nThe Tribe challenges the Corps’ decision to use a 0.5-mile buffer and the resulting \nanalysis as arbitrary and capricious gerrymandering.  See SRST MSJ at 28.  The Standing Rock \nReservation is 0.55 miles — or 80 yards beyond the 0.5-mile limit — downstream of the HDD \nsite, and the Tribe contends that there was no principled basis on which to narrowly exclude it \nfrom the bounds of the Corps’ analysis.  Id. at 29.  It also notes that the two census tracts selected \nas the “affected area” are “mostly upstream of the crossing site” with a 98% white population.  \nId.  By comparing these tracts to a baseline of three counties that included Sioux County, \nStanding Rock argues, the EA “compar[ed] an area that will be almost entirely unaffected by a \nspill from the pipeline, and where few Tribal members live, against a baseline that included a \nsignificant portion of the Reservation.”  Id.  “Unsurprisingly,” the Tribe observes, the “‘affected \narea’ did not have a higher population of minority and low-income people than the claimed \nbaseline, allowing the Corps to dismiss environmental justice concerns.”  Id.  \nThe Corps and Dakota Access defend the reliance on a 0.5-mile buffer by repeating the \njustification given in the EA: “Transportation projects, such as under the Federal Transit \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 50 of 91\nAdministration, and natural gas pipeline projects under the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission . . . typically use a 0.5 mile buffer area to examine Environmental Justice effects.”  \nEA at 84; see also id. at 87 (“As stated above, linear projects typically use a 0.5 mile buffer area \nto examine Environmental Justice effects.”); DA SRST Opp. at 29; Corps SRST MSJ at 27.   \nAlthough “[t]he ‘identification of the geographic area’ within which a project’s impacts \non the environmental resources may occur ‘is a task assigned to the special competency of the \nappropriate agencies,’” Powder River Basin Res. Council v. BLM, 37 F. Supp. 3d 59, 75 (D.D.C. \n2014) (quoting Tri-Valley CAREs v. Dep’t of Energy, 671 F.3d 113, 1127 (9th Cir. 2012)) \n(quoting Kleppe v. Sierra Club, 427 U.S. 390, 414 (1976)), the Court is hard pressed to conclude \nthat the Corps’ selection of a 0.5-mile buffer was reasonable.  DAPL is neither a transportation \nproject nor a natural-gas pipeline; it is a crude-oil pipeline.  The EA does not identify any project \ninvolving a crude-oil pipeline for which a 0.5-mile buffer was employed.  The Corps, likewise, \npoints only to other types of infrastructure projects.  See Corps SRST MSJ at 27 (citing Coal. for \nHealthy Ports v. Coast Guard, No. 13-5347, 2015 WL 7460018, at *25 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 24, 2015) \n(project to raise height of bridge); Bitters v. Fed. Highway Admin., No. 14-1646, 2016 WL \n159216, at *14 (E.D. Cal. Jan. 13, 2016) (project to reintroduce vehicle traffic lanes to particular \nstreets)).   \nThe Corps nonetheless rejoins that there is no meaningful distinction between those \nprojects and DAPL.  Id. (“Analysis of a half-mile buffer, which is appropriate for bridges or \nother construction projects with street-level noise, traffic or other impacts, is certainly \nappropriate for the Lake Oahe crossing, where the construction is deep under the bed of Lake \nOahe and is staged on private lands.”); Corps SRST Reply at 13 n.3 (“[A] bridge that carries rail \ncars or truck traffic transporting oil or hazardous substances which could just as easily suffer low \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 51 of 91\nprobability accidents resulting in releases to the waterways underneath the bridges.”).  The \nproblem with the Corps’ argument, however, is that the cases it cites did not consider an oil spill \nwhen evaluating impacts; if they had, perhaps a different geographic scope may have been \nselected.  Standing Rock, conversely, points to two oil-pipeline projects for which a much larger \naffected area was used to assess environmental-justice impacts.  See SRST MSJ at 30 n.16 \n(citing ECF No. 117-22 (Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement, Keystone XL \nProject) at 3.10-3) (assessing environmental-justice impacts 14 miles downstream of crossings)); \nSRST Reply at 25 n.23 (citing ECF No. 195-6 (Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact \nStatement for Line 67 Expansion, Jan. 2017) at 3.0-2 (looking at spill impacts up to 40 river-\nmiles downstream)).   \nStanding Rock is not the only entity to criticize the 0.5-mile-buffer choice.  In its \ncomments on the Draft EA, the EPA advised the Corps that “the area of analysis to assess \npotential impacts to EJ communities should correspond to the impacts of the proposed project \ninstead of only the area of construction disturbance.”  ECF No. 209-8 at 126 (Letter from Philip \nStrobel to Brent Cossette, Mar. 11, 2016).  “For oil pipeline projects, potential impacts to EJ \ncommunities would include the effects of leaks and spills to downstream water supplies (both \ndrinking water quality, agricultural uses, and costs) and aquatic resources such as fish and \nriparian vegetation used by EJ populations.”  Id.  Even the Corps’ Chief Counsel expressed \nconcern about the agency’s geographic selection when reviewing the EA’s legal sufficiency:  \nThe Corps’ determination of the affected environment . . . can be \nquestioned here. . . .  Sioux County is just outside the 0.5-mile \npipeline buffer.  While the equally sized buffer on both sides of the \npipeline seems reasonable along land areas, it is arguably less so at \nwater areas because of the potential for water currents to carry a spill \ndownstream.  Sioux County is located just south and downstream of \nthe  pipeline.    Thus,  the  SRST  population  present  immediately \noutside  of  the  proposed  area  or  affected  environment  and \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 52 of 91\ndownstream reasonably could have been within the area identified \nas the affected environment in the EA.  If that area was included, the \nEA would then determine whether there might a disproportionately \nhigh and adverse human health or environmental effect on the \nSRST. \n \nCooper Memo at 25-26.  \n  The Corps argues that the Court need not confine its analysis to the use of a 0.5-mile \nbuffer, however, because the EA also devoted a separate section to environmental-justice \nimpacts on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation.  See EA at 85-87.  That additional section, as it \nturns out, does not yield the Corps a full reprieve.  The Standing Rock-focused environmental-\njustice section begins with the “recogni[tion] that the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is downstream \nof the Lake Oahe Crossing” and “has a high population of minorities and low-income residents.”  \nId. at 85.  It first discusses impacts from the project’s construction and anticipated operation, and \nit explains that: the crossing will be installed via HDD on private lands adjacent to Corps-owned \nland, HDD drilling has no anticipated environmental effects, the pipeline’s route “maintain[s] a \nminimum distance of 0.5 mile[s] from Tribal land,” and the closest residence on the Reservation \nto the Oahe crossing is more than 1.5 miles away.  Id. at 85-86.  “As a result of this routing \ncriteria, the nature of the action (construction associated with laying an underground oil \npipeline), the short term duration of effects, construction and operation on private lands, the \nconcurrent reclamation activities, state of the art construction techniques, [and] use of high \nquality materials and standards that meet or exceed federal standards,” the EA concludes, “there \nwill be no direct or indirect effects to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.  This includes a lack of \nimpact to its lands, cultural artifacts, water quality or quantity, treaty hunting and fishing rights, \nenvironmental quality, or socio-economic status.”  Id. at 86.  Given the absence of impacts, it \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 53 of 91\ncontinues, “there is no resulting adverse or disproportionate impacts of the Proposed Action with \nrespect to Environmental Justice considerations.”  Id. \n  The problem here, as the Tribe points out, is that this analysis covers only construction \nimpacts, not spill impacts.  See SRST Reply at 26.  As to the effects from a spill (as distinct from \nthe risk of a spill occurring), the EA’s discussion is minimal:  \nConcerns have been expressed regarding an inadvertent release \nreaching intake structures on Lake Oahe.  Given the engineering \ndesign,  proposed  installation  methodology,  quality  of  material \nselected, operations measures and response plans[,] the risk of an \ninadvertent release in, or reaching, Lake Oahe is extremely low.  \nWhile the locations of water intakes is not public information for \ndisclosure in  this  document,  there  are  private  and/or  non-tribal \nintakes closer to the Lake Oahe crossing than any intakes owned by \nthe tribe; further demonstrating the lack of disproportionate impacts \nof an inadvertent release to the Tribe and the reservation.  We \nunderstand that due to the rural nature of this area, tribal drinking \nwater supplies are obtained from a combination of wells and surface \narea.  The siting and construction of oil pipelines upstream of \ndrinking water intakes is not uncommon throughout the United \nStates and is not considered an Environmental Justice issue.  In the \nunlikely event of a release, sufficient time exists to close the nearest \nintake valve to avoid human impact. \n \nEA at 87.  This limited analysis, the Court believes, is not enough to discharge the Corps’ \nenvironmental-justice responsibilities under NEPA.   \n“The purpose of an environmental justice analysis is to determine whether a project will \nhave a disproportionately adverse effect on minority and low income populations.”  Allen v. \nNat’l Institutes of Health, 974 F. Supp. 2d 18, 47 (D. Mass. 2013) (quoting Mid States Coal. for \nProgress v. Surface Transp. Bd., 345 F.3d 520, 541 (8th Cir. 2003)).  The EA takes some steps \ntoward satisfying this purpose.  It acknowledges that Standing Rock, a community with a high \npercentage of minorities and low-income individuals, is based downstream of the Oahe crossing \nand could be affected by an oil spill, and it observes — without providing any specifics — that a \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 54 of 91\nnon-tribal community’s drinking-water intake is closer to the Oahe crossing than is Standing \nRock’s.  But these statements are not enough to reasonably support the conclusion that the Tribe \nwill not be disproportionately affected by an oil spill in terms of adverse human health or \nenvironmental effects.  See CEQ Guidance at 9.   \nThe EA is silent, for instance, on the distinct cultural practices of the Tribe and the social \nand economic factors that might amplify its experience of the environmental effects of an oil \nspill.  Id. at 9, 14.  Standing Rock provides one such example in its briefing: many of its \nmembers fish, hunt, and gather for subsistence.  See SRST MSJ at 41.  Losing the ability to do so \ncould seriously and disproportionately harm those individuals relative to those in nearby non-\ntribal communities.     \nThe Corps need not necessarily have addressed that particular issue, but it needed to offer \nmore than a bare-bones conclusion that Standing Rock would not be disproportionately harmed \nby a spill.  Given the cursory nature of this aspect of the EA’s analysis, the Court agrees with the \nTribe that the Corps did not properly consider the environmental-justice implications of the \nproject and thus failed to take a hard look at its environmental consequences.  Once again, the \nremedy for such omission is considered in Section III.D, infra.  \nB.  Decision to Grant the Easement \nThe Tribe’s second set of arguments centers around the Corps’ February 8, 2017, \ndecision to grant an easement to Dakota Access to construct and operate DAPL under Lake \nOahe.  As a reminder, the Corps had previously said, in a memo issued on December 4, 2016, \nthat it would not grant such an easement based on the current record and would undertake \nadditional analysis before making a final decision.  Standing Rock first contends that the Corps’ \nFebruary 2017 easement decision was an arbitrary and capricious reversal of its previous \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 55 of 91\nposition.  It also asserts that the decision was in conflict with the Corps’ trust-responsibility \nobligations.  The Court addresses each in turn.  \n1.  Policy Change \nWhen an agency action changes or reverses a prior policy, it must “display awareness \nthat it is changing position”; it may not, e.g., “depart from a prior policy sub silentio.”  FCC v. \nFox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009).  It also “must show that there are good \nreasons for the new policy.”  Id.  Generally, however, those reasons need not be better than the \nreasons for the old policy.  To satisfy the APA’s procedural-correctness requirements, it is \nsufficient “that the new policy is permissible under the statute, that there are good reasons for it, \nand that the agency believes it to be better, which the conscious change of course adequately \nindicates.”  Id.  Sometimes, though, more is required.  If the “new policy rests upon factual \nfindings that contradict those which underlay its prior policy,” the agency must “provide a more \ndetailed justification than what would suffice for a new policy created on a blank slate,” for “[i]t \nwould be arbitrary and capricious to ignore such matters.”  Id.; see also id. at 537 (Kennedy, J., \nconcurring) (“[A]n agency's decision to change course may be arbitrary and capricious if the \nagency ignores or countermands its earlier factual findings without reasoned explanation for \ndoing so. An agency cannot simply disregard contrary or inconvenient factual determinations \nthat it made in the past, any more than it can ignore inconvenient facts when it writes on a blank \nslate.”).  The agency need not, though, “refute the factual underpinnings of its prior policy with \nnew factual data.”  United States Sugar Corp. v. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 830 F.3d 579, 626 (D.C. \nCir. 2016), on reh’g en banc in part No. 11-1108, 2016 WL 7427434 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 23, 2016), \nand on reh’g en banc, 2016 WL 7427453 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 23, 2016).  It is enough that it offer a \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 56 of 91\n“reasoned explanation . . . for disregarding facts and circumstances that underlay . . . the prior \npolicy.”  Fox, 556 U.S. at 516.   \nStanding Rock argues that the Corps’ decision to grant the easement on February 8, 2017, \nwas a reversal of the decision announced in the December 4, 2016, memorandum.  Because the \nCorps “failed to address, let alone provide a reasoned explanation for, abandoning the \ndeterminations undergirding its December 4 decision to require an EIS,” the Tribe contends, its \naction was arbitrary and capricious.  See SRST MSJ at 36. \nIn response, the Corps and Dakota Access first argue that Fox simply does not apply: the \ndecision to grant the easement was not a change in policy because the Corps had never denied \nthe easement in the first place.  See Corps SRST MSJ at 34; DA SRST Opp. at 32.  That \nposition, however, mischaracterizes the Tribe’s argument.  Standing Rock does not assert that the \nCorps previously denied the easement; indeed, it could not plausibly do so.  Assistant Secretary \nDarcy clearly stated in her December 4 memo: “To date, the Army has not made a final decision \non whether to grant the easement.”  Dec. 4 Memo, ¶ 6.  Instead, Standing Rock’s argument is \nthat the Corps announced on December 4 that it would “not grant an easement to cross Lake \nOahe at the proposed location based on the current record” — as “additional analysis, more \nrigorous exploration and evaluation of reasonable siting alternatives, and greater public and tribal \nparticipation and comments” were merited, id., ¶ 12 (emphases added) — but nonetheless \ngranted the easement on February 8 without having undertaken such additional analysis.  The \nreversal, then, is the decision to grant the easement on the current record — i.e., as it stood on \nDecember 4 — when the Corps had previously said it would not do so.  This, the Tribe believes, \nwas arbitrary and capricious.  Standing Rock does not, it clarifies in its Reply, assail the \nwithdrawal of the notice of intent to prepare an EIS.  See SRST Reply at 30 n.24.   \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 57 of 91\nThe Corps’ reversal plainly constituted a change in “official policy.”  See, e.g., Alaska \nOil & Gas Ass’n v. Pritzker, 840 F.3d 671, 682 (9th Cir. 2016) (applying Fox to policy change in \nagency’s approach to assessing foreseeable threats to endangered species triggered by internal \nagency memorandum); Sierra Club v. Bureau of Land Management, 786 F.3d 1219, 1226 (9th \nCir. 2015) (explaining Fox did not apply to an agency’s “evolving analysis” that “was not a \nchange in a published regulation or official policy”); Loving v. I.R.S., 742 F.3d 1013, 1021 (D.C. \nCir. 2014) (suggesting Fox applies where initial policy was articulated via testimony to Congress \nand guidance document — i.e., not final agency actions — and policy change was accomplished \nvia rulemaking).  As the decision to grant the easement on the record as of December 4 did not \nrest on new factual findings not relied upon by Darcy or ignore or countermand prior factual \nfindings absent reasoned explanation, the Corps need only have shown good reasons for its new \npolicy.  Taking Fox’s framework into account, the Court concludes that the Corps here satisfied \nits dictates. \nFirst, the Corps displayed “awareness that it [was] changing position.”  Fox, 556 U.S. at \n515.  The February 3, 2017, memo from the Corps’ Lieutenant General that recommended \ngranting the easement acknowledged that Darcy had previously “directed the Corps to engage in \nadditional review and analysis concerning” alternative locations, the potential risk of an oil spill \nand potential impacts to the Tribe, and the Tribe’s treaty rights, but explained that, “[a]fter \nreviewing the record in its entirety and giving further consideration to the input received over the \npast four months, including additional review and analyses of the subjects identified by [Darcy], \nother federal executive offices, and the SRST, the Corps finds that the Final EA concerning the \ncrossing of the DAPL at Lake Oahe is sufficient and does not need further supplementation.”  \nSemonite Memo at 9, 11. \n57 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 58 of 91\nSecond, the Corps provided a reasoned explanation for its new policy.  Darcy’s memo \naffirmed that “the Corps’ prior reviews and actions” — including the EA and FONSI — \n“comported with legal requirements.”  Dec. 4 Memo, ¶ 15.  Her “policy decision” that “a more \nrobust analysis of alternatives [could] be done and should be done” was “based on the totality of \nthe circumstances” — namely, “the specific mandates of the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. \n§ 185), the involvement of historic tribal homelands, the close proximity to reservation lands that \nextend into the potentially affected waters, and the potential impacts on treaty hunting and \nfishing rights.”  Id.  In reversing course, the Corps started from the same premise as Darcy — \nviz., that the EA and FONSI satisfied NEPA’s requirements.  See Semonite Memo at 10.  It then \nexplained that the EA “fully informed . . . the decision on whether to grant an easement under the \nMineral Leasing Act.”  Id.  Supplementation of an EA or EIS, it noted, is required by CEQ \nNEPA regulations only when there are “substantial changes in the proposed action that are \nrelevant to environmental concerns” or when “significant new circumstances or information \nrelevant to environmental concerns” emerge after an EA or EIS is final.  Id. at 11 (quoting 40 \nC.F.R. §§ 1502.9(c)(1)(i), (ii)).   \nHere, the proposed action described in the EA did not change between July 2016 and \nFebruary 2017.  Id.  The Corps also concluded that no new significant circumstances or \ninformation relevant to environmental concerns, including the federal government’s trust \nrelationship to the Tribe, the Corps’ analysis of alternatives, risks from oil spills, and the impact \nof a spill on the Tribe’s Treaty rights and water intakes, had emerged since the EA was finalized.  \nIt did so by comparing the various letters received from the Tribe after the EA was issued, \nincluding its expert report, with comments the Tribe previously submitted on the Draft EA, as \nwell as by looking at the Corps’ analysis in the Final EA, the subsequent review memos, and the \n58 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 59 of 91\n36 special conditions imposed on the easement.  Id. at 11-13.  In response to the Interior \nSolicitor’s memo “address[ing] a series of issues rooted in the perceived risk that the DAPL \nwould leak into Lake Oahe,” the Corps explained that, as set out in the EA and Cooper Memo, \nthe risk of a spill was low and was further mitigated by the easement conditions.  Id. at 13.  \nBy explaining why it was not compelled by the Tribe’s letters, the Interior Solicitor’s \nOpinion, or the Corps’ post-EA reviews to supplement the EA — which Darcy did not dispute \nwas legally sound — the Corps did enough to satisfy the APA’s requirements regarding policy \nreversals.   \n2.  Trust Responsibilities \nIn addition to challenging the decision to grant the easement as an arbitrary-and-\ncapricious reversal of prior agency policy, Standing Rock contends that this and other \nauthorizations to cross Lake Oahe violate the Corps’ trust responsibility to protect the Tribe’s \nTreaty rights.  This trust responsibility, the Tribe argues, is “even higher than the one imposed by \nNEPA.”  SRST MSJ at 39.  In other words, “compliance with general environmental statutes” is \nnot sufficient “to discharge [the Corps’] trust duty”; a greater fiduciary duty is required.  See \nSRST Reply at 34.  \nAs best the Court can tell from the briefing, the Tribe argues that the Corps’ failure to act \nin accordance with its trust-responsibility obligations renders the granting of the easement \narbitrary and capricious under the APA.  See SRST MSJ at 35-43 (situating discussion of Treaty \nrights under heading stating “The Granting of the Easement and Other Corps Authorizations is \nArbitrary, Capricious, and Contrary to Law”); SRST Reply at 30-34 (similar).  Whether that is so \nor Plaintiff intends to also state a separate breach-of-trust action, see ECF No. 106-1 (SRST First \nAmended Complaint), ¶¶ 266-285 (stating separate claims for relief for breach of trust \n59 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 60 of 91\nresponsibility and violation of APA), Standing Rock’s position comes up short for the same \nreason. \nAccording to the Tribe, to fulfill its trustee duties, the Corps needed to “have before it a \nfull and comprehensive understanding of how the project impacts treaty rights and tribes.”  \nSRST MSJ at 40.  It did not so have here, the Tribe asserts, because it “assumed oil spills will \nnever happen and on that basis refused to consider the impacts of an oil spill on the Tribe’s \nTreaty rights and resources.”  Id.  Standing Rock further argues that the Corps did not fulfill its \nfiduciary obligation to share information about the project, as it withheld from the Tribe the spill \nassessment, spill-response plans, and environmental-justice and route analyses.  Id. at 41-42.  \nThe problem for Standing Rock, however, is that “[t]he trust obligations of the United \nStates to the Indian tribes are established and governed by statute rather than the common law.”  \nUnited States v. Jicarilla Apache Nation, 564 U.S. 162, 165 (2011).  To bring a breach-of-trust \nclaim, the Tribe “must identify a substantive source of law that establishes specific fiduciary or \nother duties, and allege that the Government has failed faithfully to perform those duties.”  \nUnited States v. Navajo Nation, 537 U.S. 488, 506 (2003).  Standing Rock asserts that “[t]he \nfederal government has a duty, arising from the Treaties and the federal trust responsibility, and \nreinforced in the MLA and other statutes, to protect treaty rights and resources,” but it does not \npoint in its Motion to a specific statute, treaty, executive order, or other provision that gives rise \nto specific fiduciary duties.  See SRST MSJ at 39.  In its Reply, the Tribe cites Section \n185(h)(2)(D) of the Mineral Leasing Act, which provides that the Corps, “prior to granting a \nright-of-way or permit . . . for a new project which may have a significant impact on the \nenvironment,” shall impose “requirements to protect the interests of individuals living in the \ngeneral area of the right-of-way or permit who rely on the fish, wildlife, and biotic resources of \n60 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 61 of 91\nthe area for subsistence purposes.”  30 U.S.C. § 185(h)(2)(D); see SRST Reply at 36.  Yet that \nprovision does not contain any trust or fiduciary language, and, in any case, the Corps imposed \nsuch conditions on the easement.  See Easement at 37-43.  “Without an unambiguous provision \nby Congress that clearly outlines a federal trust responsibility, courts must appreciate that \nwhatever fiduciary obligation otherwise exists, it is a limited one only.”  N. Slope Borough v. \nAndrus, 642 F.2d 589, 612 (D.C. Cir. 1980).  “Thus, although the United States does owe a \ngeneral trust responsibility to Indian tribes, unless there is a specific duty that has been placed on \nthe government with respect to Indians, this responsibility is discharged by the agency’s \ncompliance with general regulations and statutes not specifically aimed at protecting Indian \ntribes.”  Morongo Band of Mission Indians v. FAA, 161 F.3d 569, 574 (9th Cir. 1998).  \nStanding Rock argues that the line of cases requiring a showing that the government owes \na specific statutory fiduciary duty is limited to damages actions brought under the Indian Tucker \nAct, 28 U.S.C. § 1505, which waives sovereign immunity for certain claims brought by a tribe \nagainst the United States.  That statute, it contends, does not apply here because “the APA \nestablishes both the cause of action and waiver of sovereign immunity.”  SRST Reply at 36.  \nRecent Circuit precedent, however, undermines such a position.   \nIn El Paso Natural Gas Company v. United States, 750 F.3d 863 (D.C. Cir. 2014), the \nD.C. Circuit considered, inter alia, claims by the Navajo Nation concerning environmental \nhazards at uranium, waste, and dump sites.  As to the Tribe’s breach-of-trust cause of action, the \ncourt held that it had failed to state a claim for relief because it “ha[d] not identified a substantive \nsource of law establishing specific fiduciary duties, a failure which [was] fatal to its trust claim \nregardless of whether [the court] read the claim as brought under the APA or under a cause of \naction implied by the nature of the fiduciary relationship itself.”  Id. at 892.  The Navajo Nation \n61 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 62 of 91\nhad argued that its breach-of-trust claim could “be maintained either (1) under the APA or (2) \nunder a cause of action inferred from the fiduciary responsibilities undertaken by the \nGovernment.”  Id.  The D.C. Circuit concluded that, “[o]n either conception of the claim,” its \ninquiry would be “largely the same because, under controlling precedent, a cause of action will \nbe inferred from a fiduciary relationship only where a plaintiff can identify specific trust duties \nin a statute, regulation, or treaty.  And [that] analysis overlaps with the APA’s requirement that a \nplaintiff allege ‘that an agency failed to take a discrete agency action that it is required to take.’”  \nId. (quoting Norton v. S. Utah Wilderness Alliance, 542 U.S. 55, 64 (2004)).   \nTo explain that conclusion, the court addressed the Supreme Court’s case law concerning \nIndian trust claims and the law of the circuit.  It stated, as this Court has above, “The existence of \na general trust relationship between the Government and Indian tribes is long established.  But \nthis general trust relationship alone does not afford an Indian tribe with a cause of action against \nthe Government . . . .  Something more is needed.”  Id. (citations omitted).  It then explained, \n“[W]e apply these same principles” derived from “Indian trust claims arising in the context of \nthe Indian Tucker Act” to “trust claims brought under the APA.”  Id. at 892-93; see also id. at \n895 (“These principles control here, even though the claim is for equitable relief (not money \ndamages) and even though sovereign immunity is waived under § 702 of the APA (and not the \nIndian Tucker Act).”  Indeed, it noted, the D.C. Circuit has “consistently relied on principles \nannounced in Indian Tucker Act cases in trust cases not arising under the Act.”  Id. at 895 \n(citing, e.g., Andrus, 642 F.2d at 611 (“[T]rust responsibility can only arise from a statute, treaty, \nor executive order.”); Cobell v. Norton, 240 F.3d 1081, 1099 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (reiterating that \nfiduciary relationship depends on substantive laws and stating that “the government’s obligations \nare rooted in and outlined by the relevant statutes and treaties”).   \n62 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 63 of 91\nThis Court is bound by El Paso.  It thus cannot accept the Tribe’s position that “[t]he \nTucker Act line of cases has no bearing on the existence of a claim here,” SRST Reply at 36, or \nthat of amici curiae that the APA affords broader trust enforcement than the statute.  See ECF \nNo. 137 (Amicus Brief of Assoc. of American Indian Affairs, et al.) at 8.  Because Standing \nRock has not identified a specific provision creating fiduciary or trust duties that the Corps \nviolated, its breach-of-trust argument — whether considered a separate count or part of its larger \nAPA cause of action — cannot survive.    \nC.  NWP 12 \nStanding Rock’s final claim is that the Corps’ decision to issue a verification that the \nproject complied with the terms of Nationwide Permit 12 was arbitrary and capricious.  As the \nCourt explained in a previous Opinion, the Rivers and Harbors Act forbids certain construction \nactivities within the “navigable water of the United States” absent permission from the Corps.  \nSee Standing Rock I, 205 F. Supp. 3d at 12 (quoting 33 U.S.C. § 403).  Because DAPL is, in \npart, a “structure . . . under . . . a navigable water of the United States,” 33 C.F.R. § 322.3(a), \nDakota Access required a permit under Section 10 of the RHA.  The Corps often authorizes such \nactivities through a general, nationwide permit.  Standing Rock I, 205 F. Supp. 3d at 10.  \nNationwide Permit 12, the general permit at issue here, authorizes “[a]ctivities required for the \nconstruction, maintenance, repair, and removal of utility lines and associated facilities in waters \nof the United States, provided the activity does not result in the loss of greater than 1/2-acre of \nwaters of the United States for each single and complete project.”  Reissuance of Nationwide \nPermits, 77 Fed. Reg. 10,184, 10,271 (Feb. 21, 2012).  On July 25, 2016, the Corps verified that \nthe Oahe crossing would satisfy the terms and conditions of NWP 12. \n63 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 64 of 91\nTo qualify for NWP authorization, a permittee must comply with certain General \nConditions.  General Condition 17, for example, provides that “[n]o activity or its operation may \nimpair reserved tribal rights, including, but not limited to, reserved water rights and treaty fishing \nand hunting rights.”  77 Fed. Reg. at 10,283.  General Condition 7 states, moreover, that “[n]o \nactivity may occur in the proximity of a public water supply intake, except where the activity is \nfor the repair or improvement of public water supply intake structures or adjacent bank \nstabilization.”  Id.  The Tribe argues that because the Oahe crossing does not comply with these \nconditions, it does not qualify for NWP 12.  See SRST MSJ at 43-44. \nThe Court, however, is already remanding on certain of these issues — e.g., Treaty rights \nand environmental-justice considerations — and the Tribe offers no other basis for concluding \nthat the project does not comply with GCs 7 and 17.   \nThe Corps, furthermore, asserts that it was not obligated to evaluate whether these \nGeneral Conditions were satisfied prior to verifying that the project was authorized under NWP \n12.  See Corps SRST MSJ at 45 (citing Snoqualmie Valley Preservation Alliance v. U.S. Army \nCorps of Eng’rs, 683 F.3d 1155, 1164 (9th Cir. 2012) (“The nationwide permit system is \ndesigned to streamline the permitting process.  We decline to impose a new requirement of a full \nand thorough analysis of each general condition based on documentation the Corps may or may \nnot have.”)).  Instead, it explains, “[A] permittee must adhere to the General Conditions to \nmaintain eligibility for a Nationwide Permit.”  Id. (citing 77 Fed. Reg. at 10,282).  Standing \nRock insists that it is not asking the Court to require the Corps to undertake an in-depth analysis \nof each General Condition prior to issuing an NWP 12 verification, but rather is simply \ndemanding that the Corps give GCs some attention when faced with “abundant information.”  \n64 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 65 of 91\nSRST Reply at 43; see also id. (“While it need not necessarily conduct a ‘full and thorough’ \nanalysis of each and every GC, it must deal with the information in front of it.”).   \nThe Tribe, however, offers no case law to support its position.  Other district courts in \nthis circuit, moreover, have articulated the Corps’ obligations as it presents them here.  See \nSierra Club v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 990 F. Supp. 2d 9, 27 (D.D.C. 2013) (“When a \nprospective permittee files a pre-clearance notice [under the general permit process], the only \nthing left to be done is for the Corps’s district engineers to verify that the planned project does, \nin fact, fit within the category of activities that the Corps has already authorized.”).  Given the \nstreamlining and efficiency goals behind the nationwide-permit program, this view makes sense:   \n[F]orcing the Corps to perform an extensive environmental review \nin the verification context under NWP 12 would (i) duplicate work \nalready performed at the nationwide permit stage in pre-clearing this \ncategory of activities; (ii) contravene the purpose of the nationwide \npermit process; (iii) increase exponentially the documentation a \npermittee must submit to the Corps, including numerous items not \nspecifically delineated as required documentation in the General \nConditions; and (iv) multiply the delay and expense associated with \nverifications so as to render them functionally indistinguishable \nfrom individual permit decisions, thus collapsing two conceptually \ndistinct regulatory processes into one.   \n \nMobile Baykeeper, Inc. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, No. 14-32, 2014 WL 5307850, at *15 \n(S.D. Ala. Oct. 16, 2014); see also id. at *16 (“[T]he Corps was not required to study compliance \nwith General Condition 7 before issuing NWP 12 verifications.”).   \nThe Court thus agrees that the Corps need not have investigated compliance with General \nConditions 7 and 17 before issuing NWP verifications on the DAPL crossing at Lake Oahe, and \nthat its permitting decision was not arbitrary and capricious.  This conclusion, however, does not \nforever insulate the NWP 12 permitting decision from challenge.  Dakota Access has a duty to \ncomply with these conditions if it wishes to maintain its eligibility for a Nationwide Permit.    \n65 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 66 of 91\n* * * \n  To summarize its conclusions on Standing Rock’s claims, therefore, the Court finds that \nthe Corps’ decision on July 25, 2016, and February 3, 2017, not to issue an EIS largely complied \nwith NEPA.  Yet there are substantial exceptions: the agency failed to adequately consider the \nimpacts of an oil spill on Standing Rock’s fishing and hunting rights and on environmental \njustice, and in February 2017, it did not sufficiently weigh the degree to which the project’s \neffects are likely to be highly controversial in light of critiques of its scientific methods and data.   \nD.  Remedy \nSo where does that leave us? The Court turns now to the question of remedy.  The cure \nfor the Corps’ NEPA violation is governed by the APA, which provides that the reviewing court \nshall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be . . . \narbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A).  In this Circuit, vacatur is the “standard remedy” for a NEPA violation.  Pub. \nEmployees for Envtl. Responsibility v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Serv., 189 F. Supp. 3d 1, 2 (D.D.C. \n2016) (quoting Humane Soc’y of U.S. v. Johanns, 520 F. Supp. 2d 8, 37 (D.D.C. 2007)); see also \nRealty Income Tr. v. Eckerd, 564 F.2d 447, 456 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (“[W]hen an action is being \nundertaken in violation of NEPA, there is a presumption that injunctive relief should be granted \nagainst continuation of the action until the agency brings itself into compliance.”).  In other \nwords, the Court would vacate DAPL’s permits and easement, thus forcing it to cease operations \nuntil the Corps fully complied with the aforementioned NEPA requirements.  \nSuch a move, of course, would carry serious consequences that a court should not lightly \nimpose.  In fact, courts have discretion to depart from that presumptive remedy and decide not to \nvacate an EA, FONSI, and corresponding authorizations pending NEPA compliance.  Allied-\n66 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 67 of 91\nSignal, Inc. v. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Comm’n, 988 F.2d 146, 150–51 (D.C. Cir. 1993).  “The \ndecision whether to vacate depends on ‘the seriousness of the order’s deficiencies (and thus the \nextent of doubt whether the agency chose correctly) and the disruptive consequences of an \ninterim change that may itself be changed.’”  Id. (quoting Int’l Union, United Mine Workers of \nAm. v. Fed. Mine Safety & Health Admin., 920 F.2d 960, 967 (D.C. Cir. 1990)).  “[A] serious \npossibility that the [agency] will be able to substantiate its decision on remand” cautions in favor \nof remanding rather than vacating.  Id. at 151.  \nHere, Standing Rock argues that “[v]acatur is the appropriate remedy,” SRST MSJ at 45, \nwhereas Dakota Access counters that the Allied-Signal factors require remand without vacatur.  \nSee DA SRST Opp. at 44-45.  These discussions, however, are quite brief, and the Corps never \neven addresses the issue.  This is not surprising — absent knowledge of whether or to what \nextent the Court would remand, the parties were unable to fully address the Allied-Signal factors \nin their summary-judgment briefs.  That mystery now solved, the Court will order the litigants to \nsubmit briefing on whether remand with or without vacatur is appropriate in light of the \ndeficiencies herein identified and any disruptive consequences that would result given the current \nstage of the pipeline’s operation.  As is set out in a contemporaneous Order, the Court will \ndiscuss the schedule of that briefing and the remand at an upcoming status conference to be held \nnext week. \nIV.  Analysis of Cheyenne River’s Claims \nThe Standing Rock Sioux are not the only Tribe at the table.  The Court thus now turns to \nCheyenne River’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and the Corps’ and Dakota Access’s \nCross-Motions.  Cheyenne River seeks summary judgment on four claims: (1) The Corps’ \nissuance of the Section 408 permit was arbitrary, capricious, and unlawful; (2) The Corps’ \n67 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 68 of 91\nissuance of the MLA easement was arbitrary, capricious, and unlawful; (3) The Corps’ issuance \nof both constituted a breach of trust responsibility; and (4) The Corps issued both in violation of \nits pre-decisional consultation duty.   \nBefore addressing each of these separately, a few preliminaries: First, certain aspects of \nthese claims have been addressed in the Standing Rock analysis above — namely, the \nsufficiency of the EA’s spill-risk analysis and the nature of the Corps’ trust responsibilities — \nand the Court will refer back to those conclusions rather than repeat them here.  Second, in light \nof the principles regarding extra-record evidence in administrative-law cases discussed in \nSection III.A.1.a, supra, the Court will consider only documents created on or before July 25, \n2016, when evaluating the Corps’ Section 408 decision and only documents created on or before \nFebruary 8, 2017, when assessing the Corps’ easement decision.  \nA.  Section 408 Decision \nSection 408 of the Rivers and Harbors Act makes it unlawful for a person to “take \npossession of or make use of for any purpose, or build upon, alter, deface, destroy, move, injure, \n. . . or in any manner whatever impair the usefulness of any . . . work built by the United States, . \n. . in whole or in part, for the preservation and improvement of any of its navigable waters or to \nprevent floods.”  33 U.S.C. § 408(a).  The Corps “may,” however, permit the alteration, \npermanent occupation, or use of such public works when, in its judgment, such activity (1) “will \nnot impair the usefulness of such work” and (2) “will not be injurious to the public interest.”  Id.  \nThe Corps so concluded here.  See ECF No. 183-9 (Section 408 Decision Package) at 6.  \nCheyenne River contends that those conclusions were arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  \nIn evaluating that argument, the Court considers the two Section 408 factors separately.  \n \n68 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 69 of 91\n1.  Impairment \nAs to the first prong, the Corps’ objective “is to ensure that the proposed alteration will \nnot limit the ability of the project to function as authorized and will not compromise or change \nany authorized project conditions, purposes or outputs.”  ECF No. 73-15 (Policy and Procedural \nGuidance for Processing Requests to Alter US Army Corps of Eng’rs Civil Works Projects \nPursuant to 33 USC 408, Engineering Circular 1165-2-216 ¶ 7.c.(4)(b)i. (2015)).  To do so, “[a]ll \nappropriate technical analyses including geotechnical, structural, hydraulic and hydrologic, real \nestate, and operations and maintenance requirements, must be conducted and the technical \nadequacy of the design must be reviewed.”  Id.  If the Corps concludes “at any time . . . that the \nusefulness of the authorized project will be negatively impacted,” its inquiry ends.  Id.   \nTo challenge the Corps’ decision that DAPL would not impair the ability of the Lake \nOahe project to function as authorized and would not compromise or change any of its \nconditions, purposes, or outputs, the Tribe first points to 33 U.S.C. § 701-1(b), a provision of the \nFlood Control Act of 1944.  Cheyenne River reads § 701-1(b) to establish that consumptive uses \nof Lake Oahe’s waters “may not be subrogated . . . to non-consumptive uses,” and that no \nactivity with the potential to have an adverse effect on the water’s use — e.g., an oil pipeline \nwith some potential to leak — may be lawfully authorized.  See CRST MSJ at 11-12.   \nSection 701-1(b), however, does not apply here.  That provision provides:  \nThe  use  for  navigation,  in  connection  with  the  operation  and \nmaintenance of such works herein authorized for construction, of \nwaters arising in States lying wholly or partly west of the ninety-\neighth meridian shall be only such use as does not conflict with any \nbeneficial consumptive use, present or future, in States lying wholly \nor partly west of the ninety-eighth meridian, of such waters for \ndomestic municipal, stock water, irrigation, mining, or industrial \npurposes. \n \n69 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 70 of 91\n33 U.S.C. § 701-1(b) (emphasis added).  As is clear from the statutory language, the provision \napplies to navigational uses of water, which DAPL is not.  See also 33 U.S.C. § 701-1 (stating \nfederal policy is to “limit the authorization and construction of navigation works to those in \nwhich a substantial benefit to navigation will be realized therefrom and which can be operated \nconsistently with appropriate and economic use of the waters of such rivers by other users”) \n(emphasis added).   \n  The Tribe next maintains that the Corps did not adequately consider the risk of an oil spill \nor the environmental impacts of the pipeline; as a result, it could not reasonably have concluded \nthat DAPL would not impair the purposes of the Lake Oahe project.  Cheyenne River asserts, for \nexample, that the Corps failed to assess the risk of landslides after mitigation efforts, the effects \nof a landslide or earthquake, or the impacts of a spill on vegetation, recreation, water quality, or \nthe Tribe’s water intake.  See CRST MSJ at 16-18.  It also points to the Missouri River \nMainstem Reservoir System Master Water Control Manual, which explains that Congress \n“authorized the System to be operated for the purposes of flood control, navigation, irrigation, \npower, water supply, water quality control, recreation, and fish and wildlife.”  Missouri River \nMainstem Reservoir System Master Water Control Manual, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \n(March 2006), § 1-02, http://www.nwd-mr.usace.army.mil/rcc/reports/mmanual/ \nMasterManual.pdf.  Cheyenne River interprets the Manual to “make[] clear that the Corps lacks \nauthority to approve an oil pipeline crossing of the Missouri River that could impair the \nbeneficial consumptive uses of the river both present and future.”  CRST MSJ at 12; see also id. \nat 14 (“The Master Manual does not provide any authorization to the Corps to permit the use of \nthe Mainstem System for oil pipeline rights-of-way when they place any of the authorized \npurposes at risk.”).   \n70 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 71 of 91\n   As the Court explained in Section III.A.1.b, supra, however, considering the record as of \nJuly 25, 2016, when the Corps issued the Section 408 permit, it had taken a hard look at the risk \nof an oil spill and provided sufficient explanation to support its conclusion that such a risk was \nlow.  The Corps’ July 2016 determination that the Lake Oahe project’s purposes would not be \nimpaired by DAPL’s construction and operation was therefore not arbitrary or capricious.  \nNothing in the Manual mandates a different result.  \n2.  Injurious to Public Interest \nAs to the second prong, the Corps must compare “[t]he benefits that reasonably may be \nexpected to accrue from” a proposed alteration or use of the federal project “against its \nreasonably foreseeable detriments.”  Engineering Circular 1165-2-216 ¶ 7.c.(4)(b)ii.  “If the \npotential detriments are found to outweigh the potential benefits, then it may be determined that \nthe proposed alteration is injurious to the public interest.”  Id.  In making that evaluation, the \nCorps may consider factors such as “conservation, economic development, historic properties, \ncultural resources, environmental impacts, water supply, water quality, flood hazards, \nfloodplains, residual risk, induced damages, navigation, shore erosion or accretion, and \nrecreation.”  Id.   \nCheyenne River raises two challenges to the Corps’ determination that permitting DAPL \nto cross under Lake Oahe would not be injurious to the public interest.  First, the Tribe contends \nthat it was improper for the Corps to consider “benefits to Dakota Access, the oil industry, and \nthe economy generally” in assessing the public interest.  See CRST MSJ at 20-21 (citing EA at \n105-06 (stating that DAPL’s construction “would contribute more than $1 billion in direct \nspending” on materials and “$195 million in easement payments to landowners” with property \ncrossed by the pipeline, and “would provide a benefit to local merchants and vendors” and \n71 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 72 of 91\n“temporary employment opportunities to the local workforce”)).  This argument fares poorly.  \nThe Corps’ Policy and Procedural Guidance on Section 408 expressly permits consideration of \n“economic development” in determining a proposed project’s benefits.  See Engineering Circular \n1165-2-216 ¶ 7.c.(4)(b)ii.   \nSecond, the Tribe argues that the Corps did not explain how it “weighed the risks against \nthe claimed benefit,” CRST Reply at 17, failed to consider the consequences from an oil spill, \nsee CRST MSJ at 18-19, did not adequately consider landslide risk or the impacts of a spill on \nvegetation or recreation, id. at 16-17, and never considered effects on Cheyenne River or its \nwater intake.  See CRST Reply at 18-19.  This argument gains more traction because, as the \nCourt previously explained, see Sections III.A.1.c, III.A.2.b., supra, the Corps’ assessment of the \nimpacts of a spill, although largely adequate, fell short as to fishing rights, hunting rights, and \nenvironmental justice.  Because the Corps must submit its assessment of those impacts upon \nremand, see Section III.D, supra, the Court will await receipt of such information to decide \nwhether the agency’s conclusion that DAPL will not be injurious to the public interest was \narbitrary and capricious.  \n3.  Other Arguments \nFinally, in addition to its arguments regarding the impairment and public-injury prongs, \nCheyenne River asserts that the Corps’ spill-risk and spill-impact conclusions were cursory, that \nthe permit should not have been granted absent an EIS, and that the Corps did not satisfy its \nobligation to independently review the EA.  See CRST MSJ at 2, 10, 18-21.  The Court has \nalready addressed the first two of these points.  See Sections III.A.1, III.A.2, III.B.1, supra.  As \nto the third, it is not persuaded.  \n72 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 73 of 91\nCEQ regulations permit an applicant — here, Dakota Access — to prepare the EA as \nlong as the agency independently evaluates the information submitted, “make[s] its own \nevaluation of the environmental issues[,] and take[s] responsibility for the scope and content of \nthe environmental assessment,” including its accuracy.  See 40 C.F.R. § 1506.5(a)-(b).  Here, the \nEA states that it was “prepared in accordance with” those regulations, and that the Corps \n“independently evaluated and verified the information and analysis undertaken in this EA and \ntakes full responsibility for the scope and content contained herein.”  EA at 1.  The record \nsupports this assertion. \nFirst, the Corps provided ample input to Dakota Access on the proper EA drafting \nprocedure and on its substance.  See ECF No. 183-3 (Email from Brent Cossette to Corps & \nDakota Access Personnel, Mar. 5, 2015) (announcing start of “routine bi-weekly meetings to \ndiscuss the status of the Dakota Access Pipeline project”) at 2; ECF No. 183-4 (Email from \nBrent Cossette to Monica Howard, Apr. 24, 2015) at 2 (advising Dakota Access that public and \ntribes had 30 days to submit comments, company had to address Corps’ comments, Corps could \nnot grant Section 408 permit absent certain geotech investigation, and Corps could not issue \ndecision regarding historical properties absent concurrence of North Dakota State Historic \nPreservation Office); ECF No. 183-5 (Email from Brent Cossette, Sept. 18, 2015) (soliciting \ncomments from twenty-two Corps employees on Draft EA and associated plans); ECF No. 183-\n12 (Email from Brent Cossette to Larry Janis, Corps, Recreation & Natural Resources Branch, \nMay 6, 2016) (summarizing meeting with Dakota Access where Corps pushed company to use \ndifferent spill-model data and disagreed with its assessment that potential impact to water intakes \ndid not need to be in EA); ECF No. 183-11 (Email from Brent Cossette to Tom Sigauw & \nWilliam Harlon, Dakota Access, May 11, 2016) (discussing need for sufficient information “to \n73 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 74 of 91\nensure no negative impacts on irrigation and water supply”); ECF No. 212-2 (ProjNet: \nEnvironmental Review of DAPL) (record of 178 comments from Corps); ECF No. 209-16 at \n147-56 (EA Comment Matrix) (spreadsheet of Corps’ comments on Draft EA and Dakota \nAccess’s responses); Section 408 Decision Package at 23 (confirming Dakota Access \nsatisfactorily addressed geotechnical comments from Corps reviewers); ECF No. 183-10 \n(Geotechnical Investigation Package) at 13-16.   \n  To illustrate the meaningful back-and-forth engagement between the Corps and Dakota \nAccess about the EA’s content, the Court highlights one comment on the draft EA from the \nCorps and the exchange it sparked.  In June 2015, a Corps official noted, “I did not see reference \nof a risk analysis for pipeline spills in the EA.  Recommend inclusion of such analysis into the \nEA due to the size and scope of this transportation pipeline.”  ECF No. 183-6 at 24 (Comment \n6139320).  After Dakota Access supplied the spill model for Lake Oahe, the Corps asked the \ncompany to “include booming strategies and collection points for worst case scenario \ndischarges” and “where [it] would gain access via water for response.”  Id.  It also asked Dakota \nAccess to show how spill volume and response times were calculated and to explain its plans for \n“cultural up front inspections/clearances at the control points.”  Id. at 25.  Several more \ncomments, document submissions by Dakota Access, and telephone calls between the company \nand the Corps followed.  Id. at 25-26.  The Corps only considered the initial comment in May \n2016, nearly a year later, after Dakota Access agreed to insert the requested risk analysis into the \nEA and to adopt certain mitigation measures.  Id. at 27. \nUltimately, seventeen different Corps officers are listed as having been involved in the \nEA’s review, see EA at 126, and a range of Corps personnel reviewed the Section 408 \napplication and certified that DAPL would not be injurious to Lake Oahe or the public interest.  \n74 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 75 of 91\nSee Section 408 Decision Package at 2, 5.  On this record, the Court concludes that the Corps \nmet its responsibility to make its own evaluation of the environmental issues and take \nresponsibility for the scope and content of the EA.  See City of Roseville v. Norton, 219 F. Supp. \n2d 130, 165-66 (D.D.C. 2002) (holding agency satisfied 40 C.F.R. § 1506.5(a)-(b) where record \nshowed contractor worked with agency employees on EA and included “extensive copies of e-\nmail communications between the agency staff discussing their comments on, and edits of, the \nEA”).  \nB.  Easement Decision \nCheyenne River’s next claim is that the Corps’ issuance of the easement was arbitrary, \ncapricious, and inconsistent with the requirements of the Mineral Leasing Act, 30 U.S.C. § 185.  \nThis stance makes minimal headway.  \nThe Mineral Leasing Act was enacted by Congress in 1920 “to promote wise \ndevelopment of [the nation’s] natural resources and to obtain for the public a reasonable financial \nreturn on assets that ‘belong’ to the public.”  Devon Energy Corp. v. Kempthorne, 551 F.3d \n1030, 1033 (D. C. Cir. 2008) (quoting California Co. v. Udall, 296 F.2d 384, 388 (D.C. Cir. \n1961)).  It permits “appropriate agency head[s]” to grant “[r]ights-of-way through any Federal \nlands . . . for pipeline purposes for the transportation of oil . . . to any applicant possessing” the \nrequisite statutory qualifications.  See 30 U.S.C. § 185(a).   \nThe Tribe challenges the Corps’ decision to grant Dakota Access a right-of-way to cross \nLake Oahe on the basis of three provisions in the MLA: (1) The Corps did not adequately \nanalyze whether the easement would be “inconsistent with the purposes of the reservation,” as \nrequired by 30 U.S.C. § 185(b)(1), and instead simply cross-referenced its Section 408 approval; \n(2) The Corps failed to impose stipulations protecting the “interests of individuals living in the \n75 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 76 of 91\ngeneral area . . . who rely on the fish, wildlife, and biotic resources of the area for subsistence \npurposes,” as required by 30 U.S.C. § 185(h)(2); and (3) The Corps did not impose sufficient \nliability on Dakota Access, as required by 30 U.S.C. § 185(x).  See CRST MSJ at 37-44; CRST \nReply at 20-22.  Each is discussed separately. \n1.  Section 185(b)(1) \nSection 185(b)(1) of the MLA provides that “[a] right-of-way through a Federal \nreservation” — i.e., federally owned or managed land, rather than a federal Indian reservation — \n“shall not be granted if the Secretary or agency head determines that it would be inconsistent \nwith the purposes of the reservation.”  30 U.S.C. § 185(b)(1); see also Corps CRST MSJ at 22 \nn.11.  Here, the reservation is the Lake Oahe project, and its “Congressionally-authorized \npurposes . . . include flood control, navigation, hydropower, recreation, water supply, and water \nquality.”  Henderson Memo at 3. \nThe Tribe contends that the Corps ran afoul of Section 185(b)(1) because it did not \n“articulate any rationale” for its conclusion that DAPL was consistent with the purposes of the \nLake Oahe project and improperly relied on the documents and analysis from its Section 408 \ndetermination in undertaking its easement decision.  See CRST MSJ at 40; Henderson Memo at \n3 (explaining Corps’ easement decision was “supported by the Final EA . . . and various \nmemoranda supporting the District Commander’s Section 408 approval”).  But Cheyenne River \ncites no authority for the proposition that the Corps could not rely on its Section 408 decision in \nmaking its easement decision, and the Court can think of no reason why that would be so.  While \nthe approval procedures set out in the RHA and the MLA are not identical, compare 33 U.S.C. \n§ 408 with 30 U.S.C. § 185 — a point acknowledged by the Corps in its briefing on Dakota \nAccess’s now-dismissed cross-claim, see ECF No. 73 at 15-16, 21-22 — the inquiry concerning \n76 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 77 of 91\nproject impairment, injury to the public interest, and inconsistency with project purpose are \ncertainly related and largely overlapping.   \nCheyenne River also contends that any pipeline for which a right-of-way is sought that \nhas the potential to have a high negative impact necessarily “is not ‘consistent’ with the \nauthorized purposes” and cannot satisfy Section 185(b)(1).  See CRST MSJ at 40.  In other \nwords, the MLA requires the Corps to reject every right-of-way application that poses any level \nof risk of serious harm because such risk renders the right-of-way inconsistent with the purposes \nof the federal project.  The Court cannot accept this view, which is in direct tension with the text \nand purpose of the statute.  The MLA expressly contemplates that agencies may grant rights-of-\nway through federal lands for pipelines used to transport “oil, natural gas, synthetic liquid or \ngaseous fuels, or any refined product produced therefrom.”  30 U.S.C. § 185(a).  Such pipelines \nnecessarily involve some level of risk; no reasonable engineer, scientist, or agency official could \nassert that a pipeline project — or any construction or transportation project, for that matter — \ninvolves absolutely zero risk.  It would be nonsensical for Congress to have created a mechanism \nfor granting rights-of-way for oil pipelines if that mechanism could never be used.    \nLast, in arguing that DAPL specifically is inconsistent with the purposes of the Lake \nOahe project, the Tribe relies on its already-discussed position that the Corps failed to consider \nimpacts on most of the Lake’s authorized purposes and underestimated the risks posed by the \npipeline.  Because the Corps did not adequately consider certain effects of a spill should one \noccur and because it did not, as of February 8, 2017, when it granted the easement, demonstrate \nthat it had considered the degree to which DAPL’s effects are likely to be highly controversial, \nsee Sections III.A.1.c, III.A.2.b, supra, the Court will reserve its ultimate conclusion on this \nissue until the Corps submits its additional analysis after remand.   \n77 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 78 of 91\n2.  Section 185(h)(2) \nThe Tribe next turns to Section 185(h)(2), which instructs that the agency in charge of \ngranting the right-of-way  \nshall issue regulations or impose stipulations which shall include, \nbut  shall  not  be  limited  to:  (A)  requirements  for  restoration, \nrevegetation, and curtailment of erosion of the surface of the land; \n(B) requirements to insure that activities in connection with the \nright-of-way or permit will not violate applicable air and water \nquality standards nor related facility siting standards established by \nor pursuant to law; (C) requirements designed to control or prevent \n(i)  damage  to  the  environment  (including  damage  to  fish  and \nwildlife habitat), (ii) damage to public or private property, and (iii) \nhazards to public health and safety; and (D) requirements to protect \nthe interests of individuals living in the general area of the right-of-\nway or permit who rely on the fish, wildlife, and biotic resources of \nthe area for subsistence purposes.   \n \n30 U.S.C. § 185(h)(2).  According to Cheyenne River, the Corps “ignore[d] the requirement to \nprotect the ‘interests of individuals living in the general area . . . who rely on the fish, wildlife, \nand biotic resources of the area for subsistence purposes’” because the EA does not address \nimpacts of an oil spill on vegetation, recreational fishing, or land-based wildlife.  See CRST MSJ \nat 42 (quoting 30 U.S.C. § 185(h)(2)(D)); CRST Reply at 21.   \n  The Corps, however, imposed several stipulations on the easement granted to Dakota \nAccess.  See Easement, Exh. D (listing 36 special conditions).  Those conditions relate to the \nconstruction, operation, and maintenance of the pipeline in order to minimize the risk of a spill \nand the effects from any spill that might occur.  Id.  For example, the Corps has required Dakota \nAccess to perform certain girth-weld and pressure-level tests; use specific pipe and field-joint \ncoatings; install mainline valves to be remotely controllable and equipped with automatic-\nshutdown capabilities; install adequate pressure sensors; implement particular mitigation \nmeasures to avoid impacts on soils; protect against overpressure in the pipeline; install a cathodic \n78 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 79 of 91\nprotection system within six months; perform interference and corrosion surveys within six \nmonths of DAPL’s entry into operation; patrol the pipeline at least twenty-six times per year; \nundertake specific training exercises; establish a storage facility for spill-response equipment; \nkeep records of spill-response plans; and adopt all mitigation measures set out in the EA.  Id.   \n  By aiming to reduce the likelihood of an oil spill and to mitigate the impacts of a spill \nshould one occur, these requirements clearly constitute “requirements designed to control or \nprevent . . . damage to the environment (including damage to fish and wildlife habitat)” and “to \nprotect the interests of individuals living in the general area . . . who rely on the fish, wildlife, \nand biotic resources of the area for subsistence purposes.”  30 U.S.C. § 185(h)(2)(C)(i), (D).  The \nCorps thus satisfied its responsibilities under 30 U.S.C. § 185(h)(2).    \n3.  Section 185(x) \n  Finally, the Tribe takes issue with the liability provisions set out in the easement.  The \neasement provides that Dakota Access “shall be strictly liable to the United States for damage or \ninjury which may arise from or be incident to” its activities under the easement, and it limits \nstrict-liability damages to $10 million per incident.  See Easement, ¶ 12(a), (b).  Liability for \ndamages in excess of $10 million is to be determined according to “ordinary rules of \nnegligence.”  Id., ¶ 12(b).  The easement also contemplates liability to third parties — e.g., \nStanding Rock and Cheyenne River.  It states: “The Grantee does hereby accept liability, if any, \nimposed by Federal and state statutes to third parties for injuries incurred in connection with the \nuse and occupancy of the pipeline right-of-way.”  Id., ¶ 12(c).  Cheyenne River contends that \nthese liability provisions are “an abdication of [the Corps’] fiduciary responsibility to protect the \nresources it pervasively regulates and controls,” CRST MSJ at 44, and inconsistent with the \nrequirements of 30 U.S.C. § 185(x).  See CRST Reply at 22.  \n79 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 80 of 91\n  Setting aside the fiduciary-duty question, which the Court deals with in Section IV.C, \ninfra, the Tribe is mistaken in believing that the Corps has run afoul of 30 U.S.C. § 185(x).  That \nprovision permits the Corps to “impose stipulations specifying the extent to which holders of \nrights-of-way and permits under [the MLA] shall be liable to the United States for damage or \ninjury incurred by the United States in connection with the right-of-way or permit.”  30 U.S.C. \n§ 185(x)(1).  It further permits the Corps to “impose a standard of strict liability” and requires \nthat if it does so, it must “include a maximum limitation on damages commensurate with the \nforeseeable risks or hazards presented.”  Id. § 185(x)(2), (4).   \nThe Corps has complied with these requirements.  Although the Tribe asserts that \n“Dakota Access’[s] statistics on the cost of cleanup of oil spills in the Environmental Justice \nConsiderations Memo to the Corps demonstrates that $10 million will not begin to cover the cost \nof a cleanup,” CRST Reply at 22 (citing ECF No. 203-1, Exh. BBB (Incident Rate Documents) \nat 3), that memo demonstrates just the opposite.  It includes a table of PHMSA pipeline incidents \nbetween 1996 and 2015 in terms of number, fatalities, injuries, total cost in current-year dollars, \nbarrels spilled, and net barrels lost.  Between 1996 and 2015, there were 1,191 incidents with a \ntotal cost of $2,640,408,583, making the average cost per incident $2,216,968 — i.e., far less \nthan $10 million.  The $10 million strict-liability-per-incident figure, then, is certainly \ncommensurate with the foreseeable risks or hazards presented by an oil pipeline running under \nLake Oahe.  \nC.  Trust Responsibilities \nCheyenne River’s next claim is virtually identical to one pursued by Standing Rock: the \nCorps’ issuance of the Section 408 permit and the easement violated its trust responsibility to \nprotect the Tribe’s treaty rights.  Cheyenne River contends that several sources give rise to such \n80 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 81 of 91\na fiduciary obligation: the 1851 and 1868 Fort Laramie Treaties; the Oahe Taking Act, Pub. L. \n83-776, 68 Stat. 1191-1193 (1954); Winters v. United States, 207 U.S. 564 (1908); the Master \nWater Control Manual, § 7-01.1 (explaining one of four objectives behind development of \nMissouri River Mainstem Reservoir System Water Control Plan was “to fulfill the Corps’ \nresponsibilities to Federally recognized Tribes”); the Corps’ “pervasive[] and exclusive control \nover the Missouri River . . . and the entire project area”; 25 U.S.C. § 1632(a)(5) (“The Congress \nhereby finds and declares that . . . it is in the interest of the United States, and it is the policy of \nthe United States, that all Indian communities and Indian homes, new and existing, be provided \nwith safe and adequate water supply systems and sanitary sewage waste disposal systems as soon \nas possible.”); and 30 U.S.C. § 185(x)(1) (permitting federal agencies to impose stipulations \nspecifying permit holder’s liability to United States for damage or injury incurred in connection \nwith permit).  See CRST MSJ at 5, 31-33, 35.  None of these sources, however, establishes \nspecific fiduciary or other duties.  Cheyenne River’s breach-of-trust cause of action thus meets \nthe same fate as Standing Rock’s.  See Section III.B.2., supra.   \nD.  Consultation \nLast, Cheyenne River argues that the Corps violated various duties when it granted the \nSection 408 permit and easement absent the requisite pre-decisional tribal consultation.  See \nCRST MSJ at 22-30.  Whereas Standing Rock — joined by Cheyenne River — brought a \nfailure-to-consult claim in its preliminary-injunction motion under Section 106 of the National \nHistoric Preservation Act, which requires a federal agency to consult with Indian tribes that \nattach cultural or religious significance to property affected by the agency’s “undertakings,” \nStanding Rock I, 205 F. Supp. 3d at 7-8, Cheyenne River here takes a different tack.  Instead of \n81 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 82 of 91\nrelying on the NHPA, it invokes Department of Defense Instruction 4710.02 and NEPA’s \nimplementing regulations.   \nThe Defense Instruction sets out “procedures for DoD interactions with federally-\nrecognized tribes” and requires all organizational entities in the Department — e.g., the Corps — \nto “involve tribal governments early in the planning process for proposed actions that may have \nthe potential to affect protected tribal rights, land, or resources.”  Department of Defense \nInstruction 4710.02 (2006), §§ 1, 6.6, http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/ \n471002p.pdf.  “Early involvement,” the Instruction explains, “means that a tribal government is \ngiven an opportunity to comment on a proposed action in time for the tribal government to \nprovide meaningful comments that may affect the decision.”  Id. § 6.6.  If an action “ha[s] the \npotential to significantly affect protected tribal resources, tribal rights, or Indian lands,” the \nagency is to “[c]onsult with federally-recognized tribal governments on a government-to-\ngovernment basis.”  Id. § 5.3.4 (emphasis added); see also id. §§ 6.1-6.5.  Similarly, NEPA’s \nimplementing regulations require agencies to “consult[] early with appropriate State and local \nagencies and Indian tribes and with interested private persons and organizations” when actions \nare planned by private applicants.  See 40 C.F.R. § 1501.2(d)(2).  Based on the record of \ncommunication between the Corps and Cheyenne River in the lead-up to the EA’s publication in \nJuly 2016, the Court concludes that the Corps did endeavor to consult early with the Tribe and \ngave it the opportunity to offer meaningful comments on the proposed crossing at Lake Oahe.  It \nthus need not address the Corps’ alternative contention that the DoD Instruction and NEPA’s \nimplementing regulations do not impose binding consultation duties.  See Corps CRST MSJ at \n39.  \n82 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 83 of 91\nThe Corps first contacted Cheyenne River about DAPL in October 2014, when it sent a \nletter with information about proposed soil borings and maps illustrating portions of the pipeline \nand nearby cultural sites.  See ECF No. 185-1, Exh. MM (Form Letter from Corps, Oct. 24, \n2014); ECF No. 185-1, Exh. NN (Letter from Steve Vance to Richard Harnois, Aug. 17, 2015) \n(acknowledging receipt of Corps’ October 2014 letter); EA at 80.  The letter invited “comments \nor concerns regarding this project” within 30 days, see Form Letter, but Cheyenne River did not \nrespond until March 23, 2015, when the Corps’ Regulatory Project Manager in the South Dakota \nRegulatory Office spoke with Steve Vance, Cheyenne River’s Tribal Historic Preservation \nOfficer, by phone.  See Standing Rock II, 2017 WL 908538, at *5; ECF No. 218-2 at 154 (Email \nfrom Jeff Breckenridge, Regulatory Project Manager, South Dakota Regulatory Office, to Corps \nPersonnel, Mar. 23, 2015).  Vance stressed the Tribe’s request for formal consultation, \ninvolvement in the NHPA Section 106 process, and ability “to review any EA’s/NEPA \ndocumentation for the project.”  Id.  Several months then passed, however, without any \ncomments submitted from Cheyenne River.   \nRichard Harnois, the Corps’ Senior Field Archaeologist, spoke with Vance on August 17, \n2015, to “express[ his] concerns that [the Corps] had gotten no comments back yet.”  ECF No. \n183-15 (Richard Harnois Notes, Aug. 17, 2015).  Vance explained that he had been “promoting a \ncoordinated response from the tribes through SRST,” but Harnois encouraged the Tribes to \nrespond individually, as “the way [the Corps] see[s] it, each response is like a vote — the more \nthe better.”  Id.  Vance committed to submitting a letter and requested an onsite meeting with “all \nof the interested tribal parties to inspect the crossing alignment and initiate a discussion of the \npipeline as a whole.”  Id.  His letter, sent that same day, acknowledged the “opportunity to \ncomment [on] the proposed Dakota Access Pipeline . . . project,” asked whether Standing Rock’s \n83 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 84 of 91\npreviously submitted questions and comments had been addressed, and expressed concerns \nabout, inter alia, impacts of DAPL on birds, fish, and wildlife, as well as pipeline corrosion, \nfaulty welding, and oil spills.  ECF No. 183-14 (Letter from Steve Vance to Richard Harnois, \nAug. 17, 2015).  Julie Price, Manager of the Corps’ Cultural Resource Program, later followed \nup with Vance to thank him for his letter and inform him that a copy of the Draft EA would be \n“distributed for Tribal . . . comments in mid-December, 2015.”  ECF No. 183-17 (Letter from \nJulie Price, Manager, Cultural Resource Program, Corps, to Steve Vance, Nov. 19, 2015). \nAround the same time Harnois was reaching out to Vance, Col. John Henderson, the \nCorps’ Omaha District Commander, sent a letter to Harold Frazier, Cheyenne River’s Chairman.  \nSee ECF No. 218-2 at 14-16 (Letter from John Henderson to Harold Frazier, Sept. 3, 2015).  \nHenderson described the DAPL project and explained that the purpose of his letter was “to \ninitiate Section 106 consultation and review, determine [Frazier’s] interest in consulting, . . . and \nto gather information that will assist the Corps in identifying historic properties.”  Id. at 14.  He \nalso noted that DAPL was “currently working to obtain the necessary easements for crossing \nfederal lands, as well as” authorization under Section 408 of the RHA, and advised Frazier that \n“consultation on the project has also been initiated as part of the Corps Section 408 review \nprocess for the areas located on Corps Project Lands.”  Id. at 16.  Henderson requested \n“engagement and/or comments by September 30, 2015,” and supplied the contact information for \nthree different Corps officials.  Id.   \nMartha Chieply, the Corps’ Regulatory Chief for the Omaha District, sent a follow-up \nletter to Frazier at the end of November 2015 to notify him of an NHPA Section 106 consultation \nmeeting that was to be held on December 8-9, 2015, in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.  See ECF No. \n183-18 (Letter from Martha Chieply to Harold Frazier, Nov. 20, 2015).  She also emphasized the \n84 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 85 of 91\nCorps’ interest in hearing from the Tribe about “any culturally significant concerns that may \naffect” areas within the Corps’ jurisdiction along the pipeline’s route.  Id. \nWhen the Corps released the Draft EA on December 8, 2015, it sent a notification to the \nTribe and requested comments by January 8, 2016.  See ECF No. 185-1, Exh. VV (Declaration \nof Jonathan Shelman, Environmental Resource Specialist, Corps, Aug. 18, 2016), ¶ 8; EA at 1.   \nShortly thereafter, Vance attended the December consultation meeting, at which five \nCorps officials and Dakota Access personnel were present.  See ECF No. 183-25 (Dakota Access \nTribal Consultation Meeting Roster, Dec. 8, 2015); ECF No. 218-1 at 108 (DAPL Tribal \nConsultation Meeting Agenda); ECF No. 218-1 at 111 (Dakota Access Tribal Consultation \nMeeting, Dec. 8, 2015).  According to the Corps’ “[s]ummary of meeting results,” Dakota \nAccess agreed to provide the Tribes with inadvertent-discovery plan drafts and “information \nrelated to spill response plans” by December 18, and the Tribes agreed to review the data within \n30 days.  See ECF No. 218-1 at 112 (Email from Joel Ames, Tribal Liaison, Corps, to Corps \nPersonnel, Dec. 10, 2015).   \nVance then attended two more meetings — one on January 25, 2016, and one on \nFebruary 18-19, 2016, held at Ponca Tribal Headquarters.  See ECF No. 185-1, Exh. DD \n(Declaration of Martha Chieply, Aug. 18, 2016), ¶¶ 21-22.  Cheyenne River maintains that “[t]he \nJanuary and February 2016 meetings were . . . Section 106 meetings only,” CRST Reply at 41, \nbut the agenda for the February meeting lists a “Section 408 and Draft EA Update” to be given \nby “Brent Cossette, Omaha 408 Coordinator.”  ECF No. 218-2 at 1 (DAPL Tribal Consultation \nAgenda, Feb. 18-19, 2016).  A transcript from that meeting confirms that the Corps’ role under \nSection 408 and concerns relating to that permit were discussed.  See ECF No. 143-1 (Transcript \nof DAPL Meeting, Feb. 18-19, 2016) at 1, 4.  Vance also used that meeting to communicate to \n85 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 86 of 91\nthe Corps the Tribe’s preference that the agency undertake an EIS rather than an EA, see ECF \nNo. 183-26 (Tribal Consultation Meeting Notes, Feb. 18-19, 2016), and its concerns about \nDAPL’s impact on water quality, fish, and birds.  See Transcript of DAPL Meeting at 3-4. \nAfter that meeting, Chieply and two other Corps personnel “agreed to meet again” with \nStanding Rock and Cheyenne Rock together, as Vance and Standing Rock’s Tribal \nArchaeologist “wanted to discuss specific cultural resource issues of importance to their Tribes.”  \nChieply Decl, ¶ 24.  As a result of concerns Standing Rock expressed at that meeting regarding \ncertain tribal cultural resources, including burial sites, at the James River crossing, the Corps \nsuccessfully urged Dakota Access to move the pipeline’s route to avoid them.  Id. \nIn addition to those meetings, the Corps vainly tried for several months to contact and \nmeet with Chairman Frazier.  In response to a voicemail Frazier left for Joel Ames, the Corps’ \nTribal Liaison, on February 8, Ames left several phone messages with Frazier’s secretary, called \nhis cell phone, sent multiple emails, and even asked Vance and the Tribe’s Vice Chairman for \nhelp, all to no avail.  See ECF No. 183-22 (Emails from Joel Ames to Harold Frazier, Feb. 22 – \nMar. 7, 2016) (listing five emails from Corps to Frazier requesting phone call); ECF No. 185-1, \nExh. EE (Declaration of Joel Ames, Aug. 18, 2016), ¶¶ 23-24 (describing repeated attempts to \nreturn Frazier’s Feb. 8, 2016, voicemail), ¶ 26 (explaining how, in response to Vance’s request \nthat the Corps consult with Cheyenne River, he told Vance of his efforts to contact Frazier, and \nVance “agreed to help make it happen”); ECF No. 218-1 at 292 (Emails between Julie Price and \nLarry Janis, Mar. 3, 2016) (discussing Price’s communications with Vance and Frazier’s \nsecretary to arrange meeting with Frazier); ECF No. 185-1, Exh. QQ (Email from Joel Ames to \nCorps Personnel, May 9, 2016) (stating Ames had recently met Cheyenne River’s Vice \nChairman and communicated that he was trying to reach Chairman Frazier to arrange meeting).  \n86 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 87 of 91\nOn May 6, Henderson sent an email to Frazier explaining that the Corps had “been unsuccessful \nin identifying any potential meeting dates” with the Tribe and expressing his desire “to meet to \ndiscuss not only the DAPL project, but any other topics you may want to discuss.”  ECF No. \n183-21 (Letter from John Henderson to Harold Frazier, May 6, 2016).  \nVance sent two letters to the Corps in May that articulated concerns about DAPL’s \nimpact on the Tribe’s historic sites, expressed frustrations with the lack of consultation to date, \nand repeated Standing Rock’s comments that the draft EA was “insufficient for oil pipelines” \nand an EIS should be completed.  See ECF No. 185-1, Exh. II (Letter from Steve Vance to \nRichard Harnois, May 2, 2016); ECF No. 183-19 (Letter from Steve Vance to John Henderson, \nMay 19, 2016).  Frazier, however, did not respond to the Corps’ repeated outreach efforts until \nJune, when he sent a letter stating that it had not initiated the requisite consultation and that the \ndraft EA insufficiently analyzed DAPL’s impact on the Tribe’s cultural resources and historic \nsites and did not contain “proper environmental analysis.”  ECF No. 183-20 (Letter from Harold \nFrazier, June 3, 2016).  The Corps responded to these letters with “recent Question and Answer \nsummar[ies]” from recent consultation meetings that addressed, inter alia, actions the Corps was \nconsidering regarding DAPL, its expected decisionmaking timeline, and the impact of HDD on \ncultural resources.  See ECF No. 183-23 (Letter from Martha Chieply to Steve Vance, June 13, \n2016); ECF No. 185-1, Exh. JJ (Letter from John Henderson to Harold Frazier, June 22, 2016).   \nWhen the Corps published the EA in July 2016, it included an appendix with the various \ncomments received in response to the public notice of the Draft EA.  See ECF No. 172-4 \n(Appendix J) at 38-58.  No comments from Cheyenne River appear in the appendix, and the EA \ndoes not list Cheyenne River as a consulting party on the EA.  See EA at 111-14 (list of “all \nindividuals and agencies consulted during preparation of the EA”).  On this point, the Court must \n87 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 88 of 91\nbriefly digress from its review of the communication between the Corps and the Tribe.  \nCheyenne River protests its exclusion from Appendix J “even though the Corps received \ncomments from the Tribe” as evidence of “the length to which the Corps went to exclude the \nTribe from its analysis.”  CRST MSJ at 29.  Rather than responding, as Dakota Access did, that \nthe Tribe did not submit any timely comments to the Draft EA, but rather sent letters much later, \nsee DA CRST MSJ at 2, 5, the Corps puzzlingly accuses Cheyenne River of misstating the facts.  \n“Appendix J explicitly states Cheyenne River provided comments and also states those \ncomments,” it asserts.  See Corps CRST MSJ at 35 n.18.  But the Corps cites to comments from \nNorthern Cheyenne, an entirely different tribe.  See CRST Reply at 43 n.19.  The Court trusts \nthis error is simply a clerical oversight, albeit one with unfortunate connotations regarding how \ndistinct Tribes may be perceived.  \nAppendix J confusion aside, the record clearly indicates that the Corps solicited \nCheyenne River’s views on the DAPL project well before publishing the EA and issuing the \nSection 408 permit and easement, and communicated regularly with Vance and Frazier via phone \ncalls, letters, and in-person meetings.  These actions were sufficient to satisfy the early-comment \nand consultation goals articulated in the Defense Department Instruction and NEPA’s \nimplementing regulations.   \nCheyenne River’s protests to the contrary do not persuade the Court otherwise.  First, the \ncases on which the Tribe relies to demand a more robust consultation process rest on federal \nstatutes governing the Bureau of Indian Affairs’ consultation responsibilities and the NHPA’s \nSection 106 substantive-consultation requirements, not the DoD Instruction and NEPA.  See \nCRST MSJ at 23-24, 27-28 (citing Wyoming v. Dep’t of Interior, 136 F. Supp. 3d 1317, 1345-46 \n(D. Wyo. 2015), vacated and remanded sub nom. Wyoming v. Sierra Club, No. 15-8126, 2016 \n88 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 89 of 91\nWL 3853806 (10th Cir. July 13, 2016); Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe v. Jewell, 205 F. Supp. 3d \n1052, 1057-58 (D.S.D. 2016); Quechan Tribe of Fort Yuma Indian Reservation v. Dep’t of \nInterior, 755 F. Supp. 2d 1104 (S.D. Cal. 2010); Yankton Sioux Tribe v. Kempthorne, 442 F. \nSupp. 2d 774, 784 (D.S.D. 2006)). \nThe Tribe also argues that many of the contacts from the Corps were focused on the \nprotection of cultural, religious, and historic sites implicated by Section 106 of NHPA and thus \ncannot “constitute consultation on the impact of DAPL on trust and treaty resources under \nNEPA.”  CRST MSJ at 30; see also CRST Reply at 40.  The Corps, however, repeatedly invited \nthe Tribe to share comments on the project that went beyond Section 106 concerns.  And \nNHPA’s implementing regulations encourage federal agencies “to coordinate compliance” with \nSection 106 and NEPA.  See 36 C.F.R. § 800.8(a)(1); see also id. (“Agencies should consider \ntheir section 106 responsibilities as early as possible in the NEPA process, and plan their public \nparticipation, analysis, and review in such a way that they can meet the purposes and \nrequirements of both statutes in a timely and efficient manner.”); Apache Survival Coal. v. \nUnited States, 21 F.3d 895, 906 (9th Cir. 1994) (“NHPA’s implementing regulations contemplate \nthat NEPA and NHPA review should be integrated closely.”).   \nCheyenne River further maintains that the Corps made its decision on the Section 408 \npermit long before the EA was published, thus truncating the time period for meaningful \ncomment.  See CRST MSJ at 24-25.  Its support for that proposition is wanting.  The Tribe \nrelies, for example, on a December 10, 2015, memorandum from the Chief of the Corps’ \nGeotechnical Engineering and Sciences Branch that it characterizes as “sign[ing] off” on the \npermit, and points to the lack of comments from the Water Control and Water Quality Branch on \nthe draft EA and the absence of a “Record of Decision for the Recreation and Natural Resource \n89 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 90 of 91\nBranch.”  Id. at 24-25.  The cited memo, however, simply explains that the thirteen “geotechnical \ncomments . . . generated during the technical review” had been “satisfactorily addressed by the \nEngineer-of-Record, Dakota Access LLC and GeoEngineers” and so “were closed out.”  ECF \nNo. 209-10 at 73.  In direct conflict with the Tribe’s early-decision claim, it states: “The \ncomments herein pertain only to the geotechnical and flowable easement issues related [to] HDD \nand Geotechnical investigations in the floodway and do not constitute USACE approval of any \npermits that may be required.”  Id. (emphasis added).  The Water Quality Branch, moreover, did \nreview the Lake Oahe crossing.  See Section 408 Decision Package at 1. \nThe Tribe last argues that it could not have been adequately consulted prior to the \npermitting decisions because the Corps did not provide it with the Scoping Comments in \nAppendix J or the environmental-justice-considerations memo until December 2016, and it did \nnot release the Spill and Analysis and Facility Response Plans to the Tribe’s experts until \nFebruary 2017.  See CRST MSJ at 28; CRST Reply at 40.  As the Court has previously \nexplained, however, some of those documents were appropriately withheld from public \ndisclosure.  Standing Rock III, 2017 WL 1316918, at *5-6.  More important, Cheyenne River \ndoes not explain how lacking access to those documents hindered its ability to meaningfully \ncomment and consult on the EA when it was given access to the draft several months before the \nfinal version was published and offered repeated access to Corps personnel.   \n* * * \n  In sum, then, the Court reaches the same decision on Cheyenne River’s claims as it did \non Standing Rock’s.  Aside from the discrete issues that will be the subject of remand, the Court \nconcludes that the Corps complied with its statutory responsibilities.  In addition, it will similarly \n90 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 239   Filed 06/14/17   Page 91 of 91\npermit Cheyenne River to participate in the briefing on vacatur pending remand, as set forth in \nSection III.D, supra.  \nV.  Conclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant in part and deny in part Standing Rock’s \nMotion for Partial Summary Judgment and grant in part and deny in part the Corps’ \ncorresponding Cross-Motion for Partial Summary Judgment.  The Court also will deny in part \nCheyenne River’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and defer a decision on those claims \nthat may be affected by the remand ordered in response to Standing Rock’s Motion.  It \naccordingly grants in part the corresponding Cross-Motions for Partial Summary Judgment from \nthe Corps and Dakota Access.  A contemporaneous Order so stating will issue this day.  \n \n/s/ James E. Boasberg \n            JAMES E. BOASBERG \n            United States District Judge \n \nDate:  June 14, 2017  \n \n91 \n ",

Consolidated Case Nos. 16-1769 and \n16-267) \nU.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS,    \n   \nDefendant, \n \n            and \n \nDAKOTA ACCESS, LLC, \n \n  Defendant-Intervenor and Cross-    \n            Claimant. \n \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \n \nOnce more into the breach over the Dakota Access Pipeline goes this Court, though for \nthe first time addressing claims of the Yankton Sioux Tribe and Robert Flying Hawk, the \nChairman of the Tribe’s Business and Claims Committee.  While the Plaintiffs may have \nchanged, the underlying claims are quite familiar.  As with the Standing Rock and Cheyenne \nRiver Sioux Tribes before them, the Yankton Sioux challenge the construction and operation of \nthe Dakota Access Pipeline under the National Historic Preservation Act, the National \nEnvironmental Protection Act, and the 1851 Treaty of Laramie.  Specifically, Plaintiffs allege \n  1\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 2 of 40\nthat Defendants – the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and an \nassortment of federal employees of both agencies – violated the NHPA by failing to adequately \nconsult with the Tribe regarding historical and cultural sites, violated NEPA by unlawfully \nsegmenting their analyses of the pipeline’s environmental impacts, and violated the 1851 Treaty \nby granting approvals for DAPL without first obtaining the Tribe’s consent.   \nBoth sides have now filed Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment on the Tribe’s NEPA \nand Treaty-based claims.  Defendants additionally urge the Court to dismiss as moot Plaintiffs’ \nNHPA counts, asserting that they are no longer viable in light of DAPL’s completed \nconstruction.  Agreeing that it can provide no effective remedy on this last score, the Court will \ndismiss the NHPA claims.  It will also grant summary judgment for Defendants with respect to \nPlaintiffs’ Treaty-based count, which the Tribe essentially withdrew during briefing.  Finally, the \nCourt concludes that Plaintiffs have not shown that the Corps and FWS improperly “segmented” \ntheir analysis of the pipeline’s environmental consequences, thus yielding summary judgment for \nDefendants on the NEPA claims as well.  \nI.   Background  \nA.   Factual and Statutory Background \nThe lengthy factual history of the Dakota Access Pipeline, a 1,200-mile domestic-oil \npipeline running from North Dakota to Illinois, is set forth in this Court’s prior Opinions and \nneed not be repeated here.  See, e.g., Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers (Standing Rock I), 205 F. Supp. 3d 4, 12-15 (D.D.C. 2016).  The Court will, however, \nprovide a brief background of this Tribe’s participation in DAPL’s development and an overview \nof the specific federal actions related to the pipeline.  \n  2\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 3 of 40\nA federally recognized Tribe that is headquartered in Wagner, South Dakota, the Yankton \nSioux have approximately 9,000 enrolled members.  See ECF No. 292 (Yankton MSJ) at 3.  \nTheir Reservation is located in South Dakota, hundreds of miles from the much-contested Lake \nOahe crossing and at least 60 miles from any other part of DAPL’s path.  See ECF No. 321 at 5 \n(Map 2).  The Tribe nonetheless opposes the construction and routing of the pipeline, alleging \nthat it will harm a number of its environmental interests.   \nSince the pipeline project was proposed, Plaintiffs insist that they have “continually \nsought to protect” their tribal lands from the “serious risk of harm” it poses.  See Yankton MSJ at \n4.  This assertion is somewhat belied, however, by the record regarding the Tribe’s cooperation \n(or lack thereof) with the federal agencies involved in the project.  The Yankton did not attend \nmultiple meetings held by the Corps and FWS to discuss DAPL (meetings that were attended by \nother interested tribes), see Exhs. I (January 25, 2016, Corps Meeting Log), J (December 8, \n2015, Corps Meeting Log), V (List of Invitees to FWS Meetings), W (FWS Meeting Log), nor \ndid they respond to numerous efforts by the Corps and FWS to engage in discussion regarding \nthe pipeline.  See Exhs. N (Letter from Col. Henderson, May 10, 2016), O (Letter from Col. \nHenderson, May 6, 2016), P (Email Chain Discussing Corps’ Attempts to Contact Yankton, May \n2, 2016), Q (Email Chain Discussing Consultation, April 15-22, 2016), T (Letter from FWS to \nChairman Flying Hawk), U (Letter from FWS to Tribal Officer Little).  Regardless of the Tribe’s \nlevel of participation in the consultation process, however, the Yankton have since objected to \nthe pipeline’s construction and routing.  \nIn particular, Plaintiffs contest the process by which the Corps and FWS issued a series of \npermits and permissions necessary for the pipeline to cross federally regulated lands and waters.  \nAlthough DAPL runs almost entirely across private property, 3% of the pipeline is on federally \n  3\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 4 of 40\nmanaged land and thus required governmental approval.  See Standing Rock I, 205 F. Supp. 3d \nat 13.  The permits needed for these portions of the pipeline were issued by four separate entities \n– three districts of the Corps and one district of FWS.  In evaluating these permissions, each \nagency division conducted an environmental assessment under the National Environmental \nProtection Act.   \nNEPA requires that federal agencies evaluate the environmental effects of major \ngovernment actions, but it “imposes only procedural requirements.”  Dep’t of Transp. v. Public \nCitizen, 541 U.S. 752, 756 (2004).  If a project will “significantly” affect the “quality of the \nhuman environment,” NEPA requires that the agency complete a detailed Environmental Impact \nStatement (EIS).  See 42 U.S.C. § 4332(C).  To determine whether or not there will be such \nsignificant effects, however, the agency first prepares a shorter Environmental Analysis (EA).  \nThis “concise public document” discusses the need for the proposal, the alternatives, the \nenvironmental impacts of the proposed action, and the agencies and persons consulted.  See 40 \nC.F.R. § 1508.9(a), (b).  If the EA concludes that there will be no significant environmental \nimpact, the agency may forgo completing a full EIS and may instead issue the EA and a Finding \nof No Significance (FONSI). \nThis was the route chosen by the federal agencies charged with evaluating the DAPL-\nrelated permissions.  In July 2016, the Corps’ Omaha District issued an EA and FONSI related to \nthe crossings of Corps-managed lands and flowage easements at Lake Oahe and Lake \nSakakawea in North Dakota.  See Exh. A (Omaha District EA and FONSI).  In August of that \nyear, the Corps’ St. Louis District issued its own EA and FONSI, which addressed four crossings \nin Illinois, three of which spanned less than 700 feet, and one of which crossed a federal flowage \neasement for approximately 2.5 miles.  See Exh. B (St. Louis District EA and FONSI).  The \n  4\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 5 of 40\nCorps’ Rock Island District also issued a permission under Section 408 of the Rivers and \nHarbors Act for a crossing of the Mississippi River, after the district determined that the proposal \nqualified for a categorical exclusion under NEPA.  See Exh. C (Rock Island District \nMemorandum).  Finally, the FWS issued an EA in May 2016 and a FONSI in June of that year, \nand it granted Dakota Access permission to cross five wetland easements and one grassland \neasement in North Dakota.  See Exhs. D (FWS EA), E (FWS FONSI).  These easements, which \nwere over 60 miles from the water crossings evaluated by the Corps, affected 71.8 acres of the \npipeline route, or less than 1% of the total North Dakota and South Dakota project area.  See \nFWS EA at 18.  In total, therefore, the federal agencies issued three EAs and complementary \nFONSIs and one categorical exclusion, each of which in turn facilitated the various permissions \nand permits needed for DAPL to cross federally managed lands.  It is these NEPA analyses, and \nthe process by which they were conducted, to which Plaintiffs now object.  \nB.   Procedural History \n1.        History of DAPL Litigation \nThe Yankton Sioux Tribe initiated the instant suit on September 9, 2016, when it filed a \nComplaint against the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the United States Fish and \nWildlife Service, and four individual Defendants – Dan Ashe, Director of FWS; John W. \nHenderson, Commander of the Corps’ Omaha District; Anthony Mitchell, Commander of the \nCorps’ St. Louis District; and Todd Semonite, the Corps’ Commanding General and Chief of \nEngineers.  See Case No. 16-1796, ECF No. 1 (Yankton Sioux Compl.).  In February 2017, \nDefendant Dakota Access moved to intervene in support of federal Defendants, a motion that \nwas not opposed by the Tribe and was subsequently granted by the Court.  Id., ECF No. 17 \n(Dakota Access Motion to Intervene); Minute Order of March 13, 2017 (Granting Motion to \n  5\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 6 of 40\nIntervene as Unopposed).  That March, upon an unopposed motion by the Corps, the Tribe’s case \nwas consolidated with challenges to DAPL filed by the Standing Rock, Cheyenne River, and \nOglala Sioux Tribes.  See Minute Order of March 17 (Consolidation Order). \nFor the past fourteen months, others among the consolidated Plaintiffs have made \nmultiple attempts to prevent oil from flowing through the pipeline.  Indeed, this Court has now \nissued five Opinions in this case – all addressing various claims by the Standing Rock and \nCheyenne River Sioux Tribes.  These Tribes’ first pass at preventing pipeline construction was a \nmotion for a preliminary injunction based solely on the NHPA, asserting that the ongoing \nclearing and grading of the land along DAPL’s route disrupted sacred tribal sites.  See Standing \nRock I, 205 F. Supp. 3d at 7-9.  On September 9, 2016, the Court denied emergency relief, and \nconstruction proceeded.  Id. at 37.   \nOn February 8, 2017, the Corps granted Dakota Access an easement pursuant to the \nMineral Leasing Act, authorizing it to cross federal lands at Lake Oahe and complete the \npipeline.  See ECF No. 172-11 (Easement).  The next day, Cheyenne River filed another motion \nfor preliminary injunction and an application for a temporary restraining order, this time alleging \nviolations of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.  See ECF Nos. 98, 99; Standing Rock \nSioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Standing Rock II), 239 F. Supp. 3d 77, 81 \n(D.D.C. 2017), appeal dismissed, No. 17-5043, 2017 WL 4071136 (D.C. Cir. May 15, 2017).  \nBelieving these religious-freedom claims unlikely to succeed, the Court issued an Opinion \ndenying this preliminary injunction as well.  See Standing Rock II, 239 F. Supp. 3d at 80.  As \nthese emergency motions were ongoing, Standing Rock and Cheyenne River filed cross-motions \nfor summary judgment.  See ECF Nos. 117 (SRST MSJ), 131 (CRST MSJ), 172 (Corps MSJ), \n185 (DA MSJ).  Now focusing on their environmental claims, the Tribes challenged the Corps’ \n  6\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 7 of 40\ndecision to issue the easement on the basis of its July 25, 2016, EA and FONSI, contending that \nthe agency had violated NEPA by failing to complete a full EIS.   \nOn June 14, 2017, two weeks after DAPL became fully operational, the Court granted in \npart and denied in part the parties’ motions and remanded certain issues to the Corps.  See \nStanding Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Standing Rock III), 255 F. Supp. \n3d 101 (D.D.C. 2017).  It rejected Plaintiffs’ motion with respect to their claims under the \nMineral Leasing Act and upheld the majority of the Corps’ determinations under NEPA.  Id. at \n152, 147.  It granted the Tribes’ motion, however, with respect to three discrete flaws in the \nCorps’ environmental analysis.  Id. at 147.  Although the Court remanded these issues to the \nCorps for further analysis, it did not decide whether the easement should be vacated pending \nsuch remand.  Id. at 147-48.  That determination followed in the Court’s October 11, 2017, \nOpinion, in which it concluded that there was a “serious possibility” that the Corps would be \nable to substantiate its prior determinations and thus denied vacatur pending remand.  See \nStanding Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Standing Rock IV), 2017 WL \n4564714 (D.D.C. Oct. 11, 2017).  Finally, this past December, the Court issued an Opinion \nimposing a series of interim measures during the remand process, each tailored to keeping the \nCourt informed as to the conditions at Lake Oahe pending further analysis by the Corps.  See \nStanding Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Standing Rock V), 2017 WL \n6001726 (D.D.C.  Dec. 4, 2017).  The remand process remains ongoing and will extend past \nApril 2, 2018.  See ECF No. 338 (Corps’ Notice). \n2.    Yankton Motion for Summary Judgment  \nOnly now, as that remand is ongoing and further analysis is underway, have the Yankton \nSioux and Robert Flying Hawk chosen to enter the fray.  On November 13, 2017, they brought \n  7\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 8 of 40\nthe instant Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on the basis of their claims arising under \nNEPA and the Tribe’s 1851 Treaty of Laramie with the United States.  See Yankton MSJ.  \nSpecifically, the Tribe asserts that Defendants violated NEPA by segmenting their evaluation of \nDAPL’s environmental impacts among multiple federal agencies and Corps divisions.  Id. at 5-\n16.  Arguing that the various federal permissions for the pipeline are “connected” or “similar” \nactions under the meaning of NEPA’s implementing regulations, Plaintiffs contend that \nDefendants were thus required to conduct a consolidated, programmatic assessment of the \napprovals.  Id. at 5-6.  Plaintiffs additionally move for summary judgment on their claim that, by \nfailing to obtain the Tribe’s free and informed consent prior to granting authorizations for \nDAPL’s construction, the Corps and FWS violated the Tribe’s 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie and \nthe federal government’s trust responsibilities to the Tribe.  Id. at 19-29. \nOn January 10, 2018, federal Defendants filed their Opposition to Plaintiffs’ claims and \ncross-moved for partial summary judgment.  See ECF No. 320 (Corps Opp.)  Dakota Access, as \na Defendant-Intervenor and Cross-Claimant, also filed its own Opposition and brief in support of \nfederal Defendants’ Cross-Motion.  See DA Opp.  In their briefing, Defendants additionally \nmoved to dismiss the Tribe’s NHPA claims as moot in light of DAPL’s completed construction \nand current operation.  Plaintiffs filed their Reply and Opposition on January 26, 2018, in which \nthey continue to request summary judgment on their NEPA counts, but “withdraw” their Motion \nwith respect to their Treaty- and trust-based claims.  See ECF No. 324 (Yankton Reply).  They \nalso oppose Defendants’ Motion with respect to the dismissal of their NHPA claim, asserting \nthat the related counts in their Complaint remain viable.  With briefing complete, the Court must \nnow determine whether summary judgment is appropriate for either party.  \n \n  8\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 9 of 40\nII.   Legal Standard \nThe parties have cross-moved for partial summary judgment on the administrative record.  \nThe summary-judgment standard set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c), therefore, \n“does not apply because of the limited role of a court in reviewing the administrative record.”  \nSierra Club v. Mainella, 459 F. Supp. 2d 76, 89 (D.D.C. 2006); see also Bloch v. Powell, 227 F. \nSupp. 2d 25, 30 (D.D.C. 2002), aff'd, 348 F.3d 1060 (D.C. Cir. 2003).  “[T]he function of the \ndistrict court is to determine whether or not as a matter of law the evidence in the administrative \nrecord permitted the agency to make the decision it did.”  Sierra Club, 459 F. Supp. 2d at 90 \n(quotation marks and citation omitted).  “Summary judgment is the proper mechanism for \ndeciding, as a matter of law, whether an agency action is supported by the administrative record \nand consistent with the [Administrative Procedure Act] standard of review.”  Loma Linda Univ. \nMed. Ctr. v. Sebelius, 684 F. Supp. 2d 42, 52 (D.D.C. 2010) (citation omitted), aff'd, 408 Fed. \nApp’x. 383 (D.C. Cir. 2010). \nThe Administrative Procedure Act “sets forth the full extent of judicial authority to \nreview executive agency action for procedural correctness.”  FCC v. Fox Television Stations, \nInc., 556 U.S. 502, 513 (2009).  It requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \nfindings, and conclusions” that are “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not \nin accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  Agency action is arbitrary and capricious if, for \nexample, the agency “entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an \nexplanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so \nimplausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency \nexpertise.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins., 463 U.S. 29, \n43 (1983).  This is a “narrow” standard of review, under which “a court is not to substitute its \n  9\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 10 of 40\njudgment for that of the agency.”  Id.  Rather, the Court “will defer to the [agency's] \ninterpretation of what [a statute] requires so long as it is ‘rational and supported by the record.’” \nOceana, Inc. v. Locke, 670 F.3d 1238, 1240 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (quoting C & W Fish Co. v. Fox, \n931 F.2d 1556, 1562 (D.C. Cir. 1991)).  Although a reviewing court “may not supply a reasoned \nbasis for the agency’s action that the agency itself has not given,” a decision that is not fully \nexplained may, nevertheless, be upheld “if the agency's path may reasonably be discerned.” \nBowman Transp., Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., 419 U.S. 281, 285-86 (1974) \n(citations omitted). \nIII.   Analysis \nA.  Preliminary Issues \nBefore turning to the crux of this case – the Tribe’s NEPA challenge to Defendants’ \nenvironmental assessments – the Court first pauses to address four preliminary issues.   \n1.  LCvR 7(h) \nFirst, and simplest, is the question of whether Plaintiffs are correct that, because \nDefendants “failed to controvert any facts identified by [the Tribe] in the statement of material \nfacts[,] . . . this Court should assume Plaintiffs’ facts are admitted” under Local Rule 7(h).  See \nYankton Reply at 3.  They are not.  Indeed, as Defendants accurately note, Rule 7(h) does not \napply in cases such as this one in which judicial review is based solely on the administrative \nrecord.  See All. for Nat. Health U.S. v. Sebelius, 775 F. Supp. 2d 114, 118 (D.D.C. 2011) \n(noting that “in cases in which judicial review is based solely on the administrative record, the \nparties are not required to submit statements of disputed or undisputed material facts”) (internal \nquotations omitted).  The Court, therefore, will not treat Plaintiff’s facts as admitted and will \ninstead evaluate the parties’ claims on the basis of the underlying administrative record. \n  10\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 11 of 40\n  2.  Treaty and Trust Claims \nThe Court next looks at the Tribe’s Treaty-based claims.  Plaintiffs’ Motion relies in part \non the first count of their Complaint, which alleged that Defendants violated the 1851 Treaty of \nLaramie, the federal trust responsibilities to the Tribe, and the United Nations Declaration on the \nRights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).  See Compl., ¶¶ 81-90.  More specifically, Plaintiffs \nassert that Defendants failed to “consider the impacts of [their] actions to the Tribe’s 1851 Treaty \nRights” and that the Corps breached its “fiduciary duty to consider how its actions may affect a \ntribe’s treaty rights.”  Yankton MSJ at 20, 29.  In their Oppositions and Cross-Motions, \nDefendants contend that this matter was already disposed of in Standing Rock II.  They argue, \nmoreover, that regardless of this Court’s prior Opinion, Plaintiffs are unable to identify any \nretained tribal rights in land or waters that would be affected by DAPL’s construction.  See \nCorps Opp. at 18-19 (stating that “Plaintiffs offer no “compelling reason why this Court should \nreconsider” its prior Opinion addressing treaty rights), 27-28 (noting that Yankton’s current \nlands are 230 miles away from the Lake Oahe crossing and the Tribe has “not identified any \npossibility . . . that a spill would impact [its] lands”); DA Opp. at 21 (“Yankton’s arguments \nbased on treaty and trust obligation are indistinguishable from those the Court already considered \nand resolved.”).   \nPlaintiffs were apparently persuaded by such arguments.  In its Reply, the Tribe stated \nthat “after reviewing [f]ederal Defendants’ response, and given the complexities of rules for \ninterpretation of treaties, Plaintiffs hereby withdraw the [] claim presented in their motion for \npartial summary judgment regarding [Defendants’] failure to consider the Tribe’s treaty rights, \nand choose not to pursue that claim at this time.”  Yankton Reply at 2.  \n  11\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 12 of 40\nThis attempt at a limited “withdrawal” is, unfortunately for the Tribe, not a fruitful legal \ntactic.  Parties are not permitted to float trial balloons in motions for summary judgment, only to \nretract but preserve their claims when the opposing party makes a stronger argument.  Instead, by \nretreating from their Treaty-based claims “after reviewing” Defendants’ response, the Tribe has \nessentially conceded that the Court should grant the Corps’ Cross-Motion for Summary \nJudgment on this issue.  See Abraham v. Diagnostic Ctr. Hosp. Corp. of Texas, 138 F. Supp. 2d \n809, 816 (S.D. Tex. 2001) (granting summary judgment for opposing party when plaintiff \n“cho[se] not to pursue” a given claim raised in initial motion for summary judgment).   \nYet even if the Tribe had not withdrawn the relevant portions of its Motion, it would not \nhave prevailed.  Defendants are correct that in light of this Court’s prior Opinion rejecting nearly \nidentical trust and treaty arguments made by the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux \nTribes, Yankton’s claims are ultimately futile.  See Standing Rock III, 255 F. Supp. 3d at 145. \nIndeed, Plaintiffs make no attempt to distinguish their position from that deemed deficient in \nStanding Rock III.  They instead assert that they “object to this Court’s holding in [its] June 14, \n2017, Memorandum Opinion” and “incorporate[] Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s arguments . . . as \nto why treaties and U.S. trust responsibilities can provide the law to apply.”  Yankton MSJ at 30 \nn.4; see id. at 29 n.3 (“adopt[ing]” Standing Rock’s arguments regarding federal Defendants’ \n“enhanced responsibility to consider Tribe’s treaty rights”).  Disagreement, however, is not a \nlegal basis for this Court to reverse its prior conclusions.  Having already held that the Corps did \nnot have to address the 1851 “Treaty rights qua Treaty Rights” and that the “general trust \nrelationship between the Government and Indian tribes . . .  alone does not afford an Indian tribe \nwith a cause of action against the Government,” Standing Rock III, 255 F. Supp. 3d at 131, 145, \nthe Court finds no grounds for letting the Tribe proceed on this portion of Count I.  \n  12\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 13 of 40\nThe Court will additionally grant summary judgment with respect to Plaintiffs’ UNDRIP \nclaim.  As Defendants accurately note, courts have consistently held that UNDRIP is a non-\nbinding declaration that does not create a federal cause of action.  See Corps Opp. at 19 n.8; \nIsaac v. Sigman, 2017 WL 2267264, at *6 (D.N.J. May 24, 2017) (collecting cases).  The Tribe \nmakes no argument as to why this Court should find otherwise.  It will thus grant summary \njudgment in favor of Defendants on this entire count.  \n  3.  Standing  \nDefendants additionally contend that the Tribe falls short of establishing standing for the \npurpose of bringing their NEPA and NHPA claims.  See Corps Opp. at 29.  In particular, the \nCorps asserts that Plaintiffs “do not provide a specific and concrete plan to return to or use Lake \nOahe specifically or identify how any federal action causes them harm.”  Id. at 30.  The Tribe’s \ndeclarations, according to Defendants, “do not establish current or future use of the areas around \nLake Oahe” and instead only “mention past visits” to the area and the fact that “unnamed tribal \nmembers hunt, gather and perform ceremony with water including the Missouri River in North \nand South Dakota.”  Id.  The Corps casts these assertions as “generalized grievance[s]” and thus \ninsufficient to confer standing under Article III.  Id. at 29.  \nIn order to establish standing, a plaintiff must show that: (1) she has suffered an “injury \nin fact” that is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, rather than conjectural \nor hypothetical; 2) the injury is caused by, or fairly traceable to, the challenged action; and 3) it \nis likely, rather than merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.  \nSee Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs., 528 U.S. 167, 180–81 (2000).  Because \nPlaintiffs here seek to enforce a procedural right – namely, Defendants’ alleged violation of \nNEPA by conducting separate environmental analyses – they may, however, “assert that right \n  13\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 14 of 40\nwithout meeting all the normal standards for redressability and immediacy.”  Summers v. Earth \nIsland Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 496 (2009).  To defeat a defendant’s summary-judgment motion, a \nplaintiff must make these required showings by averring specific facts; conclusory allegations in \na complaint or other pleading are insufficient to establish standing on summary judgment.  See \nLujan v. Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n, 497 U.S. 871, 888–89 (1990).  In environmental cases, “plaintiffs \nadequately allege injury in fact when they aver that they use the affected area and are persons \n‘for whom the aesthetic and recreational values of the area will be lessened’ by the challenged \nactivity.”  Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 183 (quoting Sierra Club, 405 U.S. at 735).   \nHere, the Court concludes that the Tribe adequately pled these requisites for standing.  \nPlaintiffs’ declarations discuss Tribe members’ past use of the areas affected by DAPL’s \nconstruction and operation, including those surrounding Lake Oahe, as well as the injuries they \nfear from the pipeline’s presence on such lands.  See Decl. of Faith Spotted Eagle, ¶¶ 12, 19-23 \n(stating that she has “performed ceremony and prayer at Lake Oahe and near the proposed \nMissouri River crossing site” and “[i]n doing so . . . used water” for “medicine and for spiritual \npurposes,” “gathered medicine very near the pipeline corridor at Lake Oahe,” and that DAPL \nwill “result in . . . emotional, spiritual, psychological, and cultural damage” to the Yankton \npeople via the potential destruction of such resources); Decl. of Kip Spotted Eagle, ¶¶ 10-13 \n(stating that Tribal members “continue[] to hunt, gather and perform ceremony with water . . . \nincluding near the pipeline,” and that he has “been invited to hunt and fish in this area by \nmembers of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe”);  Decl. of Glenn Drapeau, ¶¶ 9-10 (stating that the \nTribe, of which he is a member, “depend[s] on a number of plants that grow . . . near and within \nthe pipeline corridor, including the Lake Oahe crossing area, for prayer, ceremony, and \n  14\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 15 of 40\nmedicine,” and that “[o]peration of the Pipeline will harm . . . [the Tribe’s] sacred water, sacred \nburial sites, and . . . way of life and spirituality”).   \nSuch averments of use of the areas affected by the pipeline and allegations of specific \nharms that may befall declarants and the Tribe from DAPL’s presence are sufficient for Plaintiffs \nto establish injury in this case.  See Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 181; W. Land Exch. Project \nv. U.S. Bureau of Land Mgmt., 315 F. Supp. 2d 1068, 1078–79 (D. Nev. 2004) (finding standing \nunder NEPA when “colorable, if somewhat attenuated, geographical nexus between the areas \nvisited by [Plaintiff] and BLM’s action”).  Standing is thus no bar here. \n  4.  NHPA Claims \nThe Court last considers whether Plaintiffs’ NHPA claims should be dismissed as moot, \nin light of the fact that “construction is complete and oil is flowing.”  Standing Rock IV, 2017 \nWL 4564714, at *11.  The Tribe brings four claims for relief under the NHPA, alleging that: (1) \n“[i]n the development of the Corps Omaha EA[,] . . . [the] Corps violated the consultation \nrequirement contained in the NHPA” and unlawfully found that no historical properties would be \naffected by its actions; (2) “[i]n issuing NWP 12, [the] Corps violated . . . the NHPA,” and its \ndecision to approve NWP was thus “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in \naccordance with law”; (3) by “issu[ing] letters verifying more than 200 [pre-construction \nnotifications] for [DAPL] located in North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, and Illinois without \nmeaningfully consulting with the Tribe,” including “at least eleven of which are on the Tribe’s \naboriginal title lands,” the Corps violated the NHPA; and (4) the Corps violated the Act by \ndefining the area of potential effects “unlawfully narrowly” and thus failed to account for the fact \nthat “[t]he clearing, grading, excavation, and construction that would occur along [DAPL’s] \nroute would destroy . . . historic or culturally significant sites encountered.”  Compl., ¶¶ 91-92, \n  15\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 16 of 40\n103-104, 115-117, 122-129, 131-140.  Defendants respond that all of these counts are now moot, \nas “the alleged injury complained of . . . has already occurred and cannot be redressed by a \nfavorable judicial decision.”  Corps Reply at 10.  \n Article III of the U.S. Constitution limits federal courts to resolving actual cases or \ncontroversies and thus “prevents their passing on moot questions – ones where intervening \nevents make it impossible to grant the prevailing party effective relief.”  Burlington N. R.R. Co. \nv. Surface Transp. Bd., 75 F.3d 685, 688 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (citing Church of Scientology v. \nUnited States, 506 U.S. 9, 11 (1992)).  Put otherwise, mootness is established when no \nopportunity remains for the court to provide “any meaningful relief to Plaintiffs’ alleged \ninjuries.”  Sierra Club v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 803 F.3d 31, 44 (D.C. Cir. 2015) \n(quotation omitted).   \nHere, Plaintiffs claim that the Corps violated the NHPA’s requirement that a “federal \nagency . . . consult with Indian tribes that attach cultural or religious significance to property \naffected by the agency’s undertakings.”  Standing Rock III, 255 F. Supp. 3d at 155 (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted).  The Tribe alleged in its Complaint that, as a result of this \ninadequate consultation, DAPL’s ongoing construction would pose an impermissible risk to \ntribal sites.  The question now is whether, in light of DAPL’s completion, there remains any \nmeans by which the Court can still grant Plaintiffs “meaningful relief.”   \nThe Court concludes that the answer is in the negative.  The alleged “injuries” arising \nfrom Defendants’ NHPA violations are tethered to the timeline of DAPL’s construction and \noperation; in other words, tribal consultation and the granting of relevant federal permissions are \nactions that take place prior to the execution of a given project.  See Standing Rock I, 205 F. \nSupp. 3d at 7 (NHPA “encompasses sites of cultural or religious significance to Indian tribes and \n  16\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 17 of 40\nrequires that federal agencies consult with tribes prior to issuing permits that might affect these \nhistoric resources”).  Indeed, in its very first Opinion in this case, the Court found as much.  A \nyear and a half ago, addressing Standing Rock’s similar contention, this Court wrote that “[t]he \nrisk that construction may damage or destroy cultural resources is now moot for the 48% of the \npipeline that has already been completed.”  Id. at 35.  It noted that “whatever harms may have \noccurred from DAPL construction, the Court’s intervention . . . can no longer avoid them”; as a \nresult, for those sites at which construction was complete, the “die [was] cast.”  Id.  This \nconclusion, moreover, reflected Standing Rock’s own understanding of the Act, as the Tribe \nexplicitly acknowledged the potential for construction activities to moot its NHPA claims against \nDefendants.  See ECF No. 24 (Standing Rock Reply) at 19-20, 23-24 (stating that “should DAPL \nbe permitted to continue construction[,] . . . then the [] consultation process sought by the Tribe \nwould be rendered moot” and noting that such consultation would “no longer be meaningful in \nthose areas” in which “construction (including clearing and grading) has been completed”).   \nThe specter of mootness raised in Standing Rock’s earlier filings has now come to pass – \nconstruction is complete and oil is flowing through the pipeline.  This advancement in DAPL’s \ndevelopment in turn dooms Yankton’s NHPA efforts.  The Tribe’s first three claims mentioned \nabove are explicitly premised on alleged violations of the consultation requirements under § 106 \nof the Act.  Now that construction of the pipeline has occurred, the Court agrees with Defendants \n(and the Standing Rock Sioux) that such consultation would no longer be “meaningful.”  \nSimilarly, the Court is unable to order effective relief with respect to Plaintiff’s final NHPA \nclaim, which alleges that the Corps improperly defined the area of potential effects.  This count \nrelies on the Tribe’s assertion that “the clearing, grading, excavation, and construction that would \noccur along the duration of the [p]ipeline route would destroy any historic or culturally \n  17\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 18 of 40\nsignificant sites encountered.”  Compl., ¶ 139.  These construction-related activities have now \noccurred, and, accordingly, the potential for the preservation of historic or cultural sites no \nlonger exists.  Cf. Sierra Club, 803 F.3d at 43-44 (stating that, in the NEPA context, “claims \nrelating to the construction of [a] pipeline” may be moot and citing cases in which “the \ncompletion of the [challenged] project . . . eliminated the opportunity for any meaningful relief,” \nbut finding that claims “addressing the environmental impacts resulting from the enhanced use \nof” the pipeline remained viable). \nAlthough the Tribe asserts in its Reply that meaningful relief remains available because \nthe “risk of a spill through operation and maintenance of the Pipeline still . . . threatens the \nTribe’s cultural and historic sites,” such an emphasis on ongoing harms is nowhere to be found \nin Plaintiffs’ Complaint, nor are such prospective injuries supported by the record.  See Yankton \nReply at 3, 30-31; Benavides v. Hous. Auth. of San Antonio, Tex., 238 F.3d 667, 670 (5th Cir. \n2001) (dismissing NHPA claims as moot when challenged project was partially constructed and \n“there [was] no evidence on the record that further agency review could possibly affect” the \n“substantially-completed” project).  Instead, Plaintiffs’ NHPA claims and relevant declarations \nare predicated upon a concern with pre-construction consultation and assessments.  See Yankton \nReply at 29 (requesting relief under NHPA based on Defendants’ alleged errors in “identifying \nthe area of potential effects too narrowly and violat[ing] duties to consult with the Tribe . . . [on] \nprotection of historic and cultural locations”).  The time for such conversations and evaluations \nhas passed.  The Court therefore concludes that there are no “live remedial implications” to \nPlaintiffs’ claims.  See Sierra Club, 803 F.3d at 43; Finca Santa Elena, Inc. v. U.S. Army Corps \nof Engineers, 62 F. Supp. 3d 1, 5 (D.D.C. 2014) (discussing “long line of cases in the courts of \nappeal holding environmental challenges to completed construction projects to be moot”); Bayou \n  18\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 19 of 40\nLiberty Ass'n, Inc. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 217 F.3d 393, 397–98 (5th Cir. 2000) (finding \nno ability to grant “meaningful relief” when challenged construction had “been substantially \ncompleted”). \nThis conclusion is not altered, moreover, by the fact that the Tribe sought both injunctive \nand declaratory relief with respect to its NHPA claims.  See Compl. at 32-33.  Plaintiffs assert \nthat the Court is still able to grant its requested declaratory remedies, and that their NHPA claims \nthus remain viable.  See Yankton Reply at 31.  Yet, as is evident from the discussion above, any \ndeclaration by the Court at this point in time – after construction is complete and the clearing, \ngrading, and excavation have taken place – would be of no practical effect.  To issue declaratory \nrelief would be tantamount to issuing an advisory opinion, a result not within this Court’s power.  \nSee Weiss v. Sec'y of U.S. Dep't of Interior, 459 F. App'x 497, 500 (6th Cir. 2012) (dismissing \nNHPA claims as moot when “effects on the [site’s] historic character have already occurred,” as \nCourt could not “give any meaningful relief and any declaratory judgment would be an advisory \nopinion”) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted); Bayou Liberty Ass'n, 217 F.3d at 397–\n98 (finding request for declaratory judgment in NHPA suit after challenged construction had \noccurred “amounts to a request for an advisory opinion from this court”).  Because it can provide \nno meaningful remedy to address Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries arising from their NHPA claims, the \nCourt will dismiss the relevant counts of the Tribe’s Complaint as moot.  \nB.  NEPA  \nThe Court at last turns to what remains of the Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment – \ni.e., Plaintiffs’ NEPA claims.  The Tribe’s Motion focuses on Count VI of its Complaint, which \nalleges that federal Defendants “unlawfully piecemealed and segmented approval and analysis of \nthe Pipeline utilizing three separate EAs and FONSIs.”  Yankton Compl., ¶ 168.  Specifically, \n  19\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 20 of 40\nPlaintiffs allege that the Corps and FWS violated NEPA’s “anti-segmentation principle” by \nchoosing to issue discrete EAs for the various components of the pipeline requiring federal \npermissions.  Id., ¶ 166.  This principle seeks to prevent agencies from “avoid[ing] the NEPA \nrequirement that an EIS be prepared for all major federal actions with significant environmental \nimpacts by dividing an overall plan into component parts.”  Taxpayers Watchdog, Inc. v. \nStanley, 819 F.2d 294, 298 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  The Tribe claims that here, such “segmentation of \nFederal approvals” violated NEPA’s implementing regulation, 40 C.F.R. § 1508.25, which \naddresses the environmental analysis of “connected, cumulative, or similar” actions.  See \nYankton MSJ at 9-14.  Defendants respond that the decision to issue separate EAs and FONSIs \nwas well within their discretion.  See Corps Reply at 2. They assert that the three EAs at issue – \nthe Omaha Corps District, St. Louis Corps District, and FWS assessments – were not \n“connected” or “similar” actions, and that § 1508.25 thus did not require any omnibus analysis of \nthe various federal approvals.  \n  1.  Deference to Agencies \nIn evaluating the parties’ Cross-Motions, the Court begins with the question of deference.  \nAccording to federal Defendants, “[A]n agency’s scoping decision is entitled to deference,” \nincluding the Corps’ and FWS’s decision to “limit[] their review to areas within their \njurisdiction.”  Corps Opp. at 8.  Plaintiffs counter, somewhat confusingly, that because federal \nDefendants “are part of the same entity – the United States – and the United States is required to \nconduct the NEPA analysis,” no deference is due to the agencies’ independent scoping \ndeterminations.  See Yankton Reply at 13.  This line of argument is unavailing, as the scoping \nprocess clearly falls under the authority of each agency charged with conducting a NEPA \nanalysis.  As the Supreme Court has held, “An agency enjoys broad discretion in determining \n  20\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 21 of 40\nhow best to handle related, yet discrete, issues in terms of procedures and priorities.”  Mobil Oil \nExploration & Producing Se. Inc. v. United Distribution Cos., 498 U.S. 211, 230 (1991) \n(citations omitted); see also Weiss v. Kempthorne, 580 F. Supp. 2d 184, 188 (D.D.C. 2008) \n(discussing deference given to agency decision in context of NEPA’s connected-actions \nregulation); Thomas v. Peterson, 753 F.2d 754, 758 (9th Cir. 1985) (noting that agencies are \ngiven “considerable discretion” in defining scope of an environmental analysis), abrogated on \nother grounds by Cottonwood Envtl. Law Ctr. v. US Forest Serv., 789 F.3d 1075, 1090 (9th Cir. \n2015).  Plaintiffs’ suggestion that agency discretion is somehow subsumed by the ultimate \noversight of the “United States” is simply untethered from any legal support.  Similarly futile is \nthe Tribe’s contention that because “[s]coping informs the rest of the analysis[,] . . . a defective \nscoping should not be entitled to deference.”  Yankton Reply at 13-14.  This statement puts the \ncart of conclusion before the horse of deference.  In other words, the initial question is whether \nan agency’s scoping decision is due deference as a matter of law.  If so, the Court then considers \nwhether this presumption is rebutted by any arbitrary or capricious action during the \ndecisionmaking process.   \nHere, the Court agrees with Defendants that the Corps’ and FWS’s scoping \ndeterminations are entitled to deference under NEPA.  As this Circuit has held, “[T]he line-\ndrawing decisions necessitated” in agencies’ “treatment of [a] project’s relation to other \ngovernment activities” are “vested in the agencies, not the courts.”  Coal. on Sensible Transp., \nInc. v. Dole, 826 F.2d 60, 66 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  The “latters’ role,” therefore, “is simply to ensure \nthat” the agency’s scoping decision does not violate the law.  Id. (quotation omitted).  Indeed, \neven when an environmental analysis “addresses one of a series of closely related proposals, the \ndecision whether to prepare a programmatic impact statement is committed to the agency’s \n  21\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 22 of 40\ndiscretion.”  Grunewald v. Jarvis, 776 F.3d 893, 904-05 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  The Court addressed \nthis standard in Standing Rock I, when it held that the determination of “the scope of the effects” \nof federal permission related to DAPL fell “squarely within the expertise of the [agency]” and \nwas “entitled to deference under the APA.”  205 F. Supp. 3d at 31.  In light of this deferential \nstandard, it is up to Plaintiffs to show that the agencies acted “arbitrarily in refusing to prepare \none comprehensive” evaluation or in “determin[ing] the region, if any, with respect to which a \ncomprehensive statement is necessary.”  Kleppe v. Sierra Club, 427 U.S. at 412, 416; see \nGrunewald, 776 F.3d at 905 (in determining whether comprehensive environmental analysis was \n“necessary,” court will overturn agency decision only if it “is arbitrary and capricious”); Earth \nIsland Inst. v. Elliott, 2017 WL 5526572, at *13 (E.D. Cal. Nov. 17, 2017) (“A plaintiff must \nshow that an agency’s decision not to prepare a single EIS was an arbitrary action.”). \n  2.  Framework of Segmentation Analysis \nDeference thus established, the Court next discusses the general parameters of Plaintiffs’ \nclaim that the Corps and FWS impermissibly “segmented” their environmental analysis.   \nUnder NEPA, an agency acts unlawfully when it “divides connected, cumulative, or \nsimilar federal actions into separate projects and thereby fails to address the true scope and \nimpact of the activities that should be under consideration.”  Delaware Riverkeeper Network v. \nFERC, 753 F.3d 1304, 1314 (D.C. Cir. 2014); see PEACH v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 87 \nF.3d 1242, 1247 (11th Cir. 1996) (stating that anti-segmentation rule ensures agencies “cannot \nevade [their] responsibilities under [NEPA] by artificially dividing a major federal action into \nsmaller components, each without a significant impact”) (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted).   \n  22\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 23 of 40\nThe initial task in addressing a segmentation claim is identifying the “overall plan” or \n“major federal action” that has allegedly been sub-divided.  See Save Barton Creek Ass'n v. Fed. \nHighway Admin., 950 F.2d 1129, 1139 (5th Cir. 1992) (noting that “[t]he case law which deals \nwith . . . improper segmentation almost always involves a situation where a ‘major Federal \naction’ is found to exist and then the [issue] of segmentation is evaluated”).  Here, both sides \nstruggle somewhat with this definitional question.   \nAccording to Defendants, the Tribe is identifying the federal action at issue as “the entire \npipeline” project, see Corps Opp. at 9, which they contend is squarely precluded by the D.C. \nCircuit’s holding in Sierra Club, 803 F.3d at 44.  There, the court disagreed with the plaintiff’s \nposition that the Corps had violated NEPA by failing to conduct a “review of the entire pipeline” \nat issue.  Id. at 44.  It found instead that the “connected actions regulation . . . does not dictate \nthat NEPA review encompass private activity outside the scope of the sum of the geographically \nlimited federal actions.”  Id. at 49.  The court thus rejected the plaintiff’s contention that the \nentire pipeline, the vast majority of which fell outside federal control, should have been \naddressed in a programmatic environmental analysis.  Id. at 50-51.  \nThe Tribe, Defendants assert, is making “functionally the same argument” here.  See \nCorps Opp. at 9.  If Plaintiffs were in fact asserting that NEPA required a DAPL-wide \nassessment, the Corps would be correct in deeming such a claim futile.  The Tribe would, \nmoreover, be precluded from making such an argument not only by the holding in Sierra Club, \nbut also by one of the Court’s prior Opinions in this case.  In Standing Rock I, it rebuffed \nStanding Rock’s argument that federal Defendants were required to engage in a whole-pipeline \nanalysis.  The Court denied the need for any such comprehensive evaluation, finding that “a \nfederal agency with limited jurisdiction over specific activities related to a pipeline” is not \n  23\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 24 of 40\n“required to consider all the effects of the entire pipeline.”  205 F. Supp. 3d at 31; see also Sierra \nClub, Inc. v. Bostick, 787 F.3d 1043, 1051-54 (10th Cir. 2015) (holding Corps was not required \nto prepare NEPA analysis of entire pipeline when verifying permits for 485-mile oil pipeline \ncrossing over 2,000 waterways); Winnebago Tribe of Neb. v. Ray, 621 F.2d 269, 272-73 (8th \nCir. 1980) (concluding same for electric utility line). \nYet the Court believes that the Yankton Sioux’s segmentation claim is more nuanced \nthan Defendants contend.  Although the Tribe certainly confuses the matter somewhat by \nreferring repeatedly to the “entire pipeline project” and the “impacts of the [p]ipeline,” it also \nraises the narrower argument that NEPA required a “comprehensive agency action review of the \nconnected and similar federal actions” related to DAPL.  See Yankton Reply at 1, 8, 10; Yankton \nMSJ at 6 (emphasis added).  Plaintiffs contrast this claim with “whole pipeline review,” \nexplaining that they are limiting their challenge to the series of actions within federal permitting \nauthority.  See Yankton Reply at 9-10.   \nThis narrower claim, contrary to Defendants’ assertions, is not precluded by Sierra Club.  \nRather, it fits within a line of argument explicitly left open by that opinion.  As the court there \nnoted, plaintiff had, at oral argument, advanced the claim that “the connected action regulation \nrequire[s] that the federal actions in this case – the easements, the other areas within federal \njurisdiction” – should have been considered connected and “analyzed together” under NEPA.  \nSee 803 F.3d at 51.  The court stated that such a claim “for NEPA analysis limited to the \n[federal] verification and easement areas” was “an accurate statement of the connected actions \ndoctrine.”  Id. at 44, 51.  Because plaintiffs had forfeited such an argument below, however, the \nCircuit “had no occasion to consider it.”  Id. at 51, 44.  \n  24\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 25 of 40\nFor this Court, then, the decision in Sierra Club serves only to identify a lacuna in the \nbinding precedent – how to apply the anti-segmentation rule to federal actions encompassed \nwithin a larger, private project.  Here, Plaintiffs are challenging federal Defendants’ decision to \nissue “three separate and distinct EAs, three separate and distinct FONSIs, and one categorical \nexclusion classification for their own respective actions related to the Pipeline project,” in lieu of \na consolidated analysis of all such federal permissions related to DAPL.  See Yankton MSJ at 11.  \nThis limited anti-segmentation claim appears to fit within the narrow opening left ajar by the \nholdings of Sierra Club and this Court’s prior Opinion.  See Sierra Club, 803 F. 3d at 49 \n(recognizing potentially viable claim that an agency “unlawfully failed to perform NEPA \nanalysis on sections . . . short of the entire length of the pipeline” that fell under federal control).  \nThe Court treats in turn the Tribe’s arguments on “connected actions” and “similar actions.” \n3.   Connected Actions \nHaving established the framework of the anti-segmentation rule and the parameters of \nPlaintiffs’ NEPA claims, the Court begins with the Tribe’s allegation that Defendants violated \nthe Act’s implementing regulation, 40 C.F.R. § 1508.25, by not treating the DAPL-related \npermissions as “connected” actions requiring a programmatic environmental analysis.   \nUnder § 1508.25(a)(1), connected actions are those that “(i) automatically trigger other \nactions which may require [an EIS]; (ii) cannot or will not proceed unless other actions are taken \npreviously or simultaneously; or (iii) are interdependent parts of a larger action and depend on \nthe larger action for their justification.”  Although Defendants argue that this regulation applies \nonly to EIS analyses, and not EAs (as were issued in this case), this contention conflicts with \nCircuit precedent stating that “when determining the contents of an EA or an EIS, an agency \nmust consider all connected actions.”  Delaware Riverkeeper, 753 F.3d at 1314 (emphasis \n  25\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 26 of 40\nadded).  The Court will therefore proceed with the assumption that, if the various DAPL \npermissions are in fact “connected actions” under NEPA, Defendants were required to include \nthem within the scope of a consolidated environmental review – whether it took the form of an \nEIS or an EA.    \nSo, are the discrete federal permissions here in fact “connected”?  Plaintiffs offer four \nmajor arguments in favor of finding such a relationship: (1) the federal projects do not have \n“substantial independent utility”; (2) the approval of each federal permit constrained the \nconsideration of alternatives for other portions of the pipeline; (3) the permits and permissions \nwere “justified by” a larger federal action; and (4) the federal projects are “interdependent” and \nhave a “synergistic” environmental effect.  The Court addresses each separately. \na.  Substantial Independent Utility  \nUnder this Circuit’s decision in Taxpayers, federal projects can only be analyzed \nseparately if each project has, inter alia, “substantial independent utility.”  819 F. 2d at 298.  In \nother words, this test asks “whether one project will serve a significant purpose even if a second \nrelated project is not built.”  Hammond v. Norton, 370 F. Supp. 2d 226, 247 (D.D.C. 2005) \n(quoting Coal. on Sensible Transp., 826 F.2d at 69).  On this issue, Plaintiffs argue that “no \nseparate component of the Pipeline considered by Federal Defendants and analyzed in three \nseparate EAs can possibly have independent utility” because “[i]f one federal approval for the \nPipeline had been denied, Pipeline construction could not have been completed and the whole \nproject would have been rendered utterly useless.”  Yankton MSJ at 13.   \nThis line of argument, as Defendants accurately note, ignores the facts on the ground.  \nMost significantly, 97% of DAPL runs through private land.  This means that vast swaths of the \npipeline could be constructed without any federal permissions or permits whatsoever, and that, if \n  26\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 27 of 40\na given federal authorization was denied for a portion of the remaining 3%, the project could be \nre-routed to avoid the contentious crossing or easement.  See Standing Rock I, 205 F. Supp. 3d at \n32 (noting that “the route taken by the pipeline through private lands . . . is driven by factors that \nhave little to do with the discrete activities that the Corps needs to permit”).  Indeed, such re-\nrouting occurred throughout the lifespan of the pipeline project, including in response to the \nfindings of the FWS EA.  See FWS EA at 7, 13-16 (discussing route modifications and \nalternatives); Standing Rock I, 205 F. Supp. 3d at 14 (noting that pipeline route was “modified \n140 times in North Dakota alone to avoid potential cultural resources”); Exh. Y (Letter from \nJackie Rodgers of Osage Nation confirming DAPL reroute at Mississippi River crossing); Corps \nOpp. at 14 n.7 (noting prior re-routing).  Far from rendering the “whole project . . . entirely \nuseless,” the denial of one federal approval could simply result in a shift in the pipeline’s course.   \nIt follows, therefore, that each discrete federal permission had “substantial independent \nutility,” as each would allow that portion of the pipeline to proceed as planned, while any denial \nwould result in re-routing – with no apparent impact on the other federally regulated components \nof the project.  Cf. City of Williams v. Dombeck, 151 F. Supp. 2d 9, 19–20 (D.D.C. 2001) \n(finding water-transportation system connected to larger federal action because construction of \nwater pipeline “[would] not proceed unless [the other action] proceeds previously or \nsimultaneously”) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nThe limited federal involvement with DAPL and the potential for re-routing additionally \ndistinguishes this case from Delaware Riverkeeper, upon which Plaintiffs rely.  In that case, the \nprojects at issue addressed upgrades to a natural-gas pipeline, meaning that a federal agency – \nFERC – had jurisdiction over projects along its entire length.  See 753 F.3d at 1307-08.  Because \nFERC was tasked with analyzing the environmental impacts of construction and operation for \n  27\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 28 of 40\nthe whole pipeline, there was simply no way for it to be re-routed so as to not require agency \napproval.  Id. at 1308 (noting that the approvals were “physically, functionally, and financially \nconnected and interdependent”).  If FERC had approved certain segments and denied others, the \nproject could not proceed.  As the court in Delaware Riverkeeper found, each phase of the \npipeline’s approval and permitting process “fit with the others like puzzle pieces,” and thus the \n“agency was obliged to assess the entire pipeline for environment[al] effects.”  Id. at 1319.   \n DAPL, by contrast, is not so beholden to overall federal approval; as this Court noted in \nStanding Rock I, “[N]o permitting” does not mean “no pipeline.”  205 F. Supp. 3d at 31.  The \nproject’s construction and routing could instead be tailored or modified to avoid problematic \nfederal lands or water.  Id.  This conclusion remains as true today as when the Court issued its \nfirst Opinion in this case.  It follows, therefore, that the Corps’ and FWS’s actions related to the \npipeline have “substantial independent utility.”  The denial of one federal approval for this \npipeline does not preclude, or even necessarily affect, the remaining federal actions.   \nb.  Consideration of Alternatives \n   The Tribe next posits that “each approval issued [by the Corps and FWS] sufficiently \nconstrained the consideration of alternatives for other portions of the pipeline to mandate \nconsideration of all approvals in a single NEPA document.”  Yankton MSJ at 13.  According to \nPlaintiffs, the “approval of one segment clearly foreclosed the opportunity to consider other \nreasonable alternatives, as the approval of one segment at a specific location decreased route \noptions for other segments of the pipeline.”  Id.  Defendants counter that their consideration of \nalternatives to each permit and permission was not so constrained, pointing to the fact that the \nEAs each “contains a section devoted to alternatives to the federal action.”  DA Opp. at 19 \n  28\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 29 of 40\nDefendants have the better of this argument.  Indeed, a review of the three EAs at issue \ndemonstrates that the two Corps districts and FWS clearly considered a full panoply of \nalternatives – including, in each case, a “no-action” alternative that consisted of a scenario in \nwhich the pipeline was not constructed.  See Omaha Dist. EA at 12-13; St. Louis Dist. EA at 12-\n15; FWS EA at 15.  As made evident by the agencies’ analyses, the approval for any one \ncrossing or permission did not restrict the consideration of different route options or alternatives \nfor the other proposed actions.  See also Coal. on Sensible Transp., 826 F.2d at 69 (rejecting \nclaim that project approval would “restrict consideration of alternatives for related projects” \nbecause no indication that each permission would “effectively commit [federal] decisionmakers \nto a future course of action”). \nc.  Larger Federal Action \nPlaintiffs next assert that the various federal permits and permissions are “connected” \nbecause they “are justified by a larger federal action” – that is, but for an overarching federal \nproject, the discrete approvals would not have been required.  They contend that the actions of \nthe Corps and FWS were “clearly parts of a larger action,” stating that “the permits and \npermissions issued by Federal Defendants were part of, and justified by, the . . . greater \nimplementation of the Pipeline.”  Yankton Reply at 10-11.  Yet, as discussed above, any \nsuggestion that DAPL as a whole constitutes a “federal action” is unavailing in light of Sierra \nClub and Standing Rock II.  The narrower question, therefore, is whether the federal permits and \npermissions were justified by any larger federal action and thus required a consolidated NEPA \nanalysis.  See Yankton Reply at 12 (acknowledging that Tribe “do[es] not argue that the entire \npipeline should have been analyzed, but rather, that the permits and permissions . . . should have \nbeen analyzed together in a single NEPA process”); see also Sierra Club v. U.S. Army Corps, 64 \n  29\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 30 of 40\nF. Supp. 3d 128, 154 (D.D.C. 2014), aff’d, 803 F.3d 31 (stating that “connected actions \nregulation requires that the impact on the environment of all aspects of a particular major federal \naction be evaluated together”) (emphasis added).  \nHere, Plaintiffs can identify no such overarching federal project upon which the various \npermissions rely.  Instead, the record is clear that federal permission was needed for only limited, \ndiscrete components of DAPL’s construction.  See Corps Opp. at 10 (noting that “there was no \nsingle proposal for the pipeline submitted to Corps and FWS”).  Although all of the federal \nauthorizations were part of the pipeline project, the project was not itself a federal undertaking.  \nSee Sierra Club, 803 F.3d at 49 (noting that while oil pipeline at issue was “undoubtedly a single \nphysically, functionally, and financially connected project,” “less than five percent [was] subject \nto federal review,” and thus agency was not required to evaluate impact of entire pipeline) \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  This again distinguishes the facts of this case from those of \nDelaware Riverkeeper, in which FERC had jurisdiction over the entire pipeline, and each related \npermission was thus contingent upon the agency’s approval of the pipeline’s overall certification.  \nThe agency actions at issue here, by contrast, are not “justified by” or reliant upon any broader \nfederal permission.  See Sierra Club v. US Army Corps of Eng’rs, 990 F. Supp. 2d 9, 37 (D.D.C. \n2013) (noting “general reluctance to conclude that federal action with respect to a small portion \nof a pipeline” is sufficient to “federalize the entire project”). \nd.  Synergistic Effect \nLast, the Tribe is unable to demonstrate that the discrete federal permissions were \n“interdependent” or that they had any “synergistic effect.”  Plaintiffs cite to Kleppe v. Sierra \nClub, 427 U.S. 390 (1976), which held that proposals that have a “synergistic environmental \nimpact upon a region . . . must be considered together.”  Id. at 410.  Here, however, the Tribe is \n  30\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 31 of 40\nunable to identify any such synergy connecting the discrete DAPL permissions.  Each of the EAs \nand FONSIs addresses geographically isolated crossings or easements, and there is no suggestion \nin the record that environmental impacts in one location would have repercussions for another.  \nIndeed, it is difficult to imagine how the construction of a river crossing in Illinois could possibly \naffect the environment at Lake Oahe, which is located hundreds miles away and separated by the \nstates of Iowa and South Dakota.  See DA Opp. at 1 (Map 1).  This, therefore, is not a case in \nwhich the environmental impacts or harms arising from a set of discrete federal permissions \nwould, if combined, be greater than the sum of the parts.  \nThis lack of interaction between the sites addressed in each EA distinguishes this case \nfrom NRDC v. Hodel, 865 F.2d 288 (D.C. Cir. 1988).  Hodel involved the federal review of \npermissions for a series of offshore drilling leases in two ecologically sensitive locations.  Id. at \n297.  The Secretary of the Interior had determined that each lease would not have a significant \nenvironmental effect, a conclusion plaintiff challenged under § 1508.25.  Id. at 298.  The court in \nHodel agreed.  It held that the Secretary had erred by separately evaluating the lease permissions \nbecause, acting together, the discrete drilling locations would affect marine mammals and \nmigratory species.  Id. at 299-300.  While a single drilling lease may not have had such effect, \nthe court found that the actions were connected by their interdependent and synergistic impacts.  \nBy failing to consider the cumulative effects of all the leases, the Secretary impermissibly \nignored the actual environmental repercussions of granting the multiple permissions.  \nHere, by contrast, the permissions at issue are for ecologically distinct waters and lands.  \nCounter to Plaintiffs’ assertion that the sites are “interdependent,” Yankton MSJ at 14, there is \nno indication that DAPL’s passage through one crossing or easement would have spillover \nenvironmental effects at another.  The Court, consequently, finds no basis upon which to deem \n  31\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 32 of 40\nthe federal approvals “interdependent” or as having any synergistic environmental impact.  See \nEarth Island Inst., 2017 WL 5526572, at *14 (separate NEPA review appropriate where actions \nin question were located in different watersheds on opposite sides of Greenhorn Mountains). \n    4.   Similar Actions \nIn addition to maintaining that the approvals were “connected actions,” Plaintiffs assert \nthat the Corps’ and FWS’s assessments were “similar actions” under § 1504.25.  The Court \nbegins with the threshold issue of whether the Tribe has in fact forfeited this claim.  According to \nDefendants, the “similar actions” contention is unavailable, as “neither Plaintiffs nor any other \ncommenter raised the argument that FWS and the Corps’ actions should be considered together \nas ‘similar actions,’” Corps Opp. at 13 n.5, and “[i]t is well-established that issues not raised in \ncomments before the agency are waived.”  DA Opp. at 24 (quoting Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n v. EPA, \n286 F.3d 554, 562 (D.C. Cir. 2002)).  In response, the Tribe asserts that it need not have \nidentified the similar-actions claim during the comment period “because a different entity . . .  \nhad explicitly raised the issue.”  Yankton Reply at 25.  Plaintiffs then refer to a lone comment on \nthe proposed St. Louis District EA that quoted the text of § 1508.25, including the “connected, \ncumulative, or similar actions” language.  Id. at 27 (citing St. Louis EA, Comment 2-2).  \nPlaintiffs also argue that, regardless of whether the similar-actions argument was raised in \ncomments, the Court should not consider it forfeited because it falls within the realm of those “so \nobvious that there is no need for a commentator to point [it] out specifically in order to preserve \nits ability to challenge a proposed action.”  Id. at 28 (quoting Dep’t of Transp. v. Pub. Citizen, \n541 U.S. 752, 765 (2004)). \nAfter examining the underlying record, the Court agrees with Defendants that the \n“similar actions” issue was not raised “with sufficient specificity reasonably to alert the agency” \n  32\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 33 of 40\nduring the comment period.  See Tex Tin Corp. v. EPA, 935 F.2d 1321, 1323 (D.C. Cir. 1991).  \nThe single mention of the word “similar” in the comments appears to be the one Plaintiffs cite \nfrom the St. Louis EA, which arises in the context of reciting verbatim the full language of § \n1504.25.  Neither that comment, nor any other, makes any attempt to apply that “similar actions” \ntext to the DAPL decisionmaking process or argues that federal Defendants erred in failing to \nconsider their respective permissions and permits under that prong of the regulation.  As \nDefendants acknowledge, this is in contrast to the “connected actions” issue, which was \nexplicitly raised and addressed in depth by a number of commenters.  See, e.g., Exh. 14 (Sierra \nClub Comment) (discussing § 1504.25, but addressing only “connected actions” prong of \nregulation).  While the Tribe is correct that it may rely on the comments of other entities in \narguing against waiver, see Nat. Res. Def. Council v. EPA, 824 F.2d 1146, 1151 (D.C. Cir. \n1987), here it cannot show that any entity sufficiently raised the “similar actions” claim before \nthe agencies so as to give them notice of the issue.  See Northside Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v. \nThomas, 849 F.2d 1516, 1519 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (holding that “by neglecting timely to put the \n[agency] on proper notice of its objections, [Plaintiff] has forfeited its right to have this court \nexamine those objections on the merits”). \nSimilarly, Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that the issue is “so obvious” that it need not \nhave been pointed out in order to be preserved as a basis for a later legal challenge.  See Dep't of \nTransp., 541 U.S. at 765.  Indeed, it stands to reason that if the “similar actions” argument was so \nself-evident, the multiple commenters who addressed the issue of segmentation would have at \nleast referred to such an allegedly straightforward claim.  The fact that the comments instead \ndiscussed only the “connected actions” prong of § 1508.25 speaks to the relative obscurity of the \n“similar actions” issue.  Because no commenter made any substantive contention that the \n  33\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 34 of 40\nagencies’ actions were similar, and because such an argument was not “obvious,” the Court will \ndeem this issue forfeited.  \n  Out of an abundance of caution, however, the Court also notes that even if this claim \nwere preserved, the Tribe would still not prevail.  Under § 1508.25, similar actions are those that, \n“when viewed with other reasonably foreseeable or proposed agency actions, have similarities \nthat provide a basis for evaluating their environmental consequences together, such as common \ntiming or geography.”  Plaintiffs contend that the federal permissions at issue in this case share \nsuch a resemblance.  In particular, the Tribe focuses on the “common timing” of the Corps’ and \nFWS’s actions, noting that the agencies’ decisionmaking processes “took place at roughly the \nsame time,” with the relevant federal permits and permissions issued within a span of ten \nmonths.  See Yankton MSJ at 15; Reply at 19.   \nSimultaneity of agency actions is not, however, dispositive of their similarity.  Instead, § \n1508.25 clearly states that the ultimate question is whether a set of actions “ha[s] similarities that \nprovide a basis for evaluating their environmental consequences” in a single assessment.  As this \nCircuit has put it, a comprehensive analysis is appropriate under § 1508.25 when the \n“sufficiently similar character of actions is such that [a programmatic analysis] is the ‘best way’ \nto assess their combined impacts.”  Coal. on Sensible Transp., 826 F.2d at 70 n.8 (citation \nomitted).  Such a standard does not, contrary to the Tribe’s suggestion, mandate that all actions \nwith temporal proximity are “best” assessed in a single EIS or EA.  \nThe implementing regulation, moreover, also lists common geography as another \npotential indicator of similarity – a factor that, in this case, cuts against finding such \ncommonality between the DAPL-related permissions.  As discussed above, the three EAs and \nFONSIs were for geographically and ecologically distinct areas of federal control.  As \n  34\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 35 of 40\nDefendants note, the assessments addressed actions that were “not physically connected” and \ninstead were “spread over hundreds of miles across multiple states.”  Corps Opp. at 16.  The \npermissions and permits, moreover, were for different environmental resources: the Omaha \nDistrict EA addressed the crossing of Lakes Oahe and Sakakawea; the St. Louis EA looked at a \nseries of lake, creek, and channel crossings and drainage districts in Illinois; and the FWS EA \nwas concerned with the agency’s jurisdiction over wetland and grassland easements.  \n Such geographic isolation and ecological diversity, the Corps contends, defeat any \nsuggestions of similarity between the federal actions.  Plaintiffs counter that “[w]hile the \ngeographic locations for the various agency actions are not the same, they all occurred along the \nsame linear pipeline route,” and thus “[t]here can be no doubt that Federal Defendants’ actions \nwere ‘similar.’”  Yankton MSJ at 16 (emphasis omitted).  The Court does not share the Tribe’s \ncertainty on this issue.  Instead, it finds that the geographic and substantive differences among \nthe three actions demonstrate that they are not “similar” within the meaning of § 1508.25.   \nPlaintiffs also vaguely allude to other alleged similarities among the DAPL-related \nactions.  Although it focuses largely on the temporal overlap between the various federal \npermissions, the Tribe asserts that “Defendants’ actions involved the same singular pipeline \nwhich would transport the same crude oil, rendering the actions’ potential impacts similar if not \nidentical.”  Yankton MSJ at 15.  Again, this argument does not reflect the reality of the pipeline \n– a project that spans four states over its 1,200-mile route.  The discrete parcels of federal lands \nand easements the pipeline encounters along this corridor are not, simply by virtue of being in \nDAPL’s path, “similar.”  Indeed, one need only reference the EAs at issue in this case to \nunderstand that, far from presenting “identical” environmental considerations, each federal \npermission reflects site-specific and distinct ecological concerns.  Although the pipeline may be \n  35\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 36 of 40\na “singular” private undertaking, its environmental impacts and the related federal assessments \nare far more diverse.  \n* * * \nIn sum, the Court concludes that Defendants’ environmental assessments are not \n“connected” or “similar” federal actions.  Instead, they are discrete analyses that address \necologically and geographically disparate areas of federal jurisdiction.  The Corps and FWS, \naccordingly, were under no obligation to consider these authorizations together.  The Court \nobserves, moreover, that a major rationale for the anti-segmentation rule is especially \ninapplicable in this case.  Enforcement of the principle seeks, in large part, to prevent agencies \nfrom disguising the actual environmental impacts of a given governmental project by dividing \nthe action into artificially created components.  See Macht v. Skinner, 715 F.Supp. 1131, 1135 \n(D.D.C. 1989), aff'd, 889 F.2d 291 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (anti-segmentation principle serves to “weed \nout projects which are pretextually segmented, and for which there is no independent reason to \nexist”).  Yet this is not a case in which a broader agency action was fragmented into arbitrary \nparts in order to hide its total environmental effect.  DAPL is a largely private project, and \nDefendants’ decision to treat the limited federal involvement with the pipeline as discrete agency \nactions evinces no bad faith or attempt to circumvent NEPA’s environmental protections.  Such a \ndetermination was instead a reasonable exercise of the agencies’ discretion, and the Court will \ntherefore defer to Defendants’ decision to conduct three separate EAs and FONSIs in this case.  \nC.  Harmless Error \nFinally, even if Defendants’ actions did violate NEPA, the Court concludes that such \nviolations did not prejudice Plaintiffs, as there is no indication that the agencies would have \nreached a different outcome if they had in fact considered the DAPL-related actions in toto.  \n  36\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 37 of 40\nThe Tribe argues that the Court should not apply harmless-error doctrine in this context, \nnoting that certain cases finding improper segmentation of NEPA analyses have not explicitly \naddressed the question of prejudice.  See Yankton Reply at 21.  Yet just because other courts \nhave not applied harmless error does not prevent this Court from doing so.  Rather, the inquiry \ninto whether a NEPA plaintiff suffered prejudice is well established in the relevant precedent.  \nSee, e.g., Pub. Employees for Envtl. Responsibility v. Hopper, 827 F.3d 1077, 1087–88 (D.C. \nCir. 2016) (applying harmless-error analysis in NEPA context); Save Our Heritage, Inc. v. FAA, \n269 F.3d 49, 59–62 (1st Cir. 2001) (same); Laguna Greenbelt, Inc. v. U.S. Dep't of Transp., 42 \nF.3d 517, 527 (9th Cir. 1994) (same).  \nDefendants assert that the Tribe has identified “no concrete environmental impact that \nwas missed by the alleged segmenting of the discrete permissions” by the Corps and FWS.  See \nCorps Opp. at 17-18.  The Court agrees.  The Tribe describes the actual impact of Defendants’ \nallegedly improper segmentation in only the vaguest of terms, stating that the use of separate \nanalyses left the Tribe “with no means to truly understand or weigh in on the vast cumulative \nimpacts this project can and will have on the human environment” and generally alleging that by \nusing three separate EAs, Defendants “concealed the cumulative environmental impacts of the \nproject.”  Yankton MSJ at 2.   \nYet there is no indication in the record that Defendants “concealed” any cumulative \nenvironmental impacts or that they “faile[ed] to do the analysis . . . to determine the cumulative \nimpacts” of all of the federal actions.  See Yankton Reply at 5-6.  On the contrary, each of the \nthree EAs contains a section explicitly titled “cumulative impacts,” discussing the potential \ncumulative effects of each permission and addressing the potential for the relevant permit to \ninteract with other federal actions – including those related to the pipeline.  See Omaha EA at 98-\n  37\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 38 of 40\n107; FWS EA at 33-35; St. Louis EA and FONSI at 83-94.  If the agencies were attempting to \n“hid[e] the ball” as to DAPL’s cumulative impacts, see Yankton MSJ at 19, they did a poor job \nindeed.    \nBeyond providing no evidence of Defendants’ alleged “concealment,” Plaintiffs have not \nidentified any actual harms that arose from the division of the agencies’ analysis.  The goal of \nNEPA is to ensure that the public is provided with relevant information and the opportunity to \nparticipate in agency decisionmaking.  See Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 \nU.S. 332, 349 (1989) (NEPA “guarantees that the relevant information will be made available to \nthe larger audience that may also play a role in both the decision-making process and the \nimplementation of that decision”).  In this case, Plaintiffs provide no explanation as to how \nDefendants’ alleged segmentation of the DAPL-related permissions frustrated such ends.   \nIn fact, the high volume of comments and active public dialogue throughout the \npermitting process undermine any conclusion that NEPA’s participatory goals were somehow \nstymied by the use of three separate EAs.  See Yankton MSJ at 5 (acknowledging “multitude of \ncomments” regarding Defendants’ actions).  Although the Tribe may have preferred that the \nassessments be combined into a single document, there is no indication in the record that such \nconsolidation would have had any meaningful effect.  Plaintiffs, like the rest of the public, seem \nto have had no difficulty reviewing the three discrete documents – or voicing their concerns \nregarding the agencies’ conclusions.  See Nevada v. Dep't of Energy, 457 F.3d 78, 90–91 (D.C. \nCir. 2006) (finding lack of prejudice from alleged NEPA violation when “[t]he many comments \nsubmitted in response to the []EIS manifest that the public had sufficient information to \ncomment”).  \n  38\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 39 of 40\nContrary to the Tribe’s assertion that “had [Defendants] not broken the analysis into three \npieces, it would seem a foregone conclusion that the cumulative impact would have easily \ncrossed the threshold for requiring an EIS” rather than an EA, see Yankton Reply at 5, the record \nin this case does not support such an assumption.  Because the Tribe is unable to specifically \nexplicate, much less demonstrate, how Defendants’ discrete analyses “inherently lowered the \nlevel of environmental review that they conducted,” id. at 22, the Court is unconvinced that any \nomnibus assessment would have altered the agencies’ analysis.  As Plaintiffs can demonstrate no \nactual harm arising from the use of the three EAs, the Court concludes that any improper \nsegmentation in this case constitutes harmless error.  \n* * * \nAs a final note, the Court observes that its conclusions today are not necessarily the end \nof the road for the Yankton Sioux’s involvement with DAPL.  As of October 20, 2017, the Tribe \nhas been contacted by Defendants and asked to provide input during the ongoing remand \nanalysis.  See ECF No. 306, Exh. 1 (Letter from Corps requesting information from Yankton to \nassist in remand).  Plaintiffs will therefore have the opportunity to voice their remaining \nconcerns regarding the Corps’ environmental assessments and, if they choose, to engage in an \nactive dialogue with Defendants as this case continues to move forward. \nIV.  Conclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court will deny Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment, \ngrant Defendants’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment, and dismiss Plaintiffs’ Count I as \nmoot.  A contemporaneous Order so stating will issue this day.  \n.  \n \n  39\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 341   Filed 03/19/18   Page 40 of 40\n/s/ James E. Boasberg \n            JAMES E.

Civil Action No. 16-1534 (JEB) (and \nConsolidated Case Nos. 16-1769 and \n16-267) \nU.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS,    \n   \nDefendant, \n \n            and \n \nDAKOTA ACCESS, LLC, \n \n  Defendant-Intervenor and Cross-    \n            Claimant. \n \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \n \nThe dispute over the Dakota Access Pipeline has now taken nearly as many twists and \nturns as the 1,200-mile pipeline itself.  On June 14, 2017, in its third Opinion on the case, this \nCourt held that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had failed to fully follow the National \nEnvironmental Protection Act when it determined that the pipeline would not have a significant \nenvironmental impact.  Although the Court found that the agency had “substantially complied” \nwith the statute, the Opinion identified three discrete deficiencies in the Corps’ analysis and \n  1\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 284   Filed 10/11/17   Page 2 of 28\nremanded the matter to the agency for further evaluation.  In doing so, the Court asked the \nparties to submit further briefing on the question such an action raised: what is the proper remedy \nduring this remand period?  Specifically, the Court must determine whether or not to vacate the \nCorps’ environmental assessment, as well as the easement granted to Dakota Access in reliance \non that determination.  Without such an easement, the oil cannot flow through the pipeline.   \nThe propriety of vacatur during remand is determined by a two-prong test that requires \nthe Court to consider (1) the seriousness of the deficiencies in the agency action and (2) the \ndisruptive consequences of vacating that prior approval.  As to the first, the Court ultimately \nconcludes that the three errors identified in the prior Opinion are not fundamental or incurable \nflaws in the Corps’ original analysis; rather, the agency has a significant possibility of justifying \nits prior determinations on remand.  Although the Court finds that the equities of disruption do \nnot tip sharply in Defendants’ favor on the second factor, prevailing on the first is enough here \nfor them to avoid vacatur.  \nI.   Procedural History  \nThe lengthy factual history of this case is set forth in this Court’s prior Opinion, Standing \nRock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Standing Rock III), 2017 WL 2573994 \n(D.D.C. June 14, 2017), and need not be repeated here.  Suffice it to say that Plaintiffs, the \nStanding Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux Tribes (and other intervenors and consolidated \nPlaintiffs), strongly oppose the current route of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), a nearly \n1,200-mile domestic pipeline running from North Dakota to Illinois.  In particular, the Tribes \nprotest DAPL’s crossing at Lake Oahe, a federally regulated body of water that borders their \nreservations.  Created by the Corps in 1958 via a dam constructed on the Missouri River, the \n  2\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 284   Filed 10/11/17   Page 3 of 28\nLake is a primary source of water for the Tribes, and it is considered sacred to their spiritual \npractices.  Id. at *3. \nA.          History of Litigation \nFor the past fourteen months, the Tribes have attempted to prevent oil from flowing \nunder Lake Oahe.  The instant case began on July 25, 2016, when Standing Rock filed its \nComplaint against the Corps for declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to the National \nHistoric Preservation Act, National Environmental Policy Act, Clean Water Act, and the River \nand Harbors Act.  See ECF No. 1 (SRST Complaint), ¶¶ 128-212.  The following month, Dakota \nAccess LLC successfully moved to intervene in support of the Corps, see ECF No. 7, and the \nCheyenne River Sioux Tribe intervened as a Plaintiff, subsequently filing its own Complaint.  \nSee ECF No. 11-12 (CRST Complaint).  The Tribes’ first pass at preventing the pipeline was a \nmotion for a preliminary injunction based solely on the NHPA, asserting that the ongoing \nclearing and grading of the land along DAPL’s route disrupted sacred Tribal sites.  See Standing \nRock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Standing Rock I), 205 F. Supp. 3d 4, 8–9 \n(D.D.C. 2016).  On September 9, 2016, the Court denied emergency relief, and construction \nproceeded.  Id. at 37.   \nOn February 8, 2017, the Corps finally granted Dakota Access an easement pursuant to \nthe Mineral Leasing Act, authorizing it to cross federal lands at Lake Oahe and complete the \npipeline.  See ECF No. 172-11 (Easement).  The next day, Cheyenne River filed a motion for \npreliminary injunction and an application for a temporary restraining order, this time alleging \nviolations of RFRA.  See ECF Nos. 98, 99; Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers (Standing Rock II), 239 F. Supp. 3d 77, 81 (D.D.C. 2017), appeal dismissed, No. 17-\n5043, 2017 WL 4071136 (D.C. Cir. May 15, 2017).  Believing these religious-freedom claims \n  3\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 284   Filed 10/11/17   Page 4 of 28\nunlikely to succeed, the Court issued a second Opinion denying the preliminary injunction.  See \nStanding Rock II, 239 F. Supp. 3d at 80.  \nB.        Motions for Summary Judgment  \nAs these emergency motions were ongoing, the parties filed cross-motions for summary \njudgment.  See ECF Nos. 117 (SRST MSJ); 131 (CRST MSJ); 172 (Corps MSJ); 185 (DA MSJ).  \nNow focusing on their environmental claims, the Tribes challenged the Corps’ decision to issue \nthe easement on the basis of its July 25, 2016, Environmental Assessment (EA) and Mitigated \nFinding of No Significant Impact (FONSI), asserting that the agency had violated NEPA by \nfailing to complete an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).  NEPA requires that federal \nagencies evaluate the environmental effects of major government actions, but it does not \n“mandate particular results.”  Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 350 \n(1989).  Instead, the statute “imposes only procedural requirements.”  Dep’t of Transp. v. Public \nCitizen, 541 U.S. 752, 756 (2004).  If a project will “significantly” affect the “quality of the \nhuman environment,” NEPA requires that the agency complete a detailed EIS.  See 42 U.S.C. § \n4332(C).  To determine whether or not there will be such significant effects, however, the agency \nfirst prepares a shorter EA.  This “concise public document” discusses the need for the proposal, \nthe alternatives, the environmental impacts of the proposed action, and the agencies and persons \nconsulted.  See 40 C.F.R. § 1508.9(b).  If the EA concludes that there will be no significant \nenvironmental impact, the agency may forgo completing a full EIS. \nThis was the route chosen by the Corps in this case.  See ECF Nos. 172-1, 172-2 (EA and \nFONSI).  The agency’s EA and FONSI explained that, given the proposed mitigation measures \nand Defendants’ assessment of DAPL’s “anticipated environmental, economic, cultural . . . \nsocial[, and] cumulative effects,” the pipeline’s crossing at Lake Oahe would not “significantly \n  4\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 284   Filed 10/11/17   Page 5 of 28\naffect the quality of the human environment.”  FONSI at 6.  The Tribes argued in their briefing \nthat “[t]he Corps’ conclusion that the Oahe crossing was not significant enough to warrant an \nEIS” was “arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.”  SRST MSJ at 17.  \nC.   Prior Opinion and Remand \nOn June 14, 2017, two weeks after DAPL became fully operational, the Court granted in \npart and denied in part the parties’ motions and remanded certain issues to the Corps.  See \nStanding Rock III, 2017 WL 2573994, at *40.  It rejected Plaintiffs’ motion with respect to their \nclaims under the Clean Water Act and the Mineral Leasing Act, and it also upheld the majority \nof the Corps’ determinations under NEPA – including the agency’s “top-line conclusion” that the \nrisk of an oil spill was sufficiently low so as to not require an EIS.  Id. at *12, 16.  It granted the \nTribes’ motion, however, with respect to three discrete flaws in the Corps’ environmental \nanalysis.  The Court held that the Corps had insufficiently addressed: (1) the degree to which the \nproject’s effects are likely to be highly controversial; (2) the consequences of a spill for the \nTribes’ fishing and hunting rights; and (3) the environmental-justice impacts of the project.  Id. \nat *1.  Although the Court remanded these issues to the Corps for further analysis, it did not \ndecide whether the easement should be vacated pending such remand.  Instead, it ordered the \nparties to submit briefing on “whether remand with or without vacatur is appropriate in light of \nthe deficiencies herein identified and any disruptive consequences that would result given the \ncurrent stage of the pipeline's operation.”  Id. at *29.  \nThis briefing is now complete, and the Court must determine whether or not oil may \ncontinue to flow under Lake Oahe.  Although the parties dispute what, precisely, vacatur would \nentail, see ECF Nos. 277 (DA Reply) at 1 n.1; 276 (Corps Reply) at 9; 280 (Tribes Sur-reply) at \n1, the prior Opinion clearly stated that vacatur would require that DAPL “cease operations” \n  5\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 284   Filed 10/11/17   Page 6 of 28\nduring remand.  Standing Rock III at *28.  The Court therefore assumes at this stage that such a \nremedy would vacate the Corps’ prior EA and FONSI, as well as the easement it granted to \nDakota Access in reliance on these determinations.  Without this authorization, DAPL cannot \nlawfully continue to operate the pipeline on federal land.  \nII.   Legal Standard \nUnder the caselaw of this Circuit, “vacating a rule or action promulgated in violation of \nNEPA is the standard remedy.”  Humane Soc. of U.S. v. Johanns, 520 F. Supp. 2d 8, 37 (D.D.C. \n2007) (citing Am. Bioscience, Inc. v. Thompson, 269 F.3d 1077, 1084 (D.C. Cir. 2001)); see \nReed v. Salazar, 744 F. Supp. 2d 98, 118–20 (D.D.C. 2010) (finding NEPA violation and \nordering vacatur); Sierra Club v. Van Antwerp, 719 F. Supp. 2d 77, 78–80 (D.D.C. 2010) \n(finding NEPA violation and ordering remand with partial vacatur); Greater Yellowstone Coal. \nv. Kempthorne, 577 F. Supp. 2d 183, 204–05, 210 (D.D.C. 2008) (finding NEPA violation and \nordering vacatur).  Yet, although vacatur is the “presumptively appropriate remedy,” it is not the \nonly option.  See Sierra Club, 719 F. Supp. 2d at 78.  Instead, as equity requires, the reviewing \ncourt has discretion leave the agency action in place.  See, e.g., Advocates for Hwy. & Auto \nSafety v. Fed. Motor Carrier Safety Admin., 429 F.3d 1136, 1151 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (remanding \nwithout vacatur); Int’l Union, United Mine Workers of Am. v. Fed. Mine Safety & Health \nAdmin., 920 F.2d 960, 966-67 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (same).   \nThe test for whether or not a court should vacate a deficient agency action during remand \ncomes from this Circuit’s decision in Allied-Signal v. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 988 \nF.2d 146, 150–51 (D.C. Cir. 1993).  As Allied-Signal explained, “[T]he decision whether to \nvacate depends on the seriousness of the order’s deficiencies (and thus the extent of doubt \nwhether the agency chose correctly) and the disruptive consequences of an interim change that \n  6\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 284   Filed 10/11/17   Page 7 of 28\nmay itself be changed.”  Id. at 150-151 (internal citation omitted).  Put otherwise, this Court must \ndetermine whether there is “at least a serious possibility that the [agency] will be able to \nsubstantiate its decision on remand,” and whether vacatur will lead to impermissibly disruptive \nconsequences in the interim.  See Nat'l Parks Conservation Ass'n v. Jewell, 62 F. Supp. 3d 7, 20 \n(D.D.C. 2014); Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Co. v. FERC, 519 F.3d 497, 504 (D.C. Cir. \n2008) (declining to vacate when “significant possibility that the [agency] may find an adequate \nexplanation for its actions”).  The question for the Court today is thus whether this is the “type of \ncase that merits departure from the presumptive remedy of vacatur.”  Pub. Employees for Envtl. \nResponsibility v. United States Fish & Wildlife Serv., 189 F. Supp. 3d 1, 2–3 (D.D.C. 2016), \nappeal dismissed, No. 16-5224, 2016 WL 6915561 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 31, 2016).  It therefore \nexamines the two prongs of Allied-Signal separately below, bearing in mind that “[t]here is no \nrule requiring either the proponent or opponent of vacatur to prevail on both factors.”  Shands \nJacksonville Med. Ctr. v. Burwell, 139 F. Supp. 3d 240, 270 (D.D.C. 2015).   \nIII.   Analysis \n  A.   Seriousness of Deficiencies \nThe first prong of the Allied-Signal test requires the Court to determine the “seriousness” \nof the deficiencies in the underlying agency action.  Here, Defendants argue that the three \ninadequacies identified by the Court – namely, the Corps’ failure to adequately address the \ndegree to which the project’s effects are likely to be highly controversial, the impacts of a spill \non fish or game, and the environmental-justice impacts of a spill – are not significant deficiencies \nin the agency’s prior analysis.  See ECF No. 258 (Corps Brief).  Noting that the Court previously \nrejected the majority of Plaintiffs’ challenges, Defendants contend that there are “only a few \nremaining tasks for the Corps to complete on remand” in order to substantiate the prior EA.  See \n  7\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 284   Filed 10/11/17   Page 8 of 28\nECF No. 260 (DA Brief) at 19.  Plaintiffs, unsurprisingly, cast the Court’s Opinion in quite a \ndifferent light.  The Tribes assert that the Court granted their motion for summary judgment on \n“three grounds that go to the heart of this dispute, and that are fundamental to the Tribes and \ntheir treaty rights.”  ECF No. 272 (Tribes Brief) at 1.  These issues, the Tribes contend, cast \n“considerable doubt” upon the Corps’ decision to forgo a full EIS.  See Tribes’ Sur-reply at 10.  \nUnder Allied-Signal, the severity of an agency’s errors below turns on “the extent of \ndoubt whether [it] chose correctly.”  988 F.2d at 150-51.  The Court therefore must assess the \nlikelihood that, on remand, the Corps will be able to justify its prior decision to issue an EA and \nFONSI, rather than preparing a full EIS.  Such assessment looks at each issue in turn.  \n1.  Highly Controversial \nThe prior Opinion found that the Corps had failed to fully consider “the degree to which \n[DAPL’s] effects on the quality of the human environment are likely to be highly controversial.”  \nStanding Rock III, 2017 WL 2573994, at *13-14 (citing 40 C.F.R. § 1508.27(b)(4)).  This factor \nmust be addressed in “cases where a substantial dispute exists as to the size, nature, or effect of \nthe major federal action rather than to the existence of opposition to a use.”  Town of Cave \nCreek, Arizona v. FAA, 325 F.3d 320, 331 (D.C. Cir. 2003).  Here, the Court found that certain \nof the Tribes’ expert reports submitted after July 24, 2016, created such a controversy and thus \ndirected the Corps to address those “scientific critiques.”  Standing Rock III, 2017 WL 2573994, \nat *14.  Plaintiffs contend that doing so on remand will require Defendants to “explicitly . . . \nfind[] meritless each of the many technical criticisms and supporting data” in the expert reports.  \nSee Tribes Brief at 19.  They therefore assert that the Court’s holding reflects not an “easily \nexplained oversight,” but a “substantial legal flaw.”  Id. at 20.  Defendants feel differently.  The \nCorps argues that, as noted in the prior Opinion, the record after remand may demonstrate that \n  8\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 284   Filed 10/11/17   Page 9 of 28\nDefendants “reasonably” determined that the Tribes’ reports had “material flaws.”  Corps Brief \nat 10; Standing Rock III, 2017 WL 2573994, at *14.  The agency asserts, moreover, that there is \na serious possibility that the 36 conditions on the existing easement already address any of the \nexperts’ legitimate concerns.  See Corps Brief at 10-11.  \nThe Court recognizes that the “lack of a reasoned explanation is a serious failing in an \nagency’s decision, because it leaves the Court in doubt as to whether the agency chose correctly \nin making its decision.”  AARP v. United States Equal Employment Opportunity Comm’n, 2017 \nWL 3614430, at *16 (D.D.C. Aug. 22, 2017) (internal citation omitted).  The question with \nrespect to vacatur, however, is the extent of that doubt.  See Allied–Signal, 988 F.2d at 150.  In \nthis case, the Court did not find that the expert reports submitted after July 25, 2016, presented \nan insurmountable obstacle to justifying the Corps’ prior EA.  Rather, the Opinion stated that \n“[i]t may well be the case that the Corps reasonably concluded that these expert reports were \nflawed or unreliable and thus did not actually create any substantial evidence of controversial \neffects.”  Standing Rock III, 2017 WL 2573994, at *14.  What was missing, the Court found, \nwas that the Corps “never said as much.”  Id.   \nCorrecting this flaw does not require that Defendants begin anew, but only that they \nbetter articulate their reasoning below.  Courts have declined to grant vacatur in similar \ncircumstances, finding that agencies should instead be “afford[ed] a reasonable opportunity to . . \n. provide a reasoned explanation” of their choices.  See Am. Radio Relay League, Inc. v. FCC, \n524 F.3d 227, 242 (D.C. Cir. 2008); Heartland Reg’l Med. Ctr. v. Sebelius, 566 F.3d 193, 198 \n(D.C. Cir. 2009) (“When an agency may be able readily to cure a defect in its explanation of a \ndecision, the first factor in Allied–Signal counsels remand without vacatur.”); Black Oak Energy, \nLLC v. FERC., 725 F.3d 230, 244 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (declining to vacate agency action when \n  9\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 284   Filed 10/11/17   Page 10 of 28\n“plausible that [agency] can redress its failure of explanation on remand while reaching the same \nresult”); Williston Basin, 519 F.3d at 504 (declining to vacate when “significant possibility that \nthe [agency] may find an adequate explanation for its actions”).  This Court agrees.  Although \nthe Corps must give careful consideration to the expert critiques, it is well positioned to provide \nsuch explanation on remand.  Indeed, addressing the degree to which the project is likely to be \nhighly controversial fits squarely within the realm of those “factual disputes” committed to \nagency expertise.  See Wis. Valley Improvement Co. v. FERC, 236 F.3d 738, 746 (D.C. Cir. \n2001) (citation omitted); FBME Bank Ltd. v. Lew, 209 F. Supp. 3d 299, 342 (D.D.C. 2016) \n(finding that the “fair likelihood that the agency will be able to make use of its expertise to \njustify its reliance on data and information” counsels in favor of remand without vacatur).  On \nremand, the Corps must exercise its judgment in analyzing Plaintiffs’ expert critiques.  The Court \nfinds a serious possibility that, in doing so, it will be able to substantiate the prior EA.   \n2.  Fishing and Hunting  \nThe second deficiency identified in the prior Opinion was the Corps’ neglecting to \nproperly assess the impact of an oil spill on fish and game – two resources protected by the \nTribes’ treaty rights.  Standing Rock III, 2017 WL 2573994, at *16-17.  As with the first issue, \nPlaintiffs assert that remedying this error will necessitate in-depth analysis through an EIS.  See \nTribes Brief at 21.  Defendants counter that, given the minimal risk of an oil spill, there is a \nsubstantial possibility that DAPL will have “no significant impacts” on the Tribes’ hunting and \nfishing rights.  See Corps Brief at 11.  They therefore maintain that the Corps will likely \nsubstantiate that DAPL’s effects on fishing and hunting, if any, do not require an EIS.   \nOn this issue, Defendants’ task on remand is a narrow one.  As the Court previously \nnoted, the agency did not “wholly ignore the consequences of a possible oil spill” on the Tribes’ \n  10\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 284   Filed 10/11/17   Page 11 of 28\ntreaty rights.  Standing Rock III, 2017 WL 2573994, at *16.  The Corps’ analysis fell short, \nhowever, when it “stat[ed] simply that ‘[t]he primary issue related to impacts on the aquatic \nenvironment from operation of [DAPL] would be related to a release from the pipeline,’” \nwithout explaining “what those effects would be.”  Id. at *17.  Likewise, although the agency \naddressed the effects of pipeline construction on wildlife, it failed to consider the consequences \nof a spill.  Id.  These two gaps in the Corps’ analysis were improper under NEPA, but they are \nfar from incurable.  Although the Tribes assert that the record on remand will support the need \nfor an EIS because it “is replete with evidence of the significance of these rights to the Tribe[s],” \nTribes Brief at 20, the Court already held that NEPA does not require any such “existential-scope \nanalysis.”  Standing Rock III, 2017 WL 2573994, at *15.  While the Tribes now reiterate that \nthey place a “high importance  . . . on hunting and fishing,” Tribes Brief at 21, the Corps on \nremand must take a “hard look” at the impact of DAPL on only the resources themselves.  \nHere, the record shows that the agency is well situated to conduct such an inquiry.  It has \nalready gathered information regarding Lake Oahe’s fish and wildlife, and it has conducted a \nlengthy analysis of the possible toxicity arising from various spill scenarios.  See Standing Rock \nIII, 2017 WL 2573994, at *17; ECF No. 172-1 at 58-59 (discussing wildlife near Lake Oahe); \n104 (same); 101 (discussing exposure of Lake Oahe fish to oil spill); 47-48 (same); 45-46 \n(discussing potential toxic effects of spill).  On remand, the Corps must simply connect the dots.  \nThis, then, is not a case in which the agency “must redo its analysis from the ground up.”  North \nCarolina v. EPA, 531 F.3d 896, 929 (D.C. Cir. 2008).  The agency already has the data it needs \nto determine the impact of a spill on fish and game – indeed, it has already concluded that “under \nno spill scenario would the acute toxicity threshold for aquatic organisms be exceeded.”  \nStanding Rock III, 2017 WL 2573994, at *17.  The Corps, moreover, will assess the significance \n  11\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 284   Filed 10/11/17   Page 12 of 28\nof any consequences on fish and game in light of its prior determination that the risk of rupture \nunder Lake Oahe is low.  See New York v. NRC, 681 F.3d 471, 478-79 (D.C. Cir. 2012) \n(holding that agency “may find no significant impact if . . . the combination of probability and \nharm is sufficiently minimal”).  The record suggests, therefore, that the Corps “may be able \nreadily to cure a defect in its explanation of [the prior] decision.”  Heartland Reg'l Med. Ctr. v. \nSebelius, 566 F.3d 193, 198 (D.C. Cir. 2009).  Although the agency may ultimately conclude that \nthis issue nonetheless requires a full EIS, the Court finds that there is a strong likelihood that it \nwill instead substantiate its prior decision to issue an EA.  \n3.  Environmental Justice \nThe last issue concerns the environmental-justice impacts of the Lake Oahe crossing.  \nThe Tribes challenged the selection of that site over an alternative location upstream of \nBismarck, North Dakota, arguing that the Corps had failed to properly analyze whether the \ncurrent placement of the pipeline could disproportionately affect low-income, minority \ncommunities.  See ECF 117-19 (SRST MSJ).  The Court agreed.  It held that the Corps’ \n“cursory” analysis did not “reasonably support the conclusion that the [Standing Rock Sioux] \nTribe will not be disproportionately affected by an oil spill in terms of adverse human health or \nenvironmental effects.”  Standing Rock III, 2017 WL 2573994, at *23.  In particular, the Court \ncast doubt upon the Corps’ decision to use census tracts upstream from the Lake Oahe site – \nwhen oil spills flow downstream – and to consider the communities within only a half-mile \nradius of the crossing, given that the Standing Rock Reservation is located .55 miles \ndownstream.  Id. at *20-21.  In light of these flaws and the “minimal” discussion of \nenvironmental justice in the EA, the Court concluded that the agency “did not properly consider \nthe environmental-justice implications of the project.”  Id. at *23.  \n  12\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 284   Filed 10/11/17   Page 13 of 28\nCharacterizing the Corps’ environmental-justice assessment as “fatally flawed,” Tribes \nBrief at 22, Plaintiffs contend that a valid analysis would “inevitably conclude” that the pipeline \ndisproportionately affects Native American and low-income populations, and thus would “yield a \ndifferent outcome on the core question of whether an EIS is required.”  Id. at 23.  Defendants, of \ncourse, disagree, rejoining that “given the low risk of an oil spill, it is unlikely that . . . a different \nbuffer and environmental justice analysis” will yield a new result on remand.  See Corps Brief at \n10.   \nAlthough it is a closer call than the first two issues, the Court concludes that the flaws in \nthe Corps’ environmental-justice analysis do not support vacatur.  The agency’s action was not, \nin this case, so lacking as to cast serious doubt on its decision to issue an EA.  The prior Opinion \nexplicitly stated that the Corps “need not necessarily have addressed” each concern raised by the \nTribes, but only that it must “offer more than a bare-bones conclusion that Standing Rock would \nnot be disproportionately harmed by a spill.”  Standing Rock III, 2017 WL 2573994, at *23; see \nSierra Club v. FERC, 867 F.3d 1357, 1370 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (holding that the “goal of an \nenvironmental-justice analysis is satisfied if an agency recognizes and discusses a project's \nimpacts on predominantly-minority communities”); Latin Americans for Soc. & Econ. Dev. v. \nAdm'r of Fed. Highway Admin., 756 F.3d 447, 477 (6th Cir. 2014) (noting that “[e]nvironmental \nimpacts and environmental justice issues are a consideration in agency decision making, but are \nnot controlling”).  Although the Corps must provide a more robust analysis on remand, there is \nreason to think that, in doing so, it has a substantial possibility of validating its prior conclusion.  \n Indeed, contrary to the Tribes’ statement that a finding of a disproportionate impact \nwould necessitate an EIS, the relevant agency guidance expressly contemplates the use of an EA \nto address such concerns.  See ECF No. 117–19 (CEQ, Environmental Justice Guidance Under \n  13\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 284   Filed 10/11/17   Page 14 of 28\nthe National Environmental Policy Act, Dec. 10, 1997) at 15 (“Where a potential environmental \njustice issue has been identified by an agency, the agency should state clearly in the EIS or EA \nwhether, in light of all the facts and circumstances, a disproportionately high and adverse human \nhealth or environmental impact on . . . Indian tribe[s] is likely to result from the proposed \naction.”) (emphasis added).  As a result, even if Defendants did conclude on remand that a \ncrossing at the Lake Oahe site may disproportionately affect minority or tribal populations, such \nan outcome would not compel the Corps to alter its prior decision to issue an EA and FONSI.  \nAdditionally, multiple aspects of the record suggest that the Corps is likely to justify \nissuing an EA, rather than completing an EIS.  First, as with the hunting-and-fishing analysis, the \nminimal risk of an oil spill under Lake Oahe reduces the likelihood that the project will have a \nsignificant impact on the surrounding communities.  See Sierra Club, 867 F.3d at 1369 \n(upholding environmental-justice analysis when agency concluded, in part, that “the project \nwould not have a ‘high and adverse’ impact on any population, meaning, in the agency’s view, \nthat it could not have a ‘disproportionately high and adverse’ impact on any population, \nmarginalized or otherwise”); Allen v. Nat'l Institutes of Health, 974 F. Supp. 2d 18, 47 (D. Mass. \n2013) (upholding environmental-justice analysis when project was located in area with larger \nlow-income and minority populations, but agency concluded that “the likelihood of [adverse \neffects] is extremely low”).   \nSecond, the impact of any such spill, if it were to occur, is in part mitigated by the \nrelocation of the Standing Rock water-intake structure.  The new structure is situated \napproximately 50 miles further downstream from the Lake Oahe crossing than the old site, and it \nis outside even the furthest radius suggested by Standing Rock as appropriate for evaluating the \nenvironmental-justice impacts of the pipeline.  See Standing Rock III, 2017 WL 2573994, at \n  14\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 284   Filed 10/11/17   Page 15 of 28\n*19; ECF No. 117–24 (Memorandum from David Cooper, Chief Counsel, Corps, Oct. 20, 2016) \nat 19.  Plaintiffs assert that the old intake structure is still in operation, see ECF No. 272-3 (Third \nDecl. of Dave Archambault, II), ¶ 10, but they cannot dispute that the new site will mitigate at \nleast some of their concerns regarding the relative impact of a spill on the Tribes’ drinking water.   \nFinally, the Corps’ already-conducted assessment of the alternative pipeline route \nthrough Bismarck increases the likelihood that the agency will find that DAPL’s environmental-\njustice impacts do not require an EIS.  Under NEPA, the consideration of such alternative routes \nis relevant to the Corps’ environmental-justice review on remand, as the statute requires only that \nthe agency “grapple[] with the disparate impacts of the various possible pipeline routes.”  Sierra \nClub, 867 F.3d at 1369.  As the CEQ guidance states, “The identification of a disproportionately \nhigh and adverse human health or environmental effect on a[n] . . . Indian tribe does not preclude \na proposed agency action from going forward, nor does it necessarily compel a conclusion that a \nproposed action is environmentally unsatisfactory.”  CEQ at 10.  “Rather, the identification of \nsuch an effect should,” inter alia, “heighten agency attention to alternatives (including \nalternative sites).”  Id.   \nAs the prior Opinion discussed, the alternative Bismarck crossing would pass much \ncloser to a drinking-water intake than the Lake Oahe location does.  See Standing Rock III, 2017 \nWL 2573994, at *18-19; ECF No. 209–16 at 5 (Memorandum from Tom Siguaw, Dakota \nAccess, & Steve Rove, HDR Engineering, Apr. 12, 2016).  The two water intakes downstream \nfrom the Bismarck site serve 84,504 people, while those downstream from the Oahe intakes \nserve 8,037.  See Standing Rock III, 2017 WL 2573994, at *18-19.  Risks presented to this \ntenfold increase in population must, of course, be considered when the Corps evaluates the \nenvironmental-justice impacts, if any, of the Lake Oahe crossing.  See Sierra Club, 867 F.3d at \n  15\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 284   Filed 10/11/17   Page 16 of 28\n1371 (noting that, in conducting its environmental-justice analysis, agency “also considered four \nroute alternatives . . . but rejected them all, mainly on the ground that they would have had a \ngreater overall impact on residences and populated areas”); Latin Americans for Soc. & Econ. \nDev., 756 F.3d at 477 (finding that agency took requisite hard look at environmental-justice \nissues when it considered alternatives to avoid or minimize disproportionately high adverse \nimpacts and “reasonably determined its priorities based on all the comparative information \navailable”).  Under NEPA, an agency is “not required to select the course of action that best \nserves environmental justice, only to take a ‘hard look’ at environmental justice issues.”  Sierra \nClub, 867 F.3d at 1368; see Latin Americans for Soc. & Econ. Dev, 756 F.3d at 476 (“Just as the \n[agency] is not required to select an alternative with the least environmental impact under NEPA, \nthe [agency] is not required to select an alternative with the least environmental justice impact.”).  \nThe Court finds that there is a substantial possibility that the Corps will meet this standard on \nremand and will substantiate its prior decision to proceed with the Lake Oahe crossing without \nan EIS.  \nIn reaching this decision, however, the Court does not seek to minimize the importance of \nthe Tribes’ environmental-justice concerns.  The purpose of this analysis under NEPA is to \nensure that the government properly accounts for the “interrelated cultural, social, occupational, \nhistorical, or economic factors that may amplify the natural and physical environmental effects” \nof agency actions.  See CEQ Guidance at 9.  There is no doubt that our nation’s history is replete \nwith examples of Native American tribes bearing the brunt of government action.  See ECF No. \n270-1 (Brief of Amici Curiae Great Plains Tribal Chairmen’s Association, et al.) at 6-8.  And \nChairman Archambault is eloquent on why the Tribes believe that this pipeline embodies another \ntransgression.  See Archambault Decl., ¶¶ 12-20.  Yet the Court’s role here is not to determine \n  16\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 284   Filed 10/11/17   Page 17 of 28\nthe wisdom of agency action or to opine on its substantive effects.  See Robertson, 490 U.S. at \n351 (holding that “NEPA merely prohibits uninformed - rather than unwise - agency action”).  \nInstead, it must consider only the Corps’ likelihood on remand of fulfilling NEPA’s procedural \nenvironmental-justice requirements and justifying its prior decision.  \n* * * \nIn cases in which the agency’s reasoning is “so crippled as to be unlawful,” vacatur is \ngenerally the appropriate remedy.  See Radio-Television News Directors Ass’n v. FCC, 184 F.3d \n872, 888 (D.C. Cir. 1999).  If, however, the action is “potentially lawful but insufficiently or \ninappropriately explained,” remand without vacatur may instead be imposed.  Id.  As is evident \nfrom the discussion above, this case falls within the latter category.  Here, the Corps’ decision to \nproduce only an EA, rather than an EIS, is “potentially lawful.”  The errors below were \nsubstantial, but they do not present fundamental flaws in Defendants’ reasoning.  Although \nPlaintiffs contend that the issues on remand go to the “heart” of their opposition to this project, \nsee Tribes Brief at 1, the question for vacatur is not the importance of the issue, but the extent of \nthe error.  Here, the Court cannot say that the deficiencies in the prior EA and FONSI are \n“crippling” flaws in the Corps’ analysis.  The Court previously found that the Corps “largely \ncomplied” with NEPA’s requirements, and it granted remand on only a narrow subset of the \nTribes’ NEPA claims.  See Standing Rock III, 2017 WL 2573994, at *28.  The lengthy \nprocedural history of this case shows, moreover, that there has been nothing hasty about the \nCorps’ decisionmaking thus far.  There is no reason to think that it will be any less thorough in \nanalyzing the three deficiencies on remand.  In light of the agency’s substantial compliance with \nNEPA, the Court finds that that the Corps has a significant likelihood of being able to \nsubstantiate its prior conclusions and determines that the first prong of the Allied-Signal \nframework thus counsels in favor of remand without vacatur.   \n  17\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 284   Filed 10/11/17   Page 18 of 28\nB.  Disruptive Consequences \nThe second consideration in determining whether to remand without vacatur is “the \ndisruptive consequences of an interim change that may itself be changed.”  Allied-Signal, 988 F. \n2d at 150–51; see Conservation Law Found. v. Pritzker, 37 F. Supp. 3d 254, 271 (D.D.C. 2014).  \nOn this issue, the parties have much to say about the disruption, or lack thereof, that will result if \nthe Court vacates the Corps’ prior decisions.  As discussed below, the Court concludes that this \nfactor weighs only slightly in favor of remand without vacatur.  \n1.   Direct Disruption \nDefendants and their amici spend much of their briefing spelling out what they believe \nare potentially dire economic consequences of vacatur.  Dakota Access, for example, asserts that \nif the pipeline is paused, North Dakota’s oil producers will face severe costs and delays.  See DA \nBrief at 14; ECF No. 279 (Amici Curiae Brief of American Fuel and Petrochemical \nManufacturers) at 6 (stating that “direct financial impact” of taking DAPL out of service “would \nbe staggering”).  The company contends that other pipelines, refineries, and downstream users of \nthe oil currently transported in DAPL would also “suffer greatly” and would be forced into \n“emergency arrangements” to compensate for the shutdown.  See DA Brief at 14.  The impact of \nvacatur, Dakota Access posits, would place in peril the jobs of all those currently involved in \nDAPL’s operations and would prevent Dakota Access from being able to perform the contracts it \nhas entered into with producers.  Id. at 18.  Defendants assert that such a halt in pipeline \noperations would also deprive state and local governments of millions of dollars in tax revenue \nand would undermine new industries that support DAPL operations.  See Brief of American Fuel \nManufacturers, et al. at 8, 10.  Finally, Defendants argue that these effects would be passed on to \nconsumers, claiming that the disruptive market effects of vacatur would have “significant ripple \n  18\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 284   Filed 10/11/17   Page 19 of 28\neffects.”  DA Brief at 15.  In total, Dakota Access declares that issuing vacatur in this case would \nincur costs of hundreds of millions of dollars.  Id. at 18.    \nThe Tribes contest both the accuracy and the relevance of Defendants’ economic \nconcerns.  As to the former, Plaintiffs have submitted declarations asserting that “DAPL \nrevenues” are likely “substantially less than indicated” by Defendants and stating that a DAPL \nshutdown “will not result in the severe disruptions claimed by the Corps and Dakota Access.”  \nECF No. 272-5 (Declaration of Ian Goodman), ¶¶ 41, 43.  They therefore argue that the \ncompany’s claims “regarding loss of revenues and other potential impacts of a DAPL shutdown \nshould not be relied upon to determine the likely impacts” of vacatur.  Id., ¶ 41.  As to the latter, \nthe Tribes question whether “financial impacts” carry “much or even any weight” when \nevaluating the second Allied-Signal factor in NEPA cases.  See Tribes’ Brief at 25.   \nAs an initial matter, the Court rejects Plaintiffs’ suggestion that it should wholly \ndisregard the potential for financial disruption.  Although this perspective has been suggested in \nat least one district court decision, see Ctr. for Food Safety v. Vilsack, 734 F. Supp. 2d 948, 953 \n(N.D. Cal. 2010), it is clear that courts in this Circuit have repeatedly considered the economic \nimplications of vacatur – including in cases addressing environmental harms.  See Am. Water \nWorks Ass'n v. EPA, 40 F.3d 1266, 1273 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (declining to vacate rule addressing \nlead in drinking water in part because “vacatur would be unnecessarily disruptive to the \n[affected] industries”); Sierra Club v. U.S. Dep't of Agric., Rural Utilities Serv., 841 F. Supp. 2d \n349, 363 (D.D.C. 2012) (NEPA decision considering potential “substantial financial loss if the \nCourt were to vacate” under second Allied-Signal prong); Friends of the Capital Crescent Trail \nv. Fed. Transit Admin., 218 F. Supp. 3d 53, 60 (D.D.C. 2016) (acknowledging that “delay in \n[agency] project could impose significant financial costs”); see also California Communities \n  19\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 284   Filed 10/11/17   Page 20 of 28\nAgainst Toxics v. U.S. EPA, 688 F.3d 989, 993–94 (9th Cir. 2012) (declining to vacate in part \nbecause stopping construction of power plant would be “economically disastrous”).   \nThat the Court will consider Defendant’s allegations of financial harm does not, however, \nmean that it will necessarily give determinative effect to such claims.  Defendants’ cri de coeur \nover lost profits and industrial inconvenience is not fully convincing.  Such is the nature of doing \nbusiness, especially in an area fraught with bureaucracy and litigation.  Dakota Access began \npumping oil into the pipeline with full knowledge that Plaintiffs were contesting the easement \nallowing them to do so.  By nonetheless proceeding with its venture, the company assumed some \nrisk of economic disruption.  See ECF No. 259-2 (Declaration of David Murk), ¶ 8 (stating that \nimpact of vacatur would not have been severe “had DAPL not begun operations in June 2017”). \nThere is, moreover, some cause for skepticism regarding Dakota Access’s predictions of \neconomic devastation.  This is not the first time the company has staked out this position – it \npreviously claimed that delays in the pipeline would have disastrous economic effects.  During \nthe first preliminary-injunction briefing, the company warned that contracts for DAPL could be \ncanceled if it was not able to start delivering oil by January 1, 2017.  See ECF No. 22-1 \n(Declaration of Joey Mahmoud, Aug. 18, 2016), ¶¶ 69-70.  Yet the pipeline did not come on line \nuntil June, and no apparent calamity ensued.  See ECF 277-12 (Second Declaration of Lee \nHanse), ¶ 4 (stating that “no contracts have been renegotiated or terminated”).  The Court thus \ncannot conclude that, in the case of a halt in DAPL operations, the company would have no \nalternative option.  \nThe empirical basis for Defendants’ assertion that vacatur would have catastrophic \neconomic effects is, additionally, sharply contested by the Tribes.  See Goodman Decl., ¶¶ 43-\n48, 75 (asserting that impacts to energy systems and market due to vacatur would likely be \n  20\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 284   Filed 10/11/17   Page 21 of 28\n“small to very small”).  Indeed, it is unclear from the current record how much oil is even \nflowing through the pipeline at this time.  Compare id., ¶¶ 19-25 (stating that DAPL appears to \nbe operating at partial capacity) with DA Brief at 13 (claiming that DAPL carries equivalent of \n500,000 barrels per day) with DA Reply at 6 (citing figure of 300,000 barrels per day).  The \nparties ask the Court to wade into this war of the crude-oil experts.  Yet, because it declines to \nrely heavily on economic impact as a justification for issuing vacatur, the Court need not resolve \nthis factual dispute.  See Pub. Employees for Envtl. Responsibility, 189 F. Supp. 3d at 3 (stating \nthat “absent a strong showing . . . that vacatur will unduly harm economic interests . . . [,] the \nCourt is reluctant to rely on economic disruption” in denying vacatur).   \nBeyond the data, there are broader concerns with Defendants’ economic claims.  Dakota \nAccess and its amici focus almost exclusively on the financial and industrial implications of a \ntemporary DAPL shutdown.  In doing so, they address the “potentially disruptive effects of \nvacatur as if they occur in a vacuum,” thus giving short shrift to the “potentially disruptive \neffects that could flow from remand without vacatur.”  Friends of the Capital Crescent Trail v. \nFed. Transit Admin., 218 F. Supp. 3d 53, 60 (D.D.C. 2016).  Here, there is no doubt that \nallowing oil to flow through the pipeline during remand risks the potentially disruptive effect \nabout which the Tribes are most concerned – a spill under Lake Oahe.  The likelihood of any \nsuch rupture may be low, but pausing the operation of the pipeline would mitigate even this \nsmall risk.  By emphasizing the financial impacts of vacatur, Defendants ignore the \n“devastating” consequences that the Tribes allege could result from remand without such a \nremedy in place.  See Archambault Decl., ¶ 10-11.  \nThis economic myopia ignores the fact that the possible effects of an oil spill on the \nTribes’ treaty rights and communities were at the center of this Court’s prior Opinion.  See \n  21\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 284   Filed 10/11/17   Page 22 of 28\nStanding Rock III, 2017 WL 2573994, at *10.  Defendants unfairly downplay these concerns.  \nIndeed, the Corps alleges that “loss of life is notably absent from Plaintiffs’ discussion of \npotential worse-case spills.”  Corps Reply at 8.  Yet one need only refer to the Tribes’ \ndeclarations to see that they do, in fact, assert that such drastic harms could flow from a spill \nunder Lake Oahe.  See ECF Nos. 117-16 (Declaration of Jeff Kelly), ¶¶ 5-9 (stating that many \nTribal members rely on hunting and fishing to survive); 272-3, Exh. B (Letter from Dave \nArchambault to Acting Assistant Sec. Lamont and Colonel Henderson) at 4 (discussing serious, \nlife-threatening health and safety consequences of potential oil spill); 131-4 (Declaration of \nHarold Frazier) (stating that water shortage on reservation previously caused “death of four  \nchildren in a house fire” due to insufficient water supply for firefighting).  Although the Court \nacknowledges the potential for economic disruption, these interests do not inherently trump the \nrisk of environmental disruption if vacatur is withheld.  See Pub. Employees for Envtl. \nResponsibility, 189 F. Supp. 3d at 3 (stating that it is “not clear that economic concerns are as \nrelevant in an environmental case”) (emphasis added).  \nThe Court notes, moreover, that denying vacatur on the basis of alleged economic harm \nrisks creating undesirable incentives for future agency actions.  If projections of financial distress \nare sufficient to prevent vacatur, the Court fears that agencies and third parties may choose to \ndevote as many resources as early as possible to a challenged project – and then claim disruption \nin light of such investments.  Such a strategy is contrary to the purpose of NEPA, which seeks to \nensure that the government “looks before it leaps.”  ECF No. 269-1 (Brief of Amici Curiae of \nLaw Professors and Practitioners) at 5.  Finding that vacatur’s alleged financial harms are \ndispositive under the second prong of Allied-Signal may encourage agencies to instead act first \nand ask later.  In sum, although the Court concludes that there is likely to be some economic \n  22\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 284   Filed 10/11/17   Page 23 of 28\ndisruption from vacatur, this factor does not weigh heavily in Defendants’ favor under the \nAllied-Signal test. \n2.  Alternative Transport  \nIn addition to asserting that vacatur would have devastating economic effects, Defendants \nalso argue that such a remedy would not, in fact, ameliorate Plaintiffs’ concerns during the \nremand period.  Dakota Access contends that, if vacatur is granted, the oil currently flowing \nthrough the pipeline will be re-routed onto trains.  See DA Brief at 15-16.  The company states \nthat this form of transport involves a greater risk of accidents and thus argues that vacatur would \nput the Tribes in more environmental peril than the current status quo.  Id.  Plaintiffs dispute both \nthe facts and the premise of this position.  The Tribes contend that there is little data supporting \nthe proposition that train transport would be used in lieu of DAPL.  They point instead to expert \nreports stating that, if DAPL were shut down, “much of” the crude currently flowing under Lake \nOahe would “shift back to . . . other pipelines, rather than to rail.”  Goodman Decl., ¶ 62.  The \nTribes also contest the relative safety of the two modes of transport, referring to their expert’s \nconclusion that it is “incorrect to state that pipelines are ‘undeniably safer’ than rail,” and that \npipelines such as DAPL are “capable of releasing substantially more oil than trains.”  Id., ¶¶ 87-\n88.  Examining the respective routes and capacities of train lines and DAPL, the report concludes \nthat, for the Tribes, “DAPL has [a] . . . much greater risk than does crude by rail.”  Id., ¶ 114.  \nFinally, the Tribes contend that Defendants miss the mark by relying upon the overall risks \npresented by train transport versus pipelines.  Instead, Plaintiffs contend that the Court should \nconcern itself solely with the risk to the Tribes from DAPL and its current crossing at Lake \nOahe.  See Tribes’ Sur-reply at 15.  \n  23\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 284   Filed 10/11/17   Page 24 of 28\nIn considering the transport question, both parties acknowledge that this Circuit has \n“previously remanded without vacatur . . . if vacating ‘would at least temporarily defeat . . . the \nenhanced protection of the environmental values covered by [the statute at issue].’”  Ctr. for \nBiological Diversity v. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 861 F.3d 174, 188 (D.C. Cir. 2017).  In Davis Cty \nSolid Waste Mgmt. v. US EPA, 108 F.3d 1454 (D.C. Cir. 1997), for instance, this Circuit found \nemissions guidelines to be legally inadequate, but declined to vacate them during the remand \nprocess because “greater pollution emissions would occur” without leaving the guidelines in \nplace.  Id. at 1459-60.  Similarly, in American Farm Bureau Federation v. EPA, 559 F.3d 512 \n(D.C. Cir. 2009), the court remanded but did not vacate a deficient agency standard governing air \npollutants, reasoning that “vacating a standard because it may be insufficiently protective would . \n. . mak[e] the best an enemy of the good.”  Id. at 528.  Put otherwise, this Circuit has recognized \nthat, at times, a flawed agency action is better than no action at all.   \nYet this is not such a case.  On this record, Defendants have failed to persuade the Court \nthat transport by train is significantly more dangerous than allowing oil to continue to flow \nbeneath Lake Oahe.  The record contains no concrete figures or substantiated studies regarding \nthe risks presented by rail transportation versus DAPL’s Lake Oahe crossing.  Instead, the Court \nis left with vague projections such as Defendants’ assertion that vacatur “could result in at least \nsome portion” of the oil being moved via train and their broad claim that rail transport “poses a \nhigher accident risk” than the use of pipelines.  See Corps Brief at 13 (emphasis added).  These \nforecasts do little to assure the Court that vacatur would in fact put the environment in any \ngreater peril.  See Pub. Employees for Envtl. Responsibility, 189 F. Supp. 3d at 3–4 (granting \nvacatur when agency’s forecasted harms were imprecise or speculative).  Plaintiffs and one \namicus for Defendants, moreover, cast doubt on whether the oil currently flowing through the \n  24\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 284   Filed 10/11/17   Page 25 of 28\npipeline would, in fact, be re-routed onto rail.  See Brief of Am. Fuel Manufacturers, et al. at 10; \nGoodman Decl., ¶ 62 (stating that most oil would be transferred to other pipelines).  Given that it \nis not “guaranteed that  . . . producers or shippers would choose in the near term to ship oil on \ntransportation modes other than DAPL,” Defendant’s argument is speculative at best.  See Brief \nof Am. Fuel Manufacturers, et al. at 10. \nWhat is clear is that accidents and spills, however they may occur, have the potential to \nwreak havoc on nearby communities and ecosystems.  The effects that concern the Court today \nare not general environmental ones throughout the Midwest, but those that may result from this \npipeline in this location at Lake Oahe.  Those are the impacts that the Court found were \ninsufficiently addressed by the Corps, and those are the impacts that Plaintiffs fear during the \nremand period.  For this reason, and because the Court does not find that alternative modes of \ntransport required by vacatur, if any, will necessarily increase the risk of an oil spill, it rejects \nthis argument against vacatur.   \n3.  Other Considerations  \nThe Corps also attempts to argue that vacatur here would “have greater disruptive \nconsequences than in the typical NEPA case” because the pipeline has already been completed.  \nSee Corps Brief at 12.  The agency contends that vacatur is the standard remedy in NEPA cases \nonly when it would affect the “prospective application of rules or agency actions,” rather than \nsituations in which the challenged outcome has already gone into effect.  Id.  Plaintiffs counter \nthat this distinction finds little footing in the facts of the case.  See Tribes Sur-reply at 5-6.  \nThe Tribes have the better of this dispute.  Although construction is complete and oil is \nflowing, Plaintiffs are not asking for the pipeline itself, or for any existing infrastructure, to be \ndismantled.  Id. at 2.  Instead, their concerns in this case, and the deficiencies identified in the \n  25\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 284   Filed 10/11/17   Page 26 of 28\nprior Opinion, involve the risks presented by the continued passage of oil under the Lake.  This \nis clearly an ongoing, and prospective, event.  This is thus not a case in which “[t]he egg has \nbeen scrambled and there is no apparent way to restore the status quo ante.”  Sugar Cane \nGrowers Coop. v. Veneman, 289 F.3d 89, 97 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (remanding in lieu of vacating \nagency action where agency had already administered program disbursing large quantities of \nsugar to farmers who had already plowed under their crops).  The oil may currently be flowing, \nbut Defendants do not dispute that it could be stopped.  Although courts have declined to vacate \nimproper agency actions when doing so would be an “invitation to chaos,” id. at 97, in this case \nvacatur would be, at most, an invitation to substantial inconvenience.  Contracts may have to be \nrenegotiated and alternative modes of transportation found, but there is no indication in the \nrecord that Defendants’ actions under the improper EA cannot be undone. \nFinally, the Corps’ assertions regarding the timing of the remand process are also relevant \nto analyzing the disruption in this case.  The agency now states that it anticipates completing its \nindependent review and analysis of the remand issues by April 2018, which is several months \nafter its initial estimate.  See ECF No. 281 (Notice of Revised Schedule); Corps Brief at 1.  This \ntimeline aids both parties’ positions with respect to the impact of vacatur.  On one hand, the \nmultiple-month period of review increases the risk that a spill will occur prior to the new analysis \nand thus strengthens the Tribes’ assertion that such an incident could occur during the remand \nprocess.  On the other hand, this timing also supports Defendants’ position that vacatur would \nhave severe disruptive effects.  To vacate the easement during the remand process would stop oil \nfrom flowing under Lake Oahe for at least six months – an interruption that could cause \nsignificant harms to numerous people and entities.  The remand period thus supports both sides’ \n  26\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 284   Filed 10/11/17   Page 27 of 28\narguments regarding the real-world impact of the Court’s choice today, but does not dictate the \noutcome either way. \n* * * \nThe second prong of Allied-Signal, consequently, does not counsel strongly in favor of \nremand without vacatur.  It is undeniable that stopping the flow of oil beneath Lake Oahe will \nhave some disruptive effect, but all the considerations on this prong tip only narrowly in favor of \nDefendants.  Because the Court has concluded that the Corps’ errors are likely to be cured under \nthe first prong, it need not define the precise scale of the potential disruption.  This is because in \ncircumstances in which the first prong of Allied-Signal supports remand without vacatur, the \nsecond prong “is only barely relevant.”  Fox Television Stations, Inc. v. FCC, 280 F.3d 1027, \n1049 (D.C. Cir. 2002), opinion modified on reh’g, 293 F.3d 537 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  In those \ninstances, “though the disruptive consequences of vacatur might not be great, the probability that \nthe [agency] will be able to justify retaining [its prior decision] is sufficiently high that vacatur . . \n. is not appropriate.”  Id.  This is such a case.  The Court therefore need not rely upon disruption \nin deciding that vacatur is not the appropriate outcome.  \nC.  Other Relief \nIn their briefing the Tribes request that, if the Court declines to vacate, it instead impose a \nseries of conditions on the continued operation of DAPL under Lake Oahe.  Defendants, in their \nresponse, do not address the merits of these proposed remedies; rather, they assert only that the \nCourt lacks jurisdiction to enter such an order.  See Corps Brief at 4.  This is not so.  A reviewing \ncourt may craft relief as equity requires.  W. Oil & Gas Ass'n v. EPA, 633 F.2d 803, 813 (9th \nCir. 1980) (“[A] reviewing court has discretion to shape an equitable remedy.”); Montana \nWilderness Ass'n v. Fry, 408 F. Supp. 2d 1032, 1034 (D. Mont. 2006) (“The district court’s \nequitable powers are broad, and it is within the court's authority to fashion a remedy that fits the \n  27\n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 284   Filed 10/11/17   Page 28 of 28\nparticular facts of the case before it.”); Sierra Forest Legacy v. Sherman, 951 F. Supp. 2d 1100, \n1106 (E.D. Cal. 2013) (“Vacatur is clearly a form of equitable relief that the Court may award, \nwithhold, and craft to fit the circumstances of the case before it.”) (emphasis added); \nConservation Cong. v. United States Forest Serv., 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82440, at *9 (E.D. Cal. \nMay 26, 2017) (finding NEPA violation, declining to vacate agency decision, but enjoining \nDefendants from “removing any trees with 20 inches [diameter at breast height] or greater in \nimplementing the Project”).   \nBecause Defendants should have an opportunity to express their views on the substance \nof Plaintiffs’ requests, the Court will permit abbreviated further briefing on this issue.  \nIV.  Conclusion \nIn light of the “serious possibility” that the Corps will be able to substantiate its prior \nconclusions, the Court finds that vacatur is not the appropriate remedy in this case.  That \ndetermination does not, however, excuse Defendants from giving serious consideration to the \nerrors identified in this Court’s prior Opinion.  Compliance with NEPA cannot be reduced to a \nbureaucratic formality, and the Court expects the Corps not to treat remand as an exercise in \nfilling out the proper paperwork post hoc.  After the agency’s further work on remand, the parties \nmay well disagree over the sufficiency of its conclusion.  If and when such a dispute arises, they \nwill again have the opportunity to address whether Defendants have in fact fulfilled their \nstatutory obligations.  \n/s/ James E.

This Court, meanwhile, has focused \non the specific legal challenges raised by the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux Tribes in \ntheir efforts to block government permitting of the pipeline.  See Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. \nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Standing Rock I), 2016 WL 4734356 (D.D.C. Sept. 9, 2016).   \nAt the start of 2017, that pipeline was nearly complete, save a stretch — awaiting an \neasement — that was designed to run under the bed of Lake Oahe, a federally regulated \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 2 of 38\nwaterway that forms part of the Missouri River and straddles North and South Dakota.  Upon \nassuming office, President Trump directed an expedited approval process, and on February 8, the \nArmy Corps of Engineers issued the easement that permitted Dakota Access to drill under the \nlake.   \nFearing that the presence of oil in the pipeline under Lake Oahe will cause irreparable \nharm to its members’ religious exercise, Cheyenne River responded with a Motion for \nPreliminary Injunction, in which it argues that the easement’s grant violates the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb et seq., and requests that the Court enjoin the \neffect of the easement and thus the flow of oil, which is expected to commence in the next week \nor two.  See ECF No. 156 (Status Report of Dakota Access, Mar. 6, 2017).  As the Court \nconcludes that the extraordinary relief requested is not appropriate in light of both the equitable \ndoctrine of laches and the Tribe’s unlikelihood of success on the merits, it will deny the Motion.  \nI.  Background  \n \n  The Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) is a domestic-oil pipeline designed to move more \nthan half a million gallons of crude oil across four states every day.  Standing Rock I, 2016 WL \n4734356, at *1.  Its construction has sparked legal challenges from several American Indian \ntribes: the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux Tribes here, as well as others.  See Yankton \nSioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, No. 16-1796 (D.D.C., filed Sept. 8, 2016); Oglala \nSioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, No. 17-267 (D.D.C., filed Feb. 11, 2017).  The \npresent action originally sought, in principal part, to block permitting by the Corps of the \nconstruction and operation of DAPL underneath Lake Oahe, a federally regulated waterway \ncreated by the Corps in 1958 via a dam constructed on the Missouri River.  Standing Rock I, \n2016 WL 4734356, at *6.  The Lake Oahe crossing sits about half a mile north of the Standing \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 3 of 38\nRock Reservation and 73 miles north of the Cheyenne River Reservation.  Id.; ECF No. 127-3, \nExh. 1.  The crossing, which will run under the lakebed but not through the water itself, is the \nonly portion of DAPL that is not yet finished. See ECF No. 89-1 (Presidential Memorandum of \nJan. 24, 2017), § 1; Preliminary Injunction Oral Argument Transcript (Feb. 28, 2017) at 9:22-\n10:2. \n  The Court has previously discussed the permitting schemes for construction activities in \nfederally regulated waters and documented the Corps’ application of those schemes to DAPL.  \nSee Standing Rock I, 2016 WL 4734356, at *1-17.  It thus will recap only the developments \nrelevant to the present Motion. \n  Dakota Access formally requested a permanent easement at Lake Oahe in October 2014, \nsee ECF No. 73-4 at 2, and submitted an application for such an easement to the Corps in June \n2015.  See ECF No. 73-5.  On July 25, 2016, the Corps granted permission under the Rivers and \nHarbors Act, 33 U.S.C. § 408, for DAPL’s placement at Lake Oahe.  See ECF No. 73-7.  The \nparties disagree as to whether the Corps also at that time granted an easement pursuant to the \nMineral Leasing Act, 30 U.S.C. § 185.  See ECF No. 57 (Dakota Access Cross-Claim); ECF No. \n66 (Dakota Access Mot. for Summary Judgment); ECF No. 73 (Corps Mot. for Summary \nJudgment).  Two days later, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe filed this suit against the Corps for \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to the National Historic Preservation Act, National \nEnvironmental Policy Act, Clean Water Act, and the Rivers and Harbors Act.  See ECF No. 1 \n(Complaint), ¶¶ 128-212.  Dakota Access successfully moved to intervene in support of the \nCorps on August 5, see ECF No. 7, and Cheyenne River joined as a Plaintiff on August 10.  See \nECF No. 11.  Cheyenne River then filed its own Complaint, see ECF No. 11-12, which it later \namended on September 8.  See ECF No. 37.  Like Standing Rock’s Complaint, Cheyenne \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 4 of 38\nRiver’s pleadings stated claims under the NHPA, NEPA, CWA, and RHA, as well as for breach \nof trust responsibility, and violations of the Flood Control Act and the Administrative Procedure \nAct.  Id. at 38-55.  Significantly, neither Plaintiff asserted a count under the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act.  \n  The Tribes initially sought a preliminary injunction — based solely on the NHPA — \ncontending principally that the clearing and grading of land along the pipeline route desecrated \nsites sacred to them.  On September 9, 2016, immediately after this Court issued its Opinion \ndenying that motion, see Standing Rock I, 2016 WL 4734356, the Departments of Justice, the \nInterior, and the Army issued a joint statement explaining that because “important issues raised \nby the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and other tribal nations and their members regarding the \nDakota Access pipeline” remained, “construction of the pipeline on Army Corps land bordering \nor under Lake Oahe [would] not go forward” until the Army could determine whether \nreconsideration of any of its previous decisions regarding the Lake Oahe crossing under NEPA \nor other federal laws was necessary.  See ECF No. 42-1 at 1.   \nTwo months later, on November 14, 2016, Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil \nWorks Jo-Ellen Darcy wrote to Dakota Access and Standing Rock to explain that the Army had \ncompleted the review called for on September 9 and had “determined that additional discussion \nwith the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and analysis [were] warranted.”  ECF No. 56-1 at 2.  The \nArmy invited Standing Rock to engage in discussions concerning “[p]otential conditions in an \neasement for the pipeline crossing” and “[i]n light of such conditions, whether to grant an \neasement for the pipeline to cross Lake Oahe at the location currently proposed.”  Id. \nThen, on December 4, Assistant Secretary Darcy issued a memorandum to the Corps’ \nCommander stating that the Army would “not grant an easement to cross Lake Oahe at the \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 5 of 38\nproposed location based on the current record.”  ECF No. 65-1, ¶ 12 (emphasis added).  She \ndirected a “robust consideration of reasonable alternatives,” which she thought would be “best \naccomplished . . . by preparing an Environmental Impact Statement.”  Id.  On January 18, 2017, \nDarcy published in the Federal Register a notice of intent to prepare an EIS.  See 82 Fed. Reg. \n5,543 (Jan. 18, 2017).  \nThe government’s position on the easement shifted significantly, however, once President \nTrump assumed office.  A Presidential Memorandum issued on January 24, 2017, directed the \nSecretary of the Army to instruct the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works and the \nCorps “to take all actions necessary and appropriate to . . . review and approve in an expedited \nmanner, to the extent permitted by law and as warranted, and with such conditions as are \nnecessary or appropriate, requests for approvals to construct and operate the DAPL, including \neasements or rights-of-way” and to “consider, to the extent permitted by law and as warranted, \nwhether to rescind or modify” the December 4 memorandum.  See ECF No. 89-1, § 2.  The \nArmy completed a review, see ECF No. 114-1 (Memorandum re: Dakota Access Pipeline; \nUSACE Technical & Legal Review for the Dep’t of the Army, Feb. 3, 2017), provided notice to \nCongress of its intent to issue the easement, see ECF No. 95, and did so on February 8.  See ECF \nNo. 96-1.  \nThe next day, Cheyenne River filed the present Motion for Preliminary Injunction along \nwith an Application for a Temporary Restraining Order.  See ECF No. 99.  The Tribe does not \nconsistently describe the nature of the requested injunctive relief.  At points, it asks that the \nCourt direct the Corps “to withdraw the easement.”  Notice of Mot. at 1; ECF No. 98-12 (Text of \nProposed PI Order) at 1.  It elsewhere asks the Court to enjoin “the effect of the easement” and to \nenjoin further construction by Dakota Access “in the area described in the easement.”  Mot. at 1; \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 6 of 38\nsee also id. at 2, 3-4.  Because the impact of withdrawing the easement or suspending its effect \nwould presumably be the same — halting any additional construction under and on either side of \nLake Oahe and preventing the flow of oil — the Court need not parse the different terminology.   \nThe sole cause of action raised in the TRO and this Motion is the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act.  Id.; ECF No. 98 (Mot.).  Specifically, Cheyenne River contends:  \nThe Lakota people believe that the mere existence of a crude oil \npipeline under the waters of Lake Oahe will desecrate those waters \nand render them unsuitable for use in their religious sacraments. . . .  \nThe Lakota people believe that the pipeline correlates with a terrible \nBlack Snake prophesied to come into the Lakota homeland and \ncause destruction. . . .  The Lakota believe that the very existence of \nthe  Black  Snake  under  their  sacred  waters  in  Lake  Oahe  will \nunbalance and desecrate the water and render it impossible for the \nLakota to use that water in their Inipi ceremony. \n \nMot. at 2-3.  Because Cheyenne River had not previously pled a RFRA claim, it has also sought \nleave to file a Second Amended Complaint.  See ECF No. 97.  For purposes of resolving the \npresent Motion, the Court assumes it will grant the Tribe’s motion for leave to amend, such that \nthe RFRA claim is properly before it.         \nThe Court held a hearing on the TRO on February 13.  Finding that no harm to religious \nexercise was imminent, as oil was not yet set to flow through DAPL, the Court denied the \napplication.  See Minute Order of Feb. 13, 2017; ECF No. 119 (TRO Oral Argument Transcript, \nFeb. 13, 2017) at 29:20-30:19.  It then set a compressed briefing schedule on the instant Motion \nfor Preliminary Injunction and heard argument on February 28.  It issues this Opinion on an \nexpedited basis.   \nII.  Legal Standard \n“[I]njunctive relief” is “an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear \nshowing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.”  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 7 of 38\nU.S. 7, 22 (2008).  “A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish [1] that he is \nlikely to succeed on the merits, [2] that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \npreliminary relief, [3] that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and [4] that an injunction is in \nthe public interest.”  Id. at 20.   \nBefore the Supreme Court’s decision in Winter, courts weighed the preliminary-\ninjunction factors on a sliding scale, allowing a weak showing on one factor to be overcome by a \nstrong showing on another.  See, e.g., Davenport v. Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters, 166 F.3d 356, 360-\n61 (D.C. Cir. 1999).  This Circuit, however, has suggested that Winter should be read to abandon \nthe sliding-scale analysis in favor of a “more demanding burden” requiring plaintiffs to \nindependently demonstrate both a likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm.  See \nSherley v. Sebelius, 644 F.3d 388, 392-93 (D.C. Cir. 2011); Davis v. Pension Benefit Guar. \nCorp., 571 F.3d 1288, 1292 (D.C. Cir. 2009).  Whether a sliding-scale analysis still exists or not, \ncourts in our Circuit have held that a failure to show a likelihood of success on the merits alone \nis sufficient to defeat the motion.  Ark. Dairy Co-op Ass’n, Inc. v. USDA, 573 F.3d 815, 832 \n(D.C. Cir. 2009) (citing Apotex, Inc. v. FDA, 449 F.3d 1249, 1253 (D.C. Cir. 2006)).   \nIII.   Analysis \n \nCheyenne River seeks preliminary-injunctive relief to protect its members’ free exercise \nof religion, which it argues will be compromised by the presence of crude oil in the Dakota \nAccess pipeline under Lake Oahe.  See TRO Tr. at 9:10-12, 11:3-4.  Because construction on \nthat portion of the pipeline is now underway and oil is likely to start flowing through the \ncompleted pipeline in the next week or two, see DA Mar. 6 Status Report, the Tribe asserts that \nits members’ rights are in imminent danger.  It thus insists that the Court must enjoin the effect \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 8 of 38\nof the easement — namely, Dakota Access’s ability to operate the pipeline under Lake Oahe — \nwhile it weighs the merits of the Tribe’s RFRA claim.   \nIn response, the Corps and Dakota Access raise myriad arguments, among them that the \nTribe has not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits both because its RFRA claim is \nbarred by laches and because it failed to show a substantial burden on its members’ religious \nexercise.  The Court largely agrees, concluding that laches bars the preliminary-injunctive relief \nrequested (but not the RFRA claim itself) and that the Tribe’s substantial-burden position is \nunlikely to achieve success on the merits.  Having so decided, the Court need not consider the \nremaining three factors of the preliminary-injunction analysis — irreparable harm, balance of \nequities, and public interest — or Defendants’ other contentions.  \nA.  Laches \nLaches is an equitable defense “‘designed to promote diligence and prevent enforcement \nof stale claims’ by those who have ‘slumber[ed] on their rights.’”  Menominee Indian Tribe of \nWisc. v. United States, 614 F.3d 519, 531 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (quoting Gull Airborne Instructions, \nInc. v. Weinberger, 694 F.2d 838, 843 (D.C. Cir. 1982)).  As a general matter, it applies “where \nthere is (1) lack of diligence by the party against whom the defense is asserted, and (2) prejudice \nto the party asserting the defense.”  Id. (quotation marks and citation omitted).  How a court \napplies laches, however, turns on whether the relief requested is legal or equitable, whether the \nlegislature has supplied a statute of limitations, and, if so, whether that limitations period has run.  \nSee Petrella v. Metro-Goldwin-Mayer, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 1962, 1973-74 (2014).   \nWhere Congress has provided a statute of limitations and a plaintiff brings a claim for \nlegal relief within the time period, laches cannot be invoked to preclude adjudication of the claim \nor to bar that type of relief.  Id. at 1967, 1974.  Where a plaintiff brings a claim for equitable \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 9 of 38\nrelief within the time period, conversely, “laches may bar at the very threshold the particular \nrelief requested” only if “extraordinary circumstances” are present.  Id. at 1967; 1977-78 (citing \nChirco v. Crosswinds Communities, Inc., 474 F.3d 227 (6th Cir. 2007); New Era Publications \nInt’l v. Henry Holt & Co., 873 F.2d 576, 584-85 (2d Cir. 1989)).  Absent such circumstances, a \ncourt may take account of the plaintiff’s delay at the remedial stage when determining the \nappropriate injunctive relief.  Id. at 1967; 1978-79.   \nRFRA is subject to a four-year statute of limitations.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1658; see also \nGarraway v. Lappin, 2012 WL 959422, at *3 (M.D. Penn. Mar. 21, 2012); Al-Sadun v. DCFS, \n2011 WL 1378638, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 11, 2011); Pineda-Morales v. De Rosa, 2005 WL \n1607276, at *8 (D.N.J. July 6, 2005); Jama v. U.S. INS, 343 F. Supp. 2d 338, 365 (D.N.J. 2004).  \nDefendants do not mention this statute or assert that extraordinary circumstances are present \nhere.  The Court, consequently, does not acquiesce in their position that laches bars the RFRA \nclaim in its entirety.  See DA Opp. at 1, 10; Corps Opp. at 10-15.   \nThat conclusion, however, does not mean that laches is an irrelevant consideration here.  \nOn the contrary, a court assessing whether to award the “extraordinary remedy” of preliminary-\ninjunctive relief, Winter, 555 U.S. at 22, may determine whether laches renders that relief \ninappropriate.  See, e.g., Perry v. Judd, 840 F. Supp. 2d 945, 953-55 (E.D. Va. 2012) (discussing \nwhether laches precluded preliminary-injunctive relief prior to undertaking four-factor analysis).  \nThe Court will thus proceed to analyze Defendants’ contention that the Tribe delayed in filing \nsuit on its RFRA claim and thereby caused them prejudice.    \n1.  Lack of Diligence \nRun-of-the-mill delay is not sufficient to warrant the application of laches.  Menominee \nIndian Tribe, 614 F.3d at 531.  The “party seeking relief” must have delayed “inexcusably or \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 10 of 38\nunreasonably.”  Id. (quotation marks and citation omitted) (emphasis added).  As explained \nbelow, although the Tribe learned of DAPL’s proposed route in October 2014, when the Corps \nsolicited its input on the project, and the Corps issued some of the authorizations necessary for \nDakota Access to drill at Lake Oahe in July 2016, Cheyenne River waited until February 2017 to \nvoice its concern that, given the Black Snake prophecy, the mere presence of oil in the pipeline \nwould impose a substantial burden on its members’ religious exercise and to seek to raise a \nRFRA claim.   \nIn accordance with the consultation process required by Section 106 of the NHPA, the \nCorps sent a letter to tribes, including Cheyenne River, on October 24, 2014, with information \nabout the proposed DAPL project and maps illustrating its location and nearby cultural sites.  See \nECF No. 127-5 (Declaration of Richard Harnois), ¶ 7.  The letter requested comments from the \nTribe within 30 days of its receipt.  Id.  Cheyenne River did not respond until March 23, 2015.  \nId., ¶¶ 8-9, 12.   \nOver the next several months, the Corps invited the Tribe to weigh in on DAPL, \nincluding via site visits and meetings.  Id., ¶¶ 12-30.  Cheyenne River submitted comments in \nperson and via email, phone, and letter, id., ¶ 30, some of which alerted the Corps in general \nterms that DAPL might affect sacred sites, including water.  But the Tribe never asserted that the \npipeline’s operation itself under Lake Oahe — absent any spill or rupture — would somehow \ncompromise the purity of the water and pose a religious-exercise problem.  See, e.g., ECF No. \n115-2, Exh. B (Letter from Steve Vance to Richard Harnois, Corps Sr. Field Archaeologist, Aug. \n17, 2015) at 2 (“DAPL cannot address the [e]ffects to cultural and historical resources, Sacred \nsites (water included), Traditional Cultural Properties, Properties of Cultural or Religious \nSignifican[ce] to Tribe, etc., of the proposed pipeline when they have not been properly \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 11 of 38\nidentified.”); ECF No. 115-2, Exh. C (Federal Consultation with Tribes Regarding Infrastructure \nDecision-Making, Oct. 27, 2016) at 145:15-17 (“Water is sacred to us.”); Hanois Decl., ¶¶ 31-\n33; ECF No. 143-1 (Transcript of NHPA Consultation Meeting, Feb. 18-19, 2016) at 3 (Steve \nVance, Cheyenne River’s Tribal Historic Preservation Officer: “The water is the big thing.  You \nknow, we as tribes and Cheyenne River went on record and saying that water is a sacred object.  \nIf you look at the sacred site policy and that it says ‘other things’, it [doesn’t] say the water. . . .  \nAnd here we are[,] this is it.  I mean, when that’s gone we’re all hurting.”).   \nIn August and September 2016, a few weeks after the Corps granted some of the \nauthorizations necessary for Dakota Access to drill under Lake Oahe, the Tribe filed its \nComplaint and Amended Complaint.  In those pleadings, Cheyenne River continued to refer only \ngenerally to water as religiously significant and to focus on the risk posed by spills or leaks and \nthe possible harm to sacred sites from clearing, grading, and construction activities.  See, e.g., \nECF No. 11-12, ¶ 1 (“The construction and operation of the pipeline . . . will damage and destroy \nsites of great historic, religious, and cultural significance to the Tribe.”); id., ¶ 42 (“The Tribe is \ngreatly concerned with the possibility of oil spills and leaks from the pipeline should it be \nconstructed and operated, particularly into waters that are of considerable economic, religious, \nand cultural importance to the Tribe.”); id., ¶ 74 (“[T]he cultural and religious significance of \nthese waters cannot be overstated.  An oil spill from the pipeline into Lake Oahe would cause an \neconomic, public health and welfare, and cultural crisis of the greatest magnitude.”); id., ¶ 76 \n(“[T]he Lake Oahe crossing will take place in an area of great cultural, religious and spiritual \nsignificance to the Tribe.  Construction of the pipeline . . . would destroy burial grounds, sacred \nsites, and historically significant areas on either side of Lake Oahe.”); ECF No. 37, ¶ 2 (“The \nwaters of the Missouri River . . . are sacred to the Lakota people of the Cheyenne River Sioux \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 12 of 38\nTribe and constitute the lifeblood of our religion and traditions.”); ¶ 61 (“The waters of the \nMissouri River moreover are sacred to the Tribe and essential to the Tribe’s practice of our \nreligion.”).  \nA declaration from the Tribe’s Environmental Director/Research Specialist, filed in \nAugust 2016 with its motion to join Standing Rock’s NHPA preliminary-injunction motion, \nlikewise did not state that the mere presence of oil in a pipeline under the lake’s floor would \nrender the Tribe’s members unable to perform religious ceremonies, nor did it mention the Black \nSnake.  See ECF No. 19-6 (Declaration of Dave Nelson).  Instead, it explained that “numerous . . \n. spiritual sites [exist] beneath the waters of the proposed DAPL pipeline crossing,” that “[t]he \nwater of the Missouri river and its tributaries is an essential component of many traditional \nLakota cultural and spiritual practices” and is “used in numerous traditional ceremonies,” and \nthat construction of DAPL could harm the Tribe and its members because “the proposed use of \nexplosives on the river bed . . . has a high likelihood of destroying or irreversibly damaging . . . \nspiritual sites,” construction operations could destroy plants, and “due to the presence of historic \npollutants . . . [,] construction and pipeline operation activities [could] contaminate the region’s \nwater in such a way that would negatively impact the Tribe’s and its members’ ability to conduct \ntraditional medicinal and spiritual ceremonies and practices.”  Id., ¶¶ 5, 6, 9.   \nAfter the government announced in September 2016 that it intended to pause construction \nat the Lake Oahe crossing pending further review, Standing Rock explained in a letter to \nAssistant Secretary Darcy that “water itself plays a central role in the religious and cultural \nbeliefs of the Tribe.”  ECF No. 115-4, Exh. D (Letter from Standing Rock Sioux Tribe to Jo-\nEllen Darcy, Sept. 22, 2016) at 5.  To support that contention, it quoted part of a declaration from \nStanding Rock’s Chairman in which he discussed the risks to the Tribe’s religious practice from \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 13 of 38\nan oil spill: “Our Sundance, a spiritual ceremony sacred to us, is performed on the banks of the \nriver.  [When a pipeline leaks into Lake Oahe], [t]he source of life, as well as spiritual continuity, \nwould be damaged.”  Id. at 6 (emphasis added) (alterations in original) (quoting ECF No. 6-1 \n(Declaration of Dave Archambault II, Aug. 4, 2016), ¶ 12).  (The unaltered declaration reads: \n“When the pipeline leaks, the Missouri river — the source of our drinking water, where we fish, \nswim, and conduct ceremonies — will be contaminated.  Our Sundance, a spiritual ceremony \nsacred to us, is performed on the banks of the river.  The source of life, as well as spiritual \ncontinuity, would be damaged.”).  The letter then stated that “[t]he close connection between the \nwaters of Lake Oahe and the religious practices of the Tribe implicate federal laws protecting \nIndian religious freedom,” quoted language from the American Indian Religious Freedom Act \nand RFRA, and noted, “The Final EA does not mention these laws.”  Id.  \nFor more than two years after becoming aware of DAPL’s proposed route, construction, \nand operation, then, Cheyenne River remained silent as to the Black Snake prophecy and its \nconcerns about the presence of oil in the pipeline under Lake Oahe absent any issue of rupture, \nas well as about the possible applicability of RFRA.  In an effort to explain its delay, the Tribe \nargues that the Corps never engaged in proper consultations and that it was told by the Corps that \nthe review process announced by Assistant Secretary Darcy on December 4, 2016, “would be the \nvehicle by which they could express their concerns and press their rights with the government.”  \nECF No. 97 (Mot. to Amend Complaint) at 3; ECF No. 141 (Reply) at 3-4; TRO Tr. at 7:17-23.   \nThis explanation is unsatisfactory.  In spite of an allegedly inadequate consultation \nprocess, the Tribe was still able to raise specific concerns about, for example, harm to water \nsafety and burial sites, and to plead claims under the NHPA, NEPA, and other environmental \nstatutes in its August and September filings.  It is not clear what prevented Cheyenne River from \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 14 of 38\nalso raising its specific religious-exercise concerns with the Corps or in its Complaints here.  The \nCourt, accordingly, concludes that Defendants have shown that the Tribe inexcusably delayed in \nvoicing its RFRA objection.  \n2.  Prejudice \nDefendants argue, moreover, that they have suffered prejudice from Cheyenne River’s \nunjustified delay because had they been made aware of the Tribe’s specific religious objection to \nthe Lake Oahe crossing earlier, they could have considered whether and how to accommodate \nthis concern.  See ECF No. 127 (Corps Opp.) at 11; ECF No. 124 (DA Opp.) at 10-11.  The \nCorps represented at oral argument on the instant Motion that had it known of the Tribe’s beliefs \nduring the permitting process, rerouting the pipeline north of Lake Oahe could have been “one \npossibility.”  PI Tr. at 28:12-22.  Indeed, Defendants previously modified the pipeline workspace \nand route more than a hundred times in response to cultural surveys and Tribes’ concerns \nregarding historic and cultural resources.  See Standing Rock I, 2016 WL 4734356, at *7, 13.  \nThe Corps also imposed additional construction conditions on DAPL in response to tribal \npositions regarding environmental safety.  Id. at *14.  Notably, such changes were made prior to \nany litigation.   \nAt this point, however, the Corps has granted the permits and easement, and DAPL’s \nconstruction under Lake Oahe is days from completion.  See DA Mar. 6 Status Report.  \nSuspending the effect of the easement now would undercut the purpose behind the consultation \nobligations built into the Corps’ permitting processes, which aim to surface tribal concerns in a \ntimely manner.  Such injunctive relief would also, by delaying the flow of oil, impose significant \ncosts on a private third party, Dakota Access.  And if the Tribe were ultimately to prevail on the \nmerits of its RFRA claim, rerouting the pipeline around Lake Oahe would be more costly and \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 15 of 38\ncomplicated than it would have been months or years ago, as doing so now requires not simply \nchanging plans but abandoning part of a near-complete project and redoing the construction \nelsewhere.  See, e.g., Daingerfield Island Protective Soc’y v. Lujan, 920 F.2d 32, 39 (D.C. Cir. \n1990) (explaining whether relief sought “is still practicable” is a “crucial” consideration that “has \nturned on the degree to which construction is complete”) (listing cases).  \nIn asking the Court to grant a preliminary injunction suspending the effect of the \neasement and halting the construction and operation of the pipeline below Lake Oahe, Cheyenne \nRiver requests “an extraordinary and drastic remedy.”  Munaf v. Green, 553 U.S. 674, 689 \n(2008) (citation omitted).  Although it does so within RFRA’s four-year statute of limitations, the \nrequest comes long after Cheyenne River learned of the pipeline’s proposed route, was invited to \noffer feedback, articulated other specific environmental and cultural issues, and filed suit on \nother claims.  Only once Dakota Access had built up to the water’s edge and the Corps had \ngranted the easement to proceed did Cheyenne River inform Defendants that the pipeline was the \nrealization of a long-held prophecy about a Black Snake and that the mere presence of oil in the \npipeline under the lakebed would interfere with the Tribe’s members’ ability to engage in \nimportant religious practices.  Because of the Plaintiff’s delay in raising this religious-exercise \nobjection and the negative impact of that delay on the Corps and Dakota Access, the Court \nconcludes that the requested preliminary-injunctive relief is barred by laches.     \nB.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nThe Court also believes the Tribe has failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the \nmerits of its RFRA claim.  Enacted in 1993, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act provides that \nthe “Government shall not substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion” unless “it \ndemonstrates that application of the burden . . . (1) is in furtherance of a compelling \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 16 of 38\ngovernmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling \ngovernmental interest.”  42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1.  A person who brings a challenge under RFRA \nbears the initial burden of proving that (1) the Government’s policy or action implicates her \nreligious exercise, (2) the relevant religious exercise is grounded in a sincerely held religious \nbelief, and (3) the policy or action substantially burdens that exercise.  See Holt v. Hobbs, 135 S. \nCt. 853, 862 (2015) (discussing burdens in Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act \naction); id. at 860 (explaining RLUIPA is governed by same standard as set forth in RFRA) \n(citing Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418 (2006)).  The \nCourt discusses whether the Tribe is likely to satisfy each of these initial three prongs in turn.  As \nit answers this question in the negative, the Court need not look into whether the government \ninterest is compelling or if its action is the least restrictive means.  \n1.  Implicates Religious Exercise  \n \nHere, the religious exercise at issue is the performance of water-based ceremonies.  \nCheyenne River is composed of four bands of the Lakota people, see Mot. at 4, who “believe \ngenerally that water is sacred and that clean, pure water is an essential part of the Lakota way of \nlife.”  Id. at 7.  Water plays a “specific, critical role in the practice of the Lakota sacred rites,” \nincluding the Hanbleceya (vision-questing), Wiwanyan Wacipi (birth and renewal), Isnati \nAwiciliwanpi (coming of age for young women), Wiping of the Tears (conclusion of mourning), \nand Inipi (prayer and purification) ceremonies.  Id. at 7-8 (citing Declaration of Steve Vance \n(Jan. 30, 2017), ¶ 11a).  According to Steve Vance, Cheyenne River’s Tribal Historic \nPreservation Officer, these ceremonies are an essential aspect of the Lakota religion; its \nadherents “cannot practice [their] religion without [their] ceremonies.”  Vance Decl., ¶ 11a.   \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 17 of 38\nDefendants do not dispute that these sacred rites constitute religious exercise.  Instead, \nthey argue that it is Dakota Access, not the government, whose actions implicate such exercise, \nthereby removing this case from the protections of RFRA.  See DA Opp. at 14-16; Corps Opp. at \n24-27.  They rely for that argument on Village of Bensenville v. Federal Aviation \nAdministration, 457 F.3d 52 (D.C. Cir. 2006), which considered whether RFRA required strict \nscrutiny of the FAA’s approval of Chicago’s plan to update and reconfigure O’Hare International \nAirport.  Id. at 57.  The plan involved relocating a church cemetery, and several individuals and \nentities sued the FAA, arguing that its approval violated RFRA.  Id.  The D.C. Circuit held that \nthe Act did not apply because any burden caused by the City’s plan was “not fairly attributable to \nthe FAA.”  Id.  “[C]onstitutional standards do not attach to conduct by third parties in which the \nfederal government merely acquiesces,” it explained.  Id.  There must be a “sufficiently close \nnexus between the [federal government] and the challenged action” of the third party “so that the \naction of the latter may be fairly treated as that of the [federal government] itself.”  Id. at 62 \n(quoting Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991, 1004 (1982)) (alterations in original).   \nDefendants contend that, as in Bensenville, Dakota Access’s operating of the pipeline is \nthe third-party conduct that burdens Cheyenne River’s members’ free exercise of religion, and \nthe Corps’ permitting is mere acquiescence.  Whereas Bensenville involved “the government’s \nregulation of a third party’s use of the third party’s land,” however, this case involves “the \ngovernment’s use of its own land.”  Id. at 67.  The Corps and Dakota Access argue that the \nopinion’s logic regarding responsibility for the burden on religious exercise nonetheless applies \nhere, see PI Tr. at 32:12-19, 49:19-50:4, but because the Court ultimately concludes that \nCheyenne River is unlikely to succeed on the merits for other reasons, it need not resolve this \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 18 of 38\ndispute.  It therefore assumes without deciding that the Corps’ action implicates the Tribe’s \nreligious exercise.   \n2.  Sincerely Held Religious Belief \n \nCheyenne River’s members believe that the water used in Lakota ceremonies, particularly \nthe Inipi ceremony, must be “ritually pure.”  Mot. at 9; see Vance Decl., ¶ 16 (water must be \n“pure, natural,” not “bottled” or “contaminated”); ECF No. 98-3 (Declaration of Marcella \nGilbert), ¶ 6 (“Clean, undisturbed water is necessary in every ceremony.”); ECF No. 98-4 \n(Declaration of Russ Cournoyer), ¶ 7 (“We cannot use . . . water that has been affected by \nartificial chemicals.”); ECF No. 98-5 (Declaration of Ron Black Bird), ¶ 9 (same).  Tribe \nmembers further believe that the mere presence of oil in the Dakota Access Pipeline will \ncontaminate the lake’s waters and render them unsuitable for use in their religious practices.  See \nVance Decl., ¶¶ 18-19; see also TRO Tr. at 9:9-12.  According to Plaintiff, such desecration \noccurs whether or not the pipeline ruptures and the oil actually touches the water, and even \nthough the pipeline itself never enters the lake’s waters but instead runs under the lakebed.  The \nexistence of the oil within the pipeline under the lake is enough.  See PI Tr. at 9:22-10:2.  \nIn addition to the religious significance attaching to water generally, the Tribe ascribes \nparticular meaning to the Missouri River, of which Lake Oahe is part.  The Lakota chose to live \nnear the Missouri “because of its importance to [their] existence.”  Vance Decl., ¶ 11; Mot. at 9-\n10.  As “other bodies of water important in [their] culture were removed from [their access]” by \nthe United States, “such as waters in the Black Hills,” the Missouri took on even greater \nimportance to the Tribe.  See Vance Decl., ¶ 11.  Vance states, “[The Missouri River] is \nimportant to our spirituality.  It is an important source of our foods, medicines, water for \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 19 of 38\ndrinking, and for living.  It is the bloodline and the lifeline of the people at this time, and we \ncannot live without it.”  Id.   \nThe Tribe contends in its Motion, moreover, that its members “must rely on Lake Oahe \nexclusively . . . for the water they use in their religious ceremonies because Lake Oahe is the \nonly source of natural, pure, uncontaminated water available to the people of the Cheyenne River \nSioux Reservation.”  Mot. at 13; see also Vance Decl., ¶¶ 15-16.  The Lakota also contend that \nthey “own . . . these waters that comprise Lake Oahe,” and so “believe that the existence of this \ncrude oil pipeline under the Lake Oahe Reservoir poses a special threat to the way [they] practice \n[their] religion.”  Vance Decl., ¶ 18. \nAs the Corps and Dakota Access note, Lake Oahe is not untouched by manmade projects.  \nSee DA Opp. at 28; Corps Opp. at 4.  DAPL’s crossing, for instance, runs parallel, at a distance \nof 22 to 300 feet, to a natural-gas pipeline that was built under the lake in 1982.  Standing Rock \nI, 2016 WL 4734356, at *7, 26.  It also tracks an already existing overhead utility line.  Id. at *7.  \nSeveral other oil pipelines cross the Missouri River upstream of Lake Oahe, including one \nlocated just 7.5 miles north of the lake (44 miles north of the DAPL crossing).  See Corps Opp. \nat 5; ECF No. 127-3, Exh. 1.  In addition, three vehicle bridges and one railroad bridge cross \nover Lake Oahe at locations closer to the Cheyenne River Reservation than the DAPL crossing, \nwhich is 73 miles away.  See ECF No. 127-3, Exh. 1.  And a wastewater-treatment plant is \nauthorized to discharge into a tributary to a river that flows through the Reservation into Lake \nOahe.  See Corps Opp. at 5 (citing City of Eagle Butte NPDES Permit (Sept. 30, 2011), \nhttps://www.epa.gov/region8/city-eagle-butte-npdes-permit).        \nThe Tribe acknowledges the presence of the natural-gas pipeline under Lake Oahe but \nexplains that it does not believe that that pipeline burdens its religious practice.  See Mot. at 43.  \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 20 of 38\nThe difference between the natural-gas pipeline and DAPL is that the Tribe believes that the \ncrude oil that is proposed to flow through the latter is the fulfillment of a Lakota prophecy of “a \nBlack Snake that would be coiled in the Tribe’s homeland and which would harm . . . [and] \ndevour the people.”  Mot. at 19; see also Vance Decl., ¶ 18.  According to Vance, the oil in \nDAPL, like the Black Snake, “is black, it is slippery, and it moves.”  Id.  As to the other oil \npipelines upstream of Lake Oahe, Cheyenne River asserts that only Lake Oahe constitutes its \n“area of concern.”  TRO Tr. at 14:24; see also id. at 15:3-5 (“[W]e’re not concerned about oil \npipelines that may be somewhere above outside of waters that we own in Lake Oahe.”).  \nThe record is not clear whether the Black Snake prophecy was made before or after Lake \nOahe was created nearly 60 years ago.  The Tribe’s brief contends that “Lakota religious \nadherents now in their 50s and 60s were warned of the Black Snake by their elders as children,” \nMot. at 19; see also id. at 28, and Vance states that the prophecy was made “[l]ong ago.”  Vance \nDecl., ¶ 18.  Presumably, the prophecy was issued after Lake Oahe was created; otherwise, the \npresence of pipelines upstream of the lake, including one that crosses 7.5 miles to its north, \nwould be hard to reconcile with the Tribe’s belief that DAPL alone is the Black Snake.  See TRO \nTr. 15:3-5. \n“To qualify for RFRA’s protection, an asserted belief must be ‘sincere,’” not pretextual.  \nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2751, 2774 n.28 (2014).  Courts generally \nhandle “the sincerity inquiry . . . with a light touch, or ‘judicial shyness.’”  Moussazadeh v. Tex. \nDep’t of Criminal Justice, 703 F.3d 781, 792 (5th Cir. 2012); see also Hernandez v. \nCommissioner of Internal Revenue, 490 U.S. 680, 699 (1989) (“It is not within the judicial ken \nto question the centrality of particular beliefs or practices to a faith, or the validity of particular \nlitigants’ interpretations of those creeds.”); Kay v. Bemis, 500 F.3d 1214, 1219 (10th Cir. 2007) \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 21 of 38\n(“The inquiry into the sincerity of a free-exercise plaintiff’s religious beliefs is almost \nexclusively a credibility assessment.”) (citation omitted).  In light of instructions to tread gently \nwith its sincerity inquiry, therefore, the Court finds that the Tribe is likely to successfully \nestablish a sincerely held belief that the presence of oil in the Dakota Access pipeline running \nunder Lake Oahe interferes with its members’ religious ceremonies.   \nHaving so concluded, the Court now proceeds to consider whether the Tribe is likely to \nsatisfy the third of its prima facie RFRA obligations: a substantial burden on its religious \nexercise. \n3.  Substantial Burden \nRFRA does not define “substantial burden,” and the Supreme Court has not articulated a \nprecise definition.  This Circuit, however, has stated that “[a] substantial burden exists when \ngovernment action puts ‘substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate \nhis beliefs.’”  Kaemmerling v. Lappin, 553 F.3d 669, 678 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (quoting Thomas v. \nReview Bd., 450 U.S. 707, 718 (1981)).  It offered Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398 (1963), as \nan example of such substantial pressure.  That case involved “the denial of unemployment \nbenefits to a Sabbatarian who could not find suitable non-Saturday employment,” which “forced \nher ‘to choose between following the precepts of her religion and forfeiting benefits, on the one \nhand, and abandoning one of the precepts of her religion in order to accept work, on the other \nhand.’”  Kaemmerling, 553 F.3d at 678 (quoting Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 404).   \nUsing that test, the Circuit rejected Kaemmerling’s RFRA claim.  The plaintiff, a federal \nprisoner, objected on religious grounds to the government’s extracting DNA information from a \nfluid or tissue sample taken from him by the Bureau of Prisons.  Id. at 673, 678-79.  The Circuit \nconcluded that he had failed to allege facts sufficient to state a substantial burden cognizable \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 22 of 38\nunder RFRA because the government’s actions did not “‘pressure [him] to modify his behavior \nand to violate his beliefs’” or require him to choose “between criminal sanction and personally \nviolating his own religious beliefs.”  Id. at 679-80 (quoting Thomas v. Review Bd., 450 U.S. \n707, 718 (1981)).   \nThe government action here — i.e., granting the easement to Dakota Access and thereby \nenabling the flow of oil beneath Lake Oahe — does not impose a sanction on the Tribe’s \nmembers for exercising their religious beliefs, nor does it pressure them to choose between \nreligious exercise and the receipt of government benefits.  Cheyenne River argues that whether it \nhas been subjected to such sanction or pressure is irrelevant, see Reply at 14-16, and contends \ninstead that it is sufficient for purposes of showing substantial burden that the effect of the \ngovernment’s action is to prevent the Tribe’s members from performing required religious \nsacraments at Lake Oahe.  See Mot. at 30-31; Reply at 14.  That argument, however, is directly \nat odds with Supreme Court precedent.   \nLyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Association, 485 U.S. 439 (1988), was a \ncase concerning an American Indian tribe’s Free Exercise challenge to federal government \nactions involving sacred sites on federal land.  The Supreme Court held that the incidental effect \non religious exercise of a government action undertaken in furtherance of the management and \nuse of government land, even if extreme, is not alone enough to give rise to a Free Exercise \nclaim.  That decision leads this Court to conclude that Cheyenne River is unlikely to establish \nthat the Corps’ grant of the easement imposes a substantial burden on its religious exercise such \nthat it will succeed on the merits of its RFRA claim.    \n \n \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 23 of 38\na.  The Force of Lyng \n  In Lyng, “an Indian organization, individual Indians, nature organizations and individual \nmembers of those organizations, and the State of California” challenged under the Free Exercise \nClause the United States Forest Service’s decision to build a six-mile segment of paved road and \npermit significant timber harvesting in a government-owned area considered sacred by several \ntribes.  Id. at 442-43.  The plaintiffs contended that the “disruption of the natural environment \ncaused by the . . . road will diminish the sacredness of the area in question” and interfere with \ntribal members’ use of sites there for religious practice.  Id. at 448.   \nThe Supreme Court acknowledged that the Forest Service’s decisions “would interfere \nsignificantly with private persons’ ability to pursue spiritual fulfillment according to their own \nreligious beliefs.”  Id. at 449.  Indeed, it explained that it had “no reason to doubt[] that the \nlogging and road-building projects at issue . . . could have devastating effects on traditional \nIndian religious practices,” including their inability “to conduct a wide variety of specific rituals \nthat aim to accomplish their religious goals.”  Id. at 451.  But the Court nonetheless concluded \nthat the government’s actions did not cause the kind of harm cognizable under the Free Exercise \nClause because they did not “coerce[]” the affected individuals “into violating their religious \nbeliefs” or “penalize religious activity by denying any person an equal share of the rights, \nbenefits, and privileges enjoyed by other citizens.”  Id. at 449.  Ultimately, the Court explained, \nthese harms were “incidental effects of government programs, which may make it more difficult \nto practice certain religions but which have no tendency to coerce individuals into acting \ncontrary to their religious beliefs.”  Id. at 450.  “Whatever may be the exact line between \nunconstitutional prohibitions on the free exercise of religion and the legitimate conduct by \ngovernment of its own affairs, the location of the line cannot depend on measuring the effects of \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 24 of 38\na governmental action on a religious objector’s spiritual development,” even where the effect on \nreligious practice is “extremely grave.”  Id. at 451.  \nAs should be evident from the language it used to discuss the impact on the tribe’s \nreligious exercise — e.g., “devastating” and “extremely grave,” id. at 451 — the Supreme Court \nwas not unsympathetic to the plight of the affected individuals.  Id. at 456.  And it cautioned that \n“[n]othing in [its] opinion should be read to encourage governmental insensitivity to the religious \nneeds of any citizen” or to dissuade the government from accommodating religious practices.  Id. \nat 453.  But the effects of the Forest Service’s actions simply did not raise a constitutional \nconcern: “However much we might wish that it were otherwise, government simply could not \noperate if it were required to satisfy every citizen’s religious needs and desires.”  Id. at 452.  \n“[T]he Free Exercise Clause is written in terms of what the government cannot do to the \nindividual, not in terms of what the individual can exact from the government.”  Id. at 451 \n(quoting Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 412 (Douglas, J., concurring)). \nCheyenne River’s religious-exercise claim is much like the one at issue in Lyng.  It \ninvolves a government action — granting an easement to Dakota Access to build and operate a \npipeline — regarding the use of federal land —the land under Lake Oahe, as discussed infra — \nthat has an incidental, if serious, impact on a tribe’s ability to practice its religion because of \nspiritual desecration of a sacred site.  Just as the government’s tree cutting and road building in \nLyng did not give rise to an actionable Free Exercise claim, neither does its easement granting \nhere likely violate RFRA.      \nThat Lyng was a Free Exercise, rather than a RFRA, case does not change its \napplicability here.  RFRA was enacted in response to the Court’s decision in Employment \nDivision v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990), which rejected, in certain circumstances, the Free \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 25 of 38\nExercise test employed in cases like Sherbert and Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972).  \nThose cases “used a balancing test that took into account whether the challenged action imposed \na substantial burden on the practice of religion, and if it did, whether it was needed to serve a \ncompelling government interest.”  Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2760.  Smith held instead that \n“neutral, generally applicable laws may be applied to religious practices even when not \nsupported by a compelling governmental interest.”  Id. at 2761 (quoting City of Boerne v. Flores, \n521 U.S. 507, 514 (1997)).  In enacting RFRA, Congress restored the compelling-interest test set \nforth in pre-Smith cases.  See 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb.  \nLyng is a pre-Smith case.  When drafting and debating RFRA, Congress expressly noted \nthat RFRA did not undermine Lyng.  The Senate Committee Report on RFRA explained:  \nThe committee expects that courts will look to free exercise cases \ndecided prior to Smith for guidance in determining whether the \nexercise of religion has been substantially burdened . . . .  And, while \nthe committee expresses neither approval nor disapproval of that \ncase law, pre-Smith case law makes it clear that strict scrutiny does \nnot apply to government actions involving only management of \ninternal Government affairs or the use of the Government’s own \nproperty or resources.   \n \nS. Rep. No. 103-111 at 8-9 (1993) (emphasis added).   \nAs an example of a case falling into the latter category, the Report cited Lyng and recited \nits holding “that the construction of mining or timber roads over public lands which were sacred \nto the Native American religion did not constitute a burden on the Native Americans’ free \nexercise rights triggering the compelling interest test.”  Id. at 9 n.19.  Although RFRA “is not a \ncodification of the result reached in any prior free exercise decision,” the Committee continued, \nit is “the restoration of the legal standard that was applied in those decisions.”  Id. at 9; see also \n139 Cong. Rec. S14461, at S14470 (Statement of Sen. Orrin Hatch, Oct. 27, 1993) (RFRA “does \nnot effect [sic] Lyng . . . , a case concerning the use and management of government resources, \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 26 of 38\nbecause . . . the incidental impact on a religious practice does not ‘burden’ anyone’s free exercise \nof religion.  In Lyng, the court ruled that the way in which government manages its affairs and \nuses its own property does not impose a burden on religious exercise.”).   \n  Several circuit courts, including the D.C. Circuit, have cited Lyng approvingly when \nresolving a RFRA or RLUIPA claim.  See, e.g., Priests for Life v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Hum. \nServs., 772 F.3d 229, 246, 248 (D.C. Cir. 2014), vacated and remanded by Zubik v. Buwell, 136 \nS. Ct. 1557 (2016); Eternal World Television Network, Inc. v. Sec’y of U.S. Dep’t of Health & \nHum. Servs., 818 F.3d 1122, 1146 (11th Cir. 2016); Yellowbear v. Lampert, 741 F.3d 48, 55 \n(10th Cir. 2014); Westchester Day Sch. v. Village of Mamaroneck, 504 F.3d 338, 349-50 (2d \nCir. 2007).  One such decision is particularly applicable to this case.   \nIn Navajo Nation v. U.S. Forest Service, 535 F.3d 1058 (9th Cir. 2008) (en banc), a tribe \nchallenged the federal government’s approval of the use of artificial snow on a mountain the \ntribe considered sacred.  It asserted that the use of ersatz precipitation would “spiritually \ncontaminate the entire mountain and devalue their religious exercises.”  Id. at 1063.  Relying \nheavily on Lyng, the Ninth Circuit held that the government’s decision to permit artificial snow \ndid not impose a substantial burden under RFRA because it did not force the tribe to choose \nbetween exercising their religion and receiving a government benefit, nor did it coerce them to \nact contrary to their religion under threat of civil or criminal sanction.  Id. at 1071-73.  The “sole \neffect” was on their “subjective spiritual experience” — i.e., “the presence of the artificial snow \non the Peaks is offensive to the Plaintiffs’ feelings about their religion and will decrease the \nspiritual fulfillment Plaintiffs get from practicing their religion on the mountain.”  Id. at 1063.  \n“[U]nder Supreme Court precedent,” the court explained, “the diminishment of spiritual \nfulfillment — serious though it may be — is not a ‘substantial burden’ on the free exercise of \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 27 of 38\nreligion.”  Id. at 1070.  In so concluding, the Ninth Circuit echoed the prudential concerns \ndiscussed in Lyng:  \nWere it otherwise, any action the federal government were to take, \nincluding  action  on  its  own  land,  would  be  subject  to  the \npersonalized oversight of millions of citizens.  Each citizen would \nhold an individual veto to prohibit the government action solely \nbecause it offends his religious beliefs, sensibilities, or tastes, or \nfails to satisfy his religious desires. . . .  No matter how much we \nmight wish the government to conform its conduct to our religious \npreferences, act in ways that do not offend our religious sensibilities, \nand  take  no  action  that  decreases  our  spiritual  fulfillment,  no \ngovernment — let alone a government that presides over a nation \nwith as many religions as the United States of America — could \nfunction were it required to do so.   \n \nId. at 1063-64 (citing Lyng, 485 U.S. at 452); see also Snoqualmie Indian Tribe v. Fed. Energy \nRegulatory Comm’n, 545 F.3d 1207, 1214-15 (9th Cir. 2008) (rejecting tribe’s argument that \nFERC’s decision to relicense hydroelectric dam at sacred site imposed substantial burden on \nreligious exercise). \n  Just as the Ninth Circuit and other courts must follow Lyng until the Supreme Court \ninstructs otherwise, this Court must do the same. \nb.  Cheyenne River’s Rebuttal \n  Cheyenne River offers several arguments as to why Lyng and Navajo Nation do not \napply to the present case or are no longer good law.  First, the Tribe attempts to distinguish those \ncases by arguing that the facts here are distinct and that its members are more analogous to \nprisoners than the plaintiffs in Lyng and its Ninth Circuit progeny are.  Second, Plaintiff \ncontends that recent Supreme Court decisions — Hobby Lobby and Holt — lessen Lyng’s force.  \nThird, the Tribe asserts that its property interest in Lake Oahe dictates a different outcome from \nLyng.  None of these arguments is persuasive. \n \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 28 of 38\ni.  Factual Differences \n  The Tribe first posits that this case is factually distinct from Navajo Nation and its \nprogeny because “although a kind of spiritual contamination was alleged, the [federal] \nregulations at issue did not foreclose religious adherents’ ability to practice any part of their \nreligion.”  Mot. at 33.  Instead, “plaintiffs were left other options to practice the rites at issue.”  \nId.  The daylight between those cases and this one, in fact, is more limited than Cheyenne River \nsuggests.  In Navajo Nation, the Ninth Circuit concluded that Lyng would have compelled it to \nreach the same result even if it had assumed that the use of artificial snow would “virtually \ndestroy the . . . Indians’ ability to practice their religion.”  535 F.3d at 1072 (quoting Lyng, 485 \nU.S. at 451).   \n  Relatedly, the Tribe also asserts that “unlike the plaintiffs in Navajo Nation, Snoqualmie, \nand Lyng, the resource that the Corps’ action is proposed to burden is the only one available to \nthe Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe to practice its religion as the United States has systematically \ndeprived the Tribe of access to other water sources as a function of its more than 200-yearlong \ncampaign to dispossess the Lakota people of their aboriginal lands and resources.”  Mot. at 34.  \nConsequently, Cheyenne River argues, “the Tribe and its members here are more closely \nanalogous to the prisoners whose only options in the exercise of their religion are closely \ncontrolled by the government.”  Id.   \nThe Court readily recognizes the sordid chronicle of the United States’ dispossessing the \nLakota people of swaths of land, see, e.g., United States v. Sioux Nation, 448 U.S. 371 (1980); \nCobell v. Norton, 240 F.3d 1081, 1086 (D.C. Cir. 2001), and takes seriously that the Tribe feels \nsuch deep oppression as to warrant analogy to the prisoner cases.  Yet Lyng expressly cautions \nthat “measuring the effects of a governmental action on a religious objector’s spiritual \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 29 of 38\ndevelopment” is not the proper inquiry when the challenged action is the federal government’s \nmanagement of its own land.  See 485 U.S. at 451.   \nThe RLUIPA cases on which the Tribe relies, furthermore, offer little succor.  Not only \nhave inmates suffered a total loss of liberty, whereas the Tribe’s members have not, but the cases \ncited involved either a specific prohibition on a particular form of religious exercise or the \nimposition of a sanction or other collateral, non-religious harm in response to religious exercise.  \nSee, e.g., Native Am. Council of Tribes v. Weber, 750 F.3d 742 (8th Cir. 2014) (total ban on \ntobacco use in prisons, including during Native American religious ceremonies, violated \nRLUIPA); Yellowbear, 741 F.3d at 55-56 (prison’s refusal to permit inmate housed in special \nprotective unit access to sweat lodge in general prison yard imposed substantial burden); Haight \nv. Thompson, 763 F.3d 554, 564-65 (6th Cir. 2014) (prison’s decision to totally bar certain \ntraditional foods at powwow imposed substantial burden); Holt, 135 S. Ct. at 862 (grooming \npolicy prohibiting beards imposed substantial burden on Muslim inmate because he “face[d] \nserious disciplinary action” for contravening policy); Williams v. Wilkinson, 645 Fed. Appx. \n692, 702 (10th Cir. 2016) (“[T]he failure to provide Mr. Williams with a kosher diet will either \nprevent him from exercising his sincerely held religious belief or force him to make the \nHobson’s choice of eating a diet contrary to his beliefs or not eating at all.”); Love v. Reed, 216 \nF.3d 682, 689-90 (8th Cir. 2000) (A choice “between fasting and compromising his religious \nconvictions[] is really no choice at all.”).   \nHere, although the Tribe’s members may feel unable to use the water from Lake Oahe in \ntheir religious ceremonies once the pipeline is operational, there is no specific ban on their \nreligious exercise, nor does performance of their sacraments trigger a sanction, loss of a \ngovernment benefit, or other collateral harm.  If a Jewish prisoner is denied kosher meals and \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 30 of 38\nadheres to his belief that he cannot consume non-kosher food, he will starve.  If a Muslim \nprisoner forbidden from growing a beard nonetheless grows one, he will be punished.  But if the \nTribe persists in its belief that DAPL will render the waters of Lake Oahe spiritually impure, it \nsuffers no collateral consequence.  In so stating, the Court does not diminish the significance of \nsuch a loss; indeed, inability to engage in religious conduct may cause deep personal and \ncommunal harm.  The point is simply that the prisoner cases to which Cheyenne River draws a \ncomparison involve an additional harm beyond the spiritual that is not present here. \nii.  Recent Supreme Court Decisions \nThe Tribe next contends that Lyng and its Ninth Circuit progeny “are no longer good \nlaw” because of Hobby Lobby and Holt.  See Mot. at 34; TRO Tr. 18:10-22.  It offers two \nrelated arguments on this point.  First, on the Tribe’s reading of the cases, Navajo Nation held \nthat the government’s approval of the artificial snow could not constitute a substantial burden \nbecause its only effect was “on the Plaintiffs’ subjective, emotional religious experience,” Mot. \nat 35 (quoting Navajo Nation, 535 F.3d at 1070), but Hobby Lobby “rejected the premise that \ncourts can determine the existence of a substantial burden under RFRA based upon whether it is \nreasonable in light of the government regulation.”  Id.  Those holdings, however, are not in \ntension.  The Ninth Circuit’s conclusion that there was no substantial burden was not based on \nthe notion that the plaintiffs’ view that the artificial snow would desecrate the affected peaks was \nunreasonable; it was based on the lack of coercion in the face of a threatened sanction or a \ngovernment benefit conditioned on religious adherence or forbearance.  See 535 F.3d at 1063.  \nThe harm asserted by the affected tribes there lacked an essential element the appellate court \ndeemed necessary to conclude that a substantial burden was present.  Lyng, likewise, never \nconcluded that the affected tribe’s belief that constructing a road and harvesting timber in a \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 31 of 38\nparticular area would desecrate the site was unreasonable.  It held that the government’s actions \ndid not constitute a substantial burden on the free exercise of such belief.  \nHobby Lobby is not to the contrary.  There, the Supreme Court concluded that the \ngovernment mandate imposed a substantial burden because the owners of closely held \ncorporations had to choose between providing insurance coverage to their employees for \ncontraceptive methods that they believed to be abortifacients and incurring significant economic \nsanctions.  See 134 S. Ct. at 2775-76.  True, the Court accepted the owners’ assertions that the \ncovered contraceptive methods were “connected to the destruction of an embryo in a way that is \nsufficient to make it immoral for them to provide the coverage,” id. at 2778, but the ultimate \nconclusion that the mandate imposed a substantial burden rested on the fact that the owners had \nto choose between violating their beliefs and paying financial penalties.  The same was so in \nHolt.  See 135 S. Ct. at 862 (“Because the grooming policy puts petitioner to this choice” \nbetween growing a beard and “serious disciplinary action,” the policy “substantially burdens his \nreligious exercise.”).  Again, the Tribe here faces no such coercion or sanction.  \nSecond, Cheyenne River argues that this Court is not bound by Lyng because, as \nexplained by the Supreme Court in Hobby Lobby and Holt, Congress did not intend to limit the \nanalysis in RFRA cases to that undertaken in pre-Smith Free Exercise cases, of which Lyng was \none.  See Reply at 11-13.  Hobby Lobby and Holt do provide that RFRA’s religious-exercise \nprotections are separate from and broader than the protections provided under First Amendment \ncase law, but only in certain respects, none of which is helpful to the Tribe. \nIn Hobby Lobby, the Court discussed Congress’s intent to “effect a complete separation \nfrom First Amendment case law” with regard to the definition of “exercise of religion.”  134 S. \nCt. at 2762; see also id. at 2772-73.  After the Supreme Court held in City of Boerne v. Flores, \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 32 of 38\n521 U.S. 507 (1997), that Congress lacked the power to apply RFRA to the States and its \nsubdivisions, the legislature passed RLUIPA, which “imposes the same general test as RFRA but \non a more limited category of governmental actions.”  Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2761.  Prior to \nRLUIPA’s enactment, RFRA defined “exercise of religion” as “the exercise of religion under the \nFirst Amendment.”  Id. (citing 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-2(4) (1994 ed.)).  In RLUIPA, “Congress \ndeleted the reference to the First Amendment and defined the ‘exercise of religion’ to include \n‘any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious \nbelief.’”  Id. at 2762 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-5(7)(A)).  It then amended RFRA to include \nthe same definition.  Id. at 2761 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-2(4)).   \nThe problem for Cheyenne River is that Hobby Lobby’s rejection of the premise that \n“RFRA did no more than codify th[e Supreme] Court’s pre-Smith Free Exercise Clause \nprecedents” as they related to the concept of the “exercise of religion” makes no difference in \nthis case.  Id. at 2772.  No one disputes that the Corps’ grant of the easement to Dakota Access \nimplicates the Tribe’s religious exercise.  The debate is instead about whether the action imposes \na substantial burden on that exercise.  Hobby Lobby nowhere suggested that the Supreme \nCourt’s reasoning or conclusion in Lyng that the parties there did not prove substantial burden is \nno longer good law.    \nIn Holt, the Supreme Court rejected the district court’s conclusion that the Department of \nCorrections’ ban on beards did not substantially burden a Muslim inmate’s religious exercise \nbecause “he had been provided a prayer rug and a list of distributors of Islamic material, . . . was \nallowed to correspond with a religious advisor, and was allowed to maintain the required diet and \nobserve religious holidays.”  135 S. Ct. at 862.  It explained that the district court had \n“improperly imported a strand of reasoning from cases involving prisoners’ First Amendment \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 33 of 38\nrights,” under which “the availability of alternative means of practice religion is a relevant \nconsideration.”  Id. (citing O’Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U.S. 342, 351-52 (1987); Turner v. \nSafley, 482 U.S. 78, 90 (1987)).  RLUIPA, Holt said, “provides greater protection.”  Id.  Its \n“‘substantial burden’ inquiry asks whether the government has substantially burdened religious \nexercise . . . , not whether the RLUIPA claimant is able to engage in other forms of religious \nexercise.”  Id. \nAgain, this break with certain pre-Smith cases simply does not matter here.  Lyng’s \nsubstantial-burden inquiry did not turn on whether the affected tribal members were able to \nengage in other forms of religious exercise.  As previously noted, the Supreme Court would have \nreached the same result in Lyng — no substantial burden — had the construction of the road \ntotally destroyed the affected tribe’s ability to practice its religion.  See Lyng, 485 U.S. at 451.  \nLikewise, this Court’s decision that Cheyenne River is unlikely to satisfy the substantial-burden \ninquiry is wholly unrelated to whether the Tribe’s members are able to exercise their religion in \nother ways besides using water from Lake Oahe in Lakota ceremonies.  Holt’s caution that \nRLUIPA’s substantial-burden inquiry is broader in one specific way than the inquiry undertaken \nin certain pre-Smith cases does not impliedly overrule Lyng or otherwise undermine its \nrelevance here.  \niii.  Tribe’s Property Interest \n  Cheyenne River last argues that this case diverges from Lyng and its Ninth Circuit \nprogeny because whereas those cases “concerned sacred sites located on lands owned solely by \nthe federal government and in which . . . none of the plaintiffs could claim any cognizable \nproperty interest,” here, “the Tribe and its members enjoy an actual legal ownership interest in \nthe waters of Lake Oahe.”  Mot. at 33-34; see also TRO Tr. at 15:4-5, 16:24-25.  The Court \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 34 of 38\ncannot agree.  As the pipeline runs through the land under the lake, rather than the lake’s waters, \nthe Court first discusses ownership of the land and then turns to the Tribe’s interest in the water.  \nIn 1944, Congress passed the Flood Control Act, which “authorized the establishment of \na comprehensive flood control plan along the Missouri River.”  South Dakota v. Bourland, 508 \nU.S. 679, 683 (1993).  “Seven subsequent Acts of Congress authorized limited takings of Indian \nlands for hydroelectric and flood control dams on the Missouri River in both North and South \nDakota.”  Id.  One of these takings “involved the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project, for which \nCongress required the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe to relinquish 104,420 acres of its trust lands, \nincluding roughly 2,000 acres of land underlying the Missouri River.”  Id.  In exchange, the \nTribe received more than $10 million.  Id. at 683 n.2.  An additional $290 million in \ncompensation was appropriated in 2000.  See Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable \nCompensation Act, P.L. No. 106-511, § 104(b)(1), 114 Stat. 2365 (2000).   \n  The agreement between the Tribe and the United States to convey the land needed for the \nOahe Dam, which created Lake Oahe, was memorialized in the Cheyenne River Oahe Act, Pub. \nL. No. 81-776, 68 Stat. 1191 (1954).  That Act states that payment for the lands at issue was “in \nsettlement of all claims, rights, and demands of said Tribe or allottees or heirs thereof arising out \nof the construction of the Oahe project.”  Id.  Section 10 addresses the Tribe’s continued use of \nthe land and provides that it “shall have the right, without cost, to graze stock on the land \nbetween the water level of the reservoir and the exterior boundary of the taking area” and that the \nTribe and its members “shall have, without cost, the right of free access to the shoreline of the \nreservoir including the right to hunt and fish in and on the aforesaid shoreline and reservoir, \nsubject, however, to regulations governing the corresponding use by other citizens of the United \nStates.”  68 Stat. at 1193.   \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 35 of 38\nThe Supreme Court has since explained that, through the Flood Control and Cheyenne \nRiver Acts, Congress “clearly abrogated the Tribe’s ‘absolute and undisturbed use and \noccupation’ of these tribal lands.”  Bourland, 508 U.S. at 697 (quoting 15 Stat. 636).  “Thus, \nwhen the United States acquired reservation land to construct the [dam], the [Tribe] necessarily \nlost their treaty rights to exclusively own, occupy and utilize that land.”  Lower Brule Sioux \nTribe v. State of South Dakota, 711 F.2d 809, 823 (8th Cir. 1983) (discussing whether the Fort \nRandall and Big Bend Acts — statutes similar to the Cheyenne River Act that authorized takings \nof Indian land for dams on the Missouri River — disestablished reservation boundaries or \nabrogated treaty rights to hunt and fish).  Consequently, Cheyenne River cannot distinguish Lyng \non the ground that, here, the Tribe has an ownership interest in the land under Lake Oahe.  To the \nextent that Plaintiff has rights of access and use to the land, Lyng directly spoke to such a \nsituation: “Whatever rights the Indians may have to the use of the area,” the Court stated, “those \nrights do not divest the Government of its right to use what is, after all, its land.”  485 U.S. at \n453.  \nThe water rights reserved to Indians pursuant to Winters v. United States, 207 U.S. 564 \n(1908), do not change the Court’s conclusion.  In Winters, water shortages near the Fort Belknap \nReservation prompted a lawsuit to enforce tribal water rights against non-Indians who had been \ndiverting water from the region.  Id. at 565-67.  The Supreme Court held that the United States \nhad the power to reserve water and prevent its diversion from the reservation by private parties.  \nId. at 577.  In so doing, it made clear that “when the Federal Government withdraws its land \nfrom the public domain and reserves it for a federal purpose,” such as the creation of a \nreservation for an Indian tribe, “the Government, by implication, reserves appurtenant water then \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 36 of 38\nunappropriated to the extent needed to accomplish the purpose of the reservation.”  Cappaert v. \nUnited States, 426 U.S. 128, 138 (1976).   \nCheyenne River asserts that the purpose of its Reservation, as set out in the 1851 and \n1868 Fort Laramie Treaties and the Act of March 2, 1889, is “to provide for self-sufficiency.”  \nMot. at 14.  The Tribe, however, does not persuasively support the proposition that this purpose \nrequires the federal government to refrain from permitting infrastructure projects on its own land \nwhen doing otherwise would render water reserved for the reservation’s use spiritually impure.  \nIn an effort to so argue, the Tribe quotes the Supreme Court’s observation in Arizona v. \nCalifornia, 373 U.S. 546 (1963), that it was “impossible to believe” that when the federal \ngovernment created reservations, it was “unaware . . . that water from the river would be \nessential to the life of the Indian people.”  Reply at 8-9 (quoting Arizona, 373 U.S. at 599).  The \nTribe then contends that, “[i]n America, . . . there is no question that our laws . . . enshrine \nreligion and religious exercise as essential to the life of the people.”  Reply at 9 (citing Cantwell \nv. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 303-04 (1940)).   \nThe Court declines to embrace so broad a statement about the scope of Winters.  When \nthe Supreme Court spoke in Arizona of water sustaining life, it meant physical survival, not \nspiritual satisfaction.  The Tribe’s Reply quoted selectively from the case, but the full sentence \nreads: \nIt is impossible to believe that when Congress created the great \nColorado  River  Indian  Reservation  and  when  the  Executive \nDepartment of this Nation created the other reservations they were \nunaware that most of the lands were of the desert kind — hot, \nscorching sands — and that water from the river would be essential \nto the life of the Indian people and to the animals they hunted and \nthe crops they raised.   \n \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 37 of 38\n373 U.S. at 598-99.  The opinion then goes on to discuss the importance of an adequate water \nsupply for irrigation and agricultural production.  Id. at 599-600.  It does not mention religion, \nspirituality, ceremonies, or the like.     \nThe other cases cited by the Tribe likewise hold only that the reserved water rights \nrecognized in Winters extend to “the right to clean, safe water” and the “right to hunt, fish, and \ngather.”  Mot. at 15 (citing Bourland, 508 U.S. at 697; United States v. Dion, 476 U.S. 734, 738 \n(1986); United States v. Winans, 198 U.S. 371, 381 (1905); United States v. Adair, 723 F.2d \n1394, 1409, 1411 (9th Cir. 1983); United States v. Gila River Irrigation Dist., 920 F. Supp. 1444, \n1448 (D. Ariz. 1996)).  Absent any colorable argument that the reserved water rights here extend \nto the right to access religiously pure water, the Court cannot conclude that Winters somehow \npermits the Tribe to circumvent Lyng. \nIn explaining its view on this issue, the Court notes that it is not deciding the Corps’ \nobligations under the Fort Laramie Treaties regarding oil-spill prevention or the Tribes’ rights to \nhunt, fish, or gather on Reservation lands.  Indeed, Cheyenne River has clearly stated that its \n“RFRA claim does not rely on the Corps’ trust duties to the tribe.”  Reply at 9.  Those trust \nissues are among the subjects raised in Standing Rock’s and Cheyenne River’s summary-\njudgment motions, see ECF Nos. 117, 131, and the Court anticipates addressing them in that \ncontext. \n* * * \nFor these reasons, the Court holds that Lyng likely prevents the Tribe from showing that \nthe Corps’ decision to grant an easement to Dakota Access to operate an oil pipeline under Lake \nOahe constitutes a substantial burden on its members’ free exercise of religion.  The Tribe, \naccordingly, is unlikely to succeed on the merits of its RFRA claim.    \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 158   Filed 03/07/17   Page 38 of 38\nIV.

Plaintiff Oglala Sioux Tribe (Tribe), a federally recognized tribe, for its causes of \naction against the Defendant named above, alleges as follows: \nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY \n  2.  This is a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief to stop the construction \nand operation of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) until the Defendant United States Army \nCorps of Engineers (Corps) completes an environmental impact statement (EIS) that fully \nanalyzes the impacts of the DAPL to the Tribe’s Treaty rights and rights in the Mni Wiconi \nProject as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Mineral Leasing \nAct (MLA).  \n3.  DAPL is a crude oil pipeline that will carry up to 570,000 barrels per day.  DAPL \nwould cross the Missouri River at Lake Oahe, north (upriver) of the Tribe’s water intake that is \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00267-JEB   Document 1   Filed 02/11/17   Page 2 of 34\n \n \n \npart of the Mni Wiconi Project.  The Mni Wiconi Project provides safe drinking water to the \nTribe’s Pine Ridge Reservation as well as to the Rosebud Sioux Tribe, the Lower Brule Sioux \nTribe, and the non-Indian West River/Lyman Jones Water District in South Dakota.  The Mni \nWiconi Project has a service area of about 12,500 square miles and provides a reliable source of \npotable water to a population of approximately 52,000 people, many of whom live on some of \nthe poorest Indian reservations in the United States.  The Oglala Sioux Rural Water Supply \nSystem, a component of the Project, is held in trust for the Tribe by the United States.  \n  4.  On July 25, 2016, the Corps issued some of the federal authorizations needed for \nthe DAPL to cross Lake Oahe.  Accompanying these authorizations, the Corps released a Final \nEnvironmental Assessment (EA) and finding of no significant impact (FONSI) that wrongly \nconcluded that the Lake Oahe crossing did not have sufficient environmental impact to warrant \npreparation of an EIS.  The EA/FONSI was deficient in many respects, including that it entirely \nfailed to consider impacts to the Tribe’s Treaty- and statute-protected rights in the Missouri \nRiver and in the Mni Wiconi Project and failed to provide a reasoned analysis of spill risks or \ndamage in the event of a spill. \n  5.  The Tribe and other tribes along the Missouri River filed objections to the \nEA/FONSI and urged the Corps to conduct a full analysis of their statutory and Treaty rights in \nthe Missouri River, which had not been done to date. In December 2016, the Assistant Secretary \nfor the Army for Civil Works announced that the Army would conduct an EIS before granting \nDAPL’s owner the easement to cross Lake Oahe, and on January 18, 2017, the Army issued a \nNotice of Intent (NOI) to prepare the EIS.  Days after taking office, however, on January 24, \n2017, President Donald Trump ordered the Secretary of the Army to instruct the Assistant \nSecretary of the Army for Civil Works and the Corps to consider rescinding the NOI and to \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00267-JEB   Document 1   Filed 02/11/17   Page 3 of 34\n \n \n \nconsider prior reviews, including the EA/FONSI, as fulfilling federal law.  The Department of \nthe Army forwarded to the Office of the Federal Register a notice rescinding the NOI on \nFebruary 7, 2017—almost two weeks prior to the deadline for public comment on the NOI—and \nthe Corps granted DAPL the easement on February 8, 2017.    \n6.  The Tribe seeks a declaration that the EA/FONSI are inadequate and that the \nCorps must complete an EIS that analyzes impacts to the Tribe’s Treaty rights and its rights in \nthe Mni Wiconi Project as required by NEPA and the Mineral Leasing Act (MLA).  The Tribe \nalso seeks a declaration that the Corps has breached its trust responsibility to the Tribe by failing \nto assess impacts to the Tribe’s Treaty water rights and the Mni Wiconi Project.  The Tribe \nrequests that the Court vacate the easement the Corps issued on February 8, 2017, and enjoin the \nCorps from issuing any further easements or other authorizations for the DAPL until an EIS is \nconducted that assesses impacts to the Tribe’s rights. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n  7.

Jurisdiction also arises under 28 U.S.C. § 1362, which provides that “district \ncourts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions, brought by any Indian Tribe or band \nwith a governing body duly recognized by the Secretary of the Interior, wherein the matter in \ncontroversy arises under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States”; § 2201, which \nprovides for declaratory relief; and § 2202, which provides for “[f]urther necessary or proper \nrelief based on a declaratory judgment.”   \n  8.  Venue in the District of Columbia is appropriate under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) \nbecause this is an action in which the Defendant is an agency of the United States and a \nsubstantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred within this judicial \ndistrict. \nPARTIES \n  9.  Plaintiff Oglala Sioux Tribe is an Indian Nation that is part of the Oceti Sakowin \n(the Seven Council Fires), which is also known as the Great Sioux Nation.  The Tribe is federally \nrecognized and maintains a government-to-government relationship with the United States of \nAmerica. \n  10.  The Tribe is a party to the 1851 Fort Laramie Treaty, 11 Stat. 749, and the 1868 \nSioux Nation Treaty, 15 Stat. 635.  The DAPL would run through lands that are the Tribe’s \naboriginal territory as well as its ancestral Treaty lands.  The Tribe, along with its sister Sioux \nTribes, has rights to the water in the Missouri River based on the 1851 and 1868 Treaties.   \n11.  The current boundaries of the Tribe’s territory, known as the Pine Ridge Indian \nReservation, were created by the Act of March 2, 1889, 25 Stat. 888.  The Tribe’s Reservation is \ndownstream from Lake Oahe, where the DAPL threatens to cross the Missouri River.  The Tribe \noperates the Oglala Sioux Rural Water Supply System, a part of the Mni Wiconi Project, which \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00267-JEB   Document 1   Filed 02/11/17   Page 5 of 34\n \n \n \ndraws water from the Missouri River and provides drinking water to the Pine Ridge Indian \nReservation as well as to the Rosebud Sioux Reservation, Lower Brule Sioux Reservation, and \nthe non-Indian West River/Lyman Jones Water District. \n  12.  Defendant U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is an agency in the Executive Branch of \nthe Federal government and a division of the Department of the Army.  It is charged with \nregulating any dredging and filling of the waters of the United States under § 404 of the Clean \nWater Act and § 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act.  It also has the authority to issue rights-of-\nway or easements for pipeline purposes for the transportation of oil through federal land over \nwhich it has jurisdiction under the Mineral Leasing Act.  30 U.S.C. § 185.  \nRELEVANT LAW \nI.  THE 1851 FORT LARAMIE TREATY AND 1868 SIOUX NATION TREATY \n \n13.  The Oceti Sakowin (The Seven Council Fires or Great Sioux Nation) is composed \nof seven divisions of Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota speaking peoples.  The Oglala (Scatters His \nOwn) are one of the Lakota bands.   \n  14.  In 1851, the United States signed the Treaty of Fort Laramie with several \ndivisions of the Oceti Sakowin, including the Oglala.  Treaty of Fort Laramie, 11. Stat. 749 (Sep. \n17, 1851).  The 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie was a peacetime Treaty.  The United States sought \nthe Treaty to facilitate westward migration, ensuring passage from the Missouri basin to the \nWest Coast.  In consideration for agreeing to allow the United States to build roads and outposts \nwithin Indian lands, the United States agreed to “bind themselves to protect the aforesaid Indian \nnations against the commission of all depredations by the people of the said United States.”  Id. \nat arts. 2–3.  The Treaty recognized 60 million acres as the territory of the Great Sioux Nation, \n“commencing  the mouth of the White Earth River, on the Missouri River; thence in a \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00267-JEB   Document 1   Filed 02/11/17   Page 6 of 34\n \n \n \nsouthwesterly direction to the forks of the Platte River; thence up the north fork of the Platte \nRiver to a point known as the Red Bute, or where the road leaves the river; thence along the \nrange of mountains known as the Black Hills, to the head-waters of Heart River; thence down \nHeart River to its mouth; and thence down the Missouri River to the place of beginning.”  Id. at \nart. 5.  The Tribe and its members retained the right to access clean water in the several bodies of \nwater within this territory reserved for their use, including the Missouri River and its tributaries.   \n  15.  After the United States violated the 1851 Treaty by allowing incursions by non-\nIndians settlers on Great Sioux Nation land, war broke out between the United States and the \nGreat Sioux Nation.  The United States sought to end this war by signing the 1868 Sioux Nation \nTreaty with several bands of the Great Sioux Nation, including the Oglala.  Within the \npreviously recognized 60 million acre Treaty territory, the 1868 Treaty further demarcated a 26 \nmillion acre reservation “for the absolute and undisturbed use and occupation” of the signatory \ntribes.  Sioux Nation Treaty, 15 Stat. 6435, art. 2 (Apr. 29, 1868).  That reservation was called \nthe Great Sioux Reservation and included all of present day South Dakota west of the low water \nmark of the east bank of the Missouri River and adjacent lands in North Dakota.  Id.  The 1868 \nTreaty affirmed a permanent homeland for the Great Sioux Nation, reserving to the Nation, \nwithout limitation, rights to water, natural resources, self-government, and all other rights \nnecessary to make the Great Sioux Reservation a livable homeland, which the United States \npledged to protect. \nII.  THE ACT OF MARCH 2, 1889 \n \n16.  After failing to uphold the terms of the 1868 Sioux Nation Treaty, the United \nStates divided the lands of the Oceti Sakowin into separate reservations, creating the Pine Ridge \nReservation for the Oglala Sioux Tribe.  The Act of March 2, 1889 provided that the specified \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00267-JEB   Document 1   Filed 02/11/17   Page 7 of 34\n \n \n \n“tract of land, being a part of the Great Reservation of the Sioux Nation, in the Territory of \nDakota, is hereby set apart for a permanent reservation for the Indians receiving rations and \nannuities at the Pine Ridge Agency, in the Territory of Dakota.”  25 Stat. 888 § 1 (Mar. 2, 1889).   \n17.  The creation of the Pine Ridge Reservation reserved, without limitation, rights to \nwater, natural resources, self-government, and all other rights necessary to make the reservation \na livable homeland.  This reservation of territory included a reservation of water rights in the \nMissouri River.  As the Supreme Court articulated in Winters v. United States, the creation of an \nIndian reservation impliedly reserves water rights to the tribe or tribes occupying the territory; \nthose water rights are reserved to carry out the purposes for which the lands were set aside; and \nthose rights are paramount to water rights later perfected under state law.  207 U.S. 564, 576–77 \n(1908).  The Tribe enjoys reserved water rights to the waters in the Missouri River and its \ntributaries, including sufficient water to fulfill the purpose of the reservation to provide for a \npermanent livable homeland.   The Tribe’s reserved waters rights “are vested property rights for \nwhich the United States has a trust responsibility, with the United States holding legal title to \nsuch water in trust for the benefit of the Indians.”  Notice, Department of the Interior, Working \nGroup in Indian Water Settlements, Criteria and Procedures for the Participation of the Federal \nGovernment in Negotiations for the Settlement of Indian Water Rights Claims, 55 Fed. Reg. \n9223, 9223 (Mar. 12, 1990).  \nIII.  THE MNI WICONI PROJECT ACT  \n \n18.  In 1988 the United States created the Mni Wiconi Project to provide safe drinking \nwater to the Pine Ridge Reservation and other Indian reservations, as well as to some rural \ncounties in South Dakota.  Mni Wiconi Project Act.  In the Mni Wiconi Project Act, Congress \nissued the following findings:  \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00267-JEB   Document 1   Filed 02/11/17   Page 8 of 34\n \n \n \n(1) there are insufficient water supplies available to residents of the Pine Ridge \nIndian Reservation in South Dakota, and the water supplies that are available \ndo not meet minimum health and safety standards, thereby posing a threat to \npublic health and safety;  \n \n(2) Shannon County, South Dakota, one of the counties where the Pine Ridge \nIndian Reservation, Rosebud Indian Reservation, and Lower Brule Indian \nReservation is located, is the poorest county in the United States, and the lack \nof water supplies on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation restricts efforts to \npromote economic development on the reservation; \n \n(3) the lack of water supplies on the Rosebud Reservation and Lower Brule \nReservation restrict efforts to promote economic development on those \nreservations; \n \n(4) serious problems in water quantity and water quality exist in the rural counties \nof Haakon, Jackson, Jones, Lyman, Mellette, Pennington, and Stanley \nCounties, South Dakota; \n \n(5) the United States has a trust responsibility to ensure that adequate and safe \nwater supplies are available to meet the economic, environmental, water \nsupply, and public health needs of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, \nRosebud Indian Reservation, and Lower Brule Indian Reservation; and  \n \n(6) the best available, reliable, and safe rural and municipal water supply to serve \nthe needs of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, Rosebud Indian Reservation, \nand Lower Brule Indian Reservation and the residents of Haakon, Jackson, \nJones, Lyman, Mellette, Pennington, and Stanley Counties is the Missouri \nRiver. \n \nId. § 2(a) \n  19.  Among the purposes of the Act are to “ensure a safe and adequate municipal, \nrural, and industrial water supply for the residents of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, Rosebud \nIndian Reservation and Lower Brule Indian Reservation in South Dakota,” and to “provide \ncertain benefits to fish, wildlife, and the natural environment of South Dakota, including the Pine \nRidge Indian Reservation, Rosebud Indian Reservation, and Lower Brule Indian Reservation.”  \nId. §§ 2(b)(1), (4).   \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00267-JEB   Document 1   Filed 02/11/17   Page 9 of 34\n \n \n \n  20.  The Act directed the Secretary of the Interior to “plan, design, construct, operate, \nmaintain, and replace a municipal, rural, and industrial water system, to be known as the Oglala \nSioux Rural Water Supply System.”  Id. § 3(a).  The system was authorized to include, among \nother things, pumping and treatment facilities located along the Missouri River, pipelines \nextending from the Missouri River to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, distribution and \ntreatment facilities to serve the needs of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, and such facilities as \nthe Secretary of the Interior deems necessary or appropriate to meet the water supply, economic, \npublic health, and environmental needs of the reservation.  Id. § 3(a).  The construction and \noperation of this water supply system is carried out by the Tribe pursuant to self-determination \ncooperative agreements with the Secretary of the Interior as authorized by the Act.  Id. § 3(h). \nThis water supply system was placed in trust, with the Secretary of the Interior maintaining \nmanagement and control over the trust corpus.  The Act provides that the “[t]itle to the Oglala \nSioux Rural Water Supply System shall be held in trust for the Oglala Sioux Tribe by the United \nStates and shall not be transferred or encumbered without a subsequent Act of Congress.”  Id. § \n3(e).   \nIV.  THE FEDERAL TRUST RESPONSIBILTY \n \n21.  The general federal trust responsibility originates from the United States \nConstitution, Treaties, and the unique government-to-government relationship between tribes \nand the United States.  The Supreme Court has acknowledged “the undisputed existence of a \ngeneral trust relationship between the United States and the Indian people” that informs its \ninterpretation of more specific statutes.  United States v. Mitchell, 463 U.S. 206, 225 (1983).   \n22.  Additionally, where legislation and regulations give “the Federal Government full \nresponsibility to manage Indian resources … for the benefit of the Indians[, t]hey thereby \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00267-JEB   Document 1   Filed 02/11/17   Page 10 of 34\n \n \n \nestablish a fiduciary relationship and define the contours of the United States’ fiduciary \nresponsibilities.”  Id. at 224.  “Moreover, a fiduciary relationship necessarily arises when the \nGovernment assumes such elaborate control over … property belonging to Indians.” Id. at 225. \n23.   Under the federal trust responsibility, the United States has a duty to conserve \nIndian lands, waters, and natural resources and to appropriately manage tribal natural resources.  \nIt is also the policy of the United States “that all Indian communities … be provided with safe \nand adequate water supply systems…” 25 U.S.C. § 1632(a)(5).   \n24.  The federal trust responsibility stretches across all components of the United \nStates government.  The Corps has a trust responsibility to manage and protect trust property on \nbehalf of the Tribe based generally in the Treaties and statutes governing the Tribe and its \nReservation and the general trust doctrine.  The Corps has recognized the federal trust \nresponsibility to tribes in the operation of the Mainstem Reservoir System, of which Lake Oahe \nis a part, and in its Tribal Consultation Policy.  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Tribal \nConsultation Policy (Nov. 1, 2012) (stating in Section 5(b): “The Trust responsibility will be \nhonored and fulfilled.”).  The Department of Defense, of which the Army and Corps are a part, \nhas also recognized the federal trust responsibility.  Department of Defense, “DoD Interactions \nwith Federally-Recognized Tribes,” Instruction No. 4710.02 (Sept. 14, 2006) (stating in Section \n4.1 that it is the Department’s policy “to [m]eet its responsibilities to tribes as derived from the \nFederal trust doctrine, treaties, and agreements between the United States and tribal \ngovernments….”). \nV.  THE CLEAN WATER ACT \n \n25.  The Clean Water Act (CWA) regulates discharges of pollutants into waters of the \nUnited States and the quality of surface waters.  33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.  The CWA was passed \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00267-JEB   Document 1   Filed 02/11/17   Page 11 of 34\n \n \n \nto “restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation’s waters.”  \nId. § 1251(a).  The CWA prohibits discharges of pollutants, including dredged soil or other fill, \ninto waters of the United States without a permit.  Id. §§ 1311(a), 1344(a)–(f).    \n26.  Section 404(e) of the CWA allows the Secretary to issue general permits relating \nto the discharge of dredged or fill material.  Id. § 1344(e); see also 33 C.F.R. Part 330.  General \npermits may be issued on a nationwide basis for activities that are similar in nature and “will \ncause only minimal adverse environmental effects when performed separately, and will have \nonly minimal cumulative adverse effects on the environment.”  Id. § 1344(e)(1).  Prior to issuing \na permit under Section 404, the Corps is required to conduct a public interest review.  33 C.F.R. \n§ 320.4(a). \nVI.  RIVERS AND HARBORS ACT \n \n27.  Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (RHA) makes it unlawful “to \nexcavate or fill, or in any manner to alter or modify the course, location, condition, or capacity \nof” any navigable water without a permit from the Corps.  33 U.S.C. § 403.  Tunneling under \nnavigable waters requires a Section 10 permit from the Corps even when there will be no \ndischarge into navigable waters.  33 C.F.R. § 322.2(a).  A public interest review is required for \nissuing a Section 10 permit.  Id. § 320.4(a).  Section 14 of the RHA, codified at 33 U.S.C. § 408, \nand known as “Section 408,” makes it unlawful to “build upon, alter, deface, destroy, move, \ninjure, obstruct by fastening vessels thereto or otherwise, or in any manner whatever impair the \nusefulness of any sea wall, bulkhead, jetty, dike, levee, wharf, pier, or other work built by the \nUnited States” without a permit from the Corps.  Prior to issuing a Section 408 permit, the Corps \nmust determine whether the use or occupation will be injurious to the public interest or impair \nthe usefulness of the project.  33 C.F.R. § 320.4(a), (g). \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00267-JEB   Document 1   Filed 02/11/17   Page 12 of 34\n \n \n \nVII.  THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT \n \n28.  NEPA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321–4370f, is our “basic national charter for protection of \nthe environment,” 40 C.F.R. § 1500.1(a), intended to assist the Federal Government “fulfill the \nresponsibilities of each generation as trustee of the environment for succeeding generations; … \n[and] attain the widest range of beneficial uses of the environment without degradation, risk to \nhealth or safety, or other undesirable and unintended consequences.”  42 U.S.C. §§ 4331(b)(1), \n(b)(3).   \n  29.  NEPA requires that environmental protection be considered in the interpretation \nand implementation of every federal agency mandate.  42 U.S.C. § 4332.  It ensures that \n“environmental review procedures…run concurrently rather than consecutively” with other \nfederal laws and agency practice.  40 C.F.R. § 1500.2(c).   \n  30.  NEPA imposes a mandatory procedural obligation on federal agencies to take a \n“hard look” at the potential environmental impacts of major federal actions before deciding to \nproceed with a proposed plan of action.  42 U.S.C. § 4332(C).  It is intended to foster “excellent \naction” by ensuring that high quality and accurate “environmental information is available to \npublic officials and citizens before decisions are made and before actions are taken.”  40 C.F.R. § \n1500.1(b)–(c).  NEPA “guarantees that the relevant information [concerning significant \nenvironmental impacts] will be made available to the larger [public] audience that may also play \na role in both the decision-making process and the implementation of that decision.”  Robertson \nv. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 349 (1989).   \n  31.  NEPA mandates that federal agencies prepare an EIS if an agency action may \nhave a significant impact on the environment.  40 C.F.R. § 1501.4.  For the purposes of NEPA, \nan agency must consider “both context and intensity” in determining whether a proposed action \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00267-JEB   Document 1   Filed 02/11/17   Page 13 of 34\n \n \n \nmay have significant impact on the environment.  40 C.F.R. § 1508.27.  Context means that “the \nsignificance of an action must be analyzed in several contexts such as society as a whole (human, \nnational), the affected region, the affected interests, and the locality.”  Id.  Intensity refers to “the \nseverity of impact,” which is determined based on, inter alia, the “degree to which the proposed \naction affects public health or safety,” “[u]nique characteristics of the geographic area,” and the \n“degree to which the possible effects on the human environment are highly uncertain or involve \nunique or unknown risks.”  40 C.F.R. § 1508.27(b)(2), (3), (5).   \n  32.  NEPA defines the scope of “actions, alternatives, and impacts” that a federal \nagency must consider in an EIS.  40 C.F.R. § 1508.25.  The EIS must consider direct, indirect, \nand cumulative effects of the agency’s proposed action and alternatives.  40 C.F.R. § 1508.25(c).  \nNEPA defines the “effects” of an agency action as including those impacts that are \n“ecological…aesthetic, historic, cultural, economic, social, or health, whether direct, indirect, or \ncumulative.”  40 C.F.R. § 1508.8(b).   \n  33.  If an agency has doubts as to whether an action’s effects are significant, the \nagency may prepare an environmental assessment to better inform its decision-making process.  \n40 C.F.R. §§ 1501.4, 1508.9.  If an agency determines that no EIS is required after a careful \nanalysis of the available scientific and environmental information, it must explain that \nconclusion in a “finding of no significant impact” (“FONSI”).  40 C.F.R. §§ 1501, 1508.13.  \n  34.  The Council on Environmental Quality has advised that in some circumstances, \nincluding in some cases where environmental effects on tribal resources are at stake, agencies \n“should heighten agency attention to alternatives (including alternative sites), mitigation \nstrategies, monitoring needs, and preferences expressed by the affected community or \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00267-JEB   Document 1   Filed 02/11/17   Page 14 of 34\n \n \n \npopulation.”  Council on Environmental Quality, “Environmental Justice Under the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act,” at 10 (Dec. 10, 1997).  \n  35.  An EA is insufficient where an agency’s analysis is not more than a “conclusory \npresentation [that] does not offer any more than the kind of ‘general statements about possible \neffects and some risk’” which have been “held to be insufficient to constitute a ‘hard look.’”  \nKlamath-Siskiyou Wildlands Ctr. v. Bureau of Land Mgmt., 387 F.3d 989, 995 (9th Cir. 2004) \n(internal citation omitted).  An adequate EA must address the “unique characteristics” of a \nproposed agency action, including any “issue of uncertainty” as to the project’s potential impact \non the human environment and surrounding ecosystem, Native Fish Soc’y v. Nat’l Marine \nFisheries Serv., 992 F. Supp. 2d 1095, 1109 (D. Or. 2014), and potential cumulative impacts to \navoid “impermissibly subject[ing] the decision-making process contemplated by NEPA to ‘the \ntyranny of small decisions’” that may otherwise result from a restricted EA analysis.  Kern v. \nBureau of Land Mgmt., 284 F.3d 1062, 1078 (9th Cir. 2002) (quoting the Council on \nEnvironmental Quality, “Considering Cumulative Effects Under the National Environmental \nPolicy Act,” at 1 (Jan. 1997)).    \nVIII.  THE MINERAL LEASING ACT \n \n36.  Section 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act (MLA), 30 U.S.C. § 185, known as Section \n185, provides federal agencies with the authority to grant rights-of-way over federal lands for \npipeline purposes, including for oil and natural gas pipelines.  Section 185 imposes specific \nenvironmental review and public hearing requirements, without altering the applicability of \nNEPA.  30 U.S.C. § 185(h)(1)–(2).   \n37.  Under Section 185, if a right of way or permit has significant impact on the \nenvironment, an agency must require the applicant to submit a plan of construction, operation, \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00267-JEB   Document 1   Filed 02/11/17   Page 15 of 34\n \n \n \nand rehabilitation.  Id. § 185(h)(2).  Further, Section 185 requires the Secretary of the Interior or \n“agency head” to:  \nissue regulations or impose stipulations which shall include, but shall not be limited \nto: (A) requirements for restoration, revegetation, and curtailment of erosion of the \nsurface of the land; (B) requirements to insure that activities in connection with the \nright-of-way or permit will not violate applicable air and water quality standards \nnor  related  facility  siting  standards  established  by  or  pursuant  to  law;  (C) \nrequirements  designed  to  control  or  prevent  (i)  damage  to  the  environment \n(including damage to fish and wildlife habitat), (ii) damage to public or private \nproperty, and (iii) hazards to public health and safety; and (D) requirements to \nprotect the interests of individuals living in the general area of the right-of-way or \npermit who rely on the fish, wildlife, and biotic resources of the area for subsistence \npurposes. \n \nId.  The regulations are required to apply to every right-of-way or permit granted \npursuant to Section 185.  Id. \n  38.  Section 185 defines “agency head” as “the head of any Federal department \nor independent Federal office or agency … which has jurisdiction over Federal lands.  Id. \n§ 185(b)(3).   Section 185(k) requires that the Secretary or agency head by regulation \n“establish procedures, including public hearings where appropriate, to give Federal, State, \nand local government agencies and the public adequate notice and an opportunity to \ncomment upon right-of-way applications.”  Id. § 185(k).   \nIX.  ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT \n39.  The Administrative Procedure Act authorizes courts reviewing agency actions to \nhold unlawful and set aside final agency actions that are “arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law” or that are “contrary to constitutional right, \npower, privilege, or immunity.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)–(B).    \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00267-JEB   Document 1   Filed 02/11/17   Page 16 of 34\n \n \n \n40.  The APA authorizes suit by “[a] person suffering legal wrong because of agency \naction, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant \nstatute.”  Id. at § 702.   \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nI.  INTERESTS OF THE OGLALA SIOUX TRIBE \n41.  The waters of the Missouri River are sacred to the Tribe.  These waters give life \nto all of the creatures and plants on the Tribe’s lands.  The Tribe has Treaty- and statute-\nprotected property rights to the waters of the Missouri River. \n42.  The Tribe operates the Oglala Sioux Rural Water Supply System of the Mni \nWiconi Project under a self-determination cooperative agreement entered into with the Secretary \nof the Interior pursuant to Sections 3(b) and 3(h) of the Mni Wiconi Project Act.  The Mni \nWiconi Project provides clean drinking water to the Tribe’s Pine Ridge Reservation as well as to \nthe Rosebud Sioux Tribe, the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, and non-Indian West River/Lyman Jones \nWater District in South Dakota.  The Mni Wiconi Project has a service area of about 12,500 \nsquare miles and provides a reliable source of potable water to a population of approximately \n52,000 people, many of whom live on some of the poorest Indian reservations in the United \nStates.  The Bureau of Reclamation in the Department of the Interior is the funding agency for \nthe Project.  The Federal Government has invested at least $450 million in the Project to date and \nwill continue to annually fund operations and maintenance costs.   \n43.  The Project draws water from the Missouri River, downstream from the easement \ngranted for DAPL.  The Tribe is deeply concerned about the risk of a DAPL spill and the threat \nthat the 570,000 barrels per day pipeline poses to its sacred Treaty- and statute-protected waters.  \nA crude oil spill from the DAPL into Lake Oahe would damage the ecology of the river basin, \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00267-JEB   Document 1   Filed 02/11/17   Page 17 of 34\n \n \n \nimpair the Tribe’s rights, and contaminate the drinking water of the Tribe’s citizens.  The Mni \nWiconi Project does not have the capacity to treat water contaminated by petroleum products, \nand would have to shut down in the event of a spill, removing access to clean drinking water to \nthe 52,000 individuals it serves. \nII.  PERMITTING OF THE LAKE OAHE CROSSING \n44.  In February 2012, the Corps issued Nationwide Permit (NWP) 12, governing \n“utility line activities.”  77 Fed. Reg. 10184, 10271 (Feb. 21, 2012).  NWP 12 authorizes the \n“construction, maintenance, repair and removal of utility lines and associated facilities” in waters \nof the United States, and utility lines are defined to include “any pipe or pipeline for the \ntransportation of any gaseous, liquid, liquescent, or slurry substance, for any purpose.”  Id.   \n45.  Dakota Access has used NWP 12 to seek authorization of the DAPL.  The DAPL \nwould pass through the Tribe’s aboriginal, ancestral lands and would cross the Missouri River \nunder Lake Oahe, which is a dammed section of the Missouri River upstream from the Tribe’s \nReservation.  The DAPL will involve dredge and/or fill of navigable waters of the United States. \n46.  In November 2015, the Corps issued a Draft Environmental Assessment (Draft \nEA) for the DAPL.  The Draft EA did not assess impacts to the Tribe’s Treaty-protected water \nrights or to the Mni Wiconi Project.   \n47.  The Corps received comments on the Draft EA from the general public and from \nstate and federal agencies.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sent two comment \nletters to the Corps.  The first, dated January 8, 2016, stated as its main concern that the Draft EA \nlacked sufficient analysis of direct and indirect impacts of DAPL on the Lake Oahe crossing on \nwater resources.  The EPA specifically stated that the impacts from potential spills to water \nquality must be analyzed and that emergency measures to detect, limit and respond to spills must \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00267-JEB   Document 1   Filed 02/11/17   Page 18 of 34\n \n \n \nbe addressed.  Further, the EPA stated that the water resources impacts section of the EA should \nbe expanded to discuss affected water resources and potential impacts from construction and \noperation of the DAPL for the segment of the pipeline covered by the North Dakota EA. \n48.  EPA’s second comment letter on the Draft EA, dated March 11, 2016, \nrecommended that the Corps prepare a revised Draft EA and provide a second public comment \nperiod based on the potential impacts to drinking water supplies along the Missouri River.  The \nEPA specifically mentioned concern for tribes downstream of the Lake Oahe crossing with \npublic water supply intakes on the Missouri River, including the Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Mni \nWiconi Project.  The EPA stated that based on the potential impacts, “[t]he revised Draft EA \nshould disclose potential impacts to downstream water supplies from leaks and spills and include \nthe water systems in emergency preparedness training.”  The EPA also recommended that the \nCorp’s NEPA analysis provide more information regarding detection and shutoff of the DAPL in \nthe event of a spill or leak, consider alternative emergency detection systems, provide further \ninformation on its evaluation of alternate routes with reduced potential impact to water resources \nand drinking water supplies, and complete a more thorough environmental justice analysis.  The \nEPA also noted that consultation with affected tribal communities was limited to historic and \ncultural property concerns, and no tribes were listed as having been consulted as part of federal, \nstate, tribal, and local agency consultation and coordination.   \n49.  The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, whose reservation is downriver just one-half \nmile from the DAPL crossing, submitted comments on the Draft EA.  The Standing Rock Sioux \nTribe stated that the Draft EA failed to adequately address potential impacts to Lake Oahe, and it \nurged the Corps to prepare an EIS, and to engage in consultation with it and other tribes, as \nrequired by law.  \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00267-JEB   Document 1   Filed 02/11/17   Page 19 of 34\n \n \n \n50.  On March 29, 2016, the Department of the Interior (DOI) sent a letter to the \nCorps requesting that it prepare an EIS, stating that “the potential impact on trust resources in \nthis particular situation necessitates full analysis and disclosure of potential impacts through the \npreparation of the EIS.”  DOI also concurred with the March 11, 2016 comments of the EPA. \nFurther, DOI also objected that the Corps had not adequately justified its conclusion that there \nwould be no significant impacts on the surrounding environment and community.  \n51.  The Corps did not prepare an EIS.  On July 25, 2016, the Corps issued CWA and \nRHA authorizations and verifications that NWP 12 terms were met for the DAPL to cross Lake \nOahe.  Accompanying this authorization, the Corps released a Final EA and FONSI.  The FONSI \nconcluded that the Lake Oahe crossing would not significantly impact the human environment \nand that preparation of an EIS was not warranted.   \n52.  The Corps failed to consult with the Tribe on potential impacts of the project on \nthe risk of spill and potential impacts to its Treaty protected water rights or the Mni Wiconi \nProject prior to issuance of the Final EA and FONSI.  The Final EA did not assess potential \nimpacts to the Tribe’s Treaty-protected water rights or statute-protected rights in the Mni Wiconi \nProject, nor did it include the Mni Wiconi Project or the Oglala Sioux Rural Water Supply \nSystem in its emergency preparedness planning.  The EA failed to address whether any of the \nproposed mitigation measures would mitigate such impacts.  Additionally, the EA’s analysis was \ndeficient in considering many aspects of the DAPL that are of concern to the Tribe. \n53.  The EA contains a facially inconsistent and inadequate consideration of the \nproposed alternatives routes to cross the Missouri River.  The Corps initially considered crossing \nthe Missouri River north of Bismarck, but abandoned that alternative after determining it would \npose a risk to wellheads and water intakes that service the population of Bismarck, North \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00267-JEB   Document 1   Filed 02/11/17   Page 20 of 34\n \n \n \nDakota.  The EA justified abandoning that approach in part because the Bismarck route “crossed \nother populated PHMSA high consequence areas (HCAs), that are not present on the preferred \n(Lake Oahe) route.”  In Table 2-1, where the EA compares the impact of a spill from the \nBismarck alternative to the Lake Oahe alternative, the EA states there are no drinking water \nHCAs at the Lake Oahe crossing that would be impacted.  Yet elsewhere in the EA, the Corps \nnotes that a worst case consequence scenario as a result of a spill at the Lake Oahe crossing \nwould be ranked high “because several drinking water intake High Consequence Areas (HCAs) \nand multiple ecologically sensitive HCAs could be impacted.”  The EA fails to adequately state \nor consider what those consequences might be, or whether they would constitute significant \nimpacts to the environment.   \n54.  The EA fails to adequately compare the Bismarck alternative crossing with the \nLake Oahe crossing by failing to adequately assess the risk a spill would have on the Tribe’s \nTreaty- and statute-protected rights to drinking water in the Lake. \n55.  The EA dramatically underestimates the total volume of oil that would likely be \nreleased in the event of a spill.  The EA is deficient in that it concludes that the most likely spill \nvolume is 4 bbl or less.  But the data relied upon for that assumption includes spills from \npipelines of all sizes, not spills from large diameter pipelines.  The EA indicates that the pipeline \nis designed to convey 570,000 bbl of crude oil per day, which converts to a throughput of \napproximately 400 bbl per minute, or 6.6 bbl per second.  The EA fails to explain why a spill of \n4 bbl is “the most probable volume” for a spill from a pipeline with that capacity.  \n56.  The EA fails to explain why it limited its worst case discharge estimates to an \nhour long spill.  The EA fails to assess the risks of a spill longer in duration than a one-hour \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00267-JEB   Document 1   Filed 02/11/17   Page 21 of 34\n \n \n \nevent and fails to assess how long a spill could continue in the event the spill detection \ntechnology DAPL plans to use fails to work, due an electrical shortage or otherwise. \n57.  The EA fails to explain why its estimated one-hour spill event would result in \nonly 10,000 bbl of oil spilled.  With a throughput of 400 bbl per minute, a five minute spill \nwould result in a release of 2,000 bbl, an hour long spill would result in a release of 24,000 bbl, \nand a 24-hour spill would result in a release of 570,000 bbl.  The EA includes a discussion of a \nworst case discharge scenario in the facility response plan in Appendix L of the EA, but the \nrelevant portions of that plan are blacked out, and upon information and belief, those sections do \nnot adequately address risk of a discharge at the Lake Oahe crossing site or impacts to \ndownstream water users like the Tribe and the Mni Wiconi Project. \n58.  The EA fails to explain why it considered benzene to be “commonly considered \nto pose the greatest toxicity threat from crude oil spills” when a number of studies indicate that \ncrude oil itself, as well as its other constituent compounds like ethylbenzene, p-xylene and PAHs \nare generally more toxic than benzene. \n59.  The EA erroneously concludes there would be no significant impact by \ncomparing benzene concentrations that would result from a spill to an acute toxicity standard for \naquatic organisms and the EPA’s drinking water standards, rather than against a more \nappropriate No Observed Adverse Effect Level and the legally applicable standard benzene \ncontamination established by the states of North and South Dakota. \n60.  The EA compares the risk of benzene contamination at the Lake Oahe crossing \nagainst an Acute Toxicity Threshold for aquatic organisms of 7.4 ppm, which it claims is the \n“lowest acute toxicity threshold for aquatic organisms.”  The EA fails to state which organism \nthis threshold is based on.  The EA should have, but failed to use, the standard approach for an \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00267-JEB   Document 1   Filed 02/11/17   Page 22 of 34\n \n \n \necological risk assessment using a concentration known as the No Observed Adverse Effect \nLevel (NOAEL), or in the absence of such a level, the Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level \n(“LOAEL”).  The NOAEL for benzene established by the Savanah River National Laboratory is \n46 ug/l (which translates to 0.046 ppm).  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \nchronic concentration level for benzene is the same.   At a throughput of 400 bbl per minute, a \nspill of less than three minutes would result in 1,000 bbl spilled.  The EA’s estimated \nconcentration levels for benzene for a spill of 1,000 bbl (0.17 ppm) would far exceed the \nNOAEL level of 0.046 ppm for benzene. \n61.  Similarly, the EA uses the incorrect drinking water standard for benzene.  It uses \nan EPA maximum contaminant level (MCL) standard for drinking water of 0.005 mg/L, rather \nthan the applicable water quality standard for Lake Oahe contained in Section 33-16-02.1 of the \nNorth Dakota Administrative Code of 2.2 ug/L (which translates to 0.0022 mg/L).   The EA’s \nbenzene spill contamination estimates for spills of 100 bbl, 1000 bbl and 10,000 bbl are all far in \nexcess of the applicable legal standard for benzene of 0.0022 mg/L.  The EA’s conclusion that a \nspill would not pose any significant impact is legally deficient because the EA failed to measure \nestimated contamination levels against the applicable legal standard, or even consider the \napplicable legal standard. \n62.  The EA failed to recognize that a spill would render the water of Lake Oahe and \nthe Missouri River unfit for human consumption and require remediation that would take months \nor years to complete.  Although the Corps did consider the risks to drinking water due to an \ninadvertent spill, it relied on “site specific GRPs” (Geographic Response Plans) that were \nsubmitted to the Corps as “Privileged and Confidential” and, therefore, were not part of the \npublic comment process.  Upon information and belief, these site specific GRPs do not \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00267-JEB   Document 1   Filed 02/11/17   Page 23 of 34\n \n \n \nadequately mitigate against the risks of a spill, and do not include the Tribe or the Mni Wiconi \nProject in any spill response planning. \n63.  The EA states that in the event of a spill, Dakota Access would consider \nproviding alternate sources of drinking water and/or shutting down intakes and using bottled \nwater.  The EA fails to consider the feasibility, practicality, and the cost of providing bottled \nwater to the 52,000 individuals who rely on the Mni Wiconi Project for drinking water.  The EA \nalso fails to consider the cost a spill would have on water treatment facilities that currently do not \nhave the capacity to treat for benzene or hydrocarbon contamination or the costs associated with \nproviding drinking water to the individuals who would be without drinking water in the event of \na spill. \n64.  The EA fails to adequately assess how mitigation measures would reduce risk of \nspills.   The EA states that in the event of a spill, Dakota Access “would work aggressively to \nisolate the source through the use of remote-controlled shut-off valves, initiate cleanup activities, \nand contact appropriate federal and state authorities to coordinate leak containment and cleanup \nactivities.”  These actions are insufficient to mitigate impacts associated with oil spills of the \nmagnitudes that are well within the range of likely outcomes if a spill occurs.  Moreover, the EA \nsimply lists mitigation measures without assessing whether and how those mitigation measures \nare effective and whether they would reduce the risk to a sufficient degree to avoid a significant \nimpact.  \n65.  The EA fails to adequately consider risks to the pipeline from scouring of the \nlakebed and from landslide activity. \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00267-JEB   Document 1   Filed 02/11/17   Page 24 of 34\n \n \n \n66.  The EA fails to provide two documents the Corps relied upon, the “Lake Oahe \nSpill Model Discussion Report” and the “Lake Oahe HDD Risk Analysis Report,” and as a result \ncritical information regarding spill modeling was not made available for the public to review.   \n67.  Additionally, the Corps never performed an EA for the easement itself.  The EA \nand FONSI deal exclusively with granting the Section 408 permissions.  The EA does not \nencompass the easement the Corps needs to grant for Dakota Access to drill under Lake Oahe \npursuant to Section 185 of the Mineral Leasing Act.  According to the Corps, no further NEPA \ncompliance actions are required prior to the District granting the Section 408 permission for the \nProposed Action.  Yet the issuance of an easement under Section 185 is itself a “major federal \naction,” triggering NEPA review.  Sierra Club v. U. S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 990 F. Supp. 2d 9, \n31 (D.D.C. 2013). \nIII.  SUBSEQUENT ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION  \n68.  On September 9, 2016, the Army, along with the Departments of Justice and \nInterior, issued a statement that there were “important issues raised by the Standing Rock Sioux \nTribe and other tribal nations and their members” regarding DAPL, and that the Corps “will not \nauthorize constructing the [DAPL] on Corps land bordering or under Lake Oahe until it can \ndetermine whether it will need to reconsider any of its previous decisions regarding the Lake \nOahe site under [NEPA] or other federal laws.” \n69.  The Tribe raised its concerns with the EA and FONSI in a September 25, 2016 \nletter to the President, Attorney General, Secretary of the Interior, and Secretary of the Army. \nThe Tribe urged the denial of the easement, citing many of the deficiencies in the EA.  \n70.  The Tribe also raised its concerns with the EA and FONSI in a December 3, 2016, \nletter to Jo-Ellen Darcy, the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works.  This letter detailed \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00267-JEB   Document 1   Filed 02/11/17   Page 25 of 34\n \n \n \nthe Tribe’s Treaty-and statute-protected rights and concerns with the EA/FONSI and was \naccompanied by an independent expert evaluation of the EA that outlined several deficiencies of \nthe EA. \n71.  After hearing the Tribe’s concerns, and those of other tribes as well, the Corps on \nDecember 4, 2016, stated that it would not grant the easement for the DAPL to cross Lake Oahe \non the then-current record and that it would prepare an EIS prior to granting the easement at the \nLake Oahe crossing.  The memorandum announcing the decision stated: “I have concluded that a \ndecision on whether to authorize the [DAPL] to cross Lake Oahe at the proposed location merits \nadditional analysis, more rigorous exploration and evaluation of reasonable alternatives, and \ngreater public and tribal participation and comments as contemplated in the CEQ’s [NEPA] \nimplementing regulations, 40 C.F.R. §1502.14 and §1503.1.”  It also stated that the “robust \nconsideration of reasonable alternatives that I am directing together with an analysis of potential \nspill risk and impacts, and Treaty rights, is best accomplished… by preparing an Environmental \nImpact Statement.”  \n72.  On January 18, 2017, the Army published a Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an \nEIS in connection with DAPL’s request for the easement under Lake Oahe.  82 Fed. Reg. 5543 \n(Jan. 18, 2017).  The NOI provided that the comment period on the notice would end on \nFebruary 20, 2017, and that public scoping meetings would be announced at least fifteen days in \nadvance.  The NOI stated that the EIS would consider, at a minimum: (1) alternative locations \nfor the crossing, (2) potential risks and impacts of an oil spill to Lake Oahe and the Standing \nRock Sioux Tribe’s water intakes, (3) the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s Treaty rights in Lake \nOahe. \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00267-JEB   Document 1   Filed 02/11/17   Page 26 of 34\n \n \n \n73.  On January 20, 2017, President Donald J. Trump took office.  On January 24, \n2017, President Trump issued a memorandum entitled “Presidential Memorandum Regarding \nConstruction of the Dakota Access Pipeline.”  The Presidential Memorandum directed the \nSecretary of the Army to instruct the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works and the \nCorps: \nto take all actions necessary and appropriate to: \n \n(i) review and approve in an expedited manner, to the extent permitted by law and \nas warranted, and with such conditions as are necessary or appropriate, requests \nfor approvals to construct and operate the DAPL, including easements or rights-\nof-way to cross Federal areas under section 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act, as \namended, 30 U.S.C. 185; permits or approvals under section 404 of the Clean \nWater Act, 33 U.S.C. 1344; permits or approvals under section 14 of the Rivers \nand Harbors Act, 33 U.S.C. 408; and such other Federal approvals as may be \nnecessary; \n \n(ii) consider, to the extent permitted by law and as warranted, whether to rescind \nor modify the memorandum by the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil \nWorks dated December 4, 2016 (Proposed Dakota Access Pipeline Crossing at \nLake Oahe, North Dakota), and whether to withdraw the Notice of Intent to \nPrepare an Environmental Impact Statement in Connection with Dakota Access, \nLLC’s Request for an Easement to Cross Lake Oahe, North Dakota, dated January \n18, 2017, and published at 82 Fed. Reg. 5543; \n \n(iii) consider, to the extent permitted by law and as warranted, prior reviews and \ndeterminations, including the Environmental Assessment issued in July of 2016 \nfor the DAPL, as satisfying all applicable requirements of the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., and any other \nprovision of law that requires executive agency consultation or review (including \nthe consultation or review required under section 7(a) of the Endangered Species \nAct of 1973, 16 U.S.C. 1536(a)); \n \n(iv) review and grant, to the extent permitted by law and as warranted, requests \nfor waivers of notice periods arising from or related to USACE real estate policies \nand regulations; and \n \n(v) issue, to the extent permitted by law and as warranted, any approved \neasements or rights-of-way immediately after notice is provided to the Congress \npursuant to section 28(w) of the Mineral Leasing Act, as amended, 30 U.S.C. \n185(w). \n \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00267-JEB   Document 1   Filed 02/11/17   Page 27 of 34\n \n \n \n  74.  The Acting Secretary of the Army, Robert Speer, on January 31, 2017, via \nmemorandum instructed the Corps to “take all actions necessary and appropriate to full \nand unequivocally comply with the specific directives listed in subparagraphs (a)(i) thru \n(a)(v) of [Section 2(a) of the Presidential Memorandum].” Mr. Speer acknowledged in his \nMemorandum the “sensitive issues and legal challenges that lie ahead regarding the \napproval of the remaining easement” pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act.  \n75.  The Tribe submitted comments in response to the NOI.  By letter dated \nJanuary 30, 2017, the Tribe stated that the EIS should analyze DAPL’s potential impacts \non its Treaty-based and statutory rights in the Missouri River.  It also resubmitted its \ncomments on the deficiencies in the EA.  The Tribe also submitted comments on \nFebruary 7, 2017, to resubmit its September 25, 2016, letter for the record. \n76.  By memorandum dated February 7, 2017, the Senior Official Performing the \nDuties of the Assistant Secretary of the Army determined that “there is no cause for completing \nany additional environmental analysis.  Therefore, I have determined that the ASA(CW)’s \nmemorandum [of December 4, 2016, announcing the decision to prepare an EIS] must be \nrescinded.”  The Department of the Army forwarded to the Office of the Federal Register a \nnotice rescinding the NOI on February 7, 2017 —almost two weeks prior to the deadline for \npublic comment on the NOI— and the Corps granted DAPL the easement on February 8, 2017.    \n77.  No scoping session on the EIS was held.  Because the comment period was ended \nprematurely, the Tribe and the general public have been deprived of the opportunity to comment \nfurther on the proposed EIS. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nI.  FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION: VIOLATION OF NEPA AND THE APA \n \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00267-JEB   Document 1   Filed 02/11/17   Page 28 of 34\n \n \n \n78.  Plaintiff reincorporates the allegations in all preceding paragraphs. \n79.  The EA failed to adequately address the potential impacts of the issuance of the \neasement and the construction and operation of the pipeline under Lake Oahe by, inter alia: \na.  not assessing the potential impacts to the Tribe’s Treaty-protected water rights or \nrights in the Mni Wiconi Project, and not assessing whether any of the proposed \nmitigation measures would mitigate such impacts; \nb.  failing to adequately explain why the risks posed to several wellhead source water \nprotection areas in the North Bismarck route alternative caused the Corps to abandon \nthat proposed route but not to abandon the Lake Oahe crossing route that would pose \nrisk to the reserved water rights of federally recognized tribes using overly \nconservative estimates of spills and not explaining why its estimates are as \nconservative as they are;  \nc.  using the wrong standards to measure potential benzene contamination that would \nresult from a spill;  \nd.  failing to consider that a spill could result in water that is unsafe to drink, if the \ncorrect standard and correct estimates of potential spills are used;   \ne.  failing to consider that a spill would render the water of Lake Oahe and the Missouri \nRiver unfit for human consumption and require remediation that would take months \nor years to complete; \nf.  failing to include site specific GRPs (Geographic Response Plans) for public \ncomment;  \ng.  failing to consider the efficacy of spill detection and prevention measures; \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00267-JEB   Document 1   Filed 02/11/17   Page 29 of 34\n \n \n \nh.  failing to consider or assess how listed mitigation measures would reduce the impact \nof a spill; and   \ni.  failing to consider the cost a spill would have on water treatment facilities that \ncurrently do not have the capacity to treat for benzene or hydrocarbon contamination \nor the costs associated with providing drinking water to the individuals who would be \nwithout drinking water in the event of a spill. \n80.  The EA is internally inconsistent and does not demonstrate that the Corps has \ntaken the requisite hard look at the impacts of the Lake Oahe crossing.  \n81.  The EA was deficient, and the FONSI issued in reliance on it was arbitrary and \ncapricious. \n82.  The construction and operation of the pipeline under Lake Oahe will have \nsignificant impact on the human environment, including but not limited to the Tribe’s Mni \nWiconi Project, due to the risk of spills and benzene contamination to drinking water.  NEPA \ntherefore requires that the impacts of the construction and operation of the pipeline under Lake \nOahe be addressed in an EIS. \n83.  For these reasons, the Corps has acted in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, \nand not in accordance with law, in violation of NEPA and the APA.   \nII.  SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION: VIOLATION OF NEPA, THE APA, AND \nREGULATION \n \n84.  Plaintiff reincorporates the allegations in all preceding paragraphs. \n85.  The Assistant Secretary’s December 4, 2016, decision to prepare an EIS before \ndeciding whether to grant the easement for the DAPL to cross Lake Oahe was reversed just days \ninto the Administration of President Trump as a direct result of the Presidential Memorandum \nissued by President Trump on January 24, 2017.  The Presidential Memorandum directed the \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00267-JEB   Document 1   Filed 02/11/17   Page 30 of 34\n \n \n \nCorps “to review and approve in an expedited manner” the easement and any other necessary \nfederal approvals.   Although this directive, and the accompanying directive to “consider … \nwhether to rescind or modify” the decision to prepare the EIS, was couched using language “to \nthe extent permitted by law,” the Presidential Memorandum essentially directed the Corps to \napprove the easement, and cabined its discretion.  Had the officials empowered with making a \ndecision on the easement or the EIS decided not to issue the easement or to proceed with the EIS \nthey would, on information and belief, have been fired (as was Acting Attorney General Sally Q. \nYates on January 29, 2017, when she stated that she said that the Department of Justice would \nnot defend the Trump Administration’s Executive Order entitled “Protecting the Nation Foreign \nTerrorist Entry into the United States” in court).  The Presidential Memorandum inappropriately \ninterfered with the Corps’ process, ultimately resulting in a reversal of the decision to prepare an \nEIS that was to specifically analyze alternative routes for the DAPL and the DAPL’s impacts on \nTreaty rights.  \n86.  Corps regulations implementing NEPA provide: “If it is determined that an EIS is \nnot required after a notice of intent has been published, the district engineer shall terminate the \nEIS preparation and withdraw the notice of intent.”  33 C.F.R. Part 325, Appendix B, § 8(g). \n  87.  The Corps erred in concluding that an EIS was not required because the grant of \nthe easement and the construction and operation of the pipeline will cause significant impacts to \nthe environment and to the Tribe’s Treaty and statutory rights. \n  88.  The Corps’ decision to withdraw the NOI for the EIS before the end of the public \ncomment period and without holding a scoping session violated NEPA.   \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00267-JEB   Document 1   Filed 02/11/17   Page 31 of 34\n \n \n \n89.  For these reasons, the Corps has acted in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, \nand not in accordance with law, in violation of 33 C.F.R. Part 325, Appendix B, § 8(g), NEPA \nand the APA.   \nIII.  THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION: VIOLATION OF MINERAL LEASING ACT \nAND THE APA \n \n90.  Plaintiff reincorporates the allegations in all preceding paragraphs. \n91.  The Corps has also failed to fulfill the independent environmental review \nrequirements under Section 185 of the Mineral Leasing Act by failing to assess risks to the \nTribe’s Treaty-protected water rights and rights in the Mni Wiconi Project. \n92.  Assuming the Corps relied on the EA as meeting the requirements of Section 185, \nsuch reliance was arbitrary and capricious and in violation of law.  The EA was not intended to \nmeet the requirements of the MLA and, in fact, it did not meet the requirements of the MLA.   \n93.  The stipulations required by the MLA that, inter alia, “insure that activities in \nconnection with the right-of-way or permit will not violate applicable air and water quality \nstandards,” “prevent [] damage to the environment,” and “hazards to public health and safety,” \n30 U.S.C. § 185 (h)(2), are not met by the easement granted to DAPL on February 8, 2017, to \ncross Lake Oahe, because it relies on the EA, which is itself defective and arbitrary and \ncapricious. \n94.  For these reasons, the Corps has acted in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, \nand not in accordance with law, in violation of the MLA and the APA.   \nIV.

The United States holds the title to the Tribe’s Treaty rights to Missouri River \nwater in trust.  Because the federal trust responsibility runs across all parts of the Federal \nGovernment, the Corps is also responsible for upholding the United States’ trust obligations.      \n97.  The Corps has breached its trust obligations to the Tribe by failing to ensure \ncompliance with federal law in authorizations for the DAPL, which threaten the Tribe’s Treaty-\nbased reserved water rights. \n98.  For these reasons, the Corps has acted in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, \nand not in accordance with law, in violation of trust responsibility and the APA.   \nV.

The United States holds the title to the Oglala Sioux Rural Water Supply System \nof the Mni Wiconi Project in trust for the Tribe.  Because the federal trust responsibility runs \nacross all parts of the Federal Government, the Corps is also responsible for upholding the \nUnited States’ trust obligations.  \n101.  The Corps has breached its trust obligations to the Tribe by failing to ensure \ncompliance with federal law in authorizations for the DAPL, which threaten the Tribe’s rights in \nthe Mni Wiconi Project. \n102.  For these reasons, the Corps has acted in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, \nand not in accordance with law, in violation of trust responsibility, the Mni Wiconi Act, and the \nAPA.   \n   \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00267-JEB   Document 1   Filed 02/11/17   Page 33 of 34\n \n \n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests this Court grant the following relief:  \n1.

Declare that the Corps has breached its trust responsibility to the Tribe by issuing an \nEA/FONSI without assessing impacts to the Tribe’s Treaty rights and rights in the Mni \nWiconi Project; \n3.

Civil Action No. 16-1534 (JEB)  \nU.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS,    \n   \nDefendant, \n \n            and \n \nDAKOTA ACCESS, LLC, \n \n  Defendant-Intervenor. \n \n \nORDER \n \n  On July 6, 2020, this Court issued a Memorandum Opinion and separate Order \naddressing the question of remedy pending Defendant U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ \nconducting of an Environmental Impact Study on remand.  See ECF Nos. 545–46.  Of particular \nrelevance, the Court ordered that Defendant-Intervenor Dakota Access, LLC shut down and \nempty the Dakota Access Pipeline within 30 days.  Two days later, Dakota Access asked the \nCourt to stay its ruling pending an appeal, which it had filed the day of the Court’s ruling.  See \nECF Nos. 552 (Motion) & 548 (Notice of Appeal).  Dakota Access also asked for an immediate \nstatus conference on July 9, see Motion at 2, to which request this Court promptly acceded. \n  1 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 553   Filed 07/09/20   Page 2 of 3\n  At that conference, which took place this afternoon, Dakota Access emphasized its \nunderstandable desire to be heard in the Court of Appeals as soon as possible, and it asked this \nCourt to rule expeditiously on its Motion to Stay.  The Court explained that it did not see a basis \nfor a stay; indeed, the four factors courts analyze in considering stays, see, e.g., Akiachak Native \nCmty. v. Jewell, 995 F. Supp. 2d 7, 12 (D.D.C. 2014) (citing Wash. Metro. Area Transit \nComm’n v. Holiday Tours, Inc., 559 F.2d 841, 843 (D.C. Cir. 1977)), were essentially subsumed \nin the Court’s latest Opinion granting vacatur pending remand. \n  The Court nonetheless expressed its willingness to consider a modification to the logistics \nand timing of the pipeline shutdown and emptying.  Dakota Access had contended in its Motion \nthat this would take 86-101 days, see Motion at 11 (citing Third Declaration of Todd Stamm), \nand the Court asked the Tribes if they would negotiate with Dakota Access with an eye toward \nreaching an agreement on, e.g., a somewhat longer timetable.  The Tribes indicated their \nwillingness to do so and, if no agreement was reached, to file a brief by Monday, July 13, \nregarding the stay.  The Court then encouraged the parties to negotiate and explained that it \nwould rule on those logistics (absent agreement) early next week. \n  Dakota Access, mindful of the running clock, told the Court that it preferred an \nimmediate ruling denying the Motion to Stay if the Court was only waiting to try to resolve the \nlogistical and timing issues, rather than the merits.  The Court is thus obliging Dakota Access by \nissuing this expedited Order, although it remains willing to assist in mediating (or ultimately \ndeciding) any dispute regarding such logistical and timing issues if jurisdictionally permitted to \ndo so. \n   \n  2 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 553   Filed 07/09/20   Page 3 of 3\n  The Court, accordingly, ORDERS that Dakota Access’s Motion to Stay is DENIED. \nSO ORDERED. \n/s/ James E. Boasberg \n            JAMES E. BOASBERG \n            United States District Judge \n \nDate: July 9, 2020 \n  3 ",

One of its priorities is to advocate \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 533   Filed 05/21/20   Page 9 of 23\nfor the protection of Native American lands as well as environmental and cultural resources. \nAAIA’s work in this area includes training and technical assistance to Indian tribes and the general \npublic. It also actively participates in legally required environmental and cultural review processes \nby providing comments and legal assistance to Indian tribes. \nThe 28 named Tribal governments represent a diverse cross-section of Tribes throughout \nIndian country. Amici Curiae share an interest in maintaining the federal government’s fiduciary \nduty to protect the health and welfare of Indian Tribes, including the natural resources  necessary \nto  sustain  them.  Amici Curiae  offer  critical  context  regarding  the  grave  consequences  of \ndisregarding  Tribal  treaty  rights and the necessary role courts play in the accountability of the \nfederal government to Indian Tribes.  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n“Pursuant to the case law in this Circuit, vacating a rule or action promulgated in violation \nof NEPA is the standard remedy.” Humane Soc’y of U.S. v. Johanns, 520 F. Supp. 2d 8, 37 (D.D.C. \n2007) (collecting cases); see also Humane Soc’y of U.S. v. Zinke, 865 F.3d 585, 614 (D.C. Cir. \n2017) (noting vacatur is “[a] common remedy”). Only in “rare circumstances” is there a remand \nwithout vacatur. See Humane Soc’y of U.S. v. Locke, 626 F.3d 1040, 1053 n.7 (9th Cir. 2010). \n“The decision whether to vacate depends on the seriousness of the order’s deficiencies (and thus \nthe extent of doubt whether the agency chose correctly) and the disruptive consequences of an \ninterim change that may itself be changed.” Allied-Signal, Inc. v. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory \nComm’n, 988 F.2d 146, 150-51 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (quoting Int’l Union, UMW v. FMSHA, 920 F.2d \n960, 967 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (internal quotation marks omitted)). “Because vacatur is the default \nremedy . . . defendants bear the burden to prove that vacatur is unnecessary.” Nat’l Parks \nConservation Ass’n v. Semonite, 422 F. Supp. 3d 92, 99 (D.D.C. 2019). \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 533   Filed 05/21/20   Page 10 of 23\nAs this Court weighs the costs and benefits under Allied Signal, your Amici Curiae suggest \nthat this equitable analysis should also be informed by where those costs and benefits are \ndistributed. Put another way: Who benefits and who is burdened? Unfortunately, this case presents \nyet  another  instance  where  Tribes  and  Native  communities  are  burdened,  and  non-Native \ncorporations  reap  enormous  benefits.  It  is  surely  inequitable  to  again  expect  the  Tribal \ngovernments and communities represented in this case to bear the hazards posed by oil spills while \nthe Corps ponders the magnitude of that risk and Dakota Access cashes its checks. Conversely, \nstopping the flow of oil in the pipeline during remand ensures the ordered process established by \nNEPA and provides an opportunity for the Corps to properly evaluate impacts on the Tribes’ treaty \nresources. This case does not present the “rare circumstances” counseling against vacatur.   \n \nARGUMENT \nI.  REMANDING WITHOUT VACATUR WOULD CONTINUE THE INEQUITABLE \nPATTERN  OF  SHIFTING  THE  BURDENS  OF  INFRASTRUCTURE \nDEVELOPMENT ONTO INDIAN TRIBES. \n \nThe federal government has a long history of approving infrastructure projects, such as the \none at issue in this case, without due consideration of Tribal rights and over the objections of Tribal \ngovernments. These projects have come at great cost to Indian Tribes – harming the health of \nTribal citizens, damaging Tribal natural resources, sacred places, and disregarding treaty rights. \nAt the same time, the benefits of these projects have not inured to Tribes and their citizens, whose \ndrinking water, roads, and other infrastructure is either nonexistent or in shambles. See U.S. \nCommission on Civil Rights, Broken Promises: Continuing Federal Funding Shortfall for Native \nAmericans 165-166 (2018). Every single Indian Tribe has a story of federally approved destruction \n– often several.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 533   Filed 05/21/20   Page 11 of 23\nThe burden shouldered by the Tribes, both historically and with reference to the Dakota \nAccess Pipeline (“DAPL”), should be in the front of this Court’s mind in weighing whether vacatur \nis the appropriate remedy. Especially relevant to this case is the Pick-Sloan Project, which \nburdened the Tribes with tremendous costs, while non-Natives reaped the benefits. This project \ndammed significant areas of the Missouri River and “caused more damage to Native American \nlands and resources than any other single public works project in the United States.” Michael \nLawson, The Historical Backdrop Leading up to DAPL Protests Today, Indianz.com (Nov. 9, \n2016),  https://www.indianz.com/News/2016/11/09/michael-lawson-roots-of-nodapl-\nmovement.asp. The project “inundated 160,000 acres of reservation lands, including 56,000 acres \non the Standing Rock reservation.” Id. A product of this project was Lake Oahe, the location of \nthe pipeline at issue in the instant case.  \nThe Corps was a particularly bad actor in the sordid history of the Pick-Sloan Project. \nWithout authorization, it altered portions of the project to protect non-Indian communities and \nflood Indian communities. Michael L. Lawson, Dammed Indians: The Pick-Sloan Plan and the \nMissouri River Sioux, 1944-1980 59 (1982). If that weren’t bad enough, in the initial stages of \nconstruction of the Oahe Dam, the Corps attempted to condemn portions of Standing Rock land \nwithout the required condemnation authority.  Michael  L.  Lawson, The Oahe Dam and the \nStanding Rock Sioux 218 (1976). At the behest of Standing Rock, a court stepped in and ruled in \n1958 that the Corps’ actions were “wholly repugnant to the entire history of Congressional and \njudicial treatment of the Indians[.]” Id.  \nThe shifting of the costs onto the Tribes was neither happenstance nor oversight. Indeed, \nCongress acknowledged at the time of the Oahe Dam’s construction that it would benefit mostly \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 533   Filed 05/21/20   Page 12 of 23\nthe non-Indian communities below the lake, and that “no benefits will accrue to the Indians.” \nDammed Indians, supra, at 65. \nThis destructive legacy lives on across the Dakotas today. As a result of the Corps’ \noperation of the Missouri River, the various lakes in North and South Dakota “experience huge \nfluctuations in their water levels.” Peter Capossela, Impacts of the Army Corps of Engineers’ Pick-\nSloan Program on the Indian Tribes of the Missouri River Basin, 30 J. Envtl. L. & Litig. 143, 188 \n(2015). “This has significant impacts on the water supply, aesthetics and natural environment [of \nthe Great Plains] Tribal communities along the upper Missouri River . . . .” Id. The ability to use \nreserved water rights is also impacted by the Corps’ operation. Id. Consistently, the Corps favors \n“downstream navigation and water intakes, to the detriment of water uses on Indian reservations.” \nId. at 197. Consequently, extremely low levels of water result in silt deposits that destroy public \nwater systems on reservations and, in turn, cause the loss of water for weeks at a time. Id. The \nAmerican Psychological Association has observed a link between the United States’ historical \nabuses, DAPL, and the mental well-being of Tribal citizens: “Research has linked historical trauma \nto  health  disparities,  including  increased  likelihood  of  early  death  due  to  substance  abuse, \nunintentional injuries, assault, homicide and suicide.” American Psychological Association, APA \nUrges Trump Administration to Safeguard Standing Rock Sioux in Response to Memorandum on \nDakota Access Pipeline (Jan. 26, 2017), http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2017/01/trump-\ndakota-pipeline.aspx.  \nThis case is yet another instance of the Corps running roughshod over the Tribes’ treaty \nrights while non-Natives receive the benefit. Having concluded more than two years ago that the \nCorps’ decision was “potentially lawful but insufficiently or inappropriately explained,” Standing \nRock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 282 F. Supp. 3d 91, 103 (2017) (“Standing Rock \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 533   Filed 05/21/20   Page 13 of 23\nIV”) (quoting Radio Television News Directs Ass’n v. FCC, 184 F.3d 872, 888 (D.C. Cir. 1999)), \nthis  Court  gave  the  Corps  ample  opportunity  to  provide  an  explanation  fulfilling  NEPA’s \nrequirements. Standing Rock IV, 282 F. Supp. 3d at 98. The Court even suggested ways in which \nthe Corps could cure its errors. Id. at100.  At the same time, the Court set the expectation that “the \nCorps not [] treat remand as an exercise in filling out the proper paperwork post hoc.” Id. at 109. \nYet, that is precisely what the Corps did and, even with a court-provided roadmap, the Corps still \ncame up short – again. See Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, No. 16-1534, \n2020 WL 1441923, at *16 (D.D.C. Mar. 25, 2020) (“Standing Rock V”).  \nThe consequences to the Tribes are not merely theoretical or abstract. The Treaties of Fort \nLaramie created a permanent homeland for these Tribal citizens, and reserves to them fish and \ngame resources necessary to sustain them. Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851, arts. 5, 11 Stat. 749; Treaty \nof Fort Laramie with the Sioux, 15 Stat. 635, art. 2 (1868); Standing Rock V, 2020 WL 1441923, \nat *2. The waters of Lake Oahe support not only the Tribes’ treaty-reserved fish and game \nresources, but are also vital for “drinking, agriculture, industry, and sacred religious and medicinal \npractices.” See Standing Rock V, 2020 WL 1441923 at *3. It is clear that the flow of oil through \nthis pipeline was predicated on a flawed process, which did not consider impacts to the Tribes’ \nrights.  Consequently,  the  Corps’  imperiled  the  Tribes’  treaty-guaranteed  resources  without \nunderstanding the magnitude of the risk. Moreover, at bottom, the Corps’ insistence on opening \nthe pipeline created the purported reliance interests that Dakota Access and its amici now beg this \nCourt to preserve. They would not be in that position if the Corps had simply followed the law \nrather than hastily opening the pipeline.  \nRemanding without vacatur would once again elevate non-Native pecuniary interests \nabove the Tribes’ legal rights.  \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 533   Filed 05/21/20   Page 14 of 23\nII.  VACATUR ENFORCES NEPA IN A MANNER THAT PROTECTS TRIBAL \nTREATY RIGHTS AND HOLDS AGENCIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR \nTRIBAL TRUST OBLIGATIONS. \n \nProtection of the Tribes’ treaty-reserved rights and NEPA’s procedural requirements are \ninextricably tied. As their trustee, the federal government owes a fiduciary obligation to Indian \ntribes. See Pit River Tribe v. U.S. Forest Serv., 469 F.3d 768, 788 (9th Cir. 2006); Colette Routel \n& Jeffrey Holth, Toward Genuine Tribal Consultation in the 21st Century, 46 U. Mich. J.L. \nReform  417  (2013).  At  a  minimum,  this  fiduciary  obligation  requires  the  government  to \ndemonstrate “compliance with general regulations and statutes not specifically aimed at protecting \nIndian tribes.” Pit River Tribe, 469 F.3d at 788 (quoting Morongo Band of Mission Indians v. Fed. \nAviation Admin., 161 F.3d 569, 574 (9th Cir. 1998)). NEPA requires an agency to take a “hard \nlook”  at  issues  affecting  a  tribe’s  reserved  rights  when  considering  the  environmental \nconsequences of a proposed action. See Okanogan Highlands All. v. Williams, 236 F.3d 468, 480 \n(9th  Cir.  2000);  Edwardsen  v.  U.S.  Dep’t  of  Interior,  268  F.3d  781, 785  (9th  Cir.  2001); \nMuckleshoot Indian Tribe v. U.S. Forest Serv., 177 F.3d 800, 809 (9th Cir. 1999) (EIS must \nexamine probable environmental consequences, including consideration of a tribe’s reserved \nrights); see also Standing Rock V, 2020 WL 1441923, at *2 (citing Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. \nU.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 255 F. Supp. 3d 101, 130-32 (D.D.C. 2017) (“Standing Rock III”)). \nHence, violation of NEPA requirements constitutes a failure of the federal government to meet its \nminimum fiduciary obligations to Indian tribes. Pit River Tribe, 469 F.3d at 788.  \nRobust judicial enforcement of NEPA is, therefore, key to ensuring thorough examination \nof the effects of agency action on tribal treaty resources. Timing is of the utmost importance in \norder for NEPA to achieve its goals through procedural mechanisms. See Sierra Club v. Peterson, \n717 F.2d 1409, 1415 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (“If any ‘significant’ environmental impacts might result \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 533   Filed 05/21/20   Page 15 of 23\nfrom the proposed agency action then an EIS must be prepared before the action is taken.” \n(emphasis in original)); Grand Canyon Trust v. FAA, 290 F.3d 339, 340 (D.C. Cir. 2002); Standing \nRock  V,  2020  WL  1441923,  at  *2.  For  example,  a  chief  function  of  NEPA’s  procedural \nrequirements is to facilitate informed public comment on the proposed action and alternatives that \nmight cause less harm. Inland Empire Pub. Lands Council v. U.S. Forest Serv., 88 F.3d 754, 758 \n(9th Cir. 1996); Lands Council v. Powell, 395 F.3d 1019, 1027 (9th Cir. 2005); 42 U.S.C. § \n4332(E); 40 C.F.R. § 1500.1(c); see also Te-Moak Tribe of W. Shoshone of Nev. v. U.S. Dep't of \nInterior, 608 F.3d 592, 601–02 (9th Cir. 2010). However, a post hoc EIS, developed after agency \naction is taken, denies meaningful public input and may deprive the agency of critical data and \ninformation regarding less harmful alternatives. This type of “ready, fire, aim” approach risks \ncreating a hazard that may not be fully understood – precisely the folly that NEPA’s ordered \nprocedural requirements were enacted to avoid.  \nSuch is the case at bar. The Tribes set forth numerous scientific critiques that highlight the \nhazards posed by oil flowing through the pipeline, but the Corps gave them short shrift and, as this \nCourt concluded, did not adequately examine them under NEPA’s lens. Standing Rock V, 2020 \nWL 1441923, at *16. Expert reports showed the leak detection systems employed by DAPL fail \n80% of the time. Id. at *9. Moreover, the pipeline’s design allows for about 25,200 gallons/day to \nbe released, over a long period of time, without detection. Id. The Corps response that the leak \nwould be detected in some unspecified period of time was, in this Court’s words, “less than \nreassuring.” Id. at *10. Despite these concerns being repeatedly raised, the Corps attorney said that \n“there was no particular reason that they didn’t look at a slow leak” scenario. Id. \nThe Corps, likewise, did not account for the historic performance of the operator. Id. at \n*10-11. Perhaps it was because the operator’s history “did not inspire confidence.” Id. at 10. From \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 533   Filed 05/21/20   Page 16 of 23\n2006-2016, Sunoco experienced 276 incidents, resulting in over $53 million in property damage. \nId. Rather than give this data a “hard look,” as NEPA requires, the Corps “focused its responses \non defending the operator’s performance record” and offered “form language” responses to these \ncritiques. Id. at *10-11. \nNot only did the Corps gloss over failure rates and operator performance, serious concerns \nabout spill response have gone unrebutted. Id. at *11. And perhaps worst of all, the Corps did not \nadequately analyze the maximum amount of oil that could possibly leak from the pipeline before \na spill is detected and stopped. Id. at *14-15. \nAt best the Corps is flying blind, and at worst it swept crucially important scientific \ncritiques under the rug. Either way, it fell short of the robust analysis mandated by NEPA, and its \nabdication leaves the Tribes’ treaty resources imperiled. Further, it is far from certain that the \nCorps will be able to resolve these scientific controversies on remand, especially in light of the \nfact that their past responses were so woefully inadequate, despite ample opportunity to (again) \nprovide this Court with an improved analysis and explanations. See Id. at *16 (describing Corps \npast opportunities to supplement its analysis). Ultimately, “[v]acatur ensures that the project will \nproceed only with the benefit of a fully fleshed out consideration of the issues required by \nNEPA[,]” Friends of the Capital Crescent Trail v. Fed. Transit Admin., 218 F. Supp. 3d 53, 60 \n(D.D.C. 2016), which includes the Tribes’ treaty rights. \nThe nature of the Tribes’ rights in this case also counsels in favor of vacatur. Analogously, \nseveral courts have concluded that Tribal treaty rights warrant unique protection in the preliminary \ninjunction context because harm to them is presumed to be irreparable. See United States v. \nMichigan, 508 F. Supp. 480, 492 (W.D. Mich. 1980), aff’d, 712 F.2d 242 (6th Cir. 1983); Nez \nPerce Tribe v. U.S. Forest Serv., No. 3:13-CV-348-BLW, 2013 WL 5212317, at *7 (D. Idaho \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 533   Filed 05/21/20   Page 17 of 23\nSept. 12, 2013) (“The plaintiffs are not seeking damages; they are seeking to preserve their Treaty \nrights along with cultural and intrinsic values that have no price tag.”). Such is the case here: oil \nspills from DAPL threaten destruction of the subject of their treaty rights (fish and game). When \nthese most basic, treaty-guaranteed rights to food and a homeland are imperiled, it is prudent to \nremove the hazard while significant scientific controversies are resolved.  \nMoreover, under these circumstances, shutting off the flow of oil in the pipeline is a modest \nand reasonable remedy. Unlike Semonite, “Plaintiffs are not asking for the pipeline itself, or for \nany existing infrastructure, to be dismantled.” Compare Standing Rock IV, 282 F. Supp. 3d at 107 \nwith Semonite, 422 F. Supp. 3d at 100. Instead, the Tribes seek removal of the hazard – the \npresence of which was facilitated by the Corps’ NEPA violation. Vacatur is a prudent safety \nmeasure, which holds the agency accountable for its statutory and tribal trust obligations. Without \nvacatur, the Corps has little incentive to act expeditiously, see Kristina Daugirdas, Evaluating \nRemand Without Vacatur: A New Judicial Remedy for Defective Agency Rulemakings, 80 N.Y.U. \nL. Rev. 278, 302-305 (2005) (analyzing cases where agencies did not prioritize remand when there \nwas no vacatur), thus potentially exposing the Tribes to the hazard ad infinitum and compounding \nthe consequences of the Corps’ error.     \nThe rejoinder of the Corps and Dakota Access that “the risk of an oil spill is low” merely \ninvites this Court to share in their myopia. It completely misses the central, unresolved question: \nthe potential magnitude of an oil spill should it occur. Likewise, their alarmist assertions about the \nfinancial impact of shutting off the pipeline are predictable arguments in Indian treaty cases. Most \ncourts see it for what it is: profiting at the expense of Indians. Many cases involving tribal treaty \nrights similarly require costly outlays to remedy interference with those legal rights. See, e.g., \nUnited States v. Washington, 864 F.3d 1017 (9th Cir. 2017) (denying en banc review where state \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 533   Filed 05/21/20   Page 18 of 23\nprojected $1.88 billion cost to remediate infrastructure installed in violation of tribal treaty rights). \nThe solution is clear and simple: do not imperil Tribal treaty rights in the first instance. Give treaty \nrights  due  consideration  and  analysis  in  advance  and  develop  mitigation  measures  where \nnecessary. Engage in Tribal consultation early in the planning process, so that there is a clear \nunderstanding of tribal rights, interests, and concerns. Looked at in this light, “stop, look, and \nlisten” statutes, such as NEPA, implemented with appropriate consultation procedures, protect the \ninterests of all parties.  \nVacatur incentivizes an ordered process that analyzes possible environmental harms – \nincluding to Indian treaty resources – and develops mitigation measures where necessary in \nadvance, just as the statute requires. Conversely, remanding without vacatur transforms a process \nprotective of tribal rights into an exercise in clerical tidying up. It would allow the Corps to \ndisregard its obligations entirely and signal to federal agencies that they can ignore Tribal treaty \nrights and federal trust obligations in approving projects and later simply invoke the rejoinder of \n“disruptive consequences” to absolve themselves. This is a far cry from NEPA’s procedural design \nof considering impacts on tribal rights in advance of making a decision, and is certainly not how \ngreat nations keep their word. See Fed. Power Comm'n v. Tuscarora Indian Nation, 362 U.S. 99, \n142 (1960) (Black, J., dissenting) (“Great nations, like great men, should keep their word.”).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 533   Filed 05/21/20   Page 19 of 23\nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, Amici Curiae respectfully request that this Court issue the \nstandard remedy and vacate the easement on remand to the Corps. \nRespectfully submitted this 20th day of May, 2020. \n \n/s/ Matthew Lee Campbell \nMatthew Lee Campbell, D.C.

Civil Action No. 16-1534 (JEB) \nU.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS, et   \nal., \n \n        Defendants. \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \n \n“Since the founding of this nation, the United States’ relationship with the Indian tribes \nhas been contentious and tragic.  America’s expansionist impulse in its formative years led to the \nremoval and relocation of many tribes, often by treaty but also by force.”  Cobell v. Norton, 240 \nF.3d 1081, 1086 (D.C. Cir. 2001).  This case also features what an American Indian tribe \nbelieves is an unlawful encroachment on its heritage.  More specifically, the Standing Rock \nSioux Tribe has sued the United States Army Corps of Engineers to block the operation of Corps \npermitting for the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL).  The Tribe fears that construction of the \npipeline, which runs within half a mile of its reservation in North and South Dakota, will destroy \nsites of cultural and historical significance.  It has now filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction, \nasserting principally that the Corps flouted its duty to engage in tribal consultations under the \nNational Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and that irreparable harm will ensue.  After digging \nthrough a substantial record on an expedited basis, the Court cannot concur.  It concludes that the \nCorps has likely complied with the NHPA and that the Tribe has not shown it will suffer injury \n1 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 2 of 58\nthat would be prevented by any injunction the Court could issue.  The Motion will thus be \ndenied. \nI.  Background \nDAPL is a domestic oil pipeline designed to move over a half-billion gallons of crude oil \nacross four states daily.  The oil enters the pipeline in North Dakota, crosses South Dakota and \nIowa, and winds up in Patoka, Illinois, nearly 1,200 miles later.  Although the route does not \nactually cross the Standing Rock reservation, it runs within a half-mile of it.  \nA project of this magnitude often necessitates an extensive federal appraisal and \npermitting process.  Not so here.  Domestic oil pipelines, unlike natural-gas pipelines, require no \ngeneral approval from the federal government.  In fact, DAPL needs almost no federal permitting \nof any kind because 99% of its route traverses private land.  \nOne significant exception, however, concerns construction activities in federally \nregulated waters at hundreds of discrete places along the pipeline route.  The Corps needed to \npermit this activity under the Clean Water Act or the Rivers and Harbors Act – and sometimes \nboth.  For DAPL, accordingly, it permitted these activities under a general permit known as \nNationwide Permit 12.  The Tribe alleges that the Corps violated multiple federal statutes in \ndoing so, including the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the National Historic \nPreservation Act (NHPA).  In its Complaint, the Tribe asserts that this DAPL permitting \nthreatens its environmental and economic well-being, as well as its cultural resources. \nDespite this broad lawsuit, however, the Standing Rock Sioux now seek a preliminary \ninjunction only on the alleged violation of the NHPA.  That statute encompasses sites of cultural \nor religious significance to Indian tribes and requires that federal agencies consult with tribes \nprior to issuing permits that might affect these historic resources.  The Tribe claims that the \n2 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 3 of 58\nCorps did not fulfill this obligation before permitting the DAPL activities.  It bears noting that \nthe Tribe does not press its environmental claims under NEPA here.  Nor does it seek a \npreliminary injunction to protect itself from the potential environmental harms that might arise \nfrom having the pipeline on its doorstep.  Instead, it asserts only that pipeline-construction \nactivities – specifically, the grading and clearing of land – will cause irreparable injury to historic \nor cultural properties of great significance.  \nThe statutes and permitting scheme involved in this Motion are undeniably complex.  The \nCourt first sets forth the operation of the NHPA, which the Tribe asserts was violated.  It next \nexplains the Clean Water Act and the Rivers and Harbors Act, under which the Corps permitted \nthe DAPL activities.  Subsequent sections lay out the factual and legal proceedings that have \ntaken place thus far. \nA.  National Historic Preservation Act \nCongress enacted the NHPA in 1966 to “foster conditions under which our modern \nsociety and our historic property can exist in productive harmony.”  54 U.S.C. § 300101(1).  To \nthis end, Section 106 of the Act requires a federal agency to consider the effect of its \n“undertakings” on property of historical significance, which includes property of cultural or \nreligious significance to Indian tribes.  Id. §§ 306108, 302706(b).  An undertaking is defined \nbroadly to include any “project, activity, or program” that requires a federal permit.  Id. \n§ 300320.  Section 106, like the National Environmental Policy Act, is often described as a \n“stop, look, and listen” provision.  See Narragansett Indian Tribe v. Warwick Sewer Auth., 334 \nF.3d 161, 166 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting Muckleshoot Indian Tribe v. U.S. Forest Serv., 177 F.3d \n800, 805 (9th Cir. 1999) (per curiam)).  The agency must also give the Advisory Council on \nHistoric Protection, which is charged with passing regulations to govern the implementation of \n3 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 4 of 58\nSection 106, “a reasonable opportunity to comment on the undertaking.” 54 U.S.C. § 306108.  \nThe agency must further consult with, inter alia, tribes “that attach religious or cultural \nsignificance to [affected] property.”  Id. § 302706(b).  Once this is done, Section 106 is satisfied.  \nIn other words, the provision does not mandate that the permitting agency take any particular \npreservation measures to protect these resources.  See CTIA-Wireless Ass’n v. FCC, 466 F.3d \n105, 106-07 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (citing Davis v. Latschar, 202 F.3d 359, 370 (D.C. Cir. 2000)). \nThe Advisory Council also promulgates the regulations necessary to implement Section \n106, see 54 U.S.C. § 304108(a), and these regulations “command substantial judicial deference.”  \nMcMillan Park Comm. v. Nat’l Capital Planning Comm’n, 968 F.2d 1283, 1288 (D.C. Cir. \n1992).  Under them, the permitting agency – here, the Corps – first determines “whether the \nproposed Federal action is an undertaking . . . and, if so, whether it is a type of activity that has \nthe potential to cause effects on historic properties.”  36 C.F.R. § 800.3(a).  Where the agency \ndecides either that there is no undertaking or that the undertaking is not the “type of activity” that \nhas the “potential to cause effects on historic properties, assuming such . . . properties were \npresent,” the Section 106 process is complete.  Id. § 800.3(a)(1).  No consultation happens and \nthe permit may issue.  Id. \nThings get more complicated where the agency cannot make this determination.  In such \na situation, the agency must complete a multi-step “consultation” process before it permits the \nundertaking.  Id. § 800.16(f).  Indian tribes that “attach religious and cultural significance to \nhistoric properties” that may be affected by the “undertaking” are a consulting party in this \nprocess even when the properties are located outside reservation lands.  Id. § 800.2(a)(4), \n(c)(2)(ii).  The regulations in fact instruct agencies to recognize that property of importance to \nIndian tribes is “frequently” located on “ancestral, aboriginal, or ceded lands.”  Id. \n4 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 5 of 58\n§ 800.2(c)(2)(ii)(D).  Once its interests are implicated, the affected tribe must be given a \nreasonable opportunity: “to identify its concerns about [these] properties”; to “advise on the \nidentification and evaluation of” them; to “articulate its views on the undertaking’s effects”; and \nto “participate in the resolution of adverse effects.”  Id. § 800.2(c)(2)(ii)(A).  The agency is \nfurther directed to conduct these consultations “early in the planning process,” id., in a “sensitive \nmanner respectful of tribal sovereignty,” and recognizing “the government-to-government \nrelationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes.”  Id. § 800.2(c)(2)(ii)(B)-(C).  \nThe regulations then put meat on these aspirational bones by laying out the step-by-step \nconsultative process that must occur.  The process begins with initial planning, where the agency \n“determine[s] the appropriate SHPO . . . to be involved.”  Id. § 800.3(c).  The State Historic \nPreservation Officer – viz., SHPO – is designated by the governor of the state to, inter alia, \nadminister this national historic-preservation program at the state level.  In consultation with this \nOfficer, an agency official then “identif[ies] any other parties entitled to be consulting parties \nand invite[s] them to participate.”  Id. § 800.3(f).   \nSuch parties then assist the agency to identify potential historic properties in the first \nphase.  The permitting official, along with the SHPO, initially “[d]etermine[s] and document[s] \nthe area of potential effects,” “[r]eview[s] existing information on historic properties within the \narea of potential effects,” “[s]eek[s] information, as appropriate, from consulting parties,” and \n“[g]ather[s] information from any [consulting] tribe . . . to assist in identifying properties” of \npotential significance to them.  Id. § 800.4(a).  Based on this information, the agency then “shall \ntake the steps necessary to identify historic properties within the area of potential effects.”  Id. \n§ 800.4(b).  This identification effort extends to the “geographic area or areas within which an \nundertaking may directly or indirectly cause alterations in the character or use of historic \n5 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 6 of 58\nproperties, if any such properties exist.”  Id. § 800.16(d) (defining “area[s] of potential effects”).  \nThe scope of this area is also “influenced by the scale and nature of an undertaking and may be \ndifferent for different kinds of effects caused by the undertaking.”  Id.  In this area, the official, \nthrough consultations, must “make a reasonable and good faith effort,” “which may include \nbackground research, consultation, oral history interviews, sample field investigation, and field \nsurvey” to identify potential historic properties.  Id. § 800.4(b)(1) (emphasis added).  In deciding \non the “[l]evel of effort” required, the official “take[s] into account past planning, research and \nstudies, the magnitude and nature of the undertaking and the degree of Federal involvement, the \nnature and extent of potential effects on historic properties, and the likely nature and location of \nhistoric properties within the area of potential effects.”  Id. \nOnce the potentially relevant historic sites are identified, the official moves on to \nevaluating the historical significance of these sites in consultation with the SHPO and tribes.  Id. \n§ 800.4(c).  This step must be taken in a manner that recognizes that the tribes “possess special \nexpertise in assessing the eligibility of historic properties that may possess religious and cultural \nsignificance to them.”  Id. § 800.4(c)(1).  Nevertheless, where the agency official and SHPO \nagree that an identified property should not be considered eligible for listing on the National \nRegister of Historic Places, “the property shall be considered not eligible.”  Id. § 800.4(c)(2).  \nThe permitting agency may then decide at this stage “that either there are no historic properties \npresent or there are historic properties present but the undertaking will have no effect upon \nthem,” document this finding, and notify all consulting parties.  Id. § 800.4(d)(1).  If neither the \nSHPO nor the Advisory Council (if it has entered the consultation) “object within 30 days of \nreceipt of an adequately documented finding, the agency official’s responsibilities under Section \n106 are fulfilled.”  Id. § 800.4(d)(1)(i).  \n6 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 7 of 58\nThe agency otherwise proceeds to a third stage: assessment of the adverse effects on the \nidentified historic properties.  Id. § 800.5(a).  An effect is considered adverse when the \nundertaking may “alter, directly or indirectly, any of the characteristics of a historic property that \nqualify it for inclusion in the National Register,” including via the “introduction of visual, \natmospheric or audible elements that diminish the integrity of the property’s significant historic \nfeatures.”  Id. § 800.5(a)(1), (2)(v).  At this point, the agency may determine in consultation with \nthe other parties that there is no qualifying adverse effect or impose modifications or conditions \nthat lead to the same result.  Id. § 800.5(b).  Alternatively, the Section 106 process may proceed \nto a fourth and final stage involving resolution of the adverse effects in consultation with the \nother parties.  Id. § 800.6.  The agency may, however, terminate this final consultation if it \nbecomes unproductive and then proceed to permit the undertaking despite the effects.  Id. \n§ 800.7(a). \nA few important global rules also apply to each stage of this process.  The permitting \nagency is empowered to “coordinate the steps of the Section 106 process, as appropriate, with \nthe overall planning schedule for the undertaking and with any reviews required under” other \nstatutes.  Id. § 800.3(b).  The agency may also “use the services of applicants [or] consultants” to \nprepare required “information, analyses, and recommendations” in making any of the various \ndeterminations.  Id. § 800.2(a)(3).  Finally, the regulations allow agencies to “develop procedures \nto implement Section 106 and substitute them” for its procedures where the Advisory Council \ndetermines “they are consistent with the Council’s regulations.”  Id. § 800.14(a). \nB.  Clean Water Act  \nThe CWA makes it unlawful to discharge dredged or fill material into navigable waters \nwithout a permit issued by the Corps.  See 33 U.S.C. §§ 1311(a), 1342(a).  The Corps grants this \n7 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 8 of 58\napproval in one of two ways: It issues individual permits for a specific action, id. § 1344(a), or it \npromulgates general permits that preauthorize a certain type of activity within a defined area.  Id. \n§ 1344(e)(1); see Sierra Club v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 803 F.3d 31, 38-40 (D.C. Cir. \n2015).   \nGeneral permitting has obvious advantages over individual permitting.  Most notably, \ngeneral permits provide standing authority for an entire category of activities where those \nactivities, alone and together, have minimal impact on regulated waters.  See Sierra Club, 803 \nF.3d at 38-40; see also 33 U.S.C. § 1344(e)(1).  They consequently eliminate the need for an \narduous permit process for each minor action affecting a U.S. waterway.  Indeed, a permittee \nmay typically rely on the general permit without even notifying the Corps of its covered activity.  \nSee 33 C.F.R. § 330.1(e)(1).  To keep things rolling, the Corps need only issue the permit \nthrough public notice and comment every five years.  See 33 U.S.C. § 1344(e)(2).  \nBut not every activity covered by a general permit receives this hands-off treatment.  \nActions proceeding under nationwide general permits also must comply with what are known as \nGeneral Conditions.  These GCs sometimes require that a particular covered action be subject to \npre-construction notice and verification (PCN) by the Corps before the work begins.  Where a \ndiscrete action requires a PCN, a Corps district engineer must confirm that the activity will \ncomply with the general permit, cause no more than minimal adverse effects to the environment, \nand serve the public interest.  See 33 C.F.R. §§ 330.1(e)(2)-(3), 330.6(a)(3)(i).  In so doing, the \ndistrict engineer may supplement the permit’s basic rules with more project-specific ones or even \n8 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 9 of 58\ncompel a more rigorous individual permitting process for that particular work.  Id. § 330.6(a)(2), \n(d).   \nThe Corps here relies on one such general permit – Nationwide Permit 12 – to authorize \n“the construction, maintenance, repair, and removal” of pipelines throughout the nation, where \nthe activity will affect no more than a half-acre of regulated waters at any single water crossing.  \nSee Reissuance of Nationwide Permits (NWP 12), 77 Fed Reg. 10,184, 10,271 (Feb. 12, 2012); \nsee also Sierra Club, Inc. v. Bostick, 787 F.3d 1043, 1056 (10th Cir. 2015).  Each stand-alone \ncrossing of a waterway is considered to be a “single and complete project” for these purposes.  \nSee 33 C.F.R. § 330.2(i).  Most pipeline work that involves minor activities in U.S. waters – i.e., \naffecting no more than half an acre – can thus proceed without any advance notice to the Corps. \nWork that implicates tribal interests, however, cannot receive this laissez-faire handling.  \nFor example, GC 17 – not at issue here – prohibits the sanctioning of any activity under NWP 12 \nthat will impair reserved tribal rights, including reserved water rights.  See NWP 12 at 10,283.  \nOf more relevance, GC 20 mandates a PCN for any permitted activity that “may have the \npotential to cause effects to any historic properties . . . including previously unidentified \nproperties” of cultural or religious importance to a tribe.  Id. at 10,284.  This includes activities \nthat may cause only “visual or noise” effects to historic properties outside the project area or \nreserved tribal lands.  Id. at 10,251.  Before such an activity can proceed, a district engineer must \nverify either (1) that it will not actually affect any identified historic site or (2) that the tribal \nconsultations required by the NHPA are complete.  Id. at 10,284.  And, should a sanctioned \nactivity nevertheless stumble upon tribal artifacts or remains, GC 21 mandates that the permittee \n“immediately notify” the Corps and, to the maximum extent possible, halt “construction \n9 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 10 of 58\nactivities that may affect” these objects until coordination with state, tribal, and federal \nauthorities is complete.  Id.   \nNWP 12 also allows a district engineer to impose additional Regional Conditions where \nthe district engineer deems the General Conditions insufficient to protect tribal interests.  See \nECF No. 6, Exh. 1 (Decision Document for NWP 12) at 10; see also 33 C.F.R. § 330.5(b)(2)(ii).  \nMany of these Regional Conditions restrict the scope of the Permit or expand the types of \nactivities requiring a PCN process before an activity may proceed under it.  See, e.g., ECF No. \n21, Exh. 3 (2012 NWP Regional Conditions for North Dakota).  Of particular relevance to this \nMotion, North Dakota’s Regional Conditions require a PCN “prior to initiating any regulated \nactivity in the Missouri River.”  Id. at 1.  Permittees also must notify the Corps of “the location \nof any borrow site that will be used in conjunction with the construction of the authorized \nactivity so that the Corps may evaluate the site for potential impacts to . . . historic properties.”  \nId. at 2.   \nThe Corps’ more general permitting regulations further purport to assure that, in the \n“processing and evaluating of [any] permit,” a district engineer give “maximum consideration \n[to] historic properties within the time and jurisdictional constraints of the Corps regulatory \nprogram.”  33 C.F.R. pt. 325, app. C, § 2(f).  Appendix C of these regulations addresses the \nCorps’ NHPA obligations and requires a district engineer to “take into account the effects, if any, \nof proposed undertakings on historic properties both within and beyond the waters of the U.S.”  \nId. § 2(a).  The Corps considers each permitted water crossing of a linear pipeline, however, to \nbe its own individual undertaking because the rest of the project –  i.e., the entire line – “almost \nalway[s] can be undertaken without Corps authorization” of such individual crossing by a \nfeasible reroute.  Id. § 1(g)(4)(i).  In other words, the Corps does not consider each crossing to be \n10 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 11 of 58\nthe “but for” cause of the entire pipeline and thus does not consider the entire pipeline to be an \nundertaking.  Instead, the permitted undertaking, according to the Corps, “extend[s] in either \ndirection from the crossing to that point at which alternative alignments leading to reasonable \nalternative locations for the crossing can be considered and evaluated.”  Id. § 1(g)(4)(ii).  For \nthese permitted actions, the district engineer must “encourage the consideration of historic \nproperties at the earliest practical time in [a] planning process” and engage in consultations with \ntribal leaders, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, and State Historic Preservation \nOfficers.  Id. § 2(e).  The regulations also specify when additional conditions should be placed \non a permit to “avoid or reduce” effects to these properties.  Id. § 10(a). \nC.  Rivers and Harbors Act \nThe RHA forbids certain construction activities within the “navigable water of the United \nStates” without prior permission from the Corps.  See 33 U.S.C. § 403.  The Corps often relies \non NWP 12 to discharge this duty for pipeline construction having only a minimal impact on \nregulated waters, 33 C.F.R. § 322.3(a), and the same general CWA conditions apply here.  Lake \nOahe is one of the waterways that falls under the jurisdiction of this Act. \n* * * \n  To sum up, the NHPA requires that the Corps, prior to issuing a permit under the CWA \nor the RHA, consider the potential effect of that permitted activity on places of cultural or \nreligious significance to Indian tribes. \nD.  Factual History  \nThe Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is a federally recognized American Indian Tribe with a \nreservation spanning the border between North and South Dakota.  See ECF No. 1 (Complaint), \n¶ 1.  The sweep of the Tribe’s historic and cultural connection to the Great Plains, however, \n11 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 12 of 58\nextends beyond these modern reservation boundaries.  Id., ¶¶ 7-8.  A successor to the Great \nSioux Nation, the Tribe’s ancestors once lived, loved, worshipped, and mourned “[w]herever the \nbuffalo roamed.”  ECF No. 6-2 (Declaration of Jon Eagle, Sr.), ¶ 24.  These people created stone \nalignments, burial cairns, and other rock features throughout the area to conduct important \nspiritual rituals related to the rhythms of their daily life.  See ECF No. 14-1 (Declaration of Tim \nMentz, Sr.), ¶ 3; Eagle Decl., ¶¶ 20, 25.  Along the region’s waterways in particular, the \nprevalence of these artifacts reflects water’s sacred role in their deeply held spiritual beliefs.  See \nEagle Decl., ¶ 25.  Today, the Standing Rock Sioux continue to honor these practices and cherish \nthe connection they have to their ancestors through these sites.  Id. \nOne place of particular significance to the Tribe lies at the traditional confluence of the \nMissouri and Cannonball Rivers.  Id., ¶¶ 11-12; ECF No. 6-1 (Declaration of Dave Archambault \nII), ¶ 12.  The ancestors to the Standing Rock Sioux gathered in this location to peacefully trade \nwith other tribes.  See Mentz Decl., ¶ 36.  They also considered the perfectly round stones \nshaped by the meeting of these two great rivers to be sacred.  See Eagle Decl., ¶ 11.  Mighty \nnatural forces, however, no longer hone these stones.  Id.  In 1958, the Corps dredged and altered \nthe course of the Cannonball River to construct a dam.  Id.  As a result, a large man-made lake \nknown as Lake Oahe now covers the confluence.  Id.   \nThe Tribe nevertheless continues to use the banks of the Missouri River for spiritual \nceremonies, and the River, as well as Lake Oahe, plays an integral role in the life and recreation \nof those living on the reservation.  Id.  Naturally, then, the Tribe was troubled to learn in late \n2014 that a new pipeline was being planned that would cross the Missouri River under Lake \nOahe about a half-mile north of the reservation.  See Archambault Decl., ¶¶ 8-12.  This was, of \n12 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 13 of 58\ncourse, DAPL – a 1,172-mile crude-oil pipeline poised to wind its way from the Bakken oil \nfields near Stanley, North Dakota, to refineries and terminals in Patoka, Illinois.   \nThe conflict that has arisen since this revelation is, to say the least, factually complex.  To \nease digestion of the relevant information, the Court first describes how Dakota Access chose the \npipeline route.  It then lays out the facts surrounding the Corps’ permitting and concurrent \nSection 106 process for the project.  These following summaries admittedly contain significant \ndetail and may try the reader’s patience.  The Court nonetheless believes such a narrative is \nnecessary because a key question here is whether the Corps engaged in sufficient consultation \nwith the Tribe under Section 106.  \n1.  DAPL  \nIn the summer of 2014, Dakota Access crafted the route that brought DAPL to Standing \nRock’s doorstep.  See ECF No. 22, Exh. B (Declaration of Monica Howard), ¶¶ 2-3.  The plotted \ncourse almost exclusively tracked privately held lands and, in sensitive places like Lake Oahe, \nalready-existing utility lines.  As only 3% of the work needed to build the pipeline would ever \nrequire federal approval of any kind and only 1% of the pipeline was set to affect U.S. \nwaterways, the pipeline could proceed largely on the company’s timeline.   \nDakota Access nevertheless also prominently considered another factor in crafting its \nroute: the potential presence of historic properties.  Id.  Using past cultural surveys, the company \ndevised DAPL’s route to account for and avoid sites that had already been identified as \npotentially eligible for or listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Id., ¶¶ 2-4.  With \nthat path in hand, in July 2014, the company purchased rights to a 400-foot corridor along its \npreliminary route to conduct extensive new cultural surveys of its own.  Id., ¶ 3.  These surveys \neventually covered the entire length of the pipeline in North and South Dakota, and much of \n13 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 14 of 58\nIowa and Illinois.  Id., ¶ 8.  Professionally licensed archaeologists conducted Class II cultural \nsurveys, which are “focused on visual reconnaissance of the ground surface in settings with high \nground visibility.”  Id.  In some places, however, the same archaeologists carried out more \nintensive Class III cultural surveys, which involve a “comprehensive archaeological survey \nprogram” requiring both surface visual inspection and shovel-test probes of fixed grids to \n“inventory, delineate, and assess” historic sites.  Id.  These latter surveys required coordination \nwith and approval by State Historic Preservation Officers.  Id. \nWhere this surveying revealed previously unidentified historic or cultural resources that \nmight be affected, the company mostly chose to reroute.  Id., ¶¶ 4-6.  In North Dakota, for \nexample, the cultural surveys found 149 potentially eligible sites, 91 of which had stone features.  \nId., ¶ 5.  The pipeline workspace and route was modified to avoid all 91 of these stone features \nand all but 9 of the other potentially eligible sites.  Id.  By the time the company finally settled on \na construction path, then, the pipeline route had been modified 140 times in North Dakota alone \nto avoid potential cultural resources.  Id., ¶ 6.  Plans had also been put in place to mitigate any \neffects on the other 9 sites through coordination with the North Dakota SHPO.  Id., ¶ 13.  All \ntold, the company surveyed nearly twice as many miles in North Dakota as the 357 miles that \nwould eventually be used for the pipeline.  Id., ¶ 12. \nThe company also opted to build its new pipeline along well-trodden ground wherever \nfeasible.  See ECF No. 22-1 (Declaration of Joey Mahmoud), ¶¶ 18, 24, 40.  Around Lake Oahe, \nfor example, the pipeline will track both the Northern Border Gas Pipeline, which was placed \ninto service in 1982, and an existing overhead utility line.  Id., ¶ 18.  In fact, where it crosses \nLake Oahe, DAPL is 100% adjacent to, and within 22 to 300 feet from, the existing pipeline.  Id.  \nDakota Access chose this route because these locations had “been disturbed in the past – both \n14 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 15 of 58\nabove and below ground level – making it a ‘brownfield crossing location.’”  Id., ¶ 19.  This \nmade it less likely, then, that new ground disturbances would harm intact cultural or tribal \nfeatures.  Id.  \nAround the time the cultural survey work began, Dakota Access took its plan public.  See \nHoward Decl., ¶ 12.  On September 30, 2014, it met with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribal \nCouncil to present the pipeline project as part of a larger community-outreach effort.  Id., ¶ 22.  \nPersonnel from Dakota Access also spoke with the Tribe’s Historic Preservation Officer \n(THPO), Waste’ Win Young, several times over the course of the next month.  Id., ¶¶ 23-27.  At \none related meeting, a DAPL archaeologist answered questions about the proposed survey work \nand invited input from Young on any areas that might be of particular tribal interest.  Id., ¶¶ 25-\n28.  The company agreed as well to send the centerline files from its cultural survey to her for \nreview, and did so on November 13.  Id., ¶ 28.  It never received any response from Young.  Id.   \n2.  Entry of Corps \nBased on the current record, the Corps appears to have had little involvement in Dakota \nAccess’s early planning.  The one exception is a June 2014 meeting between the two parties to \ndiscuss the company’s plan to build a pipeline through the region.  See ECF No. 21-18 \n(Declaration of Martha Chieply), ¶ 8.  At this meeting, the Corps informed the company about its \npermitting requirements and explained the importance of tribal coordination for any actions \ntaken under its jurisdiction.  Id.  There is no indication that the company sought to secure any \npermitting or that it presented the Corps with a specific proposed route for DAPL at this time.  \nId.  This conclusion is consistent with the record evidence that Dakota Access was still buying \nup the necessary right-of-ways for the pipeline surveys in July 2014.  See Howard Decl., ¶ 3; \nMahmoud Decl., ¶ 40. \n15 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 16 of 58\nThe writing was on the wall, however, that many DAPL permitting requests would \neventually land in the Corps inbox.  The Corps’ Tribal Liaison, Joel Ames, accordingly, tried to \nset up a meeting with THPO Young beginning around September 17, 2014, without success.  See \nECF No. 21-17 (Declaration of Joel Ames), ¶¶ 5-6; see also ECF No. 21, Exh. 9 (Corps Tribal \nConsultation Spreadsheet) at 1 (documenting five attempts by Ames to coordinate a meeting \nwith Young in September 2014).  On October 2, other Corps personnel also sought to hold an \narranged meeting with the Tribal Council and Dakota Access on the Standing Rock reservation.  \nSee Chieply Decl., ¶ 9.  But when the Corps timely arrived for the meeting, Tribal Chairman \nDavid Archambault told them that the conclave had started earlier than planned and had already \nended.  Id.  Ames nevertheless continued to reach out to Young to try to schedule another \nmeeting throughout the month of October.  See Ames Decl., ¶¶ 5-6.  When the new meeting was \nfinally held at the reservation on November 6, though, DAPL was taken off the agenda because \nYoung did not attend.  Id., ¶ 7.   \n3.  Soil-Bore Testing at Lake Oahe \nThe Corps’ North Dakota office also received the first request for DAPL permitting \naround this time and launched a formal NHPA Section 106 consultation as a result.  See ECF \nNo. 21-19 (Declaration of Richard Harnois), ¶ 5.  This solitary preconstruction request from \nDakota Access sought permitting only to conduct preliminary soil-bore testing at the Lake Oahe \nsite, not to actually begin any construction.  Id., ¶ 12.  Dakota Access needed to conduct these \ntests to determine whether it could subsequently use its preferred method of Horizontal \nDirectional Drilling at the crossing.  Id.  HDD – which the company plans to use on all land \nsubject to the RHA or owned by the Corps – allows for “construction across a sensitive area \nwithout excavation of a trench by installing the pipeline through a drilled hole significantly \n16 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 17 of 58\nbelow the conventional depth of a pipeline.”  Howard Decl., ¶ 7.  This particular test involved \ndrilling just seven holes of 4-inch diameter with an estimated 10 feet of impact on areas around \nthe holes.  See Harnois Decl., Exhs. 1-2.  Access to and from the sites, moreover, would take \nplace on existing roads.  Id.   \nAs a first cut, the Corps reviewed extensive existing cultural surveys both within and \noutside the Lake Oahe project area to determine whether the work might affect cultural \nresources.  Id.  Then, on October 24, the Corps sent out a letter to tribes, including the Standing \nRock Sioux, with information about the proposed work and maps documenting the known \ncultural sites that the Corps had already identified.  Id., ¶ 6; see id., Exh. 1.  These included sites \nthat the Corps considered to be outside the projected area of effect.  Id., ¶ 6.  In addition, the \nletter requested that any party interested in consulting on the matter reply within thirty days.  Id.  \nNo response was received from the Tribe.  Id.  The Corps did receive responses from other tribes \nand the North Dakota SHPO, which it considered.  Id., ¶ 7.  After granting an extra three weeks \nfor additional responses, on December 18 the Corps made an initial determination of “No \nHistoric Properties Affected” for the soil-bore testing.  Id., ¶¶ 7-11.   \nThe Corps mailed out this decision in a Determination of Effect letter to the North \nDakota SHPO and all affected tribes on the same day.  Id., ¶ 11.  The letter explained that the \nCorps had concluded that no historic properties would be affected by the tests and clarified that a \nprevious “not eligible” determination had already been made for a nearby site that would also not \nbe affected by the work.  Id.  The Corps also emailed Young again the next day to seek possible \ndates for a January 2015 meeting with the Tribe to discuss DAPL.  See Tribal Consultation Sheet \nat 1 (documenting email on December 19, 2014).  No response is in the record.  \n17 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 18 of 58\nOn February 12, 2015, having still heard nothing from the Tribe, Corps Senior Field \nArchaeologist Richard Harnois emailed Young again to solicit comments on the narrow issue of \nthe soil-bore testing.  See Harnois Decl., ¶¶ 13-14.  Again, no reply.  Id.  Around this same time, \nYoung informed the Corps’ Tribal Liaison, Ames, at an unrelated regulatory meeting that she did \nnot need to consult with the Corps at the moment as she was currently working directly with \nDakota Access.  See Ames Decl., ¶ 8; see also Tribal Consultation Sheet at 1 (documenting \ncontact).  As a result, on February 18, the Corps granted the PCN authorization under NWP 12 \nfor the limited exploratory soil-bore testing requested by Dakota Access.  See Harnois Decl., \n¶¶ 13-14.   \nAt this point, the Court should note that the Tribe has not provided a declaration from \nYoung about any of these early consultations (or lack thereof).  This omission is problematic for \nits cause because many of the facts relevant to the Tribe’s NHPA claim involve her.  As a result, \nthe rendition of the facts in the record is largely told through documentation and affidavits \nprovided by the Corps, with the exception of letters from Young provided by the Tribe. \nIn any event, several weeks later, on March 2, 2015, the Corps finally received a letter \nfrom Young expressing concerns over sites that might be affected by the bore testing.  Id., ¶ 15.  \nThe letter was dated on the same day that the Corps had green-lighted the work.  Id.  In \nparticular, Young mentioned the North Cannonball Village Site, which was almost a half-mile \nfrom the closest “area of potential effect” boundary set by the Corps.  Id.  The letter further \nrequested Class III and other cultural surveys under tribal monitoring before the testing, and \ntribal monitoring during both the testing and any later pipeline construction.  Id.  Young also sent \na similar letter on February 25 to the Corps’ Regulatory Branch Chief, Martha Chieply.  See ECF \nNo. 6, Exh. 6 (Letter from Young to Chieply on Feb. 25, 2015).   \n18 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 19 of 58\nNeither of these letters, contrary to representations made in the Tribe’s Motion, appears \nto be an “immediate[]” response to a February invitation by the Corps to consult on PCNs related \nto the actual pipeline construction.  See Mot. at 10; see also Letter from Young to Chieply (Feb. \n25, 2015).  Indeed, the letters make no mention of that February offer, focusing instead on the \nmore narrow issue of the soil-bore testing.  See Letter from Young to Chieply on Feb. 25, 2015.  \nOf course, as the Court has explained, the Corps had already permitted that limited testing under \nNWP 12 by the time Young sent the letters.  Ames nevertheless renewed his efforts to schedule a \nmeeting between Chairman Archambault and the Corps’ North Dakota District Commander, \nColonel Henderson, in response to Young’s letters, but the parties could not find a date when \nboth men were available to consult.  See Ames Decl., ¶ 9. \n4.  PCN Authorizations \nIn the meantime, Dakota Access initiated efforts on December 29, 2014, to secure five \nadditional PCN authorizations under NWP 12 for pipeline-construction work in North Dakota.  \nSee Chieply Decl., ¶ 10.  (Out of these, three were later withdrawn for various reasons.  Id.)  In \nthe application, the company provided a project description, a water- and wetland-delineation \nreport, and a cultural-survey report for areas around the PCN sites.  Id., Exh. 4 at 1, 8.  Dakota \nAccess also requested a jurisdictional determination from the Corps for the work.  Id., Exh. 4 at \n1.  On February 5, 2015, the Corps deemed the application incomplete and informed the \ncompany that it would require additional information before considering it.  Id., ¶ 11.  At this \ntime, the Corps also informed Dakota Access that one of the listed sites, PCN # 1, would not \nrequire Corps permitting because the involved waterway had previously been determined to be \nan isolated waterway not subject to the CWA or RHA.  Id., ¶¶ 10-11.  Dakota Access responded \nwith a complete application for the remaining PCNs on March 25.  See id., ¶ 13.  The Corps, \n19 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 20 of 58\naccordingly, sent a letter in relation to an environmental assessment (EA) for the project to the \nTribe and other parties on March 30.  See ECF No. 21-20 (Declaration of Jonathan Shelman), \n¶ 7.  This letter described the two proposed crossings at Lake Sakakawea and the proposed \ncrossing at Lake Oahe – i.e., the three North Dakota sites still thought to require PCNs at the \ntime – and solicited comments from the Tribe to be considered as part of the EA.  Id. \n While discussions between Dakota Access and the Corps were ongoing, the Corps also \nsent a form letter to Young on February 17, informing her that it was now considering 55 PCN \nrequests across its offices for DAPL.  See ECF No. 6, Exh. 5.  The letter went on to explain that \nthe majority of the pipeline work would occur in uplands that were not subject to Corps \njurisdiction, but the Corps would need to permit crossings at the Missouri, James, Big Sioux, Des \nMoines, Mississippi, and Illinois Rivers.  Id.  The letter, moreover, noted that Dakota Access was \nconducting cultural surveys along the entire route.  Id.  Finally, the Corps requested that the \nTribe let it “know if you have any knowledge or concerns regarding cultural resources . . . you \nwould like the Corps to consider” and asked whether it wanted to consult on the project.  Id.  A \nresponse was requested prior to March 30 “to help facilitate a timely Section 106 review.”  Id.  \nThe Corps also attached the current proposed alignment provided by Dakota Access for the \npipeline and contact information for various Corps staff involved in facilitating tribal \nconsultations.  Id.   \nOn the date of the deadline to respond, Ames and Young exchanged emails, but the \ncontent of this exchange is not in the record.  See Tribal Consultation Sheet at 8.  Young did, \nhowever, formally respond on April 8.  See ECF No. 6, Exh. 7.  In her response this time, she \nacknowledged receipt of the Corps’ February 17 letter about the 55 construction-related PCNs.  \nId. at 1.  But the thrust of her letter focused again on the Corps’ failure to respond, prior to \n20 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 21 of 58\npermitting the soil-bore testing, to the concerns she had raised about that work.  See id. at 1-2.  \nShe further expressed her belief that the Corps’ inaction violated the Section 106 process.  Id. at \n2.  She demanded that the Corps “clarify the proper sequencing of the Section 106 NHPA \nprocess” before proceeding with the EA, asserted that she had not yet been contacted by Ames, \nand described the placement of bore pits on private lands as an attempt to avoid federal \njurisdiction.  Id. at 2-3.  In conclusion, Young informed the Corps that the Tribe opposed “any \nkind of oil pipeline construction through our ancestral lands,” in part because the potential \ndredging would take place where “human remains of relatives of current . . . tribal members” \nwere present.  Id. at 3.  Young ultimately closed, though, by reiterating that the Tribe “look[ed] \nforward to participation in a full tribal consultation process” once it commenced.  Id.  On the \nsame day, Corps personnel and Standing Rock Archaeologist Dr. Kelly Morgan discussed future \npipeline realignments over the phone.  See Tribal Consultation Sheet at 7. \n5.  Summer of 2015 \nRelations between the Tribe and Corps did not improve in the summer of 2015.  Ames \nattempted to speak with Young about the project in June, but she informed him via email that she \nwas on an extended leave of absence until July 27.  Id. at 8; see Ames Decl., ¶ 9.  Ames was \nunable to determine whether anyone was empowered to act on the Tribe’s behalf in her absence.  \nSee Ames Decl., ¶ 9.  On July 22, Corps Operations Manager Eric Stasch also sent a letter to \nStanding Rock describing the planned use of HDD for the Oahe crossing.  See Harnois Decl., \n¶ 16; see also id., Exh. 3.  In his letter, Stasch provided details about the areas of potential effects \nand explained that the Corps would consider the work a federal undertaking despite its location \non private land.  See id., Exh. 3 at 1-2.  The letter went on to say that Dakota Access’s cultural \nsurveys had identified an additional cultural site within the proposed preparation and staging area \n21 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 22 of 58\nfor this work.  Id. at 2.  Finally, the letter requested a response within thirty days if the Tribe \nwished to consult on this particular crossing and indicated that consultations about other pipeline \ncrossings would happen separately.  Id. at 2-3.  Attached to the letter were current and previous \nsurvey information, as well as general and detailed project maps illustrating the location and \nnature of the Lake Oahe crossing and recorded cultural resources.  See Harnois Decl., ¶ 16.   \nIn August, the Tribe responded with two letters of its own.  See ECF No. 6, Exhs. 8 \n(Letter from Archambault to Cross on Aug. 19, 2015), 9 (Letter from Young to Stasch on Aug. \n21, 2015).  The first, sent on August 19 from Chairman Archambault to Colonel Cross – the \nCorps’ Commander and District Engineer for the Omaha District – described the Chairman’s \nfrustration in not being contacted earlier in regard to DAPL.  See Letter from Archambault to \nCross (Aug. 19, 2015).  Archambault invited Cross to the reservation to discuss the matter and \nprovided contact information for his administrative assistant to arrange the visit.  Id.  The very \nsame day, Ames emailed Archambault’s assistant in an attempt to schedule a meeting, but \nwithout success.  See Ames Decl., ¶ 10; see also Tribal Consultation Sheet at 8.  The second \nletter responded directly to Stasch’s offer to consult on the Lake Oahe crossing.  See Letter from \nYoung to Stasch (Aug. 21, 2015).  In it, Young again reiterated that the Section 106 consultation \nrun by the Corps had failed to respond to concerns raised by the Tribe in their February letters \nabout the soil-bore testing prior to the completion of that work.  Id.  She further expressed her \nfrustration in being excluded from the Dakota Access surveying despite company promises to \ninclude tribal monitors, and she reiterated her concern that sites might be overlooked or damaged \nunless the Standing Rock Sioux participated in surveying.  Id.  In closing, Young again said the \nTribe looked forward to participating in “future consultation prior to any work being completed . \n. . [and] to playing a primary role in any and all survey work and monitoring.”  Id. at 2.  \n22 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 23 of 58\nThe Corps responded in at least three ways to the Tribe over the next month.  First, on \nAugust 27, a Corps staff archaeologist started planning an onsite visit for the Corps, the Tribe, \nand the North Dakota SHPO to Lake Oahe.  See Harnois Decl, ¶ 18.  Second, the Corps’ District \nCommander, Colonel Henderson, wrote back to Chairman Archambault.  See ECF No. 6, Exh. \n10 (Letter from Henderson to Archambault on Sept. 3, 2015).  Most of Henderson’s letter \nreiterated the form offer to consult and other general project information, but the letter also \nacknowledged receipt of the Tribe’s recent letters and provided additional information about the \nrequested PCN locations.  Id. at 2.  Third, Stasch sent a letter on September 16, expressing his \nwillingness and desire to address the Tribe’s questions and concerns during the upcoming onsite \nvisit to Lake Oahe planned by the Corps.  See Harnois Decl., ¶ 22.   \nOn the same day as Stasch’s letter, Harnois also emailed Standing Rock Archaeologist \nMorgan to invite her to participate in the “working level, on-the-ground site visit of the proposed \nDAPL Oahe Crossing.”  Id., ¶ 23.  This sparked an email exchange between the two on logistics \nand dates.  Id.  The very next day, however, Morgan emailed the Corps to back out of the visit.  \nId., Exh. 4.  In an attached letter, she explained that “after careful consideration the [Standing \nRock] THPO has determined that it is in the best interest of the THPO to decline participation in \nthe site visits and walking the project corridor’s [area of projected effects] at this time until \ngovernment-to-government consultation has occurred for this project per Section 106 \nrequirements as requested by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.”  Id.  By this she seemed to mean \nthat the Corps needed to first hold the previously requested meeting between Chairman \nArchambault and Colonel Henderson.  Id.  Despite the Tribe’s withdrawal, the Corps ultimately \nproceeded to hold the onsite visit with the North Dakota SHPO.  See Harnois Decl., ¶ 26.   \n23 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 24 of 58\nAbout a week later, the Tribe sent another letter, this time from Young to Colonel \nHenderson.  See ECF No. 6, Exh. 11 (Letter from Young to Henderson on Sept. 28, 2015).  In \nthis letter, Young noted her concern “about the lack of consultation prior to the start of \narchaeological surveys.”  Id. at 1.  She further indicated that the Tribe had “received no \ncorrespondence prior to the soil bore hole testing,” which she then characterized as evidence that \n“the Corps is attempting to circumvent the Section 106 process.”  Id.  Citing the potential for \n“irreparable damage to . . . known sites,” she complained about the Tribe’s “exclusion of tribal \nparticipation up to this point” from the identification efforts and Section 106 process.  Id.  In \naddition, she indicated that the Tribe believed “the entire length of the DAPL [is] one project \nunder the . . . [RHA], as well as” the CWA, and that the Corps was trying to avoid \n“federalization.”  Id. at 2. \n6.  Fall of 2015 \nIn the fall, the Corps responded by redoubling its efforts to meet with the Tribe.  On \nSeptember 29, 2015, Ames, in a phone conversation with Chairman Archambault, scheduled a \nmeeting between the Corps and the Tribe’s Vice Chair for October 28.  See Ames Decl., ¶ 13.  \nBut two days before that meeting, the Tribe canceled “because nobody from the tribe was \navailable to attend.”  Id.  On the same day, the Tribe also canceled a meeting scheduled for \nNovember with Colonel Henderson, promising to meet with him instead “in a few months.”  Id., \n¶ 14.  The Corps, moreover, documented ten different attempts to contact the Tribe over the \ncourse of the October to speak about the project.  See Tribal Consultation Sheet at 14.   \nThen, in November, the Corps twice invited the Tribe to a general tribal meeting in Sioux \nFalls, South Dakota, scheduled for December 8 to 9.  See Chieply Decl., ¶ 17; see also id., Exh. \n10.  This invitation contained a link to the cultural surveys provided by Dakota Access.  Id.  Five \n24 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 25 of 58\ntribes attended this meeting.  Id., ¶ 18.  Standing Rock did not.  Id.  At the meeting, the Corps \nmade sure that the tribes had copies of the cultural surveys, and the group agreed to reconvene on \nJanuary 25, 2016, to discuss any issues they found with those surveys.  Id.  Around the time of \nthis meeting, the Corps also independently looked through these cultural surveys and other route \nmaps to determine whether any additional DAPL crossings might have the potential to affect \nhistoric properties.  See ECF No. 21-18, Exh. 16.  The Corps concluded that only the James \nRiver crossing (PCN #4) raised any concerns; no others triggered the need for a PCN under \nGeneral Condition 20.  Id. \nDuring this tribal gathering, Morgan sent a letter to the Corps, indicating that the Tribe \nwas “still interested in formal consultation on the proposed” pipeline despite its decision not to \nattend.  See ECF No. 6, Exh. 12 (Letter from Morgan to Chieply on Dec. 8, 2015) at 1.  The \nTribe yet again noted that it had not received a response from the Corps about the concerns it had \nraised in regard to the bore testing.  Id.  Morgan also protested that the testing should not proceed \nprior to mitigation efforts and indicated that the Tribe did not concur in the “no effects” \ndetermination for this work.  Id. at 2.  This, of course, makes little sense given that Young had \nalready acknowledged in previous letters from the Tribe that they were aware the soil-bore \ntesting had already taken place back in the spring.  See, e.g., Letter from Young to Henderson on \nSept. 28, 2015 (recognizing “soil bore testing has already occurred despite our initial \ncorrespondence”).  In any event, Morgan further indicated that the Tribe looked forward to \nplaying a primary role in any surveying or monitoring and explained that it would refuse to \nparticipate in tribal meetings until Colonel Henderson came to their reservation to meet with \nthem first.  Letter from Morgan to Chieply (Dec. 8, 2015) at 1.  Finally, she informed the Corps \n25 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 26 of 58\nthat the Tribe thought the draft EA could not be issued prior to a full cultural-resources survey.  \nId. at 2. \nAgain, the Corps appears to have taken action in response to the Tribe’s demands.  \nHenderson ordered Omaha District Deputy Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Michael D. Sexton \nto attempt to schedule a meeting with Plaintiff for him.  See Ames Decl., ¶ 17.  He did so in \nresponse to the setbacks experienced by Ames in attempting to secure the same over the previous \nmonths.  Id.  The Tribe, however, never returned Sexton’s calls about scheduling a meeting \neither, and Young subsequently left her position with the Standing Rock Sioux.  Id.  \nOn December 8, the Corps released a draft EA for the project, which contained a request \nfor comment by January 8, 2016.  See Shelman Decl., ¶ 8.  In the portion of the EA describing \nthe Section 106 process, the draft explained that consultations began in November 2014 for \ninitial geotechnical explorations, which then closed in January 2015.  See ECF No. 6, Exh. 13 \n(Draft EA, Nov. 2015) at 58.  The draft next described the ongoing process, starting in July 2015, \nfor consultation related to the actual pipeline construction.  Id.  In so doing, it acknowledged the \nCorps’ failure to secure onsite visits or government-to-government meetings to date.  Id. at 58-\n59.  In the very next section, the EA indicated that Young had said in the October 2014 meeting \nwith Dakota Access that the Lake Oahe HDD process “appeared to avoid impacts to known sites \nof tribal significance.”  Id. at 59.   \n7.  2016 \nThe Tribe provided timely and extensive comments to the draft EA in letters on January 8 \nand March 24, 2016.  See ECF No. 6, Exh. 14 (Standing Rock Comments on Draft EA); id., Exh. \n15 (Standing Rock Supplemental Comments).  In these comments, Archambault asserted that the \nCorps had failed to consult on the identification of cultural sites important to the Tribe.  See \n26 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 27 of 58\nStanding Rock Comments on Draft EA at 2-3; see also id. at 4 (asserting Corps violated its own \npolicy to hold “an active and respectful dialogue. . . before decisions are made and actions are \ntaken”); id. (claiming bore testing violated NHPA because Corps did not include Tribe in \ndecisionmaking process); id. at 6 (noting Corps reliance on old surveys conducted before 1992 \nAmendments to NHPA).  He explained the importance of such consultations by, in part, \ndescribing tribal “oral traditions and historical records” that recorded the presence of known sites \nand burials in the direct path of the pipeline.  Id. (counting “at least 350 known sites within the \nproject corridor in North Dakota alone”); see also id. at 4 (indicating that Draft EA \nmisrepresented Tribe’s position in October 2014 meeting thanks to false impression from Dakota \nAccess).  As a result, he concluded that those outside the Tribe could not properly identify these \nsites.  Id.  He additionally criticized the 400-foot corridor used for the Dakota Access surveys as \ntoo narrow and described the “no effects” determination by the Corps for sites within the \ncorridor as lacking “scientific or engineering support.”  Id. at 7-8.  Archambault, in his later \nsupplemental comments, again stressed the importance of tribal participation in the identification \nof historic properties and, accordingly, decisions about potential alternative routes for the \npipeline.  See Standing Rock Supplemental Comments at 23-24.  He also cited the Advisory \nCouncil’s Section 106 regulations and case law to support his assertion that form letters and \npublic meetings could not meet the Corps’ obligations under the NHPA to consult with the \ntribes.  Id.  In conclusion, he implored the Corps to assure that full cultural surveys would be \ndone, with tribal input, on the entire pipeline.  Id. at 28-29.  Two other tribes also indicated at \nthis time that they thought they had not yet been fully consulted on the potential effects of the \npipeline.  See ECF No. 6, Exhs. 22-24. \n27 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 28 of 58\nThe Section 106 process between the Corps and Tribe finally picked up steam in the \nspring of 2016.  From January to May, there were no fewer than seven meetings between the two \nentities.  On January 22, Corps Senior Archaeologist Harnois met at the reservation with \nChairman Archambault; the Tribe’s new THPO Ron His Horse is Thunder; Morgan; and the \nTribe’s Section 106 Coordinator, LaDonna Brave Bull Allard.  See Harnois Decl., ¶ 27.  Three \ndays later, on January 25, the Tribe participated in the follow-on tribal meeting to discuss the \nDakota Access cultural surveys.  See Chieply Decl., ¶ 21.  Next, on March 3, Corps staff held a \nmeeting with the Tribe at Corps headquarters.  See Ames Decl., ¶ 29.  Perhaps most \nsignificantly, Morgan met with the Corps to express specific concerns about tribal burial sites at \nthe James River crossing (PCN # 4).  See Harnois Decl., ¶ 24.  Based on the information she \nprovided, the Corps verified the presence of cultural resources at the site and successfully \ninstructed Dakota Access to move the pipeline alignment to avoid them.  Id. \nColonel Henderson also attended several meetings with the Tribe.  He first officiated at a \nthird tribal summit on February 18-19, again with Standing Rock participation.  See Chieply \nDecl., ¶ 22.  Then, he attended meetings with Standing Rock on February 26, April 29, and May \n14.  See Ames Decl., ¶¶ 26, 33, 36.  Through these conversations, Henderson committed the \nCorps to imposing several additional conditions on DAPL, such as double-walled piping, in \nresponse to tribal concerns about environmental safety.  Id., ¶ 27.  One of these summits also \nincluded an onsite visit to the Lake Oahe crossing.  See Harnois Decl., ¶ 28; see also \nArchambault Decl., ¶ 19.  During that visit, Chairman Archambault “pointed out areas of \nconcern and explained the tribe’s issues with the pipeline project.”  Harnois Decl., ¶ 28.  Indeed, \nin March, Archambault acknowledged that the Corps had recently made strides toward righting \nthe Section 106 ship and indicated he felt this particular onsite visit was productive at identifying \n28 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 29 of 58\nnew stones, graves, burial sites, and earthen lodges that needed to be considered by the Corps.  \nSee Supplemental Comments on Draft EA at 26-27.  Henderson and Archambault exchanged \nletters about the project throughout the spring as well.  Id., ¶ 30.   \nThe improved relationship, however, had its limits.  In the spring, the Corps worked with \nDakota Access to offer consulting tribes an opportunity to conduct cultural surveys at PCN \nlocations where the private landowner would permit them.  See Chieply Decl., ¶ 28.  This \nincluded 7 of the 11 sites in North and South Dakota.  Id.  Three tribes took the opportunity, and \nit paid off.  See ECF No. 22, Exh. C (Declaration of Michelle Dippel)  ¶ 28.  The Upper Sioux \nCommunity identified areas of tribal concern at three PCN sites, and Dakota Access agreed to \nadditional avoidance measures at all of them.  Id.  At one of these sites, the tribal surveyors and \nthe Iowa SHPO declared a site eligible for listing on the National Registry that had not \npreviously been identified on Dakota Access’s surveys.  See Eagle Decl., ¶¶ 32-36; see also \nMentz Decl., ¶¶ 38-39 (describing his hiring to conduct surveys for the Upper Sioux).  Dakota \nAccess agreed in response to this discovery to bury the pipeline 111 feet below the site to avoid \ndisturbing it.  See Mot. Hearing Trans. at 36.  Similarly, the Osage Tribe identified areas through \ntheir surveys that they wished to monitor during construction, and the company granted that \nrequest too.  Id. \nStanding Rock took a different tack.  The Tribe declined to participate in the surveys \nbecause of their limited scope.  See Chieply Decl., ¶ 29.  Instead, it urged the Corps to redefine \nthe area of potential effect to include the entire pipeline and asserted that it would send no \nexperts to help identify cultural resources until this occurred.  Id.  In a responsive email, the \nCorps expressed its regret that the Tribe would not participate and welcomed any knowledge or \ninformation regarding historic properties that it was still willing to provide.  Id.  The Corps went \n29 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 30 of 58\non to explain that it did not “regulate or oversee the construction of pipelines, and [its] regulatory \ncontrol is limited to only a small portion of the land and waterways that the pipeline traverses.”  \nId., Exh. 14.  While the Corps’ regulations allowed it to consider uplands outside “waters of the \nUnited States,” the email asserted that work in these areas had to be “directly associated [with], \nintegrally related [to],” and caused by the “in-water authorized activity” before the Corps could \nclaim authority over it.  Id.  \nThe Tribe did engage in two more visits to Lake Oahe with the Corps around this time.  \nSee Eagle Decl., ¶¶ 13-14; Harnois Decl., ¶ 29.  First, on March 8, Morgan and the Tribe’s latest \nTHPO, Jon Eagle, identified areas of potential cultural significance to the Corps and described \nthe area’s sacred importance to the Standing Rock people.  See Harnois Decl., ¶ 29.  Several of \nthe sites they identified were in areas that the Corps had determined were well outside the area of \npotential impact for the project, such as a cemetery approximately 1.2 miles from the nearest \nbore pit and .6 miles from the HDD preparation and construction area.  Id.  The group also \ntoured the Cannonball Village site.  Id.  At this site, Morgan and Eagle pointed out places in the \nmole dirt where “pottery shards, pieces of bone, flint and tools used for scraping hides and \ncutting” were visible.  See Eagle Decl., ¶ 14.  Eagle, in addition, pointed out a sacred stone in the \narea that is still used for prayer.  Id., ¶ 15.  During the visit, Corps staff acknowledged that they \nhad been previously unaware of some of these cultural resources and committed to further study \nof them.  Id., ¶ 14.  Morgan and Harnois thereafter exchanged several follow-up emails to \ndiscuss the Tribe’s “concerns and questions” generated by the onsite visit.  See Harnois Decl., \n¶¶ 30-31.  The Corps nevertheless ultimately determined that the Cannonball Village site was not \nin the area that would be affected by DAPL-related construction work.  Id., ¶ 29.   \n30 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 31 of 58\nThe second onsite visit occurred on March 22 and went much the same as the first.  Id., \n¶ 32.  This time, however, Morgan asked questions about the surveying that had been done on \nthe area as part of the Northern Borderline Pipeline project – a pre-existing natural-gas pipeline \ninstalled under Lake Oahe that runs parallel to DAPL’s proposed course.  Id.  Harnois continued \ndiscussions with her about the adequacy of the mapping and considered requiring additional \ntesting on the site.  Id.  Ultimately, however, Harnois determined that additional testing would \nnot be necessary based on his later review of the site documentation and research.  Id. \nThe Corps then sought to end the Section 106 process for the Lake Oahe crossing.  On \nApril 22, Harnois made a Determination of Effect for the site and emailed it to the consulting \nparties.  Id., ¶ 33; see also ECF No. 6, Exh. 43.  In it, Harnois described the project, explained \nthe location, and discussed data on 41 potential historic sites in detail.  Id.  He concluded that one \nof the sites identified, 32MOx0570, was “not eligible” for listing and that the project overall had \n“no historic properties subject to effect.”  Id.  Four days later, the North Dakota SHPO concurred \nwith his determination via email.  See Harnois Decl., ¶ 34.  Harnois then notified the Tribe of \nthis concurrence.  Id., ¶ 35.  Both Chairman Archambault and Eagle formally objected to the \ndetermination.  See ECF No. 6, Exh. 30 at 2 (“To date, none of our request for consultation or \nClass III Cultural Surveys has been honored.”); id., Exh. 31.  As a result, the Tribe and Corps \ncontinued their dialogue on these issues.  See Ames Decl., ¶ 36; Chieply Decl., ¶¶ 32, 35 \n(describing Corps response to these objections).  \nThe Advisory Council – the agency responsible for commenting on NHPA compliance \nfor federal undertakings – also sent the Corps a series of letters about the adequacy of the Section \n106 process around this time.  After the Corps published the draft EA, the Advisory Council \nrequested verification from the Corps of its consultation efforts and relayed concerns expressed \n31 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 32 of 58\nto them by Archambault about the consultations (or lack thereof) that had occurred to date with \nStanding Rock.  See ECF No. 6, Exh. 20 (Advisory Council Comment on Draft EA) at 2.  The \nAdvisory Council formally entered the Section 106 consultation process for DAPL soon \nthereafter.  See Chieply Decl., ¶ 27.  Then, in March, the Advisory Council wrote to express its \nskepticism about the Corps’ determination that the entire pipeline was not subject to its \njurisdiction.  See ECF No. 6, Exh. 25 (Letter from Advisory Council to Henderson on Mar. 15, \n2016).  In particular, the Advisory Council felt that the PCNs required for various portions of the \npipeline transformed the entire pipeline into an undertaking.  Id.  In addition, the Advisory \nCouncil described itself as “perplexed by the Corps’ apparent difficulties in consulting” with \nStanding Rock.  Id.  Again, on May 6, the Advisory Council wrote with additional questions \nrelating to the DAPL permit area, tribal consultations, and federal-agency coordination.  See \nECF No. 6, Exh. 26.  The Advisory Council also formally objected to the Corps determination of \n“no effects,” citing numerous deficiencies in the Section 106 process, including the failure of the \nCorps to properly define the scope of its responsibilities.  See ECF No. 6, Exh. 32.  Finally, on \nJune 2, the Advisory Council requested that the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, \nJo-Ellen Darcy, review that “no effects” determination.  See Chieply Decl., ¶ 32.  \nThe Corps responded to these letters with several of its own.  On May 13, Henderson \nwrote to reiterate that the Corps could not exercise control over portions of the project not \nsubject to its jurisdiction.  See id.; see also id., Exh. 15.  In his letter, Henderson contested the \nAdvisory Council’s conclusion that the permitted activity determined the entire right-of-way for \nthe pipeline, instead contending that the crossing of jurisdictional waters did not ultimately \ncontrol project alignment elsewhere.  Id.  He further explained that the use of HDD in many \nplaces would avoid Corps jurisdiction altogether by eliminating any discharge of dredge or fill \n32 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 33 of 58\nmaterials into regulated waters.  Id.  On June 30, the Assistant Secretary of the Army also \nreplied.  See Chieply Decl, ¶ 38; see also ECF No. 6, Exh. 39.  In her letter, she reiterated the \nCorps’ position on its own jurisdiction, asserted tribes were notified and invited to participate \nand provide information, and contested the Advisory Council’s claim that field visits had \nidentified the presence of new areas within the APE for the project.  Id. \nThe Corps then moved to close the book on the matter.  On July 25, 2016, it issued an EA \nfinding of “no significant impact” and verified all 204 PCN locations under NWP 12.  See ECF \nNo. 6, Exhs. 33-36; Ames Decl., ¶ 36.  The PCNs, however, contained additional restrictions.  \nSee ECF No. 6, Exhs. 33-36.  Most importantly, they instituted a “Tribal Monitoring Plan” that \nrequires Dakota Access to allow tribal monitors at all PCN sites when construction is occurring.  \nId.  Dakota Access immediately notified the tribes of its intent to begin construction at the PCN \nsites within five to seven days.  See ECF No. 6, Exh. 49 (Letter from Dippel to Upper Sioux).   \n* * * \n  In summary, the Corps has documented dozens of attempts it made to consult with the \nStanding Rock Sioux from the fall of 2014 through the spring of 2016 on the permitted DAPL \nactivities.  These included at least three site visits to the Lake Oahe crossing to assess any \npotential effects on historic properties and four meetings with Colonel Henderson.   \nE.  Procedural History and Recent Activities \nTwo days after the Corps issued the PCN authorizations, Standing Rock filed this suit \nagainst it under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq., asserting in part that \nthe Corps had violated its obligation under the NHPA prior to issuing the permitting for DAPL-\nrelated construction along the entire pipeline route.  The Tribe then filed, on August 4, 2016, this \nMotion for Preliminary Injunction to mandate a withdrawal of this permitting.  The next day, \n33 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 34 of 58\nDakota Access intervened in the action in support of the Corps.  See ECF No. 7 (Dakota Access \nMotion to Intervene).  The Court subsequently permitted intervention by the Cheyenne River \nSioux Tribe on Plaintiff’s side, though it did not participate in this Motion.  After a scheduling \nconference on August 8, the Court ordered an expedited briefing schedule and set a hearing on \nthe Motion for August 24. \nAt the Motion hearing, Dakota Access revealed that most of the construction associated \nwith DAPL is, in fact, already complete.  Because only 3% of the pipeline is subject to federal \npermitting, Dakota Access has always been free to proceed with the vast majority of the \nconstruction, which will occur on private land.  In fact, 48% of the pipeline had already been \ncleared, graded, trenched, piped, backfilled, and reclaimed.  See Mot. Hearing Trans. at 24.  The \ncompany also moved fast elsewhere; this figure included all but 11 of the 204 sites that the Corps \nhad subjected to PCN authorization.  Id. at 25.  All of the necessary clearing and grading has also \nbeen done in South Dakota, and 90% of it is complete in North Dakota.  Id. at 24.  One of the \nfew exceptions is the crossing leading up to the west side of Lake Oahe, which has not yet been \ncleared or graded.   \nThe tribal monitoring and GC 21 unexpected-discovery protocols also appeared to be in \nplace for the activity that was permitted by the Corps.  Id. at 37-39.  When construction is \nongoing for such activities, Dakota Access allows archaeological and tribal monitors onsite to \nlook for evidence of cultural or historic resources.  Id.  As of the hearing, construction had \ntriggered the unexpected-discovery protocol six times.  Id. at 39.  In each case, construction \nstopped until the state, federal, and tribal representatives confirmed that the resources were not \nbeing damaged.  Id.  Each one turned out to be a false alarm.  Id.  At the conclusion of the \nhearing, the Court informed the parties that it would issue its decision on September 9, two \n34 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 35 of 58\nweeks being necessary to adequately review the voluminous record and draft this lengthy \nOpinion.  \nNine days after the hearing, on Friday, September 2, the Tribe filed a supplemental \ndeclaration by Tim Mentz, the Tribe’s former Tribal Historic Preservation Officer and a member \nof the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.  See ECF No. 29-1 (Supplemental Declaration of Tim Mentz, \nSr.).  In the declaration, Mentz explained that he had been invited by a landowner to conduct \ncultural surveys on private land along the DAPL route that had already been cleared for pipeline \nconstruction.  See id., ¶¶ 2-3; see also id., Exh. 1.  This land was about 1.75 miles from the \nconstruction activity that the Corps has actually permitted at Lake Oahe.  Id., ¶ 3.  In other \nwords, the area in question was entirely outside the Corps’ jurisdiction.  The construction activity \non it, as a result, never required a federal permit, and neither the Corps nor any other federal \nagency had any control over it.  Because these activities do not require a federal permit, they are \nalso not necessarily subject to the attendant restrictions to protect historic properties – i.e., GC 21 \nand tribal monitoring – placed by the Corps on the activities that it did permit.   \nMentz, over the course of several days beginning on August 30, avers that he surveyed \nthis private land around the pipeline right-of-way.  Id., ¶ 6.  During these surveys, he observed \nseveral rock cairns and other sites of cultural significance inside the 150-foot corridor staked for \nDAPL construction.  Id., ¶¶ 7-11.  He was, however, confined in his actual surveying to those \nareas immediately adjacent to the pipeline right-of-way and did not enter the corridor itself.  \nId.  Mentz documented the presence of several sites that he believed to be of great cultural note \nnearby, including a stone constellation used to mark the burial site of a very important tribal \nleader about 75 feet from the pipeline corridor.  Id., ¶ 10.  Mentz did not observe any fencing or \nother protective measures around these sites.  Id., ¶ 9.  He also observed what he believed to be \n35 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 36 of 58\nimportant stone features within the pipeline corridor.  Id., ¶ 11.  According to Mentz, none of \nthese sites was documented on the earlier cultural surveys of the area commissioned by Dakota \nAccess.  Id., ¶ 17.   \nThe next day, on Saturday, September 3, Dakota Access graded this area.  See ECF No. \n30 (Emergency Motion for Temporary Restraining Order).  On September 4, both the Tribe and \nthe Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe filed for a Temporary Restraining Order on any additional \nconstruction work at the site described by Mentz – i.e., the length of the pipeline route for \napproximately two miles west of Highway 1806 in North Dakota – and for any additional \nconstruction work on the pipeline within 20 miles on either side of Lake Oahe, until the Court \nruled on this Motion for Preliminary Injunction.  Id.  The Corps responded that it would not \noppose the restraining order while awaiting this decision. \nDakota Access, not surprisingly, hotly contested Mentz’s version of events in its \nopposition to the TRO motion.  In a map of the area, the company sought to demonstrate that \nmany of the sites documented by Mentz were in fact well outside the pipeline route.  See ECF \nNo. 34 (Response to TRO) at 6-8.  The rest, according to Dakota Access, were directly over the \nexisting Northern Border Natural Gas Pipeline that runs through the area and thus could not have \nbeen historic artifacts.  Id. at 6.  The company instead alleges that the route of the pipeline in this \narea proves its point: it twists and turns to avoid the finds that Mentz documented adjacent to the \npipeline and thus demonstrates that Dakota Access did purposefully shift the route to avoid any \nsites of cultural significance in its planning phase.  Id.  The Court acknowledges that the map \nprovided by the company does seem to indicate that the pipeline curves to accommodate the \ncultural sites.  Id. at 7.   \n36 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 37 of 58\nThis Court held a TRO hearing on September 6, the first business day after that motion \nwas filed.  Without making factual determinations about the truth of Mentz’s observations, the \nCourt was able to obtain Dakota Access’s agreement not to perform any construction activities \nwithin 20 miles east of Lake Oahe and within about two miles west of the Lake, as it had already \nceased such operations while awaiting the Court’s preliminary-injunction ruling.  The Court \notherwise denied the TRO.  This current Opinion now issues on a highly expedited basis. \nII.  Legal Standard \n“[I]njunctive relief” is “an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear \nshowing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.”  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Advisory Council, \nInc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008).  “A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish [1] that \nhe is likely to succeed on the merits, [2] that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence \nof preliminary relief, [3] that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and [4] that an injunction is \nin the public interest.”  Id. at 20.  Before the Supreme Court’s decision in Winter, courts weighed \nthe preliminary-injunction factors on a sliding scale, allowing a weak showing on one factor to \nbe overcome by a strong showing on another factor.  See, e.g., Davenport v. Int’l Bhd. of \nTeamsters, 166 F.3d 356, 360-61 (D.C. Cir. 1999).  This Circuit, however, has suggested, \nwithout deciding, that Winter should be read to abandon the sliding-scale analysis in favor of a \n“more demanding burden” requiring plaintiffs to independently demonstrate both a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits and irreparable harm.  See Sherley v. Sebelius, 644 F.3d 388, 392-93 (D.C. \nCir. 2011); Davis v. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp., 571 F.3d 1288, 1292 (D.C. Cir. 2009).   \nWhether a sliding-scale analysis still exists or not, courts in our Circuit have held that “if \na party makes no showing of irreparable injury, the court may deny the motion for injunctive \nrelief without considering the other factors.”  Dodd v. Fleming, 223 F. Supp. 2d 15, 20 (D.D.C. \n37 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 38 of 58\n2002) (citing CityFed Fin. Corp. v. Office of Thrift Supervision, 58 F.3d 738, 747 (D.C. Cir. \n1995)).  Likewise, a failure to show a likelihood of success on the merits alone is sufficient to \ndefeat a preliminary-injunction motion.  Ark. Dairy Co-op Ass’n, Inc. v. USDA, 573 F.3d 815, \n832 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (citing Apotex, Inc. v. FDA, 449 F.3d 1249, 1253 (D.C. Cir. 2006)).  It \nfollows, then, that the Court may deny a motion for preliminary injunction, without further \ninquiry, upon finding that a plaintiff is unable to show either irreparable injury or a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits.  Here, Standing Rock fails on both grounds. \nIII.  Analysis  \nThe Corps gave the go-ahead, under NWP 12, for DAPL’s construction activities in \nfederally regulated waters at hundreds of discrete places along its nearly 1,200-mile route.  In \nseeking a preliminary injunction, the Tribe contends that the Corps, in doing so, shirked its \nresponsibility to first engage in the tribal consultations required by the NHPA.  Because DAPL \nconstruction is ongoing, the Tribe further asserts that sites of great significance will likely be \ndamaged or destroyed unless this Court pumps the brakes now.  It also contends that the balance \nof harms and the public interest favor its position. \nDefendants rejoin that preliminary-injunctive relief is inappropriate both because the \nCorps has satisfied its obligations under the NHPA – in other words, the Tribe is unlikely to \nsucceed on the merits of its NHPA claim – and because the Tribe has failed to show that any \nharm will befall it in the absence of an injunction.  As the Court agrees on both points, it need \nnot consider the final two factors – balance of harms and the public interest – to deny the \nMotion.  It now discusses the merits and the harm separately. \n38 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 39 of 58\nA.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nAlthough the Tribe’s legal theory is not entirely clear, the Court believes it can infer four \nseparate arguments that the Corps’ permitting of DAPL was unlawful.  First, the Standing Rock \nSioux assert that the Corps violated the NHPA when it promulgated NWP 12 without a Section \n106 process.  Next, they contend that, even if the Corps could defer site-specific Section 106 \nconsultations when promulgating NWP 12, it violated the NHPA by permitting DAPL-related \nactivities at some federally regulated waters without a Section 106 determination.  Third, the \nTribe maintains that, even where the Corps did conduct a Section 106 process, it unlawfully \nnarrowed the scope of its review to only those areas around the permitted activity, as opposed to \nthe entire pipeline.  Finally, the Tribe urges that the Section 106 process at the PCN sites was \ninadequate because the quality of the consultations was deficient.  None of these claims appears \nlikely to succeed on the merits at this stage. \n1.  NWP 12 \nAlthough many DAPL-related construction activities in federally regulated waters \noccurred or will occur at places where the Corps did not require a PCN verification, such \nactivities nevertheless required approval from the Corps under the CWA or RHA.  That approval \nwas provided on a general level when the Corps re-promulgated NWP 12 in 2012.  Because \nthese activities thus were “permitted” by a federal agency, they fall within the NHPA’s definition \nof a federal “undertaking.”  See 54 U.S.C. § 300320; 36 C.F.R. § 800.16(y).  As federal \nundertakings, they triggered the Corps’ NHPA duty to consider, prior to the issuance of the \npermit, their effects on properties of cultural or historic significance.  See 54 U.S.C. § 306108 \n(“[P]rior to the issuance of any license, [the federal agency] shall take into account the effect of \n39 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 40 of 58\nthe undertaking on any historic property.”).  According to the Tribe, the Corps did not fulfill this \nobligation because NWP 12 was issued without any tribal consultations.   \n  As an initial matter, the Tribe’s assertion that the Corps did not engage in any NHPA \nconsultations prior to promulgating NWP 12 is false.  Before issuing NWP 12, the Corps, in \nNovember 2009, sent an early notification to tribes, including Standing Rock, containing \ninformation pertaining to its proposed NWPs.  See ECF No. 21, Exh. 14 (Letter from Ruchs to \nBrings Plenty on Nov. 9, 2009).  The letter contained a graphic depiction of the types of \nactivities that were most often authorized by nationwide permits in the Omaha District.  Id.  In \naddition, in 2010, the Corps proceeded to hold “listening sessions and workshops” with tribes to \ndiscuss their concerns related to the proposed nationwide permits.  See ECF No. 21, Exh. 13 \n(Tribal Information Fact Sheet).  In March 2010, the Corps contacted Standing Rock personally \nto discuss the permits and any additional regional conditions that the Tribe thought might need to \nbe included to protect their cultural resources.  See Chieply Decl., ¶ 5.  \nThen, on February 10, 2011, the Corps sent a letter to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribal \nChairman and THPO Young, notifying them of its plan to publish a proposal in the Federal \nRegister to reissue NWP 12.  See ECF No. 21, Exh. 13 (Letter from Ruchs to Murphy on Feb. \n10, 2011).  Attached to the letter, the Corps provided a description of the proposed NWP 12, as \nwell as a draft of the current Omaha District regional conditions that would apply to the permit.  \nId.  The Corps requested that the Tribe “consider this letter our invitation to begin consultation \non the proposal to reissue the NWPs.”  Id.  It went on to say that the Corps “look[s] forward to \nconsulting with you on a government-to-government basis on this issue” and requested that the \nTribe notify the Corps if it was “interested in consulting.”  Id.  The Corps further committed to \nprovide a “Corps representative at consultation and fact-finding meetings” and to “fully consider \n40 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 41 of 58\nany information you wish to provide.”  Id.  In an email on March 9, 2011, the Corps followed up \non the offer.  See Chieply Decl., ¶ 7.  The Corps also seems to have conducted district-level \ntribal listening sessions and workshops.  See Tribal Information Fact Sheet at 1.  There is no \nindication in the record that the Tribe responded to the Corps’ invitation to consult, but was \nignored.  The Tribe, in fact, concedes that it did not participate in the notice-and-comment for \nNWP 12 at all.  See Reply at 2.  When it actually promulgated NWP 12, moreover, the Corps \nincluded a section on its compliance with the NHPA, noting that GC 20 “requires consultation \nfor activities that have the potential to cause effects to historic properties” prior to those \nactivities’ proceeding under the general permit.  See ECF No 6, Exh. 1 (Nationwide Permit 12 \nDecision Document) at 10 (emphasis added).   \nTo the extent that the Tribe now seeks in this Motion to launch a belated facial attack \nagainst NWP 12, then, it is unlikely to succeed.  The Corps made a reasonable effort to discharge \nits duties under the NHPA prior to promulgating NWP 12, given the nature of the general permit.  \nCf. Sierra Club v. Bostick, 787 F.3d 1043, 1047, 1057 (10th Cir. 2015) (holding Corps \npermissibly interpreted CWA “to allow partial deferral of minimal-impacts analysis” because of \n“the difficulty of predicting the impact of activities allowed under nationwide permits”).  \nWithout definite knowledge of the specific locations that would require permitting in the future, \nit is hard to ascertain what else the Corps might have done, before issuing a general permit, to \ndischarge its NHPA duties.  In other words, the Corps, when it promulgated NWP 12, had no \nknowledge of DAPL or its proposed route.  The CWA and RHA plainly allow the Corps to do \njust what it did here: preauthorize a group of similar activities that, alone and combined, have \nminimal impact on navigable waterways.  This Court cannot conclude that the Corps does not \n41 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 42 of 58\nhave the ability to promulgate these general permits at all.  As a result, the Corps’ effort to speak \nwith those it thought might be concerned was sufficient to discharge its NHPA obligations.  \nThis conclusion is reinforced by the limited scale and scope of the federally sanctioned \nactivities at issue. The Advisory Council’s regulations provide that the “agency official should \nplan consultations appropriate to the scale of the undertaking and the scope of the Federal \ninvolvement.”  36 C.F.R. § 800.4(a).  Here, the scope of the Corps’ involvement was limited.  It \nnever had the ability, after all, to regulate the entire construction of a pipeline.  Congress has \ndecided that no general federal regulation applies to domestic oil pipelines.  In addition, the scale \nof the federally permitted undertaking here is narrow.  The CWA and RHA regulate, as relevant \nhere, only certain limited construction activities in waterways.  The CWA, moreover, restricts \nthe use of general permits to an even narrower subset of these already limited activities in \nwaterways.  The Corps can only authorize discharges that have a minimal impact on the \njurisdictional waterway through a general permit.  See 33 U.S.C. § 1344(e).  In other words, \nNWP 12, by definition, can authorize only that regulated conduct that will have little effect on \nthe regulated waterway in the first place.  Given these restrictions, the Corps’ decision to \npromulgate NWP 12 after the effort to consult that it made here was reasonable. \nThe Tribe responds that the Corps was instead required to work out a “programmatic \nagreement” with any tribe that might one day be affected by the activities permitted under NWP \n12.  See Mot. at 22-23.  A programmatic agreement is an “agreement to govern the \nimplementation of a particular program or the resolution of adverse effects from certain complex \nproject situations or multiple undertakings” that is negotiated by the Advisory Council and the \npermitting agency.  See 36 C.F.R. § 800.14(b).  On this score, Standing Rock is certainly right \nthat the Corps could have pursued a programmatic agreement to fulfill its NHPA duties, as it did \n42 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 43 of 58\nin 2004 with several tribes in regard to the Missouri Basin.  See ECF No. 6, Exh. 4 \n(Programmatic Agreement).  But the Advisory Council does not make the pursuit of a \nprogrammatic agreement mandatory.  See 36 C.F.R. § 800.14(b) (“The Advisory Council and the \nagency official may negotiate a programmatic agreement.”) (emphasis added).  The Court thus \ncannot conclude that a PA was the only avenue available to the Corps to fulfill its duties under \nthe NHPA.  There is, indeed, no indication that such a requirement would even be feasible for a \nnationwide permitting scheme given the sheer number of possible consulting parties.  Nor could \nthe Corps have complied with the full Advisory Council process, which is clearly designed for \nproject-specific determinations.  As a result, it was reasonable for the Corps to engage in a \ngeneral process at the time it promulgated NWP 12 and to defer site-specific NHPA \ndeterminations to a later time.   \n2.  NWP 12 Applied at Non-PCN Sites  \n  The Tribe next argues that NWP 12’s operation is unlawful because the Corps makes no \nsite-specific Section 106 determination for numerous generally permitted activities – i.e., non-\nPCN sites.  In particular, it claims that GC 20 improperly delegates authority to the permittee to \nassess whether its activities will have a potential effect on historic properties.  To refresh the \nreader, GC 20 requires that “[i]n cases where the district engineer determines that the activity \nmay affect [NHPA] properties . . . , the activity is not authorized, until the requirements of \nSection 106 of the [NHPA] have been satisfied.”  77 Fed. Reg at 10,284.  The Advisory Council, \ntoo, seems to concur that, in individual cases of permitting under NWP 12, Section 106 is not \nsatisfied where the Corps itself does not make a site-specific determination about whether a \npermitted activity has the potential to affect historic properties.  See ECF No. 6, Exh. 50 at 1-2.  \nAs the Tribe and the Advisory Council read GC 20, the Corps never considers whether an \n43 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 44 of 58\nindividual activity will have the potential to affect historic sites unless the permittee decides that \nit might and, accordingly, seeks a PCN.  The Corps, in turn, responds that it does consider itself \nto retain the authority and responsibility under GC 20 to determine whether permitted activity \nhas the potential to damage historic properties.  See Corps Opp. at 13-14. \nStanding Rock and the Advisory Council make a good argument.  It is possible that the \nCorps’ permitting under NWP 12 would be arbitrary and capricious where it relies completely on \nthe unilateral determination of a permittee that there is no potential cultural resource that will be \ninjured by its permitted activity.  Fortunately, this Court need not decide that issue because that \nis not how the Corps interpreted and applied GC 20 to DAPL.  In this case, the Corps looked at \nreports and maps of the pipeline to determine which jurisdictional crossings had the potential to \naffect historic properties.  See Chieply Decl., Exh. 16 at 1; see also id., Exh. 15 at 1.  These \nextensive maps reflected cultural surveys conducted by licensed archaeologists (sometimes with \nSHPO participation).  See Howard Decl., ¶¶ 4-10; see, e.g., ECF No. 6, Exh. 44.  The Corps \nultimately concluded that only 204 of the jurisdictional crossings triggered either GC 20 or some \nother concern that would require a PCN verification.  See Chieply Decl., Exh. 16 at 1. \nThe Court must review that determination under the Administrative Procedure Act’s \ndeferential standard.  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(a).  Under this standard, the Tribe bears the burden \nto demonstrate that the agency action was unlawful, arbitrary or capricious, or not in accordance \nwith the law.  See Kleppe v. Sierra Club, 427 U.S. 390, 412 (1976).  Plaintiff has not done so \nhere.  At no point has the Tribe clearly pointed this Court to a specific non-PCN activity – i.e., \ncrossings the Corps permitted – where there is evidence that might indicate that cultural \nresources would be damaged.  The Tribe instead focuses on the potential impact to cultural \nresources elsewhere along the pipeline.  But to show the Corps’ determination was unreasonable, \n44 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 45 of 58\nStanding Rock needs to offer more than vague assertions that some places in the Midwest around \nsome bodies of water may contain some sacred sites that could be affected.  For example, if the \nCorps had not required a PCN verification for a site like Lake Oahe (assuming it was not subject \nto the RHA), to which the Tribe has shown it has important historic and cultural connections, this \nCourt might well find unreasonable the Corps’ determination that construction at the site would \nhave no potential to cause negative effects to these resources.  Without such a specific showing \ninvolving a site within the Corps’ jurisdiction, however, the Court can find no ground at this \njuncture to hold that the Corps’ considered judgment – based as it was on its expertise, the \nactivity involved, extensive cultural surveys, and additional research – was unreasonable.  The \nTribe has had more than a year to come up with evidence that the Corps acted unreasonably in \npermitting even a single jurisdictional activity without a PCN, and it has not done so.  As a \nresult, it has not met its burden here.   \n3.  Scope of Section 106 Process at PCN Sites \n  The Tribe next asserts that the Corps’ Section 106 process was deficient even at those \nplaces where it did in fact require a PCN notification.  Here, again, Standing Rock largely \nfocuses its efforts on a sweeping claim that the Corps was obligated in permitting this narrow \nactivity – i.e., certain construction activities in U.S. waterways – to consider the impact on \npotential cultural resources from the construction of the entire pipeline.  In particular, the Tribe \ncontends that the NHPA requires such an analysis because the statute defines the potential effect \nof an undertaking to include the indirect effects of the permitted activity on historic properties.   \nThis argument, however, misses the mark.  In its regulations concerning compliance with \nthe adverse-effects analysis required by the NHPA, the Corps determined that entire pipelines \nneed not be considered part of the analyzed areas.  Rather, only construction activity in the \n45 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 46 of 58\nfederally regulated waterways – the direct effect of the undertaking – and in uplands around the \nfederally regulated waterways – the indirect effect of the undertaking – requires analysis.  See 33 \nC.F.R. pt. 325, app. C, § 1(g)(i).  This Circuit has held just such an approach to be reasonable in \nthe context of a challenge brought under a similar “stop, look, and listen” provision in NEPA, \nand these two statutes are often treated similarly.  See, e.g., Karst Envtl. Educ. & Prot., Inc. v. \nEPA, 475 F.3d 1291, 1294-95 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (“Because of the ‘operational similarity’ between \nNEPA and NHPA, both of which impose procedural obligations on federal agencies after a \ncertain threshold of federal involvement, courts treat ‘major federal actions’ under NEPA \nsimilarly to ‘federal undertakings’ under NHPA.”).  Specifically, this Circuit held that where a \nfederal easement and CWA permitting encompassed only five percent of the length of a pipeline, \n“the federal government was not required to conduct NEPA analysis of the entirety of the . . . \npipeline, including portions not subject to federal control or permitting.”  Sierra Club v. U.S. \nArmy Corps of Eng’rs, 803 F.3d 31, 34-35 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  Other Circuits have held the same.  \nSee Bostick, 787 F.3d at 1051-54 (holding Corps was not required to prepare NEPA analysis of \nentire pipeline when verifying NWPs for 485-mile oil pipeline crossing over 2,000 waterways); \nWinnebago Tribe of Neb. v. Ray, 621 F.2d 269, 272-73 (8th Cir. 1980) (concluding same for \nelectric utility line).  The Tribe offers no persuasive argument as to why the facts here demand a \ndifferent conclusion.  As a result, this Court cannot conclude here that a federal agency with \nlimited jurisdiction over specific activities related to a pipeline is required to consider all the \neffects of the entire pipeline to be the indirectly or directly foreseeable effects of the narrower \npermitted activity.   \nThe Corps’ decision in this regard is also entitled to deference under the APA as it falls \nsquarely within the expertise of the Corps, not the Advisory Council, to determine the scope of \n46 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 47 of 58\nthe effects of construction activities at U.S. waterways.  See Bldg. & Constr. Trades Dep’t v. \nBrock, 838 F.2d 1258, 1266 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (holding courts must be especially deferential to an \nagency’s determination within an area in which it has “special expertise”).  The Tribe, moreover, \nfails to provide any evidence that would call the Corps’ technical judgment in this regard into \nquestion.  See 33 C.F.R. pt. 325, app. C, § 1(g)(i) (explaining that for linear crossings, the \n“permit area shall extend in either direction from the crossing to that point at which alternative \nalignments leading to a reasonable alternative locations for the crossing can be considered and \nevaluated”).  The Tribe contends instead, without evidence, that the entire pipeline must be the \nindirect effect of the permitted activity because the pipeline cannot feasibly avoid all federally \nregulated water crossings.  In other words, no permitting means no pipeline.  The Court cannot \nsay on this record, however, that the Tribe is right.  In fact, as DAPL’s own construction \ndemonstrates, the use of technology such as HDD can at least sometimes avoid the Corps’ \njurisdiction at federally regulated waters by eliminating the need for the discharge of dredge or \nfill material.   \nThe limited nature of the Corps’ jurisdiction, in fact, reinforces the reasonableness of the \nits decision not to consider the effects of the entire pipeline on historic properties before issuing \nthe DAPL permitting.  “[W]here an agency has no ability to prevent a certain effect due to its \nlimited statutory authority over the relevant actions, the agency[’s action] cannot be considered a \nlegally relevant ‘cause’ of the effect.”  Dep’t of Transp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 770 \n(2004).  Section 106 analysis is designed only to “discourage[e] federal agencies from ignoring \npreservation values in projects they initiate, approve funds for or otherwise control.”  Lee v. \nThornburgh, 877 F.2d 1053, 1056 (D.C. Cir. 1989).  That section does not require that the Corps \nconsider the effects of actions over which it has no control and which are far removed from its \n47 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 48 of 58\npermitting activity.  The Corps here ultimately determined that the route taken by the pipeline \nthrough private lands, up to a certain point approaching a federally regulated waterway, is driven \nby factors that have little to do with the discrete activities that the Corps needs to permit.  The \nCourt cannot conclude otherwise on this record.  As such, it cannot hold the Corps’ decision \narbitrary, capricious, or otherwise unlawful. \n4.  Sufficiency of Consultations \n  Plaintiff’s last point on the merits is that the Corps failed to offer it a reasonable \nopportunity to participate in the Section 106 process as to the narrow scope of the construction \nactivity that the Corps did consider to be an effect of the permitted waterway activities.  The \nfactual proceedings recited in exhaustive detail in Section I.D., supra, tell a different story.  The \nCorps has documented dozens of attempts to engage Standing Rock in consultations to identify \nhistorical resources at Lake Oahe and other PCN crossings.  To the reader’s relief, the Court \nneed not repeat them here.  Suffice it to say that the Tribe largely refused to engage in \nconsultations.  It chose instead to hold out for more – namely, the chance to conduct its own \ncultural surveys over the entire length of the pipeline.  \nIn fact, on this record, it appears that the Corps exceeded its NHPA obligations at many \nof the PCN sites.  For example, in response to the Tribe’s concerns about burial sites at the James \nRiver crossing, the Corps verified that cultural resources indeed were present and instructed \nDakota Access to move the pipeline to avoid them.  Dakota Access did so.  See Ames Decl., \n¶ 24.  Furthermore, the Corps took numerous trips to Lake Oahe with members of the Tribe to \nidentify sites of cultural significance.  See Summit Lake Paiute Tribe of Nevada v. U.S. Bureau \nof Land Mgmt., 496 F. App’x 712, 715 (9th Cir. 2012) (not reported) (holding four visits with a \ntribe to site constituted sufficient consultation for resolution of adverse effects).  Colonel \n48 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 49 of 58\nHenderson also met with the Tribe no fewer than four times in the spring of 2016 to discuss their \nconcerns with the pipeline.  Ultimately, the Corps concluded that no sites would be affected by \nthe DAPL construction at Lake Oahe, and the State Historic Preservation Officer who had visited \nthat site concurred.  The Corps’ effort to consult the Tribe on this site – the place that most \nclearly implicated the Standing Rock Sioux’s cultural interests – sufficed under the NHPA. \nContact, of course, is not consultation, and “consultation with one tribe doesn’t relieve \nthe [agency] of its obligation to consult with any other tribe.”  Quechan Tribe of Fort Yuma \nIndian Reservation v. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, 755 F. Supp. 2d 1104, 1112, 1118 (S.D. Cal. 2010).  \nBut this is not a case about empty gestures.  As noted in Section I.D., supra, and the examples \njust above, the Corps and the Tribe engaged in meaningful exchanges that in some cases resulted \nin concrete changes to the pipeline’s route.  “This is not a case like Quechan Tribe, where a tribe \nentitled to consultation actively sought to consult with an agency and was not afforded the \nopportunity.”  Wilderness Soc’y. v. Bureau of Land Mgmt., 526 F. App’x 790, 793 (9th Cir. May \n28, 2013) (not reported).    \nThe Tribe nevertheless asserts that the Corps’ failure to include it in the early cultural \nsurveys rendered the permitting unlawful for at least some of the PCN sites.  These surveys, \nhowever, were not conducted by the Corps or under its direction.  Even setting this fact aside, \nneither the NHPA nor the Advisory Council regulations require that any cultural surveys be \nconducted for a federal undertaking.  The regulations instead demand only that the Corps make a \n“reasonable and good faith effort” to consult on identifying cultural properties, which “may \ninclude background research, consultation, oral history interviews, sample field investigations, \nand field survey.”  36 C.F.R. § 800.4(b)(1).  It goes without saying that “‘may’ means may.”  \nMcCreary v. Offner, 172 F.3d 76, 83 (D.C. Cir. 1999).  These regulations contain “no \n49 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 50 of 58\nrequirement that a good faith effort include all of these things.”  Summit Lake Paiute, 496 F. \nApp’x at 715.  The Tribe, then, did not have an absolute right to participate in cultural surveying \nat every permitted undertaking, as it seems to argue.  The Advisory Council regulations direct \nthe agency to “take into account past planning, research, and studies” in making these types of \ndeterminations, see 36 C.F.R. § 800.4(b)(1), and that is just what the Corps did here.  It gave the \nTribe a reasonable and good-faith opportunity to identify sites of importance to it.  As a result, \nthe Court must conclude that the Tribe has not shown that it is likely to succeed on the merits of \nits NHPA claim at this stage.  \nB.  Irreparable Injury \nIn seeking preliminary-injunctive relief here, the Standing Rock Sioux do not claim that a \npotential future rupture in the pipeline could damage their reserved land or water.  Instead, they \npoint to an entirely separate injury: the likelihood that DAPL’s ongoing construction activities – \nspecifically, grading and clearing of land – might damage or destroy sites of great cultural or \nhistorical significance to the Tribe.  The risk that harm might befall such sites is a matter of \nunquestionable importance to the Standing Rock people.  In the eloquent words of their Tribal \nChairman: \nHistory connects the dots of our identity, and our identity was all but \nobliterated. Our land was taken, our language was forbidden. Our \nstories, our history, were almost forgotten. What land, language, and \nidentity remains is derived from our cultural and historic sites. . . . \nSites of cultural and historic significance are important to us because \nthey are a spiritual connection to our ancestors.  Even if we do not \nhave  access  to  all  such  sites,  their  existence  perpetuates  the \nconnection.  When such a site is destroyed, the connection is lost.  \n \nArchambault Decl., ¶¶ 6, 15.  The tragic history of the Great Sioux Nation’s repeated \ndispossessions at the hands of a hungry and expanding early America is well known.  See, e.g., \nDee Brown, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee (1970); United States v. Sioux Nation, 448 U.S. \n50 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 51 of 58\n371 (1980).  The threat that new injury will compound old necessarily compels great caution and \nrespect from this Court in considering the Tribe’s plea for intervention.   \n  Although the potential injury may be significant, the Tribe must show that it is probable \nto occur in the absence of the preliminary injunction it now seeks.  See Winter, 555 U.S. at 22 \n(“Issuing a preliminary injunction based only on a possibility of irreparable harm is inconsistent \nwith [the Court’s] characterization of injunctive relief as an extraordinary remedy that may only \nbe awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.”) (emphasis added).  \nThis is the burden the law imposes for this form of relief.  The Court must faithfully and fairly \napply that standard in all cases, regardless of how high the stakes or how worthy the cause.  After \na careful review of the current record, the Court cannot conclude that the Tribe has met it.  \n  To understand Standing Rock’s deficit in this regard, it is necessary to first consider the \nnature of the relief it seeks.  The Tribe has not sued Dakota Access here for any transgressions; \ninstead, this Motion seeks to enjoin Corps permitting of construction activities in discrete U.S. \nwaterways along the pipeline route.  Such relief sought cannot stop the construction of DAPL on \nprivate lands, which are not subject to any federal law.  Indeed, Standing Rock does not point the \nCourt to any law violated by the private contracts that allow for this construction or any federal \nregulation or oversight of these activities.  From the outset, consequently, no federal agency had \nthe ability to prevent DAPL’s construction from proceeding on these private lands.  At most, the \nCorps could only have stopped these activities at the banks of a navigable U.S. waterway.  An \ninjunction of any unlawful permitting now can, at most, do the same. \nThe facts previously recited bear this simple conclusion out.  Dakota Access, as has been \nexplained, began its construction work on private lands long before it had even secured the Corps \npermitting that the Tribe now seeks to enjoin.  See Mahmoud Decl., ¶ 47.  Standing Rock \n51 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 52 of 58\nconcedes as much.  See Mot. at 35; see also Mot. Hearing Tran. at 46 (“They started construction \nmonths ago, months before the permits were issued.”).  In many places, this work is already \ncomplete.  See Mot. Hearing Trans. at 24.  There is, moreover, no sign that Dakota Access will \npull back from this construction on private land if this Court enjoins the NWP 12 permitting \nnecessary for the 3% of DAPL’s route subject to federal jurisdiction.  Quite the contrary; the \ncompany has indicated that it has little choice but to push ahead in the hopes of meeting contract \nobligations to deliver oil by January 2017.  See, e.g., id. at 40-41; see also Mahmoud Decl., ¶ 51. \nThe Tribe thus cannot demonstrate that the temporary relief it seeks here – i.e., a \npreliminary injunction to withdraw permitting by the Corps for dredge or fill activities in \nfederally regulated waters along the DAPL route – can prevent the harm to cultural sites that \nmight occur from this construction on private lands.  In other words, Standing Rock cannot show \nthat any harm taking place on private lands removed from the Corps’ permitting jurisdiction \n“will directly result from the action which [it now] seeks to enjoin.”  Hunter v. FERC, 527 F. \nSupp. 2d 9, 14-15 (D.D.C. 2007) (explaining that to obtain preliminary relief, “the movant must . \n. . show that ‘the alleged harm will directly result from the action which the movant seeks to \nenjoin’”) (quoting Wisc. Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (emphasis \nadded)); see also Buckingham Corp. v. Karp, 762 F.2d 257, 261 (2d Cir. 1985) (“The purpose of \na preliminary injunction is to protect the moving party from irreparable injury during the \npendency of the action.”).  Powerless to prevent these harms given the current posture of the \ncase, the Court cannot consider them likely to occur in the absence of the relief sought here.  Put \nsimply, any such harms are destined to ensue whether or not the Court grants the injunction the \nTribe desires.  As Standing Rock acknowledges, Dakota Access has demonstrated that it is \ndetermined to build its pipeline right up to the water’s edge regardless of whether it has secured a \n52 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 53 of 58\npermit to then build across.  See Mot. Hearing Trans. at 46.  Like the Corps, this Court is unable \nto stop it from doing so. \nThere is a second related problem with the Tribe’s claim to irreparable injury, both on the \nprivate land and elsewhere along the pipeline.  The risk that construction may damage or destroy \ncultural resources is now moot for the 48% of the pipeline that has already been completed.  Id. \nat 24.  As the clearing and grading are the “clearest and most obvious” cause of the harm to \ncultural sites from pipeline construction, id. at 18-19, 47 (recognizing that injunction is necessary \nanywhere not yet cleared “to prevent additional harm or construction until [cultural] surveys can \ntake place”), moreover, the damage has already occurred for the vast majority of the pipeline, \nwith the notable exception of 10% of the route in North Dakota, including at Lake Oahe.  Here \nagain, then, the Tribe has not shown for this substantial segment of the pipeline that any \nadditional harm is likely to occur to cultural sites absent the preliminary injunction that it now \nseeks.   \nYet a third problem bedevils the Tribe’s efforts to enjoin permitting along the entire \npipeline route.  Plaintiff never defined the boundaries of its ancestral lands vis-à-vis DAPL.  \nInstead, Standing Rock asserts that these lands extend “wherever the buffalo roamed.”  Even \naccepting this is true, to find that there is a likelihood that construction might run afoul of a site \nof cultural significance to the Tribe, this Court must ultimately decide where those culturally \nsignificant lands lie.  There is at least some evidence in the record that they do not traverse the \nentirety of DAPL.  For example, Jon Eagle, the Tribe’s current THPO, indicated prior to this \nlitigation that at least some of the pipeline did not fall within the scope of what he considered \nancestral tribal lands.  See Chieply Decl., Exh. 14 (Letter from Jon Eagle to Martha Chieply on \nMar. 22, 2016) (“Most of the DAPL pipeline route crosses Lakota/Dakota aboriginal land.”); see \n53 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 54 of 58\nalso ECF No. 11-7 (Declaration of H. Frazier).  This Court may not enjoin an action that the \nCorps has authorized by guessing at whether an interest of the Tribe might be affected.  Instead, \nPlaintiff bears the burden to demonstrate that the permitting it seeks to have withdrawn would, in \nthe absence of such relief, likely cause it harm.  This it did not do for much of the pipeline. \nSo what activity remains subject to this Court’s injunctive powers?  Any permitted DAPL \nactivity that the Tribe has shown will likely injure a nearby site of cultural or historic \nsignificance to the Standing Rock people.  As previously explained, 204 sites were subject to \nPCN authorizations and thus were clearly permitted by the Corps.  Those sites are in play.  Other \ndischarges into jurisdictional waters at hypothetical locations along the route, however, may also \nhave been permitted under NWP 12 without a PCN process.  But it would be pure speculation \nbased on the current record to determine where such permitting occurred.  The Tribe points the \nCourt to no specific crossing of cultural significance that the Corps permitted under NWP 12 \nwithout a PCN verification.  In fact, many of the pipeline crossings were not permitted by the \nCorps, sometimes because Dakota Access’s use of HDD did not give rise to the dredge or fill \nactivities that trigger federal jurisdiction under the CWA.  For example, out of the five places in \nNorth Dakota that Dakota Access thought might require a PCN authorization, only three actually \nneeded permitting at all.  See Chieply Decl., ¶ 10.  Of course, there may be many sites that the \nCorps permitted under NWP 12 that the Court has missed.  But the burden is on the Tribe to \nindicate why this permitting must be enjoined to prevent an injury likely to occur to it. The \nCourt, again, cannot guess that at some undefined locations there might be harm to the Tribe.  It \nwas Standing Rock’s burden to point to the specific NWP 12 permitting that was likely to cause \n54 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 55 of 58\nit injury.  Standing Rock did not do so with regard to the permitting that has occurred outside of \nthe PCN verified locations.  \nReturning to the 204 PCN sites, the vast majority must be excluded right off the bat.  As \npreviously noted, construction at 193 of the 204 PCN has already been completed.  See Mot. \nHearing Trans. at 24.  For those sites, the die is cast.  Whatever harms may have occurred from \nDAPL construction, the Court’s intervention to enjoin the permitting now can no longer avoid \nthem.  As a result, the Court must deny the Tribe’s request for an injunction as to permitting at \nthose sites. \nAs to the other 11 PCN sites, the Tribe largely neglects to point the Court to any \nresources that may be affected by permitted activity.  Plaintiff seeks to avoid its responsibility to \nidentify a likely injury at these locations by claiming that this failure stems from the Corps’ \nrefusal to properly consult in the first place and thus should be excused.  See Mot. at 37 n.17.  At \nleast with regard to some of these sites, however, the Corps did offer the Tribe the opportunity to \nvisit the sites or even conduct its own surveys, and the Tribe declined to do so.  See Chieply \nDecl., ¶¶ 28-29.  The record contains abundant evidence that the Corps also repeatedly sought \nother input on known cultural sites at these locations, and, in many cases, other tribes conducted \nsite visits to search for any resources likely to be affected by the DAPL work.  Id.  The Tribe \ncannot now ask the Court to speculate that there would be a likely injury at these places by \nclaiming that it was prevented from assessing these sites. \nThese sites are also subject to several additional restrictions that make it unlikely that \nconstruction will damage or destroy sites of cultural significance to the Tribe.  First, the Corps \nattached restrictions to its PCN authorizations.  These restrictions mandate that tribal monitors \nand archaeologists be allowed at these sites to look for any evidence of previously overlooked \n55 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 56 of 58\nresources whenever construction is happening.  See ECF No. 6, Exhs. 33-36 (PCN \nauthorizations).  GC 21 will also require that Dakota Access stop work until any unanticipated \ndiscovery can be evaluated for its historic and cultural significance by the Corps and the SHPO.  \nSee NWP 12 at 10,184.  Standing Rock, too, will have the right to be involved in that verification \nprocess.  Id.  Given all these precautions, and the Tribe’s failure to point the Court toward any \nevidence that a particular resource will be injured by this work, the Court must conclude that \nPlaintiff has not met its burden to show that irreparable injury is likely to occur without an \ninjunction against this permitting. \nAnd then there was one: Lake Oahe.  This is the sole permitting that the Tribe might \narguably show is likely to cause harm to cultural or historic sites of significance to it.  As \npreviously discussed, Lake Oahe is of undeniable importance to the Tribe, and the general area is \ndemonstrably home to important cultural resources.  Even here, though, the Tribe has not met its \nburden to show that DAPL-related work is likely to cause damage.  The Corps and the Tribe \nconducted multiple visits to the area earlier this year in an effort to identify sites that might be \nharmed by DAPL’s construction.  See Eagle Decl., ¶¶ 13-14; Harnois Decl., ¶ 29.  While the \nTribe identified several previously undiscovered resources during those visits, these sites are \nlocated away from the activity required for the DAPL construction.  See Harnois Decl., ¶ 29.  \nUltimately, the Corps considered these findings and determined that they would not be affected \nby the permitted activity.  Id., ¶ 33.  Most importantly, the North Dakota SHPO concurred in this \nopinion after having toured the site as well.  See Harnois Decl., ¶ 34. \nSeveral factors unique to the site also support this conclusion.  The area around the \npermitted activity has been subject to previous surveying for other utility projects.  See \nMahmoud Decl., ¶¶ 18-19.  DAPL likewise will run parallel, at a distance of 22 to 300 feet, to an \n56 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 57 of 58\nalready-existing natural-gas pipeline under the lake.  Id.; see also Mot. Hearing Tran. at 25.  \nDakota Access will also use the less-invasive HDD method to run the pipeline, which will \nrequire less disturbance to the land around the drilling and bury the pipeline at a depth that is \nunlikely to damage cultural resources.  See Howard Decl., ¶ 7; see also Mahmoud Decl., ¶ 19.  \nIndeed, the Corps concluded that this method would not cause structural impacts at sites away \nfrom the direct drilling, and the Tribe presents no evidence to the contrary.  See ECF No. 6, Exh. \n51 (Omaha District Envtl. Assessment) at 78-79.  Any temporary disturbance to the atmospherics \naround the site, moreover, will not be irreparable as they will be removed once the construction \nis complete.  Finally, like the other PCN sites, there are several protective measures in place to \nassure that the Tribe and others will be able to monitor the construction activity to protect any \npreviously unidentified resources. \nFor all of the above reasons, the Tribe has not carried its burden to demonstrate that the \nCourt could prevent damage to important cultural resources by enjoining the Corps’ DAPL-\nrelated permitting.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n57 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-01534-JEB   Document 39   Filed 09/09/16   Page 58 of 58\nIV.  Conclusion \nAs it has previously mentioned, this Court does not lightly countenance any depredation \nof lands that hold significance to the Standing Rock Sioux.  Aware of the indignities visited upon \nthe Tribe over the last centuries, the Court scrutinizes the permitting process here with particular \ncare.  Having done so, the Court must nonetheless conclude that the Tribe has not demonstrated \nthat an injunction is warranted here.  The Court, therefore, will issue a contemporaneous Order \ndenying the Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction. \n \n                          /s/ James E.
