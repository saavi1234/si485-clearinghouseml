However, since that time, the Court has determined that it would be most efficient to consider the motion to \nadd HUD along with these motions and obviate the need for an additional hearing in this case. The parties were notified of the \nCourt’s decision to consider the motion without oral argument on May 18, 1999. \n \n2  The court in Reeves, as set forth in the Court’s December 1998 Opinion, found that the CERCLA bar did not prevent plaintiffs from \nbringing constitutional challenges to the EPA’s actions. \n \n \n3  As the Court has attempted to make clear to all parties both in its previous opinion and at the oral argument in this matter, the \nruling on the sufficiency of the plaintiff’s allegations at this stage is governed by the standards for considering motions to dismiss. \n \nThe Court makes no prediction as to whether the plaintiff will be able to survive a motion for summary judgment on this claim, or \nthe other claims, and will consider that motion in due course based on the applicable standards. \n \n4  Final agency action is defined in the APA as “the whole or part of any agency rule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the \nequivalent or denial thereof, or failure to act.” 5 U.S.C. § 531(13). \n \n \n5  The Court recognizes that in this case there would be a potential claim under the APA as a challenge to the EPA’s final agency \naction, and that such a challenge must be guided by 5 U.S.C. 706(2), which limits the district court’s review to a determination \n \nbased on the record of whether the agency’s action was arbitrary and capricious, and if it is so deemed, the remedy would be a \nremand to the EPA for further decision-making. The Court additionally acknowledges that the plaintiff has not sought a remand \nand indeed it is likely unavailable as a remedy at this time due to CERCLA’s bar to litigation prior to the completion of the \nremedial plan. As a result, what remedy is available to the plaintiff if it succeeds on its claims against the EPA under the Fifth \nAmendment, if any, becomes a delicate issue which will likely require additional briefing and exploration by the parties and the \nCourt at some a later date. See Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228, 236–40. \n \n9 \n \n\nWashington Park Lead Committee, Inc. v. U.S. E.P.A., Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (1999)   \n50 ERC 1340 \n \n6  At the oral argument on this matter, the Court specifically questioned the EPA’s counsel regarding the EPA’s (the agency \nresponsible for implementing CERCLA) position as to when the statute of limitation was triggered under CERCLA. The counsel for \n \nthe EPA was unwilling to commit to a legal position on this issue on the record. \n \n7  The plaintiff attempts to distinguish Jersey Heights arguing that it is inapplicable because it involved the location of a road, and \nnot a housing decision. However, the plaintiff in Jersey Heights, like the plaintiff here, alleged that the defendants’ actions had \n \neffectively locked the plaintiff’s neighborhood off from other neighborhoods, i.e., effecting available housing in a discriminatory \nmanner. The Court is unpersuaded by the plaintiff’s attempt to distinguish the facts of this case from those in Jersey Heights as it \nrelates to the claims under the FHA. \n \n8  In addition to the sufficiency of the pleadings, the defendants contend that the relief requested is unavailable under the FHA. \nSpecifically, the defendants argue that if the Court granted the plaintiff’s claim for relief under the FHA, it arguably would be \n \nrequired to construct new housing for the plaintiff’s members by using Treasury funds, rather than merely allowing a private \nparty to build the proposed housing. The plaintiff argues that because the defendants are involved in zoning, development and \nmanagement of public housing, and the implementation of the clean-up under CERCLA, relocation is an appropriate result for the \nplaintiff, and new construction would not necessarily be required. The Court need not address this issue at this juncture since \ndiscovery taken by the plaintiff may enlighten the parties as to the responsibilities and authority of each of the defendants. \nSimilarly, to the receipt of federal funds is a requirement under the FHA, whether the PRHA and the City are the recipients of \nfederal funds is an issue that is best resolved at a later date after discovery is completed. \n \n9  The PRHA and City additionally argue that Title VI does not provide a private right of action. The PRHA’s only authority for this \nproposition is that the Supreme Court recently granted certiorari on this issue in a case pending from the Third Circuit. See \n \nChester Residents Concerned for the Quality Living v. Sief, 132 F.3d 925 (3rd Cir.1997), dismissed as moot, 119 U.S.22 (1998). \nHowever, because nine courts of appeal have held that a private right of action exists under Title VI, the Court will decline to \ndismiss Count IV based on this argument at this stage. See Pl’s Memo at 45 (citations omitted). If in fact the Supreme Court holds \notherwise during the pendency of this case, the Court will certainly modify this portion of its ruling. \n \n10  HUD indicated in its response to plaintiff’s supplemental response that it would file an opposition to any formally filed motion to \namend. However, in the interest of judicial efficiency and economy, the Court herein grants the motion to amend, HUD’s \n \nopposition to the Court’s grant of leave to amend is so noted for the record, additional argument will not be considered with \nregard to the plaintiff’s request for leave to amend, and therefore, a memoranda on this issue are not required. \n \n \n \n \nEnd of Document \n \n \n \n \n10 \n ",
