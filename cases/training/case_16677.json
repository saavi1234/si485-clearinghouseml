Under § 107, each PRP is liable for “(A) all costs ... incurred by the United \nStates Government or a State or an Indian tribe ...” and “(B) any other necessary costs or response incurred by any \nother person....” 42 U.S.C. § 9607(a) (emphasis added). \n \n3  42 U.S.C. § 9613(f) provides in pertinent part: \n \nAny person may seek contribution from any other person who is liable or potentially liable under section 9607(a) \nof this title, during or following any civil action under section 9606 of this title or under section 9607(a) of this \ntitle. \n \n4  In the absence of a challenge the Sixth Circuit has allowed a PRP to proceed with a claim under § 107. See Velsicol \n  Chem. Corp. v. Enenco, Inc., 9 F.3d 524 (6th Cir.1993). \n \n5  The Supreme Court has also implied that a CERCLA claim by one PRP against another is limited to a claim for \n  contribution. In Key Tronic Corp. v. United States, 511 U.S. 809, 114 S.Ct. 1960, 128 L.Ed.2d 797 (1994), the Court \nobserved that CERCLA sections 104 and 106 make it clear that the parties described in § 107 are liable to the \ngovernment. \n  4 \n \n\n \nThat § 107 imposes liability on A for costs incurred “by any other person” implies —but does not expressly \ncommand—that A may have a claim for contribution against those treated as joint tortfeasors. \n128 L.Ed.2d at 806 n. 11 (emphasis added). \n \n6  Significantly, more recent district court decisions from within the Sixth Circuit have held that a PRP may not bring a \n  107 claim. See e.g., Dartron Corp. v. Uniroyal Chemical Co., 917 F.Supp. 1173 (N.D.Ohio 1996); Plaskon Electronic \nMaterials, Inc. v.

Each of the OU’s was used for the disposal of papermaking residuals and has \nbeen identified as a potential source of continuing PCB releases to the Site. \n \n2  Georgia Pacific’s expert, Mr. Richard Valley, estimated that between 1960 and 1979, Plaintiff’s members discharged \n  between 2 million and 4 million pounds of PCBs. Valley estimated the minimum theoretical PCB discharges for each \ncompany as follows: Georgia Pacific, 560,000 pounds; Allied Paper, 895,000 pounds; Simpson–Plainwell, 254,000 \npounds; and James River, 512,000 pounds. KRSG’s expert, Blasland, Bouck & Lee, Inc., reported in its July 1992 \nDescription of the Current Situation that a 1983 survey of PCBs in the Kalamazoo River indicated that the sediments \nin some portions of the Site (the area surrounding Bryant Mill Pond, the Plainwell, Otsego, and Trowbridge \nimpoundments, and Lake Allegan) contained an estimated 227,910 pounds of PCBs. In March 1996, the EPA \nestimated that over 300,000 pounds of PCBs had been disposed of at the Site and that they were continuing to \nmigrate downstream. \n \n3  The defendants named in this action are Rockwell International, Eaton Corporation, Wells Aluminum Corporation, \n  Hercules, Inc., Benteler Industries, Inc., Menasha Corporation, Pharmacia and Upjohn Company, and Rock–Tenn \nCompany, Mill Division, Inc., \n \n4  KRSG’s Amended Complaint includes the following theories of recovery: Count I, demand for reimbursement of \n  response costs under CERCLA § 107(a); Count II, contribution under CERCLA §§ 113(f) and 107(a); Count III, \ndeclaratory judgment of CERCLA liability under CERCLA § 113(g)(2); Count IV, contribution under federal common \nlaw; Count V, recovery of response costs under NREPA § 20126 M.C.L. § 324.20126; Count VI, contribution under \nNREPA § 20129, M.C.L. 324.20129; Count VII, contribution under the Joint Tort–Feasors Act, M.C.L. § 600.2925a; and \nCount VIII, reimbursement for unjust enrichment. \n \n5  The Second circuit outlined the government’s burden of proof in a § 107(a) action as follows: \n \n[T]he government need only prove: (1) there was a release or threatened release, which (2) caused incurrence of \nresponse costs, and (3) that the defendant generated hazardous waste at the clean-up site. What is not required \nis that the government show that a specific defendant’s waste caused incurrence of clean-up costs. \nAlcan, 990 F.2d at 721. CERCLA “requires plaintiff to prove that the release or threatened release caused the \nincurrence of response costs, and that the defendant is a generator of hazardous substances at the facility.” United \nStates v. Alcan Aluminum Corp., 964 F.2d 252, 264 (3rd Cir.1992). \n \n6  The Eighth Circuit raised the question of what degree of connection would be necessary to establish a causal nexus \n  between the release and the incurrence of response costs in Control Data, 53 F.3d at 935 n. 8. The court was not \nrequired to resolve this problem in Control Data because there was no question that the defendants’ release directly \ncaused the incurrence of response costs by the plaintiff. \n \n7  CERCLA § 113(f) provides in pertinent part: \n \n  12 \n \n\n \nIn resolving contribution claims, the court may allocate response costs among liable parties using such equitable \nfactors as the court determines are appropriate. \n42 U.S.C. § 9613(f)(1)(emphasis added). \n \n8  Although not necessary to the setting of this standard, the Court observes that there is some recent recognition in \n  the case law that passive migration may not be the kind of release that gives rise to owner liability. See, e.g., ABB \nInd. Systems v. Prime Technology, Inc., 120 F.3d 351, 358–59 (2nd Cir.1997)(“If a person merely controlled a site on \nwhich hazardous chemicals have spread without that person’s fault, that person is not a polluter and is not one \nupon whom CERCLA aims to impose liability.”); Brookfield–North Riverside Water Comm’n v. Martin Oil Marketing, \nLtd., No. 90 C 5884, 1992 WL 63274 (N.D.Ill. March 12, 1992) (There cannot be “several different releases of \nhazardous substances when it is undisputed that all the wastes came from a single source.”) \n \n9  Both OCC and DLK refer to cardboard. OCC is post-consumer use boxes and DLK is cardboard scraps that have not \n  entered the stream of commerce. \n \n10  Menasha’s expert, Dr. Schell, states: \n \nAs a result of the intensive recycling efforts which started in the mid–1970s and continue on a large scale basis \neven today, these PCBs which originated in NCR paper have slowly infiltrated a large portion of the world’s paper \nstock, albeit in a steadily decreasing concentration. Thus, in theory, any mill that uses even small quantities of \npost-consumer  paper  as  furnish  could  have  inadvertently  introduced  minute  quantities  of  PCBs  into  the \nproduction line. Theoretically, this could have occurred with Menasha’s use of OCC, and could provide one \npossible explanation for the low levels of PCBs detected in the Otsego mill’s finished product in 1976 and 1983. \n \n11  In 1976 three samples were each tested twice for Aroclors 1242 and 1254. 8 of the 12 tests were positive for PCBs. \n  Five samples tested positive for Aroclor 1254 at levels of 0.4, 0.3, 0.3, 0.2 and 0.2 ppm. Three samples tested \npositive for Aroclor 1242 at levels of 0.4, 0.3 and 0.3 ppm. With respect to both of the 0.4 ppm results, the duplicate \ntest showed a non-detect, and on one test it was noted that the chromatogram was distorted. In 1983, both \ncomposite samples tested positive for PCBs. One tested positive for Aroclor 1260 at 0.2 ppm. The other tested \npositive for Aroclor 1242 at 0.3 ppm and for Aroclor 1260 at 0.1 ppm. \n \n12  The August 1976 water test was non-detect for PCBs at the lowest detection limit used by the MDNR (<0.0001 ug/1). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  13 \n ",

(Opinion and Order, 12/8/98, Docket # ‘s 849 & 850). The Phase II trial held in November \n1999  addressed  the  allocation  of  costs  between  Plaintiff  KRSG  and  Defendant  Rockwell  and  resulted  in  a \ndetermination not to allocate any response costs to Rockwell. (Opinion and Order, 6/5/00, Docket # ‘s 942 & 943). \nThe Phase III trial held in January 2001 addressed the liability of Eaton Corporation for PCB discharges from its Battle \nCreek and Kalamazoo facilities and resulted in a finding that Eaton was liable for PCB releases to the Site from its \nBattle Creek and Kalamazoo facilities.

Similarly, in this case, the   \nevidence presented leaves a “gap” that is simply too wide \nto  allow a  jury to  speculate  on  the  ultimate issue  of \nFootnotes \n \n1  The MDNR is now known as the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (“MDEQ”). \n \n \n2  The Site is known as the “Allied Paper, Inc./Portage Creek/Kalamazoo River Superfund (National Priorities List) Site.” \n \n \n3  General Signal Corporation and ICM Acquisitions had previously owned and operated the facility. \n \n \n4  The ditch was built in the 1950s. Approximately 430 feet south of the headwall there is an oil skimmer and a 4–foot \n  concrete dam that was built in 1971. At the 2700–foot point there is an earthen mound barrier used by farmers for \ncrossing the ditch. Beyond the barrier, the ditch loses its distinctive features. The land surface slopes downward \ntoward Morrow Lake and the ditch flattens out and blends into the wet wooded area along the shore of the lake. \n \n5  To put the PCB levels in perspective, MDNR’s cleanup criteria developed pursuant to Michigan NREPA, M.C.L.A. § \n  324.20120a, is 21 mg/kg for the industrial category and 2.3 mg/kg for the residential category, the most stringent \ncategory. \n \n6  Austin also analyzed the streamflow by doubling the rainfall amount to 7 inches in a 24–hour period (which has not \n  occurred in Michigan in the last 40 years). This led to a no-flow condition within 1300 feet from the headwall, far \nshort of flowing into Morrow Lake. \n \n7  The map was originally created in 1961 with a photo revised date of 1985. Benteler alleges that it is outdated, that \n  there is no evidence to show that the map accurately reflects the conditions of the waterway since Benteler \npurchased the property in 1989, and that therefore the map was an unreliable factual basis for Brown’s opinion. The \ndistrict court agreed. \n \n  6 \n \n\n8  KRSG did not take any other samples except those at the 3– and 18–feet points. Dr. Brown relies on the soil sample \n  taken by Benteler’s consultants in August 1996 to support his assertion that PCBs have been detected at 1700 feet \nfrom Morrow Lake, i.e., 1500 feet from the north headwall. But according to Benteler’s experts, this 1996 sample \nwas retested and produced a non-detectable result. See supra, pgs. 1068–69. Further, it should be noted that the \n1500–foot sample relied upon by Dr. Brown had a PCB-concentration of 0.43 mg/kg, a lower concentration than that \nfound at 18 feet, seemingly thwarting Dr. Brown’s implication that there should be higher concentrations toward \nthe top of the ditch and lower concentrations at the bottom end of the ditch. \n \n9  Benteler’s experts, Dr. Halfen and Mr. Austin, contend that these two samples were taken from an area that is \n  subject to periodic flooding from Morrow Lake. In fact, they claim that the entire area 200 feet in from the shore of \nMorrow Lake is what is known as a “riverine wetland” and has been and continues to be periodically inundated with \nwaters from Morrow Lake. Thus, they concluded that the PCB levels found at 3 feet and 18 feet “more likely” could \nbe attributed to flooding of Morrow Lake. The district court agreed, stating that “because there is no evidence of \nPCBs between the 1500–foot mark and 18 feet from the lake, a distance of approximately 1700 feet, the lake is \nmore probably the source of the PCBs.” \n \n10  In this same 1995 report, the consultant stated that “[t]he drainage ditch beyond 600 feet is normally dry. Only \n  during periods of extremely high flow, the water will flow all the way to Morrow Lake. During normal flow \nconditions, water in the drainage ditch infiltrates to the groundwater on Benteler Industries property....” \n \n11  Earlier in this same letter, MDNR states that “[a]lthough Benteler Industries continues to discharge wastewater to \n  the ditch, the discharge does not reach the Kalamazoo River under normal conditions. The potential does exist, \nalthough it does not appear likely, that the discharge could reach the river during significant storm events.” \n \n12  Benteler argues that Brown’s reliance  on these  documents is based  on a  “gross mischaracterization of the \n  referenced documents.” Benteler contends that there is nothing in the referenced documents that “remotely” \nsuggests that discharges into the ditch during Benteler’s ownership were ever sufficient to carry water to Morrow \nLake or that discharges into the ditch during Benteler’s ownership ever carried PCBs to Morrow Lake. The district \ncourt agreed. It stated that in regard to the referenced documents “KRSG has overstated the evidence.... In the \ndocuments since Benteler purchased the facility, Benteler and MDNR speak only in terms of the possibility or risk of \ndischarges reaching Morrow Lake.” \n \n13  See supra, pg. 1069. \n \n \n14  Austin does not dispute Dr. Brown’s calculations regarding the amounts of non-storm discharge; however, he claims \n  that “this volume [of non-storm] discharge has no significant impact on the findings nor on my opinion. Translated \ninto  terms  consistent  with  other  volumes  discussed  herein  this  discharge  amounts  to  29,000  ft.  Adding \napproximately 1% to the worst case [assumed to be 200,000 ft] in this discussion does not affect the outcome.” The \ndistrict court agreed, stating “[a]lthough Dr. Brown argues that Defendant’s estimate of water flow is too low, he \nhas no facts to show that the discharge into the ditch was ever high enough during Benteler’s ownership of the \nfacility to achieve sufficient flow to the river.” \n  7 \n \n\n \n \n  8 \n ",

That suit has settled. \n \n3  Dr. Brown notes that in 1960 the Michigan Water Resources Commission wrote to General Signal’s predecessor at \n  the facility, New York Air Brake Co., stating that it observed oil on Morrow Lake that was traced to drainage from the \nplant. \nIn 1989 counsel for Benteler wrote the MDNR to oppose the issuance of a permit to General Signal to discharge \ntreated groundwater to the ditch: \nThe discharge of an additional 720,000 gallons per day of treated groundwater by General Signal to the ditch will \nincrease the risk that PCB contaminants will be transported to the Kalamazoo River. As owner of the Property, this \nresult could expose Benteler to liability under applicable environmental laws. \nIn a September 27, 1990, letter the MDNR directed Benteler to cease all discharges to the ditch. “This is due to the \npossibility that large stormwater flows could transport PCB’s in the ditch to the Kalamazoo River.” The MDNR’s June \n24, 1991, letter similarly recognizes the possibility of discharges to the ditch reaching the Kalamazoo River: \nBenteler Industries must cease discharges to the ditch due to the possibility that contaminants could spread to \nthe Kalamazoo River or spread the existing groundwater plume. \nIn January 1993, WW Engineering, Benteler’s environmental consultant, prepared a draft Storm Water Discharge \nPermit Application for the MDNR which included the statement: \nMORROW LAKE (PART OF THE KALAMAZOO RIVER) IS THE DISCHARGE POINT FOR THE DRAINAGE DITCH LEAVING \nTHE BENTELER PROPERTY. \nIn February 1993 WW Engineering issued a “Remedial Action Work Plan for the Storm Sewer Lines and On–Site \nDitch” for Benteler. In that report WW Engineering noted as follows: \nAs documented in the above referenced reports, sediments containing PCBs are present in the storm sewer and \ndrainage ditch at the Benteler site.... Potential aquatic impacts would be somewhat limited due to the general low \nflow and intermittent nature of water in this ditch. In the future, contaminants in the drainage ditch could \nmigrate further down the ditch into the adjacent impoundment of the Kalamazoo River. Such migration, if it were \nto occur, could present a potentially greater impact to the aquatic environment. \n  7 \n \n\n \n4  Rule 56(f) provides: \n \nShould it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion that the party cannot for reasons stated \npresent by affidavit facts essential to justify that party’s opposition, the court may refuse the application for \njudgment or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery \nto be had or may make such other order as is just. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  8 \n ",

Dixie Distributing Co., 166 F.3d 840 (6th Cir.1999), this court reaffirmed this general \n  principle. See id. at 847 (citing Centerior for the proposition that “[i]t is correct that unrelated defendants are to be \nmade severally liable only, rather than jointly and severally liable, in an action for contribution under CERCLA”). The \nCarter–Jones court reversed the district court’s determination that in a CERCLA contribution action the liability of a \ncorporation and its sole shareholder must be several as a matter of law, but it did so on state law grounds. The court \nexplained: “Section 113(f) of CERCLA, the section governing contribution actions, in no way addresses issues of \ncorporate liability, and it should not therefore be presumed to alter state laws governing the liability of corporations \nvis a vis their officers and owners.” Id. (footnote omitted). \n  10 \n \n\n \n \n4  See, e.g., Lisa C. Goodheart & Karen A. McGuire, Revisiting the Issue of Causation in CERCLA Contribution Litigation, \n  82 Mass. L. Rev. 315, 319 (1998); Lemuel M. Srolovic & Pamela R. Esterman, Fold or Fight: The Changing Settlement \nCalculus in CERCLA Enforcement Actions, 9 Fordham Envtl. L.J. 469, 480–81 (1998). \n \n5  Although the district court relied on two Fifth Circuit cases in addition to the Acushnet decision to support its \n  causation requirement, those cases are inapposite. In Amoco Oil Co. v. Borden, Inc., 889 F.2d 664 (5th Cir.1989), \nAmoco sought a declaratory judgment that Borden, from which Amoco had purchased contaminated industrial \nproperty, was liable for response cost damages under CERCLA. Borden argued that it should not be held liable \nbecause the release that occurred was not sufficiently hazardous to justify any response costs; it thus argued that \nAmoco failed to prove the requisite causal nexus between the release and response costs. The Fifth Circuit agreed \nwith Borden that use of a “standard of justification” was acceptable for determining whether a release caused the \nincurrence of response costs: “[T]he question of whether a release has caused the incurrence of response costs \nshould rest upon a factual inquiry into the circumstances of a case and the relevant factual inquiry should focus on \nwhether the particular hazard justified any response actions.” Id. at 670. The Amoco case was concerned with the \nstatutory causation requirement (a causal nexus between the release and the incurrence of response costs), not the \ntype of causation requirement urged by the defendants in the instant case (a causal nexus between a specific \ndefendant’s release and the incurrence of response costs). In fact, the Amoco court specifically distinguished the \ncase before it from a case “involving multiple sources of contamination,” in which “a plaintiff need not prove a \nspecific causal link between costs incurred and an individual generator’s waste.” Id. at 670 n. 8. The Fifth Circuit’s \ndecision in Licciardi v. Murphy Oil U.S.A., Inc., 111 F.3d 396 (5th Cir.1997) (per curiam), simply applied the principles \nset forth in Amoco. \n \n6  Moreover, it is far from clear that the two analyses—liability and cost allocation—may properly be conflated even in \n  a trial that is not bifurcated. The First Circuit in Acushnet reasoned that “allowing a CERCLA defendant to prevail on \nissues of fair apportionment, even at the summary judgment stage, is consistent with Congress’s intent that joint \nand several liability not be imposed mechanically in all cases,” and that “the costs and inherent unfairness in \nsaddling a party who has contributed only trace amounts of hazardous waste with joint and several liability for all \ncosts incurred outweigh the public interest in requiring full contribution from de minimis polluters.” Acushnet, 191 \nF.3d at 78–79. However, we have stated that liability under § 113 is ordinarily not joint and several, but several only. \nSee Centerior, 153 F.3d at 348. There is therefore no possibility that a de minimis defendant will be saddled at the \napportionment stage with costs for which it is not responsible. \n \n7  Eaton argues that a one-time detection of PCBs in the plant’s effluent is insufficient to withstand a motion for \n  summary judgment because there is no evidence that such a result was typical of Eaton–Marshall’s effluent. \nHowever, one discharge is sufficient to support liability; there is no requirement that the generator typically \ndischarge waste to the site. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  11 \n ",
