The Court grants summary judgment for Plaintiffs on Counts I and II with respect to all challenged conditions, and on Count IV insofar as Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that Sections 1373 and 1644 violate the anticommandeering doctrine and the Attorney General cannot require compliance with these statutes as a condition of Byrne JAG funds. The Court dismisses Counts III and V as moot. Signed by the Honorable Harry D. Leinenweber on 9/26/2019: Mailed notice (maf) (Entered: 09/26/2019)"

    "summary": "<p>On July 16, 2018, the City of Evanston, Illinois, along with the U.S. Conference of Mayors, filed this lawsuit against the United States Department of Justice.  The plaintiffs sought to enjoin the DOJ from imposing three new conditions on the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program (Byrne JAG program), a federal grant program that provides crucial support for law enforcement in hundreds of cities nationwide. These three conditions would require that cities (1) give the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement 48 hours’ notice (or at least as much notice as practicable) prior to releasing any alien from custody (the “notice condition”); (2) give DHS officials unlimited access to local law enforcement facilities to interrogate any suspected noncitizen held there (the “access condition”); and (3) certify compliance with 8 U.S.C. §§ 1373 and 1644, which bar local governments from withholding immigration status information from the federal government (the “compliance condition”). </p><p>The plaintiffs sued the DOJ under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Declaratory Judgment Act, arguing that the DOJ lacked statutory authority to condition Byrne JAG funds on the notice, access, and compliance conditions, and that the conditions were arbitrary and capricious. Additionally, they argued that the three conditions amounted to improper usurpation of Congress’s spending power by the executive branch, thus violating separation of powers. Even if there were no separation-of-powers violation, the plaintiffs argued that Congress could not have authorized the three conditions because they did not satisfy Spending Clause requirements. The conditions also violated the Tenth Amendment’s anti-commandeering principle.  The plaintiffs sought a declaration that the DOJ’s requirements were unlawful, and sought an injunction preventing the DOJ from imposing the conditions. The case was originally assigned to Judge Charles R. Norgle, but was shortly thereafter reassigned to Judge Harry D. Leinenweber.</p><p>On July 20, 2018 the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction. On August 9, 2018, the court held that the plaintiffs had standing and issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the DOJ from attaching the three challenged conditions to grants awarded to the City of Evanston or to any member of the Conference of Mayors.  However, given a pending Seventh Circuit ruling on a nationwide injunction in a parallel case (<a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16080\"><i>City of Chicago v. Sessions</i></a>), the court stayed its injunction as applied to the Conference. The plaintiffs appealed the stay, which was lifted by the Seventh Circuit on August 29, 2018.</p><p>On October 5, 2018, the DOJ appealed the grant of the preliminary injunction to the Seventh Circuit. However, the parties filed a joint motion to hold appellate proceedings in abeyance, which was granted on October 15. </p><p>On December 10, 2018, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint challenging two additional conditions on Byrne JAG program funding: (1) the “questionnaire condition,” which required a city to answer questions about whether it had any policies about how employees may communicate with DHS or ICE and (2) the “harboring condition,” requiring cities to agree not to violate 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a) (a prohibition on hiding or harboring undocumented immigrants). </p><p>On February 11, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment. The court held a hearing on the plaintiffs’ motion on April 9, 2019. The DOJ then filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and for lack of jurisdiction, and in the alternative, for summary judgment.</p><p>The court denied the DOJ’s motion to dismiss on September 26, 2019. On the same day, the court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment with respect to the notice, access, compliance, and harboring conditions, as well as an additional certification requirement.  It granted a declaration that 8 U.S.C. §§1373 and 1644 violated the anti-commandeering doctrine, declaring that “the Attorney General cannot require compliance with these statutes as a condition” of funding.  The court also issued a permanent injunction prohibiting the Attorney General from imposing any of the challenged conditions in future grant years.  412 F.Supp.3d 873.  The DOJ appealed.</p><p>While the appeal was pending, the court granted a plaintiff motion for attorneys’ fees and expenses on April 23, 2020. It awarded $97,546.43 in attorneys’ fees and $283.75 in costs and expenses. On July 2, 2020, the court granted the plaintiffs an additional $21,953.38 in supplemental fees.</p><p>As of July 2020, the appeal is currently pending. </p>",

Case No. 18-cv-4853 \n   \nJEFFERSON BEAUREGARD SESSIONS III,   \nin his official capacity as Attorney General of   \nthe United States,     \n           \n        Defendant. \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n  The United States Conference of Mayors (the “Conference”) and the City of Evanston, \nIllinois (“Evanston”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”), for their complaint against defendant Jefferson \nBeauregard Sessions III (“Defendant” or the “Attorney General”), state as follows: \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  The Conference and Evanston bring this action to stop the federal government’s \naggressive and escalating effort to force cities into becoming the deportation arm of the federal \ngovernment. The Conference and Evanston seek to enjoin the Attorney General of the United \nStates from imposing three sweeping and unlawful conditions on the Edward Byrne Memorial \nJustice Assistance Grant Program (“Byrne JAG”)—an established federal grant program that \nprovides crucial support for law enforcement in hundreds of cities nationwide.  \n2.  The Department seeks to impose three conditions on the fiscal year (“FY”) 2017 \nByrne JAG funds under a cloud of uncertainty created by the Department’s increasingly \naggressive positions. As a condition of receiving FY 2017 Byrne JAG funds, the Department \nrequires that: (1) cities give the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), which includes U.S. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”), 48 hours’ notice, or at least as much notice “as \n-1- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/16/18 Page 2 of 33 PageID #:2\n  \npracticable” prior to releasing any alien in custody to allow ICE to take custody of that individual \n(the “notice condition”); (2) cities give DHS officials unlimited access to local law enforcement \nfacilities to interrogate any suspected non-citizen held there, effectively federalizing city \nfacilities (the “access condition”); and (3) the chief legal officer of each local government certify \ncompliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373 (“Section 1373”), a federal statute that purports to bar local \ngovernments from restricting the sharing of immigration status information with the federal \ngovernment (the “compliance condition”). \n3.  These three conditions are unauthorized and unconstitutional. The conditions also \nfly in the face of longstanding and diverse policies in Evanston and other Conference member \ncities that promote cooperation between immigrant communities and local law enforcement, \nensure access to essential services for all residents, and make residents safer. Compliance with \nthe conditions would require many applicants to violate local law, undermine public safety and \neffective policing in the cities, and undermine the cities’ policy choices. Neither federal law nor \nthe United States Constitution permits the Attorney General to dictate local policy by imposing \nunauthorized conditions on a critical source of local government funding. \n4.  The Department’s newly imposed conditions on Byrne JAG funds are also \ndirectly at odds with Conference policy resolutions, which collectively represent the views of the \nnation’s mayors. In 2017 and 2018, the Conference adopted policy resolutions addressed to the \nfederal government’s efforts to force localities to engage in federal immigration enforcement. \nThe resolutions called for: (a) an end to unconstitutional funding threats to cities in an effort to \ncoerce and compel them into implementing federal immigration law; (b) the end of the \nDepartment’s unconstitutionally broad interpretation of Section 1373; and (c) the award of Byrne \nJAG funds to municipalities without the imposition of unconstitutional conditions.  \n-2- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/16/18 Page 3 of 33 PageID #:3\n  \n5.  Because of the Department’s imposition of the notice, access, and compliance \nconditions, Evanston and the Conference’s other member cities face a Hobson’s choice: agree to \naccept the Department’s unconstitutional grant conditions or stand on their rights and forfeit \ncrucial Byrne JAG funds.  \n6.  The Conference and Evanston seek a declaration that the Department’s \ncompliance, notice, and access conditions on Byrne JAG funding are unlawful. The Conference \nand Evanston also seek an injunction preventing the Department from imposing the notice, \naccess, and compliance conditions on FY 2017 Byrne JAG funds, and from including the \nconditions in future applications and award documents. \nPARTIES \n7.  Plaintiff The United States Conference of Mayors is a non-profit association \norganized under the laws of Illinois and with its offices in the District of Columbia. As the \nofficial non-partisan organization of United States cities with populations of 30,000 or more, the \nConference represents the interests of over 1,400 cities in the United States. This includes \nnumerous cities in this federal district and in every other jurisdiction in the country. Nearly 150 \nmillion people reside in these cities.  \n8.  Plaintiff Evanston is a municipal corporation and home rule unit of government \norganized and existing under the constitution and laws of the State of Illinois. Evanston was \nincorporated in 1857, and is home to approximately 74,895 residents, including a vibrant \nimmigrant community.  \n9.  Defendant Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III is the Attorney General of the \nUnited States. He is sued in his official capacity. The Attorney General is the federal official in \ncharge of the United States Department of Justice, which took, and threatens imminently to take, \nthe governmental actions at issue in this lawsuit. \n-3- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/16/18 Page 4 of 33 PageID #:4\n  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n10.  The Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1346. The \nCourt is authorized to issue the relief sought here under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 \nU.S.C. §§ 702, 705, 706, and the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201, 2202. \n11.  Venue is proper in the Northern District of Illinois under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e). \nDefendant is a United States officer being sued in his official capacity. Evanston resides in this \njudicial district and substantial events giving rise to this action occurred in this judicial district. \nThe Conference consents to adjudication of these issues in this district. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  The Byrne JAG program provides critical funds to cities.  \n12.  Congress established the Byrne JAG program in 2005 to serve as the primary \nsource of federal criminal justice funding for states and localities. The Office of Justice Programs \n(“OJP”) within the Department oversees the program.  \n13.  The goal of the Byrne JAG program is to allow states and local governments the \n“flexibility to spend money for programs that work for them rather than to impose a ‘one size fits \nall’ solution” for local policing. See H.R. Rep. No. 109-233, at 89 (2005).1 To that end, the \nByrne JAG program is structured as a formula grant, which awards funds to all eligible grantees \naccording to a prescribed formula. See 34 U.S.C. § 10156(d)(2)(A) (providing that the Attorney \nGeneral “shall allocate to each unit of local government” funds consistent with the established \nformula).  \n                                                 \n1 The Byrne JAG program was created in the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice \nReauthorization Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-162, 119 Stat. 2960 (2006), which in turn amended the \nOmnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, Pub. L. No. 90-351, 82 Stat. 197. \n-4- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/16/18 Page 5 of 33 PageID #:5\n  \n14.  Byrne JAG funds are distributed across states and localities based on their \npopulation and relative levels of violent crime. The Byrne JAG distribution formula for states is \na function of population and violent crime. 34 U.S.C. § 10156(a). The formula for local \ngovernments is a function of the state’s allocation and the ratio of violent crime in the locality to \nviolent crime in the state. Id. § 10156(d).  \n15.  The formula-based approach entitles cities to their share of the Byrne JAG \nformula allocation so long as their proposed programs meet at least one of eight broadly defined \ngoals, see 34 U.S.C. § 10152(a)(1)(A)-(H) (listing eligible programs such as general law \nenforcement, prevention and education, drug treatment, and mental health), and their \napplications contain a series of statutorily required certifications and attestations. Id. § 10153(a). \nB.  The Conference was formed to address the intersection of federal and local \npolicy and has resolved to oppose the Attorney General’s actions.  \n16.  In 1932, during the midst of the Great Depression, the nation’s cities were close to \nbankruptcy and their residents were largely unemployed and without access to sufficient food, \nhousing, law enforcement, and other necessities. In response to the appeals of mayors across the \ncountry, Congress created a $300 million federal assistance program for cities, marking the first \ntime in the nation’s history that federal relief was provided directly to cities. A few weeks later, \nthe Conference was founded to coordinate its cities’ interactions with the federal government. \n17.  Today the Conference’s member cities are home to immigrant populations that \nare both recent arrivals and multigenerational families. The Conference proudly recognizes that \ncities are diverse, multicultural centers, and that their diversity reflects core American values, \nfosters economic prosperity and opportunity, enriches cities’ cultures, and keeps our nation \ncompetitive and strong. \n-5- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/16/18 Page 6 of 33 PageID #:6\n  \n18.  The Conference’s primary roles include promoting the development of effective \nnational city and metro-area-focused policy; strengthening federal-city relationships; ensuring \nthat federal policy meets urban needs; providing mayors with leadership and management tools \nthat allow them to do their jobs better; and creating a forum in which mayors share ideas, \ninformation, and best practices, and through which cities coordinate on shared policy goals. \n19.  Conference members speak with a united voice on organizational policies and \ngoals. Mayors contribute to the development of national urban policy by serving on one or more \nof the Conference’s standing committees or in another leadership role. A list of member cities \nwhose mayors currently serve in leadership roles is attached as Exhibit A to this complaint. \n20.  The adoption of a resolution is the principal means by which the Conference \nspeaks on matters of policy. The policy positions adopted at the annual meeting collectively \nrepresent the views of the nation’s mayors.  \n21.  Conference members met from June 23-26, 2017 for the 2017 annual meeting. \nThe meeting was attended by over 250 mayors from cities across the country, including those \nfrom nearly every state and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. \n22.  At the annual meeting, the Conference’s members passed three resolutions \nrecognizing the importance of immigrants to their communities, supporting immigrant rights, \nstanding against policies that target immigrant communities, and opposing the administration’s \npunitive welcoming city policies.  \n23.  First, the Conference passed a resolution titled “Opposing Punitive Sanctuary \nJurisdiction Policies.” (A true and correct copy of this resolution is attached as Exhibit B to this \ncomplaint.)  \n-6- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/16/18 Page 7 of 33 PageID #:7\n  \n24.  This resolution reflected the Conference members’ considered judgment that, \namong other things: \n(a)  Many local jurisdictions determined that their local law enforcement efforts and \npersonnel have neither the authority, the priority, nor the resources to serve as \nimmigration enforcement officers; \n(b)  Trust between local law enforcement and the communities they serve is critical to \npreventing, solving, and prosecuting crimes, and many jurisdictions determined \nthat having local law enforcement officers serve as immigration officers would \nbreak that trust; \n(c)  Many local jurisdictions and authorities lack the law enforcement resources to act \nas immigration officers at the expense of local law enforcement priorities; and  \n(d)  Cities and other local government entities must have the discretion to make \nindividualized determinations relative to local values, expenditure of resources, \npriorities, and liabilities assumed, all taking into account that immigrants residing \nin the nation’s cities must be able to trust all of city government that their Fourth \nAmendment rights will be guaranteed, and that local law enforcement efforts to \nbuild trust and supportive relationships with all communities are essential to \npreventing and prosecuting crime and helping victims. \n (Ex. B at 1-2.) \n \n25.  Accordingly, the Conference resolved to: \n(a)  Oppose punitive sanctuary jurisdiction policies that limit local control and \ndiscretion; \n(b)  Urge Congress, the administration, and states to pursue immigration enforcement \npolicies that recognize that local law enforcement has limited resources and \ncommunity trust is critical to local law enforcement and community safety; and \n(c)  Oppose federal and state policies that commandeer local law enforcement or \nrequire local authorities to (i) violate, or be placed at risk of violating, a person’s \nFourth Amendment rights; (ii) expend limited resources to act as immigration \nagents; or (iii) otherwise assist federal immigration authorities beyond what is \ndetermined by local policy. \n(Id. at 2-3.) \n \n26.  Second, the Conference passed a resolution titled “Supporting Immigrants, \nRefugees and Asylum Seekers and Standing Against Discriminatory and Harmful Policies that \n-7- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/16/18 Page 8 of 33 PageID #:8\n  \nTarget These Vulnerable Communities.” (A true and correct copy of this resolution is attached as \nExhibit C to this complaint.) This resolution recognized that cities across America are home to \nimmigrant populations, including recent arrivals and multigenerational families; that immigrants \ncontribute to cities in important ways; and that the administration has nonetheless antagonized \nand intimidated immigrant communities through executive orders and by threatening punitive \nactions against welcoming cities. (Ex. C at 1.) The Conference thus resolved to call on Congress \nto act against policies that discriminate against and target immigrants, and to oppose “the \nAdministration’s efforts to hold immigrants hostage as bargaining chips to threaten withholding \nfederal funding from cities across the nation.” (Id. at 1-2.) \n27.  Third, the Conference passed a resolution titled “Supporting Immigrant Rights.” \n(A true and correct copy of this resolution is attached as Exhibit D to this complaint.) This \nresolution recognized that the United States is enriched by the diversity of immigrants; that cities \nare diverse, multicultural centers that reflect core American values and foster economic \nprosperity; and that data shows that welcoming cities are stronger economically and safer than \nother cities. (Ex. D at 1.) In addition, the resolution recognized that the federal government seeks \nto restrict funding to welcoming jurisdictions and coerce cities into becoming the deportation \narm of the federal government, which undermines mayors’ abilities to ensure community safety \nby eroding trust between local law enforcement and residents. (Id. at 1-2.) The Conference thus \nresolved to “call for an end to unconstitutional federal funding threats to states and local \ngovernments in an effort to coerce and compel them into implementing federal immigration \nlaw,” and to “urge members of Congress to withdraw legislation that attempts to cut local law \nenforcement funding necessary to ensure the safety of our communities.” (Id. at 2.) \n-8- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/16/18 Page 9 of 33 PageID #:9\n  \n28.  From June 8-11, 2018, Conference members met in Boston for this year’s annual \nmeeting. More than 240 mayors from cities across the country attended, including those from \nnearly every state and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.   \n29.  At the 2018 annual meeting, the Conference’s members adopted an additional \nresolution, titled “Opposing Unconstitutional Requirements Placed on Byrne JAG Funding and \nUrging the Immediate Awarding of FY 2017 Byrne JAG Grants.” (A true and correct copy of \nthis resolution is attached as Exhibit E to this complaint.) The resolution stated that cities “will \nnot be bullied, intimidated or coerced into making a false choice between grants with offensive \nconditions attached, on the one hand, and our values as welcoming cit[ies] and the principles of \ncommunity policing, on the other.” (Ex. E at 1.) The resolution recognized that the Department \ndoes not have the authority to impose new conditions on a grant program created by Congress \nand “cannot commandeer local law enforcement to carry out federal immigration law functions.” \n(Id. at 2.) The Conference resolved to call on the Department “to award Byrne JAG funds to \nmunicipalities without imposing additional unconstitutional conditions.” (Id. at 3.) \n30.  Each of these resolutions passed with a wide majority of the Conference members \npresent for the annual meetings. In fact, after conclusion of a vote on a proposed resolution that \npasses, a member mayor who attended the vote may request to be recorded as having voted “No” \non that specific resolution. Only five mayors in attendance at the annual meeting recorded a no \nvote as to any of the three 2017 resolutions. Only one mayor in attendance at the 2018 annual \nmeeting recorded a no vote as to the 2018 resolution.  \nC.  Conference members rely on Byrne JAG funds. \n31.  Many Conference members rely on Byrne JAG funds for critical law enforcement \nneeds in their cities. (See, e.g., Ex. A.) As such, the Conference has long supported the Byrne \n-9- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/16/18 Page 10 of 33 PageID #:10\n  \nJAG program. 2 Over the past decade, Conference members have routinely applied for and \nreceived those funds.  \n32.  Evanston, a Conference member, first received Byrne JAG funds in 2009 and has \nreceived funds every year since. Evanston uses Byrne JAG funds to train officers through the \nPolice Learning Institute, pay personnel, and to purchase equipment. In FY 2016, Evanston \nreceived $14,685 through the Byrne JAG program. \n33.  Evanston receives its Byrne JAG funds through the application submitted by \nChicago, Illinois. Because Chicago’s costs of preventing and investigating violent crimes exceed \nthose of surrounding jurisdictions, 34 U.S.C. § 10156(d)(4) obligates Chicago to file a Byrne \nJAG application on behalf of itself and other, neighboring communities, including Evanston. \n34.  Many of the Conference’s members use Byrne JAG funds for diverse purposes, \nreflecting both the varied law enforcement needs of different communities and Congress’s intent \nto preserve local discretion and flexibility in Byrne JAG-funded law enforcement programs. \nThese include, for example, the following Conference members: \n(a)  Iowa City, Iowa (population 74,398) uses Byrne JAG funds to promote traffic \nsafety, to establish a search and rescue program aimed at individuals at risk for \nwandering, to partially fund a drug task force, and to purchase equipment. \n(b)  Los Angeles, California (population 3,792,621) uses Byrne JAG funds for its \nCommunity Law Enforcement and Recovery (CLEAR) program, which aims to \nreduce gang violence in the city and rehabilitate communities that experienced \nsignificant crime. The program promotes and funds special criminal investigative \nunits, an aggressive vertical prosecutorial program, probation and parole officers, \nyouth intervention organizations, and schools. \n(c)  New Orleans, Louisiana (population 391,495) uses Byrne JAG funds on gun \nviolence reduction initiatives, alternatives to incarceration for municipal court, \ndiversion programs for eligible defendants with mental illness, pre-trial and \nprobation advocacy, domestic violence monitoring court, and technology \n                                                 \n2 See The U.S. Conference of Mayors, Public Safety First Resolution, June 2012, available at \nhttp://www.greenandhealthyhomes.org/sites/default/files/AdoptedResolutionsFull1.pdf. \n-10- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/16/18 Page 11 of 33 PageID #:11\n  \nupgrades including body cameras and audio surveillance equipment for its police \nforce. \n(d)  New York, New York (population 8,175,133) uses Byrne JAG funds to support a \nwide range of programs, including efforts to improve the collection, organization \nand evaluation of criminal justice data; a specialized unit that investigates illegal \nhotels, building violations, and illegal adult establishments; initiatives to reduce \nthe number of people with mental and behavioral needs who cycle through the \ncriminal justice system by connecting them with interventions and services; and \ninitiatives to ensure the safety of students and reduce crime in schools. In \naddition, the City’s five District Attorneys use Byrne JAG funds to support many \nprograms, including the Kings County Drug Treatment Alternative-to-Prison \nprogram, which diverts hundreds of nonviolent offenders to community-based \nresidential drug treatment programs, and the New York County Cybercrime and \nIdentity Theft Bureau, which protects the public and institutions from organized \ncybercrime and identity theft schemes. \n(e)  Portland, Oregon (population 639,863) has used Byrne JAG funds to support its \nNew Options for Women (NOW) program, which provides services to women \nwho experienced sexual exploitation while working in the commercial sex \nindustry. \n(f)  Providence, Rhode Island (population 178,042) uses Byrne JAG funds to pay \npersonnel to conduct targeted enforcement patrols and to contract with Family \nService of Rhode Island for the services of a part-time Bilingual Police Liaison.  \n(g)  Sacramento, California (population 493,025) uses Byrne JAG funds to support the \nongoing maintenance and operations of its Police Department’s helicopter \nprogram. \n35.  Many other Conference members receive Byrne JAG funds and use them for still \ndifferent, but no less critical, law enforcement purposes. These members include cities listed \nseparately on Exhibit A, and many other cities like them. \nD.  The Conference, Evanston, and other Conference members promote policies \nof cooperation between local law enforcement and immigrants. \n36.  In exercising its discretion over local law enforcement policy, Evanston made the \nconsidered judgment that devoting local resources to immigration enforcement would be \ndetrimental to community safety, and that concerns for safety are best addressed by promoting a \n-11- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/16/18 Page 12 of 33 PageID #:12\n  \npolicy of cooperation between local law enforcement and immigrants. This policy judgment is \ncodified in Evanston’s “Welcoming City Ordinance.” See Evanston City Code § 1-22. \n37.  Evanston’s Welcoming City Ordinance reflects the Evanston City Council’s \nfindings that “the cooperation of all persons, both documented citizens and those without \ndocumentation status, is essential to achieve the City’s goals of protecting life and property, \npreventing crime and resolving problems” and that one of Evanston’s “most important goals is to \nenhance the City’s relationship with the immigrant communities.” Id. § 1-22-2.  \n38.  In its current form, the Welcoming City Ordinance, codified as Chapter 22 of the \nEvanston City Code, contains several key provisions relevant to this lawsuit, including: \n(a)  Subject to certain exceptions, no Evanston agent or agency shall “[s]top, arrest, \nsearch, detain or continue to detain a person solely on the belief that the person is \nnot present legally in the United States, or that the person has committed a civil \nimmigration violation.” §1-22-10(A)(1). \n(b)  Subject to certain exceptions, no Evanston agent or agency shall “[d]etain, or \ncontinue to detain, a person based upon an immigration detainer, when such \nimmigration detainer is based solely on a violation of a civil immigration law.”    \n§ 1-22-10(A)(3). \n(c)  Nothing in section 1-22-10 “prohibits communication between federal agencies or \nofficials and law enforcement or officials.” §1-22-10(D). \n(d)  Except as otherwise provided by federal law, no Evanston agent or agency shall \ndisclose citizenship or immigration status information “unless required to do so \nby legal process or such disclosure has been authorized in writing by the \nindividual to whom such information pertains.” § 1-22-8. \n39.  These and the other provisions of the Welcoming City Ordinance play a vital role \nin strengthening the relationship between Evanston’s government, its police force, and its \nimmigrant community. It is essential that Evanston’s police officers have the flexibility needed \nto engage the immigrant community in their crime-fighting initiatives without projecting a \nconstant threat of deportation.  \n-12- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/16/18 Page 13 of 33 PageID #:13\n  \n40.  Evanston is not alone. Many other Conference members have adopted similar \npolicies. These include, for example, Gary, Indiana; Los Angeles, California; New Orleans, \nLouisiana; New York, New York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Providence, Rhode Island. 3 \n41.  Welcoming city policies and similar policies are sound. One study found that \n“crime is statistically significantly lower in sanctuary counties compared to nonsanctuary \ncounties . . . controlling for population characteristics.”4 Indeed, a broad coalition of police \nchiefs explained that “build[ing] trusting and supportive relations with immigrant communities . . \n. is essential to reducing crime and helping victims.”5 \n42.  Welcoming city policies are rooted in the judgment that restricting entanglement \nwith ICE secures and enhances community trust in local law enforcement. Local law \nenforcement relies upon all community members (regardless of immigration status) to report \ncrimes, serve as witnesses, and assist in investigations and prosecutions. Indeed, in the \nConference members’ experience, even the perception that local law enforcement is assisting in \nimmigration enforcement can erode trust, disrupt lines of communication, and make law \nenforcement’s job much more difficult.  \n                                                 \n3 Gary – Ordinance No. 9100; The Los Angeles Police Department & Federal Immigration Enforcement: \nFrequently Asked Questions, available at http://assets.lapdonline.org/assets/pdf/immigrationfaq.pdf; New \nOrleans – New Orleans Police Department Operations Manual, Chapter 41.6.1, available at \nhttps://www.nola.gov/getattachment/NOPD/NOPD-Consent-Decree/Chapter-41-6-1-Immigration-Status-\napproval.pdf/; New York – Executive Order Nos. 34 and 41, available at \nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/assets/immigrants/downloads/pdf/eo-34.pdf and \nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/assets/immigrants/downloads/pdf/eo-41.pdf; Philadelphia – Executive Order No. \n16, available at https://www.ilrc.org/sites/default/files/resources/2016-01_philadelphia_pep_order.pdf; \nProvidence – Resolution of the City Council, available at \nhttps://www.ilrc.org/sites/default/files/resources/providence_resolution.pdf. \n4 Tom K.

For these reasons, the Conference has for years opposed the federal government’s \nattempts to penalize cities that adopt welcoming city policies such as those cited above. In 2015, \nfor example, the Conference opposed Senate Bill 2146, the “Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect \nAmericans Act,” which proposed to deny Community Development Block Grants and other \nfederal aid to cities that adopted policies like those identified above.  \n44.  Shifting the federal responsibility of enforcing civil immigration law to local \ngovernments diverts critical resources from their law enforcement agencies, compromises public \nsafety, and hinders local police department policies. The Conference continues to oppose similar \nlegislation when proposed (none of which Congress passed).  \nE.  The Department imposed three unlawful conditions on FY 2017 Byrne JAG \nfunds. \n45.  For over a decade, the Department administered the Byrne JAG program as \nCongress intended: funding critical local law enforcement initiatives without seeking to leverage \nfunding to conscript local agencies to enforce federal immigration law. But now the Department \nseeks to impose three conditions on FY 2017 Byrne JAG funds under a cloud of uncertainty \ncreated by the Department’s increasingly aggressive positions: (1) the notice condition; (2) the \naccess condition; and (3) the compliance condition. Each condition is unauthorized and unlawful. \n1.  The notice condition \n46.  The FY 2017 Byrne JAG solicitation stated that the awards would be conditioned \non grant applicants providing “at least 48 hours’ advance notice to DHS regarding the scheduled \nrelease date and time of an alien in the jurisdiction’s custody when DHS requests such notice in \norder to take custody of the alien pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act.” (A true and \ncorrect copy of the U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant \n-14- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/16/18 Page 15 of 33 PageID #:15\n  \nProgram FY 2017 Local Solicitation is attached as Exhibit F and is available at \nhttps://www.bja.gov/Funding/JAGLocal17.pdf. The quoted language is found at page 30.)  \n47.  The FY 2017 Byrne JAG award documents, which the Department recently sent \njurisdictions around the country, revise and expand on what the notice condition entails. From \nthe date a city accepts the award and throughout the time of the award’s performance, each city \nmust have in place an “ordinance, -rule, -regulation, -policy, or -practice . . . designed to ensure \nthat, when a local-government (or local-government-contracted) correctional facility receives \nfrom DHS a formal written request . . . that seeks advance notice of the scheduled release date \nand time for a particular alien in such facility, then such facility will honor such request and – as \nearly as practicable . . . provide the requested notice to DHS.” (A true and correct copy of the \nDepartment’s sample award document is attached as Exhibit G and is available at \nhttps://www.bja.gov/Jag/SampleAwardDocument/. The quoted language is found at page 19.) \nThe award document specifies that DHS currently requests notice “as early as practicable (at \nleast 48 hours, if possible).” (Ex. G at 18.) \n2.  The access condition \n48.  The FY 2017 Byrne JAG solicitation stated that the awards would also be \nconditioned on grant applicants permitting “personnel of the [DHS] to access any correctional or \ndetention facility in order to meet with an alien (or an individual believed to be an alien) and \ninquire as to his or her right to be or remain in the United States.” (Ex. F at 30.) The requirement \nappears to mandate that federal immigration agents be given unprecedented and unfettered \naccess to local law enforcement facilities and to any person being held there.  \n49.  The FY 2017 Byrne JAG award documents revise and expand on what the notice \ncondition entails. From the date a city accepts the award and throughout the time of the award’s \nperformance, each city must have in place an “ordinance, -rule, -regulation, -policy, or -practice . \n-15- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/16/18 Page 16 of 33 PageID #:16\n  \n. . designed to ensure that [any, not just DHS] agents of the United States are given access [to] a \nlocal-government (or local-government-contracted) correctional facility” to permit the federal \n“agents to meet with individuals who are (or are believed by such agents to be) aliens and to \ninquire as to such individuals’ right to be or remain in the United States.” (Ex. G at 19.) \n3.  The compliance condition \n50.  The FY 2017 Byrne JAG solicitation stated that to validly accept an award, a \nlocal government must certify compliance with Section 1373. In fact, the application required \ncertifications by both a city’s chief legal officer and its chief executive. (Ex. F at 22-23.) \n51.  Section 1373 provides that state and local entities may not “prohibit, or in any \nway restrict” their entities and officials from sending or receiving citizenship or immigration \nstatus information from or to DHS. 8 U.S.C. § 1373(a). Section 1373 further states that no person \nor agency may “prohibit, or in any way restrict” state and local entities from sending, requesting, \nor receiving immigration status information from or to DHS; maintaining immigration status \ninformation; or exchanging immigration status information with other entities. 8 U.S.C. § \n1373(b).  \n52.  The FY 2017 Byrne JAG award documents revise and expand on what the \ncompliance condition entails. The compliance condition is set forth in three separate award \nconditions⸻ Conditions 52, 53, and 54. Condition 52 requires a local government to submit a \ncertification of compliance with Section 1373 signed by the chief legal officer. (Ex. G at 15.) \nCondition 53 requires ongoing compliance with Section 1373, and requires subrecipients (i.e., \nthose who receive their funds through another applicant) to certify compliance with Section \n1373. (Id. at 16.) \n-16- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/16/18 Page 17 of 33 PageID #:17\n  \nF.  The conditions are ambiguous, arbitrary, and without justification. \n53.  The Department imposed the notice, access, and compliance conditions without \nany explanation, reasoning, or opportunity for exchange with local governments or law \nenforcement. In early July 2017, after demanding that cities justify their compliance with \nSection 1373, the Department cryptically announced that “[s]ome” jurisdictions “potentially \nviolate” Section 1373, without indicating which certifications it found lacking and without \nidentifying any defect.6  \n54.  In late July 2017, shortly before the Byrne JAG application for FY 2017 was set \nto go online, the Department suddenly announced significant changes to the Byrne JAG \napplication process in a two-paragraph press release and accompanying press “backgrounder” \ndocument.7 The Department’s press release failed to explain how the Department arrived at the \nnew conditions or what alternatives it considered. The press release was silent as to the Byrne \nJAG program’s purpose and how the notice, access, and compliance conditions relate to, let \nalone serve to advance, the program’s interests. The Department also failed to provide any \nguidance as to how the conditions will operate in practice.  \n55.  The notice, access, and compliance conditions are ambiguous, leaving cities \nuncertain as to how to comply. The ambiguity threatens to induce unconstitutional action. For \nexample, the notice condition would require cities to detain individuals longer than they \notherwise would, potentially violating the individuals’ Fourth Amendment rights and state law \nand thereby expose these cities to liability; the access condition would demand that cities open \n                                                 \n6 Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Department of Justice Reviewing Letters from Ten Potential \nSanctuary Jurisdictions (July 6, 2017), http://tinyurl.com/ybdhf7vy. \n7 See Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Attorney General Sessions Announces Immigration \nCompliance Requirements for Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Programs (July 25, \n2017), https://tinyurl.com/y9ttqhsl; U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Backgrounder on Grant Requirements, \nhttps://tinyurl.com/ycfgbgl4. \n-17- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/16/18 Page 18 of 33 PageID #:18\n  \ntheir facilities to federal officials without regard to local detention needs. Evanston Police \nDepartment regulations and those of many Conference member cities’ police forces require that \nindividuals arrested without a warrant be released or transferred to court without unnecessary \ndelay, but in any event no later than 48 hours after arrest. See, e.g., Evanston Police Department \nPolicy Manual § 900.3. Such matters are also informed by the law of many states, which require \nthat certain detainees be released within 48 hours. See, e.g., Ill. Admin. Code §§ 720.30, \n720.150.  \n56.  Just as fundamentally, complying with the notice and access conditions would \nundermine public safety. Welcoming city policies assist effective policing by building trust \nbetween law enforcement officers and the immigrant community. Conversely, policing suffers \nwhen community members, whatever their immigration status, do not feel free to report crimes, \nassist in investigations, or testify as witnesses. The Department’s insistence that cities nationwide \ngive immigration enforcement agents on-demand access to their detention facilities to investigate \npotential civil immigration violations, and that cities detain individuals solely so to allow the \ninvestigation of possible civil immigration violations, undermines crucial public trust, cuts local \nlaw enforcement efforts off at the knees, and makes everyone in these cities less safe. \nG.  The Department lacks any authority to impose the three conditions.  \n57.  No legal basis exists for the three conditions. The Byrne JAG statute gives the \nDepartment no authority to impose the notice, access, and compliance conditions on Byrne JAG \nfunds. Congress repeatedly demonstrates its ability (when it so desires) to expressly confer \nagency discretion to add substantive conditions to federal grants. In the same statute that includes \nthe Byrne JAG grant, the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, Congress \ncreated a different grant program that expressly authorized administering agencies to impose \nreasonable grant conditions. See 34 U.S.C. § 10446(e)(3) (Attorney General may “impose \n-18- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/16/18 Page 19 of 33 PageID #:19\n  \nreasonable conditions on grant awards . . . .”). And Congress expressly conferred such authority \nin other federal grant programs. See, e.g., 47 U.S.C. § 1204(b)(2) (Under Secretary of Commerce \ncan “establish such conditions . . . as may be appropriate to ensure the efficiency and integrity of \nthe grant program”); 25 U.S.C. § 1652(b) (similar). \n58.  The Byrne JAG statute gives the Attorney General limited ministerial authority to \nspecify the “form” of the application, 34 U.S.C. § 10153(A) (requiring jurisdictions to submit an \napplication containing the enumerated components “in such form as the Attorney General may \nrequire”). However, the statute nowhere authorizes the Attorney General or the Department to \nimpose additional substantive conditions to the application. Indeed, doing so would upend \nCongress’s formula approach for distributing funds based on population and violent crime, and \ninstead allocate grants using criteria invented by the Department.  \n59.  Although the Byrne JAG statute requires that grantees comply with “all \napplicable Federal laws,” that phrase refers to the host of laws that regulate the conduct of \nfederal grant recipients as grant recipients.8 It does not refer to every section of the U.S. Code \nthat could possibly apply to a state or local government. Section 1373 does not regulate grantees \nas grantees nor do its terms mention federal grants or funds. In fact, none of the three conditions \nconcerns applicable federal requirements. Each condition addresses civil immigration \n                                                 \n8 See, e.g., 41 U.S.C. § 4712(a)(1) (“An employee of a contractor, subcontractor, grantee, or subgrantee or \npersonal services contractor may not be discharged, demoted, or otherwise discriminated against as a \nreprisal for disclosing to a person or body . . . information that the employee reasonably believes is \nevidence of gross mismanagement of a Federal contract or grant, a gross waste of Federal funds . . . .”); \n42 U.S.C. § 2000d (“No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, \nbe excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any \nprogram or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”); 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (“No otherwise qualified \nindividual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity \nreceiving Federal financial assistance or under any program or activity conducted by any Executive \nagency or by the United States Postal Service.”).  \n-19- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/16/18 Page 20 of 33 PageID #:20\n  \nenforcement, which is wholly inapplicable to criminal justice grants. In addition, there is no \nfederal law requiring cities to provide ICE with “at least 48 hours’ advance notice” before \nreleasing anyone in custody, and no federal law requires local police departments to give DHS \nofficials access to detention facilities. \n60.  In fact, Congress considered, but did not pass, legislation that would penalize \ncities for seeking to set their own law enforcement priorities. See Stop Sanctuary Policies and \nProtect Americans Act, S. 2146, 114th Cong. (2015) (proposing funding cuts for any sanctuary \njurisdiction that violates Section 1373 or “prohibits any government entity or official from \ncomplying with a detainer”). Notably, however, Congress never passed legislation authorizing \nthe executive branch to impose any penalty on local jurisdictions based on the refusal to comply \nwith detainer or other immigration enforcement requests. \n61.  The notice, access, and compliance conditions represent a sharp break with past \nagency practice. The Department never before imposed any conditions of this nature on Byrne \nJAG funds.  \n62.  The three conditions also violate core constitutional principles. Separation of \npowers principles operate as independent restraints on cooperative federalism arrangements like \nthe Byrne JAG program. The Constitution gives the spending power to Congress, not the \nexecutive branch. Federal agencies therefore may not invent funding conditions out of whole \ncloth.  \n63.  The notice, access, and compliance conditions also run afoul of the Tenth \nAmendment. The anti-commandeering principle ensures that the sovereign states are free to \nlegislate as they see fit to promote the safety and welfare of their residents. The principle forbids \n-20- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/16/18 Page 21 of 33 PageID #:21\n  \nCongress to “unequivocally dictate[] what a state [or local] legislature may and may not do.” \nMurphy v. NCAA, 138 S. Ct. 1461, 1478 (2018).  \n64.  Section 1373 “unequivocally dictates” to cities that they may not promulgate \npolicies or regulations that prohibit local officials from sharing immigration status information \nwith federal officials. Id.; see, e.g., City of Philadelphia v. Sessions, No. 17-3894, 2018 WL \n2725503, at *28-33 (E.D. Pa. June 6, 2018); accord United States v. California, No. 2:18-cv-\n490-JAM-KJN, 2018 WL 3301414, at *14 (E.D. Cal. July 5, 2018) (“The Court finds the \nconstitutionality of Section 1373 highly suspect.”). \n65.  The notice and access conditions “unequivocally dictate[]” to cities that they must \nenact ordinances or policies concerning the administration of detention facilities and providing \nadvance notification to federal officials. The notice condition seeks to fundamentally reorganize \nthe way the Conference’s members balance their Fourth Amendment obligations against their \ninterest in effective law enforcement. The access condition requires a fundamental restructuring \nof police procedures and functions to accommodate on-demand access to detainees by federal \nagents. The federalization of bedrock local government functions violates the Tenth \nAmendment’s anti-commandeering principle. See Murphy, 138 S. Ct. at 1477 (“The Federal \nGovernment may not command the States’ officers, or those of their political subdivisions, to \nadminister or enforce a federal regulatory program.”) (quoting Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. \n898, 935 (1997)). \nH.  The Department’s unlawful conditions will injure Evanston and the \nConference’s other members, forcing them to choose between vital law \nenforcement funding and their constitutional rights. \n66.  Evanston and the Conference’s other members now face an impossible choice: \nsacrifice their sovereignty and their residents’ safety by acceding to unlawful funding demands \nthat will undermine community-officer trust and cooperation, or forfeit crucial monies used to \n-21- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/16/18 Page 22 of 33 PageID #:22\n  \nfund essential policing operations. The Department cannot force the Conference’s members to \nchoose between their right to exercise municipal sovereignty and their right to receive formula \ngrant funds that Congress allocated to them. \n67.  The importance of Byrne JAG funds and the choice cities now face is underscored \nby the number of local governments challenging the conditions. In August 2017, the City of \nChicago, a member of the Conference, filed a lawsuit challenging the three unauthorized and \nunconstitutional Byrne JAG conditions. City of Chicago v. Sessions, Case No. 17-cv-5720 (N.D. \nIll.) (Leinenweber, J.) In addition to Chicago, the State of Illinois, City of Philadelphia, City and \nCounty of San Francisco, City of Los Angeles, State of California, and City of West Palm Beach \nfiled lawsuits challenging the Byrne JAG conditions.9 \n68.  On September 15, 2017, the district court granted Chicago’s motion for a \nnationwide preliminary injunction as to the notice and access conditions because Chicago was \nlikely to succeed on its claims that the Department lacked the authority to impose those \nconditions. City of Chicago v. Sessions, 264 F. Supp. 3d 933, 943, 951 (N.D. Ill. 2017) (“The \nnotice and access conditions exceed statutory authority, and, consequently, the efforts to impose \nthem violate the separation of powers doctrine and are ultra vires.”).  \n69.  On September 26, 2017, the Attorney General filed a motion to stay the \nnationwide preliminary injunction. Chicago, No. 17-cv-5720, Dkt. 80. Two days later, on \nSeptember 28, 2017, counsel for the Conference appeared at the presentment of the Attorney \nGeneral’s motion to stay and alerted the court that the Conference intended to seek leave to \n                                                 \n9 State of Illinois v.

Id., Dkt. \n91. \n70.  On November 16, 2017, the district court denied the Conference’s motion to \nintervene. At that time, the district court explained that the Conference “can represent the \ninterests of its members who may suffer an impending injury caused by the defendant’s acts.” \nChicago, 2017 WL 5499167, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 16, 2017). However, the court denied \nintervention because the nationwide injunction in place at the time protected the Conference’s \nmember cities’ interests. Id. at *9-10 (“Unless and until the status of the nationwide injunction \nchanges, there is no reason to permit an intervention that will further complicate this litigation.”).  \n71.  On April 19, 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit \naffirmed the district court’s grant of a nationwide injunction as to the notice and access \nconditions. City of Chicago v. Sessions, 888 F.3d 272, 293 (7th Cir. 2018). The panel \nunanimously concluded that “the district court did not err in determining that the City established \na likelihood of success on the merits of its contention that the Attorney General lacked the \nauthority to impose the notice and access conditions on receipt of the Byrne JAG grants,” and \ntwo of the three judges held that the district court “did not abuse its discretion in granting the \nnationwide preliminary injunction.” Id. \n72.  The Attorney General subsequently filed a petition for rehearing en banc as to the \nscope of the preliminary injunction. Chicago, No. 17-2991, Dkt. 119. Notably, the Attorney \nGeneral did not request rehearing on the Seventh Circuit’s decision that Chicago established a \nlikelihood of success on its claims that the Attorney General lacked authority to impose the \nnotice and access conditions. \n-23- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/16/18 Page 24 of 33 PageID #:24\n  \n73.  On June 4, 2018, the Seventh Circuit voted to partially rehear the case en banc \n“only as to the geographic scope of the preliminary injunction entered by the district court.” \nChicago, No. 17-2991, Dkt. 128. On June 26, 2018, the Court stayed the preliminary injunction \nissued by the district court “as to geographic areas in the United States beyond the City of \nChicago pending the disposition of the case by the en banc court.” Chicago, No. 17-2991, Dkt. \n134.  \n74.  Even though the Attorney General did not appeal the Seventh Circuit’s decision \nthat Chicago was likely to succeed on the merits of its claims that the Attorney General lacks the \nauthority to impose the notice and access conditions, the Department began issuing FY 2017 \nByrne JAG award notification documents as soon as the Seventh Circuit stayed the preliminary \ninjunction as to geographic areas outside the City of Chicago. A few hours after the Seventh \nCircuit stayed the nationwide injunction, on June 26, 2018, the Department issued FY 2017 \nByrne JAG award notifications to Conference member cities. (See Ex. A.) Upon information and \nbelief, the Department issued awards containing all three challenged conditions to hundreds of \nmunicipalities.10  \n75.  However, the Department continues to withhold FY 2017 Byrne JAG award \ndocuments from many Conference member cities, including the cities located within Illinois, \nWisconsin, Indiana, California, Oregon, and Vermont. The Department’s refusal to disperse the \nFY 2017 Byrne JAG funds to certain states and local governments adds confusion and \nuncertainty to the award process. \n76.  The Department’s imposition of the notice, access, and compliance conditions and \nits continued refusal to issue awards to certain cities pose a threat of imminent harm to Evanston \n                                                 \n10 See https://ojp.gov/funding/Explore/OJPAwardDatahtm. \n-24- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/16/18 Page 25 of 33 PageID #:25\n  \nand the Conference’s other members. Without Byrne JAG funds, Evanston and the Conference’s \nother members will have to shut down important local programs; change program staffing, \nscope, or goals; or divert funds from other policing objectives to sustain the programs. \n77.  The Conference and Evanston, therefore, bring this action and seek to enjoin the \nAttorney General from imposing the unlawful conditions.  \nCOUNT ONE: ULTRA VIRES \n78.  The Conference and Evanston incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs’ \nallegations. \n79.  The Department of Justice may only exercise authority conferred by statute. \n80.  The Department lacks statutory authority to condition Byrne JAG funds on the \nnotice, access, and compliance conditions. Indeed, such authority is at odds with the text, \nstructure, and purpose of the Byrne JAG statute. \n81.  The Byrne JAG statute gives the Department no authority to impose additional \nsubstantive grant conditions on Byrne JAG funds. City of Chicago v. Sessions, 888 F.3d 272, 285 \n(7th Cir. 2018). The Department lacks statutory authority to impose the notice, access, and \ncompliance conditions on Byrne JAG funds. The three conditions are not “applicable Federal \nlaw” and do not deal with the administration and spending of funds. \n82.  The formula-grant structure of the Byrne JAG program also contradicts the \nDepartment’s purported authority to promulgate the conditions. Unlike discretionary grants, \nwhich agencies award on a competitive basis subject to agency discretion, formula grants are \nawarded pursuant to a statutory formula. If the Department had the authority to impose new \nsubstantive conditions on all grantees, the effect would be to contradict Congress’s formula and \nreallocate funds to jurisdictions that adopted the Department’s preferred policy. It would also \ncontradict Congress’s intent to give states and local governments the “flexibility to spend money \n-25- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/16/18 Page 26 of 33 PageID #:26\n  \nfor programs that work for them rather than to impose a ‘one size fits all’ solution.” H.R. Rep. \nNo. 109-233, at 89 (2005). \n83.  As a direct and proximate result of these unlawful conditions, Evanston and the \nConference’s other members will be forced to accept unlawful and unconstitutional grant \nconditions or forego Byrne JAG funds and shut down the programs the funds support. \n84.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, the Conference and Evanston \nare entitled to a declaration that the Attorney General is without authority to impose the notice, \naccess, and compliance conditions on FY 2017 Byrne JAG funds; and a permanent injunction \npreventing the conditions from going into effect. \nCOUNT TWO: SEPARATION OF POWERS \n85.  The Conference and Evanston incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs’ \nallegations. \n86.  The Constitution vests the spending power in Congress, not the executive branch. \nU.S. Const. art. I § 8, cl. 1. Absent a statutory provision or express delegation, only Congress is \nentitled to attach conditions to federal funds. \n87.  The executive branch “does not have unilateral authority to refuse to spend . . . \nfunds” that Congress already appropriated “for a particular project or program.” In re Aiken Cty., \n725 F.3d 255, 261 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 2013); see also Train v. City of New York, 420 U.S. 35, 44 \n(1975). Imposing a new condition on a federal grant program amounts to refusing to spend \nmoney appropriated by Congress unless that condition is satisfied.  \n88.  The notice condition was not imposed by Congress, but rather by the Department \nin issuing the FY 2017 Byrne JAG application. Therefore, the notice condition amounts to \nimproper usurpation of Congress’s spending power by the executive branch. \n-26- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/16/18 Page 27 of 33 PageID #:27\n  \n89.  The access condition was not imposed by Congress, but rather by the Department \nin issuing the FY 2017 Byrne JAG application. Therefore, the access condition amounts to \nimproper usurpation of Congress’s spending power by the executive branch. \n90.  The compliance condition was not imposed by Congress, but rather by the \nDepartment in issuing its OJP guidance and the FY 2016 and FY 2017 Byrne JAG applications. \nTherefore, the compliance condition amounts to improper usurpation of Congress’s spending \npower by the executive branch. \n91.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, the Conference and Evanston \nare entitled to a declaration that the notice, access, and compliance conditions for the FY 2017 \nByrne JAG funds violate the constitutional principle of separation of powers and impermissibly \narrogate to the executive branch power that is reserved to the legislative branch; and a permanent \ninjunction preventing the conditions from going into effect.  \nCOUNT THREE: SPENDING CLAUSE \n92.  The Conference and Evanston incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs’ \nallegations. \n93.  Not only did Congress not authorize (expressly or impliedly) the notice, access, \nand compliance conditions; but Congress could not have authorized the conditions because they \ndo not satisfy additional requirements of the Spending Clause. \n94.  First, the notice, access, and compliance conditions are not germane to the stated \npurposes of the Byrne JAG funds. None of the conditions are relevant to the federal interest in \nthe Byrne JAG funds that Conference members receive or to the Byrne JAG program generally. \n95.  The notice and access conditions are not relevant to the federal interest in the \nByrne JAG funds the Conference’s members receive. Information about when detainees will be \nreleased, and policies related to access for federal agents bear no relevance to the purchase of \n-27- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/16/18 Page 28 of 33 PageID #:28\n  \nequipment, community programs, or other uses to which Conference members put Byrne JAG \nfunds. \n96.  The compliance condition is not relevant to the federal interest in the Byrne JAG \nfunds the Conference’s members receive. Sharing information about immigration status with \nfederal officials bears no connection to the purchase of equipment, community programs, or \nother uses to which Conference members put Byrne JAG funds.  \n97.  The compliance, notice, and access conditions also are not relevant to the federal \ninterest in the Byrne JAG program more generally. The conditions actively undermine \nCongress’s goals of dispersing funds across the country, targeting funds to combat violent crime, \nand respecting local judgment in setting law enforcement strategy.   \n98.  Second, the notice, access, and compliance conditions would impermissibly \ninduce Byrne JAG recipients to engage in unconstitutional activity.  \n99.  The Spending Clause prohibits the federal government from imposing spending \nconditions to “induce the States to engage in activities that would themselves be \nunconstitutional.” S. Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 210 (1987). The three conditions seek to \nrequire Byrne JAG recipients to engage in unconstitutional activity, such as detaining individuals \nwithout probable cause in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  \n100.  Third, the notice, access, and compliance conditions are unconstitutionally \nambiguous.  \n101.  Federal restrictions on state and local funding must be articulated unambiguously \nto allow the recipient to knowingly accept the conditions and ascertain what is expected.  \n102.  The three conditions are ambiguous as to what is expected of grant recipients, \nparticularly given Evanston’s and other Conference members’ welcoming city policies and other \n-28- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/16/18 Page 29 of 33 PageID #:29\n  \nrelevant policies and practices. The conditions do not provide cities with notice to make a choice \nknowingly and cognizant of the consequences of their participation. \n103.  Many interpretations of the three conditions raise serious constitutional concerns. \nWhere a grant recipient must resolve tension between the Constitution and a federal agency’s \ninformal interpretation announced in a guidance document to ascertain what is expected of it, a \ncondition cannot be characterized as unambiguous.  \n104.  The compliance condition is ambiguous, and many interpretations of the \ncondition raise serious constitutional concerns. Section 1373 uses sweeping language with no \ndiscernable limiting principle. The Department added to the confusion by suggesting without \nexplanation that Section 1373 implicates a wide range of state and local governance practices, \nfrom formal laws to informal cultural norms. In addition, the Department compounded the \nconfusion by questioning the compliance of many jurisdictions with Section 1373 without \ndeciding whether the Department believes those jurisdictions’ policies comply.11 \n105.  Fourth, the notice, access, and compliance conditions are unconstitutionally \ncoercive.  \n106.  The Spending Clause prohibits grant conditions that are “so coercive as to pass \nthe point at which ‘pressure turns into compulsion.’” Dole, 483 U.S. at 211 (citation omitted).  \n107.  As a direct and proximate result of the notice, access, and compliance conditions, \nthe Conference’s members are forced to either accept unlawful and unconstitutional grant \nconditions or forego Byrne JAG funds. The three conditions threaten financial consequences that \nexceed the point at which pressure turns to constitutionally impermissible compulsion. \n                                                 \n11 Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Department of Justice Reviewing Letters from Ten Potential \nSanctuary Jurisdictions (July 6, 2017), http://tinyurl.com/ybdhf7vy. \n-29- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/16/18 Page 30 of 33 PageID #:30\n  \n108.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, the Conference and Evanston \nare entitled to a declaration that the notice, access, and compliance conditions for the FY 2017 \nByrne JAG funds violate the Constitution’s Spending Clause; and a permanent injunction \npreventing the conditions from going into effect.  \nCOUNT FOUR: COMMANDEERING \n109.  The Conference and Evanston incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs’ \nallegations. \n110.  The Tenth Amendment prohibits the federal government from requiring states and \nlocalities “to administer or enforce a federal regulatory program.” Murphy v. NCAA, 138 S. Ct. \n1461, 1477 (2018). The anti-commandeering principle prevents the federal government from \nshifting the costs of regulation to states and local governments. Id. Where the “whole object” of a \nfederal statutory provision is to “direct the functioning” of state and local governments, that \nprovision is unconstitutional and must be enjoined. Printz, 521 U.S. at 932, 935; New York v. \nUnited States, 505 U.S. 144, 186-187 (1992). That description precisely fits each of the three \nconditions. \n111.  When Congress enacted Section 1373, it sought to ensure that “[t]he acquisition, \nmaintenance, and exchange of immigration-related information by State and local agencies” \ncould be used to enforce federal law. S. Rep. No. 104-249, at 19-20 (1996). In doing so, it sought \nto “require [state and local officers] to provide information that belongs to the State and is \navailable to them only in their official capacity”—in other words, to engage in unconstitutional \ncommandeering. Printz, 521 U.S. at 932 n.17. \n112.  Further, Section 1373 prohibits state and local governments from engaging in a \ncore aspect of governing: controlling the actions of their own employees. Compliance with \nSection 1373 results in the federal government commandeering cities by directing how city \n-30- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/16/18 Page 31 of 33 PageID #:31\n  \npersonnel should act and handle data under local control to advance a federal program. In fact, \nthe Department instructed that states and local governments may need to provide affirmative \ninstruction to employees to comply.12 Section 1373 requires local officers to follow federal \ndirectives and usurps the local policymaking process. \n113.  The notice and access condition impermissibly commandeer cities and cannot be \nvalidly imposed on Byrne JAG funding recipients. The notice condition seeks to fundamentally \nreorganize not just how cities’ officers spend their time, but also the way the Conference’s \nmembers balance their Fourth Amendment obligations against their interest in effective law \nenforcement. The access condition requires a fundamental restructuring of police procedures and \nfunctions to accommodate on-demand access to detainees by federal agents.  \n114.  As a direct and proximate result of these unconstitutional conditions, the \nConference’s members will be forced to accept unlawful and unconstitutional grant conditions or \nforego Byrne JAG funds and shut down or materially alter the programs the funds support.  \n115.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, the Conference and Evanston \nare entitled to a declaration that the notice, access, and compliance conditions for the FY 2017 \nByrne JAG funds violate the Tenth Amendment; and a permanent injunction preventing the \nconditions from going into effect.  \nCOUNT FIVE: ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT  \n(Arbitrary and Capricious) \n116.  The Conference and Evanston incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs’ \nallegations. \n                                                 \n12 See Memorandum from Michael E. Horowitz, Inspector Gen., U.S. Dep’t of Justice, to Karol V. Mason, \nAssistant Attorney Gen., Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Department of Justice Referral \nof Allegations of Potential Violations of 8 U.S.C. § 1373 by Grant Recipients 6 (May 31, 2016), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/y9rpwge4. \n-31- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/16/18 Page 32 of 33 PageID #:32\n  \n117.  In addition to the Attorney General lacking statutory and constitutional authority \nto impose the notice, access, and compliance conditions, the conditions are arbitrary and \ncapricious, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706. \n118.  The Department’s decision to condition FY 2017 Byrne JAG funds on \ncompliance with the three conditions deviates from past agency practice without reasoned \nexplanation or justification. The Department failed to rely on reasoned decision-making and, to \nthe extent it cited reasons at all, those reasons are contradicted by evidence.  \n119.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, the Conference and Evanston \nare entitled to a declaration that the notice, access, and compliance conditions for the FY 2017 \nByrne JAG funds violate the APA; and a permanent injunction preventing those conditions from \ngoing into effect. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, The United States Conference of Mayors and the City of Evanston pray \nthat this Court: \na)  Declare that the notice, access, and compliance conditions for the FY 2017 Byrne \nJAG program are unlawful; \nb)  Preliminarily and permanently enjoin the Attorney General from imposing the \nnotice, access, and compliance conditions on FY 2017 Byrne JAG funds; and from imposing the \nnotice, access, and compliance conditions on future Byrne JAG funds; \nc)   Retain jurisdiction to monitor the Department’s compliance with this Court’s \njudgment;  \nd)  Award Plaintiffs their reasonable attorney fees, expenses, and costs as permitted \nby federal law, including the Administrative Procedure Act and 28 U.S.C. § 2412; and  \ne)  Grant such other relief as this Court may deem proper. \n-32- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/16/18 Page 33 of 33 PageID #:33\n  \nDated: July 16, 2018  Respectfully submitted, \n \n \nTHE UNITED STATES CONFERENCE OF \n \nMAYORS and CITY OF EVANSTON \n \nBy: /s/ Brian C.

Case No. 18-cv-4853 \n   \nMATTHEW G. WHITAKER,1   \nas Acting Attorney General of the United States,     \n             \n        Defendant. \n \nAMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n  The United States Conference of Mayors (the “Conference”) and the City of Evanston, \nIllinois (“Evanston”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”), for their amended complaint against defendant \nMatthew G. Whitaker, in his capacity as appointed Acting Attorney General of the United States, \n(“Defendant” or the “Attorney General”), state as follows: \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  The Conference and Evanston bring this action to stop the federal government’s \naggressive and escalating effort to force cities into becoming the deportation arm of the federal \ngovernment. The Conference and Evanston seek to enjoin the Attorney General of the United \nStates from imposing sweeping and unlawful conditions on the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice \nAssistance Grant Program (“Byrne JAG”)—an established federal grant program that provides \ncrucial support for law enforcement in hundreds of cities nationwide.  \n                                                 \n1 On November 7, 2018, Attorney General Jefferson B. Sessions III resigned from office. Shortly \nthereafter, President Trump appointed Matthew Whitaker as the Acting Attorney General. Under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 25(d), Whitaker is automatically substituted as party defendant for Sessions, and \nthe Department of Justice and United States are bound by his admissions and pleadings in this action. \nPlaintiffs have amended the case caption in their filings accordingly. However, they do so without \nwaiving any objection to Whitaker’s authority to act as Attorney General. As the State of Maryland \nmaintains in a recent lawsuit, State of Maryland v. United States, D. Md. Case No. 1:18-cv-02849-ELH, \nWhitaker’s appointment may violate 28 U.S.C. § 508 and the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, \nU.S. Const. art. II, § 2. \n-1- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 2 of 45 PageID #:671\n  \n2.  The Department of Justice (“Department”) first sought to impose three \nimmigration-related conditions on the fiscal year (“FY”) 2017 Byrne JAG funds under a cloud of \nuncertainty created by the Department’s increasingly aggressive positions. As a condition of \nreceiving FY 2017 Byrne JAG funds, the Department requires that: (1) cities give the \nDepartment of Homeland Security (“DHS”), which includes U.S. Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement (“ICE”), 48 hours’ notice, or at least as much notice “as practicable” prior to \nreleasing any alien in custody to allow ICE to take custody of that individual (the “notice \ncondition”); (2) cities give DHS officials unlimited access to local law enforcement facilities to \ninterrogate any suspected non-citizen held there, effectively federalizing city facilities (the \n“access condition”); and (3) comply with, and certify such compliance with, 8 U.S.C. § 1373 \n(“Section 1373”), a federal statute that purports to bar local governments from restricting the \nsharing of immigration status information with the federal government (the “compliance \ncondition”).  \n3.  In August 2018, this Court issued a preliminary injunction that prohibits the \nAttorney General from imposing the notice, access, and compliance conditions on Evanston and \nthe Conference’s other member cities. Indeed, courts throughout the country have enjoined the \nAttorney General from imposing the conditions. \n4.  Faced with numerous rulings that prohibit the Attorney General from imposing \nthe unlawful conditions, the Attorney General ignored the courts and doubled-down.  On \nOctober 1, 2018, the Attorney General began issuing FY 2018 Byrne JAG award notifications to \nhundreds of cities and other local jurisdictions. The FY 2018 award documents contain three \nconditions that are materially identical to the FY 2017 conditions preliminarily enjoined by this \nCourt. Beyond that, the FY 2018 award documents include new unlawful conditions.  \n-2- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 3 of 45 PageID #:672\n  \n5.  As a condition of receiving FY 2018 Byrne JAG funds, the Department requires \ncities to (1) provide 48 hours’ advance notice, or at least as much notice as practicable, to DHS \nprior to releasing an alien from custody, just like the notice condition the Court preliminarily \nenjoined in this case and set aside as unlawful in Chicago’s and Illinois’ cases; (2) provide \nfederal authorities with “access to any correctional facility in order to meet with an alien (or an \nindividual believed to be an alien) and inquire as to his right to be or remain in the United \nStates,” just like the access condition the Court preliminarily enjoined in this case and set aside \nas unlawful in Chicago’s and Illinois’ cases; (3) comply with Section 1373, which this Court \nalready held facially unconstitutional, and comply with 8 U.S.C. § 1644 (“Section 1644”), which \nprohibits the same conduct as Section 1373, and is therefore unconstitutional for the same \nreasons (the “compliance condition”); (4) not publicly disclose federal law enforcement \ninformation in an attempt to conceal, harbor, or shield from detection fugitives from justice or \nundocumented immigrants, even where such disclosure would not violate the law (the “harboring \ncondition”); and (5) provide additional information about communications with federal \nimmigration authorities in an apparent attempt to help the Department enforce its other unlawful \nimmigration-related conditions (the “questionnaire condition”). In connection with the \nconditions, the Department requires recipients to certify compliance with the conditions and \nvarious federal statutes, including 8 U.S.C. §§ 1226(a) and (c), 1231(a), 1324(a), 1357(a), \n1366(1) and 1366(3), 1373, and 1644. (The conditions and certifications required to receive FY \n2017 and FY 2018 Byrne JAG funds are collectively referred to as the “challenged conditions.”) \n6.  The challenged conditions are facially unauthorized and unconstitutional. The FY \n2018 conditions are just as harmful as those that the Court struck down, and in precisely the \nsame ways. The Attorney General once again seeks to dictate local policy by imposing \n-3- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 4 of 45 PageID #:673\n  \nunauthorized conditions on a critical source of local government funding. Neither federal law nor \nthe United States Constitution permit the Attorney General’s actions. \n7.  The challenged conditions are also directly at odds with Conference policy \nresolutions, which collectively represent the views of the nation’s cities and their mayors. In \n2017 and 2018, the Conference adopted policy resolutions addressed to the federal government’s \nefforts to force localities to engage in federal immigration enforcement. The resolutions called \nfor: (a) an end to unconstitutional funding threats to cities in an effort to coerce and compel them \ninto implementing federal immigration law; (b) the end of the Department’s unconstitutionally \nbroad interpretation of Section 1373; and (c) the award of Byrne JAG funds to municipalities \nwithout the imposition of unconstitutional conditions.  \n8.  Because of the Department’s imposition of the challenged conditions, Evanston \nand the Conference’s other members face a Hobson’s choice: agree to accept the Department’s \nunconstitutional grant conditions or stand on their rights and forfeit crucial Byrne JAG funds.  \n9.  The Conference and Evanston seek a declaration that the challenged conditions \nare unlawful. The Conference and Evanston also seek an injunction preventing the Department \nfrom imposing the challenged conditions on FY 2017 Byrne JAG funds, FY 2018 Byrne JAG \nfunds, and from including the conditions in future applications and awards. To prevent the \nendless cycle of litigation, in which the Attorney General imposes unlawful conditions on the \nreceipt of federal grant funds each year until the Conference and Evanston sue and the Court \nintervenes, the requested relief should cover FY 2017, FY 2018, and all future grant years.  The \nConference and Evanston also request that the Court order the Attorney General to pay fees, \nexpenses, and costs to the Conference and Evanston. \n-4- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 5 of 45 PageID #:674\n  \nPARTIES \n10.

The Byrne JAG program provides critical funds to cities.  \n15.  Congress established the Byrne JAG program in 2005 to serve as the primary \nsource of federal criminal justice funding for states and localities. The Office of Justice Programs \n(“OJP”) within the Department oversees the program.  \n16.  The goal of the Byrne JAG program is to allow states and local governments the \n“flexibility to spend money for programs that work for them rather than to impose a ‘one size fits \nall’ solution” for local policing. H.R. Rep. No. 109-233, at 89 (2005).2 To that end, the Byrne \nJAG program is structured as a formula grant, which awards funds to all eligible grantees \naccording to a prescribed formula. See 34 U.S.C. § 10156(d)(2)(A).  \n17.  The Byrne JAG program requires that the Attorney General “shall allocate to each \nunit of local government,” funds in accordance with a formula based on population and relative \nlevels of violent crime. 34 U.S.C. §§ 10156(d)(2)(A). The Byrne JAG distribution formula for \nstates is a function of population and violent crime. Id. § 10156(a). The formula for local \ngovernments is a function of the state’s allocation and the ratio of violent crime in the locality to \nviolent crime in the state. Id. § 10156(d).  \n18.  The Attorney General must follow the statutory formula to determine allotments \nfor each state and local government. 34 U.S.C. § 10156. The formula-based approach entitles \ncities to their share of the Byrne JAG formula allocation so long as their proposed programs meet \nat least one of eight broadly defined goals, see 34 U.S.C. § 10152(a)(1)(A)-(H) (listing eligible \nprograms such as general law enforcement, prevention and education, drug treatment, and mental \n                                                 \n2 The Byrne JAG program was created in the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice \nReauthorization Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-162, 119 Stat. 2960 (2006), which in turn amended the \nOmnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, Pub. L. No. 90-351, 82 Stat. 197. \n-6- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 7 of 45 PageID #:676\n  \nhealth), and their applications contain a series of statutorily required certifications and \nattestations. Id. § 10153(a). \nB.  The Conference was formed to address the intersection of federal and local \npolicy and has resolved to oppose the Attorney General’s actions.  \n19.  In 1932, during the midst of the Great Depression, the nation’s cities were close to \nbankruptcy and their residents were largely unemployed and without access to sufficient food, \nhousing, law enforcement, and other necessities. In response to the appeals of mayors across the \ncountry, Congress created a $300 million federal assistance program for cities, marking the first \ntime in the nation’s history that federal relief was provided directly to cities. A few weeks later, \nthe Conference was founded to coordinate its cities’ interactions with the federal government. \n20.  Today the Conference’s member cities are home to immigrant populations that \nare both recent arrivals and multigenerational families. The Conference proudly recognizes that \ncities are diverse, multicultural centers, and that their diversity reflects core American values, \nfosters economic prosperity and opportunity, enriches cities’ cultures, and keeps our nation \ncompetitive and strong. \n21.  The Conference’s primary roles include safeguarding the interests, rights, and \nprivileges of municipalities; promoting the development of effective national city and metro-\narea-focused policy; strengthening federal-city relationships; ensuring that federal policy meets \nurban needs; providing mayors with leadership and management tools that allow them to do their \njobs better; and creating a forum in which mayors share ideas, information, and best practices, \nand through which cities coordinate on shared policy goals. \n22.  Conference members speak with a united voice on organizational policies and \ngoals. Mayors contribute to the development of national urban policy by serving on one or more \n-7- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 8 of 45 PageID #:677\n  \nof the Conference’s standing committees or in another leadership role. A list of member cities \nwhose mayors currently serve in leadership roles is attached as Exhibit A to this complaint. \n23.  The adoption of a resolution is the principal means by which the Conference \nspeaks on matters of policy. The policy positions adopted at the Conference’s annual meetings \ncollectively represent the views of the nation’s cities.  \n24.  Conference members met from June 23-26, 2017 for the 2017 annual meeting. \nOver 250 mayors representing cities across the country, including those from nearly every state \nand the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, attended the meeting. \n25.  At the 2017 annual meeting, the Conference’s members passed three resolutions \nrecognizing the importance of immigrants to their communities, supporting immigrant rights, \nstanding against policies that target immigrant communities, and opposing the administration’s \npunitive welcoming city policies.  \n26.  First, the Conference passed a resolution titled “Opposing Punitive Sanctuary \nJurisdiction Policies” (attached as Exhibit B). This resolution reflects the Conference members’ \nconsidered judgment that, among other things: \n(a)  Many local jurisdictions determined that their local law enforcement efforts and \npersonnel have neither the authority, the priority, nor the resources to serve as \nimmigration enforcement officers; \n(b)  Trust between local law enforcement and the communities they serve is critical to \npreventing, solving, and prosecuting crimes, and many jurisdictions determined \nthat having local law enforcement officers serve as immigration officers would \nbreak that trust; \n(c)  Many local jurisdictions and authorities lack the law enforcement resources to act \nas immigration officers at the expense of local law enforcement priorities; and  \n(d)  Cities and other local government entities must have the discretion to make \nindividualized determinations relative to local values, expenditure of resources, \npriorities, and liabilities assumed, all taking into account that immigrants residing \nin the nation’s cities must be able to trust all of city government that their Fourth \nAmendment rights will be guaranteed, and that local law enforcement efforts to \n-8- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 9 of 45 PageID #:678\n  \nbuild trust and supportive relationships with all communities are essential to \npreventing and prosecuting crime and helping victims. \n (Ex. B at 1-2.) \n \n27.  Accordingly, the Conference resolved to: \n(a)  Oppose punitive sanctuary jurisdiction policies that limit local control and \ndiscretion; \n(b)  Urge Congress, the administration, and states to pursue immigration enforcement \npolicies that recognize that local law enforcement has limited resources and \ncommunity trust is critical to local law enforcement and community safety; and \n(c)  Oppose federal and state policies that commandeer local law enforcement or \nrequire local authorities to (i) violate, or be placed at risk of violating, a person’s \nFourth Amendment rights; (ii) expend limited resources to act as immigration \nagents; or (iii) otherwise assist federal immigration authorities beyond what is \ndetermined by local policy. \n(Id. at 2-3.) \n \n28.  Second, the Conference passed a resolution titled “Supporting Immigrants, \nRefugees and Asylum Seekers and Standing Against Discriminatory and Harmful Policies that \nTarget These Vulnerable Communities” (attached as Exhibit C). This resolution recognizes that \ncities are home to immigrant populations, including recent arrivals and multigenerational \nfamilies; that immigrants contribute to cities in important ways; and that the administration has \nnonetheless antagonized and intimidated immigrant communities through executive orders and \nby threatening punitive actions against welcoming cities. (Ex. C at 1.) The Conference resolved \nto call on Congress to act against policies that discriminate against and target immigrants, and to \noppose “the Administration’s efforts to hold immigrants hostage as bargaining chips to threaten \nwithholding federal funding from cities across the nation.” (Id. at 1-2.) \n29.  Third, the Conference passed a resolution titled “Supporting Immigrant Rights” \n(attached as Exhibit D). This resolution recognizes that: the United States is enriched by the \ndiversity of immigrants; cities are diverse, multicultural centers that reflect core American values \n-9- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 10 of 45 PageID #:679\n  \nand foster economic prosperity; and data show that welcoming cities are stronger economically \nand safer than other cities. (Ex. D at 1.) In addition, the resolution recognizes that the federal \ngovernment seeks to restrict funding to welcoming jurisdictions and coerce cities into becoming \nthe deportation arm of the federal government, which undermines cities’ abilities to ensure \ncommunity safety by eroding trust between local law enforcement and residents. (Id. at 1-2.) The \nConference thus resolved to “call for an end to unconstitutional federal funding threats to states \nand local governments in an effort to coerce and compel them into implementing federal \nimmigration law,” and to “urge members of Congress to withdraw legislation that attempts to cut \nlocal law enforcement funding necessary to ensure the safety of our communities.” (Id. at 2.) \n30.  From June 8-11, 2018, Conference members met in Boston for the 2018 annual \nmeeting. More than 240 mayors representing cities across the country attended, including those \nfrom nearly every state and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.   \n31.  At the 2018 annual meeting, the Conference passed a resolution titled “Opposing \nUnconstitutional Requirements Placed on Byrne JAG Funding and Urging the Immediate \nAwarding of FY 2017 Byrne JAG Grants” (attached as Exhibit E). The resolution states that \ncities “will not be bullied, intimidated or coerced into making a false choice between grants with \noffensive conditions attached, on the one hand, and our values as welcoming cit[ies] and the \nprinciples of community policing, on the other.” (Ex. E at 1.) The resolution recognizes that the \nDepartment has no authority to impose new conditions on a grant program created by Congress \nand “cannot commandeer local law enforcement to carry out federal immigration law functions.” \n(Id. at 2.) The Conference resolved to call on the Department “to award Byrne JAG funds to \nmunicipalities without imposing additional unconstitutional conditions.” (Id. at 3.) \n-10- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 11 of 45 PageID #:680\n  \n32.  Each of these resolutions passed with a wide majority of the Conference members \npresent for the meetings. In fact, after conclusion of a vote on a proposed resolution that passes, a \nmayor who attended the vote may request to be recorded as having voted “No” on that specific \nresolution. Only five mayors in attendance at the annual meeting recorded a no vote as to any of \nthe three 2017 resolutions. Only one mayor in attendance at the 2018 annual meeting recorded a \nno vote as to the 2018 resolution.  \nC.  Conference members rely on Byrne JAG funds. \n33.  Many Conference members rely on Byrne JAG funds for critical law enforcement \nneeds. As such, the Conference has long supported the Byrne JAG program. (See Ex. F (2012 \nConference resolution reaffirming the Conference’s strong support for the Byrne JAG program \nand noting that the program is “critical to the safety of our cities”).)  \n34.  Over the past decade, Conference members have routinely applied for and \nreceived Byrne JAG funds.  \n35.  Evanston, a Conference member, first received Byrne JAG funds in 2009 and has \nreceived funds every year since. Evanston uses Byrne JAG funds to train officers through the \nPolice Learning Institute, pay personnel, and to purchase equipment. In FY 2016, Evanston \nreceived $14,685 through the Byrne JAG program. \n36.  Evanston receives its Byrne JAG funds through the application submitted by \nChicago, Illinois. Because Chicago’s costs of preventing and investigating violent crimes exceed \nthose of surrounding jurisdictions, 34 U.S.C. § 10156(d)(4) obligates Chicago to file a Byrne \nJAG application on behalf of itself and other, neighboring communities, including Evanston. \n37.  Many of the Conference’s members use Byrne JAG funds for diverse purposes, \nreflecting both the varied law enforcement needs of different communities and Congress’s intent \n-11- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 12 of 45 PageID #:681\n  \nto preserve local discretion and flexibility in Byrne JAG-funded law enforcement programs. \nThese include, for example, the following Conference members: \n(a)  Iowa City, Iowa (population 74,398) uses Byrne JAG funds to promote traffic \nsafety, to establish a search and rescue program aimed at individuals at risk for \nwandering, to partially fund a drug task force, and to purchase equipment. \n(b)  Los Angeles, California (population 3,792,621) uses Byrne JAG funds for its \nCommunity Law Enforcement and Recovery (CLEAR) program, which aims to \nreduce gang violence in the city and rehabilitate communities that experienced \nsignificant crime. The program promotes and funds special criminal investigative \nunits, an aggressive vertical prosecutorial program, probation and parole officers, \nyouth intervention organizations, and schools. \n(c)  New Orleans, Louisiana (population 391,495) uses Byrne JAG funds on gun \nviolence reduction initiatives, alternatives to incarceration for municipal court, \ndiversion programs for eligible defendants with mental illness, pre-trial and \nprobation advocacy, domestic violence monitoring court, and technology \nupgrades including body cameras and audio surveillance equipment for its police \nforce. \n(d)  New York, New York (population 8,175,133) uses Byrne JAG funds to support a \nwide range of programs, including efforts to improve the collection, organization \nand evaluation of criminal justice data; a specialized unit that investigates illegal \nhotels, building violations, and illegal adult establishments; initiatives to reduce \nthe number of people with mental and behavioral needs who cycle through the \ncriminal justice system by connecting them with interventions and services; and \ninitiatives to ensure the safety of students and reduce crime in schools. In \naddition, the City’s five District Attorneys use Byrne JAG funds to support many \nprograms, including the Kings County Drug Treatment Alternative-to-Prison \nprogram, which diverts hundreds of nonviolent offenders to community-based \nresidential drug treatment programs, and the New York County Cybercrime and \nIdentity Theft Bureau, which protects the public and institutions from organized \ncybercrime and identity theft schemes. \n(e)  Portland, Oregon (population 639,863) has used Byrne JAG funds to support its \nNew Options for Women (NOW) program, which provides services to women \nwho experienced sexual exploitation while working in the commercial sex \nindustry. \n(f)  Providence, Rhode Island (population 178,042) uses Byrne JAG funds to pay \npersonnel to conduct targeted enforcement patrols and to contract with Family \nService of Rhode Island for the services of a part-time Bilingual Police Liaison.  \n-12- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 13 of 45 PageID #:682\n  \n(g)  Sacramento, California (population 493,025) uses Byrne JAG funds to support the \nongoing maintenance and operations of its Police Department’s helicopter \nprogram. \n38.  Many other Conference members receive Byrne JAG funds and use them for still \ndifferent, but no less critical, law enforcement purposes. These members include cities listed \nseparately on Exhibit A, and many other cities like them. \nD.  The Conference, Evanston, and other Conference members promote policies \nof cooperation between local law enforcement and immigrants. \n39.  In exercising its discretion over local law enforcement policy, Evanston made the \nconsidered judgment that devoting local resources to federal civil immigration enforcement \nwould be detrimental to community safety, and that concerns for safety are best addressed by \npromoting a policy of cooperation between local law enforcement and immigrants. This policy \njudgment is codified in Evanston’s “Welcoming City Ordinance.” Evanston City Code § 1-22. \n40.  Evanston’s Welcoming City Ordinance reflects the Evanston City Council’s \nfindings that “the cooperation of all persons, both documented citizens and those without \ndocumentation status, is essential to achieve the City’s goals of protecting life and property, \npreventing crime and resolving problems” and that one of Evanston’s “most important goals is to \nenhance the City’s relationship with the immigrant communities.” Id. § 1-22-2.  \n41.  In its current form, the Welcoming City Ordinance, codified as Chapter 22 of the \nEvanston City Code, contains several key provisions relevant to this lawsuit, including: \n(a)  Subject to certain exceptions, no Evanston agent or agency shall “[s]top, arrest, \nsearch, detain or continue to detain a person solely on the belief that the person is \nnot present legally in the United States, or that the person has committed a civil \nimmigration violation.” §1-22-10(A)(1). \n(b)  Subject to certain exceptions, no Evanston agent or agency shall “[d]etain, or \ncontinue to detain, a person based upon an immigration detainer, when such \nimmigration detainer is based solely on a violation of a civil immigration law.”    \n§ 1-22-10(A)(3). \n-13- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 14 of 45 PageID #:683\n  \n(c)  Nothing in section 1-22-10 “prohibits communication between federal agencies or \nofficials and law enforcement or officials.” §1-22-10(D). \n(d)  Except as otherwise provided by federal law, no Evanston agent or agency shall \ndisclose citizenship or immigration status information “unless required to do so \nby legal process or such disclosure has been authorized in writing by the \nindividual to whom such information pertains.” § 1-22-8. \n42.  These and the other provisions of the Welcoming City Ordinance play a vital role \nin strengthening the relationship between Evanston’s government, its police force, and its \nimmigrant community. It is essential that Evanston’s police officers have the flexibility needed \nto engage the immigrant community in their crime-fighting initiatives without projecting a \nconstant threat of deportation.  \n43.  Evanston is not alone. Many other Conference members have adopted similar \npolicies. These include, for example, Gary, Indiana; Los Angeles, California; New Orleans, \nLouisiana; New York, New York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Providence, Rhode Island; and \nBoston, Massachusetts. 3 \n44.  Welcoming city policies and similar policies are sound. One study found that \n“crime is statistically significantly lower in sanctuary counties compared to nonsanctuary \ncounties . . . controlling for population characteristics.”4 Indeed, a broad coalition of police \n                                                 \n3 Gary – Ordinance No. 9100; The Los Angeles Police Department & Federal Immigration Enforcement: \nFrequently Asked Questions, http://assets.lapdonline.org/assets/pdf/immigrationfaq.pdf; New Orleans – \nNew Orleans Police Department Operations Manual, Chapter 41.6.1, \nhttps://www.nola.gov/getattachment/NOPD/NOPD-Consent-Decree/Chapter-41-6-1-Immigration-Status-\napproval.pdf/; New York – Executive Order Nos. 34 and 41, \nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/assets/immigrants/downloads/pdf/eo-34.pdf and \nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/assets/immigrants/downloads/pdf/eo-41.pdf; Philadelphia – Executive Order No. \n16, https://www.ilrc.org/sites/default/files/resources/2016-01_philadelphia_pep_order.pdf; Providence – \nResolution of the City Council, \nhttps://www.ilrc.org/sites/default/files/resources/providence_resolution.pdf. \nBoston – An Ordinance Establishing a Boston Trust Act. \n4 Tom K.

Welcoming city policies are rooted in the judgment that restricting entanglement \nwith ICE secures and enhances community trust in local law enforcement. Local law \nenforcement relies upon all community members (regardless of immigration status) to report \ncrimes, serve as witnesses, and assist in investigations and prosecutions. Indeed, in the \nConference members’ experience, even the perception that local law enforcement is assisting in \nimmigration enforcement can erode trust, disrupt lines of communication, and make law \nenforcement’s job much more difficult.  \n46.  For these reasons, the Conference has for years opposed the federal government’s \nattempts to penalize cities that adopt welcoming city policies such as those cited above. In 2015, \nfor example, the Conference opposed Senate Bill 2146, the “Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect \nAmericans Act,” which proposed to deny Community Development Block Grants and other \nfederal aid to cities that adopted policies like those identified above.  \n47.  Shifting the federal responsibility of enforcing civil immigration law to local \ngovernments diverts critical resources from their law enforcement agencies, compromises public \nsafety, and hinders local police department policies. The Conference continues to oppose similar \nlegislation when proposed (none of which Congress passed).  \nE.  The Department imposed unlawful conditions on FY 2017 Byrne JAG funds. \n48.  For over a decade, the Department administered the Byrne JAG program as \nCongress intended: funding critical local law enforcement initiatives without seeking to leverage \nfunding to conscript local agencies to enforce federal immigration law. But now the Department \n                                                 \n5 Press Release, Major Cities Chiefs Ass’n, U.S. Mayors, Police Chiefs Concerned with Sanctuary Cities \nExecutive Order (Jan. 25, 2017), http://tinyurl.com/y8zqhypw. \n-15- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 16 of 45 PageID #:685\n  \nseeks to impose three conditions on FY 2017 Byrne JAG funds: (1) the notice condition; (2) the \naccess condition; and (3) the compliance condition. In conjunction with the conditions, the \nDepartment also requires applicants to submit certifications signed by its chief legal officer and \nchief executive (i.e., the mayor). Each condition is facially unauthorized and unconstitutional. \n1.  The notice condition \n49.  The FY 2017 Byrne JAG local solicitation (attached as Exhibit G) states that the \nawards will be conditioned on grant applicants providing “at least 48 hours’ advance notice to \nDHS regarding the scheduled release date and time of an alien in the jurisdiction’s custody when \nDHS requests such notice in order to take custody of the alien pursuant to the Immigration and \nNationality Act.” (Ex. G at 30, https://www.bja.gov/Funding/JAGLocal17.pdf.)  \n50.  The FY 2017 Byrne JAG award documents revise and expand on what the notice \ncondition entails. (A copy of the Department’s sample award document is attached as Exhibit H.) \nFrom the date a city accepts the award and throughout the time of the award’s performance, each \ncity must have in place an “ordinance, -rule, -regulation, -policy, or -practice . . . designed to \nensure that, when a local-government (or local-government-contracted) correctional facility \nreceives from DHS a formal written request . . . that seeks advance notice of the scheduled \nrelease date and time for a particular alien in such facility, then such facility will honor such \nrequest and – as early as practicable . . . provide the requested notice to DHS.” (Ex. H at 19.) The \naward documents specify that DHS currently requests notice “as early as practicable (at least 48 \nhours, if possible).” (Id. at 18.) \n2.  The access condition \n51.  The FY 2017 Byrne JAG solicitation states that the awards will also be \nconditioned on grant applicants permitting “personnel of the [DHS] to access any correctional or \ndetention facility in order to meet with an alien (or an individual believed to be an alien) and \n-16- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 17 of 45 PageID #:686\n  \ninquire as to his or her right to be or remain in the United States.” (Ex. G at 30.) The requirement \nappears to mandate that federal immigration agents be given unprecedented and unfettered \naccess to local law enforcement facilities and to any person being held there.  \n52.  The FY 2017 Byrne JAG award documents revise and expand on what the notice \ncondition entails. From the date a city accepts the award and throughout the time of the award’s \nperformance, each city must have in place an “ordinance, -rule, -regulation, -policy, or -practice \n… designed to ensure that [any] agents of the United States … are given access [to] a local-\ngovernment (or local-government-contracted) correctional facility” to permit the federal “agents \nto meet with individuals who are (or are believed by such agents to be) aliens and to inquire as to \nsuch individuals’ right to be or remain in the United States.” (Ex. H at 19.) \n3.  The compliance condition \n53.  The FY 2017 Byrne JAG solicitation states that to validly accept an award, a local \ngovernment must certify compliance with Section 1373. In fact, the application requires \ncertifications by both a city’s chief legal officer and its chief executive. (Ex. G at 22-23.) \n54.  Section 1373 provides that state and local entities may not “prohibit, or in any \nway restrict” their entities and officials from sending or receiving citizenship or immigration \nstatus information from or to DHS. 8 U.S.C. § 1373(a). Section 1373 further states that no person \nor agency may “prohibit, or in any way restrict” state and local entities from sending, requesting, \nor receiving immigration status information from or to DHS; maintaining immigration status \ninformation; or exchanging immigration status information with other entities. Id. § 1373(b).  \n55.  The FY 2017 Byrne JAG award documents revise and expand on what the \ncompliance condition entails. The compliance condition is set forth in multiple award conditions. \n(Ex. H at 15-17.) The condition requires a recipient to submit a certification of compliance with \nSection 1373 signed by the chief legal officer, as well as a certification by the chief executive \n-17- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 18 of 45 PageID #:687\n  \nadopting the chief legal officer’s certification. (Id. at 15.) The condition also requires ongoing \ncompliance with Section 1373, and requires subrecipients (i.e., those who receive their funds \nthrough another applicant) to certify compliance with Section 1373. (Id. at 16.) \nF.  The Department imposed unlawful conditions on FY 2018 Byrne JAG funds. \n56.  To date, this Court has enjoined the Attorney General from imposing the notice, \naccess, and compliance conditions in three separate lawsuits, including this case. ECF No. 23; \nCity of Chicago v. Sessions, No. 17-cv-5720, 2018 WL 3608564, at *17 (N.D. Ill. July 27, 2018) \n(Leinenweber, J.) (permanently enjoining the Attorney General from imposing the notice, access, \nand compliance conditions); see also City of Chicago v. Sessions, No. 17-cv-5820, ECF No. 211 \n(same); State of Illinois v. Sessions, No. 18-cv-4791, ECF No. 25 (same). This Court is not alone. \nSee City of Philadelphia v. Sessions, 309 F. Supp. 3d 289, 321 (E.D. Pa. 2018); City and Cty. of \nSan Francisco v. Sessions, No. 17-cv-04642-WHO, 2018 WL 4859528, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 5, \n2018). \n57.  The Attorney General, however, continues to insist upon forcing the conditions on \ncities, states, and other local governments. The FY 2018 Byrne JAG local solicitation, required \ncertifications, and award documents reflect the Attorney General’s decision to re-impose the \nnotice, access, and compliance conditions, as well as new conditions similarly designed to \nconscript state and local officers into the service of federal immigration-enforcement priorities. \n1.  The notice condition  \n58.  The FY 2018 Byrne JAG local solicitation (attached as Exhibit I) states that the \nawards will require recipients to not “impede the exercise of the authority of the federal \ngovernment under 8 U.S.C. § 1266(a) & (c) … and 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(4)” by specifically \nrequiring recipients to provide “at least 48 hours’ advance notice to DHS regarding the scheduled \nrelease date and time of an alien in the recipient’s custody when DHS requests such notice in \n-18- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 19 of 45 PageID #:688\n  \norder to take custody of the alien pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act.” (Ex. I at 36-\n37.)  \n59.  The FY 2018 Byrne JAG award documents revise and expand on what the notice \ncondition entails. (A copy of the 2018 award documents sent to Albuquerque, New Mexico is \nattached as Exhibit J.) The FY 2018 Byrne JAG award documents require that from the date a \ncity accepts the award and throughout the time of the award’s performance, each city, agency, \nand official must not “interfere with the ‘removal’ process by failing to provide – as early as \npracticable … – advance notice to DHS of the scheduled release date and time for a particular \nalien, if a State or local government (or government-contracted) correctional facility receives \nfrom DHS a formal written request pursuant to the INA that seeks such advance notice.” (Ex. J at \n21.) The award documents specify that DHS currently requests notice “as early as practicable (at \nleast 48 hours, if possible).” (Id.) The conduct required by this condition is identical to the \nconduct the Attorney General attempted to require with the FY 2017 notice condition.  \n2.  The access condition  \n60.  The FY 2018 Byrne JAG solicitation states that the awards will require recipients \n“not to impede the exercise by DHS agents … of their authority under 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(1)” by \nspecifically requiring recipients to “permit DHS agents to have access to any correctional facility \nin order to meet with an alien (or an individual believed to be an alien) and inquire as to his right \nto be or remain in the United States.” (Ex. I at 37.) \n61.  The FY 2018 Byrne JAG award documents require that from the date a city \naccepts the award and throughout the time of the award’s performance, each city, agency, and \nofficial must not “imped[e] access to any State or local government (or government-contracted) \ncorrectional facility by [federal] agents for the purpose [of] ‘interrogat[ing] any alien or person \nbelieved to be an alien as to his [or her] right to be or to remain in the United States.’” (Ex. J at \n-19- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 20 of 45 PageID #:689\n  \n20.) The award documents define the term impede to include “taking or continuing any action, or \nimplementing or maintaining any law, policy, rule, or practice that (a) is designed to prevent or \nto significantly delay or complicate, or (b) has the effect of preventing or of significantly \ndelaying or complicating.” (Id.) The conduct required by this condition is identical to the conduct \nthe Attorney General attempted to require with the FY 2017 notice condition. \n3.  The compliance condition \n62.  The FY 2018 Byrne JAG solicitation states that the awards will be conditioned on \nthe recipient complying with Section 1373 and Section 1644, as well as certifying compliance \nwith those provisions. (Ex. I at 27, 36, 42, 57.)  \n63.  Section 1644 proscribes the exact same conduct as Section 1373. Section 1644 \nprovides that no state or local entities “may be prohibited, or in any way restricted, from sending \n… or receiving … information regarding the immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of an alien \nin the United States.” 8 U.S.C. § 1644.  \n64.  The compliance condition is set forth in multiple FY 2018 award conditions. (Ex. \nJ at 16-18.) The compliance condition requires a local government to submit a certification of \ncompliance with Section 1373 and Section 1644 signed by the chief legal officer, as well as a \ncertification by the chief executive adopting the chief legal officer’s certification. (Id. at 16.)  \nThe condition also requires ongoing compliance with Section 1373 and Section 1644, and \nrequires subrecipients to certify their compliance with Section 1373 and Section 1644. (Id. at \n17.) This condition is materially identical to the FY 2017 compliance condition.   \n4.  The harboring condition \n65.  The FY 2018 Byrne JAG solicitation states that the Byrne JAG awards will be \nconditioned on the applicant agreeing “[n]ot to violate, or aid or abet any violation of, 8 U.S.C. § \n1324(a) (forbidding any ‘person,’ in ‘knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that an alien \n-20- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 21 of 45 PageID #:690\n  \nhas come to, entered, or remains in the United States in violation of law,’ to ‘conceal, harbor, or \nshield from detection, or attempt to conceal, harbor, or shield from detection, such alien in any \nplace . . .’ or to ‘engage in any conspiracy to commit any of the preceding acts … or aid or abet \nthe commission of any of the preceding acts’).” (Ex. I at 36.) \n66.  The FY 2018 Byrne JAG award documents require that from the date a city \naccepts the award and throughout the time of the award’s performance, “no public disclosure \nmay be made of any federal law enforcement information in a direct or indirect attempt to \nconceal, harbor, or shield from detection” any undocumented immigrant, even when doing so \nwould not violate any statute. (Ex. J at 19.)  \n5.  The questionnaire condition  \n67.  The FY 2018 Byrne JAG solicitation states that an applicant “will not be able to \naccess award funds (and its award will include a condition that withholds funds)” until it \nresponds to the following questions: (1) “Does your jurisdiction have any laws, policies, or \npractices related to whether, when, or how employees may communicate with DHS or ICE?”; \nand (2) “Is your jurisdiction subject to any laws from a superior political entity (e.g., a state law \nthat binds a city) that meet the description in question 1?” (Ex. I at 27-28, 52.) If the answer to \neither question is yes, the applicant must provide a copy of each law or policy, describe each \npractice, and explain how the law, policy, or practice complies with Section 1373. (Id.) Direct \nrecipients must also collect this information from all of their subrecipients. (Id. at 28, 52.) \n68.  The FY 2018 Byrne JAG award documents state that a direct recipient may not \nmake a subaward “unless it first obtains from the proposed recipient responses to the questions \nidentified in the program solicitation” and all subrecipient responses “must be made available to \nDOJ upon request.” (Ex. J at 22.)  \n-21- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 22 of 45 PageID #:691\n  \n6.  Certifications signed by city mayors and chief legal officers \n69.  The Department will not provide Byrne JAG funds to applicants unless they \ncertify compliance with the challenged conditions. The current versions of the certifications are \nattached as Exhibit K-M.6  \n70.  In addition to the certification of compliance with Section 1373 and Section 1644 \nsigned by the applicant’s chief legal officer, applicants must submit two additional certifications, \none signed by the chief legal officer and another signed by the chief executive (in the case of \ncities, the mayor). (Ex. I at 1.) A city’s chief legal officer must certify compliance with Sections \n1373 and 1644, as well as with 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a) and (c), 1231(a)(4), 1324(a), 1357(a), & \n1366(1) and (3). (Ex. K; Ex. L.) The certification signed by a city’s chief executive (i.e., mayor) \nadopts the chief legal officer’s certifications and certifies compliance with additional grant \nconditions. (Ex. M.) \nG.  The conditions are ambiguous, arbitrary, and without justification. \n71.  The challenged conditions represent a sharp break with past agency practice. The \nDepartment never before imposed any conditions of this nature on Byrne JAG funds. The \nDepartment imposed the challenged conditions without any explanation, reasoning, or \nopportunity for exchange with local governments or law enforcement.  \n72.  In late July 2017, shortly before the Byrne JAG application for FY 2017 was set \nto go online, the Department suddenly announced significant changes to the Byrne JAG \napplication process in a two-paragraph press release and accompanying press “backgrounder” \ndocument.7 The Department’s press release failed to explain how the Department arrived at the \n                                                 \n6 The most up-to-date certifications for FY 2017 and FY 2018 are available at https://www.bja.gov/Jag/ \n(last visited Nov. 30, 2018).  \n7 See Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Attorney General Sessions Announces Immigration \nCompliance Requirements for Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Programs (July 25, \n-22- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 23 of 45 PageID #:692\n  \nnew conditions or what alternatives it considered. The press release was silent as to the Byrne \nJAG program’s purpose and how the notice, access, and compliance conditions relate to, let \nalone serve to advance, the program’s interests. The Department also failed to provide any \nguidance as to how the conditions would operate in practice.  \n73.  In 2018, the administration sought to weaponize Section 1324 against \njurisdictions seeking to prioritize local law enforcement. In January 2018, then-Acting Director \nof U.S. immigration and Customs Enforcement Thomas Homan stated that he asked the \nDepartment to “[l]ook into criminal charges for elected officials with sanctuary policies” because \nthey are harboring illegal aliens. During testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nSecretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen confirmed that the Department “is reviewing \nwhat avenues may be available” to prosecute local elected officials under Section 1324.8 \n74.  Since Section 1324 was enacted almost 70 years ago, the federal government has \nnever attempted to prosecute an elected official acting in his or her official capacity for violating \nthat statute. For much of this time, Conference members declined to participate in federal \nimmigration enforcement without any indication that doing so violated any criminal statute. The \nattempt by this administration to criminalize local policy choices represents a significant threat to \ncities’ abilities to enact policies intended to foster public safety.  \n75.  The challenged conditions are ambiguous, leaving cities uncertain as to how to \ncomply. The ambiguity threatens to induce unconstitutional action. For example, the notice \ncondition would require cities to detain individuals longer than they otherwise would, potentially \n                                                 \n2017), https://tinyurl.com/y9ttqhsl; U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Backgrounder on Grant Requirements, \nhttps://tinyurl.com/ycfgbgl4. \n8 Katie Benner, Democrats Question Justice Dept. Power to Charge Sanctuary City Leaders, N.Y. Times, \nJan. 12, 2018, https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/us/politics/justice-department-sanctuary-cities-\ncriminal-charges-elected-offiicals.html. \n-23- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 24 of 45 PageID #:693\n  \nviolating the individuals’ Fourth Amendment rights and state law and thereby expose these cities \nto liability; the access condition would demand that cities open their facilities to federal officials \nwithout regard to local detention needs. Evanston Police Department regulations and those of \nmany Conference member cities’ police forces require that individuals arrested without a warrant \nbe released or transferred to court without unnecessary delay, but in any event no later than 48 \nhours after arrest. See, e.g., Evanston Police Department Policy Manual § 900.3. Such matters \nare also informed by the law of many states, which require that certain detainees be released \nwithin 48 hours. See, e.g., Ill. Admin. Code §§ 720.30, 720.150.  \n76.  Just as fundamentally, complying with the challenged conditions would \nundermine public safety. Welcoming city policies assist effective policing by building trust \nbetween law enforcement officers and the immigrant community. Conversely, policing suffers \nwhen community members, whatever their immigration status, do not feel free to report crimes, \nassist in investigations, or testify as witnesses. The Department’s insistence that cities nationwide \ngive immigration enforcement agents on-demand access to their detention facilities to investigate \npotential civil immigration violations, and that cities detain individuals solely so to allow the \ninvestigation of possible civil immigration violations, undermines public trust, cuts local law \nenforcement efforts off at the knees, and makes everyone in these cities less safe.  \nH.  The Department lacks any authority to impose the challenged conditions.  \n77.  The Byrne JAG statute gives the Department no authority to impose additional \nsubstantive grant conditions on Byrne JAG funds, including the notice and access conditions. \nECF No. 23 at 8; City of Chicago v. Sessions, 888 F.3d 272, 285 (7th Cir. 2018); City of Chicago \nv. Sessions, 2018 WL 3608564, at *12-13 (concluding that the Attorney General has no authority \nto impose the notice and access conditions or to demand compliance with Section 1373).  \n-24- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 25 of 45 PageID #:694\n  \n78.  Indeed, federal law prohibits the Department from using the Byrne JAG program \nto “exercise any discretion, supervision, or control over any police force or any other criminal \njustice agency of any State or any political subdivision thereof.” 34 U.S.C. § 10228. \n79.  Congress repeatedly demonstrates its ability (when it so desires) to expressly \nconfer agency discretion to add substantive conditions to federal grants. In the same statute that \nincludes the Byrne JAG program, Congress created a different grant program that expressly \nauthorized administering agencies to impose reasonable grant conditions. See 34 U.S.C. § \n10446(e)(3) (Attorney General may “impose reasonable conditions on grant awards . . . .”). And \nCongress expressly conferred such authority in other federal grant programs. See, e.g., 47 U.S.C. \n§ 1204(b)(2) (Under Secretary of Commerce can “establish such conditions . . . as may be \nappropriate to ensure the efficiency and integrity of the grant program”); 25 U.S.C. § 1652(b) \n(similar). \n80.  The Byrne JAG statute restricts the Attorney General’s authority to define or \nmodify the components of the application submitted by local governments wishing to receive a \ngrant. The statute gives the Attorney General limited ministerial authority to specify the “form” \nof the application. 34 U.S.C. § 10153(A) (requiring jurisdictions to submit an application \ncontaining the enumerated components “in such form as the Attorney General may require”). \nAlthough the Attorney General may require applicants to “comply with all provisions of this part \nand all other applicable Federal laws,” id. § 10153(a)(5)(D), that phrase refers to the host of laws \nthat regulate the conduct of federal grant recipients as grant recipients.9  \n                                                 \n9 See, e.g., 41 U.S.C. § 4712(a)(1) (“An employee of a contractor, subcontractor, grantee, or subgrantee or \npersonal services contractor may not be discharged, demoted, or otherwise discriminated against as a \nreprisal for disclosing to a person or body . . . information that the employee reasonably believes is \nevidence of gross mismanagement of a Federal contract or grant, a gross waste of Federal funds . . . .”); \n42 U.S.C. § 2000d (“No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, \nbe excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any \n-25- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 26 of 45 PageID #:695\n  \n81.  The text, history, and structure of 34 U.S.C. § 10153—which appears in a section \nof the Byrne JAG statute enumerating the responsibilities of grant recipients, and authorizes the \nUnited States Attorney General to require applicants to certify compliance “with all provisions of \nthis part and all other applicable Federal laws,” 34 U.S.C. § 10153(a)(5)(D)—establishes that \n“applicable Federal laws” refers only to the body of laws that by their express text apply to \nfederal grants. It does not refer to every section of the U.S. Code that could possibly apply to a \nstate or local government. \n82.  Section 1373 and Section 1644 are not applicable laws within the meaning of 34 \nU.S.C. §§ 10153(a)(5)(D). Those provisions concern only information-sharing with federal \nauthorities, contain no limits on the use of federal funds, and are textually unconnected to the \nByrne JAG program. \n83.  Sections 1226(a) and (c), 1231(a), 1357(a), and 1366(1) and (3) are not applicable \nlaws within the meaning of the Byrne JAG statute. By their terms, those provisions apply to the \nfederal government, not individual cities and states. Section 1324 does not apply to state or local \ngovernments. These provisions are textually unconnected to the Byrne JAG program.  \n84.  None of the challenged conditions concern applicable federal requirements. Each \ncondition addresses civil immigration enforcement, which is wholly inapplicable to criminal \njustice grants. For example, there is no federal law requiring cities to provide ICE with “at least \n48 hours’ advance notice” before releasing anyone in custody, and no federal law requires local \npolice departments to give DHS officials access to detention facilities.  \n                                                 \nprogram or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”); 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (“No otherwise qualified \nindividual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity \nreceiving Federal financial assistance or under any program or activity conducted by any Executive \nagency or by the United States Postal Service.”).  \n-26- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 27 of 45 PageID #:696\n  \n85.  In fact, Congress considered, but did not pass, legislation that would penalize \ncities for seeking to set their own law enforcement priorities. See Stop Sanctuary Policies and \nProtect Americans Act, S. 2146, 114th Cong. (2015) (proposing funding cuts for any sanctuary \njurisdiction that violates Section 1373 or “prohibits any government entity or official from \ncomplying with a detainer”). Notably, however, Congress never passed legislation authorizing \nthe executive branch to impose any penalty on local jurisdictions based on the refusal to comply \nwith detainer or other immigration enforcement requests. \n86.  The challenged conditions also violate core constitutional principles. Separation \nof powers principles operate as independent restraints on cooperative federalism arrangements \nlike the Byrne JAG program. The Constitution gives the spending power to Congress, not the \nexecutive branch. Federal agencies therefore may not invent funding conditions out of whole \ncloth.  \n87.  The challenged conditions run afoul of the Tenth Amendment. The anti-\ncommandeering principle ensures that the sovereign states are free to legislate as they see fit to \npromote the safety and welfare of their residents. The principle forbids Congress to \n“unequivocally dictate[] what a state [or local] legislature may and may not do.” Murphy v. \nNCAA, 138 S. Ct. 1461, 1478 (2018).  \n88.  Section 1373 and Section 1644 “unequivocally dictate[]” to cities that they may \nnot promulgate policies or regulations that prohibit local officials from sharing immigration \nstatus information with federal officials. Id.; see, e.g., City of Philadelphia v. Sessions, No. 17-\n3894, 2018 WL 2725503, at *28-33 (E.D. Pa. June 6, 2018); accord United States v. California, \nNo. 2:18-cv-490-JAM-KJN, 2018 WL 3301414, at *14 (E.D. Cal. July 5, 2018) (“The Court \nfinds the constitutionality of Section 1373 highly suspect.”).  \n-27- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 28 of 45 PageID #:697\n  \n89.  The challenged conditions dictate what actions local law enforcement entities \nmust take to accommodate federal immigration policies.  \n90.  The compliance and questionnaire conditions impermissibly commandeers local \ngovernments. Using Section 1373 and 1644, the Attorney General attempts to commandeer cities \nby directing how their personnel act and handle data under local control in order to advance a \nfederal program.  \n91.  The notice and access conditions “unequivocally dictate[]” to cities that they must \nenact ordinances or policies concerning the administration of detention facilities and providing \nadvance notification to federal officials. The notice condition seeks to fundamentally reorganize \nthe way the Conference’s members balance their Fourth Amendment obligations against their \ninterest in effective law enforcement. The access condition requires a fundamental restructuring \nof police procedures and functions to accommodate on-demand access to detainees by federal \nagents. The harboring and questionnaire conditions commandeer cities by directing how their \npersonnel must act and handle data under local control in order to advance a federal program. \n92.  The federalization of bedrock local government functions violates the Tenth \nAmendment’s anti-commandeering principle. See Murphy, 138 S. Ct. at 1477 (“The Federal \nGovernment may not command the States’ officers, or those of their political subdivisions, to \nadminister or enforce a federal regulatory program.”) (quoting Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. \n898, 935 (1997)). \nI.  The Department’s unlawful conditions will injure Evanston and the \nConference’s other members, forcing them to choose between vital law \nenforcement funding and their constitutional rights. \n93.  Evanston and the Conference’s other members now face an impossible choice: \nsacrifice their sovereignty and their residents’ safety by acceding to unlawful funding demands \nthat will undermine community-officer trust and cooperation, or forfeit crucial monies used to \n-28- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 29 of 45 PageID #:698\n  \nfund essential policing operations. The Department cannot force the Conference’s members to \nchoose between their right to exercise municipal sovereignty and their right to receive formula \ngrant funds that Congress allocated to them. \n94.  The importance of Byrne JAG funds and the choice cities now face is underscored \nby the number of local governments challenging the conditions. In August 2017, the City of \nChicago, a member of the Conference, filed a lawsuit challenging the notice, access, and \ncompliance conditions. City of Chicago v. Sessions, Case No. 17-cv-5720 (N.D. Ill.) \n(Leinenweber, J.). In addition to Chicago, the State of Illinois, City of Philadelphia, City and \nCounty of San Francisco, City of Los Angeles, State of California, City of Providence, City of \nCentral Falls, City of New York, and City of West Palm Beach filed lawsuits challenging the \nByrne JAG conditions.10  \n95.  On September 15, 2017, the district court granted Chicago’s motion for a \nnationwide preliminary injunction as to the notice and access conditions because Chicago was \nlikely to succeed on its claims that the Department lacked the authority to impose those \nconditions. City of Chicago v. Sessions, 264 F. Supp. 3d 933, 943, 951 (N.D. Ill. 2017) (“The \nnotice and access conditions exceed statutory authority, and, consequently, the efforts to impose \nthem violate the separation of powers doctrine and are ultra vires.”).  \n96.  On September 26, 2017, the Attorney General filed a motion to stay the \nnationwide preliminary injunction. Chicago, No. 17-cv-5720, ECF No. 80. Two days later, on \nSeptember 28, 2017, counsel for the Conference appeared at the presentment of the Attorney \n                                                 \n10 State of Illinois v. Sessions (No. 18-cv-4791, N.D. Ill.); City of Philadelphia v. Sessions (No. 17-3894, \nE.D. Pa.); City & County of San Francisco v. Sessions (No. 17-4642, N.D. Cal.); City of Los Angeles v. \nSessions (No. 17-7215, C.D. Cal.); State of California v. Sessions (No. 17-4701, N.D. Cal.); City of \nProvidence & City of Central Falls v. Sessions (No. 18-cv-437, D.R.I.); City of New York v. Sessions (No. \n18-cv-6474, S.D.N.Y.); City of West Palm Beach v. Sessions (No.18-cv-80131, S.D. Fla.). \n-29- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 30 of 45 PageID #:699\n  \nGeneral’s motion to stay and alerted the court that the Conference intended to seek leave to \nintervene in the case. The Conference filed its motion to intervene on October 6, 2017. Id., ECF \nNo. 91. \n97.  On November 16, 2017, the district court denied the Conference’s motion to \nintervene. At that time, the district court explained that the Conference “can represent the \ninterests of its members who may suffer an impending injury caused by the defendant’s acts.” \nChicago, 2017 WL 5499167, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 16, 2017). However, the court denied \nintervention because the nationwide injunction in place at the time protected the Conference’s \nmember cities’ interests. Id. at *9-10 (“Unless and until the status of the nationwide injunction \nchanges, there is no reason to permit an intervention that will further complicate this litigation.”).  \n98.  On April 19, 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit \naffirmed the district court’s grant of a nationwide injunction as to the notice and access \nconditions. City of Chicago v. Sessions, 888 F.3d at 293. The panel unanimously concluded that \n“the district court did not err in determining that the City established a likelihood of success on \nthe merits of its contention that the Attorney General lacked the authority to impose the notice \nand access conditions on receipt of the Byrne JAG grants,” and two of the three judges held that \nthe district court “did not abuse its discretion in granting the nationwide preliminary injunction.” \nId. \n99.  The Attorney General subsequently filed a petition for rehearing en banc as to the \nscope of the preliminary injunction, which the Seventh Circuit subsequently vacated. Chicago, \nNo. 17-2991, ECF No. 119 and ECF No. 154. Notably, the Attorney General did not request \nrehearing on the Seventh Circuit’s decision that Chicago established a likelihood of success on \nits claims that the Attorney General lacked authority to impose the notice and access conditions. \n-30- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 31 of 45 PageID #:700\n  \n100.  This Court ultimately granted summary judgment in Chicago’s favor on all three \nconditions, concluding that the notice, access, and compliance conditions were ultra vires and \nunconstitutional. City of Chicago v. Sessions, 2018 WL 3608564, at *12-13, 17.  \n101.  Even though the Attorney General did not appeal the Seventh Circuit’s decision \nthat Chicago was likely to succeed on the merits of its claims that the Attorney General lacks the \nauthority to impose the notice and access conditions, the Department began issuing FY 2017 \nByrne JAG award notification documents as soon as the Seventh Circuit stayed the preliminary \ninjunction as to geographic areas outside the City of Chicago. A few hours after the Seventh \nCircuit stayed the nationwide injunction, on June 26, 2018, the Department issued FY 2017 \nByrne JAG award notifications to Conference member cities.  \n102.  In July 2018, Evanston and the Conference sought a preliminary injunction to \nprevent the Attorney General from imposing the notice, access, and compliance conditions on \nByrne JAG funds. ECF No. 10. On August 9, 2018, this Court issued a preliminary injunction \nprohibiting the enforcement of the notice, access, and compliance conditions against Evanston \nand the Conference’s other members. ECF No. 23 at 11. This Court held that Evanston and the \nConference had standing to seek the requested injunctive relief and were “likely to prevail on the \nmerits of their claims” that the Attorney General lacks authority to impose the conditions on \nByrne JAG funds. Id. at 3-8. Notwithstanding its finding that the elements of injunctive relief \nhad been established with respect to the Conference’s members, the Court was “disinclined to \nissue” a program wide (or nationwide) injunction “absent further guidance from the court of \nappeals.” Id. at 8. Noting its own “keen interest in deferring to the guidance of higher courts,” \nthe Court “stay[ed] the injunction as to the Conference, which, by virtue of its membership, \ndemands an injunction of near-nationwide effect.” Id. at 10-11. \n-31- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 32 of 45 PageID #:701\n  \n103.  On August 29, 2018, the Seventh Circuit granted the Conference’s emergency \nmotion to lift the stay, explaining that “the injunction is limited to the parties actually before the \ncourt who have demonstrated a right to the relief,” and ordering that the injunction “shall be in \neffect as originally ordered by the district court.” Appeal No. 18-2374, ECF No. 13 at 2.  \n104.  After the Seventh Circuit lifted the stay, the Department began issuing FY 2017 \naward documents to Conference member cities that had not yet received them. The Department \nhas issued FY 2017 awards containing the notice, access, and compliance conditions to hundreds \nof municipalities.11 \n105.  Despite numerous courts enjoining the Attorney General from imposing the \nnotice, access, and compliance conditions, the Department began issuing FY 2018 Byrne JAG \naward documents with the challenged conditions to Conference member cities on October 1, \n2018. However, the Department continues to withhold FY 2018 Byrne JAG award documents \nfrom many Conference member cities. The Department’s refusal to disperse the FY 2018 funds \nto certain states and local governments adds confusion and uncertainty to the award process. \n106.  The Department’s imposition of the challenged conditions and its continued \nrefusal to issue awards to certain cities pose a threat of imminent harm to Evanston and the \nConference’s other members. Without Byrne JAG funds, Evanston and the Conference’s other \nmembers will have to shut down important local programs; change program staffing, scope, or \ngoals; or divert funds from other policing objectives to sustain the programs. \nCOUNT ONE: ULTRA VIRES \n107.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs’ allegations. \n108.  The Attorney General may only exercise authority conferred by statute. \n                                                 \n11 See https://ojp.gov/funding/Explore/OJPAwardData.htm. \n-32- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 33 of 45 PageID #:702\n  \n109.  The Byrne JAG statute does not authorize the Attorney General to impose the \nchallenged conditions on the receipt of Byrne JAG funds, or to deny funds to states or local \ngovernments that fail to comply with those conditions. Indeed, such authority is at odds with the \ntext, structure, and purpose of the Byrne JAG statute. These conditions are not “applicable \nFederal law” and do not deal with the administration and spending of funds.  \n110.  The Attorney General may not demand that cities and other local governments \ncomply with Section 1373 or Section 1644 as a condition of receiving Byrne JAG funds because \nSection 1373 and Section 1644 are unconstitutional. The Byrne JAG statute sanctions only the \nimposition of applicable federal laws; as unconstitutional laws, Section 1373 and Section 1644 \nno longer fall within that category. Therefore, the Attorney General has no authority to demand \ncompliance with Section 1373 or Section 1644 under the Byrne JAG statute.  \n111.  In addition, Section 1373 and Section 1644 are not applicable federal laws within \nthe meaning of 34 U.S.C. § 10153(a)(5)(D) because they are not relevant to the administration \nand spending of funds. Section 1373 and Section 1644 concern only information-sharing with \nfederal authorities, contain no limits on the use of federal funds, and are textually unconnected to \nthe Byrne JAG program. Thus, Section 1373 and Section 1644 are not applicable laws within the \nmeaning of 34 U.S.C. § 10153(a)(5)(D). \n112.  The Attorney General does not have the authority to demand compliance with \nSections 1226(a) and (c), 1231(a), 1324(a), 1357(a), 1366(1) and 1366(3). Those provisions are \nnot applicable federal laws within the meaning of 34 U.S.C. § 10153(a)(5)(D) because they are \nnot relevant to the administration and spending of funds. In addition, the harboring condition \nspecifically states that it applies even where disclosure of information would not violate federal \nanti-harboring laws. \n-33- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 34 of 45 PageID #:703\n  \n113.  The Byrne JAG program’s formula-grant structure contradicts the Department’s \npurported authority to promulgate the challenged conditions. Unlike discretionary grants, which \nagencies award on a competitive basis subject to agency discretion, formula grants are awarded \npursuant to a statutory formula. If the Department had the authority to impose new substantive \nconditions on all grantees, the effect would be to contradict Congress’s formula and reallocate \nfunds to jurisdictions that adopted the Department’s preferred policy. It would also contradict \nCongress’s intent to give states and local governments the “flexibility to spend money for \nprograms that work for them rather than to impose a ‘one size fits all’ solution.” H.R. Rep. No. \n109-233, at 89 (2005). \n114.  In addition, the challenged conditions are invalid under 34 U.S.C. § 10228(a), \nwhich prohibits executive branch officials from using law enforcement grants to exert “any \ndirection, supervision, or control” over any local police force or criminal justice agency. \n115.  As a direct and proximate result of these unlawful conditions, Evanston and the \nConference’s other members will be forced to accept unlawful and unconstitutional grant \nconditions or forego Byrne JAG funds and shut down the programs the funds support. \n116.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Evanston and the Conference \nare entitled to a declaration that the Attorney General is without authority to impose the \nchallenged conditions on FY 2017 Byrne JAG funds, FY 2018 Byrne JAG funds, or materially \nidentical conditions in future grant years; an order that the challenged conditions be set aside; \nand a permanent injunction preventing the conditions from going into effect.  \n117.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A), Evanston and the Conference are entitled \nto an award of their costs, attorney fees, and expenses associated with this litigation. The \nAttorney General’s attempt to impose the challenged conditions is not substantially justified \n-34- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 35 of 45 PageID #:704\n  \nbecause, among other reasons, it contravenes the Court’s order setting aside materially identical \nconditions the Attorney General attempted to impose on FY 2017 Byrne JAG funds.  \n118.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412(b), Evanston and the Conference are entitled to an \naward of their costs, attorney fees, and expenses associated with this litigation. The Attorney \nGeneral’s attempt to impose the FY 2018 notice, access, and compliance conditions \ndemonstrates bad faith and an attempt to undermine or avoid the Court’s order setting aside \nmaterially identical conditions the Attorney General attempted to impose on FY 2017 Byrne \nJAG funds.  \nCOUNT TWO: SEPARATION OF POWERS \n119.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs’ allegations. \n120.  The Constitution vests the spending power in Congress, not the executive branch. \nU.S. Const. art. I § 8, cl. 1. Absent a statutory provision or express delegation, only Congress is \nentitled to attach conditions to federal funds. \n121.  When an agency acts “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or \nimmunity,” a reviewing court must “hold unlawful and set aside” the challenged action. 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706. \n122.  The executive branch “does not have unilateral authority to refuse to spend . . . \nfunds” that Congress already appropriated “for a particular project or program.” In re Aiken Cty., \n725 F.3d 255, 261 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 2013); see also Train v. City of New York, 420 U.S. 35, 44 \n(1975). Imposing a new condition on a federal grant program amounts to refusing to spend \nmoney appropriated by Congress unless that condition is satisfied.  \n123.  None of the challenged conditions were imposed by Congress; rather, the \nDepartment imposed these conditions. Therefore, the challenged conditions amount to an  \nimproper usurpation of Congress’s spending power by the executive branch. \n-35- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 36 of 45 PageID #:705\n  \n124.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, the Conference and Evanston \nare entitled to a declaration that the challenged conditions for the FY 2017 and FY 2018 Byrne \nJAG funds, as well as any materially identical conditions the Attorney General may impose in \nfuture grant years, violate the constitutional principle of separation of powers and impermissibly \narrogate to the executive branch power that is reserved to the legislative branch; and a permanent \ninjunction preventing the conditions from going into effect.  \n125.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A), Evanston and the Conference are entitled \nto an award of their costs, attorney fees, and expenses associated with this litigation. The \nAttorney General’s attempt to impose challenged conditions is not substantially justified \nbecause, among other reasons, it contravenes the Court’s order setting aside materially identical \nconditions the Attorney General attempted to impose on FY 2017 Byrne JAG funds.  \n126.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412(b), Evanston and the Conference are entitled to an \naward of their costs, attorney fees, and expenses associated with this litigation. The Attorney \nGeneral’s attempt to impose the FY 2018 notice, access, and compliance conditions \ndemonstrates bad faith and an attempt to undermine or avoid the Court’s order setting aside \nmaterially identical conditions. \nCOUNT THREE: SPENDING CLAUSE \n127.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs’ allegations. \n128.  Not only did Congress not authorize (expressly or impliedly) the challenged \nconditions; but Congress could not have authorized the conditions because they do not satisfy \nadditional requirements of the Spending Clause. \n129.  First, the challenged conditions are not germane to the stated purposes of the \nByrne JAG funds. None of the conditions are relevant to the federal interest in the Byrne JAG \nfunds that Conference members receive or to the Byrne JAG program generally. \n-36- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 37 of 45 PageID #:706\n  \n130.  The notice and access conditions are not relevant to the federal interest in the \nByrne JAG funds the Conference’s members receive. Information about when detainees will be \nreleased, and policies related to access for federal agents bear no relevance to the uses to which \nConference members put Byrne JAG funds. \n131.  The compliance condition is not relevant to the federal interest in the Byrne JAG \nfunds the Conference’s members receive. Sharing information about immigration status with \nfederal officials bears no connection to the uses to which Conference members put Byrne JAG \nfunds.  \n132.  The harboring condition is not relevant to the federal interest in the Byrne JAG \nfunds the Conference’s members receive. By regulating public disclosure by public entities, the \nharboring condition appears so far-reaching as to instruct state and local governments how to \ngovern in myriad and complex ways, none of which bear any connection to the uses to which \nConference members put Byrne JAG funds.  \n133.  The questionnaire condition is not relevant to the federal interest in the Byrne \nJAG funds the Conference’s members receive. The information sought is not relevant to the \nByrne JAG program. The apparent purpose of the questionnaire is to help the Department \nenforce its other unlawful immigration-related conditions.  \n134.  The challenged conditions relate to civil immigration enforcement and are not \nrelevant to the federal interest in the Byrne JAG program more generally. The program is \nintended to provide funding to states and local governments for criminal justice purposes. The \nchallenged conditions actively undermine Congress’s goals of dispersing funds across the \ncountry, targeting funds to combat violent crime, and respecting local judgment in setting law \nenforcement strategy.   \n-37- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 38 of 45 PageID #:707\n  \n135.  Second, the challenged conditions would impermissibly induce Byrne JAG \nrecipients to engage in unconstitutional activity.  \n136.  The Spending Clause prohibits the federal government from imposing spending \nconditions to “induce the States to engage in activities that would themselves be \nunconstitutional.” S. Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 210 (1987). The challenged conditions seek \nto require Byrne JAG recipients to engage in unconstitutional activity.  \n137.  Third, the challenged conditions are unconstitutionally ambiguous.  \n138.  Federal restrictions on state and local funding must be articulated unambiguously \nto allow the recipient to knowingly accept the conditions and ascertain what is expected.  \n139.  All of challenged conditions are ambiguous as to what is expected of grant \nrecipients, particularly given Evanston’s and other Conference members’ welcoming city \npolicies and other relevant policies and practices. The conditions do not provide cities with \nnotice to make a choice knowingly and cognizant of the consequences of their participation. \n140.  Many interpretations of the challenged conditions raise serious constitutional \nconcerns. Where a grant recipient must resolve tension between the Constitution and a federal \nagency’s informal interpretation announced in a guidance document to ascertain what is expected \nof it, a condition cannot be characterized as unambiguous.  \n141.  The compliance condition is ambiguous, and many interpretations of the \ncondition raise serious constitutional concerns. Section 1373 and Section 1644 use sweeping \nlanguage with no discernable limiting principle. The Department added to the confusion by \nsuggesting without explanation that Section 1373 implicates a wide range of state and local \ngovernance practices, from formal laws to informal cultural norms. In addition, the Department \n-38- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 39 of 45 PageID #:708\n  \ncompounded the confusion by questioning the compliance of many jurisdictions with Section \n1373 without deciding whether the Department believes those jurisdictions’ policies comply.12  \n142.  The other challenged conditions are likewise ambiguous. For example, the \nDepartment has offered no guidance on how a city’s disclosure of information could constitute \n“conceal[ing], harbor[ing], or shield[ing] from detection” any individual.  \n143.  Fourth, the challenged conditions are unconstitutionally coercive.  \n144.  The Spending Clause prohibits grant conditions that are “so coercive as to pass \nthe point at which ‘pressure turns into compulsion.’” Dole, 483 U.S. at 211 (citation omitted).  \n145.  As a direct and proximate result of the challenged conditions, the Conference’s \nmembers are forced to either accept unlawful and unconstitutional grant conditions or forego \nByrne JAG funds. The challenged conditions threaten financial consequences that exceed the \npoint at which pressure turns to constitutionally impermissible compulsion. \n146.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, the Conference and Evanston \nare entitled to a declaration that the challenged conditions for the FY 2017 and FY 2018 Byrne \nJAG funds, as well as any materially identical conditions the Attorney General may impose in \nfuture grant years, violate the Constitution’s Spending Clause; and a permanent injunction \npreventing the conditions from going into effect.  \n147.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A), Evanston and the Conference are entitled \nto an award of their costs, attorney fees, and expenses associated with this litigation. The \nAttorney General’s attempt to impose the challenged conditions is not substantially justified \nbecause, among other reasons, it contravenes the Court’s order setting aside materially identical \nconditions the Attorney General attempted to impose on FY 2017 Byrne JAG funds.  \n                                                 \n12 Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Department of Justice Reviewing Letters from Ten Potential \nSanctuary Jurisdictions (July 6, 2017), http://tinyurl.com/ybdhf7vy. \n-39- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 40 of 45 PageID #:709\n  \n148.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412(b), Evanston and the Conference are entitled to an \naward of their costs, attorney fees, and expenses associated with this litigation. The Attorney \nGeneral’s attempt to impose the FY 2018 notice, access, and compliance conditions \ndemonstrates bad faith and an attempt to undermine or avoid the Court’s order setting aside \nmaterially identical conditions. \nCOUNT FOUR: COMMANDEERING \n149.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs’ allegations. \n150.  The Tenth Amendment prohibits the federal government from requiring states and \nlocalities “to administer or enforce a federal regulatory program.” Murphy v. NCAA, 138 S. Ct. \n1461, 1477 (2018). The anti-commandeering principle prevents the federal government from \nshifting the costs of regulation to states and local governments. Id. Where the “whole object” of a \nfederal statutory provision is to “direct the functioning” of state and local governments, that \nprovision is unconstitutional and must be enjoined. Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. at 898, 932, \n935 (1997); New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 186-187 (1992). That description precisely \nfits each of the challenged conditions. \n151.  Section 1373 is facially unconstitutional. When Congress enacted Section 1373, it \nsought to ensure that “[t]he acquisition, maintenance, and exchange of immigration-related \ninformation by State and local agencies” could be used to enforce federal law. S. Rep. No. 104-\n249, at 19-20 (1996). In doing so, it sought to “require [state and local officers] to provide \ninformation that belongs to the State and is available to them only in their official capacity”—in \nother words, to engage in unconstitutional commandeering. Printz, 521 U.S. at 932 n.17. \n152.  Section 1644 is facially unconstitutional. Section 1644 is substantially identical to \nSection 1373. Section 1373 and Section 1644 prohibit state and local governments from \nengaging in a core aspect of governing: controlling the actions of their own employees. \n-40- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 46 Filed: 12/10/18 Page 41 of 45 PageID #:710\n  \nCompliance with Sections 1373 and 1644 result in the federal government commandeering cities \nby directing how city personnel should act and handle data under local control to advance a \nfederal program. In fact, the Department instructed that states and local governments may need \nto provide affirmative instruction to employees to comply.13 Section 1373 and Section 1644 \nrequire local officers to follow federal directives and usurp the local policymaking process. \n153.  Because Section 1373 and Section 1644 are facially unconstitutional, they cannot \nbe validly enforced against Byrne JAG funding recipients as “applicable Federal laws.” 34 \nU.S.C. § 10153(a)(5)(D). \n154.  The challenged conditions impermissibly commandeer cities and cannot be \nvalidly imposed on Byrne JAG funding recipients.  \n155.  As a direct and proximate result of these unconstitutional conditions, the \nConference’s members will be forced to accept unlawful and unconstitutional grant conditions or \nforego Byrne JAG funds and shut down or materially alter the programs the funds support.  \n156.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, the Conference and Evanston are entitled to a \ndeclaration that 8 U.S.C. §§ 1373 and 1644 violate the Tenth Amendment and cannot be validly \nimposed as conditions on the Byrne JAG program.  \n157.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, the Conference and Evanston \nare entitled to a declaration that the challenged conditions for the FY 2017 and FY 2018 Byrne \nJAG funds, as well as any materially identical conditions the Attorney General may impose in \nfuture grant years, violate the Tenth Amendment; a declaration that the challenged conditions \n                                                 \n13 See Memorandum from Michael E.

Leinenweber \nJEFFERSON BEAUREGARD   \nSESSIONS III, in his Official   \nCapacity as Attorney General   \nof the United States,   \n   \n          Defendant.   \n \n \nORDER \n \n  The City of Evanston and the U.S. Conference of Mayors seek \na  preliminary  injunction  enjoining  the  Attorney  General  from \nattaching three Conditions to funds under the Edward Byrne Memorial \nJustice Assistance Grant Program.  As set forth herein, the Court \nfinds that both Plaintiffs have standing to pursue their claims \nand, further, are entitled to preliminary injunctive relief.  The \nCourt  accordingly  enters  an  injunction  enjoining  the  Attorney \nGeneral from attaching the three challenged Conditions to grants \nawarded to Evanston and to any Conference member who faces the \nAttorney General’s fast-approaching “accept or decline” deadlines.  \nHowever, out of deference to the court of appeals and its pending \nen  banc  rehearing  concerning  the  nationwide  scope  of  the \npreliminary  injunction  in  this  Court’s  related  case,  City  of \nChicago v. Sessions, 264 F. Supp. 3d 933 (N.D. Ill. 2017), the \nCourt stays its injunction as to the Conference. \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 23 Filed: 08/09/18 Page 2 of 12 PageID #:504\nSTATEMENT \n  This case presents the same issues this Court has twice ruled \nupon in a related case.  See generally City of Chicago v. Sessions, \nNo. 17 C 5720, 2018 WL 3608564 (N.D. Ill. July 27, 2018); City of \nChicago v. Sessions, 264 F. Supp. 3d 933.  For the sake of brevity, \nthis Order incorporates the facts laid out in those opinions.    \n  Before the Court now is a Motion for a Temporary Restraining \nOrder and a Preliminary Injunction brought by the City of Evanston \nand the U.S. Conference of Mayors.  Those Plaintiffs ask the Court \nto enjoin the Attorney General’s attachment of three Conditions to \nthe funds provided by the Byrne JAG grant which lies at the heart \nof both this dispute and the related case.  This Court and others \nhave referred to these three as the Notice, Access, and Compliance \nConditions, respectively.  In the Chicago v. Sessions case, as the \nlitigants well know, the Seventh Circuit affirmed this Court’s \npreliminary,  nationwide  injunction  against  the  first  two \nConditions.  Thereafter, the court of appeals voted en banc to \nvacate and rehear only the nationwide aspect of the injunction.  \nIn so doing, the en banc court also stayed this Court’s preliminary \ninjunction as to all areas of the country beyond Chicago.  While \nthat  rehearing  was  pending,  this  Court  entered  a  permanent \ninjunction  enjoining  the  imposition  of  not  only  the  first  two \nConditions contemplated by the preliminary ruling, but also the \nthird and final Condition given the Supreme Court’s intervening \nruling in Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Ass’n, 138 S. Ct.  \n1461 (2018).  Out of deference to the Seventh Circuit’s pending \nrehearing and respect for judicial economy, this Court stayed its \npermanent injunction, as the higher court had preliminarily, to \nall areas beyond Chicago. \n \n- 2 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 23 Filed: 08/09/18 Page 3 of 12 PageID #:505\n  When the Seventh Circuit stayed the nationwide scope of the \ninjunction, the Attorney General demanded that Evanston and many \nmembers of the Conference agree to the Conditions or else forgo \nthe Financial Year 2017 award.  The Attorney General imposed August \ndecision deadlines on those members, meaning the Plaintiffs here \nrequire injunctive relief, if at all, within the next few days.  \n(Cochran  Decl.  ¶¶ 42-46,  Dkt.  10-1  (explaining  that  some \nConference members face an August 10th deadline, while others face \na deadline of August 27th).)  For simplicity’s sake, the Court \nwill refer to these below simply as to the “accept or decline” \ndeadlines. \n  With  the  above  in  mind,  the  Court  considers  Plaintiffs’ \nMotion.  Writ large, the Attorney General has two objections to \nthe sought-after injunction: First, he contends Plaintiffs lack \nstanding;  second,  he  contends  that  even  if  Plaintiffs  have \nstanding, they fail to pass the bar for injunctive relief. \n  To have standing, “a plaintiff must show he is under threat \nof  suffering  an  ‘injury  in  fact’  that  is  concrete  and \nparticularized;  the  threat  must  be  actual  and  imminent,  not \nconjectural or hypothetical; it must be fairly traceable to the \nchallenged action of the defendant; and it must be likely that a \nfavorable judicial decision will prevent or redress the injury.”  \nSummers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 493 (2009) (citation \nomitted).  The Attorney General argues Evanston lacks standing \nbecause it is merely a “subrecipient,” and the City of Chicago \n(which is presently protected from the Conditions by injunction) \nis the “recipient” that applies for Byrne JAG awards on Evanston’s \nbehalf.  The Attorney General explains that he determined not to \nenforce any award conditions in any FY 2017 Byrne JAG award made \nto Chicago while the injunction is in force, and that “this non-\n \n- 3 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 23 Filed: 08/09/18 Page 4 of 12 PageID #:506\nenforcement  would  also  apply  to  any  subaward  under  Chicago’s \naward.”  (See Trautman Decl. ¶ 5, Dkt. 15-1.)  This explanation \ndoes not clear up matters nor indicate that Evanston is free from \nthe hazards imposed by the Attorney General’s August deadlines.  \nIn  court  on  August  8th,  the  Acting  Assistant  Attorney  General \nrepresented that when a subrecipient receives funds, it is the \nrecipient only who signs the contract with the DOJ promising to \nadhere to the Conditions.  And yet, the Attorney General does not \ndispute  that  said  subrecipient  must  still  comply  with  those \nConditions regardless, as Evanston declares it has had to do in \nyears past.  (See Gergits Decl. ¶¶ 4-5, Dkt. 10-3.)  Thus, to \nreceive funds, Evanston must accept the Conditions just like the \nother would-be grantees, and the injunction presently in place as \nto  Chicago  does  not  insulate  Evanston  from  that  requirement.  \nEvanston faces an imminent and concrete injury fairly traceable to \nDefendant’s actions; the City has standing to pursue injunctive \nrelief.  \n  That  brings  us  to  the  Conference  of  Mayors.    The  Court \nconsidered  the  Conference’s  standing  once  before,  when  the \nConference sought to intervene in the Chicago v. Sessions case.  \n2017  WL  5499167,  at  *5.    The  Court  agreed  the  Conference  had \nstanding, though it considered standing on a less exacting standard \nthan the one it must now apply.  Earlier, the Court accepted the \nConference’s factual allegations as true; now, the Conference must \npresent  at  least  “competent  proof,”  meaning  a  “showing  by  a \npreponderance of the evidence,” that standing exists.  Retired \nChi. Police Ass’n v. City of Chicago, 76 F.3d 856, 862 (7th Cir. \n1996).  The Attorney General marshals several arguments against \nstanding.  First, he argues the Conference represents mayors—not \ncities—upon  whom  the  Conditions  impose  no  burden.    But  the \n \n- 4 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 23 Filed: 08/09/18 Page 5 of 12 PageID #:507\nConference’s  constitution  indicates  the  contrary  is  true:  Said \ndocument  precludes  membership  for  municipalities  of  less  than \n30,000 people.  (Conference Constitution, art. II, § 1, Dkt. 10-\n2.)    \n  The  balance  of  the  Attorney  General’s  arguments  is  best \nconsidered within the framework for associational standing, which \nis  what  the  Conference  purports  to  have  here.    Such  standing \ndemands: (1) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in \ntheir own right; (2) the interests the association seeks to protect \nare germane to its organizational purposes; and (3) neither the \nclaim  asserted,  nor  the  relief  requested  requires  the \nparticipation of individual association members in the suit.  Ezell \nv. City of Chicago, 651 F.3d 684, 696 (7th Cir. 2011) (citing Hunt \nv. Washington State Apple Advert. Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 342-43 \n(1977)) (citations omitted).   \n  To the first requirement: It is not necessary that every one \nof the association’s members has standing to sue in its own right.  \nRather, it suffices when any one member shows that it would have \nstanding to bring suit on its own behalf.  Hunt, 432 U.S. at 342-\n43; accord Builders Ass’n of Greater Chi. v. City of Chicago, 170 \nF.R.D. 435, 438 (N.D. Ill. 1996).  The Conference recounts that \nover 250 of its members were allocated FY 2017 awards and face the \nAugust “accept or decline” deadlines.  (Cochran Decl. ¶¶ 42-47, \nDkt. 10-1.)  As this Court ruled once before, those cities all \nhave standing, just as Chicago did in its case.   See  City of \nChicago, 2017 WL 5499167, at *5.  The first requirement is met.  \n  As  for  the  second  requirement,  which  turns  upon  the \nassociation’s  “organizational  purposes”:  The  Conference’s  CEO \ndeclares that the Conference was founded to coordinate cities’ \ninteractions  with  the  federal  government.    To  that  end,  the \n \n- 5 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 23 Filed: 08/09/18 Page 6 of 12 PageID #:508\nConference  adopted  three  resolutions  “supporting  immigrant \nrights,” signaling the Conference’s intent to protect and preserve \nlocal decision making and opposing so-called “punitive sanctuary \njurisdiction policies that limit local control and discretion.”  \n(Cochran Decl. ¶¶ 4-23, Dkt. 10-1.)  The Conference’s actions and \nits  chief  executive’s  words  demonstrate  that  its  interests  in \nseeking  injunctive  relief—which  would  preserve  the  power  and \ndiscretion  of  local  decision  making  against  federal  overreach—\naccord with the Conference’s organizational purposes.  (See id.)   \n  The Attorney General has one other argument on this front \nworth  mentioning.    He  contends  that  the  Conference  is  not \nauthorized to litigate on behalf of its members, which is required \nwhere said members have “profound conflicts of interest.”  See \nRetired Chi. Police Ass’n, 76 F.3d at 864.  Such profound conflicts \noccur  where,  for  example,  associations  seek  to  sue  their  own \nmembers, see Sw. Suburban Bd. of Realtors, Inc. v. Beverly Area \nPlanning Ass’n, 830 F.2d 1374, 1380-81 (7th Cir. 1987), or where \nthe association’s suit, if successful, would increase some of its \nmembers’ insurance premiums, see Retired Chi. Police Ass’n, 76 \nF.3d  at  865-66.    As  Plaintiffs  point  out,  there  are  no  such \n“profound conflicts” at play here.  The Attorney General explains \nthat some of the Conference’s members support the grant Conditions, \nand that other members, like the Texas municipalities, are bound \nto  follow  state-law  requirements  that  mirror  the  federal \nConditions anyway.  These differences in policy preference or state \nlaw,  however,  do  not  amount  to  a  profound  conflict:    Those \nConference  members  that  agree  with  the  Attorney  General’s \nConditions may continue to accede to and support them, and the \nTexas municipalities are under no obligation to flout their state-\nlaw requirements if this suit succeeds.  Simply put, these lesser \n \n- 6 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 23 Filed: 08/09/18 Page 7 of 12 PageID #:509\nconflicts between members do not rise to the level preclusive of \nstanding.  See Builders Ass’n of Greater Chi., 170 F.R.D. at 438-\n39 (citing United Automobile Workers v. Brock, 477 U.S. 274, 290 \n(1986)).  \n  Finally,  associational  standing  exists  only  when  the  suit \ndoes not require the participation of the individual members.  The \nCourt ruled once before that the injunctive and declaratory relief \nthe Conference now seeks raises purely legal questions, is not \ncontingent on evidence from a specific city, and thus is “amenable \nto associational standing.”  City of Chicago v. Sessions, 2017 WL \n5499167, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 16, 2017); cf. Brock, 477 U.S. at \n287-88 (finding associational standing when suit presented only \npure questions of law); Org. of Minority Vendors, Inc. v. Ill. \nCent. Gulf R.R., 579 F. Supp. 574, 590 (N.D. Ill. 1983) (finding \nassociational  standing  for  group’s  injunctive  relief  claims).  \nThis  is  so  because  every  Conference  member,  regardless  of  its \nparticular local policies, stands to benefit by being inoculated \nagainst federal overreach.  The Court stands by that earlier ruling \nnow.  Accordingly, the Conference has met all three requirements \nto pass the associational standing threshold.          \n  Having determined that Plaintiffs have standing, the question \nremains whether the Court should order the injunctive relief they \nseek.  To win a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs must show that \nthey are likely to succeed on the merits, that they are likely to \nsuffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that \nthe balance of equities tips in their favor, and that an injunction \nis in the public interest.  Winter v. Nat’l Res. Defense Council, \nInc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008) (citations omitted).  When, as here, \nthe Government is the opposing party, the last two factors merge.  \nNken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). \n \n- 7 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 23 Filed: 08/09/18 Page 8 of 12 PageID #:510\n  Of course, the Court does not make this determination in a \nvacuum.  Instead, the Court is guided by its earlier rulings in \nthe Chicago v. Sessions case as well as the Seventh Circuit’s \naffirmance and subsequent vacatur of the nationwide scope of the \ninjunction.  In its earlier decisions, this Court found that the \nsame  argument  presented  by  Plaintiffs  here—namely  that  the \nAttorney  General  lacks  the  statutory  authority  to  impose  the \nConditions—had merit.  Though the plaintiffs at bar have changed, \nthe legislation proscribing which conditions the Attorney General \nmay attach has not.  The Attorney General once more argues that \nhidden  away  within  34  U.S.C.  § 10102  is  a  sweeping  grant  of \nauthority that entitles him to impose these, and nearly any other \ncondition, he chooses.  Though he flavors that argument differently \nthan he did last time around, it is substantially the same.  The \ncourt of appeals labeled the earlier iteration “untenable,” and \nthis Court agrees.  City of Chicago v. Sessions, 888 F.3d 272, 285 \n(7th Cir. 2018).  Said argument does no work for the Attorney \nGeneral here.  The Court believes Plaintiffs are likely to prevail \non the merits of their claims. \n  Beyond that, Plaintiffs must show they face irreparable harm \nabsent  injunctive  relief.    This  hurdle  too  has  been  cleared.  \nFirst, the Attorney General has imposed August deadlines by which \nPlaintiffs must either accept the grant and its Conditions or else \ndecline the funds outright.  Because this Court has already found \nthat the Attorney General lacks the authority to impose any of \nthese Conditions, however, the choice Plaintiffs face—to decline \nfunds  or  accept  them  upon  pain  of  sacrificing  their  sovereign \npowers—is no choice at all and is itself sufficient to establish \nirreparable harm.  Cf. Cty. of Santa Clara v. Trump, 250 F. Supp. \n3d 497, 537-38 (N.D. Cal. 2017) (citing Morales v. Trans World \n \n- 8 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 23 Filed: 08/09/18 Page 9 of 12 PageID #:511\nAirlines, Inc., 504 U.S. 374, 380-81 (1992)).  That some Conference \nmembers may like and even endorse the policies embodied by the \nConditions does not change things.  These localities still suffer \nan  affront  to  their  sovereignty  when  the  Attorney  General  is \npermitted to direct their behavior in an unauthorized way.  Indeed, \nby  seeking  to  implement  their  own,  pro-federal-immigration, \npreferred  policies,  those  Conference  members  exercise  the  same \nlocal sovereignty the Attorney General now threatens to impinge.   \n  Finally, Plaintiffs must show the balance of equities tips in \nfavor  of  granting  the  requested  injunction.    This  is  where \nPlaintiffs’  prayer  for  relief  runs  into  trouble.    The  Seventh \nCircuit recently vacated its affirmance of the Court’s nationwide \ninjunction, signaling that a majority of that court has agreed to \nrevisit the issue.  After that, this Court published another ruling \nin which it found, based on an application of a recently-issued \nSupreme Court opinion, that 8 U.S.C. § 1373 is unconstitutional \nand thus the Compliance Condition, which subsumes that statute, is \nalso unlawfully imposed.  City of Chicago, 2018 WL 3608564, at \n*11.    That  Section  1373  determination  was  admittedly  a  closer \nquestion than the earlier-issued decision invalidating the Notice \nand Access Conditions, and the complexity of that latter decision \ngives the Court some pause in awarding the injunctive relief in \nthis case.    \n  The difficulty here arises from the scope of relief necessary \nto protect the Conference’s members from the imposition of the \nConditions.    The  Conference  has  over  1,400  members  across  the \ncountry, though only about 250 ask for relief here.  (Cochran Decl. \n¶¶ 5,  42-47,  Dkt.  10-1.)    Even  in  its  most  limited  form,  any \ninjunction issued in their favor will have effects throughout the \ncountry  and  certainly  far  beyond  the  borders  of  the  Seventh \n \n- 9 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 23 Filed: 08/09/18 Page 10 of 12 PageID #:512\nCircuit.  The Court recognizes that unlike in Chicago v. Sessions, \nthe party requesting relief is not a single city—but an association \ncomprised of many—and the injunction Plaintiffs seek is designed \nto  protect  their  interests—rather  than  the  interests  of  non-\nparties  nationwide.    Even  so,  a  Conference-favoring  injunction \nengenders many of the same concerns that agitated against entering \na nationwide injunction in the Chicago case.  Prime among these is \ndenying  difficult  statutory  questions—like  the  ones  here \nconcerning Section 1373—the chance to percolate through the courts \nin other jurisdictions.  City of Chicago v. Sessions, 888 F.3d \n272,  297  (7th  Cir.  2018)  (Manion,  J.,  concurring  in  part  and \ndissenting  in  part).    Though  this  Court  found  such  a  broad \ninjunction nevertheless appropriate in City of Chicago, the court \nof appeals has signaled it may have a different perspective.  Thus, \ngiven the pending rehearing, this Court is disinclined to issue \nanother, similarly-broad injunction absent further guidance from \nthe court of appeals.   \n  As  evidenced  by  this  Court’s  recent  ruling  entering  and \nstaying the permanent injunction in the Chicago v. Sessions case, \nthe Court believes judicial economy and the public interest will \nbe best served if the court of appeals is permitted the opportunity \nto consider the rehearing now pending on these issues and express \nits opinion as to the nationwide injunction.  This will avoid \npossibly  subjecting  the  Attorney  General  and  grant  applicants \nacross the nation to the judicial whiplash brought on by an en \nbanc  reversal.    But  the  Attorney  General’s  fast-approaching \n“accept or decline” deadlines pose a problem.  The Plaintiffs no \ndoubt have a keen interest in jealously guarding their autonomy \nagainst federal outreach; yet this Court has a keen interest in \ndeferring to the guidance of higher courts and, in accordance with \n \n- 10 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 23 Filed: 08/09/18 Page 11 of 12 PageID #:513\nthat guidance, not binding up the litigation before other judges \nacross the country without an acknowledgement of the propriety of \ndoing so.  (Cf. Order, City of Chicago v. Sessions, No. 17-2991 \n(7th Cir. June 14, 2018), Dkt. No. 131 (refusing Attorney General’s \nmotion for immediate ruling on his motions for a stay and stating \nthe  court  of  appeals  intended  to  rule  only  after  the  Supreme \nCourt’s resolution of similar issues in Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. \nCt. 2392 (2018)).) \n  Fundamentally,  this  Court  has  considerable  discretion  in \nissuing a preliminary injunction.  Computer Care v. Serv. Sys. \nEnters., 982 F.2d 1063, 1067 (7th Cir. 1992).  Faced with competing \nand difficult-to-balance equities, the Court uses that discretion \nto rule as follows:  The Court issues the sought-after injunction \nas to both Evanston and those members of the Conference who face \nthe Attorney General’s August deadlines, though, in line with its \nrecent  ruling  in  the  Chicago  case,  the  Court  also  stays  the \ninjunction  as  to  the  Conference,  which,  by  virtue  of  its \nmembership, demands an injunction of near-nationwide effect.  See \nCity of Chicago, 2018 WL 3608564, at *18 (staying in large part \nthis Court’s permanent nationwide injunction).  As the Court laid \nout in City of Chicago, “[s]tays, like preliminary injunctions, \nare necessary to mitigate the damage that can be done during the \ninterim period before a legal issue is finally resolved on its \nmerits.  The goal is to minimize the costs of error.”  2018 WL \n3608564, at *18 (quoting In re A & F Enters., Inc. II, 742 F.3d \n763,  766  (7th  Cir.  2014)).    Further,  “the  greater  the  moving \nparty’s likelihood of success on the merits, the less heavily the \nbalance of harms must weigh in its favor, and vice versa.”  Id.  \nEspecially  given  the  close  question  posed  by  the  Section  1373 \nanalysis, the Court believes, as before, that the public interest \n \n- 11 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-04853 Document #: 23 Filed: 08/09/18 Page 12 of 12 PageID #:514\nwill be best served by deferring to the court of appeals rather \nthan mooting those many parallel suits now pending in different \njurisdictions.  Cf. California ex rel. Lockyer v. U.S. Dep’t of \nAgric., 710 F. Supp. 2d 916, 924 (N.D. Cal. 2008) (staying in part \nan injunction to minimize conflict with jurisdictions entertaining \nsimilar litigation), aff’d, 575 F.3d 999 (9th Cir. 2009).  This \ninterest in streamlining judicial economy weighs heavily enough \neven to overcome the injury those Conference members face in having \nto  decide  whether  to  accept  the  offered  FY  2017  funds  by  the \nAttorney General’s deadlines.   \n  Should  the  Conference  believe  this  stay  is  improvidently \nimposed, it may raise the issue with the Seventh Circuit in short \norder.  Until then, this Court believes it must hew closely to the \ndeference  required  of  it  for  higher  authority.    The  requested \ninjunction is now ordered, though immediately stayed as to the \nConference.   \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                           \n              Harry D.

Tamayo v. Blagojevich, 526 F.3d 1074, 1081 (7th  conditions  apply  to  Chicago  itself.  And  Chicago  is \nCir. 2008). To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule  currently protected by an injunction in the Chicago v. \n12(b)(6), a complaint must “provide a short and plain  Barr case from almost all of the conditions that Evanston \nstatement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled  challenges  here.

As a final argument on Evanston’s standing, the Attorney \n   General asserts that Evanston lacks standing to challenge \n  *881 the additional certification requirement because OJP \n  has publicly announced that it is currently not enforcing \nthis requirement against Chicago and its sub-recipients. \nThis  argument  fails  for  the  same  reason  the  Court \nexplained in its recent City of Chicago opinion.
