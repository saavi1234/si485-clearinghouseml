Further, to preserve the status quo, the temporary relief granted by this Court on July 17, 2018, (Docket No. 9), is extended to give Judge Sabraw an opportunity to consider Plaintiffs request for broader emergency relief. The parties should promptly present those issues to Judge Sabraw so that he can decide whether to maintain, modify, or vacate the order granting temporary relief. The Clerk of Court is directed to transfer this action forthwith to the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, to be assigned to Judge Sabraw. The Clerk of Court is directed to effectuate the transfer immediately, notwithstanding Local Rule 83.1, and then to close the case in this Court. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Jesse M.

Further, to preserve the status quo, the temporary relief granted by this Court on July 17, 2018, (Docket No. 9), is extended to give Judge Sabraw an opportunity to consider Plaintiffs request for broader emergency relief.

The Clerk of Court is directed to transfer this action forthwith to the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, to be assigned to Judge Sabraw. The Clerk of Court is directed to effectuate the transfer immediately, notwithstanding Local Rule 83.1, and then to close the case in this Court. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Jesse M.

    "summary": "<p>On July 16, 2018, a group of minor children who recently came to the United States filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs sued the Department of Health and Human Services, the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and all relevant sub-agencies of DHS, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and Customs and Border Protection (CBP). They brought the lawsuit under the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA), the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act. They argued that the defendants’ policy of taking children away from their parents and then moving them across state lines without any notice to the children, their families, or counsel, violated their Due Process rights under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, their right to seek protection under the Asylum Statute, their rights as guaranteed by the <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=9493&search=source%7Cgeneral%3BcaseName%7Cflores%3Borderby%7CfilingYear%3B\">Flores settlement</a>, and the Administrative Procedures Act.</p><p>Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that this policy harmed them by depriving them of the ability to seek counsel. The plaintiffs, represented by Legal Aid Society, sought an order enjoining the defendants from taking any action to remove children from New York state without providing 48 hours of advance notice to children, their families, and counsel in order to permit legal consultation so that they may make informed decisions concerning their rights and potential claims. “Notice” was to include the location to where the minor child would be moved, the location where the child’s parent(s) reside, and the purpose of the move. </p><p>The complaint also sought class certification for “all minor children within the New York State who enter the United States at or between designated ports of entry who have been or will be separated from a parent or parents absent a determination that the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child who are detained in ORR custody, ORR foster care, or DHS custody.”</p><p>Given the urgency of the situation, this case moved very quickly. The day after the complaint was filed, Judge Laura Taylor Swain granted the plaintiffs limited injunctive relief. This relief restrained the defendants “from taking any action to remove minor children clients of the Legal Aid Society from New York State who are in ORR custody without providing 48 hours’ advanced notice.” The relief was to remain in effect until July 19, 2018, subject to extension. </p><p>On July 19, 2018, Judge Jesse M. Furman transferred the case to Southern District of California to be consolidated with <a href=” https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16620”>Ms. L v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a>, due to the similar nature of the cases. Updates concerning further litigation can be found there.</p>",

Plaintiffs are minor children who, for \n~eliberately \nno legitimate reason, were  separated from their parents at the hands of the \nUnited States government. fAtter tearing them from their parents' anns, the government is \nr~unification \nnow conditioning family  on the parents waiving their children's rights. \nThese rights are as fundambntal as the right to be free from indefinite and coercive \ndetention, the right to appl{ for asylum and other forms of immigration relief, and the \nright to receive a fair process prior to repatriation.  \\Vhat the plaintiffs seek is simple, and \n~rocess: \nin perfect accord with due  the right to be given advance meaningful notice of the \nI \nI \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01626-DMS-JLB   Document 1   Filed 07/16/18   PageID.2   Page 2 of 32\nlocation to which they are being moved-whether that means deportation, family \ndetention or release, the right to know what rights have purpmiedly been waived on their \nbehalves, and the right to assert claims for relief based on accurate information. \n2.  This is not an action to challenge, or to otherwise re-!itigate, the \nconstitutionality of the United States govenunent's family separation policy.  That policy \nis flagrantly unconstitutional and indefensible.  This is not an action to block or stall \nreunifications between parents and children who have been separated at the Southwest \nborder.  Those reunifications should proceed with all possible speed for children who \ndesire to be reunified with their parents. It is an action to ensure that the government does \nnot benefit from its illegitimate acts by using the children's separation to force them (or \ntheir parents) to give up their rights. \n3.  Without any credible claims of abuse, neglect, or parental unfitness, and \nwith no process of any kind, the government detained these minor children, alone and \nfrightened, in facilities often thousands of miles from their parents.  Now, in an effort to \nsolve a problem of its own 'creation, the govermnent seeks to detain the children in \nfacilities that do not meet legal standards, or repatriate them along with their parents, \n' \nthereby depriving each child of his or her ability to pursue their individual asylum and \nother child immigrant claims here in the United States.  In order to accomplish its goals, \nthe government has resorted to moving children in the middle of the night from one \nfacility to another (often ae:ross state lines) without waming the child or anyone else, \nincluding the child's legal counsel; depriving the child of access to counsel; and effecting \na coercive waiver of the child's due process, asylum, and child immigrant rights. \n2 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01626-DMS-JLB   Document 1   Filed 07/16/18   PageID.3   Page 3 of 32\n4.  The defendants are now embarking on a plan to effectuate mass \nreunifications of parents with their separated children in family detention facilities ncar \nthe southern border with the purpose of either long-term detention as a family unit or \ndepmiation. Their attorneys have received no official notice of these plans and thus \ncannot adequately advise their clients as they are ethically bound to do.  See Krause Dec. \n~18. \n5.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits the government \nfrom denying any person the processes provided by law for seeking asylum or other child \nimmigrant protections.  T~e protections provided by law include the right to pursue a \n' \nclaim for relief under the William \\Vilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection \nReauthorization Act of20Q8 (\"TVPRA\"), 8 U.S.C. § 1232, and under the Immigration \nand Nationality Act Sectiop !Oi(a)(27)(J) (\"INA§ JOI(a)(27)(J)\"), 8 U.S.C. \n§ !10l(a)(27)(J).  Defendants' conduct in depriving children of their access to counsel \nfurther violates the protect~ons to which they are entitled under the TVPRA.  See 8 \nU.S. C. §§ !232(a)(5)(D)(iii), (c)(5). Repatriation absent a voluntary, intelligent, and \nknowing waiver of asylum:and other child immigrant rights by the individual protection-\nseeker is therefore a violati~n of due process both procedurally and substantively. \n6.  Moreover, repatriation against the wishes of an individual seeking asylum, \nwithout a determination that the individual is not entitled to those protections, violates the \nfederal statutory guarantee rf a meaningful right to seek asylum to \"[a]ny alien who is \nphysically present in the U':lited States or who arrives in the United States.\"  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1158(a)(I) (emphasis adqed).  Such conduct violates the Administrative Procedure Act, \nas final agency action withOut adequate opportunity for review that is ''arbitrary, \n3 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01626-DMS-JLB   Document 1   Filed 07/16/18   PageID.4   Page 4 of 32\ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,\" or \n\"unsupported by substantial evidence.\"  5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(A), (E). \n7.  Finally, a cOurt-approved settlement agreement reached in 1997 in Flores \nv.  Lynch (the ''Flores Agreement\") established a \"imtionwide policy for the detention, \nrelease, and treatment of minors in the custody of the fNS.\" See Flores Agreement,-; 9. \nThe Flores Agreement \"cr~eates a presumption in favor of releasing minors and requires \nplacement of those not released in licensed, non-secure facilities that meet certain \nstandards.\" Flores v. Lynch, 828 F.3d 898, 901 (9111 Cir. 2016). The government is \nviolating the Plaintiffs' rights under the Flores agreement by sending Plaintiffs to \nunlicensed facilities after c>btaining coerced waivers from their parents. \n8.  In order to protect class members' ability to make informed decisions \nabout their individuallega\\ rights and asylum and other statutory claims, Plaintiffs seek \nan order from this Court pieliminarily and permanently enjoining Defendants from taking \nany action to remove children from New York State without providing (i) forty-eight (48) \nhours' notice of such forthComing action to children and their counsel in order to pcnnit \nconsultation among the ch~ld, his or her closest available family member(s), and counsel, \nand (ii) an opportunity for hhildren to consult with their closest available family \nmember(s) and counsel at the same time before a relocation is effectuated in order to \nprotect the child's ability tO make infonned decisions about his or her legal rights and \npotential claims. Plaintiffs further seek a meaningful opportunity to assert their claims to \nimmigration relief and to the relief available under the Flores agreement. \n. ,JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n9.  This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U .S.C. § 1331 \nbecause this action arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States, including \n4 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01626-DMS-JLB   Document 1   Filed 07/16/18   PageID.5   Page 5 of 32\nthe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the federal asylum statute, the \nfederal Declaratory Judgment Act (28 U.S. C.§§ 2201-2202), 28 U.S.C. § 1346 (United \nStates as defendant), the Administrative Procedures Act (5 U.S.C. § 704), ~ 24(8) of the \nFlores settlement agreemeht, and pursuant to 28 U.S .C. § I 361 because this action seeks \nto \"compel an officer or employee ofihe United States or any agency thereof to perform \na duty owed to[] p1aintit11s].\" \n10.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because N.T.C., and H.M.C., \nreside in this District as ofthe date of the filing of this Complaint, Defendants reside in \nthis District, and a substantial portion of the relevant facts occurred within this District, \nincluding Defendants' continued separation ofN.T.C. and I-LM.C. from their parents. \nPARTIES \nPlaintiff N.T.C.

He is the twelve (12) year-old \nson of Ms. J.M.C.A., to whom he has not spoken since they were separated, but who, \nupon infotmation and belief, is in ICE custody.  N.T.C. brings this lawsuit through a next \nfriend as a result of his inc~pacity due to his minor status and his unfamiliarity with U.S. \nlaw. \n12.  PlaintiffN.T.C. and his mother Ms. J.M.C.A. are one of the many families \nthat have sought asylum and other immigration protections in the United States and that \n' \nrecently have been separated by the government. \n13.  PlaintiffN.T.C. currently resides at Abbott House in New York State, \nlikely thousands of miles ffom where his mother is located, although N.T.C. does not \nknow for sure as he has been unable to speak with his mother since they were separated. \n5 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01626-DMS-JLB   Document 1   Filed 07/16/18   PageID.6   Page 6 of 32\n14.

Upon \ninformation and belief, M$. J.M.C.A. may have been coerced by Defendants into \nagreeing to repatriation in exchange for reunification with N.T.C., thereby waiving her \nown and N.T.C.'s asylum and child immigrant protection rights. \n16.  PlaintiffN.T.C. has expressed clearly that he would like to be reunified \nwith his mother but that, if his mother were to be repatriated to Honduras, then he would \nwant to remain in the United States.  P!aintiffN.T.C.'s cousin lives in the United States, \nand N.T.C. would like to go live with his cousin rather than be repatriated. \n17.  PlaintiffN.T.C. wishes to remain in the United States in order to pursue \nhis individual asylum and other statutory immigration protection claims. \n18.  PlaintiffN.T.C. is cmTently represented by counsel from The Legal Aid \nSociety. \n19.  Reverend Marie A. Tatro served as a Priest at the Trinity Episcopal \nChurch in the South Bronx New York.  In addition to her role as a Priest, Reverend Tatro \n1 \nassists in the provision of legal support and social service refcn-als.

Her father, a \nmonolingual Q'cqchi speaker, has only had the opportunity to speak with his daughter \ntwo times. H.M.C. and her'. father entered the United States on or about the beginning of \nJune 2018. He has not seen a judge during that time and has not had the opportunity to \nspeak to anyone in his OWI1ianguage, other than his daughter, until July 15, 2018 when \nhe spoke with an attomey from Public Counsel. Upon information and belief, H.M.C.'s \nfather was extremely overwhelmed by his current situation as no one spoke to him in his \nfirst language to explain the situation to him until yesterday. It is unclear if he \nnnderstands the posture of his case at the moment. 1-I.M.C. herself is unclear whether she \nwants to be reunified as she has not been able to determine the circumstances of \nreunification.

Defendant U.S. Customs and Border Protection (\"CBP\") is the subwagency \nofDI-IS that is responsible for the initial processing and detention of noncitizens who are \napprehended near the United States' border. \n25.  Defendant U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\") is the \nsubwagency ofDHS that, through its asylum officers, conducts interviews of certain \nindividuals apprehended at the border to determine whether those individuals have a \ncredible fear of persecution and should be pcm1itted to apply for asylum. \n26.  Defendant O.s.

Over the past year, the government has separated thousands of children \nfleeing persecution from family members after they were apprehended together at the \nU.S. border.  Although there have been no allegations that the Plaintiffs' parents are unfit \nor abusing their children ir1 any way, the government has forcibly separated each of these \n' \nchildren from his or her pat·ents and detained each child, often far away, in government \nfunded facilities for \"unaccompanied\" minors. \ni \n9 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01626-DMS-JLB   Document 1   Filed 07/16/18   PageID.10   Page 10 of 32\n36.  On April 6, 2018, Attomey General Sessions formally announced a \"'zero-\ntolerance\" policy pursuant to which DHS would refer all illegal southwest border \ncrossings to the Department of Justice for prosecution.1 \n37.  On May 7, 2018, Attomey General Sessions publicized that, pursuant to \nthe \"zero tolerance\" policy, any child crossing the southwest border of the United States \nwould be automatically separated from his or her parents or other adults with whom the \nchild was traveling?  The ptated goal of this policy was to serve as a deterrent for migrant \nparents who enter the United States without authorization accompanied by their children. 3 \nAttorney General Sessions's statements make clear that family separation is not a \ncollateral consequence of regular law enforcement under this policy.  It is an explicitly \nintentional goal. \n38.  Pursuant to'this new federal law-enforcement policy, thousands of \nchildren apprehended with~ their parents at the border were automatically and forcibly \nseparated from their parents and transfen·ed to the custody of ORR for placement \nelsewhere in the United St~tes. This policy was imposed on all families, regardless of the \nage of the child or childre'l.  Upon information and belief, Defendants have applied this \npolicy to forcibly separate children, including those who were not yet a year old from \ntheir parent or parents and to place each child in ORR custody, often thousands of miles \naway from the child's parent or parents.  Defendants have thus created thousands of \n1 See Press Release, Office of Pub.

Plaintiffs and proposed class members were transfened to facilities in \nNew York State, often hundreds or thousands of miles from their initial apprehension and \nfrom their parents.  Upon information and belief, at !east 300 migrant children separated \nfrom their parents at the southwest U.S. border have been transfeiTed to New York State.4 \n40.  The parents of each of these children, including Plaintiffs' parents, have \nlikewise been transferred tO detention facilities across the country to await their civil \nimmigration proceedings.  ·ror instance, PlaintiffN.T.C.'s mother was transfetTed to an \nunknown location.  See e.g Krause Dec., Martinez Dec., and Rieser-Murphy Dec. \n41.  There is overwhelming medical evidence that the separation of a child \nfrom his or her parent will have a devastating and toxic impact on the child's well-being, \nespecially where there are Other traumatic factors at work, and that this damage can be \npermanent. The American Academy of Pediatrics has repeatedly denounced any policy or \npractice of separating migrant children from their parents, noting in a January 20181etter \nsigned with more than 200 ()ther organizations that \"[f]orced separation disrupts the \nparent-child relationship and puts children at increased risk for both physical and mental \nillness ....

On June 20o 2018, President Donald J. Trump issued an Executive Order \n(\"EO\") addressing the pollcy and practice of family separation.  EO 13841, \"Affording \nCongress an Opportunity to Address Family Separation,\" 83 Fed. Reg. 29,435, § 1 (June \n20, 20 18).  The EO announces that it is the \"policy of this Administration to maintain \nfamily unity, including by·detaining alien families together where appropriate and \nconsistent with law and available resources.\" Id. (emphasis added) \n43.  The EO further calls for the Secretary ofDHS to \"maintain custody of \nalien families during the pendency of any criminal improper entry or immigration \nproceedings involving their members.\" I d.  § 3(e). \n44.  The EO, however, does not prohibit the separation of families during the \npendency of immigration proceedings.  It only expresses a preference against separation \nwhere \"consistent with law and available resources.\"  Jd.  § l.  Upon information and \nbelief, resources to detain families together arc highly limited.  Neither does the EO make \nany provision for reunifyir!g the thousands of families who were separated prior to its \nIssuance. \n5 Letter from Am. Academy of Pediatrics eta!. to Kirstjen M.

Because the only opportunity for family reunification presented by the \nSeparated Parent's Remo~.al Fonn requires consent to repatriation and the resulting \nabandonment of asylum and other child immigrant rights, the government's use of the \nfonn risks coercing Plain tifT parents into waiving their children's rights as well as their \nown.

The Flores Agreement \n\"creates a presumption in favor of releasing minors and requires placement of those not \nreleased in licensed, non-secure facilities that meet certain standards.\" See flares v. \nLynch, 828 F.3d 898 (91h dir. 2016). The Flores Agreement is binding on all successor \nagencies to the INS, inclu9ing ORR and DHS. \n! \n58.  The Flores ~greement spells out a general policy favoring !css restrictive \nplacements of alien children (rather than more restrictive ones) and their release (rather \n11 Aguilar, Julian, Starving/or Reform, Texas Tribune (March 9, 20 I 0).

The Agreement contemplates that, unless detention is necessary to ensure \na child's safety or his appearance in immigration court, he must be released \"without \nunnecessary delay,\" preferably to a parent or legal guardian. See Flores Agreement~ 14. \n59.  In 2002, Congress passed the HSA, dissolving the INS, and entrusting the \n\"the care and custody of all unaccompanied [alien] children, including responsibility for \ntheir detention, where appropriate,\" to the HI-IS, which in tum delegated authority to \nORR.  See 8 U.S.C. § l232(b)(l); 6 U.S.C. § 279.  Senator Kennedy noted was the \nchange was intended to provide \"comprehensive services to address the special needs of \nnewcomer children ... tailored to address the[ir] cultural, linguistic, legal, and \ndevelopmental needs.\"  Flores v. Sessions, 862 f'.3d 863, 880 (9th Cir. 2017).  It was also \nintended to ensure that the· federal agency charged with caring for UACs had no stake or \nsay in any related immigration proceedings. See 6 U.S.C. § 279(c); !53 Cong. Rec. \nS300 I, S3004 (daily ed. Mar. 12, 2007) (statement of Sen. Feinstein) (\"This change \nfinally resolved the conflidt of interest inherent in the former system that pitted the \nenforcement side of the [INS] against the benefits side of that same agency in the care of \nunaccompanied alien child;ren.\"). \n60.  After assuming custody of the UAC, HHS/ORR must \"promptly\" place \nthe UAC \"in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child.\" 8 U.S.C. § \n' \n1232(c)(2)(A). \n61.  In 2016, the 9tJ1 Circuit Court of Appeals held that the Flores Agreement \n\"unambiguously applies bqth to accompanied and unaccompanied minors, but does not \ncreate affirmative release rights for parents.\" See Flores v.  Lynch, 828 F.3d 898 (9111 Cir. \n2016). \n19 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01626-DMS-JLB   Document 1   Filed 07/16/18   PageID.20   Page 20 of 32\n62.  Paragraph 24(B) of the Flores Settlement sets forth a minor's right to \nchallenge a determination to place the minor in a particular facility when in government \ncustody. The minor may s~ekjudicial review in \"any United States District Court with \njurisdiction and venue over the matter to challenge the placement determination.\" See \nFlores Settlement at~ 24(B). \n63.  Moreover, the Flores Settlement requires INS to \"place each detained \nminor in the least restrictive setting appropriate to the minor's age and special needs, \nprovided that such setting is consistent with its interests to ensure the minor's timely \nappearance before the INS• and the immigration courts and to protect the minor's well-\nbeing and that of others.\" See Flores Settlement at~ 11 (emphasis added), \n64.  In 2008, Copgress recognized the vulnerability of unaccompanied children \nand created special statuto~y protections for these children through the William \nWilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of2008 (\"TVPRA\"), \nPub. L. No. llOA57, 122 Stat 5044. The TVPRA provided impoliant protections for \nunaccompanied children. 15~The TVPRA protects unaccompanied children from non-\ncontiguous countries from being subject to expedited removal and places unaccompanied \nin 240 proceedings before an immigration judge. See TVPRA § 235(a)(5)(D). The \nTVPRA also gave USCIS initial jurisdiction of unaccompanied children's asylum cases \nwhich allows unaccompanied children to pursue their asylum claims in a non-adversarial, \nmare child-friendly setting. See TVPRA § 235(d)(7)(B). It also exempts unaccompanied \n15 For an overview of these changes, see Deborah Lee, Manoj Govindaiah, Angela Morrison & David \nThronson, Practice Advisory, Update on Legal Relief Options for Unaccompanied Alien Children \nFollowing the Enactment of the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act \nof2008 (Feb. 19, 2009), available at \nhttps :1/www. i lrc.org/sites/ de f au lt!fi lcs/reso urccs/23 5_  tvpra_ practice_a dvisory. in f onet pdf. \n20 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01626-DMS-JLB   Document 1   Filed 07/16/18   PageID.21   Page 21 of 32\nchildren from the one-year asylum filing deadline to unaccompanied children. TVPRA § \n235(d)(7)(A). The TVPRA also codified portions of the Flores Agreement (e.g. 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1232(c )(2)(A) an unaccompanied alien child \"shall be promptly placed in the least \nrestrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child\"). \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n65.  Plaintiffs bring this action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) \non behalf of themselves ana a New York State-wide class of all other persons similarly \nsituated. \n66.  Plaintiffs seek to represent the following New York State class: \nAll  minor children within New York State who  enter the \nUnited Statb at or between designated ports of entry who \nhave  been or will  be  separated from  a parent or parents \nabsent a detennination that the parent is unfit or presents a \ndanger to the child who are and detained in ORR custody, \nORR  foster  care,  or  DHS  custody.  Plaintiffs  are  each \nadequate representatives of the proposed class. \n67.  The proposed class satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(a)(l) because the \nclass is so numerous that jdinder of all members is impracticable.  The exact size of the \n! \nproposed class is unknown~ but, upon information and belief, there are at least one \nhundred and seventy~ five (175) children presently in custody in New York alone. \n68.  The propos~d class meets the commonality requirements of Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 23(a)(2).  Each member of the class is subject to a common threat: \ncompulsory repatriation without a voluntary, intelligent, and knowing waiver of his or her \nasylum and other child immigrant rights and/or the threat that their rights to minimum \nstandards in detention have been waived.  By definition, all class members are subject to \nthese threats and none has ?een asked to provide a waiver of his or her individual rights. \nThis Complaint raises questions of law common to members of the proposed class, \n21 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01626-DMS-JLB   Document 1   Filed 07/16/18   PageID.22   Page 22 of 32\nincluding: whether Defendants' coercive practice of conditioning reunification of \nchildren with their parents upon the parents' waivers of their children's rights violates \nclass members' constitutional Due Process rights, statutory rights, and rights under the \nFlores Consent Decree. \n69.  The proposed class meets the typicality requirements of Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 23(a)(3) because the claims of the representative Plaintiffs are typical of \nthe claims of the class, anQ each of the proposed class members are individuals who have \nbeen or will be subject to the threat of coercive repatriation or relocation without \nmeaningful notice.  Plaintiffs and the proposed class also share the same legal claims, \nwhich asseti the same substantive and procedural rights under the Due Process Clause, \nthe asylum statute, and the Flores Consent Decree. \n70.  The proposed class meets the adequacy requirements of Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 23(a)(4).  The representative Plaintiffs seek the same relief as each of the \nother members of the class.__namely, an order directing that Plaintiffs be given \nmeaningful notice prior to their relocation and the opportunity to assert their rights. \n71.  Prohibiting Defendants from compelling the repatriation of any minor \nchild against the child's wishes, without affording each child an opportunity to pursue \nasylum and other child immigrant protections in the United States or, alternatively, \nhaving obtained the child's voluntary, intelligent, and knowing waiver of his or her \nasylum and other child immigrant claims, after consultation with both the class member's \nparent or close family men1ber(s) and counseL  In defending their own rights, Plaintiffs \nwill defend the rights of all proposed class members fairly and adequately. \n22 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01626-DMS-JLB   Document 1   Filed 07/16/18   PageID.23   Page 23 of 32\n72.  The proposed class is represented by counsel from The Legal Aid Society. \nCounsel have extensive experience litigating class action lawsuits and other complex \ncases in federal court, including civil rights lawsuits on behalf of noncitizens. \n73.  The members of the class are readily ascertainable through Defendants' \nrecords. \n74.  The propos~d class also satisfies Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2). \nDefendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to the class by unlawfully \nsubjecting minor children to the threat of forced repatriation without voluntary, \nintelligent, and knowing waivers by each of those children of each of their asylum and \nother child immigrant rights.  Injunctive and declaratory relief is thus appropriate with \nrespect to the class as a whole. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT! \n(Violation of Due Process) \n(Against All Defendants) \n75.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated andre-alleged as though fully \nset forth herein. \n76.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment applies to all \"persons\" \non United States soil and thus applies to Plaintiffs and all proposed class members. \n77.  Plaintiffs and each class member have an interest under the Due Process \nClause in not being barred ·from pursuing their individual asylum and other child \nimmigrant claims through coercive relocation and repatriation by Defendants. \n78.  Defendants' coercive practice of conditioning reunification of children \n\\vith their parents upon the' parents' waiver of their children's right to minimum standards \n23 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01626-DMS-JLB   Document 1   Filed 07/16/18   PageID.24   Page 24 of 32\nfor detention, asylum, right to libe1ty and humane treatment, or other statutory \nimmigration protections violates both Plaintiffs' procedural and substantive due process \nrights. \n79.  Defendants' coercive relocation and repatriation of class members against \ntheir wishes violates substantive due process because it denies each class member the \nright to pursue his or her asylum and other child immigrant claims and claims under the \nFlores Agreement. \n80.  Defendants' coercive repatriation of class members against that class \nmember's wishes also violates procedural due process because it denies each class \nmember the opportunity td pursue his or her asylum and other child immigrant rights \nwithout any hearing or cor).sultation, much less a voluntary, intelligent, and knowing \nwaiver by the class member of his or her asylum and other child immigrant claims. \n81.  Defendants' coercion of Plaintiffs' parents into giving up their children's \nrights in order to be reunited with their children fmiher violates the due process rights of \nclass members by depriving each class member of the derivative asylum protections to \nwhich he or she is entitled ·under his or her parents' asylun1 claims. \n82.  Defendants' obstruction of class members' access to counsel further \nviolates federal law that provides protections for unaccompanied alien children pursuing \nasylum and other protections fi·mn removal.  8 U.S.C. §§ l232(a)(5)(D), (c)(5). \nDeprivation of access to counsel impairs the ability of class members to pursue their \nindividual asylum and othcir child immigrant claims. \n24 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01626-DMS-JLB   Document 1   Filed 07/16/18   PageID.25   Page 25 of 32\nCOUNT II \n(Violation of a Child's Right to Seck Protection Under the Asylum Statute, 8 U.S.C. \n§ Il58) \n(Against All Defendants) \n83.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated andre-alleged as though fully \nset forth herein. \n84.  Under United States law, noncitizens with a well-founded fear of \npersecution shall have the opportunity to obtain asylum in the United States.  8 U.S.C. § \n1158(a).  In addition, noncitizens have a mandatory statutory entitlement to withholding \nof removal where the noncitizen would face a probability of persecution if removed to his \nor her country of nationality, 8 U.S.C. § 1231 (b )(3 ).  Noncitizens have a further \nmandatory statutory entitlciment to withholding or deferral of removal where they would \nface a probability oftortur¢.

Class members have a private right of action to challenge violations of \ntheir right to apply for asylum under 8 U.S.C. § 1!58(a).  That right is not barred by 8 \nU.S.C. § 1158(d)(7), which applies only to certain procedural requirements set out in \nSection II 58(d ). \n86.  Defendants' coercive repatriation of class members against their wishes \nviolates federal law that prOvides for asylum and other protections from removal. \nRepatriation precludes class members from pursuing their individual asylum and other \nstatutory immigration protection claims. \n25 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01626-DMS-JLB   Document 1   Filed 07/16/18   PageID.26   Page 26 of 32\n87.  Defendants' coercion of Plaintiffs' parents into giving up their asylum and \nother immigration protection claims in order to be reunited with their children also \nviolates federal law by depriving each class member of the derivative asylum protections \nto which he or she is entitled under his or her parents' asylum claims. \nCOUNT Ill \n(Violation of a Child's Right to Liberty & Rights Under the Flores Settlement) \n(Against All Defendants) \n88.  All ofthe foregoing allegations are repeated and re-alleged as though fully \nset forth herein. \n89.  Immigrant children have a statutory, common law, and constitutional right \n' \n' \nto liberty and to be free fi·om coercive detention settings. \n90.  In pmticular, under the Flores Agreement, there is a preswnption that a \nchild should be released, and if detained, should be held in the least restrictive setting and \nin a licensed child-care faCility. \n91.  Paragraph 24(B) of the Flores Settlement sets forth a minor's right to \nchallenge a determination to place the minor in a pa1ticular facility when in government \ncustody. The minor may s~ekjudicial review in \"any United States District Court with \njurisdiction and venue over the matter to challenge the placement determination.\" See \nFlores Settlement at ~ 24(13). \n92.  Moreover, the Flores Settlement requires fNS to \"place each detained \nminor in the least restrictive setting appropriate to the minor's age and special needs, \nprovided that such setting is consistent with its interests to ensure the minor's timely \nappearance before the INS .and the immigration courts and to protect the minor's well-\nbeing and that of others.\" See Flores Settlement at,! 11  (emphasis added). \n26 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01626-DMS-JLB   Document 1   Filed 07/16/18   PageID.27   Page 27 of 32\nCOUNT IV \n(Violation of the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. § 704) \n(Against All Defendants) \n93.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated andre-alleged as though fully \nset forth herein. \n94.  Under the Administrative Procedures Act, a \"final agency action for which \nthere is no other adequate remedy in a court [is] subject to judicial review.\" 5 U.S.C. § \n704. The reviewing court ''shall ... hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, \nand conclusions found to be ... arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise \nnot in accordance with law,\" or \"unsupported by substantial evidence.\" 5 U.S.C. §§ \n706(2)(A), (E). \n95.  The Supreme Court explained in Bowen v. Massachusetts that judicial \nreview of administrative actions \"should not be construed to defeat the central purpose of \nproviding a broad spectrunJ ofj udicial review of agency action\" and that any alternative \nremedy advanced by the agency will not be adequate under § 704 where the remedy \noffers only \"doubttul and limited relief.\" 487 U.S. 879,901 (1988). \n96.  Plaintiffs asserts that separation, and efforts to reunify as a pretext for \nremoval is  a \"final agency action\" reviewable by the Comi, and that this violation of \nnumerous liberty interests ~n the absence of any pre-deprivation notice or opportunity to \nbe heard, in violation of the APA, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and \nthe INA, the TVPRA and the Flores Settlement. \n97.

Defendants' forcible repatriation of class members against class members' \nwishes also violates procedural due process because it denies each class member the \nopportunity to pursue his or her asylum rights without any hearing or consultation, much \nless a voiuntmy, intelligent, and knowing waiver by the class member of his or her \nasylum claims. \n99.  Defendants' coercion of Plaintiffs' parents into giving up their asylum and \nprotection claims in order to be reunited with their children further violates the due \nprocess rights of class members by depriving each class member of the derivative asylum \nprotections to which he or she is entitled under his or her parents' asylum claims. \n100.  Under United States law, noncitizens with a well-founded fear of \npersecution shall have the Opportunity to obtain asylum in the United States.  8 U.S.C. § \n1158(a).

Ail of the foregoing allegations are repeated and re-alleged as though fully \nset forth herein. \n102.  Under United States law, federal district courts have the authority to issue \na writ of mandamus \"to compel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency \nthereof to perfonn a duty owed to\" class members.  28 U.S.C. § 1361. \n103.  Class members have a clear right to pursue asylum and other child \nimmigrant protections in the United States and, prior to being finally denied such \nprotections, to be protected from involuntary repatriation, i.e., repatriation in the absence \nof a voluntary, intelligent and knowing waiver by the class member of his or her asylum \nI \nand other child immigrant *ights. \nI 04.  The individual Defendants each have a duty not to interfere with class \nmembers' pursuit of asylum and other child immigrant protections in the United States. \n' \n105.  The individ~al Defendants also each have a duty to provide access to \ncounsel to each ofPlaintiffclass members.  See 8 U.S. C.§§ l232(a)(5)(D)(iii), (c)(5). \nI 06.

FURMAN, United States District Judge: \nThis case, which was filed on the evening of July 16, 2018, arises out of the \nGovernment’s much-criticized decision earlier this year to separate immigrant parents who enter \nthe United States from their children.  The policy has been the subject of intense political debate \nand litigation, most prominently in a class action brought on behalf of immigrant parents in the \nSouthern District of California captioned Ms. L. v. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, \nNo. 18-CV-0428 (S.D. Cal.).  On June 6, 2018, the Honorable Dana M. Sabraw, who is ably \npresiding over that litigation, concluded that the plaintiffs stated a legally cognizable claim for \nviolation of their substantive due process rights to family integrity, and on June 26, 2018, he \ngranted a class-wide preliminary injunction requiring the Government to reunite parents with \ntheir minor children by July 26, 2018.  Since that time, Judge Sabraw has closely supervised the \nreunification process and related matters.  Most relevant for present purposes, on July 16, 2018, \nhe temporarily imposed a seven-day waiting period before members of reunified families could \nbe removed from the country, relief that had been sought by the plaintiffs to ensure that parents \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01626-DMS-JLB   Document 20   Filed 07/19/18   PageID.503   Page 2 of 5\ncould consult with their children and counsel about legal options prior to removal. \nThis case differs from Ms. L. in at least one significant respect: It is brought on behalf of \nchildren who were separated from their parents and are now being held in New York State.  \nPlaintiffs in this case argue that the Government plans to detain them in facilities that do not \nmeet applicable legal standards or to repatriate them as a family unit with their parents, “thereby \ndepriving each child of his or her ability to pursue [his or her own] individual asylum and other \nchild immigrant claims.”  (Docket No. 1 (“Compl.”), ¶ 3).  Plaintiffs further claim that the \nGovernment has taken to moving children across state lines without warning to counsel and \ncoercing parents into signing insufficiently informative waivers of their children’s due process, \nasylum, and child immigrant rights.  (Id.).  Plaintiffs ultimately seek to ensure that each class \nmember has a meaningful opportunity to pursue asylum or other claims or, in the alternative, that \neach class member has the opportunity to voluntarily, intelligently, and knowingly waive those \nclaims; they also seek to preserve class members’ ability to consult with their parents, close \nfamily, and counsel about these decisions.  More immediately, they seek injunctive relief barring \nDefendants from removing any Plaintiff from New York State without providing (1) forty-eight \nhours’ notice of the pending transfer and certain related information to the Plaintiff and his or her \ncounsel; and (2) an opportunity for the Plaintiff class member to consult with a parent or close \nfamily member and counsel in order to protect the child’s ability to make informed decisions \nabout his or her legal rights and potential claims.1 \n                         \n1   On the evening of July 16, 2018, Judge Laura Taylor Swain, sitting in Part I, held a \nhearing on Plaintiffs’ application for emergency relief and granted the application in part, \nprohibiting the Government from removing putative class members represented by Legal Aid \nfrom New York State without providing forty-eight hours’ notice of the forthcoming removal to \nPlaintiffs and their counsel.  The temporary restraining order expires today at 10 a.m. absent \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01626-DMS-JLB   Document 20   Filed 07/19/18   PageID.504   Page 3 of 5\nThese are substantial claims, but the question right now is not whether they have merit.  \nInstead, the question is whether they should considered in this forum or by Judge Sabraw in the \nSouthern District of California.  Having considered the parties’ arguments — made during a \nhearing held on the record on July 17, 2018, and in letters submitted the next day, (Docket Nos. \n14-16; see also Docket No. 11) — and (with the parties’ consent) having consulted with Judge\nSabraw, the Court concludes for several reasons that Plaintiffs’ claims should be transferred to \nthe Southern District of California to be considered in conjunction with the claims in Ms. L.  \nFirst, the classes in the two cases concern the same families: Plaintiffs in this case seek relief on \nbehalf of children whose parents are class members in Ms. L.  (Compare Order, Ms. L., ECF No. \n82, at 17, with Compl., ¶ 66).  Second, the relief Plaintiffs seek in this case is, at bottom, directly \nrelated to the reunification process being supervised by Judge Sabraw.  In essence, Plaintiffs here \ncontend that they have rights and interests distinct from the rights and interests of their parents \nand that the reunification process, and Judge Sabraw’s own orders, do not adequately take their \ndistinct rights and interests into account.2  That may or may not be the case, but Judge Sabraw is \nin a better position than this Court to decide those questions and to modify his own orders if \nappropriate.  And third, in the absence of a single judge presiding over both cases, there is a real \nextension, modification, or vacatur by the undersigned. \n2 For example, Plaintiffs claim that the mere act of reunification mandated by Judge \nSabraw’s orders may deprive them of access to protections set forth in the William Wilberforce \nTrafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-457, 122 Stat. \n5044, as those protections apply only to unaccompanied minors (which they are now) and not to \naccompanied minors (which they would become upon reunification).  (See Docket No. 14 \n(“Pls.’ Letter”), at 3-4).  Further, Plaintiffs contend that they “have independent rights . . . that \nare being extinguished, through apparent waivers” being signed by their parents — waivers that \nmay have been approved by the Ms. L. Court.  (Id. at 7-8).   \n3 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01626-DMS-JLB   Document 20   Filed 07/19/18   PageID.505   Page 4 of 5\nrisk of inconsistent decisions and conflicting orders — a particularly intolerable risk given the \ngravity and urgency of the issues in these cases (and the prospect of similar litigation being filed \nin other states where children separated from their parents are being held). \nThe Court is, of course, mindful of the deference that is owed to a plaintiff’s choice of \nforum.  See, e.g., D.H. Blair & Co. v. Gottdiener, 462 F.3d 95, 106-07 (2d Cir. 2006).  The \nCourt is also aware that transferring this case will cause some inconvenience to Plaintiffs and \nPlaintiffs’ counsel, who are located in New York.  (See Pls.’ Letter 9).  Nevertheless, the Court \nis confident that Judge Sabraw can and will take steps to mitigate that inconvenience.  And in \nany event, the inconvenience to Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ counsel is vastly outweighed by the \ninterests of justice, fairness, efficiency, and avoidance of conflict advanced by having a single \njudge presiding over both cases.  Accordingly, pursuant to Title 28, United States Code, Section \n1404(a), the Court transfers this case to the Southern District of California.  See, e.g., Cont’l \nGrain Co. v. The Barge FBL-585, 364 U.S. 19, 26 (1960) (“To permit a situation in which two \ncases involving precisely the same issues are simultaneously pending in different District Courts \nleads to the wastefulness of time, energy and money that § 1404(a) was designed to prevent.”); \nWyndham Assocs. v. Bintliff, 398 F.2d 614, 619 (2d Cir. 1968) (recognizing a “strong policy \nfavoring the litigation of related claims in the same tribunal”); Stroud Prods. & Enters. v. Castle \nRock Entm’t, No. 07-CV-8638 (HB), 2009 WL 2391676, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2009) (“[T]rial \nefficiency and the interests of justice weigh heavily in favor of litigating all related causes of \naction . . . in a single forum.” (citation omitted)).  Further, to preserve the status quo, the \ntemporary relief granted by this Court on July 17, 2018, (Docket No. 9), is extended to give \nJudge Sabraw an opportunity to consider Plaintiffs’ request for broader emergency relief.  The \n4 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01626-DMS-JLB   Document 20   Filed 07/19/18   PageID.506   Page 5 of 5\nparties should promptly present those issues to Judge Sabraw so that he can decide whether to \nmaintain, modify, or vacate the order granting temporary relief.  \nThe Clerk of Court is directed to transfer this action forthwith to the United States \nDistrict Court for the Southern District of California, to be assigned to Judge Sabraw.  The Clerk \nof Court is directed to effectuate the transfer immediately, notwithstanding Local Rule \n83.1, and then to close the case in this Court. \nSO ORDERED. \nDated: July 19, 2018          __________________________________ \nNew York, New York   JESSE M.
