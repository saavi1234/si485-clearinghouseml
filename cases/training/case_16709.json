    "summary": "<p>On August 1, 2018, six non-citizens detained at the Federal Correctional Institution Medium II, also called Victorville, filed this putative class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU and the Civil Rights Education Enforcement Center, among others, sued the President, the Attorney General, and the directors of the Departments of Homeland Security (DHS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBP), the Los Angeles ICE Field Office, and the Warden of Victorville Prison under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb. The case was assigned to Judge Jesus G. Bernal. </p><p>ICE moved a large group of detainees to Victorville on June 8, 2018, and many of the plaintiffs had been detained there from that date. The plaintiffs alleged they were denied adequate food and recreation time, accommodations to practice their religions, and access to healthcare. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief, claiming violations of their Fifth Amendment right to due process, First Amendment right to free exercise, and RFRA protections from policies that substantially burdened their religious practice. They asked the court to order the defendants to move all ICE immigration detainees from Victorville as quickly as possible. In the meantime, the plaintiffs also asked that they be provided with adequate health care, nutrition, out-of-cell time, programming, reading materials, and accommodations for religious practice, including compliant diet, clothing and jewelry, religious texts, and opportunities for prayer and group worship. </p><p>In September 2018, the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification, a preliminary injunction, and expedited discovery. The defendants requested extra time to respond, which the court granted. The parties then jointly requested additional time, saying they were actively working toward an agreement. </p><p>On October 26, 2018, the defendants filed a notice of settlement with the court, indicating that the parties had reached a resolution.</p><p>However, on November 28, the plaintiffs filed a motion to reopen the case. They stated that the parties had been unable to consummate a settlement. A court employee noted that the plaintiffs erroneously marked their filing as a status report but did not direct them to amend it. As of May 2020, there has been no further action in the case, and it is unclear whether the litigation remains active. </p>",

Shackled at the ankles and wrists, men in orange and brown prison \n3 jumpsuits shuffle from prison buildings to buses, surrounded by chained link \n4 fences and barbed wire in the hot California desert.  Inside the prison, they are \n5 confused, despondent, and hungry.  They are locked in prison cells for much of \n6 the day and all night.  No health care provider has assessed them, asked if they \n7 are suicidal, or attempted to help them cope with the underlying trauma that \n8 drove many of them to seek asylum in this country.  In the chow hall, they are \n9 offered inadequate and, at times, inedible food, such as spoiled milk and \n10 sandwiches that consist of just two slices of bread.  Uniformed corrections \n0 \n90 11 officers rush the men out of the chow hall only minutes after food is served. \ne \nuit8 \nS5\nLP Drive, 135-29 12 2.  Outdoor exercise is limited to only a few hours of fresh air and \nBallard Spahr L980 Festival Plaza Vegas, Nevada  89 111345 iosnuth nSelpirg alhnatni seghau,c aehgv ewesne.  e tAhko.s u  iCgf ohthr mreesacent icyoo nonafdl  tiohtifeof inmcsee rwns e sbrpaeer nakko o to radnpelpyrsa F lilrnien nEgcn ehgn,l oiPsuuhgn, hjoa,c bDcia,e sMfieonandmaal,nl yots r  \nn, 1Las \nSi 16 have stripped from the imprisoned men one of the few things that might bring \ne \nn\nO\n17 them some sense of comfort or peace of mind—the ability to freely practice \n18 their faith.  Defendants fail to provide religious services or consultation with \n19 clergy, and they prohibit detainees from engaging in group prayer and \n20 congregate worship.  They deny detainees halal or kosher meals that comport \n \n21 with their religious needs, forcing many to go hungry.  Upon the detainees’ \n22 detention by the Defendants, Defendants confiscate all religious head covers, \n23 jewelry, and other articles of faith, and the detainees are unable to obtain \n24 replacements for the items. \n25 3.  These conditions, all well documented at the Federal Correctional \n26 Institution Medium II (“Victorville”), are constitutionally impermissible when \n27 applied to individuals convicted of crimes and sentenced under our nation’s \n28 criminal laws.  But this lawsuit is not about such individuals.  Rather, it is \n1 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-01609-JGB-KK   Document 1   Filed 08/01/18   Page 4 of 39   Page ID #:4\n \n1 about immigrants and refugees who have come to the United States seeking \n2 relief, but have been detained by the Department of Homeland Security \n3 Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  Many of these men—refugees from \n4 El Salvador, Honduras, India, Cameroon, and other troubled regions—risked \n5 their lives and those of their families by traveling across continents to avail \n6 themselves of our nation’s asylum and immigration laws.  All of them seek a \n7 legal remedy under our nation’s immigration laws. \n8 4.  Since June 8, 2018, Defendants have imprisoned more than 1,000 \n9 civil immigration detainees, in violation of their constitutional rights, at \n10 Victorville.  On that date, with very little notice to the Bureau of Prisons \n0 \n0\n9 11 (“BOP”) and its staff, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency \ne \nSuit58 \nP Drive, 35-29 12 (“ICE”) of the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) transferred these \nBallard Spahr LL80 Festival Plaza egas, Nevada  891 111345 mreaesno tno5a Vb. liyc tboeIrm vdimellseicg,r rsiabutebidoje nac stdi enptgue nntihttieiovmne   itason  adh  afiornsrhhmu p mcriiavsnoieln .c   co onnfidnietimonens tt.h  aTt hcea nla own ly \n9V\nm, 1Las \nu 16 prohibits the government from subjecting this population to punitive \nS\ne \nn\nO\n17 incarceration.  Moreover, ICE itself has recognized that there are “important \n18 distinctions between the characteristics of the Immigration Detention \n19 population in ICE custody and the administrative purpose of their detention—\n20 which is to hold, process, and prepare individuals for removal [or, as here, to \n \n21 ensure their appearance at future immigration and/or asylum proceedings]—as \n22 compared to the punitive purpose of the Criminal Incarceration system.”1  As \n23 that same report noted, “[t]he demeanor of the Immigration Detention \n24 population is distinct from the Criminal Incarceration population.  The majority \n25 of the population [detained by ICE] is motivated by the desire for repatriation \n26\n                                                 \n27 1 Dora Schriro, Immigration Detention Overview and Recommendations at 2 \n(Oct.  6, 2009), https://www.ice.gov/doclib/about/offices/odpp/pdf/ice-\n28 detention-rpt.pdf (emphasis added). \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-01609-JGB-KK   Document 1   Filed 08/01/18   Page 5 of 39   Page ID #:5\n \n1 or relief, and [they] exercise exceptional restraint.”  Id. at 21.  Nonetheless, the \n2 ICE detainees at Victorville are being held at a medium-security federal prison \n3 and subjected to policies and practices designed for persons who have been \n4 convicted of crimes.  As a result of the unconstitutional treatment of these civil \n5 detainees, many have expressed a desire to be returned, immediately, to their \n6 countries of origin—foregoing their claims for immigration relief altogether—\n7 because they would rather face the dangers back home than be imprisoned in \n8 these abysmal conditions. \n9 6.  Under clearly established law, these men are deprived of their \n10 rights to due process of law, which the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. \n0 \n0\n9 11 Constitution guarantees to all persons who are present on our soil, regardless of \ne \nSuit58 \nP Drive, 35-29 12 citizenship.

Specifically, Plaintiffs ask the Court to enter an order directing the \n20 Defendants, under a strict deadline, to move all ICE immigration detainees \n \n21 from Victorville as quickly as possible.

According to the BOP corrections officers’ union, the officers and \n6 staff employed at Victorville are trained under BOP standards and have not \n7 received training under ICE standards.6 \n8 40.  Upon their arrival at Victorville, ICE detainees are given \n9 Victorville’s BOP Inmate Handbook.  On information and belief, the \n10 Handbook is available only in English and Spanish. \n0 \n0\n9 11 41.

Those detainees who have received any sort of health screening \n7 generally have been forced to communicate with medical personnel who speak \n8 only English, without the benefit of a translator, even when the detainee does \n9 not speak English.  See Ex. 17, P. Jaimez Bueno Dec. at ¶ 8 (received medical \n10 treatment he did not understand; all services rendered in English).

Ex. 1, S. Teneng \n25 Dec. at ¶¶ 13-18.

Another detainee, Jexon Rodriguez Rivera, suffers from chronic \n4 asthma, which he informed staff upon arrival at Victorville.  See Ex. 15, J. \n5 Rodriguez Rivera Dec. at ¶¶ 3, 5.  Mr. Rodriguez Rivera did not receive an \n6 inhaler or other asthma medicine upon arrival or after informing staff of his \n7 condition.  Id.

Marlon Escoto Cortez, after suffering days of stomach pain, \n28 finally saw a nurse, who only took his blood pressure, felt his stomach, and \n14 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-01609-JGB-KK   Document 1   Filed 08/01/18   Page 17 of 39   Page ID #:17\n \n1 joked that perhaps he was pregnant.  The nurse did not refer him to a physician.  \n2 Neither the nurse nor any other medical staff took any labs, ran any tests, or \n3 made any diagnosis of Mr. Escoto Cortez’s source of pain.  See Ex. 9, M. \n4 Escoto Cortez Dec. ¶¶ 15-16. \n5 54.  Many other detainees have experienced similar instances of \n6 having their known medical conditions and needs ignored.  For example, \n7 Plaintiff Teneng reports that he complained for nearly a week about a \n8 toothache without receiving any medical treatment.  Instead, he was locked in \n9 his cell and threatened with pepper spray if he continued to complain.  Ex. 1, S. \n10 Teneng Dec. at ¶ 17.  See also Ex. 2, M.

Detainees have minimal or no access to mental health services.  \nS\ne \nn\nO\n17 For example, Plaintiff Aquino has received no mental health assessment or \n18 services despite expressly indicating upon his arrival to the prison that he was \n19 experiencing depression.  Ex. 6, N. Granados Aquino Dec. at ¶¶ 15-16.  At one \n20 point, Mr. Granados Aquino told an officer in his housing unit that he felt sad \n \n21 and depressed; the officer responded, “I can’t help you right now.  Maybe \n22 tomorrow.”  Id. at ¶11.  No one followed up on Mr. Granados Aquino’s request \n23 for help.   \n24 56.  Many detainees have suffered severe trauma in their home \n25 countries or on their journey to the United States, and require mental health \n26 treatment as a result.  Mr. Rodriguez Rivera reported hearing “men crying in \n27 their beds” at night and observing men in his housing unit “with scars from \n28 cutting themselves due to depression and desperation.”  Ex. 15, J. Rodriguez \n15 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-01609-JGB-KK   Document 1   Filed 08/01/18   Page 18 of 39   Page ID #:18\n \n1 Rivera Dec. at ¶¶ 17, 18.  Mr. Colindres Velasquez also witnessed a different \n2 young man who had cut himself across his arms and wrists with the blade from \n3 his razor.  Ex. 8, O. Colindres Velasquez Dec. at ¶ 14.  Prison staff at \n4 Victorville did not remove the young man to receive mental health care or \n5 medical attention for three days.  Id. \n6 57.  The punitive and degrading conditions of confinement exacerbate \n7 detainees’ mental health needs.  Plaintiff Ngwa feels depressed and sad, but no \n8 health care staff at the prison has asked him whether he is depressed or \n9 suicidal.  Ex. 2, M. Ngwa Dec. at ¶¶ 10, 15.  Plaintiff Aquino cries “every time \n10 [he is] locked back up” in his cell because he feels “so alone.”  Ex. 6, N. \n0 \n0\n9 11 Granados Aquino Dec. at ¶ 11.  With nothing to do, Mr. Granados Aquino \ne \nSuit58 \nP Drive, 35-29 12 finds himself ruminating on “my mom, who didn’t know where I was, and my \nBallard Spahr LL80 Festival Plaza egas, Nevada  891 111345 lbcooovmreddee  rto,o na tenhsde,   waUbh.oSou. ”tI   tt hrIadev.  heaolte r1dri4 bw.l e i t hth ainngds w thhaot  hhaadp pbeeneend s teop aursa tthedat  fcroaums emd eu as tt oth e \n9V\nm, 1Las \nu 16 58.

Ex. 15, J. Rodriguez Rivera Dec. at ¶¶ 16, \n20 25.  Mr. Diallo reported that while he is locked in his cell with nothing to do \n \n21 but worry about his family, “my thoughts race and I have difficulty sleeping.  \n22 My eyes have gotten red because I don’t really sleep.”  Ex. 18, O.

As a result, I have not slept at all in the past three nights.”)   \n27 59.  In lieu of a meaningful assessment, detainees are given a written \n28 form to fill out regarding their mental health.  See Ex. 19, W. Velasquez \n16 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-01609-JGB-KK   Document 1   Filed 08/01/18   Page 19 of 39   Page ID #:19\n \n1 Ramirez Dec. at ¶ 6; Ex. 6, N. Granados Aquino Dec. at ¶ 15.

Upon information and belief, this is BOP \n3 Standard P5310.017,8 which is used for screenings of all criminal pre-trial \n4 inmates in BOP custody. \n5 60.  Defendants’ conduct vis-à-vis the Plaintiffs and the other \n6 detainees does not comply with either ICE or the BOP’s written policies. \n7 C.  Plaintiffs Are Denied Adequate Nutrition \n8 61.  Defendants routinely and systematically deny Plaintiffs and other \n9 detainees adequate nutrition and adequate time to eat even the substandard \n10 food they are provided. \n0 \n0\n9 11 62.  Upon their arrival at Victorville, Plaintiffs and other detainees \ne \nSuit58 \nP Drive, 35-29 12 were on lockdown for two or three days and received all of their meals in their \nBallard Spahr LL80 Festival Plaza egas, Nevada  891 111345 fcnreooltlzhsei.nn  g Ti nhe eltshseee.   mm Teihdaedl sls eaw.n e dUrwep iiocnnhs uethsff etiihcrie ei nPnitlt aiaainnl dtai frrfresigv wuallea, rrdeley pt acroionvneisedisse tdwe dwh ooe fra ear e sso avmnedgewetitmiacrehias a nns d \n9V\nm, 1Las \nu 16 for religious reasons were given meals with meat in them, with no alternatives.  \nS\ne \nn\nO\n17 Ex. 5, G.

These meals are small, \n20 inadequate, and of poor nutritional value, and frequently do not contain meat or \n \n21 any other sufficient source of protein.  See Ex. 15, J. Rodriguez Rivera Dec. \n22 at ¶ 21 (“Some days we receive sandwiches with nothing in them—just two \n23 pieces of bread.”); see also Ex. 10, E. Berrios Banegas Dec. at ¶ 8 \n24 (complaining of inadequate food and being hungry an hour and a half after \n25 dinner); Ex. 8, O.

See Ex. 5, G. Singh Dec. ¶ 8. \n3 64.  Plaintiffs and other detainees imprisoned at Victorville have lost \n4 weight due to inadequate food.  Plaintiff Atinder Paul Singh reports that since \n5 he arrived in mid-June, he has lost approximately 15 pounds due to the \n6 inadequate amount of food, especially for detainees who adhere to a vegetarian \n7 diet for religious reasons.  Ex. 4, A.P. Singh Dec. ¶ 11.

Defendants allow Plaintiffs and other detainees only minutes to \n20 eat each meal, and throw away any uneaten food.  Plaintiff Aquino reports that \n \n21 minutes after sitting down in the chow hall, guards yell at the detainees that \n22 they have “only two minutes left” to eat.  Ex. 6, N.

Detainees are not permitted to take any uneaten food out of the \n4 chow hall.  See Ex. 6, N.

Colindres Velasquez Dec. \n7 at ¶ 15 (detainees are not permitted to take even an apple from the chow hall).   \n8 68.  Until very recently, Plaintiffs and other detainees were denied \n9 access to commissary to supplement their meals, so they had no access to food \n10 between dinner and the next day’s breakfast.  The detainees are not permitted \n0 \n0\n9 11 to purchase all of the food products available in the commissary.  For example, \ne \nSuit58 \nP Drive, 35-29 12 Plaintiff Ngwa was told that only prisoners could purchase certain food items.  \nBallard Spahr LL80 Festival Plaza egas, Nevada  891 111345 Mdeataniyn e6de9est. a dioneeDse esn faoertne dc ioannmdtipsg’l eycn owtn aidtnhud ce tsi tovh iecsra- ànI-CnvoEist   obthru eyth  Pfeol aBoidnO tfPirf’ofssm  wa ntrhdite tt ehcnoe  mpootmhlieicsris easr.y  .   \n9V\nm, 1Las \nSu 16 D.  Plaintiffs and Members of the Putative Subclass Are Denied the \ne \nn Right to Freely Exercise their Religious Beliefs  \nO\n17\n70.  Plaintiffs Atinder Paul Singh and Gurjander Singh are adherents \n18\nof the Sikh faith.  Plaintiff Marcel Ngwa is a Presbyterian.  Plaintiff Noe \n19\nMauricio Granados Aquino is a Christian.  These Plaintiffs and other religious \n20\n \ndetainees, who include Muslims, Catholics, and Hindus, are unable to freely \n21\npractice their religious beliefs due to restrictions imposed by Defendants, as \n22\nwell as by Defendants’ failure to accommodate their religious beliefs. \n23\n71.  Defendants have refused to provide, or make available, any \n24\nreligious services to Plaintiffs or the other detainees of faith at Victorville, and \n25\nthey have refused to provide other adequate opportunities for detainees to \n26\nengage in congregate worship or group prayer.  By policy, detainees are \n27\nrestricted to their cells to practice religious activities.  For example, Plaintiff \n28\n19 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-01609-JGB-KK   Document 1   Filed 08/01/18   Page 22 of 39   Page ID #:22\n \n1 Aquino, a Christian, reports that a correctional officer denied detainees’ \n2 requests to meet as a group to pray, sing, and preach.  Ex. 6, N. Granados \n3 Aquino Dec. at ¶ 23.  Similarly, Mr. Ngwa reports that there are no church \n4 services for detainees.  Ex. 2, M. Ngwa Dec. at ¶ 9.  Vakil Singh, a Hindu, \n5 reports the same regarding Hindu religious services.  Ex. 14, V. Singh Dec. at \n6 ¶ 12.  Sarvejeet Singh, a Sikh, likewise complains that no Sikh religious \n7 services are provided.  Ex. 12, S. Singh Dec. ¶ 7.  Mr. Thea, a practicing \n8 Catholic, has no opportunity to attend Catholic services or consult with a priest.  \n9 Ex. 7, A. Thea Dec. at ¶ 13.  Detainee Marlon Escoto Cortez attempted to hold \n10 a Bible study group with about 15 other detainees in a common area of his \n0 \n0\n9 11 building.  They were told by an officer to stop praying, and they did not have \ne \nSuit58 \nP Drive, 35-29 12 the right to assemble or pray.  Ex. 9, M. Escoto Cortez Dec. ¶ 9.  Mr. O.

The detainees have been unable to replace those items.  Plaintiffs \n18 Gurjinder Singh and Atinder Paul Singh have both had their turbans and kara \n19 bracelets confiscated.  Atinder Paul Singh has made repeated requests for a \n20 head covering and was told it was not allowed.  See Ex. 4, A.P. Singh Dec. at \n \n21 ¶ 9; Ex. 5, G.

Singh \n23 Dec. at ¶ 4-9 (Sikh religious headwear and bracelet taken away). \n24 73.  Plaintiffs and other detainees are also denied access to religious \n25 texts.  Plaintiff Aquino reported that “I had a Bible in my backpack when I \n26 crossed the border.  I have asked to have it back but was told I couldn’t.  I have \n27 seen other detainees ask for Bibles, and they were told there weren’t any in \n28 Spanish.”  Ex. 6, N. Granados Aquino at ¶¶ 24-25.  See also Ex. 18, O.

Rodriguez Rivera Dec. at ¶ 15 (in response to multiple \n2 requests for a Bible, detainee told “there are no Bibles here.”). \n3 74.  Some Sikh detainees, including Plaintiff A.P. Singh, were told \n4 that they could purchase religious head coverings for $10 at the commissary.  \n5 See Ex. 4, A.P. Singh Dec. at ¶ 10.  Not all of the detainees have money on \n6 their books to be able to purchase their covering.  None of the detainees has \n7 received a head covering.  Id. \n8 75.  Plaintiffs and other detainees are not offered diets that comport \n9 with their religious beliefs.  Vegetarian meals offered to members of the Sikh \n10 faith are woefully inadequate nutritionally.  Plaintiffs G. Singh and A.P. Singh \n0 \n0\n9 11 and other practicing Sikhs have been forced to go hungry to avoid food that \ne \nSuit58 \nP Drive, 35-29 12 violates their religious beliefs.

Defendants’ refusal to provide detainees with religious services \n \n21 and clergy access, and their refusal to meet detainees’ religious dietary needs, \n22 as well as their restrictions on religious items and texts, severely impede or \n23 outright prevent Plaintiffs and the other detainees from practicing these \n24 sincerely held religious beliefs and force them to violate their religious beliefs \n25 in many instances.  Plaintiffs’ and the other detainees’ inability to freely \n26 practice these religious beliefs has been—and continues to be—a cause of \n27 immeasurable distress for them. \n28\n21 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-01609-JGB-KK   Document 1   Filed 08/01/18   Page 24 of 39   Page ID #:24\n \n1 78.  Defendants’ conduct vis-à-vis the Plaintiffs’ and the other \n2 detainees’ religious practices does not comply with either ICE or the BOP’s \n3 written policies, which expressly permit the very sort of religious practices that \n4 detainees seek to engage in here.   \n5 E.  The Conditions at Victorville are Unnecessarily Restrictive and \nPunitive \n6\n7 79.  Plaintiffs and other detainees are subjected to conditions at \n8 Victorville that are unnecessarily restrictive to fulfill the government’s \n9 purported objectives of ensuring that immigrants appear at future immigration \n10 proceedings. \n0 \n0\n9 11 80.  Upon transferring Plaintiffs and other detainees to Victorville, \ne \nSuit58 \nP Drive, 35-29 12 Defendants maintained a 24-hour lockdown for three or more days, during \nBallard Spahr LL80 Festival Plaza egas, Nevada  891 111345 wianthtcoilcrunhde itynim gv eies xiPteslra,c iminsteei,fa flfssr ,ew eoe rtr isemh noeo,w tt eealrleslp.o h wSoeendee  Et coxa l.le l4sa,,v  Aree .ltPihg.e iSioriu ncseg slhles rD vfoeiccr e.a s¶n,  y8p  er(erPsalosanoinantl,i  fofr  \n9V\nm, 1Las \nu 16 was not allowed to make a phone call for the first week he was at Victorville); \nS\ne \nn\nO\n17 Ex. 5, G.

Victorville was so unprepared for the influx of detainees in June \n24 that Defendants issued to the men only one set of clothing upon their arrival at \n25 Victorville.  Defendants did not issue another set of clean clothing, including \n26 clean undergarments, to detainees for approximately the first two to three \n27 weeks the detainees were at the prison.

Mr. Rodriguez Rivera reported that for over a \n4 month, he washed his prison jumpsuit with hand soap in the toilet in his cell \n5 because of the lack of clean clothing or laundry services.  The only clean \n6 jumpsuit offered to Mr. Rodriguez Rivera was size 8X—so large that he could \n7 not move while wearing it.  See Ex. 15, J. Rodriguez Rivera Dec. at ¶ 23.  See \n8 also Ex. 10, E.

The amount of time that Plaintiffs are permitted to spend in indoor \n18 common areas is also severely limited.  Defendants require Plaintiffs and other \n19 immigration detainees to be locked in their cells whenever the prison’s general \n20 population of prisoners are being moved throughout the facility, resulting in \n \n21 several hours of lockdown each day that Plaintiffs would not experience if they \n22 were not being imprisoned in the same facility as prisoners.

Padilla Flores Dec. at \n25 ¶ 3 (lockdown 24 hours per day on weekends for the first month at Victorville). \n26 84.  From June 8 through July 13, 2018, there were no clocks \n27 anywhere in the cell blocks in which the Plaintiffs and other civil detainees are \n28\n23 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-01609-JGB-KK   Document 1   Filed 08/01/18   Page 26 of 39   Page ID #:26\n \n1 imprisoned.  As a result, they had no way to tell the time of day or to mark the \n2 passage of time, which added to their sensory deprivation and disorientation. \n3 85.  Detainees have no access to educational or other programming, \n4 work opportunities, or even reading materials in languages they understand.  \n5 For example, Plaintiff Atinder Paul Singh reports that there are no books in his \n6 building in a language he can understand.  Ex. 4, A.P. Singh Dec. at ¶ 7.  \n7 Mr. Rodriguez Rivera was detained alone in a small cell, with no radio or \n8 television.  There was one TV in the common space of his housing unit, which \n9 he could see through the door of his cell, but the television was muted \n10 throughout the day.  Mr. Rodriguez Rivera was unable even to access a book in \n0 \n0\n9 11 Spanish for over a month, despite his repeated requests.  Ex. 15, J.

The Plaintiffs and other civil detainees are forced to wear prison \n20 uniforms, and when they are transported to or from Victorville, they are \n \n21 shackled like convicted prisoners.  Their hands are cuffed to belly chains, and \n22 they wear ankle shackles that connect their feet via a short chain that severely \n23 limits their ability to walk normally.  Plaintiff Aquino reports that “[w]hen I \n24 was moved to Victorville, I was shackled.  I had handcuffs on my wrists and \n25 they were tied to a belly chain.  I also had a chain between my ankles and cuffs \n26 around my ankles.  The ankle cuffs cut my skin.  .  .  .  We were shackled for \n27 the whole bus ride, which was 4 or 5 hours long.  I have never been chained \n28 like that in my life.”  Ex. 6, N.

Upon his arrival at Victorville, Plaintiff Aquino was informed by \n2 an officer that “the more food you ask for, the less we’re going to give you.  \n3 The more you ask us to let you out, the less we’re going to.”  Id. at 6.  Mr. \n4 Granados Aquino was still shackled at the time.  Id.  Correctional officers at \n5 Victorville informed Plaintiff Teneng that “the rules at a federal prison are \n6 stricter than a jail.”  Ex. 1, S. Teneng Dec. at ¶ 7.   \n7 89.  When he was suffering excruciating pain from a kidney stone, \n8 Plaintiff Antush Kumar was transported to the hospital in full shackles.  While \n9 at the local hospital receiving treatment, he was chained to the hospital bed \n10 despite the lack of any indicia that he was a threat to any others in the hospital.  \n0 \n0\n9 11 Ex. 3, A.

Faced with harsh, punitive conditions, some detainees have been \n19 coerced into abandoning their immigration claims and returning to their home \n20 countries rather than remain incarcerated at Victorville.  Emerson Berrios \n \n21 Banegas, who had planned to seek asylum, reported, “I signed papers agreeing \n22 to be deported.  I do not want to go back but I signed the papers because I do \n23 not like being treated like a criminal prisoner.”  See Ex. 10, E. Berrios Banegas \n24 Dec. at ¶ 3.  Detainees who came to this country to exercise their right to seek \n25 asylum have expressed shock at the conditions of their confinement.  Plaintiff \n26 Teneng said, “I didn’t expect to be sent to prison.  I came here as an asylum \n27 seeker, seeking liberty.”  Ex. 1, S. Teneng Dec. at ¶ 17.  Similarly, Mr. Diallo \n28\n25 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-01609-JGB-KK   Document 1   Filed 08/01/18   Page 28 of 39   Page ID #:28\n \n1 said, “I don’t understand why I am being held in a prison since I am just an \n2 immigrant asking for asylum.”  Ex. 18, O. Diallo Dec. at ¶ 10 \n3 92.  Plaintiffs are detained ostensibly to ensure their appearance at \n4 immigration proceedings, but detainees report that they have not spoken to ICE \n5 officials regarding their cases.  Plaintiff Aquino reports that he has been unable \n6 to access information about his immigration case.  Ex. 6, N. Granados Aquino \n7 Dec. at ¶ 19.  Detainees have been told that their immigration cases will not \n8 proceed until they are moved to an immigration detention center, such as the \n9 nearby Adelanto facility.  ICE agents told Mr. Granados Aquino “to think of \n10 Victorville like a hotel.”  Id.   \n0 \n0\n9 11 93.  These individuals are not being detained because they stand \ne \nSuit58 \nP Drive, 35-29 12 accused of a crime, much less convicted of one.

On information and belief, ICE routinely detains immigrants in \nS\ne \nn\nO\n17 conditions that are far less restrictive and punitive than those at Victorville.  \n18 The conditions to which Defendants are subjecting Plaintiffs and other \n19 detainees violate their own standards applicable at other facilities where ICE \n20 detainees are held.   \n \n21 95.  Significantly less restrictive and more humane means exist of \n22 ensuring civil detainees’ appearance at immigration proceedings.  For example, \n23 Defendants offer to some individuals the opportunity to parole into the United \n24 States on their own recognizance.  Additionally, Defendants maintain a bond \n25 system whereby individuals may be released upon posting a cash bond as low \n26 as $1,500.  Some released individuals are required to wear a GPS-enabled \n27 ankle monitoring device while others are not.   \n28\n26 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-01609-JGB-KK   Document 1   Filed 08/01/18   Page 29 of 39   Page ID #:29\n \n1 96.  The conditions of confinement at Victorville, and the very \n2 deprivation of the Plaintiffs’ liberty, are excessive in relation to, and not \n3 reasonably related to, the legitimate objective of ensuring Plaintiffs’ and other \n4 detainees’ appearances at future immigration proceedings.  \n5 97.  The BOP’s Program Statement on Religious Beliefs and Practices, \n6 Victorville USP’s Inmate Handbook, and ICE’s Religious Practices and Policy \n7 all represent less restrictive means that could be used by Defendants.   \n8 II.

Defendants have been and are aware of the conditions and \n20 deprivations complained of herein.  In the alternative, Defendants have acted \n \n21 with deliberate indifference regarding the conduct and conditions described \n22 herein. \n23 103.  Plaintiffs and putative class members have no plain, adequate, or \n24 speedy remedy at law. \n25 III.  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n26 104.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1-103 \n27 of this Complaint as if fully set out herein. \n28\n27 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-01609-JGB-KK   Document 1   Filed 08/01/18   Page 30 of 39   Page ID #:30\n \n1 105.  Plaintiffs Stephenson Awah Teneng, Marcel Ngwa, Ankush \n2 Kumar, Gurjinder Singh, Atinder Paul Singh, and Noe Mauricio Granados \n3 Aquino bring this action on behalf of themselves and all other persons who are \n4 similarly situated, pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a), 23(b)(1), \n5 and 23(b)(2), and in compliance with Local Rule 23-3. \n6 106.  With respect to the First Claim herein, Plaintiffs seek to represent \n7 a class (the “Civil Detainee Class”) consisting of:  “All persons who are now, \n8 or in the future will be, in the legal custody of the U.S. Immigrations and \n9 Customs Enforcement (‘ICE’) and housed at Federal Correctional Institution \n10 (‘FCI’) Victorville.”  \n0 \n0\n9 11 107.  There are multiple questions of law and fact common to the \ne \nSuit58 \nP Drive, 35-29 12 putative Civil Detainee Class, including: \nBallard Spahr LL80 Festival Plaza egas, Nevada  891 111345 ab..

Whether civil detainees at Victorville are confined in conditions \n20 similar to, or more restrictive than, persons convicted of criminal \n \n21 offenses; and \n22 e.  Whether deprivation of the aforementioned results in \n23 constitutional or statutory violations.   \n24 108.  The putative Civil Detainee Class is so numerous that joinder of \n25 all members would be impracticable.  There are currently approximately 1,000 \n26 civil detainees imprisoned at Victorville.  The putative Civil Detainee Class is \n27 fluid, with detainees arriving at and leaving Victorville every day, making \n28 joinder of all members not just impracticable but impossible.   \n28 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-01609-JGB-KK   Document 1   Filed 08/01/18   Page 31 of 39   Page ID #:31\n \n1 109.  Prosecution of separate actions by individual class members \n2 would create a risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to \n3 individual class members that would establish incompatible standards of \n4 conduct for defendants, or adjudications with respect to individual class \n5 members that, as a practical matter, would be dispositive of the interests of \n6 other members not parties to the individual adjudications or would \n7 substantially impair their ability to protect their interests. \n8 110.  The claims of the Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the \n9 putative Civil Detainee Class.  Each of the Plaintiffs, like all putative class \n10 members in the Civil Detainee Class, is a civil detainee at Victorville, subject \n0 \n0\n9 11 to the same conditions of confinement challenged here.  The claims of the \ne \nSuit58 \nP Drive, 35-29 12 Plaintiffs arise from the same policies, practices, and courses of conduct, and \nBallard Spahr LL80 Festival Plaza egas, Nevada  891 111345 tchlaeiimr csl1 aa1irm1e..s     aArell b oafs ethde o Pnl athinet isfafms we itlhl efoariryl yo fa nladw a dase qthuea tCeliyv irle Dpreetsaeinnet eth Ce lass’s \n9V\nm, 1Las \nu 16 interests of all members of the putative Civil Detainee Class because they seek \nS\ne \nn\nO\n17 relief on behalf of the class they represent as a whole and have no interest \n18 antagonistic to other members of the class.

Counsel are experienced in class action, complex litigation, detention \n23 and prisoners’ rights litigation, religious liberty law, and constitutional law \n24 generally. \n25 Religious Freedom Subclass \n26 112.  With respect to the Second and Third Claims herein, Plaintiffs \n27 Marcel Ngwa, Atinder Paul Singh, Gurjinder Singh, and Noe Mauricio \n28 Granados Aquino further seek to represent a subclass (the “Religious Freedom \n29 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-01609-JGB-KK   Document 1   Filed 08/01/18   Page 32 of 39   Page ID #:32\n \n1 Subclass”) consisting of: “All religious persons who are now, or in the future \n2 will be, in the legal custody of ICE and housed at FCI Victorville, and whose \n3 ability to practice their religious beliefs is or would be impeded or substantially \n4 burdened by Defendants’ policies and practices.” \n5 113.  There are multiple questions of law and fact common to the \n6 putative Religious Freedom Subclass, including: \n7 a.  The sufficiency of access to religious services or other \n8 adequate opportunities for group prayer, congregate \n9 worship, or consultation with clergy for civil detainees at \n10 Victorville;  \n0 \n0\n9 11 b.  The sufficiency of access to meals that comport with \ne \nSuit58 \nP Drive, 35-29 12 detainees’ religious beliefs for civil detainees at Victorville;  \nBallard Spahr LL80 Festival Plaza egas, Nevada  891 111345 c.  cTreihvlieigl  sidoueuftfsai cihnieeeanedcswy a eto aVfr ,ai ccjetcowersevsli rltyloe, ; ta h ned p ootshseers srieoling aionuds  witeeamrisn fgo ro f \n9V\nm, 1Las \nu 16 d.

Whether deprivation of the aforementioned impermissibly \n19 infringes on detainees’ religious exercise; and \n20 f.  Whether deprivation of the aforementioned results in \n \n21 constitutional or statutory violations.   \n22 114.  The putative Religious Freedom Subclass is so numerous that \n23 joinder of all members would be impracticable.  The precise number of the \n24 subclass is difficult to ascertain, as Defendants do not track or report detainees’ \n25 religious beliefs, but upon information and belief, Plaintiffs estimate that it is at \n26 least 150.  Moreover, the putative Religious Freedom Subclass is fluid, with \n27 detainees arriving at and leaving Victorville every day, making joinder of all \n28 members not just impracticable but impossible.   \n30 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-01609-JGB-KK   Document 1   Filed 08/01/18   Page 33 of 39   Page ID #:33\n \n1 115.  Prosecution of separate actions by individual class members \n2 would create a risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to \n3 individual class members that would establish incompatible standards of \n4 conduct for defendants, or adjudications with respect to individual class \n5 members that, as a practical matter, would be dispositive of the interests of \n6 other members not parties to the individual adjudications or would \n7 substantially impair their ability to protect their interests. \n8 116.  The claims of Plaintiffs Marcel Ngwa, Atinder Paul Singh, \n9 Gurjinder Singh, and Noe Mauricio Granados Aquino are typical of the claims \n10 of the putative Religious Freedom Subclass, since their claims arise from the \n0 \n0\n9 11 same policies, practices, and courses of conduct, and their claims are based on \ne \nSuit58 \nP Drive, 35-29 12 the same theory of law as the Religious Freedom Subclass’s claims are.   \nBallard Spahr LL80 Festival Plaza egas, Nevada  891 111345 iNnoteer eMs1tas1u 7or.if c aiolPl  lGmairenamtnifabfdeso rMss  oAafrq ctuehlie nN pogu wwtaiatlil,v  fAea itRrinleydl ieagrni odPu aasud lFe Sqreiuneagdtehol,my G  rSueurpjbriencsldaeesnrst   Sbthienecg ahu,s aen d \n9V\nm, 1Las \nu 16 they seek relief on behalf of the class they represent as a whole and have no \nS\ne \nn\nO\n17 interest antagonistic to other members of the class.

CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n25 FIRST CLAIM \n(Violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment \n26 to the United States Constitution) \n27 118.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1-116 \n28 of this Complaint as if fully set out herein. \n31 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-01609-JGB-KK   Document 1   Filed 08/01/18   Page 34 of 39   Page ID #:34\n \n1 119.  Due process prohibits the use of detention as a means of punishing \n2 civil detainees.  Zadvydas v.  Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 690-91 (2001) \n3 (acknowledging that immigration detention is civil); Jones v. Blanas, 393 F.3d \n4 918, 932 (9th Cir. 2004); King v. County of Los Angeles, 885 F.3d 548 (9th Cir. \n5 2018). \n6 120.  As the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has \n7 held, “[A civil] detainee is entitled to ‘more considerate treatment’ than his \n8 criminally detained counterparts.  .  .  .  Therefore, when a [civil] detainee is \n9 confined in conditions identical to, similar to, or more restrictive than those in \n10 which criminal counterparts are held, we presume that the detainee is being \n0 \n0\n9 11 subjected to ‘punishment.’”  Jones, 393 F.3d at 933 (citations omitted) \ne \nSuit58 \nP Drive, 35-29 12 (emphasis added). \nBallard Spahr LL80 Festival Plaza egas, Nevada  891 111345 dJoetnaeisn ep1er2se1 sa.u t mVApiscti taoonnr v iinisl ilttehi aealrr emef eoaqtrteue irtvr, iaBglgeOnePrt e tpdoo  iclnirc itmyh iimsn aaclka e“sesp .rc el-etarira tlh iantm thaatet sI.C”9E   The \n9V\nm, 1Las \nu 16 122.  In addition, conditions of confinement that are expressly intended \nS\ne \nn\nO\n17 to punish, that are not reasonably related to a legitimate governmental \n18 objective, or that are excessive in relation to that objective, constitute \n19 punishment in violation of the due process clause. \n20 123.  The conditions of confinement at Victorville for immigration civil \n \n21 detainees violate the Due Process Clause. \n22 124.  For example, Defendants have deprived and continue to deprive \n23 Plaintiffs and putative class members imprisoned at Victorville of adequate and \n24 necessary health care by, without limitation: \n25 a.  Failing to provide sufficient medical and mental health \n26 screenings to civil detainees upon their arrival at \n27                                                  \n9 See BOP Program Statement 7331.04, available at \n28 https://www.bop.gov/policy/progstat/7331_004.pdf. \n32 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-01609-JGB-KK   Document 1   Filed 08/01/18   Page 35 of 39   Page ID #:35\n \n1 Victorville.  As a result of Defendants’ actions, Plaintiffs \n2 and other civil detainees have not received adequate \n3 medical or mental health care for conditions existing at the \n4 time they arrived at Victorville, or that have arisen since \n5 their imprisonment there. \n6 b.  Failing to staff Victorville with adequate numbers of \n7 qualified medical or mental health care providers and \n8 custody staff to service the civil detainee population. \n9 c.  Failing to provide a method by which Plaintiffs and other \n10 detainees can seek non-emergency medical or mental health \n0 \n0\n9 11 care when in their cells, or by which they can seek any sort \ne \nSuit58 \nP Drive, 35-29 12 of medical or mental health care when outside of their cells. \nBallard Spahr LL80 Festival Plaza egas, Nevada  891 111345 d.

As a result of Defendants’ practices and policies, Plaintiffs are \n20 exposed to a significant risk of serious harm to which Defendants are \n \n21 deliberately indifferent, in violation of Plaintiffs’ rights under the Due Process \n22 clause of the Fifth Amendment. \n23 126.  In addition, Defendants are systemically failing to provide \n24 adequate nutrition to Plaintiffs by serving meals that are inedible or of \n25 insufficient size or nutritional value, and by denying Plaintiffs adequate time to \n26 eat the food they are provided.  As a result of Defendants’ policies and \n27 practices, Plaintiffs do not receive adequate nutrition at Victorville, creating a \n28 substantial risk of serious harm to which Defendants are deliberately \n33 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-01609-JGB-KK   Document 1   Filed 08/01/18   Page 36 of 39   Page ID #:36\n \n1 indifferent, in violation of Plaintiffs’ rights secured by the Due Process clause \n2 of the Fifth Amendment. \n3 127.  Defendants severely limit Plaintiffs’ access to outdoor exercise to \n4 only a handful of hours each week and such limited and inadequate \n5 opportunities to exercise outside are not regularly scheduled. \n6 128.  Defendants severely limit Plaintiffs’ out-of-cell time by \n7 maintaining a policy under which Plaintiffs are on lockdown several times \n8 throughout the day in order to accommodate the movement of Victorville’s \n9 prisoner population. \n10 129.  Defendants have impeded Plaintiffs’ and other detainees’ ability \n0 \n0\n9 11 to practice their faith by refusing to provide religious services and meals that \ne \nSuit58 \nP Drive, 35-29 12 meet detainees’ religious needs, severely impeding detainees’ ability to wear \nBallard Spahr LL80 Festival Plaza egas, Nevada  891 111345 aanmdo pnog1s o3ste0hs.es r r Treelhisegt riciocoutnisod inittesim.o  n ss,  danesdc driebneydi nhge rdeeinta, iwneheisc ha cacrees isl ltuos rtrealitgivioe uasn tde xntost,  \n9V\nm, 1Las \nu 16 exhaustive, violate the Due Process clause because they, individually and \nS\ne \nn\nO\n17 collectively: (a) are identical to, similar to, or more restrictive than those in \n18 which persons convicted of criminal offenses at Victorville are confined; \n19 (b) are expressly intended to punish; (c) are not reasonably related to legitimate \n20 governmental objectives; and/or (d) are excessive in relation to those \n \n21 objectives. \n22 SECOND CLAIM \n23 (Violation of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment) \n24 131.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1-130 \n25 of this Complaint as if fully set out herein. \n26 132.  By Defendants’ conduct alleged above, they have violated, and \n27 continue to violate, Plaintiffs’ and the other detainees’ rights under the Free \n28 Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \n34 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-01609-JGB-KK   Document 1   Filed 08/01/18   Page 37 of 39   Page ID #:37\n \n1 133.  Defendants’ restriction of Plaintiffs’ and other detainees’ ability to \n2 exercise their religion, as described in detail above, is not narrowly tailored to \n3 further a compelling governmental interest.  Nor is there a rational basis or \n4 legitimate penological interest upon which Defendants may justify their \n5 conduct, especially in light of the Defendants’ own written policies pertaining \n6 to religious exercise and the distinctions between civil immigration detainees \n7 and convicted persons.   \n8 THIRD CLAIM \n(Violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, \n9\n42 U.S.C § 2000bb, et seq.) \n10\n0  134.

Because of Defendants’ conduct, Plaintiffs and \nu 16\nS\nne  the other detainees have been, and continue to be, severely impeded or \nO\n17\nprevented outright from attending religious services, engaging in congregate \n18\nworship and group prayer, consulting with clergy and religious leaders, \n19\nfollowing religious requirements for their diet, wearing religious headgear and \n20\n \nreligiously significant jewelry, possessing other religious items, and accessing \n21\nreligious texts for reading and religious study.  Unless this Court intervenes, \n22\nPlaintiffs and the other detainees will be forced to abandon, or significantly \n23\nlimit, their religious practices and violate their sincerely held religious beliefs \n24\nthroughout their entire imprisonment at Victorville. \n25\n136.  Under RFRA, Defendants may not impose these substantial \n26\nburdens on Plaintiffs and the other detainees unless they can demonstrate that \n27\n28\n35 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-01609-JGB-KK   Document 1   Filed 08/01/18   Page 38 of 39   Page ID #:38\n \n1 doing so is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental \n2 interest. \n3 137.  Defendants have no compelling interest in treating Plaintiffs and \n4 the other detainees in this manner. \n5 138.  Even if Defendants could identify a compelling interest to support \n6 their policies and practices pertaining to detainees’ religious exercise, they \n7 have not used the least restrictive means to further that interest.  The BOP’s \n8 Program Statement on Religious Beliefs and Practices, Victorville USP’s \n9 Inmate Handbook, and ICE’s Religious Practices and Policy all represent less \n10 restrictive means that could be used by Defendants.  To eliminate the \n0 \n0\n9 11 substantial burdens on Plaintiffs’ and the other detainees’ religious exercise, \ne \nSuit58 \nP Drive, 35-29 12 Defendants could also simply release Plaintiffs and the other detainees from \nBallard Spahr LL80 Festival Plaza egas, Nevada  891 111345 ipmrepvriiosounslmy ebnete ant  tVreiactteodrv. illeP,R inA tYheE sRa mFOe mRa RnnEeLr ItEhaFt  civil detainees have \n9V\nm, 1Las \nu 16 WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully ask this Court to exercise its \nS\ne \nn\nO\n17 federal question jurisdiction over this actual controversy and: \n18 (a)  certify the Civil Detainee Class and Religious Freedom Sub-Class \n19 as proposed above, appoint the Named Plaintiffs to serve as \n20 representatives of those two Classes and appoint undersigned \n \n21 counsel to represent the two Classes; \n22 (b)  enter an order preliminarily and permanently enjoining \n23 Defendants from imprisoning Plaintiffs, or any member of the \n24 Civil Detainee Class, at Victorville, and set a date certain by \n25 which all such detainees must be removed therefrom; \n26 (c)  enter an order preliminarily and permanently enjoining \n27 Defendants from depriving Plaintiffs: \n28 i.  of minimally adequate health care; \n36 \n \n\nCase 5:18-cv-01609-JGB-KK   Document 1   Filed 08/01/18   Page 39 of 39   Page ID #:39\n \n1 ii.  of adequate food, clean non-prison uniform clothing, \n2 freedom of movement, and other programming or \n3 activities that do not cause physical, emotional, and \n4 psychological harm and other affronts to basic human \n5 dignity; \n6 iii.  of their constitutional and statutory rights to exercise \n7 their freedom of religion; \n8 iv.  of their rights to due process of law as a result of \n9 their being imprisoned  at Victorville, in conditions \n10 that are excessive and constitute punishment; \n0 \n0\n9 11 (d)  award Plaintiffs their attorneys’ fees and costs; and  \ne \nSuit58 \nP Drive, 35-29 12 (e)  enter such other and further relief as the Court deems just and \nBallard Spahr LL80 Festival Plaza egas, Nevada  891 111345    proper. \n9V\nm, 1Las \nu 16  \nS\ne \nn\nO\n17               Respectfully submitted,  \n18 Dated: August 1, 2018 \n  /s/ Margot K.
