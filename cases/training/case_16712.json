    "state": "Washington",
    "summary": "<p>On July 31, 2018, two nonprofit organizations and fifteen individuals filed this class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, challenging the Trump Administration's implementation of the waiver provision of the Travel Ban (Presidential Proclamation No. 9645). The Travel Ban indefinitely banned millions of nationals of five Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. Pars Equality Center and OneAmerica are immigrant and refugee advocacy organizations, and the individual plaintiffs are U.S. citizens, foreign nationals lawfully present in the U.S., and individuals abroad who were affected by the Travel Ban and the implementation of its waiver provision. The plaintiffs sued the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, alleging that the waiver process under the Travel Ban was being implemented in an unduly restrictive manner, violating the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The plaintiffs&mdash;represented by private counsel, Asian Americans Advancing Justice, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the National Immigration Law Center, and the International Refugee Assistance Project&mdash;sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorneys' fees and costs. Specifically, the plaintiffs requested that the waiver provision be enjoined, that any agency guidance and policies implementing that provision be vacated and remanded to the agencies, and that the agencies be directed to issue new guidance in conformance with the APA, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the Constitution.</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, the plaintiffs sought to define the class as: \"Individuals in the United States with an approved petition to be reunited with family members who are (i) a national of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, or Yemen, (ii) subject to the Proclamation, and (iii) currently awaiting a decision on a waiver or have been denied a waiver; Nationals of the Designated Countries who are lawfully present in the United States who, but for the uncertainty created by the Proclamation and Defendants&rsquo; implementation of the waiver provision, wish to travel abroad and return to the United States; and Individuals who have applied for a visa who are (i) nationals of the Designated Countries, (ii) subject to the Proclamation, and (iii) currently awaiting a decision on a waiver or have been denied a waiver.\" The case was assigned to Judge Benjamin H. Settle.</p>\r\n<p>On August 1, 2018, the plaintiffs notified the court of a related class-action case, <a href=\"../../../../case/15635/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Doe v. Trump</em></a>, challenging the Travel Ban. The present case was reassigned to Judge James L. Robart, the same judge assigned to <em>Doe v. Trump</em>.</p>\r\n<p>On September 6, 2018, the defendants filed a motion to transfer this case because they disagreed with the plaintiffs about the relation of this case to <em>Doe v. Trump</em>. Instead, the defendants argued that this case should either be stayed or transferred to the Northern District of California, where another class-action case, <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17045\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Emami v. Nielsen</em></a> was pending .</p>\r\n<p>On December 12, 2018, the court granted the defendants' motion to transfer this case to the Northern District of California. 2018 WL 6523135. The case was transferred and given a new docket number, 3:18-cv-07818. Judge James Donato was assigned to the case.</p>\r\n<p>On February 20, 2019, the defendants filed a motion to either consolidate this case with the <em>Emami</em> case or stay this case pending the outcome of the proceedings in <em>Emami</em> to avoid duplicative litigation. The plaintiffs opposed the defendants' proposed complete merger of this case with <em>Emami</em>, arguing that such a merger would unnecessarily delay these proceedings further and deprive this case of its independent character.</p>\r\n<p>The court heard oral argument on April 11, 2019, and decided to allow both cases to proceed, with the understanding that the parties would have to communicate so as to prevent any duplicative actions. The parties then proceeded with discovery.</p>\r\n<p>On June 13, 2019, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' complaint for failure to state a claim; and, in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment. The court denied the motion to dismiss for the APA claim and granted the motion to dismiss for the Fifth Amendment claim on June 5, 2020. The court also denied summary judgment. For the Fifth Amendment claim, the court held that the plaintiffs failed to \"allege a deprivation of an interest protected by the Due Process Clause.\"</p>\r\n<p>Subsequently, discovery continued.</p>\r\n<p>After the Trump Administration concluded, President Biden revoked the Travel Ban and ordered that visa applications resume processing on January 20, 2021 (Presidential Proclamation No. 10141). The Secretary of State was also given 45 days to provide a report detailing the number of visa applicants being considered for a waiver when Trump signed the Travel Ban, a proposal for \"expeditiously adjudicating\" their pending visa applications, reconsideration of denied applications, and a way to ensure that cases of reapplicants are not prejudiced as a result of a previous visa denial.</p>\r\n<p>On February 11, 2021 the defendants filed a notice stating that similar cases had&mdash;following the Biden Administration's revocation of the executive order that established the waiver program&mdash;been dismissed for mootness. Specifically, the government notified the court of a mootness ruling by the Ninth Circuit and another by the Sixth Circuit. (One of the cases they cited in this notice, <em>Arab American Civil Rights League v. Trump</em>, can be found <a href=\"../../../../detail.php?id=15612\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> in the Clearinghouse.) In addition to notifying the court of these appellate decisions, the government asked the district court to dismiss the case.</p>\r\n<p>On March 23, 2021 the court stayed this case (along with the related case <em>Emami v. Nielson</em>) and terminated ongoing discovery disputes pending DHS&rsquo;s implementation of President Biden&rsquo;s January 20 order. The court directed the parties to file a joint status update by June 7, 2021, which the parties did. In the report, the parties explained why they had not reached a settlement. The plaintiffs claimed that, following the revocation of the travel ban orders, the Biden Administration invited them to reapply for visas. But reapplying would deny the plaintiffs the benefit of their earlier application dates. The defendants, meanwhile, claimed that, because the January 20 proclamation revoked the EOs that caused the plaintiffs&rsquo; harm, there was no live case or controversy for the district court to adjudicate.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs moved to lift the stay of proceedings on July 13, 2021, and the government filed its opposition on July 27, 2021. On September 2, the court held a status conference, and on October 4, the parties filed a joint submission outlining their respective stances regarding which plaintiffs still had live claims.</p>\r\n<p>On March 15, 2022, the court ordered that this case and <em>Emami</em> be reopened. The defendants' request to dismiss the cases for mootness was denied without prejudice because of the application date issue raised by the plaintiffs. The parties were also instructed to file a stipulation of dismissal for any plaintiffs whom the parties agreed were not involved in any live controversy.</p>\r\n<p>On April 27, 2022, the parties submitted a stipulation, by which they requested for OneAmerica and 28 other individual plaintiffs to be dismissed from the case as moot. On May 9, 2022, the court issued an order on stipulation on the basis of this request.</p>\r\n<p>As of April 23, 2025, the case is ongoing.</p>",

Settle following a Notice of \n4 Related Cases filed by Plaintiffs on August 1, 2018. Contrary to the conclusory allegations made \n5\nin that notice, this case is not related to Doe v. Trump, 2:17-cv-0178-JLR, within the meaning of \n6\nCivil Local Rule 3(g). Plaintiffs’ Complaint raises a challenge only to the waiver process for visa \n7\napplicants outlined in Presidential Proclamation No. 9645, 82 Fed. Reg. 45, 161 (Sept. 27, 2017) \n8\n(“Proclamation”). The operative complaint in Doe (Third Amended Complaint (Dkt. 42)), by \n9\ncontrast, does not allege any specific claims or seek any specific relief with respect to the waiver \n10\n11 process. Instead, the Doe plaintiffs’ focus is on Executive Order 13815, 82 Fed. Reg. 50055 \n12\n(Oct. 24, 2017); an October 23, 2017 agency memorandum (“Agency Memo”); and the temporary \n13\ndeprioritization and pause on admissions of certain groups of refugee applicants under the U.S. \n14\nRefugee Admissions Program (“USRAP”). Although the Doe plaintiffs did raise some challenges \n15\nto the Proclamation in general, those challenges are stale in light of the Supreme Court’s decision \n16\nin Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392 (June 26, 2018), and subsequently have not been revived.   \n17\n18 Thus, to truly conserve judicial resources, promote comity among courts of concurrent \n19 jurisdiction, and avoid the possibility of conflicting judgments, this case should either be stayed \n20\nor transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Emami, et \n21\nal. v. Nielsen, et al., No. 18-cv-01587-JD (N.D. Cal. filed Mar. 13, 2018), a putative class action \n22\ncase raising substantially similar issues and filed on behalf of a putative class that is defined in \n23\nalmost the same way as the putative class here, has been pending before the Northern District of \n24\nCalifornia for approximately six months. Like this case, Emami concerns the waiver process set \n25\n \n26\nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO TRANSFER VENUE TO    U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE \nTHE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR    CIVIL DIVISION, OIL \nTHE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA    P.O. BOX 878, BEN FRANKLIN STATION \n2    WASHINGTON, DC 20044 \nCase No. 2:18-CV-01122-JLR    TELEPHONE: (202) 532-4094 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-01122-JLR   Document 55   Filed 09/06/18   Page 3 of 13\n \n \nout in the Proclamation for visa applicants and does not involve refugee applicants or their U.S. \n1\nfamily members. The considerable overlap between the two cases, as well as the “dictates of sound \n2\n3 judicial administration” that underlie the “first-to-file” rule, supports their consolidation, and \n4 Defendants request that this class action be transferred to the Northern District of California \n5\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a). \n6\nBACKGROUND \n7\n  This case arises in the wake of Emami, a putative class action filed six months earlier in \n8\nthe Northern District of California by plaintiffs seeking substantially similar relief on behalf of a \n9\nsubstantially similar putative class. At the heart of both cases is a challenge to the waiver process \n10\n11 for visa applicants delineated in section 3(c) of the Proclamation.  The Proclamation suspends the \n12\nentry into the United States of nationals of select countries, subject to categorical exceptions, and \n13\nsection 3(c) authorizes consular officers to waive the entry prohibitions on a case-by-case basis. \n14\nIn their complaint, the Emami plaintiffs allege that the defendants failed “to institute clear \n15\nguidance” regarding the waiver provision, failed “to provide an accessible and meaningful process \n16\nby which individuals may seek consideration of their request for a waiver,” and failed “to provide \n17\n18 individualized,  case-by-case  consideration  for  waivers  under  the  Proclamation  to  all  visa \n19 applicants.” No. 18-cv-01587-JD (N.D. Cal.), Amended Complaint (Dkt. 34) ¶ 311. Similarly, \n20\nhere, Plaintiffs challenge the implementation of the waiver provision, claiming that Defendants’ \n21\nactions have “resulted in a waiver process in which . . . visa applicants have had no consistent or \n22\nmeaningful process by which to submit evidence of waiver eligibility or to have such evidence \n23\nconsidered by consular officers . . . .” Complaint (Dkt. 1) ¶ 282. Plaintiffs further claim that “the \n24\neligibility criteria for a waiver . . . had been misinterpreted and misapplied to require a higher \n25\n \n26\nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO TRANSFER VENUE TO    U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE \nTHE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR    CIVIL DIVISION, OIL \nTHE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA    P.O. BOX 878, BEN FRANKLIN STATION \n3    WASHINGTON, DC 20044 \nCase No. 2:18-CV-01122-JLR    TELEPHONE: (202) 532-4094 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-01122-JLR   Document 55   Filed 09/06/18   Page 4 of 13\n \n \nstandard of proof” than directed by section 3(c) of the Proclamation and that consular officers \n1\nlacked “discretion over whether they may grant a visa to an individual.” Id. ¶¶ 283-84. In both \n2\n3 cases, the plaintiffs direct their complaint squarely at section 3(c)’s waiver provision, alleging that \n4 the federal defendants are implementing the provision in such a way as to constrict the ability of \n5\nindividuals to demonstrate their eligibility for a waiver. \n6\nIn addition to sharing common claims, the putative classes proposed in each case are \n7\nlargely identical, with each complaint proposing a class of U.S.-based individuals and a class of \n8\noverseas-based visa applicants. The Emami plaintiffs brought their class action on behalf of two \n9\nsubclasses: (1) the “Family Member Class,” which comprises “United States citizens and lawful \n10\n11 permanent residents with approved family-based visa petitions or whose family members have \n12\napplied for visa categories covered by the ban, and whose family members have been or will be \n13\nrefused pursuant to the Proclamation without an opportunity to apply for and be meaningfully \n14\nconsidered for a waiver or are awaiting adjudication of a waiver,” and (2) the “Visa Applicant \n15\nClass,” which comprises “Iranian, Libyan, Somali, Syrian, and Yemeni nationals who have applied \n16\nfor immigrant or nonimmigrant visas that have been or will be refused pursuant to the Proclamation \n17\n18 without the opportunity to apply for and be meaningfully considered for a waiver or who are \n19 awaiting  adjudication  of  a  waiver.”  No. 18-cv-01587-JD  (N.D.  Cal.),  Amended  Complaint \n20\n(Dkt. 34) ¶¶ 10-12. The proposed class here in Pars Equality Center also includes the same two \n21\ngroups: (1) “Individuals in the United States with an approved petition to be reunited with family \n22\nmembers who are (i) a national of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, or Yemen (the ‘Designated \n23\nCountries’), (ii) subject to the Proclamation, and (iii) currently awaiting a decision on a waiver or \n24\nhave been denied a waiver (‘U.S. Petitioner Subclass’),” and (2) “Individuals who have applied \n25\n \n26\nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO TRANSFER VENUE TO    U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE \nTHE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR    CIVIL DIVISION, OIL \nTHE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA    P.O. BOX 878, BEN FRANKLIN STATION \n4    WASHINGTON, DC 20044 \nCase No. 2:18-CV-01122-JLR    TELEPHONE: (202) 532-4094 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-01122-JLR   Document 55   Filed 09/06/18   Page 5 of 13\n \n \nfor a visa who are (i) nationals of the Designated Countries, (ii) subject to the Proclamation, and \n1\n(iii) currently awaiting a decision on a waiver or have been denied a waiver (‘Visa Applicant \n2\n3 Subclass’).”1 Complaint (Dkt. 1) ¶ 269. \n4 ARGUMENT \n5\nI.  This  class  action  is  not  substantially  similar  to  Doe  and  should  not  have  been \ntransferred to this Court as a related case. \n6\n \n7   This case was transferred to this Court on August 20, 2018, based on Plaintiffs’ Notice of \n8\nRelated Cases, in which they alleged that their putative class action is related to Doe v. Trump, No. \n9\n2:17-cv-0178-JLR. Plaintiffs, however, provided little support for their claim. In particular, they \n10\nfailed to explain how the two cases concern substantially the same issues other than to generally \n11\nassert that both “are class action suits that challenge provisions and processes set forth by the \n12\nExecutive Orders that restrict immigration and travel from certain Muslim-majority countries \n13\n14 . . . .” Notice of Related Cases (Dkt. 39) at 2. That description is excessively broad and obscures \n15 the fact that the two actions involve different claims arising out of two different executive decrees \n16\nthat apply to different categories of individuals. \n17\n  As  noted  above,  Plaintiffs’  Complaint  is  limited  in  scope,  challenging  only  the \n18\nimplementation of the waiver provision of the Proclamation. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that the \n19\nwaiver provision has been implemented in a way that precludes individual visa applicants subject \n20\nto the Proclamation from qualifying for and ultimately obtaining a waiver. Thus, in their prayer \n21\n22\n                                                 \n1   Plaintiffs here also include as members of their proposed class nationals of the identified \n23\ncountries who are lawfully present in the United States and wish to travel abroad and return “but \n24 for the uncertainty created by” Defendants’ implementation of the waiver provision. Complaint \n(Dkt. 1) ¶ 269. \n25\n \n26\nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO TRANSFER VENUE TO    U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE \nTHE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR    CIVIL DIVISION, OIL \nTHE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA    P.O. BOX 878, BEN FRANKLIN STATION \n5    WASHINGTON, DC 20044 \nCase No. 2:18-CV-01122-JLR    TELEPHONE: (202) 532-4094 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-01122-JLR   Document 55   Filed 09/06/18   Page 6 of 13\n \n \nfor relief, Plaintiffs make no reference to any other provision of the Proclamation—nor, for that \n1\nmatter, any other executive action, including Executive Order 13815, 82 Fed. Reg. 50055 (Oct. 24, \n2\n3 2017), or the Agency Memo—instead requesting only that the Court enjoin Defendants from \n4 implementing the waiver provision in a manner contrary to law. Complaint (Dkt. 1) at 64-66. \n5\n  The gravamen of Doe, by contrast, is not the waiver provision of the Proclamation, but \n6\ninstead provisions of the Agency Memo that temporarily impacted the USRAP—specifically, the \n7\n90-day deprioritization of certain refugee applicants requiring a security advisory opinion, and the \n8\npause  on  admissions  of  derivative  or  “following-to-join”  refugee  applicants  while  security \n9\nmeasures for principal and derivative refugees were brought into alignment.. No. 17-cv-0178, \n10\n11 Third Amended Complaint (Dkt. 42). The two challenges are clearly distinct from each other: the \n12\nwaiver process outlined in the Proclamation applies to individuals from the few countries of \n13\nidentified concern who are seeking to obtain immigrant or nonimmigrant visas to travel to the \n14\nUnited States; the USRAP, on the other hand, is an interagency effort to identify, and designated \n15\nas  processing  priorities  for  admission,  refugees  from  around  the  world  who  are  of  special \n16\nhumanitarian concern to the United States. Thus, as Executive Order No. 13815 makes clear, \n17\n18 “[f]oreign nationals who seek to enter the United States with an immigrant or nonimmigrant visa \n19 stand in a different position from that of refugees who are considered for entry into this country \n20\nunder the USRAP.” Executive Order No. 13815 § 1(h). Most significantly, the entry restrictions \n21\nand limitations in the Proclamation that “apply to the immigrant and nonimmigrant visa application \n22\nand adjudication processes . . . do not apply to those who seek to enter the United States through \n23\nthe USRAP.” Id. § 1(g). Indeed, the plaintiffs in Doe highlighted the disparate concerns of the \n24\nProclamation and the executive actions that they challenged where they admitted in their complaint \n25\n \n26\nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO TRANSFER VENUE TO    U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE \nTHE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR    CIVIL DIVISION, OIL \nTHE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA    P.O. BOX 878, BEN FRANKLIN STATION \n6    WASHINGTON, DC 20044 \nCase No. 2:18-CV-01122-JLR    TELEPHONE: (202) 532-4094 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-01122-JLR   Document 55   Filed 09/06/18   Page 7 of 13\n \n \nthat the Proclamation “did not address the issue of refugee admissions.” No. 17-cv-0178, Third \n1\nAmended Complaint (Dkt. 42) at 2-3. And while the Doe plaintiffs, in addition to challenging \n2\n3 aspects  of  the  Agency  Memo,  raised  hypothetical  objections  to  the  implementation  of  the \n4 Proclamation in their Third Amended Complaint, such objections were resolved in Hawaii, where \n5\nthe  Supreme  Court  held  that  the  President, “following  a  worldwide,  multi-agency  review,” \n6\npermissibly exercised his “broad discretion” under the Immigration and Nationality Act in issuing \n7\nthe Proclamation. 138 S. Ct. at 2408. Moreover, notwithstanding their general references to the \n8\nProclamation in their Third Amended Complaint, the Doe plaintiffs have not pursued any claims \n9\nregarding the Proclamation or its waiver provision at any point since the preliminary injunction \n10\n11 took effect on December 23, 2017. See No. 17-cv-0178, Stipulation and Order Staying Case \n12\n(Dkt. 34); see also id., Stipulation and Order Lifting Stay and Permitting Plaintiffs to File a Third \n13\nAmended Complaint (Dkt. 41) (providing that the plaintiffs would “not seek to enjoin the \n14\nProclamation at this time due to the already pending challenges in Hawaii”). \n15\nIn  sum,  because  Pars  Equality  Center  and  Doe  involve  different  issues  and  claims \n16\nstemming from separate executive actions, they are not related within the meaning of Civil Local \n17\n18 Rule 3(g). \n19 II.  Pars Equality Center should be transferred to the Northern District of California \ngiven the overlapping class claims. \n20\n \n  While Pars Equality Center is not related to the Doe case that is also pending before this \n21\n22 Court, it presents claims on behalf of a putative class that is substantially identical to the putative \n23 class in Emami, which has been pending before the United States District Court for the Northern \n24\nDistrict of California since March 13, 2018. Given the substantial overlap between the putative \n25\n \n26\nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO TRANSFER VENUE TO    U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE \nTHE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR    CIVIL DIVISION, OIL \nTHE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA    P.O. BOX 878, BEN FRANKLIN STATION \n7    WASHINGTON, DC 20044 \nCase No. 2:18-CV-01122-JLR    TELEPHONE: (202) 532-4094 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-01122-JLR   Document 55   Filed 09/06/18   Page 8 of 13\n \n \nclasses in Pars Equality Center and Emami, and in order to advance the interests of “conservation \n1\nof judicial resources and comprehensive disposition of litigation,” Kerotest Mfg. Co. v. C-O-Two \n2\n3 Fire Equip. Co., 342 U.S. 180, 183-84 (1952), coordinated briefing and adjudication is appropriate \n4 and this Court should transfer Pars Equality Center to the Northern District of California pursuant \n5\nto the “first-to-file” rule. \n6\nThe “first-to-file” rule is a “doctrine of federal comity [that] permits a district court to \n7\ndecline jurisdiction over an action when a complaint involving the same parties and issues has \n8\nalready been filed in another district.” Apple Inc. v. Psystar Corp., 658 F.3d 1150, 1161 (9th Cir. \n9\n2011) (quotation marks and citation omitted); see also Smith v. McIver, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 532, \n10\n11 535 (1824) (Marshall, C.J.). The “rule is not a rigid or inflexible rule to be mechanically applied, \n12\nbut rather is to be applied with a view to the dictates of sound judicial administration.” Pacesetter \n13\nSys., Inc. v. Medtronic, Inc., 678 F.2d 93, 95 (9th Cir. 1982). Thus, strict identity of the parties and \n14\nidentical issues in the cases are not required. Instead, the two cases must be “substantially similar.” \n15\nSee Music Grp. Servs. US, Inc. v. InMusic Brands, Inc., No. 13-cv-182, 2013 WL 1499564, at *2 \n16\n(W.D. Wash. Apr. 11, 2013) (Pechman, J.). Moreover, “the form of relief sought does not \n17\n18 determine the ‘similitude’ of the issues.” Am. Guar. & Liab. Ins. Co. v. U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co., \n19 No. 06-cv-1254, 2006 WL 3499342, at *2 (W.D. Wash. 2006). At bottom, the first-to-file rule \n20\napplies if two matters exhibit chronology, similar parties, and similarity of issues. See Alltrade, \n21\nInc. v. Uniweld Prods., Inc., 946 F.2d 622, 625–27 (9th Cir. 1991). All three are present here. \n22\nFirst, the chronology of the actions supports transfer because Emami was filed nearly six \n23\nmonths ago. See Intersearch Worldwide v. Intersearch Grp., 544 F. Supp. 2d 949, 958 (N.D. Cal. \n24\n2008) (noting that “the focus is on the original complaint, not any amended complaints”); see also \n25\n \n26\nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO TRANSFER VENUE TO    U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE \nTHE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR    CIVIL DIVISION, OIL \nTHE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA    P.O.

Duff, et al., No. C15-5944-BHS, 2016 WL 3280429, at *2 (W.D. Wash. June 15, 2016) \n1\n(explaining that “the policy rationales behind the first-to-file rule—economy, consistency, and \n2\n3 comity—are ‘just as valid when applied to the situation where one suit precedes the other by a day \n4 as they are in a case where a year intervenes between the suits’” (quoting Genentech, Inc. v. Eli \n5\nLilly & Co., 998 F.2d 931, 939 (Fed. Cir. 1993))). Second, there is substantial similarity between \n6\nthe parties: in both actions, the plaintiffs include what would be overlapping classes of United \n7\nStates citizens and lawful permanent residents who have family members seeking to enter the \n8\nUnited States on either immigrant or nonimmigrant visas, diversity visa lottery selectees with \n9\nfamily  members  in  the  United  States,  and  foreign  nationals  with  approved  EB-5  petitions. \n10\n11 Complaint (Dkt. 1) at 30-55; Emami, No. 18-cv-01587-JD (N.D. Cal.), Amended Complaint \n12\n(Dkt. 34) at 27-53; cf. InMusic Brands, 2013 WL 1499564, at *2 (“The requirement of similar \n13\nparties is satisfied if the parties are substantially similar . . . [as opposed to] identical.”). In fact, \n14\ntwo of the named plaintiffs in Emami, Hoda Mehrabi Mohammadabadi and Maral Tabrizi, were \n15\nalso  named  plaintiffs  in  the  later-filed  Pars  Equality  Center  class  action.2  Emami, \n16\nNo. 18-cv-01587-JD (N.D. Cal.), Complaint (Dkt. 1); id., Amended Complaint (Dkt. 34). Since \n17\n18 then, Plaintiffs have filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal as to those two individuals—who \n19 remain parties to the Emami class action—but the named plaintiffs in Pars Equality Center have \n20\notherwise remained the same, retaining a considerable overlap in identity with the group of named \n21\n22\n                                                 \n2   Due to the withholding—even from Defendants—of several Plaintiffs’ names, Defendants \n23\nare unable to ascertain whether there is any additional overlap of plaintiffs in the two suits \n24 Defendants dispute that anonymity is warranted as to Defendants and will request access to that \ninformation in a future filing. \n25\n \n26\nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO TRANSFER VENUE TO    U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE \nTHE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR    CIVIL DIVISION, OIL \nTHE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA    P.O.

Emami, No. 18-cv-01587-JD (N.D. Cal.), Amended Complaint (Dkt. 34). In \n1\naddition to the substantial similarity between the plaintiffs in Emami and Pars Equality Center, \n2\n3 the putative classes in both actions are by and large identical, each comprising (1) foreign nationals \n4 subject to the Proclamation who have applied for a visa and allege that they have been or will be \n5\ndenied a waiver, and (2) United States citizens and lawful permanent residents with approved \n6\nfamily-based  visa  petitions  for  those  foreign  nationals.3  Complaint  (Dkt.  1)  ¶ 269;  Emami, \n7\nNo. 18-cv-01587-JD (N.D. Cal.), Amended Complaint (Dkt. 34) ¶¶ 10-12; see also Adoma v. Univ. \n8\nof Phoenix, Inc., 711 F. Supp. 2d 1142, 1147 (E.D. Cal. 2010) (“In a collective action, the classes, \n9\nand not the class representatives, are compared.” (citation omitted)). \n10\n11 Lastly, as explained above, the Complaint here in Pars Equality Center focuses on the \n12\nsame central issue as in Emami: the alleged implementation of the Proclamation in a manner that \n13\ndeprives individual visa applicants of clear guidance about the waiver process and precludes them \n14\nfrom  receiving  individualized  determinations  of  their  waiver  requests.  Compare  Complaint \n15\n(Dkt. 1) ¶ 282 with Emami, No. 18-cv-01587-JD (N.D. Cal.), Amended Complaint (Dkt. 34) ¶ 311. \n16\nThe plaintiffs in both putative class actions do not raise a challenge to any other aspect of the \n17\n18 Proclamation or to any other executive decree. And given the substantial similarity between the \n19\n                                                 \n20 3   The first proposed subclass in Emami (“Family Member Class”) is in fact broader than the \nfirst proposed subclass in Pars Equality Center (“U.S. Petitioner Subclass”) where it includes \n21\nUnited States citizens and lawful permanent residents who have not filed family-based petitions \non behalf of foreign national family members subject to the Proclamation but who nonetheless \n22\nclaim an interest in the entry of such family members under other visa categories (such as \nnonimmigrant  visitors  for  pleasure).  No.  18-cv-01587-JD  (N.D.  Cal.),  Amended  Complaint \n23\n(Dkt. 34). Thus, while the two are not exactly coterminous, all members of the “U.S. Petitioner \n24 Subclass” in Pars Equality Center fall within the “Family Member Class” in Emami, and their \ninterests would be no less represented in the event of transfer to the Northern District of California. \n25\n \n26\nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO TRANSFER VENUE TO    U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE \nTHE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR    CIVIL DIVISION, OIL \nTHE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA    P.O. BOX 878, BEN FRANKLIN STATION \n10    WASHINGTON, DC 20044 \nCase No. 2:18-CV-01122-JLR    TELEPHONE: (202) 532-4094 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-01122-JLR   Document 55   Filed 09/06/18   Page 11 of 13\n \n \ntwo  cases  and  the  overlapping  putative  classes,  any  decision  by  this  Court  risks  creating \n1\ninconsistent  judgments,  causing  confusion  and  potentially  inconsistent  treatment  among  the \n2\n3 Emami class members, and defeating the purpose of uniform prosecution and resolution of related \n4 actions. See Ferens v. John Deere Co., 494 U.S. 516, 531 (1990) (“To permit a situation in which \n5\ntwo cases involving precisely the same issues are simultaneously pending in different District \n6\nCourts leads to the wastefulness of time, energy and money that [28 U.S.C.] § 1404(a) was \n7\ndesigned to prevent.”); see also Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, \n8\n424 U.S. 800, 817 (1976) (“As between federal district courts . . . the general principle is to avoid \n9\nduplicative litigation.”); United States v. Morros, 268 F.3d 695, 706 (9th Cir. 2001) (noting that \n10\n11 the “chief concern [is] with avoiding piecemeal litigation”). Under these circumstances, it would \n12\nmake more sense to transfer this case rather than to set two courts on a path whereby both are \n13\nconsidering whether to certify overlapping classes to be represented by different sets of attorneys. \n14\n// \n15\n// \n16\n \n17\n18  \n19  \n20\n \n21\n \n22\n \n23\n \n24\n \n25\n \n26\nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO TRANSFER VENUE TO    U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE \nTHE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR    CIVIL DIVISION, OIL \nTHE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA    P.O.

Transfer of the action—which, contrary to Plaintiffs’ \n6\nassertion, does not materially overlap with Doe—would serve the purpose of the first-to-file rule \n7\nin promoting the efficient and economical administration of justice and avoiding the possibility of \n8\nconflicting class-wide judgments. The court in the Northern District of California is a court of \n9\nconcurrent jurisdiction and fully competent to address the issues at stake in this class action. \n10\n11 Finally, even if the Court concludes that transfer is not warranted, the Court should hold this case \n12\nin abeyance pending the disposition of Emami by the Northern District of California. \n13\nDATED: September 6, 2018   \n14\n \n15 JOSEPH H.

INTRODUCTION \n16  Before the court is Defendants Mike Pompeo, Kirstjen M. Nielsen, Kevin K. \n17  McAleenan, United States Department of Homeland Security, United Sates Department \n18  of State, and United States Customs and Border Protection's (collectively, \"Defendants\") \n19  motion to transfer venue.  (Mot. (Dkt. #55).)  Plaintiffs Pars Equality Center (\"Pars \n20  Equality\"), OneAmerica, Pamela Whitehall Raghebi, Afshin Raghebi, Zeinab Mohamed \n21  Hassan, Siraji Etha Siraji, Malayeen Ahmed, Reza Azimi, Yahya Ghaleb, Mitra Hannani, \n22  Nicholas Hanout, Hossein Zamani Hosseinabadi, John Does 1-3, and Jane Doe 1 \nORDER-1 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-01122-JLR   Document 80   Filed 12/12/18   Page 2 of 19\n1  (collectively \"Plaintiffs\") oppose the motion.  (Resp. (Dkt. # 56).)  Defendants filed a \n2  reply.  (Reply (Dkt. # 63).)  The court has considered the motion, the parties' submissions \n3  concerning the motion, the relevant portions of the record, and the applicable law.  Being \n4  fully advised, 1 the court GRANTS Defendants' motion to transfer venue for the reasons \n5  set forth below. \n6  II.  BACKGROUND \n7  This lawsuit challenges Defendants' implementation of the waiver provision set \n8  forth in Presidential Proclamation No. 9645, entitled \"Enhancing Vetting Capabilities and \n9  Processes for Detecting Attempted Entry into the United States by Terrorists or Other \n10  Public-Safety Threats\" (\"E0-3\").2  See Proclamation No. 9,645, 82 Fed. Reg. 45,161 \n11  (Sept. 27, 2017); (Compl. (Dkt. # 1).)  President Trump promulgated E0-3 in September \n12  2017, following months of legal challenges to Executive Order No. 13,769, 82 Fed. Reg. \n13  8,977 (Jan. 27, 2017) (\"E0-1\") and Executive Order No. 13,780, 82 Fed. Reg. 13,209 \n14  (Mar. 6, 2017) (\"E0-2\").  Among other measures, E0-1 and E0-2 imposed entry and \n15  immigration restrictions on noncitizens from several majority-Muslim countries.  See \n16  // \n17 \n18  1 No party requests oral argument on Defendants' motion (see Mot. at 1; Resp. at 1), and \nthe court has determined that oral argument would not be of assistance in deciding the motion. \n19  See Local Rules W.D. Wash. LCR 7(b)(4). \n20  2 The parties refer to Presidential Proclamation No. 9645 as \"the Proclamation\" (Mot. at \n1; Resp. at 2), as did the Supreme Court in Trump v. Hawaii,-- U.S.--, 138 S. Ct. 2392 (2018). \nHo-wever, the court refers to the Proclamation as \"E0-3,\" so as to be consistent with the \n21 \nterminology employed in the court's prior orders concerning the President's executive actions on \nimmigration and refugee admissions.  See, e.g., Doe v. Trump, 288 F. Supp. 3d 1045 (W.D. \n22 \nWash. 2018). \nORDER-2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-01122-JLR   Document 80   Filed 12/12/18   Page 3 of 19\n1  Doe v. Trump, 288 F. Supp. 3d 1045, 1055-57 (W.D. Wash. 2018) (summarizing E0-1 \n2  and E0-2). \n3  E0-3 indefinitely bars from entering the United States all immigrants and various \n4  categories ofnonimmigrants from Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia,3 Syria, and Yemen. \n5  See E0-3 § 2.  Section 3(c) ofE0-3 (\"the waiver provision\") provides that nationals of \n6  these countries may be permitted entry on a \"case-by-case\" basis if they apply for and are \n7  granted a waiver.  !d. § 3(c).  Under the waiver provision, a consular officer or designee \n8  of the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, may, in his or her discretion, \n9  grant a waiver to a foreign national subject to E0-3 if the officer finds that the foreign \n10  national satisfies three criteria:  (1) \"denying entry would cause the foreign national \n11  undue hardship\"; (2) \"entry would not pose a threat to the national security or public \n12  safety of the United States\"; and (3) \"entry would be in the national interest.\"  Id. \n13  § 3(c)(i).  In addition, E0-3 directs the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland \n14  Security to \"coordinate to adopt guidance addressing the circumstances in which waivers \n15  may be appropriate for foreign nationals seeking entry as immigrants or nonimmigrants.\" \n16  Id.  § 3(c). \n17  Shortly after he promulgated E0-3, President Trump issued Executive Order No. \n18  13,815, entitled \"Resuming the United States Refugee Admissions Program with \n19  Enhanced Vetting Capabilities\" (\"E0-4\").  See Executive Order No. 13, 815, 82 Fed. \n20 \n21 \n3 E0-3 subjects to \"additional scrutiny\" nationals of Somalia who seek to enter the \nUnited States as nonimmigrants, but does not categorically suspend the entry of any class of \n22 \nnonimmigrants of Somali origin.  See E0-3 § 2(h)(ii). \nORDER- 3 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-01122-JLR   Document 80   Filed 12/12/18   Page 4 of 19\n1  Reg. 50,055 (Oct. 24, 2017).  Notwithstanding E0-4's title, the memorandum that \n2  accompanied E0-4-known as the \"Agency Memo\"-imposed another ban on certain \n3  categories of refugees.  See Doe, 288 F. Supp. 3d at 1057-59 (describing the Agency \n4  Memo).  Additionally, the Agency Memo indefinitely suspended the entry of \n5  following-to-join (\"FTJ\") derivative refugees to the United States.  See id. \n6  The President's executive actions on immigration and refugee admissions have \n7  prompted a number of legal actions, including Doe, et al. v. Trump, et al., C 17-0 178JLR \n8  (W.D. Wash.) (\"Doe\"), originally filed in February 2017 as a challenge to E0-1.  See \n9  Doe, Dkt. # 1.  Doe plaintiffs, who include refugees as well as individuals with lawful \n10  nonimmigrant status, amended their complaint after the subsequent executive actions. \n11  Id., Dkt. ## 10, 30, 42.  Their third amended complaint, filed on November 6, 2017, \n12  challenges both E0-3 and the Agency Memo that accompanied E0-4. !d., Dkt. # 42.  On \n13  December 23, 2017, this court enjoined federal officials from enforcing those provisions \n14  of the Agency Memo that suspended the processing and admission of FTJ applicants and \n15  refugees from select countries.4  See Doe, 288 F. Supp. 3d at 1086.  Neither that order nor \n16  any subsequent order in Doe addressed EO-3 's waiver provision. \n17  On July 31, 20 18, Plaintiffs filed the present action in the Western District of \n18  Washington.  (See Compl.)  The case was reassigned, as related to Doe, to the \n19  undersigned Judge.  (See Not. of Related Case (Dkt. # 39).)  Plaintiffs allege that \n20 \n21 \n4 Shortly before the court issued the preliminary injunction, Doe was consolidated with \nJewish Family Serv. ofS eattle, eta!. v. Trump, eta!., No. Cl7-1707JLR (W.D. Wash), which \n22 \nchallenged E0-4 and the Agency Memo.  See Doe, Dkt. ##52, 60, 61. \nORDER-4 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-01122-JLR   Document 80   Filed 12/12/18   Page 5 of 19\n1  Defendants' implementation ofE0-3's waiver provision violates the Administrative \n2  Procedure Act (\"AP A\"), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B), and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \n3  Amendment.  (Compl. ~~ 278-306.)  In brief, Plaintiffs argue that the waiver provision \n4  \"has been implemented in such a haphazard, opaque, and capricious manner, and so few \n5  visa applicants have actually been granted waivers under [E0-3], that the process by \n6  which waivers are supposedly granted has become part and parcel of the ban [effected by \n7  E0-3] itself.\"  (!d. ~ 2.) \n8  Individual Plaintiffs challenge Defendants' implementation of the waiver \n9  provision as representatives of three putative subclasses.  (Id. ~ 269.)  The \"U.S. \n10  Petitioner Subclass\" includes \"[i]ndividuals in the United States with an approved \n11  petition to be reunited with [a] family member[]\" who is (i) a national of Iran, Libya, \n12  Somalia, Syria, or Yemen, (ii) subject to E0-3, and (iii) currently awaiting a decision on \n13  a waiver or has been denied a waiver.  (Id. ~ 269(a).)  The \"Lawfully Present Foreign \n14  National Subclass\" includes nationals of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, or Yemen \"who are \n15  lawfully present in the United States [and] who, but for the uncertainty created by [E0-3] \n16  and Defendants' implementation of the waiver provision, wish to travel abroad and return \n17  to the United States.\"  (!d. ~ 269(b ).)  Finally, the \"Visa Applicant Subclass\" includes \n18  \"[i]ndividuals who have applied for a visa\" who are (i) nationals of Iran, Libya, Somalia, \n19  Syria, or Yemen, (ii) subject to E0-3, and (iii) currently awaiting a decision on a waiver \n20  or have been denied a waiver.  (!d. ~ 269( c).) \n21  This action is not the only pending challenge to E0-3 's waiver provision.  On \n22  March 13, 2018, plaintiffs comprising U.S. citizens and lawfully present foreign nationals \nORDER- 5 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-01122-JLR   Document 80   Filed 12/12/18   Page 6 of 19\n1  filed a putative class action in the Northern District of California, challenging the \n2  government's implementation of the waiver provision.  See Emami, et al. v. Nielson, et \n3  al., 3:18-cv-01587-JD (N.D. Cal.) (\"Emami\"), Dkt. # 1.  Like Plaintiffs here, Emami \n4  plaintiffs allege that the government's implementation of the waiver provision violates \n5  the APA and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Id., Dkt. # 34 ~~ 315-334. \n6  Emami plaintiffs include two subclasses.  The \"Family Member Class\" comprises \n7  \"United States citizens and lawful permanent residents with approved family-based visa \n8  petitions or whose family members have applied for visa categories covered by [E0-3], \n9  and whose family members have been or will be refused pursuant to [E0-3] without an \n10  opportunity to apply for and be meaningfully considered for a waiver or are awaiting \n11  adjudication of a waiver.\"  I d. ~ 11.  The \"Visa Applicant Class\" comprises \"Iranian, \n12  Libyan, Somali, Syrian, and Yemeni nationals who have applied for immigrant or \n13  nonimmigrant visas [who] have been or will be refused pursuant to [E0-3] without the \n14  opportunity to apply for and be meaningfully considered for a waiver or who are awaiting \n15  adjudication of a waiver.\"  Id. ~ 12. \n16  On September 24, 2018, Defendants filed the instant motion to transfer venue. \n17  (See Mot.)  Defendants argue that this action should be transferred to the Northern \n18  District of California and consolidated with Emami under the first-to-file rule, because \n19  the two cases present nearly identical claims on behalf of substantially similar putative \n20  classes.  (Mot. at 5-13.)  Plaintiffs, in contrast, contend that this case is closely related to \n21  Doe, such that Doe should be considered the first-filed action.  (Resp. at 5-6.)  Plaintiffs \n22  further argue that the convenience considerations embraced by the federal transfer statute, \nORDER- 6 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-01122-JLR   Document 80   Filed 12/12/18   Page 7 of 19\n1  28 U.S.C. §1404(a), weigh against transfer.  (Id. at 6-12.)  The court now turns to \n2  Defendants' motion. \n3  III.  ANALYSIS \n4  A.  Legal Standard \n5  The first-to-file rule is a \"generally recognized doctrine of federal comity\" that \n6  allows a district court to transfer, stay, or dismiss an action if a case with substantially \n7  similar issues and parties was previously filed in another district court.  Pacesetter Sys., \n8  Inc. v. Medtronic, Inc., 678 F.2d 93, 94 (9th Cir. 1982); Kahn Law Grp., Inc. v. Auto \n9  Parts Mfg. Miss., Inc., 787 F.3d 1237, 1239-40 (9th Cir. 2015).  \"The rule is primarily \n10   meant to alleviate the burden placed on the federal judiciary by duplicative litigation and \n11  to prevent the possibility of conflicting judgments.\"  Wallerstein v. Dole Fresh \n12  Vegetables, Inc., 967 F. Supp. 2d 1289, 1292 (N.D. Cal. 2013).  Accordingly, the \n13  frrst-to-file rule \"should not be disregarded lightly.\" Alltrade, Inc. v.  Uniweld Prods., \n14  Inc., 946 F .2d 622, 625 (9th Cir. 1991) (quoting Church ofS cientology v.  United States \n15  Dep 't of the Army, 611 F.2d 738, 750 (9th Cir. 1979)). \n16  When deciding whether to transfer, stay, or dismiss a case under the frrst-to-file \n17  rule, a district court analyzes three factors:  (1) the chronology of the actions; (2) the \n18  similarity of the parties; and (3) the similarity of the issues.  Kahn, 787 F.3d at 1240; see \n19  also Bewley v. CVS Health Corp., No. C17-0803RSL, 2017 WL 5158443, at *2 (W.D. \n20  Wash. Nov. 7, 2017).  Notwithstanding these specific factors, the first-to-file rule \"is not \n21  a rigid or inflexible rule to be mechanically applied, but rather is to be applied with a \n22  view to the dictates of sound judicial administration.\"  Decker Coal Co. v. \nORDER-7 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-01122-JLR   Document 80   Filed 12/12/18   Page 8 of 19\n1  Commonwealth Edison Co., 805 F.2d 834, 844 (9th Cir. 1986); see also Kohn, 787 F.3d \n2  at 1240 (quoting Cradle Co. v.  Whataburger ofA  lice, Inc., 174 F.3d 599, 604 (5th Cir. \n3  1999)) (\"When applying the first-to-file rule, courts should be driven to maximize \n4  'economy, consistency, and comity.'\").  As a result, \"[t]he most basic aspect of the \n5  first-to-file rule is that it is discretionary.\"  Alltrade, 946 F.2d at 628.5 \n6  B.  First-to-File Factors \n7  Defendants' motion argues in favor of an uncomplicated application of the \nfirst-to-file factors.  According to Defendants, transfer is warranted under the first-to-file \n8 \n9  rule because this case is not related to Doe, was filed some four months after Emami, and \n10  shares substantially the same issues and parties as Emami.  (Mot. at 5-9.)  Plaintiffs, in \n11  contrast, argue that transfer is not warranted under the first-to-file rule because Doe \"is \n12  the longest-pending case challenging the Trump administration's implementation of \n13  [E0-3's] waiver provision and ... is related to this case.\"  (Resp. at 1.)  Plaintiffs further \nargue that the convenience factors embraced by the federal transfer statute, 28 D.S.C. \n14 \n15  § 1404(a), weigh against transfer.  (Id. at 6-12.) \n16  At the outset, the court addresses Defendants' contention that Doe \"do [ es] not \n17  reveal any clear challenge to ... [E0-3's] waiver provision or the manner in which the \n18  Government has put that provision into effect\" and thus should not bear on the court's \nfirst-to-file analysis.  (Rep. at 3.)  On the face of their complaint, Doe plaintiffs' \n19 \n20 \n5 A court may decline to apply the first-to-file rule \"for reasons of equity,\" such as \"when \nthe filing of the first suit evidences bad faith, anticipatory suit, or forum shopping.\" \n21 \nInherent. com v. Martindale-Hubbell, 420 F. Supp. 2d 1093, 1097 (N.D. Cal. 2006); see also \nAlltrade, 946 F.2d at 628.  Plaintiffs do not allege that any such circumstances are present here. \n22 \n(See generally Resp.) \nORDER- 8 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-01122-JLR   Document 80   Filed 12/12/18   Page 9 of 19\n1  challenges to the waiver provision are perhaps less developed than their challenges to the \n2  Agency Memo's suspension of the entry ofFTJ derivative refugees and refugees of \n3  certain nationalities.  Nonetheless, the fourth and fifth counts of the complaint are fairly \n4  read to challenge the waiver provision as unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment's \n5  Due Process Clause.  See Doe, Dkt. # 42 at~~ 325-332; (see also Lin Decl. (Dkt. # 62) \n6  ~~ 3-5.)  Moreover, among the proposed subclasses outlined in the Doe complaint is a \n7  \"Non-immigrant Visa Class,\" comprising nationals of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and \n8  Yemen who are residents of Washington State, hold non-immigrant visas, lack unexpired \n9  multiple-entry visas, and cannot leave the United States for fear of being denied reentry \n10  under B0-3.  Id. ~~ 300, 332.  The court thus finds some degree of overlap between this \n11  action and Doe and rejects Defendants' argument that Doe should not feature in the \n12  court's analysis of the first-to-file factors.6  (Se~JYiot. at 5-7.) \n13  The presence of Doe on this court's docket is not dispositive for purposes of the \n14  first-to-file rule, however.  Where more than two pending actions implicate similar \n15  claims, a court deciding a motion to transfer may assess which of the actions are \"more \n16  closely related\" under the first-to-file analysis.  Hengle v.  Curry, No. 3:18-cv-100, 2018 \n17  WL 3016289, at *14 (B.D. Va. Jun. 15, 2018) (comparing the first-filed action with two \n18  subsequently filed cases involving similar subject matter); see also Wenzel v. Knight, No. \n19  3:14cv432, 2015 WL 222179, at *5-6 (B.D. Va. Jan. 14, 2015).  Here, transfer under the \n20 \n21 \n6 That Doe plaintiffs' challenges to the waiver provision are currently stayed (see Lin \nDecl. ,-r 4) has no bearing on the court's assessment of Defendants' motion.  Doe plaintiffs may, \n22 \nin the future, seek to lift the stay in that case.  (See id. ,-r 5.) \nORDER- 9 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-01122-JLR   Document 80   Filed 12/12/18   Page 10 of 19\n1  first-to-file rule would be appropriate should the court find that this action is more closely \n2  related to Emami than it is to Doe.  See Hengle, 2018 WL 3016289, at *14.  Accordingly, \n3  the court proceeds to compare the chronology, parties, and issues of this action, Emami, \n4  and Doe. \n5  1.  Chronology \n6  The chronology-of-actions factor is straightforward.  Doe plaintiffs filed suit in \n2017 and amended their complaint to challenge both E0-3 and the Agency Memo on \n7 \n8  November 6, 2017.  Doe, Dkt. # 42.  Emami was filed on March 13,2018.  Emami, Dkt. \n9  # 1.  Plaintiffs here filed suit on July 31,2018.  (Compl.)  Of the three challenges to \n10  E0-3, Doe is the first-filed action.  Viewed broadly, the chronology factor weighs against \n11  transfer.  Should the court find that the parties and issues of this action are more closely \n12  related to Emami than to Doe, however, as between Emami and this action, Emami would \n13  constitute the first-filed action for purposes of the first-to-file rule. \n14  2.  Similarity of Parties \nThe first-to-file rule \"does not require exact identity of the parties.\"  Kahn, 787 \n15 \nF.3d at 1240.  Rather, the rule may apply where a court concludes that two actions \n16 \npresent \"substantial similarity of parties.\"  I d.; see also Music Grp. Servs. US, Inc. v. \n17 \ninMusic Brands, Inc., No. Cl3-0183MJP, 2013 WL 1499564, at *2 (W.D. Wash. Apr. \n18 \n11, 2013) (\"The requirement of similar parties is satisfied if the parties are substantially \n19 \nsimilar, although nonidentical.\").  In the context of class actions, a court should compare \n20 \nthe putative classes, rather than the named plaintiffs, to determine whether the classes \n21 \nencompass at least some of the same individuals.  Bewley, 2017 WL 5158443, at *2; see \n22 \nORDER-10 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-01122-JLR   Document 80   Filed 12/12/18   Page 11 of 19\n1  also Hilton v. Apple, Inc., No. C-13-2167 EMC, 2013 WL 5487317, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Oct. \n2  1, 2013) (collecting cases).7 \n3  The court begins by comparing the putative classes in this action and in Doe. The \n4  \"Lawfully Present Foreign National Subclass\" asserted here resembles the \n5  \"Non-immigrant Visa Class\" proposed in Doe.  (See Compl. ~ 269( c)); Doe, Dkt. # 42, \n6  ~~ 300, 332.  Both subclasses encompass nationals of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and \n7  Yemen who are lawfully present in the United States, wish to travel abroad and return to \n8  the United States, and fear being subject to E0-3 and barred from reentering the country. \n9  (See Compl. ~ 269(c)); Doe, Dkt. # 42, ~~ 300, 332.  The scope of the subclasses differs, \n10  however.  Doe's \"Non-immigrant Visa Class\" is limited to nonimmigrants who reside in \n11  Washington State, Doe, Dkt. # 42, ~ 300, whereas the subclass proposed here is national \n12  in scope (Compl. ~ 269(c)).  Finally, the other two subclasses proposed in this action-\n13  the \"U.S. Petitioner Subclass\" and the \"Visa Applicant Subclass\"-appear not to be \n14  represented in Doe.  See generally Doe, Dkt. # 42. \n15  The two subclasses absent in Doe, however are virtually identical to the two \n16  subclasses proposed in Emami.  The \"U.S. Petitioner Subclass\" asserted here and the \n17  \"Family Member Class\" in Emami appear to encompass the same individuals:  U.S. \n18 \n19 \n7 As various courts have observed, if the first-to-file rule were to require a strict identity \n20  of the named plaintiffs, the rule would rarely apply in class actions.  See, e.g., Hilton, 2013 WL \n5487317, at *7; Baatz v. Columbia Gas Transmission, LLC, 814 F.3d 785, 791 (6th Cir. 2016). \n\"This result would be in direct conflict to the purposes of the first-to-file rule because class \n21 \nactions are frequently complex affairs which tax judicial resources-the very cases in which the \nprinciples of avoiding duplicative proceedings and inconsistent holdings are at their zenith.\" \n22 \nHilton, 2013 WL 5487317, at *7. \nORDER- 11 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-01122-JLR   Document 80   Filed 12/12/18   Page 12 of 19\n1  citizens and lawful permanent residents with an approved petition to be reunited with a \n2  family member who is a national of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, or Yemen, is subject to \n3  E0-3, and has been denied a waiver or is currently awaiting a decision on a waiver. \n4  (Compl. ~ 269(a)); Emami, Dkt. # 34, ~ 11.  Similarly, the \"Visa Applicant Subclass\" \n5  proposed here closely tracks the \"Visa Applicant Class\" asserted in Emami.  Both \n6  proposed subclasses include Iranian, Libyan, Somali, Syrian, andYe meni nationals who \n7  have applied for immigrant or nonimmigrant visas, are subject to E0-3, and have been \n8  denied a waiver or are currently awaiting a decision on a waiver.  (Compl. ~ 269(c)); \n9  Emami, Dkt. # 34, ~ 12.  From the face of the complaints, and for purposes of the \n10  first-to-file rule, the court can discern no meaningful differences in the parameters of \n11  either set of subclasses. 8  Plaintiffs do not argue otherwise.  (See generally Resp.) \n12  The court acknowledges that the \"Lawfully Present Foreign National Subclass,\" as \n13  well as Pars Equality and OneAmerica, are not represented in Emami.  The absence in an \n14  earlier-filed action of a subclass proposed in a later-filed action is not dispositive for \n15  purposes of the first-to-file analysis, however.  See, e.g., Herrera v.  Wells Fargo Bank, \n16  NA., No. C 11-1485 SBA, 2011 WL 6141087, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 9, 2011) (fmding \n17  that \"the absence of California subclass from the [first-filed] action is not determinative, \n18 \n8 As Defendants point out, the \"Family Member Class\" proposed in Emami is in fact \n19  slightly broader than the \"U.S. Petitioner Subclass\" proposed in this action.  (Mot. at 10 n.3.) \nThe former includes not only United States citizens and lawful permanent residents who have \n20  approved family-based immigration petitions, but also United States citizens and lawful \npermanent residents who have noncitizen relatives abroad who wish to seek nonimmigrant visas \nto enter the United States and are subject to E0-3.  (See id.); see also Emami, Dkt. # 34, ,-r 11. \n21 \nDefendants correctly note that \"while the two [subclasses] are not exactly coterminous, all \nmembers of the 'U.S. Petitioner Subclass' in [this action] fall within the 'Family Member Class' \n22 \nin Emami.\"  (Mot. at 10 n.3.) \nORDER-12 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-01122-JLR   Document 80   Filed 12/12/18   Page 13 of 19\n1  particularly given that both actions involve the same defendant\").  Nor is the absence in \n2  Emami of the organizational Plaintiffs a determinative consideration, given the \n3  significant overlap between the two above-mentioned subclasses.  See Intersearch \n4  WorldWide, Ltd. v. Intersearch Grp., Inc., 544 F. Supp. 2d 949, 959 n.6 (N.D. Cal. 2008) \n5  (\"The [first-to-file] rule is satisfied if some [of] the parties in one matter are also in the \n6  other matter, regardless of whether there are additional unmatched parties in one or both \n7  matters.\"). \n8  In light of the substantial symmetry between this action's \"U.S. Petitioner \n9  Subclass\" and \"Visa Applicant Subclass,\" on the one hand, and Emami's \"Family \n10  Member Class\" and \"Visa Applicant Class,\" on the other, the court finds that Plaintiffs \n11  are more closely related to the plaintiffs in Emami than to those in Doe.  Two of the three \n12  proposed subclasses in this case sweep in virtually the same individuals as the two \n13  proposed subclasses in Emami.  In contrast, this action shares with Doe just one putative \n14  subclass, which although national in scope here, is limited in Doe to residents of \n15  Washington.  The court further observes that each of the Defendants in this action is also \n16  a defendant in Emami.  (See Compl. at 1) ; Emami, Dkt. # 34 at 1.  Plaintiffs thus do not \n17  seek relief against any individual or agency not already implicated in Emami.  For these \n18  reasons, the court concludes that the parties in this case and Emami are substantially \n19  similar for purposes of the first-to-file rule.  The similarity-of-parties factor weighs in \n20  favor of transfer. \n21  II \n22  II \nORDER-13 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-01122-JLR   Document 80   Filed 12/12/18   Page 14 of 19\n1  3.  Similarity of Issues \n2  \"The first-to-file rule is satisfied by a sufficient similarity of issues.\"  Inters earch \n3  Worldwide, 544 F. Supp. 2d at 959 (emphasis omitted).  District courts in this circuit \n4  have held that the issues presented in the actions must be \"substantially similar,\" rather \n5  than identical, to warrant transfer.  Adorna v.  Univ. ofP  hoenix, Inc., 711 F. Supp. 2d \n6  1142, 1147 (E.D. Cal. 2010) (quoting Inherent. com v. Martindale-H-ubbell, 420 F. Supp. \n7  2d 1093, 1097 (N.D. Cal. 2006)); see also Hill v. Robert's Am. Gourmet Food, LLC, No. \n8  13-cv-00696-YGR, 2013 WL 3476801, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Jul. 10, 2013). \n9  Plaintiffs allege that the wavier provision violates the Fifth Amendment's Due \n10  Process Clause and the APA.  (Compl. ~~ 278-306.)  Doe also contests the \n11  constitutionality of the waiver provision on Due Process grounds.  See Doe, Dkt. # 42, \n12  ~~ 325-332.  Yet Plaintiffs' claims and the allegations underlying those claims share \n13  more common ground with the Due Process and APA claims asserted in Emami.  With \n14  respect to the Due Process claims, Plaintiffs here and plaintiffs in Emami allege that the \n15  government has deprived U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents of their \n16  constitutionally protected interest in family reunification and certain statutory and \n17  regulatory rights to petition for visas for their family members, without due process of \n18  law.  (Compl. ~~ 295-306); Emami, Dkt. # 34, ~~ 322-334.  With respect to the APA \n19  claims, Plaintiffs here and plaintiffs in Emami allege, among other things, that they have \n20  been denied waivers without ever having received notice of the waiver process or an \n21  opportunity to demonstrate their eligibility for a waiver.  (See, e.g., Camp!. ~~ 281-285); \n22  Emami, Dkt. # 34, ~~ 11-12, 319-320.  Notably, Plaintiffs do not argue that their claims \nORDER-14 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-01122-JLR   Document 80   Filed 12/12/18   Page 15 of 19\n1  differ in any meaningful fashion from those asserted in Emami.  (See generally Resp.) \n2  The court fmds that the issues presented in this action and in Emami are substantially \n3  similar.  The similarity-of-issues factor thus weighs in favor of transfer. \n4  In sum, the court concludes that transfer of this action is warranted under the \n5  first-to-file rule.  In light of the congruence of two of the three proposed subclasses in this \n6  action and in Emami, as well as the overlapping nature of the class members' claims, \n7  transfer will obviate the risk that class members may face inconsistent rulings.  Transfer \n8  will also promote the principles of efficiency and comity that animate the first-to-file \n9  rule.  To allow two parallel class actions to proceed in separate districts would be \n10  duplicative and inefficient.  See, e.g., Henry v. Home Depot US.A., Inc., No. \n11  14-cv-04858-JST, 2016 WL 4538365, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 31, 2016) (noting that in the \n12  context of transfer under the first-to-file rule, \"[t]he potential efficiency gains are \n13  particularity heightened where ... the class actions involve overlapping claims and class \n14  periods\"). \n15  C.  Convenience Factors \n\\ 16  Plaintiffs argue that in assessing the first-to-file factors, the court may, in its \n17  discretion, analyze the balance of convenience pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a).  (Resp. at \n18  4, 6-7.)  Plaintiffs further argue that Plaintiffs' ties to the Western District of Washington \n19  weigh decisively against transfer.  (Id.)  To that end, Plaintiffs furnish the declarations of \n20  four individual Plaintiffs, which illustrate their ties to this district and investment in these \n21  proceedings.  (See Whitehall Raghebi Decl. (Dkt. # 57); Raghebi Decl. (Dkt. # 58); Siraji \n22  Decl. (Dkt. # 59); Hassan Decl. (Dkt. # 60).)  Defendants, in contrast, assert that because \nORDER-15 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-01122-JLR   Document 80   Filed 12/12/18   Page 16 of 19\n1  the first-to-file rule and 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) afford separate bases for transfer, the court \n2  need not reach the convenience factors Plaintiffs emphasize.  (Reply at 4-5.) \n3  District courts in the Ninth Circuit have expressly distinguished the first-to-file \n4  nlle from 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), which permits transfer for the convenience of parties and \n5  witnesses.  See, e.g., TGN, Inc. v.  CRS, LLC, No. C08-0680MJP, 2008 WL 11343671, at \n6  *2 (W.D. Wash. Aug. 5, 2008).  \"As other district courts have pointed out, a motion to \n7  transfer pursuant to the first-to-file rule does not depend on the presence or absence of the \n8  § 1404(a) considerations.\"  Priddy v. Lane Bryant, Inc., No. 08-06889 MMM (CWx), \n9  2008 WL 11410109, at *9, n.52 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 24, 2008) (citation and quotation marks \n10  omitted).  On occasion, a court assessing the first-to-file factors may consider the extent \n11  to which the convenience of parties and witnesses weighs against transfer.  Pacesetter, \n12  678 F.2d at 96.  However, \"[t]he Ninth Circuit has cautioned that relaxing the first-to-file \n13  rule on the basis of convenience is a determination best left to the court in the first-filed \n14  action.\"  Wallerstein, 967 F. Supp. 2d at 1293 (citing Ward v. Follet Corp., 158 F.R.D. \n15  645, 648 (N.D. Cal. 1994)); see also Pacesetter, 678 F.2d at 96 (stating that \"normally \n16  the forum non conveniens argument should be addressed to the court in the first-filed \n17  action\").  Accordingly, a court deciding a motion to transfer a later-filed action pursuant \n18  to the first-to-file rule typically should decline to assess the convenience factors of \n19  § 1404(a).  See, e.g., Bewley, 2017 WL 5158443, at *3 n.5 (\"Because the Court finds that \n20  transfer is warranted under the first-to-file rule, the Court does not address whether \n21  transfer would be appropriate pursuant to§ 1404(a).\"); Wallerstein, 967 F. Supp. 2d at \n22  II \nORDER-16 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-01122-JLR   Document 80   Filed 12/12/18   Page 17 of 19\n1  1298 (\"As this matter is transferred pursuant to the first-to-file rule, the Court will not \n2  address transfer under Section 1404(a) ....\" ). \n3  Here, because Defendants move to transfer pursuant to the first-to-file rule, not 28 \n4  U.S.C. § 1404(a), and because this case is not the first-filed action, the court declines \n5  Plaintiffs' invitation to assess the balance of convenience under§ 1404(a).  Nonetheless, \n6  the court observes that, in general, Plaintiffs' ties to this district are not as overwhelming \n7  as Plaintiffs' counsel suggest.  Plaintiffs state that a \"plurality\" of Plaintiffs-four \n8  individuals and OneAmerica-reside in the Western District of Washington.  (Resp. at \n9  9.)  Yet Plaintiffs also concede that three named Plaintiffs, as well as Pars Equality, have \n10  \"ties ... to the Northern District of California.\"  (!d.)  The court does not seek to \n11  minimize the connections to this district of four individual Plaintiffs, as well as their \n12  sincere investment in these proceedings.  (See w·hitehall Raghebi Decl.; Raghebi Decl.; \n13  Siraji Decl.; Hassan Decl.)  But as set forth in the record before the court, the balance of \n14  convenience hardly appears to weigh so heavily against transfer as to justify a departure \n15  from the first-to-file rule.  See, e.g., Am. Newland Communities, L.P. v. Axis Specialty \n16  Ins. Co., No. 11CV1217 JLS (WMC), 2011 WL 5359335, at *4 (S.D. Cal. Nov. 7, 2011) \n17  (\"Because consideration of the respective convenience of the two courts is typically \n18  addressed to the court in the first-filed action, ... and because the Court finds that the \n19  balance of convenience is neutral or at most only slightly more favorable to the California \n20  II \n21  II \n22  II \nORDER-17 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-01122-JLR   Document 80   Filed 12/12/18   Page 18 of 19\n1  forum, it declines to exercise its discretion to depart from the frrst-to-file rule here.\"). \n2  Transfer is thus warranted under the first-to-file rule.9 \n3  IV.  CONCLUSION \n4  For the foregoing reasons, the court GRANTS Defendants' motion to transfer this \n5  action to the Northern District of California (Dkt. #55).  The court DIRECTS the clerk to \n6  strike from the court's calendar Defendants' pending motion to dismiss (Dkt. # 64), \n7  Plaintiffs' pending motion to compel (Dkt. # 65), and Defendants pending motion for \n8  II \n9  II \n10 \n11  9 The Ninth Circuit recently held that the first-to-file rule does not negate the statutory \nrequirement that an action may be transferred only to a district where it \"might have been \n12  brought.\" In re Bozic, 888 F.3d 1048, 1054 (9th Cir. 2018) (quoting 28 U.S.C. §1404(a)).  This \nis so because \"[a]lthough the first-to-file rule guides the district court's exercise of discretion in \n13  handling related cases, the requirements of§ 1404(a) cabin the exercise of that discretion.\" \nBozic, 888 F.3d at 1054.  The court understands Bozic to concern only§ 1404(a)'s final clause, \nwhich restricts transfer to those districts in which the action \"might have been brought,\" and not \n14 \nto require that a district court applying the first-to-file rule assess the convenience of the parties \nand \"the interest of justice.\" 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a).  At least one other district court in this circuit \n15 \nhas adopted the same reading of Bozic.  Kutob v. L.A. Ins. Agency Franchising, No. \n2:18-cv-01505-APG-PAL, 2018 WL 4286171, at *3 (D. Nev. Sept. 7, 2018). \n16 \nHere, the Ninth Circuit's ruling in Bozic is satisfied because Plaintiffs could have brought \nthis action in the Northern District of California.  Subject matter jurisdiction exists because \n17  Plaintiffs bring claims arising under the Constitution and federal statutes.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1331. \nDefendants, federal officials and agencies, do not dispute that they are subject to personal \n18  jurisdiction in the Northern District of California.  (See generally Mot.; Reply.)  Finally, venue is \nproper in the Northern District of California under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e), because at least one of \n19  the original named Plaintiffs resides in that district.  (See Compl. ~ 16 (noting that \"Plaintiff Pars \nEquality Center is ... headquartered in Menlo Park, California\"); id. ~ 31 (noting that \"Plaintiff \n20  Malayeen Ahmed ... lives in Santa Clara, California); id. ~ 35 (noting that \"Plaintiff Nicolas \nHanout ... liv[ es] in Castro Valley, California\"); id. ~ 41 (noting that Plaintiff John Doe # 3 ... \nlives in San Francisco, California\")); see also F.L.B. v. Lynch, 180 F. Supp. 3d 811, 815 (W.D. \n21 \nWash. 2016) (holding that in a putative class action against the United States Attorney General \nand other officials, venue was proper under§ 1391(e) \"because at least one of the original \n22 \nplaintiffs resided in the district\" where the action was filed). \nORDER-18 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-01122-JLR   Document 80   Filed 12/12/18   Page 19 of 19\n1  reconsideration of the. court's order granting Plaintiffs' motion to proceed under \n2  pseudonym (Dkt. # 70), and to close this file. \nl-L~  \n3  Dated this  day of December, 2018. \n4 \nJAMES  .

R. Civ. P. 26(f) Conference on \n3 \nSeptember 18, 2018. \n4 \n1.  Nature  and  Complexity  of  the  Case.  Plaintiffs  are  challenging \n5 \nDefendants’ implementation of the waiver provision of Presidential Proclamation No. \n6 \n9645, “Enhancing Vetting Capabilities and Processes for Detecting Attempted Entry into \n7 \nthe  United  States  By  Terrorists  or  other  Public-Safety  Threats”  (“Proclamation”). \n8 \nPlaintiffs assert claims under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Constitution, and \n9 \nseek injunctive and other equitable relief from the Court. In response, Defendants have \n10 \nmoved for dismissal pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to \n11 \nstate a claim upon which relief can be granted. \n12 \n2.  Deadline for Joinder of Additional Parties. The Parties propose a deadline  \n13 \nof November 21, 2018 for joining additional parties. \n14 \n3.  Consent to Assignment to Magistrate Judge: No.  \n15 \n4.  Discovery Plan: The Parties attended an FRCP 26(f) Conference on September \n16 \n18, 2018 by telephone and propose the following discovery plan: \n17 \na.  Initial Disclosures: Per the September 4 Order, the Parties exchanged Initial \n18 \nDisclosures on October 2. Plaintiffs believe that the Initial Disclosures served by \n19 \nDefendants are inadequate and reserve the right to move the court to compel more \n20 \nadequate disclosures. \n21 \nb.  Subjects, timing and potential phasing of discovery:  \n22 \nPlaintiffs propose that: \n23 \ni. Phase I of discovery will involve production of the Administrative \n24 \nRecord. Per Plaintiffs’ motion to compel the Administrative Record, the Record \n25 \nshould have been filed October 2.  Once review of the record is complete, \n26 \nPlaintiffs may seek to compel supplementation of the record.     \n27 \nJOINT STATUS REPORT - 1  LANE POWELL PC \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO. 2:18-CV-1122  P.O. BOX 91302 \nSEATTLE, WA 98111-9402 \n206.223.7000  FAX: 206.223.7107 \n \n\n \nCase 2:18-cv-01122-JLR   Document 68   Filed 10/09/18   Page 3 of 11\n1 \nii. Phase II will consist of any discovery necessary for class certification \n2 \ndiscovery.   \n3 \niii. Phase III will consist of any remaining discovery relevant to the \n4 \nmerits. \n5 \nDefendants assert that discovery should not proceed until such time as the Court \n6 \nhas ruled on Defendants’ motion to dismiss.  Defendants have moved to dismiss on the \n7 \nground that there are no agency decisions subject to review under the Administrative \n8 \nProcedure Act (“APA”). If the Court does not dismiss the entire case and instead \n9 \nidentifies a final agency action that is subject to review under the APA, any discovery \n10 \nshould be limited to the administrative record before the agency at the time the action \n11 \nunder review was taken.  See 5 U.S.C. § 706; Florida Power & Light Co. v. Lorion, 470 \n12 \nU.S. 729, 743-44 (1985). Defendants maintain that, to date, Plaintiffs have failed to \n13 \nidentify what, if any, specific final agency action they are challenging, and therefore \n14 \nwhich administrative record they believe should be produced. Plaintiffs disagree and \n15 \ncontend  that  the  Complaint  identifies  the  final  agency  actions  challenged.  It  is \n16 \nDefendants’ position that if the case is not dismissed and Plaintiffs’ challenge is better \n17 \ndefined, Defendants will produce an administrative record with their Answer to the \n18 \nComplaint, as contemplated in LCR 79(h). \n19 \nc. Electronically stored information: Both Parties will likely have electronically \n20 \nstored information. Plaintiffs anticipate that the vast majority of electronically stored \n21 \ninformation will be in Defendants’ possession. \n22 \nd.  Privilege issues:  The Parties anticipate that the Defendants will assert various \n23 \nprivileges.  Any document withheld in full or in part on the basis of a privilege by either \n24 \nParty will be identified on a log with sufficient particularity to allow assessment of the \n25 \nprivilege. To the extent documents are withheld from the administrative record or this \n26 \nCourt directs discovery beyond the administrative record, Defendants will provide \n27 \nJOINT STATUS REPORT - 2  LANE POWELL PC \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO. 2:18-CV-1122  P.O. BOX 91302 \nSEATTLE, WA 98111-9402 \n206.223.7000  FAX: 206.223.7107 \n \n\n \nCase 2:18-cv-01122-JLR   Document 68   Filed 10/09/18   Page 4 of 11\n1 \nPlaintiffs with a privilege log. \n2 \ne.  Proposed limitations on discovery:  Plaintiffs will not be in a position to \n3 \ndetermine whether the presumptive limits on numbers of depositions and interrogatories \n4 \nunder Rules 30 and 33 are adequate until access to the Administrative Record has been \n5 \nprovided.  Defendants take the position there should be no discovery until their Rule 12 \n6 \nmotion is decided. If the case is not dismissed in whole, Defendants believe that any \n7 \ndiscovery should be limited to the administrative record.  If this Court authorizes \n8 \ndiscovery  beyond  the  administrative  record,  Defendants  believe  the  limits  on \n9 \ndepositions and interrogatories under Rules 30 and 33 are appropriate. \n10 \nf.  The need for any discovery related orders:  Plaintiffs have filed a motion to \n11 \ncompel production of the Administrative Record and Defendants’ initial disclosures. \n12 \nDefendants will oppose the motion. Further, Defendants plan to file motions (i) to stay \n13 \ndiscovery pending resolution of the Rule 12 motion, and (ii) for a protective order to \n14 \nlimit any discovery to the administrative record of the agency decision that the Court \n15 \nidentifies as subject to APA review.   \n16 \n 5.  The Parties Views, Proposals and Agreements on Local Rule 26(f)(1) Items: \n17 \n    a.  Prompt case resolution: Plaintiffs believe that assessment of potential for \n18 \nprompt case resolution is premature until the Administrative Record has been produced.  \n19 \nSubject to assessment of the Administrative Record, plaintiffs will promptly evaluate the case \n20 \nfor potential injunctive relief.  The Defendants have filed a Rule 12 motion. \n21 \n    b.  Alternative dispute resolution:  The Parties agree this case is not a candidate \n22 \nfor alternative dispute resolution. \n23 \n    c.  Related cases:  Plaintiffs designated this case as related to Doe v. Trump, \n24 \n2:17-cv-0178-JLR.  See ECF 39. As Plaintiffs set out in their September 24, 2018 Opposition \n25 \nto Defendants’ Motion to Transfer Venue, the Doe complaint includes allegations and claims \n26 \nrelating specifically to the Proclamation’s waiver provision and the manner in which it would \n27 \nJOINT STATUS REPORT - 3  LANE POWELL PC \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO. 2:18-CV-1122  P.O. BOX 91302 \nSEATTLE, WA 98111-9402 \n206.223.7000  FAX: 206.223.7107 \n \n\n \nCase 2:18-cv-01122-JLR   Document 68   Filed 10/09/18   Page 5 of 11\n1 \nbe implemented. As argued in their September 6, 2018, Motion to Transfer Case, Defendants \n2 \ndo not agree that this case is related to Doe. Instead, Defendants believe this case is related to \n3 \nEmami, et al. v. Nielsen, et al., No. 18-cv-01587-JD (N.D. Cal. filed Mar. 13, 2018). Emami is \n4 \na putative class action case that raises substantially similar issues and was filed on behalf of a \n5 \nputative class that is defined in almost the same way as the putative class here. \n6 \n    d.  Discovery management: Plaintiffs are amenable to sharing discovery from \n7 \nthird parties, scheduling case management or discovery conferences and presenting discovery \n8 \ndisputes to the court by informal means. To the extent discovery proceeds and is not limited to \n9 \nthe  administrative  record,  Defendants  are  amenable  to  scheduling  case  management  or \n10 \ndiscovery conferences and presenting discovery disputes to the court by informal means, when \n11 \nappropriate. The Parties do not consent to presenting discovery issues to a magistrate judge. \n12 \n    e.    Anticipated  discovery  sought:  Plaintiffs  anticipate  that  they  will  seek \n13 \ndiscovery on their constitutional claims, including depositions, written party discovery and third \n14 \nparty discovery.  Plaintiffs will not be in a position to determine whether the presumptive limits \n15 \non numbers of depositions and interrogatories under Rules 30 and 33 are adequate until access \n16 \nto the Administrative Record has been provided.  Defendants maintain that, should this case not \n17 \nbe dismissed under Rule 12, discovery should be limited to the administrative record of the \n18 \nagency decision that the Court identifies as subject to APA review.  Defendants will produce \n19 \nan administrative record with their Answer to the Complaint, as contemplated in LCR 79(h).  If \n20 \nthe case is not limited to record review, Defendants anticipate taking discovery from Plaintiffs \n21 \non both class certification and the merits.   \n22 \n    f.  Phasing motions: Plaintiffs anticipate filing a motion for class certification.  \n23 \nFollowing production of the complete Administrative Record, Plaintiffs will assess the potential \n24 \nfor moving for preliminary injunctive relief.  Defendants have filed (i) a motion to transfer, and \n25 \n(ii) a Rule 12 motion, and may seek to stay proceedings pending resolution of the Rule 12 \n26 \nmotion. \n27 \nJOINT STATUS REPORT - 4  LANE POWELL PC \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO. 2:18-CV-1122  P.O.

Preservation of discoverable information: Plaintiffs have issued document \n2 \nholds.  Defendants have issued document holds. \n3 \n    h.  Inadvertent Production of Privilege issues:  The Parties are willing to meet \n4 \nand confer as to entry of an order governing inadvertent production of privileged information \n5 \nin accordance with Rule of Evidence 502(d). \n6 \n    i & j.  Model Protocol for Discovery of ESI and alternatives to Model Protocol:  \n7 \nThe Parties will discuss the suitability of an ESI protocol when the scope of discovery and \n8 \npotential ESI issue is clearer. \n9 \n 6.  Discovery Deadline. The Plaintiffs propose a discovery deadline of nine months \n10 \nfrom the date of production of the Administrative Record.   Plaintiffs propose that class \n11 \ncertification discovery be completed three to four months after production of the Administrative \n12 \nRecord, and that an additional period of merits discovery follow that.  Depending on timing and \n13 \nextent  of  the  Administrative  Record  and  discovery  ordered,  Plaintiffs  anticipate  merits \n14 \ndiscovery can be completed 6 months after class certification discovery. Defendants do not \n15 \nbelieve discovery is appropriate.  Should discovery proceed in this case, it should be limited to \n16 \nthe administrative record of the agency decision that the Court identifies as subject to APA \n17 \nreview. Defendants will produce an administrative record with their Answer to the Complaint, \n18 \nas contemplated in LCR 79(h) and do not believe any other discovery deadline is necessary. \n19 \n 7.  Bifurcation. Bifurcation is unnecessary. \n20 \n8.  Rule 16 Pretrial Statement and Pretrial Order: The Parties do not believe the \n21 \nstandard Rule 16 pretrial statements and pretrial order shall be dispensed with.    \n22 \n 9.  Individualized Trial Program: The Parties agree this matter is not a candidate \n23 \nfor the individualized trial program. \n24 \n10.  Shortening the Case. The Plaintiffs will evaluate the case for potential interim \n25 \ninjunctive relief once the Administrative Record has been produced.  The Defendants have filed \n26 \na Rule 12 motion. \n27 \nJOINT STATUS REPORT - 5  LANE POWELL PC \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO. 2:18-CV-1122  P.O.

Plaintiffs believe the case will be ready for trial ten \n2 \nmonths from production of the Administrative Record, i.e., if the Administrative Record is \n3 \nproduced promptly, the case will be ready for trial in August 2019. If this Court finds \n4 \ndismissal is inappropriate, Defendants believe this case should be resolved through summary \n5 \njudgment motions based on the administrative record. \n6 \n12.  Jury Trial. Should this Court find trial necessary, the Parties agree that this \n7 \nwould be a non-jury trial. \n8 \n13.  Length  of  Trial.  Plaintiffs  believe  this  will  require  assessment  of  the \n9 \nAdministrative Record. Defendants believe this case should be resolved through summary \n10 \njudgment motions based on the administrative record. \n11 \n14.  Trial counsel. Darin Sands, Jessica Walder, and Aaron Fickes of Lane Powell \n12 \nPC will serve as trial counsel for Plaintiffs. August E. Flentje, Gisela Westwater, David Kim, \n13 \nand Nicole Grant will serve as trial counsel for Defendants.  \n14 \n15.  Trial counsel conflicts.  The Parties have not identified any conflicts. \n15 \n16.  Service of Process. All Defendants have been served. \n16 \n17.  Scheduling Conference. Plaintiffs believe an initial scheduling conference \n17 \nwould be helpful, and that it would be most efficient to schedule this in conjunction with a \n18 \nhearing on the Defendants’ Rule 12 motion, which Plaintiffs plan to request in their \n19 \nOpposition to Defendants’ motion. Defendants believe that a scheduling conference should \n20 \nbe delayed until after the Court resolves Defendants’ pending motion to dismiss. \n21 \n18.  Corporate Disclosures: Plaintiffs filed corporate disclosures on August 8, \n22 \n2018 (ECF 48 & 49). Defendants are exempt from corporate disclosures under LCR 7.1. \n23     \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \nJOINT STATUS REPORT - 6  LANE POWELL PC \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO. 2:18-CV-1122  P.O.

Trump, Case No. 2:17-cv-0178-JLR \n4   \n5  Doe v. Trump is currently pending before Judge James L. Robart.  Both Pars Equality \n6  Center et al. v. Pompeo and Doe v.

This lawsuit challenges Defendants’ implementation of the waiver provision of \n23  Presidential  Proclamation  No.  9645,  “Enhancing  Vetting  Capabilities  and  Processes  for \n24  Detecting Attempted Entry into the United States By Terrorists or other Public-Safety Threats” \n25  (“Proclamation”). The Proclamation indefinitely bans millions of nationals of five Muslim-\n26  majority countries from entering the United States. For many thousands of individuals and \n27  families indefinitely separated by the President’s ban, the Proclamation’s waiver provision has, \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 1 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.   P.O. BOX 91302 \nSEATTLE, WA 98111-9402 \n206.223.7000  FAX: 206.223.7107 \n \n\n \n  Case 2:18-cv-01122-BHS   Document 1   Filed 07/31/18   Page 2 of 68\n \n1  as a practical matter, amounted to nothing more than an empty promise—in the words of Justice \n2  Breyer, merely “window dressing.” \n3  2.  Under the Proclamation, the only way that banned individuals can now gain \n4  entry to the United States is by obtaining a waiver. See Section 3(c), Proc. No. 9645 (hereinafter \n5  “waiver provision”). But the Proclamation’s waiver provision has been implemented in such a \n6  haphazard, opaque, and capricious manner, and so few visa applicants have actually been \n7  granted waivers under the Proclamation, that the process by which waivers are supposedly \n8  granted has become part and parcel of the ban itself.  \n9  3.  Indeed, a former consular official and State Department employee has stated in \n10  a sworn declaration “that there really is no waiver,” because consular officers have been \n11  instructed “to determine at all possible cost that the [visa applicant] was not eligible to even \n12  apply for the waiver.” See Exhibit A. \n13  4.  What  is  publicly  known  about  Defendants’  implementation  of  the \n14  Proclamation’s waiver provision is consistent with this assessment. \n15  5.  When the Proclamation went into effect, there were mass denials of waivers, \n16  regardless of whether the applicant had already had a consular interview, whether the applicant \n17  had any meaningful notice of the availability of a waiver, or whether the applicant had an \n18  opportunity to present evidence of eligibility for a waiver. \n19  6.  There is no application form for a waiver from the Proclamation’s ban. There is \n20  no information about how an individual seeking a visa can demonstrate his or her eligibility \n21  under the criteria set out in the Proclamation. There is no formal opportunity provided in the \n22  visa application process for an individual to demonstrate eligibility for a waiver. Nor do there \n23  appear to be consistent processes by which to accept and consider requests for waivers. \n24  7.  As implemented by Defendants, moreover, the process and standard by which \n25  waivers are granted are dramatically different from what the Proclamation sets out. The few \n26  public disclosures about how the State Department is implementing the Proclamation’s waiver \n27  provision  indicate  that  consular  officers  are  assessing  visa  applicants’  waiver  eligibility \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 2 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.

Numerous individuals—including every individual Plaintiff in \n3  this action—fall within the circumstances identified by the Proclamation as warranting a waiver, \n4  but have nevertheless been unable to obtain a waiver. \n5  8.  Given the unduly restrictive manner in which Defendants have implemented the \n6  Proclamation’s waiver provision, families from the five majority-Muslim banned countries \n7  remain unnecessarily separated, and cannot celebrate traditional milestones together like births, \n8  graduations,  weddings,  and  birthdays,  or  provide  support  through  illness  and  hardship. \n9  Institutions of higher learning cannot bring academics and students from the banned countries \n10  to pursue research or study in the United States. Employers are unable to hire or employ \n11  qualified individuals from the banned countries. \n12  9.  The plaintiffs in this lawsuit are individuals facing indefinite separation from \n13  their families, for whom a waiver from the ban is the only way they can reunite with their \n14  families, and organizations who serve individuals in similar straits. They respectfully request \n15  that the Court enjoin Defendants from implementing or enforcing any part of the Proclamation’s \n16  waiver provision in a manner that violates the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), the INA, \n17  the Constitution, or the Proclamation itself. \n18  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n19  10.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343 \n20  over Plaintiffs’ claims under the U.S. Constitution and federal statutes. The Court has additional \n21  remedial authority under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-02. \n22  11.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) and Local Rule § 104(e). Defendants \n23  are officers or employees of the United States acting in their official capacities, and agencies of \n24  the  United  States.  Organizational  Plaintiff  OneAmerica  and  individual  plaintiffs  Pamela \n25  Whitehall Raghebi, Zeinab Mohamed Hassan, and Siraji Etha Siraji reside in the Seattle \n26  Division of this District.

The Plaintiffs in this case are both individuals and organizations. The individual \n3  plaintiffs are United States citizens and foreign nationals lawfully present in the United States,  \n4  whose efforts to reunite here with relatives abroad have been delayed or indefinitely thwarted \n5  by the President’s executive orders (“EOs”)1 and by Defendants’ implementation of the waiver \n6  provision; individuals abroad who have been left with no avenue to reunite with family and \n7  loved ones in the United States because of the EOs and the Proclamation’s waiver requirement; \n8  and legally present foreign nationals from countries subject to the Proclamation who, but for \n9  the uncertainty created by the waiver process, wish to travel abroad and return to the United \n10  States. \n11  13.  Some individual plaintiffs have approved I-130 immigrant petitions for their \n12  relatives abroad; of these, some are awaiting a decision on their immigrant visa applications \n13  and a waiver, while others have already been denied waivers and visas. Other plaintiffs are \n14  foreign nationals who have filed nonimmigrant visa petitions to visit and reunite with loved \n15  ones present in the United States, and who are either awaiting a decision or have been denied \n16  waivers and visas. \n17  14.  All the individual plaintiffs have been forced to endure a prolonged separation \n18  from their loved ones because of the EOs and, now, Defendants’ unlawful implementation of \n19  the Proclamation’s waiver provision. \n20  15.  The organizational plaintiffs serve individuals or have members and clients who, \n21  like the individual plaintiffs, are United States citizens or lawful permanent residents with \n22  relatives abroad who are nationals of a banned country and who are seeking immigrant or \n23  nonimmigrant visas. The organizational plaintiffs assert standing on their own behalf, and \n24  plaintiff Pars Equality Center also asserts standing on behalf of its clients. \n                                                 \n25 \n1 Exec.

He is sued in his official capacity. \n3  46.  Defendant U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) is a cabinet-level \n4  department of the United States federal government. Its components include U.S. Citizenship \n5  and  Immigration  Services  (“USCIS”),  Customs  and  Border  Protection  (“CBP”),  and \n6  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”). USCIS’s responsibilities include adjudicating \n7  requests for immigration benefits for individuals located within the United States. CBP’s \n8  responsibilities include inspecting and admitting immigrants and nonimmigrant arriving with \n9  U.S.  visas  at  international  points  of  entry,  including  airports  and  land  borders.  ICE’s \n10  responsibilities include enforcing federal immigration law within the interior of the United \n11  States.

The  first  attempt,  EO-1,  was  signed  one  week  after  President  Trump’s \n4  inauguration. 82 Fed. Reg. 8977 (Jan. 27, 2017). \n5  51.  EO-1 banned for 90 days the entry of any national from seven Muslim-majority \n6  countries, banned the entry of all refugees for 120 days, and indefinitely banned the entry of all \n7  Syrian refugees. It was rushed into effect so quickly that it blindsided not only key members of \n8  the Cabinet but also the agencies charged with its implementation, causing chaos at airports \n9  across the nation and confusion among the ranks of U.S. Custom and Border Protection, the \n10  Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of State. \n11  52.  Although EO-1 was soon enjoined after it was issued, President Trump was \n12  undeterred. On March 6, 2017, he signed EO-2, which was extremely similar to EO-1 in most \n13  material respects and, according to Trump Administration officials, was intended to achieve the \n14  same policy outcomes as EO-1. After facing further successful legal challenges to EO-2, \n15  President Trump replaced it with the Proclamation on September 24, 2017. \n16  The September 24, 2017 Presidential Proclamation \n53.  The Proclamation, which went into effect on or around December 8, 2017, states \n17 \nthat all nationals seeking entry as immigrants from five Muslim-majority countries (Iran, Libya, \n18 \nSomalia, Syria, and Yemen) are banned indefinitely. \n19 \n54.  The Proclamation likewise indefinitely bans non-immigrant entry for  most \n20 \nnationals from these countries, either by banning non-immigrant entry entirely (Syria), banning \n21 \nentry based on the most commonly used non-immigrant visas for nationals from the affected \n22 \ncountries (Iran, Libya, Yemen), or subjecting non-immigrant visas applicants to “additional \n23 \nscrutiny” (Somalia).3 \n24 \n                                                 \n25  3 The Proclamation initially included Chad and banned nationals of Chad from seeking entry as immigrants, as \nwell as entry based on the types of non-immigrant visas most commonly sought by nationals of Chad. On April \n26  10, 2018, fifteen days before the Supreme Court of the United States heard oral arguments on constitutional and \nstatutory challenges to the Proclamation in Trump v. Hawai’i, President Trump issued a new Presidential \n27 \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 11 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.   P.O.

The Proclamation also bans certain Venezuelan government officials and their \n2  immediate relatives who seek to enter the United States on non-immigrant visitor and business \n3  visas. Estimates suggest that at most a few hundred Venezuelans will be affected by EO-3 each \n4  year. \n5  56.  Similarly, the Proclamation categorically bans all nationals of North Korea from \n6  entering the United States. The number of entries to the United States by North Korea has been \n7  so historically low that fewer than 100 visa applicants on average will be affected by the \n8  Proclamation per year. \n9  57.  The impact of the Proclamation thus falls almost entirely on Muslims. For \n10  example, if it had been in effect in 2016, the Proclamation would have denied immigrant visas \n11  to 12,998 Yemenis, 7,727 Iranians, 9 North Koreans, and 0 Venezuelans. \n12  58.  Before it could go into effect, the Proclamation was enjoined by two district \n13  courts on the grounds that it violated the Establishment Clause and the INA. Int’l Refugee \n14  Assistance Project v. Trump, 265 F. Supp. 3d 570, 633 (D. Md. 2017), aff’d 833 F.3d 233 (4th \n15  Cir. 2018), vacated 2018 WL 1256938; Hawai’i v. Trump, 265 F.

The government subsequently petitioned the Supreme Court for a stay of the \n18  injunctions during the pendency of the government’s appeals of the injunctions to the Fourth \n19  and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals. The Supreme Court granted the government’s application \n20  for a stay on December 4, 2017. \n21  60.

Like its predecessors, the Proclamation allows for waivers to its entry bans on a \n2 \ncase-by-case basis. Proclamation § 3(c). \n3 \n62.  The Proclamation’s waiver provision states that a foreign national may be \n4 \ngranted a waiver if she satisfies three criteria: first, that “denying entry” would cause her “undue \n5 \nhardship;” second, that her “entry would not pose a threat to the national security or public \n6 \nsafety of the United States;” and third, that her “entry would be in the national interest.” \n7 \nProclamation § 3(c)(i). \n8 \n63.  The visa applicant has the burden of “demonstrat[ing] to the consular officer’s \n9 \nor CBP official’s satisfaction” that the applicant meets each of the three criteria set out in \n10 \nSection 3(c)(i). \n11 \n64.  The Proclamation also provides nine examples of circumstances in which a \n12 \nwaiver might be appropriate, “such as” when a visa applicant “seeks to enter the United States \n13 \nto visit or reside with a close family member . . . who is a United States citizen;” “seeks to \n14 \nreenter the United States to resume” long-term work or study; “has previously established \n15 \nsignificant contacts with the United States;” or “is an infant, a young child or adoptee” or “an \n16 \nindividual needing urgent medical care.” Proclamation § 3(c)(iv)(A)-(J). \n17 \n65.  The waiver provision gives discretion to grant waivers specifically to consular \n18 \nofficers, the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, or a “designee” of the CBP \n19 \nCommissioner. It further states that “a waiver may be granted only if a foreign national \n20 \ndemonstrates to the consular officer’s or CBP official’s satisfaction that” the foreign national \n21 \nmeets the three eligibility criteria (emphasis added). \n22 \n66.  In  addition,  the  Proclamation  states  that  “[t]he  Secretary  of  State  and  the \n23 \nSecretary  of  Homeland  Security  shall  coordinate  to  adopt  guidance  addressing  the \n24 \ncircumstances in which waivers may be appropriate for foreign nationals seeking entry as \n25 \nimmigrants or nonimmigrants.” Proclamation § 3(c)(ii) (emphasis added). \n26 \n27 \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 13 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.

Section 3(c)(ii) of the Proclamation states that this required guidance “shall \n2  address the standards, policies, and procedures” for five specific agency actions: \n3  A) “determining whether the entry of a foreign national would not pose a threat to \n4  the national security or public safety of the United States;” \n5  B) “determining whether the entry of a foreign national would be in the national \n6  interest;” \n7  C) “addressing and managing the risks of making such a determination in light of \n8  the inadequacies in information sharing, identity management, and other potential \n9  dangers posed by the nationals of individual countries subject to the restrictions and \n10  limitations imposed by this proclamation;” \n11  D) “assessing whether the United States has access, at the time of the waiver \n12  determination, to sufficient information about the foreign national to determine \n13  whether entry would satisfy the requirements” set out in the Proclamation for waiver \n14  eligibility; and \n15  E) “determining the special circumstances that would justify granting a waiver” as \n16  outlined in by the Proclamation in Section 3(c)(iv)(A)-(J). Proclamation § 3(c)(ii) \n17  (A)-(E) (emphasis added). \n18  68.  The Proclamation does not require the Secretary of State or the Secretary of \n19  Homeland Security to keep the guidance ordered by Section 3(c)(ii) secret or non-public. \n20  69.  To  the  extent  such  guidance  ordered  by  Section  3(c)(ii)  has  in  fact  been \n21  promulgated, it has not been made public, nor did the agencies adopt such guidance through \n22  notice and comment. \n23  70.  The government has not made public the guidance that the Proclamation directed \n24  the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security to adopt “addressing the circumstances in which \n25  waivers  may  be  appropriate  for  foreign  nationals  seeking  entry  as  immigrants  or \n26  nonimmigrants.” Proclamation § 3(c)(ii). \n27 \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 14 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.

Shortly after the Proclamation went into effect, the State Department published \n2  a set of “Frequently Asked Questions” (“FAQs”) on its website in which it confirmed, “There \n3  is no separate application for a waiver.” December 4, 2017 – Court Order on Presidential \n4  Proclamation, UNITED STATES DEP’T OF STATE, https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-\n5  visas/visa-information-resources/presidential-proclamation-archive/2017-12-04-Presidential-\n6  Proclamation.html. \n7  72.  The FAQs, which mostly refer back to the text of the Proclamation itself, further \n8  advised that any “individual who seeks to travel to the United States should apply for a visa and \n9  disclose during the visa interview any information that might demonstrate that he or she is \n10  eligible for a waiver.” \n11  73.  The FAQs, however, provide no guidance about what kind of “information” the \n12  applicant should disclose to demonstrate the applicant’s eligibility for a waiver. \n13  74.  Nor do the FAQs provide any guidance for individuals whose visa interview had \n14  already taken place before the Proclamation went into effect, who had no opportunity to \n15  “disclose during the visa interview” any waiver-related information. \n16  The State Department Letters \n75.  Apart from the text of the Proclamation itself and the sparse FAQs on the State \n17 \nDepartment website, the primary source of information about Defendants’ implementation of \n18 \nthe waiver provision comes from two letters that the State Department sent in February and \n19 \nJune 2018, in response to inquiries from Senator Chris Van Hollen about the Proclamation and \n20 \nhow the waiver provision was being implemented.4  See Exhibits B and C. \n21 \n76.

(discussing June 2018 letter). \n7  77.  In the first letter, sent on February 22, 2018 (the “February 22 letter”), the State \n8  Department stated that as of February 15, 2018, only two waivers had been granted, while over \n9  8,400 had been denied. See Exhibit B. \n10  78.  According to the February 22 letter, “[i]f an applicant from one of the designated \n11  countries is determined to be otherwise eligible for a visa under the INA, the interviewing \n12  officer must then determine whether the applicant falls into one of the exceptions to the \n13  Proclamation.”5 If such an applicant does not fall within one of the exceptions, the consular \n14  officer then considers the applicant for a waiver. \n15  79.  The February 22 letter stated that when considering an applicant for a waiver, \n16  “[c]onsular officers may grant waivers on a case-by-case basis when the applicant demonstrates \n17  to the officer’s satisfaction that he or she meets the three criteria” set out in Section 3(c) of the \n18  Proclamation: “(1) denying entry would cause the foreign national undue hardship; (2) entry \n19  would not pose a threat to the national security or public safety of the United States; and (3) \n20  entry would be in the national interest.” \n21  80.  The manner in which Defendants have implemented the waiver provision, \n22  however,  requires that  a visa applicant meet a significantly higher standard  of proof of \n23  eligibility than the criteria set forth in the text of the Proclamation. \n24 \n25                                                   \n5 The Proclamation expressly excepts, and states that its suspensions on entry shall not apply to, among others, \n26 \nlawful permanent residents; dual nationals traveling on a passport issued by a non-banned country; foreign \nnationals traveling on diplomatic visas; foreign nationals who have been granted asylum; admitted refugees; and \n27 \ncertain other narrow categories of foreign nationals. Proclamation § 3(b). \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 16 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.   P.O.

For example, the Proclamation states that a visa applicant may be granted a \n2  waiver if, among other things, the applicant can demonstrate to a consular officer’s satisfaction \n3  that “denying entry would cause undue hardship.” The February 22 letter, however, states that \n4  to satisfy the “undue hardship” criterion, an applicant “must demonstrate to the consular \n5  officer’s satisfaction that an unusual situation exists that compels immediate travel by the \n6  applicant and that delaying visa issuance and the associated travel plans would defeat the \n7  purpose of travel.” (emphasis added). \n8  82.  The February 22 letter does not explain why “undue hardship”—a standard \n9  undefined in any immigration statutes or regulations relevant to waivers—is tied to a necessity \n10  for “immediate travel.” Nor does the February 22 letter explain how an applicant unaware of \n11  the February 22 letter would have any notice or understanding that this criterion requires a \n12  showing of an “unusual situation that compels immediate travel.” \n13  83.  Similarly, the Proclamation states that to qualify for a waiver, a visa applicant \n14  must demonstrate that “entry would not pose a threat to the national security or public safety of \n15  the United States.” In contrast, the February 22 letter states specifically that for an applicant to \n16  meet this criterion, a consular officer must “consider[] the information-sharing and identity-\n17  management protocols and practices of the government of the applicant’s country of nationality \n18  as they relate to the applicant.” The consular officer may only issue a visa “with the concurrence \n19  of a consular manager” if the consular officer determines, “after consultation with the Visa \n20  Office, that an applicant does not pose a threat to national security or public safety and the other \n21  two requirements have been met.” \n22  84.  The February 22 letter does not provide further guidance on how a visa applicant \n23  can satisfy the burden of proof for this criterion when it is incumbent on the consular officer, \n24  independent of whatever documentation or information the applicant may proffer, to consider \n25  the information-sharing and identity-management protocols and practices of the applicant’s \n26  country of nationality. Nor does the February 22 letter provide guidance on how a visa applicant \n27 \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 17 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.   P.O.

The February 22 letter likewise fails to explain how an applicant has any way of \n4  knowing  how  her  country’s  information-sharing  and  identity-management  protocols  and \n5  practices relate specifically to her, in order to demonstrate that she poses no threat to U.S. \n6  national security or public safety. \n7  86.  In addition, the February 22 letter does not explain how a consular officer may \n8  meaningfully exercise any discretion in deciding whether to grant or deny a waiver when the \n9  consular officer must consult with the Visa Office and a consular manager to determine whether \n10  the visa applicant has met all three eligibility criteria for a waiver. \n11  87.  With respect to the third criterion, the Proclamation states that a visa applicant \n12  must demonstrate that his or her “entry would be in the national interest.” The February 22 \n13  letter,  however,  reveals  that,  to  meet  the  “national  interest”  criteria,  the  applicant  must \n14  “demonstrate[] to the consular officer’s satisfaction that a U.S. person or entity would suffer \n15  hardship if the applicant could not travel until after visa restrictions imposed with respect to \n16  nationals of that country are lifted.” \n17  88.  The February 22 letter does not explain how a visa applicant can satisfy the \n18  burden of proof for this criterion when no individual visa applicant has any way of knowing \n19  when the U.S. government will decide to lift visa restrictions on nationals of her country. \n20  89.  In addition to defining more stringent waiver criteria than the Proclamation \n21  itself, the February 22 letter describes a more restrictive view of the exemplar circumstances \n22  under which the Proclamation states that waivers may be appropriate. \n23  90.  The February 22 letter cites Section 3(c)(iv) of the Proclamation as providing \n24  “examples of the circumstances in which a waiver might be appropriate,” and states that \n25  “consular officers may consult with the Visa Office if a consular officer believes a case may \n26  warrant a waiver but the applicant’s circumstances do not align with one of the examples in the \n27  Proclamation.” \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 18 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.

Proclamation  §  3(c)(iv)  (“Case-by-case  waivers  .  .  .  may  be \n3  appropriate . . . in individual circumstances such as the following . . .” (emphasis added)). \n4  92.  There  is  no  public  information  available  indicating  that  Defendants  have \n5  provided guidance to consular officers making clear that a visa applicant need not specifically \n6  align with one of the examples in the Proclamation to be eligible for a waiver. \n7  93.  There  is  no  public  information  available  indicating  that  Defendants  have \n8  provided any guidance to consular officers on what specific circumstances might warrant a \n9  consular officer’s consultation with the Visa Office. \n10  94.  Like the State Department’s on-line FAQs, the February 22 letter confirms that \n11  “[t]here is no waiver form to be completed by the applicant.” \n12  95.  The February 22 letter, however, does not provide guidance on how  visa \n13  applicants can satisfy the burden of proof under the Proclamation when the visa application \n14  materials they submit do not specifically address the waiver criteria and applicants are not \n15  otherwise given an opportunity to provide information to the State Department to demonstrate \n16  their eligibility for a waiver. \n17  96.  Nor does the February 22 letter explain how consular officers are expected to \n18  make rational and informed decisions on an applicant’s eligibility for a waiver when the visa \n19  application materials they consider do not solicit information regarding the waiver criteria and \n20  no systematized and orderly process to receive evidence of applicants’ eligibility for a waiver \n21  has been established. \n22  97.  On April 19, 2018, Senator Van Hollen and other senators requested further \n23  information on the implementation of the waiver provision from the Departments of State and \n24  Homeland Security. The Department of State responded via letter on June 22, 2018 (the “June \n25  22 letter”). See Exhibit C. \n26  98.

The lack of information provided either in the Proclamation or in subsequent \n5 \ngovernment statements about how waivers will be granted has resulted in a waiver process that \n6 \nis opaque, confusing, arbitrary, and untethered to the Proclamation itself, to say nothing of \n7 \nexisting immigration laws and regulations. \n8 \n100.  Indeed, the implementation of the Proclamation’s waiver provision appears to \n9 \nhave been rushed and chaotic, and in many instances, violated the terms of the Proclamation \n10 \nitself. \n11 \n101.  Upon information and belief, hundreds, if not thousands, of denials6 of waivers \n12 \nwere issued via standardized form letters in the first month after the Proclamation went into \n13 \neffect on or around December 8, 2017. \n14 \n102.  These mass waiver denials appear to have been sent without regard to the status \n15 \nof any particular individual’s visa application. Denials were sent to individuals who had already \n16 \ncompleted their consular interviews; to individuals who had scheduled but had not yet appeared \n17 \nfor their consular interviews; and to individuals who had not  yet been offered consular \n18 \ninterviews. \n19 \n103.  None of these individuals who received waiver denials were given notice of the \n20 \navailability of a waiver or an opportunity to demonstrate their eligibility for such a waiver. \n21 \n104.  The mass form denials extended even to individuals, such as Plaintiff Yahya \n22 \nGhaleb’s son, who had previously received verbal or written notice that their visa applications \n23 \n24 \n25                                                   \n6 Because communications from the consulate to visa applicants, including application status information provided \n26 \non-line via the U.S. Department of State Consular Electronic Application Center (“CEAC”), have used inconsistent \nterminology, any references to “denials” and decisions to “deny” waivers in this complaint also encompass \n27 \n“refusals” and decisions to “refuse” waivers. \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 20 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.

To add to the lack of clarity surrounding the waiver process, at least some of \n4  these individuals who received mass form denials from the U.S. Embassy in Djibouti in the \n5  early  days  of  the  waiver  provision’s  implementation  have  more  recently  received  email \n6  communications  from  the  consulate  indicating  that  their  waiver  eligibility  was  being \n7  “reconsidered.” \n8  106.  In the weeks and months following the initial implementation of the waiver \n9  provision, the waiver process has become no less opaque and confusing to affected individuals \n10  with pending visa applications. \n11  107.  The FAQs published by the State Department, for example, advise that visa \n12  applicants should “disclose during the visa interview any information that might demonstrate \n13  that he or she is eligible for a waiver.” \n14  108.  For most, if not all, visa applicants from the banned countries, the consular \n15  interview represents the only opportunity to present evidence supporting their eligibility for a \n16  waiver. This is because currently available visa applications do not expressly ask applicants to \n17  provide information relevant to the Proclamation’s three separate criteria for waiver eligibility, \n18  and because the government has declined to establish an application or other procedure by \n19  which visa applicants can request waivers and demonstrate that they satisfy the criteria. \n20  109.  When the Proclamation went into effect, thousands of pending visa applicants \n21  had already completed their consular interviews. \n22  110.  Many of these individuals were denied a waiver and a visa without ever having \n23  been given notice of the availability of a waiver, and without having been given the opportunity, \n24  either through a second consular interview or otherwise, to demonstrate their eligibility for a \n25  waiver. \n26  111.  Likewise, when the Proclamation went into effect, thousands of pending visa \n27  applicants were waiting to schedule their consular interviews. \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 21 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.

Many of these individuals were denied a waiver and a visa without ever having \n2  been given notice of the availability of a waiver, and without having been given the opportunity, \n3  either through a consular interview or otherwise, to demonstrate their eligibility for such a \n4  waiver.  \n5  113.  The denials of waivers and visas without providing any notice of the availability \n6  of a waiver contravenes 22 C.F.R. §§ 41.121 and 42.81, which state that when refusing the \n7  issuance of a visa, a consular officer must inform the visa applicant “whether there is, in law or \n8  regulations, a mechanism (such as a waiver) to overcome the refusal.” 22 C.F.R. § 41.121. \n9  114.  Those visa applicants who have been allowed to schedule and attend their \n10  consular interviews after the Proclamation went into effect have struggled to navigate the \n11  waiver process, hampered by the lack of information about waivers and how to demonstrate \n12  eligibility for them.  \n13  115.  When  applying  for  most  other  waivers  of  other  statutory  grounds  of \n14  inadmissibility under the INA, applicants can go to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \n15  Service (“USCIS”) website (www.uscis.gov), search for the specific type of waiver they seek, \n16  obtain the application form that is specific to that waiver, and find instructions for how to \n17  complete the application form.  \n18  116.  For all other available waivers of inadmissibility under the INA, the USCIS \n19  website also provides details about what additional documentation is necessary to support a \n20  waiver application; a mailing address to submit the completed form and any supporting \n21  documentation; information about any filing fees associated with the application; the current \n22  approximate processing time for adjudication of that specific type of waiver; and information \n23  about the specific process available for appealing the decision.  \n24  117.  Defendants  have  provided  no  such  information  or  application  forms  for \n25  individuals seeking waivers under the Proclamation. \n26  118.  Indeed, although the DOS FAQ’s advise visa applicants to “disclose during the \n27  visa interview any information that might demonstrate that he or she is eligible for a waiver,” \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 22 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.

For  many  visa  applicants  and  immigration  attorneys,  trying  to  gather \n5  information about the waiver process available under the Proclamation has been a matter of \n6  piecing together word-of-mouth anecdotes from others entangled in the same process, and \n7  attempting to extrapolate information about the process from the varying treatment of waiver \n8  cases in different postures within and across different consulates.  \n9  120.  Indeed, some immigration attorneys have struggled with whether to advise \n10  clients even to schedule and appear for an interview, given that these attorneys are aware that \n11  so few waivers have actually been granted, and given that traveling to a consulate and paying \n12  the requisite fees for an interview are costly for visa applicants. The travel itself can also be \n13  dangerous, going through conflict zones. \n14  121.  Many visa applicants who decide to incur the cost of attending a consular \n15  interview have assembled packets of information and documentation (“waiver packets”) to \n16  offer to the consular officer at their consular interview, and have prepared to answer questions \n17  during the interview, to show how they meet each of the three criteria for a waiver. Preparing a \n18  packet is time consuming and often costly, especially if the visa applicant and their family have \n19  retained an attorney to assist with the visa application and waiver process. \n20  122.  However, notwithstanding the State Department’s directive to visa applicants to \n21  “disclose during the visa interview any information that might demonstrate that he or she is \n22  eligible for a waiver,” consular officers have not necessarily allowed interviewees to make such \n23  disclosures during their consular interviews.  \n24  123.

Treatment of waiver packets has differed among consular officers and across \n4  consulates, time periods, and applicants: officers have accepted proffered waiver packets; \n5  refused proffered waiver packets; accepted some but not all documents from proffered waiver \n6  packets; or accepted verbal information but declined anything in writing. Some officers have \n7  even  berated  interviewees  for  “wasting”  their  money  on  preparing  a  packet  while \n8  simultaneously refusing to accept or look at the packet. \n9  125.  Indeed, some consular posts have begun informing immigration attorneys that \n10  there is “no role for legal services to facilitate the waiver process” and that “only U.S. \n11  government officials can author waiver requests.” \n12  126.  Similarly, consular officers’ treatment of questions of waiver eligibility during \n13  consular interviews has differed among consular officers and across consulates, time periods, \n14  and applicants: officers have conducted the interview and asked questions relating to waiver \n15  eligibility; conducted the interview and refrained from asking questions relating to waiver \n16  eligibility; conducted the interview but nevertheless gave the visa applicant a form letter \n17  denying a waiver; refused to conduct the interview on the grounds that the officer could not \n18  grant any visas under the Proclamation; or refused to conduct the interview and simply handed \n19  the visa applicant a form letter denying a waiver.  \n20  127.  Many of the individuals who were allowed to attend their consular interviews \n21  after the Proclamation went into effect were given a boilerplate letter at the end of the interview, \n22  notifying them that they had been denied a waiver and a visa. \n23  128.  The denial letters, which are usually presented in both English and the native \n24  language of the applicant, vary wildly both in the English and the translated versions, which \n25  has caused confusion. The denial notice that the U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa provided to \n26  Somalis, for example, is one sentence long and informs the visa applicant that “no pardon” can \n27  be given to her case. The denial notice provided by the U.S. Embassy in Yerevan is lengthier \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 24 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.   P.O.

Some denial forms \n2  provide information about how to reapply for a visa, while others do not. \n3  129.  The denial of waivers for individuals has caused widespread consternation and \n4  confusion because none of the communications from the consulates indicate whether a denied \n5  individual’s underlying visa petition or application has also been denied. It is unclear whether \n6  someone with an approved I-130 petition, for example, must now resubmit that petition—a \n7  process that for some individuals can take years or even decades. \n8  130.  This lack of clarity extends even to whether a waiver has been denied. Many \n9  individuals who have checked the status of their pending applications and petitions online \n10  through the U.S. Department of State Consular Electronic Application Center (“CEAC”) have \n11  observed that their case status indicated “refused,” without any indication as to what has been \n12  “refused”—their waiver or their visa application, or both—or whether they are being or have \n13  been considered for a waiver. Individuals in this situation do not know whether they can or \n14  should re-request a waiver, or when.  \n15  131.  Many individuals have also observed their CEAC case status change from \n16  “refused” to “administrative processing,” or vice versa. The significance of these changes or \n17  their frequency is unclear and individuals in this situation do not know whether they need to \n18  reapply for a waiver or their visa, whether they are being considered for a waiver, or whether \n19  their case will remain indefinitely pending in administrative processing.  Indeed, many have \n20  been waiting months in administrative processing. \n21  132.  The Defendants’ indefinite delay in deciding whether to grant or deny a waiver \n22  and visa by placing cases in administrative processing contravenes agency policy.

During the time the Proclamation and its waiver provision have been in effect, \n5  numerous individuals have been denied waivers despite presenting one or more of the exemplar \n6  circumstances that the Proclamation states may warrant a waiver.  \n7  134.  During the time the Proclamation and its waiver provision have been in effect, \n8  minor children have been unable to reunite with their parents, grandparents have missed the \n9  births and subsequent birthdays of grandchildren, siblings have been kept apart, adult children \n10  have been unable to care for their elderly parents, spouses as well as engaged couples have been \n11  forced to put their future plans on indefinite hold, and patients with medical needs have been \n12  prevented from seeking care in this country because individuals abroad have been unable to \n13  obtain waivers.  \n14  135.  During the time the Proclamation and its waiver provision have been in effect, \n15  the uncertainty caused by the waiver process has caused significant physical, financial, and \n16  emotional distress on Plaintiffs and other similarly situated individuals whose only hope for \n17  family reunification is a waiver. The stress has caused at least one husband and father, whose \n18  wife and children were refused visas under the Proclamation and were stranded in Djibouti \n19  waiting for waivers, to die by suicide.

Indeed, at the April 25, 2018 oral arguments before the Supreme Court in Trump \n2  v. Hawai’i, Justices Breyer and Sotomayor specifically asked about the waiver process and \n3  whether “it is, in fact, a real waiver process,” as opposed to mere “window dressing.” \n4  138.  The statistics that the government has made publicly available about the waiver \n5  process confirm that it is, indeed, window dressing.  \n6  139.  The February 22 letter sent to Senator Van Hollen provided the earliest and first \n7  publicly available statistics about the waiver process. See Exhibit B.  \n8  140.  On a separate page entitled, “Visa Applications Received and Processed from \n9  Nationals Subject to Presidential Proclamation 9645 (From December 8, 2017 to January 8, \n10  2018),” the February 22 letter provided the following figures: \n \n11  Applications for nonimmigrant and immigrant visas:  8,406 \nApplicants refused for reasons unrelated to the Proclamation:  1,723 \n12  Applicants qualifying for an exception:  128 \nApplicants who failed to meet the criteria for a waiver[:]  6,282 \n13  Applications refused under the Proclamation with waiver consideration:  271 \nWaivers approved (as of February 15):  2 \n14 \n141.  Based on these numbers, only 0.02% of visa applicants from banned countries \n15 \nhad been granted waivers as of February 15, 2018.  \n16 \n142.  The Reuters article that had initially made the February 22 letter public, dated \n17 \nMarch 6, 2018, provided further information. It stated that since February 15, 2018, the State \n18 \nDepartment had granted more than 100 additional waivers. \n19 \n143.  The Reuters article added, however, that it was not clear how many of those \n20 \nadditional waivers had been granted to the approximately 8,400 individuals who had sought \n21 \nwaivers in the first month the Proclamation had been in effect. \n22 \n144.  Nor did the Reuters article disclose how many thousands of additional visa \n23 \napplications had been processed and considered for waiver eligibility between February 15, \n24 \n2018 and March 6, 2018. \n25 \n26 \n27 \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 27 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.

As briefing progressed and oral argument approached in Trump v. Hawai’i, the \n2  government not only appeared to start granting waivers at a relatively faster rate, but also began \n3  publicly providing information on the numbers of waivers granted.  \n4  146.  On or around April 13, 2018, the State Department published new FAQs about \n5  the waiver process that included the statement that “[f]rom December 8, 2017 through April 1, \n6  2018, more than 430 applicants were cleared for waivers after a consular officer determined the \n7  applicants satisfied all criteria and completed all required processing.” \n8  147.  The government repeated this figure in reply briefing submitted to the Supreme \n9  Court in Trump v. Hawai’i on April 18, 2018, stating that “more than 430 individuals” had been \n10  granted waivers. In oral argument before the Supreme Court on April 25, 2018, the United \n11  States Solicitor General confirmed that 430 waivers had been granted.  \n12  148.  The June 22 letter sent to Senator Van Hollen subsequently indicated that \n13  statistics on the number of waivers granted “is updated every two weeks.” See Exhibit C.  \n14  149.  On a separate page entitled, “Visa Applications Received and Processed from \n15  Nationals Subject to Presidential Proclamation 9645 (As of April 20 unless otherwise stated),” \n16  the June 22 letter provided the following figures: \n \n17  Number of NIV and IV applications from impacted nationalities who  \n   applied for visas in the P.P. 9645 covered categories:  33,176 \n18  Number of applicants found ineligible for reasons other than those  \n   covered in P.P. 9645 (e.g. INA 214(b) so a review for eligibility under  \n19     P.P. 9645 was not required:  4,900 \nNumber of applicants who received a visa under an exception from  \n20     P.P. 9645:  1,147 \nNumber of applicants cleared for waivers:  579 (768 as of May 31) \n21  Number of applicants interviewed, but still awaiting a determination  \n   on a waiver:  4,157 \n22 \n150.

With the exception of the two letters sent to Senator Van Hollen, none of the \n4  figures that the government has provided on the number of waivers granted, including the figure \n5  updated every two weeks on the State Department website, has included information about how \n6  many  visa  applicants  have  been  denied  a  waiver,  how  many  visa  applicants  have  been \n7  considered for a waiver, or how many visa applications in total have been processed. \n8  153.  In addition, as the June 22 letter clarified, the fact that an individual has been \n9  “cleared for” a waiver does not mean that the individual has been granted a waiver or received \n10  a visa. No information is available as to how many individuals have received visas after being \n11  cleared for a waiver. \n12  154.  Beyond the available statistics, additional evidence indicates that the waiver \n13  process is merely “window dressing.” \n14  155.  For  example,  a  sworn  declaration  from  Christopher  Richardson  (the \n15  “Richardson declaration”), who had worked as the Americans Citizens Service Chief in Madrid \n16  until he resigned from the State Department in March 2018, indicates that consular officers \n17  considering visa applicants for waiver are “to determine at all possible cost that the person was \n18  not eligible to even apply for a waiver.” See Exhibit A.  \n19  156.  The Richardson declaration states that “[i]f for some reason” a consular officer \n20  “had no choice but to determine we could find an applicant eligible to apply,” the consular \n21  officer was prohibited from exercising any discretion in granting a waiver, “regardless of the \n22  [Presidential Proclamation] instructions that we had ‘discretion to grant the waiver.’” Rather, \n23  consular officers “were mandated to send to Washington that we found this applicant eligible \n24  to apply and Washington would then make the decision to grant or deny the waiver.” \n25  157.  The Richardson declaration further states that none of the “guidance cables, \n26  sample Q’s and A’s and instructions” regarding the implementation of the waiver process were \n27  actually classified, but that it is understandable why the government would not want to make \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 29 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.

Mr. Richardson further observed that “[i]n essence what the administration was \n5  doing was ‘hiding’ behind the doctrine of consular non-reviewability for the benefit of issuing \n6  a Muslim ban and the same time usurping all of our authority given by both Congress and the \n7  P[residential] P[roclamation] by disallowing the consular officer to make a decision.”  \n8  159.  The waiver process, as described by Mr. Richardson, directly contravenes 8 \n9  U.S.C. §1104(a), which states that consular officers have complete discretion over the issuance \n10  of visas and that such discretion may not be circumscribed by the Secretary of State. \n11  160.  A second consular officer has likewise stated that the material issued by the State \n12  Department regarding the waiver process “would demonstrate that the waiver process has ‘no \n13  rational basis.’” Jeremy Stahl, “The Waiver Process Is Fraud,” SLATE (June 15, 2018), \n14  https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/06/trump-travel-ban-waiver-process-is-a-sham-two-\n15  consular-officers-say.html.  \n16  161.

Plaintiff Afshin Raghebi first moved to the United States in 2006.   An Iranian \n4  national, he left Iran due to fear of persecution for his religious beliefs and is now afraid to \n5  return to Iran.  Mr. Raghebi intended to, but never applied for asylum as he was fearful that \n6  applying could eventually lead to his deportation.  In United States, he learned the trade of \n7  windows and glass installation.  He met Mrs. Raghebi in Summer 2010 after he worked on the \n8  windows at the senior living home where she worked as a receptionist.  Mr. and Mrs. Raghebi \n9  were married a few months later in December 2010.  Together, Mr. and Mrs. Raghebi started a \n10  glass and window installation business.  Mrs. Raghebi handled the accounting, while Mr. \n11  Raghebi was the primary glass installer at the company. \n12  165.  In January 2016, Mrs. Raghebi filed for an I-130 Petition to start the green card \n13  process for Mr. Raghebi. They were approved for their I-130 Petition in April 2016, meaning \n14  that USCIS had found that they had a bona fide relationship.  Because Mr. Raghebi had been \n15  living in the U.S. undocumented, he had to file for an I-601A waiver of the ‘unlawful presence’ \n16  grounds of inadmissibility.  To qualify for an I-601A waiver, Plaintiffs Mr. and Mrs. Raghebi \n17  had to show that Mrs. Raghebi would suffer “extreme hardship” if her husband was not granted \n18  permanent residency.  Mrs. Raghebi was able to make this showing, in part due to her health.  \n19  USCIS found that Mrs. Raghebi made this showing of “extreme hardship,” and approved an I-\n20  601A waiver for Mr. Raghebi in February 2017. \n21  166.  Upon the approval of the 1-601A waiver, Mr. Raghebi left the United States on \n22  March 12, 2018 as the I-601A waiver required him to leave the United States to be able to \n23  complete the I-130 petition process.  However, Mr. Raghebi, despite having been granted the \n24  I-601A waiver, has not been able to return to the United States due to the Proclamation.  When \n25  Mr. Raghebi left the United States, he believed that he would be able to return under the waiver \n26  process outlined in the Proclamation. \n27 \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 31 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.

In March 2018, Mr. Raghebi had his green card interview with the U.S. embassy \n2  in Abu Dhabi.  At that time, Mr. Raghebi attempted to present materials to demonstrate that his \n3  qualifications for a waiver of the travel ban.  The consular officer did not ask to see these \n4  materials and did not ask Mr. Raghebi any questions related to his eligibility for a waiver.  Mr. \n5  Raghebi was told he would learn whether he can return to the United States in two to three \n6  months.  However, more than four months since his consular interview, Mr. Raghebi still has \n7  not received a determination on whether he will be granted a waiver under the Proclamation. \n8  168.  Mr. Raghebi is currently living in Turkey, as it one of the few countries that does \n9  not require a visa for Iranian nationals.  He is afraid to return to Iran, and wants to return to the \n10  United States to be with his wife of over seven years. \n11  169.  The separation of these spouses has been emotionally devastating for each of \n12  them. They speak every day by telephone, and Mrs. Raghebi has traveled to Turkey to see her \n13  husband.  Mrs. Raghebi suffers from a residual health condition that resulted from a severe bout \n14  of shingles, which causes her much pain, and the pain has been exacerbated by the stress caused \n15  by the separation from her husband.  Mrs. Raghebi now takes anti-depressants to help her cope \n16  with the emotional toll of the separation.  The separation has also caused financial hardship to \n17  the Raghebis, who own a window and glass installation business.  Without Mr. Raghebi, who \n18  had performed much of the work of the business, the business’s revenues are at one third of \n19  what they were when Mr. Raghebi was here in the United States.  Without a waiver, these \n20  spouses of over seven years cannot be together, they suffer emotionally without each other, and \n21  the business they own together has significantly declined. \n22  170.  Plaintiff Zeinab Mohamed Hassan, a U.S. citizen, has suffered and will \n23  continue to suffer harm because of the Proclamation and the waiver process. Her two daughters \n24  are Somali refugees living in Kenya, and in 2013, when her daughters were both 18 years old, \n25  she submitted I-130 visa petitions to bring them to the safety of the United States.  \n26  171.  After their petitions were approved and their cases transferred from the National \n27  Visa Center to the United States Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, Plaintiff Hassan’s daughters \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 32 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.

Because \n2  these  interviews  took  place  before  the  Proclamation  went  into  effect, Plaintiff Hassan’s \n3  daughters received no opportunity to present evidence of their eligibility for a waiver, much \n4  less notice that a waiver was even required for their entry to the United States. Their cases were \n5  subsequently put into administrative processing but they received no updates on their case for \n6  several months. \n7  172.  In April 2018, an immigration attorney Plaintiff Hassan had retained explicitly \n8  requested that the Embassy consider Plaintiff Hassan’s daughters for a waiver under the \n9  Proclamation.  The  Embassy  responded  that  “[u]ntil  the  consular  officer  makes  an \n10  individualized determination on these three factors, these applications will remain refused under \n11  Section 212(f).” After further pressure from the attorney, the Embassy stated that a consular \n12  officer was “currently reviewing their eligibility for a waiver” but that the Embassy could not \n13  provide any further information “until this process is completed.” \n14  173.  Plaintiff Hassan is devastated that the waiver process is prolonging the already \n15  protracted process of bringing her daughters to be with her in the United States. She has not \n16  seen them since 2016, and although she talks to them every night on the phone, she fears \n17  constantly for their safety and physical well-being because they are young, foreign-born women \n18  without a guardian in Kenya, where the government refuses to give Somali refugees the same \n19  protection as Kenyan nationals. Plaintiff Hassan’s daughters are vulnerable either to being \n20  kidnapped and forced into marriage and/or raped by gangs, which operate with impunity \n21  throughout Kenya, or to being exploited by corrupt government officials seeking bribes from \n22  Somali refugees who fear being detained and removed to Somalia. \n23  174.  Indeed, every time Plaintiff Hassan’s daughters leave their apartment to buy \n24  food, they are accosted by police and must pay a bribe. Plaintiff Hassan constantly worries that \n25  the money she sends them each month is not enough to pay for their rent, food, and bribes. She \n26  fears that her daughters are not getting enough to eat and may be malnourished. But Plaintiff \n27 \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 33 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.

Returning to Somalia, however, is not a realistic option for Plaintiff Hassan’s \n4  daughters; the country is politically unstable and the al-Qaeda-aligned terrorist group al-\n5  Shabaab, which continues to battle the UN-backed government in Somalia, considers Somali \n6  refugees returned from Kenya to be spies for the Kenyan security forces. If her daughters are \n7  deported to Somalia, Plaintiff Hassan is certain that they will be assaulted and possibly killed. \n8  Every day that her daughters remain in limbo in the waiver process, Plaintiff Hassan worries \n9  that something terrible will happen to them before she can reunite with them in the United \n10  States. \n11  176.  Plaintiff Siraji Etha Siraji, a U.S. citizen, has suffered and will continue to \n12  suffer harm because of the Proclamation and the waiver process. His wife, a refugee displaced \n13  from her home country of Somalia for over a decade, is pregnant and currently living in Kenya \n14  with their other three young children. Plaintiff Siraji filed an I-130 petition for his wife in 2013, \n15  as well as Consular Reports of Birth Abroad (“CRBAs”) to obtain United States passports for \n16  his children. \n17  177.  After Plaintiff Siraji’s I-130 petition for his wife was approved in 2014, she \n18  appeared for her consular interview at the United States Embassy in Kenya in February 2015. \n19  The consular officer told her that her visa application was complete, but that it would be held \n20  until the children’s CRBAs were approved. However, it took almost two years longer, the \n21  retention of an immigration attorney, and countless back-and-forth communications with the \n22  U.S. Embassies in both Kenya and Uganda, where the children had been born, before the \n23  Embassy in Uganda approved their CRBAs. The Embassy in Kenya then took almost another \n24  year making various requests that Plaintiff Siraji’s wife update her medical reports, her DS-260 \n25  Immigrant Visa Electronic Application, and other paperwork. \n26  178.  On December 14, 2017, Plaintiff Siraji’s wife appeared at the Embassy in Kenya \n27  to swear that her DS-260 was correct. At that appointment, she was told that she would need a \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 34 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.   P.O.

Although she asked if she could submit more information, she \n2  was told that the Embassy would contact her if any further information from her was needed. \n3  Plaintiff Siraji and his wife subsequently heard nothing until their attorney wrote the Embassy \n4  in Kenya for an update in April 2018. On April 19, 2018, the Embassy reported that the visa \n5  for Plaintiff Siraji’s wife was “pending mandatory administrative process” and that “[t]he \n6  consular officer is currently reviewing her eligibility for a waiver.” \n7  179.  The separation from his wife and children has taken an emotional and financial \n8  toll on Plaintiff Siraji. Because his wife is a Somali refugee, she is constantly at risk of being \n9  arrested by Kenyan authorities and deported with the children to Somalia, where their lives \n10  would be at risk. The country is politically unstable, as al-Shabaab vies for control of the \n11  government, and much of the country is a conflict zone where kidnapping, assault, and murder \n12  are rampant. But remaining in Kenya is dangerous, because as Somali refugees, individuals like \n13  Plaintiff Siraji’s family do not have the full protection of the government and have no legal \n14  guarantee that they can remain in Kenya indefinitely. This exposes them to corruption and abuse \n15  from exploitative government officials. Plaintiff Siraji worries constantly about the safety and \n16  well-being of his family. Because Plaintiff Siraji’s wife cannot work in Kenya, Plaintiff Siraji \n17  must send money to support her and their children, which is a constant and significant drain on \n18  Plaintiff Siraji’s resources. \n19  180.  Plaintiff Siraji is desperate to bring his family to the United States so that they \n20  can be together in a place where his wife and children do not have to live in constant fear of \n21  being kidnapped, or becoming the victim of a criminal assault or terrorist act. He is frustrated \n22  that the waiver process is prolonging what was already a protracted process—and now the \n23  consulate will not even allow her to submit information about why she deserves a waiver. He \n24  does not understand how the consulate can sincerely consider for her a waiver when they have \n25  asked nothing about why she meets the eligibility criteria. And in the meantime, the waiver \n26  process continues to prevent his reunification with his family. \n27 \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 35 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.   P.O.

Plaintiff Malayeen Ahmed, a U.S. citizen, has suffered and will continue to \n2  suffer harm because of the Proclamation and the waiver process. She has an approved I-130 \n3  petition for her father, who has survived airstrikes on his home in Yemen, and wishes to bring \n4  him to the safety of the United States. \n5  182.  After two years of processing, Plaintiff Ahmed’s father interviewed with the \n6  U.S.  consulate  in  Djibouti  in  July  2017.    Because  this  interview  took  place  before  the \n7  Proclamation went into effect, Plaintiff Ahmed and her father had no opportunity to present \n8  evidence of his eligibility for a waiver. Plaintiff Ahmed’s father has remained in Djibouti since \n9  his interview because it is too dangerous for him to return to Yemen, where his hometown \n10  continues to be shelled. \n11  183.  On January 17, 2018, Plaintiff Ahmed’s father received a letter from the U.S. \n12  embassy  in  Djibouti  stating  that  he  was  ineligible  for  a  visa  pursuant  to  Presidential \n13  Proclamation 9645 and denied him a waiver.  Plaintiff Ahmed and her family were devastated.  \n14  They have spent over $20,000 paying for fees, her father’s travel expenses to get to Djibouti, \n15  and his living costs in Djibouti. \n16  184.  Further  communications  with  the  consulate  have  only  confused  them.  As \n17  recently as July 2018, the State Department indicated online that the visa application for \n18  Plaintiff Ahmad’s father was actually pending in “administrative processing.” That same \n19  month, the U.S. embassy in Djibouti sent plaintiff an “updated refusal letter” indicating that “a \n20  waiver is being reconsidered” in their case. But in the meantime, Plaintiff Ahmed received no \n21  information or instructions about how to request a waiver for her father. Plaintiff Ahmed \n22  emailed the consulate in late July documenting why her father’s case merits a waiver. However, \n23  they did not receive any confirmation or further communication from the U.S. embassy  in \n24  Djibouti. \n25  185.  The separation from her father has been physically, emotionally, and financially \n26  stressful for both Plaintiff Ahmed and her father. Although they speak every week on the phone, \n27  Plaintiff Ahmed’s father has missed the births of all three of her children, which has been \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 36 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.

She wept at the birth of her first son, born in June 2018 after \n2  two daughters, because her father could not be there to hold his first grandson. In addition, \n3  supporting her father in Djibouti has been a strain on the family’s resources. Plaintiff Ahmed’s \n4  husband often works 80 hours a week and overtime to support their family and to be able to \n5  send money to her father. Every day that her father’s visa application remains on hold because \n6  of the waiver process exacts a financial and emotional cost on Plaintiff Ahmed and her family. \n7  186.  Plaintiff Reza Azimi, a U.S. citizen, has suffered and will continue to suffer \n8  harm because of the Proclamation and the waiver process. After Plaintiff Azimi’s wife became \n9  pregnant with their first child, Plaintiff Azimi hoped his mother and father, both citizens of Iran, \n10  would be granted tourist visas, so that they could come to the United States for the birth of \n11  Plaintiff Azimi’s first child and provide temporary care for his wife and newborn baby. \n12  187.  In 2015, two years before Plaintiff Azimi’s wife became pregnant, his mother \n13  and father had both applied for tourist visas and interviewed at the U.S. Consulate in Dubai, \n14  United Arab Emirates. Because this interview took place years before the Proclamation went \n15  into effect, Plaintiff Azimi’s parents had no opportunity to present evidence of their eligibility \n16  for a waiver. Following the interview, Plaintiff Azimi’s mother was granted a visa and later \n17  traveled to the United States to visit Plaintiff Azimi and his wife. His father’s application, \n18  however, was placed in administrative processing, preventing him from making the trip to the \n19  United States with Plaintiff Azimi’s mother. \n20  188.  After learning of the impending birth of her new grandchild in 2017, Plaintiff \n21  Azimi’s mother applied for another tourist visa in July 2017 to visit Plaintiff Azimi in the United \n22  States. She was granted an interview at the U.S. Consulate in Dubai in September 2017. \n23  Because her interview took place before the Proclamation went into effect, Plaintiff Azimi’s \n24  mother had no opportunity to present evidence of her eligibility for a waiver, and indeed no \n25  notice of any waiver requirement. On January 3, 2018, however, Plaintiff Azimi’s mother \n26  received a letter from the Nonimmigrant Visa Unit at the U.S. Consulate in Dubai informing \n27  her she had been found ineligible for a visa pursuant to Presidential Proclamation 9645 and that \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 37 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.

A subsequent letter from the Embassy dated January 10, 2018 \n2  further explained that Plaintiff Azimi’s mother’s visa had initially been approved and was in \n3  administrative processing when the Embassy reversed its decision because of the Presidential \n4  Proclamation. The January 10 letter also stated she would not receive a waiver but was allowed \n5  to reapply for a visa. \n6  189.  On February 19, 2018, after his 2015 visa application had been in administrative \n7  processing for over two years, Plaintiff Azimi’s father received a letter similar to the January 3 \n8  letter sent to Plaintiff Azimi’s mother. The letter stated Plaintiff Azimi’s father was ineligible \n9  for a visa under the Presidential Proclamation and denied a waiver. Plaintiff Azimi’s father was \n10  never given the opportunity to submit information in support of a waiver. \n11  190.  Plaintiff Azimi had hoped his parents would receive visas in time to see the birth \n12  of his first child and their first grandchild. In December 2017, however, while his parents were \n13  awaiting a decision on their visas, his wife gave birth. Plaintiff Azimi’s parents are heartbroken \n14  they could not share that experience with Plaintiff Azimi and his wife, and now do not know if \n15  or when they will be able to see their grandchild.  \n16  191.  The separation from his parents has been difficult for Plaintiff Azimi and his \n17  wife. They have no other family in Michigan, and Plaintiff Azimi’s job often requires him to \n18  work long hours. As first-time parents, Plaintiff Azimi and his wife were depending on Plaintiff \n19  Azimi’s mother and father to assist them during the critical first months of their child’s life. \n20  Now Plaintiff Azimi and his wife do not know if his parents will ever be able to come and \n21  provide support during the time in their child’s life when they most need it. Plaintiff Azimi’s \n22  wife worries that without any familial support, she will not be able to return to work. The \n23  situation has left Plaintiff and his wife anxious and grief-stricken. Without a waiver, Plaintiff \n24  Azimi’s parents are prevented from helping his young family. Moreover, they are missing—\n25  and will never be able to reclaim—all the precious early moments of their grandchild’s life. \n26  192.  Plaintiff Yahya Ghaleb, a U.S. citizen, has suffered and will continue to suffer \n27  harm because of the Proclamation and the waiver process.

As the civil war in Yemen has intensified and his mother-in-\n3  law’s health has declined, Plaintiff Ghaleb began to worry about his son’s safety and made \n4  plans to bring him to live with him in Michigan. \n5  193.  Plaintiff Ghaleb’s son was granted an interview at the U.S. Embassy in Djibouti \n6  on December 11, 2017. Although Plaintiff Ghaleb travelled from Michigan to meet his son in \n7  Djibouti and attended the interview with him, Plaintiff Ghaleb’s son made the twenty-hour trip \n8  from Yemen to Djibouti alone. During the interview, the consular officers did not tell Plaintiff \n9  Ghaleb or his son about the availability of a waiver and made no inquiry into Plaintiff Ghaleb’s \n10  son’s eligibility for a waiver. As a result, neither Plaintiff Ghaleb nor his son presented evidence \n11  that might support the issuance of a waiver, as they were unaware of any such requirement for \n12  a waiver. At the interview’s conclusion, a consular officer verbally informed and gave Plaintiff \n13  Ghaleb a letter stating that his son’s visa application had been approved and that he now only \n14  had to wait for the visa to be processed and printed. \n15  194.  On December 19, 2017, however, only a little more than a week after they \n16  received notice that his son’s visa had been approved, Plaintiff Ghaleb received a second letter \n17  from the Embassy, stating that a consular officer had found his son ineligible for a visa pursuant \n18  to the Proclamation. The letter also stated a waiver would not be granted for his son. \n19  195.  Subsequently, in July 2018, after months of believing his son had no opportunity \n20  to be granted a waiver, Plaintiff Ghaleb received yet another letter from the Embassy. This letter \n21  informed Plaintiff Ghaleb that the Embassy had again reversed its decision and was now \n22  reviewing his son’s eligibility for a waiver, but that doing so could be a lengthy process. Online, \n23  the status of the visa petition for Plaintiff Ghaleb’s son was changed to “administrative \n24  processing.” \n25  196.  The denial of Plaintiff Ghaleb’s son’s waiver and the Embassy’s shifting and \n26  contradictory decisions about his son’s visa application has caused Plaintiff Ghaleb significant \n27  stress and uncertainty. Plaintiff Ghaleb is overcome with anxiety and constantly worries about \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 39 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.   P.O.

The village where his son stays has faced missile strikes, not far from \n2  the neighborhood where his son and his mother-in-law live. Plaintiff Ghaleb’s mother-in-law \n3  calls him frequently, worried her grandson will be killed if he remains in Yemen.  \n4  197.  Plaintiff Ghaleb has had difficulty concentrating and sleeping, as he imagines \n5  his son stranded in a dangerous part of a war-torn country, thousands of miles from his only \n6  parent. Because of the cost and time required to travel to Yemen, Plaintiff Ghaleb’s contact \n7  with his son has been infrequent. He has missed spending birthdays and holidays with his son \n8  and has been unable to provide him with the parental support and instruction he needs. The \n9  waiver process is now prolonging Plaintiff Ghaleb’s separation from his son and he is afraid \n10  something will happen to his son before he is able to come to the safety of the United States. \n11  198.  Plaintiff Mitra Hannani, a national of Iran, has suffered and will continue to \n12  suffer harm because of the Proclamation and the waiver process. Plaintiff Hannani is the \n13  beneficiary of an approved I-130 petition filed by her mother, a U.S. citizen who resides in \n14  Virginia. Plaintiff Hannani’s parents and siblings are all U.S. citizens and her only son, 24 years \n15  old, is a lawful permanent resident pursuing a graduate degree in podiatric medicine. Plaintiff \n16  Mitra Hannani wishes to emigrate to the United States with her husband and seventeen-year-\n17  old daughter so they can reunite with the rest of their family. \n18  199.  After her mother’s I-130 visa petition for her was approved, Plaintiff Hannani \n19  and her family appeared for their consular interview at the United States Consulate in Abu \n20  Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, in February 2017. Because their interview occurred before the \n21  Proclamation into effect, they had no opportunity to present evidence of their eligibility for a \n22  waiver, to say nothing of notice that providing such evidence might be necessary.  \n23  200.  Having heard nothing for months from the consulate regarding the status of her \n24  visa application, Plaintiff Hannani e-mailed the consulate in Abu Dhabi in May 2018 to request \n25  a waiver for herself and her family and attached a waiver packet outlining her and her family’s \n26  qualifications for a waiver. Approximately one month after sending this request, Plaintiff \n27  Hannani received an email from the consulate, via her mother’s immigration attorney, with a \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 40 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.   P.O.

Plaintiff Hannani has not otherwise received any affirmative communication \n6  from the consulate about the status of her family’s visa applications or the waiver request she \n7  made in May 2018. For most of 2017 and 2018, the DOS website indicated that she and her \n8  husband were in “administrative processing,” but that their seventeen-year-old daughter’s case \n9  was  “refused.”  In  late  July  2018,  their  daughter’s  status  changed  from  “refused”  to \n10  “administrative processing,” but it remains unclear how long Plaintiff Hannani, her husband, \n11  and her daughter must wait before they receive a decision on their waivers and visa applications. \n12  202.  Plaintiff Hannani is perplexed as to why her family’s eligibility for a waiver is \n13  taking so long to process because they had previously been admitted to the United States in \n14  2011 on non-immigrant visas. During a three-week trip, they visited their family and respected \n15  and observed all laws and immigration requirements of the United States. \n16  203.  The separation from her family, which the waiver process is prolonging, is \n17  physically painful and emotionally distressing for Plaintiff Hannani. She has always had a deep \n18  connection with her twin sister and views her younger brother like a second son because she \n19  cared for him after their parents emigrated to the United States. She now sees them only rarely \n20  and being separated from her sister and family causes her grief, stress, and anxiety. Plaintiff \n21  Hannani is also concerned about the health of her parents, who are now in their 70s and 80s. \n22  When she speaks with them over the phone, it is apparent how much they have aged even in \n23  the last few years. Plaintiff Hannani is distressed that her parents may pass away before they \n24  are able to reunite and be together. If admitted to the United States, Plaintiff Hannani would be \n25  able to care for her parents in their old age. \n26  204.  Plaintiff Hannani’s separation from her son is even more painful for her. He \n27  came to the United States seven years ago, when he was seventeen, to pursue his education, and \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 41 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.   P.O.

As a result, Plaintiff \n2  Hannani has missed her son’s maturation from a teenager into a young man, and she and her \n3  husband and daughter were not able to be present when he graduated from university and earned \n4  his Bachelor’s degree. Plaintiff Hannani is now afraid that she will not be able to attend his \n5  graduation from medical school and will miss this important milestone in his life. Although \n6  Plaintiff Hannani speaks to her son on a regular basis via phone and on-line communication \n7  apps like WhatsApp, she knows that her son, like she and her husband, is depressed due to their \n8  separation. Plaintiff Hannani and her husband do their best to hide their anxiety and depression \n9  at being separated from their son when they speak with him, but it has become increasingly \n10  difficult to do so. \n11  205.  Plaintiff Nicolas Hanout, a Lawful Permanent Resident, has suffered and will \n12  continue to suffer harm because of the Proclamation and the waiver process. Three years ago, \n13  he married his wife, a Syrian national, and subsequently filed an I-130 immigrant visa petition \n14  on her behalf in 2016. \n15  206.  After Plaintiff Hanout’s I-130 petition for his wife was approved, she appeared \n16  for her consular interview at the United States Embassy in Jordan in April 2018. The consular \n17  interview only lasted ten to fifteen minutes, during which time the consular officer told her that \n18  she was eligible for a waiver from the Proclamation and asked her to provide answers to \n19  questions substantially similar to those on Form DS-5535, Supplemental Questions for Visa \n20  Applicants. After she promptly provided answers to the questions, Plaintiff Hanout placed a \n21  follow-up call to the Embassy to ask whether he needed to do anything else for his wife’s visa \n22  application. He was told to wait for the Embassy to call him.  \n23  207.  The separation from his wife has placed great emotional and financial strain on \n24  Plaintiff Hanout. It pains him that he has missed birthdays and wedding anniversaries with his \n25  wife. Although they would like to start a family together, they do not know when this will even \n26  be  possible  because  there  is  no  certainty  as  to  when  and  where  they  will  be  together \n27  permanently.  \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 42 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.   P.O. BOX 91302 \nSEATTLE, WA 98111-9402 \n206.223.7000  FAX: 206.223.7107 \n \n\n \n  Case 2:18-cv-01122-BHS   Document 1   Filed 07/31/18   Page 43 of 68\n \n1  208.  Because his wife cannot come to the United States to be with him, Plaintiff \n2  Hanout tries to visit her as much as he can to keep their relationship healthy, even though this \n3  is no real substitute for being together in the same place and being able to plan their life together. \n4  But traveling to Al Mouzeina, Syria is expensive and dangerous; every trip requires four days \n5  of round-trip travel and thousands of dollars for transport, and all entry points to Syria are \n6  through or near conflict zones, where international travelers are vulnerable to attack, extortion, \n7  harassment, and detainment. As a result, Plaintiff Hanout is self-employed as a care giver, and \n8  has had to postpone his graduate studies and pass up professional opportunities, to maintain the \n9  necessary level of flexibility and income that will allow him to see his wife for more than just \n10  a couple weeks out of the year. Indeed, both he and his wife have had to postpone their Master’s \n11  degrees in computer science because of their uncertainty about their future together. Because \n12  he spends all his available time and savings traveling to visit his wife, he has been unable to \n13  save to buy a home for the family he and his wife wish to have.  \n14  209.  Not being able to live with his wife and start a family together is excruciating \n15  for Plaintiff Hanout. He is concerned about his wife’s well-being because their separation has \n16  caused her to suffer from depression. Their constant worry about their future plans makes it \n17  impossible for them to talk about normal, everyday things in the course of their daily lives \n18  because their indefinite separation always intrudes on their thoughts and conversations. The \n19  waiver process is now prolonging Plaintiff Hanout’s separation from his wife and he is afraid \n20  they will never be allowed to live together in the United States.  \n21  210.  Plaintiff Hossein Zamani Hosseinabadi, an Iranian national lawfully present \n22  in the United States pursuing an electrical engineering Ph.D. on an F-1 student visa, has suffered \n23  and will continue to suffer harm because of the Proclamation and the waiver process. As a result \n24  of the waiver process, his father-in-law, brother, sister-in-law, and mother have been prevented \n25  or discouraged from coming to the United States. Because Plaintiff Zamani Hosseinabadi \n26  himself is present in the United States on a student visa, he fears that if he ever attempts to visit \n27  his family in Iran, he will not be allowed to reenter the United States. \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 43 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.   P.O. BOX 91302 \nSEATTLE, WA 98111-9402 \n206.223.7000  FAX: 206.223.7107 \n \n\n \n  Case 2:18-cv-01122-BHS   Document 1   Filed 07/31/18   Page 44 of 68\n \n1  211.  When he learned that his wife, who is also pursuing a doctoral degree on an F-1 \n2  visa, was pregnant with their first child, Plaintiff Zamani Hosseinabadi worked with his wife’s \n3  parents to apply for tourist visas so they could come to the United States for the birth of their \n4  first grandchild and to provide temporary help Plaintiff Zamani Hosseinabadi, his wife, and \n5  their newborn. Plaintiff Zamani Hosseinabadi’s parents-in-law interviewed at the U.S. Embassy \n6  in Dubai on October 12, 2017. \n7  212.  Because this interview took place before the Proclamation went into effect, \n8  Plaintiff Zamani Hosseinabadi’s parents-in-law had no opportunity to present evidence of their \n9  eligibility for a waiver, or were even aware of the requirement of a waiver. A visa for Plaintiff \n10  Zamani Hosseinabadi’s mother-in-law was approved shortly after her interview. Months later, \n11  she visited Plaintiff Zamani Hosseinabadi, his wife, and child in the United States before \n12  returning to Iran.  \n13  213.  The  visa  application  for  Plaintiff  Zamani  Hosseinabadi’s  father-in-law, \n14  however, was placed in administrative processing. Subsequently, in January 2018, Plaintiff \n15  Zamani Hosseinabadi’s father-in-law received a letter informing him that he had been found \n16  ineligible for a visa pursuant to the Proclamation and that he would not be granted a waiver. \n17  While the Embassy’s letter states that Plaintiff Zamani Hosseinabadi’s father-in-law may \n18  resubmit a visa application, he is skeptical a visa or waiver would be granted in his case and is \n19  reluctant to reapply because he cannot afford the cost of attending interviews in Dubai. \n20  214.  Plaintiff Zamani Hosseinabadi was also relying on his brother and sister-in-law \n21  to assist with caring for his child. After being selected for a visa through the diversity visa \n22  lottery program, Plaintiff Zamani Hosseinabadi’s brother interviewed at the U.S. Embassy in \n23  Abu  Dhabi  in  March  2018.  Although  Plaintiff  Zamani  Hosseinabadi  had  prepared \n24  documentation about himself and his child in the United States for his brother to bring to his \n25  consular interview, officials at the Embassy informed his brother even before the interview \n26  occurred, as well as at the interview itself, that he would not be granted a visa because of the \n27  Proclamation and would not be granted a waiver.  \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 44 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.   P.O. BOX 91302 \nSEATTLE, WA 98111-9402 \n206.223.7000  FAX: 206.223.7107 \n \n\n \n  Case 2:18-cv-01122-BHS   Document 1   Filed 07/31/18   Page 45 of 68\n \n1  215.  Because of the experiences his brother and father-in-law have had with the \n2  waiver process, Plaintiff Zamani Hosseinabadi has delayed applying for a tourist visa for his \n3  own mother, who he hoped would be able to meet and help care for his newborn child. Like his \n4  father-in-law, Plaintiff Zamani Hosseinabadi’s mother is of modest means and cannot afford to \n5  travel to Dubai for interviews given the uncertainty created by the waiver process. \n6  216.  Plaintiff  Zamani  Hosseinabadi’s  father-in-law,  brother,  sister-in-law,  and \n7  mother now worry they will never be able to meet Plaintiff Zamani Hosseinabadi’s new child. \n8  The separation from their family has been incredibly difficult for Plaintiff Zamani Hosseinabadi \n9  and his wife. Because the couple cannot afford to pay for childcare, they had planned to rely on \n10  Plaintiff Zamani Hosseinabadi’s family to provide additional care for their child in those early \n11  months, as well as emotional support. Without Plaintiff Zamani Hosseinabadi’s family’s help, \n12  the couple has had difficulty balancing their roles as new parents with the obligations of their \n13  doctoral studies. The couple worries that if one of them were to take a leave of absence from \n14  their doctoral studies to care for their child, they would jeopardize their visa status. \n15  217.  Because their family members cannot come to the United States to visit them, \n16  Plaintiff Zamani Hosseinabadi and his wife would like to travel to Iran so that their family can \n17  meet their new child. But because both Plaintiff Zamani Hosseinabadi and his wife are in the \n18  U.S. on single-entry student visas, they fear that they will be denied a new visa and reentry to \n19  the U.S. upon attempting to return, stalling and perhaps ending their doctoral studies. This has \n20  taken a considerable emotional toll on Plaintiff Zamani Hosseinabadi and his wife, as both \n21  worry that given the waiver process, they will need to wait another four to five years until their \n22  parents can see their grandchild. \n23  218.  Plaintiff Hoda Mehrabi Mohammadabadi, a national of Iran, has suffered and \n24  will continue to suffer harm because of the Proclamation and the waiver process. She has \n25  applied for an EB-5 investor visa and has made a $500,000 investment in the United States, \n26  primarily with funds irrevocably gifted by her parents in lieu future inheritance, which she will \n27  never be able to recover without a waiver and a visa. \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 45 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.   P.O. BOX 91302 \nSEATTLE, WA 98111-9402 \n206.223.7000  FAX: 206.223.7107 \n \n\n \n  Case 2:18-cv-01122-BHS   Document 1   Filed 07/31/18   Page 46 of 68\n \n1  219.  Under the EB-5 program, EB-5 investors must invest in a new commercial \n2  enterprise  that  will  create  full-time  positions  for  at  least  10  qualifying  employees.  An \n3  investment of at least $500,000 is required when a prospective investor is investing in a \n4  “Targeted Employment Area” that is either a high-unemployment or rural area. Using most of \n5  an irrevocable gift from her parents, Plaintiff Mohammadabadi has invested $500,000 in a \n6  Kimpton Hotel project in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which is part of the Metropolitan Milwaukee \n7  Association of Commerce Regional Center, an organization designated by USCIS to sponsor \n8  capital investment projects for investment by EB-5 investors. Plaintiff Mohammadabadi’s \n9  investment has been used to create jobs in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and to develop a new \n10  Kimpton Hotel that will support tourism and businesses in the area for decades to come. \n11  220.  Plaintiff Mohammadabadi chose to use her parents’ irrevocable gift to apply for \n12  an EB-5 investor visa because it was the fastest way for her to obtain a visa and emigrate to the \n13  United States to pursue an architecture career, which has been difficult for her to do as a woman \n14  in Iran, and to reunite with her sister, who is an asylum applicant and her closest relative. The \n15  two women are separated by age by just a year and were deeply interdependent as they grew \n16  up. When her sister emigrated to the United States, Plaintiff Mohammadabadi followed to be \n17  near her sister and pursue her Master of Architecture degree. She was unable to finish the \n18  required thesis and was forced to return to Iran in 2013 so she would not violate her student \n19  visa, but Plaintiff Mohammadabadi realized that her long-term professional prospects in Iran \n20  were limited, that she had fallen in love with the United States, and that she wanted to be close \n21  to her sister on a permanent basis.  \n22  221.  Plaintiff Mohammadabadi’s parents subsequently decided to distribute their life \n23  savings to their daughters, which amounted to just over $500,000 each, telling their daughters \n24  that the only way they could guarantee that the inheritance went to their daughters, and be able \n25  to see their daughters make use of it, was by giving it to them before they passed away. Plaintiff \n26  Mohammadabadi decided to use most of her parents’ irrevocable gift to pursue an EB-5 visa so \n27  she could come to the United States as quickly as possible to reunite with her sister, finish her \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 46 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.

At  the  moment,  Plaintiff \n2  Mohammadabadi’s sister cannot file an I-130 petition for her because her asylum case has been \n3  pending for more than two years. Although her sister could file such a petition after becoming \n4  a citizen, the process would take over 25 years due to the wait time for sibling petitions.  \n5  222.  Plaintiff Mohammadabadi’s I-526 Immigrant Petition for Alien Entrepreneur \n6  was approved in less than two years in June 2016, and she appeared for her consular interview \n7  at the United States Embassy in Yerevan, Armenia, in February 2017. Because this interview \n8  occurred before the Proclamation went into effect, she had no notice that a waiver might be \n9  required and no opportunity to present evidence of her eligibility for a waiver. Nevertheless, \n10  less than a week after the Proclamation went into effect, on December 14, 2018, the embassy \n11  in Yerevan issued Plaintiff Mohammadabadi a Waiver Refusal Worksheet stating that she had \n12  been found ineligible for a visa under the Proclamation—one of hundreds, if not thousands of \n13  perfunctory denials issued after the Proclamation took effect. She was not given an opportunity \n14  to request a waiver under the Proclamation and has heard nothing from the embassy ever since.  \n15  223.  Because  Plaintiff  Mohammadabadi’s  priority  date  for  her  approved  I-526 \n16  petition  is  current  under  the  State  Department’s  Visa  Bulletin,  which  summarizes  the \n17  availability of immigrant visas each month, she would be immediately eligible for an EB-5 \n18  investor visa if it were not for her waiver denial under the Proclamation. \n19  224.  The denial of a waiver has been devastating to Plaintiff Mohammadabadi. Her \n20  $500,000 investment, which represents most of her gifted inheritance from her parents and the \n21  majority of her wealth in the world, is at risk. Because she would never be able to recover that \n22  amount of money in Iran as a woman, Plaintiff Mohammadbabadi would never again be able \n23  to make such an investment again if she were to lose it.  \n24  225.  Because her waiver has been denied, Plaintiff Mohammadabadi is also at risk of \n25  losing her Master’s degree, which she must complete soon by completing her thesis and \n26  defending it in person at the University of Hartford. Because EB-5 visas are typically granted \n27  within two years and she was advised that it would be unlikely for her to be granted another \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 47 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.

But she has now been denied a waiver, and if she is not \n3  granted re-entry to the United States to complete her thesis, she will lose the credits she had \n4  accumulated and all her studies will have been for nothing.  \n5  226.  Plaintiff Mohammadabadi also despairs of ever being able to reunite with her \n6  sister. Because of the degrading relations between the United States and Iran and her sister’s \n7  pending asylum application, it is impossible for Plaintiff Mohammadabadi’s sister to return to \n8  Iran safely to visit her even briefly, and although they talk to each other almost every day, it is \n9  not the same as being together in the same place. When Plaintiff Mohammadabadi’s I-526 \n10  petition was approved, the two sisters rejoiced at the prospect of reuniting in the United States. \n11  That prospect is now indefinitely on hold, if not extinguished, because of the waiver process. \n12  227.  Plaintiff Maral Tabrizi, a Lawful Permanent Resident, has suffered and will \n13  continue to suffer harm because of the Proclamation and the waiver process. After Plaintiff \n14  Tabrizi told her mother and father she was pregnant with her first child, they applied for tourist \n15  visas, hoping to help Plaintiff Tabrizi and her husband care for her newborn child after her \n16  January 2018 delivery date. \n17  228.  In October 2017, Plaintiff Tabrizi’s parents were granted visa interviews at the \n18  U.S. Consulate in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Shortly after her interview, Plaintiff Tabrizi’s \n19  mother learned her visa had been approved but decided to delay picking up her visa until the \n20  Consulate  had  approved  Plaintiff  Tabrizi’s  father’s  visa,  allowing  them  to  travel  to  the \n21  Consulate in Dubai together. Because their interviews took place before the Proclamation went \n22  into effect, Plaintiff Tabrizi’s parents had no opportunity to present evidence of their eligibility \n23  for a waiver. \n24  229.  However, in December 2017, while Plaintiff Tabrizi’s mother waited for a \n25  decision on her husband’s visa, she received a letter from the Consulate stating she had in fact \n26  been found ineligible for a visa because of the Proclamation and denied a waiver. Months later, \n27  in February 2018, Plaintiff Tabrizi’s father received a similar letter. It stated that he too had \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 48 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.   P.O.

Plaintiff Tabrizi’s mother had visited the United States previously and \n3  complied with all requirements of her visa. \n4  230.  Although Plaintiff Tabrizi had hoped that her parents would receive visas in time \n5  for them to be present for the birth of her baby, they did not. Plaintiff Tabrizi gave birth in \n6  February 2018, and both she and her parents were devastated that her parents could not be there. \n7  They worry whether Plaintiff Tabrizi’s parents will ever be able to meet their grandchild. \n8  231.  The situation has caused Plaintiff Tabrizi anxiety and depression. Plaintiff \n9  Tabrizi had expected her parents to help care for her child during the first months after her \n10  delivery, allowing Plaintiff and her husband to return to work. Because Plaintiff Tabrizi cannot \n11  afford a caregiver, she has entrusted care of her child to her sister-in-law while she is at work. \n12  However, because of her sister-in-law’s medical condition and obligations to three other young \n13  children, she is unable to provide the regular attention and care Plaintiff Tabrizi expected her \n14  parents would provide for her infant child.  \n15  232.  Plaintiff Tabrizi has also had difficulty caring for her child because of a painful \n16  connective tissue disorder, which has made it difficult for her to bear the burdens of being a \n17  new parent. The waiver process has only prolonged the considerable hardship Plaintiff Tabrizi \n18  has faced without her parents’ assistance and emotional support. \n19  233.  Plaintiff John Doe #1, a native-born U.S. citizen, has suffered and will continue \n20  to suffer harm because of the Proclamation and the waiver process. Living conditions in Libya \n21  have become increasingly difficult and dangerous for Plaintiff John Doe #1’s aging parents, \n22  and he wishes to bring them to the United States so he can take care of them. \n23  234.  After Plaintiff John Doe #1 received an approval for his I-130 petition for his \n24  parents in September 2014, his parents were scheduled for an interview at the U.S. Consulate \n25  General in Casablanca in October 2016. But because Morocco now requires Libyans to have \n26  visas to enter the country, Plaintiff John Doe #1 had to reschedule his parents’ consular \n27  interview appointment to get his parents travel visas that would allow them to fly to Morocco. \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 49 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.

At the interview, the consular officer requested additional paperwork, such as \n5  police records and an affidavit of support. Although John Doe #1 and his parents were diligent \n6  in gathering the requested paperwork, this process was extremely time-consuming because of \n7  delays in the consulate’s responses to any communications. For example, it took the consulate \n8  four months to tell John Doe #1 that he needed to provide originals of his parents’ police \n9  records, not copies. The consulate ultimately confirmed in October 2017 that they required no \n10  further information, and said that Plaintiff John Doe #1’s parents’ visa applications were in \n11  administrative processing. \n12  236.  In January 2018, Plaintiff John Doe #1 received an e-mail stating that his \n13  parents’ visas had been refused under the Proclamation. He and his parents were devastated. \n14  237.  After speaking to an attorney, Plaintiff John Doe #1 learned about the waivers \n15  available under the Proclamation. In March 2018, he e-mailed the consulate to formally request \n16  a waiver for his parents, providing information to support the request. A week later, the \n17  government sent Plaintiff John Doe #1 a form e-mail, identical to the one he’d received in \n18  January, stating that his parents’ visas had been refused under the Proclamation. \n19  238.  The uncertainty about his parents’ visas, as well as the difficult situation his \n20  parents are living in, has frustrated and depressed John Doe #1. He is unable to sleep at night \n21  and has recently considered applying for medical leave under the Family and Medical Leave \n22  Act to get psychiatric treatment. He worries about his parents’ safety constantly because Libya \n23  is politically unstable and civilians like his parents are at the mercy of armed militias and gangs, \n24  who regularly kidnap people for ransom. An old high school classmate, who lives in the same \n25  town as John Doe #1’s parents, was recently kidnapped and held for over $100,000 in ransom, \n26  and John Doe #1 fears that this could happen to his parents, too. Apart from the danger presented \n27 \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 50 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.   P.O.

Plaintiff John Doe #1 has been extremely disappointed by the Proclamation and \n4  the waiver process. He does not understand how he, a U.S. citizen, can be prevented from seeing \n5  his parents and bringing them to safety. The form letters he has received from the consulate \n6  make it seem to him like the government won’t even acknowledge his existence or his \n7  humanity. He feels like the government is treating his family this way because they are Muslim. \n8  240.  Plaintiff John Doe #2, a U.S. citizen, has suffered and will continue to suffer \n9  harm because of the Proclamation and the waiver process. He and his two U.S. citizen \n10  daughters, aged seven and eleven, have been separated from his wife and their mother since \n11  2016. In August 2016, Plaintiff Doe #2 filed an I-130 immigrant visa petition for his wife so \n12  that their family can reunite and live together in Michigan. \n13  241.  After Plaintiff John Doe #2’s I-130 petition for his wife was approved, she \n14  interviewed at the U.S. Embassy in Djibouti in late December 2017. Despite informing her that \n15  her application was strong, and despite failing to inquire about any of the waiver eligibility \n16  criteria, the consular officer informed Plaintiff John Doe #2’s wife that she was ineligible for a \n17  visa pursuant to the Proclamation and denied her a waiver. Before handing her a letter indicating \n18  her visa ineligibility and waiver denial, the officer told Plaintiff John Doe #2’s wife that if it \n19  were his decision to make, he would have granted her a visa. \n20  242.  The Consulate’s decision to deny Plaintiff John Doe #2’s wife a waiver has \n21  devastated Plaintiff John Doe #2 and his family. Plaintiff John Doe #2’s seven- and eleven-\n22  year-old daughters are confused, anxious, and heartbroken their mother cannot be with them in \n23  the U.S. Plaintiff Doe #2’s wife desperately misses her children and worries about them \n24  constantly. She does so while living thousands of miles away in a neighborhood that has \n25  experienced armed violence and missile strikes because of the conflict in Yemen. Plaintiff John \n26  Doe #2 is also anguished and overwhelmed, as he cares for two young daughters without their \n27  mother’s support and care. \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 51 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.

After the end of his daughters’ school semester in spring 2018, Plaintiff John \n2  Doe #2 traveled with them to Egypt, a place where they have no family, so that they could be \n3  briefly reunited with their mother, who traveled to meet them there. In order to make the trip, \n4  Plaintiff John Doe #2 had to leave his job and now lives off his family’s savings. Given the \n5  family’s strained financial situation, as well as the need for his daughters to continue their \n6  education in the United States, Plaintiff John Doe #2 does not believe he can remain in Egypt \n7  for long or make repeated trips with his daughters to visit their mother.  \n8  244.  Plaintiff John Doe #3, a native-born U.S. citizen, has suffered and will continue \n9  to suffer harm because of the Proclamation and the waiver process, which are prolonging his \n10  separation from the love of his life and future wife-to-be, Plaintiff Jane Doe #1, and indefinitely \n11  placing his dreams for the future on hold.  \n12  245.  In 2009, he met and established a relationship with his fiancée, Plaintiff Jane \n13  Doe #1, while they were exchange students in Dubai.  Several years later they rekindled their \n14  relationship while Plaintiff John Doe #3 was stationed in the Middle East as part of his work \n15  with the U.S. government.  When in 2017, they became engaged, Plaintiff John Doe #3 was \n16  elated and his entire family traveled to Dubai, UAE, for the engagement celebration.  They \n17  planned a wedding in Southern California and began making arrangements, including arranging \n18  for Plaintiff Jane Doe #1’s move to the United States. \n19  246.  Plaintiff John Doe #3’s I-129F petition on behalf of Plaintiff Jane Doe #1 was \n20  approved in early April of this year, giving Plaintiff Jane Doe #1 a four-month window to apply \n21  for and receive a K-1 fiancée visa.  Believing Plaintiff Jane Doe #1’s visa approval imminent, \n22  Plaintiff John Doe #3 set about deciding on career opportunities in a location conducive for his \n23  fiancée to continue her professional work, finding a larger (and more expensive) apartment for \n24  them both, purchasing personal items she would need, planning their wedding in the U.S., \n25  adding her to bank and financial accounts, and planning future family vacations.  All of this has \n26  amounted to significant mental and emotional energy for John Doe #3 and great financial \n27  expense. \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 52 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.

To Plaintiff John Doe #3’s shock, however, Plaintiff Jane Doe #1’s visa was \n2  denied within minutes of her arriving at the consulate for her consular interview.  Plaintiff John \n3  Doe #3 is heartbroken to face the now indefinite separation from his fiancée.  Moreover, due to \n4  the nature of his prior work with the U.S. government and recent data breaches which have \n5  caused his employment and clearance information to be made public, Plaintiff John Doe #3 is \n6  unable to travel to Iran to visit his fiancée, nor can the couple marry abroad. Plaintiff John Doe \n7  #3 has reason to believe his affiliation to the  U.S. Government, if made  known to the \n8  Government of Iran, could adversely affect Plaintiff Jane Doe #1 or her family members, some \n9  of whom reside in Iran. \n10  248.  Plaintiff John Doe #3 has spent countless hours trying to determine what can be \n11  done to secure his fiancée’s travel to the United States within the four-month period his \n12  approved I-129F petition is valid.  He has spoken with his U.S. Representative’s office, \n13  numerous immigration practitioners, a senior U.S. diplomat, and several officers in the U.S. \n14  Departments  of  State  and  Homeland  Security.    In  this  correspondence,  he  has  received \n15  conflicting and confusing advice – some have absolutely no information about the waiver \n16  process, some have suggested he should first get married and then reapply, others have said \n17  there is nothing to do but wait for the ban to be lifted and then re-apply, and still others have \n18  suggested that completing various additional forms may allow his fiancée’s application to be \n19  reconsidered. One U.S. State Department official indicated to Plaintiff John Doe #3 that waiver \n20  considerations are not decided by consular officers, as stated in Section 3 of the Presidential \n21  Proclamation,  but  instead  brought  before  a  panel  at  the  Department’s  headquarters  in \n22  Washington, D.C. This has left Plaintiff John Doe #3 confused and desperate for accurate \n23  information about what to do next. \n24  249.  Plaintiff John Doe #3 has also spent considerable financial resources in support \n25  of being reunited with Plaintiff Jane Doe #1, including fees related to the I-129F petition, fees \n26  related to the visa application, significant travel expenses for him and his fiancée, and legal \n27  advice – amounting to over $11,000 over the past several months. He cannot maintain this level \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 53 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.   P.O.

Plaintiff Jane Doe #1, an Iranian national, has suffered and will continue to \n4  suffer harm because of the Proclamation and the waiver process.  She grew up primarily in the \n5  United States, where she lived for nearly a decade, and she attended a U.S. university for her \n6  undergraduate studies.  While she was studying abroad during her undergraduate studies in \n7  Dubai, she met Plaintiff John Doe #3. \n8  251.  She applied for a K-1 visa as the beneficiary of Plaintiff John Doe #3’s approved \n9  I-129F petition.  At the time she was living in Oman under a work visa.  In the Spring of 2018 \n10  she received notice from the U.S. Embassy in Muscat, Oman, that she should schedule her \n11  consular interview.  The notice did not provide any indication that the Presidential Proclamation \n12  would preclude her family from being together.  She promptly scheduled her interview and \n13  arranged to make the several-hour journey to the consulate office.   \n14  252.  Because a condition of her employment required her to provide at least 3 \n15  months’ notice before resigning and the K-1 visa, once granted, is only good for a short window \n16  of time, she resigned from her position to ensure that the effective date of her resignation would \n17  fall within that window.  \n18  253.  When Plaintiff Jane Doe #1 arrived at her consular interview, she brought all of \n19  the  paperwork  suggested  in  the  consulate’s  “Instructions  for  a  Nonimmigrant  Visa  for \n20  Fiancé(e),” including full copies of the initial I-129F approved application, prior DHS USCIS \n21  approval notices, the I-134, and all required and suggested supporting documentation.  None of \n22  the  paperwork  she  received  from  the  consulate  in  advance  of  the  interview  noted  the \n23  Proclamation or the waiver process.  Plaintiff Jane Doe #1’s consular interview lasted only \n24  several minutes.  She was not asked any questions related to the waiver criteria and she was not \n25  provided an opportunity to present evidence that might demonstrate her eligibility for a waiver. \n26  254.  After her interview, Plaintiff Jane Doe #1 received a notice indicating she had \n27  been denied a visa under the Proclamation and denied a waiver.  She was devastated.  Not only \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 54 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.   P.O.

As a result, Plaintiff Jane Doe #1 will be imminently losing her residency in Oman, which \n4  was conditioned on her remaining employed, and she will soon be forced to return to Iran. She \n5  is ineligible to return to her previous employer without going through a lengthy selection \n6  process (which may lead to denial), and since she studied at a U.S. accredited school for her \n7  graduate degree and lacks a native understanding of Farsi, she is ineligible to continue her \n8  vocation in her home country of Iran.  The Presidential Proclamation has left her with no \n9  employment options and forced her into a nomadic lifestyle attempting to figure out what is \n10  next.  She has no present income, and instead will require John Doe #3’s continual financial \n11  support. \n12  255.  Organizational Plaintiff Pars Equality Center has suffered and will continue \n13  to suffer harm because of the Proclamation and the waiver process. Since the Proclamation took \n14  effect and Defendants began implementing the waiver provision, the Pars legal team has been \n15  inundated  with  telephone  calls,  emails,  and  messages  from  community  members  asking \n16  questions and expressing concerns. Individuals with different immigration status — dual \n17  citizens, lawful permanent residents, visa holders, asylees, refugees, those seeking protected \n18  status, and Iranian refugee applicants outside the United States — have called Pars with anxious \n19  questions about how the Proclamation and waiver process will affect them or their loved ones. \n20  Responding to these inquiries has diverted significant resources from other areas of Pars’ \n21  practice  and  services.    Instead  of  devoting  its  resources  to  representing  clients  in  their \n22  immigration cases, the Pars legal team has been forced to spend most of its time advising clients \n23  and other community members on the Proclamation and assisting individuals in seeking \n24  waivers, work which has almost entirely culminated in a dead end.  \n25  256.  Pars continues to respond to an overwhelming volume of inquiries—at least 15 \n26  every  week—including  many  email  inquiries  and  in-person  consultations.   Pars  has  to \n27  continually update its website with up-to-date information about the Proclamation and the \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 55 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.   P.O. BOX 91302 \nSEATTLE, WA 98111-9402 \n206.223.7000  FAX: 206.223.7107 \n \n\n \n  Case 2:18-cv-01122-BHS   Document 1   Filed 07/31/18   Page 56 of 68\n \n1  waiver process.  As a result of the Proclamation and its attendant waiver requirement, Pars has \n2  produced weekly video content on its Facebook and Instagram pages to provide the community \n3  with desperately sought after information, as well as distributed regular press releases, all at the \n4  expense of its regular immigration services.  \n5  257.  Members of the Pars legal team have met with over one hundred affected \n6  individuals, either in person or telephonically, answered their waiver inquiries and in some \n7  cases, signed retainer agreements to represent them in seeking a waiver. Preparing waiver \n8  packets for individuals affected by the Proclamation is an arduous process, involving hours of \n9  long-distance communication with visa applicants abroad.  The time and effort spent in seeking \n10  waivers for clients have exhausted Pars’ legal resources, an expenditure that has gone to waste \n11  because none of Pars’ clients have thus far obtained a final waiver approval.  \n12  258.  Furthermore, the Proclamation and ineffectual waiver process have the long-\n13  term effect of reducing Pars’ potential client pool – indefinitely.  One of the central tenets of \n14  Pars’ mission is to assist Iranian immigrants with their integration into America society.  Close \n15  to 90 percent of Pars’ immigration and social services clients are Iranian immigrants.  The \n16  Proclamation’s bar on admission for Iranian nationals and the inability to meaningfully access \n17  a waiver for these clients puts Pars’ continued operation in serious jeopardy.  \n18  259.  The grants that Pars receives from the County of Santa Clara and the State of \n19  California are dependent on the number of immigration consultations performed and the \n20  number of immigration cases filed per quarter.  Because Iranian immigrants are no longer \n21  allowed entry, Pars risks losing 90 percent of its clientele, thereby putting Pars at risk of failing \n22  to meet its grant deliverables.  This would have a devastating impact on Pars’ operating budget, \n23  potentially forcing it to drastically cut its workforce and even forcing it to cease operations.  \n24  260.  As a result of the Proclamation and Defendants’ implementation of the waiver \n25  provision, the existing Iranian American community who have been Pars’ clients for many \n26  years now feel stigmatized and discriminated against.  The effect of these policies has been to \n27  instill fear and anxiety in the Iranian American community, exacerbating challenges that \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 56 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.

Pars’ clients have expressed fear of being treated as second class citizens, which has in \n3  turn undermined Pars’ civic engagement efforts and citizenship curriculum by instilling a loss \n4  of faith in the system among the participants.  The Proclamation and waiver process have \n5  restricted Pars’ ability to carry out its work and mission.  \n6  261.  In addition to the harms Pars faces directly, Pars has existing and prospective \n7  clients who will be harmed by the Proclamation and Defendants’ implementation of the waiver \n8  provision.  These clients face numerous barriers to participating directly in a lawsuit challenging \n9  the waiver process.  These include, but are not limited to, unfamiliarity with the U.S. legal \n10  system, fears over whether participation in a lawsuit could jeopardize their ability to reunite \n11  with family members abroad, and various language and cultural barriers.  \n12  262.  Organizational Plaintiff OneAmerica has suffered and will continue to suffer \n13  harm because of the Proclamation and the waiver process. Since the Proclamation went into \n14  effect on December 8, 2017, OneAmerica has been forced to focus a growing percentage of \n15  community education work on the Proclamation and Defendants’ implementation of the waiver \n16  provision.  \n17  263.  OneAmerica has had to reassign existing staff away from prior commitments to \n18  work focused on the Proclamation and the waiver process. \n19  264.  One of OneAmerica’s full-time organizers is now spending about one-third of \n20  her time on know-your-rights trainings related to the Proclamation and the waiver process.  \n21  Prior to this shift in her work, her time was dedicated to building up an educational reform \n22  program that OneAmerica has been working on for the past 5 years.  This organizer’s efforts \n23  on the educational reform project, which involved organizing parents, students, teachers, and \n24  school administrators to expand access to bilingual education in the State of Washington, has \n25  now all but ceased as a result of the Proclamation and waiver process.  \n26 \n27 \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 57 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.

Expanding access to bilingual education is a core component of OneAmerica’s \n2  mission to build power in immigrant communities through organizing, and advance democracy \n3  through civic engagement. \n4  266.  Another  one  of  OneAmerica’s  full-time  organizers  has  had  to  shift \n5  approximately one-third of her work away from organizing small business owners in the \n6  Muslim community towards answering concerns and providing community education on the \n7  Proclamation and the waiver process. \n8  267.  The success of OneAmerica’s work is largely dependent on active participation \n9  by its membership in OneAmerica organized-events and community education efforts.  The \n10  Proclamation and its attendant waiver process has had a chilling effect on the willingness of \n11  Muslim community members to participate because of the fear that it has caused in the \n12  community. \n13  268.  The Proclamation and Defendants’ implementation of the waiver provision has \n14  caused  OneAmerica  to  divert  resources  away  from  its  core  mission  and  organizational \n15  commitments and priorities and has chilled participation of Muslim community members in \n16  particular, thereby harming OneAmerica’s ability to achieve its core mission and purpose. \n17  Class Allegations \n269.

Individuals who have applied for a visa who are (i) nationals of the Designated \n6  Countries, (ii) subject to the Proclamation, and (iii) currently awaiting a decision \n7  on a waiver or have been denied a waiver (“Visa Applicant Subclass”).  \n8  270.  The Plaintiff Class is so numerous that joinder is impracticable.  \n9  271.  According to the Annual Report of the Visa Office, in 2017, the last year for \n10  which data are available, the United States issued approximately 45,901 immigrant and non-\n11  immigrant visas to nationals from the five countries banned by the Proclamation.  \n12  272.  The  claims  of  the  Plaintiff  Class  members  share  common  issues  of  law, \n13  including but not limited to whether the Defendants’ implementation of the waiver provision \n14  violates their rights under the APA, INA, and Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. \n15  273.  The  claims  of  the  Plaintiff  Class  members  share  common  issues  of  fact, \n16  including but not limited to the manner of process provided by Defendants’ implementation of \n17  the waiver provision, and whether that process has prevented or will prevent them or their \n18  family members from reuniting, or from re-entering the United States should they choose to \n19  leave briefly. \n20  274.  The claims or defenses of the named Plaintiffs are typical of the claims or \n21  defenses of the members of the Plaintiff Class. \n22  275.  The named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \n23  Plaintiff Class.  The named Plaintiffs have no interest that is now or may be potentially \n24  antagonistic to the interests of the Plaintiff Class.  The attorneys representing the named \n25  Plaintiffs include experienced civil rights attorneys who are considered able practitioners in \n26  federal constitutional litigation.  These attorneys should be appointed as class counsel. \n27 \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 59 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.   P.O. BOX 91302 \nSEATTLE, WA 98111-9402 \n206.223.7000  FAX: 206.223.7107 \n \n\n \n  Case 2:18-cv-01122-BHS   Document 1   Filed 07/31/18   Page 60 of 68\n \n1  276.  Defendants have acted, have threatened to act, and will act on grounds generally \n2  applicable  to  the  Plaintiff  Class,  thereby  making  final  injunctive  and  declaratory  relief \n3  appropriate to the class as a whole.  The Plaintiff Class may therefore be properly certified \n4  under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2). \n5  277.  Prosecution of separate actions by individual members of the Plaintiff Class \n6  would create the risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications and would establish incompatible \n7  standards of conduct for individual members of the Plaintiff Class.  The Plaintiff Class may \n8  therefore be properly certified under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(1). \n9  CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n10  FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Administrative Procedure Act) \n11  (On behalf of All Plaintiffs, including the Class) \n278.  The foregoing allegations are repeated and incorporated as though fully set forth \n12 \nherein. \n13 \n279.  Defendants have taken a number of actions in purported reliance on Section 3(c) \n14 \nof the Proclamation, including but not limited to issuing the “worldwide guidance” referenced \n15 \nin the State Department’s February 22 letter and the State Department guidance, cables, sample \n16 \nQ’s & A’s and instructions referenced in the Richardson declaration, as set forth above. \n17 \n280.  The actions Defendants have taken in purported reliance on Section 3(c) of the \n18 \nProclamation  constitute  final  agency  action(s)  within  the  meaning  of  the  Administrative \n19 \nProcedure Act. See Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154 (1997). \n20 \n281.  Defendants’ actions have resulted in a waiver process in which, among other \n21 \nthings, visa applicants have been denied waivers without ever having received notice of a \n22 \nwaiver process, and/or have been denied waivers without ever having had a consular interview \n23 \nor other opportunity to provide evidence of their eligibility for a waiver, in contravention of 22 \n24 \nC.F.R. §§ 41.121 and 42.81, which state that when refusing the issuance of a visa, a consular \n25 \nofficer must inform the visa applicant “whether there is, in law or regulations, a mechanism \n26 \n(such as a waiver) to overcome the refusal.” See 22 C.F.R. § 41.121(b)(1).   \n27 \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 60 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.

Defendants’ actions have resulted in a waiver process in which, among other \n2  things, visa applicants have had no consistent or meaningful process by which to submit \n3  evidence of waiver eligibility or to have such evidence considered by consular officers, which \n4  has resulted in vastly different practices within and across consulates. \n5  283.  Defendants’ actions have resulted in a waiver process in which, among other \n6  things, the eligibility criteria for a waiver and the exemplar situations in which a waiver may \n7  be appropriate, as set out in the Proclamation, have been misinterpreted and misapplied to \n8  require a higher standard of proof of visa applicants than the Proclamation itself requires. \n9  284.  Defendants’ actions have resulted in a waiver process in which, among other \n10  things, consular officers do not have discretion over whether and when to grant a waiver, and \n11  thus  no  discretion  over  whether  they  may  grant  a  visa  to  an  individual  subject  to  the \n12  Proclamation, in contravention of the Proclamation itself as well as 8 U.S.C. § 1104(a), which \n13  states that consular officers have complete discretion over the issuance of visas and that such \n14  discretion may not be circumscribed by the Secretary of State. \n15  285.  Defendants’ actions, as set forth above, are based on legal error; failed to \n16  consider all relevant factors; are contrary to the Proclamation; and lacked a rational explanation, \n17  particularly in light of the reliance interests at stake; and are therefore arbitrary, capricious, an \n18  abuse of discretion, and otherwise not in accordance with law, in violation of the Administrative \n19  Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n20  286.  Defendants’ actions, as set forth above, are contrary to constitutional rights, \n21  including Plaintiffs’ rights not to be deprived of their liberty interest in family reunification, \n22  and statutory and regulatory rights to petition for visas for their family members, without due \n23  process and as protected by the First and Fifth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, in \n24  violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). \n25  287.  Defendants’ actions, as set forth above, are ultra vires and in excess of any \n26  authority granted by the Proclamation, regulation, or statute, including 8 U.S.C. §1104(a), and \n27  not otherwise in accordance with law in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 61 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.

The foregoing allegations are repeated and incorporated as though fully set forth \n6 \nherein. \n7 \n289.  Defendants’ actions have resulted in a waiver process in which, among other \n8 \nthings, visa applicants have been denied waivers without ever having received notice of a \n9 \nwaiver process, and/or have been denied waivers without ever having had a consular interview \n10 \nor other opportunity to provide evidence of their eligibility for a waiver, in contravention of 22 \n11 \nC.F.R. §§ 41.121 and 42.81, which state that when refusing the issuance of a visa, a consular \n12 \nofficer must inform the visa applicant “whether there is, in law or regulations, a mechanism \n13 \n(such as a waiver) to overcome the refusal.” See 22 C.F.R. § 41.121(b)(1). \n14 \n290.

Defendants’ actions have resulted in a waiver process in which, among other \n19 \nthings, consular officers do not have discretion over whether and when to grant a waiver, and \n20 \nthus  no  discretion  over  whether  they  may  grant  a  visa  to  an  individual  subject  to  the \n21 \nProclamation, in contravention of the Proclamation itself as well as 8 U.S.C. § 1104(a), which \n22 \nstates that consular officers have complete discretion over the issuance of visas and that such \n23 \ndiscretion may not be circumscribed by the Secretary of State. \n24 \n292.

Defendants’ actions, as set forth above, should therefore be set aside under the \n4  principle articulated in United States ex. rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260 (1954).  \n5  294.  Defendants’ actions, as set forth above, fail to comply with the issuing agencies’ \n6  regulations and are therefore arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \n7  accordance with law, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n8  THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Due Process, Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution) \n9  (On behalf of Plaintiffs Whitehall Raghebi, Hassan, Siraji, Ahmed, Azimi, Ghaleb, \nHanout, Zamani Hosseinabadi, Tabrizi, John Does #1-3, Pars, OneAmerica, and the \n10  “U.S. Petitioner Subclass”) \n295.  The foregoing allegations are repeated and incorporated as though fully set forth \n11 \nherein. \n12 \n296.  Defendants’ actions have resulted in a waiver process in which, among other \n13 \nthings, visa applicants have been denied waivers without ever having received notice of a \n14 \nwaiver process, and/or have been denied waivers without ever having had a consular interview \n15 \nor other opportunity to provide evidence of their eligibility for a waiver, in contravention of 22 \n16 \nC.F.R. §§ 41.121 and 42.81, which state that when refusing the issuance of a visa, a consular \n17 \nofficer must inform the visa applicant “whether there is, in law or regulations, a mechanism \n18 \n(such as a waiver) to overcome the refusal.” See 22 C.F.R. § 41.121(b)(1). \n19 \n297.

Defendants’ actions have resulted in a waiver process in which, among other \n2  things, consular officers do not have discretion over whether and when to grant a waiver, and \n3  thus  no  discretion  over  whether  they  may  grant  a  visa  to  an  individual  subject  to  the \n4  Proclamation, in contravention of the Proclamation itself as well as 8 U.S.C. § 1104(a), which \n5  states that consular officers have complete discretion over the issuance of visas and that such \n6  discretion may not be circumscribed by the Secretary of State. \n7  300.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n8  provides that “[n]o person . . . shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process \n9  of law.”  \n10  301.  Congress has created statutory rights related to the petitioning for and issuance \n11  of visas and other immigration benefits.  \n12  302.  Federal agencies have created regulatory rights related to the petitioning for and \n13  issuance of visas and other immigration benefits. \n14  303.  Individuals must be given due process prior to the deprivation of these statutory \n15  and regulatory rights. \n16  304.  Additionally,  United  States  citizens  and  lawful  permanent  residents  have \n17  constitutionally protected liberty interests in family reunification and in the ability of their \n18  family members to travel to the United States. Individuals must be given due process prior to \n19  any deprivation of these liberty interests.  \n20  305.  Defendants’ actions, as set forth above, deprive individuals, including Plaintiffs \n21  and their members or clients, of the aforementioned statutory and regulatory rights, and liberty \n22  interests, without due process. \n23  306.  Defendants’ actions, as set forth above, thus violate the procedural due process \n24  guarantee of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  \n25   \n26  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n27  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray for the following relief: \nLANE POWELL PC \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 64 \n1420 FIFTH AVENUE, SUITE 4200 \nNO.

Reg. 45161 (2017) (the “Proclamation”).  The \n21  Proclamation sharply curtailed, and in some cases completely suspended, entry into the United \n22  States by nationals of Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, Yemen and Somalia.  Id. \n23  at 45162, 45165-67.1  Plaintiffs focus on nationals of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, and \n24  challenge the government’s handling of a waiver program that would allow exceptions for entry \n25  into the United States in certain circumstances.  The gravamen of the complaints is that the \n26 \n27 \n \n1 The restrictions on nationals of Chad have been lifted.  Presidential Proclamation No. 9723, 83 \n28 \nFed. Reg. 15937 (Apr. 10, 2018). \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 152   Filed 06/05/20   Page 2 of 10\n \n1  government created guidance for waivers which it has systematically ignored to deny the vast \n2  majority of waiver applications.   \n3  The Court granted in part and denied in part a motion to dismiss in the Emami case with \n4  leave to amend, finding that plaintiffs had plausibly stated a claim under the Accardi doctrine.  \n5  Dkt. No. 74 (Emami) at 16.  The heart of this claim was that “the State Department has acted \n6  arbitrarily and unlawfully by disregarding its own procedures and rules in administering the \n7  waiver program” established by the Proclamation.  Id. at 14.  The Emami plaintiffs filed a second \n8  amended complaint.  Dkt. No. 75 (Emami).  As the Emami motion to dismiss proceedings were \n9  under way, the Pars case was transferred here from the Western District of Washington.  Dkt. No. \n10  80 (Pars).  The operative complaint in that case remains the initial complaint.  Dkt. No. 1 (Pars).  \n11  Defendants have filed motions to dismiss, or to obtain summary judgment for, the second \n12  amended complaint in Emami and the complaint in Pars.  Dkt. No. 98 (Emami); Dkt. No. 120 \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  (Pars).  This order resolves those motions.   \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  DISCUSSION \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  The parties’ familiarity with the record is assumed.  The prior dismissal order provides a \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  detailed statement of the case and plaintiffs’ claims, and the governing standards for a motion to \nS d nr\nee 17  dismiss.  Dkt. No. 74 (Emami).   \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  I.  MOTIONS TO DISMISS \n19  A.  Pars Complaint \n20  The Court has not been called upon to review the plausibility of the Pars complaint until \n21  now.  The analysis of the Emami complaint in the dismissal order applies in full measure here, and \n22  streamlines the discussion. \n23  1.  Justiciability \n24  The Court squarely answered the government’s justiciability objection in Emami.  \n25  Dismissal for lack of a justiciable controversy was denied because the Emami plaintiffs are not \n26  suing over “individual consular officer decisions on the merits . . . [or] the outcome of any \n27  particular consular officer’s decision in a given case.”  Dkt. No. 74 (Emami) at 11-12.  They are \n28  “challenging systemic practices with respect to the waiver program, and not individualized \n2 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 152   Filed 06/05/20   Page 3 of 10\n \n1  determinations for any specific person.”  Id. at 12.  So too in the Pars complaint.  See Dkt. No. 1 \n2  (Pars); Dkt. No. 125 (Pars) at 6 (“Plaintiffs do not seek review of any individual, discretionary \n3  decision by a consular officer,” rather, “they seek review of the policies and practices that \n4  Defendants have adopted to implement the Proclamation”).  This is a justiciable controversy \n5  properly before the Court.   \n6  2.  APA Claim \n7  Defendants’ request to dismiss the APA claim in Pars is denied.  Defendants say that the \n8  APA does not apply at all.  Dkt. No. 120 (Pars) at 9-10.  But as the Court has already determined, \n9  the Administrative Procedure Act “creates a ‘basic presumption of judicial review for one \n10  suffering legal wrong because of agency action,’” and our circuit has construed the APA “to \n11  provide for ‘broad judicial review of agency action.’”  Dkt. No. 74 (Emami) at 13 (quoting \n12  Weyerhaeuser Co. v. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Serv., 139 S.Ct. 361, 370 (2018), and Regents of the \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Univ. of Cal. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 908 F.3d 476, 494 (9th Cir. 2018)).  Agency action \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  is not immunized from review just because it might be linked to a Presidential Proclamation.  See \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 932 F.3d 742, 770 (9th Cir. 2018) (“insofar as DOJ and \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  DHS have incorporated the Proclamation by reference into the Rule, we may consider the validity \nS d nr\nee 17  of the agency’s proposed action, including its ‘rule . . . or the equivalent’”); Chamber of \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Commerce of the U.S. v. Reich, 74 F.3d 1322, 1326 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (“agency regulations that \n19  implement an executive order are reviewable under the APA”). \n20  The Pars complaint is based on a final agency action properly subject to judicial review.  \n21  Defendants say that plaintiffs have “fail[ed] . . . to direct their complaint against any ‘final agency \n22  action,’” Dkt. No. 128 (Pars) at 2-3, but that is not a fair characterization of plaintiffs’ complaint.  \n23  The Pars plaintiffs have identified, and are challenging, a final agency action consisting of “the \n24  ‘worldwide guidance’ referenced in the State Department’s February 22 letter and the State \n25  Department guidance, cables, sample Q’s & A’s and instructions referenced in the Richardson \n26  declaration,” along with other actions taken by defendants in reliance of Section 3(c) of the \n27  Proclamation.  Dkt. No. 1 (Pars) ¶¶ 279-80.  Plaintiffs further allege that these actions resulted in \n28  a waiver process in which, among other things, “visa applicants have been denied waivers without \n3 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 152   Filed 06/05/20   Page 4 of 10\n \n1  ever having received notice of a waiver process, and/or have been denied waivers without ever \n2  having had a consular interview or other opportunity to provide evidence of their eligibility for a \n3  waiver, in contravention of 22 C.F.R. §§ 41.121 and 42.81, which state that when refusing the \n4  issuance of a visa, a consular officer must inform the visa applicant ‘whether there is, in law or \n5  regulations, a mechanism (such as a waiver) to overcome the refusal.’”  Id. ¶ 281 (quoting 22 \n6  C.F.R. § 41.121(b)(1)).  Plaintiffs also allege that the government has implemented a waiver \n7  process in which “consular officers do not have discretion over whether and when to grant a \n8  waiver, and thus no discretion over whether they may grant a visa to an individual subject to the \n9  Proclamation, in contravention of the Proclamation itself as well as 8 U.S.C. § 1104(a), which \n10  states that consular officers have complete discretion over the issuance of visas and that such \n11  discretion may not be circumscribed by the Secretary of State.”  Id. ¶ 284.   \n12  Defendants suggest that “the Proclamation [is] the only relevant source of law in this \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  case,” Dkt. No. 128 (Pars) at 2-3, but plaintiffs have identified a number of legal tests with which \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  to assay the government’s conduct, and defendants have not demonstrated that plaintiffs have \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  missed the mark.  In effect, plaintiffs are following Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S.Ct. 2392, 2408 \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  (2018), where the Supreme Court measured the Proclamation against the provisions of the \nS d nr\nee 17  Immigration and Nationality Act, even after finding that the President had lawfully exercised his \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  “broad discretion to suspend the entry of aliens into the United States” under § 1182(f) of that \n19  statute.  See Hawaii, 138 S.Ct. at 2411 (“We may assume that § 1182(f) does not allow the \n20  President to expressly override particular provisions of the INA.  But plaintiffs have not identified \n21  any conflict between the statute and the Proclamation”).  In this case, plaintiffs have plausibly \n22  alleged conflicts between the government’s actions, 22 C.F.R. §§ 41.121 and 42.81, the \n23  Proclamation, and 8 U.S.C. § 1104(a).  Defendants effectively concede the point by sidestepping \n24  the conflict allegations with factual arguments, such as “each Plaintiff received exactly what the \n25  regulations require,” Dkt. No. 120 (Pars) at 11, and “Plaintiffs are wrong that consular officers are \n26  denied discretion to grant waivers,” Dkt. No. 128 (Pars) at 7. \n27  The Court also declines to dismiss at this juncture plaintiffs’ allegation that defendants’ \n28  implementation of the waiver provision violated the APA’s notice-and-comment requirements.  \n4 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 152   Filed 06/05/20   Page 5 of 10\n \n1  Dkt. No. 125 (Pars) at 11; Dkt. No. 1 (Pars) ¶ 287 (“Defendants’ actions, as set forth above, affect \n2  the Plaintiffs’ substantive rights and were made without observance of procedure required by law \n3  in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D).”).  “[W]hen an agency \n4  promulgates regulations other than ‘interpretative rules, general statements of policy, or rules of \n5  agency organization, procedure, or practice,’ 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(A), the statute provides the public \n6  with pre-promulgation notice and comment.  5 U.S.C. § 553(b), (c).”  Alcaraz v. Block, 746 F.2d \n7  593, 610-11 (9th Cir. 1984) (internal citation omitted).  The government cites Innovation Law Lab \n8  v. McAleenan, 924 F.3d 503, 509 (9th Cir. 2019), for the proposition that the State Department’s \n9  waiver guidance was not required to go through notice-and-comment rulemaking because it was \n10  merely “a ‘general statement of policy’ to guide the exercise of discretion by its officials.”  Dkt. \n11  No. 128 (Pars) at 6.  But that is not consistent with plaintiffs’ allegations here.  Plaintiffs have \n12  plausibly alleged for 12(b)(6) purposes that defendants have issued guidance which resulted in a \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  waiver process in which consular officers had no discretion to exercise at all.  Dkt. No. 1 (Pars) \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  ¶¶ 279, 284.  The government may, however, raise the argument again if warranted at a later stage \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  of the case, after development of the record.   \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  3.  Accardi Claim \nS d nr\nee 17  As a second claim, the Pars plaintiffs essentially re-allege their first claim in the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  alternative, this time under the “Accardi Doctrine & Administrative Procedure Act.”  Dkt. No. 1 \n19  (Pars) ¶¶ 289-94.  It will go forward for the reasons stated in the Emami order with respect to the \n20  Accardi doctrine.  The government says that “Accardi has no relevance here, where the \n21  Proclamation and its related guidance are neither regulations nor internal documents that create \n22  any procedural rights.”  Dkt. No. 120 (Pars) at 10.  This is in effect an improper request for \n23  reconsideration of the Emami order, see Civil L.R. 7-9, and in any event, the Accardi doctrine is \n24  not so circumscribed, as the government’s own case citations demonstrate.  In Montilla v. \n25  Immigration and Naturalization Service, 926 F.2d 162, 167 (2d Cir. 1991), the court held that \n26  “[t]he Accardi doctrine is premised on fundamental notions of fair play underlying the concept of \n27  due process.  . . . Its ambit is not limited to rules attaining the status of formal regulations.  As the \n28  Supreme Court noted ‘where the rights of individuals are affected, it is incumbent upon agencies \n5 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 152   Filed 06/05/20   Page 6 of 10\n \n1  to follow their own procedures.’”  The Montilla court further noted that “[t]he doctrine has \n2  continued vitality, particularly where a petitioner’s rights are ‘affected.’”  Id. \n3  Two other aspects of the Montilla case are relevant here.  It does not stand for the \n4  proposition, as the government suggests, that “even assuming that an Accardi claim could survive \n5  a motion to dismiss, the only relief available would be limited to a ‘remand’ with instructions for \n6  the agency to comply.”  Dkt. No. 120 (Pars) at 11.  In Montilla, a remand to the Board of \n7  Immigration Appeals made sense because petitioner’s sole contention on appeal was that “the \n8  immigration judge did not follow the applicable regulation protecting an alien’s right to counsel, 8 \n9  C.F.R. § 242.16(a) (1990), and that this error constituted a denial of due process” in his \n10  deportation proceeding.  926 F.2d at 166, 170.  The Montilla court never said that a remand was \n11  the only option for an Accardi violation; to the contrary, it emphasized that the doctrine was “still \n12  alive and well” and that it was a “judicially-evolved rule ensuring fairness.”  Id. at 168.  This \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  underscores the flexibility inherent in the doctrine to fashion a remedy that fits the wrong.  \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Montilla is also notable for applying Accardi as a freestanding claim, untethered to the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  APA or other statute.  This is entirely consistent with the decision in Accardi itself, which was not \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  based on the APA.  See United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260 (1954).  The \nS d nr\nee 17  Court has reached the same conclusion as Montilla that an Accardi claim can stand on its own and \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  “is at heart a claim of procedural fairness that owes as much to the Due Process Clause as to the \n19  Administrative Procedures Act.”  Dkt. No. 122 (Emami) at 2 (citing Jefferson v. Harris, 285 F. \n20  Supp. 3d 173, 185 (D.D.C. 2018)).  Plaintiffs’ decision to tie their Accardi claim to the APA is \n21  analytically questionable, and they may find that they have imposed on themselves unnecessary \n22  burdens by doing that.  The request to dismiss the Pars plaintiffs’ second claim under the Accardi \n23  doctrine is denied.   \n24  4.  Fifth Amendment Due Process Claim \n25  Plaintiffs’ third claim directly under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment for a \n26  violation of procedural due process cannot go forward.  In the Emami order, the Court dismissed \n27  this claim due to plaintiffs’ “inability to allege a deprivation of an interest protected by the Due \n28  Process Clause.”  Dkt. No. 74 (Emami) at 17.  This is a separate and different inquiry from the one \n6 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 152   Filed 06/05/20   Page 7 of 10\n \n1  under Accardi, and is subject to different standards.  The Pars plaintiffs ask the Court to \n2  “reconsider its view,” Dkt. No. 125 (Pars) at 12, on the basis of a circuit decision from 2008.  See \n3  id. at 12-13 (citing Bustamante v. Mukasey, 531 F.3d 1059 (9th Cir. 2008)).  This is also an \n4  improper request for reconsideration, and it is unpersuasive in that Bustamante pre-dates Kerry v. \n5  Din, 135 S.Ct. 2128 (2015), the main basis for the Court’s prior order on this issue, by nearly a \n6  decade.  The third claim is dismissed.   \n7  B.  Emami Second Amended Complaint \n8  The second amended complaint in Emami, and the attendant motion to dismiss arguments, \n9  are Groundhog Day or déjà vu all over again, depending on one’s taste in clichés.  The allegations \n10  and arguments on both sides are virtually unchanged.  \n11  The Emami SAC continues to suffer from vague and conflicting allegations.  To take one \n12  example, the SAC says that defendants have failed to issue any guidance at all.  See, e.g., Dkt. No. \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  75 (Emami) ¶ 313 (“Defendants have either failed to promulgate guidance or have promulgated \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  guidance that is arbitrary and capricious on its face”).  This is an inherently odd assertion, \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  especially in light of plaintiffs’ own complaint exhibits in which the State Department recognized \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  its online postings as its “outward facing guidance” for waivers.  Dkt. No. 74 (Emami) at 14.  \nS d nr\nee 17  Plaintiffs try to walk this back in their opposition to the motion to dismiss, where they say that \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  their claim “is not that no guidance has been issued at all, but rather that the issued guidance has \n19  not been followed; that the guidance itself is arbitrary and capricious; and that it violates \n20  Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights.”  Dkt. No. 104 (Emami) at 1-2.  In light of this admission, the \n21  portions and claims in the SAC alleging that no guidance was issued are dismissed.  The Court \n22  will not catalog here the other vague and inconsistent allegations in the SAC, but if they become \n23  an issue in the case, they are likely to meet a similar disposition. \n24  The government’s request to dismiss the first claim under the APA is denied.  Plaintiffs \n25  allege, among other things, that the government has “failed to follow their own policies and \n26  procedures,” and have “put in place a waiver process in which applicants are denied waivers \n27  without ever receiving notice or an opportunity to apply [and] applicants are denied waivers \n28  without having had a consular interview since the time the Proclamation went into effect.”  Dkt. \n7 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 152   Filed 06/05/20   Page 8 of 10\n \n1  No. 75 (Emami) ¶ 314.  Plaintiffs allege that these actions should be invalidated under Accardi, \n2  347 U.S. 260.  Id. ¶ 317.  The Court has already found this to be a viable claim, Dkt. No. 74 \n3  (Emami), and that conclusion holds.  \n4  The second and third claims for relief under the Fifth Amendment are again dismissed \n5  based on an “inability to allege a deprivation of an interest protected by the Due Process Clause.”  \n6  Dkt. No. 74 (Emami) at 17.  The Court has also determined that the equal protection claim “holds \n7  together only if it is assumed that the Proclamation unconstitutionally excludes Muslims or \n8  illegally discriminates on the basis of nationality, a proposition that the Supreme Court turned \n9  aside in Hawaii.”  Id. (citing 138 S.Ct. at 2413-23).  The Court further noted that the equal \n10  protection claim was likely to be subject to rational basis review, and that the Supreme Court “has \n11  already concluded in reviewing the Proclamation that ‘the Government has set forth a sufficient \n12  national security justification to survive rational basis review.’  Hawaii, 138 S.Ct. at 2423.”  Id. at \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  18.  The Emami plaintiffs’ Fifth Amendment claims are virtually unchanged from their previous \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  versions, and the Court sees no reason to reach a different conclusion on either claim. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  The mandamus claim is dismissed.  The claim focuses on defendants’ alleged “fail[ure] to \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  develop meaningful guidance,” Dkt. No. 75 (Emami) ¶ 336, an allegation that plaintiffs have now \nS d nr\nee 17  retracted.  Plaintiffs have added a claim for unreasonable delay on decisions on individual visa and \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  waiver applications.  Id. ¶ 337.  But “[m]andamus is an extraordinary remedy and is available to \n19  compel a federal official to perform a duty only if: (1) the individual’s claim is clear and certain; \n20  (2) the official’s duty is nondiscretionary, ministerial, and so plainly prescribed as to be free from \n21  doubt, and (3) no other adequate remedy is available.”  Kildare v. Saenz, 325 F.3d 1078, 1084 (9th \n22  Cir. 2003); see also Heckler v. Ringer, 466 U.S. 602, 616 (1984) (“The common-law writ of \n23  mandamus, as codified in 28 U.S.C. § 1361, is intended to provide a remedy for a plaintiff only if \n24  he has exhausted all other avenues of relief and only if the defendant owes him a clear \n25  nondiscretionary duty.”).  Plaintiffs do not identify any source of law that mandates that decisions \n26  be issued within a certain period of time, and the decisions on individual waiver applications are \n27  inherently discretionary.  See 82 Fed. Reg. at 45168 (“a consular officer, or the Commissioner, \n28 \n8 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 152   Filed 06/05/20   Page 9 of 10\n \n1  United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP), or the Commissioners’ designee, as \n2  appropriate, may, in their discretion, grant waivers on a case-by-case basis”). \n3  II.  SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n4  The government’s motions for summary judgment are denied.  The government relies on \n5  an “administrative record” to “show[] that defendants have applied the waiver provision in an \n6  orderly way.”  Dkt. No. 98 (Emami) at 11.  But this does not account for the Accardi claims, and \n7  “there is no ‘administrative record’ when the essence of the claim is that the government has failed \n8  to act in accordance with its own rules and regulations.”  Dkt. No. 122 (Emami) at 2.  In addition, \n9  the multiple discovery dispute letters that have been filed in these cases underscore the degree to \n10  which the parties disagree about the material facts and what the “administrative record” might \n11  properly contain.  These factual disputes preclude summary judgment at this time.  See Federal \n12  Trade Commission v. D-Link Systems, Inc., No. 17-cv-00039-JD, 2018 WL 6040192 (N.D. Cal. \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Nov. 5, 2018).  It is also doubtful that plaintiffs have had a full and fair opportunity to take \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  discovery from defendants and test the evidence the government has presented as the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  administrative record.   \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  CONCLUSION \nS d nr\nee 17  In the Pars case, defendants’ motion to dismiss is denied as to plaintiffs’ APA claim and \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Accardi claim, but granted as to the Fifth Amendment claim.  The summary judgment motion is \n19  denied without prejudice.   \n20  In the Emami case, defendants’ motion to dismiss is denied for plaintiffs’ APA claim, but \n21  granted for plaintiffs’ Fifth Amendment Due Process and Equal Protection claims, and the \n22  mandamus claim.  Defendants’ summary judgment motion is denied without prejudice.   \n23  On this record, the Court declines to provide yet another round of pleading amendments to \n24  either set of plaintiffs.  The Emami plaintiffs have had multiple opportunities to amend, in which \n25  case the Court’s discretion to deny further amendment is especially broad.  See Chodos v. West  \n26  // \n27  // \n28  // \n9 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 152   Filed 06/05/20   Page 10 of 10\n \n1  Publishing Co., 292 F.3d 992, 1003 (9th Cir. 2002).  So too for the Pars plaintiffs, given the \n2  procedural context of these closely related cases.   \n3  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n4  Dated:  June 5, 2020  \n5   \n6     \nJAMES DONATO \n7 \nUnited States District Judge \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13 \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15 \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16 \nS d nr\nee 17 \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n10 ",
