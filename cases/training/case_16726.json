          "description": "District Judge Leo T. Sorokin: ELECTRONIC ORDER entered With Regard to [2] Motion for TRO. Plaintiffs filed a complaint today along with an emergency motion for a TRO. The Court has provided counsel for the United States copies of the pleadings and held a telephone hearing this evening with counsel for the government and the plaintiffs. The standard for issuance of an injunction is the familiar four part test. The irreparable harm to the plaintiffs is obvious and overwhelming tomorrow morning they will be evicted and homeless since by definition each plaintiffs home was rendered uninhabitable by the hurricane in Puerto Rico, a determination previously made by the defendants. The public interest on balance favors the plaintiffs both in terms of their personal interests and considering the specter of many sick individuals without homes of their own being rendered homeless with the resulting drain on other public resources in addition to the possible human consequences. The substantially closer question is whether Plaintiffs have established a likelihood of success on the merits of one or more of their legal claims. The Plaintiffs in their papers and at the hearing have articulated, at least, claims that they are entitled to (1) reasonable notice of the termination of the temporary housing assistance; (2) assistance as long as they remain eligible; and (3) assistance in transition to other housing. In addition, they assert that FEMA in prior roughly equivalent disasters has extended the temporary housing assistance substantially longer than in the present disaster. On the record before the Court, which is admittedly limited in that the government has had only the most limited opportunity to respond, the Plaintiffs have demonstrated a sufficient likelihood of success to warrant an limited temporary restraining order under the totality of the circumstances and the governing law. Specifically, the affidavits from counsel show deficiencies in notice and transition assistance. Whether that evidentiary showing prevails on a fuller record is not now necessary to decide. Accordingly, the Court (1) ENJOINS the Defendants and their agents from terminating the Temporary Housing Assistance program which provides the payment for shelter for the plaintiffs (including the class) until at least midnight July 3, 2018 (i.e. enabling Plaintiffs and the class to stay until checkout time on July 4, 2018); (2) ORDERS Defendants and their agents to provide notice and take whatever action is necessary to extend the assistance until the aforementioned deadline; and (3) SCHEDULES a telephone hearing on this matter before Judge Hillman on Monday July 2, 2018 at 12:45 p.m. This ruling is WITHOUT PREJUDICE to any rulings by Judge Hillman. At the hearing before Judge Hillman counsel for plaintiffs ought be prepared to address with more specificity, inter alia, the specific nature and basis for the right to notice, the nature and basis of the right to ongoing housing assistance, the nature and basis for the right to transition assistance, and the legal significance, if any, of the different durations of housing assistance programs. Counsel for the government ought be prepared to address, inter alia, (on Monday or such further time as requested by the government) the lack of basis for the foregoing issues. Nothing in this outline limits or precludes the parties from raising issues fairly within the pleadings or appropriate defenses. The Clerk will provide call in information for the call on Monday. The undersigned has addressed this motion as the emergency district judge. /s/ Leo T. Sorokin, United States District Judge. (Healy, Bethaney)"

    "summary": "<p>On June 30, 2018, eight Hurricane Maria evacuees from Puerto Rico who were receiving Transitional Shelter Assistance from Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”) filed this putative class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The case was assigned to District Judge Timothy S. Hillman. </p><p>The plaintiffs sued FEMA under the Administrative Procedures Act and the Declaratory Judgment Act. The plaintiffs, represented by LatinoJustice PRLDEF (Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund), Hector E. Pineiro, and Manatt Phelps and Phillips, LLP, sought injunctive and declaratory relief, claiming that FEMA was planning to unlawfully terminate the TSA program which provided direct funding to hotels and motels that served as shelters for Puerto Ricans who evacuated the territory due to Hurricane Maria. The plaintiffs specifically alleged that FEMA was planning to terminate its TSA program for Puerto Rican evacuees, without any plan to transition the evacuees into longer-term housing. The plaintiffs argued that this was in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Administrative Procedures Act, and the Stafford Act that require nondiscrimination in disaster assistance. In their motion for a preliminary injunction, the plaintiff’s sought to extend the provision of the TSA program until all eligible individuals either received temporary housing or found permanent housing.</p><p>On June 30, 2018, the same day the complaint was filed, Judge Leo T. Sorokin entered a Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO”), enjoining FEMA from terminating the TSA program until at least midnight July 3, 2018, enabling Plaintiffs and the class to remain in transitional shelters until checkout time on July 4, 2018. </p><p>Right as the initial TRO was set to end, Judge Hillman extended it until at least midnight July 23, 2018. Judge Hillman extended the TRO to give the parties an opportunity to fully brief the important and complex issues raised by plaintiffs’ complaint and their corresponding motion for preliminary injunction. </p><p>Judge Hillman subsequently extended the TRO on two more occasions: July 19, 2018 (extending it until August 7, 2018) and on August 22, 2018 (extending it until August 31, 2018). </p><p>In plaintiffs' first amended complaint, filed on July 12, six named plaintiffs were dropped from the suit and two additional plaintiffs were added. Plaintiffs also asserted new claims for violation of their equal protection rights under the Fifth Amendment.</p><p>Presumably because the plaintiffs had already received several extensions granting them access to temporary housing, on August 30, 2018, Judge Hillman denied plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. The Court found that the plaintiffs did not have a high likelihood of success on the merits - the touchstone of the preliminary injunction inquiry. Judge Hillman ordered the defendants to refrain from terminating the program that provided the payment for shelter for the plaintiffs (including the class) until midnight September 13, 2018, in order to give the evacuees time to make alternative housing arrangements. </p><p>On September 20, 2018, Judge Hillman granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the case entirely. The contents of this order are unavailable to us at this time. The case is now closed. </p><p></p>",

In \nMay, FEMA announced that as of June 30, 2018, it would discontinue Transitional Shelter \nAssistance (“TSA”) for such evacuees.1 The Plaintiffs have filed suit against the Defendants \nseeking to prevent the termination of benefits under the TSA program for themselves and other \n                                                 \n  1 In simple terms, the TSA program provides direct funding to hotels and motels, which serve as shelters \nfor individuals and families who are forced to evacuate their damaged or destroyed homes due to a natural disaster.  \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 67   Filed 08/30/18   Page 2 of 25\nsimilarly situated persons. In their First Amended Complaint (Docket No. 28), they assert claims \nfor deprivation of their Fifth Amendment Due Process Rights (Count I), violation of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(A), (B), 5 U.S. C. § 706(1)(Counts \nII-IV), deprivation of their Fifth Amendment Equal Protection Rights (Count VI) and \nDiscrimination in Disaster Assistance in violation of 28 U.S.C. §5151(a) and 44 C.F.R. § 7.3 \n(Count No. VII). Plaintiffs also seek a Declaratory Judgment (Count V).2 \n  On June 30, 3018, Judge Sorokin entered a Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO”), \nwhich I have continued until August 31, 2018 (allowing the Plaintiffs and the class to stay until \ncheckout time on September 1, 2018) to give the parties an opportunity to fully brief the \nimportant and complex issues raised by Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint and corresponding \nmotion for preliminary injunction. See Continuation of Temporary Restraining Order, dated July \n3, 2018 (Docket No. 19), Second Continuation of Temporary Restraining Order, dated July 19, \n2018 (Docket No. 38), and Order Memorializing The Previously Granted Third Continuation of \nTemporary Restraining Order, dated August 22, 2018 (Docket No. 63). \n  This Order addresses Plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction, on behalf of \nthemselves and all similarly situated individuals, to extend the provision of the emergency \nassistance which they are currently receiving. Specifically, Plaintiffs are asking that FEMA be \nordered to continue providing the Plaintiffs with TSA until all eligible individuals either receive \n                                                 \n  2 On June 30, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a complaint (Docket No. 1) and simultaneously filed a motion for \ntemporary restraining order and preliminary injunction (Docket No. 2).  On July 12, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a First \nAmended Complaint, as of right (Docket No. 28). By that pleading, named Plaintiffs Alian Asencio, Aracelis Velez \nCruz, Denise Nieves, Yaritza De Jesus Lopez, Rosa Rivera, and Angel Lauriano Muñoz De Jesus were dropped \nfrom the suit while Elizabeth Delgado Santos and Rafael Ocasio Barreto were added.  Plaintiffs also asserted new \nclaims for violation of their equal protection rights under the Fifth Amendment (Defendants’ conduct has denied and \ncontinues to deny TSA evacuees from Puerto Rico equal protection under the law)(Count VI) and Discrimination in \nDisaster Assistance in violation of 28 U.S.C. §5151(a) and 44 C.F.R. § 7.3 (Count No. VII). Over the objection of \nthe Defendants, I have determined that for purposes of Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction, the First \nAmended Complaint is the operative document.    \n2 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 67   Filed 08/30/18   Page 3 of 25\ntemporary housing or find permanent housing. For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiffs’ request \nfor a preliminary injunction is denied.  \nFacts \nStatutory and Regulatory Background \n \nThe Stafford Act \n \n  The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. \n§§5121-5148 (“Stafford Act”), provides the statutory authority for the federal disaster response \nactivities of FEMA. Congress enacted the Stafford Act to provide “assistance by the Federal \nGovernment to State and local governments in carrying out their responsibilities to alleviate the \nsuffering and damage which result from [major] disasters.” Id. § 5121(b). The Stafford Act is \n“designed to assist the efforts of [States affected by major disasters] in expediting the rendering \nof aid, assistance, and emergency services, and the reconstruction and rehabilitation of \ndevastated areas.” Id. § 5121(a).  \n  The Stafford Act is triggered when the Governor of an affected State or Territory  \ndetermines that State and local resources are insufficient to respond to a disaster and asks the \nPresident to declare an area a “major disaster.” 42 U.S.C. § 5170. If the President declares a \n“major disaster” or emergency, he retains the discretion to determine and designate the type of \nassistance available and the areas eligible to receive assistance.  In any major disaster, the \nPresident may— \n(1) direct any Federal agency . . . to utilize its authorities and the resources \ngranted to it under Federal law . . . in support of State and local assistance efforts . \n. . [and] \n \n(4) assist State and local governments in the distribution of medicine, food, and \nother consumable supplies, and emergency assistance.;  \n \n  …. \n3 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 67   Filed 08/30/18   Page 4 of 25\n \nand may “provide assistance essential to meeting immediate threats to life and \nproperty” including emergency shelter.  \n \n 42 U.S.C. §§5170a , 5170b(a) and (a)(3)(B)(emphasis added). \n  In simpler terms, the President may authorize, among other things, various forms of \n“Public Assistance” directed at State and local governments to assist them in performing work to \nprevent immediate threats to life, as well as various forms of “Individual Assistance” that \nprovide assistance directly to individuals impacted by a disaster event. 42 U.S.C. §§ 5170–\n5189b. \n  FEMA is the federal agency the President has charged with implementing and carrying \nout major disaster assistance under the Stafford Act. Section 408 of the Stafford Act grants the \nPresident authority to provide temporary housing assistance to “individuals and households who \nare displaced from their predisaster primary residences or whose predisaster primary residences \nare rendered uninhabitable....” 42 U.S.C. § 5174(a)(1). Under section 408, the President, through \nFEMA, may provide two types of temporary housing assistance: (1) financial assistance, which \nis intended to pay for renting alternate housing accommodations; and (2) “temporary housing \nunits, acquired by purchase or lease, directly....” 42 U.S.C. § 5174(c)(1); see 44 C.F.R. §206.110.  \nFEMA has adopted regulations that set forth policies and procedures for determinations of \neligibility of applicants for public and individual assistance, eligibility of work, and eligibility of \ncosts for assistance under sections 402, 403, 406, 407, 408, 421(d), 502 and 503 of the Stafford \nAct, 42 U.S.C. §§ 5170a, 5170b, 5172, 5173, 5174, 5188, 5192 and 5193.  \n  The Stafford Act includes a limitation of liability provision which provides, in relevant \npart that:  \nThe Federal Government shall not be liable for any claim based upon the exercise \nor performance of or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or \n4 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 67   Filed 08/30/18   Page 5 of 25\nduty on the part of a Federal agency or an employee of the Federal Government in \ncarrying out the provisions of this chapter.  \n \n42 U.S.C § 5148.  \nTransitional Sheltering Assistance \n  TSA is a Public Assistance program authorized under section 403 of the Stafford Act.  \nThe governing provision states that “Federal agencies may on the direction of the President, \nprovide assistance essential to meeting immediate threats to life and property resulting from a \nmajor disaster...”   42 U.S.C. § 5170b(a).  More specifically, section 403 authorizes FEMA to \nprovide assistance for immediate threats, including emergency shelter. § 5170b(a)(3)(B). Such \nwork is typically executed by local governments or nonprofits through use of congregate \nshelters. TSA is also intended to provide sheltering assistance for survivors whose homes are \neither uninhabitable or inaccessible due to disaster-related damage. The goal of the program is to \nreduce the number of survivors housed in congregate shelters. TSA is a Public Assistance \nprogram provided through direct federal assistance.  Therefore, FEMA directly implements the \nsheltering assistance and the program is subject to a cost share with the requesting State or \nTerritory. See 42 U.S.C. §5170b(b). \n  As provided by regulation and FEMA’s internal policies, FEMA does not provide \nfinancial assistance through the TSA program directly to individuals. Before TSA can be \nimplemented, this form of assistance must be requested by the State or Territory, and the \napplicable Presidential declaration must include a section 403/502 –Category B (Emergency \nProtection Measures) and a section 408 designation, making those particular forms of assistance \navailable. The initial period of TSA assistance is typically 5 to 14 days from the date TSA is \nauthorized by FEMA’s Assistant Administrator for Disaster Assistance. The period of assistance \n5 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 67   Filed 08/30/18   Page 6 of 25\nmay be extended, in 14-day intervals, up to six months from the date of declaration upon request \nby the State. \n  Individuals and households may be considered eligible for TSA assistance if:  \n  •  The individual or household registers with FEMA for assistance;  \n  •  The individual or household passes identity verification;  \n  •  The individual or household’s pre-disaster primary residence is located in a  \n      geographic area designated for TSA;  \n  •  As a result of the disaster, the individual or household is displaced from the pre \n              -disaster primary residence; and \n \n  •  The individual or household is unable to obtain lodging through another  \n               source.  \n \n  FEMA’s internal policies further provide that transitional sheltering ends once the period \nof assistance interval expires unless there has been an extension requested by the State and \ngranted by FEMA in its discretion.  \nIndividual Assistance/Temporary Housing Assistance \n  Distinct from the section 403 TSA program is section 408 of the Stafford Act, which \nauthorizes FEMA to provide direct assistance to individuals and households in response to a \nmajor disaster or emergency declared by the President: \n [T]he President, in consultation with the Governor of a State,  \nmay provide financial assistance, and, if necessary, direct services, to individuals \nand households in the State who, as a direct result of a major disaster, have \nnecessary expenses and serious needs in cases in which the individuals and \nhouseholds are unable to meet such expenses or needs through other means. \n  \n42 U.S.C. § 5174(a)(1) (emphasis added).  So called “Individual Assistance” (“IA”) available \nunder section 408 may include, inter alia, financial assistance to rent alternative housing, \nassistance for repairs to or replacement of homes damaged or destroyed by the disaster, and \n6 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 67   Filed 08/30/18   Page 7 of 25\nfinancial assistance for disaster-related needs such as replacement of personal property. See 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 5174(c), (e).  \n  One form of IA is temporary housing assistance (“THA”), either in the form of financial \nassistance to “rent alternate housing accommodations, existing rental units, manufactured \nhousing, recreational vehicles, or other fabricated dwellings …  [and] may include the payment \nof the cost of utilities, excluding telephone service.” Id. §5174(c)(1)(A). Another form of THA is \ndirect assistance whereby temporary housing units such as trailers and mobile homes. Id. \n§5174(c)(1)(B).   \nHurricane Maria and its Aftermath \n  On September 20, 2017, Hurricane Maria, a Category 5 storm, made landfall on \nthe Caribbean island of Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States with over 3.4 million \nresidents. That same day, President Donald J. Trump issued a major disaster declaration for the \nisland. On October 25, 2017, the Governor of Puerto Rico formally requested that FEMA \nprovide TSA for Puerto Ricans displaced by Hurricane Maria.  Puerto Rico certified that it was \nresponsible for the non-Federal cost share of all FEMA direct Federal assistance delivered under \nthe Public Assistance program. On October 30, 2017, FEMA approved the request submitted by \nGovernor Roselló for section 403 TSA and provided Puerto Ricans displaced by Hurricane \nMaria short-term sheltering that lasted for an initial term of 75 days, beginning on October 31, \n2017 and ending on January 13, 2018.  \n  On December 23, 2017, at the request of the Governor, FEMA agreed to extend the TSA \nprogram through March 20, 2018, an additional 66 days. On March 8, 2018, again at the request \nof the Governor, FEMA agreed to further extend the TSA program through May 14, 2018, an \nadditional 55 days. On May 3, 2018, again at the request of the Governor, FEMA agreed to a \n7 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 67   Filed 08/30/18   Page 8 of 25\nfinal extension of the TSA program until June 30, 2018, an additional 47 days. In his letter \nseeking the request, Governor Roselló stated that he was seeking the extension, in part, so that \nthose receiving assistance could stay in the continental United States in a fixed location long \nenough for their children to finish the school year before returning to Puerto Rico.  Moreover, by \nJune 30, 2018, all of the congregate sheltering in Puerto Rico had closed. As of June 30, 2018, \nthe TSA program had provided support to Puerto Rico for 242 days. This Court has since \nordered that the TSA program be extended through August 31, 2018, an additional 62 days.  \n  At all times throughout the duration of the TSA program, Puerto Rico was informed and \nacknowledged that the TSA program is intended to provide “short-term sheltering.” When \nFEMA granted the third extension on May 3, 2018, FEMA stated to the Governor and to the \npublic that no further extensions of the program would be granted.  FEMA’s intended end date \nfor the TSA program aligned with the end of the 100% cost share between FEMA and Puerto \nRico, which was extended by the President  for 240 days from the disaster declaration and is now \na 90% FEMA/10% Puerto Rico share in the costs for certain types of “emergency work,” which \nincludes the TSA program. Therefore, effective June 30, 2018, Puerto Rico is responsible for \ncovering 10% of the cost of all emergency work, including the TSA program. Governor Roselló \ndid not request a further extension of the TSA program beyond the June 30, 2018 termination \ndate.  Any such extension would have been subject to the new cost-share arrangement.  \n  In total, 7,032 TSA eligible applicants checked into participating TSA hotels since the \ngenesis of the program. As of July 5, 2018, 1,006 eligible applicants remained at participating \nTSA hotels. To date, since the declaration disaster for Hurricane Maria, FEMA has disbursed \nover $2.4 billion in Public Assistance grants, over $1.1 billion for Individuals and Households, \nand over $92 million in implementing the TSA program.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 67   Filed 08/30/18   Page 9 of 25\nDiscussion  \nIn deciding a motion for a preliminary injunction, “a district court weighs four factors: (1) \nthe plaintiff's likelihood of success on the merits; (2) the potential for irreparable harm in the \nabsence of an injunction; (3) whether issuing an injunction will burden the defendants less than \ndenying an injunction would burden the plaintiffs; and (4) the effect, if any, on the public interest.”  \nJean v. Massachusetts State Police, 492 F.3d 24, 26–27 (1st Cir. 2007); Quincy Cablesystems, Inc. \nv. Sully’s Bar, Inc., 640 F. Supp. 1159, 1160 (D.Mass.1986).  \nLikelihood of Success on the Merits \nThe Defendants assert that Plaintiffs cannot show they are likely to succeed on the merits \nof their claims because (1) under the Stafford Act, FEMA is immune from all non-constitutional \nclaims, including Plaintiffs claims under the APA; (2) the Court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ \nclaims for injunctive relief because the government has not waived its sovereign immunity;(3) \nPlaintiffs’ procedural due process claims fails because they do not have a protected property \ninterest in continued TSA until such time as the obtain THA;  (4) Plaintiffs’ substantive due \nprocess claim fails because Plaintiffs do not have a recognized liberty or property interest in \nhousing and FEMA’s discontinuation of the TSA program does not shock the conscience,  (5) \nthe remedy which Plaintiffs seek, i.e., the implementation of FEMA’s Individuals and \nHouseholds Program, i.e., section 408 assistance, is already in place; and (6) Plaintiffs’ Equal \nProtection and discrimination claims were not part of their original complaint, or their \nemergency motion for a TRO or preliminary injunction and therefore, should not be considered \nby the Court. If they are considered, the claims fail because Plaintiffs cannot establish that there \nwere treated differently from applicants seeking relief in entirely different disasters, that is, since \n9 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 67   Filed 08/30/18   Page 10 of 25\nevery disaster is unique, they cannot establish that they are similarly situated to those other \napplicants. \nPlaintiffs’ Due Process Claims \nProcedural Due Process \nThe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees that the federal \ngovernment will not deprive its citizens of property without due process of law. U.S. Const. \namend. V. To prevail on their procedural due process claim, Plaintiffs must first establish that \nthey have a property interest in continued TSA, which is protected by the Constitution. “Property \ninterests are not created by the constitution itself. ‘Rather, they are created and their dimensions \nare defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source’ and ‘that \nsecure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.’”  Ridgely v. Fed. \nEmergency Mgmt. Agency, 512 F.3d 727, 735 (5th Cir.2008) (citation to quoted case omitted). \nGovernment benefit programs give rise to a property interest— but only when a claimant has an \nentitlement to the benefit: \nThe ‘mere existence of a governmental program or authority empowered \nto grant a particular type of benefit to one such as the plaintiff does not give the \nplaintiff a property right, protected by the due process clause, to receive the \nbenefit, absent some legitimate claim of entitlement—arising from statute, \nregulation, contract, or the like—to the benefit.”  \n \nId. (citation to quoted case omitted). \n \n  Plaintiffs assert they have a property interest in continued assistance under the TSA \nprogram protected by the Due Process Clause through either the Stafford Act and its regulations, \nor an independent source such as FEMA’s conduct in in administering the housing assistance \nprograms.  They also assert that because they were found eligible for assistance under the TSA \nprogram, they are “entitled” to THA benefits. FEMA, on the other hand, argues that the \n10 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 67   Filed 08/30/18   Page 11 of 25\nassistance provided to the Plaintiffs under the TSA program is not an entitlement— it is a \ndiscretionary benefit, which is not afforded protection under the Due Process Clause.  \nWhether the Stafford Act or Its Accompanying Regulations Create a Property Interest in \nContinued TSA Benefits \n  Plaintiffs assert that FEMA must continue the TSA program until such time as they \ntransition into longer-term THA because the enabling statute and regulations give them a claim \nof entitlement to such benefits (and therefore, create a property interest protected by the \nConstitution).  In support, Plaintiffs cite to Ass’n of Cmty. Orgs. For Reform Now, Inc. v. Fed. \nEmergency Mgmt. Agency, 463 F.Supp.2d 26 (D.C. D.C. 2006) in which the court granted \ninjunctive relief to thousands of evacuees of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita whose section 403 \nbenefits had been terminated and who also had been denied section 408 benefits.3 Specifically, \nthe court found that the plaintiffs/evacuees had “a protectable property right in the housing \nassistance administered by FEMA which cannot be deprived without due process of law.”  \nHowever, as pointed out by FEMA, that decision was appealed to the D.C. Circuit Court of \nAppeals and was, effectively, overturned. As part of its appeal, FEMA sought a stay of the of the \nlower court’s order requiring it to immediately reinstate section 403 TSA benefits and to pay \nTSA benefits that the evacuees would have been entitled to from September 1, 2006 (the date \nFEMA terminated the benefits) to November 30, 2006 (the date that the court issued its order \nrequiring FEMA to restore such benefits).  The D.C. Circuit granted the stay. See Ass’n of Cmty. \nOrganizations for Reform Now, Inc. v. Fed. Emergency Mgmt. Agency, No. 06-5403, 2006 WL \n                                                 \n  3 The evacuees had sought a TRO to prevent termination of their section 403 benefits, which was denied by \nthe court. However, the court strongly advised FEMA to keep the section 403 benefits in place until a final ruling \nissued on the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction.  Nonetheless, FEMA terminated all but 113 households \nand two of the named plaintiffs in that case—for them, FEMA extended assistance under the TSA program for thirty \nadditional days.     \n11 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 67   Filed 08/30/18   Page 12 of 25\n3847841, at *1 (D.D.C. Dec. 22, 2006).  In denying plaintiffs/appellees motion for \nreconsideration, the D.C. Circuit stated:  \nUpon reexamination of the parties’ submissions relating to the motion for stay, we \ndoubt plaintiff-appellees are likely to succeed on their claim that they have a \nproperty right to benefits under section 403, which FEMA has terminated and \nwhich the district court awarded as a remedy. Insofar as plaintiff-appellees claim \na property right in section 408 benefits, which they have neither received nor \nshown their eligibility for, we find it likely that Heckler v. Lopez, 463 U.S. 1328, \n104 S. Ct. 10, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1431 (1983), prevents this court from upholding the \ndistrict court's injunction. \nAss’n of Cmty. Orgs. for Reform NOW, Inc. v. Fed. Emergency Mgmt. Agency, 2007 U.S. App. \nLEXIS 929, *1-2 (D..D.C. Jan. 16, 2007).  The injunction was ultimately vacated after the appeal \nwas voluntarily dismissed. See Ass’n. of  Cmty. Orgs. for Reform Now, Inc. v. Fed. Emergency \nMgmt. Agency, No. 06-5403, 2007 US App Lexis 929 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 30, 2007).4 While the D.C. \nCircuit’s per curiam unpublished opinion cannot be cited as binding precedent, it does \nundermine Plaintiffs’ reliance on the district court’s Acorn ruling. Plaintiffs’ suggestion that the \nD.C. Circuit was addressing the court’s authority to reinstate benefits as opposed to terminating \nthem as in this case, is a distinction without meaning.   \n  More to the point, Plaintiffs’ argument is undermined by the express language of sections \n403 and 408 of the Stafford Act, which speak in discretionary terms, not absolutes: “Federal \nagencies may on the direction of the President, provide assistance essential to meeting immediate \nthreats to life and property resulting from a major disaster...”   42 U.S.C. § 5170b(a)(emphasis \nadded).  Likewise, section 408 contains a permissive grant of authority to FEMA to provide \nassistance, “the President, in consultation with the Governor of a State, may provide financial \n                                                 \n  4 As previously noted, in support of their argument that they have a property interest in section 403 \nbenefits, Plaintiffs cited to the district court’s ruling in Acorn granting injunctive relief to the plaintiffs/evacuees.  \nCounsel for the Plaintiffs now acknowledge that the injunction was vacated by the D.C. Circuit. I accept counsels’ \nrepresentation that they were unaware of the D.C. Circuit’s opinion, which was unpublished, and did not mean to \nmislead the Court. \n12 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 67   Filed 08/30/18   Page 13 of 25\nassistance, and, if necessary, direct services, to individuals and households in the State who, as a \ndirect result of a major disaster, have necessary expenses and serious needs in cases in which the \nindividuals and households are unable to meet such expenses or needs through other means.” 42 \nU.S.C. § 5174(a)(1)(emphasis added).  In interpreting these provisions, this Court is not writing \non a clean slate. As other courts have held, neither the language of the Stafford Act nor the \nimplementing regulations use mandatory language. See, e.g., Ridgely, 512 F.3d at 735-36; see \nalso Pride v. FEMA, Civ. No. 1:1CV22-HSO-JMR, 2013 WL 6048153 (like section 408 \nfinancial assistance benefits, section 408 direct housing benefits are discretionary and therefore, \nthere is not constitutionally protected property interest in receiving such benefits); Cf. \nKonashenko v. Fed. Emergency Mgmt. Agency, No. 12-CV-3034 SJF WDW, 2014 WL 1761346, \nat *8 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 29, 2014)(since FEMA had discretion to decide whether to award plaintiff \nfunds for the sea wall destroyed by Tropical Storm Irene, she had no reasonable expectation that \nshe would get the benefit, and therefore, there is no protected property interest in the benefits \nthemselves).   \n  Plaintiffs point out that section 403 does not include a termination date for benefits—\nsuggesting that Congress thus intended that once granted, TSA continues until such time as the \napplicant is transitioned into THA.  However, as the Ridgely court stated with respect to an \nanalogous argument regarding continued entitlement to section 408 assistance: “it is unsurprising \nthat no termination provision can be found in section 408 or the regulations, as such a provision \nwould only be necessary if there were a stream of benefits to terminate.” Id., at 739. Similarly, \ngiven that section 403 and its regulations do not mandate that assistance be provided indefinitely \nonce awarded, or at least until the applicant is transition into the THA program, there is no need \nfor a termination provision.    \n13 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 67   Filed 08/30/18   Page 14 of 25\n   \n   \n  I agree with FEMA that Plaintiffs’ assertion that they have an entitlement to continued \nTSA benefits is even more tenuous in this case than in Ridgely, which is a factually similar case. \nIn this case, the Governor of Puerto Rico has not requested that assistance under the TSA \nprogram be extended.5  I find this of importance given how the program is structured.6  Unlike \nsection 408 benefits, the TSA program is a Public Assistance program, that is, FEMA is \nproviding assistance to Puerto Rico, not the individual Plaintiffs. While the federal government \ninitially pays 100% of the costs associated with the program, as of June 30, 2018, Puerto Rico is \nrequired to pay 10% of the costs, while the federal government continues to pay 90%. This \namount is set by the President and cannot be altered.  Thus, should this Court find that the \nPlaintiffs are entitled to continued TSA benefits, it would be requiring Puerto Rico to incur \nmonetary obligations which it to date, it has not agreed to take on. While it is not clear to me that \nthis result should play a factor in the analysis of whether Plaintiffs have an entitlement to \ncontinued TSA benefits, I agree with FEMA that it at least raises the question of whether the \nPlaintiffs themselves have a legitimate “claim” to such benefits-- particularly in light of the \n                                                 \n  5 Plaintiffs’ counsel represented at the hearing that media reports establish that since this case commenced, \nthe Governor of Puerto Rico has repeatedly stated that he is in favor of the TSA benefits being extended.  While I \nhave no reason to doubt counsel’s representation, on the record before me, the Governor has not officially requested \nthat the TSA program be continued. \n  6 I agree with Plaintiffs that 44 C.F.R. § 206.255 does not necessarily require a state or local official to \nsubmit a request for continued assistance under section 403. However, FEMA also relies on its internal policy, in \nparticular its Public Assistance and Policy Guide (“PAPPG”), in support of its contention that extension of TSA \nbenefits in this case requires a request from the Governor of Puerto Rico. First, FEMA’s policy to require an express \nrequest for TSA benefits makes sense given that the cost sharing arrangement mandated under section 403 and its \nregulations, discussed infra.  Additionally, Plaintiffs’ argument that the PAPPG itself does not require the Governor \nof Puerto Rico to seek an extension because nowhere in the policy does it require that such a request be made by the \n“governor” is specious. The PAPPG requires that “State, Territorial, Tribal, and local government Applicants” must \nsubmit a request for funding for non-congregate environments (such as hotels). See Id., at pp. 66-67. Given that the \n“applicant” is a governmental entity, in this case a Territory, the person making the request must necessarily be the \nGovernor, or someone else with authority to bind it.  \n \n14 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 67   Filed 08/30/18   Page 15 of 25\npreviously cited authority finding that there is no protected property interest in section 408 \nbenefits, which are paid directly to disaster victims. \n  For the reasons stated above, I find that the Plaintiffs have not established they have a \nprotected interest in receipt of TSA benefits under the Stafford Act and its accompanying \nregulations. Furthermore, that the Plaintiffs have been deemed eligible for assistance under the \nTSA program does not create a property interest in continued assistance under that program. Cf. \nRidgley, 512 F,3d at 736 (given that section 408 and the regulations do not provide entitlement to \nfinancial assistance, that plaintiffs were previously found eligible for assistance is of no matter). \nAdditionally, I find the Ridgley court’s reasoning persuasive in denying Plaintiffs’ assertion that \nthey have a property interest in obtaining section 408 benefits. \nWhether Plaintiffs have a Property Interest in continued assistance under the TSA Program as a \nresult of  FEMA’s Conduct in in administering the Program \n \n  Plaintiffs’ assertion that FEMA’s conduct and actions have created an expectation of \ncontinued TSA benefits fares no better.  More specifically, Plaintiffs assert that FEMA’s policies \nand practices in regards to carrying out the TSA program creates a property interest in their \ncontinued receipt of TSA, until such time as they are transitioned into the THA program. \nPlaintiffs acknowledge that on the record before me, there is insufficient evidence to make a \ndetermination on this claim.  Plaintiffs, therefore, ask the Court continue the TRO and grant a \nperiod of fact finding followed by an evidentiary hearing.  I agree with the Plaintiffs that on this \nrecord, they have not established a likelihood of success on the merits this issue. On the contrary, \nthe rules and regulations cited by the Defendants establish that FEMA requires certification from \nthe State, Territory or local government whose citizens seek initial or continuing disaster relief.  \nMoreover, those policies and regulations make clear that the disaster relief does not continue \nindefinitely, but rather is terminated when FEMA, in its discretion, determines that assistance is \n15 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 67   Filed 08/30/18   Page 16 of 25\nno longer necessary. It is possible that further discovery will shed light on FEMA’s practices and \npolicies sufficient to permit the Plaintiffs to raise a triable issue as to whether such policies and \npractices create a property interest in continued TSA. However, Plaintiffs have failed to establish \non the record as is, or to convince the Court that upon obtaining such further discovery, they are \nlikely to success on the merits of this claim. 7  \n  I find that the Plaintiffs have failed to establish that they have a protected property \ninterest under sections 403 and 408 of the Stafford Act. For that reason, it is not necessary for me \nto address their assertion that the notices they have received (to the extent that they have received \nnotice) are inadequate— primarily because the notices do not provide any information regarding \ntheir right to appeal, or their right to housing or transitional assistance. For the reasons stated, I \nfind that Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their procedural due process claim.  \nSubstantive Due Process \n  Like their procedural due process claim, to state a claim for violation of their substantive \ndue process rights, Plaintiffs must first establish that they have “a valid property interest in a \nbenefit that was entitled to constitutional protection… .”   Konashenko, 2014 WL 1761346, at \n*10; see also Centro Medico del Turabo, Inc. v. Feliciano de Melecio, 406 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. \n2005)(as in procedural due process context, plaintiff must, as a condition precedent to stating a \nclaim, identify a constitutionally protected interest in life, liberty or property). I have previously \n                                                 \n  7 Plaintiffs’ request that the Court extend the TRO while further discovery and an evidentiary hearing is \nconducted on this issue is based on their reading of the Fifth Circuit’s ruling in Ridgley.  I agree with the Plaintiffs \nthat the Fifth Circuit recognized that FEMA’s policies and procedures could create a property interest in continued \nbenefits under section 408; the court remanded the case for the parties to conduct discovery on that issue and for the \ndistrict court to hold an evidentiary hearing. However, in doing so, the court vacated the lower court’s grant of a \npreliminary injunction in favor of the plaintiffs, which ordered that FEMA continue rental assistance for victims of \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita, because it found that the plaintiffs had not established a likelihood of success on the \nmerits. Likewise, I find that the Plaintiffs are entitled to further develop this claim, however, given that I do not find \nthat, even accepting their arguments, they have shown a likelihood of success on the merits, the TRO shall not \nremain in place. \n16 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 67   Filed 08/30/18   Page 17 of 25\nfound that Plaintiffs have failed to establish that they have a property interests in continuing \nbenefits under section 403 and/or obtaining benefits under section 408 of the Stafford Act. \nTherefore, their substantive due process claim also fails. Moreover, “[t]o establish a substantive \ndue process claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate an ‘abuse of government power that shocks the \nconscience’ or ‘action that is legally irrational in that it is not sufficiently keyed to any legitimate \nstate interests.’” Collins v. Nuzzo, 244 F.3d 246, 250 (1st Cir. 2001).  Little need be said on this \nissue, simply put, Plaintiffs cannot establish that FEMA’s discontinuance of their TSA benefits \n“shocks the conscience,” for substantive due process purposes, see Avalos v. City of Glenwood, \n382 F.3d 792, 800 (8th Cir. 2004)(actionable substantive due process claims involve a “ ‘level of \n... abuse of power’ ... ‘so “brutal” and “offensive” that [they do] not comport with traditional \nideas of fair play and decency), or  is “legally irrational in that it is not keyed to any legitimate \n[government] interest.” See Amsden v. Moran, 904 F.2d 748, 754 n.5 (1st Cir. 1990). Therefore, \nPlaintiffs request for injunctive relief based on their claim for violation of their substantive due \nprocess rights is denied. \nPlaintiffs’ Equal Protection Claims \n  Plaintiffs assert that the Defendants have violated their right to equal protection of the \nlaws by discriminating against them on the basis of race, national origin and kind of American \ncitizenship by providing a lesser level of housing assistance because they are Puerto Rican8.  The \nEqual Protection Clause of the Constitution requires that all persons similarly situated be treated \nin the same manner. In order to establish a violation of the Equal Protection Clause, a plaintiff \nmust “show both (1) that they were treated differently from other similarly situated individuals, \nand (2) that such differential treatment was based on ‘impermissible considerations such as \n                                                 \n  8 Defendants have cited authority questioning whether “Puerto Ricans” are a protected class.  For purposes \nof this Order, I assume that they are a protected class.  \n17 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 67   Filed 08/30/18   Page 18 of 25\nrace… .’” Harlen Assocs. v. Inc Village of Mineola, 273 F.3d 494, 499 (2d Cir. 2001)(citation to \nquoted case omitted). “Conclusory allegations of selective treatment are insufficient to state a \nclaim. Rather, a plaintiff must allege purposeful and systematic discrimination by specifying \ninstances in which [the plaintiff] [was] singled ... out for unlawful oppression in contrast to \nothers similarly situated.’” Id. at 573 (internal quotation marks and citation to quoted case \nomitted). Laday v. Ramada Plaza Hotel Laguardia, No. 07-CV-0450 (BMC), 2007 WL 526613, \nat *4 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 13, 2007).  \nThe formula for determining whether individuals or entities are ‘similarly \nsituated’ for equal protection purposes is not always susceptible to precise \ndemarcation. See [Coyne v. City of Somerville, 972 F.2d 440, 444–45 (1st Cir. \n1991)] (“[T]he ‘line between sufficient facts and insufficient conclusions is often \nblurred.’ ”) … [H]owever, ‘[t]he test is whether a prudent person, looking \nobjectively at the incidents, would think them roughly equivalent and the \nprotagonists similarly situated. Much as in the lawyer’s art of distinguishing \ncases, the ‘relevant aspects’ are those factual elements which determine whether \nreasoned analogy supports, or demands, a like result. Exact correlation is neither \nlikely nor necessary, but the cases must be fair congeners. In other words, apples \nshould be compared to apples.’ \nBarrington Cove Ltd. P’ship v. Rhode Island Hous. & Mortg. Fin. Corp., 246 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. \n2001). \n  Plaintiffs have cited to what they claim are “stark differences” in FEMA’s treatment of \nvictims of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma versus its treatment of Puerto Rican victims of Hurricane \nMaria.  More specifically, they allege that Hurricane Harvey and Irma victims received seven \nextensions of TSA benefits whereas Plaintiffs received only three, which amounted to two \nmonths of additional benefits to victims of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. They also cite to the \nfact that FEMA had approved over twenty-two times the amount of financial assistance for \nvictims of Hurricane Harvey as it did in the same amount of time for victims of Hurricane Maria.  \nHowever, Plaintiffs fail to address how the three hurricanes impacted the areas which were \naffected, what the amount of property damage from the three storms and the overall financial \n18 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 67   Filed 08/30/18   Page 19 of 25\nimpact on the affected areas.  Plaintiffs do acknowledge, but then downplay the fact that there \nwere twice as many people impacted by Hurricane Harvey (7.6 million) than were impacted by \nHurricane Maria (3.8 million), and over six times as many people were affected by Hurricane \nIrma (19.3 million). Moreover, as pointed out by FEMA, every disaster is unique and requires \ndifferent responses.  For example, Hurricanes Harvey and Irma hit the mainland, while Hurricane \nMaria hit Puerto Rico, which is an island and is more logistically difficult to reach and assess. \nFEMA also points out that the damage sustained in each hurricane varied: Hurricane Harvey \ncaused mostly flooding damage while Hurricane Maria caused mostly wind damage. These are \nonly some difference which undermine Plaintiffs’ equal protection claim—Defendants’ \nSupplemental Brief (Docket No. 56) details many more.  Simply put, as the record currently \nstands, Plaintiffs have failed to make out a viable equal protection claim because they have not \nestablished either that they were similarly situated to other hurricane victims, and even if they \nwere, that they were treated differently. Therefore, I finds that they are unable to establish a \nlikelihood of success on the merits with respect to their Equal Protection Clause claim.9 \nPlaintiffs’ Discrimination Claim \n  Plaintiffs assert that as Puerto Ricans, they have been discriminated against under the \nStafford Act in violation of 42 US.C. §5151(a) (barring discrimination based on race, color, \nreligion, nationality, sex, age, disability, English proficiency, or economic status.)  I agree with \nDefendants that in their initial briefing of this claim, Plaintiffs, at best, make conclusory \nallegations that discontinuance of the TSA program constitutes discrimination against them \n                                                 \n  9 In their First Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs raise both a disparate treatment and a disparate impact \nclaims.  However, in their memorandum, they brief only the disparate treatment claim.  Therefore, I find that for \npurposes of their motion for preliminary injunction, they have waived their disparate impact claim.    \n19 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 67   Filed 08/30/18   Page 20 of 25\nbased on their race, color, English proficiency, or economic status.10 In their supplemental \nmemorandum, they allege that they have been the victims of disparate treatment.  They then \nassert that based on their allegations set forth in the First Amended Complaint, they have made a \nprima facie case of disparate treatment and therefore, the burden shifts to the Defendants to \nestablish, through admissible evidence, that the allegedly unlawful action was taken for a \nlegitimate non-discriminatory reason. If the Defendants do so, they assert that the burden then \nshifts back to them to show that the Defendants’ proffered reasons are pre-textual.11   \n  In asserting that they have made out a prima facie case, Plaintiffs cite to the same \nallegations made in their equal protection claim: that Hurricane Harvey victims’ benefits under \nthe TSA program have been extended 7 times to their 3— which amounts to two additional \nmonths, and that financial assistance to Hurricane Harvey was approved much more quickly and \nat a much higher amount.  Given the differences in the disasters, including the number of people \nand the amount of property affected, the type of damage and the logistical differences in the \nlocations where the hurricanes hit, I have grave concerns that the Plaintiffs have made out a \nprima facie case, despite the low threshold for doing so. Assuming they have, FEMA has \nrebutted their claims by providing detailed evidence regarding the scope of damage caused by \nHurricanes Harvey and Rita versus the scope of the damage to Puerto Rico, the difference in the \ntype of damage, the difference in the number of persons affected and the logistical difficulties as \n                                                 \n  10 In their initial briefing of this claim, Plaintiffs simply made a conclusory statement that for the same \nreasons they should prevail on the equal protection claim, they are likely to succeed this claim.  It is not until there \nsupplemental brief filed after the hearing that Plaintiffs flesh out this argument. As pointed out by the Defendants, \nPlaintiffs have failed to raise a number of legal arguments in their initial briefs—instead, they have routinely chosen \nto make new arguments and cite new authority in their reply or supplemental briefs. Generally, I do not address \nmatters raised for the first time in supplemental pleadings, however, given the importance of the issues raised by the \nPlaintiffs, I have done so in this case.  Should Plaintiffs appeal this decision, I strongly suggest that they be more \ndiligent in regards to their briefing to the First Circuit, which strictly enforces the rule that arguments raised for the \nfirst time in a reply brief are deemed waived.      \n  11 For purposes of this Order, I will accept Plaintiffs assumption that the McDonnell Douglas burden \nshifting analysis applies to this claim. See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817 (1973). \n20 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 67   Filed 08/30/18   Page 21 of 25\nthe result of Puerto Rico being an island located well off the United States mainland.  FEMA has \nalso provided a breakdown of the amount of financial assistance given to Texas (Harvey), \nFlorida (Irma) and Puerto Rico (Maria), which establish that aid to Puerto Rico has been in line \nwith the aid provided to Texas and Florida. Additionally, I do not discount the fact that FEMA \nterminated the Plaintiffs’ TSA, at least in part, because the Governor of Puerto Rico did not seek \nan extension beyond June 30, 2018. The burden thus falls on the Plaintiffs to establish that the \nDefendants’ reasons are pre-textual.  Plaintiffs argue that if I find that the Defendants have met \ntheir burden (as I have), they should be allowed to file a supplemental brief for purposes of \nestablishing pretext.  While Plaintiffs will have the opportunity to develop their claim going \nforward, whether they are entitled to an injunction is based on the record before me as it \ncurrently stands.  Based on that record, I cannot find that they have established a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits of this claim.12 \nPlaintiffs’ APA Claims \n  Plaintiffs assert that Defendants conduct violates the following provisions of the APA: \n(1) section 706(2)(B), because FEMA’s termination of the TSA program as to them is contrary to \nlaw; and (2) section 706(2)(A) because FEMA’s termination of the TSA program as to them \nwithout any plan to transition them into the THA program is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion and otherwise not in accordance with law. Additionally, Plaintiffs assert that pursuant \nto section 706(1), the Court should compel FEMA to continue the TSA program as to them until \nit provides eligible evacuees sufficient THA housing.  Defendants argue that this Court should \n                                                 \n  12 In support of many of their claims, Plaintiffs cite to McWaters v. Fed. Emergency Mgmt. Agency, 436 F. \nSupp.2d 802, 816 (E.D. La. 2006), in which the court found a protectable property interest in THA benefits because \nit determined that once an applicant was deemed eligible, FEMA did not have the discretion to deny assistance; the \ncourt also found that FEMA’s discretion was further limited by the Stafford Act’s non-discrimination  provision.  \nHowever, it has been widely recognized that the holding in McWaters has been abrogated by the Fifth Circuit’s \nruling in Ridgely.  \n \n21 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 67   Filed 08/30/18   Page 22 of 25\ndeny Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief under the APA for lack of jurisdiction because, as to \nthese non-constitutional claims, there has been no wavier of sovereign immunity.  \n  When bringing suit against the United States or its agencies, a plaintiff must establish that \nthe United States has waived sovereign immunity with respect to its claims. FDIC v. Meyer, 510 \nU.S. 471, 475, 114 S.Ct. 996 (1994) (“Absent a waiver, sovereign immunity shields the Federal \nGovernment and its agencies from suit.”). “A waiver of the Federal Government’s sovereign \nimmunity must be unequivocally expressed in statutory text.” Lane v. Pena, 518 U.S. 187, 192, \n116 S.Ct. 2092 (1996).  I find the Defendants well written and comprehensive discussion of the \nissue of sovereign immunity compelling and on point and therefore, adopt it in toto.   In so \ndoing, I reiterate my previous finding that FEMA’s actions under the Stafford Act with respect to \ngranting both the section 403 and 408 assistance are discretionary.  The Stafford Act’s \ndiscretionary function exception to governmental liability provides that the United States will not \nbe liable for: \n[A]ny claim based upon the exercise or performance of or the failure to exercise \nor perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a Federal agency or an \nemployee of the Federal Government in carrying out the provisions of this \nchapter.  \n \n42 U.S.C. § 5148.  This discretionary funding exception encompasses FEMA’s decision to \nterminate the TSA program as to the Plaintiffs and this Court lacks jurisdiction to address \nPlaintiffs’ APA claims. Accord St. Tammany Par., ex rel. Davis v. Fed. Emergency Mgmt. \nAgency, 556 F.3d 307, 325–26 (5th Cir. 2009)(Stafford Act, its regulations, and related agency \nguidance do not give rise to mandatory duty. They instead permit discretionary, policy-oriented \nchoices that cannot be basis for the court's subject matter jurisdiction).  Therefore, Plaintiffs are \nnot entitled to injunctive relief based on such APA claims. \n22 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 67   Filed 08/30/18   Page 23 of 25\n  I have found that Plaintiffs have failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits \nof any of their substantive claims. Under these circumstances, I find that they are unlikely to \nprevail on their claim for a declaratory judgment. \nRisk of Irreparable Harm \n“Only a viable threat of serious harm which cannot be undone authorizes exercise of a \ncourt’s equitable power to enjoin before the merits are fully determined.”  Massachusetts Coal. of \nCitizens with Disabilities v. Civil Def. Agency & Office of Emergency Preparedness of Com. of \nMassachusetts, 649 F.2d 71, 74 (1st Cir. 1981) (citing Parks v. Dunlop, 517 F.2d 785 (5th Cir. \n1975)).  “A preliminary injunction will not be issued simply to prevent a mere possibility of injury. \nA presently existing, actual threat must be shown.”  Id.   \nAlthough Defendants attempt to do so, there can be no serious dispute in this case that the \nPlaintiffs have established irreparable harm. The Plaintiffs are evacuees from a catastrophic natural \ndisaster13 in which they have lost most, if not all, of their real and personal property and been \nforced to locate to areas thousands of miles away.  At this point, the Plaintiffs and other potential \nclass members who have not been transitioned into the THA program do not appear to have any \nplace to go once the TSA program ends. \nBalance of Equities \nThe balance of hardships also tips considerably in favor of the Plaintiffs.  I agree with the \nPlaintiffs that they will suffer disproportionate hardship given that to date, they have not been able \nto secure alternative housing and therefore, may well be rendered homeless. \n   \n                                                 \n  13 Puerto Rico’s death toll from Hurricane Maria has recently been revised to 2,975, making it one of the \ndeadlines national disasters in United States history, \n23 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 67   Filed 08/30/18   Page 24 of 25\nPublic Interest \nThe public interest is a more neutral factor. As the Defendants point out, it is in FEMA’s \ninterest to maximize the resources for providing assistance to the public during national disasters. \nIt is also in the public interest that FEMA be allowed to act in accordance with its statutory \nmandate.  At the same time, as pointed out by the Plaintiff, there is a strong public interest in \nhelping to provide for the well-being of its citizens, particularly those who have been victims of \nnatural disasters.   \nPlaintiffs Request for Preliminary Injunction is Denied \nWhile there are factors that weigh in the Plaintiffs’ favor, I have found that they are unlikely \nto succeed on the merits of any of their claims. Given that likelihood of success on the merits is \nthe touchstone of the preliminary injunction inquiry, their request for injunctive relief is denied.  \nWhile this is the result that I am compelled to find, it is not necessarily the right result.  However, \nthe Court cannot order that Defendants to do that which in a humanitarian and caring world should \nbe done-- it can only order the Defendants to do that which the law requires. \nConclusion \n  Plaintiffs’ Emergency Motion for A Temporary Restraining Order Or Preliminary \nInjunction And Declaratory Relief (Docket No. 2) is denied as to their request for a preliminary \ninjunction.  By its terms, the TRO has been extended until August 31, 2018.  While by my Order \nI am vacating the TRO, Plaintiffs and the other evacuees will need time to make alternative \nhousing arrangements.  Therefore, I am ordering that the Defendants and their agents refrain \nfrom terminating the program which provides the payment for shelter for the Plaintiffs (including \nthe class) until midnight September 13, 2018 (i.e., enabling Plaintiffs and the class to stay until \ncheckout time on September 14, 2018).  I strongly urge the parties to work together to find \n24 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 67   Filed 08/30/18   Page 25 of 25\ntemporary housing, or other assistance to the Plaintiffs and other members of the class prior to \nthat date. \n \n  \nSo Ordered: \n \n   \n                /s/ Timothy S.

In \nMay, FEMA announced that as of June 30, 2018, it would discontinue Transitional Shelter \nAssistance (“TSA”) for such evacuees.1 The Plaintiffs have filed suit against the Defendants \nseeking to prevent the termination of benefits under the TSA program for themselves and other \nsimilarly situated persons. In their original Complaint (Docket No. 1), they asserted claims for \nrelief for Deprivation of their Fifth Amendment Due Process Rights (Count I), and Violation of \n                                                 \n  1 In simple terms, the TSA program provides direct funding to hotels and motels, which serve as shelters \nfor individuals and families who are forced to evacuate their damaged or destroyed homes due to a natural disaster.  \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 63   Filed 08/22/18   Page 2 of 3\nthe Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(A), (B), 5 U.S. C. § 706(1)(Counts II-IV). \nPlaintiffs also seek a Declaratory Judgment (Count V). On June 30, 3018, Judge Sorokin entered \na Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO”), which I thereafter continued until July 23, 2018 \n(allowing the Plaintiffs and the class to stay until checkout time on July 24, 2018) to give the \nparties an opportunity to fully brief the important and complex issues raised by Plaintiffs’ \nComplaint and corresponding motion for preliminary injunction. See Continuation of Temporary \nRestraining Order, dated July 3, 2018 (Docket No. 19). After reviewing the parties’ submissions, \nI set the matter down for hearing today, August 1, 2018 and extended the TRO until August 6, \n2018 (allowing the Plaintiffs and the class to stay until checkout time on August 7, 2018). See \nSecond Continuation of Temporary Restraining Order, Dated July 19, 2108 (Docket No. 38). \n  On July 12, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint, as of right (Docket No. 28) \nin which named Plaintiffs Alian Asencio, Aracelis Velez Cruz, Denise Nieves, Yaritza De Jesus \nLopez, Rosa Rivera, and Angel Lauriano Muñoz De Jesus were dropped from the suit while \nElizabeth Delgado Santos and Rafael Ocasio Barreto were added.  Plaintiffs also asserted new \nclaims for violation of their equal protection rights under the Fifth Amendment (Defendants’ \nconduct has denied and continues to deny TSA evacuees from Puerto Rico equal protection \nunder the law)(Count VI), and Discrimination in Disaster Assistance in violation of 28 U.S.C. \n§5151(a) and 44 C.F.R. § 7.3 (Count No. VII). \n   By its terms, the TRO, as in effect and continued from time to time, addressed only the \nclaims raised by the Plaintiffs under the original Complaint. In their response to the \nGovernment’s memorandum in opposition to continued injunctive relief and at the preliminary \ninjunction hearing, the Plaintiffs sought to have the Court consider whether a preliminary \ninjunction is warranted based on the totality of their claims, including those raised in the First \n2 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 63   Filed 08/22/18   Page 3 of 3\nAmended Complaint.  Rather than have the Plaintiffs file a subsequent TRO based on their new \nclaims, I informed the parties that I would consider the new claims asserted in the First Amended \nComplaint. I granted the Government’s request for additional time to address those claims and  \norally informed the parties that I was extending the TRO until August 31, 2018.  I expect to issue \nmy Order by that date. Accordingly, the TRO entered by Judge Sorokin remains in place until \nleast midnight August 31, 2018 (i.e., enabling Plaintiffs and the class to stay until checkout time \non September 1, 2018).  \n \n  \nSo Ordered: \n \n  Dated: August 22, 2018         /s/ Timothy S.

Sorokin: ELECTRONIC ORDER entered With Regard to 2 Motion for TRO. Plaintiffs filed a complaint\ntoday along with an emergency motion for a TRO. The Court has provided counsel for the United States copies of the pleadings\nand held a telephone hearing this evening with counsel for the government and the plaintiffs. The standard for issuance of an\ninjunction is the familiar four part test. The irreparable harm to the plaintiffs is obvious and overwhelming tomorrow morning\nthey will be evicted and homeless since by definition each plaintiffs home was rendered uninhabitable by the hurricane in\nPuerto Rico, a determination previously made by the defendants. The public interest on balance favors the plaintiffs both in\nterms of their personal interests and considering the specter of many sick individuals without homes of their own being\nrendered homeless with the resulting drain on other public resources in addition to the possible human consequences. The\nsubstantially closer question is whether Plaintiffs have established a likelihood of success on the merits of one or more of their\nlegal claims. The Plaintiffs in their papers and at the hearing have articulated, at least, claims that they are entitled to (1)\nreasonable notice of the termination of the temporary housing assistance; (2) assistance as long as they remain eligible; and (3)\nassistance in transition to other housing. In addition, they assert that FEMA in prior roughly equivalent disasters has extended\nthe temporary housing assistance substantially longer than in the present disaster. On the record before the Court, which is\nadmittedly limited in that the government has had only the most limited opportunity to respond, the Plaintiffs have\ndemonstrated a sufficient likelihood of success to warrant an limited temporary restraining order under the totality of the\ncircumstances and the governing law. Specifically, the affidavits from counsel show deficiencies in notice and transition\nassistance. Whether that evidentiary showing prevails on a fuller record is not now necessary to decide. Accordingly, the Court\n(1) ENJOINS the Defendants and their agents from terminating the Temporary Housing Assistance program which provides the\npayment for shelter for the plaintiffs (including the class) until at least midnight July 3, 2018 (i.e. enabling Plaintiffs and the\nclass to stay until checkout time on July 4, 2018); (2) ORDERS Defendants and their agents to provide notice and take\nwhatever action is necessary to extend the assistance until the aforementioned deadline; and (3) SCHEDULES a telephone\nhearing on this matter before Judge Hillman on Monday July 2, 2018 at 12:45 p.m. This ruling is WITHOUT PREJUDICE to\nany rulings by Judge Hillman. At the hearing before Judge Hillman counsel for plaintiffs ought be prepared to address with\nmore specificity, inter alia, the specific nature and basis for the right to notice, the nature and basis of the right to ongoing\nhousing assistance, the nature and basis for the right to transition assistance, and the legal significance, if any, of the different\ndurations of housing assistance programs. Counsel for the government ought be prepared to address, inter alia, (on Monday or\nsuch further time as requested by the government) the lack of basis for the foregoing issues. Nothing in this outline limits or\nprecludes the parties from raising issues fairly within the pleadings or appropriate defenses. The Clerk will provide call in\ninformation for the call on Monday. The undersigned has addressed this motion as the emergency district judge. /s/ Leo T.\nSorokin, United States District Judge.

Plaintiffs Alian Asencio, Aracelis Velez Cruz, Denise Nieves, Yaritza de Jesus \nLopez, Rosa Rivera, Angel Lauriano Muñoz de Jesus, Bethzaida Crespo Vicente, and Iris Otero \n(collectively, “Plaintiffs”), by and through their undersigned attorneys, bring this complaint \nagainst the Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”), William Brock Long, Thomas \nVan Essen, and Alejandro De La Campa, on behalf of themselves and all similarly situated \nindividuals.   \nI. \nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n2.  This is an action to (a) hold unlawful and set aside certain agency actions of the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”), the federal agency charged by statute to \ncare for Americans who are victims of natural disasters; and (b) compel FEMA to take other \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 1   Filed 06/30/18   Page 2 of 29\naction that it has unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.  Contrary to its charge, FEMA is \nplanning to prematurely abort its assistance to thousands of Puerto Ricans displaced by \nHurricane Maria.  FEMA has announced that on June 30, 2018, it will arbitrarily, capriciously, \nand unlawfully discontinue its Transitional Shelter Assistance (“TSA”), which provides direct \nfunding to hotels and motels, which serve as shelters for thousands of individuals and families \nwho were forced to evacuate the island of Puerto Rico because the hurricane severely damaged \nor destroyed their homes.  FEMA’s refusal to extend TSA is without any plan for transitioning \ninto longer-term housing some 2,000 individuals who have already faced severe trauma and lost \nmost, if not all, of their belongings, their homes and their jobs.  For Plaintiffs and many other \nTSA evacuees, especially the poor, elderly and sick, returning to their homes (or what is left of \ntheir homes) in Puerto Rico is not a viable option.   \n3.  Through the TSA program, hotels and motels across the mainland United States \nhave become the temporary homes of these evacuees, who, as of June 30, 2018, will become \nhomeless.  By discontinuing the TSA program, FEMA is knowingly withholding desperately \nneeded support to these marginalized American citizens, putting TSA evacuees at risk of \nhomelessness and other irreparable injury.  Indeed, the evacuees will be ripped from their homes \nyet again—not by a natural disaster, but by a manmade one created by the federal agency \ncharged with disaster relief.   \n4.  This action, therefore, is brought by eight named plaintiffs, on their own behalf \nand on behalf of a class of people similarly situated, seeking an order that FEMA obey the laws \nput into place to address the problems associated with disasters such as Hurricane Maria, and \ncontinue FEMA’s TSA program until all eligible individuals have either received temporary \nhousing assistance or found alternative, permanent housing.   \n  -2-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 1   Filed 06/30/18   Page 3 of 29\n5.  Plaintiffs seek a judicial declaration and injunctive relief that under the Due \nProcess Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 706 of the \nAdministrative Procedures Act, each of which independently provides Plaintiffs with a right of \naction against FEMA and the individual defendants for each violation.  Defendants’ conduct \nviolates both the substantive and procedural components of the Due Process Clause and at least \nthree provisions of the APA.   \n6.  First, Section 706(2)(B) of the APA requires courts to hold unlawful and set aside \nany agency action that is contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege or immunity.  Because \nDefendants’ conduct violates due process, the Court must also hold such action unlawful and set \nit aside.  \n7.  Second, Section 706(2)(A) of the APA requires courts to hold unlawful and set \naside any agency action that is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law.  Defendants’ decision to terminate TSA to thousands of evacuees without \nany plan to transition evacuees into longer-term housing is arbitrary and capricious.  It simply \nhas no basis in fact.   \n8.  Third, Section 706(1) of the APA requires courts to compel agency action where \nsuch action has been unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.  Defendants have decided to \nterminate TSA on the one hand, while unreasonably delaying activation of any replacement \nhousing assistance on the other hand.  They should be compelled to continue TSA until FEMA \nprovides eligible evacuees sufficient Temporary Housing Assistance and implements an \nadequate replacement solution, or until Plaintiffs and class members have each been relocated \ninto alternate housing.   \n  -3-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 1   Filed 06/30/18   Page 4 of 29\n9.  Plaintiffs seek such relief because it appears that, absent judicial oversight, the \nvictimization of evacuees will continue.  Plaintiffs also seek an order compelling FEMA to \nprovide additional housing assistance to TSA evacuees.   \nII. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n10.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction in this action under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 \n(action arising under the laws of the United States), 28 U.S.C. § 1361 (action to compel officer \nor agency to perform duty owed to Plaintiff), and 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706 (judicial review under \nAPA).  An actual controversy exists between the parties within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § \n2201(a), and this Court may grant declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and other relief against \nDefendants pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202 and 5 U.S.C. §§ 705-706. \n11.  Venue in this Court is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because a substantial part of \nthe events or omissions giving rise to the claims asserted herein occurred in this District. \nIII. \nPARTIES \nA.  INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS \n12.  Plaintiff ALIAN ACENSIO is a 35-year-old woman from San Juan, Puerto Rico.  \nShe relocated as a hurricane evacuee to Worcester, Massachusetts, in April 2018 with her \nspouse, Jose Rodriguez, who is 39 years old.  Both reside in a hotel under the TSA program.  Ms. \nAcensio and Mr. Rodriguez have no residence to return to in Puerto Rico.  Their home was \nflooded, their windows broken, and as of the time of their evacuation, they still lacked electricity \nand running water.  Ms. Acensio suffers from recurrent major depression, and Mr. Rodriguez \nsuffers from schizophrenia and paranoia.  Mr. Rodriguez was unable to access the medical \n  -4-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 1   Filed 06/30/18   Page 5 of 29\nservices he needed in Puerto Rico and is seeking mental health and healthcare services in \nMassachusetts.  They have no other family members with them or in Massachusetts, and if they \nare evicted from their temporary hotel room on June 30, 2018, they will be left homeless. \n13.  Plaintiff ARACELIS VELEZ CRUZ is a 46-year-old woman from Canovanas, \nPuerto Rico.  She relocated as a hurricane evacuee to Worcester, Massachusetts, in February \n2018, where she currently resides in a hotel under the TSA program.  She has no residence to \nreturn to in Puerto Rico as her home has flooded and remains without electricity or running \nwater.  Ms. Velez Cruz relocated as an evacuee due to her precarious living situation and the \ndearth of places to purchase food where she resided in Puerto Rico.  Ms. Velez Cruz has no other \nfamily members in Massachusetts, and if she is evicted from her temporary hotel room on June \n30, 2018, she will be left homeless. \n14.  Plaintiff DENISE NIEVES is a 48-year-old woman from Toa Baja, Puerto Rico.  \nShe relocated as a hurricane evacuee to West Springfield, Massachusetts, in November 2017 \nwith her son.  Ms. Nieves and her son reside in a hotel under the TSA program.  She has no \nresidence to return to in Puerto Rico as her home has flooded and she was told by FEMA \nrepresentatives that she would not receive any assistance to repair it.  Her housing conditions \nbecame dangerous and she and her son were forced to leave their home.  She stopped receiving \nincome and used the remaining source of funds she had to purchase a ticket to Massachusetts.  \nMs. Nieves and her son both suffer from several medical conditions that make their pending \nhomelessness even more dire.  Her son, who was born prematurely, has on-going neurological \ndysfunctions, and suffers from Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder, as well as Post-\nTraumatic Stress Disorder.  Ms. Nieves suffers from pulmonary hypertension, which affects the \nflow of oxygen to both her lungs and heart.  She and her son have sought out medical attention in \n  -5-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 1   Filed 06/30/18   Page 6 of 29\nMassachusetts.  Ms. Nieves and her child have no other family members with them or in \nMassachusetts.  Ms. Nieves does not own a vehicle.  If they are evicted on June 30, 2018, from \ntheir temporary hotel room, they will be left homeless. \n15.  Plaintiff YARITZA DE JESUS LOPEZ is a 35-year-old woman from Caguas, \nPuerto Rico.  She relocated as a hurricane evacuee to West Springfield, Massachusetts, in \nFebruary 2018 with her three children.  Ms. de Jesus Lopez and her children reside in a hotel \nunder the TSA program.  She has no residence to return to in Puerto Rico as her home was \ncompletely destroyed from water and wind damage; the wind blew out the windows and the \ndoors, water filled the home, and the roof was ripped off.  Ms. de Jesus Lopez’s three children \nhave serious asthma and sinus problems.  Ms. de Jesus Lopez and her children have no other \nfamily members with them or in Massachusetts, and if they are evicted from their temporary \nhotel room on June 30, 2018, they will be left homeless. \n16.  Plaintiff ROSA RIVERA is a 57-year-old woman from San Juan, Puerto Rico.  \nShe relocated as a hurricane evacuee to Worcester, Massachusetts, in November 2017 with her \nadult daughter, Neisha Paulino.  Ms. Rivera and Ms. Pulino reside in a hotel under the TSA \nprogram.  Ms. Rivera has no residence to return to in Puerto Rico as her home has flooded and \nremains without electricity or running water.  Ms. Rivera continues to suffer from several \nmedical conditions, and she receives medical attention in Massachusetts.  If Ms. Rivera and her \ndaughter are evicted from their temporary hotel room on June 30, 2018, they will be left \nhomeless. \n17.  Plaintiff ANGEL LAURIANO MUÑOZ DE JESUS is a 69-year-old man who \nself-evacuated from Bayamon, Puerto Rico, to central Florida in November 2017, where he \ncurrently resides in a hotel under the TSA program.  Mr. Muñoz de Jesus suffers from panic \n  -6-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 1   Filed 06/30/18   Page 7 of 29\nattacks and anxiety and was under supervision and continual care by his psychiatrist, who had an \noffice in Toa Bajo, Puerto Rico.  His psychiatrist’s office was rendered uninhabitable after \nHurricane Maria, leaving Mr. Muñoz de Jesus without the necessary medical care to supervise \nhis medications and conditions.  Mr. Muñoz de Jesus also suffers from emphysema, which \nrequires breathing treatments, often several times a day.  He experiences headaches from an \nuntreated eye condition, which will require surgery, in addition to mental health conditions such \nas stress and depression from the inability to secure permanent housing; no options have been \nmade available to him.  Mr. Muñoz de Jesus’ home in Puerto Rico lost electricity requiring him, \nin addition to his medical needs, to seek relocation to Florida.  Mr. Muñoz de Jesus is retired, \nelderly, and infirm and relies only on a Social Security stipend to pay for his living expenses.  If \nhe is evicted on June 30, 2018, from his temporary hotel room, he will become homeless.  \n18.  Plaintiff BETHZAIDA CRESPO VICENTE is a 36-year-old woman who self-\nevacuated from Dorado, Puerto Rico, with her three children and husband on November 16, \n2017.  Ms. Crespo Vicente and her family currently reside in a hotel under the TSA program in \ncentral Florida.  Ms. Crespo Vicente had rented a home in Puerto Rico, which was completely \ndestroyed by Hurricane Maria.  As a result, she was forced to temporarily relocate to her mother-\nin-law’s home, where nine people were living in a small house with no electricity.  Ms. Crespo \nVicente’s children could not attend school in Puerto Rico, which had been temporarily closed \ndue to the impact of the hurricane.  Ms. Crespo Vicente suffers from manic depressive disorder, \nanxiety and scoliosis, for which she is awaiting surgery in Florida.  Ms. Crespo Vicente had to \nundergo emergency surgery in March 2018 to address a growth on her uterus.  Since her recent \nsurgery, she stopped receiving public assistance because her mail was not being accepted at the \nextended-stay hotel where she and her family currently reside.  Ms. Crespo Vicente’s husband is \n  -7-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 1   Filed 06/30/18   Page 8 of 29\nworking; however, they have not been able to earn sufficient income to pay the security deposit \nfor an apartment or ensure they can adequately cover rental costs and transition into permanent \nhousing.  Ms. Crespo Vicente’s husband suffers from high blood pressure and stomach disorders, \nwhich require medical attention that he has sought in Florida.  The Crespo Vicente family has no \nother available housing options, and if they are evicted from their temporary hotel room on June \n30, 2018, they will be left homeless. \n19.  Plaintiff IRIS OTERO is a 39-year-old woman who self-evacuated from San Juan, \nPuerto Rico, with her five children after Hurricane Maria devastated the island.  Ms. Otero is a \nsingle mother who was living in public housing that was completely destroyed by the hurricane.  \nMs. Otero’s landlord would not repair her apartment or the public housing building in Puerto \nRico, which became infested with rats as the front door to her apartment was blown away during \nthe hurricane.  Ms. Otero and her children currently reside in a hotel under the TSA program in \ncentral Florida.  Ms. Otero’s three oldest children suffer from ADHD, a condition of diagnosed \nhyperactivity that requires ongoing psychological or psychiatric care and supervision.  Her \nchildren’s schools in Puerto Rico were closed indefinitely.  Three of Ms. Otero’s children have \nother learning disabilities, which makes it extremely difficult for her to relocate them again \nbased on their educational needs and the level of care required for their growth and well-being.  \nShe has no assistance or support in Puerto Rico to help her re-establish herself and her children \nthere, as her mother is elderly and suffers from several medical conditions.  Ms. Otero has not \nreceived public assistance in Florida and cannot afford to move to more permanent housing.  Ms. \nOtero feels desperate and scared and has suffered from insomnia and stress at the prospect of \nfinding herself and her five children homeless.  Ms. Otero and her children have no other \n  -8-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 1   Filed 06/30/18   Page 9 of 29\navailable housing options, and if they are evicted from their temporary hotel room on June 30, \n2018, they will be left homeless. \nB.  CLASS PLAINTIFFS \n20.  Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf and on behalf of all those similarly \nsituated. \n21.  Plaintiffs seek to represent a class consisting of all persons who (a) as of \nSeptember 16, 2017, resided in Puerto Rico, declared to be a Federal Disaster Area due to \nHurricane Maria; (b) have applied for and received TSA under the Stafford Act, pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 5174(a) through (d) and the federal regulations promulgated thereunder; (c) are \ncurrently residing in TSA housing; (d) have not been able to secure alternative housing; and (e) \nwill have their TSA discontinued as of June 30, 2018.  \n22.  Each of the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) is met. \n23.  Members of the class are so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable, and individual litigation by each would necessarily and substantially burden the \noperation of the judicial system and is prohibitive because the individual class members lack the \nknowledge, sophistication, and financial means to maintain individual actions.  In addition, the \nprosecution of separate actions by individual class members would create a risk of inconsistent \nor varying adjudications establishing incompatible rules of law for the provision of disaster \nrelief.   \n24.  The number of class members can best be estimated from records in the control of \nDefendants.  They are believed to number in the thousands. \n25.  There is a well-defined community of interest in the questions of law and fact \ninvolving the claims of the members of the class, in that FEMA has systemically applied the \n  -9-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 1   Filed 06/30/18   Page 10 of 29\npolicies and practices challenged in this action to wrongfully and arbitrarily discontinue the TSA \nprogram under the Stafford Act before evacuees have secured alternative housing.  There are \ncommon questions of law or fact. \n26.  The claims of the named plaintiffs are typical of the class members in that each \nnamed plaintiff, due to the challenged policies and practices of FEMA: (a) has been displaced by \nHurricane Maria and/or had their primary pre-disaster residence rendered uninhabitable; (b) is \ncurrently receiving TSA; and (c) will be displaced as of June 30, 2018 if FEMA discontinues \nTSA as it threatens to do.  \n27.  The named plaintiffs will adequately and fairly represent and protect the interests \nof the class because each named plaintiff has suffered the same or similar harm, and has the same \nor similar interest in redress of his/her rights as all other members of the class, and thus their \ninterests overlap and do not conflict.

DEFENDANTS \n29.  Defendant Federal Emergency Management Agency was created in 1979 as a \nresult of the merging of several federal agencies that handled disaster-related responsibilities. \nFEMA is the federal agency designated by the President to administer the Temporary Housing \nAssistance (“THA”) program in accordance with the provisions of the Stafford Act and the \nfederal regulations.  As an agency of the federal government, FEMA’s actions are directed and \ncarried out by other agencies and individuals.  When used in this Complaint, the acronym \n“FEMA” shall be understood to refer not only to that agency, but to the Defendants listed below \nas well. \n30.  Defendant Willian Brock Long has been the Director of FEMA from June 20, \n2017, through the present. \n31.  Defendant Thomas Van Essen is the FEMA Regional Director with administrative \nresponsibility for FEMA’s response to Hurricane Maria victims from Puerto Rico. \n32.  To coordinate the federal government’s efforts in response to a disaster, FEMA \nrecommends, and the President appoints, a Federal Coordinating Officer (“FCO”) for each state \naffected by a disaster.  Defendant Alejandro De La Campa is the FCO with overall responsibility \nfor FEMA’s response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. \nIV. \nBASIS FOR RELIEF \n33.  This action and the relief requested are authorized under 28 U.S.C. § 1361, 28 \nU.S.C. § 2201, 28 U.S.C. § 2202, 28 U.S.C. § 2412(b), 42 U.S.C. §§ 5151, 5174, and 5 \nU.S.C. §§ 701 et seq. and the federal regulations promulgated thereunder, and the Due Process \nClause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n  -11-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 1   Filed 06/30/18   Page 12 of 29\n34.  Under the Stafford Act, victims of a disaster are eligible for “financial or other \nassistance” to meet their housing needs if they have been “displaced from their pre-disaster \nprimary residences,” or their pre-disaster primary residences “are rendered uninhabitable as a \nresult of damage caused by a major disaster.” 42 U.S.C. § 5174(b)(1). \n35.  42 U.S.C. § 5170b(a)(3)(B), also known as the Stafford Act’s “public assistance” \nprovision, gives FEMA the power to perform “work or services essential to saving lives and \nprotecting and preserving property or public health and safety, including . . . emergency \nshelter . . .”  Under this authority, FEMA provides short-term Transitional Sheltering Assistance \nto disaster survivors who cannot return to their homes after congregate shelters have closed.  In \nmost cases, assistance is provided through direct payments to hotels and motels.  \n36.  Under the Stafford Act, victims of a disaster are eligible for Temporary Housing \nAssistance.  THA is available for 18 months from the date that the President declared a disaster, \nbut may be extended beyond that time.  44 C.F.R. § 206.110(e).  \n37.  There are four forms of THA: (1) money for renting alternate housing (“Direct \nRental Assistance”), (2) rent-free occupancy in federally provided temporary housing, (3) money \nfor repair of owner-occupied housing, and (4) money for replacement of owner-occupied \nhousing.  42 U.S.C. § 5174(c); 44 C.F.R. § 206.117(b). \n38.  Applications for THA, and for the distribution of federal benefits pursuant to the \nStafford Act, must be done in “an equitable and impartial manner, without discrimination on the \ngrounds of race, color, religion, nationality, sex, age, or economic status.”  42 U.S.C. § 5151 \n0.(a). \n39.  On September 18, 2017, President Donald J. Trump declared a state of emergency \nin the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  President Trump’s declarations required FEMA to \n  -12-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 1   Filed 06/30/18   Page 13 of 29\nprovide assistance under the Stafford Act.  FEMA’s duty to provide assistance to victims of \nHurricane Maria was mandatory, not discretionary.  \nV. \nSUMMARY OF FACTS \nA.  HURRICANE MARIA RAVAGES PUERTO RICO \n40.  On September 20, 2017, Hurricane Maria hit the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico, \na territory of the United States with 3.4 million residents.  The hurricane, classified as a Category \n5 storm, was the worst natural disaster in Puerto Rico in over a hundred years, crippling the \nisland’s infrastructure and causing an estimated $90 billion in damage.  \n41.  Hurricane Maria devastated the electrical grid, causing a one-hundred percent \nblackout in Puerto Rico and leaving hundreds of thousands of residents without power for \nmonths.  Currently, ten months after the hurricane hit the island, there are still thousands of \nresidents whose electricity has not yet been restored.  \n42.  The hurricane severely, if not permanently, damaged tens of thousands of homes \nand left nearly 75,000 Puerto Ricans without housing.  \n43.  Many municipalities throughout the island were without potable water, or any \nkind of running water, for weeks or months at a time, creating a public health hazard and concern \nfor healthcare and nutritional assistance for all residents.  \n44.  As a result of the lack of drinking water, combined with contaminated sources of \nwater that residents were told were safe for drinking, cases of leptospirosis, a potentially deadly \nbacterial disease that is water-borne, began to break out, putting at risk up to two million \nresidents of Puerto Rico.  \n  -13-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 1   Filed 06/30/18   Page 14 of 29\n45.  The lack of electricity and infrastructure damage extended to healthcare facilities \nand hospitals; most were running on generators, and some had no electricity even by generators.  \nResidents were told not to seek out healthcare services unless it was an emergency, given the \nlack of medical equipment, personnel, facilities in a condition to tend to patients, and electricity.  \n46.  It is estimated that the lack of available and accessible healthcare services, \nelectricity, food, and drinking water, in addition to widespread environmental and water \ncontamination, dangerous housing conditions, broken infrastructure, damaged roads, and \ncentralization of aid led to the deaths of approximately 4,645 Puerto Ricans, and perhaps \nthousands more.  \n47.  Since the hurricane, Puerto Rico has seen a steep increase in the number of \nsuicides and mental health issues, including post-traumatic stress disorder.  \n48.  As a result of the damage inflicted on Puerto Rico by Hurricane Maria, thousands \nof Puerto Ricans became displaced and sought assistance on the mainland United States.  It is \nestimated that between 100,000 and 300,000 Puerto Ricans left the island in the months \nfollowing the hurricane to seek stable housing, employment and healthcare services.  \n49.  Evacuees are spread out across the country, with the highest concentration in \nFlorida, particularly central Florida, as well as in the New York City metropolitan and tri-state \narea, Philadelphia, Chicago, Boston, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere throughout the United States.  \n50.  Many evacuees are families or single parents with children, who have already \nbeen enrolled in local schools.  Some of the evacuees are elderly individuals who have arrived by \nthemselves, with no family support or alternative housing options. \n  -14-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 1   Filed 06/30/18   Page 15 of 29\nB.  FEMA PROVIDES TRANSITIONAL SHELTER ASSISTANCE TO EVACUEES  \n51.  Among the displaced Puerto Rican evacuees, about 2,300 families began \nreceiving TSA from FEMA (hereinafter referred to as “TSA evacuees”), which included \nvouchers for extended stays in hotels around the country or in temporary housing facilities, \nalthough some were denied these benefits outright.  Many of the households that initially \nreceived TSA were later cut off.  Approximately 2,000 families continue to participate in the \nTSA program.  Many thousands more left the island and likely found family members, friends, \nor acquaintances to stay with, even if temporarily.  Others have ended up directly in homeless \nshelter systems throughout various states.  \n52.  The TSA program was extended at least three times in order to avoid massive \nsecondary displacement of TSA evacuees, the overwhelming majority of whom have not been \nable to secure employment or long-term housing.  \n53.  Prior to each extension, individuals and families participating in the TSA program \nexperienced anxiety and high levels of uncertainty about what would happen to them, given that \nmost had not been successful in securing longer-term housing or employment.  \nC.  FEMA PLANS TO DISCONTINUE TSA ON JUNE 30, 2018, LEAVING \nEVACUEES HOMELESS \n54.  The current TSA program for victims of Hurricane Maria is scheduled to \npermanently expire on June 30, 2018, and FEMA has stated that it will not consider a further \nextension. \n55.  Hundreds of families are still in hotels under TSA, unsure where they will go on \nJune 30, 2018.  Unable to secure alternative longer-term housing solutions, they will likely end \nup in homeless shelters, return to precarious housing and employment situations in Puerto Rico, \n  -15-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 1   Filed 06/30/18   Page 16 of 29\nor worse—living on the street.  Families currently under the TSA program have requested an \nextension from FEMA. \n56.  There are approximately 2,000 TSA evacuees throughout the United States, \nincluding Plaintiffs, who (a) were displaced from their homes by Hurricane Maria, (b) were \ngiven a voucher by FEMA to seek lodging in a hotel, (c) have remained in the TSA program \nuntil the present time with FEMA paying for their temporary hotel residences, (d) are still unable \nto either return to their previous homes or secure adequate alternative permanent housing, and (e) \nhave reasonably relied, in making long-term housing plans, on the expectation that FEMA would \ncontinue to support them with the TSA program until they can either return to their homes or \nfind other sustainable permanent housing.  \n57.  While receiving federal assistance from FEMA, most TSA evacuees are ineligible \nfor local benefits and housing assistance.  If TSA assistance to these hurricane victims is \nrevoked, they will become homeless.  \n58.  TSA evacuees have no other housing options open to them.  They do not have \nfamily members with whom they can stay, and they cannot return to Puerto Rico because there \nare no housing options for them.  Most have lost their jobs and have no source of employment to \ngo back to.  In addition, many, including Plaintiffs, left Puerto Rico to seek healthcare for \nconditions they had that became aggravated as a result of lack of proper medical attention in \nPuerto Rico after the hurricane, and others have developed serious conditions or illnesses since \ntheir arrival.  They need to remain in their current location, where they can continue to receive \ntreatment and care for illnesses that include cancer, hypertension, diabetes, and asthma.  \n  -16-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 1   Filed 06/30/18   Page 17 of 29\n59.  If the remaining 2,000 TSA evacuees are evicted on June 30, 2018, and no local \nor state government programs are immediately put in place to secure stable housing for them, \nthey will become homeless and suffer irreparable injury. \n60.  Upon information and belief, Plaintiffs and putative class members have been \nactively working to secure permanent or longer-term housing.  \n61.  There are several ways in which FEMA can ensure that evacuees whose TSA is \nterminated on June 30, 2018 are not left homeless. \n62.  FEMA has the ability to enter into an Inter-Agency Agreement (IAA) with the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to initiate the Disaster Housing \nAssistance Program (DHAP), as they did after Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy.  FEMA \nhas represented that “DHAP is not necessary to house displaced disaster survivors” because \n“FEMA collaborates directly with HUD to find housing solutions for disaster survivors and is \nproviding a variety of housing programs to adequately meet the unique needs of survivors that \nare more timely and effective than DHAP.”  See FEMA Media Library (May 3, 2018), available \nat https://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/images/163928 (last accessed June 29, 2018).  \nFEMA has not kept this promise.  \n63.  FEMA also has the ability to extend Direct Rental Assistance to all of the TSA \nevacuees in order to help them secure longer-term housing options, including apartment leases \nthat would allow them to contract housing for longer periods of time.  As of now, and upon \ninformation and belief, this program has been extended to only approximately 83 TSA evacuees.  \nSome evacuees have applied for THA, but have not received it.   \n64.  FEMA has arbitrarily, capriciously, and unlawfully set the final TSA deadline for \nJune 30, 2018, without a plan for transitioning into longer-term or long-term housing some 2,000 \n  -17-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 1   Filed 06/30/18   Page 18 of 29\nindividuals who have faced severe trauma and who have lost most, if not all, of their belongings, \ntheir homes, and their jobs and who face healthcare challenges.  Hotels have begun to receive \nnotification that FEMA will no longer continue to pay for Plaintiffs and all TSA evacuees’ stays \nas of June 30, 2018, and many hotels have sent notices to the evacuees that they will be \nresponsible for payment as of July 1, 2018.  TSA evacuees and Plaintiffs are terrified at the \npossibility of being evicted with no alternative housing options available.  \n65.  This litigation seeks to stop the eviction of TSA evacuees from their hotels \nwithout any alternative housing.  \n66.  FEMA has currently offered TSA assistance to victims of Hurricane Maria for \nonly the past nine months.  However, after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, FEMA extended TSA \nassistance for up to 26 months for evacuees.  After that, FEMA provided additional assistance to \nthe victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita through DHAP.  FEMA has arbitrarily, capriciously, \nand unlawfully decided not to extend those same benefits to Plaintiffs and the putative class. \n67.  If evicted on June 30, 2018, as FEMA has stated its intent to do, Plaintiffs and the \nputative class would suffer irreparable injury.  \nD.  DEFENDANTS’ CONDUCT HAS AND WILL PROXIMATELY CAUSE \nIRREPARABLE HARM TO PLAINTIFFS, CLASS MEMBERS AND THE \nPUBLIC. \n68.  Defendants’ wrongful conduct has caused and will continue to cause Plaintiffs \nand class members irreparable harm and injury in that, absent judicial relief, they will be \nwrongfully denied and delayed essential housing assistance that is necessary for their health and \nwelfare. \n  -18-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 1   Filed 06/30/18   Page 19 of 29\n69.  Without that housing assistance, Plaintiffs, class members, and their families will \nbe unable to remain continuously in affordable housing and will face the threat of probable \nhomelessness. \n70.  Many Plaintiffs, class members, and their families have been forced to live in \nintolerable, unsafe and unsanitary conditions as a result of Hurricane Maria and inadequate \ndisaster relief, which has caused new medical conditions and complicated existing medical \nconditions.  Without the requested relief, many others will also be forced to live in those same \nintolerable, unsafe and unsanitary conditions. \n71.  Many Plaintiffs, class members, and their families, have been displaced and \nevacuated to distant places around the country, often by FEMA, and left without housing \nassistance and the means to return to their communities.  \n72.  The lack of housing assistance for Plaintiffs, class members, and their families has \nalso served to split families and tear households apart. \n73.  Defendants’ knowing and continued failure and refusal to provide housing \nassistance to thousands of individuals and families, who will be evicted from their current TSA \nshelters, is causing, and will likely continue to cause, further destitution, homelessness, hunger \nand stress.  As a consequence, the risk of illness will be increased and their lives will be \nendangered. \n74.  Defendants’ intentional and wrongful conduct will also result in significant costs \nto the public and waste of taxpayer funds.  The loss of critically needed housing assistance harms \nthose communities which have been destroyed by Hurricane Maria. The loss of housing \nassistance will harm many other communities throughout the country which have reached out to \nassist those who have been displaced and evacuated and now will face increased homelessness \n  -19-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 1   Filed 06/30/18   Page 20 of 29\nand, consequently, a higher incidence of persons with mental and emotional distress, illness, \ndiseases, and substance abuse. \n75.  As a result of the federal government’s failure to fulfill its mandatory duties, \nmisconduct, state and local governments will be required to expend significant additional funds \nfor the increased use of county health facilities to remedy these increased problems.  \nE.  PLAINTIFFS AND CLASS MEMBERS HAVE NO ADEQUATE REMEDY AT \nLAW. \n76.  Plaintiffs, class members, and their families are without a plain, speedy or \nadequate remedy at law, thereby rendering injunctive relief appropriate in that (a) damages \ncannot adequately compensate Plaintiffs and the class for the injuries suffered; (b) damages for \nthe harm inflicted upon Plaintiffs and the class are difficult to ascertain; and (c) if the conduct \ncomplained of is not enjoined, a multiplicity of suits will result in that FEMA’s unlawful conduct \nis continuous and ongoing. \nVI. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n \nCOUNT I: \nDEPRIVATION OF DUE PROCESS \nU.S. Const. Amend. V \n \n(Defendants’ Conduct, Including Termination Of The TSA Program, Violates Plaintiffs \nAnd Class Members’ Substantive And Procedural Due Process Rights.) \n \n77.  All prior paragraphs are incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n78.  The Fifth Amendment to the United State Constitution provides that no person \nshall “be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law[.]” U.S. Const. amend. \nV.  The Due Process Clause has a substantive component that provides heightened protection \nagainst government interference with fundamental rights and liberty interests.  The right to \n  -20-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 1   Filed 06/30/18   Page 21 of 29\nproperty, shelter and peaceful possession of one’s home are such fundamental rights and liberty \ninterests.  Violation of such rights by a government entity gives rise to a private right of action to \nredress such rights through declaratory, injunctive or other relief.  \n79.  Plaintiffs Alian Acensio, Aracelis Velez, Denise Nieves, Yaritza de Jesus Lopez, \nRosa Rivera, Angel Lauriano Muñoz de Jesus, Bethzaida Crespo Vicente, and Iris Otero, and \nsimilarly situated members of the class, have property interests, including a right to retain \npossession, as tenants in FEMA subsidized hotel/motel units, which have become their homes.  \nPlaintiffs have the right to continuing and orderly housing assistance, and as eligible disaster \nvictims, they may qualify to receive alternative THA.  They also have a fundamental right to \nshelter and peaceful possession of their homes.  Defendants’ intentional conduct knowingly \nimpinges on these rights.  \n80.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution \nalso has a procedural component, prohibiting Defendants from depriving Plaintiffs and similarly \nsituated members of the class of their property interests without adequate and timely notice of \nthe type(s) of THA for which they qualify or may qualify and appropriate procedures for \ndetermining their eligibility for and obtaining such assistance prior to FEMA’s termination of the \nTSA Program.  \n81.  FEMA has failed to provide Plaintiffs and similarly situated members of the class, \nprior to terminating the TSA Program, with proper notice, information and procedures for \ndetermining their eligibility or continuing eligibility for THA, including the programs mentioned \nabove, so that continuing assistance is assured. \n82.  FEMA’s failure to provide Plaintiffs and similarly situated members of the class, \nprior to terminating the TSA Program, with proper information and procedures regarding \n  -21-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 1   Filed 06/30/18   Page 22 of 29\neligibility for alternative and continuing THA prevents or frustrates Plaintiffs and similarly \nsituated members of their class in obtaining alternative THA, resulting in homelessness and \ninadequate housing. \n83.  This amounts to a deprivation of a property interest without notice and due \nprocess. \n84.  As a result, Defendants have violated the rights of Plaintiffs Alian Acensio, \nAracelis Velez, Denise Nieves, Yaritza de Jesus Lopez, Rosa Rivera, Angel Lauriano Muñoz de \nJesus, Bethzaida Crespo Vicente, and Iris Otero, and similarly situated members of the class, \nunder Due Process of law as guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution. \n85.  Plaintiffs are entitled to a judicial declaration that (a) Plaintiffs have a right to stay \nin possession of their current shelter; and (b) Defendants’ termination of the TSA Program as \ndescribed above violates Plaintiffs’ and class members’ constitutional rights.  Plaintiffs are \nfurther entitled to injunctive relief restraining and/or enjoining Defendants from terminating TSA \nwithout the process prayed for below. \nCOUNT II:  \nVIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT  \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B) \n \n(Defendants’ Conduct Should Be Declared Unlawful And/Or Set Aside Because It Is \nContrary to Constitutional Right, Power, Privilege, Or Immunity.) \n \n86.  All prior paragraphs are incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n87.  The APA empowers the Court to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \nfindings, and conclusions” that are “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or \nimmunity.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). In addition, this Court has authority under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 \n  -22-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 1   Filed 06/30/18   Page 23 of 29\nand its traditional powers of equity to declare invalid and enjoin agency action that violates the \nConstitution. \n88.  Where a Complaint contends that agency action offends the Constitution, and for \nthat reason should be enjoined, the Court does not afford deference to the agency, but instead \nreviews the constitutional issues independently.  \n89.  As detailed above, Defendants’ conduct violates Plaintiffs’ substantive and \nprocedural due process rights, including, without limitation, by depriving Plaintiffs of their \nfundamental right to shelter and peaceful possession of their homes; and doing so without \nconstitutional safeguards, including, without limitation, proper notice and an opportunity to be \nheard.  \n90.  Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaratory judgment that Defendants’ termination of \nthe TSA Program as described above is unlawful and should be set aside.  \n \nCOUNT III:  \nVIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT  \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) \n \n(Defendants’ Conduct Should Be Declared Unlawful And/Or Set Aside Because It Is \nArbitrary, Capricious, An Abuse Of Discretion, Or Otherwise Not In Accordance With \nLaw.) \n \n91.  All prior paragraphs are incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n92.  The APA requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside” agency action that is, \namong other things, “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance \nwith law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Agency action is arbitrary and capricious if it is not the \nproduct of reasoned decision making. This means, among other things, that an agency must \nprovide an adequate evidentiary basis for its action and consider all important aspects of the \nproblem before it. \n  -23-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 1   Filed 06/30/18   Page 24 of 29\n93.  Defendants’ decision to terminate the TSA Program on June 30, 2018, long before \nPuerto Rico has recovered from Hurricane Maria, and before TSA evacuees are able to apply for \nand secure THA, or alternative housing, is being made without any plan to assist TSA evacuees \nin securing housing.  This decision is without reason and is arbitrary and capricious.  \n94.  Defendants’ decision to terminate the TSA on June 30, 2018, violates the APA’s \nprohibition against “arbitrary and capricious” agency action.  FEMA’s stated purpose for \nterminating this support for the class members is that the agency does not think DHAP is needed. \nThis is contrary to the stark facts and the reality faced by the Puerto Rican victims of Hurricane \nMaria currently relying on FEMA assistance to survive and avoid homelessness.   The stated \npurpose of terminating the program is not borne out by the facts, and is pretext for other unstated \nand ulterior purposes. \n95.  FEMA has given inadequate consideration, if any, to the viability of possible \nalternatives for TSA evacuees, including Direct Rental Assistance, upon termination of their \nshort-term housing benefits.  \n96.  Plaintiffs and class members have suffered a legal wrong.  Defendants’ violation \nhas caused and will continue to cause ongoing, irreparable harm to Plaintiffs and class members \nwho have been adversely affected and aggrieved by FEMA’s arbitrary and capricious conduct. \n97.  An actual controversy exists between Plaintiffs and Defendants regarding whether \nDefendants’ termination of the TSA Program violates Section 706(2)(A) of the APA. \n98.  Plaintiffs are entitled to a judicial declaration that Defendants’ termination of the \nTSA Program as described above is unlawful and should be set aside.  \n \nCOUNT IV:  \nVIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT  \n5 U.S.C. § 706(1) \n  -24-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 1   Filed 06/30/18   Page 25 of 29\n \n(Defendants Should Be Compelled To Provide The Relief They Have Unlawfully Withheld \nOr Unreasonably Delayed.) \n99.  All prior paragraphs are incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n100.  The APA requires courts to “compel agency action unlawfully withheld or \nunreasonably delayed.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  As detailed above, Defendants have arbitrarily \nand capriciously decided to terminate benefits to TSA evacuees without any plan in place to \ntransition them into longer-term housing.  \n101.  Defendants’ refusal to activate DHAP or other relief (as they are obligated to do) \nbefore terminating benefits under the Transitional Shelter Assistance Program constitutes an \nunlawful withholding and/or an unreasonable delay of agency action—particularly in light of \nFEMA’s concurrent decision to evict Plaintiffs and class members from their homes on June 30, \n2018.   \n102.  FEMA has elected to evict Plaintiffs, class members, and their families from their \ntemporary homes, while simultaneously withholding benefits that FEMA has historically \nprovided in similar situations, including after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, to ensure that the \ntermination of TSA does not result in homelessness or worse.  \n103.  Plaintiffs are entitled to a permanent injunction restraining and/or enjoining \nDefendants from terminating TSA until Plaintiffs and class members have received sufficient \nTHA to transition to longer-term housing; or Defendants implement an adequate replacement \nsolution.  Plaintiffs are further entitled to a permanent injunction compelling Defendants to \naccept and process all applications for THA from TSA evacuees for a reasonable period of time, \nand to notify applicants and class members concerning all forms of THA available to them and \nthe criteria and conditions applicable to such assistance. \n  -25-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 1   Filed 06/30/18   Page 26 of 29\n \nCOUNT V: \nDECLARATORY JUDGMENT \n28 U.S.C. § 2201 \n104.  All prior paragraphs are incorporated as if fully set forth herein.  \n105.  The Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201, allows the Court to “declare the \nrights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not \nfurther relief is or could be sought.” \n106.  Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration of their rights.  Plaintiffs have a property \ninterest in their current temporary shelter and are entitled to additional housing assistance under \nthe Stafford Act.  \n107.  Plaintiffs are further entitled to a declaration that (a) Defendants’ termination of \nthe TSA Program as described above constitutes agency action that is unlawful and should be set \naside under the Administrative Procedure Act; and that violates Plaintiffs and Class Members’ \nconstitutional rights; and (b) Defendants have unlawfully withheld and unreasonably delayed \nactivation of any assistance or program to replace TSA. \nVII. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs and Class Members respectfully request that this this Court: \n \nA.

The United States Federal Government and the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency (“FEMA”) have overwhelmingly failed the people of Puerto \nRico before, during and after Hurricane Maria, the worst natural disaster to hit the \nisland in 100 years, and they continue to do the same.  Hurricane Maria ravaged \nPuerto Rico in September 2017.  The storm destroyed nearly 100,000 homes, \ndisplaced thousands of Puerto Rican families, and left the island largely \nuninhabitable.  The federal response—in stark contrast to presidential and agency  \nresponses to Hurricanes Harvey in Texas and Irma in Florida approximately one  \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 2 of 48\n \nmonth earlier—was slow, insufficient and ambivalent.1   \n2.  On September 30, 2017, before Maria had fully dissipated, President \nDonald J. Trump tweeted that Puerto Ricans “want everything to be done for \nthem.”  On October 12, 2017, just ten days after Maria dissipated, President Trump \ntweeted: “We cannot keep FEMA, the Military & the First Responders . . . in P.R. \nforever!”  In contrast, on August 30, 2017, approximately two weeks after \nHurricane Harvey hit Texas, the President tweeted: “After witnessing first hand \n[sic] the horror & devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey, my heart goes out even \nmore so to the great people of Texas.” \n3.  Presidential tweets have become a proxy for executive attention and \ngovernment action.  While hundreds of Hurricane Harvey victims remain sheltered \nin hotels and motels and thousands more are safe in alternate housing arrangements \nmade by or through FEMA, the agency seeks to evict approximately 2,000 Puerto \nRican Hurricane Maria survivors from their current (and only) homes.            \n4.  Against this backdrop, four such survivors, Plaintiffs Elizabeth \nDelgado Santos, Rafael Ocasio Barreto, Bethzaida Crespo Vicente and Iris Otero \n                                                 \n1 Hurricane Irma also impacted Puerto Rico.  Nevertheless, the bulk of FEMA’s \nresponse and public attention surrounding Irma focuses on Florida and the \nSoutheast.  Unless otherwise indicated in this First Amended Complaint, all \nreferences to Irma are to that storm’s impact on Florida and the surrounding region \nand FEMA’s response in the same area of the continental U.S., not the island of \nPuerto Rico. \n  -2-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 3 of 48\n \n(collectively, “Plaintiffs”), by and through their undersigned attorneys, bring this \nFirst Amended Complaint against FEMA, William Brock Long, Thomas Van \nEssen and Alejandro De La Campa, on behalf of themselves and all similarly \nsituated individuals.   \nI. \n PRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n5.  This is an action to hold unlawful and set aside certain actions of \nFEMA, the federal agency charged by statute to care for Americans who are \nvictims of natural disasters; and to compel FEMA to take other necessary actions \nthat it has unreasonably delayed or unlawfully withheld from Puerto Rican \nevacuees, placing them at risk of significant, irreparable injury.  Contrary to its \ncharge, FEMA plans to prematurely abort assistance to thousands of Puerto Ricans \ndisplaced by Hurricane Maria.  FEMA previously announced that effective June \n30, 2018, it would discontinue its Transitional Sheltering Assistance (“TSA”) \nprogram to Puerto Rican evacuees of Hurricane Maria (hereinafter “TSA \nevacuees”).  Through TSA, FEMA provides direct funding to hotels and motels \nthat serve as shelter for thousands of individuals and families who were forced to \nevacuate Puerto Rico after the hurricane severely damaged or destroyed their \nhomes and communities.  Their homes remain uninhabitable due to the hurricane \ndamage and many of their communities lack fundamental infrastructure and \n  -3-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 4 of 48\n \nmedical support these families need to survive.  While FEMA offered Plaintiffs a \none-way airline ticket to return to their “homes” in Puerto Rico, the offer is illusory \nas it provides a “ticket to nowhere”; there are no homes to which these families can \nreturn.  FEMA is forcing these citizens to become homeless, and in doing so, \nattempting to shift the legal, financial and social responsibility from itself, where it \nbelongs, to the local, state and municipal communities in which these individuals \nlive. \n6.  Because FEMA’s termination of TSA would have left the TSA \nevacuees with no place to go, Plaintiffs filed an initial Complaint and an \nEmergency Motion For A Temporary Restraining Order Or Preliminary Injunction \nAnd Declaratory Relief on June 30, 2018—the day before the TSA evacuees would \nhave been forced out of their hotel rooms.  Prior to initiating this lawsuit, Plaintiffs \nand the organizations that support them believed in good faith that FEMA would \nagain extend the TSA program, just as it had done before for TSA evacuees and in \nthe aftermath of earlier hurricanes that displaced citizens from their homes in the \ncontinental United States.  In the week before Plaintiffs and the class were to be \nevicted, it became clear that FEMA would not similarly extend TSA benefits to \nPuerto Rican hurricane survivors. \n7.  On June 30, 2018, the Honorable Leo T. Sorokin entered a Temporary  \nRestraining Order (“TRO”), enjoining Defendants and their agents from  \n  -4-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 5 of 48\n \nterminating the TSA program until at least midnight July 3, 2018, enabling \nPlaintiffs and the class to stay in transitional shelters until checkout time on July 4, \n2018.  The Court further ordered Defendants and their agents to provide notice and \ntake whatever action is necessary to extend the assistance until the aforementioned \ndeadline.  \n8.  FEMA’s response was quick, but insufficient, announcing only that \nthe agency would extend transportation assistance in the form of flights back to \nPuerto Rico until August 30, 2018.  The announcement made no mention of any \ntemporary housing or support during the two-month gap in time between FEMA’s \neviction of TSA evacuees and their return flights. \n9.  On July 3, 2018, the Honorable Timothy S. Hillman, ordered that the \nTRO remain in place until at least midnight July 23, 2018, enabling Plaintiffs and \nthe class to continue to have temporary housing at least to that date and pending \nfurther order of the Court. \n10.  But for the TRO, many TSA evacuees would now be homeless.  \nFEMA’s unlawful termination of TSA is without any plan to transition into longer-\nterm housing some 2,000 TSA evacuees who have already faced severe trauma and \nlost most, if not all, of their belongings, their homes and their jobs.  For Plaintiffs \nand many other TSA evacuees, especially the poor, elderly and sick, returning to \ntheir homes (or what is left of their homes) and communities in Puerto Rico is not \n  -5-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 6 of 48\n \na viable option.  Through no fault of their own, TSA evacuees simply lack the \nresources to either relocate in the continental United States or return to Puerto Rico \nat this time.  In such circumstances, FEMA is the agency charged with providing \nassistance to these citizens.      \n11.  This action, therefore, is brought by four named Plaintiffs, on their \nown behalf and on behalf of a class of people similarly situated, seeking an order \nthat FEMA obey the laws put into place to address the problems associated with \ndisasters such as Hurricane Maria and continue FEMA’s TSA program until all \neligible individuals have either received temporary housing assistance or found \nalternative, permanent housing.   \n12.  Defendants’ conduct violates (a) the substantive and procedural \ncomponents of the Due Process Clause; (b) three substantive provisions of the \nAdministrative Procedures Act (“APA”); (c) the equal protection component of the \nDue Process Clause; and (d) Section 308 of the Stafford Act, which requires \nnondiscrimination in disaster assistance.  Each of these violations independently \nwarrants declaratory relief under Section 2201 of the Declaratory Judgment Act \nand declaratory and injunctive relief in their own right.    \n13.  As to the APA, Section 706(2)(B) requires courts to hold unlawful  \nand set aside any agency action that is contrary to constitutional right, power,  \n  -6-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 7 of 48\n \nprivilege or immunity.  Because Defendants’ conduct violates due process, the \nCourt must also hold such action unlawful and set it aside.  \n14.  Second, Section 706(2)(A) of the APA requires courts to hold \nunlawful and set aside any agency action that is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.  Defendants’ decision to \nterminate TSA to thousands of evacuees without any plan to transition evacuees \ninto longer-term housing is arbitrary and capricious.  FEMA’s announcement to \nterminate TSA was done without any analysis or basis in fact to support its \ndecision to treat the Puerto Rican evacuee’s differently than prior hurricane \nsurvivors who lost their homes.  Nor has FEMA’s decision provided these families \nany rights of appeal or review before they were to be summarily evicted.     \n15.  Third, Section 706(1) of the APA requires courts to compel agency \naction where such action has been unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.  \nDefendants have decided to terminate TSA on the one hand, while unreasonably \ndelaying activation of any replacement housing assistance on the other hand.  They \nshould be compelled to continue TSA until FEMA provides eligible evacuees \nsufficient Temporary Housing Assistance (“THA”) and implements an adequate \nreplacement solution, or until Plaintiffs and class members have each been \nrelocated into alternate housing.   \n16.  Plaintiffs seek such relief because it appears that, absent judicial  \n  -7-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 8 of 48\n \noversight, the victimization of evacuees will continue.  \nII.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n17.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction in this action under 28 \nU.S.C. § 1331 (action arising under the laws of the United States), 28 \nU.S.C. § 1361 (action to compel officer or agency to perform duty owed to \nPlaintiff), and 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706 (judicial review under APA).  An actual \ncontroversy exists between the parties within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a), \nand this Court may grant declaratory relief, injunctive relief and other relief against \nDefendants pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202 and 5 U.S.C. §§ 705-706. \n18.  Venue in this Court is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because a \nsubstantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims asserted herein \noccurred in this District. \nIII.  \nPARTIES \nA.  INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS \n19.  Plaintiff ELIZABETH DELGADO SANTOS is a 35-year old woman \nfrom San Juan, Puerto Rico.  She relocated as a hurricane evacuee to Holyoke, \nMassachusetts on January 9, 2018 with her 6-year old daughter to live with her \nmother.  Ms. Santos also has a 12-year old son who was being cared for by her \n  -8-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 9 of 48\n \nmother.  Ms. Santos left Puerto Rico because the roof of the home she had been \nliving in was severely damaged, allowing water to seep in throughout the home.  In \naddition, flood damage caused her to lose almost all her personal belongings.   The \nhome in which Ms. Santos was living in Puerto Rico was an inheritance from her \nfather; however, Ms. Santos is one of six children, and legal title has not yet been \nconferred.  This made Ms. Santos ineligible to receive any assistance to make the \nrepairs necessary to make the home livable.  Ms. Santos’ son suffers from \ndepression and has been diagnosed ADHD.  Ms. Santos’ daughter was unable to \nattend school in Puerto Rico for at least two months and the school was on a \nclosure list.  When Ms. Santos left Puerto Rico, the power had yet to be restored to \nher neighborhood.  Ms. Santos and her two children were unable to remain in her \nmother’s house more than a few weeks, rendering Ms. Santos and her children \nhomeless.  Ms. Santos applied for and received TSA assistance from FEMA and \nhas lived in a hotel in Worcester, Massachusetts since February 7, 2018.  If Ms. \nSantos and her two children are evicted from their temporary hotel room, they will \nbe left homeless.  \n20.  Plaintiff RAFAEL OCASIO BARRETO is a 48-year-old man from \nSan Juan, Puerto Rico.  He relocated as a hurricane evacuee to New York City on \nOctober 31, 2017, after first going to Miami, Florida on October 6, 2017, and \nConnecticut on approximately October 16, 2017.  Mr. Ocasio Barreto relocated as \n  -9-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 10 of 48\n \nan evacuee due to his precarious living situation. He currently resides in a hotel \nunder the TSA program in New York.  Mr. Ocasio Barreto has no residence to \nreturn to in Puerto Rico.  He has experienced depression, anxiety and various \nmental health conditions for which he has sought and continues to receive \ntreatment in New York.  Mr. Ocasio Barreto has searched for, but has been \nunsuccessful in securing permanent housing.  If he is evicted from his temporary \nhotel room, he will be left homeless. \n21.  Plaintiff BETHZAIDA CRESPO VICENTE is a 36-year-old woman \nwho self-evacuated from Dorado, Puerto Rico, with her three children and husband \non November 16, 2017.  Ms. Crespo Vicente and her family currently reside in a \nhotel under the TSA program in central Florida.  Ms. Crespo Vicente had rented a \nhome in Puerto Rico, which was completely destroyed by Hurricane Maria.  As a \nresult, she was forced to temporarily relocate to her mother-in-law’s home, where \nnine people were living in a small house with no electricity.  Ms. Crespo Vicente’s \nchildren could not attend school in Puerto Rico, which had been temporarily closed \ndue to the impact of the hurricane.  Ms. Crespo Vicente suffers from manic \ndepressive disorder, anxiety and scoliosis, for which she is awaiting surgery in \nFlorida.  Ms. Crespo Vicente had to undergo emergency surgery in March 2018 to \naddress a growth on her uterus.  Since her recent surgery, she stopped receiving \npublic assistance because her mail was not being accepted at the extended-stay \n  -10-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 11 of 48\n \nhotel where she and her family currently reside.  Ms. Crespo Vicente’s husband is \nworking; however, they have not been able to earn sufficient income to pay the \nsecurity deposit for an apartment or ensure they can adequately cover rental costs \nand transition into permanent housing.  Ms. Crespo Vicente’s husband suffers from \nhigh blood pressure and stomach disorders, which require medical attention that he \nhas sought in Florida.  The Crespo Vicente family has no other available housing \noptions, and if they are evicted from their temporary hotel room, they will be left \nhomeless. \n22.  Plaintiff IRIS OTERO is a 39-year-old woman who self-evacuated \nfrom San Juan, Puerto Rico, with her five children after Hurricane Maria \ndevastated the island.  Ms. Otero is a single mother who was living in public \nhousing that was completely destroyed by the hurricane.  Ms. Otero’s landlord \nwould not repair her apartment or the public housing building in Puerto Rico, \nwhich became infested with rats as the front door to her apartment was blown \naway during the hurricane.  Ms. Otero and her children currently reside in a hotel \nunder the TSA program in central Florida.  Ms. Otero’s three oldest children suffer \nfrom ADHD, a condition of diagnosed hyperactivity that requires ongoing \npsychological or psychiatric care and supervision.  Her children’s schools in Puerto \nRico were closed indefinitely.  Three of Ms. Otero’s children have other learning \ndisabilities, which makes it extremely difficult for her to relocate them again based \n  -11-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 12 of 48\n \non their educational needs and the level of care required for their growth and well-\nbeing.  She has no assistance or support in Puerto Rico to help her re-establish \nherself and her children there, as her mother is elderly and suffers from several \nmedical conditions.  Ms. Otero has not received public assistance in Florida and \ncannot afford to move to more permanent housing.  Ms. Otero feels desperate and \nscared and has suffered from insomnia and stress at the prospect of finding herself \nand her five children homeless.  Ms. Otero and her children have no other available \nhousing options, and if they are evicted from their temporary hotel room, they will \nbe left homeless. \nB.  CLASS PLAINTIFFS \n23.  Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf and on behalf of all \nthose similarly situated. \n24.  Plaintiffs seek to represent a class consisting of all persons who (a) as \nof September 16, 2017, resided in Puerto Rico, declared to be a Federal Disaster \nArea due to Hurricane Maria; (b) have applied for and received TSA under the \nStafford Act, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 5174(a) through (d) and the federal \nregulations promulgated thereunder; (c) are currently residing in TSA housing; (d) \nhave not been able to secure alternative housing; and (e) will have their TSA \ndiscontinued upon expiry of the TRO or such other temporary relief ordered by the \nCourt.  \n  -12-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 13 of 48\n \n25.  Each of the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) is \nmet. \n26.  Members of the class are so numerous that joinder of all members is  \nimpracticable, and individual litigation by each would necessarily and substantially  \nburden the operation of the judicial system and is prohibitive because the \nindividual class members lack the knowledge and financial means to maintain \nindividual actions.  In addition, the prosecution of separate actions by individual \nclass members would create a risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications \nestablishing incompatible rules of law for the provision of disaster relief.   \n27.  The number of class members can best be estimated from records in \nthe control of Defendants.  They are believed to number in the hundreds. \n28.  There is a well-defined community of interest in the questions of law  \nand fact involving the claims of the members of the class, in that FEMA has \nsystemically applied the policies and practices challenged in this action to \nwrongfully, arbitrarily, discriminatorily and unequally discontinue the TSA \nprogram under the Stafford Act before evacuees have secured alternative housing.   \nThere are common questions of law or fact. \n29.  The claims of the named Plaintiffs are typical of the class members in \nthat each named Plaintiff, due to the challenged policies and practices of FEMA: \n(a) has been displaced by Hurricane Maria and/or had their primary pre-disaster \n  -13-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 14 of 48\n \nresidence rendered uninhabitable; (b) is currently receiving TSA; and (c) will be \ndisplaced if FEMA discontinues TSA as it threatens to do.  \n30.  The named Plaintiffs will adequately and fairly represent and protect  \nthe interests of the class because each named Plaintiff has suffered the same or \nsimilar harm, and has the same or similar interest in redress of his/her rights as all \nother members of the class, and thus their interests overlap and do not conflict.  \nThe attorneys representing Plaintiffs, LatinoJustice PRLDEF, Manatt, Phelps, & \nPhillips, LLP and Hector E. Pineiro, are experienced and capable litigators \npossessed of sufficient resources to adequately protect and represent the interests \nof the Plaintiff class. \n31.  The requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) are met \nin that the regulations, practices and procedures which are the subject of this \nlawsuit have been applied to the members of the class as a whole, and Defendants \nhave acted and refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby \nmaking appropriate final injunctive relief and corresponding declaratory relief with \nrespect to the class as a whole.  A class action is the exclusive method by which  \nthe interests of all affected persons can be adequately protected. \nC.  DEFENDANTS \n32.  Defendant Federal Emergency Management Agency was created in \n1979 as a result of the merging of several federal agencies that handled disaster-\n  -14-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 15 of 48\n \nrelated responsibilities. FEMA is the federal agency designated by the President to \nadminister the THA program in accordance with the provisions of the Stafford Act \nand the federal regulations.  As an agency of the federal government, FEMA’s \nactions are directed and carried out by other agencies and individuals.  When used \nin this Complaint, the acronym “FEMA” shall be understood to refer not only to \nthat agency, but to the Defendants listed below as well. \n33.  Defendant William Brock Long has been the Director of FEMA from \nJune 20, 2017, through the present. \n34.  Defendant Thomas Van Essen is the FEMA Regional Director with \nadministrative responsibility for FEMA’s response to Hurricane Maria victims \nfrom Puerto Rico. \n35.  Defendant Alejandro De La Campa is the Director of FEMA’s \nCaribbean Area Division, which implements and coordinates all emergency \nmanagement programs in Puerto Rico.   \nIV.  \nBASIS FOR RELIEF \n36.  This action and the relief requested are authorized under 28 \nU.S.C. § 1361, 28 U.S.C. § 2201, 28 U.S.C. § 2202, 28 U.S.C. § 2412(b), 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 5151, 5174, and 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq. and the federal regulations \npromulgated thereunder, and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to  \n  -15-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 16 of 48\n \nthe United States Constitution. \n37.  Under the Stafford Act, victims of a disaster are eligible for “financial \nor other assistance” to meet their housing needs if they have been “displaced from \ntheir pre-disaster primary residences,” or their pre-disaster primary residences “are \nrendered uninhabitable as a result of damage caused by a major disaster.”   \n42 U.S.C. § 5174(b)(1). \n38.  42 U.S.C. § 5170b(a)(3)(B), also known as the Stafford Act’s “public \nassistance” provision, gives FEMA the power to perform “work or services \nessential to saving lives and protecting and preserving property or public health \nand safety, including . . . emergency shelter . . .”  Under this authority, FEMA \nprovides short-term TSA to disaster survivors who cannot return to their homes \nafter congregate shelters have closed.  In most cases, assistance is provided \nthrough direct payments to hotels and motels.  \n39.  Under the Stafford Act, victims of a disaster are also eligible for  \nTemporary Housing Assistance.  THA is available for 18 months from the date that  \nthe President declared a disaster, but may be extended beyond that time.  44 \nC.F.R. § 206.110(e).  \n40.  There are four forms of THA: (1) money for renting alternate housing \n(“Direct Rental Assistance”), (2) rent-free occupancy in federally provided \ntemporary housing, (3) money for repair of owner-occupied housing, and (4)  \n  -16-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 17 of 48\n \nmoney for replacement of owner-occupied housing.  42 U.S.C. § 5174(c); 44  \nC.F.R. § 206.117(b). \n41.  Applications for THA, and for the distribution of federal benefits \npursuant to the Stafford Act, must be done in “an equitable and impartial manner, \nwithout discrimination on the grounds of race, color, religion, nationality, sex, age,  \nor economic status.”  42 U.S.C. § 5151(a). \n42.  On September 18, 2017, President Donald J. Trump declared a state of \nemergency in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  President Trump’s declaration \nrequired FEMA to provide assistance in a nondiscriminatory manner under the \nStafford Act.  FEMA’s duty to provide assistance to victims of Hurricane Maria \nwas mandatory, not discretionary.  \nV.  \nSUMMARY OF FACTS \nA.  PUERTO RICO \n43.  Puerto Rico, officially known as the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico  \n(Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico), is an unincorporated territory of the \nUnited States, located in the northeastern Caribbean.  Puerto Rico is only 100 miles \nlong by 35 miles wide, making it the smallest island of the Greater Antilles.  Puerto \nRico consists of an archipelago that includes the main island of Puerto Rico and \n  -17-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 18 of 48\n \nseveral smaller islands—Vieques, Culebra, Mona and numerous islets—all \nravaged by Hurricane Maria.  \n44.  For more than a century, Puerto Rico and its residents (which number  \n3.4 million) have occupied a unique place as American citizens, but are culturally, \nlinguistically and economically distinct from most citizens born in the continental \nUnited States.   \n45.  Economically, Puerto Rico was suffering before Maria.  Some 45 \npercent of the island’s 3.4 million residents lived in poverty with an unemployment \nrate of 10.5 percent and more than 16,000 homeowners were facing foreclosure.  In \ncontrast, less than 13 percent of Americans as a whole live below the poverty line.  \nComparative studies regarding the forms of vulnerabilities between Puerto Rico, \nFlorida and affected Hurricane counties in Texas after the hurricanes that affected \nthose regions found poverty rates in affected counties in Texas at 15% (2016) \nversus Florida 14.7% and Puerto Rico 43.5%.  Compounding the predicament of \nthe evacuees in the TSA program, the Government of Puerto Rico before Irma or \nMaria found itself in a debt crisis with more than $73 billion in bond debt as well \nas over $50 billion in pension obligations.2 \n46.  While Puerto Ricans are citizens of the United States, they have  \n                                                 \n2 https://www.oxfamamerica.org/explore/research-publications/far-from-recovery-\npuerto-rico-six-months-after-hurricane-maria/. \n  -18-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 19 of 48\n \nunique national origin and identity, and discrimination on such basis or on the  \nbasis of their “citizenship” as Puerto Ricans is strictly prohibited under the  \nConstitution.  Zappa v. Cruz, 30 F. Supp. 2d 123, 129-30 (D.P.R. 1998), aff’d sub \nnom. DiMarco-Zappa v. Cabanillas, 238 F.3d 25 (1st Cir. 2001).  Such \ndiscrimination, as well as discrimination based on race, color, economic status, \nEnglish proficiency and national origin, are directly implicated by FEMA’s \ndisparate treatment of Puerto Rico, Hurricane Maria survivors and the TSA \nevacuees.    \nB.  HURRICANE MARIA \n47.  On September 20, 2017, Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico.  The  \nhurricane, classified as a Category 5 storm, was the worst natural disaster in Puerto  \nRico in over a hundred years, crippling the island’s infrastructure and causing an \nestimated $90 billion in damage.  Maria did not dissipate until October 2, 2017. \n48.   Hurricane Maria devastated the electrical grid, causing a one-hundred \npercent blackout in Puerto Rico and leaving hundreds of thousands of residents \nwithout power for months.  Currently, ten months after the hurricane hit the island,  \nthere are still thousands of residents whose electricity has not yet been restored.  \n49.   The hurricane severely, if not permanently, damaged tens of \nthousands of homes and left nearly 75,000 Puerto Ricans without housing.  \n  -19-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 20 of 48\n \nAlthough this problem has yet to be fully resolved, FEMA insists that the Plaintiffs \nand class members who have no safe or habitable home on the island must return  \nto Puerto Rico rather than remain in TSA-financed housing. \n50.   Many municipalities throughout the island were without potable \nwater, or any kind of running water, for weeks or months at a time, creating a \npublic health hazard and concern for healthcare and nutritional assistance for all \nresidents.  \n51.  As a result of the lack of drinking water, combined with contaminated  \nsources of water that residents were told were safe for drinking, cases of \nleptospirosis, a potentially deadly bacterial disease that is water-borne, began to \nbreak out, putting at risk up to two million residents of Puerto Rico.3  \n52.  The lack of electricity and infrastructure damage extended to  \nhealthcare facilities and hospitals; most were running on generators, and some had \nno electricity even by generators.  Residents were told not to seek out healthcare \nservices unless it was an emergency, given the lack of medical equipment,  \npersonnel, facilities in a condition to tend to patients, and electricity.  \n53.  It is estimated that the lack of available and accessible healthcare  \n                                                 \n3 https://q13fox.com/2018/07/03/bacterial-disease-in-puerto-rico-blamed-for-\ndeaths-after-hurricane-maria/.  \n  -20-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 21 of 48\n \nservices, electricity, food and drinking water, in addition to widespread \nenvironmental and water contamination, dangerous housing conditions, broken \ninfrastructure, damaged roads and centralization of aid led to the deaths of \napproximately 4,645 Puerto Ricans, and perhaps thousands more—a number far  \nhigher than in either Hurricane Harvey or Irma.4  \n54.  Since the hurricane, Puerto Rico has seen a steep increase in the \nnumber of suicides and mental health issues, including post-traumatic stress \ndisorder.  \n55.   As a result of the damage inflicted on Puerto Rico by Hurricane \nMaria, thousands of Puerto Ricans became displaced and sought assistance on the \nmainland United States.  It is estimated that between 100,000 and 300,000 Puerto \nRicans left the island in the months following the hurricane to seek stable housing, \nemployment and healthcare services.  In addition, Puerto Ricans have left the \nisland pursuing schooling options as 265 schools have closed on the island since \nHurricane Maria.5     \n56.   Evacuees are spread out across the country, with the highest  \nconcentration in Florida, particularly central Florida, as well as in the New York \nCity metropolitan and tri-state area, Philadelphia, Chicago, Boston, Pennsylvania  \n                                                 \n4 https://www.wsj.com/articles/puerto-rico-data-suggests-hurricane-maria-death-\ntoll-is-much-higher-1528928688.  \n5 https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/us/puerto-rico-school-closings.html.  \n  -21-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 22 of 48\n \nand elsewhere throughout the United States.  \n57.   Many evacuees are families or single parents with children, who have \nalready been enrolled in local schools.  Some of the evacuees are elderly \nindividuals who have arrived by themselves, with no family support or alternative  \nhousing options. \nC.  THE FEDERAL RESPONSE TO MARIA COMPARED TO \nRESPONSES TO HURRICANES IRMA AND HARVEY \n58.  As Hurricane Maria ravaged Puerto Rico, FEMA relief efforts were \nwell underway in Florida and Texas in response to Hurricanes Irma and Harvey, \nrespectively.  A comparison of FEMA’s response (as widely reported by media, \nnonprofit organizations and FEMA itself) to these three (and other) hurricanes \ncompels the conclusion that FEMA’s response in Puerto Rico was not only \ninadequate, it was also unequal and discriminatory in violation of law. \n59.  FEMA’s unequal treatment of Puerto Ricans started before Maria hit  \nthe island.  In preparation for both Harvey and Irma, FEMA was on the ground \nbefore each storm made landfall.  For Hurricane Harvey, FEMA had supplies and \npersonnel positioned in Texas before the storm made landfall on August 25, 2017.  \nWithin days, the number of FEMA employees, other federal agencies, and the \nNational Guard deployed exceeded 31,000.  Despite being already positioned in \nHouston in response to Harvey, even more federal personnel responded to \nHurricane Irma when it made landfall in Florida on September 10, 2017.  More \n  -22-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 23 of 48\n \nthan 40,000 federal personnel, including 2,650 FEMA staff, were in place four \ndays later.  In comparison (according to a FEMA tweet on September 25, 2017) \nonly 10,000 federal staff were on the ground in Puerto Rico and the Virgin  \nIslands—almost a week after Maria hit the ground.6  \n60.   FEMA’s unequal response in Puerto Rico continued after Maria made \nlandfall.  For instance, within six days of Hurricane Harvey hitting Texas, U.S. \nNorthern Command had deployed 73 helicopters over Houston, which are critical \nfor saving victims and delivering emergency supplies.  It took more than three \ntimes as long after Maria hit before there were as many helicopters in the air. \n61.  Within 9 days of Harvey hitting Texas, FEMA had approved $141.8 \nmillion in individual assistance to Harvey victims.  Within 9 days after Maria, \nFEMA had approved only $6.2 million for Maria victims.  During the same time \nperiod, FEMA provided 5.1 million meals, 4.5 million liters of water and over \n20,000 tarps to Houston; but within 9 days of Maria, it delivered only 1.6 million \nmeals, 2.8 million liters of water and roughly 5,000 tarps to Puerto Rico.   \n62.  The contrast with Irma is starker.  Within 9 days of Irma, FEMA \ndelivered 10.9 million meals, 7 million liters of water and over 98,000 tarps.  \nWithin just 4 days of Irma hitting the ground, FEMA had transferred 6.6 million \nmeals and 4.7 million liters of water to states in the Southeast. \n                                                 \n6 https://twitter.com/fema/status/912340037882216449.  \n  -23-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 24 of 48\n \n63.  FEMA’s comparatively slow approach in Puerto Rico (which had \nalready been impacted by Irma as well) continued long after FEMA’s initial \nmobilization.  For instance, FEMA took 43 days to approve permanent disaster \nwork for Puerto Rico.  The agency approved similar work for Texas within 10 days \nafter Harvey.  The federal government has also placed a host of unique regulatory \nhurdles and conditions on Puerto Rico’s receipt of aid.  FEMA’s uneven and \ndiscriminatory treatment of Maria survivors continues. \nD.  FEMA PROVIDES TRANSITIONAL SHELTERING ASSISTANCE \nTO EVACUEES.  \n64.   On October 30, 2017, FEMA announced that TSA would be available \nto Puerto Ricans “unable to return to their homes because they are displaced as a \nresult of Hurricanes Irma and Maria.” (FEMA News Release Number DR-4339-PR \nNR 038.)  FEMA explained that “Transitional Sheltering Assistance allows eligible \napplicants to shelter in a hotel or motel, for a limited period of time, as a bridge to \nintermediate and longer-term housing.”  FEMA also promised to provide \ntransportation to TSA evacuees for their return to Puerto Rico, but noted that  \n“[a]pplicants should expect that it may take several weeks to arrange \ntransportation, given the limited availability of commercial flights.”  \n65.  Prior to Hurricane Maria, TSA had only been offered to survivors of  \nnatural disasters whose home were rendered uninhabitable.  However, following \nHurricane Maria, based on information and belief, FEMA extended the TSA \n  -24-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 25 of 48\n \nprogram to all Puerto Rican evacuees due to the overall devastation of \ninfrastructure on the island, depriving citizens of basic necessities such as water \nand electricity, in addition to safe, habitable shelter.   \n66.  Among the displaced Puerto Rican evacuees, thousands began \nreceiving TSA from FEMA, which included vouchers for extended stays in hotels \naround the country or in temporary housing facilities, although some were denied \nthese benefits outright.  Many of the households that initially received TSA were \nlater cut off.  Many thousands more left the island and likely found family \nmembers, friends, or acquaintances to stay with, even if temporarily.  Others have \nended up directly in homeless shelter systems throughout various states.  The TSA \nprogram was scheduled to end for Puerto Ricans on January 13, 2018, leaving the \nremaining TSA evacuees still in hotels and motels with no place to go.   \n67.  In a memorandum, date stamped December 29, 2017, FEMA  \napproved a TSA extension to run from January 14, 2018 through March 20, 2018.  \nFEMA noted that “[t]his extension [wa]s needed due to a large number of damaged \nhomes across the island and lack of available utilities in many areas.  Survivors are \nstill in need of short-term, temporary sheltering options while their homes are \nrestored and repaired.”  These conditions persist today.  \n68.  The extension did not apply to all TSA evacuees.  Throughout the  \nTSA process, FEMA has periodically ended eligibility for certain Maria survivors,  \n  -25-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 26 of 48\n \nreducing the number of overall TSA evacuees that remain in the program.   \n69.  On April 20, 2018, FEMA approved another extension of the TSA \nprogram.  In its news release announcing the extension (FEMA News Release \nNumber 159), FEMA stated that of approximately 2,800 TSA evacuees remaining \nin the program, 1,700 were now ineligible for TSA, but would be allowed to \ncontinue participating.  Many of these evacuees had been pressured into \n“voluntarily” withdrawing their applications or were deemed to have voluntarily \nwithdrawn an application after being unavailable for an on-site inspection.  Many \nothers did not own a home that was damaged but had nevertheless been displaced \nfrom their residences (whether rentals or otherwise) and had no place to return to \nin Puerto Rico.  These economic circumstances now rendered them ineligible for \nTSA according to FEMA.  Nevertheless, FEMA allowed them to continue  \nparticipating in the program.   \n70.  In total, the TSA program was extended at least three times in order to \navoid massive secondary displacement of TSA evacuees, the overwhelming \nmajority of whom had not been able to secure employment or long-term housing. \n71.  Prior to each extension, individuals and families participating in the \nTSA program experienced anxiety and high levels of uncertainty about what would \nhappen to them, given inconsistent and deficient communications from FEMA, and \nthe stark reality that most evacuees had not been successful in securing longer-term  \n  -26-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 27 of 48\n \nhousing or employment. \nE.  DEFENDANTS PLAN TO TERMINATE TSA AS SOON AS THE \nTRO EXPIRES. \n72.  The current TSA program for victims of Hurricane Maria was  \nscheduled to permanently expire on June 30, 2018, and FEMA has stated that it \nwill not consider any further extension requests. \n73.  Hundreds of families are still in hotels under TSA, unsure where they \nwill go when FEMA terminates TSA.  Unable to secure alternative longer-term \nhousing solutions, they will likely end up in homeless shelters, return to precarious \nhousing and employment situations in Puerto Rico, or worse—living on the street.  \nFamilies currently under the TSA program have asked that the program be \nextended until they can transition to long-term housing. \n74.  There are approximately 2,000 TSA evacuees throughout the United  \nStates, including Plaintiffs, who (a) were displaced from their homes by Hurricane  \nMaria; (b) were given a voucher by FEMA to seek lodging in a hotel; (c) have \nremained in the TSA program until the present time with FEMA paying for their \ntemporary hotel residences; (d) are still unable to either return to their previous \nhomes or secure adequate alternative permanent housing; and (e) have reasonably \nrelied, in making long-term housing plans, on the expectation that FEMA would \ncontinue to support them with the TSA program until they can either return to their \nhomes or find other sustainable permanent housing.  \n  -27-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 28 of 48\n \n75.  While receiving federal assistance from FEMA, most TSA evacuees \nare ineligible for local benefits and housing assistance.  If TSA assistance to these \nhurricane victims is revoked, they will become homeless.  \n76.  TSA evacuees have no other housing options open to them.  They do \nnot have family members with whom they can stay, and they cannot return to \nPuerto Rico because there are no housing options for them.  Most have lost their \njobs and have no source of employment to go back to.  In addition, many, \nincluding Plaintiffs, left Puerto Rico to seek healthcare for conditions they had that \nbecame aggravated as a result of lack of proper medical attention in Puerto Rico \nafter the hurricane, and others have developed serious conditions or illnesses since \ntheir arrival.  They need to remain in their current location, where they can \ncontinue to receive treatment and care for illnesses that include cancer,  \nhypertension, diabetes and asthma.  \n77.  If the remaining TSA evacuees are evicted without the requested \nrelief, and no local or state government programs are immediately put in place to \nsecure stable housing for them, they will become homeless and suffer irreparable \ninjury. \n78.  Upon information and belief, Plaintiffs and putative class members  \nhave been actively working to secure permanent or longer-term housing.  They \ncontinue to do so. \n  -28-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 29 of 48\n \n79.  There are several ways in which FEMA can ensure that evacuees \nwhose TSA is terminated are not left homeless. \n80.  FEMA has the ability to enter into an Inter-Agency Agreement (IAA)  \nwith the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to initiate the  \nDisaster Housing Assistance Program (DHAP), as they did after Hurricane Katrina \nand Hurricane Sandy.  FEMA has represented that “DHAP is not necessary to \nhouse displaced disaster survivors” because “FEMA collaborates directly with \nHUD to find housing solutions for disaster survivors and is providing a variety of \nhousing programs to adequately meet the unique needs of survivors that are more \ntimely and effective than DHAP.”7  FEMA has not kept this promise.  \n81.  FEMA also has the ability to extend Direct Rental Assistance to all of \nthe TSA evacuees in order to help them secure longer-term housing options, \nincluding apartment leases that would allow them to contract housing for longer \nperiods of time.  As of now, and upon information and belief, this program has \nbeen extended to remarkably few TSA evacuees.  Some evacuees have applied for \nTHA, but have not received it.   \n82.  FEMA unlawfully set the final TSA deadline for June 30, 2018, \nwithout a plan for transitioning into longer-term or long-term housing some 2,000 \n                                                 \n7 FEMA Media Library (May 3, 2018), available at https://www.fema.gov/media-\nlibrary/assets/images/163928.   \n  -29-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 30 of 48\n \nindividuals who have faced severe trauma and who have lost most, if not all, of \ntheir belongings, their homes, and their jobs and who face healthcare challenges.  \nBefore FEMA’s planned eviction of TSA evacuees on June 30, 2018, some hotels \nreceived notification that FEMA would no longer pay for Plaintiffs and all TSA \nevacuees’ stays.  Some hotels then sent notices to evacuees that they would be \nresponsible for payment as of July 1, 2018.  For some evacuees, this was the only \nnotice of benefits termination that they received.  TSA evacuees and Plaintiffs are \nterrified at the possibility of being evicted with no alternative housing options \navailable.  \n83.  This litigation seeks to stop the eviction of TSA evacuees from their \nhotels without any alternative housing.  \nF.  LIKE ITS INITIAL RESPONSE TO MARIA, FEMA’S PROVISION \nOF TSA TO MARIA SURVIVORS HAS BEEN INEQUITABLY \nBELOW TSA LEVELS AFTER IRMA AND HARVEY.   \n84.   The amount and timing of TSA in response to Hurricane Maria has \nbeen unequal and discriminatory in comparison to other U.S. hurricanes. \n85.  FEMA has provided TSA assistance to victims of Hurricane Maria for \nonly nine months.  However, after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, FEMA extended \ntemporary housing assistance, which would have included TSA, for up to 26 \n  -30-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 31 of 48\n \nmonths for evacuees.8  After that, FEMA provided additional transitional housing \nassistance to the victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita through DHAP.  FEMA \nhas arbitrarily and capriciously decided not to extend those same benefits to \nPlaintiffs and the putative class.  Such conduct is also unequal and discriminatory \nin violation of law.  \n86.  From the outset, FEMA’s review of applications for individual \nassistance after Maria appeared motivated by discriminatory intent.  FEMA grant \ndenials in Puerto Rico were nearly double the number of denials for individual \nassistance in Texas after Harvey.   \n87.  Hurricane Harvey destroyed far fewer homes in Texas than Hurricane \nMaria did in Puerto Rico.  Yet FEMA provided TSA to far fewer Puerto Rican \nsurvivors than to their Texan counterparts.  According to FEMA: “Over the last 10 \nmonths, the TSA program has provided shelter to more than 60,000 households in \nPuerto Rico and Texas, making it the longest emergency shelter mission in the \nhistory of the program.” (https://www.fema.gov/media-\nlibrary/assets/videos/166770.)  Yet FEMA has separately acknowledged that the \noverwhelming majority, at least 54,637, of these affected households are Texan \nfamilies, not Puerto Ricans.  (FEMA News Release No. TRO-NR-004.)    \n                                                 \n8 https://www.fema.gov/news-release/2009/04/07/fema-temporary-housing-\nprogram-ending-families-hurricanes-katrina-and-rita.  \n  -31-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 32 of 48\n \n88.  FEMA also provided TSA for a longer period of time to Harvey \nevacuees than to Maria evacuees despite significant preexisting infrastructural and \nsocioeconomic inequalities that make recovery in Puerto Rico substantially more \ndifficult.  FEMA extended TSA to Harvey evacuees seven times (compared to the \nthree extensions it granted to Maria survivors).  And, although FEMA planned to \nterminate TSA for the survivors of both hurricanes on the same day, June 30, 2018, \nFEMA initiated TSA to Texans two months before it launched the program for \nPuerto Rican evacuees.  FEMA’s unequal and discriminatory treatment of Puerto \nRico and its residents occurred before, during and after the hurricane.     \n89.  There is one other key distinction between Puerto Rican and Texan \nsurvivors of the respective hurricanes—Puerto Rican survivors still have no place \nto go once FEMA kicks them out of TSA-participating hotels.  FEMA’s arbitrary \nJune 30, 2018, termination of TSA benefits was directly aimed at (or targeted) \nthose individuals who have virtually no resources, economic or otherwise.  If \nevicted without the requested relief, as FEMA has stated its intent to do, Plaintiffs \nand the putative class would suffer irreparable injury.  \nG.  DEFENDANTS’ CONDUCT HAS AND WILL PROXIMATELY \nCAUSE IRREPARABLE HARM TO PLAINTIFFS, CLASS \nMEMBERS AND THE PUBLIC. \n90.  Defendants’ wrongful conduct has caused and will continue to cause \nPlaintiffs and class members irreparable harm and injury in that, absent judicial \n  -32-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 33 of 48\n \nrelief, they will be wrongfully denied and delayed essential housing assistance that \nis necessary for their health and welfare. \n91.  Without that housing assistance, Plaintiffs, class members, and their \nfamilies will be unable to remain continuously in affordable housing and will face \nthe threat of probable homelessness. \n92.  Before their evacuation from the island and relocation to TSA \nhousing, many Plaintiffs, class members and their families were forced to live in \nintolerable, unsafe and unsanitary conditions as a result of Hurricane Maria and \ninadequate disaster relief, which has caused new medical conditions and \ncomplicated existing medical conditions.  Without the requested relief, many \nothers will also be forced to live in those same intolerable, unsafe and unsanitary  \nconditions. \n93.  Many Plaintiffs, class members and their families, have been \ndisplaced and evacuated to distant places around the country, often by FEMA, and \nleft without housing assistance and the means to return to their communities.  \n94.  The lack of housing assistance for Plaintiffs, class members and their \nfamilies has also served to split families and tear households apart. \n95.  Defendants’ knowing and continued failure and refusal to provide \nhousing assistance to thousands of individuals and families, who will be evicted \nfrom their current TSA shelters, is causing, and will likely continue to cause, \n  -33-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 34 of 48\n \nfurther destitution, homelessness, hunger and stress.  As a consequence, the risk of \nillness will be increased and their lives will be endangered. \n96.  Defendants’ intentional and wrongful conduct will also result in \nsignificant costs to the public and waste of taxpayer funds.  The loss of critically \nneeded housing assistance harms those communities which have been destroyed by \nHurricane Maria.  The loss of housing assistance will harm many other \ncommunities throughout the country which have reached out to assist those who \nhave been displaced and evacuated and now will face increased homelessness and, \nconsequently, a higher incidence of persons with mental and emotional distress, \nillness, diseases and substance abuse. \n97.  As a result of the federal government’s failure to fulfill its mandatory  \nduties, misconduct, state and local governments will be required to expend \nsignificant additional funds for the increased use of county health facilities to \nremedy these increased problems. \nH.  PLAINTIFFS AND CLASS MEMBERS HAVE NO ADEQUATE \nREMEDY AT LAW. \n98.  Plaintiffs, class members and their families are without a plain, speedy \nor adequate remedy at law, rendering injunctive relief appropriate in that (a) \ndamages cannot adequately compensate Plaintiffs and the class for their injuries; \n(b) damages for the harm inflicted upon Plaintiffs and the class are difficult to \n  -34-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 35 of 48\n \nascertain; and (c) if the conduct complained of is not enjoined, a multiplicity of \nsuits will result in that FEMA’s unlawful conduct is continuous and ongoing. \nVI.  \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I: \nDEPRIVATION OF DUE PROCESS \nU.S. Const. Amend. V \n(Defendants’ Conduct, Including Termination Of The TSA Program, Violates \nPlaintiffs And Class Members’ Substantive And Procedural Due Process \nRights.) \n \n99.  All prior paragraphs are incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n100.  The Fifth Amendment to the United State Constitution provides that  \nno person shall “be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of  \nlaw[.]”   \n101.  Plaintiffs and the class are entitled to the protections of the Fifth \nAmendment. \n102.  The Due Process Clause has a substantive component that provides \nheightened protection against government interference with fundamental rights and \nliberty interests.  The right to property, shelter and peaceful possession of one’s \nhome are such fundamental rights and liberty interests.  Violation of such rights by \na government entity gives rise to a private right of action to redress such rights \nthrough declaratory, injunctive or other relief.  \n  -35-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 36 of 48\n \n103.  Plaintiffs and similarly situated members of the class, also have \nproperty interests, including a right to retain possession, as current tenants in \npossession of FEMA subsidized hotel/motel units, which have become their only \nhomes.  Plaintiffs have the right to continuing and orderly housing assistance, and \nas eligible disaster victims, they may qualify to receive alternative THA.  They \nalso have a fundamental right to shelter and peaceful possession of their homes.   \nDefendants’ intentional conduct knowingly impinges on these rights. \n104.  Defendants’ termination of TSA without an adequate housing  \nalternative is not necessary to achieve a compelling state interest; nor is it  \nreasonably tailored to address that interest.  \n105.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution also has a procedural component, prohibiting Defendants from \ndepriving Plaintiffs and similarly situated members of the class of their property \ninterests without adequate and timely notice of the type(s) of THA for which they \nqualify or may qualify and appropriate procedures for determining their eligibility \nfor and obtaining such assistance prior to FEMA’s termination of the TSA \nProgram.  \n106.  FEMA has failed to provide Plaintiffs and similarly situated members \nof the class, prior to terminating the TSA Program, with proper notice, information \n  -36-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 37 of 48\n \nand procedures for determining their eligibility or continuing eligibility for THA, \nincluding the programs mentioned above, so that continuing assistance is assured. \n107.  FEMA’s failure to provide Plaintiffs and similarly situated members  \nof the class, prior to terminating the TSA Program, with proper information and  \nprocedures (in a manner and language that Plaintiffs and TSA evacuees can \nunderstand) regarding eligibility for alternative and continuing THA prevents or \nfrustrates Plaintiffs and similarly situated members of their class in obtaining \nalternative THA, resulting in homelessness and inadequate housing. \n108.  This amounts to a deprivation of a property interest without adequate  \nnotice and other due process. \n109.  As a result, Defendants have violated the rights of Plaintiffs and \nsimilarly situated members of the class under Due Process of law as guaranteed by \nthe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n110.  Plaintiffs are entitled to a judicial declaration that (a) Plaintiffs have a \nright to stay in possession of their current shelter; and (b) Defendants’ termination \nof the TSA Program as described above violates Plaintiffs’ and class members’ \nconstitutional rights.  Plaintiffs are further entitled to injunctive relief restraining \nand/or enjoining Defendants from terminating TSA without the process prayed for \nbelow and an adequate housing alternative. \n/// \n  -37-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 38 of 48\n \nCOUNT II:  \nVIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT  \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B) \n(Defendants’ Conduct Should Be Declared Unlawful And/Or Set Aside \nBecause It Is Contrary To Constitutional Right, Power, Privilege, Or \nImmunity.) \n \n111.  All prior paragraphs are incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n112.  The APA empowers the Court to “hold unlawful and set aside agency \naction, findings, and conclusions” that are “contrary to constitutional right, power, \nprivilege, or immunity.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B).  In addition, this Court has \nauthority under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and its traditional powers of equity to declare  \ninvalid and enjoin agency action that violates the Constitution. \n113.  Where a Complaint contends that agency action offends the \nConstitution, and for that reason should be enjoined, the Court does not afford \ndeference to the agency, but instead reviews the constitutional issues \nindependently.  \n114.  As detailed above, Defendants’ conduct violates Plaintiffs’ \nsubstantive and procedural due process rights, including, without limitation, by \ndepriving Plaintiffs of their fundamental right to shelter and peaceful possession of \ntheir homes; and doing so without constitutional safeguards, including, without \nlimitation, proper notice and an opportunity to be heard.  \n115.  Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaratory judgment that Defendants’ \ntermination of the TSA Program is unlawful and should be set aside.  \n  -38-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 39 of 48\n \nCOUNT III:  \nVIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT  \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) \n(Defendants’ Conduct Should Be Declared Unlawful And/Or Set Aside \nBecause It Is Arbitrary, Capricious, An Abuse Of Discretion, Or Otherwise \nNot In Accordance With Law.) \n \n116.  All prior paragraphs are incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n117.  The APA requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside” agency \naction that is, among other things, “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \notherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  Agency action is \narbitrary and capricious if it is not the product of reasoned decision making.  This \nmeans, among other things, that an agency must provide an adequate evidentiary \nbasis for its action and consider all important aspects of the problem before it. \n118.  Defendants’ decision to terminate the TSA Program on June 30, 2018, \nlong before Puerto Rico has recovered from Hurricane Maria, and before TSA \nevacuees are able to apply for and secure THA, or alternative housing, was made \nwithout any plan to assist TSA evacuees in securing housing.  This decision was \nwithout reason and is arbitrary and capricious.  \n119.  Defendants’ decision to terminate the TSA on June 30, 2018, violated \nthe APA’s prohibition against “arbitrary and capricious” agency action.  FEMA’s \nstated purpose for terminating this support for the class members was that the \nagency did not think DHAP is needed.  This was contrary to the stark facts and the \nreality faced by the Puerto Rican victims of Hurricane Maria who still rely on \n  -39-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 40 of 48\n \nFEMA assistance to survive and avoid homelessness.  The stated purpose of \nterminating the program was not borne out by the facts, and was pretext for other \nunstated and ulterior purposes.  FEMA decision to terminate the TSA program \nupon expiry of the TRO is also arbitrary and capricious. \n120.  FEMA has given inadequate consideration, if any, to the viability of  \npossible alternatives for TSA evacuees, including Direct Rental Assistance, upon \ntermination of their short-term housing benefits.  \n121.  Plaintiffs and class members have suffered a legal wrong.  \nDefendants’ violation has caused and will continue to cause ongoing, irreparable \nharm to Plaintiffs and class members who have been adversely affected and  \naggrieved by FEMA’s arbitrary and capricious conduct. \n122.  An actual controversy exists between Plaintiffs and Defendants  \nregarding whether Defendants’ termination of the TSA Program violates Section  \n706(2)(A) of the APA. \n123.  Plaintiffs are entitled to a judicial declaration that Defendants’ \ntermination of the TSA Program as described above is unlawful and should be set \naside.  \nCOUNT IV:  \nVIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT  \n5 U.S.C. § 706(1) \n(Defendants Should Be Compelled To Provide The Relief They Have \nUnlawfully Withheld Or Unreasonably Delayed.) \n  -40-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 41 of 48\n \n124.  All prior paragraphs are incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n125.  The APA also requires courts to “compel agency action unlawfully \nwithheld or unreasonably delayed.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  As detailed above, \nDefendants have arbitrarily and capriciously decided to terminate benefits to TSA  \nevacuees without any plan in place to transition them into longer-term housing.  \n126.  Defendants’ refusal to activate DHAP or other relief (as they are \nobligated to do) before terminating benefits under the Transitional Shelter \nAssistance Program constitutes an unlawful withholding and/or an unreasonable \ndelay of agency action—particularly in light of FEMA’s concurrent decision to \nevict Plaintiffs and class members from their homes.   \n127.  FEMA has elected to evict Plaintiffs, class members and their families \nfrom their temporary homes, while simultaneously withholding benefits that \nFEMA has historically provided in similar situations, including after Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita, to ensure that the termination of TSA does not result in \nhomelessness or worse.  \n128.  Plaintiffs are entitled to a permanent injunction restraining and/or \nenjoining Defendants from terminating TSA until Plaintiffs and class members \nhave received sufficient THA to transition to longer-term housing; or Defendants \nimplement an adequate replacement solution.  Plaintiffs are further entitled to a \npermanent injunction compelling Defendants to accept and process all applications \n  -41-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 42 of 48\n \nfor THA from TSA evacuees for a reasonable period of time, and to notify \napplicants and class members concerning all forms of THA available to them and \nthe criteria and conditions applicable to such assistance. \nCOUNT V: \nDECLARATORY JUDGMENT \n28 U.S.C. § 2201 \n129.  All prior paragraphs are incorporated as if fully set forth herein.  \n130.  The Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. Section 2201, allows the \nCourt to “declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking \nsuch declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought.” \n131.  Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration of their rights.  Plaintiffs have a  \nproperty interest in their current temporary shelter and are entitled to additional \nhousing assistance under the Stafford Act.  \n132.  Plaintiffs are further entitled to a declaration that (a) Defendants’  \ntermination of the TSA Program as described above constitutes agency action that \nis unlawful and should be set aside under the Administrative Procedure Act; and \nthat violates Plaintiffs and Class Members’ constitutional rights; (b) Defendants \nhave unlawfully withheld and unreasonably delayed activation of any assistance or \nprogram to replace TSA; and (c) Defendants have unlawfully discriminated in \ndisaster assistance. \n  -42-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 43 of 48\n \nCOUNT VI: \nEQUAL PROTECTION \nU.S. Const. Amend. V \n (Defendants Conduct Has Denied And Continues To Deny TSA Evacuees \nEqual Protection Under The Law.) \n133.  All prior paragraphs are incorporated as if fully set forth herein.  \n134.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution also contains an equal protection component that prohibits the federal \ngovernment from denying equal protection of the law. \n135.  Plaintiffs and the class are entitled to the protections of the Fifth \nAmendment. \n136.  Defendants’ conduct towards Plaintiffs and the class constitutes \ndiscrimination on the basis of race, national origin and kind of American \ncitizenship, all suspect classifications.  FEMA has provided a lesser level of \nhousing assistance to Plaintiffs and the class because they are Puerto Rican.  \n137.  Defendants were substantially motivated by an intent to discriminate  \nagainst Puerto Ricans on each of the foregoing bases.  \n138.  FEMA’s policies have also had a disparate impact on Plaintiffs and \nthe class in further violation of the equal protection component of the Due Process \nClause. \n  -43-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 44 of 48\n \n139.  Defendants’ termination of TSA without an adequate housing \nalternative in place for Plaintiffs and the class is not necessary to achieve a \ncompelling state interest; nor is it reasonably tailored to address that interest. \nCOUNT VI: \nDISCRIMINATION IN DISASTER ASSISTANCE \n28 U.S.C. § 5151(a); 44 C.F.R. § 7.3 \n140.  All prior paragraphs are incorporated as if fully set forth herein.  \n141.  The Stafford Act provides that disaster “relief and assistance activities \nshall be accomplished in an equitable and impartial manner, without discrimination \non the grounds of race, color, religion, nationality, sex, age, disability, English \nproficiency, or economic status.” \n142.  FEMA regulations provide that no person shall be excluded from or \ndenied benefits or otherwise be subjected to discrimination on the ground of race \ncolor or national origin.  44 C.F.R. § 7.3 \n143.  Defendants’ conduct towards Plaintiffs and the class constitutes \ndiscrimination on the basis of race, color, nationality, English proficiency and \neconomic status.  FEMA has provided a lesser level of housing assistance to  \nPlaintiffs and the class because they are Puerto Rican. \n144.  Defendants were also substantially motivated by an intent to \ndiscriminate against Puerto Ricans on each of the foregoing bases. \n  -44-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 45 of 48\n \n145.  FEMA’s arbitrary actions have not only discriminated against victims \nof Maria based on the basis of economic status prohibited by the Stafford Act, but \nthey have also violated the intent of Congress in providing disaster aid to assure \ncontinuing means of assistance to alleviate the suffering of those most affected by \nHurricane Maria. \n146.  FEMA’s policies have also had a disparate impact on Plaintiffs and \nthe class in further violation of the Stafford Act’s nondiscrimination provision. \nVII.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs and Class Members respectfully request that this this \nCourt: \nA.  Issue a declaratory judgment that (1) Plaintiffs have a right to retain \npossession of their current shelter and are entitled to additional \nassistance under the Stafford Act; (2) Defendants’ termination of the \nTransitional Shelter Assistance Program as described above (a) \nconstitutes agency action that is unlawful and should be set aside \nunder the Administrative Procedure Act; and (b) violates Plaintiffs \nand Class Members’ constitutional rights; and (3) Defendants have \nunlawfully withheld and unreasonably delayed activation of any \nTemporary Housing Assistance or program to replace the Transitional \n  -45-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 46 of 48\n \nShelter Assistance Program; \nB.  Issue a preliminary injunction restraining and/or enjoining Defendants \nfrom terminating the Transitional Shelter Assistance Program pending \nthe outcome of this litigation;  \nC.  Issue a permanent injunction restraining and/or enjoining Defendants \nfrom terminating the Transitional Shelter Assistance Program until \neither (1) Plaintiffs and Class Members have received sufficient \nTemporary Housing Assistance to transition to longer-term housing; \nor (2) Defendants implement a long-term replacement solution such as \nDHAP or other program that ensures continuing assistance to \nevacuees;  \nD.  Issue a permanent injunction requiring Defendants to: (1) continue to \naccept and process all applications for THA from TSA evacuees by \ntelephone and online for a reasonable period of time following \nissuance of injunctive relief to enable appropriate application by the \nclass of people unlawfully excluded or discouraged from applying for \nTHA; and (2) notify applicants and class members concerning all \nforms of temporary assistance available to them and the criteria and \nconditions applicable to such assistance; and \nE.  Award such further relief as the Court deems appropriate.  \n  -46-   \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 28   Filed 07/12/18   Page 47 of 48\n \n \nDated:  July 12, 2018  Respectfully submitted, \n   \nBy:/s/: Justin Jones Rodriguez \nJustin Jones Rodriguez \nMANATT, PHELPS & PHILLIPS, \nLLP \nCraig J. de Recat* (CA Bar No. \n105567) \nJustin Jones Rodriguez* (CA Bar No. \n279080) \nEve L.

In \nMay, FEMA announced that as of June 30, 2018, it would discontinue Transitional Shelter \nAssistance (“TSA”) for such evacuees. 1 The Plaintiffs have filed suit against the Defendants \nseeking to prevent the termination of benefits under the TSA program for themselves and other \nsimilarly situated persons. They have asserted claims for relief for Deprivation of their Fifth \n                                                 \n  1 In simple terms, the TSA program provides direct funding to hotels and motels, which serve as shelters \nfor individuals and families who are forced to evacuate their damaged or destroyed homes due to a natural disaster.  \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 19   Filed 07/03/18   Page 2 of 4\nAmendment Due Process Rights (Count I), and Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 \nU.S.C. §§ 706(2)(A) and (B), 5 U.S. C. § 706(1)(Counts II--IV). Plaintiffs also seek a \nDeclaratory Judgment (Count V).   \n  On Saturday, June 30, 2018, at 5:24 pm, Plaintiffs filed their Complaint.  Nearly an hour \nlater, they filed Plaintiffs’ Emergency Motion For A Temporary Restraining Order Or \nPreliminary Injunction and Declaratory Relief (Docket No. 2), seeking an order preventing the \nDefendants from terminating their benefits under the TSA program.  Among other relief, \nPlaintiffs also requested that the Defendants be ordered to notify all hotels, motels or other \nfacilities which have been providing housing for Hurricane Maria evacuees that any prior notices \nof termination have been immediately withdrawn and revoked.    \n   After an emergency hearing held via telephone, Judge Sorokin of this Court entered the \nfollowing Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO”): \nThe standard for issuance of an injunction is the familiar four part test. The \nirreparable harm to the plaintiffs is obvious and overwhelming tomorrow morning \nthey will be evicted and homeless since by definition each plaintiff’s home was \nrendered uninhabitable by the hurricane in Puerto Rico, a determination \npreviously made by the defendants. The public interest on balance favors the \nplaintiffs both in terms of their personal interests and considering the specter of \nmany sick individuals without homes of their own being rendered homeless with \nthe resulting drain on other public resources in addition to the possible human \nconsequences. The substantially closer question is whether Plaintiffs have \nestablished a likelihood of success on the merits of one or more of their legal \nclaims. The Plaintiffs in their papers and at the hearing have articulated, at least, \nclaims that they are entitled to (1) reasonable notice of the termination of the \ntemporary housing assistance; (2) assistance as long as they remain eligible; and \n(3) assistance in transition to other housing. In addition, they assert that FEMA in \nprior roughly equivalent disasters has extended the temporary housing assistance \nsubstantially longer than in the present disaster. On the record before the Court, \nwhich is admittedly limited in that the government has had only the most limited \nopportunity to respond, the Plaintiffs have demonstrated a sufficient likelihood of \nsuccess to warrant an limited temporary restraining order under the totality of the \ncircumstances and the governing law. Specifically, the affidavits from counsel \nshow deficiencies in notice and transition assistance. Whether that evidentiary \nshowing prevails on a fuller record is not now necessary to decide. Accordingly, \n2 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 19   Filed 07/03/18   Page 3 of 4\nthe Court (1) ENJOINS the Defendants and their agents from terminating the \nTemporary Housing Assistance program which provides the payment for shelter \nfor the plaintiffs (including the class) until at least midnight July 3, 2018 (i.e. \nenabling Plaintiffs and the class to stay until checkout time on July 4, 2018); (2) \nORDERS Defendants and their agents to provide notice and take whatever action \nis necessary to extend the assistance until the aforementioned deadline; and (3) \nSCHEDULES a telephone hearing on this matter before Judge Hillman on \nMonday July 2, 2018 at 12:45 p.m. This ruling is WITHOUT PREJUDICE to any \nrulings by Judge Hillman. At the hearing before Judge Hillman counsel for \nplaintiffs ought be prepared to address with more specificity, inter alia, the \nspecific nature and basis for the right to notice, the nature and basis of the right to \nongoing housing assistance, the nature and basis for the right to transition \nassistance, and the legal significance, if any, of the different durations of housing \nassistance programs. Counsel for the government ought be prepared to address, \ninter alia, (on Monday or such further time as requested by the government) the \nlack of basis for the foregoing issues. Nothing in this outline limits or precludes \nthe parties from raising issues fairly within the pleadings or appropriate defenses \n… . \n \nSee Docket Entry No. 10. \n  The Court held a further hearing on Plaintiffs’ motion on July 2, 2018.  At that hearing, \nthe parties informed the Court that the Defendants had agreed to continue the TSA program for \nthe Plaintiffs through July 5, 2018, after which time Plaintiffs’ and other evacuees’ benefits \nwould terminate in accordance with the Defendants’ prior termination notice.   \nDiscussion \n  At the hearing, Plaintiffs requested that the Court extend the TRO for thirty (30) days to \npermit the Defendants to file a response to their motion and for the Court to hold an evidentiary \nhearing, with testimony from the Plaintiffs and the Defendants or their representatives.  The \nDefendants, on the other hand, summarized the statutory genesis of the TSA program and how \nthe program had been applied to the Plaintiffs.  The Defendants argued, essentially, that the \nPlaintiffs have not established a likelihood of success on the merits, first, because the Governor \nof Puerto Rico had agreed to the termination of the program, and second, because the Plaintiffs \n3 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-40111-TSH   Document 19   Filed 07/03/18   Page 4 of 4\ncannot establish that they have a property right to continued benefits (and therefore, cannot \nestablish the violation of a constitutional right).  \n  Having reviewed the cases cited by the parties and considered their arguments, I find that \nfurther briefing on the issues would be helpful to the Court. The parties should address the \nstatutory scheme in greater detail. In connection therewith, I would like the parties to address the \nimplication of the refusal of the Governor of Puerto Rico to request an extension of the TSA \nprogram benefits.    \n  The Defendants shall file their opposition by July 13, 2018 and the Plaintiffs a reply thereto \nby July 18, 2018. After reviewing the parties’ submissions, I will determine whether a further \nhearing is necessary.  I expect to issue my Order by July 23, 2018. Accordingly, the TRO entered \nby Judge Sorokin shall remain in place until least midnight July 23, 2018 (i.e., enabling Plaintiffs \nand the class to stay until checkout time on July 24, 2018).  \nSo Ordered: \n \n  Dated: July 3, 2018 9:25 a.m.       /s/ Timothy S. Hillman \n                TIMOTHY S. HILLMAN   \n                DISTRICT JUDGE \n \n4 \n ",
