    "summary": "<p>This case is a response to the Attorney General's decision in <i>Matter of A-B-</i>, issued in June 2018, and updated guidelines for asylum officers the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a month later, instructing them to apply <i>Matter of A-B-'s</i> holding to credible fear screenings. </p><p>On August 7, 2018, this suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by asylum applicants plaintiffs all ordered removed following the rejection of their asylum claims at the credible fear assessment stage. They alleged that the Attorney General's decision in <i>Matter of A-B-</i> articulated new, unlawful standards for adjudicating asylum claims relating to domestic and gang violence. The defendants were the Attorney General, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR). The plaintiffs filed these claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and the Refugee Act of 1980. Represented by the ACLU and the Center for Gender & Refugee Studies, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorneys' fees and costs. They claimed that the defendants unlawfully implemented this new screening standard for asylum seekers in expedited removal proceedings, effectively depriving all applicants of their right to pursue asylum. The case was assigned to Judge Emmet Sullivan. </p><p>The plaintiffs claimed that as a result of these new policies most credible fear claims connected to domestic or gang violence were categorically denied; applicants were required to show that their home government \"condones or is completely helpless\" to protect them from feared persecution (as opposed to the prior \"unable or unwilling\" standard). This placed a higher burden on individuals seeking asylum based on membership in a particular social group. Moreover, asylum adjudicators were instructed to ignore any federal court of appeals decisions that conflicted with these new credible fear policies. </p><p>On August 8, 2018, the plaintiffs filed for a preliminary injunction and an emergency motion for stay of removal because two of the plaintiffs were subject to imminent removal. At an emergency hearing on August 8, the defendants agreed that the two plaintiffs would not be removed prior to 11:59 pm on August 9. However, following a hearing on the motions on the morning of August 9, the court learned that the two plaintiffs had in fact been removed from detention and placed on a flight to El Salvador during the hearing. The Court issued an oral order requiring the defendants to return the two plaintiffs to the U.S. as soon as possible.</p><p>On August 9, 2018, the court also granted a temporary stay of removal for all the plaintiffs pending the Court's determination of whether it had jurisdiction to enter a stay of removal in the case. 2018 WL 3812445.</p><p>On September 12 the defendants filed for summary judgment, claiming that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs' claims, and furthermore, that all of the plaintiffs' claims failed as a matter of law. The plaintiffs filed a cross motion for summary judgment on September 26, alleging that their claims were justiciable and that they were entitled to summary judgment on the merits.</p><p>Four parties filed amicus briefs in support of the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on October 2 and 3, 2018. The amici were filed by Tahrih Justice Center; a group of 10 law professors specializing in administrative law; the attorneys general of California, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington; and the United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees.</p><p>The District Court heard arguments on the cross motions on November 19, 2018. Judge Sullivan partially granted and partially denied the motions for summary judgment in a December 19, 2018 opinion. He found several parts of the DHS's policies and rules based off of <i>Matter of A-B-</i> to be in violation of the APA's arbitrary and capricious standard: <blockquote>the general rule against credible fear claims relating to domestic and gang violence . . . the requirement that a noncitizen whose credible fear claim involves non-governmental persecutors “show the government condoned the private actions or at least demonstrated a complete helplessness to protect the victim” . . . the Policy Memorandum’s rule that domestic violence based particular social group definitions that include “inability to leave” a relationship are impermissibly circular. . . the Policy Memorandum’s requirement that, during the credible fear stage, individuals claiming credible fear must delineate or identify any particular social group in order to satisfy credible fear based on the particular social group protected ground. . . the Policy Memorandum’s directive that asylum officers conducting credible fear interviews should apply federal circuit court case law only “to the extent that those cases are not inconsistent with Matter of A-B-”. . . [and] the Policy Memorandum’s directive that asylum officers conducting credible fear interviews should apply only the case law of “the circuit where the alien is physically located during the credible fear interview.”</blockquote> He vacated all of these policies and permanently enjoined the defendants from using them going forward. In addition, he ordered the defendants to bring back any plaintiffs who had been removed from the United States under the now-enjoined policies and to give them a new credible fear evaluation. He granted the defendant's summary judgment motion with respect to due process and nexus and discretion claims. 344 F.Supp.3d 96.</p><p>The defendants appealed the summary judgment decision to the D.C. Court of Appeals on January 17, 2019. They also filed a motion to stay district court proceedings, but Judge Sullivan denied the motion on January 25; this left the injunction in place and forced the defendants to continue reporting on compliance with the injunction during the appeal. 2019 WL 329572. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and the state attorneys general from the district court amicus briefs, among others, filed amici for the appeal as well.</p><p>On July 17, 2020, the D.C. Circuit issued their opinion and ruled primarily in favor of the plaintiffs. It reversed the district court’s grant of summary judgment with respect to the “circularity rule,” which governs how immigration officials analyze asylum claims premised on an applicant's membership in a particular social group, and the rule regarding domestic- and gang-violence claims. As such, it vacated the injunction as it pertained to those issues. But the appellate court affirmed the judgment and the injunction otherwise; and remanded the case back to the district court. 965 F.3d 883. </p><p>The case is ongoing. </p>",

The States recognize the important contribution these \nimmigrants have made to society, and believe that immigrants are vital to their economic success.   \nAs home to the majority of this country’s successful asylum grantees, the Amici States are \nconcerned about the impact of Attorney General Sessions’s recent precedential opinion in Matter of \nA-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316 (A.G. 2018).  The decision, which generally calls for the denial of asylum \nclaims related to domestic and gang-related violence, contravenes existing precedent from both the \nfederal courts of appeals and the Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”).  Federal law requires that \nall asylum claims be adjudicated on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a \nbar violates that principle.  Consequently, the Amici States fear that those fleeing from domestic and \ngang-related violence will not receive a fair opportunity to establish their individual eligibility for \nasylum, to which they are entitled under federal law.  As a result, worthy applicants will be turned \naway, and the Amici States will suffer both economically and culturally.  \nBACKGROUND \nFederal law provides that “[a]ny alien who is physically present in the United States or who \narrives in the United States . . . irrespective of such alien’s status, may apply for asylum.”  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1158(a)(1).  To qualify for asylum, the individual must establish that she is a refugee, id. \n§ 1158(b)(1)(A), meaning that she is “unable or unwilling to return” to her home country “because \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 82   Filed 10/02/18   Page 7 of 22\n \nof a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a \nparticular social group, or political opinion.”  Id.  § 1101(a)(42)(A).  The applicant need not establish \na fear of certain persecution; rather, she must simply show fear of a one-in-ten chance of persecution \non account of a protected ground.  See INS v. Cardoza-Fonesca, 480 U.S. 421, 440 (1987).   \n Additionally, asylum law imposes no requirement of direct governmental persecution.  See 8 \nU.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); Knezevic v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 1206, 1211 (9th Cir. 2004).  An asylum \napplicant who is persecuted by non-state actors may still merit asylum if she establishes that the \npersecution was “committed by . . . forces the government is either unable or unwilling to control.”  \nKnezevic, 367 F.3d at 1211; 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A).  In this vein, the federal courts of appeals \nand the BIA have routinely granted asylum to victims of private criminal activity.  See, e.g., \nHernandez-Avalos v. Lynch, 784 F.3d 944, 951 (4th Cir. 2015) (granting asylum to a woman and son \nwho were violently threatened by gang members); see also Matter of Kasinga, 21 I&N Dec. 357, \n366-67 (BIA 1996) (granting asylum to a woman who feared her family would subject her to female \ngenital mutilation).  \nAsylum applicants fleeing from domestic and gang-related violence often claim a well-\nfounded fear of persecution on account of their “membership in a particular social group.”  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1101(a)(42)(A).  Federal courts of appeals have recognized that applicants with these types of \nclaims qualify for asylum.  See Aguilar-Escoto v. Sessions, 874 F.3d 334, 337 (1st Cir. 2017) \n(remanding where BIA failed to consider evidence of domestic abuse); Martinez v. Holder, 740 F.3d \n902, 909-13 (4th Cir. 2014) (finding former gang membership to constitute a particular social \ngroup); Cece v. Holder, 733 F.3d 662, 672 (7th Cir. 2013) (determining “young Albanian women \nliving alone” constituted a particular social group); Henriquez-Rivas v. Holder, 707 F.3d 1081, 1091-\n94 (9th Cir. 2013) (en banc) (recognizing that individuals who publicly testify against gangs may \n  2\n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 82   Filed 10/02/18   Page 8 of 22\n \nqualify as a particular social group); Fiadjoe v. Attorney Gen. of U.S., 411 F.3d 135, 160-62 (3d Cir. \n2005) (disagreeing with the BIA’s determination that a victim of incest and domestic violence did \nnot qualify for asylum).  Notably, in a 2014 decision, Matter of A-R-C-G, 26 I&N Dec. 388 (BIA \n2014), the BIA explicitly acknowledged that victims of domestic violence could qualify for asylum.  \nId. at 389 (holding that “married women in Guatemala who are unable to leave their relationship” \nwas a particular social group, and granting the applicant asylum).  \nDespite widespread recognition of the validity of domestic violence and gang-related asylum \nclaims, on June 11, 2018, Attorney General Sessions issued Matter of A-B-, a precedential opinion \nthat reversed the BIA’s grant of asylum to an El Salvadoran woman who was brutalized by her \nhusband.  27 I&N Dec. at 321, 346.  The opinion overruled the BIA’s decision in Matter of A-R-C-\nG- and stated that “[g]enerally, claims by aliens pertaining to domestic violence or gang violence \nperpetrated by non-governmental actors will not qualify for asylum.”  Id. at 320.  Additionally, the \ndecision heightened the standard that asylum applicants must meet when claiming persecution by a \nnon-governmental actor.  Id. at 337.  Rather than requiring a showing that the government is “unable \nor unwilling” to control the private persecutor, as dictated by statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A), \nMatter of A-B- now requires that the applicant show that the  “government condoned the private \nactions or at least demonstrated a complete helplessness to protect the victims,” 27 I&N Dec. at 337 \n(internal quotation marks omitted). \nOn July 11, following the publication of Matter of A-B-, the United States Citizenship and \nImmigration Services (“USCIS”) issued a policy memorandum entitled “Guidance for Processing \nReasonable Fear, Credible Fear, Asylum, and Refugee Claims in Accordance with Matter of A-B-” \n  3\n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 82   Filed 10/02/18   Page 9 of 22\n \n(“Policy Memorandum”).1  The policy memorandum, which serves as guidance to all asylum \nofficers, reiterated (in bold font) the categorical rejection of asylum claims based on domestic and \ngang violence.  It also directed asylum officers to apply the case law only of the circuit in which the \nimmigrant is actually detained, and only “to the extent that those cases are not inconsistent with \nMatter of A-B-.”  Policy Mem. 8.   \nCoupled together, Matter of A-B- and the policy memorandum repudiated well-recognized \nasylum protections for individuals fleeing from domestic and gang-related violence.  These effects \nare especially detrimental to those asylum seekers facing expedited removal, who do not have access \nto the full panoply of procedural protections.  See generally 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii).  To \nprotect those individuals in expedited removal who express “a fear of persecution,” Congress \nguaranteed  the  right  to  a  credible  fear  interview  conducted  by  an  asylum  officer.    Id. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(a)(ii).  By design, these interviews have a low threshold of proof.  Applicants must only \ndemonstrate “a significant possibility” of establishing eligibility for asylum.  Id. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v).  \nIn fact, according to the latest available data, in 2016, 75 percent of individuals referred to a credible \nfear interview met that standard.2  However, Matter of A-B- and the policy memorandum cut against \nthese established protections.    \n                                           \n1   Available at https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Laws/Memoranda/ 2018/2018- \n06-18-PM-602-0162-USCIS-Memorandum-Matter-of-A-B.pdf. \n2   Nadwa  Mossaad  &  Ryan  Baugh,  Refugees  and  Asylees:  2016  at  6  (2018), \nhttps://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Refugees_Asylees_2016.pdf. \n  4\n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 82   Filed 10/02/18   Page 10 of 22\n \nARGUMENT \nI.  Matter of A-B- And The Subsequent USCIS Guidelines Contravene The Amici States’ \nInterest In Welcoming Immigrants, Including Individuals Seeking Asylum Related To \nDomestic Violence and Gang-Related Crime. \nA.  Immigrants bolster States’ economies and support innovation. \nThe United States was founded on the principle of immigration. When the country became a \nsignatory to the 1967 United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, it vowed to protect \nindividuals escaping persecution.3  The benefits associated with immigration are reciprocal; not only \ndo immigrants benefit from the opportunities associated with living in the United States, but the \nStates and country as a whole benefit from immigrants.   \nImmigrants contribute greatly to the nation’s prosperity by contributing to the state and \nnational economies.  Nationally, one in six workers is an immigrant.4  Immigrants supply necessary \nlabor in a variety of fields such as healthcare, manufacturing, food services, and agriculture,5 often \ntaking jobs that native-born citizens either do not want or cannot fill.6  For example, in the Great \nLakes region of Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York,7 population \n                                           \n3   Id. at 2.  \n4   Am.

Nationally, successful asylum grantees have a median age \nmuch lower than citizens.13  The majority of asylum-seekers are of working age, and thus contribute \nto the earning potential of states and the country as a whole.14 \nAdditionally,  immigrants  pursue  entrepreneurship  at  disproportionately  high  levels.  \nAlthough nationally immigrants make up around 15 percent of the workforce, approximately 25 \npercent of business owners are immigrants, with even higher percentages in metropolitan areas.15  \nFor example, immigrants make up over half of all business owners in the Washington, D.C.  \n                                           \n8   See id. at 7.  \n9   See id. at 7-8.  \n10   Id. at 8.  \n11   Id. at 3, 17, 32 \n12   Id. at 2, 12.  \n13   See Mossaad, supra n.3, at 8.  \n14   Id.

Victims of domestic and gang-related violence deserve the protection of States \nand the United States. \nA large portion of applicants who seek asylum based on domestic and gang-related violence \ncome from El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, collectively known as the “Northern Triangle.”24  \nThis area is widely regarded as one of the most dangerous regions in the world.25  In the United \nStates, more individuals sought asylum from that region from 2014 to 2016 (the last available data), \n“than in the proceeding 17 years combined.” 26  Nearly 30 percent of all asylum grantees in 2016 \ncame from the Northern Triangle,27 illustrating both the viability of such asylum claims, see \nHernandez-Avalos v. Lynch, 784 F.3d at 951, and the necessity to aid individuals fleeing from such \nharm.   \nViolence and crime in the region is widespread.  Because of this, the Northern Triangle has \nbeen likened to “the deadliest war zones around the world.”28  Consistently, El Salvador, Honduras, \nand Guatemala rank among the top ten countries with the highest homicide rates in the world.29  In \n                                           \n24  See Katie Benner & Caitlin Dickerson, Sessions Says Domestic and Gang Violence Are Not \nGrounds  for  Asylum,  N.Y.

El Salvador and Honduras \nhold the first- and second-highest rates of femicide in the world, respectively.32  In 2017, more than \nnine women were killed each week in El Salvador.33  Women are seen as targets for gangs. 34  As \none victim reported, “it’s never just sex with the one [gang member], it’s forced sex with all of \nthem.” 35  To make matters worse, not only do these women face gang-related violence, but they also \nsuffer from violence at home.  Studies show that “[d]omestic violence in the [Northern Triangle] is \ncommonplace and is rarely discussed openly.”36 \nReports from the State Department, which courts have recognized as “the most appropriate \nand perhaps the best resource[] for information on . . . foreign nations,” Sowe v. Mukasey, 538 F.3d \n1281, 1285 (9th Cir. 2008), show widespread human rights violations associated with domestic and \ngang-related violence.

To be sure, the Amici States do not contend that all \napplicants  who  claim  asylum  based  on  domestic  violence  and  gang-related  activity  should \nautomatically succeed on their claims.  But in cases of non-governmental persecution, establishing \nstatus as a refugee requires a showing that the government is unable or unwilling to control the \nprivate criminal actor.  See Afriyie v.

Matter of A-B- wrongfully denies asylum \napplicants the opportunity to establish that their government is unable or unwilling to control their \nprivate attackers.  \nC.   Matter of A-B- is inconsistent with state, federal, and international policies \nintended to protect women from gender-based harm.        \nIn issuing Matter of A-B-, the government has stripped away an essential lifeline for victims \nof gender-based harm.  Although both men and women can suffer from gender-based harm, such as \ndomestic violence, it is women and their children who predominantly suffer.43  State, federal, and \ninternational policies have recognized the importance of protecting women from harm, yet Matter of \nA-B- disregards this consensus.   \nWithout a doubt, states throughout the country recognize that domestic violence not only has \na social impact, but also an economic impact as well.

The law imposes heightened penalties for repeat domestic abuse offenders, \nby creating the crime of “aggravated family offense.”53  Indeed, nationally, prosecution and \nconviction rate of state domestic abuse cases is significantly higher than that of non-domestic abuse \ncases.54   \nThe federal government has also taken significant steps to protect women from domestic \nviolence.  In 1994, Congress enacted the comprehensive Violence Against Women Act (“VAWA”) \nof 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-322, 108 Stat. 1902 (1994), with the goal of ensuring that “all persons \nwithin the United States shall have the right to be free from crimes of violence motivated by \ngender,” United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598, 605 (2000).  VAWA not only included protection \nfor U.S. citizens facing domestic violence, but it also aided immigrant women facing the same \nissues.  The Act introduced new immigration law procedures which allowed immigrant women who \n“ha[ve] been battered or ha[ve] been the subject of extreme cruelty perpetrated by” a spouse or \nfiancé to self-petition for a visa.  8 U.S.C. § 1154(a)(1)(A)(iii)(bb).   \nIn 2000, Congress heightened protections for immigrant women who were victims of sex \ntrafficking and domestic abuse.  See Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, \n                                           \n52   D.C. Code § 51-131. \n53   N.Y.

L. No. 106-386, 114 Stat. 1464 (2000).   It created two new categories of visas for those \nseeking admission to the United States— “T” visas for victims of sex trafficking, id. div. A § 107, \n114 Stat. 1464, 1474-80 (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(T)), and “U” visas for victims of other \nserious crimes, like domestic abuse, who testify against their attackers, id. div. B § 1513, 114 Stat. at \n1533-37 (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(U)).  With the passage of this Act, Congress recognized \nthe importance of “providing battered immigrant women and children who [are] experiencing \ndomestic violence at home with protection against deportation.”  Id. §1502(a)(2), 114 Stat. at 1518.  \nIndeed, in discussing the need for T and U visas, members of Congress noted that the visas would \nprovide protection for domestic violence victims in the United States,55 who if coming to this \ncountry alone, could seek and qualify for asylum on account of the abuse, but may have difficulty \ndoing so when their abuser is also within the United States. 56  Yet, Matter of A-B-, which was issued \nsolely by the Attorney General, closes this avenue of protection and contravenes States’ and \nCongress’s desire to aid immigrant women who are victims of domestic abuse. \nMoreover, a policy that categorically rejects asylum claims from victims of domestic and \ngender-based abuse is contrary to the guidelines set forth by the United Nations High Commissioner \n                                           \n55   See U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Servs., Victims of Human Trafficking: T Nonimmigrant \nStatus, https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/victims-human-trafficking-other-crimes/victims-human-\ntrafficking-t-nonimmigrant-status (last visited Sept. 24, 2018) (stating that only those who are “in the \nUnited States, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or at a port of \nentry due to trafficking” are eligible for T visas); see also U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Servs., \nVictims of Criminal Activity: U Nonimmigrant Status, https://www.uscis.gov/ humanitarian/victims-\nhuman-trafficking-other-crimes/victims-criminal-activity-u-nonimmigrant-status/victims-criminal-\nactivity-u-nonimmigrant-status (last visited Sept. 24, 2018) (considering that “[t]he crime occurred \nin the United Sates or violated U.S. law” to be a requirement for a U visas). \n56   Battered Immigrant Protection Act of 1999: Hearing on H.R. 3083 Before the H.

The Supreme Court and, consequently, federal appellate courts, consider \nUNHCR guidance authoritative, particularly the guidance found in its often-cited Handbook and \nGuidelines  on  Procedures  and  Criteria  for  Determining  Refugee  Status  (Geneva  2011  ed.) \n(“Handbook”).57   See INS v. Cardoza-Fonesca, 480 U.S. 421, 439 (1987) (relying on the \nHandbook’s analysis for the interpretation of the definition of “refugee”); see, e.g., Rodriguez-\nRoman v. INS, 98 F.3d 416, 425 (9th Cir. 1996) (“[The court] is also bound . . . to consider the \nprinciples established by the Handbook.”).  The Handbook notes that women who suffer from \ngender-related persecution, such as “sexual violence, family/domestic violence, coerced family \nplanning, [and] female genital mutilation” may qualify as refugees.58  That remains the case when \nthere is “a risk of being persecuted at the hands of a non-State actor” such as a “husband [or] \npartner.”59    Matter of A-B- blatantly ignored the Handbook’s reasoning, which this Court must take \ninto account.  See Cardoza-Fonesca, 480 U.S. at 439 n. 22.  \nWhat is more, in recent years, UNHCR has recognized the heightened domestic abuse crisis, \nreiterating that it “takes the position that women who suffer serious domestic harm can qualify for \nrefugee protection.”60  At a time when the UNHCR is declaring “a clear need for international \nprotection” for women who are unsafe from gender-based violence in their home countries,61 the \nUnited States is turning these same women away.  This Court should reject Matter of A-B-’s refusal \n                                           \n57   Available  at  http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/publications/legal/3d58e13b4/handbook-\nprocedures-criteria-determining-refugee-status-under-1951-convention.pdf. \n58   Handbook at 80.   \n59   Id. at 84. \n60   See Women on the Run, supra n.34, at 36.  \n61   Id. at 44. \n  15\n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 82   Filed 10/02/18   Page 21 of 22\n \nto allow victims of domestic violence to seek asylum, which is contrary to the UNHCR’s guidelines \nand to well-established federal and state policies.  \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, the Amici States urge this Court to rule in the Plaintiffs’ favor. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nKARL A.

This case seeks to prevent the evisceration of asylum protections for the most vulnerable \nimmigrants fleeing horrific persecution.  Plaintiffs are adults and children who fled their home \ncountries after suffering pervasive sexual abuse, kidnapping, beatings, shootings, the murder of \nfamily members, and/or death threats. They are challenging new policies that unlawfully deprive \nthem of their right to seek humanitarian protection. \n2.  Specifically, the Defendants have recently implemented written policies that subject \nPlaintiffs and other individuals placed into summary \"expedited removal\" proceedings ·to an \nunlawful screening standard-a standard intended to eliminate most domestic violence and gang \nrelated asylum claims. The new expedited removal policies stem from a legal opinion issued on \nJune II, 2018, Matter ofA -B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316 (A.G. 2018), which articulated new, erroneous \nstandards for adjudicating asylum claims relating to domestic and gang-related violence, and \nsubsequent guidance applying these erroneous standards to expedited removal screenings. \n3.  As a result of the new policies, the immigration authorities summarily rejected Plaintiffs' \nasylum claims and ordered them removed to countries where they face grave danger or even \ndeath.  Unless the new policies are enjoined, many other bona fide asylum seekers face the same \nfate. \n4.  When Congress created \"expedited removal\" proceedings in I 996, it was careful to build \nin protections for asylum seekers. These protections require that every individual who comes to \nthis country seeking humanitarian protection be given a fair chance to establish eligibility for \nasylum and related protection from deportation.  Specifically, immigrants in expedited removal \nwho express fear of return to their home countries must be afforded a threshold screening \ninterview with an asylum officer, called a \"credible fear\" interview.  At that interview, the \n3 \n\nquestion is not whether that person will ultimately be eligible for asylum, but only whether there \nis \"a significant possibility ... that the alien could establish eligibility for asylum[.]\" 8 U.S.C. § \n1225(b)(I)(B)(v) (emphasis added).  lfthe noncitizen passes this low \"credible fear\" screening \nstandard, the law requires that she be taken out of expedited removal and allowed to pursue her \nclaim for asylum in regular removal proceedings, where she is entitled to a full trial-type \nimmigration court hearing and administrative appellate review, followed by review in the federal \ncourt ofa ppeals. Congress intended the credible fear standard to be low, so that asylum seekers \nwould be given \"the benefit of the doubt and no one with a potentially meritorious asylum claim \nwould be sent back to danger. \n5.  Prior to Defendants' implementation of the challenged policies, all of the Plaintiffs would \nhave satisfied the threshold credible fear standard and been entitled to seek asylum and related \nprotection in full removal hearings before an immigration judge. \n6.  But the new policies unlawfully elevate the credible fear standard far above the low \nthreshold Congress enacted and prevent asylum seekers from ever pursuing their asylum claims. \nThe new credible fear policies based on Mauer ofA -B-unlawfully change the credible fear \nstandard in at least three ways. \n7.  First, they direct asylum adjudicators to deny most credible fear claims connected to \ndomestic violence or gangs, even though by law, credible fear must be decided on the specific \nfacts of each case and there is no categorical bar against such claims under the asylum laws. \n8.  Second, they instruct asylum adjudicators to evaluate and deny credible fear for such \nclaims based on multiple erroneous legal standards.  For example, although it is well-established \nthat individuals fearing persecution by non-governmental actors can qualify for asylum if they \nshow that their home government is \"unable or unwilling\" to protect them, the new policies \n4 \n\nrequire applicants to meet a much more stringent test: showing that their government \"condones \nor is completely helpless\" to protect them. Similarly, for individuals who assert they are being \ntargeted for persecution because they are a member of a particular social group (one of the five \nprotected grounds for asylum), the new policies impose an erroneous, more demanding burden \nfor showing that the persecution they fear is \"on account of' such membership. \n9.  Finally, they require asylum adjudicators to ignore any federal court of appeals decisions \nthat conflict with the new credible fear policies, thus purporting to make the immigration \nauthorities the ultimate arbiters of the law, and undermining both Congress's lawmaking \nauthority and the Article Ill judiciary's duty to \"say what the Jaw is.\" Marbury v. Madison, 5 \nU.S. 137, 177,2 L. Ed. 60 (1803). \n10. Each of these instructions by themselves unlawfully alters and heightens the credible fear \nstandard and deprive Plaintiffs and other asylum seekers of their right to pursue asylum.  Taken \ntogether, their effect is to distort the credible fear process beyond recognition. \n11. Plaintiffs seek a declaration that the new credible fear policies violate the Immigration \nand Nationality Act (\"INA\"), the Refugee Act, the Administrative Procedure Act, Article Ill's \nseparation-of-powers principle, and the Due Process Clause; an order enjoining the application \nof the new credible fear policies; and an order that Plaintiffs' expedited removal orders be \nvacated and that they be provided with a new credible fear process under the proper legal \nstandard or, in the alternative, full immigration court removal proceedings pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § \n1229a.  Without an injunction, Plaintiffs and thousands of other immigrants like them \ndesperately seeking safety will be unlawfully deported to places where they fear they will be \nraped, kidnapped, beaten, and killed. \n5 \n\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n12. This case arises under the United States Constitution; the Administrative Procedure Act \n(\"APA\"), 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.; the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), 8 U.S.C. § 1101 \net seq. and its implementing regulations; and the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\"), the \nForeign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (\"FARRA\"), Pub. L. No. 105-277, div. \nG, Title XXII, § 2242, 112 Stat. 2681, 2681-822 ( 1998) (codified as Note to 8 U. S.C. § 1231 ). \n13. The Court has jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3).  Section 1252(e)(3) is a provision \nofthe INA that provides jurisdiction in the Uni\"ted States District Court for the District of \nColumbia over systemic challenges \"to [the] validity of the [expedited removal] system,\" \nincluding regulations and \"written\" policies regarding expedited removal.  The Court also has \njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. \n14.  Venue is proper in this District because 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A) requires that all \n§ 1252(e)(3) actions be brought in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. \nIn addition, venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 139l(e)(l) because a substantial part ofthe events \nor omissions giving rise to this action occurred in this District. \nPARTIES \n15. PlaintiffGrace· fled Guatemala to escape her abusive partner and his violent gang \nmember sons.  Grace's partner of22 years repeatedly beat and threatened to kill her and her \nchildren throughout their relationship and after she tried to leave him.  He also sexually assaulted \nher and her daughter over many years.  Grace is part of an indigenous group that is discriminated \nagainst in Guatemala by Ladinos (non-indigenous Guatemalans). Grace's abuser, who is Ladino, \nwould often berate her for being an \"India\" (a slur used to denigrate indigenous people) and \n\"stupid,\" because she could not read or write, especially when he was violently abusing her. \n• Plaintiffs proceeding under a pseudonym are indicated with an asterisk. \n6 \n\nOnce, he beat Grace's pregnant daughter so severely that she had a miscarriage.  In October \n2016, Grace sought police protection from her abuser and his two gang member sons from \nanother relationship, who had recently joined their father in abusing Grace and her children. \nHowever, the police did nothing to stop him and his sons from returning to Grace's house to \nattack her.  When she tried to leave him, Grace's abuser took advantage of her illiteracy to take \nthe legal title to her home.  He then arranged to have the police evict Grace from her longtime \nresidence, and she and her son were forced to move in with a neighbor.  Even after having \nevicted her, Grace's abuser and his ·sons continued to terrorize her and her son.  Because his sons \nare members of a powerful gang, which has a network across the country, Grace does not believe \nshe could find safety in another city. Despite being found to have testified credibly, she received \na negative credible fear detennination on July 20, 2018. Grace is detained at T. Don Hutto \nResidential Center in Taylor, Texas. \n16. Plaintiff Carmen*, together with her young daughter, Plaintiff J .A.C.F., fled her home in \nEl Salvador to escape two decades of horrific sexual abuse by her husband and death threats \nfrom a violent gang. Carmen's husband routinely raped, stalked, and threatened her with death, \ntreating her as his property, even after they were living apart.  Carmen did not report her \nhusband's threats to the police because she had seen that the police did not protect women from \ntheir husbands' abuse.  She had also heard about women who reported abuse to the police, only \nto be killed by their husbands in retaliation, and believed her husband would do the same if she \nreported him. Carmen also fears that she and her daughter would be killed by a violent gang, \nwho targeted her because she was a vulnerable single mother living alone with her child, and \nbecause she had a good factory job. They held her up at gunpoint in May 20 18 when she was on \nher on her way home from work and demanded that she pay a monthly \"tax,\" making clear that \n7 \n\nthey would kill her and her little girl if she did not comply. The gang also threatened to kill her \nif she went to the police.  Because four or five of her co-workers were killed by the same gang in \nthe past year, she knew their threats were serious and fled with J.A.C.F. to avoid death.  In June \n2018, Carmen and her daughter sought asylum in the United States.  Despite being found to have \ntestified credibly, they both received negative credible fear detenninations on June 29, 2018, \nwhich were affirmed by an immigration judge on July 23, 2018.  Carmen and her little girl are \ndetained at the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas. \n17. PlaintiffMina* fled her home in Honduras after suffering a vicious attack and receiving \ndeath threats from a powerful drug trafficking gang that controlled her town.  Members of the \ngang targeted Mina and her family after her husband and father-in-law helped a friend escape \nwhen the gang was trying to kill him.  After murdering her father-in-law and threatening to kill \nher husband, members of the gang beat Mina so badly that she could not walk the next day.  Her \nattackers told her they would rape her and mutilate her body if she did not leave town.  Mina \nknew she could not report the attack to the police because of their close ties to the gang and \nbecause the police had failed to investigate her father-in-law's murder after her family sought \npolice assistance.  Mina and her husband fled to the United States and sought asylum. Despite \nbeing found to have testified credibly, Mina received a negative credible fear detennination on \nJuly 23, 2018.  She is detained at T. Don Hutto Residential Center in Taylor, Texas. \n18. Plaintiff Gina* fled her home in Honduras in June 2018 because she fears death or torture \nat the hands of a powerful Honduran family that threatened to kill her because ofher relationship \nto her nephew, who murdered someone close to them years ago. The family has already \nsucceeded in murdering Gina's brother and maiming her son in an attempt to kill him. Although \nGina made several police reports following these crimes, the police did not help her because the \n8 \n\nfamily targeting her is powerful and well-connected to the Honduran government; the family has \nalso threatened to kill her because she dared to report their crimes. She attempted to find safety \nby moving away from the area, but people sent by the family recently came to her new town, \nasking for her by name. Gina fled to the United States to save her life.  Despite being found to \nhave testified credibly, she received a negative credible fear determination on July 16, 2018. \nGina is detained at T. Don Hutto Residential Center in Taylor, Texas. \n19. Plaintiff Mona* fled her country and sought asylum in the United States after a powerful \ngang brutally murdered her long-term partner, who was a member of a special military force \ndedicated to combating gangs, and threatened to kill her next because of her relationship with \nhim.  Earlier this year, Mona's partner and four other people were gunned down by armed men \nin a hail of bullets.  Mona was present at the shooting and narrowly escaped with her life.  When \nshe called her partner's phone after the shooting to try to locate it, the killers answered, taunting \nher and threatening that they knew she was his partner and she would be next.  Shortly after her \npartner's death, she was accosted by gang members at the market while attempting to purchase \nflowers for his funeral.  They repeated that they knew she was her partner's woman and \nthreatened to kill her.  She was recently alerted by family members that gang members were \nfollowing her bus, forcing her to get off quickly and hide until someone could pick her up.  Mona \nfeared that if she reported the threats to the local police, many of whom collaborate with gangs, \nshe would only put herself in greater danger.  She also knew of other cases where the police were \nnot able to protect family members of police officers and soldiers who were killed by gangs just \nbecause of their relationship with Jaw enforcement.  Fearing for her life, Mona fled to the United \nStates and sought asylum. Despite being found to have testified credibly, she received a negative \n9 \n\ncredible fear detennination on July 20, 2018.  She is detained at T. Don Hutto Residential Center \nin Taylor, Texas. \n20. PlaintiffGio* fled his home in El Salvador after being targeted by members of two rival \ngangs. Gio Jived in a neighborhood controlled by one notoriously brutal gang, whose members \nrecently threatened his life when he refused to sell drugs for them because of his deep Christian \nfaith.  Gio also fears the gang will kill him if it learns that his half-brother is a member oftheir \nrival gang.  If the gang that controls his neighborhood does not kill him, Gio fears that the rival \ngimg will.  Some years ago, Gio was terrorized by members of the rival gang when he visited his \nfather, who lives in their territory.  The rival gang members kidnapped him, accused him of \nbeing a spy for the other gang, broke his arm during a vicious beating, and threatened to throw \nhim in a well and leave him to die. They also threatened to hann him if he made a police report. \nHe escaped, but the gang's members have continued to threaten him for years, any time he has \nencountered them.  In June 2018, after the gang that controls his neighborhood threatened him \nfor refusing to sell drugs, Gio fled to the United States to save himself.  Gio believed that \nattempting to get help from the police would only put him and his family in even graver danger. \nDespite being found to have testified credibly, he received a negative credible fear determination \non July 16, 2018.  Gio is detained at Albany County Correctional Facility in Albany, New York. \n21. Plaintiff Maria*, a recently orphaned teenager, fled her home in El Salvador to escape a \nforced relationship and sexual violence at the hands of a gang member nicknamed \"F.\"  When \nMaria's brother-in-law, a member of the same gang, began to use her recently deceased mother's \nhouse as a gathering place for the gang, Maria stood up to him because her strong Christian faith \nleads her to morally oppose gangs.  After she asked her brother-in-law to leave, F. threatened her \nby screaming at her and beating the walls of her house with a baseball bat, to teach her a Jesson \n10 \n\nabout defying the gang.  He then began to make aggressive sexual advances toward her, telling \nher that she had no choice but to be his \"woman\" and that he would force her if she resisted. He \ncontinued to escalate these advances until he attempted to sexually assault her days before she \nfled.  Maria resisted F. because of her Christian faith and because she saw that gang members \ntreat their girlfriends like property and frequently beat them.  Maria knew this because her \nbrother-in-law abuses her older sister, who has a physical disability and has trouble defending \nherself.  Maria knew the police could not control the gang's violence against women, and she \nhad seen the gang retaliate against people who file police reports.  The gang killed a woman in \nMaria's town in front ofher children just days after she reported that the gang had kidnapped one \nof her sons.  Maria fled to the United States to save her life.  Despite being found to have \ntestified credibly, she received a negative credible fear determination on July 23, 2018.  She is \ndetained at T. Don Hutto Residential Center in Taylor, Texas. \n22. PlaintiffNora• and her three-year-old son, Plaintiff A.B.A., fled their home in El \nSalvador in May 2018, after their lives and safety were threatened by members of a notoriously \nbrutal gang. Over the course of years, Nora suffered rape and physical beatings at the hands of \nher partner, who is the father of her son, A.B.A. Nora's abuser is affiliated with the gang and has \nhad the gang surveil her since she attempted to end their relationship.  Earlier this year, gang \nmembers who gather at a corner near Nora's house began to question her about whether A.B.A. \nwas the son of her abuser.  One of the gang's members named ''E.T.\" began to make aggressive \nsexual advances whenever she passed by.  In May, when Nora was walking home with her three \nyoung children, E.T. pursued her down the street and told her that he knew that she lived alone \nwith her children and that he would come to her house at night to have sex with her.  He showed \nher a gun in his waistband and then looked to her son, indicating that he would kill them both if \n\nshe did not submit to his sexual demands.  She fled to the United States to save her son's life as \nwell as her own.  Despite being found to have testified credibly, Nora and her son both received \nnegative credible fear detenninations on June 15, 2018, which were affinned by an immigration \njudge on June 26, 2018.  USCIS denied their request for reconsideration and Nora and her son \nwere removed to El Salvador on or about July 26, 2018, where they continue to fear for their \nlives. \n23. Plaintiff Cindy Ardon Mejia fled her home in Central America with her young daughter, \nPlaintiff A.P.A., after suffering extensive past persecution, including rape, physical beatings, and \nshootings carried out by  Ms. Ardon Mejia's \nand her little girl entered the United States in June 2018, seeking asylum.  Despite being found to \nhave testified credibly, they both received negative credible fear detenninations on June 28, \n2018, which were affinned by an immigration judge on July I 0, 2018.  USC IS denied their \nrequest for reconsideration on July 25, 2018. \n12 \n\n24. Defendant Jefferson Beauregard Sessions Ill is sued in his official capacity as the \nAttorney General of the United States.  In this capacity, he is responsible for the administration \nofthe immigration laws pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1103, oversees the Executive Office for \nImmigration Review (\"EOIR\") (the administrative immigration court system), and is empowered \nto grant asylum or other relief. \n25. Defendant Kirstjen M. Nielsen is sued in her official capacity as the Secretary ofDHS. \nIn this capacity, she directs each of the component agencies within DHS, including United States \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\"), United States Citizenship and Immigration \nServices (\"USCIS\"), and United States Customs and Border Protection (\"CBP\").  In her official \ncapacity, Defendant Nielsen is responsible for the administration ofthe immigration laws \npursuant to 8 U.S.C. § I 103, and is empowered to grant asylum or other relief. \n26. Defendant Lee Francis Cissna is sued in his official capacity as the Director ofUSCIS, \nwhich is the agency that, through its asylum officers, conducts interviews of certain individuals \nplaced in expedited removal to detennine whether they have a credible fear of persecution and \nshould be permitted to apply for asylum before an immigration judge. \n27. Defendant James McHenry is sued in his official capacity as the Director of the \nExecutive Office for Immigration Review, the agency within the Department of Justice that, \nthrough its immigration judges, conducts limited review of negative credible fear determinations. \n13 \n\nBACKGROUND \nA.  Asylum Protections in the United States \n28. The immigration laws provide that .. [a]ny alien who is physically present in the United \nStates or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port of arrival and \nincluding an alien who is brought to the United States after having been interdicted in \ninternational or United States waters), irrespective of such alien's status, may apply for \nasylum[.]\"  8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(l). \n29. To be eligible for asylum, a noncitizen must establish that she is \"a refugee within the \nmeaning of[8 U.S.C.] section II 0 I (a)(42)(A)[.]\" 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)( I )(A); see also 8 U.S.C. § \n1158(b)(l)(B)(i). A refugee is defined as: \nany person who is outside any country of such person's nationality or, in the case \nof a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last \nhabitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or \nunwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of \npersecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, \nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion[.] \n8 U.S.C. § IIOI(a)(42)(A). \n30. The current asylum system was enacted in 1980, as part of the Refugee Act of 1980, Pub. \nL. 96-212, 94 Stat. I 02, and was intended to bring U.S. Jaw into conformity with our obligations \nunder the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and 1967 United \nNations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees.  Consistent with international law, the \ndefinition of\"refugee\" does not require a showing of cerlain harm.  Instead, individuals can \nestablish eligibility for asylum based on a \"well-founded fear of persecution.\"  The Supreme \nCourt has explained that a showing of a I in I 0 chance of persecution is sufficient to satisfy that \nstandard. See INSv. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421,430,440 (1987). \n14 \n\n31. At the time of the I 980 Act it was well understood in both domestic and international law \nthat persecution included harm inflicted by actors other than the official government of a \ncountry, so long as the government was '·unable or unwilling to control\" the persecutors. Malter \nofA costa, 19 I&N Dec. 211, 222 (BIA 1985). \n32. It is also welt established that refugee protections extend to women fleeing gender-based \npersecution.  For decades, the Board oflmmigration Appeals (\"BIA''), the immigration \nauthorities, and federal courts have broadly recognized that women harmed by non-state actors \nbecause of their gender can show they are persecuted \"on account of' one of the protected \ngrounds of race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social \ngroup. See, e.g., In re Kasinga, 21  I&N Dec. 357, 365 (BIA I 996) (recognizing asylum claim \nbased on female genital cutting by non-governmental actors); Matter ofA costa, 19 I&N Dec. at \n233 (explaining that \"persecution on account of membership in a particular social group\" \n\"mean[s] persecution that is directed toward an individual who is a member of a group of \npersons all of whom share a common, immutable characteristic ... such as sex\"). \nB.  The Expedited Removal System and Credible Fear \n33. Prior to I 996, noncitizens were generally entitled to a full hearing in immigration court \nbefore they could be removed, whether they were seeking admission at the border or had already \nentered the country.  They were also entitled to administrative appellate review before the BIA \nand judicial review in federal court. \n34. In 1996, Congress enacted legislation that created a type of highly truncated removal \nmechanism called ''expedited removal\" that could be used for certain noncitizens seeking \nadmission. See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(l). \n15 \n\n35. Noncitizens subjected to expedited removal are ordered removed by an immigration \nofficer \"without further hearing or review.\"  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(l )(A)(i). \n36. Congress, however, was careful to carve out an exception for individuals who express \nfear of return to their home countries. See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(l )(B); 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(t). \n37. If an individual indicates any fear of returning to his or her home country, the \nimmigration officer must refer the individual for an interview with an asylum officer, called a \n·•credible fear\" interview.  8 U.S.C. §§ 1225(b)(l)(A)(ii), 1225(b)(l)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(4); \nsee also 8 C.F.R. § 208.30.  If the noncitizen is referred to an asylum officer, the officer conducts \n(with the assistance of an interpreter ifnecessary) a rudimentary \"credible fear interview\" which \nis designed \"to elicit all relevant and useful information bearing on whether the applicant has a \ncredible fear of persecution or torture.\"  8 C.F.R. § 208.30(d).  The asylum officer must \"conduct \nthe interview in a non-adversarial manner.\" /d.  Further, in determining whether credible fear is \nsatisfied, the officer must \"consider whether the alien's case presents novel or unique issues that \nmerit consideration in a full hearing before an immigration judge.\" 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(e)(4). \n38. At the conclusion of the interview, if the asylum officer makes a negative credible fear \ndetermination, the officer must provide a written record of the determination that \"shall include . \n. . the officer's analysis of why, in light of[the] facts, the alien has not established a credible \nfear of persecution.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(l)(B)(iii)(II). \n39. Upon the individual's request, the agency must provide for prompt review ofthe asylum \nofficer's negative credible fear determination by an immigration judge. 8 U.S.C. § \n1225(b)(l)(B)(iii)(III); see also 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(g)(l). The immigration judge's decision is \nadministratively \"final and may not be appealed.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1208.30(g)(2)(iv)(A). Noncitizens \nundergoing credible fear review before immigration judges are still in expedited removal \n16 \n\nproceedings, and do not get the full panoply of rights available in regular immigration court \nremoval proceedings. \n40. Noncitizens who receive a negative credible fear determination are issued an expedited \nremoval order, which comes with significant consequences, beyond removal itself.  Noncitizens \nwho are removed pursuant to expedited removal orders are subject to a five-year bar on \nadmission to the United States.  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(A)(i). \n41. To ultimately prevail on an asylum claim, the applicant need only establish that there is a \n10 % chance that he or she will be persecuted on account of one of the five protected grounds for \nasylum. To prevail at a credible fear interview, however, the applicant need only show a \n\"significant possibility\" of asylum eligibility-i.e., a \"significant possibility\" of a 1 in I 0 chance \nof persecution, or afraction of 10%. See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(l)(B)(v) (defining credible fear as \n\"a significant possibility, taking into account the credibility of the statements made by the alien \nin support of the alien's claim and such other facts as are known to the officer, that the alien \ncould establish eligibility for asylum[.]\"). \n42. If a noncitizen is found by the asylum officer to have a \"credible fear,\" the individual is \ntaken out of the expedited removal process and referred for a regular removal hearing before an \nimmigration judge. At that hearing, they will have the opportunity to develop a full record \nbefore the judge, and they may appeal an adverse decision to the BIA and federal court of \nappeals.  8 C.F.R. § 208.30 (t); see also 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(I)(B)(ii). \n43. The reason for the low threshold at the credible fear stage is straightforward. An asylum \nclaim is highly fact-specific and often will take significant time, resources and expertise to \ndevelop, including expert testimony and extensive evidence about country conditions.  It may \nalso involve complex legal questions.  In the expedited removal system, however, abbreviated \n17 \n\ncredible fear proceedings occur within days of arrival, with little to no preparation or assistance \nby counsel, little to no knowledge of asylum law by the applicant, no opportunity to examine \nwitnesses or gather evidence, and while the individual is detained.  It is thus highly unrealistic \nfor applicants in the expedited removal system to present a fully developed asylum claim. \nAccordingly, Congress established a low threshold at the credible fear stage to ensure that \npotentially valid asylum claims could be developed properly in a full trial-type hearing before an \nimmigration judge. Congress viewed this credible fear process as an essential safeguard to \nensure bona fide asylum seekers would not be summarily removed. \nC. The New Written Credible Fear Policies \n44. On June 11, 2018, Defendant Sessions, in his role as Attorney General, issued a \nprecedential decision in an asylum case, Matter ofA -B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316 (A. G. 20 18), reversing \na grant of asylum to a Salvadoran woman who fled more than fifteen years of extreme domestic \nviolence at the hands of her then-husband. Although the BIA had held that Ms. A.B. had \nestablished her eligibility for asylum, Defendant Sessions used an extraordinary procedure by \nwhich he \"certified\" the BIA's decision to himself for review and reversed the BIA's earlier \nprecedent in Matter ofA -R-C-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 338 (BIA 2014). A-R-C-G- had recognized, \nconsistent with the then-longstanding legal position of DHS, that asylum claims based on \ndomestic violence can qualify for protection. \n45. Moreover, Defendant Sessions used Matter ofA -B-as a vehicle to articulate new legal \nstandards for the adjudication of asylum cases based on persecution from non-governmental \nactors on account of membership in a particular social group, focusing particularly on claims by \nindividuals fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.  Malter ofA -8-misstates or \nmischaracterizes multiple aspects of asylum law, seeking to heighten the asylum standards and \n18 \n\nincrease the burden on asylum seekers to prove eligibility.  Defendant Sessions specifically \nopined that, based on the newly articulated standard, few claims pertaining to domestic or gang \nviolence by non-governmental actors would qualify for asylum or satisfy the credible fear \nstandard.  See id. at 320 and n.l. \n46. On June 13, 2018, USC IS issued a written Interim Guidance from John L. Lafferty to \nUSCIS Asylum Division staff, instructing asylum officers to apply Malter ofA -B- to credible \nfear interviews. See Asylum Division Interim Guidance-Matter of A-8-, 271&N Dec. 316 \n(A.G. 20 I 8), June I 3, 2018 (hereinafter \"USC IS Interim Guidance\") (\"'we are issuing the \nfollowing interim guidance on how to proceed with decision-making on asylum cases and CF ... \nscreening determinations\"). \n47. On July I 1, 2018, USC IS issued final written guidance to employees, including asylum \nofficers responsible for conducting credible fear interviews, instructing them, inter alia, to assess \ncredible fear in light of A-B-and directing that claims based on domestic violence and gang-\nrelated banns generally will not establish the basis for a credible fear of persecution.  USCIS \nPolicy Memorandum, Guidance for Processing Reasonable Fear, Credible Fear, Asylum, and \nRefugee Claims in Accordance with Mauer ofA -B-, July I 1, 2018 (PM-602-0162) (hereinafter \n\"USCIS Guidance\" or \"Guidance\"), at 1.1 See also id. (indicating that the ''Authority\" for the \nGuidance includes the expedited removal statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1225, and its implementing \nregulations at 8 C.F.R. §§ 235 and 208). \n1 Although past agency practice has always been to have USC IS Asylum Division \nguidance drafted within that office and approved by the Chief of the Asylum Division, on \ninfonnation and belief, this USCIS Guidance was issued outside those channels, without \napproval from any ofDHS's Asylum Division experts.  Unlike previous guidance of this type, \nthe USCIS Guidance memorandum has no \"FROM\" field, no authors identified, and no \nsignature. \n19 \n\n48. The USCIS Guidance also announces a new credible fear policy not mentioned in Mauer \nofA -B-. Although under prior USCIS policy credible fear applicants could rely on the law of the \nmost favorable federal court of appeals circuit, the Guidance mandates that in making credible \nfear determinations, USCIS asylum officers shall ignore all federal court of appeals case law that \nis inconsistent with A-B-, and even then consider only the law of the circuit where the applicant \nis physically located during her credible fear interview. \n49. On information and belief, the components ofDHS and the Department of Justice \n(including the Executive Office for Immigration Review) involved in adjudicating and enforcing \nthe immigration laws have issued further written documents applying the pronouncements in \nMauer ofA -B-to the credible fear process. \n50. Mauer ofA -B-and the subsequently issued guidance documents establish written policies \nconcerning credible fear interviews and implementing the expedited removal provisions at 8 \nU.S.C. § 1225(b)(l). Taken together, the Matter ofA  -B-decision and the guidance issued by \nUSC IS, EOIR, and other components of DHS and DOJ addressing the applicability of Matter of \nA-B-to credible fear decisions are referred to herein as \"the new credible fear policies.\" The \nnew credible fear policies were first implemented during the last 60 days. \n51. These policies unlawfully change the credible fear standard in multiple interrelated ways, \nto further an explicit goal of foreclosing claims brought by women, children, and other migrants \nfleeing gender and gang-related violence. The new credible fear policies are designed to ensure \nthat those fleeing domestic violence or gang-related violence do not make it into full immigration \nproceedings. The new policies: \n20 \n\n•  instruct asylum officers to deny virtually all credible fear claims based on domestic \nviolence or gang-related harms, in violation of the requirement that each case be \nadjudged based on its specific facts; \n•  ratchet up the showing for failure of government protection that such applicants must \nprove at the credible fear stage to establish eligibility for asylum based on fear of harm by \nnon-governmental actors; \n•  impose a heightened, erroneous standard for proving that persecution is \"on account of'' \n(or has a \"nexus\" to) a protected ground for asylum; \n•  impose an inappropriate burden on credible fear applicants to articulate and provide \nprecise evidence identifying the specific particular social group that forms the basis for \ntheir persecution; \n•  direct asylum officers to exercise \"discretion\" to deny eligible applicants, even though \nthe only question at the threshold credible fear stage is legal eligibility and not discretion; \nand \n•  instruct asylum adjudicators making credible fear determinations to disregard contrary \ncourt of appeals precedents and to apply only the case Jaw in the circuit where the \ncredible fear applicant is detained. \nEach ofthese unlawful changes to the credible fear standard is described further below. \nTile lltstructio11 to De11y Virtually All Credible Fear Claims Based 011 Domestic \nViole11ce a11d Gaug-Related Harm \n52. Even though it is well established that credible fear and asylum claims must be assessed \non a case-by-case basis according to the specific circumstances and evidence presented, and even \nthough there are no categorical bars in the INA based on the type of claim presented, the new \ncredible fear policies instruct asylum adjudicators to reject credible fear claims based on \ndomestic violence or gang-related harms in all but the most extraordinary cases. \n53. In A-B-, the Attorney General asserted that \"[g]enerally, claims by aliens pertaining to \ndomestic violence or gang violence perpetrated by non-governmental actors will not qualify for \nasylum.\"  26 I&N Dec. at 320. Although Ms. A.B.'s case was not at the credible fear stage (and \neven though she did not present an asylum claim based on gang violence), the Attorney General \n21 \n\nadded that \"[a]ccordingly, few such claims would satisfy the legal standard to determine whether \nan alien has a credible fear of persecution. See 8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(l)(B)(v)[.)\" !d. at 320 & n.t \n(quoting the credible fear standard). \n54. Moreover, the USCIS Guidance asserts, in bold font, that \"[i)n general, ••. claims based \non membership in a putative particular social group defined by the members' vulnerability \nto harm of domestic violence or gang violence committed by non-government actors will \nnot establish the basis for ••. a credible ••. fear of persecution.\" USC IS Guidance at 6. \n55. This instruction is incorrect and arbitrary, deprives credible fear applicants of an \nimpartial adjudication of their claims based on the specific facts of their case, violates the \nfundamental principle in the Refugee Act that a single standard should apply to all asylum \nseekers without discrimination, represents an improper departure from prior policy, and reflects \nDefendants' unlawful presumption against entire categories of claims at the credible fear stage. \nTile New \"Comlo11ed\" or \"Complete Helplessness'' Standard for Fail11re of \nGovemment Protection \n56. It is well-settled that for all five protected grounds for asylum (race, religion, nationality, \nmembership in a particular social group, and political opinion), a noncitizen can qualify for \nasylum based on a well-founded fear of persecution by a private actor, where the government is \n\"unable or unwilling\" to protect the applicant.  However, the new credible fear policies mandate \na new, higher standard in such cases. \n57. In A-B-, the Attorney General asserted that victims of persecution by non-governmental \nactors, and specifically those asserting claims based on domestic or gang violence, must now \nestablish that \"the government condoned the private actions 'or at least demonstrated a complete \nhelplessness to protect the victims.\"' 27 I&N Dec. at 337. The USCIS Guidance repeats and \nadopts this instruction in A-B- for all asylum officers, including those making credible fear \n22 \n\ndeterminations. See, e.g., USCIS Guidance at 6 (explaining that the \"unable or unwilling\" \nstandard requires a showing that \"the government condoned the private actions or at least \ndemonstrated a complete helplessness to protect the victim\"); id. at I 0 (\"[T]he home government \nmust either condone the behavior or demonstrate a complete helplessness to protect victims of \nsuch alleged persecution.\"); see also USCIS Interim Guidance (\"the applicant must show that the \ngovernment condoned the behavior or demonstrated a complete helplessness to protect the \nvictim\"). \n58. This new \"condoned\" or \"complete helplessness\" formulation for credible fear interviews \nis inconsistent with the text and context of the Refugee Act and the INA and with Congress's \nintent in the Refugee Act to adopt the settled agency construction of\"well-founded fear of \npersecution\" and conform the refugee definition to international norms.  It is also inconsistent \nwith decades of asylum case law and the government's own longstanding policy, which have \nrecognized the viability of claims involving non-governmental persecutors and have uniformly \nheld that the \"unable or unwilling\" standard is met even where the applicant has not \ndemonstrated that the government condones the harm or is completely helpless to prevent it. \nNe.'\\:IIS a11d Circularly Deji11ed Particular Social Groups \n59.  Mauer ofA -B-concluded that in cases involving non-governmental actors-specifically, \ndomestic violence and gang cases-it will be difficult to establish that the motive for the \npersecution was \"on account of' (or has a \"nexus\" to) the protected ground and not any personal \nrelationship between the applicant and the persecutor. 27 l&N Dec. at 337-39. See also USCIS \nGuidance at 6 (\"[W]hen a private actor inflicts violence based on a personal relationship with the \nvictim, the victim's membership in a larger group often will not be 'one central reason' for the \nabuse.\"). That assertion however, violates the plain text of the INA, which contemplates mixed \n23 \n\nmotives for persecution, as well as the credible fear standard itself.  Asylum applicants have \nsuccessfully established \"nexus\" in a range of circumstances that inherently or predominantly \ninvolve personal relationships, including female genital cutting, honor killings, forced marriages, \nand persecution of homosexuals by family members.  Further, the credible fear policies also set \nforth an unprecedented and unlawful evidentiary requirement, demanding evidence that the \npersecutor was aware of the social group as defined in the asylum claim in order to establish \nnexus. See, e.g., A-B-, 27 l&N Dec. at 339. \n60. The new credible fear policies also establish a presumption that asylum claims founded \non domestic violence present impermissibly circular social groups.  Circularly defined particular \nsocial groups generally do not meet the refugee definition because of a failure of nexus; for \nexample, a domestic abuser generally does not batter his victim because she is a battered woman. \nA-B-erroneously concludes that groups defined in part by the applicant's inability to leave the \nrelationship are impermissibly circular because \"the inability 'to leave' was created by harm or \nby threatened ham1\" (referring to the harm committed by the abuser). 27 I&N Dec. at 335. The \nUSCIS Guidance affirms this position and encourages adjudicators to reject similarly worded \nsocial groups.  USCIS Guidance at 5 (\"The applicant must show something more than the danger \nof harm from an abuser ifthe applicant tried to leave, because that would amount to circularly \ndefining the particular social group by the harm on which the asylum claim was based.\").  Yet \nthe inability of a woman to leave her relationship may be caused by many factors apart from the \nfact of harm, including her abuser's beliefs or social and cultural norms that subordinate women \nto men. The credible fear policies are unlawful, represent an improper departure from prior \npolicy, and rely on impermissible generalizations about domestic violence asylum claims, their \nsocietal context, and the motives of domestic violence perpetrators that have no basis in fact. \n24 \n\n\"Exact Delineation\" of Particular Social Group \n61. Mauer ofA -B-asserted that \"an applicant seeking asylum or withholding of removal \nbased on membership in a particular social group must clearly indicate, on the record and before \nthe immigration judge, the exact delineation ofany proposed particular social group.\" Jd. at 344. \nSee also USCIS Guidance at 3 (\"an applicant seeking asylum or refugee status based on \nmembership in a particular social group must present facts that clearly identify the proposed \nparticular social group\"). The new credible fear policies thus provide that noncitizens must \nspecify the \"particular social group\" that they are claiming. \n62. That requirement cannot be imposed at the credible fear screening stage. Congress \nintended the credible fear standard to be a low, threshold standard that would not screen out any \npotentially valid asylum claims or require development of legally or factually complicated issues \nin such a truncated, \"nonadversarial\" process. See 8 C.F.R. § 208.30.  Yet defining and \nestablishing membership in a \"particular social group\" is one of the most complex and difficult \nquestions in asylum law, one frequently requiring expert testimony and extensive documentary \nevidence.  See, e.g., 65 Fed. Reg. 76588-0 I, Proposed Rule, Immigration and Naturalization \nService, Asylum and Withholding Definitions (Dec. 7, 2000} (\"Membership in a particular social \ngroup is perhaps the most complex and difficult to understand\" of the five protected grounds for \nasylum).  Such a requirement is fundamentally inconsistent with the credible fear scheme that \nCongress enacted. \nAdverse Discretion at tile Credible Fear Stage \n63. Matter ofA -B-also made a point of\"remind[ing] all asylum adjudicators that a favorable \nexercise of discretion is a discrete requirement for the granting of asylum and should not be \npresumed or glossed over solely because an applicant otherwise meets the burden ofprooffor \n25 \n\nasylum eligibility under the INA.\" 27 I&N Dec. at 345 n.12 (emphasis added).  Likewise, the \nUSC IS Guidance addresses the exercise of discretion, explaining under the heading of\"USCIS \nOfficers' General Duties\" that \"if eligibility is established, the USCIS officer must then consider \nwhether or not to exercise discretion to grant the application.\"  USC IS Guidance at 2.  It then \nrepeats Mauer ofA  -B-' s discussion of the exercise of discretion, emphasizing the use of unlawful \nentry into the United States as a negative factor.  /d. at 7-8. \n64. Yet that requirement cannot be imposed at the credible fear stage, where discretion is \nsimply irrelevant. Credible fear is defined as \"a significant possibility ... the alien can establish \neligibility for asylum\" or other similar protection.  8 C.F.R. § 208.30 (emphasis added). \nDisregardi11g Co11trary Court ofA ppeals Ruli11gs \n65. The new credible fear policies assert a categorical rule that asylum officers should \"apply \nthe case law of the relevant federal circuit court\" only \"to the extent that those cases are not \ninconsistent with Matter ofA  -B-.\" USC IS Guidance at 8-9. \n66. This new policy thus asserts that for every statement contained in Matter ofA -B-, the \nAttorney General's opinion is controlling regardless, and credible fear adjudicators will not \nfollow any contrary court of appeals decisions. \n67. Under our Constitutional scheme, however, it is the Judiciary's authority to interpret the \nJaw, and the federal agencies cannot categorically disregard federal court rulings. \n68. Moreover, because credible fear is a low screening threshold, designed to allow all \nmeritorious cases to reach the asylum application stage, applicants should prevail if any circuit is \nlikely to recognize the validity of her claim. \n69. The new credible fear policies also seek to eliminate asylum seekers' ability to rely on \nfederal circuit law by providing that the \"relevant federal circuit court\" from which to apply \n26 \n\ndecisions-to the extent the guidance permits such reliance at all- ''is the circuit where the \nremoval proceedings will take place if the officer makes a positive credible fear .. . \ndetennination.\"  See, e.g., USCIS Guidance at 8-9. The new credible fear policies then go on to \nassert that \"the asylum officer should faithfully apply precedents of the Board and, if necessary, \nthe circuit where the alien is physically located during the credible fear interview.\" /d. at 9. \n70. This marks a dramatic change in policy.  For example, for years, asylum officers have \nbeen trained that where circuit courts disagree on an issue of law, \"generally the interpretation \nmost favorable to the applicant is used when determining whether the applicant meets the \ncredible fear standard.\" See, e.g., Refugee, Asylum, and International Operations Directorate \nOfficer Training Asylum Officer Training Course (\"RAIO Training Course\"), Credible Fear of \nPersecution and Torture Detenninations (Feb. 13, 20 17), at 17; RAIO Training Course, Credible \nFear of Persecution and Torture Determinations (Feb. 28, 2014), at 16 (same); RAIO Training \nCourse, Credible Fear of Persecution and Torture Detenninations (Apr. 14, 2006), at 14 (same). \nThis means that the relevant circuit law to apply is the most favorable circuit on that issue for the \nasylum seeker. The credible fear policies offer no adequate explanation for this change. \n71. The prior policy of giving applicants the benefit of the most favorable circuit Jaw is in \nkeeping with the credible fear standard.  If an applicant will prevail under a particular circuit's \ncaselaw, then by necessity there is a significant possibility that she will prevail. The new \npolicies, by contrast, violate the credible fear standard. \n72. The new credible fear policies contain numerous other legal errors affecting the credible \nfear process. \n27 \n\n73. Taken together, these changes impermissibly distort the credible fear process and \nundermine Congress's intent that the credible fear standard be a low, threshold standard that \nwould not screen out any potentially meritorious claims. \nD.  Defendants Sessions' and Nielsen's Public Statements Regarding Their Goal to \nUndermine Asylum Protections \n74. Rather than comply with our asylum laws, Defendant Sessions and Defendant Nielsen \nhave been open about their desire to weaken asylum protections, particularly for victims of \ndomestic violence and gangs from Central America.  Indeed, Defendant Sessions has repeatedly \nexpressed his hostility towards such claims, and urged a higher credible fear screening standard \nin order to speed the removal of such individuals. The new policies seek to advance these goals. \n75. For example, in October 2017, speaking to the Executive Office for Immigration Review, \nDefendants Sessions expressed his apparent view that the \"particular social group\" ground for \nasylum protection should not be included in the statute.  The Attorney General stated that our \nasylum laws \"are meant to protect those who because of characteristics like their race, religion, \nnationality, or political opinions cannot find protection in their home countries.\"2  He did not \nacknowledge the \"particular social group\" ground.  Instead, he complained that other claims-\nwhich he deemed \"insubstantial,\" \"vague,\" and \"subjective\" -have \"swamped our system.\"3 \nBecause he listed the other four protected grounds as proper asylum claims, his implication was \nthat claims based on a \"particular social group\" are insubstantial. \n76. Defendant Sessions was also explicit about his goal to \"elevate the threshold standard of \nproof in credible fear interviews.'\"' \n2 \nAttorney General Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III, Remarks to the Executive Office \nfor Immigration Review, Falls Church, VA (Oct. 12, 20 17). \n3 !d. \n!d. \n4 \n28 \n\n77. The same day he issued Mauer ofA -B-, he told an audience of immigration judges that \n\"the vast majority of the current asylum claims are not valid.\"5 \n78. Defendant Nielsen has likewise been explicit about her goal of heightening the credible \nfear standard as well, testifying before a January 16, 2018, Senate hearing that \"we must tighten \ncase processing standards, including the •credible-fear' standard[.]\"6 \n79. Thus, the unlawful efforts to heighten the credible fear standard evinced in the credible \nfear policies culminated from Defendants' express desires to change that standard.  But neither \nDefendant Sessions nor Defendant Nielsen have the power to change the credible fear standard, \nwhich can be changed only by Congress. \nE. The New Credible Fear Policies Place Plaintiffs in Grave Danger \n80. Under the correct legal standards, each of the Plaintiffs should have easily passed the \ncredible fear interview and would have been referred for regular removal proceedings to seek \nasylum.  Instead, because of the new credible fear policies, they were each issued a negative \ncredible fear determination. \n8 t. Many other bona fide asylum applicants who meet the credible fear standard similarly \nhave received and will receive negative credible determinations based on the new policies. \n82. Defendants' new policies are depriving Plaintiffs and other asylum seekers of their right \nto pursue potentially meritorious claims for protection.  Indeed, immigration service providers \nacross the country have already reported that the new credible fear policies are causing a \ndramatic increase in the proportion of asylum seekers who receive negative credible fear \ndeterminations. \n5 Attorney General Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III, Remarks to the Executive Office \nfor Immigration Review Legal Training Program, Washington, D.C. (June I I, 2018). \n6 Secretary Kirstjen M. Nielsen, Department of Homeland Security, Testimony at \nHearing Before the Senate Committee on Judiciary {Jan. I6 , 20 I 8). \n29 \n\n83. The result is that individuals have been and will continue to be sent back to countries that \nhave repeatedly been cited for their pervasive and widespread violence against women and \nchildren, including domestic violence, rape, and beatings, and other abuse by gangs.  For \nexample, it has been widely recognized, including by the State Department in 2018, that El \nSalvador has one of the highest homicide rates in the world, and Amnesty International has \ndescribed El Salvador as \"one of the most dangerous countries to be a woman.\" Numerous other \nreports, including by the UNHCR, have documented that gender-motivated killings and other \nmurders of women in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala are commonplace, and that Central \nAmerican gangs perpetrate \"pervasive, pernicious, and often uncontrollable violence and \ndisruption in the region.\"  Human rights reports have also widely documented the systemic \nfailures in state protection in Central American countries. \n84. Indeed, numerous migrants from Central America who were deported from the United \nStates have suffered brutal harms, including death, after returning to their home countries. For \nexample, one study documented that up to 83 individuals deported to Northern Triangle \ncountries between 2014 and 2015 have been killed. \n85. Without judicial intervention, the Defendants wi II be able to effectively rewrite the \nexpedited removal scheme and substantive asylum law to achieve the policy goal of eliminating \nthe ability of Central American refugees to seek safety in the United States. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Refugee Act, Immigration and Nationality Act, Administrative Procedure Act) \n86.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n87. Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3),judicial review is available before the Court regarding \nwhether \"a written policy directive, written policy guideline, or written procedure issued by or \n30 \n\nunder the authority ofthe Attorney General to implement [8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)] is not consistent \nwith applicable provisions of[Subchapter II of the lNA] or is otherwise in violation of law.\" \n88. The Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA· •), 5 U .S.C. § 706, provides that a Court \"shall \nhold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be--(A) arbitrary, \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (B) contrary to \nconstitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity; [or] (C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, \nauthority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.\" \n89. The new credible fear policies relating to Malter ofA -B- violate the lNA and the Refugee \nAct and are arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law under the APA for multiple reasons. \nAmong other reasons, the new policies conflict with the definition of\"refugee,\" see 8 U.S.C. §§ \nI 101(a)(42)(A), 11 58(b)(I)(A); conflict with the credible fear standard at 8 U.S.C. § \n12 25(b)( I )(B)(v); represent a departure from the agency's longstanding policy without an \nacknowledgement of or a reasoned explanation for that departure; are illogical and irrational; and \ndeprive credible fear applicants of a meaningful opportunity to establish their potential eligibility \nfor asylum pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158(b)(l) and 1225(b)(l}(B). \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Separation of Powers, Immigration and Nationality Act, \nAdministrative Procedure Act) \n90. All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n91. The doctrine of separation of powers is embodied in the U.S. Constitution. The \nConstitution establishes the paramount authority of the Judiciary to interpret the law-\"to say \nwhat the law is,\" Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (I Cranch) 137 (1803)-and to render decisions that \nbind the other branches of government in our constitutional system. The Executive Branch-like \nCongress-is bound by the decisions issued by the federal courts.  Respect for the controlling \n31 \n\nauthority ofj udicial opinions and judgments is a fundamental component of the rule of law.  The \nnew credible fear policies violate the separation of powers; violate the INA, including the \ncredible fear standard at 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)( I )(B)(v); and are arbitrary and capricious and \ncontrary to law under the APA. \n92. In addition, the new mandate to ignore contrary circuit court precedent, and to apply only \nthe case law in the circuit where the credible fear applicant is detained, is arbitrary and \ncapricious and contrary to law in violation ofthe APA. \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution) \n93. All ofthe foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n94. Plaintiffs have protected interests in applying for asylum, withholding of removal, and \nConvention Against Torture relief upon a showing that meets the applicable standards, and in not \nbeing removed to a country where they face serious danger and potential loss of life. \n95. Plaintiffs are entitled under the Due Process Clause to a fair hearing of their claims, and a \nmeaningful opportunity to establish their potential eligibility for asylum and related relief from \nremoval. \n96. The new credible fear policies relating to Matter ofA -B-have violated Plaintiffs' right to \ndue process in numerous respects, including by foreclosing their claims regardless of their \nindividual facts or merits; by applying an unlawful, more burdensome legal standard to \nPlaintiffs' claims; and by depriving them of a meaningful opportunity to establish their potential \neligibility for asylum and related relief. \n32 \n\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray this Court to: \na.  Declare the new credible fear policies (including but not limited to Malter ofA -B-, the \nUSCIS Guidance, and all written credible fear guidance issued by DHS and DOJ relating to \nMalter ofA -B-) contrary to law; \nb.  Enter an order vacating the new credible fear policies (including but not limited to Malter \nofA -B-, the USCIS Guidance, and all written credible fear guidance issued by DHS and DOJ \nrelating to Malter ofA -B-); \nc.  Enter an order enjoining Defendants from continuing to apply the new credible fear \npolicies (including but not limited to Matter ofA -B-, the USCIS Guidance, and all written \ncredible fear guidance issued by DHS and DOJ relating to Maller ofA -B-) to credible fear \ndeterminations, interviews, or hearings issued or conducted by asylum officers or immigration \njudges; \nd.  Enter an order staying the expedited removal of each of the Plaintiffs and vacating the \nexpedited removal orders issued to each ofthe Plaintiffs; \ne.  Enter an order enjoining Defendants from removing the Plaintiffs without first providing \neach of them with a new credible fear process under correct legal standards or, in the alternative, \nfull immigration court removal proceedings pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1229a; and, for any Plaintiffs \nwho have been removed pursuant to an expedited removal order prior to the Court's order, to \nparole those Plaintiffs into the United States for the duration of those credible fear and/or \nremoval proceedings; \n33 \n\nf.  Award Plaintiffs' counsel reasonable attorneys' fees under the Equal Access to Justice \nAct, and any other applicable statute or regulation; and \ng.  Grant such further relief as the Court deems just, equitable, and appropriate. \nDated: August 7, 2018  Respectfully submitted, \n~--\nJennifer Chang Newell**  Scott Michel man (D.C.

Statute of \nthe Office of the UNHCR ¶ 1, U.N. Doc. A/RES/428(V) (Dec. 14, 1950).  UNHCR fulfills its \nmandate by “[p]romoting the conclusion and ratification of international conventions for the \nprotection of refugees, supervising their application and proposing amendments thereto.”  Id. \n¶ 8(a).  UNHCR’s supervisory responsibility is reflected in the Preamble and Article 35 of the \nConvention  Relating  to  the  Status  of  Refugees,  July  28,  1951,  189  U.N.T.S.  137  (“1951 \nConvention”)3 and Article 2 of the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, Jan. 31, 1967, 606 \nU.N.T.S. 267 (“1967 Protocol”).4  Those instruments oblige states to cooperate with UNHCR in \nthe exercise of its mandate and to facilitate its supervisory role.  UNHCR’s guidance is relevant to \nthis Court’s interpretation of the 1951 Convention and its 1967 Protocol, as implemented in section \n101(a)(42) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42) (2006).  \nUNHCR, which has won two Nobel Peace Prizes for its work, works in some 130 countries \nat a time when there are 68.5 million people affected by forced displacement worldwide.  UNHCR, \n                                                 \n1 Plaintiffs consent to the filing of the proposed amicus brief.  Defendants consent to the filing of \nthe proposed amicus brief provided that it does not refer to or seek to introduce non-record \nfactual material.  As UNHCR takes no position directly on the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims, the \nbrief does not refer to any factual materials relating to Plaintiffs.  No person or entity other than \nUNHCR and its outside counsel authored this brief or provided any funding related to it.   \n2  This amicus brief does not constitute a waiver, express or implied, of any privilege or \nimmunity which UNHCR and its staff enjoy under applicable international legal instruments and \nrecognized principles of international law.

General Assembly, Convention on the \nPrivileges and Immunities of the United Nations, Feb. 13, 1946, 1 U.N.T.S. 15, \nhttp://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6b3902.html.  \n3 http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html. \n4 http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html. \nvii \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 84   Filed 10/03/18   Page 9 of 36\nGlobal Trends: Forced Displacement in 2017, at 2 (June 25, 2018).5  The views of UNHCR are \ninformed by its more than six decades of experience supervising the treaty-based system of refugee \nprotection.  UNHCR’s interpretation of the 1951 Convention and its 1967 Protocol is both \nauthoritative and integral to promoting consistency in the global regime for the international \nprotection of refugees.  The Supreme Court has consistently turned to UNHCR for assistance in \ninterpreting the United States’ obligations under international refugee instruments.  See, e.g., INS \nv. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 440 n.25 (1987); INS v. Stevic, 467 U.S. 407, 421 (1984).   \nUNHCR exercises its supervisory responsibility by issuing interpretative guidelines on the \nmeaning of the 1951 Convention and its 1967 Protocol and other international refugee instruments, \nincluding the OAU Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa6  \nand the Cartagena Declaration on Refugees.7  The UNHCR Handbook on Procedures and \nCriteria for Determining Refugee Status, U.N. Doc. HCR/1P/4/ENG/REV.3 (1979, re-edited Jan. \n1992; re-issued Dec. 2011) (“Handbook”)8 represents the first such comprehensive guidance.  At \nthe  request  of  States,  including  the  United  States,  the  Handbook  has  subsequently  been \ncomplemented by the UNHCR Guidelines on International Protection and various Guidance \nNotes. \nUNHCR has a specific interest in this matter because the new policies9 diverge from \nUNHCR guidance on the interpretation of (1) the standard to be applied in assessing whether states \n                                                 \n5 http://www.unhcr.org/5b27be547.pdf. \n6 http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6b36018.html. \n7 http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6b36ec.html. \n8 http://www.unhcr.org/3d58e13b4.html. \n9 These new policies are reflected in Matter of A-B-, 27 I.&N. Dec. 316 (A.G. 2018), and \nUSCIS’s July 11, 2018 Guidance, USCIS Policy Memorandum, Guidance for Processing \nReasonable Fear, Credible Fear, Asylum, and Refugee Claims in Accordance with Matter of A-\nB-, July 11, 2018 (PM-602-0162) (“USCIS Guidance”).  \nviii \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 84   Filed 10/03/18   Page 10 of 36\nare “unable or unwilling” to provide effective protection against non-state agents of persecution, \n(2) the definition of a “particular social group,” and (3) the “nexus” requirement in relation to \nwhether persecution by non-state actors may be “on account of” membership in a “particular social \ngroup.”   \nIn addition, UNHCR has an interest in this matter because the new policies carry significant \nramifications for the credible fear screening process.  UNHCR’s responsibility for supervising the \napplication of the 1951 Convention and its 1967 Protocol extends to guiding states on measures \nthat help prevent the refoulement of asylum seekers or refugees, thus acknowledging that non-\nrefoulement is a cornerstone of the international refugee law regime.  UNHCR, Declaration of \nStates Parties to the 1951 Convention and Its 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees ¶ 4 \n(Jan. 16, 2002).10  Access to fair and efficient asylum procedures is a foundational measure that \nprevents refoulement.  While UNHCR recognizes that a State may establish accelerated processes, \nsuch  processes  must  meet  certain  minimum  standards  to  comply  with  international  legal \nobligations.   \nUNHCR  submits  this  brief  to  provide  guidance  to  this  Court  on  these  obligations.  \nConsistent with its approach in other cases, UNHCR takes no position directly on the merits of \nPlaintiffs’ claims but, through this brief, expresses its interest and concern with the interpretation \nand application of international refugee instruments as a matter of law and principle.   \n \n \n                                                 \n10 http://www.refworld.org/docid/3d60f5557.html. \nix \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 84   Filed 10/03/18   Page 11 of 36\n \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nUNHCR has long held that violence perpetrated by non-state actors, including gang and \ndomestic  violence,  may  constitute  persecution  undergirding  an  asylum  claim  based  upon \nmembership in a particular social group.  Other States with significant jurisprudence on refugee \nstatus determination, such as Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and all \nEuropean Union member states have reached the same conclusion—as has the United States \nhistorically.  The new policies at issue, however, state that violence by non-state actors generally \ndoes not constitute a basis for asylum—or even a “credible fear” of persecution—based on their \napproach to (a) assessing the inability or unwillingness of the state to protect a person from \npersecution; (b) the interpretation of what constitutes a “particular social group,” and (c) the nexus \nbetween fear of persecution and membership in a particular social group.  As a result, many victims \nof violence by non-state actors may not even have a meaningful opportunity to apply for asylum.  \nIn reaching this outcome, the new policies have interpreted the refugee definition in a manner at \nvariance with the United States’ international obligations on a number of fronts. \nFirst, in assessing state protection, the new policies recast the “unable or unwilling” \nstandard into one requiring a showing of “complete helplessness” or “condoned” action.  Second, \nthe new policies misconstrue the requirements for defining a particular social group, and further \nelevate a threshold that was already too high by international standards.  Third, the new policies \nmisapply the nexus requirement, creating an unjustified barrier to persons fleeing gang and \ndomestic violence.  Fourth, the new policies apply all of the aforementioned standards to the \ncredible fear interview process—a process that should screen out only “clearly abusive” or \n“manifestly unfounded” claims.  Imposing these standards at the initial screening stage jeopardizes \nthe ability of decision-makers to recognize meritorious claims, thereby increasing the risk that the \nUnited States will be at variance with its obligation to non-refoulement. \n1 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 84   Filed 10/03/18   Page 12 of 36\n \nARGUMENT \nI.  THE UNITED STATES IS BOUND BY THE 1951 CONVENTION AND ITS 1967 \nPROTOCOL RELATING TO THE STATUS OF REFUGEES \nThe 1951 Convention and its 1967 Protocol are the key international instruments governing \nthe protection of refugees.  These documents address who is a refugee, his or her rights and \nresponsibilities, and the corresponding legal obligations of States.  The 1967 Protocol binds parties \nto comply with the substantive provisions of Articles 2 through 34 of the 1951 Convention with \nrespect to “refugees” as defined in Article 1A(2) of the 1951 Convention.  1967 Protocol art. 1(1)–\n(2).  The 1967 Protocol also removes the geographic and temporal limitations from the 1951 \nConvention definition, thus universalizing the refugee definition.  Id. art. 1(2)–(3).  The core of \nboth the 1951 Convention and its 1967 Protocol is the principle of non-refoulement, which obliges \nStates not to return a refugee to any country where he or she would face persecution or a real risk \nof serious harm.11  In 1968, the United States acceded to the 1967 Protocol,12 thereby binding \nitself to the international refugee protection regime and the definition of a refugee as contained in \nthe 1951 Convention. \nCongress enacted the Refugee Act of 1980, Pub. L. No. 96-212, 94 Stat. 102 (1980), \nexpressly to “bring United States refugee law into conformance with the 1967 United Nations \nProtocol Relating to the Status of Refugees,” Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 436–37 n.19 (citing \nH.R. Rep. No. 96-781, at 19); see also INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415, 427 (1999).  The \n                                                 \n11 The prohibition of refoulement applies to all refugees, including those who have not formally \nbeen recognized as such, and to asylum-seekers whose status has not yet been determined.  \nUNHCR, Note on International Protection ¶ 11, U.N.

It should be interpreted and applied in a \nmanner consistent with those instruments.  See Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 437 (by enacting \nRefugee Act, Congress intended “that the new statutory definition of ‘refugee’ be interpreted in \nconformance with the Protocol’s definition”); cf. Murray v. Schooner Charming Betsy, 6 U.S. (2 \nCranch) 64, 118 (1804) (“[A]n act of Congress ought never to be construed to violate the law of \nnations if any other possible construction remains.”).  \nII.  AS  RECOGNIZED  BY  U.S.  AND  FOREIGN  COURTS,  UNHCR  PROVIDES \nAUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE IN EVALUATING CLAIMS OF PERSECUTION \nBY NON-STATE ACTORS \nUNHCR exercises its supervisory responsibility by issuing interpretive guidance on the \nmeaning of provisions contained in the 1951 Convention and its 1967 Protocol.  The most \nauthoritative of this guidance is the UNHCR Handbook, which was prepared in 1979 at the request \nof Member States, including the United States.  Although the Handbook is not legally binding \nupon U.S. officials, it nevertheless provides “significant guidance” in construing the 1967 Protocol \nand in giving content to the obligations established therein.  Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 439 \nn.22; see also Matter of S-P-, 21 I. & N. Dec. 486, 492 (B.I.A. 1996) (en banc). \nIn 2002, UNHCR also began issuing a number of Guidelines,13 which have been welcomed \nby the Executive Committee and the UN General Assembly.14  The Guidelines complement and \n                                                 \n13 UNHCR, Agenda for Protection, U.N. Doc. A/AC.96/965/Add.1 (June 26, 2002), \nhttp://www.refworld.org/docid/3d4fd0266.html. \n14 UNHCR’s governing Executive Committee was established by the United Nations’ Economic \nand Social Council in 1958.  The Executive Committee functions as a subsidiary organ of the \nUN General Assembly and its report is submitted directly to the General Assembly for \nconsideration.  The Executive Committee’s functions include advising the High Commissioner in \nthe exercise of his/her functions, and includes issuing Conclusions on International Protection \n(often referred to as “ExCom Conclusions”), which address issues in the field of refugee \nprotection and serve as “international guidelines to be drawn upon by States, UNHCR and others \nwhen developing or orienting their policies on refugee issues.”  See UNHCR, General \n3 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 84   Filed 10/03/18   Page 14 of 36\n \nupdate the Handbook by drawing upon international legal standards, judicial decisions, Executive \nCommittee Conclusions, academic literature, and UNHCR’s views and experience.  UNHCR also \nissues Guidance Notes to provide additional direction in specific areas.  Courts have relied upon \nthe Guidelines and Guidance Notes in assessing refugee claims, recognizing that UNHCR’s \n“analysis provides significant guidance for issues of refugee law.”  Mohammed v. Gonzales, 400 \nF.3d 785, 798 (9th Cir. 2005); Bringas-Rodriguez v. Sessions, 850 F.3d 1051, 1071 (9th Cir. 2017) \n(en banc). \nApplied here, the Handbook, Guidelines, and Guidance Notes all affirm the well-settled \nprinciple that persecution by non-state actors may form the basis of an asylum claim.  The \nHandbook expressly recognizes that asylum may be warranted by persecution “emanat[ing] from \nsections of the population . . . [whose] serious discriminatory or other offensive acts . . . are \nknowingly tolerated by the authorities, or if the authorities refuse, or prove unable, to offer \neffective protection.”  Handbook ¶ 65.  Non-state agents include “paramilitary groups, militias, \ninsurgents, bandits, pirates, criminal gangs or organizations,” in addition to “neighbors, family \nmembers and other individuals.”  Guidelines on International Protection No. 12:  Claims for \nRefugee Status Related to Situations of Armed Conflict and Violence Under Article 1A(2) of the \n1951 Convention and/or 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees and the Regional \nRefugee  Definitions  ¶  28,  U.N.

ExCom Conclusions \nare adopted through consensus by the States which are Members of the Executive Committee \nand can therefore be considered as reflecting their understanding of legal standards regarding the \nprotection of refugees.  At present, 102 states are Members of the Executive Committee, \nincluding the United States, which is one of the original members.

Doc. \nHCR/GIP/02/01 (May 7, 2002) (“Gender Guidelines”).16  UNHCR also recognizes potential \nasylum  claims  for  individuals  persecuted  by  “family  members,  neighbors,  or  the  broader \ncommunity,” in, for example, cases of LGBTI people;17 by Al Shabaab in Somalia;18 by Boko \nHaram in Nigeria;19 and by the Taliban in Afghanistan.20  \nConsistent with UNHCR’s position, parties to the 1951 Convention and its 1967 Protocol \nhave recognized valid asylum claims stemming from persecution by non-state actors, including \npersecution stemming from gang and domestic violence.

VIOLENCE BY NON-STATE ACTORS—IN PARTICULAR, GANG VIOLENCE \nAND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE—CAN FORM THE BASIS FOR ASYLUM \nThe USCIS Guidance emphasizes that, “[i]n general, . . . claims based on membership in a \nputative particular social group defined by the members’ vulnerability to harm of domestic \nviolence or gang violence committed by non-government actors will not establish the basis for \nasylum [or] refugee status.”  USCIS Guidance at 6; accord Matter of A-B-, 27 I.&N. Dec. at 320.  \nThat directive diverges from the UNHCR guidance, international case law, and U.S. precedent \nconcerning non-state actors discussed above.  Departure from this well-settled and foundational \nlegal principle is due to erroneous interpretations of (a) the “unable or unwilling” standard, (b) the \n“particular social group” definition, and (c) the nexus requirement.  The elevated standards in these \nareas  form  an  impermissible  obstacle  for  victims  of  persecution  seeking  to  obtain  asylum, \nparticularly since the standards must—under the new policies—all be applied at the outset, at an \nindividual’s credible fear interview.  We discuss these various erroneous interpretations in turn.   \nA.  The  New  Policies  Erroneously  State  that  Gang  Violence  and  Domestic \nViolence Claims Do Not Meet the “Unable or Unwilling” Standard   \nFor violence perpetrated by non-state actors to constitute persecution, an individual must \ndemonstrate that the state is “unable or unwilling” to provide adequate protection to victims.  \nGuidance Note on Refugee Claims Relating to Victims of Organized Gangs ¶ 25 (Mar. 2010) \n(“Gang  Note”);29  see  Gender  Guidelines  ¶  19;  Armed  Conflict  Guidelines  ¶  30.    Such  a \ndetermination requires a “holistic and integrated analysis” and “judicious balancing” of several \nfactors, including “the general state of law, order and justice in the country, and its effectiveness, \n                                                 \n29 http://www.refworld.org/docid/4bb21fa02.html.  \n7 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 84   Filed 10/03/18   Page 18 of 36\n \nincluding the resources available and the ability  and willingness to use them properly and \neffectively to protect residents.”  UNHCR, Interpreting Article 1 of the 1951 Convention Relating \nto the Status of Refugees ¶¶ 7, 15 (Apr. 2001) (“Interpreting 1951 Convention”).30   \nThe new policies upend this holistic analysis.  They require asylum-seekers to show that \n“the government condoned the private actions or at least demonstrated a complete helplessness to \nprotect the victim.”  USCIS Guidance at 6; Matter of A-B-, 27 I.&N. Dec. at 337.  “The mere fact \nthat a country . . . has problems effectively policing certain crimes, like domestic violence or gang-\nrelated activities . . . cannot, by itself, establish eligibility for asylum.”  USCIS Guidance at 6.  In \nother words, under the new policies, occasional, piecemeal, or partial protection by a state will \nnegate an asylum claim, even if that state is unable or unwilling to prevent violence in the vast \nmajority of cases.  As examined below, this unduly narrow construction of the “unable or \nunwilling” standard significantly diverges from the United States’ international obligations.   \n1.  The New Policies Are Inconsistent with the Settled Meaning of the \n“Unable or Unwilling” Standard \nThe hallmark of state protection is the state’s ability to provide effective protection, which \nrequires effective control of non-state actors.  See Handbook ¶ 65 (acts constitute persecution “if \nthey are knowingly tolerated by the authorities, or if the authorities refuse, or prove unable to offer \neffective protection”); Gang Note ¶ 25 (harm can constitute persecution when the state is “unable \nto provide effective protection”).  State protection is ineffective where “the police fail to respond \nto request for protection or the authorities refuse to investigate, prosecute or punish (non-state) \nperpetrators of violence . . . with due diligence.”  Sexual Orientation Guidelines ¶¶ 34–37.   \nMerely enacting a law prohibiting persecutory practices is not enough:  “Even though a \nparticular State may have prohibited a persecutory practice (e.g., female genital mutilation), the \n                                                 \n30 http://www.refworld.org/docid/3b20a3914.html. \n8 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 84   Filed 10/03/18   Page 19 of 36\n \nState may nevertheless continue to condone or tolerate the practice, or may not be able to stop the \npractice effectively.”  Gender Guidelines ¶ 11.  Despite best intentions and efforts, there may be \nan incongruity between avowed commitments and reality on the ground.  Effective protection \ndepends on both de jure and de facto capability by the authorities.  For example, in determining \nwhether a state offers effective protection for human trafficking, UNHCR notes:   \nWhether the authorities in the country of origin are able to protect victims or \npotential  victims  of  trafficking  will  depend  on  whether  legislative  and \nadministrative  mechanisms  have  been  put  in  place  to  prevent  and  combat \ntrafficking, as well as to protect and assist the victims and on whether these \nmechanisms are effectively implemented in practice. \nUNHCR, Guidelines on International Protection No. 7:  The Application of Article 1A(2) of the \n1951 Convention and/or 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees to Victims of Trafficking \nand  Persons  at  Risk  of  Being  Trafficked  ¶  22,  U.N.  Doc.  HCR/GIP/06/07  (Apr.  7,  2006) \n(“Trafficking Guidelines”);31 see also Interpreting 1951 Convention ¶ 15 (ability to offer effective \nprotection requires examining “the general state of law, order and justice in the country, and its \neffectiveness, including the resources available and the ability and willingness to use them \nproperly and effectively to protect residents”).  \nConsistent with UNHCR’s interpretation, other parties to the 1951 Convention and its 1967 \nProtocol do not require complete helplessness, and recognize violence perpetrated by non-state \nparties as persecution whenever state protection is ineffective.  Canada instructs decision-makers \nto “carefully assess . . . the degree of actual implementation, the effectiveness, and the durability \nof  . . . legislative or other achievements” in determining the adequacy  of state protection.  \nImmigration and Refugee Board of Canada, Chairperson’s Guideline 9:  Proceedings Before the \nIRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression ¶ 8.6 (May 1, 2017).  \n                                                 \n31 http://www.refworld.org/docid/443679fa4.html. \n9 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 84   Filed 10/03/18   Page 20 of 36\n \nSimilarly, the United Kingdom embraces a “practical standard” that examines actual practices and \nrequires protection to be “meaningful, accessible, effective, and available to a woman regardless \nof her culture and position.”  United Kingdom Immigration Appellate Authority, Asylum Gender \nGuidelines ¶¶ 2B.2–3 (Nov. 1, 2000).32 \nTurning  the  “unable  or  unwilling”  into  a  “condoned”  or  “complete  helplessness” \nrequirement is a significant departure from this settled international standard.  The new policies \nmake  the  “unable  or  unwilling”  prong  harder  to  meet—an  intention  without  support  in \ninternational law.  A state does not have to “condone” private violence to be “unwilling” or \n“unable” to offer protection, nor does a victim need to show the state’s “complete helplessness” \nfor state protection to be unavailable or ineffective.   \n2.  Gang Violence and Domestic Violence Claims Can Meet the “Unable \nor Unwilling” Standard \nThe new policies’ erroneous approach towards the “unable or unwilling” standard becomes \nall the more pronounced in the gang and domestic violence context.  As noted, the new policies \nstate that gang and domestic violence generally will not form the basis for a meritorious asylum \nclaim because victims of such violence cannot demonstrate that the state was completely helpless \nor condoned private action.  That directive runs counter to UNHCR’s on-the-ground experience.   \nTo exercise its supervisory responsibility effectively, UNHCR has field offices in the vast \nmajority of originating countries for asylum seekers, including El Salvador, Guatemala, and \nHonduras.  Relying on in-depth research from these offices, material from independent country \nspecialists,  and  other  sources,  UNHCR  has  carefully  compiled  country-specific  Eligibility \n                                                 \n32 http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6b3414.html. \n10 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 84   Filed 10/03/18   Page 21 of 36\n \nGuidelines.    The  Eligibility  Guidelines  rigorously  analyze  factors  relevant  to  asylum \ndeterminations, including the effectiveness of state protection.33    \nBased on its decades-long presence in countries affected by gang violence, UNHCR \nencourages  decision-makers  to  examine  “efforts  to  reform  and  expand  the  criminal  justice \nsystem[,] establish[] witness protection programmes,” and—conversely—the “lack of measures to \nensure security to individuals at risk of harm by gangs.”  Gang Note ¶ 28.  “The [s]tate [may] prove \nunable to provide effective protection, especially when certain gangs . . . yield considerable power \nand capacity to evade law enforcement or when the corruption is pervasive.”  Id. ¶ 25.  Likewise, \nthe state “may be unwilling to protect a particular individual, for instance, because of their own \nfinancial interest in the gang activities or because they consider the person associated with or \ntargeted by the gangs unworthy of protection.”  Id.  \nIn El Salvador, for example, gangs “exercise extraordinary levels of social control over the \npopulation of their territories.”  UNHCR, Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International \nProtection Needs of Asylum-Seekers from El Salvador at 12, U.N. Doc. HCR/EG/SLV/16/01 (Mar. \n15, 2016) (“El Salvador Guidelines”).34  Despite the formal existence of an anti-gang legal \nframework, “weakness and corruption” in the police and judiciary “contribute to creating a high \nlevel of impunity for crimes in El Salvador.”  Id. at 23; see also U.S. State Dep’t, El Salvador 2017 \nHuman Rights Report at 15 (“U.S. State Dep’t, El Salvador  Report”).   In  gang-controlled \nterritories, “the police—even the elite Anti-Gang Unit in high-profile cases—are usually not seen \nas offering a sufficient form of protection . . . , since their presence is only temporary and gangs \n                                                 \n33 For a detailed explanation of the methodology used, see Affidavit of Janice Lyn Marshall, \nStaten v/Utlendingsnemnda (Regjeringsadvokaten) v. A, B, C, D, Oct. 26, 2015 (Nor.), \nhttp://www.refworld.org/docid/5b8900109.html. \n34 http://www.refworld.org/docid/56e706e94.html. \n11 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 84   Filed 10/03/18   Page 22 of 36\n \nwill return once the police move on after a few hours or days.”  El Salvador Guidelines at 24; see \nU.S. State Dep’t, El Salvador Report at 19 (“The major gangs controlled their own territory.  Gang \nmembers did not allow persons living in another gang’s controlled area to enter their territory.”).  \nGangs have their own infiltrators in the police and military, who warn about anti-gang operations \nand have access to weapons and uniforms.  El Salvador Guidelines at 23.  \nGangs’  “extraordinary  levels  of  social  control”  and  the  state’s  corresponding \nineffectiveness in combating gang-related crimes are also pervasive in other Central American \ncountries.  See UNHCR, Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs \nof Asylum-Seekers from Honduras at 18–19, 38–39, U.N. Doc. HCR/EG/HND/16/03 (July 27, \n2016) (“Honduras Guidelines”) (police are “not usually seen as offering a sufficient form of \nprotection for residents who are threatened by gangs” and are “reported to acknowledge their fear \nat the inability of the State to protect them from assassination when they are off duty”);35 UNHCR, \nEligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs of Asylum-Seekers from \nGuatemala at 34, U.N. Doc. HCR/EG/GTM/18/01 (Jan. 2018)36 (“[I]n certain parts of the country \nthe Government has lost effective control to gangs and other organized criminal groups and is \nunable to provide protection to inhabitants.”). \nEqually, domestic violence victims also often do not receive effective protection from the \nstate.  In some Central American societies, “[i]mpunity for violence against women and girls \nremain a serious problem.”  Honduras Guidelines at 39.  The high impunity rate contributes to the \nvictims’ “lack of confidence in . . . an ineffective and unsupportive justice system,” thus preventing \nthem from even reporting domestic violence incidents to the authorities.  El Salvador Guidelines \n                                                 \n35 http://www.refworld.org/docid/579767434.html. \n36 http://www.refworld.org/docid/5a5e03e96.html. \n12 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 84   Filed 10/03/18   Page 23 of 36\n \nat 25.  The state’s ineffective protection against domestic violence is often exacerbated by its \ninability to protect against gang violence.  In a study of 160 women from El Salvador, Guatemala, \nHonduras, and Mexico, UNHCR found that women “consistently stated that police and state law \nenforcement authorities were unable to provide sufficient protection from [] violence.”  UNHCR, \nWomen on the Run:  First-Hand Accounts of Refugees Fleeing El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, \nand Mexico at 4 (Oct. 26 2015).37  Many of the women’s partners were gang members or \nassociates.  Id. at 25.  “[B]ecause these [criminal] groups were often [regarded as] the highest \npower in the neighborhoods, [the women] did not believe the government could protect them.”  \nId.; see also U.S. State Dep’t, El Salvador Report at 23; U.S. State Dep’t, Guatemala 2017 Human \nRights Report at 17. \nThe above evidence reflects that—at least in some countries and in some instances—states \nmay be unable or unwilling to offer effective protection to persons who have been persecuted by \nnon-state actors.  The new policies therefore err by directing that gang and domestic violence \nclaims  generally  do  not  meet  the  “unable  or  unwilling”  standard  when  assessing  asylee’s \napplication.  \nB.  The New Policies Err in Their Particular Social Group Analysis  \nThe new policies also change the approach to asylum claims based upon “membership in \na particular social group,” elevating the standard far beyond the international threshold.  To be \nsure, although “membership in a particular social group” has long been an ambiguous legal term, \nMatter of A-B-, 27 I.&N. Dec. at 326, jurisprudence and commentary have over time helped clarify \nits meaning.  UNHCR’s Social Group Guidelines adopt two approaches to defining a particular \nsocial group:  \n                                                 \n37 http://www.refworld.org/docid/56307e2a4.html. \n13 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 84   Filed 10/03/18   Page 24 of 36\n \n[A] particular social group is a group of persons who share a common characteristic \nother than their risk of being persecuted [the “protected characteristics” approach], \nor who are perceived as a group by society [the “social perception” approach].  The \ncharacteristic will often be one which is innate, unchangeable, or which is otherwise \nfundamental to identity, conscience or the exercise of one’s human rights.  \nGuidelines on International Protection No. 2:  “Membership of a Particular Social Group” Within \nthe Context of Article 1A(2) of the 1951 Convention and/or Its 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status \nof  Refugees  ¶  11,  U.N.  Doc.  HCR/GIP/02/02  (May  7,  2002)  (“Social  Group  Guidelines”) \n(emphasis added).38  A particular social group must be identifiable through one of the approaches, \nnot both.  Gang Note ¶ 35.  Several States have endorsed the “protected characteristics” approach \nwithout requiring social perception.  See Ward, [1993] 2 S.C.R. at 689 (Can.); Islam and Shah, \n[1999] UKHL at 20; Sec’y of State for the Home Dep’t v. K (FC), and Fornah (FC) v. Sec’y of \nState for the Home Dep’t [2006] UKHL 46, [2007] 1 A.C. (HL) 412 (appeal taken from Eng.);39 \nRefugee Appeal No. 1312/93 Re GJ [1995] 1 NLR 387 (N.Z.).40   \nThis either/or approach—first delineated in Matter of Acosta, 19 I.&N. Dec. 211, 233 \n(B.I.A. 1985), overruled in part on other grounds by Matter of Mogharrabi, 19 I.&N. Dec. 439 \n(B.I.A. 1987)—also  guided U.S. asylum decisions until the Board of  Immigration Appeals \ndiverged in 2008 by requiring asylum-seekers to prove “social perception” and “particularity,” in \naddition to “protected characteristics.”  Matter of S-E-G-, 24 I.&N. Dec. 579, 582, 589 (B.I.A. \n2008).  As UNHCR has noted, imposing these additional, heightened requirements is contrary to \nthe object and purpose of the 1951 Convention, 1967 Protocol, and Social Group Guidelines.41   \n                                                 \n38 http://www.refworld.org/docid/3d36f23f4.html. \n39 http://www.refworld.org/cases,GBR_HL,4550a9502.html. \n40 http://www.refworld.org/cases,NZL_RSAA,3ae6b6938.html. \n41 See UNHCR Amicus Curiae Br. in Support of Resp’t, Valdiviezo-Galdamez v.

Instead, they maintain the additional, heightened \nrequirements delineated in Matter of S-E-G-, and apply these requirements in a flawed manner to \nthe facts at hand.  These missteps compound one another, resulting in a position that is even further \nfrom the international consensus.  Matter of A-B-, 27 I.&N. Dec. at 319, 335 (rejecting asylum for \n“[s]ocial groups defined by their vulnerability to private criminal activity,” including “groups \ncomprising persons who are ‘resistant to gang violence’ and susceptible to violence from gang \nmembers on that basis”).  UNHCR maintains that the U.S. approach—i.e., requiring protected \ncharacteristics, social visibility, and particularity—is inconsistent with international law.  Even \nunder a correct application of the heightened U.S. standard, however, UNHCR observes that \npeople at risk of gang violence and domestic violence—both categories of victims of non-state \npersecution—may nonetheless constitute members of a particular social group.   \n1.  Protected Characteristics \nThe “protected characteristics” approach examines “whether a group is united by an \nimmutable characteristic or by a characteristic that is so fundamental to human dignity that a \nperson should not be compelled to forsake it.”  Social Group Guidelines ¶ 6.   \nAs to gang violence, victims resisting forced recruitment may share innate or immutable \ncharacteristics, such as age, gender, and social status.  Gang Note ¶ 36.  To this point, a USAID \nstudy on Central American gangs found that youth between the ages of 8 and 18 were particularly \nvulnerable to recruitment.  USAID, Central America and Mexico Gang Assessment Report 15 \n(Aug. 2006).42  UNHCR likewise notes that young people are more susceptible to recruitment \nbecause of their “age, impressionability, dependency, poverty and lack of parental guidance.”  \nGang Note ¶ 36; Honduras Guidelines at 15, 16.  Additionally, “[p]ast actions or experiences, such \n                                                 \n42 https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNADG834.pdf. \n15 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 84   Filed 10/03/18   Page 26 of 36\n \nas refusal to join a gang, may be considered irreversible and thus immutable.”  Id. ¶ 37; Social \nGroup Guidelines ¶ 6; Matter of S-E-G-, 24 I.&N. Dec. at 584 (“[Y]outh who have been targeted \nfor recruitment by, and resisted, criminal gangs may have a shared past experience, which, by \ndefinition, cannot be changed.”).  \nConsistent with this interpretation, parties to the 1951 Convention and its 1967 Protocol—\nincluding the United States—have held that gang violence victims or resisters to gang recruitment \nmay form particular social groups under the protected characteristics approach.  See Tobias Gomez, \n2011 F.C. at 1093 (innate characteristics and shared past experience); AZ, [2010] UKUT at 118 \n(shared past experience); Valdiviezo-Galdamez v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 502 F.3d 285, 291 (3d Cir. \n2007) (remanding to BIA to consider whether “young Honduran men who have been actively \nrecruited by gangs and who have refused to join the gangs” constitute particular social group; \nnoting that group “shares the characteristics of other groups that the BIA has found to constitute a \n‘particular social group’”). \nAs to domestic violence, the particular social group applicable to such cases may be defined \nby gender alone, or by gender in combination with other characteristics related to relationship \nstatus.  Both groups qualify under the “protected characteristics” approach.  In UNHCR’s view, \n“sex can properly be within the ambit of the social group category, with women being a clear \nexample of a social subset defined by innate and immutable characteristics.”  Social Group \nGuidelines ¶ 12; Gender Guidelines ¶ 30; see also Ward, 2 S.C.R. at 739 (contemplating a \nparticular social group encompassing all women); VM (FGM-risks-Mungiki-Kikuyu/Gikuyu) \nKenya v. Sec’y of State for the Home Dep’t [2008] UKAIT 00049 (recognizing a particular social \ngroup of “women (girls) in Kenya”).43 \n                                                 \n43 http://www.refworld.org/docid/484d4a222.html. \n16 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 84   Filed 10/03/18   Page 27 of 36\n \nAlternatively, particular social groups may be defined by gender in combination with other \nfactors.  See, e.g., Niang, 422 F.3d at 1199.  These other factors include relationship status, which \nmay be unchangeable because of external religious, cultural, or legal constraints.  Cf. U.N. Centre \nfor Soc. Dev. & Humanitarian Affairs, Violence Against Women in the Family 33, U.N. Doc. \nST/CSDHA/2 (1989) (“Violence Against Women”) (noting that men in Guatemala and El Salvador \nsocieties view “the women they live with [as] their possessions or chattels”).  \nThe new policies erroneously hold that the proposed group in Matter of A-B-, “married \nwomen in Guatemala who are unable to leave their relationship,” is defined circularly by a fear of \nbeing subject to domestic violence.  While a particular social group cannot be defined “exclusively \nby the persecution . . . or by a common fear of being persecuted,” “persecutory action toward a \ngroup may be a relevant factor” in determining the contours of that group.  Social Group \nGuidelines ¶ 14; accord A v Minister for Immigration & Ethnic Affairs [1997] HCA 4 (Austl.).44  \nInability to leave a relationship may be caused by factors apart from the threat of harm from a \ndomestic partner—because of, say, cultural or religious reasons.  Among other things, women in \ndomestic relationships in Guatemala and El Salvador are considered subordinate to, and under the \ncontrol of, their male partners.  Violence Against Women at 33.  By assuming that “unable to leave \ntheir  relationship”  is  equivalent  to  being  “subject  to  domestic  violence,”  the  new  policies \nimproperly  conflate  wider  sociocultural  norms  that  subordinate  women  to  men  in  Central \nAmerican societies. \n2.  Social Perception \nThe  social  perception  approach  examines  whether  group  members  share  a  common \ncharacteristic that makes them a cognizable group or that sets them apart from society at large.  \n                                                 \n44 http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6b7180.html. \n17 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 84   Filed 10/03/18   Page 28 of 36\n \nSocial Group Guidelines ¶ 7; see also A v Minister for Immigration & Ethnic Affairs [1997] HCA \n4 (Austl.).   \nGang violence victims may constitute a particular social group under such an approach.  In \na society “where it is risky for people to oppose gangs, often in closely knitted neighborhoods that \nare effectively controlled by gangs, gang resisters may be set apart in society.”  Gang Note ¶ 41.  \nThis situation is common in Central America, where gangs exert extraordinary social control.  El \nSalvador Guidelines at 12; Honduras Guidelines at 18, 38.  For example, in El Salvador, “[p]ersons \nwho resist the authority of the local gang . . . are reportedly subject to swift and brutal retaliation \nfrom the gang.”  El Salvador Guidelines at 13.  Similar circumstances affect Hondurans.  Honduras \nGuidelines at 18 (“Many gangs are reported to forbid inhabitants to show ‘disrespect’ for the gang \n[which can] encompass arguing with a gang member or refusing a request.”).   \nA particular social group of domestic violence victims can also satisfy the social perception \nrequirement.  See Social Group Guidelines ¶ 7 (“[W]omen . . . have been recognized under [the \nsocial perception analysis] as particular social groups.”).  Being female “identif[ies] them as a \ngroup in society, subjecting them to different treatment and standards in some countries.”  Gender \nGuidelines ¶ 30; see also Khawar, [2002] HCA 14, ¶ 35 (“Women in any society are a distinct and \nrecognizable group; and their distinctive attributes and characteristics exist independently of the \nmanner in which they are treated, either by males or by governments.”).  Moreover, in certain \nCentral American countries, the intersection of gender and relationship status also identifies a \nsocially distinct group.  Women in domestic relationships are considered subordinate to, and under \nthe control of, their male partners—a view that contributes to the serious problem of domestic \nviolence in Guatemala and El Salvador.  This in turn reinforces for men that “the women they live \nwith are their possessions or chattels that they can treat as they wish and as they consider \n18 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 84   Filed 10/03/18   Page 29 of 36\n \nappropriate.”  Violence Against Women at 33.  A woman’s subordinate status places her in a \nsegment of society that is not accorded protection from harm by a domestic partner. \n3.  Particularity   \nAs  to  “particularity,”  the  new  policies  assert  that  “[s]ocial  groups  defined  by  their \nvulnerability to private criminal activity likely lack . . . particularity [because] . . . broad swaths of \nsociety may be susceptible to victimization.”  Matter of A-B-, 27 I.&N. Dec. at 335.  Gang violence \nvictims do not form a particular social group because they “are too diffuse” and “often come from \nall segments of society.”  Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nHowever, under prevailing international standards, the size and diffusiveness of a proposed \ngroup are irrelevant.  Social Group Guidelines ¶ 18 (“The size of the purported social group is not \na relevant criterion in determining whether a particular social group exists within the meaning of \nArticle 1A(2).”); id. ¶ 15 (“It is widely accepted in State practice that . . . there is no requirement \nthat the group be ‘cohesive.’”).   \nLooking outside the particular social group context, and towards the other protected \ngrounds, broad swaths of society—“perhaps even . . . a majority of the population”—may share \nreligious or political ideologies that are suppressed by the state.  Id. ¶ 18.  “[M]embers of a religion \nor holders of a political opinion” may likewise come from all segments of society.  Id. ¶ 15.  In \nshort, there is no size or diffusiveness requirement for those seeking asylum on account of race, \nreligious, nationality, or political opinion.  It makes little sense to impose a set of more demanding \nrequirements for asylum on account of membership in a particular social group, particularly as \ninternational guidance and U.S. case law embraces a “flexible” approach towards this protected \nground.  Id. ¶ 3 (“[M]embership in a particular social group should be read in an evolutionary \nmanner, open to the diverse and changing nature of group in various societies and evolving human \n19 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 84   Filed 10/03/18   Page 30 of 36\n \nrights norms.”); Rios v. Lynch, 807 F.3d 1123, 1124 (9th Cir. 2015) (particular social group is an \n“inherently flexible term”); Ruiz-Cabrera v. Holder, 748 F.3d 754, 757 (7th Cir. 2014) (same).  \nC.  The New Policies Err in Their Nexus Analysis \nUnder the INA, asylum seekers must demonstrate that a protected ground “was or will be \nat least one central reason for” the alleged persecution—a provision commonly known as the nexus \nrequirement.  8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(i); Cruz v. Sessions, 853 F.3d 122, 127–28 (4th Cir. 2017).  \nOn this point, the USCIS Guidance asserts that “when a private actor inflicts violence based on a \npersonal relationship with the victim, the victim’s membership in a larger group often will not be \n‘one central reason’ for the abuse.”  USCIS Guidance at 6; Matter of A-B-, 27 I.&N. Dec. at 338–\n39.  According to the new policies, gang and domestic violence victims are targeted not because \nof their membership in a social group, but because of their “preexisting personal relationship” with \nthe persecutors.  Id. at 339.  These instructions misapply the nexus requirement.  \nPursuant  to  the  1951  Convention,  the  protected  ground  need  only  be  a  “relevant \ncontributing factor, though it need not be shown to be the sole, or dominant, cause” of the \npersecution. Gender Guidelines ¶ 20; Trafficking Guidelines ¶ 29.  Nexus is established when “the \nharm is being visited upon the victim for reasons of a Convention ground.” Social Group \nGuidelines ¶ 21. When the persecutor is a non-state actor, nexus may also be established “where \nthe risk of being persecuted at the hands of a non-state actor is unrelated to a Convention ground, \nbut the inability or unwillingness of the state to offer protection is for reasons of a Convention \nground.”  Gender Guidelines ¶ 21; Social Group Guidelines ¶ 20.  UNHCR recognizes these as \nseparate  ways  to  establish  nexus:    targeting  by  the  private  actor  or  non-protection  by  the \ngovernment.  \nAs to gang violence, the necessary link between membership in a particular social group \nand persecution can be established by the “strategies, tactics or means and methods of [violence] \n20 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 84   Filed 10/03/18   Page 31 of 36\n \nof the persecutor.”  Armed Conflict Guidelines ¶ 32; Gang Note ¶ 65.  Because some Central \nAmerican gangs exercise “extraordinary levels of social control over the population of their \nterritories,” they do not tolerate “‘disrespect’ for the gang.”  El Salvador Guidelines at 13.  A key \nstrategy to maintaining control is “swift and brutal retaliation” against any person who “resist[s] \nthe authority of the local gang.”  Id. at 13–14.  For these gangs, a victim’s membership in a \nparticular social group clearly serves as a contributing factor to persecution.  \nIn the context of domestic violence, “if the State is unwilling to extend protection based on \none of the five grounds, then she may [nonetheless] be able to establish a valid claim for refugee \nstatus: the harm visited upon her by her husband is based on the State’s unwillingness to protect \nher for reasons of a Convention ground.” Social Group Guidelines ¶ 22.  Moreover, perpetrators \nin societies that oppress women often abuse their victims precisely because they are in a domestic \nrelationship and unable to leave, a point previously acknowledged.  See DHS’s Position on Respt’s \nEligibility for Relief, Matter of R-A-, A 73 753 922, at 27 (A.G. Feb. 19, 2004) (“DHS R-A- Brief”) \n(“A group defined as ‘married women in Guatemala who are unable to leave the relationship’ . . . \naccurately identifies the reason why the persecutor chose his wife as his victim.”).  The domestic \nrelationship places the woman in a subordinate position, and her partner abuses her because of his \ncorresponding belief in his right to control and abuse her, which society affirms.  See Special \nRapporteur on Violence Against Women, its Causes and Consequences, Further Promotion and \nEncouragement of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, Including the Question of the \nProgramme and Methods of Work of the Commission ¶¶ 27, 53, U.N. Doc. E/CN.4/1996/53 (Feb. \n5, 1996);45 Violence Against Women at 33.  Evidence of this nexus may come directly from the \nabuser and/or from circumstantial evidence (such as country condition information) that domestic \n                                                 \n45 http://undocs.org/E/CN.4/1996/53.  \n21 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 84   Filed 10/03/18   Page 32 of 36\n \nviolence against women is accepted or supported by a state.  A gendered social and cultural value \nsystem may implicate the state’s inability or unwillingness to protect domestic violence victims. \nThe new policies assert that domestic violence cases are not on account of the victims’ \nmembership in a particular social group because the persecutors only target their partners, and do \nnot “b[ear] any particular animosity toward women who were intimate with abusive partners.”  \nMatter of A-B-, 27 I.&N. Dec. at 339.  But whether or not the persecutors target female domestic \npartners of other men is irrelevant.  The persecutor abuses his wife or partner specifically because \nshe is his subordinate domestic partner and he can, with the approval of society (be it tacit or overt), \nexercise authority over her.  That he does not abuse women over whom he does not perceive \nhimself to have the same authority and control does not suggest that the abuse is not on account of \nthe victim’s status as his subordinate domestic partner.  Cf. Matter of S-A-, 22 I. & N. Dec. 1328, \n1336 (B.I.A. 2000) (Islamic father persecuted daughter on account of her liberal beliefs, even \nthough there was no evidence that he would persecute liberal daughters of other fathers).  This \npoint was made well in Matter of R-A-, where an analogy was drawn to a slave owner who beats \nhis own slave but has neither the inclination nor the opportunity to beat his neighbor’s slave.  It \nwould still be reasonable under such circumstances to conclude that the beating was on account of \nthe victim’s status as a slave.  See DHS R-A- Brief at 34.   \nIV.  RAISING  THE  CREDIBLE  FEAR  THRESHOLD  RUNS  COUNTER  TO \nINTERNATIONAL LAW \nUNHCR recognizes “that national procedures for the determination of refugee status may \nusefully include [a] special provision for dealing in an expeditious manner with applications” that \nare “clearly abusive” or “manifestly unfounded.”  UNHCR Exec. Comm.,  The Problem of \nManifestly Unfounded or Abusive Applications for Refugee Status or Asylum No. 30 (XXXIV) \n22 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 84   Filed 10/03/18   Page 33 of 36\n \n(1983, revised 2009) (“UNHCR Exec. Comm., Manifestly Unfounded or Abusive Applications”).46  \nHowever, any such procedures must, taking into account “the grave consequences of an erroneous \ndecision,” be “accompanied by appropriate procedural guarantees.”  Id.  “[T]he criteria for making \n. . . a determination should be defined in such a way that no application will be treated as manifestly \nunfounded or abusive unless its fraudulent character or its lack of any connection with the relevant \ncriteria is truly free from doubt.”  UNHCR, Follow-up on Earlier Conclusions of the Sub-\nCommittee on the Determination of Refugee Status with Regard to the Problem of Manifestly \nUnfounded  or  Abusive  Applications  ¶  19,  U.N.  Doc.  EC/SCP/29  (Aug.  26,  1983).47    The \nunderlying  purpose  behind  such  procedural  provisions  is  to  safeguard  non-refoulement,  a \nfoundational principle of the 1951 Convention and recognized as a norm of customary international \nlaw.  UNHCR, Declaration of States Parties to the 1951 Convention and Its 1967 Protocol \nRelating to the Status of Refugees ¶ 4 (Jan. 16, 2002).48   \nCongress established the credible fear screening process to comport with non-refoulement.  \nIn the course of enacting the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of \n1996  (“IIRIRA”),  Congressman  Henry  Hyde  emphasized  that  expedited  removal  would  be \naccompanied by “major safeguards”—most notably the credible fear process—that would protect \n“against returning persons who meet the refugee definition to conditions of persecution.”  142 \nCong. Rec. H11071, H11081 (daily ed. Sept. 25, 1996).  Other representatives echoed this \nsentiment.  See 142 Cong. Rec. H11054, H11066–67 (daily ed. Sept. 25, 1996) (“It is . . . important \n. . . that the process be fair [and] . . . not result in sending genuine refugees back to persecution.”).   \n                                                 \n46 http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/excom/exconc/3ae68c6118/problem-manifestly-unfounded-\nabusive-applications-refugee-status-asylum.html. \n47 http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/excom/scip/3ae68cd30/follow-up-earlier-conclusions-sub-\ncommittee-determination-refugee-status.html. \n48 http://www.refworld.org/docid/3d60f5557.html. \n23 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 84   Filed 10/03/18   Page 34 of 36\n \nCase law and statutory text further confirm that “credible fear” is an intentionally low \nthreshold, which seeks only to extricate claims that clearly lack merit.  See, e.g., Inspection and \nExpedited Removal of Aliens; Detention and Removal of Aliens; Conduct of Removal Proceedings; \nAsylum Procedures, 62 Fed. Reg. 10312, 10320 (Mar. 6, 1997) (“The credible fear standard sets a \nlow threshold of proof of potential entitlement to asylum.”).  The credible fear interview is “not \ndesigned to elicit all the details of an alien’s claim, but rather only to determine whether there is a \nsignificant possibility that the alien could establish eligibility for asylum.”  Zhang v. Holder, 585 \nF.3d 715, 724 (2d Cir. 2009) (ellipses and internal quotation marks omitted) (citing 8 U.S.C. § \n1225(b)(1)(B)(ii)); see also id. at 718 (“The purpose of this interview is to determine whether you \nmay be eligible for asylum.”) (emphasis added).   \nUnder the new policies, asylum officers “must factor the above standards”—i.e., the \nimpermissibly high standards on “unable or unwilling,” particular social group, and nexus—into \ntheir credible fear determinations.  USCIS Guidance at 9.  Accordingly, “few gang-based or \ndomestic-violence claims involving particular social groups defined by the members’ vulnerability \nto harm [will] . . . pass the ‘significant possibility’ test in credible fear screenings.”  Id. at 10.   \nThis  process  diverges  from  UNHCR’s  view  that,  even  in  expedited  removal,  only \n“manifestly unfounded or abusive” applications should be initially excluded.  UNHCR Exec. \nComm., Manifestly Unfounded or Abusive Applications.  As discussed above, violence by non-\nstate actors—including gang and domestic violence—can, in fact, undergird a valid asylum claim; \nsuch claims are therefore not categorically “manifestly unfounded or abusive.”   \nAlthough the USCIS Guidance notes that asylum officers must “consider the totality of the \ncircumstances” and must bear in mind “whether the alien’s case presents novel or unique issues,” \nUSCIS Guidance at 7, 9, the Guidance provides none of the “appropriate procedural guarantees,” \n24 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 84   Filed 10/03/18   Page 35 of 36\n \nUNHCR Exec. Comm., Manifestly Unfounded or Abusive Applications, to ensure that meritorious \nclaims are heard rather than excluded at the credible fear stage.  The lack of such safeguards \njeopardizes  the  U.S.  commitment  to  non-refoulement,  and  will  only  increase  the  risk  that \nmeritorious asylum seekers are returned to their country of origin.  \nV.  CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, UNHCR submits that the new policies at issue are at variance \nwith the United States’ international obligations under the 1951 Convention and its 1967 Protocol.  \n \n   \nRespectfully submitted,  \n \n   \n/s/  Ana Reyes          \nANA C.

L. No. 96–212, 94 Stat. 102 (1980). \nYears later, Congress amended the immigration laws to provide \nfor expedited removal of those seeking admission to the United \nStates. Under the expedited removal process, an alien could be \nsummarily removed after a preliminary inspection by an \nimmigration officer, so long as the alien did not have a \ncredible fear of persecution by his or her country of origin. In \n1 Pursuant to Rule 25(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \nthe Court substitutes the current Acting Attorney General as the \ndefendant in this case. “Plaintiffs take no position at this \ntime regarding the identity of the current Acting Attorney \nGeneral of the United States.” Civil Statement, ECF No. 101. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 2 of 107\ncreating this framework, Congress struck a balance between an \nefficient immigration system and ensuring that “there should be \nno danger that an alien with a genuine asylum claim will be \nreturned to persecution.” H.R.

A credible fear \nof persecution is defined as a “significant possibility” that \nthe alien “could establish eligibility for asylum.” 8 U.S.C.    \n§ 1225(b)(1)(B)(v).

Dec. \n316 (A.G. 2018).  \nPlaintiffs bring this action against the Attorney General \ninter alia\nalleging violations of,  , the Administrative Procedure \nAct (“APA”) and the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), \n                     \n2 Plaintiffs Grace, Carmen, Gio, Gina, Maria, Mina, Nora, and \nMona are proceeding under pseudonyms. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 3 of 107\nMatter of A-B-\narguing that the standards articulated in  , and a \nsubsequent Policy Memorandum issued by the Department of \nHomeland Security (“DHS”) (collectively “credible fear \npolicies”), unlawfully and arbitrarily imposed a heightened \nstandard to their credible fear determinations.  \nPending before the Court are: (1) plaintiffs’ combined \nmotions for a preliminary injunction and cross-motion for \nsummary judgment; (2) plaintiffs’ motion to consider evidence \noutside the administrative record; (3) the government’s motion \nto strike exhibits supporting plaintiffs’ motion for summary \njudgment; and (4) the government’s motion for summary judgment. \nUpon consideration of the parties’ memoranda, the parties’ \namici 3\narguments at the motions hearings, the arguments of  ,  the \nadministrative record, the applicable law, and for the reasons \ndiscussed below, the Court finds that several of the new \nMatter of A-B-\ncredible fear policies, as articulated in   and the \nPolicy Memorandum, violate both the APA and INA. As explained in \nthis Memorandum Opinion, many of these policies are inconsistent \nwith the intent of Congress as articulated in the INA. And \nbecause it is the will of Congress—not the whims of the \nExecutive—that determines the standard for expedited removal, \nthe Court finds that those policies are unlawful.  \n                     \n3 The Court appreciates the illuminating analysis provided by the \namici\n. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 4 of 107\nPart I of this Opinion sets forth background information \nnecessary to resolve plaintiffs’ claims. In Part II, the Court \nconsiders plaintiffs’ motion to consider evidence outside the \nadministrative record and denies the motion in part. In Part \nIII, the Court considers the parties’ cross-motions for summary \njudgment. In Part III.A, the Court considers the government’s \narguments that this case is not justiciable and holds that this \nCourt has jurisdiction to hear plaintiffs’ challenges to the \ncredible fear policies. In Part III.B, the Court addresses the \nlegal standards that govern plaintiffs’ claims. In Part III.C, \nthe Court turns to the merits of plaintiffs’ claims and holds \nthat, with the exception of two policies, the new credible fear \npolicies are arbitrary, capricious, and in violation of the \nimmigration laws. In Part III.D, the Court considers the \nappropriate form of relief and vacates the unlawful credible \nfear policies. The Court further permanently enjoins the \ngovernment from continuing to apply those policies and from \nremoving plaintiffs who are currently in the United States \nwithout first providing credible fear determinations consistent \nwith the immigration laws. Finally, the Court orders the \ngovernment to return to the United States the plaintiffs who \nwere unlawfully deported and to provide them with new credible \nfear determinations consistent with the immigration laws. \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 5 of 107\n \nI. Background    \nBecause the claims in this action center on the expedited \nremoval procedures, the Court discusses those procedures, and \nthe related asylum laws, in detail.  \n \nA. Statutory and Regulatory Background  \n \nThe Refugee Act \nIn 1980, Congress passed the Refugee Act, Pub. L. No. 96-\n212, 94 Stat. 102, which amended the INA, Pub. L. No. 82-414, 66 \nStat. 163 (1952)(codified as amended in sections of 8 U.S.C.). \nThe “motivation for the enactment of the Refugee Act” was the \n“United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees \nINS v. Cardoza-Fonseca\n[“Protocol”],”  , 480 U.S. 421, 424 (1987), \nid.\n“to which the United States had been bound since 1968,”   at \n432–33. Congress was clear that its intent in promulgating the \nRefugee Act was to bring the United States’ domestic laws in \nSee id.   \nline with the Protocol.  at 437 (stating it is “clear \nfrom the legislative history of the new definition of ‘refugee,’ \nand indeed the entire 1980 Act . . . that one of Congress’ \nprimary purposes was to bring United States refugee law into \nconformance with the [Protocol].”). The Board of Immigration \nAppeals (“BIA”), has also recognized that Congress’ intent in \nenacting the Refugee Act was to align domestic refugee law with \nthe United States’ obligations under the Protocol, to give \nstatutory meaning to “our national commitment to human rights \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 6 of 107\nand humanitarian concerns,” and “to afford a generous standard \nIn Re S-P-\nfor protection in cases of doubt.”  , 21 I. & N. Dec. \n486, 492 (B.I.A. 1998)(quoting S. REP. NO. 256, 96th Cong., 2d \nSess. 1, 4, reprinted in 1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. 141, 144).  \nThe Refugee Act created a statutory procedure for refugees \nseeking asylum and established the standards for granting such \nrequests; the INA currently governs that procedure. The INA \ngives the Attorney General discretion to grant asylum to \nremovable aliens. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(A). However, that relief \nId.\ncan only be granted if the alien is a “refugee.”   The term \n“refugee” is defined as: \n[A]ny  person  who  is  outside  any  country  of \nsuch person's nationality or, in the case of \na person having no nationality, is outside any \ncountry in which such person last habitually \nresided,  and  who  is  unable  or  unwilling  to \nreturn to, and is unable or unwilling to avail \nhimself or herself of the protection of, that \ncountry  because  of  persecution  or  a  well-\nfounded  fear  of  persecution  on  account  of \nrace, religion, nationality, membership in a \nparticular social group, or political opinion. \n \n8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A). “Thus, the ‘persecution or well-\nfounded fear of persecution’ standard governs the Attorney \nGeneral’s determination [of] whether an alien is eligible for \nCardoza-Fonseca\nasylum.”  , 480 U.S. at 428. To establish refugee \nstatus, the alien must show he or she is someone who: (1) has \nsuffered persecution (or has a well-founded fear of persecution) \n(2) on account of (3) one of five specific protected grounds: \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 7 of 107\nrace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social \nSee\ngroup, or political opinion.   8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A). An \nalien fearing harm by non-governmental actors is eligible for \nasylum if the other criteria are met, and the government is \nMatter of \n“unable or unwilling to control” the persecutor. \nAcosta overruled on other \n, 19 I. & N. Dec. 211, 222 (BIA 1985) \ngrounds  Matter of Mogharrabi\nby  , 19 I. & N. Dec. 439 (BIA 1987). \n \nExpedited Removal Process \nBefore seeking asylum through the procedures outlined \nabove, however, many aliens are subject to a streamlined removal \nprocess called “expedited removal.” 8 U.S.C. § 1225. Prior to \n1996, every person who sought admission into the United States \nwas entitled to a full hearing before an immigration judge, and \nSee Am.\nhad a right to administrative and judicial review.     \nImmigration Lawyers Ass'n v. Reno\n, 18 F. Supp. 2d 38, 41 (D.D.C. \n1998)(describing prior system for removal). The Illegal \nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 \n(“IIRIRA”) amended the INA to provide for a summary removal \nprocess for adjudicating the claims of aliens who arrive in the \nUnited States without proper documentation. As described in the \nIIRIRA Conference Report, the purpose of the expedited removal \nprocedure  \nis  to  expedite  the  removal  from  the  United \nStates  of  aliens  who  indisputably  have  no \nauthorization to be admitted . . . , while \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 8 of 107\nproviding an opportunity for such an alien who \nclaims asylum to have the merits of his or her \nclaim promptly assessed by officers with full \nprofessional training in adjudicating asylum \nclaims. \n \nH.R. REP. NO. 104–828, at 209–10 (1996)(“Conf. Rep.”). \n \nConsistent with that purpose, Congress carved out an \nexception to the expedited removal process for individuals with \nSee\na “credible fear of persecution.”   8 U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii). If an alien “indicates either an intention \nto apply for asylum . . . or a fear of persecution,” the alien \nmust be referred for an interview with a U.S. Citizenship and \nId. \nImmigration Services (“USCIS”) asylum officer. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii). During this interview, the asylum officer \nis required to “elicit all relevant and useful information \nbearing on whether the applicant has a credible fear of \npersecution or torture[.]” 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(d). The asylum \nofficer must “conduct the interview in a nonadversarial manner.” \nId.\n  \nExpediting the removal process, however, risks sending \nindividuals who are potentially eligible for asylum to their \nrespective home countries where they face a real threat, or have \na credible fear of persecution. Understanding this risk, \nCongress intended the credible fear determinations to be \nSee\ngoverned by a low screening standard.   142 CONG. REC. S11491-02 \n(“The credible fear standard . . . is intended to be a low \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 9 of 107\nscreening standard for admission into the usual full asylum \nsee also \nprocess”);  H.R. REP. NO. 104-469, pt. 1, at 158 \n(1996)(stating “there should be no danger that an alien with a \ngenuine asylum claim will be returned to persecution”). A \ncredible fear is defined as a “significant possibility, taking \ninto account the credibility of the statements made by the alien \nin support of the alien’s claim and such other facts as are \nknown to the officer, that the alien could establish eligibility \nfor asylum.” 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v).  \nIf, after a credible fear interview, the asylum officer \nfinds that the alien does have a “credible fear of persecution” \nthe alien is taken out of the expedited removal process and \nreferred to a standard removal hearing before an immigration \nSee\njudge.   8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii), (v). At that hearing, \nthe alien has the opportunity to develop a full record with \nrespect to his or her asylum claim, and may appeal an adverse \ndecision to the BIA, 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(f), and then, if \nsee \nnecessary, to a federal court of appeals,  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(a)-(b). \nIf the asylum officer renders a negative credible fear \ndetermination, the alien may request a review of that \ndetermination by an immigration judge. 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(III). The immigration judge’s decision is \n“final and may not be appealed” 8 C.F.R. § 1208.30(g)(2)(iv)(A), \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 10 of 107\nSee\nexcept in limited circumstances.   8 U.S.C. § 1252(e). \n \nJudicial Review \nSection 1252 delineates the scope of judicial review of \nexpedited removal orders and limits judicial review of orders \nissued pursuant to negative credible fear determinations to a \nSee\nfew enumerated circumstances.   8 U.S.C. § 1252(a). The \nsection provides that “no court shall have jurisdiction to \nreview . . . the application of [section 1225(b)(1)] to \nindividual aliens, including the [credible fear] determination \nmade under section 1225(b)(1)(B).” 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(a)(2)(A)(iii). Moreover, except as provided in section \n1252(e), the statute prohibits courts from reviewing: (1) “any \nindividual determination or to entertain any other cause or \nclaim arising from or relating to the implementation or \noperation of an [expedited removal] order;” (2) “a decision by \nthe Attorney General to invoke” the expedited removal regime; \nand (3) the “procedures and policies adopted by the Attorney \nId.\nGeneral to implement the provisions of section 1225(b)(1).”   \n§ 1252(a)(2)(A)(i), (ii) & (iv). \nSection 1252(e) provides for judicial review of two types \nof challenges to removal orders pursuant to credible fear \ndeterminations. The first is a habeas corpus proceeding limited \nto reviewing whether the petitioner was erroneously removed \nbecause he or she was, among other things, lawfully admitted for \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 11 of 107\npermanent residence, or had previously been granted asylum. \n8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(2)(C). As relevant here, the second \nproceeding available for judicial review is a systemic challenge \nto the legality of a “written policy directive, written policy \nguideline, or written procedure issued by or under the authority \nof the Attorney General to implement” the expedited removal \nId.\nprocess.   § 1252(e)(3)(A)(ii). Jurisdiction to review such a \nsystemic challenge is vested solely in the United States \nId.\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia.    \n§ 1252(e)(3)(A). \n \nB. Executive Guidance on Asylum Claims \n \nPrecedential Decision \nThe Attorney General has the statutory and regulatory \nauthority to make determinations and rulings with respect to \nSee, e.g.\nimmigration law.    , 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(1). This \nauthority includes the ability to certify cases for his or her \nSee\nreview and to issue binding decisions.   8 C.F.R. \n§§ 1003.1(g)-(h)(1)(ii). \nOn June 11, 2018, then-Attorney General Sessions did \nexactly that when he issued a precedential decision in an asylum \nMatter of A-B- Matter \ncase,  , 27 I. & N. Dec. 316 (A.G. 2018). In \nof A-B-\n, the Attorney General reversed a grant of asylum to a \nSalvadoran woman who allegedly fled several years of domestic \nId.\nviolence at the hands of her then-husband.   at 321, 346.  \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 12 of 107\nMatter of A-\nThe decision began by overruling another case, \nR-C-G- Id. A-R-C-G-\n, 27 I. & N. Dec. 388 (BIA 2014).   at 319. In  , \nthe BIA recognized “married women in Guatemala who are unable to \nleave their relationship” as a “particular social group” within \nthe meaning of the asylum statute. 27 I. & N. Dec. at 392. The \nA-R-C-G-   \nAttorney General’s rationale for overruling  was that it \nincorrectly applied BIA precedent, “assumed its conclusion and \ndid not perform the necessary legal and factual analysis” \nbecause, among other things, the BIA accepted stipulations by \nDHS that the alien was a member of a qualifying particular \nMatter of A-B-, \nsocial group.  27 I. & N. Dec. at 319. In so \ndoing, the Attorney General made clear that “[g]enerally, claims \nby aliens pertaining to domestic violence or gang violence \nperpetrated by non-governmental actors will not qualify for \nid.\nasylum,”   at 320,4 and “[a]ccordingly, few such claims would \nsatisfy the legal standard to determine whether an alien has a \nId.\ncredible fear of persecution.”   at 320 n.1 (citing 8 U.S.C. \n \n§ 1225(b)(1)(B)(v)).\nThe Attorney General next reviewed the history of BIA \nprecedent interpreting the “particular social group” standard \nA-R-C-G-\nand again explained, at length, why   was wrongly \n                     \nMatter of A-B-\n4 Although   discusses gang-related violence at \nMatter of A-B-\nlength, the applicant in   never claimed gang \nId.\nmembers had any involvement in her case.   at 321 (describing \npersecution related to domestic violence). \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 13 of 107\ndecided. In so ruling, the Attorney General articulated legal \nstandards for determining asylum cases based on persecution from \nnon-governmental actors on account of membership in a particular \nsocial group, focusing principally on claims by victims of \ndomestic abuse and gang violence. He specifically stated that \nfew claims pertaining to domestic or gang violence by non-\ngovernmental actors could qualify for asylum or satisfy the \nSee id.\ncredible fear standard.     at 320 n.1.  \nThe Attorney General next focused on the specific elements \nof an asylum claim beginning with the standard for membership in \na “particular social group.” The Attorney General declared that \n“[s]ocial groups defined by their vulnerability to private \ncriminal activity likely lack the particularity required” under \nasylum laws since “broad swaths of society may be susceptible to \nId.\nvictimization.”   at 335.  \nThe Attorney General next examined the persecution \nrequirement, which he described as having three elements: (1) an \nintent to target a belief or characteristic; (2) severe harm; \nand (3) suffering inflicted by the government or by persons the \nId.\ngovernment was unable or unwilling to control.   at 337. With \nrespect to the last element, the Attorney General stated that an \nalien seeking to establish persecution based on the violent \nconduct of a private actor may not solely rely on the \nId.\ngovernment’s difficulty in controlling the violent behavior.   \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 14 of 107\nRather, the alien must show “the government condoned the private \nactions or at least demonstrated a complete helplessness to \nId. \nprotect the victims.”  (citations and internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  \nThe Attorney General concluded with a discussion of the \nrequirement that an asylum applicant demonstrate that the \npersecution he or she suffered was on account of a membership in \nId.\na “particular social group.”   at 338–39. He explained that \n“[i]f the ill-treatment [claimed by an alien] was motivated by \nsomething other than” one of the five statutory grounds for \nasylum, then the alien “cannot be considered a refugee for \nId.\npurpose of asylum.”   at 338 (citations omitted). He continued \nto explain that when private actors inflict violence based on \npersonal relationships with a victim, the victim’s membership in \na particular social group “may well not be ‘one central reason’ \nId. Matter of A-R-C-G-\nfor the abuse.”   Using   as an example, the \nAttorney General stated that there was no evidence that the \nalien was attacked because her husband was aware of, and hostile \nto, her particular social group: women who were unable to leave \nId.\ntheir relationship.   at 338-39. The Attorney General remanded \nthe matter back to the immigration judge for further proceedings \nId.\nconsistent with his decision.   at 346. \n \n \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 15 of 107\n \nPolicy Memorandum \nMatter of A-B-\nTwo days after the Attorney General issued  , \nUSCIS issued Interim Guidance instructing asylum officers to \nMatter of A-B-\napply   to credible fear determinations.

Dec. 316 \n(A.G. 2018) (“Interim Guidance”), ECF No. 100 at 15–18.5 On July \n11, 2018, USCIS issued final guidance to asylum officers for use \nin assessing asylum claims and credible fear determinations in \nMatter of A-B-\nlight of  .

The \nPolicy Memorandum further acknowledges that “[a]lthough the \nMatter of A-B-\nalien in   claimed asylum and withholding of \nremoval, the Attorney General’s decision and this [Policy \nMemorandum] apply also to refugee status adjudications and \n                     \n5 When citing electronic filings throughout this Memorandum \nOpinion, the Court cites to the ECF header page number, not the \noriginal page number of the filed docket. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 16 of 107\nId.\nreasonable fear and credible fear determinations.”   n.1 \n(citations omitted). \nThe Policy Memorandum also adopts the standard for \nMatter of A-B-\n“persecution” set by  : In cases of alleged \npersecution by private actors, aliens must demonstrate the \n“government is unwilling or unable to control” the harm “such \nthat the government either ‘condoned the behavior or \ndemonstrated a complete helplessness to protect the victim.’” \nId.  Matter of A-B-  \nat 5 (citing  , 27 I. & N. Dec. at 337). After \nexplaining the “condoned or complete helplessness” standard, the \nPolicy Memorandum explains that:  \n \nIn  general,  in  light  of  the  [standards \ngoverning  persecution  by  a  non-government \nactor],  claims  based  on  membership  in  a \nputative particular social group defined by \nthe members’ vulnerability to harm of domestic \nviolence or gang violence committed by non-\ngovernment actors will not establish the basis \nfor asylum, refugee status, or a credible or \nreasonable fear of persecution.  \n \nId.\n at 9 (emphasis in original).  \n \nFurthermore, the Policy Memorandum made clear that because \nMatter of A-B- \n“explained the standards for eligibility for \nasylum . . . based on a particular social group . . . if an \napplicant claims asylum based on membership in a particular \nsocial group, then officers must factor [the standards explained \nMatter of A-B-\nin  ] into their determination of whether an \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 17 of 107\nId.\napplicant has a credible fear . . . of persecution.”   at 12 \n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  \nThe Policy Memorandum includes two additional directives \nMatter of A-B-\nnot found in  . First, it instructs asylum officers \nto apply the “case law of the relevant federal circuit court, to \nMatter of \nthe extent that those cases are not inconsistent with \nA-B- Id.\n.”   at 11. Second, although acknowledging that the \n“relevant federal circuit court is the circuit where the removal \nwill take place\nproceedings     if the officer makes a positive \ncredible fear or reasonable fear determination,” the Policy \nMemorandum instructs asylum officers to “apply precedents of the \nBoard, and, if necessary, the circuit where the alien is \nphysically located Id. \n during the credible fear interview.”  at \n11–12. (emphasis added). \nThe Policy Memorandum concludes with the directive that \n“[asylum officers] should be alert that under the standards \nMatter of A-B-\nclarified in  , few gang-based or domestic-violence \nclaims involving particular social groups defined by the \nmembers’ vulnerability to harm may . . . pass the ‘significant \nId.\nprobability’ test in credible-fear screenings.”   at 13.  \n \nC.

Plaintiffs are now subject to \nfinal orders of removal or were removed pursuant to such orders \nprior to commencing this suit.8 \nFacing imminent deportation, plaintiffs filed a motion for \npreliminary injunction, ECF No. 10, and an emergency motion for \nstay of removal, ECF No. 11, on August 7, 2018. In their motion \nfor stay of removal, plaintiffs sought emergency relief because \ntwo of the plaintiffs, Carmen and her daughter J.A.C.F., were \n“subject to imminent removal.” ECF No. 11 at 1. \nThe Court granted the motion for emergency relief as to the \nplaintiffs not yet deported.

These exhibits include: (1) declarations from \nplaintiffs; (2) declarations from experts pertaining to whether \nthe credible fear policies are new; (3) government training \nmanuals, memoranda, and a government brief; (4) third-party \ncountry reports or declarations; (5) various newspaper articles; \nand (6) public statements from government officials. Pls.’ Evid. \nMot., ECF No. 66-1 at 7–16.

Legal Standard\n“[I]t is black-letter administrative law that in an APA \ncase, a reviewing court ‘should have before it neither more nor \nless information than did the agency when it made its \n21 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 22 of 107\nHill Dermaceuticals, Inc. v.

This is\nbecause, under the APA, the court is confined to reviewing “the\nwhole record or those parts of it cited by a party,” 5 U.S.C.\n§ 706, and the administrative record only includes the\n“materials ‘compiled’ by the agency that were ‘before the agency\nJames Madison Ltd. by Hecht\nat the time the decision was made,’” \nv. Ludwig\n, 82 F.3d 1085, 1095 (D.C.

Wildlands v. Kempthorne\ndeparture from th[e] general rule.”  , \n530 F.3d 991, 1002 (D.C. Cir. 2008)(citation omitted). Aa court \nmay appropriately consider extra-record materials: (1) if the \nagency “deliberately or negligently excluded documents that may \nhave been adverse to its decision,” (2) if background \ninformation is needed to “determine whether the agency \nconsidered all of the relevant factors,” or (3) if the agency \n“failed to explain [the] administrative action so as to \nId.\nfrustrate judicial review.”   \nPlaintiffs make three arguments as to why the Court should \n22 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 23 of 107\nconsider their proffered extra-record materials: (1) to evaluate \nwhether the government’s challenged policies are an \nimpermissible departure from prior policies; (2) to consider \nplaintiffs’ due process cause of action9; and (3) to evaluate \nplaintiffs’ request for permanent injunctive relief. Pls.’ Evid. \nMot., ECF No. 66-1 at 2–12. The Court considers each argument in \nturn. \n \nB. Analysis  \n \nEvidence of Prior Policies  \nPlaintiffs first argue that the Court should consider \nevidence of the government’s prior policies as relevant to \nMatter of A-B-\ndetermining whether the policies in   and the \nsubsequent guidance deviated from prior policies without \nId\nexplanation.  . at 8–11.

Plaintiffs argue that the credible fear \npolicies are departures from prior government policies, which \nthe government changed without explanation. Pls.’ Evid. Mot., \nECF No. 66-1 at 7–11. The government’s response is the credible \nfear policies are not a departure because they do not articulate \nSee\nany new rules.   Defs.’ Mot., ECF No. 57-1 at 17. Whether the \ncredible fear policies are new is clearly an “unresolved factual \nissue” that the “administrative record, on its own, . . . is not \nSee United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v. \nsufficient to resolve.” \nDevos\n, 237 F. Supp. 3d 1, 6 (D.D.C. 2017). The Court cannot \nanalyze this argument without reviewing the prior policies, \nwhich are not included in the administrative record. Under these \ncircumstances, it is “appropriate to resort to extra-record \nId.\ninformation to enable judicial review to become effective.”   \nEsch v.

However, the \ngovernment disagrees with the types of documents that are \nId.\nconsidered past policies.   According to the government, the \nonly “past policies” at issue are legal decisions issued by the \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 25 of 107\nId. \nAttorney General, BIA, or courts of appeals.  The Court is \nnot persuaded by such a narrow interpretation of the evidence \nSee Leadership \nthat can be considered as past policies. \nConference on Civil Rights v. Gonzales\n, 404 F. Supp. 2d 246, 255 \n(D.D.C. 2005)(finding training manual distributed as informal \nguidance “at a minimum” reflected the policy of the “Elections \nCrimes Branch if not the Department of Justice”).  \nAdmitting third party-declarations from a retired immigration \nofficer and former immigration judge, on the other hand, are not \nnecessary for the Court in its review. Declarations submitted by \nthird-parties regarding putative policy changes would stretch \nthe limited extra-record exception too far. Accordingly, the \nCourt will not consider these declarations when determining \nwhether the credible fear policies constitute an unexplained \nchange of position.  \n \nEvidence Supporting Injunctive Relief  \nThe second category of information plaintiffs ask the Court \nto consider is extra-record evidence in support of their claim \nthat injunctive relief is appropriate. Pls.’ Evid. Mot., ECF No. \n66-1 at 13–16.

Defs.’ Mot. to Strike, ECF No. 88-1 at 12 n.1. \nThe Court concurs, but nevertheless must determine if plaintiffs \nare entitled to a permanent injunction, assuming they prevail on \ntheir APA and INA claims. Because plaintiffs request specific \ninjunctive relief with respect to their expedited removal orders \nand credible fear proceedings, the Court must determine whether \nSee Eco \nplaintiffs are entitled to the injunctive relief sought.   \nTour Adventures, Inc. v. Zinke\n, 249 F. Supp. 3d 360, 370, n.7 \n(D.D.C. 2017)(“it will often be necessary for a court to take \nnew evidence to fully evaluate” claims “of irreparable harm . . \n. and [claims] that the issuance of the injunction is in the \npublic interest.”)(citation omitted). Thus, the Court will \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 27 of 107\nconsider plaintiffs’ declarations, the UNHCR reports, and the \ncountry reports only to the extent they are relevant to \nplaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief.10 \nIn sum, the Court will consider extra-record evidence only to \nthe extent it is relevant to plaintiffs’ contentions that the \ngovernment deviated from prior policies without explanation or \nto their request for injunctive relief. The Court will not \nconsider any evidence related to plaintiffs’ due process claim. \nAccordingly, the Court will not consider the following \ndocuments: (1) evidence related to the opinions of immigration \njudges and attorneys, Second Mujahid Decl., ECF No. 64-4, Exs. \n8–9, 14–17 and ECF No. 64-5; (2) statements of various public \nofficials, Second Mujahid Decl., ECF No. 64-4, Exs. 4–7; and      \n(3) various newspaper articles, Mujahid Decl., ECF No. 10-3, \nExs.

The \nparties agree that to the extent jurisdiction exists to review a \nchallenge to a policy implementing the expedited removal system, \nit exists pursuant to subsection (e) of the statute.  \nUnder section 1252(a)(2)(A), no court shall have \njurisdiction over “procedures and policies adopted by the \nAttorney General to implement the provisions of section \n1225(b)(1)” except “as provided in subsection [1252](e).” \nSection 1252(e)(3) vests exclusive jurisdiction in the United \nStates District Court for the District of Columbia to review \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 29 of 107\n“[c]hallenges [to the] validity of the [expedited removal] \nId.\nsystem.”   § 1252(e)(3)(A).

They also include challenges \nclaiming that a given regulation or written policy directive, \nId.\nguideline, or procedure is inconsistent with law.   § \n1252(e)(3)(A)(ii).

Supp. 2d at 47 (holding that “the 60–day \nrequirement is jurisdictional rather than a traditional \nlimitations period”). \n Both parties agree that the plain language of section \n1252(e)(3) is dispositive. It reads as follows:  \n(3) Challenges on validity of the system \n \n(A) In general \n \nJudicial  review  of  determinations  under \nsection  1225(b)  of  this  title  and  its \nimplementation  is  available  in  an  action \ninstituted in the United States District Court \nfor  the  District  of  Columbia,  but  shall  be \nlimited to determinations of-- \n \n(i) whether such section, or any regulation \nissued  to  implement  such  section,  is \nconstitutional; or \n \n(ii) whether such a regulation, or a written \npolicy directive, written policy guideline, or \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 30 of 107\nwritten  procedure  issued  by  or  under  the \nauthority of the Attorney General to implement \nsuch  section,  is  not  consistent  with \napplicable provisions of this subchapter or is \notherwise in violation of law. \n \n8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3). \n \nMatter of A-B-\nThe government first argues that   does not \nimplement section 1225(b), as required by section 1252(e)(3). \nDefs.’ Mot., ECF No. 57-1 at 30–32. Instead, the government \nMatter of A-B-\ncontends   was a decision about petitions for \nId.\nasylum under section 1158.   The government also argues that \nMatter of A-B-\n is not a written policy directive under the Act, \nbut rather an adjudication that determined the rights and duties \nId.\nof the parties to a dispute.   at 32.  \nMatter of A-B-\nThe government’s argument that   does not \nMatter of A-B-\n“implement” section 1225(b) is belied by   itself. \nAlthough A-B- sought asylum, the Attorney General’s decision \nwent beyond her claims explicitly addressing “the legal standard \nto determine whether an alien has a credible fear of \nMatter of A-B-\npersecution” under 8 U.S.C. section 1225(b).  , 27 \nI. & N. Dec. at 320 n.1 (citing standard for credible fear \ndeterminations). In the decision, the Attorney General \narticulated the general rule that claims by aliens pertaining to \nMatter of A-B-\neither domestic violence, like the claim in  , or \nMatter of \ngang violence, a hypothetical scenario not at issue in \nA-B-\n, would likely not satisfy the credible fear determination \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 31 of 107\nId. \nstandard.  (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)). Because the Attorney \nGeneral cited section 1225(b) and the standard for credible fear \ndeterminations when articulating the new general legal standard, \nMatter of A-B-\nthe Court finds that   implements section 1225(b) \nwithin the meaning of section 1252(e)(3).  \nMatter of A-B- s\nThe government also argues that, despite  ’  \nexplicit invocation of section 1225 and articulation of the \nMatter of A-B-\ncredible fear determination standard,   is an \n“adjudication” not a “policy,” and therefore section 1252(e)(3) \ndoes not apply. Defs.’ Mot., ECF No. 57-1 at 32–34. However, it \nis well-settled that an “administrative agency can, of course, \nKidd \nmake legal-policy through rulemaking or by adjudication.” \nCommc’ns v. F.C.C. SEC v. \n, 427 F.3d 1, 5 (D.C. Cir. 2005)(citing \nChenery Corp\n., 332 U.S. 194, 202–03 (1947)). Moreover, “[w]hen \nan agency does [make policy] by adjudication, because it is a \npolicymaking institution unlike a court, its dicta can represent \nan articulation of its policy, to which it must adhere or \nId Matter of A-B-\nadequately explain deviations.”  . at 5.   is a \nsweeping opinion in which the Attorney General made clear that \nasylum officers must apply the standards set forth to subsequent \nSee NRLB v. Wyman Gordon Co\ncredible fear determinations.  ., 394 \nU.S. 759, 765 (1969)(“Adjudicated cases may and do, of course, \nserve as vehicles for the formulation of agency policies, which \nare applied and announced therein.”).  \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 32 of 107\nIndeed, it is difficult to reconcile the government’s \nMatter of A-B-\nargument with the language in  : “When confronted \nwith asylum cases based on purported membership in a particular \nimmigration judges asylum officers \nsocial group, the Board,  , and \nmust analyze the requirements as set forth in this opinion,\n   \nelaborates upon\nwhich restates and where appropriate,  , the \nrequirements [for asylum].” 27 I. & N. Dec. at 319 (emphasis \nadded). This proclamation, coupled with the directive to asylum \nofficers that claims based on domestic or gang-related violence \ngenerally would not “satisfy the standard to determine whether \nid.\nan alien has a credible fear of persecution,”   at 320 n.1, is \nclearly a “written policy directive” or “written policy \nMatter of A-B- \nguidance” sufficient to bring  under the ambit of \nSee Kidd\nsection 1252(e)(3).    , 427 F.3d at 5 (stating agency can \n“make legal-policy through rulemaking or by adjudication”). \nMatter of A-B- See \nIndeed, one court has regarded   as such. \nMoncada v.

Oct. 5, \nMatter of A-B- substantial \n2018)(characterizing   as providing “\nnew guidance\n on the viability of asylum ‘claims by aliens \npertaining to . . . gang violence’”)(emphasis added)(citation \nomitted).  \nThe government also argues that because the DHS Secretary, \nrather than the Attorney General, is responsible for \nimplementing most of the provisions in section 1225, the \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 33 of 107\nAttorney General lacks the requisite authority to implement \nsection 1225. Defs.’ Reply, ECF No. 85 at 25. Therefore, the \nMatter of A-B-\ngovernment argues,   cannot be “issued by or under \nthe authority of the Attorney General to implement [section \nSee\n1225(b)]” as required by the statute.   8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(e)(3)(A)(ii). The government fails to acknowledge, \nhowever, that the immigration judges who review negative \nMatter \ncredible fear determinations are also required to apply \nof A-B-  \n. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.30(g)(2); 8 C.F.R. § 103.10(b)(stating \ndecisions of the Attorney General shall be binding on \nimmigration judges). And it is the Attorney General who is \nSee, e.g.\nresponsible for the conduct of immigration judges.  , 8 \nU.S.C. § 1101(b)(4)(“An immigration judge shall be subject to \nsuch supervision and shall perform such duties as the Attorney \nGeneral shall prescribe.”). Therefore, the Attorney General \nclearly plays a significant role in the credible fear \ndetermination process and has the authority to “implement” \nsection 1225.  \nFinally, the Court recognizes that even if the \njurisdictional issue was a close call, which it is not, several \nprinciples persuade the Court that jurisdiction exists to hear \nplaintiffs’ claims. First, there is the “familiar proposition \nthat only upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence of a \ncontrary legislative intent should the courts restrict access to \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 34 of 107\nBd. of Governors of the Fed. Reserve Sys. v. \njudicial review.” \nMCorp. Fin., Inc.\n, 502 U.S. 32, 44 (1991)(citations and internal \nquotation marks omitted). Here, there is no clear and convincing \nevidence of legislative intent in section 1252 that Congress \nintended to limit judicial review of the plaintiffs’ claims. To \nthe contrary, Congress has explicitly provided this Court with \njurisdiction to review systemic challenges to section 1225(b). \nSee\n 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3). \nSecond, there is also a “strong presumption in favor of \nINS v. St. Cyr\njudicial review of administrative action.”  , 533 \nU.S. 289, 298 (2001). As the Supreme Court has recently \nexplained, “legal lapses and violations occur, and especially so \nwhen they have no consequence. That is why [courts have for] so \nlong applied a strong presumption favoring judicial review of \nWeyerhaeuser Co. v. United States Fish \nadministrative action.” \nand Wildlife Servs., \n586 U.S. __,__ (2018)(slip op., at 11). \nPlaintiffs challenge the credible fear policies under the APA \nand therefore this “strong presumption” applies in this case.  \nThird, statutory ambiguities in immigration laws are \nSee Cardoza–Fonseca\nresolved in favor of the alien.  , 480 U.S. at \n449. Here, any doubt as to whether 1252(e)(3) applies to \nplaintiffs’ claims should be resolved in favor of plaintiffs. \nSee INS v. Errico\n, 385 U.S. 214, 225 (1966)(“Even if there were \nsome doubt as to the correct construction of the statute, the \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 35 of 107\ndoubt should be resolved in favor of the alien.”).  \nIn view of these three principles, and the foregoing \nanalysis, the Court concludes that section 1252(a)(2)(A) does \nnot eliminate this Court's jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ claims, \nand that section 1252(e)(3) affirmatively grants jurisdiction. \nb. Policy Memorandum \nThe government also argues that the Court lacks \njurisdiction to review the Policy Memorandum under section \n1252(e) for three reasons. First, according to the government, \nthe Policy Memorandum “primarily addresses the asylum standard” \nand therefore does not implement section 1225(b) as required by \nthe statute. Defs.’ Reply, ECF No. 85 at 30. Second, since the \nMatter of A-B-\nPolicy Memorandum “merely explains”  , the \ngovernment argues, it is not reviewable for the same reasons \nMatter of A-B- Id.\n is not reviewable.   Finally, the government \nargues that sections 1225 and 1252(e)(3) “indicate” that \nCongress only provided judicial review of agency guidelines, \ndirectives, or procedures which create substantive rights as \nopposed to interpretive documents, like the Policy Memorandum, \nId.\nwhich merely explain the law to government officials.   at 31–\n33.  \nThe Court need not spend much time on the government’s \nfirst two arguments. First, the Policy Memorandum, entitled \n“Guidance for Processing Reasonable Fear, Credible Fear, Asylum, \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 36 of 107\nMatter of A-B-\nand Refugee Claims in Accordance with  ” expressly \napplies to credible fear interviews and provides guidance to \ncredible fear adjudicators. Policy Memorandum, ECF No. 100 at 4 \nn.1 (“[T]he Attorney General’s decision and this [Policy \nMemorandum] apply also to . . . credible fear determinations.”). \nFurthermore, it expressly invokes section 1225 as the authority \nId. \nfor its issuance.  at 4. The government’s second argument \nthat the Policy Memorandum is not reviewable for the same \nMatter of A-B-\nreasons   is not, is easily dismissed because the \nMatter of A-B-\nCourt has already found that   falls within section \nSee supra,\n1252(e)(3)’s jurisdictional grant.     at 27-38.  \nThe government’s third argument is that section 1252(e)(3) \nonly applies when an agency promulgates legislative rules and \nnot interpretive rules. Defs.’ Reply, ECF No. 85 at 30–33. \nAlthough not entirely clear, the argument is as follows: (1) the \nINA provides DHS with significant authority to create \nlegislative rules; (2) Congress barred judicial review of such \nsubstantive rules in section 1252(a); (3) therefore Congress \nmust have created a mechanism to review these types of \nlegislative rules, and only legislative rules, in section \nId. \n1252(e)(3)).  at 30–31. Folded into this reasoning is also a \nfree-standing argument that because the Policy Memorandum is not \nId.\na final agency action, it is not reviewable under the APA.   \nat 32.  \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 37 of 107\nContrary to the government’s assertions, section 1252(e)(3) \ndoes not limit its grant of jurisdiction over a “written policy \ndirective, written policy guideline, or written procedure” to \nonly legislative rules or final agency action. Nowhere in the \nCf.\nstatute did Congress exclude interpretive rules.   5 U.S.C. \n§ 553(b)(3)(A)(stating subsection of statute does not apply to \n“interpretative rules, general statements of policy, or rules of \nagency organization, procedure, or practice.”). Rather, Congress \nused broader terms such as policy “guidelines,” “directives,” or \n“procedures” which do not require notice and comment rulemaking \nSee\nor other strict procedural prerequisites.   8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(e)(3). There is no suggestion that Congress limited the \napplication of section 1252(e)(3) to only claims involving \nlegislative rules or final agency action, and this Court will \nSee \nnot read requirements into the statute that do not exist. \nKeene Corp. v. U.S.\n, 508 U.S. 200, 208 (1993)(stating courts \nhave a “duty to refrain from reading a phrase into the statute \nwhen Congress has left it out”).  \nIn sum, section 1252(a)(2)(A) is not a bar to this Court's \njurisdiction because plaintiffs’ claims fall well within section \nMatter of A-B-\n1252(e)(3)’s grant of jurisdiction. Both   and the \nPolicy Memorandum expressly reference credible fear \ndeterminations in applying the standards articulated by the \nMatter of A-B-\nAttorney General. Because   and the Policy \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 38 of 107\nMemorandum are written policy directives and guidelines issued \nby or under the authority of the Attorney General, section \n1252(e)(3) applies, and this Court has jurisdiction to hear \nplaintiffs’ challenges to the credible fear policies.  \n \nPlaintiffs have Standing to Challenge the Policy \nMemorandum \n \nThe government next challenges plaintiffs’ standing to \nbring this suit with respect to their claims against the Policy \nMemorandum only. Defs.’ Mot., ECF No. 57-1 at 35–39. To \nestablish standing, a plaintiff “must, generally speaking, \ndemonstrate that he has suffered ‘injury in fact,’ that the \ninjury is ‘fairly traceable’ to the actions of the defendant, \nand that the injury will likely be redressed by a favorable \nBennett v. Spear\ndecision.”  , 520 U.S. 154, 162 (1997)(citing \nLujan v. Defs. of Wildlife Valley \n, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992); \nForge Christian Coll. v. Ams. United for Separation of Church \nand State, Inc.\n, 454 U.S. 464, 471–72 (1982)). Standing is \nassessed “upon the facts as they exist at the time the complaint \n” Natural Law Party of U.S. v. Fed. Elec. Comm'n\nis filed. , 111 \nF. Supp. 2d 33, 41 (D.D.C. 2000). \nAs a preliminary matter, the government argues that \nplaintiffs lack standing to challenge any of the policies in the \nMatter of A-B-\nPolicy Memorandum that rest on   because the Court \nMatter of A-B- See\ndoes not have jurisdiction to review  .   Defs.’ \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 39 of 107\nMot., ECF No. 57-1 at 35, 37–39. Therefore, the government \nargues, plaintiffs’ injuries would not be redressable or \nMatter \ntraceable to the Policy Memorandum since they stem from \nof A-B-  \n. This argument fails because the Court has found that it \nMatter \nhas jurisdiction to review plaintiffs’ claims related to \nof A-B-  See supra\nunder 1252(e)(3).    , at 27-38. \nThe government also argues that because plaintiffs do not \nhave a legally protected interest in the Policy Memorandum—an \ninterpretive document that creates no rights or obligations— \nplaintiffs do not have an injury in fact. Defs.’ Reply, ECF No. \n85 at 33. The government’s argument misses the point. Plaintiffs \ndo not seek to enforce a right under a prior policy or \nSee\ninterpretive guidance.   Pls.’ Reply, ECF No. 92 at 17–18. \nRather, they challenge the validity of their credible fear \ndeterminations pursuant to the credible fear policies set forth \nMatter of A-B-\nin   and the Policy Memorandum. Because the \ncredible fear policies impermissibly raise their burden and deny \nplaintiffs a fair opportunity to seek asylum and escape the \npersecution they have suffered, plaintiffs argue, the policies \nSee id.\nviolate the APA and immigration laws.   \nThe government also argues that even if the Court has \njurisdiction, all the claims, with the exception of one, are \ntime-barred and therefore not redressable. Defs.’ Mot., ECF No. \n57-1 at 39–41. The government argues that none of the policies \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 40 of 107\nare in fact new and each pre-date the sixty days in which \nId.\nplaintiffs are statutorily required to bring their claims.   \nat 39–41. The government lists each challenged policy and relies \non existing precedent purporting to apply the same standard \nSee id.\nespoused in the Policy Memorandum prior to its issuance.     \nat 39–41. The challenge in accepting this theory of standing is \nthat it would require the Court to also accept the government’s \ntheory of the case: that the credible fear policies are not \n“new.” In other words, the government’s argument “assumes that \nDefs. of \nits view on the merits of the case will prevail.” \nWildlife v. Gutierrez\n, 532 F.3d 913, 924 (D.C. Cir. 2008). This \nis problematic because “in reviewing the standing question, the \ncourt must be careful not to decide the questions on the merits \nfor or against the plaintiff, and must therefore assume that on \nthe merits the plaintiffs would be successful in their claims.” \nCity of Waukesha v. EPA\n, 320 F.3d 228, 235 (D.C. Cir. \n2003)(citations omitted). \nWhether the credible fear policies differ from the \nstandards articulated in the pre-policy cases cited by the \ngovernment, and are therefore new, is a contested issue in this \ncase. And when assessing standing, this Court must “be careful \nnot to decide the questions on the merits” either “for or \nagainst” plaintiffs, “and must therefore assume that on the \nId.\nmerits the plaintiffs would be successful in their claims.”   \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 41 of 107\nInstead, the Court must determine whether an order can redress \nGutierrez\nplaintiffs’ injuries in whole or part.  , 532 F.3d at \n925. There is no question that the challenged policies impacted \nSee\nplaintiffs.   Defs.’ Mot., ECF No. 57-1 at 28 (stating an \n“asylum officer reviewed each of [plaintiffs] credible fear \nMatter of A-B-\nclaims and found them wanting in light of  ”). \nThere is also no question that an order from this Court \ndeclaring the policies unlawful and enjoining their use would \nSee Carpenters Indus. Council v. Zinke,\nredress those injuries.   \n854 F.3d 1, 6 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 2017)(stating when government \nactions cause an injury, enjoining that action will usually \nredress the injury).  \nBecause plaintiffs have demonstrated that they have:     \n(1) suffered an injury; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to \nthe credible fear policies; and (3) action by the Court can \nredress their injuries, plaintiffs have standing to challenge \nthe Policy Memorandum. Therefore, the Court may proceed to the \nmerits of plaintiffs’ claims. \n \nB. Legal Standard for Plaintiffs’ Claims \nAlthough both parties have moved for summary judgment, the \nparties seek review of an administrative decision under the APA. \nSee\n 5 U.S.C. § 706. Therefore, the standard articulated in \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 is inapplicable because the \nCourt has a more limited role in reviewing the administrative \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 42 of 107\n Wilhelmus v. Geren\nrecord. , 796 F. Supp. 2d 157, 160 (D.D.C. \n2011)(internal citation omitted). “[T]he function of the \ndistrict court is to determine whether or not as a matter of law \nthe evidence in the administrative record permitted the agency \nSee Sierra Club v. Mainella\nto make the decision it did.”  , 459 \nF. Supp. 2d 76, 90 (D.D.C. 2006)(internal quotation marks and \ncitations omitted). “Summary judgment thus serves as the \nmechanism for deciding, as a matter of law, whether the agency \naction is supported by the administrative record and otherwise \nWilhelmus\nconsistent with the APA standard of review.”  , 796 F. \nSupp. 2d at 160 (internal citation omitted).  \nPlaintiffs bring this challenge to the alleged new credible \nfear policies arguing they violate the APA and INA. Two \nseparate, but overlapping, standards of APA review govern the \nresolution of plaintiffs’ claims. First, under 5 U.S.C. § \n706(2)(a), agency action must not be “arbitrary, capricious, an \nabuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” \nTo survive an arbitrary and capricious challenge, an agency \nFox v. \naction must be “the product of reasoned decisionmaking.” \nClinton\n, 684 F.3d 67, 74–75 (D.C. Cir. 2012). The reasoned \ndecisionmaking requirement applies to judicial review of agency \nId.\nadjudicatory actions.   at 75. A court must not uphold an \nadjudicatory action when the agency’s judgment “was neither \nadequately explained in its decision nor supported by agency \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 43 of 107\nId. Siegel v. SEC\nprecedent.”   (citing  , 592 F.3d 147, 164 (D.C. \nMatter of A-B- \nCir. 2010)). Thus, review of  requires this Court \nto determine whether the decision was the product of reasoned \nSee id.\ndecisionmaking.   at 75.  \nSecond, plaintiffs’ claims also require this Court to \nconsider the degree to which the government’s interpretation of \nMatter of A-B-\nthe various relevant statutory provisions in   is \nafforded deference. The parties disagree over whether this Court \nis required to defer to the agency’s interpretations of the \nstatutory provisions in this case. “Although balancing the \nnecessary respect for an agency’s knowledge, expertise, and \nconstitutional office with the courts’ role as interpreter of \nChevron\nlaws can be a delicate matter,” the familiar   framework \nId. Gonzales v. Oregon\noffers guidance.   at 75 (citing  , 546 U.S. \n243, 255 (2006)). \nIn reviewing an agency's interpretation of a statute it is \ncharged with administering, a court must apply the framework of \nChevron USA, Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.\n, \nSee Halverson v. Slater\n467 U.S. 837 (1984).  , 129 F.3d 180, 184 \nChevron\n(D.C. Cir. 1997). Under the familiar   two-step test, the \nfirst step is to ask “whether Congress has directly spoken to \nthe precise question at issue. If the intent of Congress is \nclear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as \nthe agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 44 of 107\nChevron\nintent of Congress.”  , 467 U.S. at 842–43. In making that \ndetermination, the reviewing court “must first exhaust the \n‘traditional tools of statutory construction’ to determine \nwhether Congress has spoken to the precise question at issue.” \nNatural Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. Daley\n, 209 F.3d 747, 572 \n(2000)(citation omitted). The traditional tools of statutory \nconstruction include “examination of the statute’s text, \nlegislative history, and structure . . . as well as its \nId.\npurpose.”   (internal citations omitted). If these tools lead \nto a clear result, “then Congress has expressed its intention as \nId. \nto the question, and deference is not appropriate.”   \nIf a court finds that the statute is silent or ambiguous \nwith respect to a particular issue, then Congress has not spoken \nclearly on the subject and a court is required to proceed to the \nChevron Chevron\nsecond step of the   framework.  , 467 U.S. at 843. \nChevron\nUnder   step two, a court’s task is to determine if the \nagency’s approach is “based on a permissible construction of the \nId.\nstatute.”   To make that determination, a court again employs \nthe traditional tools of statutory interpretation, including \nSee \nreviewing the text, structure, and purpose of the statute. \nTroy Corp. v. Browder\n, 120 F.3d 277, 285 (D.C. Cir. 1997)(noting \nthat an agency’s interpretation must “be reasonable and \nconsistent with the statutory purpose”). Ultimately, “[n]o \nmatter how it is framed, the question a court faces when \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 45 of 107\nconfronted with an agency's interpretation of a statute it \nadministers is always, simply, whether the agency has stayed \nDistrict of \nwithin the bounds of its statutory authority.” \nColumbia v. Dep’t of Labor\n, 819 F.3d 444, 459 (D.C. Cir. \n2016)(citation omitted).  \nThe scope of review under both the APA’s arbitrary and \nChevron\ncapricious standard and   step two are concededly narrow. \nSee Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. \nAuto. Ins. Co.\n, 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(stating “scope of review \nunder the ‘arbitrary and capricious’ standard is narrow and a \ncourt is not to substitute its judgment for that of the \nsee also Judulang v. Holder\nagency”);    , 565 U.S. 42, 52 n.7 \nChevron\n(2011)(stating the   step two analysis overlaps with \narbitrary and capricious review under the APA because under \nChevron\n step two a court asks “whether an agency interpretation \nis ‘arbitrary or capricious in substance’”). Although this \nreview is deferential, “courts retain a role, and an important \none, in ensuring that agencies have engaged in reasoned decision \nJudulang, see also Daley\nmaking.”   565 U.S. at 53;  , 209 F.3d at \n755 (stating that although a court owes deference to agency \ndecisions, courts do not hear cases “merely to rubber stamp \nagency actions”).  \nWith these principles in mind, the Court now turns to \nplaintiffs’ claims that various credible fear policies based on \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 46 of 107\nMatter of A-B-\n, the Policy Memorandum, or both, are arbitrary \nand capricious and in violation of the immigration laws. \n \nC. APA and Statutory Claims \nPlaintiffs challenge the following alleged new credible \nfear policies: (1) a general rule against credible fear claims \nrelated to domestic or gang-related violence; (2) a heightened \nstandard for persecution involving non-governmental actors; (3) \na new rule for the nexus requirement in asylum; (4) a new rule \nthat “particular social group” definitions based on claims of \ndomestic violence are impermissibly circular; (5) the \nrequirements that an alien articulate an exact delineation of \nthe specific “particular social group” at the credible fear \ndetermination stage and that asylum officers apply discretionary \nfactors at that stage; and (6) the Policy Memorandum’s \nrequirement that adjudicators ignore circuit court precedent \nMatter of A-B-\nthat is inconsistent with  , and apply the law of \nthe circuit where the credible fear interview takes place. The \nCourt addresses each challenged policy in turn. \n \n1. The General Rule Foreclosing Domestic Violence and \nGang-Related Claims Violates the APA and Immigration \nLaws \n \nPlaintiffs argue that the credible fear policies establish \nan unlawful general rule against asylum petitions by aliens with \ncredible fear claims relating to domestic and gang violence. \nPls.’ Mot., ECF No. 64-1 at 28.  \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 47 of 107\nChevron\nA threshold issue is whether the   framework applies \nto this issue at all. “Not every agency interpretation of a \nChevron Alabama Educ. \nstatute is appropriately analyzed under  .” \nAss’n v. Chao\n, 455 F.3d 386, 392 (D.C. Cir. 2006). The \ngovernment acknowledges that the alleged new credible fear \nChevron \npolicies are not “entitled to blanket  deference.” Defs.’ \nReply, ECF No. 85 at 39 (emphasis in original). Rather, \naccording to the government, the Attorney General is entitled to \nChevron ambiguous\n deference when he “interprets any   statutory \nId.\nterms in the INA.”   (emphasis in original). The government \nChevron\nalso argues that the Attorney General is entitled to   \nMatter of A-B-\ndeference to the extent   states “long-standing \nprecedent or interpret[s] prior agency cases or regulations \nId.\nthrough case-by-case adjudication.”   at 40.  \nMatter of A-B-\nTo the extent   was interpreting the \nChevron\n“particular social group” requirement in the INA, the   \nframework clearly applies. The Supreme Court has explained that \nChevron\n“[i]t is clear that principles of   deference are \napplicable” to the INA because that statute charges the Attorney \nGeneral with administering and enforcing the statutory scheme. \nI.N.S. v. Aguirre-Aguirre\n, 526 U.S. 415, 424–25 (quoting \nChevron\n8 U.S.C. §§ 1103(a)(1), 1253(h)). In addition to   \ndeference, a court must also afford deference to an agency when \nU.S. Telecom Ass’n v. \nit is interpreting its own precedent. \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 48 of 107\nF.C.C.\n, 295 F.3d 1326, 1332 (D.C. Cir. 2002)(“We [] defer to an \nagency’s reasonable interpretation of its own rules and \nprecedents.”).  \nIn this case, the Attorney General interpreted a provision \nof the INA, a statute that Congress charged the Attorney General \nSee Matter of A-B-\nwith administering.   8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(1).   \naddressed the issue of whether an alien applying for asylum \nbased on domestic violence could establish membership in a \n“particular social group.” Because the decision interpreted a \nChevron Matter of \nprovision of the INA, the   framework applies to \nA-B- See Negusie v. Holder\n.11    , 555 U.S. 511, 516 (2009)(stating \nChevron\nit “is well settled” that principles of   deference apply \nto the Attorney General’s interpretation of the INA).  \n Chevron\na.  Step One: The Phrase “Particular Social \nGroup” is Ambiguous \n \nChevron\nThe first question within the   framework is whether, \nusing the traditional tools of statutory interpretation \nincluding evaluating the text, structure, and the overall \n                     \nChevron\n11 The Policy Memorandum is not subject to   deference. The \nSupreme Court has warned that agency “[i]nterpretations such as \nthose in opinion letters—like interpretations contained in \npolicy statements\n, agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines, \nChevron\nall of which lack the force of law—do not warrant  -style \nChristensen v. Harris Cnty\ndeference.”  , 529 U.S. 576, 587 \n(2000). Rather, interpretations contained in such formats “are \nentitled to respect . . . only to the extent that those \nId.\ninterpretations have the power to persuade.”   (citations \nomitted).  \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 49 of 107\nstatutory scheme, as well as employing common sense, Congress \nhas “supplied a clear and unambiguous answer to the interpretive \nPereira v. Sessions\nquestion at hand.”  , 138 S. Ct. 2105, 2113 \n(2018)(citation omitted). The interpretive question at hand in \nthis case is the meaning of the term “particular social group.”  \n Under the applicable asylum provision, an “alien who is \nphysically present in the United States or who arrives in the \nUnited States . . . irrespective of such alien’s status” may be \ngranted asylum at the discretion of the Attorney General if the \n“Attorney General determines that such alien is a refugee within \nthe meaning of section 1101(a)(42)(A).” 8 U.S.C. § 1158. The \nterm “refugee” is defined in section 1101(a)(42)(A) as, among \nother things, an alien who is unable or unwilling to return to \nhis or her home country “because of persecution or a well-\nfounded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, \nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or \npolitical opinion.” 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A). At the credible \nfear stage, an alien needs to show that there is a “significant \npossibility . . . that the alien could establish eligibility for \nasylum.” 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v).  \nThe INA itself does not shed much light on the meaning of \nthe term “particular social group.” The phrase “particular \nsocial group” was first included in the INA when Congress \nenacted the Refugee Act of 1980. Pub. L. No. 96-212, 94 Stat. \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 50 of 107\n102 (1980). The purpose of the Refugee Act was to protect \nrefugees, i.e., individuals who are unable to protect themselves \nSee id.\nfrom persecution in their native country.   § 101(a)(“The \nCongress declares that it is the historic policy of the United \nStates to respond to the urgent needs of persons subject to \npersecution in their homelands, including . . . humanitarian \nassistance for their care and maintenance in asylum areas.”). \nWhile the legislative history of the Act does not reveal the \nspecific meaning the members of Congress attached to the phrase \n“particular social group,” the legislative history does make \nclear that Congress intended “to bring United States refugee law \ninto conformance with the [Protocol], 19 U.S.T. 6223, T.I.A.S. \nCardoza-\nNo. 6577, to which the United States acceded in 1968.” \nFonseca\n, 480 U.S. at 436-37. Indeed, when Congress accepted the \ndefinition of “refugee” it did so “with the understanding that \nit is based directly upon the language of the Protocol and it is \nintended that the provision be construed consistent with the \nId.\nProtocol.”   at 437 (citations omitted). It is therefore \nappropriate to consider what the phrase “particular social \nSee id.\ngroup” means under the Protocol.   \nIn interpreting the Refugee Act in accordance with the \nmeaning intended by the Protocol, the language in the Act should \nbe read consistently with the United Nations’ interpretation of \nSee id. \nthe refugee standards.  at 438–39 (relying on UNHCR’s \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 51 of 107\ninterpretation in interpreting the Protocol’s definition of \n“well-founded fear”). The UNHCR defined the provisions of the \nConvention and Protocol in its Handbook on Procedures and \nId.\nCriteria for Determining Refugee Status (“UNHCR Handbook”).12   \nAs the Supreme Court has noted, the UNHCR Handbook provides \n“significant guidance in construing the Protocol, to which \nCongress sought to conform . . . [and] has been widely \nconsidered useful in giving content to the obligations that the \nId.\nprotocol establishes.”   at 439 n.22 (citations omitted). The \nUNHCR Handbook codified the United Nations’ interpretation of \nthe term “particular social group” at that time, construing the \nterm expansively.

Therefore, the Court proceeds to   step \ntwo to determine whether the Attorney General’s interpretation, \nwhich generally precludes domestic violence and gang-related \nclaims at the credible fear stage, is a permissible \ninterpretation of the statute. \n \n \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 53 of 107\n Chevron\nb.

Finally, the government argues that \nCongress designed the asylum statute as a form of limited \nId.\nrelief, not to “provide redress for all misfortune.”    \nMatter of A-B-\nThe Court is not persuaded that   and the \nPolicy Memorandum do not create a general rule against positive \ncredible fear determinations in cases in which aliens claim a \nfear of persecution based on domestic or gang-related violence. \nMatter of A-B-\n mandates that “[w]hen confronted with asylum \ncases based on purported membership in a particular social group \n. . . immigration judges, and asylum officers must analyze the \nrequirements as set forth” in the decision. 27 I. & N.

First, the \ngeneral rule is arbitrary and capricious because there is no \nlegal basis for an effective categorical ban on domestic \nviolence and gang-related claims. Second, such a general rule \nruns contrary to the individualized analysis required by the \nINA. Under the current immigration laws, the credible fear \ninterviewer must prepare a case-specific factually intensive \nSee\nanalysis for each alien.   8 C.F.R. § 208.30(e)(requiring \nindividual analysis including material facts stated by the \napplicant, and additional facts relied upon by officer). \nCredible fear determinations, like requests for asylum in \ngeneral, must be resolved based on the particular facts and \nId.\ncircumstances of each case.    \nA general rule that effectively bars the claims based on \ncertain categories of persecutors (i.e. domestic abusers or gang \nmembers) or claims related to certain kinds of violence is \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 57 of 107\ninconsistent with Congress' intent to bring “United States \nCardoza-\nrefugee law into conformance with the [Protocol].” \nFonseca\n, 480 U.S. at 436-37. The new general rule is thus \ncontrary to the Refugee Act and the INA.13 In interpreting \n“particular social group” in a way that results in a general \nrule, in violation of the requirements of the statute, the \nAttorney General has failed to “stay[] within the bounds” of his \nDistrict of Columbia v.

The relevant provisions \nrequire that the asylum officer “conduct the interview in a \nnonadversarial manner” and “elicit all relevant and useful \ninformation bearing on whether the applicant has a credible fear \nof persecution or torture.” 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(d). As plaintiffs \npoint out, to prevail at a credible fear interview, the alien \nneed only show a “significant possibility” of a one in ten \nSee\nchance of persecution, i.e., a fraction of ten percent.   \nCardoza-Fonseca\n8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v);  , 480 U.S. at 439–40 \n(describing a well-founded fear of persecution at asylum stage \nto be satisfied even when there is a ten percent chance of \npersecution).

The Attorney General’s directive to \nbroadly exclude groups of aliens based on a sweeping policy \napplied indiscriminately at the credible fear stage, was neither \nadequately explained nor supported by agency precedent. \nAccordingly, the general rule against domestic violence and \n58 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 59 of 107\ngang-related claims during a credible fear determination is \narbitrary and capricious and violates the immigration laws. \n \n2. Persecution: The “Condoned or Complete Helplessness” \nStandard Violates the APA and Immigration Laws \n \nPlaintiffs next argue that the government’s credible fear \npolicies have heightened the legal requirement for all credible \nfear claims involving non-governmental persecutors. Pls.’ Mot., \nECF No. 64-1 at 48.  \nTo be eligible for asylum, an alien must demonstrate either \npast “persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution.” \n8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A). When a private actor, rather than the \ngovernment itself, is alleged to be the persecutor, the alien \nmust demonstrate “some connection” between the actions of the \nSee Rosales \nprivate actor and “governmental action or inaction.” \nJusto v. Sessions\n, 895 F.3d 154, 162 (1st Cir. 2018). To \nestablish this connection, a petitioner must show that the \ngovernment was either “unwilling or unable” to protect him or \nSee Burbiene v. Holder\nher from persecution.    , 568 F.3d 251, 255 \n(1st Cir. 2009). \nMatter of A-B-\nPlaintiffs argue that   and the Policy \nMemorandum set forth a new, heightened standard for government \ninvolvement by requiring an alien to “show the government \ncondoned the private actions or at least demonstrated a complete \nMatter of A-B-\nhelplessness to protect the victim.”  , 27 I. & N. \n59 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 60 of 107\nDec. at 337; Policy Memorandum, ECF No. 100 at 9. The government \nargues that the “condone” or “complete helplessness” standard is \nnot a new definition of persecution; and, in any event, such \nlanguage does not change the standard. Defs.’ Reply, ECF No. 85 \nat 55.  \n Chevron\na.  Step One: The Term “Persecution” is Not \nAmbiguous15 \n \nChevron\nAgain, the first question under the   framework is \nwhether Congress has “supplied a clear and unambiguous answer to \nPereira\nthe interpretive question at hand.”  , 138 S. Ct. at 2113. \nHere, the interpretive question at hand is whether the word \n“persecution” in the INA requires a government to condone the \npersecution or demonstrate a complete helplessness to protect \nthe victim.  \nThe Court concludes that the term “persecution” is not \nambiguous and the government’s new interpretation is \ninconsistent with the INA. The Court is guided by the \nlongstanding principle that Congress is presumed to have \nincorporated prior administrative and judicial interpretations \nof language in a statute when it uses the same language in a \nSee Sekhar v. United States\nsubsequent enactment.  , 570 U.S. 729, \n733 (2013)(explaining that “if a word is obviously transplanted \n                     \n15 Because the government is interpreting a provision of the INA, \nChevron\nthe   framework applies.  \n60 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 61 of 107\nfrom another legal source, whether the common law or other \nLorillard v. \nlegislation, it brings the old soil with it”); \nPons\n, 434 U.S. 575, 580 (1978)(stating Congress is aware of \ninterpretations of a statute and is presumed to adopt them when \nit re-enacts them without change). \nThe seminal case on the interpretation of the term \nMatter of Acosta\n“persecution,”  , 19 I. & N. Dec. 211 (BIA 1985), \nMatter of Acosta\nis dispositive. In  , the BIA recognized that \nharms could constitute persecution if they were inflicted \n“either by the government of a country or by persons or an \norganization that the government was unable or unwilling to \nId.\ncontrol.”   at 222 (citations omitted). The BIA noted that \nCongress carried forward the term “persecution” from pre-1980 \nstatutes, in which it had a well-settled judicial and \nadministrative meaning: “harm or suffering . . . inflicted \neither by the government of a country or by persons or an \norganization that the government was unable or unwilling to \nId.\ncontrol.”   Applying the basic rule of statutory construction \nthat Congress carries forward established meanings of terms, the \nId.\nBIA adopted the same definition.   at 223.  \nThe Court agrees with this approach. When Congress uses a \nterm with a settled meaning, its intent is clear for purposes of \nChevron  cf. B & H Med., LLC v. United States\nstep one.  , 116 Fed. \nCl. 671, 685 (2014)(a term with a “judicially settled meaning” \n61 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 62 of 107\nAuer v. \nis “not ambiguous” for purposes of deference under \nRobbins Matter of Acosta\n, 519 U.S. 452 (1997)). As explained in  , \nCongress adopted the “unable or unwilling” standard when it used \nthe word “persecution” in the Refugee Act. 19 I. & N. Dec. at \nsee also Shapiro v. United States\n222,    , 335 U.S. 1, 16 \n(1948)(Congress presumed to have incorporated “settled judicial \nconstruction” of statutory language through re-enactment). \nIndeed, the UNHCR Handbook stated that persecution included \n“serious discriminatory or other offensive acts . . . committed \nby the local populace . . . if they are knowingly tolerated by \nthe authorities, or if the authorities refuse, or prove unable, \neffective See\nto offer   protection.”   UNHCR Handbook ¶ 65 \n(emphasis added). It was clear at the time that the Act was \npassed by Congress that the “unwilling or unable” standard did \nnot require a showing that the government “condoned” persecution \nor was “completely helpless” to prevent it. Therefore, the \ngovernment’s interpretation of the term “persecution” to mean \nthe government must condone or demonstrate complete helplessness \nChevron\nto help victims of persecution fails at   step one.  \nThe government relies on circuit precedent that has used \nthe “condoned” or “complete helplessness” language to support \nits argument that the standard is not new. Defs.’ Reply, ECF No. \n85 at 55. There are several problems with the government’s \nargument. First, upon review of the cited cases it is apparent \n62 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 63 of 107\nthat, although the word “condone” was used, in actuality, the \ncourts were applying the “unwilling or unable” standard. For \nGalina v. INS\nexample, in  , 213 F.3d 955 (7th Cir. 2005), an \nasylum applicant was abducted and received threatening phone \nId.\ncalls in her native country.   at 957. The applicant’s husband \ncalled the police to report the threatening phone calls, and \nafter the police located one of the callers, the calls stopped. \nId.\n The Court recognized that a finding of persecution \nordinarily requires a determination that the government condones \nthe violence or demonstrated a complete helplessness to protect \nId.\nthe victims.   at 958. However, relying on the BIA findings, \nthe Court found that notwithstanding the fact “police might take \nsome action against telephone threats” the applicant would still \nface persecution if she was sent back to her country of origin \nId\nbecause she could have been killed.  . Therefore, the Court \nultimately concluded that an applicant can still meet the \npersecution threshold when the police are unable to provide \nId.\neffective help, but fall short of condoning the persecution.   \nat 958. Despite the language it used to describe the standard, \nthe court did not apply the heightened “condoned or complete \nhelplessness” persecution standard pronounced in the credible \nfear policies here. \nSecond, and more importantly, under the government’s \nformulation of the persecution standard, no asylum applicant who \n63 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 64 of 107\nreceived assistance from the government, regardless of how \nineffective that assistance was, could meet the persecution \nSee\nrequirement when the persecutor is a non-government actor.16   \nPolicy Memorandum, ECF No. 100 at 17 (stating that in the \ncontext of credible fear interviews, “[a]gain, the home \ngovernment must either condone the behavior or demonstrate a \ncomplete helplessness to protect victims of such alleged \npersecution”). That is simply not the law. For example, in \nRosales Justo v. Sessions\n, the United States Court of Appeals \nfor the First Circuit held that a petitioner satisfied the \n“unable or unwilling” standard, even though there was a \nsignificant police response to the claimed persecution. 895 F.3d \nRosales Justo\n154, 159 (1st Cir. 2018). The petitioner in     fled \nId. \nMexico after organized crime members murdered his son.  at \n157–58. Critically, the “police took an immediate and active \nId.\ninterest in the [petitioner’s] son's murder.”   The Court \nnoted that the petitioner “observed seven officers and a \nforensic team at the scene where [the] body was recovered, the \npolice took statements from [petitioner] and his wife, and an \n                     \n16 The Court notes that this persecution requirement applies to \nall asylum claims not just claims based on membership in a \n“particular social group” or claims related to domestic or gang-\nSee Matter of A-B-\nrelated violence.  , 27 I. & N. Dec. at 337 \n(describing elements of persecution). Therefore, such a \nformulation heightens the standard for every asylum applicant \nwho goes through the credibility determination process.  \n64 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 65 of 107\nId. \nautopsy was performed.”  The Court held that, despite the \nextensive actions taken by the police, the “unwilling or unable” \nstandard was satisfied because although the government was \nwilling to protect the petitioner, the evidence did not show \nthat the government was able to make the petitioner and his \nId.\nfamily any safer.   at 164 (reversing BIA’s conclusion that \nthe immigration judge clearly erred in finding that the police \nRosales Justo\nwere willing but unable to protect family). As   \nillustrates, a requirement that police condone or demonstrate \ncomplete helplessness is inconsistent with the current standards \nunder immigration law.17  \nFurthermore, the Court need not defer to the government’s \ninterpretation to the extent it is based on an interpretation of \ncourt precedent. Indeed, in “case after case, courts have \naffirmed this fairly intuitive principle, that courts need not, \nand should not, defer to agency interpretations of opinions \nCitizens for Responsibility & Ethics in \nwritten by courts.” \n                     \n17 This departure is also wholly unexplained. As the Supreme \nCourt has held, “[u]nexplained inconsistency is . . . a reason \nfor holding an interpretation to be an arbitrary and capricious \nSee Motor Vehicle \nchange from agency practice under the [APA].” \nMfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. \nCo.\n, 463 U.S. 29, 46–57 (1983). The credible fear policies do \nnot acknowledge a change in the persecution standard and are \nSee Fox \nalso arbitrary and capricious for that reason. \nTelevision Stations, Inc.\n, 556 U.S. at 514, 515 (2009)(“[T]he \nrequirement that an agency provide reasoned explanation for its \naction would ordinarily demand that it display awareness that it \nis changing [its] position.”). \n65 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 66 of 107\nWashington v.

Supp. 3d 77, 87 \n(D.D.C. 2016)(listing cases). “There is therefore no reason for \ncourts—the supposed experts in analyzing judicial decisions—to \nUniv. \ndefer to agency interpretations of the Court's opinions.” \nof Great Falls v.

Cir. 2002); \nsee also Judulang  \n, 565 U.S. at 52 n.7 (declining to apply \nChevron\n framework because the challenged agency policy was not \n“an interpretation of any statutory language”).  \nTo the extent the credible fear policies established a new \nstandard for persecution, it did so in purported reliance on \ncircuit opinions. The Court gives no deference to the \ngovernment’s interpretation of judicial opinions regarding the \nproper standard for determining the degree to which government \nUniv. of Great \naction, or inaction, constitutes persecution. \nFalls\n, 278 F.3d at 1341. The “unwilling or unable” persecution \nstandard was settled at the time the Refugee Act was codified, \nand therefore the Attorney General’s “condoned” or “complete \nhelplessness” standard is not a permissible construction of the \npersecution requirement. \n \n3. Nexus: The Credible Fear Policies Do Not Pose a New \nStandard for the Nexus Requirement \n \nPlaintiffs next argue that the formulation of the nexus \nMatter of A-B-\nrequirement articulated in  that when a private \nactor inflicts violence based on a personal relationship with \n66 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 67 of 107\nthe victim, the victim’s membership in a larger group may well \nnot be “one central reason” for the abuse—violates the INA, \nRefugee Act, and APA. The nexus requirement in the INA is that a \nputative refugee establish that he or she was persecuted “on \naccount of” a protected ground such as a particular social \nSee\ngroup.18   8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(i). \nThe parties agree that the precise interpretive issue is \nnot ambiguous. The parties also endorse the “one central reason” \nstandard and the need to conduct a “mixed-motive” analysis when \nSee \nthere is more than one reason for persecution.  Defs.’ Mot., \n57-1 at 47; Pls.’ Mot., ECF No. 64-1 at 53–54. The INA expressly \ncontemplates mixed motives for persecution when it specifies \nthat a protected ground must be “one central reason” for the \npersecution. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(i). Where the parties \ndisagree is whether the credible fear policies deviate from this \nstandard.  \nWith respect to the nexus requirement, the government’s \nMatter of A-B- Matter \nreading of   on this issue is reasonable. In \nof A-B-\n, the Attorney General relies on the “one central reason” \nstandard and provides examples of a criminal gang targeting \npeople because they have money or property or “simply because \n                     \n18 Similar to the Attorney General’s directives related to the \n“unwilling or unable” standard, this directive applies to all \nasylum claims, not just claims related to domestic or gang-\nrelated violence. \n67 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 68 of 107\nthe gang inflicts violence on those who are nearby.” 27 I. & N. \nDec. at 338–39. The decision states that “purely personal” \nId.\ndisputes will not meet the nexus requirement.   at 339 n.10. \nThe Court discerns no distinction between this statement and the \nstatutory “one central reason” standard.  \nSimilarly, the Policy Memorandum states that “when a \nprivate actor inflicts violence based on a personal relationship \nwith the victim, the victim’s membership in a larger group often \nwill not be ‘one central reason’ for the abuse.” Policy \nMatter of A-B-\nMemorandum, ECF No. 100 at 9 (citing  , 27 I. & N. \nDec. at 338–39). Critically, the Policy Memorandum explains that \nin “a particular case, the evidence may establish that a victim \nbased solely \nof domestic violence was attacked  on her \nId.\npreexisting personal relationship with her abuser.”   \n(emphasis added). This statement is no different than the \nMatter of A-B-\nstatement of the law in  . Because the government’s \ninterpretation is not inconsistent with the statute, the Court \nfinds the government’s interpretation to be reasonable.  \nThe Court reiterates that, although the nexus standard \npurely\nforecloses cases in which   personal disputes are the \nimpetus for the persecution, it does not preclude a positive \ncredible fear determination simply because there is a personal \nrelationship between the persecutor and the victim, so long as \nthe one central reason for the persecution is a protected \n68 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 69 of 107\nSee Aldana Ramos v. Holder  \nground.    , 757 F.3d 9, 18–19 (1st Cir. \n2014)(recognizing that “multiple motivations [for persecution] \ncan exist, and that the presence of a non-protected motivation \nQu \ndoes not render an applicant ineligible for refugee status”); \nv.

Circularity: The Policy Memorandum’s Interpretation of \nthe Circularity Requirement Violates the APA and \nImmigration Laws \n \nPlaintiffs argue that the Policy Memorandum establishes a \n69 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 70 of 107\nnew rule that “particular social group” definitions based on \nclaims of domestic violence are impermissibly circular and \ntherefore not cognizable as a basis for persecution in a \ncredible fear determination. Pls.’ Mot., ECF No. 64-1 at 56–59. \nPlaintiffs argue that this new circularity rule is inconsistent \nwith the current legal standard and therefore violates the \nId.\nRefugee Act, INA, and is arbitrary and capricious.19   at 57. \nThe parties agree that the formulation of the anti-circularity \nMatter of M-E-V-G-\nrule set forth in  , 26 I. & N. Dec. 227, 242 \n(BIA 2014)—“that a particular social group cannot be defined \nSee\nexclusively by the claimed persecution”—is correct.   Defs.’ \nReply, ECF No. 85 at 62; Pls.’ Reply., ECF No. 92 at 30–31. \nAccordingly, the Court begins with an explanation of that \nopinion.  \n                     \n19 The government contends that plaintiffs’ argument on this \nissue has evolved from the filing of the complaint to the filing \nof plaintiffs’ cross-motion for summary judgment. Defs.’ Reply, \nECF No. 85 at 61. In plaintiffs’ complaint, they objected to the \ncircularity issue by stating the new credible fear policies \nerroneously conclude “that groups defined in part by the \napplicant’s inability to leave the relationship are \nimpermissibly circular.” ECF No. 54 at 24. In their cross-motion \nfor summary judgment, plaintiffs argue that the government’s \nrule is inconsistent with well-settled law that the circularity \nstandard only applies when the group is defined exclusively by \nthe feared harm. Pls.’ Mot., ECF No. 64-1 at 57. The Court finds \nthat plaintiffs’ complaint was sufficient to meet the notice \nSee 3E Mobile, LLC v. Glob. Cellular, Inc\npleading standard.  ., \n121 F. Supp. 3d 106, 108 (D.D.C. 2015)(explaining that the \nnotice-pleading standard does not require a plaintiff to “plead \nfacts or law that match every element of a legal theory”). \n70 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 71 of 107\nMatter of M-E-V-G-\nThe question before the BIA in  , was \nwhether the respondent had established membership in a \n“particular social group,” namely “Honduran youth who have been \nactively recruited by gangs but who have refused to join because \nthey oppose the gangs.” 26 I. & N. Dec. at 228. The BIA \nclarified that a person seeking asylum on the ground of \nmembership in a particular social group must show that the group \nis: (1) composed of members who share an immutable \ncharacteristic; (2) defined with particularity; and (3) socially \nId.\ndistinct within the society in question.   at 237. In \nexplaining the third element for membership, the BIA confirmed \nthe rule that “a social group cannot be defined exclusively by \nId.\nthe fact that its members have been subjected to harm.”   at \n242. The BIA explained that for a particular social group to be \ndistinct, “persecutory conduct alone cannot define the group.” \nId. \n \nThe BIA provided the instructive example of former \nId.\nemployees of an attorney general.   The BIA noted that such a \ngroup may not be valid for asylum purposes because they may not \nconsider themselves a group, or because society may not consider \nthe employees to be meaningfully distinct in society in general. \nId.\n The BIA made clear, however, that “such a social group \ndetermination must be made on a case-by-case basis, because it \nis possible that under certain circumstances, the society would \n71 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 72 of 107\nmake such a distinction and consider the shared past experience \nId. \nto be a basis for distinction within that society.”  “Upon \ntheir maltreatment,” the BIA explained “it is possible these \npeople would experience a sense of ‘group’ and society would \ndiscern that this group of individuals, who share a common \nimmutable characteristic, is distinct in some significant way.” \nId.\n at 243 (recognizing that “[a] social group cannot be defined \nmerely solely \n by the fact of persecution or  by the shared \ncharacteristic of facing dangers in retaliation for actions they \ntook against alleged persecutors . . . but that the shared trait \nof persecution does not disqualify an otherwise valid social \ngroup”)(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The BIA \nfurther clarified that the “act of persecution by the government \nmay be the catalyst that causes the society to distinguish [a \ngroup] in a meaningful way and consider them a distinct group, \nbut the immutable characteristic of their shared past experience \nId.\nexists independent of the persecution.”   at 243. Thus, such a \ngroup would not be circular because the persecution they faced \nwas not the sole basis for their membership in a particular \nId.\nsocial group.   \nWith this analysis in mind, the Court now focuses on the \nMatter of A-\ndispute at issue. Here, plaintiffs do not challenge \nB-’\ns statements with regard to the rule against circularity, but \nrather challenge the Policy Memorandum’s articulation of the \n72 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 73 of 107\nrule. Pls.’ Mot., ECF No, 64-1 at 57–58. Specifically, they \nchallenge the Policy Memorandum’s mandate that domestic \nviolence-based social groups that include “inability to leave” \nId.\nare not cognizable.   at 58 (citations and internal quotation \nmarks omitted). The Policy Memorandum states that “married women \n. . . who are unable to leave their relationship” are a group \nthat would not be sufficiently particular. Policy Memorandum, \nECF No. 100 at 6. The Policy Memorandum explained that “even if \n‘unable to leave’ were particular, the applicant must show \nsomething more than the danger of harm from an abuser if the \napplicant tried to leave because that would amount to circularly \ndefining the particular social group by the harm on which the \nId. \nasylum claim is based.”   \nThe Policy Memorandum’s interpretation of the rule against \ncircularity ensures that women unable to leave their \nrelationship will always be circular. This conclusion appears to \nbe based on a misinterpretation of the circularity standard and \nMatter of A-B-\nfaulty assumptions about the analysis in  . First, \nMatter of M-E-V-G-\nas   made clear, there cannot be a general rule \nwhen it comes to determining whether a group is distinct because \n“it is possible that under certain circumstances, the society \nwould make such a distinction and consider the shared past \nexperience to be a basis for distinction within that society.” \n26 I. & N. Dec. at 242. Thus, to the extent the Policy \n73 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 74 of 107\nMemorandum imposes a general circularity rule foreclosing such \nclaims without taking into account the independent \ncharacteristics presented in each case, the rule is arbitrary, \ncapricious, and contrary to immigration law. \nSecond, the Policy Memorandum changes the circularity rule \nas articulated in settled caselaw, which recognizes that if the \nproposed social group definition contains characteristics \nindependent from the feared persecution, the group is valid \nMatter of M-E-V-G-, \nunder asylum law.  26 I. & N. Dec. at 242 \n(Particular social group may be cognizable if “immutable \ncharacteristic of their shared past experience exists \nindependent of the persecution.”). Critically, the Policy \nMemorandum does not provide a reasoned explanation for, let \nSee F.C.C. v. Fox Television \nalone acknowledge, the change. \nStations, Inc.\n, 556 U.S. 502, 514 (2009)(“[T]he requirement that \nan agency provide reasoned explanation for its action would \nordinarily demand that it display awareness that it is changing \nMatter of A-B-\n[its] position.”).   criticized the BIA for failing \nMatter of A-R-C-G-\nto consider the question of circularity in     \nand overruled the decision based on the BIA’s reliance on DHS’s \nconcession on the issue. 27 I. & N. Dec. at 334-35, 33. \nMatter of A-B-\nMoreover,   suggested only that the social group at \nMatter of A-R-C-G- Id.\nissue in     might be “effectively” circular.   \nat 335. The Policy Memorandum’s formulation of the circularity \n74 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 75 of 107\nstandard goes well beyond the Attorney General’s explanation in \nMatter of A-B-\n. As such, it is unmoored from the analysis in \nMatter of M-E-V-G- Matter of A-B-\n   and has no basis in  . It is \ntherefore, arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to immigration \nlaw. \n \n5. Discretion and Delineation: The Credible Fear Policies \nDo Not Contain a Discretion Requirement, but the \nPolicy Memorandum’s Delineation Requirement is \nUnlawful \n \nPlaintiffs next argue that the credible fear policies \n“unlawfully import two aspects of the ordinary removal context \ninto credible fear proceedings.” Pls.’ Reply, ECF No. 92 at 32. \nThe first alleged requirement is for aliens to delineate the \n“particular social group” on which they rely at the credible \nId.\nfear stage.   The second alleged requirement is that asylum \nadjudicators at the credible fear stage take into account \ncertain discretionary factors when making a fair credibility \nId. \ndetermination and exercise discretion to deny relief.20  at \n32–33.  \n                     \n20 These discretionary factors include but are not limited to: \n“the circumvention of orderly refugee procedures; whether the \nalien passed through any other countries or arrived in the \nUnited States directly from her country; whether orderly refugee \nprocedures were in fact available to help her in any country she \npassed through; whether he or she made any attempts to seek \nasylum before coming to the United States; the length of time \nthe alien remained in a third country; and his or her living \nconditions, safety, and potential for long-term residency \nthere.” Policy Memorandum, ECF No. 100 at 10.  \n75 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 76 of 107\nThe government agrees that a policy which imposes a duty to \ndelineate a particular social group at the credible fear stage \nwould be a violation of existing law. Defs.’ Reply, ECF No. 85 \nat 67. The government also agrees that requiring asylum officers \nto consider the exercise of discretion at the credible fear \nId.\nstage “would be inconsistent with section 1225(b)(1)(B)(v).”   \nat 68. The government, however, argues that no such directives \nId.\nexist.   at 67–69. \nThe Court agrees with the government. There is nothing in \nthe credible fear policies that support plaintiffs’ arguments \nthat asylum officers are to exercise discretion at the credible \nfear stage. The Policy Memorandum discusses discretion only in \nthe context of when an alien has established that he or she is \neligible for asylum. Policy Memorandum, ECF No. 100 at 5 (“[I]f \neligibility is established, the USCIS officer must then consider \nwhether or not to exercise discretion to grant the \nMatter of A-B-\napplication.”).   also discusses the discretionary \nfactors in the context of granting asylum. 27 I. & N. Dec. at \n345 n.12 (stating exercising discretion should not be glossed \notherwise meets the burden of \nover “solely because an applicant \nproof\n for asylum eligibility under the INA”)(emphasis added). \nEligibility for asylum is not established, nor is an asylum \nSee\napplication granted, at the credible fear stage.   8 U.S.C.    \n§ 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii)(stating if an alien receives a positive \n76 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 77 of 107\ncredibility determination, he or she shall be detained for \n“further consideration of the application of asylum”). Since the \ncredible fear policies only direct officers to use discretion \nonce an officer has determined that an applicant is eligible for \nasylum, they do not direct officers to consider discretionary \nSee\nfactors at the credible fear stage.   Policy Memorandum, ECF \nNo. 100 at 10.  \nMatter of A-B-\nThe Court also agrees that, with respect to  , \nthe decision does not impose a delineation requirement during a \ncredible fear determination. The decision only requires an \napplicant seeking asylum to clearly indicate “an exact \ndelineation of any proposed particular social group” when the \nalien is “on the record and before the immigration judge.” 27 I. \n& N. Dec. at 344. Any delineation requirement therefore would \nnot apply to the credible fear determination which is not on the \nrecord before an immigration judge. \nThe Policy Memorandum, however, goes further than the \ndecision itself and incorporates the delineation requirement \ninto credible fear determinations. Unlike the mandate to use \ndiscretion, the Policy Memorandum does not contain a limitation \nthat officers are to apply the delineation requirement to asylum \ninterviews only, as opposed to credible fear interviews. In \nfact, it does the opposite and explicitly requires asylum \nofficers to apply that requirement to credible fear \n77 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 78 of 107\ndeterminations. Policy Memorandum, ECF No. 100 at 12. The Policy \nMemorandum makes clear that “if an applicant claims asylum based \non membership in a particular social group, then officers must \nMatter of A-B- into their \nfactor the [standards explained in  ] \ndetermination of whether an applicant has a credible fear or \nreasonable fear of persecution Id.\n.”   at 12. In directing asylum \nMatter of A-B-\nofficers to apply   to credible fear \ndeterminations, the Policy Memorandum refers back to all the \nMatter of A-B-\nrequirements explained by   including the \nSee id.\ndelineation requirement.   (referring back to section \nexplaining delineation requirement). In light of this clear \nMatter of A-\ndirective to “factor” in the standards set forth in \nB-\n, into the “determination of whether an applicant has a \ncredible fear” and its reference to the delineation requirement, \nit is clear that the Policy Memorandum incorporates that \nSee id.\nrequirement into credible fear determinations.  21 \nThe government argues, that to the extent the Policy \nMemorandum is ambiguous, the Court should defer to its \n                     \n21 The Policy Memorandum also reiterates that “few gang-based or \ndomestic-violence claims involving particular social groups \ndefined by the members’ vulnerability to harm may . . . pass the \n‘significant possibility’ test in credible-fear screenings.” \nPolicy Memorandum, ECF No. 100 at 10. For this proposition, the \nMatter \nPolicy Memorandum refers to the “standards clarified in \nof A-B- Id.\n.”   This requirement for an alien to explain how they \nfit into a particular social group independent of the harm they \nallege, further supports the fact that there is a delineation \nrequirement at the credible fear stage. \n78 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 79 of 107\ninterpretation as long as it is reasonable. The government cites \nno authority to support its claim that deference is owed to an \nagency’s interpretations of its policy documents like the Policy \nMemorandum. However, the Court acknowledges the government’s \ninterpretation is “entitled to respect . . . only to the extent \nthat those interpretations have the ‘power to persuade.’” \nChristensen v. Harris Cnty\n, 529 U.S. 576, 587 (2000)(citation \nomitted). For the reasons stated above, however, such a narrow \nreading of the Policy Memorandum is not persuasive. Because the \nPolicy Memorandum requires an alien—at the credible fear stage—\nto present facts that clearly identify the alien’s proposed \nparticular social group, contrary to the INA, that policy is \narbitrary and capricious.  \n \n6. The Policy Memorandum’s Requirements Related to Asylum \nOfficer’s Application of Circuit Law are Unlawful \n \nPlaintiffs’ final argument is that the Policy Memorandum’s \ndirectives instructing asylum officers to ignore applicable \ncircuit court of appeals decisions is unlawful. Pls.’ Mot., ECF \nNo. 64-1 at 63.  \nThe relevant section of the Policy Memorandum reads as \nfollows: \nWhen conducting a credible fear or reasonable \nfear  interview,  an  asylum  officer  must \ndetermine what law applies to the applicant’s \nclaim.  The  asylum  officer  should  apply  all \napplicable precedents of the Attorney General \nMatter of E-L-H-\nand the BIA,  , 23 I&N Dec. \n79 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 80 of 107\n814, 819 (BIA 2005), which are binding on all \nimmigration  judges  and  asylum  officers \nnationwide.  The  asylum  officer  should  also \napply  the  case law  of  the  relevant  federal \ncircuit court, to the extent that those cases \nMatter of A-B- See, \nare not inconsistent with  . \ne.g. Matter of Fajardo Espinoza\n,  , 26 I&N Dec. \n603,  606  (BIA  2015).  The  relevant  federal \ncircuit court is the circuit where the removal \nproceedings  will  take  place  if  the  officer \nmakes a positive credible fear determination. \nSee Matter of Gonzalez\n, 16 I&N Dec. 134, 135–\nMatter of Waldei\n36 (BIA 1977);  , 19 I&N Dec. \n189 (BIA 1984). But removal proceedings can \ntake place in any forum selected by DHS, and \nnot necessarily the forum where the intending \nasylum  applicant  is  located  during  the \ncredible fear or reasonable fear interview. \nBecause an asylum officer cannot predict with \ncertainty  where  DHS  will  file  a  Notice  to \nappear  .  .  .  the  asylum  officer  should \nfaithfully apply precedents of the Board and, \nif necessary, the circuit where the alien is \nphysically located during the credible fear \ninterview.  \n \nPolicy Memorandum, ECF No. 100 at 11–12. Plaintiffs make two \nindependent arguments regarding this policy. First, they argue \nthat the Policy Memorandum’s directive to disregard circuit law \nMatter of A-B-\ncontrary to  , violates the APA, INA, and the \nseparation of powers. Pls.’ Mot., ECF No. 64-1 at 64–68. Second, \nplaintiffs argue that the Policy Memorandum’s directive \nrequiring asylum officers to apply the law of the circuit where \nthe alien is physically located during the credible fear \nId.\ninterview violates the APA and INA.   68–71. \n \n80 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 81 of 107\na. The Policy Memorandum’s Directive to Disregard \nBrand X\nContrary Circuit Law Violates   \nPlaintiffs’ first argument is that the Policy Memorandum’s \ndirective that asylum officers who process credible fear \nMatter of A-B-\ninterviews ignore circuit law contrary to   is \nunlawful. Pls.’ Mot., ECF No. 64-1 at 63–68. Because the policy \nrequires officers to disregard all circuit law regardless of \nwhether the provision at issue is entitled to deference, \nplaintiffs maintain that the policy exceeds an agency’s limited \nability to displace circuit precedent on a specific question of \nId.\nlaw to which an agency decision is entitled to deference.    \nAn agency’s ability to disregard a court’s interpretation \nof an ambiguous statutory provision in favor of the agency’s \nNat’l \ninterpretation stems from the Supreme Court’s decision in \nCable & Telecomm’s Ass’n v. Brand X Internet Servs.\n, 545 U.S. \nBrand X\n967 (2005). At issue in   was the proper classification of \nbroadband cable services under Title II of the Communications \nAct of 1934, as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996. \nId.\n at 975. The Federal Communications Commission (“Commission”) \nhad issued a Declaratory Rule providing that broadband internet \nservice was an “information service” but not a \n“telecommunication service” under the Act, such that certain \nregulations would not apply to cable companies that provided \nId.\nbroadband service.   at 989. The circuit court vacated the \n81 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 82 of 107\nDeclaratory Rule because a prior circuit court opinion held that \na cable modem service was in fact a telecommunications service. \nId. AT&T Corp. v. Portland\n (citing  , 216 F.3d 871 (9th Cir. \n2000). The Supreme Court concluded that the circuit court erred \nin relying on a prior court’s interpretation of the statute \nwithout first determining if the Commission’s contrary \nId.\ninterpretation was reasonable.   at 982.  \nThe Supreme Court’s holding relied on the same principles \nChevron Id.\nunderlying the   deference cases.   at 982 (stating that \nBrand X Chevron\nthe holding in   “follows from   itself”). The Court \nreasoned that Congress had delegated to the Commission the \nauthority to enforce the Communications Act, and under the \nChevron\nprinciples espoused in  , a reasonable interpretation of \nId.\nan ambiguous provision of the Act is entitled to deference.   \nat 981. Therefore, regardless of a circuit court’s prior \ninterpretation of a provision, the agency’s interpretation is \nentitled to deference as long as the court’s prior construction \nof the provision does not “follow[] from the unambiguous terms \nof the statute and thus leaves no room for agency discretion.” \nId.\n at 982. In other words, an agency’s interpretation of a \nprovision may override a prior court’s interpretation if the \nChevron\nagency is entitled to   deference and the agency’s \ninterpretation is reasonable. If the agency is not entitled to \ndeference or if the agency’s interpretation is unreasonable, a \n82 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 83 of 107\ncourt’s prior decision interpreting the same statutory provision \nSee Petit v.

Cir. 2012)(citation omitted)(finding that a court decision \ninterpreting a statute overrides the agency’s interpretation \nonly if it holds “that its construction follows from the \nunambiguous terms of the statute and thus leaves no room for \nagency discretion”).  \nThe government argues that the Policy Memorandum’s mandate \nMatter of A-B- \nto ignore circuit law contrary to  is rooted in \nBrand X\nstatute and sanctioned by  .

Moreover, the government contends that the requirement \n“simply states the truism that the INA requires all line \nofficers to follow binding decisions of the Attorney General.” \nId.\n (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a))(“determination and ruling by the \nAttorney General with respect to all questions of law shall be \ncontrolling”). The government also argues that plaintiffs have \nfailed to point to any decisions that are inconsistent with \nMatter of A-B-  \n, and therefore any instruction for an officer to \nMatter of A-B-\napply   notwithstanding prior circuit precedent to \nthe contrary is permissible. The Policy Memorandum, according to \nthe government, “simply require[s] line officers to follow \nMatter of A-B-\n[ ] unless and until a circuit court of appeals \ndeclares some aspect of it contrary to the plain text of the \nINA.” Defs.’ Reply, ECF No. 85 at 72. \n83 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 84 of 107\nThe government, again, minimizes the effect of the Policy \nBrand X\nMemorandum.

That section explicitly defines a “credible \nfear of persecution” as follows:  \nFor purposes of this subparagraph, the term \n“credible  fear  of  persecution”  means  that \nthere  is  a  significant  possibility,  taking \ninto account the credibility of the statements \nmade by the alien in support of the alien's \nclaim and such other facts as are known to the \nofficer,  that  the  alien  could  establish \neligibility for asylum under section 1158 of \nthis title.  \n88 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 89 of 107\n8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v).

However, the Court is not without guidance \nregarding which law should be applied because Congress explained \nits legislative purpose in enacting the expedited removal \nprovisions. 142 CONG. REC. S11491-02. When Congress established \nexpedited removal proceedings in 1996, it deliberately \nestablished a low screening standard so that “there should be no \ndanger that an alien with a genuine asylum claim will be \nreturned to persecution.” H.R.

Thus, if there is a disagreement among the circuits on an \nissue, the alien should get the benefit of that disagreement \nsince, if the removal proceedings are heard in the circuit \nfavorable to the aliens’ claim, there would be a significant \npossibility the alien would prevail on that claim. The \ngovernment’s reading would allow for an alien’s deportation, \nfollowing a negative credible fear determination, even if the \nalien would have a significant possibility of establishing \nasylum under section 1158 during his or her removal proceeding. \nThus, the government’s reading leads to the exact opposite \nresult intended by Congress.24  \n  The government does not contest that an alien with a \npossibility of prevailing on his or her asylum claim could be \ndenied during the less stringent credible fear determination, \nbut rather claims that this Court should defer to the \n                     \n24 The government relies on BIA cases to support its argument \nthat the law of the jurisdiction where the interview takes place \nSee\ncontrols.

The more natural \nreading of the provision, however, is that these forms of relief \nare prohibited except when a plaintiff brings “any action . . . \nId. \nspecifically authorized in a subsequent paragraph.” \n§ 1252(e)(1)(a). The structure of the statute supports this \nview.

Madison\n, 5 U.S. 137, 177 (1803), and the \ngovernment cites no authority to support the proposition that a \nCourt may declare an action unlawful but have no power to \nprevent that action from violating the rights of the very people \nit affects.31 To the contrary, such relief is supported by the \nSee Nat’l Min. Ass’n v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs\nAPA itself.  , \n                     \n31 During oral argument, the government argued for the first time \nthat an injunction in this case was tantamount to class-wide \nrelief, which the parties agree is prohibited under the statute. \nSee\n Oral Arg. Hr’g Tr., ECF No. 102 at 63; 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(e)(1)(b)(prohibiting class certification in actions \nbrought under section 1252(e)(3)). The Court finds this argument \nunpersuasive. Class-wide relief would entail an Order requiring \nnew credible fear interviews for all similarly situated \nindividuals, and for the government to return to the United \nStates all deported individuals who were affected by the \npolicies at issue in this case. Plaintiffs do not request, and \nthe Court will not order, such relief.  \n100 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 101 of 107\n145 F.3d 1399, 1409-10 (D.C. Cir. 1998)(“We have made clear that \n‘[w]hen a reviewing court determines that agency regulations are \nunlawful, the ordinary result is that the rules are vacated – \nnot that their application to the individual petitioners is \nproscribed.’”). Moreover section 1252(f) only applies when a \nplaintiff challenges the legality of immigration laws and not, \nas here, when a plaintiff seeks to enjoin conduct that violates \nthe immigration laws. In these circumstances, section 1252(f) \ndoes not limit the Court’s power. \n \n2. The Court Has the Authority to Order the Return of \nPlaintiffs Unlawfully Removed \n \nDespite the government’s suggestion during the emergency \nstay hearing that the government would return removed plaintiffs \nshould they prevail on the merits, TRO Hr’g Tr., Aug. 9, 2018, \nECF No. 23 at 13-14 (explaining that the Department of Justice \nhad previously represented to the Supreme Court that should a \nCourt find a policy that led to a plaintiffs’ deportation \nunlawful the government “would return [plaintiffs] to the United \nstates at no expense to [plaintiffs]”), the government now \nsee\nargues that the Court may not do so,   Defs.’ Reply, ECF No. \n85 at 78–79. \nIn support of its argument, the government relies \nKiyemba v. Obama\nprincipally on  , 555 F.3d 1022 (D.C. Cir 2009) \nvacated, 130 S.Ct. 1235, reinstated in amended form, 605 F.3d \n101 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 102 of 107\nKiyemba\n1046 (D.C. Cir. 2010). In  , seventeen Chinese citizens, \ndetermined to be enemy combatants, sought habeas petitions in \nconnection with their detention in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 555 \nF.3d at 1024. The petitioners sought release in the United \nStates because they feared persecution if they were returned to \nChina, but had not sought to comply with the immigration laws \nId. \ngoverning a migrant’s entry into the United States.  After \nfailed attempts to find an appropriate country in which to \nresettle, the petitioners moved for an order compelling their \nId.\nrelease into the United States.   The district court, citing \nId.\nexceptional circumstances, granted the motion.    \nThe United States Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia Circuit reversed. The Court began by recognizing that \nthe power to exclude aliens remained in the exclusive power of \nId.\nthe political branches.   at 1025 (citations omitted). As a \nresult, the Court noted, “it is not within the province of any \ncourt, unless expressly authorized by law, to review the \ndetermination of the political branch of the Government to \nId.\nexclude a given alien.”   at 1026 (citation and internal \nquotation marks omitted). The critical question was “what law \nexpressly authorized the district court to set aside the \ndecision of the Executive Branch and to order these aliens \nId.\nbrought to the United States.”   at 1026 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  \n102 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 103 of 107\nIn this case, the answer to that question is the \nKiyemba\nimmigration laws. In fact,   distinguished Supreme Court \ncases which “rested on the Supreme Court’s interpretation not of \nthe Constitution, but of a provision in the immigration laws.” \nId.\n at 1028. The Court further elaborated on this point with the \nfollowing explanation:  \nit would . . . be wrong to assert that, by \nordering aliens paroled into the country . . \n.  the  Court  somehow  undermined  the  plenary \nauthority of the political branches over the \nentry and admission of aliens. The point is \nthat Congress has set up the framework under \nwhich aliens may enter the United States. The \nJudiciary only possesses the power Congress \ngives  it  to  review  Executive  action  taken \nwithin that framework. Since petitioners have \nnot  applied  for  admission,  they  are  not \nentitled to invoke that judicial power.  \n \nId.\n at 1028 n.12.  \nThe critical difference here is that plaintiffs have \navailed themselves of the “framework under which aliens may \nId.\nenter the United States.”   Because plaintiffs have done so, \nthis Court “possesses the power Congress gives it to review \nId. \nExecutive action taken within that framework.”  Because the \nKiyemba\nCourt finds   inapposite, the government’s argument that \nthis Court lacks authority to order plaintiffs returned to the \nUnited States is unavailing. \nIt is also clear that injunctive relief is necessary for \nthe Court to fashion an effective remedy in this case. The \n103 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 104 of 107\ncredible fear interviews of plaintiffs administered pursuant to \nMatter of A-B-\nthe policies in   and the Policy Memorandum were \nfundamentally flawed. A Court Order solely enjoining these \npolicies is meaningless for the removed plaintiffs who are \nunable to attend the subsequent interviews to which they are \nSee, e.g. Walters v. Reno\nentitled.  ,  , 145 F.3d 1032, 1050–51 \n(9th Cir. 1998)(“[A]llowing class members to reopen their \nproceedings is basically meaningless if they are unable to \nattend the hearings that they were earlier denied.”). \n \n3. Permanent Injunction Factors Require Permanent \nInjunctive Relief  \n \n  A plaintiff seeking a permanent injunction must satisfy a \neBay Inc. v. MercExchange L.L.C.\nfour-factor test.  ,  , 547 U.S. \n388, 391 (2006). Plaintiffs must demonstrate they have:       \n(1) suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that traditional legal \nremedies, such as monetary relief, are inadequate to compensate \nfor that injury; (3) the balance of hardships between the \nparties warrants equitable relief; and (4) the injunction is not \nSee Morgan Drexen, Inc. v. \ncontrary to the public interest.   \nConsumer Fin. Prot. Bureau\n, 785 F.3d 684, 695 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  \nPlaintiffs seek a permanent injunction, arguing that they \nhave been irreparably harmed and that the equities are in their \nfavor. Pls.’ Mot., ECF No. 64-1 at 73–74. The government has not \nresponded to these arguments on the merits, and rests on its \n104 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 105 of 107\ncontention that the Court does not have the authority to order \nsuch relief. Defs.’ Reply, ECF No. 85 at 75–78. Having found \nthat the Court does have the authority to order injunctive \nsupra,\nrelief,   at 93–104, the Court will explain why that relief \nis appropriate. \nPlaintiffs claim that the credible fear policies this Court \nhas found to be unlawful have caused them irreparable harm. It \nis undisputed that the unlawful policies were applied to \nplaintiffs’ credible fear determinations and thus caused \nSee\nplaintiffs’ applications to be denied.   Defs.’ Mot., ECF No. \n57-1 at 28 (stating an “asylum officer reviewed each of \n[plaintiffs] credible fear claims and found them wanting in \nlight of Matter of A-B-”). Indeed, plaintiffs credibly alleged \nat their credible fear determinations that they feared rape, \npervasive domestic violence, beatings, shootings, and death in \ntheir countries of origin. Based on plaintiffs’ declarations \nattesting to such harms, they have demonstrated that they have \nsuffered irreparable injuries.32  \n  The Court need spend little time on the second factor: \nwhether other legal remedies are inadequate. No relief short of \nenjoining the unlawful credible fear policies in this case could \n                     \n32 The country reports support the accounts of the Plaintiffs. \nSee\n Mujahid Decl., ECF No. 10-3, Exs. K-T; Second Mujahid Decl., \nECF No. 64-4 Exs. 10–13; Honduras Decl., ECF No. 64-6; Guatemala \nDecl., ECF No. 64-7; El Salvador Decl., ECF No. 64-8. \n105 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 106 of 107\nprovide an adequate remedy. Plaintiffs do not seek monetary \ncompensation. The harm they suffer will continue unless and \nuntil they receive a credible fear determination pursuant to the \nexisting immigration laws. Moreover, without an injunction, the \nplaintiffs previously removed will continue to live in fear \nevery day, and the remaining plaintiffs are at risk of removal.  \nThe last two factors are also straightforward. The balance \nof the hardships weighs in favor of plaintiffs since the \n“[g]overnment ‘cannot suffer harm from an injunction that merely \n R.I.L-R\nends an unlawful practice.’” , 80 F. Supp. at 191 (citing \nRodriguez\n, 715 F.3d at 1145). And the injunction is not contrary \nto the public interest because, of course, “[t]he public \ninterest is served when administrative agencies comply with \nId.\ntheir obligations under the APA.”   (citations omitted). \nMoreover, as the Supreme Court has stated, “there is a public \ninterest in preventing aliens from being wrongfully removed, \nparticularly to countries where they are likely to face \nNken v. Holder\nsubstantial harm.”  , 556 U.S. 418, 436 (2009). No \none seriously questions that plaintiffs face substantial harm if \nreturned to their countries of origin. Under these \ncircumstances, plaintiffs have demonstrated they are entitled to \na permanent injunction in this case. \n106 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 106   Filed 12/19/18   Page 107 of 107\nIV. Conclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court holds that it has\njurisdiction to hear plaintiffs’ challenges to the credible fear \npolicies, that it has the authority to order the injunctive \nrelief, and that, with the exception of two policies, the new \ncredible fear policies are arbitrary, capricious, and in \nviolation of the immigration laws.  \nAccordingly, the Court GRANTS in PART and DENIES in PART \nplaintiffs' cross-motion for summary judgment and motion to \nconsider evidence outside the administrative record. The Court \nalso GRANTS plaintiffs’ motion for a permanent injunction. The \nCourt further GRANTS in PART and DENIES in PART the government’s \nmotion for summary judgment and motion to strike. \nThe Court will issue an appropriate Order consistent with \nthis Memorandum Opinion. \nSO ORDERED. \nSigned:   Emmet G.

Dec. 316 (A.G. 2018), a precedential \nimmigration decision, and subsequent guidance issued by the \nSee\nDepartment of Homeland Security.   Order, ECF No. 105. The \nvacated policies related to the expedited removal process and \ncredible fear determinations made by asylum officers. The Court \nheld that these policies violated the Administrative Procedure \nAct and the immigration laws. Accordingly, the Court vacated the \nunlawful policies and permanently enjoined the government from \napplying the policies in future cases.  \nThe government now requests a stay, pending appeal of the \nCourt’s Order, to enable the unlawful policies to continue to \napply in all expedited removal cases, except the plaintiffs. For \nthe following reasons, defendants' motion for stay is DENIED. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 124   Filed 01/25/19   Page 2 of 14\nI. Legal Standard \nA court's decision to stay its final judgment pending \nappeal is an extraordinary remedy that is an “intrusion into the \nNken v. Holder\nordinary process of . . . judicial review.”  , 556 \nsee also Cuomo v. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory \nU.S. 418, 428 (2009); \nComm'n\n, 772 F.2d 972, 978 (D.C. Cir. 1985). The issuance of a \nstay is a matter of judicial discretion, not a matter of right, \nand the “party requesting a stay bears the burden of showing \n.” \nthat the circumstances justify an exercise of that discretion\nNken\n, 556 U.S. at 433-34. In exercising its discretion, a court \nconsiders the following four factors:  \n(1) the likelihood that the party seeking the stay \nwill prevail on the merits of the appeal; (2) the \nlikelihood  that  the  moving  party  will  be \nirreparably harmed absent a stay; (3) the prospect \nthat others will be harmed if the court grants the \nstay; and (4) the public interest in granting the \nstay. \n \nCuomo\n, 772 F.2d at 974. It is “the movant’s obligation to \njustify the court’s exercise of such an extraordinary remedy.” \nId.\n at 978. \nII. Discussion  \n  The Court begins with a discussion of general guidance from \nthe Supreme Court about the four stay factors. “The first two \nfactors of the traditional standard are the most critical. It is \nnot enough that the chance of success on the merits be ‘better \nNken,   “\nthan negligible.’”  556 U.S. at 434 (citation omitted). By \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 124   Filed 01/25/19   Page 3 of 14\nthe same token, simply showing some ‘possibility of irreparable \nId.   \ninjury,’ fails to satisfy the second factor.”  at 434–35\n(internal citation omitted). “Once an applicant satisfies the \nfirst two factors, the traditional stay inquiry calls for \nassessing the harm to the opposing party and weighing the public \ninterest. These factors merge when the Government is the \nId. \nopposing party.”  at 435. In the context of removal \nproceedings, courts must be mindful that the “Government's role \nas the respondent in every removal proceeding does not make the \nId.\npublic interest in each individual one negligible.”   \n(citations omitted). With these principles in mind, the Court \nnow turns to the four stay factors. \n  A. Likelihood of Success on the Merits  \n  In determining whether a stay should be granted, a \n“critical” factor is whether the moving party is likely to \nId. \nsucceed on the merits.  at 434. \nThe government confines its arguments to the claim that the \nCourt has no authority to enjoin the operation of any expedited \nremoval policies beyond that policies’ application to the \nSee\nplaintiffs.   Defs.’ Mot. to Stay, ECF No. 107. The government \nmakes three principal arguments to support its position. First, \nthe government points to section 1252(e)(3), the provision under \nSee\nwhich the plaintiffs have brought this case.   8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(e)(3). Next, the government looks to the legislative \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 124   Filed 01/25/19   Page 4 of 14\nhistory of the 1996 amendments to the Immigration and \nNationality Act (“INA”). Finally, the government argues \nprecedent in this Circuit “indicates” that its position is \ncorrect. The Court considers each argument in turn. \n    i. Section 1252(e)(3) \n   The government first argues that the Congressional scheme \nprecludes any injunctive relief that is not limited to the \nplaintiffs in this case. Defs.’ Mot. to Stay, ECF No. 107 at 2–\n4. The Court has already rejected the various arguments made on \nthis point in its Memorandum Opinion. ECF No. 106 at 98–101. \nUndaunted, the government now points to section 1252(e)(3) which \ngrants the Court authority for “judicial review of \ndeterminations under section 1225(b) and its implementation.”  \nDefs.’ Mot. to Stay, ECF No. 107 at 3. The government argues \nthat such determinations may only be made individually and \ntherefore the Court only had authority to review, and provide a \nId.\nremedy for, the plaintiffs’ individual determinations.   The \ngovernment further argues that its position is supported by a \nprovision that prohibits a court from certifying a class action \nin any action for which judicial review is authorized under \nSee\n1252(e).   8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(1)(B). \n  The Court is no more persuaded by the government’s \narguments here than it was when the government made nearly \nSee, \nidentical arguments in its motion for summary judgment. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 124   Filed 01/25/19   Page 5 of 14\ne.g.\n, Memorandum Opinion, ECF No. 106 at 100 n.30 (rejecting \nargument that an injunction in this case is tantamount to class-\nwide relief). As the Court explained in its Memorandum Opinion, \nthe government’s argument requires the Court to ignore the fact \nthat section 1252(e)(3) authorizes a systemic legal challenge to \na new expedited removal written policy directive issued under \nthe authority of the Attorney General and contains no limitation \non relief once a court makes a determination that a policy \nSee\ndirective is unlawful.   8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3). \nFurthermore, the provision itself explicitly states that \nwhen a plaintiff brings a claim under section 1252(e)(3), the \nCourt is “limited to determinations of . . . whether . . . a \nwritten policy directive . . . is not consistent with applicable \nprovisions of this subchapter or is otherwise in violation of \nlaw.” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A)(ii). There is no statutory \nrequirement, as the government argues, to declare a policy in \nviolation of the law only as applied to the individual \nCf. \nplaintiffs.  8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(limiting injunctive relief to \nonly the plaintiff when a plaintiff challenges the legality of a \nprovision of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act of 1996 (“IIRIRA”)). To accept the \ngovernment’s position would require the Court to ignore the \nsystemic nature of this action. It also would require the Court \nto ignore the general rule that “[w]hen a reviewing court \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 124   Filed 01/25/19   Page 6 of 14\ndetermines that agency regulations are unlawful, the ordinary \nresult is that the rules are vacated—not that their application \nNat’l Min. Ass'n \nto the individual petitioners is proscribed.” \nv. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs\n, 145 F.3d 1399, 1409 (D.C. Cir. \n1998)(citation omitted). \n  As to the prohibition on class actions, as the Court stated \nin its Memorandum Opinion, class-wide relief in this case would \nentail an order requiring new credible fear interviews for all \nimmigrants who applied for asylum from June 11, 2018, the date \nof the Attorney General’s decision, and for the government to \nreturn to the United States every deported individual who was \naffected by the policies at issue in this case. Memorandum \nOpinion, ECF No. 106 at 100 n.30. The Court has ordered no such \nrelief in this case. \n    ii. Legislative History  \n  The government next points to the legislative history of \nthe 1996 amendments to the INA. Defs.’ Mot. to Stay, ECF No. 107 \nat 4 (citing H.R. REP. No. 104-469(I)). Noting that this Court \nrelied extensively on the legislative history of the immigration \nlaw, the government argues the history demonstrates Congress’ \nintent to allow policies declared to be unlawful by a court to \nId.\nremain in place.   The government selectively quotes the \nlegislative history to bolster its unpersuasive argument. The \nrelevant section, however, states as follows:  \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 124   Filed 01/25/19   Page 7 of 14\nSection 306 also limits the authority of Federal \ncourts other than the Supreme Court to enjoin the \noperation of the new removal procedures established \nin  this  legislation.  These  limitations  do  not \npreclude challenges to the new procedures, but the \nprocedures will remain in force while such lawsuits \nare  pending.  In  addition,  courts  may  issue \ninjunctive  relief  pertaining  to  the  case  of  an \nindividual  alien,  and  thus  protect  against  any \nimmediate  violation  of  rights.  However,  single \ndistrict courts or courts of appeal do not have \nauthority  to  enjoin  procedures  established  by \nCongress to reform the process of removing illegal \naliens from the U.S. \n \nH.R. REP. No. 104-469(I) at 161 (emphasis added). This argument \nis a repackaging of the government’s argument in its motion for \nsummary judgment that section 1252(f) precludes the court’s \nSee\ninjunction.   Memorandum Opinion, ECF No. 106 at 98. Again, \nthe Court agrees with the government that the Court would not \nhave the authority to enjoin, other than as to the plaintiffs, \n“new removal procedures established” by the 1996 Amendments to \nthe INA, nor would it have “authority to enjoin procedures \nestablished by Congress to reform the process of removing \nSee\nillegal aliens from the U.S.”   H.R. REP. No. 104-469(I) at \n161.  The problem for the government is that this case does not \nconcern “procedures established by Congress” or a challenge to \nSee id. \nthe INA itself.    Rather, the plaintiffs have challenged \n“written policy directive[s] [and] written policy guideline[s]” \nSee\nestablished by the Attorney General.   8 U.S.C. § \n1252(e)(3)(A)(ii). \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 124   Filed 01/25/19   Page 8 of 14\nAmerican Immigration Lawyers Ass'n v. Reno\n   (“AILA”), 199 \nAILA\nF.3d 1352, 1358 (D.C. Cir. 2000), is instructive. In   the \nplaintiffs challenged several provisions of IIRIRA, an Act of \nCongress, which established the expedited removal provisions \nId.\nenacted by the legislative branch.   In such a case, the Court \nwould have been able to enjoin any unlawful provisions as to the \nplaintiffs in the case only because the plaintiffs challenged \nSee\n“removal procedures established by Congress.”    H.R. REP. No. \n104-469(I) at 161. \n   In contrast, the plaintiffs here have challenged the \nnot legislation passed by \naction of the Attorney General, \nCongress\n. Moreover, the plaintiffs requested that the Attorney \nSee\nGeneral conform the policies to the immigration laws.   \nMemorandum Opinion, ECF No. 106 at 101 (explaining the \nplaintiffs do not challenge the statute but rather seek to \nenjoin the government from violating the statute). The unlawful \npolicies in this case were not the result of action by the \nlegislature, but rather a policy directive issued by the \nexecutive branch. Again, it is the will of Congress--not the \nwhims of the executive--that determines the standard for \nexpedited removal. And when there is an inconsistency, the \nlatter must accede to the former. \n \n \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 124   Filed 01/25/19   Page 9 of 14\nAILA\n    iii.   and 8 U.S.C. Section 1252(f)   \nAILA\nThe government, citing  , argues that the Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (“D.C. Circuit”) \nhas “indicated” that relief in cases brought under section \n1252(e)(3) should be limited to the parties before the Court, \nand only those parties. Defs.’ Mot. to Stay, ECF No. 107 at 5. \nAILA\n concerned the doctrine of third-party standing, and the \norganizational plaintiffs in that case sought to litigate the \nrights of aliens who were not parties to the suit. 199 F.3d at \n1357. As the D.C. Circuit explained, the organizational \nplaintiffs alleged that the new statutory scheme \"violated not \ntheir rights or the rights of their members, but the [rights] of \nunnamed aliens who were or might be subject to the statute and \nId.\nregulations.\"   Because the organizational plaintiffs did not \nhave standing, the D.C. Circuit had no occasion to discuss the \nId.\nlimits of an appropriate remedy.   at 1364 (holding “plaintiff \norganizations do not have standing to raise claims, whether \nstatutory or constitutional, on behalf of aliens subjected to \nIIRIRA's expedited removal system”). The D.C. Circuit simply \nnoted that the statutory scheme supported its view that \nlitigants could not assert the rights of others in a 1252(e)(3) \nId.\naction.   at 1359. In support of this view, the Court pointed \nto two provisions relevant to this case: section 1252(e)(1)(B) \nwhich prohibits class actions; and section 1252(f)(1) which only \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 124   Filed 01/25/19   Page 10 of 14\nauthorizes injunctive relief for the parties to a case when the \nId.\nparties challenge the legality of an immigration statute.   \nAs explained in this Court’s Memorandum opinion, section \n1252(f)(1) only applies when a party is challenging the legality \nof a statute, and not when a party argues that the defendant’s \nAILA\nactions violate the statute. ECF No. 106 at 101. In  , the \norganizational plaintiffs argued that the statute itself was \nunconstitutional, not that defendants were not complying with \nthe statute, therefore the D.C. Circuit’s analysis of 1252(f) is \nwholly consistent with this Court’s Memorandum Opinion. As for \nthe bar on class certification, the Court has already ruled that \nSee supra\nthe injunction is not tantamount to class-wide relief.     \nAILA\nat 6. In any event,   was an analysis of third-party \nstanding, and the D.C. Circuit did not address what relief would \nbe appropriate when a plaintiff that was subject to the \nexpedited removal process successfully challenges a policy that \nAILA\nviolates the immigration laws. The government’s reliance on   \nis therefore misplaced.  \nIn light of the foregoing analysis, the Court is not \npersuaded that the government is likely to prevail on appeal.  \n  B. Irreparable Injury  \n  The Court next considers if the government has shown it \nNken\nwill be “irreparably injured absent a stay.”  , 556 U.S. at \n434. (citation omitted). The claimed irreparable injury must be \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 124   Filed 01/25/19   Page 11 of 14\nlikely to occur; “simply showing some ‘possibility of \nId.\nirreparable injury’” is insufficient.   (citation omitted).  \nThe government briefly states it will be irreparably \nharmed, arguing that “[a]n[] order that enjoins a governmental \nentity from enforcing actions taken pursuant to statutes enacted \nby the duly elected representatives of the people constitutes an \nirreparable injury.” Defs.’ Mot. to Stay, ECF No. 107 at 7. \nThere are several problems with this argument. As stated above, \nand at length in the Memorandum Opinion, the plaintiffs have not \nchallenged any action taken pursuant to statutes enacted by \nelected representatives. Rather, the challenged action at issue \nin this case was taken contrary to the immigration laws. The \nplaintiffs have invoked those immigration laws and the Court has \nfound that several of the policies violate those laws. Moreover, \nthis was not an action by the legislature, but rather a policy \ndirective issued by the executive. \nThe government, therefore, has not shown that a stay of the \nCourt’s order is necessary to avoid a likely irreparable injury \nin this case. \nC. Substantial Injury to Other Parties and the Public \nInterest  \n \n  The Court next addresses the second two factors, which \nNken, \n“merge when the Government is the opposing party.”  556 \nU.S. at 434. The government briefly argues that no party will be \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 124   Filed 01/25/19   Page 12 of 14\nharmed if the Court grants the stay because the policies are \nenjoined as to all the plaintiffs in this case. Defs.’ Mot. to \nStay, ECF No. 107 at 6. However, the government fails to \nSee \nacknowledge that the Court considers harm to non-parties. \nLoving v. I.R.S.\n, 920 F. Supp. 2d 108, 111 (D.D.C. 2013) \n(considering harm to non-parties if the Court granted the stay). \nIn light of the Court’s finding that the heightened standard \nimposed by the policies is unlawful, it is clear that immigrants \nwho allege credible fears of domestic or gang-related violence \nwill be harmed by those policies.  \n  The government does not appear to address the last factor, \ni.e., whether the stay is in the public interest. The Court \nrecognizes that the public has an interest “in efficient \nLandon v. \nadministration of the immigration laws at the border.” \nPlasencia\n, 459 U.S. 21, 34 (1982). However, \"there is a public \ninterest in preventing aliens from being wrongfully removed, \nparticularly to countries where they are likely to face \nNken\nsubstantial harm,\"  , 556 U.S. at 436, as well as an interest \nin “ensuring that ‘statutes enacted by [their] representatives’ \nEast Bay Sanctuary \nare not imperiled by executive fiat.” \nCovenant v. Trump\n, 909 F.3d 1219, 1255 (9th Cir. 2018)(citation \nomitted).  \nThe Court is also mindful that the Supreme Court has \ncautioned against overbroad injunctions because, in certain \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 124   Filed 01/25/19   Page 13 of 14\ncircumstances, they “may have a detrimental effect by \nforeclosing adjudication by a number of different courts and \nCalifano v. Yamasaki\njudges.”  , 442 U.S. 682, 702 (1979). Other \ncourts have highlighted concerns such as depriving non-parties \nthe right of litigating in other forums; and the potential for \nforum shopping “which hinders the equitable administration of \nSee California v. Azar\nlaws.”    , 911 F.3d 558, 583 (9th Cir. \n2018). However, because of the unique statutory scheme for \nsystemic challenges under section 1252(e)(3), none of these \nconcerns are relevant here. Jurisdiction to review new written \npolicy directives that implement the fair credibility \ndetermination process is limited to the United States District \nCourt for the District of Columbia. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A). \nAccordingly, the concern that an injunction in this case will \nforeclose adjudication by other courts, or encourage forum \nshopping for these types of claims, simply is not present. \nSimilarly, there is no concern that the Court’s injunction will \ndeprive non-parties “the right to litigate in other forums,” \nAzar\n, 911 F.3d at 583, since the District of Columbia is the \nonly forum authorized by the statute.  \nHaving considered the stay factors, the Court concludes \nthat the government has failed to meet its burden to justify the \nCourt’s exercise of the extraordinary remedy of staying its \nSee Cuomo\nfinal judgment pending appeal.    , 772 F.2d at 974. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 124   Filed 01/25/19   Page 14 of 14\nIII. Conclusion \n  For the foregoing reasons, the Court ORDERS that \ndefendants’ motion to stay the Court’s final judgment pending \nappeal is DENIED.  \nSO ORDERED \nSigned:   Emmet G. Sullivan   \nUnited States District Judge   \nJanuary 25, 2019 \n \n14 \n ",

No. 10, and an Emergency \nMotion for Stay of Removal, ECF No. 11. In their Motion for Stay of \nRemoval, Plaintiffs sought emergency relief because two of the \nPlaintiffs, “Carmen”1 and her daughter J.A.C.F., were “subject to \nimminent removal as soon as 11:59 pm on Thursday, August 9, 2018.” \nECF No. 11 at 1.   \nIn light of their “imminent removal,” this Court held an \nemergency hearing on August 8, 2018. At that hearing, Defendants \nstated that they would not consent to staying the removal past 11:59 \n                                                             \n1 “Carmen” is proceeding under a pseudonym in this action. \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 22   Filed 08/09/18   Page 2 of 3\npm Thursday August 9, 2018, but specifically represented to the Court \nthat “Carmen” and her daughter would not be removed prior to that \ntime. Based on that representation, the Court set an expedited \nbriefing schedule to be completed by 1:00 am Thursday, August 9, \n2018, and set a hearing on the motion for that same morning.   \nAfter hearing argument on the emergency motion, and following a \nCourt recess, Plaintiffs’ counsel informed the Court that, despite \nthe representations made by Defendants, Plaintiffs “Carmen” and her \ndaughter had been removed from their place of detention and could be \nin the process of being removed from the United States. In an email \nto this Court’s Courtroom Deputy following the hearing, government \ncounsel confirmed that “Carmen” and her daughter were, in fact, on an \nairplane while the Court was hearing argument on Plaintiffs’ \nEmergency Motion.  \nUpon learning in open Court that “Carmen” and her daughter had \nbeen removed from their place of detention and could be in the \nprocess of being removed from the country, the Court issued an oral \nOrder requiring the Defendants to return “Carmen” and her daughter to \nthe United States FORTHWITH. The Court informed government counsel \nthat it would neither tolerate nor excuse any delay with compliance \nwith this Order. The Court also stated that it would enter a written \nOrder memorializing its oral Order.  \n \n \n2 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 22   Filed 08/09/18   Page 3 of 3\nAccordingly, it is   \nHEREBY ORDERED that the Defendants shall return “Carmen” and her \ndaughter to the United States FORTHWITH; and it is \nFURTHER ORDERED that in the event that the Defendants do not \nfully comply with this Order, Defendants Attorney General Jefferson \nSessions, III; Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security \nKirstjen M.

Rather, a faithful application of settled principles of administrative law requires the \nCourt to determine whether the Chevron framework applies to each statutory issue raised in \nMatter of A-B-; whether Congress left a gap for the Attorney General to fill; and whether the \nAttorney General filled any such gap in a way that is consistent with the statutory framework.  \nEach statutory question requires its own analysis.  \nBecause Matter of A-B- does not merit blanket deference, the Attorney General and the \nUnited States Citizenship and Immigration Services Guidance (the “Guidance”) claim \nimpermissible agency prerogative in directing asylum officers to disregard circuit law \ninconsistent with anything in Matter of A-B-.  While the Guidance invokes National Cable & \nTelecommunications Ass’n v. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U.S. 967, 982 (2005), for the \npremise that agency interpretations can trump prior judicial interpretations, that premise is true \nonly to the extent that an agency has reasonably interpreted an ambiguous statutory term that \nCongress authorized it to interpret.  The court should reject the Attorney General’s expansive \nclaims, and faithfully apply the well-established Chevron framework.    \nARGUMENT \nI.  PLAINTIFFS’ ARGUMENTS ARE GROUNDED IN SETTLED CHEVRON \nPRINCIPLES \nThis Court’s assessment of how much, if any, of Matter of A-B- merits deference \nimplicates the two-step framework defined in Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842.  Chevron is, at its core, \na search for a statutory “gap” and an inquiry into the scope and boundaries of that gap.  See \nBrand X, 545 U.S. at 982 (“Chevron’s premise is that it is for agencies, not courts, to fill \nstatutory gaps.”).  Its theoretical basis is that a statutory ambiguity represents a congressional \n3 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 81   Filed 10/02/18   Page 11 of 23\n“delegation of authority to the agency” that administers that statute to interpret that “specific \nprovision.”  Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843-44; FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. \n120, 159 (2000) (confirming “implicit delegation” theory).  In determining how much of Matter \nof A-B- merits deference, the Court must first determine whether Congress has “directly spoken \nto the precise question at issue,” and, if so, give effect to that “unambiguously expressed intent.”  \nChevron, 467 U.S. at 844.  If Congress instead “left a gap for the agency to fill,” id., the Court \nmust “consider ‘whether the agency’s answer is based on a permissible construction of the \nstatute.’”  Kaufman v. Nielsen, 896 F.3d 475, 482 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (quoting Chevron, 467 U.S. \nat 842-43).  A review of these principles demonstrates that Matter of A-B- speaks to a wide range \nof issues that – assuming Plaintiffs are correct on the underlying issues of immigration law – do \nnot warrant deference.  \nA.  Chevron Applies Only To Certain Agency Interpretations \nThe Court’s inquiry begins by asking whether the Chevron framework properly applies – \nan analysis referred to as “step zero” in academic literature.2  This inquiry is necessary because \n“[n]ot every agency interpretation of a statute is appropriately analyzed under Chevron.”  \nAlabama Educ. Ass’n v. Chao, 455 F.3d 386, 392 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  As a starting point, Chevron \napplies to only issues of statutory interpretation arising from a statute the agency \nadministers.  Bush-Quayle ’92 Primary Comm., Inc. v. Fed. Election Comm’n, 104 F.3d 448, 452 \n(D.C. Cir. 1997).  Moreover, a number of agency interpretations do not fall within the two-step \n                                                 \n2 See generally Thomas W. Merrill & Kristin E. Hickman, Chevron’s Domain, 89 Geo. L.J. 833 \n(2001) (defining the term Chevron “Step Zero”); Cass R. Sunstein, Chevron Step Zero, 92 Va. L. \nRev. 187 (2006) (discussing situations in which courts do not apply the Chevron framework).  \nSome scholars have also suggested that separation of powers concerns must eclipse agency \ndeference in certain immigration contexts.  See, e.g., Alina Das, Unshackling Habeas Review: \nChevron Deference and Statutory Interpretation in Immigration Cases, 90 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 143 \n(2015) (arguing that Chevron deference should not apply to the BIA’s interpretation of \nimmigration detention provisions in the context of habeas corpus). \n4 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 81   Filed 10/02/18   Page 12 of 23\nChevron framework, such as when an agency does not “set out with a lawmaking pretense in \nmind,” United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 233 (2001); interprets a statute it does not \nadminister, Brown & Williamson, 529 U.S. at 159; or addresses a “question of deep ‘economic \nand political significance’ that is central to [a] statutory scheme,” King v. Burwell, 135 S. Ct. \n2480, 2489 (2015).  These limitations are important both as part of the Court’s overall inquiry \nand because they underscore the need to preserve Chevron within its proper boundaries.  See also \nPereira v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. 2105, 2120 (2018) (Kennedy, J. concurring) (referring to \n“reflexive deference” as “troubling”).  \nB.  The Step One Inquiry Asks Whether Congress Has Left A Gap For The \nAgency To Fill With Regard To A Specific Issue \nThe formal Chevron inquiry begins by asking whether Congress has “unambiguously \nexpressed” its intent with regard to a particular issue, or left a “gap for the agency to fill.”  \nChevron, 467 U.S. at 844.  Because the focus is on each “specific issue,” Fin. Planning Ass’n v. \nSEC, 482 F.3d 481, 487 (D.C. Cir. 2007), the entire Matter of A-B- opinion is not automatically \nafforded deference if this Court concludes that one of the terms that Matter of A-B- interprets is \nambiguous.  Contra Defendants’ Memorandum Of Law In Support Of Their Motion For \nSummary Judgment at 26-27 (Sept. 12, 2018), ECF No. 57-1 (“Defs.’ Mem.”).  Rather, the Court \nmust separately address each of an agency’s claims of authority to interpret a particular statutory \ngap.  For example, Plaintiffs challenge the requirement that asylum applicants who fear non-\ngovernmental persecutors must show their home government “condoned” their persecution or \n“demonstrated a complete helplessness” to protect them.  Plaintiffs’ Memorandum In Support Of \nTheir Cross Motion For Summary Judgment And Opposition To Defendants’ Motion For \nSummary Judgment at 38-39, 56 (Sept. 26, 2018), ECF No. 64-1 (“Pls.’ Mem.”).  They argue \nthat the longstanding “unable or unwilling” standard was a well-established construction of the \n5 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 81   Filed 10/02/18   Page 13 of 23\nterm “persecution” at the time the 1980 Refugee Act was enacted, and was therefore \nincorporated into that Act when it used the word “persecution.”  Id.  Amici do not address the \nmerits of this argument, but it illustrates two important features of the first step of Chevron. \nFirst, as noted, the Court must apply the first Chevron step to the specific issue on which \nthe agency seeks deference.  The government argues that Matter of A-B- is entitled to deference \nbecause it interpreted a statutory term, “particular social group,” which is one of the five \nprotected grounds on the basis of which an applicant can seek asylum.  See 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1158(b)(2)(A)(i).  But, to the extent that the Attorney General’s discussion of the “condoned or \ncomplete helplessness” standard in Matter of A-B- is an interpretation of the asylum statutes, it \ncannot be an interpretation of “particular social group” – as both Matter of A-B- and the \ngovernment’s brief recognize, the “unable or unwilling” standard is an interpretation of the \nseparate term “persecution.”  See 27 I. & N. Dec. at 337 (“Board precedents have defined \n‘persecution’” to include the requirement that “the harm or suffering must be ‘inflicted either by \nthe government of a country or by persons or an organization that the government was unable or \nunwilling to control.’”) (quoting Matter of Acosta, 19 I. & N. Dec. 211, 222 (BIA 1985)); Defs.’ \nMem. 4; 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42) (a “refugee” eligible for asylum is one who is “persecuted or \nwho has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of,” among other things, “membership in \na particular social group”).3  Thus, Plaintiffs’ argument that the new formulation violates the \nsettled construction at the time Congress enacted the term “persecution” is properly assessed \n                                                 \n3 To the extent that the government argues that Matter of A-B- adopts this formulation because it \nhas been “used in published decisions” of three courts of appeals, Defs.’ Mem. 29, that \ndiscussion does not merit deference, because the Chevron framework applies to agency \ninterpretations of congressional gaps in a statute the agency administers, District of Columbia v. \nDep’t of Labor, 819 F.3d 444, 449 (D.C. Cir. 2016), not to agency interpretations of judicial \nopinions. \n6 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 81   Filed 10/02/18   Page 14 of 23\nunder Chevron as a distinct question from the interpretation of “particular social group.”  The \ndistinction between the two interpretive tasks is particularly important because the government \npreviously concluded Congress used the term “persecution” to incorporate a precise meaning.  \nMatter of Acosta, 19 I. & N. Dec. at 222-23 (concluding, in adopting the “unable or unwilling” \nstandard, that Congress “intended” the term to incorporate the “judicial and administrative \nconstruction” of the term “persecution” existing at the time).    \nSecond, the kind of argument Plaintiffs have offered on this issue is well-established as a \nway to demonstrate that Congress has answered the question at issue at Chevron step one.  The \nChevron framework directs this Court to use the “traditional tools of statutory construction” to \ndiscern whether “Congress had an intention on the precise question at issue.”  Chevron, 467 U.S. \nat 843 n.9; see also id. (courts must “reject administrative constructions which are contrary to \nclear congressional intent”).  Whether a statute displays a clear congressional intent or left a gap \nto fill is a “pure question of statutory construction” that is “for the courts to decide.”  INS v. \nCardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 446 (1987).  \nThe question is not whether a term is linguistically ambiguous (although such ambiguity \nis relevant).  Rather, courts rely on the full range of tools for interpreting a statute, including the \n“text, structure, and the overall statutory scheme, as well as the problem Congress sought to \nsolve.”  Fin. Planning Ass’n, 482 F.3d at 487; see Pereira, 138 S. Ct. at 2113 (Chevron \ndeference inapplicable where the Court concluded, based on the text, statutory context, and \n“common sense,” that Congress had “supplied a clear and unambiguous answer to the \ninterpretive question at hand”); Gen. Dynamics Land Sys., Inc. v. Cline, 540 U.S. 581, 600 \n(2004) (finding “clear sense of congressional intent” in statute’s “text, structure, purpose,” \n“history,” and “relationship to other federal statutes”).  For example, in United States v. Home \n7 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 81   Filed 10/02/18   Page 15 of 23\nConcrete & Supply, LLC, 566 U.S. 478, 488-89 (2012), the plurality observed that, despite some \n“linguistic ambiguity,” Congress had clearly spoken to the issue based on the text, statutory \ncontext, legislative history, and the fact that the agency’s interpretation would create “patent \nincongruity” within the statutory scheme.  See also Pharm. Research & Mfrs. of Am. v. \nThompson, 251 F.3d 219, 224 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (concluding that, although the word “payment” \nwas susceptible to several meanings, Congress had clearly spoken to the issue and left no gap for \nthe agency to fill). \nOf particular relevance to Matter of A-B- is the longstanding principle that Congress is \npresumed to have incorporated prior administrative and judicial interpretations of a statute when \nit uses the same language in a subsequent enactment.  See Sekhar v. United States, 570 U.S. 729, \n733 (2013) (explaining that “if a word is obviously transplanted from another legal source, \nwhether the common law or other legislation, it brings the old soil with it”) (quoting Felix \nFrankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes, 47 Colum. L. Rev. 527, 537 (1947)); \nLorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575, 580 (1978) (Congress is aware of interpretations of a statute and \nis presumed to adopt them when it re-enacts them without change); Shapiro v. United States, 335 \nU.S. 1, 16 (1948) (Congress presumed to have incorporated “settled judicial construction” of \nstatutory language through re-enactment); Costanzo v. Tillinghast, 287 U.S. 341, 345 (1932) \n(when Congress re-enacts the term with “consistent construction” by agency, the court presumes \nthat Congress did not intend to change that interpretation); cf. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at \n439-40 (conclusion regarding congressional intent supported by academic understandings of the \nrelevant term).  This rule applies to any use of “words or phrases that have already received \nauthoritative construction.”  Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The \nInterpretation of Legal Texts 322 (2012).   \n8 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 81   Filed 10/02/18   Page 16 of 23\nThus, when Congress uses a term with a settled meaning, it demonstrates a clear \ncongressional intent for purposes of the first Chevron step.  See Fin. Planning Ass’n, 482 F.3d at \n490 (longstanding agency understanding of statutory language supports conclusion that statutory \nmeaning is “unambiguous”); cf. B & H Med., LLC v. United States, 116 Fed. Cl. 671, 685 (2014) \n(a term with a “judicially settled meaning” is “not ambiguous” for purposes of deference under \nAuer v. Robbins, 117 S. Ct. 905 (1997)).  For example, in Prudencio v. Holder, the Fourth \nCircuit held that the term “involving” is unambiguous under Step One because it is used as part \nof a term of art with long-settled meaning.  669 F.3d 472, 482 (4th Cir. 2012); cf. Aurora \nPacking Co. v. NLRB, 904 F.2d 73, 75 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (holding that Chevron deference does \nnot apply to agency’s interpretation of “employee” where Congress intended the term to \nincorporate “common law agency principles”).  Courts interpreting statutes in a wide range of \ncircumstances have treated settled interpretations that exist upon enactment as part of the “plain \nmeaning” of the statute.  Harris v. Garner, 216 F.3d 970, 973-975 (11th Cir. 2000) (“plain \nmeaning” requires interpreting statutory term in line with settled meaning at the time of \nenactment) (citing Commissioner v. Keystone Consol. Indus., Inc., 508 U.S. 152, 159 (1993)).  \nThis principle applies in full force to administrative constructions.  See Commissioner v. Noel’s \nEstate, 380 U.S. 678, 682 (1965) (“longstanding administrative interpretation” not addressed by \nsubsequent re-enactments and amendments to statute, has “received congressional approval and \nhas the effect of law”).  \nThus, Plaintiffs correctly argue that Congress’s use of “persecution” is unambiguous for \npurposes of Step One if it incorporates prior judicial or administrative constructions of the \n“unable or unwilling” standard.   \n9 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 81   Filed 10/02/18   Page 17 of 23\nC.  Matter of A-B- Merits Deference Only To The Extent It Is A Reasonable \nConstruction Of The Statute  \nPlaintiffs also correctly rely on established Chevron doctrine in arguing that various \naspects of Matter of A-B- merit no deference, even if assessed under Step Two.  At the second \nstep, a court will defer to the agency’s approach if it is “based on a permissible construction of \nthe statute.”  Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842.  As in Step One, the Court needs to decide whether the \nagency’s choice stayed within its congressionally delegated bounds.  But, while Step One looks \nto whether Congress clearly addressed a specific issue or left a gap for the agency to fill, Step \nTwo looks to whether, in filling that gap, the agency’s interpretation was reasonable and not \narbitrary.  See City of Arlington v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 307 (2013) (“[W]here Congress has \nestablished an ambiguous line, the agency can go no further than the ambiguity will fairly \nallow.”); Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. Daley, 209 F.3d 747, 755 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (Step Two \ndoes not allow a court to “rubber stamp agency actions” because to do so would be “tantamount \nto abdicating the judiciary’s responsibility under the Administrative Procedure Act”) (quoting \nA.L. Pharma, Inc. v. Shalala, 62 F.3d 1484, 1491 (D.C. Cir. 1995)).  The Step Two inquiry thus \noverlaps with the question whether an agency action is arbitrary and capricious.  See Judulang v. \nHolder, 565 U.S. 42, 52 n.7 (2011) (Step Two analysis asks “whether an agency interpretation is \narbitrary or capricious in substance”) (internal quotation marks omitted); Northpoint Tech., Ltd. \nv. FCC, 412 F.3d 145, 151 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (same); Ronald M. Levin, The Anatomy of Chevron: \nStep Two Reconsidered, 72 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 1253, 1268 (1997) (noting overlap). \nUnder Step Two, the Court again employs the traditional tools of statutory interpretation, \nincluding the text, statutory structure, and practical implications of the agency’s interpretation on \nthe statutory scheme as a whole.  See, e.g., District of Columbia, 819 F.3d at 454 (agency’s \ninterpretation was “unreasonable in light of the statute’s text, structure, and purpose” because it \n10 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 81   Filed 10/02/18   Page 18 of 23\nsignificantly expanded the reach of the statute and had other practical results inconsistent with \nthe statute as “long understood”).  This approach reflects the core Chevron theory that statutory \ngaps are a delegation of authority to the agency to answer a specific question in a reasonable \nway.  See Negusie v. Holder, 555 U.S. 511, 523 (2009).  It follows from this principle that the \nagency is not authorized to address matters outside the gap, and that the agency will employ \nreasoned decision making.  It also reflects the core interpretive principle that statutes are not \ninterpreted by “look[ing] merely to a particular clause,” but are considered “in connection \nwith . . . the whole statute.”  Dada v. Mukasey, 554 U.S. 1, 16 (2008). \nThus, Plaintiffs’ arguments that aspects of Matter of A-B- are not entitled to deference \nbecause they are unreasonable are grounded in Step Two doctrine.  For example, Plaintiffs argue \nthat some of the challenged policies related to Matter of A-B- are illogical.  See, e.g., Pls.’ Mem. \n29.  “Illogic and internal inconsistency are characteristic of arbitrary and unreasonable agency \naction.”  Chamber of Commerce of United States of Am. v. Dep’t of Labor, 885 F.3d 360, 382 \n(5th Cir. 2018), judgment entered sub nom. Chamber of Commerce of Am. v. Dep’t of Labor, No. \n17-10238, 2018 WL 3301737 (5th Cir. June 21, 2018).  Likewise, Plaintiffs point to a number of \nways in which the challenged policies are inconsistent with other parts of the asylum statutes.  \nSee, e.g., Pls.’ Mem. 39-40, 43-44.  Assuming the Court does not resolve these inconsistencies at \nStep One, an interpretation is not reasonable if it is “at odds with the structure and manifest \npurpose” of the statute.  Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass’ns, 531 U.S. 457, 486 (2001) (invalidating \nstatute under Step Two); Daley, 209 F.3d at 755 (interpretation that conflicts with goals of \nstatute and lacked reasoned analysis fails at Step Two).  Finally, a statute is also unreasonable if \nit represents an “unexplained departure from prior [agency] policy and practice.”  Northpoint \nTech., 412 F.3d at 156 (interpretation that represents unexplained prior departure held \n11 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 81   Filed 10/02/18   Page 19 of 23\nunreasonable); Comcast Corp. v. FCC, 600 F.3d 642, 659 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (interpretation of \nstatute unreasonable where it “depart[ed] from prior policy sub silentio”) (quoting FCC v. Fox \nTelevision Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009)).  Thus, Plaintiffs’ arguments that various \npolicies related to Matter of A-B- fail because they are unreasonable are grounded in established \nprinciples of Chevron and statutory interpretation.  \nII.  THE GUIDANCE DIRECTING ASYLUM OFFICERS TO DISREGARD ALL \nCIRCUIT PRECEDENT CONTRARY TO MATTER OF A-B- VIOLATES \nBRAND X \nPlaintiffs likewise invoke well-established principles of administrative law in arguing that \nthe Guidance, which implements Matter of A-B- and directs asylum officers to “apply the case \nlaw of the relevant federal circuit court, [only] to the extent that those cases are not inconsistent \nwith Matter of A-B-,” improperly ignores binding judicial authority.  See Guidance at 8.  An \nagency interpretation of a statute can trump a prior judicial construction only if, at Step One, a \ncourt concludes that Congress left a gap for the agency to fill.  Brand X, 545 U.S. at 982.4  This \nis because, if a statute is unambiguous, it “contains no gap for the agency to fill,” and an agency \ninterpretation gets no deference.  Id. at 983; see also Fernandez v. Keisler, 502 F.3d 337, 347 \n(4th Cir. 2007) (“Chevron step one remains Chevron step one after Brand X”) (quoting Chevron, \n467 U.S. at 842).  And even if a statute has been deemed ambiguous, Brand X permits the Court \nto defer to an agency’s interpretation only if the interpretation is reasonable.5  See, e.g., Gonzales \n                                                 \n4 Brand X also does not apply if an agency decision “is not an interpretation of any statutory \nlanguage.”  Judulang, 565 U.S. at 52 n.7. \n5 Courts have also suggested that only the judiciary – and not agencies – have authority to \ndetermine whether Brand X applies.  See, e.g., De Niz Robles v. Lynch, 803 F.3d 1165, 1174 n.7 \n(10th Cir. 2015) (Gorsuch, J.) (“An agency in the Chevron step two/Brand X scenario may \nenforce its new policy judgment only with judicial approval.”); Garfias-Rodriguez v. Holder, \n702 F.3d 504, 514 n.7 (9th Cir. 2012) (explaining that even under Brand X, the courts “still retain \nultimate authority to determine whether to defer to the agency’s interpretation”).  To the extent \nthat the Guidance directs officers to apply Matter of A-B-, notwithstanding any potential judicial \n12 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 81   Filed 10/02/18   Page 20 of 23\nv. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 508 F.3d 1227, 1241 (9th Cir. 2007) (explaining that for a BIA \ninterpretation to be entitled to Chevron deference under Brand X, the interpretation must be \nreasonable); cf. NLRB v. New Vista Nursing & Rehab., 870 F.3d 113, 135 n. 14 (3d Cir. 2017) \n(explaining in dicta that “Chevron or Brand X deference would not allow us to adopt an \nunreasonable interpretation”).   \nIn ruling on the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims for relief, this Court should recognize that \nMatter of A-B-, as implemented through the Guidance, cannot trump prior judicial precedent to \nthe extent that the Attorney General has attempted to interpret unambiguous terms.  Brand X, \n545 U.S. at 982.  In the alternative, if the Court determines that aspects of Matter of A-B- fail at \nStep Two, then Brand X does not authorize the agency to reject the relevant circuit authority.  \nSee United States v. Eurodif S. A., 555 U.S. 305, 316 (2009) (noting that, even under Brand X, a \ncourt need not accept an agency’s “unreasonable resolution of language that is ambiguous”). \nMoreover, to the extent that the Attorney General has opined in Matter Of A-B- on \nmatters that are not dispositive to his decision, these views are mere dicta.  See In re Sealed \nCase, 449 F.3d 118, 123 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (explaining that language in an opinion is dicta if it is \nunnecessary to the “disposition of the case”).  Several courts have not granted Chevron deference \nto dicta in agency opinions.  See, e.g., Mercy Home Health v. Leavitt, 436 F.3d 370, 379 (3d Cir. \n2006) (dismissing an agency determination as “mere dicta”); SEC v. Baker, No. A-12-CA-285-\nSS, 2012 WL 5499497, at *11 (W.D. Tex. Nov. 13, 2012) (assigning no deference to “agency \nequivalents of dicta”); but see Fitzpatrick v. Morgan S., Inc., 261 F. Supp. 2d 978, 986 (W.D. \nTenn. 2003) (explaining that “[a]lthough [the agency’s] statement [was in] dicta . . . it carries \n                                                 \nopinion to the contrary, such policies have been “roundly ‘condemned’ by every circuit that has \naddressed the issue.” Grant Med. Ctr. v. Burwell, 204 F. Supp. 3d 68, 79 (D.D.C. 2016) (citing \ncases from the Second, Third, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and D.C. Circuits). \n13 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 81   Filed 10/02/18   Page 21 of 23\nsignificant weight” and citing to Chevron).  No exception applies for agency decisions in the \nimmigration context.  See Velazquez-Herrera v. Gonzales, 466 F.3d 781 (9th Cir. 2006); see also \nFlorentino-Francisco v. Lynch, 611 F. App’x 936, 937 n.2 (10th Cir. 2015) (finding that dicta in \na BIA opinion is “not precedential”).  In Velazquez-Herrera, the Ninth Circuit considered \nwhether to defer to the BIA’s interpretation of “child abuse” for purposes of the INA.  466 F.3d \nat 782.  The BIA had previously defined this statutory term “in another context” where its \ninterpretation was “dictum not essential to the Board’s holding.”  Id.  The Ninth Circuit did not \ndefer, because this “dictum” did not “constitute[] ‘a statutory interpretation that carries the ‘force \nof law.’”  Id. at 783 (quoting Miranda Alvarado v. Gonzales, 449 F.3d 915, 922 (9th Cir. 2006)).  \nSuch reasoning accords with the dictates of Chevron, which permit agency deference only when \nan agency “set[s] out with a lawmaking pretense in mind.”  Mead Corp., 533 U.S. at 233.  Brand \nX does not permit agencies to rely on dicta in administrative opinions and ignore binding circuit \nauthority.  \nCONCLUSION \nIn Matter of A-B- and the Guidance, the Attorney General asks the Court to ignore the \nChevron framework in favor of blanket deference.  The Court should reject this claim of \nexpansive agency powers and instead faithfully apply each step of the well-established Chevron \nframework to each statutory question the Attorney General addresses.  \n   \n14 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 81   Filed 10/02/18   Page 22 of 23\n  Respectfully submitted, \n   \n  /s/ Derek T.

Accordingly, \nthe Court PERMANENTLY ENJOINS defendants and their \nagents from applying these policies with respect to \ncredible fear determinations, credible fear \ninterviews, or credible fear review hearings issued \nor conducted by asylum officers or immigration \njudges. Defendants shall provide written guidance or \ninstructions to all asylum officers and immigration \njudges whose duties include issuing or conducting \ncredible fear determinations, credible fear \ninterviews, or credible fear review hearings, \ncommunicating that each of the credible fear \npolicies specified in paragraphs 1.a. through 1.f. \nare vacated and enjoined and therefore shall not be \napplied to any such credible fear proceedings. \n \n \n3.

To facilitate such \nplaintiffs’ return to the United States, defendants shall \nmeet and confer with plaintiffs’ counsel within 7 days to \ndevelop a schedule and plan to carry out this portion of \nthe injunction. To ensure compliance with this \ninjunction, any new credible fear process provided \npursuant to this paragraph shall be accompanied by a \nwritten record consistent with 8 U.S.C. § \n1225(b)(1)(B)(iii). Defendants shall work in good faith \nto carry out the relief ordered in this paragraph and \nshall communicate periodically with plaintiffs’ counsel \nuntil the relief ordered in this paragraph is completed. \n \n \n6.

Within 30 days and \n60 days of this Order, defendants shall provide \nplaintiffs with a status report detailing any subsequent \nsteps taken to comply with this injunction in the time \nperiod since the last report, including copies of all \nguidance and instructions sent to asylum officers and \nimmigration judges pursuant to paragraph 2 above during \nthat time frame. \n \nThe Court GRANTS plaintiffs’ cross-motion for summary \njudgment as to their Administrative Procedure Act, \nImmigration and Nationality Act, and Refugee Act challenges \nconcerning each of the policies enumerated in paragraphs \n1.a. through 1.f. above, and defendants’ motion for summary \njudgment is DENIED as to these same claims. The Court \nDENIES plaintiffs’ cross-motion for summary judgment as to \ntheir challenges concerning nexus and discretion, and \ndefendants’ motion for summary judgment is GRANTED as to \nthese same claims. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01853-EGS   Document 105   Filed 12/19/18   Page 5 of 6\nFurthermore, consistent with the accompanying \nMemorandum Opinion, the Court GRANTS plaintiffs’ motion to \nconsider extra record evidence with respect to evidence \nrelevant to plaintiffs’ contentions that the government \ndeviated from prior policies, as well as evidence relevant \nto plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief. Accordingly, \nthe following evidence submitted by plaintiffs is admitted \ninto the record, and defendants’ motion to strike is DENIED \nwith respect to this same evidence: Decl. of Sarah Mujahid \n(“Mujahid Decl.”), ECF No. 10-3, Exs.

Except for the following, all par-\nties, intervenors, and amici appearing before the district court and in this court \nare listed in the Brief for Appellants. \nAmicus in support of Appellees is the United Nations High Commis-\nsioner for Refugees.  Pursuant to Rule 26.1 of the Federal Rules of Appellate \nProcedure, and Circuit Rule 26.1, amicus United Nations High Commissioner \nfor Refugees certifies that it is not a corporation, it has no parent corporation, \nand no publicly held corporation owns ten percent or more of its stock. \n(B)  Rulings Under Review.

Doc. A/RES/428(V) ¶ 1 (Dec. 14, \n1950).  UNHCR fulfills its mandate by, among other things, “[p]romoting the \nconclusion and ratification of international conventions for the protection of \nrefugees, supervising their application and proposing amendments thereto.”  \nId. ¶ 8(a).  UNHCR’s supervisory responsibility is also reflected in the Pream-\nble and Article 35 of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, July \n28, 1951, 189 U.N.T.S. 137 (“1951 Convention”)2 and Article 2 of the Protocol \n                                           \n1 This amicus brief does not constitute a waiver, express or implied, of any \nprivilege or immunity that UNHCR and its staff enjoy under applicable inter-\nnational legal instruments and recognized principles of international law.  See \nU.N. General Assembly, Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the \nUnited Nations, Feb. 13, 1946, 1 U.N.T.S. 15, http://www.refworld.org/do-\ncid/3ae6b3902.html. \n2 <http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html> \n1 \n \n\nRelating to the Status of Refugees, Jan. 31, 1967, 606 U.N.T.S. 267 (“1967 Pro-\ntocol”).3  Those instruments obligate States to cooperate with UNHCR in the \nexercise of its mandate and to facilitate its supervisory role. \nUNHCR, which has won two Nobel Peace Prizes for its efforts, works in \nsome 130 countries, at a time when there are 70.8 million people affected by \nforced displacement worldwide.  The views of UNHCR are informed by its \nclose to seven decades of experience supervising the treaty-based system of \nrefugee protection.  UNHCR’s interpretation of the provisions of the 1951 \nConvention and its 1967 Protocol are both authoritative and integral to pro-\nmoting consistency in the global regime for the international protection of ref-\nugees.  Accordingly, the “Supreme Court has consistently turned [to UNHCR] \nfor assistance in interpreting [U.S.] obligations under the Refugee Conven-\ntion.”  N-A-M- v. Holder, 587 F.3d 1052, 1061-62 (10th Cir. 2009) (Henry, J., \nconcurring) (per curiam); see, e.g., Negusie v. Holder, 555 U.S. 511, 536-37 \n(2009); INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 439 (1987). \nUNHCR exercises its supervisory responsibility in part by issuing in-\nterpretative guidelines on the meaning of international refugee instruments, \n                                           \n3 <http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html> \n2 \n \n\nin particular the 1951 Convention and its 1967 Protocol.  The UNHCR Hand-\nbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status, U.N. Doc. \nHCR/1P/4/ENG/REV.3 (1979, re-edited Jan. 1992; reissued Dec. 2011, re-is-\nsued Feb. 2019) (“Handbook”),4 represents the first such comprehensive guid-\nance.  The Supreme Court has noted that the Handbook provides “significant \nguidance in construing the [1967] Protocol, to which Congress sought to con-\nform . . . [and] has been widely considered useful in giving content to the obli-\ngations that the protocol establishes.”  Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 439 n.22.  \nAt the request of States, including the United States, and in the exercise of the \nOffice’s supervisory responsibility, the Handbook has subsequently been com-\nplemented by the UNHCR Guidelines on International Protection and vari-\nous Guidance Notes. \nUNHCR has a specific interest in this matter because the Attorney Gen-\neral’s decision in Matter of A-B-, 27 I. & N. Dec. 316 (A.G. 2018), and the \nUSCIS Policy Memorandum (“new policies”), which rely on Matter of A-B-, \nare at variance with UNHCR’s authoritative interpretation of States’ obliga-\ntions under the 1951 Convention and 1967 Protocol in several key respects.  In \n                                           \n4 <http://www.unhcr.org/3d58e13b4.html> \n3 \n \n\nparticular,  the  new  policies,  and  Matter  of  A-B-  decision,  diverge  from \nUNHCR’s interpretations of (1) the standard used to assess whether states \nare “unable or unwilling” to provide effective protection against non-state \nagents of persecution, and (2) the definition of a “particular social group.” \nConsistent with its approach in other cases, UNHCR takes no position \ndirectly on the merits of Appellees’ asylum claims. \nSTATUTES AND REGULATIONS \nAll applicable statutes and regulations are contained in the Briefs for \nAppellants and Appellees, respectively.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nIt is undisputed that persecution on account of one’s membership in a \nparticular social group can form the basis for an asylum claim.  Moreover, un-\nder both international and domestic law, persecution forming the basis for an \nasylum claim may be perpetrated by non-state actors.  Applying these princi-\nples, other States with significant jurisprudence on refugee status determina-\ntion, such as Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, have \nconcluded that victims of domestic and gang violence may qualify for asylum \non account of their membership in a particular social group.   \n4 \n \n\nUnder the new policies at issue and Matter of A-B-, however, victims of \nviolence by non-state actors, including victims of domestic and gang violence, \nare not generally eligible for asylum.  This decision interprets the refugee def-\ninition in a manner at odds with the United States’ international obligations in \nseveral respects. \nFirst, Matter of A-B- recasts the “unable or unwilling” standard for non-\nstate actors into one requiring “complete helplessness” or “condoned” action.  \nThe proper inquiry under international standards is whether the state is inef-\nfective in combatting the persecutory practices or otherwise tolerates such \npersecution.  Victims of domestic and gang violence, particularly in Central \nAmerica, as documented by country conditions, may be able to meet this cor-\nrect articulation of the standard. \nSecond, Matter of A-B- misconstrues the requirement for defining a par-\nticular social group.  As an initial matter, under international law, members of \na particular social group must show either that they share common character-\nistics beyond their persecution, or that they are perceived as a discrete group \nby society.  U.S. law impermissibly requires both, and Matter of A-B- departs \neven further from international legal standards by misapplying each of those \nrequirements to victims of domestic violence.  Contrary to Matter of A-B- and \n5 \n \n\nthe new policies, women in domestic relationships share common characteris-\ntics beyond their persecution, and are often perceived as discrete, subordinate \ngroups by their societies.  And in further contrast to Matter of A-B-, the size \nof a particular social group is irrelevant under international law. \nARGUMENT \nI.  THE UNITED STATES IS BOUND BY THE 1951 CONVENTION \nAND  ITS  1967  PROTOCOL  RELATING  TO  THE  STATUS  OF \nREFUGEES \nThe 1951 Convention and its 1967 Protocol are the key international in-\nstruments governing the protection of refugees.  These documents address \nwho is a refugee, his or her rights and responsibilities, and the corresponding \nlegal obligations of States.  The 1967 Protocol binds parties to comply with the \nsubstantive provisions of Articles 2 through 34 of the 1951 Convention with \nrespect to “refugees” as defined in Article 1A(2) of the 1951 Convention.  1967 \nProtocol art. 1(1)-(2).  The 1967 Protocol also removes the geographic and tem-\nporal limitations from the 1951 Convention definition, thus universalizing the \nrefugee definition.  Id. art. 1(2)-(3).  The core of both the 1951 Convention and \nits 1967 Protocol is the principle of non-refoulement, which obliges States not \nto return a refugee to any country where he or she would face persecution or \n6 \n \n\na real risk of serious harm.5  In 1968, the United States acceded to the 1967 \nProtocol,6 binding itself to the international refugee protection regime and the \ndefinition of a refugee in the 1951 Convention. \nCongress enacted the Refugee Act of 1980, Pub. L. No. 96-212, 94 Stat. \n102 (1980), to “bring United States refugee law into conformance with the 1967 \nUnited Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees,” Cardoza-Fon-\nseca, 480 U.S. at 436-37 & n.19 (citing H.R. Rep. No. 96-781, at 19); see also \nINS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415, 427 (1999).  The Refugee Act brings the \nUnited States into compliance with its international obligations under the 1967 \nProtocol and, by extension, the 1951 Convention.

AS  RECOGNIZED  BY  U.S.  AND  FOREIGN  COURTS,  UNHCR \nPROVIDES  AUTHORITATIVE  GUIDANCE  IN  EVALUATING \nCLAIMS OF PERSECUTION BY NON-STATE ACTORS \nUNHCR exercises its supervisory responsibility by issuing interpretive \nguidance on the meaning of provisions in the 1951 Convention and its 1967 \nProtocol.  Numerous courts, including the Supreme Court, have turned to \nUNHCR’s guidance for interpreting the 1951 Convention and 1967 Protocol.  \nCardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 438-39; Bringas-Rodriguez v. Sessions, 850 \nF.3d 1051, 1060-61 (9th Cir. 2017) (en banc).  The most authoritative of this \nguidance is the UNHCR Handbook, which was prepared in 1979 at the request \nof Member States, including the United States.  Although the Handbook is not \nlegally binding upon U.S. officials, it provides “significant guidance” in con-\nstruing the 1967 Protocol and in giving content to the obligations established \ntherein.  Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 439 n.22; see also Garcia v. Sessions, \n856 F.3d 27, 55 n.31 (1st Cir. 2017). \n8 \n \n\nIn 2002, UNHCR also began issuing a number of Guidelines,7 which \nhave been welcomed by UNHCR’s Executive Committee and the UN General \nAssembly.  The Guidelines complement and update the Handbook by drawing \nupon international legal standards, judicial decisions, Executive Committee \nConclusions,  academic  literature,  and  UNHCR’s  views  and  experience.  \nUNHCR also issues Guidance Notes to provide additional direction in specific \nareas.  Courts have relied upon the Guidelines and Guidance Notes in as-\nsessing refugee claims, recognizing that UNHCR’s “analysis provides signifi-\ncant guidance for issues of refugee law.”  Mohammed v. Gonzales, 400 F.3d \n785, 798 (9th Cir. 2005); Bringas-Rodriguez, 850 F.3d at 1071. \nApplied here, the Handbook, Guidelines, and Guidance Notes affirm \nthe well-settled principle that persecution by non-state actors may give rise to \nan asylum claim.  The Handbook recognizes that asylum may be warranted by \npersecution “emanat[ing] from sections of the population . . . [whose] serious \ndiscriminatory or other offensive acts . . . are knowingly tolerated by the au-\nthorities, or if the authorities refuse, or prove unable, to offer effective protec-\ntion.”  Handbook ¶ 65.  Non-state actors of persecution include “paramilitary \n                                           \n7 UNHCR, Agenda for Protection, U.N. Doc.

VIOLENCE  BY NON-STATE  ACTORS,  AND  IN  PARTICULAR, \nDOMESTIC  AND  GANG  VIOLENCE,  CAN  FORM  THE  BASIS \nFOR ASYLUM \nThe new policies direct that, “[i]n general, . . . claims based on member-\nship in a putative particular social group defined by the members’ vulnerability \nto harm of domestic violence or gang violence committed by non-government \nactors will not establish the basis for asylum [or] refugee status.”  USCIS \nGuidance at 6.  This directive is premised on the former Attorney General’s \nguidance in Matter of A-B-, which states that, “[g]enerally, claims by aliens \npertaining to domestic violence or gang violence perpetrated by non-govern-\nmental actors will not qualify for asylum.”  27 I. & N. Dec. at 320.  That guid-\nance diverges from UNHCR guidance, international case law, and U.S. case \nlaw.  Departure from this well-settled and foundational legal principle is due \nto erroneous interpretations of (a) the “unable or unwilling” standard, and (b) \nthe “particular social group” definition.  The elevated standards that Matter \nof A-B- imposes with respect to these elements impermissibly impede asylum \nclaims by victims of persecution.  \n14 \n \n\nA.  Matter of A-B- and the New Policies Erroneously State that \nDomestic and Gang Violence Claims Do Not Meet the “Unable \nor Unwilling” Standard   \nFor violence perpetrated by non-state actors to constitute persecution, \nan individual must demonstrate that the state is “unable or unwilling” to pro-\nvide adequate protection to victims.  UNHCR, Guidance Note on Refugee \nClaims Relating to Victims of Organized Gangs ¶ 25 (Mar. 2010) (“Gang \nNote”) (emphasis omitted);22 see Gender Guidelines ¶ 19; Conflict and Vio-\nlence Guidelines ¶ 30.  Such a determination requires a “[h]olistic and [i]nte-\ngrated [a]nalysis” and “judicious balancing” of several factors, including “the \ngeneral state of law, order and justice in the country, and its effectiveness, \nincluding the resources available and the ability and willingness to use them \nproperly and effectively to protect residents.”  UNHCR, Interpreting Article \n1 of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees ¶¶ 7, 15 (Apr. 2001) \n(“Interpreting 1951 Convention”).23   \nThe new policies upend this holistic analysis.  They require asylum-seek-\ners to show that “the government condoned the private actions or at least \n                                           \n22 <http://www.refworld.org/docid/4bb21fa02.html>  \n23 <http://www.refworld.org/docid/3b20a3914.html> \n15 \n \n\ndemonstrated a complete helplessness to protect the victim[].”  USCIS Guid-\nance at 6; Matter of A-B-, 27 I. & N. Dec. at 337.  “The mere fact that a country \n. . . has problems effectively policing certain crimes, like domestic violence or \ngang-related activities . . . cannot, by itself, establish eligibility for asylum.”  \nUSCIS Guidance at 6.  In other words, under that decision, occasional, piece-\nmeal, or partial protection by a state will negate an asylum claim, even if the \nstate is unable or unwilling to prevent violence in the vast majority of cases.  \nThis unduly narrow construction of the “unable or unwilling” standard signif-\nicantly diverges from the United States’ international obligations.   \n1.  The New Policies and Matter of A-B- Are Inconsistent \nwith the Settled Meaning of the “Unable or Unwilling” \nStandard \nThe hallmark of state protection is the state’s ability to provide effective \nprotection, which requires effective control of non-state actors.  See Handbook \n¶ 65 (acts constitute persecution “if they are knowingly tolerated by the au-\nthorities, or if the authorities refuse, or prove unable, to offer effective protec-\ntion”); see also Interpreting 1951 Convention ¶ 15 (providing that a state’s \nability to offer effective protection measured by “the general state of law, or-\nder and justice in the country, and its effectiveness, including the resources \navailable and the ability and willingness to use them properly and effectively \n16 \n \n\nto protect residents”).  State protection is ineffective where, for example, “the \npolice fail to respond to requests for protection or the authorities refuse to \ninvestigate, prosecute or punish (non-State) perpetrators of violence . . . with \ndue diligence.”  Sexual Orientation Guidelines ¶¶ 34-37.   \nMerely enacting a law prohibiting persecutory practices is not enough:  \n“Even though a particular State may have prohibited a persecutory practice \n. . . , the State may nevertheless . . . not be able to stop the practice effectively.”  \nGender Guidelines ¶ 11 (emphasis omitted).  Despite best intentions and ef-\nforts, there may be an incongruity between avowed commitments and reality \non the ground.  Effective protection depends on both de jure and de facto ca-\npability by the authorities.   \nFor example, in determining whether a state offers effective protection \nfrom human trafficking, UNHCR notes:   \nWhether the authorities in the country of origin are able to protect \nvictims or potential victims of trafficking will depend on whether \nlegislative and administrative mechanisms have been put in place \nto prevent and combat trafficking, as well as to protect and assist \nthe victims and on whether these mechanisms are effectively im-\nplemented in practice. \n \nUNHCR, Guidelines on International Protection No. 7:  The Application of \nArticle 1A(2) of the 1951 Convention and/or 1967 Protocol Relating to the Sta-\n17 \n \n\ntus of Refugees to Victims of Trafficking and Persons at Risk of Being Traf-\nficked ¶ 22, U.N. Doc. HCR/GIP/06/07 (Apr. 7, 2006);24 see also Interpreting \n1951 Convention ¶ 15 (ability to provide effective protection requires examin-\ning “the general state of law, order and justice in the country, and its effective-\nness, including the resources available and the ability and willingness to use \nthem properly and effectively to protect residents”).  \nConsistent with UNHCR’s interpretation, other parties to the 1951 Con-\nvention and 1967 Protocol do not require complete helplessness and recognize \nviolence by non-state actors  as persecution whenever state protection is inef-\nfective.  See, e.g., Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, Chairperson’s \nGuideline 9:  Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and \nGender Identity and Expression ¶ 8.6.5 (May 1, 2017) (instructing Canadian \ndecision-makers to “carefully assess[] . . . the degree of actual implementation, \nthe effectiveness, and the durability of” protection); United Kingdom Immi-\ngration Appellate Authority, Asylum Gender Guidelines ¶¶ 2B.2-3 (Nov. 1, \n                                           \n24 <http://www.refworld.org/docid/443679fa4.html> \n18 \n \n\n2000) (setting forth United Kingdom’s “practical standard,” that protection be \n“meaningful, accessible, effective, and available to a woman”).25 \nTurning the “unable or unwilling” requirement into a “condoned” or \n“complete helplessness” requirement significantly departs from this settled \ninternational standard.  The new policies make the “unable or unwilling” prong \nmore difficult to meet, and the heightened test lacks any support in interna-\ntional law.  A state does not have to “condone” private violence to be “unwill-\ning” or “unable” to offer protection, nor does a victim need to show the state’s \n“complete helplessness” for state protection to be unavailable or ineffective. \nThe First Circuit recently determined as much in Rosales Justo v. Ses-\nsions, 895 F.3d 154 (1st Cir. 2018).  Although the Mexican government had \ndisplayed a “willingness to investigate” the murder of the applicant’s family \nmember by non-governmental actors, its “efforts to investigate” could not \nguarantee that the applicant could be made safer or that the state would catch \nthe perpetrators.  Id. at 159, 163, 164.  Overruling the Board, the Court deter-\n                                           \n25 <http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6b3414.html> \n19 \n \n\nmined that the specific ineffectiveness of the Mexican government in prevent-\ning violence against the applicant met the “unwilling or unable” standard.  Id. \nat 163-65. \n2.  Domestic and Gang Violence Claims Can Meet the “Un-\nable or Unwilling” Standard \nMatter of A-B- and the new policies’ erroneous approach to the “unable \nor unwilling” standard is all the more pronounced in the domestic and gang \nviolence contexts and runs counter to UNHCR’s on-the-ground experience.   \nUNHCR has field offices in the vast majority of originating countries for \nasylum-seekers.  Relying on in-depth research from these offices, material \nfrom independent country specialists, and other sources, UNHCR has care-\nfully compiled country-specific Eligibility Guidelines.  The Eligibility Guide-\nlines rigorously analyze factors relevant to asylum determinations, including \nthe effectiveness of state protection.26    \nBased on its decades-long presence in countries affected by gang vio-\nlence, UNHCR encourages decision-makers to examine “efforts to reform and \n                                           \n26  See  Affidavit  of  Janice  Lyn  Marshall,  Staten  v/Utlendingsnemnda \n(Regjeringsadvokaten) v. A, B, C, D, Oct. 26, 2015 (Nor.), https://www.ref-\nworld.org/docid/562f546c4.html (detailing methodology). \n20 \n \n\nexpand  the  criminal  justice  system[,]  establish[]  witness  protection  pro-\ngrammes,” and—conversely—the “lack of measures to ensure security to in-\ndividuals at risk of harm by gangs.”  Gang Note ¶ 28.  “The [s]tate [may] prove \nunable to provide effective protection,” especially when gangs “yield consider-\nable power and capacity to evade law enforcement or when the corruption is \npervasive.”  Id. ¶ 25.  Likewise, the state “may be unwilling to protect a par-\nticular individual, for instance, because of their own financial interest in the \ngang activities or because they consider the person associated with or targeted \nby the gangs unworthy of protection.”  Id.  \nIn El Salvador, for example, gangs “exercise extraordinary levels of so-\ncial control over the population of their territories.”  UNHCR, Eligibility \nGuidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs of Asylum-Seek-\ners from El Salvador at 12, U.N. Doc. HCR/EG/SLV/16/01 (Mar. 15, 2016) (“El \nSalvador Guidelines”).27  Despite the formal existence of an anti-gang legal \nframework, “weakness and corruption” in the police and judiciary “contribute \nto creating a high level of impunity for crimes in El Salvador.”  Id. at 23; see \nalso U.S. State Dep’t, El Salvador 2017 Human Rights Report at 15 (“U.S. \n                                           \n27 <http://www.refworld.org/docid/56e706e94.html> \n21 \n \n\nState Dep’t, El Salvador Report”).  In gang-controlled territories, “the po-\nlice—even the elite Anti-Gang Unit in high-profile cases—are usually not seen \nas offering a sufficient form of protection . . . , since their presence is only tem-\nporary and gangs will return once the police move on after a few hours or \ndays.”  El Salvador Guidelines at 24; see U.S. State Dep’t, El Salvador Report \nat 19 (“The major gangs controlled their own territory.  Gang members did \nnot allow persons living in another gang’s controlled area to enter their terri-\ntory.”).  Gangs have their own infiltrators in the police and military, who warn \nabout anti-gang operations and have access to weapons and uniforms.  El Sal-\nvador Guidelines at 23.  \nGangs’ “extraordinary levels of social control” and the state’s corre-\nsponding ineffectiveness in combating gang-related crimes are also pervasive \nin other Central American countries.  See UNHCR, Eligibility Guidelines for \nAssessing the International Protection Needs of Asylum-Seekers from Hon-\nduras at 18-19, 38-39, U.N. Doc. HCR/EG/HND/16/03 (July 27, 2016) (“Hon-\nduras Guidelines”) (police are “not usually seen as offering a sufficient form \nof protection for residents who are threatened by gangs” and are “reported to \nacknowledge their fear at the inability of the State to protect them from assas-\n22 \n \n\nsination when they are off duty”);28 UNHCR, Eligibility Guidelines for As-\nsessing the International Protection Needs of Asylum-Seekers from Guate-\nmala at 34, U.N. Doc. HCR/EG/GTM/18/01 (Jan. 2018)29 (“[I]n certain parts of \nthe country the Government has lost effective control to gangs and other or-\nganized criminal groups and is unable to provide protection to inhabitants.”). \nEqually, domestic violence victims often do not receive effective protec-\ntion from the state.  In some Central American societies, “[i]mpunity for vio-\nlence against women and girls remain a serious problem.”  Honduras Guide-\nlines at 39.  The high impunity rate contributes to victims’ “lack of confidence \nin . . . an ineffective and unsupportive justice system,” thus preventing them \nfrom even reporting domestic violence incidents to the authorities.  El Salva-\ndor Guidelines at 25.  The state’s ineffective protection against domestic vio-\nlence is often exacerbated by its inability to protect against gang violence.  In \na study of 160 women from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico, \nUNHCR found that women “consistently stated that police and state law en-\nforcement authorities were [unable] to provide sufficient protection from [] vi-\nolence.”  UNHCR, Women on the Run:  First-Hand Accounts of Refugees \n                                           \n28 <http://www.refworld.org/docid/579767434.html> \n29 <http://www.refworld.org/docid/5a5e03e96.html> \n23 \n \n\nFleeing El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico at 25 (Oct. 26, 2015) \n(“Women on the Run”).  Many of the women’s partners were gang members \nor associates.  Id. at 25.  “[B]ecause these [criminal] groups were often [re-\ngarded as] the highest powers in the[] neighborhoods, [the women] did not \nbelieve the government could protect them.”  Id. \nThe above evidence reflects that—at least in some countries and in some \ninstances—states may be unable or unwilling to offer effective protection to \npersons who have been persecuted by non-state actors.  Matter of A-B- and \nthe new policies err by directing that domestic and gang violence claims gen-\nerally do not meet the “unable or unwilling” standard for obtaining asylum in \ncases of persecution by non-state actors. \nB.  Matter of A-B- and the New Policies Err in Their Interpreta-\ntion of the “Particular Social Group” Basis for Asylum  \nMatter of A-B- and the new policies change the approach to asylum \nclaims based upon “membership in a particular social group,” elevating the \nrule far beyond the international threshold.  Although “membership in a par-\nticular social group” is on its face an ambiguous term, Matter of A-B-, 27 I. & \nN. Dec. at 326, jurisprudence and commentary have over time helped clarify \nits meaning.  Based on international legal norms and State practice, UNHCR’s \n24 \n \n\nSocial Group Guidelines adopt two alternative approaches to defining a par-\nticular social group:  \n[A] particular social group is a group of persons who share a com-\nmon characteristic other than their risk of being persecuted [the \n“protected characteristics” approach], or who are perceived as a \ngroup by society [the “social perception” approach].  The charac-\nteristic will often be one which is innate, unchangeable, or which is \notherwise fundamental to identity, conscience or the exercise of \none’s human rights. \n  \nUNHCR, Guidelines on International Protection No. 2:  “Membership of a \nParticular Social Group” Within the Context of Article 1A(2) of the 1951 Con-\nvention and/or Its 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees ¶ 11, U.N. \nDoc. HCR/GIP/02/02 (May 7, 2002) (“Social Group Guidelines”) (emphasis \nomitted).30  A particular social group must be identifiable through one of the \napproaches but need not satisfy both.  Gang Note ¶ 35.  Several States have \nendorsed the “protected characteristics” approach without requiring an appli-\ncant further to show that society perceives the applicant’s group as distinct.   \nSee Canada (A.G.) v. Ward, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 689 (Can.); Islam and Shah, [1999] \nUKHL at 20; Sec’y of State for the Home Dep’t v. K (FC), and Fornah (FC) v. \nSec’y of State for the Home Dep’t [2006] UKHL 46, [2007] 1 A.C. (HL) 412 \n                                           \n30 <http://www.refworld.org/docid/3d36f23f4.html> \n25 \n \n\n(appeal taken from Eng.);31 Refugee Appeal No. 1312/93 Re GJ [1995] 1 NLR \n387 (N.Z.).32   \nThis either/or approach to identifying a particular social group was first \ndelineated in Matter of Acosta, 19 I. & N. Dec. 211, 233 (B.I.A. 1985), overruled \nin part on other grounds by Matter of Mogharrabi, 19 I. & N. Dec. 439 (B.I.A. \n1987).  It guided U.S. asylum decisions for more than twenty years, until the \nBoard diverged in 2008 by requiring asylum-seekers to prove social perception \nand particularity, in addition to protected characteristics.  Matter of S-E-G-, \n24 I. & N. Dec. 579, 582, 589 (B.I.A. 2008).  As UNHCR has repeatedly re-\nmarked, imposing these additional, heightened requirements is contrary to the \nobject and purpose of the 1951 Convention, 1967 Protocol, and Social Group \nGuidelines.33   \nMatter of A-B- amplifies this erroneous interpretation.  See 27 I. & N. \nDec. at 319, 335, 336 (rejecting asylum for “[s]ocial groups defined by their \nvulnerability to private criminal activity,” including “married women . . . who \n                                           \n31 <http://www.refworld.org/cases,GBR_HL,4550a9502.html> \n32 <http://www.refworld.org/cases,NZL_RSAA,3ae6b6938.html> \n33 See, e.g., UNHCR Amicus Curiae Br. in Supp. of Petitioner, Valdiviezo-\nGaldamez  v.  Holder  (3d  Cir.  Apr.  14,  2009),  http://www.refworld. \norg/docid/49ef25102.html. \n26 \n \n\nare unable to leave their relationships” (internal quotation marks omitted)).  It \nmaintains the additional, heightened requirements set forth in Matter of S-E-\nG-, and, alongside the new policies, it applies these requirements in a flawed \nmanner to the facts at hand.  UNHCR maintains that the current U.S. ap-\nproach—i.e., requiring protected characteristics, social perception, and par-\nticularity—is inconsistent with international law.  Even under a correct appli-\ncation of the heightened, conjunctive U.S. standard, however, UNHCR ob-\nserves that people at risk of domestic and gang violence by non-state actors \nmay nonetheless constitute members of particular social groups.   \n1.  Protected Characteristics \nThe “protected characteristics” approach examines “whether a group is \nunited by an immutable characteristic or by a characteristic that is so funda-\nmental to human dignity that a person should not be compelled to forsake it.”  \nSocial Group Guidelines ¶ 6.   \nAs to gang violence, victims resisting forced recruitment may share in-\nnate or immutable characteristics, such as age, gender, and social status.  \nGang Note ¶ 36.  To this point, a USAID study on Central American gangs \nfound that youth between the ages of 8 and 18 were particularly vulnerable to \nrecruitment.  USAID, Central America and Mexico Gang Assessment Report \n27 \n \n\n15 (Aug. 2006).42  UNHCR likewise notes that young people are more suscep-\ntible to recruitment because of their “age, impressionability, dependency, pov-\nerty and lack of parental guidance.”  Gang Note ¶ 36; Honduras Guidelines at \n15, 16.  Additionally, “[p]ast actions or experiences, such as refusal to join a \ngang, may be considered irreversible and thus immutable.”  Id. ¶ 37; Social \nGroup Guidelines ¶ 6; Matter of S-E-G-, 24 I. & N. Dec. at 584.  \nConsistent with this interpretation, parties to the 1951 Convention and \nits 1967 Protocol—including the United States—have held that gang violence \nvictims or resisters to gang recruitment may form particular social groups un-\nder the protected characteristics approach.  See Tobias Gomez, 2011 F.C. at \n1093 (innate characteristics and shared past experience); AZ, [2010] UKUT at \n118 (shared past experience); Valdiviezo-Galdamez v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 502 \nF.3d 285, 291 (3d Cir. 2007) (remanding to BIA to consider whether “young \nHonduran men who have been actively recruited by gangs and who have re-\nfused to join the gangs” constitute a particular social group; noting that group \n“shares the characteristics of other groups that the BIA has found to consti-\ntute a ‘particular social group’”). \n                                           \n42 <https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNADG834.pdf> \n28 \n \n\nAs to domestic violence, the particular social group applicable in such \ncases may be defined by sex alone or in combination with other characteristics \nrelated to relationship status.  Both groups qualify under the “protected char-\nacteristics” approach.  In UNHCR’s view, “sex can properly be within the am-\nbit of the social group category, with women being a clear example of a social \nsubset defined by innate and immutable characteristics.”  Social Group Guide-\nlines ¶ 12; Gender Guidelines ¶ 30; see also Ward, 2 S.C.R. at 739 (contem-\nplating a particular social group encompassing all women); VM (FGM-risks-\nMungiki-Kikuyu/Gikuyu) Kenya v. Sec’y of State for the Home Dep’t, CG \n[2008] UKAIT 00049 (recognizing a particular social group of “women (girls) \nin Kenya”).34 \nAlternatively, particular social groups may be defined by sex in combi-\nnation with other factors.  See, e.g., Niang, 422 F.3d at 1199.  These other fac-\ntors include relationship status, which may be unchangeable because of exter-\nnal religious, cultural, or legal constraints.  Cf. U.N. Centre for Soc. Dev. & \nHumanitarian Affairs, Violence Against Women in the Family 33, U.N. Doc. \n                                           \n34 <http://www.refworld.org/docid/484d4a222.html> \n29 \n \n\nST/CSDHA/2 (1989) (noting that men in Guatemala and El Salvador view “the \nwomen they live with [as] their possessions”).  \nMatter of A-B- erroneously holds that the proposed group in that case—\n“married women in Guatemala who are unable to leave their relationship”—is \ndefined circularly by a fear of being subject to domestic violence.  27 I. & N. at \n336.  That is incorrect. \nWhile a particular social group cannot be defined “exclusively by the \npersecution . . . or by a common fear of being persecuted,” “persecutory action \ntoward a group may be a relevant factor” in determining the contours of that \ngroup.  Social Group Guidelines ¶ 14; accord A v Minister for Immigration \n& Ethnic Affairs [1997] HCA 4 (Austl.).35  Inability to leave a relationship may \nbe caused by factors apart from the threat of harm from a domestic partner—\nbecause of cultural or religious reasons, for example.  Among other things, \nwomen in domestic relationships in Guatemala and El Salvador endure the \ntwin punishments of violence from male partners who feel “entitled to physical \nand emotional power,” and “widespread impunity for [such] acts of violence” \n                                           \n35 <http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6b7180.html> \n30 \n \n\nby their cultures.  Women on the Run at 17.36  Matter of A-B- improperly as-\nsumes that women are “unable to leave their relationship” solely on account of \ntheir fear of persecution.   \n2.  Social Perception \nThe social perception approach examines whether group members share \na common characteristic that makes them a cognizable group or sets them \napart from society at large.  Social Group Guidelines ¶ 7; see also A v Minister \n[1997] HCA at 4.   \nGang violence victims may constitute a particular social group under \nsuch an approach.  In a society “where it is risky for people to oppose gangs, \noften in closely knitted neighborhoods that are effectively controlled by gangs, \ngang resisters may be set apart in society.”  Gang Note ¶ 41.  This situation is \ncommon in Central America, where gangs exert extraordinary social control.  \nEl Salvador Guidelines at 12; Honduras Guidelines at 18, 38.  For example, \nin El Salvador, “[p]ersons who resist the authority of the local gang . . . are \nreportedly subject to swift and brutal retaliation from the gang.”  El Salvador \n                                           \n36 <http://www.refworld.org/docid/56307e2a4.html> \n31 \n \n\nGuidelines at 13.  Similar circumstances affect Hondurans.  Honduras Guide-\nlines at 18 (“Many gangs are reported to forbid inhabitants to show ‘disre-\nspect’ for the gang . . . .”). \nA particular social group defined by gender and relationship status can \nalso satisfy the social perception requirement.  See Social Group Guidelines \n¶ 7 (“[W]omen . . . have been recognized under [the social perception] analysis \nas particular social groups.”).  Being female “identif[ies] them as a group in \nsociety, subjecting them to different treatment and standards in some coun-\ntries.”    Gender  Guidelines  ¶  30;  see  also  Khawar,  [2002]  HCA  14,  ¶  35 \n(“Women in any society are a distinct and recognisable group; and their dis-\ntinctive attributes and characteristics exist independently of the manner in \nwhich they are treated, either by males or by governments.”).   \nMoreover, in certain Central American countries, the intersection of \ngender and relationship status also identifies a socially distinct group.  Women \nin domestic relationships are subjected to high rates of domestic violence while \nunder the “authority exercised by their” male partners.  El Salvador Guide-\nlines at 38.  Domestic violence against wives and partners leaves them “often \ntrapped” in the relationship, due both to the threat of further violence and to \nbroader cultural stigmas against such women.  Id. at 37.    \n32 \n \n\n3.  Particularity   \nAs to “particularity,” Matter of A-B- asserts, and the new policies reit-\nerate, that “[s]ocial groups defined by their vulnerability to private criminal \nactivity likely lack . . . particularity [because] . . . broad swaths of society may \nbe susceptible to victimization.”  27 I. & N. Dec. at 335.; see also id. (gang vio-\nlence victims “are too diffuse” to form particular social group).  That assertion \ndeparts  from  UNHCR’s  guidance  and  puts  the  “particular  social  group” \nground on unequal footing as compared to the other protected grounds for \nasylum. \nUnder prevailing international standards, the size and diffusiveness of a \nproposed group are irrelevant.  As UNHCR has explained, “The size of the \npurported social group is not a relevant criterion in determining whether a \nparticular social group exists within the meaning of Article 1A(2).”  Social \nGroup Guidelines ¶ 18; see also id. ¶ 15 (“It is widely accepted in State practice \nthat . . . there is no requirement that the group be ‘cohesive.’”).   \nThe other protected grounds for asylum are oftentimes shared by large \nsegments of society.  For example, broad swaths of society—“perhaps even . . . \na majority of the population”—may share religious or political ideologies that \nare suppressed by the state.  Id. ¶ 18.  “[M]embers of a religion or holders of a \n33 \n \n\npolitical opinion” may likewise come from all segments of society.  Id. ¶ 15.  In \nshort, there is no size or diffusiveness requirement for individuals seeking asy-\nlum on account of race, religion, nationality, or political opinion.  It makes little \nsense to impose a set of more demanding requirements for asylum on account \nof membership in a particular social group, particularly as international guid-\nance and U.S. case law embrace a “flexible” approach towards this protected \nground.  Id. ¶ 3 (“[M]embership [in] a particular social group should be read \nin an evolutionary manner, open to the diverse and changing nature of group[] \nin various societies and evolving . . . human rights norms.”); Rios v. Lynch, 807 \nF.3d 1123, 1124 (9th Cir. 2015) (particular social group is an “inherently flexi-\nble term”).  \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, UNHCR submits that the new policies and \nMatter of A-B- are at variance with the United States’ obligations under the \n1951 Convention and 1967 Protocol. \n \n \n \n \n34 \n \n\nJULY 31, 2019        Respectfully submitted, \n \n            /s/ Alexander J.

The  Amici \nStates—who together are home to the majority of this country’s successful asylum \ngrantees—have  an  interest  in  ensuring  the  availability  of  asylum-related \nprotections for individuals and families with a well-founded fear of persecution \ndue to domestic or gang-related violence.  Such protections are crucial, not only to \nthe  vulnerable  population  involved,  but  also  to  facilitating  the  substantial \ncontributions  these  individuals  make  in  the  Amici  States’  economies  and \ncommunities. \nThe Amici States are concerned that former-Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s \nprecedential opinion in Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316 (A.G. 2018), and the \nUnited  States  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Services  (“USCIS”)  policy \nmemorandum will undercut the longstanding, positive contribution made by these \nimmigrant populations.  The opinion and policy memorandum break sharply from \nprior precedent and call for the denial of asylum claims based on domestic and \ngang-related violence.  The Amici States believe that those fleeing from domestic \nand  gang-related  violence  should  continue  to  receive  a  fair  and  individualized \n \n\n \nopportunity to establish their eligibility for asylum, and that such an opportunity is \nconsistent with federal law.  If applicants with viable claims were turned away \nbefore  establishing  their  eligibility,  the  Amici  States  would  suffer  both \neconomically and culturally.  \nWhen  the  federal  government  fails  to  follow  the  law,  it  has  very  real \nconsequences  for  the  several  States.    This  is  especially  so  with  immigration \npolicy—it  shapes  the  destiny  of  the  nation,  and  of  the  individual  States.   See \nArizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 415 (2012).  It is thus vitally important to \nthe Amici States that courts police and protect the federal executive’s compliance \nwith immigration and asylum law. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n  The district court properly enjoined the United States from  applying the \npolicies set forth in Matter of A-B- and the related USCIS policy memorandum, \nwhich impermissibly heightened the standards for asylum claims. \n  The United States has an obligation to welcome those forced from their \nhomelands,  and  the  Amici  States  are  committed  to  fulfilling  that  obligation.  \nImmigrants, including asylees, are a vital part of the Amici States’ communities.  \nStates benefit immensely from immigrants who build new lives here, and the Amici \nStates strive to be places where immigrants can flourish.  Immigrants contribute, \nfor example, to state economies: they participate at every level of the workforce \n  2 \n \n\n \nand  across  all  economic  sectors.    Excluding  broad  swaths  of  people  from  the \nopportunity to seek asylum by foreclosing their claims at the credible fear stage, as \nMatter of A-B- and the policy memorandum attempt to do, diminishes the Amici \nStates’ economic and community development.   \n  In addition, state and federal governments, as well as the United Nations \nHigh Commissioner on Refugees (“UNHCR”), have all recognized the need for \nspecific  protections  against—and  programs  tailored  to  address—domestic  and \ngang-related violence.  Each of the 50 States and the District of Columbia has \nenacted civil and criminal provisions to protect victims of domestic violence, and \nthe federal government too has acknowledged the need to assist immigrant women \nsubject to domestic violence.  The guidance found in the UNHCR’s Handbook and \nGuidelines on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status (Geneva \n2011 ed.)1 makes clear that women who suffer from gender-based violence can \nqualify as refugees.  Similarly, the States and the federal government have enacted \nprograms and committed resources to preventing gang violence and ensuring that \nvictims’ rights are respected.  And the UNHCR has recognized that victims of \ngang violence may be eligible for asylum as well.  Refusing victims of domestic \nand  gang-related  violence  assistance—as  Matter  of  A-B-  and  the  policy \n                                           \n1   Available at https://tinyurl.com/yyfs6dbf. \n  3 \n \n\n \nmemorandum would require—is thus contrary to state and federal policies and \nUNHCR guidelines. \n  Domestic and gang-related violence persist at crisis levels in Guatemala, El \nSalvador, and Honduras in particular, and the victims of this violence deserve to \nestablish their eligibility for asylum and to seek protection in the States and the \nUnited States.  In 2016, those countries produced nearly 30 percent of all asylum \ngrantees.  Women and girls are distinctly targeted: El Salvador and Honduras have \nthe world’s highest rates of femicide.  Domestic violence persists there, in part, \nbecause  the  laws  prohibiting  it  are  often  poorly  enforced  or  carry  only  minor \npenalties.  Matter of A-B- and the policy memorandum deprive victims of domestic \nand  gang-related  violence  of  an  opportunity  to  show  that  their  government  is \nunable or unwilling to protect them or that they have been targeted because of \nmembership in a particular social group.  As a result, Matter of A-B- would deprive \nStates of the contributions that these victims might otherwise make if they were \ngiven  refuge  and  the  ability  to  thrive  in  our  country—all  because  the  federal \ngovernment is defying its commitment to aid eligible refugees. \nARGUMENT \nI.  Matter of A-B- And  The  Subsequent  USCIS  Guidelines  Contravene \nEstablished Federal Law. \n  Together, the policies in Matter of A-B- and the policy memorandum subvert \nlongstanding federal law, to the detriment of the States—as well as to the rule of \n  4 \n \n\n \nlaw itself.  Matter of A-B- and the policy memorandum heighten the standards used \nin expedited removal proceedings, establishing a near categorical bar to asylum \nclaims based on domestic or gang-related violence.  Because these policies may be \nused  to  illegally  foreclose  victims  of  domestic  or  gang-related  violence  from \nattaining asylum protection, the district court properly enjoined the United States \nfrom implementing them.   \nFederal  law  provides  that  “[a]ny  alien  who  is  physically  present  in  the \nUnited States or who arrives in the United States . . . irrespective of such alien’s \nstatus, may apply for asylum.”  8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1).  To qualify for asylum, the \nindividual must establish that she is a refugee, id. § 1158(b)(1)(A), meaning that \nshe is “unable or unwilling to return” to her home country “because of a well-\nfounded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership \nin  a  particular  social  group,  or  political  opinion,”  id.  § 1101(a)(42)(A).    The \napplicant need not establish a fear of certain persecution; rather, according to the \nSupreme Court, she must simply show that persecution is a reasonable possibility.  \nINS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 440 (1987).   \nEligibility  for  asylum  is  especially  important  for  migrants  reaching  the \nUnited  States  who  are  subject  to  “expedited  removal,”  a summary  deportation \nprocess without hearings or meaningful review.  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i); 8 \nC.F.R. § 235.3(b).  Persons subject to expedited removal who express a fear of \n  5 \n \n\n \nreturning to their home country or express an intent to apply for asylum must be \nreferred to an asylum officer for a “credible fear determination,” which may entitle \nthem  to referral  for regular  removal proceedings before an  immigration  judge.  \n8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii);  see  8  C.F.R.  § 235.3(b)(4);  see  also  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii),  (v);  8  U.S.C.  § 1229a.    Because  a  negative  credible  fear \ndetermination is entitled to limited review, Congress designed these interviews to \nhave a low threshold of proof.2  In 2016, for example, 75 percent of individuals \nreferred to a credible fear interview met that standard.3 \nAsylum applicants fleeing from domestic and gang-related violence often \nclaim a well-founded fear of persecution on account of their “membership in a \nparticular social group.”  8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A).  Federal courts of appeals \nhave recognized that such an applicant persecuted by non-state actors may still \nmerit asylum if she establishes that the persecution was “committed by . . . forces \nthe government is either unable or unwilling to control.”  Knezevic v. Ashcroft, 367 \n                                           \n2   See  142  Cong.  Rec.  25347  (1996)  (statement  of  Sen.  Hatch)  (“[T]he \nstandard  adopted  in  the  conference  report  is  intended  to  be  a  low  screening \nstandard for admission into the usual full asylum process.”). \n3   Nadwa Mossaad & Ryan Baugh, Refugees and Asylees: 2016 at 6 (2018), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/yxblggst.  \n  6 \n \n\n \nF.3d 1206, 1211 (9th Cir. 2014); 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A).4  Notably, in a 2014 \ndecision, Matter of A-R-C-G, 26 I&N Dec. 388 (BIA 2014), the BIA explicitly \nacknowledged that victims of domestic violence targeted because of their gender \ncould qualify for asylum under prevailing law.  Id. at 389 (holding that “married \nwomen in Guatemala who are unable to leave their relationship” was a particular \nsocial group and granting the applicant asylum). \nDespite  the  entrenched  and  widespread  recognition  of  the  validity  of \ndomestic violence and gang-related asylum claims, on June 11, 2018, Attorney \nGeneral Sessions issued Matter of A-B-, a precedential opinion that reversed the \nBIA’s grant of asylum to an El Salvadoran woman who was brutalized by her \nhusband.  27 I&N Dec. at 321, 346.  The opinion overruled the BIA’s decision in \nMatter of A-R-C-G- and proposed that few claims based on domestic or gang-\nrelated violence perpetrated by non-governmental actors would satisfy the credible \nfear standard.  Id. at 320 n.1.  Following the publication of Matter of A-B-, USCIS \nissued a policy memorandum for implementing that decision entitled “Guidance \n                                           \n4   See also Martinez v. Holder, 740 F.3d 902, 909-13 (4th Cir. 2014) (finding \nformer gang membership to constitute a particular social group); Cece v. Holder, \n733 F.3d 662, 672 (7th Cir. 2013) (determining “young Albanian women living \nalone” constituted a particular social group); Henriquez-Rivas v. Holder, 707 F.3d \n1081, 1091-94 (9th Cir. 2013) (en banc) (recognizing that individuals who publicly \ntestify against gangs may qualify as a particular social group); Fiadjoe v. Attorney \nGen.  of  U.S.,  411  F.3d  135,  160-62  (3d  Cir.  2005)  (overturning  the  BIA’s \ndetermination that a victim of incest and domestic violence did not qualify for \nasylum).   \n  7 \n \n\n \nfor Processing Reasonable Fear, Credible Fear, Asylum, and Refugee Claims in \nAccordance  with  Matter  of  A-B-.”    App.  353-62.    The  policy  memorandum \nreiterates in bold font the near-categorical rejection of asylum claims based on \ndomestic and gang-related violence.  App. 358.  \nCoupled together, Matter of A-B- and the policy memorandum repudiate \nlegally recognized asylum protections for individuals and families fleeing from \ndomestic  and  gang-related  violence.    The  opinion  and  guidance  make  it \nexceedingly difficult for those vulnerable populations to establish their eligibility \nfor  asylum.    As  explained  by  appellees,  Matter  of  A-B-  and  the  policy \nmemorandum contravene both existing statutes and precedent from multiple courts \nof appeals.  These policies would, in effect, raise the bar for immigrants seeking to \nshow a credible fear of persecution, and effectively exclude victims of gang and \ndomestic violence from the asylum process.  That result conflicts with the intent of \nCongress in drafting the Immigration and Nationality Act, and with the policies of \nAmici States.  \nII.  Matter of A-B- And The Subsequent USCIS Guidelines Contravene The \nAmici States’ Interest In Welcoming Individuals Seeking Asylum. \nA.  Providing  immigrants  refuge  from  persecution  not  only  fulfills \nour nation’s obligations, but it also strengthens States’ economies. \n  The United States is a nation founded by immigrants, many of whom came \nhere fleeing persecution.  When the country became a signatory to the 1967 United \n  8 \n \n\n \nNations  Protocol  Relating  to  the  Status  of  Refugees  (“Protocol”),  it  vowed  to \nprotect  individuals  escaping  persecution.    INS  v.  Stevic,  467  US  407,  416-17 \n(1984);  see  Mossaad  &  Baugh,  supra,  at  2.    Congress  affirmed  this  national \ncommitment in the 1980 Refugee Act, declaring “the historic policy of the United \nStates to respond to the urgent needs of persons subject to persecution in their \nhomelands.”  Refugee Act of 1980, Pub. L. No. 96-212, § 101(a), 94 Stat. 102, \n102.  Breaking from prior policies that restricted asylum based on geography and \npolitical  preference,  Congress  sought  to  align  the  United  States’  immigration \npolicy with its international commitments by enacting a nondiscriminatory refugee \npolicy that would apply uniformly.5 \n  Amici States and their constituents fundamentally benefit when society lives \nup to the ideals of these commitments.  Experience has shown that the benefits \nassociated with immigration, including the asylum process, are reciprocal; not only \ndo immigrants benefit from the opportunities associated with living in the United \nStates, but the States and country as a whole benefit from immigrants.  Detractors \nof our nation’s immigration and asylum laws have argued that immigrants—and \n                                           \n5   Deborah Anker & Michael Posner, The Forty Year Crisis: A Legislative \nHistory of the Refugee Act of 1980, 19 San Diego L. Rev. 9, 9-10, 63-64 (1981). \n  9 \n \n\n \nasylum  seekers  in  particular—drain  our  nation’s  resources.    Nothing  could  be \nfurther from the truth, as the Amici States know from experience.6   \nImmigrants enhance the nation’s prosperity by contributing to the state and \nnational economies.  Nearly one in six workers is an immigrant.7  Nationally, \nsuccessful asylum grantees have a median age much lower than citizens, which \nmeans that the majority of asylum grantees are of working age and thus contribute \nto the economic output of states and the country as a whole.8   \nImmigrants provide necessary labor in a variety of fields such as healthcare, \nmanufacturing, food services, and agriculture,9 often taking jobs that native-born \ncitizens either do not want or cannot fill.10  For example, in the Great Lakes region \n                                           \n6   For an empirical analysis of this point in a different context, see Hippolyte \nd’Albis et al., Macroeconomic Evidence Suggests that Asylum Seekers Are Not a \n“Burden” for Western European Countries, Science Advances (Jun. 20, 2018), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/y269tm7e. \n7   Am.

Although  nationally  immigrants  make  up  around  15  percent  of  the \nworkforce, approximately 20 percent of business owners are immigrants, with even \n                                           \n11   New Am.

In the \nDistrict of Columbia, for instance, the popular new business Foodhini, founded by \nthe  son  of  refugees,  offers  a  delivery  service  for  immigrant  chefs  selling \nhomecooked meals.26  Majed Abdulraheem, one of the refugee chefs employed by \nFoodhini, worked as a cook in Syria before being displaced by the war.  He is now \nagain pursuing his dream of opening his own restaurant after making his way to the \nUnited States.27  By limiting the asylum process, Matter of A-B- and the policy \nmemorandum  will  make  it  more  difficult  for  refugees  like  Mr.  Tran  and  Mr. \nAbdulraheem  to  bring  their  talents  to  the  several  States,  which  threatens  the \neconomic and cultural development of States and localities across the country. \nB.   Matter of A-B- is inconsistent with state, federal, and international \npolicies intended to protect victims of domestic and gang-related \nviolence. \nVictims  of  domestic  and  gang-related  violence  also  make  important \ncontributions to their communities—and are capable of doing so on a much greater \n                                           \n24   Id. \n25   Id. \n26   Rebecca  Oh,  Foodhini  Works  With  Immigrant  Chefs  to  Deliver  Home-\nCooked Meals, NBC News (June 29, 2017), https://tinyurl.com/yydr8hbc. \n27   Id. \n  13 \n \n\n \nscale when they are given safe haven.

Acknowledging the importance of protecting these individuals \nmore  broadly,  many  States  have  adopted  strong  policies  to  protect  victims  of \ndomestic and gang-related violence. \n1.  Governments  have  long  recognized  that  victims  of  domestic \nviolence merit protection. \nIn issuing Matter of A-B- and the policy memorandum, the federal executive \nhas attempted to unilaterally strip away an essential lifeline for victims of domestic \nviolence.  State, federal, and international policies have recognized the importance \nof protecting this vulnerable population from that harm, yet Matter of A-B- and the \npolicy memorandum disregard this consensus.  \n  States throughout the country recognize that domestic violence is a public \nhealth issue with staggering societal consequences.  All 50 States and the District \nof Columbia have enacted both civil and criminal laws to protect the victims of \ndomestic violence.28  These innovative laws demonstrate the States’ understanding \n                                           \n28   See Am. Bar Assoc., Domestic Violence Civil Protection Orders (CPOs) \n(Mar.  2014),  https://tinyurl.com/yxtsf34a  (describing  state  civil  penalties  for \ndomestic violence and abuse); see also Am. Bar Assoc., Domestic Violence Arrest \n \n  14 \n \n\n \nthat it “is in the public interest to reduce domestic violence, sexual assault, and \n[related  crimes].”29    Washington’s  Domestic  Violence  Leave  Act  is  a  prime \nexample  of  innovative  protections  for,  and  States’  commitment  to,  victims  of \ndomestic violence.30  The Act grants victims the ability to take reasonable leave \nfrom work to handle the aftermaths of abuse, such as seeking legal or medical \nassistance.31  California’s Healthy Workplaces, Healthy Family Act functions in a \nsimilar manner by requiring employers to provide paid days off “for employees \nwho  are  subjected  to  domestic  violence,  sexual  assault,  or  stalking.”32  \nAdditionally, recognizing the toll domestic violence takes on an individual’s ability \nto  work,  the  District  of  Columbia  allows  individuals  who  leave  work  due  to \ndomestic abuse to recover unemployment compensation.33  \nIn the criminal context, New York Penal Law § 240.75 is another example \nof innovative state domestic abuse policy.  The law imposes heightened penalties \n                                                                                                                                        \nPolicies (Jun. 2011), https://tinyurl.com/y6l3fhgb (describing state criminal laws \nand arrest policies). \n29   See, e.g., Wash.

In  1994,  Congress  enacted  the  comprehensive  Violence \nAgainst Women Act (“VAWA”), Pub. L. No. 103-322, 108 Stat. 1902 (1994), with \nthe goal of ensuring that all “persons within the United States shall have the right \nto  be  free  from  crimes  of  violence  motivated  by  gender,”  United  States  v. \nMorrison, 529 U.S. 598, 605 (2000).  VAWA not only included protection for U.S. \ncitizens facing domestic violence, but it also aided immigrants facing the same \nissues.  The Act introduced new immigration procedures which enable those who \n“ha[ve] been battered or ha[ve] been the subject of extreme cruelty perpetrated by” \na spouse or fiancé to self-petition for a visa.  8 U.S.C. § 1154(a)(1)(A)(iii)(bb).  \nMoreover, Congress made significant appropriations advancing the purposes of \nVAWA through grants and creation of the Office on Violence Against Women \n                                           \n34   N.Y. Penal Law § 240.75.  \n35   See  U.S.  Dep’t  of  Justice,  State  Court  Processing  of  Domestic  Violence \nCases 1 (Mar. 21, 2008), https://tinyurl.com/y5ype8nd. \n  16 \n \n\n \nwithin the Department of Justice (“DOJ”).36  Since its inception, that office has \nadministered  over  $8  billion  in  grants  to  State,  local,  and  tribal  governments, \nnonprofit organizations, and universities.37  \nIn 2000, Congress heightened protections for immigrants who were victims \nof sex trafficking and domestic abuse.  See Victims of Trafficking and Violence \nProtection Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-386, 114 Stat. 1464.  It created two new \ncategories of visas for those seeking admission to the United States—“T” visas for \nvictims of sex trafficking, id. div. A § 107, 114 Stat. 1474-80 (codified at 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1101(a)(15)(T)), and “U” visas for victims of other serious crimes, like domestic \nabuse, who testify against their attackers, id. div. B § 1513, 114 Stat. 1533-37 \n(codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(U)).  With the passage of this Act, Congress \nrecognized  the  importance  of  “providing  battered  immigrants . . . who  [are] \nexperiencing domestic violence at home with protection against deportation.”  Id. \n§ 1502(a)(2), 114 Stat. 1518.  Indeed, in discussing the need for T and U visas, \nmembers of Congress noted that the visas would provide protection for domestic \nviolence victims in the United States,38 who if coming to this country alone, could \n                                           \n36   Congressional Research Service, The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA): \nHistorical Overview, Funding, and Reauthorization 4 (updated Apr. 23, 2019). \n37   Id.  \n38   See U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Servs., Victims of Human Trafficking: T \nNonimmigrant  Status,  https://tinyurl.com/yxton2te  (last  visited  July  20,  2019) \n \n  17 \n \n\n \nseek and qualify for asylum, but may have difficulty doing so when their abuser is \nalso within the United States.39  Yet, Matter of A-B-, which was issued solely by \nthe Attorney General, and the USCIS policy memorandum threaten to foreclose \nasylum protection and contravene States’ and Congress’s desire to aid immigrants \nwho are victims of domestic abuse. \nMoreover, a policy that categorically rejects asylum claims from victims of \ndomestic  abuse  is  contrary  to  the  guidelines  set  forth  by  the  UNHCR.    The \nSupreme Court and, consequently, federal appellate courts, consider the guidance \nfound in the UNHCR’s Handbook and Guidelines on Procedures and Criteria for \nDetermining Refugee Status (Geneva 2011 ed.)

The  Handbook  notes  that  immigrants  who  suffer  from  gender-related \npersecution, such as “sexual violence, family/domestic violence, coerced family \nplanning, [and] female genital mutilation” may qualify as refugees.40  That remains \nthe case when there is “a risk of being persecuted at the hands of a non-State actor” \nsuch  as  a  “husband  [or]  partner.”41    Matter  of  A-B-  blatantly  ignored  the \nHandbook’s reasoning, which this Court should take into account when construing \nthe INA.

Governments  have  long  recognized  the  importance  of \nprotecting victims of gang-related violence. \nMatter of A-B- also diverges from State, federal, and international policies \ndesigned to protect victims and communities from gang-related violence.  States in \nparticular have a strong policy commitment to deterring gang violence and aiding \nvictims.  Each State has provisions in its criminal code intended to address gang \nviolence,42  recognizing  that  gang-related  crimes  may  be  exceedingly  harmful.  \nThese provisions typically criminalize active participation in gangs43 and gang-\n                                           \n40   Handbook at 84.   \n41   Id. at 87. \n42   See  National  Gang  Center,  Compilation  of  Gang  Related  Legislation, \nhttps://tinyurl.com/yxjwd5rp (last visited July 22, 2019). \n43   See, e.g., Cal.

The Fifth Circuit   \ndecision, together with that of the First Circuit also cited \nFootnotes \n \n1  Originally the Attorney General (now the DHS Secretary) was authorized in his “sole and unreviewable discretion” to \n  so designate “any or all aliens” so long as they “have not been admitted or paroled into the United States” and \ncannot show that they have been “physically present in the United States continuously for the 2-year period \nimmediately prior to the date of the determination of inadmissibility.” See id. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii). The DHS Secretary \nexercised his discretion to require the expedited removal of all aliens whose removal is statutorily required. See \nDesignating Aliens for Expedited Removal, 84 Fed. Reg. 35,409, 35,409–14 (July 23, 2019). \n \n2  The DHS Secretary must provide for review of a removal order issued to “an alien who claims under oath, or as \n  permitted under penalty of perjury under section 1746 of title 28, after having been warned of the penalties for \nfalsely making such claim under such conditions, to have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence, to have \nbeen admitted as a refugee under section 1157 of this title, or to have been granted asylum under section 1158 of \nthis title.” See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(C). \n \n3  The Congress also provided for habeas review in all federal district courts. See § 1252(e)(3), (4), (5); see also \n  Thuraissigiam, 140 S.Ct. at 1967–71; Castro v. DHS, 835 F.3d 422, 427 (3d Cir. 2016). \n \n  26 \n \n\n \nGrace v. Barr, 965 F.3d 883 (2020)   \n448 U.S.App.D.C. 243 \n \n4  The alien appealed to the BIA after having been ordered removed by an immigration judge. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(b). \n   \n5  As part of DHS, see 6 U.S.C. § 271, USCIS administers much of the removal system. \n   \n6  The majority discounts this precedent because it “mention[s] neither credible-fear interviews nor expedited \n  removal.” Maj. Op. at 894. My colleagues miss the point of my discussion. I express no view about the relationship \nbetween section 1252(a)(2)(B) and section 1252(a)(2)(A). In discussing section 1252(a)(2)(B), my point is that the \nconsistent understanding of “review” adopted by courts in interpreting section 1252 necessarily means that the \nplaintiffs ask for “review” of their credible fear determinations. The fact that neither Zhu nor section 1252(a)(2)(B) \ninvolves expedited removal does not rebut that point. Moreover, “read[ing] section 1252(a)(2)(A)(iii)’s jurisdictional \nbar in tandem with section 1252(e)(3),” Maj. Op. at 894, which we must do of course, see Negusie v. Holder, 555 \nU.S. 511, 519, 129 S.Ct. 1159, 173 L.Ed.2d 20 (2009) (“[W]e look not only to the particular statutory language, but to \nthe design of the statute as a whole and to its object and policy.”) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), \ndoes not mean ignoring section 1252(a)(2)(A)(iii)’s plain text. \n \n7  The majority claims that “the government’s view of section 1252(a)(2)(A)(iii) could leave no one able to challenge \n  the policies at issue in this suit.” Maj. Op. at 893. That is incorrect. Section 1252(a)(2)(A)(iii) prevents only the \nplaintiff who has received a negative credible fear determination from challenging Matter of A-B- and the Guidance. \nAs several sister circuits have recognized, however, an alternative avenue for judicial review of Matter of A-B and \nthe Guidance exists—the standard petition for review procedure. See Gonzales-Veliz v. Barr, 938 F.3d 219, 233–36 \n(5th Cir. 2019). Moreover, although this issue is not before us, my reading of section 1252(a)(2)(A)(iii) does not rule \nout the possibility of a plaintiff’s challenge to a policy before receiving a negative credible fear determination. \n \n8  Critically, the plaintiffs in Am. Immigration Lawyers Ass’n did not challenge a credible fear determination—they \n  were individual non-asylum seekers and organizations seeking to vindicate aliens’ rights in general. See 199 F.3d at \n1356–57. \n \n9  Because section 1252(a)(2)(A)(iii) independently bars the plaintiffs’ suit, I leave aside the more difficult question \n  whether the Guidance’s instruction to asylum officers on the law they are to apply in credible fear interviews—the \nonly part of the Guidance other than its reading of Matter of A-B- the plaintiffs challenge—itself qualifies as a \n“written policy ... issued ... to implement” section 1225(b). \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  27 \n ",
