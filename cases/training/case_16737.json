    "summary": "<p>This case is a response to actions taken by the Department of Justice (DOJ) following litigation in the 2017 case, <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16188\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">City of Los Angeles v. Sessions</a>. On August 22, 2018, the City of Los Angeles filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The plaintiff sued the DOJ and the Attorney General under the Declaratory Judgment Act and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The plaintiff, represented by its legal department and Covington and Burling LLP, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorneys fees and costs. The city claimed that by unlawfully imposing immigration-related conditions on federal funding to the city, the government violated separation of powers, the spending clause, the Tenth Amendment, and the APA. Judge Manuel Real was assigned to the case.</p>\r\n<p>Los Angeles had been receiving federal funding through the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (Byrne JAG), a criminal justice grant administered by the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), a component of DOJ. DOJ requirements for its 2018 program funding imposed immigration-related conditions on recipient cities, including Los Angeles. The plaintiff alleged that four of these conditions were materially identical to conditions imposed on other Byrne JAG grants that had been enjoined by the courts in other litigation. The conditions required that local government entities not prohibit or restrict communication between government entities or officials and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Recipients would have to provide DHS at least 48 hours advance notice of any noncitizen's scheduled release from custody and allow DHS to access any correctional or detention facility to question suspected undocumented immigrants about their right to be in the country. The plaintiff also alleged that the defendant had included requirements to not publicly disclose federal law enforcement information in an attempt to conceal, harbor, or shield individuals from detention, and required certification that funding recipients were in compliance.</p>\r\n<p>On October 5, 2018, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint, adding allegations regarding another federal grant program: the Gang Suppression Planning Grants Program (Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant). This Grant was issued under authority of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, which authorized the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP), a sub-component of DOJ, to make grants to local units of government in order to promote the goals of preventing, controlling, and reducing juvenile delinquency. The plaintiff alleged that unlawful conditions materially identical to those placed on the Byrne JAG grant had also been imposed on the Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant.</p>\r\n<p>The same day, the plaintiff also moved for partial summary judgment as to the counts alleging the unlawful conditions imposed on the Byrne JAG grant.</p>\r\n<p>On November 13, 2018, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the city's claims and a cross-motion for partial summary judgment.</p>\r\n<p>On February 15, 2019, Judge Real granted the plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment and permanently enjoined the defendants from imposing the challenged conditions on FY2018 Byrne JAG awards and Juvenile Gang Prevention Grants nationwide. He held that the defendants' imposition of the immigration conditions was ultra vires as a matter of law and a violation of separation of powers. Judge Real also held that the plaintiff's remaining claims were moot. 2019 WL 1957966.</p>\r\n<p>On March 13, 2019, the defendants appealed Judge Real's order to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (docket no. 19-55314). They also sought a partial stay of the order pending appeal, which the plaintiff consented to.</p>\r\n<p>On April 5, 2019, the parties filed a joint motion for indicative ruling; the parties requested that, if the Ninth Circuit were to remand the portion of the injunction relating to the Gang Prevention Grants, Judge Real vacate that aspect of the injunction to permit further substantive motions from the parties.</p>\r\n<p>On April 19, 2019, Judge Real granted the defendants' request for a partial stay of the injunction pending appeal; the only part of the injunction to remain in effect was that which enjoined the conditions on the Byrne JAG grant for FY2018 concerning to the plaintiff city.</p>\r\n<p>On May 10, 2019, Judge Real granted the parties' motion for indicative ruling (indicating that he would grant a joint motion to vacate the portion of his earlier order relating to the Gang Prevention Grants).</p>\r\n<p>The parties then filed a joint motion for limited remand with the Ninth Circuit, which was granted. They had also filed a separate joint motion to stay briefing pending the Ninth Circuit's resolution of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16188\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> City of Los Angeles v. Barr</a>. The Ninth Circuit agreed to stay proceedings on July 18, 2019.</p>\r\n<p>Once the case was remanded back to the district court, the parties jointly moved to vacate the portion of Judge Real's order relating to the Gang Prevention Grants on May 31. That motion was granted on July 1, 2019.</p>\r\n<p>The parties then filed cross-motions for summary judgment with regard to the plaintiff's claims concerning the Gang Prevention Grants for FY2018.</p>\r\n<p>On December 31, 2019, the case was reassigned to Judge Josephine L. Staton.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Staton granted the city's motion for summary judgment in part and denied defendants' request for summary judgment entirely on June 17, 2020. The court found that defendants' conduct was ultra vires as a matter of law and a violation of separation of powers. The court permanently enjoined and restrained defendants \"from conditioning, withholding, or delaying Gang Suppression Planning Grants Program awards with respect to City based on the six immigration-related conditions imposed on applicants of the Fiscal Year 2018 Gang Suppression Program.\"</p>\r\n<p>Defendants appealed on September 4, 2020 to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, but then voluntarily dismissed their appeal on January 14, 2020. The Biden Administration revoked the Executive Orders enacting the challenged procedures, mooting the case. On January 31, 2022, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals granted the motion to dismiss the appeal. The case is now closed. <br />&nbsp;</p>",

(Dkts. 41, 49).  \n21  Having been briefed by both parties, this Court took the matters under submission on January 2, \n22  2019. \n23  The two federal grants at issue here are (1) the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance \n24  Grant (“Byrne JAG”) Program, and (2) a grant authorized by the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency \n25  Prevention Act of 1974 (“Juvenile Justice Act”), also referred to as the “Gang Suppression Grant \n26  Program.”  The Byrne JAG grant supports state and local law enforcement efforts by providing \n27  additional funds for personnel, equipment, training, and other criminal justice needs.  34 U.S.C. § \n28  10152.  The Byrne JAG grant is a formula grant, meaning the funds are awarded according to a  \n\nCase 2 :18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 62   Filed 02/15/19   Page 2 of 10   Page ID #:2758\n1  formula provided by statute based on the state’s population and rate of violent crime.  34 U.S.C. § \n2  10156.  Plaintiff City of Los Angeles (“Los Angeles”) has been a recipient of the Byrne JAG grant \n3  every year since 1997, except 2017 and 2018, and each year has received more than $1 million in \n4  funding.  DOJ has imposed five conditions on both of these fiscal year 2018 grants.  The first two \n5  conditions, referred to as the “Notice” and “Access” Conditions, are substantively identical to \n6  those previously enjoined by this Court in the case concerning the fiscal year 2017 Byrne JAG \n7  awards.  These two conditions provide that the Department will only provide Byrne JAG grants to \n8  cities and states that comply with federal law, allow federal immigration access to detention \n9  facilities (“Access Condition”), and provide 40 hours’ notice before they release an illegal alien \n10  wanted by federal authorities (“Notice Condition”).  Los Angeles has not changed its policies and \n \n  11  operations, and as a result has not received Byrne JAG funding for the 2018 fiscal year.  The third \n12  Condition, referred to as the “1373 and 1644 Condition” requires recipients to certify compliance \n13  with 8 U.S.C. §§ 1373 and 1644.  The final two conditions require the local governments that \n14  receive the above mentioned federal grants to (1) certify “not to publicly disclose federal law \n15  enforcement information in an attempt to conceal, harbor, or shield certain individuals from \n16  detection, whether or not in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a) (the “Harboring Condition”); and (2) \n17  answer a DOJ questionnaire regarding the local governmental entity’s policies on communication \n18  with federal immigration authorities and certify that the entity will not impede the Attorney \n19  General’s reporting requirements under 8 U.S.C. § 1366 (“Questionnaire and 1366 Condition”).  \n20  Combined, this Court will refer to all conditions above as “the Conditions.”   Now before this \n21  Court, Plaintiff moves for Partial Summary Judgment as to Counts One, Two, Three, and Four of \n22  its Complaint, while Defendant moves for Partial Dismissal or Partial Summary Judgment.    \n23  Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the \n24  moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Celotex Corp. v. \n25  Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 330 (1986).  Partial summary judgment may be granted on particular \n26  claims.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).   \n27  Justiciability \n28    Defendants argue in their motion that Los Angeles lacks standing to challenge the \n2 \n \n \n\nCase 2 :18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 62   Filed 02/15/19   Page 3 of 10   Page ID #:2759\n1  Conditions that DOJ has imposed on the 2018 Gang Suppression Grant.  Article III of the \n2  Constitution allows federal courts to adjudicate only live cases and controversies.  Under this \n3  requirement, a plaintiff must have “standing” to sue for relief.  The elements of standing are (1) \n4  injury in fact, (2) causation, and (3) redressability.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, \n5  560-61 (1992).  To establish standing to seek equitable relief, the plaintiff must also show a \n6  likelihood of future injury.  City of L.A. v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 105 (1983).  “The existence of \n7  standing turns on the facts as they existed at the time the plaintiff filed the complaint.”  Skaff v. \n8  Meridien N. Am. Beverly Hills, LLC, 506 F.3d 832, 838 (9th Cir. 2007). \n9    A grant competitor may suffer “competitive injury” for purposes of standing.  “[W]hen \n10  challenged agency conduct allegedly renders a [competitor] unable to fairly compete for some \n \n  11  benefit, that [competitor] has suffered a sufficient ‘injury in fact’ and has standing.”  Preston v. \n12  Heckler, 734 F.2d 1359, 1365 (9th Cir. 1984); see also Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters v. U.S. Dep’t of \n13  Transp., 861 F.3d 944, 950 (9th Cir. 2017) (“[E]conomic actors suffer an injury in fact when \n14  agencies lift regulatory restrictions on their competitors or otherwise allow increased competition \n15  against them….  This doctrine of ‘competitor standing’ is grounded in the basic law of economics \n16  that increased competition leads to actual injury.”).  The grant competitor is not required to show \n17  that it would have received the grant but for the disadvantage it faced.  Rather, “the ‘injury in fact’ \n18  is the inability to compete on an equal footing in the bidding process….”  Ne. Fla. Chapter of \n19  Associated Gen. Contractors of Am. v. Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 666 (1993). \n20    DOJ challenges Los Angeles’ standing on the basis of injury-in-fact, alleging that because \n21  the Gang Suppression Grant is a discretionary program with limited funds, it is unknown whether \n22  Los Angeles will be chosen to receive an award, and thus, its injury is speculative.  However, this \n23  Court is not persuaded by such an argument.  In order to have standing, Los Angeles need only \n24  seek and be qualified to receive the grant funds at issue.  See DKT Mem’l Fund, Ltd. v. Agency for \n25  Int’l Dev., 810 F.2d 1236, 1238 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  Los Angeles promptly applied for funding and \n26  alleged that it will use the funds to implement a long-term project falling within the scope of the \n27  grant’s purpose.  Los Angeles has demonstrated that it has sought funds and is qualified to receive \n28  such grant funds. It need not also demonstrate that it is certain to receive funding.  Thus, Los \n3 \n \n \n\nCase 2 :18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 62   Filed 02/15/19   Page 4 of 10   Page ID #:2760\n1  Angeles has standing to bring suit based on competitive injury.  \n2  Count One (Ultra Vires Agency Action and Violation of Separation of Powers) \n3    The City of Los Angeles moves for summary judgment on Count One claiming that the \n4  Conditions imposed are ultra vires agency action and a violation of separation of powers. \n5    An agency “has no power to act…unless and until Congress confers power upon \n6  it.”  La. Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986).  When agencies “act improperly, \n7  no less than when they act beyond their jurisdiction, what they do is ultra vires.”  City of Arlington \n8  v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 297 (2013).  While “Congress may attach conditions on the receipt of \n9  federal funds,” a federal agency may not do so without Congress’ permission.  South Dakota v. \n10  Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 206 (1987); see also City of Chicago v. Sessions, 264 F. Supp. 3d 933, 940 \n \n  11  (N.D. Ill. 2017) (“Whether the new conditions on the…grant are proper depends on whether \n12  Congress conferred authority on the Attorney General to impose them.”).   \n13    “If Congress intends to alter the usual constitutional balance between the States and the \n14  Federal Government, it must make its intention to do so unmistakably clear in the language of the \n15  statute.”  Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 460 (1991).  Although Gregory did not address this \n16  constitutional balance in the grant context, the Court explained that this clear rule “applie[s] in \n17  other contexts,” including any “traditionally sensitive areas, such as legislation affecting the \n18  federal balance.”  Id. at 461.  The Fourth Circuit, citing Supreme Court precedent, extended the \n19  clear statement rule specifically to federal grants.  Com. of Va., Dep’t of Educ. v. Riley, 106 F.3d \n20  559, 566 (4th Cir. 1997) (en banc).  The Riley Court emphasized the importance of such a rule \n21  where the grant condition required the surrender of a critical power reserved to the states by the \n22  Tenth Amendment.  Id.  The Supreme Court has emphasized that the police power is one such \n23  critical state function.  See, e.g., Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U.S. 243, 270 (2006) (states have “great \n24  latitude under their police powers to legislate as to the protection of the lives, limbs, health, \n25  comfort, and quiet of all persons”). \n26    In its September 13, 2018 Order, this Court held that “[t]he language of the [Byrne JAG] \n27  statute gives no indication that DOJ is authorized to add civil immigration conditions.”  This Court \n28  further held that 34 U.S.C. § 10102(a)(6), the statutory authority DOJ identified in support of its \n4 \n \n \n\nCase 2 :18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 62   Filed 02/15/19   Page 5 of 10   Page ID #:2761\n1  immigration conditions, did not in fact authorize such conditions.  As for the Conditions imposed \n2  on the FY 2018 grants, DOJ has made minor changes from the 2017 Notice and Access \n3  Conditions, and added new immigration-related conditions with the purpose of forcing States and \n4  localities to participate in federal civil immigration enforcement.  While minor changes were \n5  made, the substance and effect of the conditions remains the same, and DOJ’s attempt to add \n6  immigration-based conditions to the Byrne JAG Program is inconsistent with the text, structure, \n7  and purpose of the statute.  In addition, this Court rejects Defendants’ contention that the \n8  immigration conditions are required by federal immigration statutes.   \n9    The Notice and Access Conditions  \n10    DOJ is imposing on the FY 2018 grants substantively the same Notice and Access \n \n  11  Conditions that this Court enjoined for FY 2017.  The Notice and Access Conditions require local \n12  governments’ law enforcement and detention facilities to adjust their resources and practices (1) to \n13  provide 48 hours’ notice to federal immigration authorities, upon request from DHS, before \n14  releasing certain aliens, and (2) to allow federal immigration officials access to their local \n15  detention facilities to interview certain detainees.  Although this Court and multiple other courts \n16  have enjoined these conditions, DOJ now attempts to argue that an assortment of statutory \n17  provisions require States and local governments to provide notice and access.  The statutory \n18  provisions that Defendants rely on are 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a), (c) and 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a).  However, \n19  Section 1226(a) and (c) discuss the authority of the Attorney General and provide that he may \n20  issue warrants for, and take into custody, certain aliens.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a), (c).  Section \n21  1232(a) discusses the authority of the Attorney General to remove and detain certain aliens.  None \n22  of these statutory provisions are directed to States or local governments.  Defendants cite to \n23  additional statutory provisions in an attempt to bolster their position that they have been granted \n24  authority by statute to impose these conditions, but this Court finds such attempts unavailing.  \n25  Neither the Byrne JAG nor any other statute grants the Attorney General “the authority to impose \n26  conditions that require states or local governments to assist in immigration enforcement, nor to \n27  deny funds to states or local governments for the failure to comply with those conditions.”  City of \n28  Chicago v. Sessions, 888 F.3d 272, 284 (7th Cir. 2018).  This Court agrees with the position of the \n5 \n \n \n\nCase 2 :18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 62   Filed 02/15/19   Page 6 of 10   Page ID #:2762\n1  Seventh Circuit that “[t]he Attorney General in this case used the sword of federal funding to \n2  conscript state and local authorities to aid in federal civil immigration enforcement.  But the power \n3  of the purse rests with Congress, which authorized the federal funds at issue and did not impose \n4  any immigration enforcement conditions on the receipt of such funds.”  Id. at 277.    \n5    The challenged Conditions upset the constitutional balance between state and federal \n6  power by requiring state and local law enforcement to partner with federal authorities.  These \n7  conditions infringe upon the state police power.  They also upset the constitutional balance by \n8  requiring state and local participation in a historically federal function—immigration enforcement.  \n9  See, e.g., Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 394 (2012) (“The Government of the United \n10  States has broad, undoubted power over the subject of immigration and the status of aliens.”).  \n \n  11  Thus, the dispositive question before this Court is whether Congress has “unmistakably” \n12  authorized the Attorney General to impose the challenged Conditions.  \n13    Accordingly, Defendants’ imposition of the Notice and Access Condition is ultra vires as a \n14  matter of law and a violation of separation of powers.  As a result, Los Angeles’s Motion for \n15  Summary Judgment is GRANTED on Count One as to the Notice and Access Conditions. \n16    The 1373 and 1644 Condition \n17    As provided by Section 1373(a), federal, state, and local governments and officials “may \n18  not prohibit, or in any way restrict, any government entity or official from sending to, or receiving \n19  from” federal immigration officials “information regarding the citizenship or immigration status, \n20  lawful or unlawful, of any individual.”  8 U.S.C. § 1373(a).  Section 1373(b) provides that “no \n21  person or agency may prohibit, or in any way restrict,” a federal, state, or local government from \n22  “[m]aintaining such information” or “[e]xchanging such information with any Federal, State, or \n23  local government entity.”  Section 1644 provides that “no State or local government entity may be \n24  prohibited, or in any way restricted, from sending to or receiving from the Immigration and \n25  Naturalization Service information regarding the immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of an \n26  alien in the United States.  8 U.S.C. § 1644.   \n27    As Los Angeles argues and this Court agrees, Section 1373 and 1644 are not applicable \n28  Federal laws within the meaning of Section 10153(a)(5)(D) such that certification of compliance \n6 \n \n \n\nCase 2 :18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 62   Filed 02/15/19   Page 7 of 10   Page ID #:2763\n1  with them can be required by States and local governments as a condition for Byrne JAG funds.  \n2  Neither statute concerns federal grants, and they are unconstitutional as applied to States and local \n3  governments under the Tenth Amendment’s anti-commandeering principle.  Moreover, this Court \n4  stands in agreement with three other courts that have already analyzed this issue.1  City of \n5  Philadelphia v. Sessions, 309 F. Supp. 3d 289, 329 (E.D. Pa. 2018) (Section 1373 “regulate[s] \n6  state and local governmental entities and officials, which is fatal to [its] constitutionality under the \n7  Tenth Amendment.”);  City & Cty. of San Francisco v. Sessions, No. 3:17-cv-04642, Dkt. 145, 30 \n8  (N.D. Cal. Oct. 5, 2018) (Section 1373 “require[s] local policymakers to stand aside and allow the \n9  federal government to conscript the time and cooperation of local employees.”)  (quoting City of \n10  Chicago v. Sessions, 2018 WL 3608564, *11 (N.D. Ill. Jul. 27, 2018).).  These statutes violate the \n \n  11  anticommandeering principle of the Tenth Amendment, and the fact that Section 1373 prohibits \n12  States and local governments from acting rather than requiring them to act does not change the \n13  constitutional analysis, because “[t]he basic principles―that Congress cannot issue direct orders \n14  to state legislatures―applies in either event.”  See Murphy v. NCAA, 138 S. Ct. 1461, 1478 \n15  (2018).   \n16    Accordingly, Defendants’ imposition of the 1373 and 1644 Condition is ultra vires as a \n17  matter of law and a violation of separation of powers.  As a result, Los Angeles’s Motion for \n18  Summary Judgment is GRANTED on Count One as to the 1373 and 1644 Condition. \n19    The Harboring Condition  \n20    8 U.S.C. § 1324(a), referred to as the Harboring Condition, is what DOJ contends is an \n21  applicable Federal law under Section 10153(a)(5)(D) so that DOJ can, as a condition on receiving \n22  Byrne JAG grants, require that States and local governments not publicly disclose federal law \n23  enforcement information in an attempt to conceal, harbor, or shield certain individuals from \n24  detection, including in violation of 8 U.S.C § 1324(a).  However, Section 1324(a) is not applicable \n25  to federal grants.  Further, the provisions in Section 1324(a) are not directed at States or local \n26  governments, but instead apply to any person which the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) \n27  defines as an “individual or an organization.”  8 U.S.C. § 1101(b)(3).  And an organization \n28 \n                                                 \n1 The same analysis applies to Section 1644 because it also prohibits States and localities from enacting laws \ngoverning the duties of state and local law enforcement officers. \n7 \n \n \n\nCase 2 :18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 62   Filed 02/15/19   Page 8 of 10   Page ID #:2764\n1  includes corporate entities, not States or local governments.  See id. § 1101(a)(28).  In addition, \n2  regarding the anticommandeering principle discussed above, an interpretation of Section 1324(a) \n3  that would apply to States and local governments and subject them to criminal punishment would \n4  be a violation of the Tenth Amendment.  Section 10153(a)(5)(D) does not authorize DOJ to \n5  require State and local governments to certify that they will not publicly disclose “federal law \n6  enforcement information” in violation of Section 1324(a).   \n7    Accordingly, Defendants’ imposition of the Harboring Condition (8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)) is \n8  ultra vires as a matter of law and a violation of separation of powers.  As a result, Los Angeles’s \n9  Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED on Count One as to the Harboring Condition. \n10    The Questionnaire and 1366 Conditions   \n \n  11    The Questionnaire Condition requires States and local governments to answer various \n12  questions about the entity’s communication policies with federal immigration authorities.  The \n13  Condition requires jurisdictions to provide information about their laws, policies, or practices \n14  related to whether, when, or how employees may communicate with DHS or ICE and to explain \n15  how those laws, policies, and practices comply with Section 1373.  However, Congress has \n16  limited the information that the Attorney General could require of States and local governments to \n17  programmatic and financial information as provided in Section 10153(a)(4).  Further, DOJ \n18  requires States and local governments to certify that they will not impede the Attorney General’s \n19  authority under 8 U.S.C. § 1366(1) and (3).  However, those provisions do not concern federal \n20  grants, and are not directed to States and local governments.  \n21    Accordingly, Defendants’ imposition of the Questionnaire and 1366 Conditions is ultra \n22  vires as a matter of law and a violation of separation of powers.  As a result, Los Angeles’s \n23  Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED on Count One as to the Questionnaire and 1366 \n24  Conditions.  \n25    Granting Los Angeles summary judgment on Count I affects the balance of Los Angeles’s \n26  claims.  It renders the remaining counts―Counts II, III, and IV―moot.  \n27  Injunctive Relief: Permanent Injunction \n28    Los Angeles seeks to prospectively enjoin Defendants from imposing the Conditions \n8 \n \n \n\nCase 2 :18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 62   Filed 02/15/19   Page 9 of 10   Page ID #:2765\n1  discussed above.  To obtain a permanent injunction, the moving party must show (1) irreparable \n2  injury, (2) that monetary damages are inadequate, (3) that the balance of hardships weighs in its \n3  favor, and (4) that an injunction serves the public.  Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms, 561 \n4  U.S. 139, 156-57 (2010).   \n5    First, Los Angeles’s harm is irreparable and cannot be compensated by monetary damages.  \n6  Los Angeles will suffer irreparable harm because it will be barred from receiving a funding \n7  opportunity which it has been, and otherwise would be, entitled to based on Congress’ statutory \n8  formula.  Further, Los Angeles will suffer irreparable competitive harm if Defendants are not \n9  enjoined from imposing the Conditions in future cycles.  Int’l Franchise Ass’n, Inc. v. City of \n10  Seattle, 803 F.3d 389, 411 (9th Cir. 2015) (“A rule putting plaintiffs at a competitive disadvantage \n \n  11  constitutes irreparable harm.”).  Second, monetary damages cannot ensure that Los Angeles will \n12  compete on a level playing field in future grant cycles.  Third, Los Angeles has a strong interest in \n13  competing fairly for federal resources.  Although Defendants have an interest in determining \n14  allocation of federal funds, they have no legitimate interest in distributing these funds \n15  unconstitutionally.  Finally, it is “always in the public interest” to issue an injunction in order to \n16  prevent the violation of constitutional rights.  Melendres v. Arpaio, 695 F.3d 990, 1002 (9th Cir. \n17  2012).  Therefore, a permanent injunction is appropriate.  \n18    A district court may issue a nationwide injunction only where “necessary to provide \n19  complete relief to the plaintiff[].”  See Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702 (1979); see also \n20  Easyriders Freedom F.I.G.H.T. v. Hannigan, 92 F.3d 1486, 1501-02 (9th Cir. 1996) (“[A]n \n21  injunction is not necessarily made overbroad by extending benefit or protection to persons other \n22  than prevailing parties in the lawsuit—even if it is not a class action—if such breadth is necessary \n23  to give prevailing parties the relief to which they are entitled.”).  This Court cannot reasonably \n24  provide complete relief to Los Angeles without enjoining Defendants from imposing the \n25  Conditions as to all competitors.  An injunction that bars Defendants from applying the Conditions \n26  only as to Los Angeles does little to ensure an even playing field.  Gregory v. Litton Sys., Inc., 472 \n27  F.2d 631, 633-34 (9th Cir. 1972) (“[I]njunctive relief [may] be necessary to give a plaintiff or a \n28  group of plaintiffs the relief to which they are entitled.  Such relief, of course, may incidentally \n9 \n \n \n\nCase 2: 18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 62   Filed 02/15/19   Page 10 of 10   Page ID #:2766\n1  benefit many persons not before the court.”).  Thus, this Court finds a program-wide permanent \n2  injunction appropriate.  \n3    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment as to Count \n4  One is GRANTED.  (Dkt. 41). \n5    IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the remaining claims are moot.  \n6    IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that Defendants’ Motion for Partial Dismissal \n7  or Partial Summary Judgment is DENIED.  (Dkt. 49).   \n8    IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that Defendants are permanently enjoined from \n9  imposing the Conditions on FY 2018 Byrne JAG awards and Gang Suppression Grant Program. \n10  Dated:  February 15, 2019. \n \n \n  11 \n \n12 \n \n13 \n___________________________________      \n14 \n15          MANUEL L.

FOR DECLARATORY AND \n  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n22 \nJEFFERSON B. SESSIONS, III, in his   \n23  official capacity as Attorney General of the   \nUnited States; LAURA ROGERS, in her \n24 \nofficial capacity as Acting Principal Deputy \n25 \nAssistant Attorney General of the Office of \nJustice Programs; UNITED STATES \n26 \nDEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. \n27 \n \n  Defendants. \n28 \n \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 2 of 52   Page ID #:180\n \nINTRODUCTION1 \n1 \n1.  The City of Los Angeles (“Los Angeles” or “City”) files this Complaint \n2 \nseeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the United States Department of \n3 \nJustice (“DOJ” or “Department”) from unconstitutionally seeking to wield authority it \n4 \ndoes not have to advance policy objectives it cannot lawfully effectuate in such a \n5 \nmanner—all at the expense of public safety and community trust in Los Angeles and \n6 \nother communities. \n7 \n2.  Numerous courts nationwide, including this Court, already have enjoined \n8 \nDOJ from using federal funding to punish jurisdictions like Los Angeles for refusing to \n9 \nabandon successful community policing practices built on engendering community trust \n10 \nby participating in the civil immigration enforcement policies of the Trump \n11 \nAdministration. \n12 \n3.  The federal funds at issue in this Complaint are two DOJ grants:  (1) Fiscal \n13 \nYear (“FY”) 2018 Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (“Byrne JAG”), 34 \n14 \nU.S.C. §§ 10151-58; and (2) FY 2018 Gang Suppression Planning Grants Program \n15 \n(“Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant”), Pub. L. 115-141, 132 Stat 348, 423; 34 U.S.C. \n16 \n§§ 11171, 11172. \n17 \nThe Byrne JAG Program \n18 \n4.  Congress established the Byrne JAG Program specifically to authorize \n19 \nfederal grants “for use by the State or unit of local government” in order to provide \n20 \n“additional personnel, equipment, supplies, contractual support, training, technical \n21 \nassistance, and information systems for criminal justice.”  34 U.S.C. § 10152(a)(1).  \n22 \nByrne JAG grants are awarded through a statutory formula based on population and rate \n23 \n24                                                   \n1 DOJ has provided written consent to Los Angeles’s filing of its First Amended \n25 \nComplaint and Los Angeles may file the First Amended Complaint as a matter of course.  \n26  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(1), (2); McGucken v. Chive Media Grp., LLC, No. CV 18-\n01612-RSWL-KS, 2018 WL 3410095, at *5 (C.D. Cal. July 11, 2018) (“Federal Rule of \n27 \nCivil Procedure 15(a) provides that a party may amend their complaint once ‘as a matter \n28  of course’ before a responsive pleading is served.”).   \n1 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 3 of 52   Page ID #:181\n \nof violent crime.  They are administered by a component of DOJ, the Bureau of Justice \n1 \nAssistance (“BJA”) within DOJ’s Office of Justice Programs (“OJP”). \n2 \n5.  Four conditions on the FY 2018 Byrne JAG grant are materially identical to \n3 \nthe conditions on the FY 2017 Byrne JAG grants that have been enjoined by courts, \n4 \nincluding two conditions enjoined by this Court.  The FY 2018 Byrne JAG conditions \n5 \nrequire States and localities to:  (1) comply with 8 U.S.C. § 1373, which provides that \n6 \nStates and localities “may not prohibit, or in any way restrict” government entities and \n7 \nofficials from “sending to, or receiving from” the United States Department of Homeland \n8 \nSecurity (“DHS”) information “regarding the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or \n9 \nunlawful, of any individual”; (2) comply with 8 U.S.C. § 1644, which provides that no \n10 \nStates and localities “may be prohibited, or in any way restricted” from “sending to or \n11 \nreceiving from” DHS “the immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of an alien in the \n12 \nUnited States”; (3) provide 48 hours’ advance notice to DHS, “where feasible” and when \n13 \nrequested, before releasing an alien from state or local custody; and (4) provide DHS \n14 \nagents with “access to any correctional facility in order to meet with an alien (or an \n15 \nindividual believed to be an alien) and inquire as to his right to be or remain in the United \n16 \nStates.”2  Although DOJ did not make this argument in defending the materially identical \n17 \nconditions on the FY 2017 Byrne JAG grants, for the 2018 Byrne JAG grants DOJ now \n18 \nsuggests in the solicitation that compliance with the third and fourth conditions relating to \n19 \n“Notice” and “Access” is required under various statutory provisions of the Immigration \n20 \nand Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq. (“INA”). \n21 \n6.  DOJ also adds new and equally unlawful conditions, mandatory \n22 \ncertifications, and a questionnaire.  These new unlawful conditions require that \n23 \njurisdictions will “not . . . publicly disclose federal law enforcement information in an \n24 \nattempt to conceal, harbor, or shield certain individuals from detection, including in \n25 \n26 \n                                                 \n27 \n2 FY 2018 Byrne JAG Solicitation (“2018 Solicitation”) at 36-37, available at \n28  https://www.bja.gov/funding/JAGLocal18.pdf.   \n2 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 4 of 52   Page ID #:182\n \nviolation of 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)” and include a certification that the jurisdiction does not \n1 \nhave “any law, rule, policy, or practice” that would “require or authorize the public \n2 \ndisclosure of federal law enforcement information in order to conceal, harbor, or shield \n3 \nfrom detection fugitives from justice or aliens illegally in the United States.”  Section \n4 \n1324(a) is a statute that criminally punishes persons who, among other things, harbor \n5 \nillegal aliens.  The conditions also include certifying compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1366, a \n6 \nstatute that requires the Attorney General to make reports to Congress. \n7 \n7.  The 2018 Solicitation states that applicants, to accept the FY 2018 award, \n8 \n“must submit[] the specific certifications regarding compliance,” which contain the above \n9 \nconditions.  2018 Solicitation at 1. \n10 \n8.  Nothing in the Byrne JAG legislation that Congress enacted permits BJA to \n11 \ncondition federal funding to a local jurisdiction on that jurisdiction’s willingness to \n12 \nengage in federal civil immigration enforcement.  To the contrary, such conditions are \n13 \nantithetical to the purpose for which Congress created the funding program—that is, to \n14 \nsupport local criminal justice programs. \n15 \nThe Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant Program \n16 \n17  9.  The Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant is issued under authority of Subchapter \n18  II, Part E of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, as amended \n19  (“Juvenile Justice Act”).3  Under that part of the Juvenile Justice Act, Congress \n20  authorized the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (“OJJDP”) to make \n21  grants to units of local government “to carry out projects for the development, testing, \n22  and demonstration of promising initiatives and programs for the prevention, control, or \n23  reduction of juvenile delinquency.”  34 U.S.C. § 11171(a) (emphasis added).

L. No. 115-141, Mar. 23, \n3  2018, 132 Stat. 348, 423, Congress provided “$27,500,000 for delinquency prevention, as \n4  authorized by section 505 of the Juvenile Justice Act, of which, pursuant to sections 261 \n5  and 262 [34 U.S.C. §§ 11171 and 11172] thereof . . . (B) $4,000,000 shall be for gang \n6  and youth violence education, prevention and intervention, and related activities.” \n7  (emphasis added). \n8  10.  This Program is administered by OJJDP, which is a component of DOJ’s \n9  OJP.  OJJDP’s stated goals for the grant include to “[r]educe and sustain reductions in \n10  community youth violence, particularly gun and gang violence, and victimization” and \n11  “[i]ncrease the safety, well-being, and healthy development of children, youth, and \n12  families.”  OJJDP Solicitation at 7.   \n13  11.  The OJJDP Solicitation contains four conditions materially identical to the \n14  conditions on the FY 2017 Byrne JAG grant that have been enjoined by courts, including \n15  two enjoined by this Court.  Again, these conditions require States and localities to:  (1) \n16  comply with 8 U.S.C. § 1373, which provides that States and localities “may not prohibit, \n17  or in any way restrict” government entities and officials from “sending to, or receiving \n18  from” DHS information “regarding the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or \n19  unlawful, of any individual”; (2) comply with 8 U.S.C. § 1644, which provides that no \n20  States and localities “may be prohibited, or in any way restricted” from “sending to or \n21  receiving from” DHS “the immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of an alien in the \n22  United States”; (3) provide 48 hours’ advance notice to DHS, “where feasible” and when \n23  requested, before releasing an alien from state or local custody; and (4) provide DHS \n24 \n                                                 \n25 \n4  Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, Office of Justice Programs, \n26  U.S. Department of Justice, “Frequently Asked Questions, OJJDP FY 2018 Gang \nSuppression Planning Grants Program,” available at \n27 \nhttp://www.ojjdp.gov/grants/solicitations/FY2018/FAQ/GangPlan.pdf (“OJJDP FAQ”). \n28 \n4 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 6 of 52   Page ID #:184\n \nagents with “access to any correctional facility in order to meet with an alien (or an \n1 \nindividual believed to be an alien) and inquire as to his right to be or remain in the United \n2 \nStates.” 5  And, again, although it did not make this argument in defending the materially \n3 \nidentical conditions on the FY 2017 Byrne JAG grants, DOJ now suggests that \n4 \ncompliance with the third and fourth conditions relating to “Notice” and “Access” is \n5 \nrequired under various statutory provisions of the INA. \n6 \n12.  DOJ’s unlawful conditions also require that jurisdictions will “not . . . \n7 \npublicly disclose federal law enforcement information in an attempt to conceal, harbor, or \n8 \nshield certain individuals from detection, including in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)” \n9 \nand include a certification that the jurisdiction does not have “any law, rule, policy, or \n10 \npractice” that would “require or authorize the public disclosure of federal law \n11 \nenforcement information in order to conceal, harbor, or shield from detection fugitives \n12 \nfrom justice or aliens illegally in the United States.”  Section 1324(a) is a statute that \n13 \ncriminally punishes persons who harbor illegal aliens.  The conditions also include \n14 \ncertifying compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1366, a statute that requires the Attorney General \n15 \nto make reports to Congress. \n16 \n13.  DOJ’s solicitation states that “in order validly to accept an FY 2018 award \n17 \nunder this solicitation, the chief legal officer of that entity must properly execute, and the \n18 \napplicant must submit, the specific certifications regarding compliance with certain \n19 \nfederal laws,” which contain the above conditions.  OJJDP Solicitation, at 2. \n20 \n14.  The Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant solicitation also contains a priority \n21 \nconsideration which provides that an “applicant may receive priority consideration by \n22 \nexplaining how it would address the problem area identified in its application through \n23 \ncooperation with immigration authorities . . . .”  OJJDP Solicitation, at 10. \n24 \n25 \n                                                 \n26 \n5  Both the Notice and Access conditions include the following parenthetical note, with \n27  no further elaboration: “Note: this condition will apply only with respect to alien adult \ndetainees and only in jurisdictions where law enforcement is assisting in implementing \n28 \nthis program.” \n5 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 7 of 52   Page ID #:185\n \n15.  Congress did not authorize OJJDP to condition Juvenile Gang Prevention \n1 \nGrant funds on a jurisdiction’s participation in federal civil immigration enforcement, and \n2 \nto do so is contrary to the purpose for which Congress created the program—that is to \n3 \n“support State and local programs that prevent juvenile involvement in delinquent \n4 \nbehavior,” 34 U.S.C. § 11102(1); “assist State and local governments in promoting public \n5 \nsafety by encouraging accountability for acts of juvenile delinquency,” id. § 11102(2); \n6 \nand “assist State and local governments in addressing juvenile crime through the \n7 \nprovision of technical assistance, research, training, evaluation, and the dissemination of \n8 \ninformation on effective programs for combating juvenile delinquency,” id. § 11102(3). \n9 \nUnlawful Conditions \n10 \n16.  The immigration conditions that DOJ has imposed on the FY 2018 Byrne \n11 \nJAG and Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant flout the rationale of earlier rulings by this \n12 \nCourt, which has enjoined the imposition of immigration-related conditions as to both the \n13 \nFY 2017 Byrne JAG and a different DOJ-administered federal grant program related to \n14 \ncommunity-oriented policing.6   \n15 \n17.  In addition to re-imposing those conditions for the FY 2018 Byrne JAG and \n16 \nJuvenile Gang Prevention Grant that have previously been enjoined for FY 2017 Byrne \n17 \nJAG grants, DOJ adds new and equally unlawful conditions, mandatory certifications, \n18 \n19 \n                                                 \n20  6  Plaintiff here, the City of Los Angeles, previously filed a lawsuit in this District Court \nchallenging FY 2017 Byrne JAG grant conditions, along with conditions on the FY 2017 \n21 \nCommunity Oriented Policing Services (“COPS”) Hiring Program grant, in City of Los \n22  Angeles v. Sessions, Case No. 2:17-cv-07215-R-JCx.  The Court granted summary \njudgment to the City against the immigration-related conditions on the COPS grant \n23 \ncauses of action and permanently enjoined DOJ from imposing those conditions in future \n24  COPS grant cycles.  City of Los Angeles v. Sessions, 293 F. Supp. 3d 1087 (C.D. Cal. \n2018), appeal pending.  And, the Court granted Los Angeles’ motion for a preliminary \n25 \ninjunction against similar conditions on the FY 2017 Byrne JAG  (Case No. 2:17-CV-\n26  07215-R-JC).  Moreover, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and \nfederal district courts in Chicago and Philadelphia all have enjoined the conditions on the \n27 \nFY 2017 Byrne JAG. \n28   \n6 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 8 of 52   Page ID #:186\n \nand a questionnaire, all of which seek to deny funds to jurisdictions like Los Angeles that \n1 \nuse their funds and resources for local criminal justice programs rather than to participate \n2 \nin federal civil immigration enforcement.  The immigration-related conditions, questions, \n3 \nand certifications that permeate both the 2018 Byrne JAG and the Juvenile Gang \n4 \nPrevention Grant solicitations are facially unconstitutional and otherwise unlawful for a \n5 \nnumber of reasons.   \n6 \n18.  First, the immigration-related conditions, questions, and certifications \n7 \nviolate the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers.  The constitutional authority to \n8 \nspend federal government money, and to attach reasonable and lawful terms and \n9 \nconditions to the receipt of federal funds, belongs to Congress, not the Executive Branch.  \n10 \nDOJ, as an agency of the Executive Branch, may not unilaterally impose terms on federal \n11 \ngrants to States and local governments in the absence of a specific and unambiguous \n12 \nauthorization from Congress, which has not occurred with respect to the immigration-\n13 \nrelated conditions DOJ seeks to attach to the FY 2018 Byrne JAG and Juvenile Gang \n14 \nPrevention Grant.  On this basis alone, the funding conditions violate the Constitution. \n15 \n19.  DOJ’s actions also offend the basic separation of powers principle that an \n16 \nExecutive Branch agency has no power to act unless Congress has delegated authority to \n17 \nit.  See City & Cty. of San Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.2d 1225, 1234 (9th Cir. 2018) \n18 \n(holding that the Executive Order conditioning all federal funding on compliance with 8 \n19 \nU.S.C. § 1373 is an unlawful attempt by the Trump Administration to “coopt” for itself \n20 \nCongress’s exclusive spending power). \n21 \n20.  DOJ’s FY 2018 immigration-related conditions are not authorized by, and \n22 \nindeed are incompatible with, the statute Congress enacted establishing the Byrne JAG \n23 \nProgram because the conditions cannot be reconciled with Congress’s directive that funds \n24 \nbe allocated for local criminal justice efforts through an explicit funding formula \n25 \ninvolving only two factors:  community population and rates of violent crime.  DOJ’s \n26 \nconditions also undermine Congress’s express directive that Byrne JAG funds be used \n27 \nonly to provide seven types of support for community criminal justice efforts, through \n28 \n7 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 9 of 52   Page ID #:187\n \neight types of specified local criminal justice programs.  DOJ’s conditions would redirect \n1 \nthose funds to State and local law enforcement agencies that participate in federal civil \n2 \nimmigration enforcement.  On September 13, 2018, this Court issued an order granting \n3 \nthe City’s request for a preliminary injunction enjoining DOJ’s efforts to impose two \n4 \nimmigration-related conditions on 2017 Byrne JAG grants.  This Court ruled that those \n5 \nDOJ conditions were “a violation of the separation of powers doctrine and ultra vires.”  \n6 \nOrder Granting Plaintiff’s Application for Preliminary Injunction, at 4; City of Los \n7 \nAngeles v. Sessions, 2:17-CV-07215-R-JC (Dkt. 93).  Multiple other courts nationwide \n8 \nhave reached the same conclusion.  City of Chicago v. Sessions, 264 F. Supp. 3d 933, 943 \n9 \n(N.D. Ill. 2017); City of Philadelphia v. Sessions, 280 F. Supp. 3d 579, 659 (E.D. Pa. \n10 \n2017); City of Chicago v. Sessions, 888 F.3d 272, 293 (7th Cir. 2018); City of \n11 \nPhiladelphia v. Sessions, 309 F. Supp. 3d 289, 321, 331 (E.D. Pa. 2018); City of Chicago \n12 \nv. Sessions, No. 17 C 5720, 2018 WL 3608564, at *13 (N.D. Ill. July 27, 2018). \n13 \n21.  Similarly, DOJ’s immigration-related conditions are not authorized by, and \n14 \nare incompatible with, the statutes establishing the Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant \n15 \nprogram.  The conditions cannot be reconciled with Congress’s directive that grants of \n16 \nfederal funds be made to States and units of local government “to carry out projects for \n17 \nthe development, testing, and demonstration of promising initiatives and programs for the \n18 \nprevention, control, or reduction of juvenile delinquency.”  34 U.S.C. § 11171(a). \n19 \nCongress did not mention the term “immigration,” or any variation of that term, in any of \n20 \nthe enabling legislation for the Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant.  Further, Congress did \n21 \nnot include anything in this enabling legislation to indicate that a local jurisdiction’s \n22 \ncooperation or collaboration with federal immigration enforcement authorities furthers \n23 \nthe purpose of grants made under the Juvenile Justice Act’s authority, such as the \n24 \nJuvenile Gang Prevention Grant.  To the contrary, the Juvenile Justice Act identifies the \n25 \ncollaborative element in juvenile delinquency prevention programs as being local in \n26 \nnature, involving “juveniles, their families, local public agencies, and community based \n27 \norganizations[.]”  Id.  The enabling legislation states that “[c]oordinated juvenile justice \n28 \n8 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 10 of 52   Page ID #:188\n \nand delinquency prevention projects that meet the needs of juveniles through the \n1 \ncollaboration of the many local service systems juveniles encounter can help prevent \n2 \njuveniles from becoming delinquent and help delinquent youth return to a productive \n3 \nlife.”  Id. § 11101(a)(11) (emphasis added).  Indeed, OJJDP’s own Comprehensive Gang \n4 \nModel echoes the idea of local collaboration by identifying “Suppression” as \n5 \n“community policing with formal and informal social controls and accountability \n6 \nmeasures.”7  Many communities, like the City of Los Angeles, have made the public \n7 \nsafety determination that participation by local law enforcement agencies in federal civil \n8 \nimmigration enforcement agencies works in opposition to engendering trust with local \n9 \nyouth, who may be undocumented or be citizens with undocumented parents or other \n10 \nfamily members. \n11 \n22.  DOJ’s conditions are unrelated to the Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant’s \n12 \nthree statutorily authorized purposes: “to support State and local programs that prevent \n13 \njuvenile involvement in delinquent behavior,” id. § 11102(1); “assist State and local \n14 \ngovernments in promoting public safety by encouraging accountability for acts of \n15 \njuvenile delinquency,” id. § 11102(2); and “assist State and local governments in \n16 \naddressing juvenile crime through the provision of technical assistance, research, \n17 \ntraining, evaluation, and the dissemination of information on effective programs for \n18 \ncombating juvenile delinquency,” id. § 11102(3).  The reasoning of this Court and others \n19 \nin the cases cited above, concluding that such conditions violate the separation of powers \n20 \nand are ultra vires, is equally applicable to the Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant. \n21 \n23.  DOJ cannot mount an end-run around these court rulings by now claiming \n22 \nthat the same unconstitutional conditions are justified as conditions on these grants \n23 \n24 \n                                                 \n25 \n7  Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, Office of Justice Programs, \n26  U.S. Department of Justice, Nat’l Gang Ctr., “A Law Enforcement Official’s Guide to the \nOJJDP Comprehensive Gang Model,” at 1, available at \n27 \nhttps://www.nationalgangcenter.gov/Content/Documents/LE-Officials-Guide-to-OJJDP-\n28  Comprehensive-Gang-Model.pdf (“OJJDP Solicitation”). \n9 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 11 of 52   Page ID #:189\n \nbecause they relate to other federal statutes.  As part of the Byrne JAG application, an \n1 \napplicant must certify that it “will comply with all provisions of this part and all other \n2 \napplicable Federal laws.”  34 U.S.C. § 10153(a)(5)(D) (emphasis added).  But, the \n3 \nfederal laws in which DOJ purports to ground its immigration-related conditions are not \n4 \n“applicable” laws.  The civil immigration-related conditions have no relevance to federal \n5 \ngrants, the local criminal justice subject matter of the Byrne JAG Program, or the local \n6 \njuvenile delinquency prevention subject matter of the Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant.  \n7 \nMoreover, the civil immigration-related conditions are not valid federal laws, because \n8 \nthey are either facially unconstitutional or unconstitutional as DOJ seeks to interpret and \n9 \napply them here. \n10 \n24.  The FY 2018 Byrne JAG and Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant applications \n11 \nalso contravene Congress’s statutory mandate in 34 U.S.C. § 10228(a) prohibiting DOJ’s \n12 \nuse of the Byrne JAG statute to “exercise any direction, supervision, or control over any \n13 \npolice force or any other criminal justice agency of any State or any political subdivision \n14 \nthereof.”   \n15 \n25.  Second, even if the solicitations’ immigration-related conditions had been \n16 \nimposed by Congress rather than DOJ, they would be unconstitutional under the \n17 \nSpending Clause and Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which limit \n18 \nthe power of the federal government to restrict federal funding for the States (and their \n19 \nmunicipalities) based on matters of law and policy that are properly reserved to the \n20 \nStates. \n21 \n26.  When Congress attaches new terms to federal funds, it must meet several \n22 \nrequirements to ensure that it is not exceeding its spending power to improperly regulate \n23 \nState and local officials.  Under the Spending Clause, terms that Congress imposes on use \n24 \nof federal funds by a State or local government must be unambiguous and sufficiently \n25 \nrelated to the purpose of those federal funds.  Congress created the Byrne JAG Program \n26 \nfor the express purpose of funding local criminal justice efforts through statutorily-\n27 \nspecified types of support and programs.  Congress created the Juvenile Gang Prevention \n28 \n10 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 12 of 52   Page ID #:190\n \nGrant program to provide funds to States and units of local government “to carry out \n1 \nprojects for the development, testing, and demonstration of promising initiatives and \n2 \nprograms for the prevention, control, or reduction of juvenile delinquency.”  34 U.S.C. § \n3 \n11171(a).  DOJ’s immigration-related conditions do not relate to these purposes or to the \n4 \ntypes of support and programs that Congress specified in the applicable establishing \n5 \nstatute.  Rather, DOJ is attempting to use these grant programs to reward localities that \n6 \nparticipate in federal civil immigration enforcement, and punish those that do not.  In \n7 \naddition, certain of the conditions that DOJ included in the FY 2018 Byrne JAG \n8 \nsolicitation and the Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant are so ambiguous as to make it \n9 \ndifficult for Los Angeles to ascertain what is expected of it.  \n10 \n27.  Third, the conditions and certifications that DOJ has imposed in the FY \n11 \n2018 Byrne JAG and the Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant applications are a clear \n12 \nindication that DOJ unconstitutionally seeks to commandeer local police agencies to \n13 \nenforce federal civil immigration laws, in violation of the Tenth Amendment, confirmed \n14 \nby the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision in Murphy v. NCAA, 138 S. Ct. 1461, 1477 \n15 \n(2018) (“The Federal Government may not command [either in the affirmative or through \n16 \nprohibitive language] the States’ officers, or those of their political subdivisions, to \n17 \nadminister or enforce a federal regulatory program.” (citation omitted)).  Specifically, \n18 \nboth the FY 2018 Byrne JAG grant and the Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant require as a \n19 \ncondition to receiving funds a certification of compliance with 8 U.S.C. §§ 1373 and \n20 \n1644.  Both statutes violate the Tenth Amendment by giving direct orders to State and \n21 \nlocal governments.  See id. at 1476; see also Philadelphia, 309 F. Supp. 3d at 331 \n22 \n(holding Section 1373 unconstitutional under the anticommandeering doctrine); Chicago, \n23 \n2018 WL 3608564, at *13 (same); City & Cty. of San Francisco v. Sessions, No. 3:17-cv-\n24 \n04642, Dkt. 145 at 23-31 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 5, 2018) (same); United States v. California, \n25 \n314 F. Supp. 3d 1077, 1101 (E.D. Cal. 2018) (stating that “the constitutionality of Section \n26 \n1373 is highly suspect”). \n27 \n28 \n11 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 13 of 52   Page ID #:191\n \n28.  In addition, DOJ requires, as a condition for receiving FY 2018 Byrne JAG \n1 \nfunds and Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant funds, that jurisdictions certify that they will \n2 \nnot “impede” the exercise of authority of federal agents under a number of federal \n3 \nstatutes including 8 U.S.C. §§ 1226(a),(c), 1231(a), 1357(a)(1), and 1366(1),(3).8  \n4 \nJurisdictions also must “not . . . publicly disclose federal law enforcement information in \n5 \nan attempt to conceal, harbor, or shield certain individuals from detection, including in \n6 \nviolation of 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)” and must certify that they do not have “any law, rule, \n7 \npolicy, or practice” that would “require or authorize the public disclosure of federal law \n8 \nenforcement information in order to conceal, harbor, or shield from detection fugitives \n9 \nfrom justice or aliens illegally in the United States.” \n10 \n29.  But those statutes do not concern States or localities and thus have no \n11 \nbearing here.  DOJ’s apparent interpretations of those provisions as imposing mandates \n12 \non State and local governments is an unconstitutional effort to commandeer those States \n13 \nand localities to participate in federal civil immigration enforcement.  See Chicago, 888 \n14 \nF.3d at 282; California, 314 F. Supp. 3d at 1106-08.  \n15 \n30.  These requirements are especially disturbing because they do not exist in a \n16 \nvacuum.  High-ranking members of the Trump Administration have publicly proposed \n17 \narresting and prosecuting local elected officials in jurisdictions that decline to participate \n18 \nin federal civil immigration enforcement for “harboring.”   \n19 \n31.  In short, the required certifications put elected officials in Los Angeles in the \n20 \nuntenable position of either:  (1) certifying compliance with statutes that are not \n21 \napplicable and could not constitutionally be applicable to the City, and undermining the \n22 \nLos Angeles Police Department’s (“LAPD”) relationship with the immigrant community \n23 \nand threatening public safety; or (2) forfeiting FY 2018 Byrne JAG funding and Juvenile \n24 \n25 \n26                                                   \n8  The 2018 Byrne JAG grant requires the certifications be executed by the Mayor and the \n27 \nChief Legal Officer.  The Juvenile Gang Prevention solicitation requires the City \n28  Attorney execute the certifications.  \n12 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 14 of 52   Page ID #:192\n \nGang Prevention Grant funding used to support local criminal justice and juvenile \n1 \ndelinquency prevention efforts through combating gangs and violent crime.   \n2 \n32.  Fourth, the conditions placed by DOJ on recipients of the FY 2018 Byrne \n3 \nJAG funding and the Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant funding violate the Administrative \n4 \nProcedure Act (“APA”) because, in promulgating the new conditions, DOJ did not rely \n5 \non any analysis or findings to support its implicit premise that individuals whom DHS \n6 \nbelieves may be unlawfully present in the United States commit more crime than do \n7 \nindividuals legally resident in the country, and in fact failed to consider the substantial \n8 \nevidence to the contrary.  For this reason, DOJ’s attempt to attach the immigration-\n9 \nrelated conditions to FY 2018 Byrne JAG funding and the Juvenile Gang Prevention \n10 \nGrant funding is arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA. \n11 \n33.  In short, DOJ’s unilateral and unauthorized attempt to hold hostage federal \n12 \nfunding that Congress authorized to support State and local criminal justice programs and \n13 \nlocal juvenile delinquency prevention, and to instead cause State and local agencies to \n14 \nassist with federal civil immigration enforcement, is unconstitutional and unlawful, and \n15 \ncannot be allowed to stand.  Los Angeles seeks injunctive relief to ensure that DOJ does \n16 \nnot evade constitutional restraints, Congressional intent, and judicial rulings protecting \n17 \nfederal funding for State and local law enforcement criminal justice and local juvenile \n18 \ndelinquency prevention efforts. \n19 \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n20 \n34.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1346.  The Court \n21 \nalso has authority to award the relief requested pursuant to 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 705, 706, \n22 \nand 28 U.S.C. §§ 1361, 2201–2202. \n23 \n35.  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because Plaintiff \n24 \nresides in this District and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to this \n25 \naction occurred in this District. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n13 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 15 of 52   Page ID #:193\n \nPARTIES \n1 \n36.  Plaintiff Los Angeles is a municipal corporation organized and existing \n2 \nunder the laws of the State of California, and is a charter city pursuant to Article XI of the \n3 \nCalifornia Constitution. \n4 \n37.  Defendant Jefferson B. Sessions, III is the Attorney General of the United \n5 \nStates.  The Attorney General is charged with the administration and enforcement of \n6 \nfederal criminal law and policy, and oversees the U.S. Department of Justice, which \n7 \nadministers both the Byrne JAG and the Juvenile Gang Prevention Grants.  Defendant \n8 \nSessions has supervisory responsibility and is sued in his official capacity. \n9 \n38.  Defendant U.S. Department of Justice is an agency of the United States.  \n10 \nThe Bureau of Justice Assistance (“BJA”) is a component of OJP.  BJA’s stated mission \n11 \nis “to provide leadership and services in grant administration and criminal justice policy \n12 \ndevelopment to support local, state, and tribal justice strategies to achieve safer \n13 \ncommunities.”  BJA administers the Byrne JAG Program.  OJJDP is also a component of \n14 \nOJP.  OJJDP’s mission is to “provide national leadership, coordination, and resources to \n15 \nprevent and respond to juvenile delinquency and victimization.”  OJJDP administers the \n16 \nJuvenile Gang Prevention Grant. \n17 \n39.  Defendant Laura Rogers is Acting Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney \n18 \nGeneral of OJP at DOJ and oversees both BJA and OJJDP.  Defendant Rogers has \n19 \nsupervisory responsibility and is sued in her official capacity. \n20 \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n21 \nA.  Policies and Practices of the City of Los Angeles’ Police Department \n22 \n40.  For nearly four decades, LAPD has implemented policies and practices \n23 \ndesigned to promote the public safety of the residents of Los Angeles by engendering \n24 \ncooperation and trust between its law enforcement agencies and officers on the one hand, \n25 \nand members of the City’s many immigrant communities on the other.  The fundamental \n26 \ngoal of these local policies and practices has been to encourage crime victims and \n27 \nwitnesses of criminal conduct to cooperate with LAPD, irrespective of their immigration \n28 \n14 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 16 of 52   Page ID #:194\n \nstatus.  The policy is critical to public safety, especially in Los Angeles, in light of the \n1 \nsignificant size of the immigrant population here.  Central to these policies has been the \n2 \ndetermination by local law enforcement and its civilian overseers to devote local \n3 \nresources to local criminal justice efforts and leave to the federal government the \n4 \ninvestigation and enforcement of federal civil immigration laws. \n5 \n41.  For example, approximately 40 years ago, in 1979, LAPD began a policy \n6 \nknown as “Special Order 40”—adopted by the Los Angeles Board of Police \n7 \nCommissioners and signed by then-Chief of Police Daryl Gates—that restricts an LAPD \n8 \nofficer from initiating a police action with the objective of discovering a person’s \n9 \nimmigration status, and also prohibits arrests based solely on that status. \n10 \n42.  The policy behind Special Order 40, as expressed by the LAPD Board of \n11 \nPolice Commissioners nearly 40 years ago, is “the principle that effective law \n12 \nenforcement depends on a high degree of cooperation between the Department and the \n13 \npublic it serves.”  This policy was adopted to ensure that individuals, regardless of their \n14 \ncivil immigration status, would report crimes to the LAPD and assist the LAPD in \n15 \napprehending and prosecuting those individuals responsible for criminal acts. \n16 \n43.  The provisions of Special Order 40, which are reflected in various forms in \n17 \nLAPD’s existing policies and procedures, are also consistent with current federal and \n18 \nState law, because the policy restricts LAPD’s initiating a detention based on an \n19 \nindividual’s civil immigration status, and arresting an individual for a misdemeanor \n20 \nviolation that did not occur in the officer’s presence. \n21 \n44.  The LAPD policies promulgated after Special Order 40 are compliant with \n22 \nexisting federal law.  In the 2009 case, Sturgeon v. Bratton, the California Court of \n23 \nAppeal rejected a legal challenge to Special Order 40—as set forth in Section 4/264.50 of \n24 \nthe LAPD Manual—ruling that the language of the policy does not conflict with 8 U.S.C. \n25 \n§ 1373 (“Section 1373”), and is not invalid.  As the Court of Appeal recognized, Section \n26 \n1373 addresses certain communications between federal and State or local authorities; \n27 \nSpecial Order 40 does not address that issue, but rather prohibits police officers from \n28 \n15 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 17 of 52   Page ID #:195\n \ninitiating police action to determine immigration status and making arrests for illegal \n1 \nentry.  174 Cal. App. 4th 1407 (Cal. Ct. App. 2009).  It has nothing to do with \n2 \ncommunications between LAPD and federal authorities. \n3 \n45.  In 2014, LAPD adopted a practice of refusing to detain individuals, \n4 \notherwise eligible for release from custody under State law, on the basis of requests from \n5 \nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) unless the requests are supported by \n6 \na judicial determination of probable cause, or a valid warrant from a judicial officer.  This \n7 \npractice was developed in response to judicial decisions declaring compliance with \n8 \nwarrantless ICE requests to be unconstitutional, and thereby subjecting LAPD to \n9 \npotentially significant liability for violations of the Fourth Amendment.  See, e.g., \n10 \nMiranda-Olivares v. Clackamas County, No. 3:12-cv-02317-ST, 2014 WL 1414305, at \n11 \n*11 (D. Or. Apr. 11, 2014).  In addition, this practice supports LAPD’s robust community \n12 \npolicing strategy focused on preventing crime through community partnerships, \n13 \ncollaborative problem solving, and building public trust consistent with the law—\n14 \nessential components to reducing crime and protecting the public from harm. \n15 \n46.  When a member of LAPD arrests an individual in connection with a \n16 \ncriminal offense, the arrestee may be cited and released in the field where circumstances \n17 \nwarrant, or taken to one of LAPD’s ten jail detention facilities for booking.  Those LAPD \n18 \njail facilities are categorized by the State of California as Type I facilities, which are local \n19 \ndetention facilities used for the temporary, short-term detention of persons who may be \n20 \nheld for no more than 96 hours.  In practice, persons arrested by members of LAPD \n21 \ngenerally are kept in LAPD custody for no more than 48 hours after arrest because of the \n22 \nlimitations imposed by State law and the Constitution with respect to the period of time \n23 \nwithin which law enforcement agencies must:  (1) obtain a probable cause determination \n24 \nthat an arrested individual committed a criminal offense to support the detention of the \n25 \nindividual without a warrant; and (2) transfer a detainee to court for arraignment.  See \n26 \nCal. Pen. Code § 825; Cty. of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44 (1991). \n27 \n28 \n16 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 18 of 52   Page ID #:196\n \n47.  In many situations, arrestees are eligible for release from custody within a \n1 \nfew hours of arrest and booking, including by posting bail or bond, on their own \n2 \nrecognizance, or by a certificate of release. \n3 \n48.  While arrestees are in LAPD custody, LAPD permits DHS and ICE \n4 \npersonnel access to LAPD detention facilities to interview individual arrestees regarding \n5 \ncivil immigration status.  LAPD does so consistent with the State statutory requirement \n6 \nthat such persons be provided with advance written notice explaining the purpose of the \n7 \ninterview, that the interview is voluntary, and that the person may decline to speak or opt \n8 \nto be interviewed only in the presence of his or her attorney.  See California TRUTH Act, \n9 \nCal. Gov. Code § 7283 et seq.  LAPD obtains a written expression of the arrestee’s \n10 \nwillingness prior to the interview.  If the arrestee declines the interview, LAPD does not \n11 \nprovide DHS and ICE personnel access to that individual in its facilities. \n12 \nB.  The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program \n13 \n49.  Congress established the Byrne JAG Program to make grants “for use by the \n14 \nState or unit of local government” in order to provide seven types of support for criminal \n15 \njustice efforts, i.e., “additional personnel, equipment, supplies, contractual support, \n16 \ntraining, technical assistance, and information systems for criminal justice.”  34 U.S.C. \n17 \n§ 10152(a)(1).  Congress specified that these funds be used “for any one or more of the \n18 \nfollowing programs”: \n19 \n20  •  “Law enforcement programs.” \n21  •  “Prosecution and court programs.” \n22  •  “Prevention and education programs.” \n23  •  “Corrections and community corrections programs.” \n24  •  “Drug treatment and enforcement programs.” \n25  •  “Planning, evaluation, and technology improvement programs.” \n26  •  “Crime victim and witness programs (other than compensation).” \n27  •  “Mental health programs and related law enforcement and corrections \nprograms, including behavioral programs and crisis intervention teams.” \n28 \n17 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 19 of 52   Page ID #:197\n \nId. § 10152(a)(1)(A)-(H). \n1 \n50.  Byrne JAG funding is administered by BJA within OJP.  Id. §§ 10151-58.  \n2 \nEach fiscal year, BJA provides State and local government awardees with funds that, in \n3 \ngeneral, may be used over a period of four years. \n4 \n51.  In awarding funds, BJA must follow the congressionally-mandated formula \n5 \nto allocate funds to eligible States and local governments.  By statute, Congress required \n6 \nthat funding be allocated based on two factors:  population and rate of violent crime.  The \n7 \nAttorney General must allocate 50 percent of the available funds to each State recipient in \n8 \namounts proportionate to its population.  Id. § 10156(a).  The remaining 50 percent of the \n9 \nfunds is allocated to each State recipient in amounts proportionate to its rate of violent \n10 \ncrime.  Id.  Of the total amount allocated to a State, 60 percent is provided as a direct \n11 \ngrant to the State, and 40 percent as grants for local governments in that State.  Id. § \n12 \n10156(b)(2), (d). \n13 \n52.  Local governments wishing to receive a grant must submit an award \n14 \napplication to BJA.  In order to be eligible for an award, Congress specified that an \n15 \napplicant must furnish certain reasonable and grant-specific certifications and assurances \n16 \nrelated to the application or administration of the grant.  Specifically, Congress \n17 \nenumerated two certifications and three assurances that an applicant must make: \n18 \n19  •  “A certification that Federal funds made available under this part will not be \nused to supplant State or local funds, but will be used to increase the \n20 \namounts of such funds that would, in the absence of Federal funds, be made \n21 \navailable for law enforcement activities.”  Id. § 10153(a)(1). \n22 \n23  •  “An assurance that, not fewer than 30 days before the application (or any \namendment to the application) was submitted to the Attorney General, the \n24 \napplication (or amendment) was submitted for review to the governing body  \n25 \nof the State or unit of local government (or to an organization designated by \n26 \nthat governing body).”  Id. § 10153(a)(2). \n27 \n28 \n18 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 20 of 52   Page ID #:198\n \n1  •  “An assurance that, before the application (or any amendment to the \napplication) was submitted to the Attorney General (A) the application (or \n2 \namendment) was made public; and (B) an opportunity to comment on the \n3 \napplication (or amendment) was provided to citizens and to neighborhood or \n4 \ncommunity-based organizations, to the extent applicable law or established \n5 \nprocedure makes such an opportunity available.”  Id. § 10153(a)(3). \n6 \n7  •  “An assurance that, for each fiscal year covered by an application, the \napplicant shall maintain and report such data, records, and information \n8 \n(programmatic and financial) as the Attorney General may reasonably \n9 \nrequire.”  Id. § 10153(a)(4). \n10 \n11  •  “A certification . . . that (A) the programs to be funded by the grant meet all \nthe requirements of this part; (B) all the information contained in the \n12 \napplication is correct; (C) there has been appropriate coordination with \n13 \naffected agencies; and (D) the applicant will comply with all provisions of \n14 \nthis part and all other applicable Federal laws.”  Id. § 10153(a)(5). \n15 \n53.  Byrne JAG applications are accepted through an online program.  In order to \n16 \ncomplete the application, a representative of the applicant is required to electronically \n17 \nsign a page stating that the applicant will comply with standard “assurances” promulgated \n18 \nby the Office of Management and Budget.  These assurances include that, “throughout \n19 \nthe period of performance for the award,” “the Applicant will comply with all award \n20 \nrequirements.” \n21 \n54.  When BJA approves an application for a Byrne JAG award, BJA requires \n22 \nthe recipient to agree to an additional set of “Special Conditions.”  These conditions \n23 \ngenerally relate to the administration of the grant or the use of grant funds.  The “Special \n24 \nConditions” imposed in Los Angeles’ fiscal year FY 2016 grant award (the last year in \n25 \nwhich Byrne JAG funds were released to Los Angeles) governed various aspects of how \n26 \nthe City would be required to administer its Byrne JAG award, such as a “[r]equirement \n27 \nfor data on performance and effectiveness under the award,” “[r]equirements related to \n28 \n19 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 21 of 52   Page ID #:199\n \nSystem for Award Management and Unique Entity Identifiers,” compliance with civil \n1 \nrights and nondiscrimination regulations in the administration of the award, and reporting \n2 \nof any fraud, waste, and abuse in the award implementation. \n3 \n \n4  C.  The City of Los Angeles Uses Byrne JAG Funds For Critical Local \nCriminal Justice Needs \n5 \n55.  Each year since 1997, the City of Los Angeles has been approved for more \n6 \nthan $1 million in funding under the Byrne JAG Program (and its predecessor).   \n7 \n56.  In the FY 2016 application cycle, Los Angeles applied for and received \n8 \napproximately $1.8 million in Byrne JAG funding for FY 2016 through FY 2019. \n9 \nApproximately $800,000 of the funding went to the County of Los Angeles as a \n10 \nsubgrantee, and $1 million remained with the City.  For FY 2016, Los Angeles received \n11 \nits funding directly from the federal government as part of a formula grant, see 34 U.S.C. \n12 \n§ 10156(d), not as a distribution from the Byrne JAG funds awarded separately to the \n13 \nState of California. \n14 \n57.  Byrne JAG funds support important criminal justice programs in Los \n15 \nAngeles.  Specifically, the City’s FY 2016 Byrne JAG funds assist in funding its \n16 \nCommunity Law Enforcement and Recovery (“CLEAR”) program, which aims to reduce \n17 \ngang violence in Los Angeles and rehabilitate communities that have experienced \n18 \nsignificant criminal activity.  Through effective collaboration among several city, county, \n19 \nand state criminal justice agencies, the program targets high-crime areas and promotes \n20 \ncommunity recovery by working closely with special criminal investigative units, an \n21 \naggressive vertical prosecutorial program, probation and parole officers, youth \n22 \nintervention organizations, and schools. \n23 \n58.  The CLEAR program has been successful.  In 2014, the CLEAR program \n24 \nareas had 22 percent less gang crime over a three-year period than similar non-CLEAR \n25 \nareas.  For FY 2016, the Byrne JAG funds supported 20 to 30 percent of the salaries for \n26 \nnine Deputy City Attorneys, nine Deputy District Attorneys, and nine Deputy Probation \n27 \nofficers related to the CLEAR program. \n28 \n20 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 22 of 52   Page ID #:200\n \n59.  The City’s use of Byrne JAG funds to support the CLEAR program and \n1 \nreduce local violent crime advances the core criminal justice mission of the Byrne JAG \n2 \nProgram.  The CLEAR program’s key to success in reducing violent crime in targeted \n3 \nneighborhoods has been the dedication of various agency assets to the goal of reducing \n4 \ncrime in CLEAR sites.  Each CLEAR site includes an operational team made up of \n5 \nrepresentatives from LAPD, the County District Attorney’s Office, the City Attorney’s \n6 \nOffice, and the County Probation Department.  In addition to their focus on reducing \n7 \ncrime, the CLEAR team members collaborate with residents within each CLEAR site \n8 \nthrough the creation of a Community Impact Team.  Community members on the team \n9 \nidentify effective community organizations in their CLEAR area, and facilitate a \n10 \nrelationship between those organizations and CLEAR team members to secure support \n11 \nfrom individuals and businesses within the community. \n12 \n60.  The year-over-year federal funding for the CLEAR program has been a \n13 \ncatalyst for turning Los Angeles into a leader on coordinated approaches to seemingly \n14 \nintractable issues related to local violent crime in general, and gang-related violence in \n15 \nparticular.  The CLEAR model was innovative, and went beyond the traditional methods \n16 \nof criminal suppression.  It combined, in one program, elements which have been copied \n17 \nby numerous other jurisdictions, and are now a common approach to addressing not only \n18 \ngang violence, but violent crimes generally.  These elements, such as vertical prosecution \n19 \nof all cases, regular sharing of best practices from public safety teams in various parts of \n20 \nthe City, and community outreach, have significantly informed the creation of other \n21 \ninnovative approaches to criminal justice in the City, such as the City Attorney’s \n22 \nneighborhood prosecutor program. \n23 \n61.  On October 4, 2018, Los Angeles received its 2017 Byrne JAG award.  \n24 \nDespite this Court’s entry of a preliminary injunction prohibiting DOJ from imposing its \n25 \nunlawful immigration conditions, see City of Los Angeles v. Sessions, No. 17-cv-07215-\n26 \nR, Order Granting Plaintiff’s Application for Preliminary Injunction, Dkt. 93 (C.D. Cal. \n27 \n28 \n21 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 23 of 52   Page ID #:201\n \nSept. 13, 2018), DOJ has included the unlawful conditions in Los Angeles’s FY 2017 \n1 \nByrne JAG award document.  \n2 \n62.  The City submitted its application for FY 2018 Byrne JAG funding, in \n3 \nadvance of the deadline of August 22, 2018.  If Los Angeles were to be deprived of its \n4 \nstatutorily authorized FY 2018 Byrne JAG funding as well, Los Angeles would lose \n5 \nvaluable resources needed to enhance its local criminal justice efforts and advance public \n6 \nsafety.  Consistent Byrne JAG funding ensures that the CLEAR staff can continue to \n7 \ndedicate their time to their roles within the CLEAR team.  The funding also ensures that \n8 \nthe City’s continued dedication to cross-agency collaboration will pave the way for future \n9 \nsuccesses and innovations still to come. \n10 \nD. The Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant Program \n11 \n63.  Congress created the Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant under authority of \n12 \nSubchapter II, Part E of the Juvenile Justice Act.  In the 2018 Consolidated \n13 \nAppropriations Act, Pub. L. No. 115-141, Mar. 23, 2018, 132 Stat. 348, 423, Congress \n14 \nprovided “$27,500,000 for delinquency prevention, as authorized by section 505 of the \n15 \n[Juvenile Justice] Act, of which, pursuant to sections 261 and 262 [34 U.S.C. §§ 11171 \n16 \nand 11172] thereof . . . (B) $4,000,000 shall be for gang and youth violence education, \n17 \nprevention and intervention, and related activities.” (emphasis added). \n18 \n64.  Congress specified three purposes in Subchapter I and Subchapter II of the \n19 \nJuvenile Justice Act: “to support State and local programs that prevent juvenile \n20 \ninvolvement in delinquent behavior,” 34 U.S.C. § 11102(1); “to assist State and local \n21 \ngovernments in promoting public safety by encouraging accountability for acts of \n22 \njuvenile delinquency,” id. § 11102(2), and “to assist State and local governments in \n23 \naddressing juvenile crime through the provision of technical assistance, research, \n24 \ntraining, evaluation, and the dissemination of information on effective programs for \n25 \ncombating juvenile delinquency,” id. § 11102(3).   \n26 \n65.  Congress, in Part E of Subchapter II,  authorized OJJDP to “make grants to \n27 \n. . . units of general local government . . . to carry out projects for the development, \n28 \n22 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 24 of 52   Page ID #:202\n \ntesting, and demonstration of promising initiatives and programs for the prevention, \n1 \ncontrol, or reduction of juvenile delinquency.”  Id. § 11171(a).  In enacting the Juvenile \n2 \nJustice Act, Congress declared that the problem of local juvenile delinquency should be \n3 \naddressed through a “2-track common sense approach that addresses the needs of \n4 \nindividual juveniles and society at large by promoting (A) quality prevention programs \n5 \nthat (i) work with juveniles, their families, local public agencies, and community-based \n6 \norganizations, and take into consideration such factors as whether or not juveniles have \n7 \nbeen victims of family violence (including child abuse and neglect); and (ii) are designed \n8 \nto reduce risks and develop competencies in at-risk juveniles that will prevent, and reduce \n9 \nthe rate, violent delinquent behavior; and (B) programs that assist in holding juveniles \n10 \naccountable for their actions and in developing the competencies necessary to become \n11 \nresponsible and productive members of their communities . . . .”  Id. § 11101(a)(10). \n12 \n66.  The Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant is administered by the OJJDP within \n13 \nOJP.  Id. §§ 11111(a), 11171(a).  This is the first fiscal year for which OJJDP will \n14 \nprovide award funds under the Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant.  See OJJDP FAQ at 1.  \n15 \nOJJDP expects to make up to five awards of up to $200,000 each for an 18-month period \n16 \nof grant performance.  See OJJDP Solicitation at 12.   \n17 \n67.  In order to be eligible for an award, applicants must submit an application to \n18 \nOJJDP “at such time, in such form, and containing such information as the Administrator \n19 \nmay reasonably require by rule.”  34 U.S.C. § 11173.  Although not a formula grant, \n20 \nCongress limited the discretion of OJJDP by requiring such grants to be made, “to the \n21 \nextent reasonable and practicable, . . .to achieve an equitable geographical distribution of \n22 \nsuch projects throughout the United States.”  Id. § 11171(a). \n23 \n68.  The Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant program applications are accepted \n24 \nthrough an online program.  In order to receive award funds, a representative of the \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n23 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 25 of 52   Page ID #:203\n \napplicant is required to execute “Certified Standard Assurances”.9  These assurances \n1 \ninclude that “throughout the period of performance for the award,” the “Applicant will \n2 \ncomply with all award requirements[.]” \n3 \n69.  OJJDP will require any applicant selected for funding under the Juvenile \n4 \nGang Prevention Grant program to agree to a set of “award conditions.”  These \n5 \nconditions generally relate to the administration of the grant or the use of grant funds, \n6 \nsuch as “[r]equirement for data on performance and effectiveness under the award,” \n7 \n“[r]equirements related to System for Award Management and Unique Entity \n8 \nIdentifiers,” compliance with civil rights and nondiscrimination regulations in the \n9 \nadministration of the award, and reporting of any fraud, waste, and abuse in the award \n10 \nimplementation.  The “award conditions” may also include additional conditions that may \n11 \nrelate to the particular statute, program, or solicitation under which the award is made. Id. \n12 \n70.  Along with the “award conditions,” a successful applicant will be required to \n13 \nexecute certifications regarding lobbying; debarment, suspension and other responsibility \n14 \nmatters, and drug-free workplace requirements.

The City of Los Angeles Intends to Use the Juvenile Gang Prevention \nGrant Funds To Combat Local Juvenile Crime Perpetrated by MS-13 \n17 \nand Other Criminal Gangs \n \n18 \n71.  Since 2012, criminal activity in and around the MacArthur Park area of the \n19 \nCity has increased.  Crime data and interviews with community members suggests that \n20 \nthe increase may be a direct result of suspected gang activities of the MS-13 gang.  Thus, \n21 \nthe City has an important need to study and curtail the activities and recruitment efforts \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26                                                   \n9 See OJJDP Solicitation at 38.  See also Certified Standard Assurances, U.S. Department \n27 \nof Justice, OMB Approval Number 1121-0140, available at \n28  http://ojp.gov/funding/Apply/Resources/StandardAssurances.pdf. \n24 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 26 of 52   Page ID #:204\n \nof the MS-13 gang in Los Angeles and to develop strategies to prevent related juvenile \n1 \ndelinquency in local communities. \n2 \n72.  The LAPD is seeking the Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant funds to create a \n3 \nframework and strategic plan to combat local juvenile gang crime and violence that  \n4 \ninvolves the MS-13 gang.  During the 18-month project, the LAPD will undertake \n5 \nstrategic planning and capacity building through a data-driven approach.  The project will \n6 \nbe coordinated by LAPD’s Detective Bureau and will involve the Gang and Narcotics \n7 \nDivision, detectives and patrol officers at specific Patrol Divisions, a research team from \n8 \nJustice & Security Strategies, Inc. (JSS) and Arizona State University, and internal and \n9 \nexternal experts.  Other partners will be included as the project develops. \n10 \n73.  The Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant funds would support LAPD’s goals of: \n11 \n(1) using gang intelligence to achieve an enhanced understanding of MS-13 and how it is \n12 \naffecting local communities; (2) reducing gun and gang violence among youth in specific \n13 \nareas of the City that are identified through data analysis; (3) preventing violence within \n14 \naffected local communities; and (4) increasing safety among youth, families, and local \n15 \ncommunities affected by MS-13. \n16 \n \n17  F.  Multiple Courts Have Rejected DOJ’s Imposition of These Types Of \nFederal Civil Immigration-Related Conditions for FY 2017 Byrne JAG \n18 \nAwards \n19   \n74.  In the FY 2017 funding cycle, DOJ imposed immigration-related conditions \n20 \nin its solicitation for the FY 2017 Byrne JAG applications.  On August 3, 2017, BJA \n21 \nissued that solicitation for applications from local governments for FY 2017 Byrne JAG \n22 \ngrants.  One immigration-related condition in the agency’s solicitation stated that \n23 \napplicants were required to certify compliance with Section 1373 in order to qualify for \n24 \nByrne JAG funding (the “1373 Condition”).10  The FY 2017 Byrne JAG application \n25 \n26                                                   \n10  Bureau of Justice Assistance, Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice, \n27 \n“Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program:  FY 2017 Local \n28  Solicitation,” available at https://www.bja.gov/Funding/JAGLocal17.pdf (“Solicitation”). \n25 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 27 of 52   Page ID #:205\n \nwould not be considered complete without that certification, which meant jurisdictions \n1 \nthat were awarded Byrne JAG funds but that did not complete the 1373 Certification \n2 \nwould be prohibited from drawing down grant funds. \n3 \n75.  Separately, DOJ’s FY 2017 solicitation stated that the agency’s award would \n4 \ninclude two other, immigration-related conditions.  Those two conditions, referred to \n5 \nbelow as the “2017 Access Condition” and the “2017 Notice Condition”—as presented in \n6 \nFY 2017 Byrne JAG awards that DOJ has already disbursed—required that “as of the \n7 \ndate the recipient accepts [its] award,” the recipient must have in place “[a] local \n8 \nordinance, -rule, -regulation, -policy, or -practice (or an applicable State statute, -rule, -\n9 \nregulation, -policy, or -practice)” that is “designed to ensure” that: \n10 \na.  “agents of the United States acting under color of federal law in fact \n11 \nare given access [to] a local-government (or local-government-contracted) \n12 \ncorrectional facility for the purpose of permitting such agents to meet with \n13 \nindividuals who are (or are believed by such agents to be) aliens and to inquire as \n14 \nto such individuals’ right to be or remain in the United States” (the “2017 Access \n15 \nCondition”); and  \n16 \nb.  “when a local-government (or local-government contracted) \n17 \ncorrectional facility receives from DHS a formal written request authorized by the \n18 \nImmigration and Nationality Act that seeks advance notice of the scheduled release \n19 \ndate and time for a particular alien in such facility, then such facility will honor \n20 \nsuch request and--as early as practicable (see ‘Rules of Construction’ incorporated \n21 \nby para. 4.B. of this condition--provide the requested notice to DHS.” (the “2017 \n22 \n23  Notice Condition”). \nGreenville Award, ¶ 56(1) (emphasis added), attached hereto as Exhibit A. \n24 \n76.  In addition, the “Rules of Construction” referenced in DOJ’s 2017 Notice \n25 \nCondition stated:  “Nothing in this condition shall be understood to authorize or require \n26 \nany recipient, any subrecipient at any tier, any State or local government, or any other \n27 \nentity or individual to maintain (or detain) any individual in custody beyond the date and \n28 \n26 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 28 of 52   Page ID #:206\n \ntime the individual would have been released in the absence of this condition.”  Id. ¶¶ 55-\n1 \n56, at Para. 4.B. \n2 \n77.  The DOJ 2017 Rules of Construction also stated:  “Current DHS practice is \n3 \nordinarily to request advance notice of scheduled release ‘as early as practicable (at least \n4 \n48 hours, if possible).’ (See DHS Form I-247A (3/17)).  In the event that (e.g., in light of \n5 \nthe date DHS made such request) the scheduled release date and time for an alien are \n6 \nsuch as not to permit the advance notice that DHS has requested, it shall not be a \n7 \nviolation of this condition to provide only as much advance notice as practicable.”  Id. \n8 \n78.  This Court, in an order issued on September 13, 2018, held that DOJ’s \n9 \nAccess Condition and the Notice Condition for the FY 2017 Byrne JAG grant were ultra \n10 \nvires and violated the separation of powers.11 \n11 \n12  G.  DOJ Imposes Conditions, Certifications, and Questions Relating to \nFederal Civil Immigration Enforcement on the Agency Solicitation for \n13 \nthe FY 2018 Byrne JAG and the Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant \n14  Despite Contrary Court Rulings in FY 2017 Byrne JAG Litigation. \n15  79.  In the FY 2018 Byrne JAG and the Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant funding \n16  solicitations, released on July 20, 2018 and September 7, 2018, respectively, DOJ \n17  doubles-down by:  (1) employing new versions of the conditions that have previously \n18  been enjoined as unlawful, now disguised as requirements purportedly imposed by \n19  various preexisting statutes; (2) adding new, unconstitutional conditions; (3) requiring \n20  unlawful certifications by the City’s Mayor and/or Chief Legal Officer after implied \n21  threats of criminal arrest of local officials in jurisdictions that do not cooperate with \n22  federal immigration enforcement; and (4) mandating that the City disclose to the federal \n23 \n24 \n                                                 \n25 \n11  Additionally, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, as well as \n26 \nfederal district courts in Chicago and Philadelphia, held that the Access Condition and the \n27  Notice Condition for the FY 2017 Byrne JAG grant were ultra vires and violated the \nseparation of powers.  The Chicago and Philadelphia district courts also held that the \n28 \n1373 Condition was unlawful because 8 U.S.C. § 1373 is unconstitutional. \n27 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 29 of 52   Page ID #:207\n \ngovernment information relating to civil immigration practices in Los Angeles \n1 \n(collectively referred to as the “Challenged Conditions”). \n2 \n80.  For both grants, DOJ requires that applicants, “in order to validly accept” the \n3 \ngrant award, “must submit[] the specific certifications regarding compliance with certain \n4 \nfederal laws attached to” each solicitation.  2018 Solicitation at 1; OJJDP Solicitation at \n5 \n2.  Confirming the finality of its decision, DOJ has included the Challenged Conditions \n6 \nwhen disbursing FY 2018 Byrne JAG awards.  See FY 2018 Byrne JAG Award for the \n7 \nCity of Providence, attached as Exhibit B. Accordingly, DOJ will not provide federal \n8 \nfunds to applicants unless they certify to the Conditions. \n9 \n(1)  The “1373 and 1644” Condition \n10 \n81.  DOJ imposes in both the 2018 Byrne JAG and the Juvenile Gang Prevention \n11 \nGrant solicitations conditions on the receipt of an award that would require compliance \n12 \nwith an interpretation of various federal statutes which would violate the Tenth \n13 \nAmendment if construed to impose such a requirement.  Not only does DOJ carry over \n14 \nthe unconstitutional requirement for agencies to certify compliance with 8 U.S.C. § \n15 \n1373,12 but now also requires agencies to certify compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1644.13 \n16 \n82.  8 U.S.C. §§ 1373 and 1644 are not “applicable” laws within the meaning of \n17 \n34 U.S.C. § 10153(a)(5)(D), and thus cannot support a certification of compliance \n18 \nrequirement because they have no relevance to federal grants or the subject matter of the \n19 \neither the Byrne JAG or the Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant program.  Moreover, \n20 \nSection 1373 is not a valid federal law at all, as it violates the Tenth Amendment, as \n21 \n22 \n                                                 \n23 \n12  See Philadelphia, 309 F. Supp. 3d at 331 (holding Section 1373 unconstitutional under \n24 \nthe anticommandeering doctrine); Chicago, 2018 WL 3608564, at *13 (same); San \nFrancisco, No. 3:17-cv-04642, Dkt. 145 at 23-31 (same); see also California, 2018 WL \n25 \n3301414, at *14. \n26 \n13  Section 1644 is similar to Section 1373 in that it states no State or local government \n27  may be prohibited or restricted “from sending to or receiving from the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service information regarding the immigration status, lawful or unlawful, \n28 \nof an alien in the United States.”  8 U.S.C. § 1644. \n28 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 30 of 52   Page ID #:208\n \nrecognized by the Chicago and Philadelphia district courts.  Section 1644, as applied by \n1 \nDOJ here to impose a mandate on States and local governments, is likewise \n2 \nunconstitutional.  Accordingly, DOJ lacks authority to require Byrne JAG or Juvenile \n3 \nGang Prevention Grant applicants to certify compliance with either statute.  This Court’s \n4 \nintervention is required to invalidate these unconstitutional conditions.  \n5 \n(2)  The “Notice and Access” Conditions. \n6 \n83.  DOJ included in both the 2018 Byrne JAG and the Juvenile Gang Prevention \n7 \nGrant solicitations “Notice and Access” conditions that, in substance, are the same as \n8 \nthose that DOJ was enjoined from imposing by this Court and by federal courts in \n9 \nChicago and Philadelphia.14  Specifically, DOJ intends to condition the award of funding \n10 \nunder the Grants on a jurisdiction agreeing: \n11 \n12  •  “[n]ot to impede the exercise of the authority of the federal government \nunder 8 U.S.C. § 12[2]6(a) & (c)” (authorizing federal arrest and detention \n13 \nof certain aliens based on a federal warrant, and providing mandatory federal \n14 \ndetention of certain criminal aliens) and 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(4) (relating to \n15 \ncompletion of criminal terms of imprisonment prior to removal from the \n16 \nUnited States, and exceptions allowing for removal of federal, state, and \n17 \nlocal nonviolent offenders in some circumstances before completion of \n18 \nprison term).  The solicitations specify that recipients are required to do so \n19 \nby providing “(where feasible) at least 48 hours’ advance notice to DHS \n20 \nregarding the scheduled release date and time of an alien in the recipient’s \n21 \ncustody when DHS requests such notice in order to take custody of the alien \n22 \npursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act.” (“Notice Condition”)   \n23 \n24  •  “[n]ot to impede the exercise by DHS agents, ‘anywhere in or outside the \nUnited States’ (8 C.F.R. § 287.5(a)(1)), of their authority under 8 U.S.C. § \n25 \n26 \n                                                 \n27  14  City of Los Angeles v. Sessions, 293 F. Supp. 3d 1087 (C.D. Cal. 2018); City of Los \nAngeles v. Sessions, No. 17-cv-07215-R-JCx, Order Granting Plaintiff’s Application for \n28 \nPreliminary Injunction [Dkt. 93], (C.D. Cal. Sept. 13, 2018). \n29 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 31 of 52   Page ID #:209\n \n1357(a)(1) to ‘interrogate any alien or person believed to be an alien as to \n1 \nhis right to be or to remain in the United States.’”  The solicitations specify \n2 \nthat recipients are required to do so by permitting “DHS agents to have \n3 \naccess to any correctional facility in order to meet with an alien (or an \n4 \nindividual believed to be an alien) and inquire as to his right to be or remain \n5 \nin the United States.” (“Access Condition,” collectively “Notice and Access \n6 \nConditions”)15 \n7 \n84.  In the face of court orders enjoining DOJ based on a ruling that FY 2017 \n8 \nNotice and Access Conditions are unconstitutional, DOJ has shifted its tactics, apparently \n9 \nattempting to justify its imposition of these conditions on recipient States and local \n10 \ngovernments under the Byrne JAG statute’s “applicable Federal laws” provision.  See 34 \n11 \nU.S.C. § 10153(a)(5)(D) (applicants must comply with “all provisions of this part and all \n12 \nother applicable Federal laws”).  DOJ has not identified any analogous statutory \n13 \nprovision under the Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant.  Even in their new statutory garb, \n14 \nthe conditions remain unconstitutional.  The statutes on which DOJ now attempts to rely \n15 \nplainly do not impose any requirement on State and local governments, and construing \n16 \nthem to create a mandate on State and local governments to participate in federal civil \n17 \nimmigration enforcement and adjust their resources and practices accordingly would \n18 \nviolate the Tenth Amendment.  The statutes also have nothing to do with federal grants, \n19 \nlocal criminal justice, or juvenile delinquency reduction and prevention. \n20 \n85.  DOJ’s 2018 Byrne JAG solicitation also provides that “[t]he reasonable \n21 \ncosts . . . of complying with these conditions, including honoring any duly authorized \n22 \n23 \n                                                 \n24  15  See 2018 Solicitation at 36-37; See also https://ojp.gov/funding/Explore/pdf/\nFY18JAG_LOCAL_VARIOUS_Rev1003.pdf (Byrne JAG certification of compliance \n25 \nciting 8 U.S.C. §§ 1357(a), 1226(a), (c), and 1231(a)); \n26  https://ojp.gov/funding/Explore/pdf/FY18_GANGPLAN_VARIOUS_Rev1003.pdf \n(Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant certification of compliance, citing 8 U.S.C. §§ 1357(a), \n27 \n1226(a), (c), and 1231(a)); Ex. B  ¶¶ 45 (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)), 46 (citing 8 U.S.C. \n28  §§ 1226, 1231, and 1366).  See also OJJDP Solicitation at 39-40. \n30 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 32 of 52   Page ID #:210\n \nrequests from DHS that is encompassed by these conditions, will be allowable costs \n1 \nunder the award.”  2018 Solicitation at 37.  This provision would use the grant funds, \n2 \nwhich Congress expressly designated for support of local criminal justice to unlawfully \n3 \nfund State and local participation in federal civil immigration enforcement.   \n4 \n86.  This Court’s intervention is required to invalidate these unlawful conditions. \n5 \n(3)  The “Harboring” Condition \n6 \n87.  Trump Administration officials have threatened to arrest local officials in so-\n7 \ncalled “sanctuary” jurisdictions—i.e., jurisdictions the Trump Administration deems to be \n8 \nuncooperative in federal civil immigration enforcement because the jurisdictions \n9 \nprioritize their resources for use to protect the health and safety of their local residents \n10 \nand leave to the federal government the enforcement of federal civil immigration laws.  \n11 \nIn testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee at a hearing on “Homeland Security \n12 \nOversight,” Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen confirmed that, at DHS’s \n13 \nrequest, DOJ is exploring such prosecution of local elected officials under 8 U.S.C. § \n14 \n1324.  Then-Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Thomas \n15 \nHoman likewise stated that the Justice Department should “file charges against the \n16 \nsanctuary cities [referring to criminal prosecution of local officials and law enforcement \n17 \nunder 8 U.S.C. § 1324]” and “hold back their funding.”16  He stated that “we gotta start \n18 \ncharging some of these [sanctuary city] politicians with crimes.”17 \n19 \n88.  Following these threats, DOJ’s Solicitations now condition a jurisdiction’s \n20 \nstatutorily-authorized FY 2018 Byrne JAG and Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant award on \n21 \nthe jurisdiction agreeing:  “Not to violate, or aid or abet any violation of, 8 U.S.C. § \n22 \n1324(a) (forbidding any ‘person,’ in ‘knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that an \n23 \n24 \n                                                 \n16  Brandon Conradis, Trump ICE Pick: Politicians Who Run Sanctuary Cities Should Be \n25 \nCharged With Crimes, THE HILL, Jan. 2, 2018, \n26 \nhttp://thehill.com/homenews/administration/367167-trump-ice-pick-politicians-who-run-\n27  sanctuary-cities-should-be-charged (quoting interview of then-acting ICE acting Director \nThomas Homan with Fox News). \n28  17  Id. \n31 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 33 of 52   Page ID #:211\n \nalien has come to, entered, or remains in the United States in violation of law,’ to \n1 \n‘conceal, harbor, or shield from detection, or attempt to conceal, harbor, or shield from \n2 \ndetection, such alien in any place, including any building or any means of transportation’ \n3 \nor to ‘engage in any conspiracy to commit any of the preceding acts’…’or aid or abet the \n4 \ncommission of any of the preceding acts’).”  As with the Notice and Access Conditions, \n5 \nthe FY 2018 Byrne JAG solicitation provides that “[t]he reasonable costs . . . of \n6 \ncomplying with” the Harboring Condition is an “allowable cost[] under the award.”  \n7 \n89.  The certification with respect to the Harboring Condition requires that \n8 \njurisdictions “not . . . publicly disclose federal law enforcement information in an attempt \n9 \nto conceal, harbor, or shield certain individuals from detection, including in violation of 8 \n10 \nU.S.C. § 1324(a).”18    In addition, jurisdictions must certify that they will not “require or \n11 \nauthorize the public disclosure of federal law enforcement information in order to \n12 \nconceal, harbor, or shield from detection fugitives from justice or aliens illegally in the \n13 \nUnited States.”  Id. \n14 \n90.  It is not clear what state and local laws and policies DOJ intends to capture \n15 \nwith its Harboring Condition.   \n16 \n91.  DOJ’s imposition of the Harboring Condition is unlawful because 8 U.S.C. \n17 \n§ 1324 does not apply to States and local governments and could not be construed to do \n18 \nso without violating the Tenth Amendment.  The statute also has nothing to do with \n19 \nfederal grants, local criminal justice, or juvenile delinquency reduction and prevention.  \n20 \nThis Court’s intervention is required to invalidate this unlawful condition.  \n21 \n(4)  The “Questionnaire” Condition \n22 \n23 \n24 \n                                                 \n25 \n18 See https://ojp.gov/funding/Explore/pdf/FY18JAG_LOCAL_VARIOUS_Rev1003.pdf \n26  (Byrne JAG certification of compliance, citing 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)); \nhttps://ojp.gov/funding/Explore/pdf/FY18_GANGPLAN_VARIOUS_Rev1003.pdf \n27 \n(Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant certification of compliance, citing 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)); \n28  see also Ex. B ¶ 44 (citing 8 U.S.C. 1324 and 18 U.S.C. §§ 1071 and 1072). \n32 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 34 of 52   Page ID #:212\n \n92.  DOJ attempts to tether 2018 Byrne JAG and the Juvenile Gang Prevention \n1 \nGrants awards to federal civil immigration enforcement through mandating that States \n2 \nand local governments respond to certain civil immigration-related questions.  Those \n3 \nquestions are: \n4 \n5  •  (1)  “Does your jurisdiction have any laws, policies, or practices related to \nwhether, when, or how employees may communicate with DHS or ICE?” \n6 \n7  •  (2)  “Is your jurisdiction subject to any laws from a superior political \nentity (e.g., a state law that binds a city) that meet the description in question \n8 \n1?”  2018 Solicitation at 52; OJJDP Solicitation at 30; Ex. B ¶ 62. \n9 \n93.  If the answer to either question is yes, the State or local government must \n10 \nprovide a copy of each law or policy; describe each practice; and explain how the law, \n11 \npolicy, or practice complies with Section 1373.  Because the City of Los Angeles passes \n12 \nthrough a portion of its Byrne JAG grant monies to other localities, the condition also \n13 \nrequires the City to collect this information from local governments that are its \n14 \nsubgrantees.  The same would be true for the Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant.  If any \n15 \nsubgrantee of money received by the City under the Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant is a \n16 \ngovernmental agency, the City would be required to collect the requisite information \n17 \nfrom the subgrantee.   \n18 \n94.  For the 2018 Byrne JAG award, DOJ states that responses to the questions \n19 \n“must be provided by the applicant as part of the JAG application” and that an agency \n20 \n“will not be able to access award funds (and its award will include a condition that \n21 \nwithholds funds) until it submits these responses.”  2018 Solicitation at 28 (emphasis \n22 \nadded). \n23 \n95.  The Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant solicitation states that the questionnaire \n24 \n“should” be submitted as an attachment to an agency’s applications and also says that \n25 \nreviewers will, “as appropriate,” consider attachments, of which the questionnaire is one, \n26 \nwhen rating applications.  OJJDP Solicitation at 30. \n27 \n28 \n33 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 35 of 52   Page ID #:213\n \n96.  The information sought by DOJ is not relevant to either of the two Grants \n1 \nand, in any event, has already been provided by the City to DOJ on multiple occasions in \n2 \ndifferent contexts (although not as a prerequisite to receiving grant funding).  The \n3 \napparent purpose of the questionnaire is to help DOJ enforce its other unlawful \n4 \nimmigration-related conditions. \n5 \n97.  This Court’s intervention is required to invalidate this unlawful condition. \n6 \n7  (5) The 1366 Condition \n98.  DOJ also conditions Byrne JAG and Juvenile Gang Prevention grants on a \n8 \njurisdiction’s certification of compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1366(1) and (3).  See Ex. B ¶ \n9 \n46. \n10 \n99.  8 U.S.C. § 1366(1) and (3) require the Attorney General to submit various \n11 \nreports to Congress.  Section 1366 states that “the Attorney General shall submit to the \n12 \nCommittees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and of the Senate a report \n13 \ndetailing--(1) the number of illegal aliens incarcerated in Federal and State prisons for \n14 \nhaving committed felonies, stating the number incarcerated for each type of offense . . . \n15 \n[and] (3) programs and plans underway in the Department of Justice to ensure the prompt \n16 \nremoval from the United States of criminal aliens subject to removal . . . .”  Those \n17 \nprovisions do not concern federal grants, local criminal justice, or juvenile delinquency \n18 \nreduction and prevention.  They are also not directed to States and local governments. \n19 \n100.  This Court’s intervention is required to invalidate this unlawful condition. \n20 \n21  COUNT ONE \n(2018 Byrne JAG:  Violation of Separation of Powers / Ultra Vires Agency Action) \n22 \n \n23  101.  Los Angeles incorporates and re-alleges each and every allegation contained \n24  above as if fully set forth herein. \n25  102.  Defendants’ imposition of immigration-related conditions, questionnaires, \n26  and certifications on Byrne JAG grant applicants violates constitutional principles of \n27  separation of powers and exceeds DOJ’s lawful authority. \n28  103.  The Constitution confers the power of the Spending Clause on Congress, not \n34 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 36 of 52   Page ID #:214\n \nthe Executive Branch.  See U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1.  It is Congress, not an Executive \n1 \nBranch agency, that has the constitutional authority to impose conditions on the receipt of \n2 \nfederal funds, and even that power is subject to limitations such as relatedness and clarity.  \n3 \nDefendants here are attempting to wield authority that is vested in Congress, not in DOJ. \n4 \n104.  Congress specifically directed that Byrne JAG funds be issued as grants “for \n5 \nuse by the State or unit of local government” in order to provide seven types of support \n6 \nfor local criminal justice efforts—“additional personnel, equipment, supplies, contractual \n7 \nsupport, training, technical assistance, and information systems for criminal justice.”  34 \n8 \nU.S.C. § 10152(a)(1).  Congress further enumerated eight types of criminal justice \n9 \nprograms appropriate for funding, such as “[l]aw enforcement programs,” “[p]rosecution \n10 \nand court programs,” and “[p]revention and education programs.”   \n11 \nId. § 10152(a)(1)(A)-(H).  Enforcing federal civil immigration laws is not among the \n12 \nenumerated programs. \n13 \n105.  The programs to which Congress directed Byrne JAG funding do not require \n14 \ninducing State and local support for federal investigations of civil immigration status.  \n15 \nYet, the FY 2018 Byrne JAG application authorizes funding for civil immigration-related \n16 \nprograms, and requires all jurisdictions to promise to assist in civil immigration \n17 \nenforcement as a condition of receiving funding.  Accordingly, DOJ has expressly and \n18 \nunlawfully shifted money that Congress appropriated to advance local criminal justice \n19 \nprograms away from that clear statutory purpose to fund, instead, federal civil \n20 \nimmigration enforcement, in violation of the statute.   \n21 \n106.  Congress specifically recognized when it created the Byrne JAG Program \n22 \nthat State and local governments maintain the sovereign police power to protect the \n23 \npublic health and safety of their residents by providing police departments with the \n24 \n“flexibility to spend money for programs that work for them rather than to impose a ‘one \n25 \nsize fits all’ solution.”  H.R. Rep. No. 109-233, at 89 (2005).  The record shows Congress \n26 \nintended to “lessen the administrative burden of applying for the grants.”  Id.  DOJ’s \n27 \nblatant attempt to syphon monies from locally-driven Byrne JAG funded criminal justice \n28 \n35 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 37 of 52   Page ID #:215\n \nprograms, like the City’s CLEAR program, into a complex, “one size fits all” effort to \n1 \nsupport federal civil immigration enforcement, clearly runs afoul of this congressional \n2 \nenactment and purpose. \n3 \n107.  The Challenged Conditions are grossly inconsistent with the funding \n4 \nformula for Byrne JAG grants established in 34 U.S.C. § 10156.  BJA is required, by \n5 \ncongressional mandate, to allocate Byrne JAG funds based on a prescribed formula that \n6 \ntakes into account a State’s population, and the violent crime rates in a given State or \n7 \nlocality.  34 U.S.C. § 10156(a), (d).  Congress enumerated specific certifications and \n8 \nassurances the applicant must make to access these funds.  Again, Congress did not \n9 \ninclude a condition mandating local law enforcement involvement in federal civil \n10 \nimmigration enforcement. \n11 \n108.  The Challenged Conditions also violate an express rule of construction \n12 \nimposed by Congress.  Congress directed that the statute creating the Byrne JAG \n13 \nProgram not be construed to authorize DOJ to exercise “any direction, supervision, or \n14 \ncontrol over any police force or any other criminal justice agency of any State or any \n15 \npolitical subdivision thereof.”  34 U.S.C. § 10228(a).  The Challenged Conditions do just \n16 \nthat, asserting DOJ’s federal control over Los Angeles and its police department in the \n17 \noperation of the City’s detention facilities. \n18 \n109.  Imposition of the Challenged Conditions also exceeds DOJ’s authority under \n19 \nthe statutory requirement that the applicant certify it “will comply with all provisions of \n20 \nthis part and all other applicable Federal laws.”  34 U.S.C. § 10153(a)(5)(D). \n21 \n110.  The 1373 Condition:  8 U.S.C. § 1373 is not an “applicable” law within the \n22 \nmeaning of Section 10153(a)(5)(D) because it has no relevance to federal grants or the \n23 \nlocal criminal justice subject matter of the Byrne JAG Program.  It is also not a valid \n24 \nfederal law, because it violates the Tenth Amendment.  Accordingly, DOJ lacks authority \n25 \nto require Byrne JAG applicants to certify compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373. \n26 \n111.  The 1644 Condition:  8 U.S.C. § 1644 is not an “applicable” law within the \n27 \nmeaning of Section 10153(a)(5)(D), because it has no relevance to federal grants or the \n28 \n36 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 38 of 52   Page ID #:216\n \nlocal criminal justice subject matter of the Byrne JAG Program.  Moreover, any \n1 \napplication of Section 1644 to impose a mandate on States and local governments would \n2 \nviolate the Tenth Amendment.  Accordingly, DOJ lacks authority to require Byrne JAG \n3 \napplicants to certify compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1644. \n4 \n112.  The Notice and Access Conditions:  DOJ cannot justify imposing the \n5 \nNotice and Access Conditions for the 2018 grant process by requiring applicants to \n6 \ncertify that they do not “impede” federal officials’ performance of their duties under 8 \n7 \nU.S.C. §§ 1226(a), (c), 1231(a), and 1357(a)(1).  These provisions do not purport to \n8 \nimpose any obligations on States and local governments, and so cannot be “applicable” \n9 \nFederal laws within the meaning of Section 10153(a)(5)(D) for which an applicant could \n10 \nbe required to certify that it complies.  If these statutes were construed to impose \n11 \nrequirements on States and local governments, any such application would violate the \n12 \nTenth Amendment.  And even if these laws could constitutionally impose obligations on \n13 \nStates and local governments, and did in fact do so, they do not concern federal grants or \n14 \nthe local criminal justice subject matter of the Byrne JAG Program.  For all of these \n15 \nreasons, DOJ lacks authority to require Byrne JAG applicants to certify compliance with \n16 \n8 U.S.C. § 1226(a), (c), 1231(a), and 1357(a)(1). \n17 \n113.  The Harboring Condition:  8 U.S.C. § 1324(a) does not apply to States and \n18 \nlocal governments.  If this statute were construed to impose requirements on States and \n19 \nlocal governments, any such application would violate the Tenth Amendment.  And even \n20 \nif this law could constitutionally impose obligations on States and local governments, and \n21 \ndid in fact do so, it does not concern federal grants or the local criminal justice subject \n22 \nmatter of the Byrne JAG Program.  For all of these reasons, DOJ lacks authority to \n23 \nrequire Byrne JAG applicants “not to publicly disclose federal law enforcement \n24 \ninformation in an attempt to conceal, harbor, or shield certain individuals from detection, \n25 \nincluding in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)” or to certify that they will not “require or \n26 \nauthorize the public disclosure of federal law enforcement information in order to \n27 \n28 \n37 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 39 of 52   Page ID #:217\n \nconceal, harbor, or shield from detection fugitives from justice or aliens illegally in the \n1 \nUnited States.” \n2 \n114.  The Questionnaire Condition:  DOJ has not identified any federal law \n3 \nrequiring States and local governments to complete its questionnaire concerning \n4 \nparticipation in federal civil immigration enforcement.  Accordingly, the requirement of \n5 \ncertifying compliance with applicable Federal laws cannot justify imposition of the \n6 \nQuestionnaire Condition. \n7 \n115.  The 1366 Condition: 8 U.S.C. § 1366(1) and (3) require the Attorney \n8 \nGeneral to submit various reports to Congress.  Those provisions do not concern federal \n9 \ngrants or the local criminal justice subject matter of the Byrne JAG Program.  They are \n10 \nalso not directed to States and local governments. \n11 \n116.  In sum, DOJ is attempting to exercise a power it does not have.  Defendants’ \n12 \nattempt to condition federal funding of local criminal justice programs in cities like Los \n13 \nAngeles on the willingness of the award grantee to engage in federal civil immigration \n14 \nenforcement violates the separation of powers enshrined in our Constitution and is ultra \n15 \nvires in violation of the Byrne JAG statute. \n16 \n17  COUNT TWO \n(2018 Byrne JAG:  Violation of the Spending Clause) \n18 \n \n19  117.  Los Angeles incorporates and re-alleges each and every allegation contained \n20  above as if fully set forth herein. \n21  118.  Even if Congress could delegate the constitutional spending power to DOJ to \n22  impose the Challenged Conditions (which it cannot), and even if it had done so (which it \n23  has not), such power would be subject to constitutional restrictions that are not met here.  \n24  It is well established that the Spending Clause requires that conditions on providing \n25  federal funds to States and local governments must, inter alia, be unambiguous, and be \n26  sufficiently germane to the purpose of the federal funds.  Otherwise, the “condition” \n27  amounts to impermissible regulation and commandeering of States and local \n28 \n38 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 40 of 52   Page ID #:218\n \ngovernments, in violation of the Tenth Amendment.  The Challenged Conditions fail both \n1 \nof these requirements. \n2 \n119.  Conditions placed on the use by States and localities of federal funds must \n3 \nbe stated unambiguously.  “The legitimacy of Congress’ power to legislate under the \n4 \nspending power thus rests on whether the State voluntarily and knowingly accepts” the \n5 \nconditions, and there can be “no knowing acceptance if a State [or city] . . . is unable to \n6 \nascertain what is expected of it.”  Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. \n7 \n1, 17 (1981).  It is Congress, not an agency, that must speak clearly in defining the type \n8 \nof conditions at issue.  But even if DOJ could satisfy this requirement by speaking with \n9 \nthe requisite clarity, it has not done so here.  For example, it is not clear what state and \n10 \nlocal laws and policies that DOJ intends to address with the Harboring Condition.  Nor \n11 \nhas DOJ clearly and unambiguously stated whether the version of the Notice Condition \n12 \nincluded in its FY 2018 solicitation would require States or localities to detain individuals \n13 \nbeyond their scheduled release date.  These ambiguities do not allow Los Angeles to \n14 \nascertain exactly what is expected of it. \n15 \n120.  Conditions imposed on recipients of federal funding must “bear some \n16 \nrelationship to the purpose of the federal spending.”  New York v. United States, 505 U.S. \n17 \n144, 167 (1992).  The Challenged Conditions concern federal civil immigration \n18 \nenforcement, which is not sufficiently related—or related at all—to the purpose of the \n19 \nByrne JAG Program created by Congress specifically to support State and local criminal \n20 \njustice efforts through certain types of support and programs. \n21 \n22  COUNT THREE \n(2018 Byrne JAG:  Violation of Tenth Amendment and Anticommandeering) \n23 \n \n24  121.  Los Angeles incorporates and re-alleges each and every allegation contained \n25  above as if fully set forth herein. \n26  122.  The Tenth Amendment prohibits the federal government from requiring \n27  States and municipalities “to govern according to Congress’ instructions,”  New York, \n28  505 U.S. at 162, or “commanding the States’ officers . . . to administer or enforce a \n39 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 41 of 52   Page ID #:219\n \nfederal regulatory program.”  Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 935 (1997).  The \n1 \nvarious federal statutes that DOJ attempts to use to justify the Challenged Conditions are \n2 \neither unconstitutional in violation of the Tenth Amendment on their face, as applied to \n3 \nState and local governments, or as DOJ interprets them to apply to State and local \n4 \ngovernments. \n5 \n123.  The 1373 Condition:  DOJ’s interpretation of 8 U.S.C. § 1373 to require \n6 \nState and local governments to participate in federal civil immigration enforcement \n7 \nviolates the Tenth Amendment making it unconstitutional on its face.  Section 1373 \n8 \npurports to “unequivocally dictate[ ] what a state legislature may and may not do” by \n9 \nprohibiting States and localities from restricting their employees from communicating \n10 \nwith the federal government about a person’s citizenship and immigration status.  See \n11 \nMurphy, 138 S. Ct. at 1478; Philadelphia, 309 F. Supp. 3d at 331; Chicago, 2018 WL \n12 \n3608564, at *10. \n13 \n124.  The 1644 Condition:  8 U.S.C. § 1644 does not impose mandates solely on \n14 \nState and local governments, but to the extent it imposes on States and local governments \n15 \nmandates similar to those imposed by 8 U.S.C. § 1373, it is unconstitutional as applied \n16 \nfor the same reasons. \n17 \n125.  The Notice and Access Conditions:  8 U.S.C. §§ 1226(a), (c), 1231(a), and \n18 \n1357(a)(1) do not purport to impose any obligations on States and local governments.  \n19 \nHowever, if DOJ were permitted to interpret those statutes to impose an obligation on \n20 \nStates and local governments to participate in federal civil immigration enforcement, \n21 \nthose statutes would be unconstitutional as applied. \n22 \n126.  The Harboring Condition:  8 U.S.C. § 1324 does not purport to impose \n23 \nany obligations on States and local governments.  However, if DOJ were permitted to \n24 \ninterpret that statute to apply to State and local officials, that statute would be \n25 \nunconstitutional as applied. \n26 \n127.  The 1366 Condition: 8 U.S.C. § 1366(1) and (3) do not impose any \n27 \nobligations on States and local governments.  However, if DOJ were permitted to \n28 \n40 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 42 of 52   Page ID #:220\n \ninterpret that statute to require participation in federal civil immigration enforcement \n1 \nfrom States and local governments, that statute would be unconstitutional as applied. \n2 \n128.  Because these federal statutes are unconstitutional violations of the Tenth \n3 \nAmendment, or would be unconstitutional to the extent they were construed and applied \n4 \nas DOJ suggests, i.e., to impose obligations on State and local governments to participate \n5 \nin federal civil immigration enforcement, DOJ cannot require jurisdictions to comply \n6 \nwith its interpretation of these laws as a condition of receiving any Byrne JAG funds or \n7 \nany other federal funding.   \n8 \n9  COUNT FOUR \n(2018 Byrne JAG:  Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act - Arbitrary and \n10 \nCapricious Agency Action) \n11 \n129.  Los Angeles incorporates and re-alleges each and every allegation contained \n12 \nabove as if fully set forth herein. \n13 \n130.  Agency actions are unlawful and must be set aside if they are “arbitrary, \n14 \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. \n15 \n§ 706(2)(A). \n16 \n131.  DOJ’s decision to impose civil immigration-related conditions and \n17 \ncertifications in the FY 2018 Byrne JAG grant solicitation is arbitrary and capricious \n18 \nbecause DOJ imposed those conditions and certifications without any reasoned basis, \n19 \nprovided no support for its linkage between participation by State and local law \n20 \nenforcement officials in federal civil immigration enforcement and the local criminal \n21 \njustice efforts that are the authorized purpose of the Byrne JAG grant, and appears to have \n22 \nrelied on clearly erroneous and debunked interpretations of existing studies. \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n41 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 43 of 52   Page ID #:221\n \n1  COUNT FIVE \n(Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant:  Violation of Separation of Powers / \n2 \nUltra Vires Agency Action) \n3 \n132.

Defendants’ imposition of immigration-related conditions, questionnaires, \n6 \nand certifications on the 2018 Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant applicants violates \n7 \nconstitutional principles of separation of powers and exceeds DOJ’s lawful authority. \n8 \n134.  The Constitution confers the power of the Spending Clause on Congress, not \n9 \nthe Executive Branch.  See U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1.  It is Congress, not an Executive \n10 \nBranch agency, that has the constitutional authority to impose conditions on the receipt of \n11 \nfederal funds, and even that power is subject to limitations such as relatedness and clarity.  \n12 \nDefendants here are attempting to wield authority that is vested in Congress, not in DOJ.  \n13 \n135.  The Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant is authorized under Part E of \n14 \nSubchapter II of the Juvenile Justice Act.  In passing that part of the Juvenile Justice Act, \n15 \nCongress granted authority to OJJDP to make grants to units of local government “to \n16 \ncarry out projects for the development, testing, and demonstration of promising initiatives \n17 \nand programs for the prevention, control, or reduction of juvenile delinquency.”  34 \n18 \nU.S.C. § 11171(a).  Congress specified three specific purposes for OJJDP grants: to \n19 \n“support State and local programs that prevent juvenile involvement in delinquent \n20 \nbehavior,” 34 U.S.C. § 11102(1);  “assist State and local governments in promoting \n21 \npublic safety by encouraging accountability for acts of juvenile delinquency,” id. § \n22 \n11102(2); and “assist State and local governments in addressing juvenile crime through \n23 \nthe provision of technical assistance, research, training, evaluation, and the dissemination \n24 \nof information on effective programs for combating juvenile delinquency.” Id. § \n25 \n11102(3).  Congress did not include the term “immigration,” nor any variation of that \n26 \nterm in the enabling legislation for the Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant, and enforcing \n27 \n28 \n42 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 44 of 52   Page ID #:222\n \nfederal civil immigration laws is not stated or intimated as one of the purposes of the \n1 \nJuvenile Gang Prevention Grant. \n2 \n3  136.  In the 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act, Pub. L. No. 115-141, Mar. 23, \n2018, 132 Stat. 348, 423, Congress provided “$27,500,000 for delinquency prevention, as \n4 \nauthorized by section 505 of the [Juvenile Justice] Act, of which, pursuant to sections 261 \n5 \nand 262 [34 U.S.C. §§ 11171 and 11172] thereof . . . (B) $4,000,000 shall be for gang \n6 \nand youth violence education, prevention and intervention, and related activities.” \n7 \n(emphasis added). \n8 \n137.  The programs for which Congress authorized funding under the Juvenile \n9 \nJustice Act, including the Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant, do not include inducing State \n10 \nand local support for federal investigations of civil immigration status.  Yet, DOJ seeks to \n11 \nrequire all applicants for the FY 2018 Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant to promise to \n12 \nassist in civil immigration enforcement as a condition of receiving funding.  Accordingly, \n13 \nDOJ has expressly and unlawfully conditioned money that Congress appropriated to \n14 \nadvance local juvenile delinquency prevention efforts on federal civil immigration \n15 \nenforcement, without statutory authorization to do so. \n16 \n138.  In authorizing OJJDP grants to State and local governments, Congress \n17 \nspecifically recognized that juvenile delinquency problems should be addressed through \n18 \nprevention programs that “work with juveniles, their families, local public agencies, and \n19 \ncommunity based organizations[.]” Id. § 11101(a)(10)(A)(i).  Congress reinforced the \n20 \nimportance of collaboration between local public agencies and the community when it \n21 \nexplicitly found that “[c]oordinated juvenile justice and delinquency prevention projects \n22 \nthat meet the needs of juveniles through the collaboration of the many local service \n23 \nsystems juveniles encounter can help prevent juveniles from becoming delinquent and \n24 \nhelp delinquent youth return to a productive life.”  Id. § 11101(a)(11) (emphasis added).  \n25 \nDOJ’s attempt to condition monies for programs that assist locally-driven juvenile \n26 \ndelinquency prevention efforts, such as the Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant program, on \n27 \n28 \n43 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 45 of 52   Page ID #:223\n \nstate and local participation in federal civil immigration enforcement, is contrary to the \n1 \ntext and purpose of the statute. \n2 \n139.  The Challenged Conditions are also inconsistent with Congress’s direction \n3 \nthat “[t]he Administrator shall ensure that, to the extent reasonable and practicable, such \n4 \ngrants are made to achieve an equitable distribution of such projects throughout the \n5 \nUnited States.” 34 U.S.C. § 11171(a).  Congress granted limited discretion to DOJ to \n6 \nimpose conditions unrelated to the purpose of the grant.  By allocating grant funds only to \n7 \nthose jurisdictions willing to accede to the Challenged Conditions, DOJ is acting contrary \n8 \nto the authority given to it under the statute. \n9 \n140.  The 1373 Condition:  The Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant statute does not \n10 \nauthorize the imposition of immigration-related conditions.  8 U.S.C. § 1373 has no \n11 \nrelevance to federal grants or the local criminal justice subject matter of the Juvenile \n12 \nGang Prevention Grant.  It is also not a valid federal law, because it violates the Tenth \n13 \nAmendment.  Accordingly, DOJ lacks authority to require Juvenile Gang Prevention \n14 \nGrant applicants to certify compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373. \n15 \n141.  The 1644 Condition:  The Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant statute does not \n16 \nauthorize the imposition of immigration-related conditions.  8 U.S.C. § 1644 has no \n17 \nrelevance to federal grants or the locally driven juvenile delinquency prevention effort \n18 \nwhich is the subject matter of the Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant.  Moreover, any \n19 \napplication of Section 1644 to impose a mandate on States and local governments would \n20 \nviolate the Tenth Amendment. Accordingly, DOJ lacks authority to require the Juvenile \n21 \nGang Prevention Grant Program applicant to certify compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1644. \n22 \n142.  The Notice and Access Conditions:  The Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant \n23 \nstatute does not authorize the imposition of immigration-related conditions.  DOJ cannot \n24 \njustify imposing the Notice and Access Conditions for the Juvenile Gang Prevention \n25 \nGrant process by requiring applicants to certify that they do not “impede” federal \n26 \nofficials’ performance of their duties under 8 U.S.C. §§ 1226(a), (c), 1231(a), and \n27 \n1357(a)(1).

If these statutes were construed to impose requirements on States and \n1 \nlocal governments, any such application would violate the Tenth Amendment.  And even \n2 \nif these laws could constitutionally impose obligations on States and local governments, \n3 \nand did in fact do so, they do not concern federal grants or the juvenile delinquency \n4 \nreduction and prevention subject matter of the Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant.  For all \n5 \nof these reasons, DOJ lacks authority to require Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant \n6 \napplicants to certify compliance with 8 U.S.C. §§ 1226(a), (c), 1231(a), and 1357(a)(1). \n7 \n143.  The Harboring Condition:  The Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant statute \n8 \ndoes not authorize the imposition of immigration-related conditions.  8 U.S.C. § 1324(a) \n9 \ndoes not apply to States and local governments.  If this statute were construed to impose \n10 \nrequirements on States and local governments, any such application would violate the \n11 \nTenth Amendment.  And even if this law could constitutionally impose obligations on \n12 \nStates and local governments, and did in fact do so, it does not concern federal grants or \n13 \nthe juvenile delinquency reduction and prevention subject matter of the Juvenile Gang \n14 \nPrevention Grant.  For all of these reasons, DOJ lacks authority to require Juvenile Gang \n15 \nPrevention Grant applicants “not to publicly disclose federal law enforcement \n16 \ninformation in an attempt to conceal, harbor, or shield certain individuals from detection, \n17 \nincluding in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)” or to certify that they will not “require or \n18 \nauthorize the public disclosure of federal law enforcement information in order to \n19 \nconceal, harbor, or shield from detection fugitives from justice or aliens illegally in the \n20 \nUnited States.” \n21 \n144.  The Questionnaire Condition:  The Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant statute \n22 \ndoes not authorize the imposition of immigration-related conditions.  DOJ has not \n23 \nidentified any federal law requiring States and local governments to complete its \n24 \nquestionnaire concerning participation in federal civil immigration enforcement.  \n25 \nAccordingly, the Questionnaire Condition is unlawful. \n26 \n145.  The 1366 Condition: The Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant statute does not \n27 \nauthorize the imposition of immigration-related conditions.  8 U.S.C. § 1366(1) and (3) \n28 \n45 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 47 of 52   Page ID #:225\n \nrequire the Attorney General to submit various reports to Congress.  Those provisions do \n1 \nnot concern federal grants, and are not directed to States and local governments. \n2 \n146.  In sum, DOJ is attempting to exercise a power it does not have.  Defendants’ \n3 \nattempt to condition federal funding of local juvenile delinquency prevention programs in \n4 \ncities like Los Angeles on the willingness of the award grantee to engage in federal civil \n5 \nimmigration enforcement violates the separation of powers enshrined in our Constitution \n6 \nand is ultra vires in violation of Congressional legislation authorizing the Juvenile Gang \n7 \nPrevention Grant. \n8 \n9  COUNT SIX \n(Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant:  Violation of the Spending Clause) \n10 \n \n11  147.  Los Angeles incorporates and re-alleges each and every allegation contained \n12  above as if fully set forth herein. \n13  148.  Even if Congress could delegate the constitutional spending power to DOJ to \n14  impose the Challenged Conditions (which it cannot), and even if it had done so (which it \n15  has not), such power would be subject to constitutional restrictions that are not met here.  \n16  It is well established that the Spending Clause requires that conditions on providing \n17  federal funds to States and local governments must, inter alia, be sufficiently germane to \n18  the purpose of the federal funds.  Otherwise, the “condition” amounts to impermissible \n19  regulation and commandeering of States and local governments, in violation of the Tenth \n20  Amendment.  The Challenged Conditions fail both of these requirements. \n21  149.  Conditions placed on the use by States and localities of federal funds must \n22  be stated unambiguously. “The legitimacy of Congress’ power to legislate under the \n23  spending power thus rests on whether the State voluntarily and knowingly accepts” the \n24  conditions, and there can be “no knowing acceptance if a State [or city] . . . is unable to \n25  ascertain what is expected of it.”  Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v.

For example, it is not clear what state and \n46 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 48 of 52   Page ID #:226\n \nlocal laws and policies that DOJ intends to address with the Harboring Condition.  Nor \n1 \nhas DOJ clearly and unambiguously stated whether the version of the Notice Condition \n2 \nincluded in its Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant solicitation would require States or \n3 \nlocalities to detain individuals beyond their scheduled release date.  These ambiguities do \n4 \n5  not allow Los Angeles to ascertain exactly what is expected of it. \n150.  Conditions imposed on recipients of federal funding must “bear some \n6 \nrelationship to the purpose of the federal spending.”  New York, 505 U.S. at 167.  The \n7 \nChallenged Conditions concern federal civil immigration enforcement, which is not \n8 \nsufficiently related—or related at all—to the purpose of the Juvenile Gang Prevention \n9 \nGrant Program created by Congress to assist State and local governments “to carry out \n10 \nprojects for the development, testing, and demonstration of promising initiatives and \n11 \nprograms for the prevention, control, or reduction of juvenile delinquency.”  34 U.S.C. \n12 \n§ 11171(a).   \n13 \n14  COUNT SEVEN \n(Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant:  Violation of Tenth Amendment and \n15 \nAnticommandeering) \n16 \n151.  Los Angeles incorporates and re-alleges each and every allegation contained \n17 \nabove as if fully set forth herein. \n18 \n152.  The Tenth Amendment prohibits the federal government from requiring \n19 \nStates and municipalities “to govern according to Congress’ instructions.”  New York, \n20 \n505 U.S. at 162, or “commanding the States’ officers . . . to administer or enforce a \n21 \nfederal regulatory program.”  Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 935 (1997).  The \n22 \nvarious federal statutes that DOJ attempts to use to justify the Challenged Conditions are \n23 \neither unconstitutional in violation of the Tenth Amendment on their face, as applied to \n24 \nState and local governments, or as DOJ interprets them to apply to State and local \n25 \ngovernments. \n26 \n153.  The 1373 Condition:  DOJ’s interpretation of 8 U.S.C. § 1373 to require \n27 \nState and local governments to participate in federal civil immigration enforcement \n28 \n47 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 49 of 52   Page ID #:227\n \nviolates the Tenth Amendment making it unconstitutional on its face.  Section 1373 \n1 \npurports to “unequivocally dictate[ ] what a state legislature may and may not do” by \n2 \nprohibiting States and localities from restricting their employees from communicating \n3 \nwith the federal government about a person’s citizenship and immigration status.  See \n4 \nMurphy, 138 S. Ct. at 1478; Philadelphia, 309 F. Supp. 3d at 331; Chicago, 2018 WL \n5 \n3608564, at *10. \n6 \n154.  The 1644 Condition:  8 U.S.C. § 1644 does not impose mandates solely on \n7 \nState and local governments, but to the extent it imposes on States and local governments \n8 \nmandates similar to those imposed by 8 U.S.C. § 1373, it is unconstitutional as applied \n9 \nfor the same reasons. \n10 \n155.  The Notice and Access Conditions:  8 U.S.C. §§ 1226(a), (c), 1231(a), and \n11 \n1357(a)(1) do not purport to impose any obligations on States and local governments.  \n12 \nHowever, if DOJ were permitted to interpret those statutes to impose an obligation on \n13 \nStates and local governments to participate in federal civil immigration enforcement, \n14 \nthose statutes would be unconstitutional as applied. \n15 \n156.  The Harboring Condition:  8 U.S.C. § 1324 does not purport to impose \n16 \nany obligations on States and local governments.  However, if DOJ were permitted to \n17 \ninterpret that statute to apply to State and local officials, that statute would be \n18 \nunconstitutional as applied. \n19 \n157.  The 1366 Condition:  8 U.S.C. § 1366(1) and (3) do not impose any \n20 \nobligations on States and local governments.  However, if DOJ were permitted to \n21 \ninterpret that statute to require participation in federal civil immigration enforcement \n22 \nfrom States and local governments, that statute would be unconstitutional as applied. \n23 \n158.  Because these federal statutes are unconstitutional violations of the Tenth \n24 \nAmendment, or would be unconstitutional to the extent they were construed and applied \n25 \nas DOJ suggests, i.e., to impose obligations on State and local governments to participate \n26 \nin federal civil immigration enforcement, DOJ cannot require jurisdictions to comply \n27 \nwith its interpretation of these laws as a condition of receiving any Juvenile Gang \n28 \n48 \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC   Document 40   Filed 10/05/18   Page 50 of 52   Page ID #:228\n \nPrevention Grant funds or any other federal funding.   \n1 \n2  COUNT EIGHT \n(Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant:  Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act - \n3 \nArbitrary and Capricious Agency Action) \n \n4 \n159.  Los Angeles incorporates and re-alleges each and every allegation contained \n5 \nabove as if fully set forth herein. \n6 \n160.  Agency actions are unlawful and must be set aside if they are “arbitrary, \n7 \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. \n8 \n§ 706(2)(A). \n9 \n161.  DOJ’s decision to impose civil immigration-related conditions and \n10 \ncertifications in the Juvenile Gang Prevention Grant solicitation is arbitrary and \n11 \ncapricious because DOJ imposed those conditions and certifications without any reasoned \n12 \nbasis, provided no support for its linkage between participation by State and local law \n13 \nenforcement officials in federal civil immigration enforcement and the local juvenile \n14 \ndelinquency prevention efforts that are the authorized purpose of the Juvenile Gang \n15 \nPrevention Grant, and appears to have relied on clearly erroneous and debunked \n16 \ninterpretations of existing studies. \n17 \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n18 \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff City of Los Angeles respectfully requests that this Court \n19 \nenter judgment in its favor, and grant the following relief: \n20 \n1.  Declare that the Challenged Conditions in the FY 2018 Byrne JAG \n21 \nsolicitation are unconstitutional or otherwise unlawful; \n22 \n2.  Set aside the Challenged Conditions on FY 2018 Byrne JAG funds, and \n23 \npermanently enjoin Defendants from using the Challenged Conditions or substantively \n24 \nsimilar conditions in awarding Byrne JAG funding and from withholding or delaying \n25 \nByrne JAG funding based on the Challenged Conditions; \n26 \n3.

Declare that 8 U.S.C. § 1373 is unconstitutional as applied to State and local \n6 \ngovernments; \n7 \n6.  Declare that 8 U.S.C. § 1644 is unconstitutional as applied to State and local \n8 \ngovernments; \n9 \n7.  Declare that 8 U.S.C. §§ 1226(a), (c), 1231(a), 1324, 1357(a)(1), and \n10 \n1366(1), (3) do not require State and local governments to participate in federal civil \n11 \nimmigration enforcement, and would be unconstitutional as applied to the extent that they \n12 \ndid; \n13 \n8.  Issue a writ of mandamus compelling Defendants to immediately disburse \n14 \nLos Angeles’s FY 2018 Byrne JAG award, without further delay.;  \n15 \n9.

(“City MSJ,” Doc. 82-1.)  On September \n3  20, 2019, Defendants filed a motion for partial summary judgment and opposition to the \n4  City MSJ.  (“Barr MSJ,” Doc. 88.)  The Motions have since been fully briefed. \n5  Having considered the parties’ briefs and supporting materials, the Court GRANTS \n6  IN PART the City’s MSJ and DENIES the Barr MSJ. \n7   \n8  I.  BACKGROUND \n9  A.  Relevant Procedural Background \n10  On September 29, 2017, City filed a Complaint in related-case number 2:17-cv-\n11  07215 challenging the Department of Justice’s (“DOJ’s”) “Notice” and “Access” \n12  conditions on the Fiscal Year 2017 Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grants \n13  (“Byrne JAG”) Program and funding consideration factors for the Community Oriented \n14  Policing Services (“COPS”) Hiring Program.  The Court1 granted City’s application for \n15  preliminary injunction, enjoining the Notice and Access Condition in Fiscal Year 2017 \n16  Byrne JAG funding.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed on October 31, 2019, finding that the \n17  conditions were ultra vires.  See City of Los Angeles v. Barr, 941 F.3d 931, 945 (9th Cir. \n18  2019) (“Because none of DOJ’s proffered bases for statutory authority gives the Attorney \n19  General or the Assistant AG the power to impose the notice and access conditions, the \n20  conditions are ultra vires.”) \n21    The Court had also granted summary judgment in favor of City on its claims \n22  concerning DOJ-awarded “bonus points” in relation to the COPS grant.  The Ninth Circuit \n23  reversed, finding that the immigration-related considerations at issue in the COPS grant \n24  did not violate the Spending Clause, did not exceed DOJ’s statutory authority, and did not \n25  violate the Administrative Procedures Act (“APA”).  See City of Los Angeles v. Barr, 929 \n26  F.3d 1163 (9th Cir. 2019). \n27 \n \n28 \n1 The Honorable Manuel L. Real, presiding. \n  2 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-JLS-JC   Document 105   Filed 06/17/20   Page 3 of 16   Page ID #:3143\n \n \n \n \n1  In this case, on February 15, 2019, the Court granted summary judgment in favor of \n2  City on its claims pertaining to the conditions on the 2018 Byrne JAG Grant and denied \n3  Defendants’ motion to dismiss, finding that City had standing to challenge the claims now \n4  before this Court.  (Doc. 62.)  The Court also entered a nationwide permanent injunction \n5  against certain grant requirements on a Fiscal Year 2018 grant, the Gang Suppression \n6  Planning Grants Program (“Gang Suppression Program”), which DOJ created under the \n7  Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (the “Juvenile Justice Act” or \n8  “Act”).  (Id.)  Defendants appealed.  Then, on May 10, 2019, the Court granted the parties’ \n9  joint motion for an indicative ruling, indicating that if the Ninth Circuit were to partially \n10  remand, the Court would vacate the portion of its order and injunction concerning the \n11  Gang Suppression Program.  (Doc. 74.)  After the Ninth Circuit granted a limited remand, \n12  the Court2 vacated the portions of its February 15, 2019 Order concerning the Gang \n13  Suppression Program.  (Doc. 79.) \n14  Counts 5-8, which concern the Gang Suppression Program, are the only Counts now \n15  before the Court. \n16   \n17  B.  Relevant Factual Background \n18  Congress enacted the Juvenile Justice Act to: (1) “support State, tribal, and local \n19  programs that prevent juvenile involvement in delinquent behavior”; (2) “assist State, \n20  tribal, and local governments in promoting public safety by encouraging accountability for \n21  acts of juvenile delinquency”; (3) “assist State, tribal, and local governments in addressing \n22  juvenile crime through the provision of technical assistance, research, training, evaluation, \n23  and the dissemination of current and relevant information on effective and evidence-based \n24  programs and practices for combating juvenile delinquency”; and (4) “support a continuum \n25  of evidence-based or promising programs . . . that are trauma informed, reflect the science \n26 \n \n27 \n2 The Honorable R. Gary Klausner, presiding.  The case was reassigned to the undersigned \n28 \njudge on December 31, 2019. \n  3 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-JLS-JC   Document 105   Filed 06/17/20   Page 4 of 16   Page ID #:3144\n \n \n \n \n1  of adolescent development, and are designed to meet the needs of at-risk youth and youth \n2  who come into contact with the justice system.”  34 U.S.C. § 11102. \n3  Section 11171(a), titled “Authority to make grants,” provides in relevant part: \n4 \nThe  Administrator  may  make  grants  .  .  .  to  carry  out  projects  for  the \ndevelopment, testing, and demonstration of promising initiatives and programs \n5 \nfor  the  prevention,  control,  or  reduction  of  juvenile  delinquency.    The \n6  Administrator shall ensure that, to the extent reasonable and practicable, such \ngrants are made to achieve an equitable geographical distribution of such \n7 \nprojects throughout the United States. \n8 \n34 U.S.C. 11171(a).  Similarly, Section 11172, titled “Grants for technical assistance,” \n9 \nprovides that the “Administrator may make grants to and contracts with public and private \n10 \nagencies, organizations, and individuals to provide technical assistance to States [and] \n11 \nunits of general local government . . . to carry out the projects for which grants are made \n12 \nunder section 11171.”  Id. § 11172.  As for eligibility, Section 1173 provides that “[t]o be \n13 \neligible to receive a grant . . . , a public or private agency, Indian tribal government, \n14 \norganization, institution, individual, or combination thereof shall submit an application to \n15 \nthe Administrator at such time, in such form, and containing such information as the \n16 \nAdministrator may reasonably require by rule.”  Id. § 11173. \n17 \nDOJ created the Gang Suppression Program in 2018 pursuant to §§ 11171–11172 \n18 \nand the DOJ’s Fiscal Year 2018 appropriation.  (Doc. 47-16 at AR01482.)  The solicitation \n19 \nfor the Gang Suppression Program (the “Solicitation”)3 sought proposals from jurisdictions \n20 \nwith “high levels of youth-perpetrated gun crime and gang violence” to undertake \n21 \n“strategic planning and capacity-building work through multidisciplinary and community \n22 \npartnerships.”  (Id. at AR01420–21.)  To accept an award, “state or local government \n23 \nentity” applicants would be required to submit “the specific certifications regarding \n24 \ncompliance with certain federal laws[] attached to” the Solicitation.  (Id. at AR01477.)  \n25 \nThose certifications include the following guarantees: \n26 \n \n27 \n3 The Solicitation forms part of the Administrative Record.  (See Doc. 47-16 at AR01476–\n28 \nAR01530.) \n  4 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-JLS-JC   Document 105   Filed 06/17/20   Page 5 of 16   Page ID #:3145\n \n \n \n \n1  1.  Access: “permit [Department of Homeland Security (‘DHS’)] agents to have \n2  access to any correctional facility in order to meet with [a noncitizen] (or an \n3  individual believed to be [a noncitizen]) and inquire as to his right to be or \n4  remain in the United States.”  (Id. at AR01515.) \n5  2.  Notice: “provide (where feasible) at least 48 hours’ advance notice to DHS \n6  regarding the scheduled release date and time of [a noncitizen] in the \n7  recipient’s custody when DHS requests such notice in order to take custody \n8  of the [noncitizen] pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act.”  (Id.) \n9  3.  8 U.S.C. §§ 1373 and 1644: certify compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373 and 8 \n10  U.S.C. § 1644, which prohibit restrictions on the maintenance or exchange \n11  with DHS (or other government entities) of information regarding the \n12  citizenship or immigration status of individuals, or which, put differently, \n13  “promote information sharing and other cooperation between state and local \n14  law enforcement and federal immigration authorities.”  (Doc. 47-16 at \n15  AR01451, AR01606.) \n16  4.  Harboring: a recipient shall not “publicly disclose federal law enforcement \n17  information in an attempt to conceal, harbor, or shield certain individuals \n18  from detection, including in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a).”  (Id. at \n19  AR01629.) \n20  5.  Questionnaire: applicants must complete a questionnaire regarding whether \n21  their jurisdiction has any laws, policies or practices impacting employees’ \n22  communications with federal immigration authorities.  (See id. at AR01505, \n23  AR01526.) \n24  6.  8 U.S.C. § 1366: certify that a recipient will not “impede” the Attorney \n25  General’s statutory obligation to provide reporting to Congress under 8 \n26  U.S.C. § 1366(1), (3) regarding noncitizens incarcerated in State and federal \n27  prisons and the removal of “criminal [noncitizens] subject to removal” from \n28  the United States.  (See id. at AR01527; 8 U.S.C. § 1366.) \n  5 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-JLS-JC   Document 105   Filed 06/17/20   Page 6 of 16   Page ID #:3146\n \n \n \n \n1  The Court collectively refers to these as the “Conditions” or “challenged Conditions.” \n2  With respect to the Access, Notice, § 1373, § 1644, § 1366, and Harboring \n3  Conditions, applicants are not required to certify compliance until after they have been \n4  selected for the award.  Conversely, applicants must complete the Questionnaire as part of \n5  their application.  City refused to certify compliance with the Conditions in its application \n6  but answered the Questionnaire.  At the time briefing on the Motions closed, DOJ had not \n7  decided which applicants will receive an award under the Program. \n8   \n9  II.  LEGAL STANDARD \n10  A court may grant summary judgment where “there is no genuine dispute as to any \n11  material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n12  56(a).  The court may grant summary judgment on all or part of a claim.  See id.  Facts are \n13  “material” only if a dispute about them could affect the outcome of the case under \n14  applicable substantive law.  See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 \n15  (1986).  A dispute about a material fact is “genuine” “if the evidence is such that a \n16  reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.”  Id. \n17  “[W]hen simultaneous cross-motions for summary judgment on the same claim are \n18  before the court, the court must consider the appropriate evidentiary material identified and \n19  submitted in support of both motions, and in opposition to both motions, before ruling on \n20  each of them.”  Fair Hous. Council of Riverside Cty., Inc. v. Riverside Two, 249 F.3d \n21  1132, 1134 (9th Cir. 2001).  \n22   \n23  III.  DISCUSSION \n24  City moves for partial summary judgment on Counts 5-8 and to permanently enjoin \n25  Defendants from imposing the challenged Conditions.  In support of its position, City \n26  argues that Defendants’ implementation of the Gang Suppression Program (1) is ultra vires \n27  agency action and violates separation of powers principles; (2) violates the Constitution’s \n28  Spending Clause; and (3) violates the APA.  Defendants move for partial summary \n  6 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-JLS-JC   Document 105   Filed 06/17/20   Page 7 of 16   Page ID #:3147\n \n \n \n \n1  judgment on the same Counts, arguing that the Gang Suppression Program comports with \n2  the Constitution and is not subject to APA review or, to the extent the Program is subject \n3  to APA review, that it does not violate the APA. \n4   \n5  A.  Ultra Vires Agency Action and Violation of Separation of Powers \n6  City contends that, as evinced by the Juvenile Justice Act’s purpose, grant authority, \n7  and grant eligibility provisions, the Act precludes the imposition of any immigration-\n8  related conditions.  Accordingly, City argues, the Conditions are ultra vires and violate \n9  separation of powers principles.  City premises this argument on its contention that, based \n10  on the relevant portion of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, “any authority to \n11  impose the Conditions on the Gang Suppression Grant must be based in the Juvenile \n12  Justice Act.”  (City MSJ at 12–13.)  Defendants advance a different reading of the \n13  Appropriations Act, arguing that “[t]he nature of the congressional authorization for th[e] \n14  [P]rogram . . . grants the [DOJ] wide latitude to develop the program, including the \n15  discretion to adopt the challenged requirements.”  (Barr MSJ at 12.) \n16  “[A]n agency literally has no power to act, let alone pre-empt the validly enacted \n17  legislation of a sovereign State, unless and until Congress confers power upon it.”  \n18  Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 357 (1986).  In other words, “[a]n \n19  agency may not confer power upon itself.  To permit an agency to expand its power in the \n20  face of a congressional limitation on its jurisdiction would be to [impermissibly] grant to \n21  the agency power to override Congress.”  Id.  Indeed, the Supreme Court “expect[s] \n22  Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast economic \n23  and political significance.” Util. Air Regulatory Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014) \n24  (internal quotation marks omitted).  When agencies “act beyond their jurisdiction, what \n25  they do is ultra vires.”  City of Arlington v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 297 (2013).  Finally, \n26  “[a]ppropriations shall be applied only to the objects for which the appropriations were \n27  made except as otherwise provided by law.”  31 U.S.C. § 1301(a); cf. United States v. \n28  McIntosh, 833 F.3d 1163, 1175 (9th Cir. 2016) (“The [Appropriations] Clause has a \n  7 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-JLS-JC   Document 105   Filed 06/17/20   Page 8 of 16   Page ID #:3148\n \n \n \n \n1  ‘fundamental and comprehensive purpose . . . to assure that public funds will be spent \n2  according to the letter of the difficult judgments reached by Congress as to the common \n3  good and not according to the individual favor of Government agents.’”) (quoting Office of \n4  Pers. Mgmt. v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414, 427–28 (1990)). \n5  “In reviewing the lawfulness of Defendants’ conduct, the Court thus begins . . . by \n6  determining whether the disputed action exceeds statutory authority.”  Sierra Club v. \n7  Trump, 379 F. Supp. 3d 883, 910 (N.D. Cal. 2019).  DOJ’s Fiscal Year 2018 appropriation \n8  includes funds for “grants, contracts, cooperative agreements, and other assistance \n9  authorized by the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (‘the 1974 \n10  Act’).”  Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, Pub. L. No. 115-141, 132 Stat. 348, 422.  \n11  More specifically, Congress allocated: \n12 \n(3) $27,500,000 for delinquency prevention, as authorized by section 505 of \nthe 1974 Act, of which, pursuant to sections 261 and 262 [(§§ 11171–11172)] \n13 \nthereof— \n14    . . . .  \n(B)  $4,000,000  shall  be  for  gang  and  youth  violence  education, \n15 \nprevention and intervention, and related activities; \n16  . . . . \n(E)  $8,000,000  shall  be  for  community-based  violence  prevention \n17 \ninitiatives, including for public health approaches to reducing shootings and \nviolence; . . . \n18 \n19 \nId. at 422–23. \n20 \nPointing to this language, Defendants contend that the challenged Conditions are \n21 \nauthorized by this Appropriations Act, which Defendants claim authorizes the Gang \n22 \nSuppression Program by way of a lump sum appropriation that purportedly vests wide \n23 \ndiscretion in DOJ’s administration of the Program irrespective of the Act’s eligibility \n24 \nrequirements or other limitations. \n25 \nEven though the Appropriations Act provides that the relevant congressional \n26 \nappropriation is “authorized by” the Juvenile Justice Act “pursuant to sections 261 and 262 \n27 \nthereof,” Defendants claim that the appropriation “is not tied to any substantive statutory \n28 \n  8 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-JLS-JC   Document 105   Filed 06/17/20   Page 9 of 16   Page ID #:3149\n \n \n \n \n1  program authorization” because “[a]lthough Congress provided that the funds were \n2  appropriated ‘pursuant to sections 261 and 262’ of the [Juvenile Justice Act], the \n3  appropriation was related to those provisions only in a general sense.”  (Barr MSJ at 13, 14 \n4  n.6.4)  But “the availability of a lump-sum appropriation may be restricted by provisions \n5  appearing in statutes other than appropriation acts, such as authorization acts.”  U.S. Gov’t \n6  Accountability Off., GAO-06-382SP, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law 6-10 (3d \n7  ed. 2004).  “For example, if an agency receives a line-item authorization and a lump-sum \n8  appropriation pursuant to the authorization, the line-item restrictions and earmarks in the \n9  authorization act will apply just as if they appeared in the appropriation act itself.”  Id. \n10  DOJ’s own Solicitation confirms that the Program “is authorized pursuant to [§§] \n11  11171-11172” of the Act, under which DOJ may make grants “to carry out projects for the \n12  development, testing, and demonstration of promising initiatives and programs for the \n13  prevention, control, or reduction of juvenile delinquency.”  34 U.S.C. § 11171(a).  And, \n14  crucially, in its “Rules of construction” section, the Act provides that “[n]othing in th[e] \n15  subchapter [containing §§ 11171–11172] . . . shall be construed . . . to prevent financial \n16  assistance from being awarded through grants under this subchapter to any otherwise \n17  eligible organization.”  Id. § 11188.  In Section 11173, the Act expressly sets forth criteria \n18  for grant eligibility: “submit an application to the Administrator at such time, in such form, \n19  and containing such information as the Administrator may reasonably require by rule.”  Id. \n20  § 11173.  Conspicuously absent from Section 11173 is an authorization for DOJ to restrict \n21  eligibility by conditioning grants on priorities embodied in other federal statutes. \n22  Indeed, the Court rejects Defendants’ reliance on the Immigration and Nationality \n23  Act (the “INA”) for “implied authority” to impose the Conditions based on congressional \n24  contemplation in the INA of “coordination between federal officials and state and local \n25 \n \n26 \n4 As City aptly points out, Defendants’ reliance on Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182 (1993) and Int’l \nUnion, United Auto., Aerospace & Agric. Implement Workers v. Donovan, 746 F.2d 855 (D.C. Cir. \n27 \n1984) is misplaced.  Both cases applied distinct APA reviewability standards and did not engage in \nultra vires review.  Cf. Sierra Club, 379 F. Supp. 3d at 910 (rejecting defendants’ conflation of APA \n28 \nand ultra vires review, explaining that “ultra vires review exists outside of the APA framework”). \n  9 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-JLS-JC   Document 105   Filed 06/17/20   Page 10 of 16   Page ID #:3150\n \n \n \n \n1  officials on immigration enforcement.”  (See Barr MSJ at 7.)  The INA is referenced \n2  nowhere in the Gang Suppression Program’s authorizing statute or appropriation, nor does \n3  the INA reference those statutes.  See Sierra Club, 379 F. Supp. 3d at 909 (“[A]ll uses of \n4  appropriated funds must be affirmatively approved by Congress, and the mere absence of a \n5  prohibition is not sufficient.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 \n6  U.S. 243, 274 (2006) (“. . . Congress is unlikely to alter a statute’s obvious scope and \n7  division of authority through muffled hints[.]”). \n8  Defendants’ argument that the Gang Suppression Program is not circumscribed by \n9  its authorizing statute is further belied by the fact that the appropriation’s language is \n10  nearly identical to the Byrne JAG Program’s appropriation:  Congress provided \n11  “$415,500,000 for the [Byrne JAG] program as authorized by subpart 1 of part E of title I \n12  of the [Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968]” and, with respect to \n13  programs like the Gang Suppression Program, “$27,500,000 for delinquency prevention, \n14  as authorized by section 505 of the [Juvenile Justice] Act, of which, pursuant to sections \n15  261 and 262 . . . $4,000,000 shall be for gang and youth violence education, prevention \n16  and intervention, and related activities.”  Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, 132 Stat. \n17  at 420, 423.  The Ninth Circuit’s recent holding that DOJ’s imposition of the notice and \n18  access conditions on the Byrne JAG Program awards—conditions substantively identical \n19  to the Notice and Access Conditions at issue here—was ultra vires compels the conclusion \n20  that the challenged Conditions are likewise improper.  See City of Los Angeles v. Barr, 941 \n21  F.3d at 944. \n22  Defendants’ invocation of 34 U.S.C. § 10102(a)(6) as authority for the Conditions \n23  is likewise foreclosed by the Ninth Circuit’s holding in City of Los Angeles v. Barr.  \n24  Pursuant to Section 10102(a)(6), the Assistant Attorney General shall “exercise such other \n25  powers and functions as may be vested in the Assistant Attorney General pursuant to this \n26  chapter or by delegation of the Attorney General, including placing special conditions on \n27  all grants, and determining priority purposes for formula grants.”  34 U.S.C. § 10102(a)(6) \n28  (emphasis added).  In City of Los Angeles v. Barr, the Ninth Circuit construed “special \n  10 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-JLS-JC   Document 105   Filed 06/17/20   Page 11 of 16   Page ID #:3151\n \n \n \n \n1  conditions” to mean “individualized requirements included in a specific grant”—i.e., \n2  “tailored requirements” the agency may “impose . . . when necessary,” on a grantee-by-\n3  grantee basis.  See 941 F.3d at 941 (emphasis added).  Accordingly, the Ninth Circuit held \n4  that the Byrne JAG’s notice and access conditions are not “special conditions” under \n5  10102(a)(6) “because they are not conditions triggered by specific characteristics not \n6  addressed by established conditions.”  Id. at 942.  That reasoning applies here with equal \n7  force, and Defendants offer neither distinction nor legal authority that would compel a \n8  different conclusion.  Like the Notice and Access Conditions both here and in City of Los \n9  Angeles v. Barr, the remaining challenged Conditions are uniformly imposed on all \n10  applicants.  Cf. City of Philadelphia v. Att’y Gen., 916 F.3d 276, 288 (3d Cir. 2019) \n11  (reasoning that Congress would not hide “such a broad power—the power to place any \n12  special conditions on all grants—in a statute outlining ministerial duties for an Assistant \n13  Attorney General”), reh’g denied (June 24, 2019). \n14  In line with their argument regarding Section 10102(a)(6), Defendants next argue \n15  that the Assistant Attorney General’s duty under 34 U.S.C. § 10102(a)(2) to “maintain \n16  liaison . .  with State governments in matters relating to criminal justice” authorizes \n17  Defendants’ imposition of the Harboring and Questionnaire Conditions.  According to \n18  Defendants, “[a]n agency statutorily charged with maintaining that ‘liaison’ is naturally \n19  empowered to secure information regarding” local law enforcement practices that conflict \n20  with federal objectives and is “entitled to insist on the protection of sensitive law \n21  enforcement information.”  (Barr MSJ at 16.)  This argument has been soundly rejected, \n22  for “[t]he structure of Section 10102 does not support the contention that ‘maintain liaison’ \n23  . . . provides more than a ministerial duty on the Attorney General to maintain \n24  communication with other Federal and State agencies,” nor does it evidence congressional \n25  intent “to grant the DOJ broad authority to impose the challenged conditions over states \n26  and local governments receiving funds.”  City & Cty. of S.F. v. Sessions, 372 F. Supp. 3d \n27  928, 944 (N.D. Cal. 2019) (citing City of Philadelphia, 916 F.3d at 288; then citing City of \n28  Chicago v. Sessions, 888 F.3d 272, 285 (7th Cir. 2018), reh’g en banc granted in part, \n  11 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-JLS-JC   Document 105   Filed 06/17/20   Page 12 of 16   Page ID #:3152\n \n \n \n \n1  opinion vacated in part on other grounds, No. 17-2991, 2018 WL 4268817 (7th Cir. June \n2  4, 2018), vacated, No. 17-2991, 2018 WL 4268814 (7th Cir. Aug. 10, 2018)). \n3  In sum, the Court finds that the Act supplies DOJ’s sole statutory grant-making \n4  authority with respect to the challenged Conditions and turns to whether the Conditions \n5  constitute permissible agency action under the Act. \n6  According to City, “DOJ is not using the Conditions as a filter for determining \n7  which applications are best suited to the grant’s purposes.”  (City MSJ at 14.)  Instead, five \n8  of the challenged Conditions flout the Act’s express eligibility criteria and rules of \n9  construction by compelling changes to existing state and local law enforcement—rather \n10  than merely collecting information about such enforcement—and declining to award \n11  congressionally appropriated funds to applicants that meet the Act’s eligibility criteria.  In \n12  their opening brief, Defendants offer neither argument nor authority to rebut City’s \n13  contention.  Instead, for the first time on reply, Defendants argue (in the alternative) that \n14  the challenged Conditions are permissible under the Act, for its statutorily enacted \n15  purposes include “support[ing] State, tribal, and local programs that prevent juvenile \n16  involvement in delinquent behavior” and “assist[ing] State, tribal, and local governments \n17  in promoting public safety by encouraging accountability for acts of juvenile delinquency.” \n18  34 U.S.C. § 11102(1)–(2).  According to Defendants, the challenged Conditions comport \n19  with these purposes “by targeting transnational gangs that frequently prey on juveniles” \n20  and “attacking one particular source of juvenile delinquency: deportable members of \n21  transnational gangs.”  (Barr Reply, Doc. 93 at 7.) \n22  But Defendants fail to meaningfully grapple with the central premise of City’s ultra \n23  vires argument, namely that the Conditions constitute eligibility requirements Congress \n24  chose not to include in the Act’s “Eligibility” provision and that the Act does not delegate \n25  broad authority to the Attorney General to impose extra-statutory grant conditions.  \n26  Defendants’ invocation of a federal priority “to attack the dangerous effects of \n27  transnational gangs that prey on juveniles” (Barr MSJ at 17)—however critical to the \n28  United States and manifest in other legislation—does nothing to undercut City’s premise, \n  12 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-JLS-JC   Document 105   Filed 06/17/20   Page 13 of 16   Page ID #:3153\n \n \n \n \n1  for Defendants fail to explain why these priorities translate to authorization under the \n2  Juvenile Justice Act for DOJ to craft extra-statutory conditions that preclude applicants \n3  otherwise eligible under the Act from receiving grants for which they are eligible. \n4  The fallacy of Defendants’ argument is even more pronounced in light of the Ninth \n5  Circuit’s ruling in City of Los Angeles v. Barr, 929 F.3d 1163, which the court expressly \n6  limited to consideration of factors that did not amount to “conditions of receiving a grant”: \n7 \nBefore turning to the merits of Los Angeles’s claims, we first note the limited \nnature of the dispute.  As noted above, in administering a federal grant program \n8 \nand scoring the applications it receives, DOJ gives additional points to an \n9  applicant that chooses to focus on the illegal immigration area (instead of other \nfocus areas) and gives additional points to an applicant who agrees to the \n10 \nCertification.    Choosing  the  illegal  immigration  area  and  submitting  the \n11  Certification are not conditions of receiving a grant, and numerous applicants \nreceived grants without doing so.  Likewise, numerous applicants who chose \n12 \nthe illegal immigration focus area or submitted the Certification did not receive \na grant.  The question before us, therefore, is whether DOJ’s scoring practice \n13 \nof giving these additional points is unconstitutional or exceeds DOJ’s authority \n14  in administering the grant program. \n15 \nId. at 1174 (emphasis added). \n16 \nThe statute at issue in the case delegated “broad authority” to DOJ to “fill gaps” by \n17 \ncrafting eligibility factors to disburse $98.5 million in grant funding among 1,119 \n18 \njurisdictions requesting almost $410 million.  See id. at 1172, 1177.  Here, on the other \n19 \nhand, the challenged Conditions are “conditions of receiving a grant”:  they are designed \n20 \nto deny funds to jurisdictions that fail to meet extra-statutory criteria relating to \n21 \nimmigration enforcement, as opposed to providing those jurisdictions “extra points” in a \n22 \ncompetitive application process.  While the Ninth Circuit made clear that the Attorney \n23 \nGeneral has discretion in the context of the COPS competitive grant process to assess \n24 \nseveral non-dispositive factors in determining grant eligibility, the Conditions here concern \n25 \na different authorizing statute with no broad delegation of gap-filling authority. \n26 \nFor these reasons, the Court concludes that Congress did not grant DOJ the power \n27 \nto impose the challenged Conditions; their imposition, therefore, is ultra vires.  Because \n28 \n  13 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-JLS-JC   Document 105   Filed 06/17/20   Page 14 of 16   Page ID #:3154\n \n \n \n \n1  the Court so concludes, it need not reach City’s alternative grounds for partial summary \n2  judgment. \n3   \n4  B.  Permanent Injunction \n5  To obtain a permanent injunction, a plaintiff must show “(1) that it has suffered an \n6  irreparable injury; (2) that . . . monetary damages[] are inadequate to compensate for that \n7  injury; (3) that, considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a \n8  remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest would not be disserved by a \n9  permanent injunction.”  Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms, 561 U.S. 139, 156–57 \n10  (2010).  Defendants do not challenge the applicability of these factors, or the propriety of a \n11  permanent injunction given the Court’s conclusion in this Order.  Rather, Defendants argue \n12  that the injunction should be limited to City. \n13  The “Supreme Court has cautioned that ‘injunctive relief should be no more \n14  burdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs’ \n15  before the court.”  Los Angeles Haven Hospice, Inc. v. Sebelius, 638 F.3d 644, 664 (9th \n16  Cir. 2011) (quoting Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702 (1979)).  Moreover, where \n17  “the record is insufficiently developed as to the question of the national scope of the \n18  injunction,” injunctions are properly limited to the jurisdiction for which the record is \n19  adequately developed.  See City & Cty. of S.F. v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1244–45 (9th Cir. \n20  2018).  City’s vague warning of an assault on the sovereignty of “[a]ll potential \n21  jurisdictions” (City Reply, Doc. 89 at 26) does not persuade the Court that an injunction \n22  limited to City would not remedy its specific harms or provide it complete relief, nor does \n23  City provide the Court with enough data to assess the propriety or ramifications of its \n24  requested nationwide injunction.  The Court, in its discretion to “order[] an appropriate \n25  equitable remedy,” therefore finds that a nationwide injunction is neither warranted nor \n26  appropriate based on the present record.  See City & Cty. of S.F. v. Trump, 897 F.3d at \n27  1245; see also Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 32 (2008) (“An \n28 \n  14 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-JLS-JC   Document 105   Filed 06/17/20   Page 15 of 16   Page ID #:3155\n \n \n \n \n1  injunction is a matter of equitable discretion . . .”).  Because the Court so finds, it applies \n2  the four-factor test to a permanent injunction limited to City. \n3  First, City will suffer irreparable harm if compelled to alter its longstanding \n4  policing policies lest it jeopardize its ability to compete for future funding.  See Int’l \n5  Franchise Ass’n, Inc. v. City of Seattle, 803 F.3d 389, 411 (9th Cir. 2015) (“A rule putting \n6  plaintiffs at a competitive disadvantage constitutes irreparable harm.”).  Second, money \n7  damages cannot ensure City’s ability to compete on a level playing field in future grant \n8  cycles.  Third, while City would suffer greatly from an inability to compete fairly for \n9  federal resources, a permanent injunction “would [] cause the DOJ—at most—[only] a \n10  minor hardship: paying funds that Congress had appropriated for disbursement consistent \n11  with the purposes of the [Gang Suppression] Program.”  City of Philadelphia v. Sessions, \n12  280 F. Supp. 3d 579, 658 (E.D. Pa. 2017).  Finally, like the Court in City of Philadelphia v. \n13  Sessions, this Court, too, “finds that the public interest is better served if the City is not \n14  forced to choose between foregoing the [] Grant funds and losing hard-fought goodwill \n15  amongst the immigrant community.”  Id.  In sum, City has carried its burden under the test \n16  and a permanent injunction limited to City is therefore appropriate.5 \n17  /// \n18  /// \n19  /// \n20  /// \n21  /// \n22  /// \n23  /// \n24  /// \n25   \n26   \n27  5 Because the permanent injunction the Court enters extends only to redress City’s injuries, \nDefendants’ argument that City lacks standing to seek an injunction pertaining to non-parties is \n28 \nmoot. \n  15 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-JLS-JC   Document 105   Filed 06/17/20   Page 16 of 16   Page ID #:3156\n \n \n \n \n1  IV.  CONCLUSION \n2  For the foregoing reasons, the City MSJ is GRANTED IN PART and the Barr \n3  MSJ is DENIED.  Defendants and their officers, agents, servants and employees are \n4  permanently RESTRAINED AND ENJOINED from conditioning, withholding, or \n5  delaying Gang Suppression Planning Grants Program awards with respect to City based on \n6  the six immigration-related conditions imposed on applicants of the Fiscal Year 2018 Gang \n7  Suppression Program.

BACKGROUND \n3 \nOn February 15, 2019, this Court granted partial summary judgment to Plaintiff \n4 \nCity of Los Angeles (the “City”) as to Count One in its First Amended Complaint for \n5 \nDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief (the “Complaint”), holding that the Defendants’ \n6 \nimposition of the immigration-related Conditions1 on the Fiscal Year (“FY”) 2018 \n7 \nEdward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistant Grant (“Byrne JAG”) program were “ultra \n8 \nvires as a matter of law and a violation of separation of powers.”  ECF No. 62 at 5-8.  \n9 \nBecause summary judgment was granted as to Count One (Plaintiff’s ultra vires claim), \n10 \nthis Court did not reach the City’s alternative grounds for partial summary judgment on \n11 \nthe FY 2018 Byrne JAG conditions (Counts Two, Three, and Four), and these were \n12 \nrendered moot.  Id. at 8.2  Determining that the requisites for entry of a permanent \n13 \ninjunction were met, this Court issued a permanent injunction that enjoined Defendants \n14 \n“from imposing the Conditions on FY 2018 Byrne JAG awards and [Gang Suppression \n15 \nPlanning Grants Program (“Gang Suppression Grant Program”)].”  Id. at 9-10.   \n16 \nOn July 1, 2019, this Court vacated part of its February 15, 2019 order and \n17 \ninjunction (ECF No. 62), “solely to the extent” that it related to the FY 2018 Gang \n18 \nSuppression Grant Program, without affecting any part of “the Court’s injunction that \n19 \nconcerns the Byrne JAG Program.”  ECF No. 79. \n20 \n21 \n \n22  1 These are the Notice Condition, the Access Condition, the 1373 and 1644 \nCondition, the Harboring Condition, the Questionnaire Condition, and the 1366 \n23 \nCondition, as set forth at ECF No. 62 at 5-8. \n24 \n2  Counts Two, Three, and Four alleged, respectively, that imposition of the \n25  challenged Conditions on the FY 2018 Byrne JAG program violated the Spending Clause \nof the U.S. Constitution, violated the anti-commandeering principles of the Tenth \n26 \nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution, and constituted arbitrary and capricious agency \n27  action under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”).  See ECF No. 40 at 38-41.  \n28 \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-JLS-JC   Document 107   Filed 07/09/20   Page 3 of 4   Page ID #:3165\n \n1  The City then moved for partial summary judgment on Counts Five through Eight \n2  and for a permanent injunction barring Defendants from imposing the challenged \n3  immigration-related Conditions on the Gang Suppression Grant Program.3  On June 17, \n4  2020, following full briefing, this Court granted the City’s motion for partial summary \n5  judgment, holding that that “Congress did not grant [the Department of Justice (“DOJ”)] \n6  the power to impose the challenged Conditions” on the Gang Suppression Grant Program \n7  and “their imposition, therefore, is ultra vires.”  ECF No. 105 at 13.  Having granted \n8  relief on the basis of the ultra vires claim (Count Five), ECF No. 40 at 42-46, the Court \n9  did not reach the City’s alternative grounds (Counts Six through Eight) for partial \n10  summary judgment regarding the Gang Suppression Grant Program.  ECF No. 105 at 13-\n11  14.4  Concluding that the City “carried its burden” to obtain a permanent injunction \n12  limited to the City, id. at 15, this Court permanently restrained and enjoined the \n13  “Defendants and their officers, agents, servants and employees . . . from conditioning, \n14  withholding, or delaying Gang Suppression Planning Grants Program awards with \n15  respect to City based on the six immigration-related conditions imposed on applicants of \n16  the Fiscal Year 2018 Gang Suppression Program.”  Id. at 16.  \n17 \nII.  FINAL JUDGMENT \n18 \nFor the reasons stated above and in prior orders, and pursuant to Federal Rule of \n19 \nCivil Procedure 58, the Court hereby ENTERS final judgment in favor of Plaintiff City \n20 \nof Los Angeles.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the permanent injunctions \n21 \n22 \n \n23  3 These were the Access Condition, the Notice Condition, the 1373 and 1644 \nCondition, the Harboring Condition, the Questionnaire Condition, and the 1366 \n24 \nCondition, as set forth in ECF No. 105 at 4-6.  \n25 \n4 Counts Six, Seven, and Eight alleged, respectively, that imposition of the \n26  challenged Conditions on the Gang Suppression Grant Program violated the Spending \nClause of the U.S. Constitution, violated the anti-commandeering principles of the Tenth \n27 \nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution, and constituted arbitrary and capricious agency \n28  action under the APA.  See ECF No. 40 at 46-49. \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347-JLS-JC   Document 107   Filed 07/09/20   Page 4 of 4   Page ID #:3166\n \n1  previously entered by the Court (ECF Nos. 62 and 105) are incorporated into this final \n2  judgment. \n3 \nIII.  PRESERVATION OF RIGHTS \n4 \nThe City preserves its rights to seek reasonable costs, including attorney’s fees, for \n5 \nthis matter and any future related proceeding.  Defendants preserve their rights to object \n6 \nto or to oppose any attempt by the City to recover costs or attorney’s fees. \n7 \n \n8 \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \n9 \nDated:  July 09, 2020          ______________________________ \n                 \n10 \n                HON.

DECLARATORY AND \n  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n22 \nJEFFERSON B. SESSIONS, III, in his   \n23  official capacity as Attorney General of the   \nUnited States; LAURA ROGERS, in her \n24 \nofficial capacity as Acting Principal Deputy \n25 \nAssistant Attorney General of the Office of \nJustice Programs; UNITED STATES \n26 \nDEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. \n27 \n \n  Defendants. \n28 \n \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 2 of 33   Page ID #:2\n \nINTRODUCTION \n1 \n1.  The City of Los Angeles (“Los Angeles” or “City”) files this Complaint \n2 \nseeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the United States Department of \n3 \nJustice (“DOJ” or “Department”) from unconstitutionally seeking to wield authority it \n4 \ndoes not have to advance policy objectives it cannot lawfully effectuate in such a \n5 \nmanner—all at the expense of public safety and community trust in Los Angeles and \n6 \nother communities. \n7 \n2.  Numerous courts nationwide already have enjoined DOJ from using federal \n8 \nfunding to punish jurisdictions like Los Angeles for refusing to abandon their successful \n9 \ncommunity policing practices—built on engendering community trust—to instead assist \n10 \nin the civil immigration enforcement policy of the Trump Administration. \n11 \n3.  The federal funds at issue in this Complaint are Fiscal Year (“FY”) 2018 \n12 \nEdward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (“Byrne JAG”) funds.  34 U.S.C. \n13 \n§ 10152(a)(1).  Congress established the Byrne JAG Program specifically to make grants \n14 \n“for use by the State or unit of local government” in order to provide “additional \n15 \npersonnel, equipment, supplies, contractual support, training, technical assistance, and \n16 \ninformation systems for criminal justice.”  Id. § 10152(a)(1).  Byrne JAG grants are \n17 \nawarded through a statutory formula based on population and rate of violent crime.  They \n18 \nare administered by a component of DOJ, the Bureau of Justice Assistance (“BJA”) \n19 \nwithin DOJ’s Office of Justice Programs. \n20 \n4.  Nothing in the Byrne JAG legislation that Congress enacted permits BJA to \n21 \ncondition grant funding on a local jurisdiction’s willingness to engage in federal civil \n22 \nimmigration enforcement.  To the contrary, such conditions are antithetical to the purpose \n23 \nfor which Congress created the funding program—that is, to support local criminal \n24 \njustice programs. \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n1 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 3 of 33   Page ID #:3\n \n5.  The FY 2018 Byrne JAG grant application released by DOJ flouts the \n1 \nrationale of an earlier ruling by this Court in a case involving a different federal grant \n2 \nprogram related to community-oriented policing,1 as well as rulings involving the FY \n3 \n2017 Byrne JAG grant issued by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh \n4 \nCircuit and federal district courts in Chicago and Philadelphia. \n5 \n6.  Four conditions on the FY 2018 Byrne JAG grant are materially identical to \n6 \nthe conditions on the FY 2017 Byrne JAG grants that have been enjoined by the courts.  \n7 \nThose conditions require States and localities to: (1) comply with 8 U.S.C. § 1373, which \n8 \nprovides that States and localities “may not prohibit, or in any way restrict” government \n9 \nentities and officials from “sending to, or receiving from” the United States Department \n10 \nof Homeland Security (“DHS”) information “regarding the citizenship or immigration \n11 \nstatus, lawful or unlawful, of any individual”; (2) comply with 8 U.S.C. § 1644, which \n12 \nprovides that no States and localities “may be prohibited, or in any way restricted” from \n13 \n“sending to or receiving from” DHS “the immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of an \n14 \nalien in the United States”; (3) provide 48 hours’ advance notice to DHS, “where \n15 \nfeasible” and when requested, before releasing an alien from state or local custody; and \n16 \n(4) provide DHS agents with “access to any correctional facility in order to meet with an \n17 \nalien (or an individual believed to be an alien) and inquire as to his right to be or remain \n18 \nin the United States.”  Although it did not make this argument in defending the materially \n19 \nidentical conditions on the FY 2017 Byrne JAG grants, DOJ suggests that compliance \n20 \n21                                                   \n1 Plaintiff here, the City of Los Angeles, previously filed a lawsuit in this District Court \n22 \nchallenging FY 2017 Byrne JAG grant conditions, along with conditions on the FY 2017 \n23  Community Oriented Policing Services (“COPS”) Hiring Program grant, in City of Los \nAngeles v. Sessions, Case No. 2:17-cv-07215-R-JCx.  The Court granted the City’s \n24 \nMotion for Summary Judgment against the immigration-related conditions on the COPS \n25  grant causes of action and permanently enjoined DOJ from imposing those conditions in \nfuture COPS grant cycles.  City of Los Angeles v. Sessions, 293 F. Supp. 3d 1087 (C.D. \n26 \nCal. 2018), appeal pending.  The motion by Los Angeles for a preliminary injunction \n27  against similar conditions in the FY 2017 Byrne JAG grant is currently pending. \n28 \n2 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 4 of 33   Page ID #:4\n \nwith the third and fourth conditions relating to “Notice” and “Access” is required under \n1 \nvarious statutory provisions of the INA. \n2 \n7.  In addition to re-imposing those conditions for the FY 2018 Byrne JAG \n3 \napplication that have previously been enjoined for FY 2017 Byrne JAG grants, the \n4 \nDepartment of Justice adds new and equally unlawful conditions, mandatory \n5 \ncertifications, and a questionnaire, all of which seek to deny funds to jurisdictions like \n6 \nLos Angeles that use their funds and resources for local criminal justice programs rather \n7 \nthan to participate in federal civil immigration enforcement.   \n8 \n8.  The immigration-related conditions, questions, and certifications permeate \n9 \nDOJ’s FY 2018 Byrne JAG grant solicitation and are facially unconstitutional and \n10 \notherwise unlawful for a number of reasons.   \n11 \n9.  First, the immigration-related conditions, questions, and certifications \n12 \nviolate the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers.  The constitutional authority to \n13 \nspend federal government money, and to attach reasonable and lawful terms and \n14 \nconditions to the receipt of federal funds, belongs to Congress, not the Executive Branch.  \n15 \nDOJ, as an agency of the Executive Branch, may not unilaterally impose terms on federal \n16 \ngrants to States and local governments in the absence of a specific and unambiguous \n17 \nauthorization from Congress, which has not occurred with respect to the immigration-\n18 \nrelated conditions DOJ seeks to attach to FY 2018 Byrne JAG grants.  On this basis \n19 \nalone, the new Byrne JAG funding conditions violate the Constitution. \n20 \n10.  DOJ’s actions also offend the basic separation of powers principle that an \n21 \nExecutive Branch agency has no power to act unless Congress has delegated authority to \n22 \nit.  See City & Cty. of San Francisco v. Trump, Nos. 17-17478, 17-17480, 2018 WL \n23 \n3637911, at *4-5 (9th Cir. Aug. 1, 2018) (holding that the Executive Order conditioning \n24 \nall federal funding on compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373 is an unlawful attempt by the \n25 \nTrump Administration to “coopt” for itself Congress’s exclusive spending power). \n26 \n11.  DOJ’s FY 2018 immigration-related conditions are not authorized by, and \n27 \nindeed are incompatible with, the statute Congress enacted establishing the Byrne JAG \n28 \n3 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 5 of 33   Page ID #:5\n \nProgram because the conditions cannot be reconciled with Congress’s directive that funds \n1 \nbe allocated through an explicit funding formula involving only two factors:  population \n2 \nand rates of violent crime.  DOJ’s conditions also undermine Congress’s express \n3 \ndirective that Byrne JAG funds be used only to provide seven types of support for \n4 \ncriminal justice, through eight types of specified criminal justice programs.  DOJ’s \n5 \nconditions would redirect those funds to State and local law enforcement agencies that \n6 \nparticipate in federal civil immigration enforcement.  Multiple courts have found \n7 \nspecifically that DOJ’s efforts to impose immigration-related conditions on Byrne JAG \n8 \ngrants “violate the separation of powers doctrine and are ultra vires.”  City of Chicago v. \n9 \nSessions, 264 F. Supp. 3d 933, 943 (N.D. Ill. 2017); City of Philadelphia v. Sessions, 280 \n10 \nF. Supp. 3d 579, 659 (E.D. Pa. 2017); City of Chicago v. Sessions, 888 F.3d 272, 293 (7th \n11 \nCir. 2018); City of Philadelphia v. Sessions, 309 F. Supp. 3d 289, 321, 331 (E.D. Pa. \n12 \n2018); City of Chicago v. Sessions, No. 17 C 5720, 2018 WL 3608564, at *13 (N.D. Ill. \n13 \nJuly 27, 2018). \n14 \n12.  DOJ cannot mount an end-run around these court rulings by now claiming \n15 \nthat the same unconstitutional conditions are related to inapplicable statutes.  As part of \n16 \nthe Byrne JAG application, an applicant must certify that it “will comply with all \n17 \nprovisions of this part and all other applicable Federal laws.”  34 U.S.C. \n18 \n§ 10153(a)(5)(D) (emphasis added).  The federal laws in which DOJ purports to ground \n19 \nits immigration-related conditions are not “applicable” laws under that provision.  They \n20 \nhave no relevance to the local criminal justice subject matter of the Byrne JAG program.  \n21 \nMoreover, they are not valid federal laws, as they are either facially unconstitutional or \n22 \nunconstitutional as DOJ seeks to interpret and apply them here.  \n23 \n13.  The FY 2018 Byrne JAG application also contravenes Congress’s statutory \n24 \nmandate in 34 U.S.C. § 10228 prohibiting DOJ’s use of the Byrne JAG statute to \n25 \n“exercise any direction, supervision, or control over any police force or any other \n26 \ncriminal justice agency of any State or any political subdivision thereof.” \n27 \n28 \n4 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 6 of 33   Page ID #:6\n \n14.  Second, even if the FY 2018 solicitation’s immigration-related conditions \n1 \nhad been imposed by Congress rather than DOJ, they would be unconstitutional under the \n2 \nSpending Clause and Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which limit \n3 \nthe power of the federal government to restrict federal funding for the States (and their \n4 \nmunicipalities) based on matters of law and policy that are properly reserved to the \n5 \nStates. \n6 \n15.  When Congress attaches new terms to federal funds, it must meet several \n7 \nrequirements to ensure that it is not abusing its spending power to improperly regulate \n8 \nState and local officials.  Under the Spending Clause, terms that Congress imposes on use \n9 \nof federal funds by a State or local government must be unambiguous and sufficiently \n10 \nrelated to the purpose of those federal funds.  Congress created the Byrne JAG Program \n11 \nfor the express purpose of funding local criminal justice efforts through statutorily-\n12 \nspecified types of support and programs.  DOJ’s immigration-related conditions do not \n13 \nrelate to that purpose or to the types of support and programs listed in the statute.  Rather, \n14 \nDOJ is attempting to use the Byrne JAG grant to reward localities that participate in \n15 \nfederal civil immigration enforcement, and punish those that do not.  In addition, certain \n16 \nof the conditions included in the FY 2018 Byrne JAG solicitation are so ambiguous as to \n17 \nmake it difficult for Los Angeles to ascertain what is expected of it. \n18 \n16.  Third, the conditions and certifications in the FY 2018 Byrne JAG grant \n19 \napplication are a clear indication that DOJ unconstitutionally seeks to commandeer local \n20 \npolice agencies to enforce federal civil immigration laws, in violation of the Tenth \n21 \nAmendment, confirmed by the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision in Murphy v. NCAA, \n22 \n138 S. Ct. 1461, 1477 (2018) (“The Federal Government may not command [either in the \n23 \naffirmative or through prohibitive language] the States’ officers, or those of their political \n24 \nsubdivisions, to administer or enforce a federal regulatory program.” (citation omitted)).  \n25 \nSpecifically, the FY 2018 Byrne JAG application requires as a condition to receiving \n26 \nfunds that the Los Angeles Mayor and City Attorney certify compliance with 8 U.S.C. \n27 \n§§ 1373 and 1644.  Both statutes violate the Tenth Amendment by giving direct orders to \n28 \n5 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 7 of 33   Page ID #:7\n \nState and local governments.  See id. at 1476;  see also Philadelphia, 309 F. Supp. 3d at \n1 \n331 (holding Section 1373 unconstitutional under the anticommandeering doctrine); \n2 \nChicago, 2018 WL 3608564, at *13 (same); United States v. California, No. 2:18-cv-\n3 \n490-JAM-KJN, 2018 WL 3301414, at *14 (E.D. Cal. July 5, 2018) (stating that the \n4 \nconstitutionality of Section 1373 is “highly suspect”). \n5 \n17.  In addition, DOJ requires, as a condition for receiving FY 2018 Byrne JAG \n6 \nfunds, that top Los Angeles elected officials certify that they will not “violate, or aid or \n7 \nabet” any violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a) (forbidding knowing “conceal[ing], \n8 \nharbor[ing], or shield[ing] from detection” of an alien), or “impede” the exercise of \n9 \nauthority of federal agents under a number of federal statutes including 8 U.S.C §§ \n10 \n1226(a),(c), 1231(a)(4), 1357(a)(1), and 1366(1),(3).  But those statutes do not concern \n11 \nStates or localities and thus have no bearing here.  DOJ’s apparent interpretations of \n12 \nthose provisions as imposing mandates on State and local governments is an \n13 \nunconstitutional effort to commandeer those States and localities to participate in federal \n14 \ncivil immigration enforcement.  See Chicago, 888 F.3d at 282; California, 2018 WL \n15 \n3301414, at *19-20. \n16 \n18.  These requirements are especially disturbing because they do not exist in a \n17 \nvacuum.  High-ranking members of the Trump Administration have publicly proposed \n18 \narresting local elected officials in jurisdictions that decline to participate in federal civil \n19 \nimmigration enforcement.  In imposing its “Harboring Condition,” the Justice \n20 \nDepartment now appears to share the extraordinary view that a State or local \n21 \ngovernment’s unwillingness to be commandeered into participating in federal civil \n22 \nimmigration enforcement may be a federal crime.   \n23 \n19.  In short, the required certifications put elected officials in Los Angeles in the \n24 \nunsustainable position of either: (1) certifying compliance with statutes that are not \n25 \napplicable and could not constitutionally be applicable to the City, and undermining the \n26 \nLos Angeles Police Department’s (“LAPD”) relationship with the immigrant community \n27 \n28 \n6 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 8 of 33   Page ID #:8\n \nand threatening public safety; or (2) forfeiting FY 2018 Byrne JAG funding used to \n1 \nsupport local criminal justice efforts through combating gangs and violent crime.   \n2 \n20.  Fourth, the FY 2018 conditions on grant recipients violate the \n3 \nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”) because, in promulgating the new conditions, \n4 \nDOJ did not rely on any analysis or findings to support the implicit premise that \n5 \nindividuals whom DHS believes may be unlawfully present in the United States commit \n6 \nmore crime than do individuals legally resident in the country, and in fact failed to \n7 \nconsider the substantial evidence to the contrary.  For this reason, DOJ’s attempt to attach \n8 \nthe immigration-related conditions to the Byrne JAG grant is arbitrary and capricious in \n9 \nviolation of the APA. \n10 \n21.  In short, DOJ’s unilateral and unauthorized attempt to hold hostage federal \n11 \nfunding that Congress authorized to support State and local criminal justice programs, \n12 \nand to instead cause State and local agencies to assist with federal civil immigration \n13 \nenforcement, is unconstitutional and unlawful, and cannot be allowed to stand.  Los \n14 \nAngeles seeks injunctive relief to ensure that DOJ does not evade constitutional \n15 \nrestraints, Congressional intent, and judicial rulings protecting federal funding for State \n16 \nand local law enforcement criminal justice efforts. \n17 \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n18 \n22.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1346.

Policies and Practices of the City of Los Angeles’ Police Department \n16 \n28.  For nearly four decades, LAPD has implemented policies and practices \n17 \ndesigned to promote the public safety of the residents of Los Angeles by engendering \n18 \ncooperation and trust between its law enforcement agencies and officers on the one hand, \n19 \nand members of the City’s many immigrant communities on the other.  The fundamental \n20 \ngoal of these local policies and practices has been to encourage crime victims and \n21 \nwitnesses of criminal conduct to cooperate with LAPD, irrespective of their immigration \n22 \nstatus.  The policy is critical to public safety, especially in Los Angeles, given the size of \n23 \nthe immigrant population here.  Central to these policies has been the determination by \n24 \nlocal law enforcement and its civilian overseers to devote local resources to local \n25 \ncriminal justice efforts and leave to the federal government the investigation and \n26 \nenforcement of federal civil immigration laws. \n27 \n28 \n8 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 10 of 33   Page ID #:10\n \n29.  For example, in 1979, LAPD began a policy known as “Special Order 40”—\n1 \nadopted by the Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners and signed by then-Chief of \n2 \nPolice Daryl Gates—that restricts an LAPD officer from initiating a police action with \n3 \nthe objective of discovering a person’s immigration status, and also prohibits arrests \n4 \nbased solely on that status. \n5 \n30.  The policy behind Special Order 40, as expressed by the LAPD Board of \n6 \nPolice Commissioners nearly forty years ago, is “the principle that effective law \n7 \nenforcement depends on a high degree of cooperation between the Department and the \n8 \npublic it serves.”  This policy was adopted to ensure that individuals, regardless of their \n9 \ncivil immigration status, would report crimes to the LAPD and assist the LAPD in \n10 \napprehending and prosecuting those individuals responsible for criminal acts. \n11 \n31.  The provisions of Special Order 40, which are reflected in various forms in \n12 \nLAPD’s existing policies and procedures, are also consistent with current federal and \n13 \nState law, because the policy restricts LAPD’s initiating a detention based on an \n14 \nindividual’s civil immigration status, and arresting an individual for a misdemeanor \n15 \nviolation that did not occur in the officer’s presence. \n16 \n32.  The LAPD policies promulgated after Special Order 40 are compliant with \n17 \nexisting federal law.  In the 2009 case, Sturgeon v. Bratton, the California Court of \n18 \nAppeal rejected a legal challenge to Special Order 40—as set forth in Section 4/264.50 of \n19 \nthe LAPD Manual—ruling that the language of the policy does not conflict with 8 U.S.C. \n20 \n§ 1373 (“Section 1373”), and is not invalid.  As the Court of Appeal recognized, Section \n21 \n1373 addresses certain communications between federal and State or local authorities; \n22 \nSpecial Order 40 does not address that issue, but rather prohibits police officers from \n23 \ninitiating police action to determine immigration status and making arrests for illegal \n24 \nentry.  174 Cal. App. 4th 1407 (Cal. Ct. App. 2009).  It has nothing to do with \n25 \ncommunications between LAPD and federal authorities. \n26 \n33.  In 2014, LAPD adopted a practice of refusing to detain individuals, \n27 \notherwise eligible for release from custody under State law, on the basis of requests from \n28 \n9 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 11 of 33   Page ID #:11\n \nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) unless the requests are supported by \n1 \na judicial determination of probable cause, or a valid warrant from a judicial officer.  This \n2 \npractice was developed in response to judicial decisions declaring compliance with such \n3 \nwarrantless ICE requests to be unconstitutional, and thereby subjecting LAPD to \n4 \npotentially significant liability for violations of the Fourth Amendment.  See, e.g., \n5 \nMiranda-Olivares v. Clackamas County, No. 3:12-cv-02317-ST, 2014 WL 1414305, at \n6 \n*11 (D. Or. Apr. 11, 2014).  In addition, this practice supports LAPD’s robust community \n7 \npolicing strategy focused on preventing crime through community partnerships, \n8 \ncollaborative problem solving, and building public trust consistent with the law—\n9 \nessential components to reducing crime and protecting the public from harm. \n10 \n34.  When a member of LAPD arrests an individual in connection with a \n11 \ncriminal offense, the arrestee may be cited and released in the field where circumstances \n12 \nwarrant, or taken to one of LAPD’s ten jail detention facilities for booking.  Those LAPD \n13 \njail facilities are all categorized by the State of California as Type I facilities, which are \n14 \nlocal detention facilities used for the temporary, short-term detention of persons who may \n15 \nbe held for no more than 96 hours.  In practice, persons arrested by members of LAPD \n16 \ngenerally are kept in LAPD custody for no more than 48 hours after arrest because of the \n17 \nlimitations imposed by State law and the Constitution with respect to the period of time \n18 \nwithin which law enforcement agencies must: 1) obtain a probable cause determination \n19 \nthat an arrested individual committed a criminal offense to support the detention of the \n20 \nindividual without a warrant; and 2) transfer a detainee to court for arraignment.  See Cal. \n21 \nPen. Code § 825; Cty. of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44 (1991). \n22 \n35.  In many situations, arrestees are eligible for release from custody within a \n23 \nfew hours of arrest and booking, including by posting bail or bond, on their own \n24 \nrecognizance, or by a certificate of release. \n25 \n36.  While arrestees are in LAPD custody, LAPD permits DHS and ICE \n26 \npersonnel access to LAPD detention facilities to interview individual arrestees regarding \n27 \ncivil immigration status.  LAPD does so consistent with the State statutory requirement \n28 \n10 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 12 of 33   Page ID #:12\n \nthat such persons be provided with advance written notice explaining the purpose of the \n1 \ninterview, that the interview is voluntary, and that the person may decline to speak or opt \n2 \nto be interviewed only in the presence of his or her attorney.  See California TRUTH Act, \n3 \nCal. Gov. Code § 7283 et seq. (“California TRUTH Act”).  LAPD implements this State \n4 \nlaw by obtaining a written expression of the arrestee’s willingness prior to the interview.  \n5 \nIf the arrestee declines the interview, LAPD does not provide DHS and ICE personnel \n6 \naccess to that individual in its facilities. \n7 \nB.  The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program \n8 \n37.  Congress established the Byrne JAG Program to make grants “for use by the \n9 \nState or unit of local government” in order to provide seven types of support for criminal \n10 \njustice efforts, i.e., “additional personnel, equipment, supplies, contractual support, \n11 \ntraining, technical assistance, and information systems for criminal justice.”  34 U.S.C. \n12 \n§ 10152(a)(1).  Congress specified that these funds be used “for any one or more of the \n13 \nfollowing programs”: \n14 \n15  •  “Law enforcement programs.” \n16  •  “Prosecution and court programs.” \n17  •  “Prevention and education programs.” \n18  •  “Corrections and community corrections programs.” \n19  •  “Drug treatment and enforcement programs.” \n20  •  “Planning, evaluation, and technology improvement programs.” \n21  •  “Crime victim and witness programs (other than compensation).” \n22  •  “Mental health programs and related law enforcement and corrections \nprograms, including behavioral programs and crisis intervention teams.” \n23 \nId. § 10152(a)(1)(A)-(H). \n24 \n38.  Byrne JAG funding is administered by BJA within OJP.  See id. §§ 10151-\n25 \n58.  Each fiscal year, BJA provides State and local government awardees with funds that, \n26 \nin general, may be used over a period of four years. \n27 \n28 \n11 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 13 of 33   Page ID #:13\n \n39.  In awarding funds, BJA must follow the congressionally-mandated formula \n1 \nto allocate funds to eligible States and local governments.  By statute, funding is allocated \n2 \nbased on two factors: population and rate of violent crime.  The Attorney General must \n3 \nallocate 50 percent of the available funds to each State recipient in amounts proportionate \n4 \nto its population and its crime statistics.  Id. § 10156(a).  The remaining 50 percent of the \n5 \nfunds is allocated to each State recipient in amounts proportionate to its rate of violent \n6 \ncrime.  Id.  Of the total amount allocated to a State, 60 percent is provided as a direct \n7 \ngrant to the State, and 40 percent as grants for local governments in that State.  Id. § \n8 \n10156(b)(2), (d). \n9 \n40.  Local governments wishing to receive a grant must submit an award \n10 \napplication to BJA.  In order to be eligible for an award, Congress specified that an \n11 \napplicant must furnish certain reasonable and grant-specific certifications and assurances \n12 \nrelated to the application or administration of the grant.  Specifically, Congress \n13 \nenumerated two certifications and three assurances that an applicant must make: \n14 \n15  •  “A certification that Federal funds made available under this part will not be \nused to supplant State or local funds, but will be used to increase the \n16 \namounts of such funds that would, in the absence of Federal funds, be made \n17 \navailable for law enforcement activities.”  Id. § 10153(a)(1). \n18 \n19  •  “An assurance that, not fewer than 30 days before the application (or any \namendment to the application) was submitted to the Attorney General, the \n20 \napplication (or amendment) was submitted for review to the governing body \n21 \nof the State or unit of local government (or to an organization designated by \n22 \nthat governing body).”  Id. § 10153(a)(2). \n23 \n24  •  “An assurance that, before the application (or any amendment to the \napplication) was submitted to the Attorney General (A) the application (or \n25 \namendment) was made public; and (B) an opportunity to comment on the \n26 \napplication (or amendment) was provided to citizens and to neighborhood or \n27 \n28 \n12 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 14 of 33   Page ID #:14\n \ncommunity-based organizations, to the extent applicable law or established \n1 \nprocedure makes such an opportunity available.”  Id. § 10153(a)(3). \n2 \n3  •  “An assurance that, for each fiscal year covered by an application, the \napplicant shall maintain and report such data, records, and information \n4 \n(programmatic and financial) as the Attorney General may reasonably \n5 \nrequire.”  Id. § 10153(a)(4). \n6 \n7  •  “A certification . . . that (A) the programs to be funded by the grant meet all \nthe requirements of this part; (B) all the information contained in the \n8 \napplication is correct; (C) there has been appropriate coordination with \n9 \naffected agencies; and (D) the applicant will comply with all provisions of \n10 \nthis part and all other applicable Federal laws.”  Id. § 10153(a)(5). \n11 \n41.  Byrne JAG applications are accepted through an online program.  In order to \n12 \ncomplete the application, a representative of the applicant is required to electronically \n13 \nsign a page stating that the applicant will comply with standard “assurances” promulgated \n14 \nby the Office of Management and Budget.  These assurances include that, “throughout \n15 \nthe period of performance for the award,” “the Applicant will comply with all award \n16 \nrequirements.” \n17 \n42.  When BJA approves an application for a Byrne JAG award, BJA requires \n18 \nthe recipient to agree to an additional set of “Special Conditions.”  These conditions \n19 \ngenerally relate to the administration of the grant or the use of grant funds.  The “Special \n20 \nConditions” imposed in Los Angeles’ fiscal year FY 2016 grant award (the last year in \n21 \nwhich Byrne JAG funds were released to Los Angeles) governed various aspects of how \n22 \nthe City would be required to administer its Byrne JAG award, such as a “[r]equirement \n23 \nfor data on performance and effectiveness under the award,” “[r]equirements related to \n24 \nSystem for Award Management and Unique Entity Identifiers,” compliance with civil \n25 \nrights and nondiscrimination regulations in the administration of the award, and reporting \n26 \nof any fraud, waste, and abuse in the award implementation. \n27 \n \n28 \n13 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 15 of 33   Page ID #:15\n \nC.  The City of Los Angeles Uses Byrne JAG Funds For Critical Local \n1 \nCriminal Justice Needs \n2   \n43.  Each year since 1997 (with the exception of FY 2017, which is currently the \n3 \nsubject of a related case pending in this District), the City of Los Angeles has been \n4 \napproved for and received more than $1 million in funding under the Byrne JAG Program \n5 \n(and its predecessor).   \n6 \n44.  In the FY 2016 application cycle, Los Angeles applied for and received \n7 \napproximately $1.8 million in Byrne JAG funding for FY 2016 through FY 2019. \n8 \nApproximately $800,000 of the funding went to the County of Los Angeles as a \n9 \nsubgrantee, and $1 million remained with the City.  For FY 2016, Los Angeles received \n10 \nits funding directly from the federal government as part of a formula grant, see 34 U.S.C. \n11 \n§ 10156(d), not as a distribution from the Byrne JAG funds awarded separately to the \n12 \nState of California. \n13 \n45.  Byrne JAG funds support important criminal justice programs in Los \n14 \nAngeles.  Specifically, the City’s FY 2016 Byrne JAG funds assist in funding its \n15 \nCommunity Law Enforcement and Recovery (“CLEAR”) program, which aims to reduce \n16 \ngang violence in Los Angeles and rehabilitate communities that have experienced \n17 \nsignificant criminal activity.  Through effective collaboration among several city, county, \n18 \nand state criminal justice agencies, the program targets high-crime areas and promotes \n19 \ncommunity recovery by working closely with special criminal investigative units, an \n20 \naggressive vertical prosecutorial program, probation and parole officers, youth \n21 \nintervention organizations, and schools. \n22 \n46.  The CLEAR program has been successful.  In 2014, the CLEAR program \n23 \nareas had 22 percent less gang crime over a three-year period than similar non-CLEAR \n24 \nareas.  For FY 2016, the Byrne JAG funds supported 20 to 30 percent of the salaries for \n25 \nnine Deputy City Attorneys, nine Deputy District Attorneys, and nine Deputy Probation \n26 \nofficers related to the CLEAR program. \n27 \n28 \n14 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 16 of 33   Page ID #:16\n \n47.  The City’s use of Byrne JAG funds to support the CLEAR program and \n1 \nreduce violent crime advances the core criminal justice mission of the Byrne JAG \n2 \nProgram.  The CLEAR program’s key to success in reducing violent crime in targeted \n3 \nneighborhoods has been the dedication of various agency assets to the goal of reducing \n4 \ncrime in CLEAR sites.  Each CLEAR site includes an operational team made up of \n5 \nrepresentatives from LAPD, the County District Attorney’s Office, the City Attorney’s \n6 \nOffice, and the County Probation Department.  In addition to their focus on reducing \n7 \ncrime, the CLEAR team members collaborate with residents within each CLEAR site \n8 \nthrough the creation of a Community Impact Team.  Community members on the team \n9 \nidentify effective community organizations in their CLEAR area, and facilitate a \n10 \nrelationship between those organizations and CLEAR team members to secure support \n11 \nfrom individuals and businesses within the community. \n12 \n48.  The year-over-year federal funding for the CLEAR program has been a \n13 \ncatalyst for turning Los Angeles into a leader on coordinated approaches to seemingly \n14 \nintractable issues related to violent crime in general, and gang-related violence in \n15 \nparticular.  The CLEAR model was innovative, and went beyond the traditional methods \n16 \nof criminal suppression.  It combined, in one program, elements which have been copied \n17 \nby numerous other jurisdictions, and are now a common approach to addressing not only \n18 \ngang violence, but violent crimes generally.  These elements, such as vertical prosecution \n19 \nof all cases, regular sharing of best practices from public safety teams in various parts of \n20 \nthe City, and community outreach, have significantly informed the creation of other \n21 \ninnovative approaches to criminal justice in the City, such as the City Attorney’s \n22 \nneighborhood prosecutor program. \n23 \n49.  The City of Los Angeles has yet to receive its statutorily authorized FY 2017 \n24 \nByrne JAG funding.  The City has already submitted its application for FY 2018 Byrne \n25 \nJAG funding, in advance of the deadline of August 22, 2018.  If the City of Los Angeles \n26 \nwere to be deprived of its statutorily authorized FY 2018 Byrne JAG funding as well, Los \n27 \nAngeles would lose valuable resources needed to enhance its local criminal justice efforts \n28 \n15 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 17 of 33   Page ID #:17\n \nand advance public safety.  Consistent Byrne JAG funding ensures that the CLEAR staff \n1 \ncan continue to dedicate their time to their roles within the CLEAR team.  The funding \n2 \nalso ensures that the City’s continued dedication to cross-agency collaboration will pave \n3 \nthe way for future successes and innovations still to come. \n4 \n \n5  D.  Multiple Courts Have Rejected DOJ’s Imposition of Federal Civil \nImmigration-Related Conditions for FY 2017 Byrne JAG Awards \n6 \n \n7 \n50.  In the FY 2017 funding cycle, BJA included immigration-related conditions \n8 \nin its solicitation for the FY 2017 Byrne JAG applications.  On August 3, 2017, BJA \n9 \nissued that solicitation for applications from local governments for FY 2017 Byrne JAG \n10 \ngrants.  One immigration-related condition in the agency’s solicitation stated that \n11 \napplicants were required to certify compliance with Section 1373 in order to qualify for \n12 \nByrne JAG funding (the “1373 Condition”).2  The FY 2017 Byrne JAG application \n13 \nwould not be considered complete without that certification, which meant jurisdictions \n14 \nthat were awarded Byrne JAG funds but that did not complete the 1373 Certification \n15 \nwould be prohibited from drawing down grant funds. \n16 \n51.  Separately, the FY 2017 solicitation stated that the agency’s award would \n17 \ninclude two other, immigration-related conditions.  Those two conditions, referred to \n18 \nbelow as the “Access Condition” and the “Notice Condition”—as presented in FY 2017 \n19 \nByrne JAG awards that DOJ has already disbursed—required that “as of the date the \n20 \nrecipient accepts [its] award,” the recipient must have in place “[a] local ordinance, -rule, \n21 \n-regulation, -policy, or -practice (or an applicable State statute, -rule, -regulation, -policy, \n22 \nor -practice)” that is “designed to ensure” that: \n23 \n24 \n25                                                   \n2  Bureau of Justice Assistance, Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice, \n26 \n“Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program:  FY 2017 Local \n27  Solicitation,” available at https://www.bja.gov/Funding/JAGLocal17.pdf (“Solicitation”). \n28 \n16 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 18 of 33   Page ID #:18\n \na.  “agents of the United States acting under color of federal law in fact \n1 \nare given access [to] a local-government (or local-government-\n2 \ncontracted) correctional facility for the purpose of permitting such \n3 \nagents to meet with individuals who are (or are believed by such \n4 \nagents to be) aliens and to inquire as to such individuals’ right to be or \n5 \nremain in the United States” (the “Access Condition”); and  \n6 \n7  b.  “when a local-government (or local-government contracted) \ncorrectional facility receives from DHS a formal written request \n8 \nauthorized by the Immigration and Nationality Act that seeks advance \n9 \nnotice of the scheduled release date and time for a particular alien in \n10 \nsuch facility, then such facility will honor such request and--as early \n11 \nas practicable (see ‘Rules of Construction’ incorporated by para. 4.B. \n12 \nof this condition--provide the requested notice to DHS.” (the “Notice \n13 \n14  Condition”). \nGreenville Award, ¶ 56(1) (emphasis added), attached hereto as Exhibit A. \n15 \n52.

The Rules of Construction also stated: “Current DHS practice is ordinarily to \n22 \nrequest advance notice of scheduled release ‘as early as practicable (at least 48 hours, if \n23 \npossible).’ (See DHS Form I-247A (3/17)).  In the event that (e.g., in light of the date \n24 \nDHS made such request) the scheduled release date and time for an alien are such as not \n25 \nto permit the advance notice that DHS has requested, it shall not be a violation of this \n26 \ncondition to provide only as much advance notice as practicable.”  Id. \n27 \n28 \n17 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 19 of 33   Page ID #:19\n \n54.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, as well as \n1 \nfederal district courts in Chicago and Philadelphia, held that the Access Condition and the \n2 \nNotice Condition for the FY 2017 Byrne JAG grant were ultra vires and violated the \n3 \nseparation of powers.  The Chicago and Philadelphia district courts also held that the \n4 \n1373 Condition was unlawful because 8 U.S.C. § 1373 is unconstitutional.  \n5 \n \n6  E.  DOJ Imposes Conditions, Certifications, and Questions Relating to \nFederal Civil Immigration Enforcement on the Agency Solicitation for \n7 \nthe FY 2018 Byrne JAG Grant Despite Contrary Court Rulings in FY \n8  2017 Byrne JAG Grant Litigation. \n9  55.  In the FY 2018 Byrne JAG funding solicitation, released on July 20, 2018, \n10  BJA doubles-down by: 1) employing new versions of the previously enjoined conditions, \n11  newly disguised as requirements purportedly imposed by various preexisting statutes; 2) \n12  adding new, unconstitutional conditions; 3) requiring unlawful certifications by the City’s \n13  Mayor and Chief Legal Officer after implied threats of criminal arrest of local officials in \n14  jurisdictions that do not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement; and 4) \n15  mandating an informational disclosure relating to civil immigration practices in Los \n16  Angeles (collectively referred to as the “Challenged Conditions”). \n17  (1)  The “1373” Condition \n18  56.  The FY 2018 Byrne JAG grant solicitation imposes conditions on the receipt \n19  of an award that would require compliance with an interpretation of various federal \n20  statutes which would violate the Tenth Amendment if construed to impose such a \n21  requirement.  Not only does DOJ carry over the unconstitutional requirement for agencies \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n18 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 20 of 33   Page ID #:20\n \nto certify compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373,3 but now also requires agencies to certify \n1 \ncompliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1644.4 \n2 \n57.  8 U.S.C. § 1373 and 8 U.S.C. § 1644 are not applicable laws because they \n3 \nhave no relevance to the local criminal justice subject matter of the Byrne JAG program.  \n4 \nMoreover, Section 1373 is not a valid federal law at all, as it violates the Tenth \n5 \nAmendment, as recognized by the Chicago and Philadelphia district courts.  Section \n6 \n1644, as applied by DOJ here to impose a mandate on States and local governments, is \n7 \nlikewise unconstitutional.  Accordingly, DOJ lacks authority to require Byrne JAG \n8 \napplicants to certify compliance with either statute.  This Court’s intervention is required \n9 \nto invalidate these unconstitutional conditions.  \n10 \n(2)  The Revised “Notice and Access” Conditions. \n11 \n58.  The FY 2018 Byrne JAG application contains “Notice and Access” \n12 \nconditions that, in substance, are nearly indistinguishable from those that were enjoined \n13 \nby federal courts in Chicago, Philadelphia and Los Angeles.5  Specifically, DOJ seeks to \n14 \ncondition FY 2018 Byrne JAG funding on a jurisdiction agreeing: \n15 \n16  •  “[n]ot to impede the exercise of the authority of the federal government \nunder 8 U.S.C. § 12[2]6(a) & (c)” (authorizing federal arrest and detention \n17 \nof certain aliens based on a federal warrant, and providing mandatory federal \n18 \ndetention of certain criminal aliens) and 8 U.S.C § 1231(a)(4) (relating to \n19 \ncompletion of criminal terms of imprisonment prior to removal from the \n20 \n21                                                   \n3 See Philadelphia, 309 F. Supp. 3d at 331 (holding Section 1373 unconstitutional under \n22 \nthe anticommandeering doctrine); Chicago, 2018 WL 3608564, at *13 (same); see also \n23  California, 2018 WL 3301414, at *14. \n24  4  Section 1644 is similar to Section 1373 in that it states no State or local government \nmay be prohibited or restricted “from sending to or receiving from the Immigration and \n25 \nNaturalization Service information regarding the immigration status, lawful or unlawful, \n26  of an alien in the United States.”  8 U.S.C. § 1644. \n27  5  City of Los Angeles v. Sessions, 293 F. Supp. 3d 1087 (C.D. Cal. 2018) \n28 \n19 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 21 of 33   Page ID #:21\n \nUnited States, and exceptions allowing for removal of federal, state, and \n1 \nlocal nonviolent offenders in some circumstances before completion of \n2 \nprison term).  The Byrne JAG solicitation specifies that recipients are \n3 \nrequired to do so by providing “(where feasible) at least 48 hours’ advance \n4 \nnotice to DHS regarding the scheduled release date and time of an alien in \n5 \nthe recipient’s custody when DHS requests such notice in order to take \n6 \ncustody of the alien pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act.” \n7 \n8  •  “[n]ot to impede the exercise by DHS agents, ‘anywhere in or outside the \nUnited States’ (8 C.F.R. § 287.5(a)(1)), of their authority under 8 U.S.C. \n9 \n§ 1357(a)(1) to ‘interrogate any alien or person believed to be an alien as to \n10 \nhis right to be or to remain in the United States.’”  The Byrne JAG \n11 \nsolicitation specifies that recipients are required to do so by permitting \n12 \n“DHS agents to have access to any correctional facility in order to meet with \n13 \nan alien (or an individual believed to be an alien) and inquire as to his right \n14 \nto be or remain in the United States.”6 \n15 \n59.  In the face of court orders enjoining as unconstitutional the FY 2017 Notice \n16 \nand Access Conditions, DOJ has shifted its tactics, apparently attempting to justify \n17 \nimposition of these conditions under the Byrne JAG statute’s “applicable Federal laws” \n18 \nprovision.  See 34 U.S.C. § 10153(a)(5)(D) (applicants must comply with “all provisions \n19 \nof this part and all other applicable Federal laws”).  But the conditions remain \n20 \nunconstitutional.  The statutes on which DOJ now attempts to rely plainly do not impose \n21 \nany requirement on State and local governments, and construing them to create a mandate \n22 \non State and local governments to participate in federal civil immigration enforcement \n23 \n24 \n25 \n                                                 \n26 \n6 See FY 2018 Byrne JAG Solicitation (“2018 Solicitation”) at 36-37, available at \n27  https://www.bja.gov/funding/JAGLocal18.pdf. \n28 \n20 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 22 of 33   Page ID #:22\n \nwould violate the Tenth Amendment.  The statutes also have nothing to do with federal \n1 \ngrant funding or local criminal justice, the subject of the Byrne JAG program.   \n2 \n60.  The solicitation also provides that “[t]he reasonable costs . . . of complying \n3 \nwith these conditions, including honoring any duly authorized requests from DHS that is \n4 \nencompassed by these conditions, will be allowable costs under the award.”  2018 \n5 \nSolicitation at 37.  This provision would use Byrne JAG grant funds, which Congress \n6 \nexpressly designated for support of local criminal justice—to unlawfully fund State and \n7 \nlocal participation in federal civil immigration enforcement.   \n8 \n61.  This Court’s intervention is required to invalidate these unlawful conditions. \n9 \n(3)  The “Harboring” Condition \n10 \n62.  Trump Administration officials have threatened to arrest local officials in so-\n11 \ncalled “sanctuary” jurisdictions—i.e., jurisdictions the Trump Administration deems to be \n12 \nuncooperative in federal civil immigration enforcement because the jurisdictions \n13 \nprioritize their resources for use to protect the health and safety of their residents and \n14 \nleave to the federal government the enforcement of federal civil immigration laws.  In a \n15 \nHomeland Security Oversight meeting, Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen \n16 \nconfirmed that, at her department’s request, DOJ is exploring such prosecution of local \n17 \nelected officials under 8 U.S.C. § 1324.  Then-Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and \n18 \nCustoms Enforcement likewise stated that the Justice Department should “file charges \n19 \nagainst the sanctuary cities [referring to criminal prosecution of local officials and law \n20 \nenforcement under 8 U.S.C. § 1324]” and “hold back their funding.”7  He stated that “we \n21 \ngotta start charging some of these [sanctuary city] politicians with crimes.”8   \n22 \n23                                                   \n7  Brandon Conradis, Trump ICE Pick: Politicians Who Run Sanctuary Cities Should Be \n24 \nCharged With Crimes, THE HILL, Jan. 2, 2018, \n25  http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/367167-trump-ice-pick-politicians-who-run-\nsanctuary-cities-should-be-charged (quoting interview of then-acting ICE acting Director \n26 \nThomas Homan with Fox News). \n27 \n8  Id. \n28 \n21 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 23 of 33   Page ID #:23\n \n63.  The Justice Department now appears to share the extraordinary view that a \n1 \nState or local government’s unwillingness to be commandeered into participating in \n2 \nfederal civil immigration enforcement may be a federal crime.  Specifically, DOJ now \n3 \nconditions a jurisdiction’s statutorily-authorized FY 2018 Byrne JAG award on the State \n4 \nor local government’s chief official and chief legal advisor certifying, under penalty of \n5 \nperjury, that the jurisdiction agrees:  “Not to violate, or aid or abet any violation of, 8 \n6 \nU.S.C. § 1324(a) (forbidding any ‘person,’ in ‘knowing or in reckless disregard of the \n7 \nfact that an alien has come to, entered, or remains in the United States in violation of \n8 \nlaw,’ to ‘conceal, harbor, or shield from detection, or attempt to conceal, harbor, or shield \n9 \nfrom detection, such alien in any place, including any building or any means of \n10 \ntransportation’ or to ‘engage in any conspiracy to commit any of the preceding acts’…’or \n11 \naid or abet the commission of any of the preceding acts’).”  As with the revised Notice \n12 \nand Access Conditions, the solicitation provides that “[t]he reasonable costs . . . of \n13 \ncomplying with” the Harboring Condition is an “allowable cost[] under the award.”  \n14 \n64.   The Harboring Condition is unlawful because 8 U.S.C. § 1324 does not \n15 \nrequire States and local governments to participate in federal civil immigration \n16 \nenforcement, and could not be construed to do so without violating the Tenth \n17 \nAmendment.  The statute also has nothing to do with federal grant funding or local \n18 \ncriminal justice.  This Court’s intervention is required to invalidate this unlawful \n19 \ncondition.  \n20 \n(4)  The “Questionnaire” Condition \n21 \n65.  BJA attempts to tether FY 2018 Byrne JAG grant awards to federal civil \n22 \nimmigration enforcement by requiring each applicant to provide mandatory responses to \n23 \ncivil immigration-related questions.  Those questions are: \n24 \n25  •  (1)  “Does your jurisdiction have any laws, policies, or practices related to \nwhether, when, or how employees may communicate with DHS or ICE?” \n26 \n27 \n28 \n22 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 24 of 33   Page ID #:24\n \n1  •  (2)  “Is your jurisdiction subject to any laws from a superior political \nentity (e.g., a state law that binds a city) that meet the description in question \n2 \n1?”  2018 Solicitation at 52. \n3 \n66.  If the answer to either question is yes, the applicant must provide a copy of \n4 \neach law or policy; describe each practice; and explain how the law, policy, or practice \n5 \ncomplies with Section 1373.  Because the City of Los Angeles passes through a portion \n6 \nof its Byrne grant monies to other localities, the condition also requires the City to collect \n7 \nthis information from its subgrantees. \n8 \n67.  DOJ notes that responses to the questions “must be provided by the \n9 \napplicant as part of the JAG application” and that an agency “will not be able to access \n10 \naward funds (and its award will include a condition that withholds funds) until it submits \n11 \nthese responses.”  Id. at 28. \n12 \n68.  The information sought by DOJ is not relevant to the Byrne JAG grant and, \n13 \nin any event, has already been provided by the City to DOJ on multiple occasions in \n14 \ndifferent contexts (although not as a prerequisite to receiving grant funding).  The \n15 \napparent purpose of the questionnaire is to help DOJ enforce its other unlawful \n16 \nimmigration-related conditions. \n17 \n69.  This Court’s intervention is required to invalidate this unlawful condition. \n18 \n19  COUNT ONE \n(Violation of Separation of Powers / Ultra Vires Agency Action) \n20 \n70.  Los Angeles incorporates and re-alleges each and every allegation contained \n21 \nabove as if fully set forth herein. \n22 \n71.  Defendants’ imposition of immigration-related conditions, questionnaires, \n23 \nand certifications on Byrne JAG grant applicants violates constitutional principles of \n24 \nseparation of powers and exceeds DOJ’s lawful authority. \n25 \n72.  The Constitution confers the power of the Spending Clause on Congress, not \n26 \nthe Executive Branch.  See U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1.  It is Congress, not an Executive \n27 \nBranch agency, that has the constitutional authority to impose conditions on the receipt of \n28 \n23 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 25 of 33   Page ID #:25\n \nfederal funds, and even that power is subject to limitations such as relatedness and clarity.  \n1 \nDefendants here are attempting to wield authority that is vested in Congress, not in DOJ. \n2 \n73.  Congress specifically directed that Byrne JAG funds be issued as grants “for \n3 \nuse by the State or unit of local government” in order to provide seven types of support \n4 \nfor local criminal justice efforts—“additional personnel, equipment, supplies, contractual \n5 \nsupport, training, technical assistance, and information systems for criminal justice.” 34 \n6 \nU.S.C. § 10152(a)(1).  Congress further enumerated eight types of criminal justice \n7 \nprograms appropriate for  funding, such as “[l]aw enforcement programs,” “[p]rosecution \n8 \nand court programs,” and “[p]revention and education programs.”   \n9 \nId. § 10152(a)(1)(A)-(H).  Enforcing federal civil immigration laws is not among the \n10 \nenumerated programs. \n11 \n74.  The programs to which Congress directed Byrne JAG funding do not require \n12 \ninducing State and local support for federal investigations of civil immigration status.  \n13 \nYet, the FY 2018 Byrne JAG application authorizes funding for civil immigration-related \n14 \nprograms, and requires all jurisdictions to promise to assist in civil immigration \n15 \nenforcement as a condition of receiving funding.  Accordingly, DOJ has expressly and \n16 \nunlawfully shifted money that Congress appropriated to advance local criminal justice \n17 \nprograms away from that clear statutory purpose to fund, instead, federal civil \n18 \nimmigration enforcement, in violation of the statute.   \n19 \n75.  Congress specifically recognized when it created the Byrne JAG program \n20 \nthat State and local governments maintain the sovereign police power to protect the \n21 \npublic health and safety of their residents by providing police departments with the \n22 \n“flexibility to spend money for programs that work for them rather than to impose a ‘one \n23 \nsize fits all’ solution.”  H.R. Rep. No. 109-233, at 89 (2005).  The record shows Congress \n24 \nintended to “lessen the administrative burden of applying for the grants.”  Id.  DOJ’s \n25 \nblatant attempt to syphon monies from locally-driven Byrne JAG funded criminal justice \n26 \nprograms, like the City’s CLEAR program, into a complex, “one size fits all” effort to \n27 \n28 \n24 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 26 of 33   Page ID #:26\n \nsupport federal civil immigration enforcement, clearly runs afoul of this congressional \n1 \nenactment and purpose. \n2 \n76.  The Challenged Conditions are also grossly inconsistent with the funding \n3 \nformula for Byrne JAG grants established in 34 U.S.C. § 10156.  BJA is required, by \n4 \ncongressional mandate, to allocate Byrne JAG funds based on a prescribed formula that \n5 \ntakes into account a State’s population, and the violent crime rates in a given State or \n6 \nlocality.  34 U.S.C. § 10156(a), (d).  Congress enumerated specific certifications and \n7 \nassurances the applicant must make to access these funds.  Again, Congress did not \n8 \ninclude a condition mandating local law enforcement involvement in federal civil \n9 \nimmigration enforcement. \n10 \n77.  The Challenged Conditions also violate an express rule of construction \n11 \nimposed by Congress.  Congress directed that the statute creating the Byrne JAG \n12 \nProgram not be construed to authorize DOJ to exercise “any direction, supervision, or \n13 \ncontrol over any police force or any other criminal justice agency of any State or any \n14 \npolitical subdivision thereof.”  34 U.S.C. § 10228(a).  The Challenged Conditions do just \n15 \nthat, asserting federal control over Los Angeles and its police department in the operation \n16 \nof its detention facilities. \n17 \n78.  Imposition of the Challenged Conditions also exceeds DOJ’s authority under \n18 \nthe statutory requirement that the applicant certify it “will comply with all provisions of \n19 \nthis part and all other applicable Federal laws.”  34 U.S.C. § 10153(a)(5)(D). \n20 \n79.  The 1373 Condition: 8 U.S.C. § 1373 is not an applicable law because it \n21 \nhas no relevance to the local criminal justice subject matter of the Byrne JAG program.  \n22 \nIt is also not a valid federal law, as it violates the Tenth Amendment.  Accordingly, DOJ \n23 \nlacks authority to require Byrne JAG applicants to certify compliance with 8 U.S.C. \n24 \n§ 1373. \n25 \n80.  The 1644 Condition: 8 U.S.C. § 1644 is not applicable because it has no \n26 \nrelevance to the local criminal justice subject matter of the Byrne JAG program.  \n27 \nMoreover, any application of § 1644 to impose a mandate on States and local \n28 \n25 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 27 of 33   Page ID #:27\n \ngovernments would violate the Tenth Amendment.  Accordingly, DOJ lacks authority to \n1 \nrequire Byrne JAG applicants to certify compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1644. \n2 \n81.  The Revised Notice and Access Conditions: DOJ cannot justify the Notice \n3 \nand Access conditions as it has revised them for the 2018 grant process to require \n4 \napplicants to certify that they do not “impede” federal officials’ performance of their \n5 \nduties under 8 U.S.C. §§ 1226(a), (c), 1231(a)(4), and 1357(a)(1).  These provisions do \n6 \nnot purport to impose any obligations on States and local governments, and so cannot be \n7 \napplicable Federal laws for which an applicant could be required to certify that it \n8 \ncomplies.  If these statutes were construed to impose requirements on States and local \n9 \ngovernments, any such application would violate the Tenth Amendment.  And even if \n10 \nthese laws could constitutionally impose obligations on States and local governments, \n11 \nand did in fact do so, they would not be applicable to the local criminal justice subject \n12 \nmatter of the Byrne JAG Program.  For all of these reasons, DOJ lacks authority to \n13 \nrequire Byrne JAG applicants to certify compliance with 8 U.S.C. §§ 1226(a), (c), \n14 \n1231(a)(4), and 1357(a)(1). \n15 \n82.  The Harboring Condition: 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(iii), (v) does not \n16 \nrequire States and local governments to participate in or assist with federal civil \n17 \nimmigration enforcement.  If this statute were construed to impose requirements on \n18 \nStates and local governments, any such application would violate the Tenth Amendment.  \n19 \nAnd even if this law could constitutionally impose obligations on States and local \n20 \ngovernments, and did in fact do so, it would not be applicable to the local criminal justice \n21 \nsubject matter of the Byrne JAG Program.  For all of these reasons, DOJ lacks authority \n22 \nto require Byrne JAG applicants to certify compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1324. \n23 \n83.  The Questionnaire Condition: DOJ has not identified any federal law \n24 \nrequiring States and local governments to complete its questionnaire concerning \n25 \nparticipation in federal civil immigration enforcement.  Accordingly, the requirement of \n26 \ncertifying compliance with applicable Federal laws cannot justify imposition of the \n27 \nQuestionnaire Condition. \n28 \n26 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 28 of 33   Page ID #:28\n \n84.  In sum, DOJ is attempting to exercise a power it does not have.  Defendants’ \n1 \nattempt to condition federal funding of local criminal justice programs in cities like Los \n2 \nAngeles on the willingness of the award grantee to engage in federal civil immigration \n3 \nenforcement violates the separation of powers enshrined in our Constitution and is ultra \n4 \nvires in violation of the Byrne JAG statute. \n5 \n6  COUNT TWO \n(Violation of the Spending Clause) \n7 \n85.  Los Angeles incorporates and re-alleges each and every allegation contained \n8 \nabove as if fully set forth herein. \n9 \n86.  Even if Congress could delegate the constitutional spending power to DOJ to \n10 \nimpose the Challenged Conditions (which it cannot), and even if it had done so (which it \n11 \nhas not), such power would be subject to constitutional restrictions that are not met here.  \n12 \nIt is well established that the Spending Clause requires that conditions on providing \n13 \nfederal funds to States and local governments must, inter alia, be unambiguous, and be \n14 \nsufficiently germane to the purpose of the federal funds.  Otherwise, the “condition” \n15 \namounts to impermissible regulation and commandeering of States and local \n16 \ngovernments, in violation of the Tenth Amendment.  The Challenged Conditions fail both \n17 \nof these requirements. \n18 \n87.  Conditions placed on the use by States and localities of federal funds must \n19 \nbe stated unambiguously. “The legitimacy of Congress’ power to legislate under the \n20 \nspending power thus rests on whether the State voluntarily and knowingly accepts” the \n21 \nconditions, and there can be “no knowing acceptance if a State [or city] . . . is unable to \n22 \nascertain what is expected of it.”  Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. \n23 \n1, 17 (1981).  It is Congress, not an agency, that must speak clearly in defining the type \n24 \nof conditions at issue.  But even if DOJ could satisfy this requirement by speaking with \n25 \nthe requisite clarity, it has not done so here.  For instance, the DOJ has not \n26 \nunambiguously explained what conduct would “impede” the exercise of federal \n27 \ngovernment authority under 8 U.S.C. § 1266(a) & (c) or § 1231(a)(4), or what it means to \n28 \n27 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 29 of 33   Page ID #:29\n \n“aid or abet” the “harbor[ing]” of a known alien under 8 U.S.C. § 1324.  Nor has DOJ \n1 \nclearly and unambiguously stated whether the version of the Notice Condition included in \n2 \nits FY 2018 solicitation would require States or localities to detain individuals beyond \n3 \ntheir scheduled release date.  These ambiguities make it difficult for Los Angeles to \n4 \nascertain exactly what is expected of it. \n5 \n88.  Conditions imposed on recipients of federal funding must “bear some \n6 \nrelationship to the purpose of the federal spending.”  New York v. United States, 505 U.S. \n7 \n144, 167 (1992).  The Challenged Conditions concern federal civil immigration \n8 \nenforcement, which is not sufficiently related—or related at all—to the purpose of the \n9 \nByrne JAG Program created by Congress specifically to support State and local criminal \n10 \njustice efforts through certain types of support and programs. \n11 \n12  COUNT THREE \n(Violation of Tenth Amendment and Anticommandeering) \n13 \n89.  Los Angeles incorporates and re-alleges each and every allegation contained \n14 \nabove as if fully set forth herein. \n15 \n90.  The Tenth Amendment prohibits the federal government from requiring \n16 \nStates and municipalities “to govern according to Congress’ instructions.”  New York, \n17 \n505 U.S. at 162, or “commanding the States’ officers . . . to administer or enforce a \n18 \nfederal regulatory program.”  Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 935 (1997).  The \n19 \nvarious federal statutes that DOJ attempts to use to justify the Challenged Conditions are \n20 \neither unconstitutional in violation of the Tenth Amendment on their face, as applied to \n21 \nState and local governments, or as DOJ interprets them to apply to State and local \n22 \ngovernments. \n23 \n91.  The 1373 Condition: DOJ’s interpretation of 8 U.S.C. § 1373 of Title 8 of \n24 \nthe United States Code to require State and local governments to participate in federal \n25 \ncivil immigration enforcement violates the Tenth Amendment making it unconstitutional \n26 \non its face.  Section 1373 purports to “unequivocally dictate[ ] what a state legislature \n27 \nmay and may not do” by prohibiting States and localities from restricting their employees \n28 \n28 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 30 of 33   Page ID #:30\n \nfrom communicating with the federal government about a person’s citizenship and \n1 \nimmigration status.  See Murphy, 138 S. Ct. at 1478; Philadelphia, 309 F. Supp. 3d at \n2 \n331; Chicago, 2018 WL 3608564, at *10. \n3 \n92.  The 1644 Condition: 8 U.S.C. § 1644 does not impose mandates solely on \n4 \nState and local governments, but to the extent it imposes on States and local governments \n5 \nmandates similar to those imposed by 8 U.S.C. § 1373, it is unconstitutional as applied \n6 \nfor the same reasons. \n7 \n93.  The Revised Notice and Access Conditions: 8 U.S.C. §§ 1226(a), (c), \n8 \n1231(a)(4), and 1357(a)(1) do not purport to impose any obligations on States and local \n9 \ngovernments.  However, if DOJ were permitted to interpret those statutes to impose an \n10 \nobligation on States and local governments to participate in federal civil immigration \n11 \nenforcement, so as not to impede federal officials’ performance of their duties pursuant to \n12 \nthese statutes, those statutes would be unconstitutional as applied. \n13 \n94.  The Harboring Condition: 8 U.S.C. § 1324 does not purport to impose any \n14 \nobligations on States and local governments.  However, if DOJ were permitted to \n15 \ninterpret that statute to make State and local officials criminally responsible for \n16 \n“harboring” based on their unwillingness to participate in federal civil immigration \n17 \nenforcement, that statute would be unconstitutional as applied. \n18 \n95.  Because these federal statutes are unconstitutional violations of the Tenth \n19 \nAmendment, or would be unconstitutional to the extent they were construed and applied \n20 \nas DOJ suggests, i.e., to impose obligations on State and local governments to participate \n21 \nin federal civil immigration enforcement, DOJ cannot require jurisdictions to comply \n22 \nwith its interpretation of these laws as a condition of receiving any Byrne JAG funds or \n23 \nany other federal funding.   \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:18-cv-07347   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 31 of 33   Page ID #:31\n \n1  COUNT  FOUR \n(Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act - Arbitrary and Capricious Agency \n2 \nAction) \n \n3 \n96.

The decision to impose civil immigration-related conditions and \n9 \ncertifications in the FY 2018 Byrne JAG grant solicitation is arbitrary and capricious \n10 \nbecause DOJ imposed those conditions and certifications without any reasoned basis, \n11 \nprovided no support for its linkage between participation by State and local law \n12 \nenforcement officials in federal civil immigration enforcement and the local criminal \n13 \njustice efforts that are the authorized purpose of the grants at issue, and appears to have \n14 \nrelied on clearly erroneous and debunked interpretations of existing studies. \n15 \n16  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n17  WHEREFORE, Plaintiff City of Los Angeles respectfully requests that this Court \n18  enter judgment in its favor, and grant the following relief: \n19  1.
