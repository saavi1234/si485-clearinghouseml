On August 22, 2018, the City and County of San Francisco (San Francisco) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. San Francisco, represented by the city attorney, sued Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Acting Assistant Attorney General, the United States Department Justice (DOJ), and dozens of unnamed defendants who were also allegedly responsible for unconstitutionally conditioning grants of federal funding.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>San Francisco alleged that, under 8 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1373 and 1644, the defendants conditioned the receipt of grants made pursuant to the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program (&ldquo;Byrne JAG program&rdquo;)--a federal funding program that supports state and local criminal justice efforts&ndash;-on immigration-related conditions. These conditions included allowing Department of Homeland Security officials to question suspected citizens in grant recipients&rsquo; custody, requiring recipients to provide advance notice of those persons&rsquo; release, prohibiting recipients&rsquo; disclosure of federal law enforcement information for certain purposes, and requiring recipients to certify that their laws complied with independent provisions relating to immigration of the Federal Code. Failure to cooperate with these conditions would deny San Francisco up to $1.4 million in Byrne JAG funds for FY2018. The DOJ justified these conditions on the ground that &ldquo;information,&rdquo; as used in &sect;&sect; 1373 and 1364, encompassed any information that could assist federal immigration authorities in detaining or removing noncitizens.</p>\r\n<p>Seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, San Francisco claimed that these conditions conflicted with existing state and county laws, and accordingly, these conditions violated the Spending Clause, separation of powers, and the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The case was assigned to Judge William Orrick. It was related to a similar case brought by the State of California on Sept. 10, 2018. Details on that case can be found here. This case is also related to two cases San Francisco had previously sued the DOJ over similar immigration conditions imposed on the Byrne JAG program twice in 2017. Details of those cases can be found here and here.</p>\r\n<p>On December 21, 2018, San Francisco moved for summary judgment. On March 4, 2019, Judge Orrick granted San Francisco's motion for summary judgment and denied the defendants' motion for partial dismissal or partial summary judgment. Judge Orrick found that the challenged conditions were ultra vires and violated the separation of powers, that 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1373 was unconstitutional, and that the Attorney General exceeded the Spending Clause by imposing ambiguous conditions on Byrne JAG grants in FY2018. Furthermore, Judge Orrick concluded that the conditions were arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, that California was entitled to the mandamus relief it was seeking in its related case, and that a nationwide injunction was warranted but stayed.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Orrick focused his analysis on the two new conditions imposed for FY2018, incorporating by reference the arguments related to the duplicate conditions from FY2017. The DOJ relied on three statutory provisions to support its conclusion that Congress had delegated authority to the Assistant Attorney General to exercise discretion over formula grants, but Judge Orrick concluded that these provisions did not grant such an independent authority to impose the FY2018 conditions on Byrne JAG grants.</p>\r\n<p>On March 26, 2019, Judge Orrick issued a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from using the FY2018 Byrne JAG funding conditions for any California state entity, San Francisco, any California political subdivision, or any jurisdiction in the United States. The judge then stayed the nationwide aspect of the permanent injunction until further rulings from the Ninth Circuit, which had expressed concerns over the nationwide nature of the relief during the 2017 litigation over Byrne JAG funding conditions.</p>\r\n<p>On May 3, 2019, the defendants appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Docket No. 19-15947). On appeal, this case was consolidated with one involving similar claims brought by the State of Oregon against President Biden and the DOJ. On July 29, 2022, the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion affirming in part, vacating in part, and remanding in part the district court&rsquo;s judgments. The court affirmed the district court&rsquo;s declaratory judgment and injunction barring the DOJ from withholding JAG program on the ground that the conditions exceeded the DOJ&rsquo;s statutory authority as conferred by Congress. This judgment was affirmed because the DOJ did not challenge it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The court vacated the district court&rsquo;s judgment that 8 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1373 and 1644 are unconstitutional without deciding the merits because they are not ripe, nor are mooted, by intervening precedent in United States v. California. In that case, the Ninth Circuit held that these statutes only cover information about what one&rsquo;s immigration status is, and thus there is no longer a conflict between the federal law and plaintiff&rsquo;s law. Thus, plaintiff's challenges were no longer ripe and consequently moot. Accordingly, the court vacated the Northern District of California&rsquo;s permanent injunction, but only to the extent it enjoined &sect; 1373&rsquo;s enforcement beyond the Byrne JAG context.&nbsp;</p>",

    "summary_short": "The city and county of San Francisco brought this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that the Department of Justice (DOJ) had unlawfully conditioned states' acceptance of certain federal funds on their compliance with federal immigration enforcement efforts. The plaintiff alleged that these conditions violated the Spending Clause and the separation of powers under the Constitution. The Court granted summary judgment for the plaintiff in March 2019. The defendants appealed to the Ninth Circuit on May 3, 2019. The Ninth Circuit vacated the district court’s judgment  that 8 U.S.C. §§ 1373 and 1644 are unconstitutional without deciding the merits because they are not ripe, or are mooted, by intervening precedent.

Whitaker, No. 18-cv-5146.  On December 21, 2018, Plaintiff State of California, \n8  ex rel., Xavier Becerra, California Attorney General (“the State” or “California”) and Plaintiff \n9  City and County of San Francisco (“San Francisco”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed Motions for \n10  Summary Judgment (“Plaintiffs’ Motions”).  On December 3, 2018 Defendants filed a Partial \n11  Motion to Dismiss and Partial Motion for Summary Judgment (“Defendants Motion,” collectively \n12  with Plaintiffs’ Motions, “the Motions”).  A hearing on the Motions was held on February 13, \n13  2019, at 2:00 p.m. \n14  On March 4, 2019, I granted Plaintiffs’ Motions and denied Defendants’ Motion (CA Dkt. \n15  No. 47; SF Dkt. No. 60).  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58, I hereby ENTER \n16  judgment in favor of Plaintiffs and against Defendants, and grant the following relief as set forth \n17  below: \nDECLARATION \n18 \n  The Court finds declaratory relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2201 is appropriate in this case.  It is \n19 \nhereby DECLARED that: \n20 \n  1.  The FY 2018 Immigration Enforcement Requirements are unconstitutional and \n21 \nunlawful because they: (i) exceed the congressional authority conferred on the \n22 \nExecutive Branch and are ultra vires on their face; (ii) they exceed Congress’s \n23 \nspending powers under Article I of the Constitution to the extent Congress conferred \n24 \nauthority on the Attorney General; and (iii) they violate the Administrative Procedure \n25 \nAct. \n26 \n  2.  8 U.S.C. § 1373 is unconstitutional on its face under the Tenth Amendment of the \n27 \nUnited States Constitution. \n28 \n   1   \nJudgment and Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motions for Summary Judgment \n (18-cv-5169-WHO and 18-cv-5146-WHO) \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-WHO   Document 63   Filed 03/26/19   Page 3 of 4\n \n1  PERMANENT INJUNCTION \n2    The Court also finds that each of the necessary elements for issuing a permanent injunction \n3  is met.  In particular, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have succeeded on the merits of their claims \n4  and that absent an injunction Plaintiffs would suffer irreparable injury; the balance of equities \n5  favor Plaintiffs; and the requested relief is in the public interest.  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \n6  Procedure 65, it is now ORDERED that Defendants ARE HEREBY RESTRAINED AND \n7  ENJOINED from committing, performing, directly or indirectly, the following acts: \n8    1.  Using the FY 2018 Immigration Enforcement Requirements as conditions for Byrne \n9  JAG funding for any California state entity, San Francisco, any California political \n10  subdivision, or any jurisdiction in the United States. \n11    2.  Withholding, terminating, or clawing back JAG funding from, or disbarring or \n12  making ineligible for JAG, any California state entity, San Francisco, any California \n13  political subdivision, or any jurisdiction in the United States on the basis of the FY \n14  2018 Immigration Enforcement Requirements. \n15    3.  Withholding, terminating, or clawing back JAG funding from, or disbarring or \n16  making ineligible for JAG, any California state entity or any California political \n17  subdivision on account of any grant condition challenged in this lawsuit and based on \n18  California Government Code section 7282 et seq. (the “TRUST Act”); California \n19  Government Code section 7283 et seq. (the “TRUTH Act”); California Government \n20  Code section 7284 et seq. (the “Values Act”). \n21    4.   Enforcing 8 U.S.C. § 1373’s statutory obligations against any California state entity \n22  or political subdivision.  \n23    Consistent with my March 4, 2019 Order granting Plaintiffs’ Motions, it is now ORDERED \n24  that the nationwide aspect of the permanent injunctive relief set forth above is STAYED until \n25  further rulings from the Ninth Circuit. \n26  MANDATORY INJUNCTION \n27    As set forth in my March 4, 2019 Order, I found all the necessary elements for issuing \n28  California mandamus relief are met.  I hereby ORDER defendants to issue without further delay \n   2   \nJudgment and Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motions for Summary Judgment \n (18-cv-5169-WHO and 18-cv-5146-WHO) \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-WHO   Document 63   Filed 03/26/19   Page 4 of 4\n \n1  the fiscal year 2018 JAG awards, without enforcement of the enjoined conditions, and JAG \n2  funding, upon a jurisdiction’s acceptance of the award, to the California Board of State and \n3  Community Corrections, and all California political subdivisions that applied for JAG awards for \n4  fiscal year 2018.  Acceptance of the FY 2018 awards by the California Board of State and \n5  Community Corrections or any California political subdivision shall not be construed as \n6  acceptance of the enjoined conditions.  After the jurisdiction or entity accepts the fiscal year 2018 \n7  award, Defendants are further ORDERED to process and approve the jurisdiction’s requests for \n8  drawdowns of the jurisdiction’s fiscal year 2018 JAG funds as it would in the ordinary course, \n9  and without regard to the enjoined conditions, compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373, or whether the \n10  jurisdiction spent its own money on the program or activity funded. \n11  IT IS SO ORDERED \n12    DATED: March 26, 2019 \n13              ____________________________ \n            Hon.

During his campaign, President Trump pledged to end federal funding to sanctuary \n3  cities.  Despite the determination by these cities that their sanctuary laws and policies make their own \n4  communities safer, healthier and stronger, his Administration has spent more than eighteen months \n5  trying to coerce them to abandon those laws and policies by threatening to defund them.  The Trump \n6  Administration’s two attempts to do so have been rebuffed by the federal courts.   \n7  2.  First, President Trump signed an executive order directing the Attorney General and \n8  Secretary of Homeland Security to ensure that “sanctuary jurisdictions” did not receive federal \n9  funds.  This Court struck it down.  Next, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) attempted to impose \n10  immigration-related requirements on FY 2017 Byrne JAG funds.  Every single court that has \n11  examined the validity of these requirements—including this Court—has found them to be \n12  unconstitutional.    \n13  3.  DOJ’s latest effort should fare no better.  DOJ recently announced that it is again \n14  attempting to coerce sanctuary jurisdictions into changing their laws and policies by imposing \n15  unconstitutional requirements on important criminal justice grant funding.  Some of the new \n16  requirements DOJ has imposed on the FY 2018 Byrne JAG funds (e.g., those that require jurisdictions \n17  to give immigration authorities both unfettered access to their jails and 48 hours’ notice before \n18  releasing an individual believed to be in the country illegally) are nothing more than repackaged \n19  versions of the FY 2017 requirements that courts across the country have struck down.  But others go \n20  much further.  Indeed, the new requirements cast a threatening pall over sanctuary jurisdictions by \n21  implying that they may be violating federal criminal laws simply by having laws or policies that limit \n22  entanglement with federal immigration policies.  \n23  4.  These extortive requirements are unlawful.  As a threshold matter, DOJ lacks the \n24  statutory authority to impose them.  The Constitution establishes a balance of power between the state \n25  and federal governments, as well as among the coordinate branches of the federal government, to \n26  prevent the excessive accumulation of power in any single entity and reduce the risk of tyranny and \n27  abuse from any government office.  An executive branch agency of the federal government may not \n28  seize for itself the power that the Constitution reserves for Congress.  Nor may it intrude on authority \nAmended Complaint; CCSF v. Sessions   1 N:\\CXLIT\\LI2018\\190133\\01315721.docx \nCase No. 3:18-cv-05146-WHO  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-WHO   Document 22   Filed 11/01/18   Page 3 of 29\n  \n1  that the Constitution has preserved for state and local governments.  The FY 2018 grant requirements \n2  violate both of these precepts.  DOJ is improperly attempting to wield powers that only Congress is \n3  entitled to invoke, and is seeking to compel San Francisco to bend its considered policy judgments, \n4  which the Constitution allows it to make for its community, to the federal government’s will.  \n5  5.  And even if DOJ has the authority to impose some conditions on the FY 2018 Byrne \n6  JAG funds, each of the challenged requirements at issue here relating to federal immigration \n7  enforcement would still be unlawful under other constitutional limits.  Those limits prevent DOJ from \n8  requiring compliance with the funding requirements because (1) they leave localities unclear about \n9  how to comply with each of the requirements, and (2) they lack a nexus between the congressionally \n10  mandated purpose of Byrne JAG funds and immigration enforcement.    \n11  6.  San Francisco faces the immediate prospect of losing over $1.4 million in this fiscal \n12  year if it does not receive FY 2018 Byrne JAG funds.  San Francisco uses these funds for a variety of \n13  important law enforcement purposes, including programs designed to reduce recidivism, provide \n14  alternative forms of prosecution, or enable drug treatment for underserved populations. \n15  7.  San Francisco faces an unacceptable choice that is precisely what the Trump \n16  Administration wishes it to have: either comply with DOJ’s unconstitutional new grant conditions and \n17  abandon local policies that San Francisco adopted to promote public safety and foster trust and \n18  cooperation between law enforcement and the public; or, maintain these policies but forfeit critical \n19  funds that it relies on to provide essential services to San Francisco residents.  \n20  8.  San Francisco is not obligated to enforce federal immigration law.  San Francisco seeks \n21  declaratory and injunctive relief to ensure that San Francisco and other sanctuary jurisdictions \n22  continue to be eligible for these funds, instead of being coerced into accepting conditions that on their \n23  face violate bedrock constitutional principles of separation of powers, as well as constitutional \n24  vagueness and germaneness restrictions on grant requirements.  \n25  JURISDICTION AND VENUE  \n26  9.  The Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. Sections 1331 and 1346.  This Court has \n27  further remedial authority under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. Sections 2201(a) and 2202 \n28  et seq.  \nAmended Complaint; CCSF v.

Venue properly lies within the Northern District of California because Plaintiff, \n2  San Francisco, resides in this judicial district and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving \n3  rise to this action occurred in this District.  28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1).     \n4  INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT \n5  11.  Assignment to the San Francisco or Oakland Division of this District is proper pursuant \n6  to Civil Local Rule 3-2(c)-(d) because a substantial part of the acts or omissions that give rise to this \n7  action occurred in the City and County of San Francisco.  \n8  PARTIES \n9  12.  Plaintiff San Francisco is a municipal corporation organized and existing under and by \n10  virtue of the laws of the State of California, and is a charter city and county.  \n11  13.  Defendant Jefferson B. Sessions III is the Attorney General of the United States.  He is \n12  sued in his official capacity.  The Attorney General is the federal official leading the DOJ, which is \n13  responsible for the governmental actions at issue in this lawsuit.   \n14  14.  Defendant Laura L. Rogers is Acting Assistant Attorney General of the United States in \n15  charge of the Office of Justice Programs, which administers Byrne JAG funding.  She is sued in her \n16  official capacity.  \n17  15.  Defendant DOJ is an executive department of the United States of America that is \n18  responsible for administering the Byrne JAG program.   \n19  16.  Doe 1 through Doe 100 are sued under fictitious names.  Plaintiff San Francisco does \n20  not now know the true names or capacities of said Defendants, who were responsible for the alleged \n21  violations, but pray that the same may be alleged in this complaint when ascertained.  \n22  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n23  I.  The Byrne JAG Program Provides Important Criminal Justice Funds To San Francisco. \n24  A.  The Byrne JAG Program \n25  17.  The Byrne JAG program is “the leading source of federal justice funding to state and \n26  local jurisdictions.”  Office of Justice Programs, Welcome to BJA’s Edward Byrne Memorial Justice \n27  Assistance Grant (JAG) Program, https://www.bja.gov/jag/ (last visited Nov. 1, 2018).  The program \n28  provides state and local governments with “critical funding necessary to support a range of program \nAmended Complaint; CCSF v. Sessions   3 N:\\CXLIT\\LI2018\\190133\\01315721.docx \nCase No. 3:18-cv-05146-WHO  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-WHO   Document 22   Filed 11/01/18   Page 5 of 29\n  \n1  areas including law enforcement, prosecution, indigent defense, courts, crime prevention and \n2  education, corrections and community corrections, drug treatment and enforcement, . . . crime victim \n3  and witness initiatives and mental health programs.”  Id. \n4  18.  The program is structured as a formula grant, awarding funds to all eligible grantees \n5  according to a prescribed metric.  Unlike discretionary grants, which agencies award under agency \n6  discretion, “‘formula’ grants . . . are not awarded at the discretion of a state or federal agency, but are \n7  awarded pursuant to a statutory formula.”  City of Los Angeles v. McLaughlin, 865 F.2d 1084, 1088 \n8  (9th Cir. 1989).  Specifically, the Bureau of Justice Assistance (“BJA”)—a department within the \n9  Office of Justice Programs (“OJP”)—awards Byrne JAG funds to all eligible grantees in amounts \n10  based on Bureau of Justice Statistics (“BJS”) calculations derived from the Byrne JAG statutory \n11  formula.  See 34 U.S.C. § 10156(d)(2)(A) (providing that the Attorney General “shall allocate to each \n12  unit of local government” funds consistent with the established formula) (emphasis added).  \n13  19.  The formula for state allocations is a function of population and violent crime.  See id. \n14  § 10156(a).  For local governments, the allocation is based on the state’s allocation and the ratio of \n15  violent crime in the locality to violent crime in the state.  See id. § 10156(d).  For example, in FY \n16  2018, California’s total allocation is $28.9 million.  Of this, $17.4 million (60 percent) is allocated to \n17  the State (see id. § 10156(b)-(d))—but a minimum of 62.9 percent of these funds must be passed \n18  through to local jurisdictions.1  The other $11.6 million (40 percent) is allocated for direct grants to \n19  local jurisdictions.  See id. § 10156(b)-(d).     \n20  20.  Congress imposed only a limited number of requirements on Byrne JAG applicants.   \n21  21.  First, Congress has required applicants to supply information about their intended use \n22  of grant funding, to demonstrate that they will spend the money on programs supporting one of the \n23  eight statutory purpose areas.  See 34 U.S.C. § 10153(a)(2) & (a)(5)(A)-(C).  Those purpose areas are: \n24  (1) law enforcement, (2) prosecution and courts, (3) prevention and education, (4) corrections and \n25 \n                                                 \n26  1 U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program \nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)–Updated August 2017, at 2, \n27  https://www.bja.gov/Funding/JAGFAQ.pdf; see also U.S. Dep’t of Justice, FY 2014 Justice Assistance \nGrant (JAG) Program Variable Pass-through (VPT) Percentages, \n28  https://www.bja.gov/Funding/JAGvpt.pdf. \nAmended Complaint; CCSF v.

None of these program purposes include \n4  federal immigration enforcement. \n5  22.  Second, Congress requires applicants to maintain and be prepared to report information \n6  demonstrating that they possess programmatic and financial integrity.  Id. § 10153(a)(4).   \n7  23.  Finally, Congress requires applicants to “certif[y]” that they “will comply with all \n8  provisions of this part and all other applicable Federal laws.”  Id. § 10153(a)(5)(D).   \n9  24.  Not one of these requirements relates to immigration.  Indeed, over a decade ago, \n10  Congress removed the only requirement in the Byrne JAG statute that touched on immigration-related \n11  issues.  In 2006, Congress specifically eliminated a funding requirement that recipients make “[a]n \n12  assurance that the State has established a plan under which the State will provide without fee to the \n13  Immigration and Naturalization Service, within 30 days of the date of their conviction, notice of \n14  conviction of aliens who have been convicted of violating the criminal laws of the State and under \n15  which the State will provide the Service with the certified record of such a conviction within 30 days \n16  of the date of a request by the Service for such record.”  42 U.S.C. § 3753(a)(11) (2002). \n17  25.  Given the limited discretion Congress has bestowed upon DOJ under the Byrne JAG \n18  statute for these formula grants, the Attorney General has no authority to withhold or reduce federal \n19  grant funding that a state or local government is entitled to receive.  DOJ officials acknowledged as \n20  much in the recent past, when then-Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik wrote a letter to Senator \n21  Richard Shelby regarding the Senator’s request that DOJ tie federal grant funding to federal \n22  immigration priorities.  Kadzik stated that DOJ could not do so because “many Department grant \n23  funds are formula based” such that “the Department does not have the discretion to suspend funding at \n24  all.”2   \n25 \n26 \n27                                                   \n2 Defs’ Administrative Record, City and County of San Francisco v.

San Francisco Uses Byrne JAG Funding To Support Important City Programs. \n2  26.  The San Francisco Department of Children, Youth and Their Families (“DCYF”) \n3  applies for local Byrne JAG funds and state pass-through funds on behalf of the City.  DCYF keeps a \n4  portion of the grant and also administers grant funds to the following departments: the Adult Probation \n5  Department, District Attorney, Public Defender, Police Department, and Sheriff.  DCYF also passes \n6  through funds from the local grant to the San Francisco Superior Court and a third-party evaluator. \n7  27.  Before FY 2017, San Francisco received state and local Byrne JAG funds every year \n8  for well over a decade.   \n9  28.  San Francisco submitted its FY 2017 Byrne JAG application on September 5, 2017, but \n10  OJP has not yet taken action on it.3   \n11  29.  San Francisco submitted its FY 2018 Byrne JAG application on August 21, 2018, but \n12  OJP has not yet taken action on it.4  \n13  30.  For FY 2018, San Francisco is entitled to a direct Byrne JAG formula grant of \n14  $489,966.  San Francisco also expects to receive a state pass-through of Byrne JAG funds in the \n15  amount of $941,915. \n16  31.  Consistent with the Byrne JAG statute, San Francisco uses its Byrne JAG funds to \n17  support critical law enforcement programs designed to reduce criminal behavior and improve public \n18  safety.  Specific programs funded with this grant include: (1) Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion, an \n19  innovative approach that seeks to accomplish the goals of reduced criminal behavior and improved \n20  public safety by connecting appropriate low-level drug offenders with services; (2) Focused Drug \n21  Deterrence, short and long term proactive activities including targeted investigations and enforcement \n22  and social network analysis to increase the identification of individuals involved in high-level drug \n23  markets; (3) Drug Court Prosecution, which seeks to connect criminal defendants who suffer from a \n                                                 \n24 \n3 DOJ has, on information and belief, awarded FY 2017 Byrne JAG grants to hundreds of other \njurisdictions—“jurisdictions that share the Department’s commitment to keeping criminal aliens off \n25 \nour streets and our law abiding citizens safe.”  Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Justice, DOJ Releases \nFY17 JAG Funding (June 27, 2018), https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDOJOJP/bulletins/ \n26 \n1fa6e57.  Now that this Court has declared the FY 2107 grant conditions unconstitutional, DOJ has \nrepresented that San Francisco will receive its award soon.   \n27 \n4 DOJ has, on information and belief, awarded FY 2018 Byrne JAG grants to hundreds of other \n28  jurisdictions.

San Francisco uses Byrne JAG pass-through funds to support a Young Adult Court \n12  aimed at reducing recidivism for youth ages 18-25.  This Court was designed in response to a growing \n13  body of neuroscience research showing that young adults are fundamentally different from both \n14  juveniles and older adults in how they process information and make decisions.  Our traditional justice \n15  system is not well-equipped to address cases involving these individuals, who are qualitatively \n16  different in development, skills, and needs from both children and older adults.  The Young Adult \n17  Court fills this gap by providing case management and other support for eligible young adult offenders \n18  from high-risk backgrounds. \n19  33.  These City programs span six departments, and a total of approximately ten full-time \n20  equivalent positions for these programs are funded with Byrne JAG funds.  Without local and state \n21  Byrne JAG funds, San Francisco could be forced to reduce or eliminate these programs, including \n22  eliminating staff positions, unless other funding sources could be identified. \n23 \nII.  The Trump Administration Has Engaged In Ongoing Attempts To Coerce Sanctuary \nJurisdictions To Change Their Policies By Threatening To Withhold Federal Funding.   \n24 \n25  34.  President Trump’s Administration has engaged in a longstanding campaign to \n26  unlawfully withhold federal funding from so-called sanctuary jurisdictions.  Despite the Byrne JAG \n27  program being a formula grant—which means that Congress alone can decide who receives federal \n28  funding, and how much—and in disregard of the important local purposes that Byrne JAG funding \nAmended Complaint; CCSF v.

These requirements are \n3  designed to coerce state and local jurisdictions to participate in enforcing federal immigration law and \n4  abandon any state or local policies that limit or prohibit such participation.  That is, the requirements \n5  aim to eradicate sanctuary cities, consistent with President Trump’s longstanding threats. \n6  A.  President Trump First Attempted To Act By Executive Fiat.  \n7  35.  San Francisco is one of many jurisdictions across the country that has enacted sanctuary \n8  policies that seek to promote public safety locally and build trusting and supportive relationships with \n9  immigrant communities.  Many jurisdictions believe—and studies have shown5—that communities are \n10  stronger, healthier, and safer when state and local employees decline to participate in the federal \n11  government’s responsibility to enforce federal immigration law.  \n12  36.  Nevertheless, the Trump Administration has made it their mission to eradicate \n13  sanctuary cities.  President Trump frequently promised to “defund” sanctuary cities, and to use the \n14  threat of withholding federal funds as “a weapon” to coerce local jurisdictions to change their \n15  policies.6  Shortly after President Trump took office, his press secretary confirmed that “[w]e are going \n16  to strip federal grant money from the sanctuary states and cities that harbor illegal immigrants.  The \n17  American people are no longer going to have to be forced to subsidize this disregard for our laws.”7  \n18  37.  The Attorney General echoed this position.  Soon after taking office, the Attorney \n19  General suggested that he would use every means necessary to withhold federal funding from \n20  “sanctuary cities.”8  He has broadly described sanctuary city “policies” as those requiring local law \n                                                 \n21 \n5 See Tom K.

The Administration tried to carry through on these threats during President Trump’s \n4  first week in office.  President Trump issued Executive Order 13,768, which called for denying all \n5  federal funding to sanctuary jurisdictions and further authorized the Attorney General to take \n6  unspecified enforcement action against sanctuary cities.   \n7  39.  The Administration touted the Executive Order as a means to achieving the President’s \n8  goal of “ending sanctuary cities . . . .  [T]he President has been very clear through his executive order \n9  that federal funds, paid for by hardworking taxpayers, should not be used to help fund sanctuary \n10  cities.”10  The Administration vowed that “the President is going to do everything he can within the \n11  scope of the executive order to make sure that cities who don’t comply with it—counties and other \n12  institutions that remain sanctuary cities don’t get federal government funding in compliance with the \n13  executive order.”11  \n14  40.  The Administration’s efforts here were stopped by this Court, which permanently \n15  enjoined Section 9(a) of the Executive Order for violating the Constitution.

Trump, 897 F.3d 1225 (9th Cir. 2018).  The Court held, inter alia, that \n18  the President—and in turn, the Attorney General and the Secretary of DHS—lacked the authority “to \n19  place a new condition on federal funds . . . not authorized by Congress,” and thus had violated the \n20  “fundamental constitutional structure” of the separation of powers.

The Attorney General Unilaterally Imposes Immigration-Related Requirements \nOn The FY 2017 Byrne JAG Program. \n13 \n14  42.  With its initially broad efforts to withhold federal funds to sanctuary cities put in check \n15  by the courts, the Administration adopted a more targeted approach focusing on the Byrne JAG \n16  program and similar grant programs that DOJ administers.  As relevant here, the Attorney General \n17  unilaterally imposed three new immigration-related requirements on the 2017 Byrne JAG awards—\n18  requirements designed to coerce Byrne JAG recipients into enforcing federal immigration law. \n19  43.  First, the FY 2017 Byrne JAG Local Solicitation provided that OJP would require \n20  grant applicants to “provide at least 48 hours’ advance notice to DHS regarding the scheduled release \n21  date and time of an alien in the jurisdiction’s custody when DHS requests such notice in order to take \n22  custody of the alien under the Immigration and Nationality Act.”  FY 2017 Local Solicitation at 30 \n23  (attached as Exh. 1).   \n24  44.  In the FY 2017 award documents that DOJ eventually issued, DOJ expanded on this \n25  requirement (the “FY 2017 Notice Requirement”), explaining that: \nA State statute, or a State rule, -regulation, -policy, or –practice, must be in place that is \n26 \ndesigned to ensure that, when a State (or State-contracted) correctional facility receives \nfrom DHS a formal written request authorized by the Immigration and Nationality Act \n27 \nthat seeks advance notice of the scheduled release date and time for a particular alien in  \n28 \nAmended Complaint; CCSF v.

Hanson at ¶¶ 5-6 & Exh. B at 18, San Francisco v. Sessions, ECF No. 46-1 (“Hanson \n3  Decl.”).  \n4  45.  Second, the FY 2017 Local Solicitation provided that OJP would require grant \n5  applicants to “permit personnel of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to access any \n6  correctional or detention facility in order to meet with an alien (or an individual believed to be an \n7  alien) and inquire as to his or her right to be or remain in the United States.”  FY 2017 Local \n8  Solicitation at 30 (attached as Exh. 1). \n9  46.  In the FY 2017 award documents, DOJ described this requirement regarding access to \n10  correctional facilities (the “FY 2017 Access Requirement”) as requiring that: \nA State statute, or a State rule, -regulation, -policy, or –practice, must be in \n11 \nplace that is designed to ensure that agents of the United States acting under \ncolor of federal law in fact are given to access any State (or State-\n12 \ncontracted) correctional facility for the purpose of permitting such agents to \nmeet with individuals who are (or are believed by such agents to be) aliens \n13 \nand to inquire as to such individuals’ right to be or remain in the United \nStates. \n14 \n15  Hanson Decl. at ¶¶ 5-6 & Exh. B at 18. \n16  47.  Third, DOJ stated that it would require jurisdictions to certify their compliance with \n17  8 U.S.C. Section 1373, which provides that a “local government entity or official may not prohibit, or \n18  in any way restrict, any government entity or official from sending to, or receiving from, [federal \n19  immigration officials] information regarding the citizenship or immigration status . . . of any \n20  individual.”  8 U.S.C. § 1373(a).  Although DOJ’s move toward requiring jurisdictions to certify \n21  compliance with this section had been in progress since 2016, it was not until the FY 2017 Byrne JAG \n22  application that DOJ expressly applied this requirement (the “FY 2017 Section 1373 Requirement”) to \n23  all jurisdictions.   \n24  48.  Critically, since the Trump Administration has come into office, DOJ has declared that \n25  it interprets Section 1373 much more broadly than local jurisdictions like San Francisco could have \n26  previously imagined—specifically, that it reads “information regarding the citizenship or immigration \n27  status” to include all information that would assist federal immigration authorities to determine a \n28 \nAmended Complaint; CCSF v.

DOJ claimed that two different general statutory provisions gave the Attorney General \n5  the authority to impose these FY 2017 Requirements on Byrne JAG recipients.  DOJ claimed that 34 \n6  U.S.C. § 10153(a)(5)(D), which requires Byrne JAG grant recipients to certify that they “will comply \n7  with all provisions of this part and all other applicable Federal laws” (see ¶ 23, supra), allowed the \n8  Attorney General to require that grant recipients comply with Section 1373.  Defs.’ Mot. for Summ. J. \n9  at 17-18, San Francisco v. Sessions, ECF No. 113.  \n10  50.  DOJ took a different approach with respect to the FY 2017 Notice and Access \n11  Requirements.  DOJ did not argue that either Requirement stemmed from an existing statutory \n12  obligation, and thus did not assert that Section 10153(a)(5)(D)’s “all applicable laws” language \n13  allowed the Attorney General to impose them.  Instead, DOJ relied on a different statutory provision, \n14  34 U.S.C. § 10102(a)(6)—which allows the Assistant Attorney General overseeing OJP to “exercise \n15  such other powers and functions as may be vested in [him or her] pursuant to this chapter or by \n16  delegation of the Attorney General, including placing special conditions on all grants, and determining \n17  priority purposes for formula grants.”  See Defs.’ Mot. for Summ. J. at 9-14, San Francisco v. \n18  Sessions, ECF No. 113.  DOJ asserted that the FY 2017 Notice and Access Requirements were special \n19  conditions covered by this provision. \n20  51.  The new FY 2017 Requirements elicited a wave of legal challenges, and several courts, \n21  including this Court, have already struck them down.  Indeed, to date all the federal courts that have \n22  considered those requirements have found them unlawful.  See City and Cty. of San Francisco v. \n23  Sessions, No. 17-CV-04642-WHO, 2018 WL 4859528 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 5, 2018); City of Chicago v. \n24  Sessions, 888 F.3d 272, 276 (7th Cir. 2018) (invalidating FY 2017 Notice and Access Requirements); \n25  see also City of Philadelphia v. Sessions, 309 F.

The Attorney General Imposes New Requirements On FY 2018 Byrne JAG Recipients. \n4  52.  Now that its previous efforts to withhold federal grant funds have been held unlawful \n5  by courts around the country, President Trump’s Administration is trying another approach to turn the \n6  Byrne JAG program into a weapon against sanctuary jurisdictions.   \n7  53.  On July 20, 2018, DOJ posted the State and Local Solicitations for the FY 2018 Byrne \n8  JAG grants, in which it announced that it would impose a number of immigration-related requirements \n9  on jurisdictions seeking 2018 Byrne JAG funding.13   \n10  54.  Some of the new requirements set forth in the 2018 Solicitation were little more than a \n11  dressed up version of the Administration’s earlier efforts: The 2018 Local Solicitation includes a \n12  Section 1373 Requirement that is virtually indistinguishable from the FY 2017 version—even though \n13  that Certification has now been held invalid by multiple courts.  See ¶ 51, supra.  And it includes \n14  repackaged efforts to require jurisdictions to provide notice of an inmate’s release and access to \n15  correctional facilities when immigration officials request it—requirements that DOJ now attempts to \n16  tie to a statutory obligation, despite its inability to do so over the previous year of litigation regarding \n17  the FY 2017 Notice and Access Requirements. \n18  55.  But other new requirements in the 2018 Solicitation went much further.  DOJ added \n19  several new requirements that imply that sanctuary jurisdictions interfere with various federal laws and \n20  regulations—even though those laws and regulations impose no obligations whatsoever on states and \n21                                                   \n13 DOJ has also announced that it will impose similar grant requirements on a number of other \n22  public safety grants, including (1) Supporting Innovation: Field-Initiated Programs to Improve Officer \nand Public Safety; (2) Justice Accountability Initiative: Pilot Projects Using Data-driven Systems to \n23  Reduce Crime; (3) Gang Suppression Planning: Build Capacity for a Multilateral Data-Driven \nStrategy to Promote Public Safety; and (4) A Law Enforcement and Prosecutorial Approach To \n24  Address Gang Recruitment of Unaccompanied Alien Children program.

In addition to imposing these requirements, \n26  DOJ has also stated that it will “allow for preferential consideration of a grant application where the \napplicant plans to use immigration-cooperation tactics to address public safety in their jurisdiction.”  \n27  Id.  In the course of announcing those new requirements, the Attorney General stated that they are \ndesigned to “encourage these ‘sanctuary’ jurisdictions to change their policies that undermine public \n28  safety.”  Id. \nAmended Complaint; CCSF v.

And they further suggest that sanctuary jurisdictions may violate federal criminal \n2  laws simply by having laws that limit entanglement with federal immigration policies.  This is a \n3  considerable escalation in the Trump Administration’s threats against sanctuary jurisdictions.   \n4  56.  In October 2018, DOJ sent award documents (“Grant Award Documents”) to several \n5  hundred jurisdictions—not including San Francisco—whose Byrne JAG grant applications had been \n6  approved.14  For example, New Jersey received award documents, which are attached hereto as \n7  Exhibit 3.  The Grant Award Documents contain several immigration-related “Special Conditions.”   \n8  57.  Some of the Special Conditions restate the requirements anticipated by the 2018 \n9  Solicitations and described above; for instance, the Award Documents include the same Section 1373 \n10  Requirement.  Others, however, deviate from the requirements as described previously.  See, e.g., \n11  ¶¶ 91-95, infra. \n12  58.  Each of the Immigration-Related FY 2018 Requirements is unlawful because DOJ \n13  lacks the statutory authority to impose it.  And even if DOJ had that authority, constitutional limits \n14  would still prevent it from requiring compliance with these particular conditions.   \n15  A.  The FY 2018 Section 1373 Requirement \n16  59.  Although multiple courts have found the FY 2017 Section 1373 Requirement invalid, \n17  DOJ is attempting to impose a virtually identical requirement on 2018 Byrne JAG funds.15  See FY \n18  2018 Local Solicitation at 36 (attached as Exh. 2); FY 2018 Grant Award Documents at 12-14 \n19  (attached as Exh. 3). \n20 \n21 \n                                                 \n14 See Office of Justice Programs, Awards Made for ‘BJA FY 18 Edward Byrne Memorial \n22 \nJustice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program – Local Solicitation,’ \nhttps://external.ojp.usdoj.gov/selector/title? \n23 \nsolicitationTitle=BJA%20FY%2018%20Edward%20Byrne%20Memorial%20Justice%20Assistance%\n20Grant%20(JAG)%20Program%20-%20Local%20Solicitation&po=BJA (last visited Nov. 1, 2018).  \n24 \n15 The FY 2018 Section 1373 Requirement differs from the FY 2017 version in only two ways.  \n25  First, the FY 2018 Section 1373 Requirement also requires that Byrne JAG recipients certify that they \ndo not violate 8 U.S.C. § 1644 (“Section 1644”), which imposes identical obligations to those that \n26  Section 1373 itself mandates.  FY 2018 Local Solicitation at 36 (attached as Exh. 2); see also id. at 42 \n(attached as Exh. 2).  Second, the FY 2018 Section 1373 Requirement demands that jurisdictions \n27  seeking to accept a FY 2018 Byrne JAG award provide OJP with “[i]nformation regarding \nCommunications with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and/or Immigration and Customs \n28  Enforcement (ICE).”  Id. at 27 (attached as Exh. 2). \nAmended Complaint; CCSF v.

As it did for FY 2017, DOJ is requiring San Francisco to certify that, as to the “program \n2  or activity” funded with Byrne JAG dollars, San Francisco does not have in effect, purport to have in \n3  effect, or is subject to or bound by “any prohibition or any restriction . . . that deals with either (1) a \n4  government entity or –official sending or receiving information regarding citizenship or immigration \n5  status as described in 8 U.S.C. §§ 1373(a) and 1644; or (2) a government entity or agency sending to, \n6  requesting or receiving from, maintaining, or exchanging information of the types (and with respect to \n7  the entities) described in 8 U.S.C. § 1373(b).”  FY 2018 Local Solicitation at 43 (attached as Exh. 2); \n8  FY 2018 Grant Award Documents at 12-14 (attached as Exh. 3); see also FY 2017 Local Solicitation \n9  at 38 (attached as Exh. 1). \n10  61.  Although a FY 2018 Byrne JAG applicant is not required to execute the Section 1373 \n11  Certification to apply for a FY 2018 Byrne JAG award, OJP has stated that an applicant will be unable \n12  to accept an award until the certification is completed by the grant recipient and received by OJP.  FY \n13  2018 Local Solicitation at 27 (emphasis added) (attached as Exh. 2). \n14  62.  The Grant Award Documents confirm that prospective grant recipients must submit the \n15  required certification of compliance with 8 U.S.C. 1373, executed by the Chief Legal Officer of the \n16  State or local jurisdiction, in order to make a valid acceptance of the grant.  See FY 2018 Grant Award \n17  Documents at 12 (attached as Exh. 3). \n18  63.  This Court has already held that DOJ lacks the authority to impose the Section 1373 \n19  Requirement on Byrne JAG recipients.  See City and Cty. of San Francisco v. Sessions, No. 17-CV-\n20  04642-WHO, 2018 WL 4859528 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 5, 2018).  The Court enjoined DOJ from “[u]sing the \n21  Section 1373 certification condition, and the access and notice conditions (“Challenged Conditions”) \n22  as funding restrictions for any Byrne JAG awards.”  Judgment and Order, City and Cty of San \n23  Francisco v. Sessions, No. 17-cv-04642-WHO (C.D. Cal. Oct. 5, 2018), ECF No. 146. \n24  64.  Imposing the Section 1373 Requirement on San Francisco in connection with the FY \n25  2018 Byrne JAG grant violates this Court’s order. \n26  65.  Moreover, the Section 1373 Requirement is invalid for several reasons.   \n27  66.  As an initial matter, Section 1373 is unconstitutional on its face.   \n28 \nAmended Complaint; CCSF v. Sessions   15 N:\\CXLIT\\LI2018\\190133\\01315721.docx \nCase No. 3:18-cv-05146-WHO  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-WHO   Document 22   Filed 11/01/18   Page 17 of 29\n  \n1  67.  And even if the provision were constitutional, nothing in the Byrne JAG statute—or \n2  any other federal law—gives the Attorney General the authority to impose this condition on the Byrne \n3  JAG grant. \n4  68.  The Section 1373 Requirement also violates the Spending Clause because (a) it is \n5  ambiguous as to what jurisdictions must do to be in compliance, and (b) it is not germane to the \n6  purposes of the Byrne JAG program. \n7  B.  The Notice Requirement \n8  69.  OJP also stated in the Local Solicitation that it will require Byrne JAG recipients to \n9  make certifications related to a host of other federal laws contained in the Immigration and Nationality \n10  Act.  Specifically, Byrne JAG applicants’ Chief Legal Officer will have to execute a document called \n11  “State or Local Government: FY 2018 Certification Relating to 8 U.S.C. §§ 1226(a) & (c), 1231(a), \n12  1324(a), 1357(a), & 1366(1) & (3)” (hereafter, “Immigration-Related Certification”).   \n13  70.  The Grant Award Documents do not specifically reference the Immigration-Related \n14  Certification; however, the Immigration-Related Certification is still listed on OJP’s website as one of \n15  the “required certifications from applicant to the FY 2018 Byrne JAG Local program.”  See \n16  https://ojp.gov/funding/Explore/SampleCertifications-8USC1373.htm (last visited Nov. 1, 2018).  As \n17  of the date of this filing, the document was most recently revised on October 25, 2018.  A copy of the \n18  October 25 version is attached as Exhibit 4.  According to the Local Solicitation, an “applicant will be \n19  unable to make a valid award acceptance” until the certification is completed and “received by OJP on \n20  or before the day the unit of local government submits an executed award document.”  FY 2018 Local \n21  Solicitation at 27 (emphasis omitted) (attached as Exh. 2). \n22  71.  Among other things, the Immigration-Related Certification requires the Chief Legal \n23  Officer—in San Francisco’s case, City Attorney Dennis J. Herrera—to certify that San Francisco has \n24  no policies or practices that would or do impede federal officers’ exercise of authority relating to 8 \n25  U.S.C. Sections 1226, 1231, or 1366.  See Immigration-Related Certification (attached as Exh. 4).  \n26  Specifically, City Attorney Herrera has to certify:  \n27  a.  that he has conducted a “careful[] review[]” of Sections 1226(a) & (c), 1231(a), \n28  and 1366(1) & (3);  \nAmended Complaint; CCSF v.

In the body of the FY 2018 Local Solicitation, OJP has given one example of conduct \n10  that it believes “impedes” federal officials’ exercise of their duties under these provisions.  OJP states \n11  that grant recipients will be required to not “impede” the exercise of the authority of the federal \n12  government under Section 1226 “specifically by requiring such recipients to provide (where feasible) \n13  at least 48 hours’ advance notice to DHS regarding the scheduled release date and time of an alien in \n14  the recipient’s custody when DHS requests such notice in order to take custody of the alien pursuant to \n15  the Immigration and Nationality Act.”  FY 2018 Local Solicitation at 36-37 (emphasis added) \n16  (attached as Exh. 2). \n17  73.  The Grant Award Documents also incorporate this concept in an enumerated special \n18  condition.  Special Condition 46 (“Noninterference . . . with federal law enforcement: Notice of \n19  scheduled release”) requires grant recipients to agree that “[c]onsonant with” Sections 1226, 1231, and \n20  1366, the recipient will provide “advance notice to DHS of the scheduled release date and time” for an \n21  immigrant “as early as practicable.”  FY 2018 Grant Award Documents at 17 (attached as Exh. 3). \n22  74.    Failure to comply with this special condition is considered a violation of the terms of \n23  the Byrne JAG grant and may result in the termination of the award or other legal action.   Id. at 2. \n24  75.  This requirement (the “FY 2018 Notice Requirement”) is thus nothing more than a \n25  repackaged version of the FY 2017 Notice Requirement, which DOJ now for the first time attempts to \n26  connect to statutory provisions.  But these provisions impose no such requirement. \n27  76.

Section 1226 authorizes arresting and detaining certain undocumented immigrants, and \n4  provides that the federal government “shall take into custody” certain criminal aliens “when the alien \n5  is released, without regard to whether the alien is released on parole, supervised release, or \n6  probation . . . .”  8 U.S.C. § 1226(a) & (c)(1). \n7  78.  Section 1366 requires the Attorney General to submit an annual report to the House and \n8  Senate Judiciary Committees detailing (1) “the number of illegal aliens incarcerated in Federal and \n9  State prisons for having committed felonies,” and (2) the “programs and plans underway in the \n10  Department of Justice to ensure the prompt removal from the United States of criminal aliens subject \n11  to removal.”  8 U.S.C. § 1366(1) & (3). \n12  79.  By their own terms, these sections’ terms apply solely to the federal government—\n13  indeed, solely to the Attorney General himself.  They do not impose any obligations whatsoever on \n14  local governments.     \n15  80.  Nonetheless, OJP is attempting to use these sections as a hook to require state and local \n16  jurisdictions to provide notice to DHS regarding the scheduled release date and time of an alien in the \n17  jurisdiction’s custody.   \n18  81.  This attempt violates the separation of powers because DOJ lacks the authority to \n19  impose the FY 2018 Notice Requirement on Byrne JAG recipients.  Nothing in the Byrne JAG \n20  statute—or any other federal law—gives the Attorney General the authority to impose this condition. \n21  82.  Furthermore, the FY 2018 Notice Requirement violates the Spending Clause because:  \n22    a.   it is ambiguous as to what jurisdictions must do to be in compliance [e.g., San \n23  Francisco has no way to know whether OJP might consider other practices to “impede” federal \n24  officials in performing their duties under Sections 1226, 1231, and 1366)]; and  \n25    b.   it is not germane to the purposes of the Byrne JAG program [the FY 2018 \n26  Notice Requirement and the referenced US code provisions are federal civil immigration requirements \n27  that have nothing to do with local criminal justice, or with any of the other purposes of the Byrne JAG \n28  program]. \nAmended Complaint; CCSF v.

The Access Requirement \n2  83.  The Immigration-Related Certification also requires Byrne JAG recipients to make \n3  assurances “relating to” 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a).  It requires the Chief Legal Officer to certify that San \n4  Francisco has no policies or practices that would or do impede federal officers’ exercise of authority \n5  relating to Section 1357.  See Immigration-Related Certification (attached as Exh. 4).  Specifically, the \n6  City Attorney Herrera will have to certify:  \n7  a.  that he has conducted a “careful[] review[]” of Section 1357(a);  \n8  b.  that he has conducted (or caused to be conducted) a diligent inquiry and review \n9  of “the ‘program or activity’ to be funded (in whole or in part) with the federal financial assistance \n10  sought by the applicant entity under this FY 2018 OJP Program” as well as “any laws, rules, policies, \n11  or practices . . . that implicate any of the requirements related to” Section 1357(a); and   \n12  c.  that, as to the “program or activity” funded with Byrne JAG dollars, San \n13  Francisco does not have in effect or purport to have in effect, and is not subject to or bound by, “any \n14  law, rule, policy, or practice . . . that would or does . . . impede the exercise by federal officers of \n15  authority under 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a).”  See id. \n16  84.  Section 1357 provides, inter alia, that “[a]ny officer or employee of the [federal] \n17  Service . . . shall have power without warrant . . . to interrogate any alien or person believed to be an \n18  alien as to his right to be or to remain in the United States.”  8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(1).   \n19  85.  By its own terms, this section does not impose any obligations at all on local \n20  governments.  It applies solely to the federal government—specifically to federal immigration officers \n21  and federal immigration employees.  Nonetheless, OJP attempts to use it as a hook to require state and \n22  local jurisdictions to permit personnel of the Department of Homeland Security to access correctional \n23  facilities.     \n24  86.  As reflected in the Local Solicitation, DOJ reads Section 1357 in conjunction with 8 \n25  C.F.R. § 287.5(a)(1)—which states that an immigration officer can exercise this interrogation power \n26  “anywhere in or outside the United States”—to mean that immigration officials have a right to \n27  interrogate anyone believed to be an alien any place and any time, without obtaining any form of \n28  warrant.  See FY 2018 Local Solicitation at 37 (attached as Exh. 2). \nAmended Complaint; CCSF v.

The Grant Award Documents also incorporate this concept in an enumerated special \n2  condition.  Special Condition 45 (“Noninterference . . . with federal law enforcement: Interrogation of \n3  certain aliens”) requires grant recipients to agree that “[c]onsonant with” federal law, including \n4  Section 1357 and 8 C.F.R. 287.5(a)(1), the recipient will not “imped[e] access to any State or local \n5  government (or government-contracted) correctional facility by [federal] agents for the purpose of \n6  ‘interrogat[ing] any alien or person believed to be an alien as to his [or her] right to be or to remain in \n7  the Unites States.’” FY 2018 Grant Award Documents at 16 (attached as Exh. 3) (second and third \n8  alterations in original).   \n9  88.  This requirement (the “FY 2018 Access Requirement”) is nothing more than a \n10  repackaged version of the FY 2017 Access Requirement, which DOJ now—for the first time—\n11  attempts to connect directly to a statutory provision rather than to the general authority for “special \n12  conditions.” \n13  89.  The FY 2018 Access Requirement violates the separation of powers because DOJ lacks \n14  the authority to impose the FY 2018 Access Requirement on Byrne JAG recipients.  Nothing in the \n15  Byrne JAG statute—or any other federal law—gives the Attorney General the authority to impose this \n16  condition. \n17  90.  Furthermore, the FY 2018 Access Requirement violates the Spending Clause because:  \n18    a.   it is ambiguous as to what jurisdictions must do to be in compliance [e.g., San \n19  Francisco has no way to know whether OJP might consider other practices to “impede” federal \n20  officials in performing their Section 1357 duties]; and  \n21    b.   it is not germane to the purposes of the Byrne JAG program [the FY 2018 \n22  Access Requirement and Section 1357 are federal civil immigration requirements that have nothing to \n23  do with local criminal justice, or with any of the other purposes of the Byrne JAG program]. \n24  D.  The Section 1324 Requirement \n25  91.  The Local Solicitation indicated that DOJ was also imposing a new requirement on \n26  grant recipients relating to 8 U.S.C. Section 1324.  Section 1324 forbids any “person,” in “knowing or \n27  in reckless disregard of the fact that an alien has come to, entered, or remains in the United States in \n28  violation of law,” to “conceal[], harbor[], or shield[] from detection or attempt[] to conceal, harbor, or \nAmended Complaint; CCSF v.

The Local Solicitation stated that “generally speaking,” the award conditions would \n5  require recipients to agree “[n]ot to violate, or aid or abet any violation of” Section 1324(a).  FY 2018 \n6  Local Solicitation at 36 (attached as Exh. 2). \n7  93.  Similarly, the version of the Immigration-Related Certification attached to the Local \n8  Solicitation would have required the recipient’s Chief Legal Officer to certify that, as to the “program \n9  or activity” funded with Byrne JAG dollars, San Francisco does not have in effect or purport to have in \n10  effect, and is not subject to or bound by, “any law, rule, policy, or practice . . . that would or does . . . \n11  violate, or aid or abet any violation of, 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a).”  Id. at 45. \n12  94.  In the Grant Award Documents, however, DOJ shifted focus.  Special Condition 44 \n13  (“Noninterference . . . with federal law enforcement: No public disclosure of certain law enforcement \n14  sensitive information”) states that “[c]onsistent with the purposes and objectives” of federal laws, \n15  including Section 1324:  \nno public disclosure may be made of any federal law enforcement information \n16 \nin a direct or indirect attempt to conceal, harbor, or shield from detection . . . \nany alien who has come to, entered, or remains in the United States in violation \n17 \nof 8 U.S.C. ch. 12 – without regard to whether such disclosure would constitute \n(or could form a predicate for) a violation of [Section 1324]. \n18 \n19  Grant Award Documents at 15 (attached as Exh. 3). \n20  95.  Reflecting this change, the October 25, 2018 version of the Immigration-Related \n21  Certification no longer contains a freestanding requirement of general compliance with Section 1324.  \n22  Rather, it requires City Attorney Herrera—as the Chief Legal Officer of San Francisco—to certify: \nI (and also the applicant entity) understand that USDOJ will—by award \n23 \ncondition—require States and local governments . . . not to publicly disclose \nfederal law enforcement information in an attempt to conceal, harbor, or shield \n24 \ncertain individuals from detection, whether or not in violation of 8 U.S.C. § \n1324(a) or other laws. \n25 \n26  Immigration-Related Certification ¶ 3 (attached as Exh. 4). \n27 \n28 \nAmended Complaint; CCSF v.

DOJ lacks the statutory authority to impose this Requirement (the “Section 1324 \n2  Requirement”) on Byrne JAG recipients.  Nothing in the Byrne JAG statute—nor any other federal \n3  law—gives the Attorney General the authority to impose this condition. \n4  97.  Furthermore, the FY 2018 Access Requirement violates the Spending Clause because:  \n5    a.   it is ambiguous as to what jurisdictions must do to be in compliance [e.g., the \n6  special condition states that disclosure of information may be a violation of the Requirement “without \n7  regard to whether such disclosure would constitute (or could form a predicate for) a violation” of \n8  Section 1324, but provides no guidance on what conduct that does not violate Section 1324 would \n9  nonetheless constitute a violation of the Section 1324 Requirement]; \n10     b.   it is not germane to the purposes of the Byrne JAG program [the Section 1324 \n11  Requirement is a federal civil immigration requirement that has nothing to do with local criminal \n12  justice, or with any of the other purposes of the Byrne JAG program]. \n13  98.  Collectively, this Complaint refers to the FY 2018 Section 1373 Requirement, the FY \n14  2018 Notice Requirement, the FY 2018 Access Requirement, and the Section 1324 Requirement as the \n15  “Challenged FY 2018 Requirements.”   \n16  IV.  San Francisco Faces Immediate Injury From The Challenged FY 2018 Byrne JAG \nRequirements. \n17 \nA.  San Francisco Cannot Certify Compliance With The Challenged FY 2018 Byrne \nJAG Requirements Without Changing Its Laws And Policies.  \n18 \n19  99.  San Francisco is unable to execute the Immigration-Related Certification.  \n20  San Francisco’s existing laws and policies prevent it from certifying that it complies with several of \n21  the new requirements that DOJ has imposed.  And as to others, the ambiguity regarding the meaning \n22  and scope of the requirements creates significant uncertainty for San Francisco—uncertainty that \n23  makes it impossible for San Francisco to execute the Immigration-Related Certification.16 \n24 \n                                                 \n25  16 Based on this Court’s ruling that San Francisco’s current laws and policies comply with \nSection 1373 (see City and Cty. of San Francisco v. Sessions, No. 17-CV-04642-WHO, 2018 WL \n26  4859528, at *28-30 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 5, 2018)), San Francisco believes it could sign the Section 1373 \ncertification.  But it should not have to.  San Francisco should not be forced to comply with an \n27  unconstitutional grant requirement—much less an unconstitutional law.  It should be able to change its \nlaws as it deems appropriate without concern that this will cause it to be deprived of important Byrne \n28  JAG funds. \nAmended Complaint; CCSF v.

For example, the San Francisco Sheriff’s Department (“SFSD”) has policies regarding \n2  access to jails for ICE officials enforcing civil immigration laws.  Specifically, the Sheriff’s \n3  Department policy prohibits Sheriff’s Department employees from providing ICE agency \n4  representatives, or any other individual conducting civil immigration enforcement, access to inmates \n5  in jail, access to SFSD computers, databases and logs, release dates and times for inmates, and home \n6  or work contact information.17   \n7  101.  These policies make it difficult, if not impossible, for San Francisco to comply with the \n8  FY 2018 Access Requirement.  See ¶¶ 83-86, supra. \n9  102.  Similarly, San Francisco has laws regarding City employees’ authority to provide \n10  advance notification of an individual in custody’s release date.  Specifically, Chapter 12I of \n11  San Francisco’s Administrative Code—part of San Francisco’s Sanctuary City laws—prohibits San \n12  Francisco law enforcement officials from responding to a federal immigration officer’s request for \n13  advance notification of the date and time an individual in San Francisco’s custody is being released, \n14  unless the individual in custody meets certain criteria.  See S.F. Admin. Code § 12I.3(c)-(d).18  \n15  103.  This law makes it difficult, if not impossible, for San Francisco to comply with the FY \n16  2018 Notice Requirement.  See ¶¶ 69-73, supra. \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20                                                   \n17 ICE requests for assistance with criminal investigations are directed to the Sheriff, who \n21  directs any assistance to ICE agents as she deems appropriate. \n18 These laws serve important public purposes, as the legislative findings set forth in Chapter \n22 \n12I confirm.  The Board of Supervisors has declared: \n23  Fostering a relationship of trust, respect, and open communication between City \nemployees and City residents is essential to the City’s core mission of ensuring \n24  public health, safety, and welfare, and serving the needs of everyone in the \ncommunity, including immigrants.  The purpose of this Chapter 12I, as well as \n25  of Administrative Code Chapter 12H, is to foster respect and trust between law \nenforcement and residents, to protect limited local resources, to encourage \n26  cooperation between residents and City officials, including especially law \nenforcement and public health officers and employees, and to ensure \n27  community security, and due process for all.  \n28  See Section 12I.1. \nAmended Complaint; CCSF v.

The Challenged FY 2018 Requirements Put San Francisco To An Unconstitutional \n1  Choice.  \n2  104.  The Challenged FY 2018 Requirements create an untenable choice for San Francisco, \n3  when it is faced with the decision whether to accept the FY 2018 Byrne JAG award.  San Francisco \n4  must choose between amending its laws and policies to allow it to execute the Immigration-Related \n5  Certification, or forgoing hundreds of thousands of dollars in important criminal justice funding. \n6  105.  As described above, San Francisco cannot sign the Immigration-Related Certification in \n7  light of various ambiguities and potential conflicts with San Francisco’s laws and policies.  If San \n8  Francisco maintains those laws and policies and declines to execute the Immigration-Related \n9  Certification, it will have to forgo direct FY 2018 Byrne JAG funding.  This is because recipients are \n10  required to certify that they comply with all applicable award conditions and execute all necessary \n11  certifications in order to accept a FY 2018 Byrne JAG award.19 \n12  106.  San Francisco will also have to forgo the pass-through grant it expects to receive from \n13  the State of California.  \n14  107.  On information and belief, the State of California has applied for FY 2018 Byrne JAG \n15  funds.  Once the State of California receives Byrne JAG funds, it issues a request for proposals \n16  (“RFP”) for local jurisdictions to apply for pass-through funds.  San Francisco has applied for, and \n17  received, pass-through Byrne JAG funds in the past pursuant to this RFP process.  But to receive pass-\n18  through Byrne JAG funds, San Francisco would be required to submit assurances that it will comply \n19  with all award requirements.   \n20  108.  The loss of this funding will have significant negative impacts on San Francisco.  The \n21  variety of programs that Byrne JAG funding supports will be placed in jeopardy.  San Francisco could \n22  be forced to reduce or eliminate these programs, and the staff positions they support, unless additional \n23  funding sources could be identified.  \n24 \n25 \n26                                                   \n19 When it submitted its application for FY 2018 Byrne JAG funding, San Francisco included a \n27  reservation of rights regarding the Challenged FY 2018 Requirements.  San Francisco made clear that \nit was not certifying that it would comply with the Challenged FY 2018 Requirements, and stated that \n28  it was planning to challenge those requirements in litigation. \nAmended Complaint; CCSF v.

Alternatively, San Francisco could change its local laws and policies to attempt to \n2  comply with the Challenged FY 2018 Requirements—a difficult endeavor given the significant \n3  ambiguities about the scope and meaning of many of those Requirements.   \n4  110.  More significantly, changing its local laws and policies would also harm San Francisco \n5  by forcing it to abandon its considered and constitutionally protected policy judgments.  \n6  San Francisco’s Sanctuary City laws and policies reflect lawmakers’ considered judgment that public \n7  safety, public health, and community cohesion are best served by limiting local employees’ \n8  entanglement with federal immigration priorities to the extent possible under federal law.  By \n9  threatening to withhold funds, DOJ seeks to intrude on San Francisco’s sovereign authority to make \n10  such policy choices. \n11  COUNT ONE: SEPARATION OF POWERS  \n12  THE CHALLENGED FY 2018 CONDITIONS VIOLATE SEPARATION OF POWERS \n13  111.  Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference each allegation of the prior paragraphs as \n14  if fully set forth herein. \n15  112.  In July 2018, Defendants issued a solicitation seeking applications for the FY 2018 \n16  Byrne JAG program. \n17  113.  San Francisco has applied for the FY 2018 Byrne JAG program. \n18  114.  In October 2018, Defendants sent grant award documents to several hundred \n19  jurisdictions, which include several immigration-related special conditions.   \n20  115.  The Constitution vests Congress with legislative powers, see U.S. Const. art. 1, § 1, and \n21  the spending power, see U.S. Const. art. 1, § 8, cl. 1.  Absent a statutory provision or an express \n22  delegation, only Congress is entitled to attach conditions to federal funds. \n23  116.  Congress has not enacted the Challenged FY 2018 Requirements as part of any \n24  statutory scheme. \n25  117.  Congress has not enacted the Challenged FY 2018 Requirements as applicable to Byrne \n26  JAG funds. \n27  118.  Congress has not delegated to Defendants the authority to impose the Challenged FY \n28  2018 Requirements on Byrne JAG funds. \nAmended Complaint; CCSF v.

Defendants are unilaterally imposing the Challenged FY 2018 Requirements without \n2  authorization from Congress. \n3  120.  For these reasons, DOJ in imposing the Challenged FY 2018 Requirements \n4  unconstitutionally intrudes upon and usurps powers that belong to Congress, violating principles of \n5  separation of powers. \n6  COUNT TWO: SPENDING CLAUSE \n7  THE CHALLENGED FY 2018 CONDITIONS VIOLATE THE SPENDING CLAUSE \n8  121.  Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference each allegation of the prior paragraphs as \n9  if fully set forth herein.   \n10  122.  As described above, the Challenged FY 2018 Requirements violate separation of \n11  powers principles because they are not authorized by Congress, expressly or impliedly. \n12  123.  Even if Congress had delegated its authority to impose conditions on Byrne JAG funds, \n13  the Challenged FY 2018 Requirements would violate the Spending Clause by: \n14  a.  imposing conditions that are ambiguous, see Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. \n15  Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981) (“The legitimacy of Congress’ power to legislate under the \n16  spending power . . . rests on whether the State voluntarily and knowingly accepts [Congress’ \n17  conditions]…  There can, of course, be no knowing acceptance if a State is unaware of the conditions \n18  or is unable to ascertain what is expected of it…  [I]f Congress intends to impose a condition on the \n19  grant of federal moneys, it must do so unambiguously.” ) (citations omitted); and \n20  b.  imposing conditions that are not germane to the stated purposes of the Byrne \n21  JAG funds, see South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 207 (1987) (“[C]onditions on federal grants \n22  might be illegitimate if they are unrelated ‘to the federal interest in particular national projects or \n23  programs.’”) (citation omitted).   \n24  COUNT THREE: TENTH AMENDMENT  \n8 U.S.C. § 1373(a) IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL \n25 \n26  124.

On its face, Section 1373 commandeers state and local governments in violation of the \n2  Tenth Amendment to the Constitution by, inter alia, regulating the “States in their sovereign \n3  capacity,” Reno v. Condon, 528 U.S. 141,150 (2000), limiting state authority to regulate internal \n4  affairs and determine the duties and responsibilities of state employees, Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. \n5  452,460 (1991), and ultimately forcing states to allow their employees to use state time and state \n6  resources to assist in the enforcement of federal statutes regulating private individuals, Reno, 528 U.S. \n7  at 151, and to provide information that belongs to the state and is available to them only in their \n8  official capacity, Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 932-33 & n.17 (1997).  \n9    126.  As applied to state and local Sanctuary City laws, like San Francisco Administrative \n10  Code Chapters 12H and 12I, which were enacted to further legitimate local interests grounded in the \n11  basic police powers of local government and related to public health and safety, Section 1373(a) \n12  commandeers state and local governments and violates the Tenth Amendment to the United States \n13  Constitution. \n14   \n15  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n16  Wherefore, San Francisco prays that the Court grant the following relief: \n17  1.  Declare the Challenged FY 2018 Requirements Defendants have imposed on the Byrne \n18  JAG program unconstitutional; \n19  2.  Permanently enjoin Defendants from using the Challenged FY 2018 Requirements as \n20  funding restrictions for any Byrne JAG awards, now or in the future; \n21  3.  Declare that 8 U.S.C. Section 1373(a) is unconstitutional and invalid on its face; \n22  4.  Enjoin Defendants from enforcing Section 1373(a) or using it as a condition for \n23  receiving federal funds; \n24  5.  Award San Francisco reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees; and \n25  6.  Grant any other further relief that the Court deems fit and proper. \n26   \n27 \n28 \nAmended Complaint; CCSF v.

During his campaign, President Trump pledged to end federal funding to sanctuary \n3  cities.  Despite the determination by these cities that their sanctuary laws and policies make their own \n4  communities safer, healthier and stronger, his Administration has spent more than eighteen months \n5  trying to coerce them to abandon those laws and policies by threatening to defund them.  The Trump \n6  Administration’s two attempts to do so have been rebuffed by the federal courts.   \n7  2.  First, President Trump signed an executive order directing the Attorney General and \n8  Secretary of Homeland Security to ensure that “sanctuary jurisdictions” did not receive federal \n9  funds.  A court in this district struck it down.  Next, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) attempted to \n10  impose immigration-related requirements on FY 2017 Byrne JAG funds.  Every single court that has \n11  examined the validity of these requirements has found them to be unconstitutional.    \n12  3.  DOJ’s latest effort should fare no better.  DOJ recently announced that it is again \n13  attempting to coerce sanctuary jurisdictions into changing their laws and policies by imposing \n14  unconstitutional requirements on important criminal justice grant funding.  Some of the new \n15  requirements DOJ has imposed on the FY 2018 Byrne JAG funds (e.g., those that require jurisdictions \n16  to give immigration authorities both unfettered access to their jails and 48 hours’ notice before \n17  releasing an individual believed to be in the country illegally) are nothing more than repackaged \n18  versions of the FY 2017 requirements that courts across the country have struck down.  But others go \n19  much further.  Indeed, the new requirements cast a threatening pall over sanctuary jurisdictions by \n20  implying that they may be violating federal criminal laws simply by having laws or policies that limit \n21  entanglement with federal immigration policies.  \n22  4.  These extortive requirements are unlawful.  As a threshold matter, DOJ lacks the \n23  statutory authority to impose them.  The Constitution establishes a balance of power between the state \n24  and federal governments, as well as among the coordinate branches of federal government, to prevent \n25  the excessive accumulation of power in any single entity and reduce the risk of tyranny and abuse \n26  from any government office.  An executive branch agency of the federal government may not seize for \n27  itself the power that the Constitution reserves for Congress.  Nor may it intrude on authority that the \n28  Constitution has preserved for state and local governments.  The FY 2018 grant requirements violate \nComplaint; CCSF v. Sessions   1 N:\\CXLIT\\LI2018\\190133\\01299103.docx \nCase No. 18-5146  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-JCS   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 3 of 31\n  \n1  both of these precepts.  DOJ is improperly attempting to wield powers that only Congress is entitled to \n2  invoke, and is seeking to compel San Francisco to bend its considered policy judgments, which the \n3  Constitution allows it to make for its community, to the federal government’s will.  \n4  5.  And even if DOJ has the authority to impose some conditions on the FY 2018 Byrne \n5  JAG funds, each of the Challenged Requirements at issue here relating to federal immigration \n6  enforcement would still be unlawful under other constitutional limits.  Those limits prevent DOJ from \n7  requiring compliance with the funding requirements because (1) they leave localities unclear about \n8  how to comply with each of the requirements, and (2) they lack a nexus between the congressionally \n9  mandated purpose of Byrne JAG funds and immigration enforcement.    \n10  6.  San Francisco faces the immediate prospect of losing over $1.4 million in this fiscal \n11  year if it does not receive FY 2018 Byrne JAG funds.  San Francisco uses these funds for a variety of \n12  important law enforcement purposes, including programs designed to reduce recidivism, provide \n13  alternative forms of prosecution, or enable drug treatment for underserved populations. \n14  7.  San Francisco faces an unacceptable choice that is precisely what the Trump \n15  Administration wishes it to have: either comply with DOJ’s unconstitutional new grant conditions and \n16  abandon local policies that San Francisco adopted to promote public safety and foster trust and \n17  cooperation between law enforcement and the public; or, maintain these policies but forfeit critical \n18  funds that it relies on to provide essential services to San Francisco residents.  \n19  8.  San Francisco is not obligated to enforce federal immigration law.  San Francisco seeks \n20  declaratory and injunctive relief to ensure that San Francisco and other sanctuary jurisdictions \n21  continue to be eligible for these funds, instead of being coerced into accepting conditions that on their \n22  face violate bedrock constitutional principles of separation of powers, as well as constitutional \n23  vagueness and germaneness restrictions on grant requirements.  \n24  JURISDICTION AND VENUE  \n25  9.  The Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. Sections 1331 and 1346.  This Court has \n26  further remedial authority under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. Sections 2201(a) and 2202 \n27  et seq.  \n28  // \nComplaint; CCSF v.

Venue properly lies within the Northern District of California because Plaintiff, \n2  San Francisco, resides in this judicial district and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving \n3  rise to this action occurred in this District.  28 U.S.C. §1391(e)(1).     \n4  INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT \n5  11.  Assignment to the San Francisco or Oakland Division of this District is proper pursuant \n6  to Civil Local Rule 3-2(c)-(d) because a substantial part of the acts or omissions that give rise to this \n7  action occurred in the City and County of San Francisco.  \n8  PARTIES \n9  12.  Plaintiff San Francisco is a municipal corporation organized and existing under and by \n10  virtue of the laws of the State of California, and is a charter city and county.  \n11  13.  Defendant Jefferson B. Sessions III is the Attorney General of the United States.  He is \n12  sued in his official capacity.  The Attorney General is the federal official leading the DOJ, which is \n13  responsible for the governmental actions at issue in this lawsuit.   \n14  14.  Defendant Laura L. Rogers is Acting Assistant Attorney General of the United States in \n15  charge of the Office of Justice Programs, which administers Byrne JAG funding.  She is sued in her \n16  official capacity.  \n17  15.  Defendant DOJ is an executive department of the United States of America that is \n18  responsible for administering the Byrne JAG program.   \n19  16.  Doe 1 through Doe 100 are sued under fictitious names.  Plaintiff San Francisco does \n20  not now know the true names or capacities of said Defendants, who were responsible for the alleged \n21  violations, but pray that the same may be alleged in this complaint when ascertained.  \n22  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n23  I.  The Byrne JAG Program Provides Important Criminal Justice Funds To San Francisco. \n24  A.  The Byrne JAG Program. \n25  17.  The Byrne JAG program is “the leading source of federal justice funding to state and \n26  local jurisdictions.”  Office of Justice Programs, Welcome to BJA’s Edward Byrne Memorial \n27  Assistance Grant (JAG) Program, https://www.bja.gov/jag/ (last visited August 20, 2018).  The \n28  program provides state and local governments with “critical funding necessary to support a range of \nComplaint; CCSF v. Sessions   3 N:\\CXLIT\\LI2018\\190133\\01299103.docx \nCase No. 18-5146  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-JCS   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 5 of 31\n  \n1  program areas including law enforcement, prosecution, indigent defense, courts, crime prevention and \n2  education, corrections and community corrections, drug treatment and enforcement, . . . crime victim \n3  and witness initiatives and mental health programs.”  Id. \n4  18.  The program is structured as a formula grant, awarding funds to all eligible grantees \n5  according to a prescribed metric.  Unlike discretionary grants, which agencies award under agency \n6  discretion, “‘formula’ grants . . . are not awarded at the discretion of a state or federal agency, but are \n7  awarded pursuant to a statutory formula.”  City of Los Angeles v. McLaughlin, 865 F.2d 1084, 1088 \n8  (9th Cir. 1989).  Specifically, the Bureau of Justice Assistance (“BJA”)—a department within Office \n9  of Justice Programs (“OJP”)—awards Byrne JAG funds to all eligible grantees in amounts based on \n10  Bureau of Justice Statistics (“BJS”) calculations derived from the Byrne JAG statutory formula.  See \n11  34 U.S.C. § 10156(d)(2)(A) (providing that the Attorney General “shall allocate to each unit of local \n12  government” funds consistent with the established formula) (emphasis added).  \n13  19.  The formula for state allocations is a function of population and violent crime.  See id. \n14  § 10156(a).  For local governments, the allocation is based on the state’s allocation and the ratio of \n15  violent crime in the locality to violent crime in the state.  See id. § 10156(d).  For example, in FY \n16  2018, California’s total allocation is $28.9 million.  Of this, $17.4 million (60 percent) is allocated to \n17  the State (see id. § 10156(b)-(d))—but a minimum of 62.9 percent of these funds must be passed \n18  through to local jurisdictions.1  The other $11.6 million (40 percent) is allocated for direct grants to \n19  local jurisdictions.  See id. § 10156(b)-(d).     \n20  20.  Congress imposed only a limited number of requirements on Byrne JAG applicants.   \n21  21.  First, Congress has required applicants to supply information about their intended use \n22  of grant funding, to demonstrate that they will spend the money on programs supporting one of the \n23  eight statutory purpose areas.  See 34 U.S.C. § 10153(a)(2) & (a)(5)(A)-(C).  Those purpose areas are: \n24  (1) law enforcement, (2) prosecution and courts, (3) prevention and education, (4) corrections and \n25 \n                                                 \n26  1 U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program \nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)–Updated August 2017, at 2, \n27  https://www.bja.gov/Funding/JAGFAQ.pdf; see also U.S. Dep’t of Justice,  FY 2014 Justice \nAssistance Grant (JAG) Program Variable Pass-through (VPT) Percentages, \n28  https://www.bja.gov/Funding/JAGvpt.pdf. \nComplaint; CCSF v. Sessions   4 N:\\CXLIT\\LI2018\\190133\\01299103.docx \nCase No. 18-5146  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-JCS   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 6 of 31\n  \n1  community corrections, (5) drug treatment, (6) planning, evaluation, and technology improvement, (7) \n2  crime victim and witness programs, and (8) mental health programs, including behavioral programs \n3  and crisis intervention.  34 U.S.C. § 10152(a)(1)(A)-(H).  None of these program purposes include \n4  federal immigration enforcement. \n5  22.  Second, Congress requires applicants to maintain and be prepared to report information \n6  demonstrating that they possess programmatic and financial integrity.  Id. § 10153(a)(4).   \n7  23.  Finally, Congress requires applicants to “certif[y]” that they “will comply with all \n8  provisions of this part and all other applicable Federal laws.”  Id. § 10153(a)(5)(D).   \n9  24.  Not one of these requirements relates to immigration.  Indeed, over a decade ago, \n10  Congress removed the only requirement in the Byrne JAG statute that touched on immigration-related \n11  issues.  In 2006, Congress specifically eliminated a funding requirement that recipients make “[a]n \n12  assurance that the State has established a plan under which the State will provide without fee to the \n13  Immigration and Naturalization Service, within 30 days of the date of their conviction, notice of \n14  conviction of aliens who have been convicted of violating the criminal laws of the State and under \n15  which the State will provide the Service with the certified record of such a conviction within 30 days \n16  of the date of a request by the Service for such record.”  42 U.S.C. § 3753(a)(11) (2002). \n17  25.  Given the limited discretion Congress has bestowed upon DOJ under the Byrne JAG \n18  statute for these formula grants, the Attorney General has no authority to withhold or reduce federal \n19  grant funding a state or local government is entitled to receive.  DOJ officials acknowledged as much \n20  in the recent past, when then-Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik wrote a letter to Senator \n21  Richard Shelby regarding the Senator’s request that DOJ tie federal grant funding to federal \n22  immigration priorities.  Kadzik stated that DOJ could not do so because “many Department grant \n23  funds are formula based” such that “the Department does not have the discretion to suspend funding at \n24  all.”2   \n25  // \n26  // \n27                                                   \n2 Defendants’ Administrative Record, City and County of San Francisco v. Sessions, No. 3:17-\n28  cv-4642-WHO (“San Francisco v. Sessions”) (N.D. Cal. Mar. 23, 2018), Dkt. No. 84-2 at AR00113. \nComplaint; CCSF v.

San Francisco Uses Byrne JAG Funding To Support Important City Programs. \n2  26.  The San Francisco Department of Children, Youth and their Families (“DCYF”) \n3  applies for local Byrne JAG funds and state pass-through funds on behalf of the City.  DCYF keeps a \n4  portion of the grant and also administers grant funds to the following departments: the Adult Probation \n5  Department, District Attorney, Public Defender, Police Department, and Sheriff.  DCYF also passes \n6  through funds from the local grant to the San Francisco Superior Court and a third party evaluator. \n7  27.  Before FY 2017, San Francisco received state and local Byrne JAG funds every year \n8  for well over a decade.   \n9  28.  San Francisco submitted its FY 2017 Byrne JAG application on September 5, 2017, but \n10  OJP has not yet taken action on it.3   \n11  29.  San Francisco submitted its FY 2018 Byrne JAG application on August 21, 2018.  \n12  30.  For FY 2018, San Francisco is entitled to a direct Byrne JAG formula grant of \n13  $489,966.  San Francisco also expects to receive a state pass-through of Byrne JAG funds in the \n14  amount of $941,915. \n15  31.  Consistent with the Byrne JAG statute, San Francisco uses its Byrne JAG funds to \n16  support critical law enforcement programs designed to reduce criminal behavior and improve public \n17  safety.  Specific programs funded with this grant include: (1) Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion, an \n18  innovative approach that seeks to accomplish the goals of reduced criminal behavior and improved \n19  public safety by connecting appropriate low-level drug offenders with services; (2) Focused Drug \n20  Deterrence, short and long term proactive activities including targeted investigations and enforcement \n21  and social network analysis to increase the identification of individuals involved in high-level drug \n22  markets; (3) Drug Court Prosecution, which seeks to connect criminal defendants who suffer from a \n23 \n                                                 \n24  3 DOJ has, on information and belief, awarded FY 2017 Byrne JAG grants to hundreds of other \njurisdictions—“jurisdictions that share the Department’s commitment to keeping criminal aliens off \n25  our streets and our law abiding citizens safe.”  Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Justice, DOJ Releases \nFY17 JAG Funding (June 27, 2018) \n26  https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDOJOJP/bulletins/1fa6e57.  DOJ has stated that \n“[r]eviews of some applications remain ongoing.”  Id.  In litigation, DOJ has stated that it is \n27  withholding FY 2017 Byrne JAG awards from states and localities, like San Francisco, whose \ncompliance with Section 1373 is under review.  Decl. of Marilyn Atsatt at ¶¶ 3-4, San Francisco v. \n28  Sessions, Dkt. No. 113-3.  \nComplaint; CCSF v. Sessions   6 N:\\CXLIT\\LI2018\\190133\\01299103.docx \nCase No. 18-5146  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-JCS   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 8 of 31\n  \n1  substantial substance abuse problem to treatment services in the community in order to enhance public \n2  safety, reduce recidivism, and find appropriate dispositions to the criminal charges; (4) Targeted Drug \n3  Treatment for Underserved Populations, a treatment intervention conducted by the Sheriff’s \n4  Department for individuals in custody; (5) Intensive Probation Supervision, a targeted caseload of \n5  probationers with substance abuse and/or mental health issues; (6) Reentry Social Work through the \n6  Public Defender’s Office, which provides legal and wraparound support to help indigent clients \n7  charged with felony drug cases and other felony offenses successfully exit the criminal justice system; \n8  and (7) Citywide Justice-Involved Youth Planning, which examines current criminal justice trends \n9  impacting youth and young adults and strengthens partnerships and collaboration at various levels to \n10  create a continuum of support for youth and young adults. \n11  32.  San Francisco uses Byrne JAG pass-through funds to support a Young Adult Court \n12  aimed at reducing recidivism for youth ages 18-25.  This Court was designed in response to a growing \n13  body of neuroscience research showing that young adults are fundamentally different from both \n14  juveniles and older adults in how they process information and make decisions.  Our traditional justice \n15  system is not well-equipped to address cases involving these individuals, who are qualitatively \n16  different in development, skills, and needs from both children and older adults.  The Young Adult \n17  Court fills this gap by providing case management and other support for eligible young adult offenders \n18  from high-risk backgrounds. \n19  33.  These City programs span six departments, and a total of approximately ten full-time \n20  equivalent positions for these programs are funded with Byrne JAG funds.  Without local and state \n21  Byrne JAG funds, San Francisco could be forced to reduce or eliminate these programs, including \n22  eliminating staff positions, unless other funding sources could be identified. \n23 \nII.  The Trump Administration Has Engaged In Ongoing Attempts To Coerce Sanctuary \nJurisdictions To Change Their Policies By Threatening To Withhold Federal Funding.   \n24 \n25  34.  Despite the Byrne JAG program being a formula grant—which means that Congress \n26  alone can decide who receives federal funding, and how much—and in disregard of the important \n27  local purposes that Byrne JAG funding serves, President Trump’s Administration has engaged in a \n28  longstanding campaign to unlawfully withhold federal funding from so-called sanctuary jurisdictions.  \nComplaint; CCSF v. Sessions   7 N:\\CXLIT\\LI2018\\190133\\01299103.docx \nCase No. 18-5146  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-JCS   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 9 of 31\n  \n1  The Attorney General has furthered this effort by adding an ever-expanding set of immigration-related \n2  requirements to Byrne JAG funding.  These requirements are designed to coerce state and local \n3  jurisdictions to participate in enforcing federal immigration law and abandon any state or local policies \n4  that limit or prohibit such participation.  That is, the requirements aim to eradicate sanctuary cities, \n5  consistent with President Trump’s longstanding threats. \n6  A.  President Trump First Attempted To Act By Executive Fiat.  \n7  35.  San Francisco is one of many jurisdictions across the country that has enacted sanctuary \n8  policies that seek to promote public safety locally and build trusting and supportive relationships with \n9  immigrant communities.  Many jurisdictions believe—and studies have shown4—that communities are \n10  stronger, healthier, and safer when state and local employees decline to participate in the federal \n11  government’s responsibility to enforce federal immigration law.  \n12  36.  Nevertheless, the Trump Administration has made it their mission to eradicate \n13  sanctuary cities.  President Trump frequently promised to “defund” sanctuary cities, and to use the \n14  threat of withholding federal funds as “a weapon” to coerce local jurisdictions to change their \n15  policies.5  Shortly after President Trump took office, his press secretary confirmed that “[w]e are going \n16  to strip federal grant money from the sanctuary states and cities that harbor illegal immigrants.  The \n17  American people are no longer going to have to be forced to subsidize this disregard for our laws.”6  \n18  37.  The Attorney General echoed this position.  Soon after taking office, the Attorney \n19  General suggested that he would use every means necessary to withhold federal funding from \n20  “sanctuary cities.”7  He has broadly described sanctuary city “policies” as those requiring local law \n                                                 \n21 \n4 See Tom K.

The Administration tried to carry through on these threats during President Trump’s \n4  first week in office.  President Trump issued Executive Order 13,768, which called for denying all \n5  federal funding to sanctuary jurisdictions and further authorized the Attorney General to take \n6  unspecified enforcement action against sanctuary cities.   \n7  39.  The Administration touted the Executive Order as a means to achieving the President’s \n8  goal of “ending sanctuary cities . . . .  [T]he President has been very clear through his executive order \n9  that federal funds, paid for by hardworking taxpayers, should not be used to help fund sanctuary \n10  cities.”9  The Administration vowed that “the President is going to do everything he can within the \n11  scope of the executive order to make sure that cities who don’t comply with it—counties and other \n12  institutions that remain sanctuary cities don’t get federal government funding in compliance with the \n13  executive order.”10  \n14  40.  The Administration’s efforts here were stopped by a court in this district, which \n15  permanently enjoined Section 9(a) of the Executive Order for violating the Constitution.  City and \n16  County of San Francisco v. Donald J. Trump, 275 F. Supp. 3d 1196, 1219 (N.D. Cal. 2017).  The court \n17  held, inter alia, that the President—and in turn, the Attorney General and the Secretary of DHS—\n18  lacked the authority “to place a new condition on federal funds . . . not authorized by Congress,” and \n19  thus had violated the “fundamental constitutional structure” of the separation of powers.  Id. at 1213.  \n20  And the court further held that even if the executive branch could exercise that spending power, the \n21  Executive Order was unconstitutional because it (1) used vague language that left localities unclear \n22 \n                                                 \n23  8 Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Attorney General Jeff Sessions Delivers Remarks in Las \nVegas to Federal, State and Local Law Enforcement About Sanctuary Cities and Efforts to Combat \n24  Violent Crime (July 12, 2017), https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-jeff-sessions-\ndelivers-remarks-las-vegas-federal-state-and-local-law. \n25 \n9 Press Release, The White House, Office of the Press Secretary, Press Briefing by Press \nSecretary Sean Spicer, 2/1/2017, #6 (Feb. 1, 2017), https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-\n26 \nstatements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-020117/. \n27  10 Press Release, The White House, Office of the Press Secretary, Press Briefing by Press \nSecretary Sean Spicer, 2/8/2017, #10 (Feb. 8, 2017), https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-\n28  statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-020817/. \nComplaint; CCSF v.

Id. at 1214–16.   \n4  41.  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld substantially all of the district court’s order.  \n5  City and County of San Francisco v. Trump, No. 17-17478, 2018 WL 3637911 (9th Cir. Aug. 1, \n6  2018).  The Ninth Circuit affirmed that “[t]he Separation of Powers was an integral part of the \n7  Founders’ design.”  Id. at *2.  And it found that “the Administration has not even attempted to show \n8  that Congress authorized it to withdraw federal grant moneys from jurisdictions that do not agree with \n9  the current Administration’s immigration strategies.”  Id. at *4.  It therefore upheld the district court’s \n10  judgment in favor of San Francisco on the merits.  Id.  The Ninth Circuit remanded the cases for \n11  additional factual findings about the proper scope of relief.  Id. at *13. \n12 \nB.  The Attorney General Unilaterally Imposes Immigration-Related Requirements \nOn The FY 2017 Byrne JAG Program. \n13 \n14  42.  With its initially broad efforts to withhold federal funds to sanctuary cities put in check \n15  by the courts, the Administration adopted a more targeted approach focusing on the Byrne JAG \n16  program and similar grant programs that DOJ administers.  As relevant here, the Attorney General \n17  unilaterally imposed three new immigration-related requirements on the 2017 Byrne JAG awards—\n18  requirements designed to coerce Byrne JAG recipients into enforcing federal immigration law. \n19  43.  First, the FY 2017 Byrne JAG Local Solicitation provided that OJP would require \n20  grant applicants to “provide at least 48 hours’ advance notice to DHS regarding the scheduled release \n21  date and time of an alien in the jurisdiction’s custody when DHS requests such notice in order to take \n22  custody of the alien under the Immigration and Nationality Act.”  FY 2017 Local Solicitation at 30 \n23  (attached as Exh. 1).   \n24  44.  In the FY 2017 award documents that DOJ eventually issued, DOJ expanded on this \n25  requirement (the “FY 2017 Notice Requirement”), explaining that: \nA State statute, or a State rule, -regulation, -policy, or –practice, must be in place that is \n26 \ndesigned to ensure that, when a State (or State-contracted) correctional facility receives \nfrom DHS a formal written request authorized by the Immigration and Nationality Act \n27 \nthat seeks advance notice of the scheduled release date and time for a particular alien in  \n \n28 \nComplaint; CCSF v. Sessions   10 N:\\CXLIT\\LI2018\\190133\\01299103.docx \nCase No. 18-5146  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-JCS   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 12 of 31\n  \n \n1  such facility, then such facility will honor such request and—as early as practicable \n(see para. 4.B. of this condition)—provide the requested notice to DHS. \n2   \n3  Decl. of Alan Hanson at ¶¶ 5-6 & Exh. B at 18, San Francisco v. Sessions, Dkt. No. 46-1 (“Hanson \n4  Decl.”).  \n5  45.  Second, the FY 2017 Local Solicitation provided that OJP would require grant \n6  applicants to “permit personnel of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to access any \n7  correctional or detention facility in order to meet with an alien (or an individual believed to be an \n8  alien) and inquire as to his or her right to be or remain in the United States.”  FY 2017 Local \n9  Solicitation at 30 (attached as Exh. 1). \n10  46.  In the FY 2017 award documents, DOJ described this requirement regarding access to \n11  correctional facilities (the “FY 2017 Access Requirement”) as requiring that: \nA State statute, or a State rule, -regulation, -policy, or –practice, must be in \n12 \nplace that is designed to ensure that agents of the United States acting under \ncolor of federal law in fact are given to access any State (or State-\n13 \ncontracted) correctional facility for the purpose of permitting such agents to \nmeet with individuals who are (or are believed by such agents to be) aliens \n14 \nand to inquire as to such individuals’ right to be or remain in the United \nStates. \n15 \n16  Hanson Decl. at ¶¶ 5-6 & Exh. B at 18. \n17  47.  Third, DOJ stated that it would require jurisdictions to certify their compliance with \n18  8 U.S.C. Section 1373, which provides that a “local government entity or official may not prohibit, or \n19  in any way restrict, any government entity or official from sending to, or receiving from, [federal \n20  immigration officials] information regarding the citizenship or immigration status . . . of any \n21  individual.”  8 U.S.C. § 1373(a).  Although DOJ’s move toward requiring jurisdictions to certify \n22  compliance with this section had been in progress since 2016, it was not until the FY 2017 Byrne JAG \n23  application that DOJ expressly applied this requirement (the “FY 2017 Section 1373 Requirement”) to \n24  all jurisdictions.   \n25  48.  Critically, since the Trump Administration has come into office, DOJ has declared that \n26  it interprets Section 1373 much more broadly than local jurisdictions like San Francisco could have \n27  previously imagined—specifically, that it reads “information regarding the citizenship or immigration \n28  status” to include all information that would assist federal immigration authorities to determine a \nComplaint; CCSF v. Sessions   11 N:\\CXLIT\\LI2018\\190133\\01299103.docx \nCase No. 18-5146  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-JCS   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 13 of 31\n  \n1  person’s immigration status and take that individual into custody, if appropriate.11  (The FY 2017 \n2  Section 1373 Requirement, FY 2017 Notice Requirement, and FY 2017 Access Requirements are \n3  referred to collectively as the “FY 2017 Requirements.”) \n4  49.  DOJ claimed that two different general statutory provisions gave the Attorney General \n5  the authority to impose these FY 2017 Requirements on Byrne JAG recipients.  DOJ claimed that 34 \n6  U.S.C. § 10153(a)(5)(D), which requires Byrne JAG grant recipients to certify that they “will comply \n7  with all provisions of this part and all other applicable Federal laws” (see ¶ 23, supra), allowed the \n8  Attorney General to require that grant recipients comply with Section 1373.  Defs.’ Mot. for Summ. J. \n9  at 17-18, San Francisco v. Sessions, Dkt. No. 113.  \n10  50.  DOJ took a different approach with respect to the FY 2017 Notice and Access \n11  Requirements.  DOJ did not argue that either Requirement stemmed from an existing statutory \n12  obligation, and thus did not assert that Section 10153(a)(5)(D)’s “all applicable laws” language \n13  allowed the Attorney General to impose them.  Instead, DOJ relied on a different statutory provision, \n14  34 U.S.C. § 10102(a)(6)—which allows the Assistant Attorney General overseeing OJP to “exercise \n15  such other powers and functions as may be vested in [him or her] pursuant to this chapter or by \n16  delegation of the Attorney General, including placing special conditions on all grants, and determining \n17  priority purposes for formula grants.”  See Defs.’ Mot. for Summ. J. at 9-14 San Francisco v. Sessions, \n18  Dkt. No. 113.  DOJ asserted that the FY 2017 Notice and Access Requirements were special \n19  conditions covered by this provision. \n20  51.  The new FY 2017 Requirements elicited a wave of legal challenges, and several courts \n21  have already struck them down—indeed to date all the federal courts that have considered those \n22  requirements have found them unlawful.  See City of Chicago v. Sessions, 888 F.3d 272, 276 (7th Cir. \n23  2018) (invalidating FY 2017 Notice and Access Requirements); see also City of Philadelphia v. \n24  Sessions, 309 F. Supp. 3d 289, 321 (E.D. Pa. 2018) (striking down all three FY 2017 Requirements); \n25 \n26 \n                                                 \n27  11 Defs.’ Mot. for Summ. J. at 26, San Francisco v. Sessions, Dkt.

Various other lawsuits challenging the FY 2017 Requirements remain pending12 —\n4  including San Francisco’s lawsuit currently pending in this district.13    \n5  III.  The Attorney General Imposes New Requirements On FY 2018 Byrne JAG Recipients. \n6  53.  Now that its previous efforts to withhold federal grant funds have been held unlawful \n7  by courts around the country, President Trump’s Administration is trying another approach to turn the \n8  Byrne JAG program into a weapon against sanctuary jurisdictions.   \n9  54.  On July 20, 2018, DOJ announced that it would impose a number of immigration-\n10  related conditions on jurisdictions seeking 2018 Byrne JAG funding.14   \n11  55.  Some of these new requirements are little more than a dressed up version of the \n12  Administration’s earlier efforts: The 2018 Local Solicitation includes a Section 1373 Requirement that \n13                                                   \n12 State of California v. Sessions, No. 17-CV-4701 (N.D. Cal. filed Aug. 14, 2017); City of \n14  Evanston v. Sessions, No. 18-cv-4853 (N.D. Ill. filed July 16, 2018), City of Los Angeles v. Sessions, \nNo.2:17-cv-07215-R-JCx (C.D. Cal. filed Sept. 29, 2018); City of New York v. Sessions, No. 18-cv-\n15  06474 (S.D.N.Y. filed July 18, 2018); State of Illinois v.

Sessions, No. 3:17-cv-04642 (N.D. Cal filed Aug. 11, 2017).  San \n17 \nFrancisco’s First Amended Complaint in that lawsuit challenges DOJ’s authority to impose the three \nFY 2017 Requirements.  The district court has already denied DOJ’s efforts to dismiss the case.  Order \n18 \nDen. Mot. to Dismiss, San Francisco v. Sessions, Dkt. No. 78.  Cross-motions for summary judgment \nare currently pending in that case, and are presently scheduled to be heard on September 5, 2018.  In \n19 \nits Motion for Summary Judgment, San Francisco seeks a declaratory judgment that the three FY 2017 \nRequirements are unlawful, as well as a permanent injunction prohibiting DOJ from imposing those \n20 \nRequirements on any current or future Byrne JAG awards.  City and Cty. of S.F.’s Notice of Mot. and \nMot. for Summ. J., San Francisco v. Sessions, Dkt. No. 99. \n21 \n14 DOJ has also announced that it will impose similar grant requirements on a number of other \n22  public safety grants, including (1) Supporting Innovation: Field-Initiated Programs to Improve Officer \nand Public Safety; (2) Justice Accountability Initiative: Pilot Projects Using Data-driven Systems to \n23  Reduce Crime; (3) Gang Suppression Planning: Build Capacity for a Multilateral Data-Driven \nStrategy to Promote Public Safety; and (4) A Law Enforcement and Prosecutorial Approach To \n24  Address Gang Recruitment of Unaccompanied Alien Children program.

In the course of announcing those new requirements, the Attorney General stated that they are \ndesigned to “encourage these ‘sanctuary’ jurisdictions to change their policies that undermine public \n28  safety.”  Id. \nComplaint; CCSF v. Sessions   13 N:\\CXLIT\\LI2018\\190133\\01299103.docx \nCase No. 18-5146  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-JCS   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 15 of 31\n  \n1  is virtually indistinguishable from the FY 2017 version—even though that Certification has now been \n2  held invalid by multiple courts.  See ¶ 51, supra.  And it includes repackaged efforts to require \n3  jurisdictions to provide notice of an inmate’s release and access to correctional facilities when \n4  immigration officials request it—requirements that DOJ now attempts to tie to a statutory obligation, \n5  despite its inability to do so over the previous year of litigation regarding the FY 2017 Notice and \n6  Access Requirements. \n7  56.  But other new FY 2018 Requirements go much further.  DOJ has added several new \n8  requirements that imply that sanctuary jurisdictions interfere with various federal laws and \n9  regulations—even though those laws and regulations impose no obligations whatsoever on states and \n10  local jurisdictions.  And they further suggest that sanctuary jurisdictions may violate federal criminal \n11  laws simply by having laws that limit entanglement with federal immigration policies.  This is a \n12  considerable escalation in the level of the threat the Trump Administration has sought to achieve.   \n13  57.  Each of these FY 2018 Requirements is unlawful because DOJ lacks the statutory \n14  authority to impose it.  And even if DOJ had that authority, constitutional limits would still prevent it \n15  from requiring compliance with these particular conditions.   \n16  A.  The FY 2018 Section 1373 Requirement. \n17  58.  Although multiple courts have found the FY 2017 Section 1373 Requirement invalid, \n18  DOJ is attempting to impose a virtually identical requirement on 2018 Byrne JAG funds.15  See FY \n19  2018 Local Solicitation at 36 (attached as Exh. 2). \n20  59.  As it did for FY 2017, DOJ is requiring San Francisco to certify that, as to the “program \n21  or activity” funded with Byrne JAG dollars, San Francisco does not have in effect, purport to have in \n22  effect, or is subject to or bound by “any prohibition or any restriction . . . that deals with either (1) a \n23  government entity or –official sending or receiving information regarding citizenship or immigration \n24                                                   \n15 The FY 2018 Section 1373 Requirement differs from the FY 2017 version in only two ways.  \n25  First, the FY 2018 Section 1373 Requirement also requires that Byrne JAG recipients certify that they \ndo not violate 8 U.S.C. § 1644 (“Section 1644”), which imposes identical obligations to those that \n26  Section 1373 itself mandates.  FY 2018 Local Solicitation at 36 (attached as Exh. 2); see also id. at 42 \n(attached as Exh. 2).  Second, the FY 2018 Section 1373 Requirement demands that jurisdictions \n27  seeking to accept a FY 2018 Byrne JAG award provide OJP with “[i]nformation regarding \nCommunications with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and/or Immigration and Customs \n28  Enforcement (ICE).”  FY 2018 Local Solicitation at 27 (attached as Exh. 2). \nComplaint; CCSF v.

Although a FY 2018 Byrne JAG applicant is not required to execute the Section 1373 \n6  Certification to apply for a FY 2018 Byrne JAG award, OJP has stated that an applicants will be \n7  unable to accept an award until the certification is completed and received by OJP.  FY 2018 Local \n8  Solicitation at 27 (emphasis added) (attached as Exh. 2). \n9  61.  San Francisco has already challenged the legality of the FY 2017 Section 1373 \n10  Requirement in San Francisco v. Sessions.  Id., First Am. Compl. at ¶¶ 78-93, 177-192, Dkt. No. 61.  \n11  San Francisco has sought relief that would enjoin Defendants from imposing the requirement on “any \n12  Byrne JAG awards” and would declare the requirement unconstitutional.  Id. at 41-42 (emphasis \n13  added).  San Francisco’s pending motion for summary judgment seeks a permanent nationwide \n14  injunction on this issue.  City and Cty. of S.F.’s Notice of Mot. and Mot. for Summ. J. at 1, San \n15  Francisco v. Sessions, Dkt. No. 99. \n16  62.  Because the legality of DOJ’s attempts to require jurisdictions to certify compliance \n17  with Section 1373 is already the subject of pending litigation between the parties, San Francisco is not \n18  now bringing a separate challenge to the FY 2018 Section 1373 Requirement in this case.  But San \n19  Francisco reserves its right to seek to amend this Complaint later to add a challenge to the FY 2018 \n20  Section 1373 Requirement as appropriate.  The focus of this case is on the other immigration-related \n21  conditions. \n22  B.  The Section 1226 (Notice) Requirement. \n23  63.  OJP has also stated that it will require Byrne JAG recipients to make certifications \n24  related to a host of other federal laws contained in the Immigration and Nationality Act.  Specifically, \n25  Byrne JAG applicants’ Chief Legal Officer will have to execute a document called “Local \n26  Government: FY 2018 Certification Relating to 8 U.S.C. §§ 1226(a) & (c), 1231(a)(4), 1324(a), \n27  1357(a) & 1366(1) & (3)” (hereafter, “Immigration-Related Certification”).

A FY 2018 Byrne JAG applicant is not required to submit the Immigration-Related \n4  Certification in order to apply for a FY 2018 Byrne JAG award.

Among other things, the Immigration-Related Certification requires the Chief Legal \n9  Officer—in San Francisco’s case, City Attorney Dennis J. Herrera—to certify that San Francisco has \n10  no policies or practices that would or do impede federal officers’ exercise of authority relating to 8 \n11  U.S.C. Section 1226.  Specifically,  City Attorney Herrera has to certify:  \n12  a.  that he has conducted a “careful[] review[]” of Section 1226;  \n13  b.  that he has conducted (or caused to be conducted) a diligent inquiry and review \n14  of “the ‘program or activity’ to be funded (in whole or in part) with the federal financial assistance \n15  sought by the applicant entity under this FY 2018 OJP Program” as well as “any laws, rules, policies, \n16  or practices . . . that implicate any of the requirements related to” Section 1226; and   \n17  c.  that, as to the “program or activity” funded with Byrne JAG dollars, San \n18  Francisco does not have in effect or purport to have in effect, and is not subject to or bound by, “any \n19  law, rule, policy, or practice . . . that would or does . . . impede the exercise by federal officers of \n20  authority relating to 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a) & (c).”  (Together, these are referred to in this Complaint as \n21  “Section 1226 Requirement.”) \n22  66.  The Section 1226 Requirement appears to be nothing more than a repackaged version \n23  of the FY 2017 Notice Requirement, which DOJ now for the first time attempts to connect to a \n24  statutory provision. \n25  67.  Section 1226 authorizes arresting and detaining certain undocumented immigrants, and \n26  provides that the federal government “shall take into custody” certain criminal aliens “when the alien \n27  is released, without regard to whether the alien is released on parole, supervised release, or probation . \n28  . . .”  8 U.S.C. § 1226(a) & (c)(1); see also FY 2018 Local Solicitation at 47 (attached as Exh. 2).   \nComplaint; CCSF v. Sessions   16 N:\\CXLIT\\LI2018\\190133\\01299103.docx \nCase No. 18-5146  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-JCS   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 18 of 31\n  \n1  68.  Section 1226’s terms apply solely to the federal government—indeed, solely to the \n2  Attorney General himself.  It does not impose any obligations whatsoever on local governments.     \n3  69.  Nonetheless, OJP is attempting to use it as a hook to require state and local jurisdictions \n4  to provide notice to DHS regarding the scheduled release date and time of an alien in the jurisdiction’s \n5  custody.   \n6  70.  In the body of the FY 2018 Local Solicitation, OJP has given one example of conduct \n7  that it believes “impedes” federal officials’ exercise of their duties under Section 1226.  OJP states that \n8  grant recipients will be required to not “impede” the exercise of the authority of the federal \n9  government under Section 1226 “specifically by requiring such recipients to provide (where feasible) \n10  at least 48 hours’ advance notice to DHS regarding the scheduled release date and time of an alien in \n11  the recipient’s custody when DHS requests such notice in order to take custody of the alien pursuant to \n12  the Immigration and Nationality Act.”  FY 2018 Local Solicitation at 36-37 (emphasis added) \n13  (attached as Exh. 2). \n14  71.  DOJ lacks the authority to impose the Section 1226 Requirement on Byrne JAG \n15  recipients.  Nothing in the Byrne JAG statute—or any other federal law—gives the Attorney General \n16  the authority to impose this condition. \n17  72.  Furthermore, the Section 1226 Requirement is ambiguous as to what jurisdictions must \n18  do to be in compliance.  Although OJP offers one example of what it might mean to “impede” federal \n19  officials in performing their duties under Section 1226, San Francisco has no way to know whether \n20  OJP might consider other practices to so “impede” the federal government.  This is particularly true \n21  given that OJP’s example of what jurisdictions must do to avoid impeding the Attorney General’s \n22  performance of his Section 1226 duties is far afield from anything that provision itself requires.   \n23  73.  Indeed, even the example OJP gives is itself ambiguous.  For example, DOJ’s request \n24  for 48 hours’ advance notice does not explain whether notice must be given only when the scheduled \n25  release date and time is known at least 48 hours in advance, or whether it requires jurisdictions to hold \n26  inmates in custody for additional time to provide a full 48-hour period of notice to ICE.  Actual release \n27  dates and time often deviate from scheduled release dates and times. \n28 \nComplaint; CCSF v.

Also, the Section 1226 Requirement is not germane to the purposes of the Byrne JAG \n2  program.  Section 1226 is a federal civil immigration requirement that has nothing to do with local \n3  criminal justice, or with any of the other purposes of the Byrne JAG program. \n4  C.  The Section 1231 (Notice) Requirement. \n5  75.  The Immigration-Related Certification appears to require local jurisdictions to make a \n6  certification related to 8 U.S.C. §1231(a)(4) (“Section 1231 Requirement”).   \n7  76.  In the header to the Immigration-Related Certification, OJP states that it is a \n8  “Certification Relating to 8 U.S.C. §§ 1226(a) & (c), 1231(a)(4), 1324(a), 1357(a) & 1366(1) & (3).”  \n9  Exh. 3. \n10  77.  Furthermore, the Chief Legal Officer must certify that she or he has “carefully \n11  reviewed” Section 1231(a)(4) (id.), which provides that the federal government—specifically, the \n12  Attorney General—“may not remove an alien who is sentenced to imprisonment until the alien is \n13  released from imprisonment” (8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(4)(A)). \n14  78.  And in the body of the FY 2018 Local Solicitation, OJP refers to Section 1231 and \n15  states that grant recipients will be required to agree “[n]ot to impede the exercise of the authority of \n16  the federal government under . . . [Section 1226 and] 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(4) (relating to removal from \n17  the United States of aliens after detention/confinement at the federal, state, and local level), \n18  specifically by requiring such recipients to provide (where feasible) at least 48 hours’ advance notice \n19  to DHS regarding the scheduled release date and time of an alien in the recipient’s custody when DHS \n20  requests such notice in order to take custody of the alien pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality \n21  Act.”  FY 2018 Local Solicitation at 36-37 (attached as Exh. 2). \n22  79.  But the Immigration-Related Certification contains no other substantive references to \n23  Section 1231.  The Immigration-Related Certification—as it appears in the Local Solicitation—does \n24  not require the Chief Legal Officer to certify that he or she has reviewed “any laws, rules, policies, or \n25  practices potentially applicable to the ‘program or activity’ sought to be funded under the FY 2018 \n26  OJP Program” that “implicate” Section 1231.  Exh. 3 (¶ 5).  Nor does the Certification require the \n27  Chief Legal Officer to certify that, as to the “program or activity” funded with Byrne JAG dollars, San \n28 \nComplaint; CCSF v.

Id. (¶ 6).   \n3  80.  Like the Section 1226 Requirement discussed above (see ¶¶ 63-76, supra), the Section \n4  1231 Requirement appears to be nothing more than a repackaged version of the FY 2017 Notice \n5  Requirement.  And it fails for the same reasons.  Id. \n6  D.  The Section 1357 (Access) Requirement. \n7  81.  The Immigration-Related Certification also requires Byrne JAG recipients to make \n8  assurances “relating to” 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a).  It requires the Chief Legal Officer to certify that San \n9  Francisco has no policies or practices that would or do impede federal officers’ exercise of authority \n10  relating to Section 1357.  Specifically, the City Attorney Herrera will have to certify:  \n11  a.  that he has conducted a “careful[] review[]” of Section 1357;  \n12  b.  that he has conducted (or caused to be conducted) a diligent inquiry and review \n13  of “the ‘program or activity’ to be funded (in whole or in part) with the federal financial assistance \n14  sought by the applicant entity under this FY 2018 OJP Program” as well as “any laws, rules, policies, \n15  or practices . . . that implicate any of the requirements related to” Section 1357; and   \n16  c.  that, as to the “program or activity” funded with Byrne JAG dollars, San \n17  Francisco does not have in effect or purport to have in effect, and is not subject to or bound by, “any \n18  law, rule, policy, or practice . . . that would or does . . . impede the exercise by federal officers of \n19  authority under 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a).”  (Together, these are referred to in this Complaint as the “Section \n20  1357 Requirement.”) \n21  82.  The Section 1357 Requirement appears to be nothing more than a repackaged version \n22  of the FY 2018 Access Requirement, which DOJ now—for the first time—attempts to connect directly \n23  to a statutory provision rather than to the general authority for “special conditions.” \n24  83.  Section 1357 provides, inter alia, that “[a]ny officer or employee of the [federal] \n25  Service . . . shall have power without warrant to interrogate any alien or person believed to be an alien \n26  as to his right to be or to remain in the United States.”  8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(1); see also FY 2018 Local \n27  Solicitation at 50-51 (attached as Exh. 2).  DOJ appears to read this section in conjunction with 8 \n28  C.F.R. § 287.5(a)(1)—which states that an immigration officer can exercise this interrogation power \nComplaint; CCSF v. Sessions   19 N:\\CXLIT\\LI2018\\190133\\01299103.docx \nCase No. 18-5146  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-JCS   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 21 of 31\n  \n1  “anywhere in or outside the United States”—to mean that immigration officials have a right to \n2  interrogate anyone believed to be an alien any place and any time, without obtaining any form of \n3  warrant.  See FY 2018 Local Solicitation at 37 (attached as Exh. 2). \n4  84.  Section 1357 does not impose any obligations at all on local governments.  Section \n5  1357’s terms apply solely to the federal government—specifically to federal immigration officers and \n6  federal immigration employees.   \n7  85.  Nonetheless, OJP attempts to use it as a hook to require state and local jurisdictions to \n8  permit personnel of the Department of Homeland Security to access any correctional or detention \n9  facility to meet with an alien (or an individual believed to be an alien) and inquire as to his or her right \n10  to be or remain in the United States.  As set forth in the body of the FY 2018 Local Solicitation, OJP \n11  takes the position that restricting immigration officials’ access to suspected aliens in correctional \n12  facilities “impedes” federal officials’ exercise of their duties under Section 1357.  See FY 2018 Local \n13  Solicitation at 37 (attached as Exh. 2).   \n14  86.  DOJ lacks the authority to impose the Section 1357 Requirement on Byrne JAG \n15  recipients.  Nothing in the Byrne JAG statute—or any other federal law—gives the Attorney General \n16  the authority to impose this condition. \n17  87.  And again, the Section 1357 Requirement is ambiguous as to what jurisdictions must \n18  do to be in compliance.  Although OJP offers one example of what it might mean to “impede” federal \n19  officials in performing their Section 1357 duties, San Francisco has no way to know whether OJP \n20  might consider other practices to similarly “impede” the federal government.  This is particularly true \n21  given that OJP’s example of what jurisdictions must do to avoid impeding federal immigration \n22  officers’ performance of their Section 1357 duties is far afield from anything that a plain reading of the \n23  provision would require. \n24  88.  Indeed, even the example OJP gives is itself ambiguous.  For instance, is San Francisco \n25  required to provide access to inmates in custody only when those inmates consent?  Or must the City \n26  compel unwilling inmates to meet with ICE representatives?  Does San Francisco have to allow ICE \n27  agents to use a jail interview room to “access” an uncooperative inmate when ICE wishes and for as \n28  long as its agents wish?  The Section 1357 Requirement does not answer these and similar questions. \nComplaint; CCSF v.

Also, the Section 1357 Requirement is not germane to the purposes of the Byrne JAG \n2  program.  Section 1357 is a federal civil immigration requirement that has nothing to do with local \n3  criminal justice, or with any of the other purposes of the Byrne JAG program. \n4  E.  The Section 1324 Requirement. \n5  90.  The Immigration-Related Certification requires Byrne JAG recipients to make \n6  assurances “relating to” 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a).  Specifically, the Immigration-Related Certification \n7  requires the Chief Legal Officer to certify that, as to the “program or activity” funded with Byrne JAG \n8  dollars, San Francisco does not have in effect or purport to have in effect, and is not subject to or \n9  bound by, “any law, rule, policy, or practice . . . that would or does . . . violate, or aid or abet any \n10  violation of, 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a) (“Section 1324 Requirement”).  Exh. 3. \n11  91.  Section 1324 forbids any “person,” in “knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that \n12  an alien has come to, entered, or remains in the United States in violation of law,” to “conceal[], \n13  harbor[], or shield[] from detection or attempt[] to conceal, harbor, or shield from detection, such alien \n14  in any such place, including any building or any means of transportation” or to “engage in any \n15  conspiracy to commit any of the preceding acts . . . or aid[] or abet[] the commission of any of the \n16  preceding acts.”  8 U.S.C. § 1324(a); see also FY 2018 Local Solicitation at 48-50 (attached as Exh. \n17  2). \n18  92.  DOJ lacks the statutory authority to impose the Section 1324 Requirement on Byrne \n19  JAG recipients.  Nothing in the Byrne JAG statute—nor any other federal law—gives the Attorney \n20  General the authority to impose this condition. \n21  93.  Furthermore, the Section 1324 Requirement is ambiguous as to what jurisdictions must \n22  do to be in compliance.  OJP offers no guidance about what laws, policies, or practices might be \n23  deemed to violate, or aid and abet the violation of, Section 1324.  Beyond citing the statutory \n24  provision itself, OJP offers no guidance in the Local Solicitation about how local jurisdictions could \n25  run afoul of the Section 1324 Requirement.  \n26  94.  But elsewhere members of the Trump Administration have offered exceedingly broad \n27  interpretations of Section 1324—interpretations that could embrace any local policy that limits local \n28  enforcement of federal immigration laws. \nComplaint; CCSF v.

For instance, former ICE acting director Thomas Homan has stated on multiple \n2  occasions that cities with sanctuary laws or policies are, or may be, violating Section 1324. \n3    In a July 27, 2017 interview regarding “sanctuaries,” Homan suggested that sanctuary \n4  cities potentially violate Section 1324:  “I think these sanctuary cities need to make sure \n5  they’re on the right side of the law.  They need to look at this.  Because I am.”16   \n6    In an August 2017 interview, Homan said: “And the third thing I talked to the attorney \n7  general today about was, you know, we need to look at these jurisdictions, are they \n8  crossing a legal line, are they committing a statutory crime by 8 U.S.C. 1324, alien \n9  smuggling?  There’s a part of the law that says that if you harbor, conceal or shield, \n10  knowingly shield an illegal alien from law enforcement, that’s a crime.  So I have asked \n11  the attorney general.  We need to look at this and find out, are these jurisdictions on the \n12  right side of that law?”17 \n13    And as recently as January 2018, Homan suggested that jurisdictions violate Section \n14  1324 simply by having policies that deny federal immigration officials access to \n15  inmates in jails.  Homan stated “we’re going to enforce the law without apology.  What \n16  I’m also doing is working with the Department of Justice.  For these sanctuary cities \n17  that knowingly shield and harbor an illegal alien in their jail and don’t allow us access, \n18  that is, in my opinion, a violation of 8 U.S.C. 1324.  That’s an alien smuggling \n19  statute.”18   \n20  96.  Similarly, the Secretary of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen, has stated that her \n21  department has requested that DOJ “look into” whether elected officials in sanctuary jurisdictions are \n22                                                   \n16 Stephen Dinan, ICE Chief wants to Slap Smuggling Charges on Leaders of Sanctuary Cities, \n23  The Washington Times (July 26, 2017) https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jul/26/thomas-\nhoman-ice-chief-says-immigrant-sanctuaries-/. \n24 \n17 Interview by Trish Regan with U.S. Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director \nThomas Homan, Acting ICE chief: Sanctuary cities put politics above safety, Fox News (Aug. 16, \n25 \n2017) http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2017/08/16/acting-ice-chief-sanctuary-cities-put-politics-\nabove-safety.html. \n26 \n18 Interview by Neil Cavuto with U.S. Acting ICE Director Thomas Homan, Acting ICE \n27  director: California made a foolish decision, Fox News (Jan. 2, 2018), \nhttp://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2018/01/02/acting-ice-director-california-made-foolish-\n28  decision.html. \nComplaint; CCSF v.

These comments suggest DOJ could embrace an expansive reading of Section 1324—a \n4  reading that would view every jurisdiction with any sanctuary law or policy as potentially violating \n5  Section 1324.20  This creates an ambiguity that makes it impossible for San Francisco—and other local \n6  jurisdictions, particularly those with sanctuary policies—to understand what is required to comply \n7  with the Section 1324 Requirement. \n8  98.  As a result of this ambiguity, San Francisco and other local jurisdictions are left with no \n9  specific guidance on how to comply with the Section 1324 Requirement, and a generalized threat that \n10  their sanctuary laws and policies put them at risk not only for a loss of Byrne JAG funds, but also for \n11  criminal penalties.   \n12  99.  Also, the Section 1324 Requirement is not germane to the purposes of the Byrne JAG \n13  program.  Section 1324 is a portion of the federal immigration code that has nothing to do with local \n14  criminal justice, or any of the other purposes of the Byrne JAG program. \n15  F.  The Section 1366 Requirement. \n16  100.  Finally, the Immigration-Related Certification requires local jurisdictions to make \n17  assurances “relating to” 8 U.S.C. § 1366(1) & (3).  Specifically, the Immigration-Related Certification \n18  requires the Chief Legal Officer to certify that, as to the “program or activity” funded with Byrne JAG \n19  dollars, San Francisco does not have in effect or purport to have in effect, and is not subject to or \n20  bound by, “any law, rule, policy, or practice . . . that would or does . . . impede the exercise by federal \n21  officers of authority relating to 8 U.S.C. § 1366(1) & (3)” (“Section 1366 Requirement”).  See Exh. 3. \n                                                 \n22 \n19 Oversight of the United Stated Department of Homeland Security: Before the S. Comm. on \nthe Judiciary, 115th Cong.

San Francisco law \n25  prohibits San Francisco law enforcement officials from detaining an individual who is otherwise \neligible for release from custody on the basis of a civil immigration detainer request issued by the \n26  federal government.  A detainer request is distinct from a criminal warrant, which San Francisco \nhonors consistent with its Sanctuary City Laws.  A detainer request is not issued by a judge based on a \n27  finding of probable cause.  It is simply a request by ICE that a state or local law enforcement agency \nhold individuals after their release date to provide ICE agents extra time to decide whether to take \n28  those individuals into federal custody and then deport them. \nComplaint; CCSF v. Sessions   23 N:\\CXLIT\\LI2018\\190133\\01299103.docx \nCase No. 18-5146  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-JCS   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 25 of 31\n  \n1  101.  Section 1366 requires the Attorney General to submit an annual report to the House and \n2  Senate Judiciary Committees detailing (1) “the number of illegal aliens incarcerated in Federal and \n3  State prisons for having committed felonies,” and (2) the “programs and plans underway in the \n4  Department of Justice to ensure the prompt removal from the United States of criminal aliens subject \n5  to removal.”  8 U.S.C. § 1366(1) & (3); see also FY 2018 Local Solicitation at 51 (attached as Exh. 2). \n6  102.  Again, Section 1366 does not impose any obligations on local governments themselves.  \n7  Section 1366’s terms apply solely to the federal government—specifically to the Attorney General \n8  himself.  It imposes a reporting requirement that only the Attorney General can perform. \n9  103.  And OJP has given local jurisdictions no guidance about what it means to “impede” \n10  federal officials’ exercise of authority relating to Section 1366.  While the body of the FY 2018 Local \n11  Solicitation discusses each other statutory provision (see FY 2018 Local Solicitation at 36-37 (attached \n12  as Exh. 2)), the FY 2018 Local Solicitation contains no other references to Section 1366 beyond those \n13  set forth in the Immigration-Related Certification.   \n14  104.  DOJ lacks the statutory authority to impose the Section 1366 Requirement on Byrne \n15  JAG recipients.  Nothing in the Byrne JAG statute—nor any other federal law—gives the Attorney \n16  General the authority to impose conditions of his choice. \n17  105.  Furthermore, the Section 1366 Requirement is ambiguous as to what jurisdictions must \n18  do to be in compliance.  Again, OJP has given local jurisdictions no guidance about what types of \n19  local laws, policies, or practices impede the Attorney General in the exercise of his Section 1366 \n20  responsibilities.  Accordingly, local jurisdictions can only speculate about what local laws, policies, or \n21  practices the federal government may decide interfere with federal officers’ conduct “relating to” their \n22  obligations under Section 1366.  And this speculation is made all the more difficult by the fact that \n23  Section 1366’s text provides no role for local governments to play in the Attorney General’s reporting \n24  obligations.   \n25  106.  Also, the Section 1366 Requirement is not germane to the purposes of the Byrne JAG \n26  program.  Section 1366 is a federal immigration reporting requirement that has nothing to do with \n27  local criminal justice, or any of the other purposes of the Byrne JAG program. \n28 \nComplaint; CCSF v.

Collectively, the Complaint refers to the Requirements set forth in the Immigration-\n2  Related Certification as the “Challenged FY 2018 Requirements.”  See ¶¶ 63-106, supra. \n3  IV.  San Francisco Faces Immediate Injury From The Challenged FY 2018 Byrne JAG \nRequirements. \n4 \nA.  San Francisco Cannot Certify Compliance With The Immigration-Related \nRequirements Without Changing Its Laws And Policies.  \n5 \n6  108.  San Francisco is unable to execute the Immigration-Related Certification.  San \n7  Francisco’s existing laws and policies prevent it from certifying that it complies with several of the \n8  new requirements that DOJ has imposed.  And as to others, the ambiguity regarding the meaning and \n9  scope of the requirements creates significant uncertainty for San Francisco—uncertainty that makes it \n10  impossible for San Francisco to execute the Immigration-Related Certification. \n11  109.  The San Francisco Sheriff’s Department has policies regarding access to jails for ICE \n12  officials enforcing the civil immigration laws.  Specifically, the Sheriff’s Department policy prohibits \n13  Sheriff’s Department employees from providing ICE agency representatives, or any other individual \n14  conducting civil immigration enforcement, access to inmates in jail, access to SFSD computers, \n15  databases and logs, release dates and times for inmates, and home or work contact information.21   \n16  110.  These policies make it difficult, if not impossible, for San Francisco to comply with the \n17  Section 1357 Requirement, which DOJ interprets to mandate that recipients permit DHS agents to \n18  have unfettered access to inmates in jails.  See ¶¶ 83-88, supra. \n19  111.  Similarly, San Francisco has laws regarding City employees’ authority to provide \n20  advance notification of an individual in custody’s release date.  Specifically, Chapter 12I of San \n21  Francisco’s Administrative Code—part of San Francisco’s Sanctuary City laws—prohibits San \n22  Francisco law enforcement officials from responding to a federal immigration officer’s request for \n23  advance notification of the date and time an individual in San Francisco’s custody is being released, \n24  unless the individual in custody meets certain criteria.  See S.F. Admin. Code § 12I.3(c)-(d).   \n25  112.  This law make it difficult, if not impossible, for San Francisco to comply with the \n26  Section 1226 and Section 1231 Requirements, which DOJ interprets to require that recipients provide \n27                                                   \n21 ICE requests for assistance with criminal investigations are directed to the Sheriff, who \n28  directs any assistance to ICE agents as she deems appropriate. \nComplaint; CCSF v. Sessions   25 N:\\CXLIT\\LI2018\\190133\\01299103.docx \nCase No. 18-5146  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-JCS   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 27 of 31\n  \n1  at least 48 hours’ advance notice regarding the date and time an individual is scheduled to be released \n2  from the San Francisco’s custody.  See ¶¶ 69-73, 78, supra. \n3  113.  Also, ambiguity regarding the meaning and scope of the Section 1324 Requirement \n4  makes it difficult for San Francisco to certify that it complies with the Section 1324 Requirement. \n5  114.  As described above (see ¶¶ 93-97, supra), the Trump Administration has interpreted \n6  Section 1324 broadly to mean that jurisdictions potentially violate Section 1324 simply by having \n7  sanctuary city laws or policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. \n8  115.  San Francisco has such laws and policies that limit cooperation with federal \n9  immigration officials.  San Francisco has been a Sanctuary City since 1989, when it first enacted \n10  ordinances to protect Central American refugees who were escaping violent civil wars in their home \n11  countries and seeking legal protections in the United States.  In addition to the policies described \n12  above, San Francisco’s current Sanctuary City Laws, codified in Chapters 12H and 12I of the San \n13  Francisco Administrative Code, continue to reflect San Francisco’s broad dedication and commitment \n14  to promote public safety, public health, and community integrity.22 \n15  116.  In light of these laws and policies, the Trump Administration’s statements regarding \n16  Section 1324 create a cloud of uncertainty for San Francisco.  San Francisco cannot sign the \n17  Immigration-Related Certification—particularly in light of the penalties that attach to that Certification \n18  (see Exh. 3 (explaining that a “materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement” in the certification \n19  will potentially subject the certifying Chief Legal Officer to criminal prosecution and the applicant \n20  entity to civil penalties and administrative remedies for false claims)—under that cloud of uncertainty. \n21 \n                                                 \n22 These laws serve important public purposes, as the legislative findings set forth in Chapter \n22 \n12I confirm.  The Board of Supervisors has declared: \n23  Fostering a relationship of trust, respect, and open communication between City \nemployees and City residents is essential to the City’s core mission of ensuring \n24  public health, safety, and welfare, and serving the needs of everyone in the \ncommunity, including immigrants.  The purpose of this Chapter 12I, as well as \n25  of Administrative Code Chapter 12H, is to foster respect and trust between law \nenforcement and residents, to protect limited local resources, to encourage \n26  cooperation between residents and City officials, including especially law \nenforcement and public health officers and employees, and to ensure \n27  community security, and due process for all.  \n28  See Section 12I.2. \nComplaint; CCSF v. Sessions   26 N:\\CXLIT\\LI2018\\190133\\01299103.docx \nCase No. 18-5146  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-JCS   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 28 of 31\n  \n1  117.  Likewise, significant ambiguities prevent San Francisco from certifying that it complies \n2  with the Section 1366 Requirement.  DOJ has offered no guidance as to the meaning of that \n3  Requirement.  See ¶ 103, supra.  As a result, San Francisco cannot certify that it complies with that \n4  Requirement, as it has no way to know what the Requirement demands of it. \nB.  The Challenged FY 2018 Requirements Put San Francisco To An Unconstitutional \n5  Choice.  \n6  118.  The Challenged FY 2018 Requirements create an untenable choice for San Francisco, \n7  when it is faced with the decision whether to accept the FY 2018 Byrne JAG award.  San Francisco \n8  must choose between amending its laws and policies to allow it to execute the Immigration-Related \n9  Certification, or forgoing hundreds of thousands of dollars in important criminal justice funding. \n10  119.  As described above, San Francisco cannot sign the Immigration-Related Certification in \n11  light of various ambiguities and potential conflicts with San Francisco’s laws and policies.  If San \n12  Francisco maintains those laws and policies and declines to execute the Immigration-Related \n13  Certification, it will have to forgo direct FY 2018 Byrne JAG funding.  This is because recipients are \n14  required to certify that they comply with all applicable award conditions and execute all necessary \n15  certifications in order to accept a FY 2018 Byrne JAG award.23 \n16  120.  San Francisco will also have to forgo the pass-through grant it expects to receive from \n17  the State of California.  \n18  121.  On information and belief, the State of California has applied for FY 2018 Byrne JAG \n19  funds, or will do so in the near future.  Once the State of California receives Byrne JAG funds, it \n20  issues a request for proposals (“RFP”) for local jurisdictions to apply for pass-through funds.  San \n21  Francisco has applied for, and received, pass-through Byrne JAG funds in the past pursuant to this \n22  RFP process.  But to receive pass-through Byrne JAG funds, San Francisco would be required to \n23  submit assurances that it will comply with all award requirements.   \n24  122.  The loss of this funding will have significant negative impacts on San Francisco.  The \n25  variety of programs that Byrne JAG funding supports will be placed in jeopardy.  San Francisco could \n26                                                   \n23 When it submitted its application for FY 2018 Byrne JAG funding, San Francisco included a \n27  reservation of rights regarding the Challenged FY 2018 Requirements.  San Francisco made clear that \nit was not certifying that it would comply with the Challenged FY 2018 Requirements, and stated that \n28  it was planning to challenge those requirements in litigation. \nComplaint; CCSF v. Sessions   27 N:\\CXLIT\\LI2018\\190133\\01299103.docx \nCase No. 18-5146  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-JCS   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 29 of 31\n  \n1  be forced to reduce or eliminate these programs, and the staff positions they support, unless additional \n2  funding sources could be identified.  \n3  123.  Alternatively, San Francisco could change its local laws and policies to attempt to \n4  comply with the Challenged FY 2018 Requirements—a difficult endeavor given the significant \n5  ambiguities about the scope and meaning of many of those Requirements.   \n6  124.  More significantly, changing its local laws and policies would also harm San Francisco \n7  by forcing it to abandon its considered and constitutionally protected policy judgments.  San \n8  Francisco’s Sanctuary City laws and policies reflect lawmakers’ considered judgment that public \n9  safety, public health, and community cohesion are best served by limiting local employees’ \n10  entanglement with federal immigration priorities to the extent possible under federal law.  By \n11  threatening to withhold funds, DOJ seeks to intrude on San Francisco’s sovereign authority to make \n12  such policy choices. \n13  COUNT ONE:  SEPARATION OF POWERS \n14  125.  Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference each allegation of the prior paragraphs as \n15  if fully set forth herein. \n16  126.  In July 2018, Defendants issued a solicitation seeking applications for the FY 2018 \n17  Byrne JAG program. \n18  127.  San Francisco has applied for the FY 2018 Byrne JAG program. \n19  128.  The FY 2018 Local Solicitation makes clear that jurisdictions wishing to accept 2018 \n20  Byrne JAG funds will have to execute a “Certification Relating to 8 U.S.C. §§ 1226(a) & (c), \n21  1231(a)(4), 1324(a), 1357(a), & 1366(1) & (3).”  This Certification imposes the Challenged FY 2018 \n22  Requirements. \n23  // \n24  // \n25  129.  The Constitution vests Congress with legislative powers, see U.S. Const. art. 1, § 1, and \n26  the spending power, see U.S. Const. art. 1, § 8, cl. 1.  Absent a statutory provision or an express \n27  delegation, only Congress is entitled to attach conditions to federal funds. \n28 \nComplaint; CCSF v. Sessions   28 N:\\CXLIT\\LI2018\\190133\\01299103.docx \nCase No. 18-5146  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-JCS   Document 1   Filed 08/22/18   Page 30 of 31\n  \n1  130.  Congress has not enacted the Challenged FY 2018 Requirements as part of any \n2  statutory scheme. \n3  131.  Congress has not enacted the Challenged FY 2018 Requirements as applicable to Byrne \n4  JAG funds. \n5  132.  Congress has not delegated to Defendants the authority to impose the Challenged FY \n6  2018 Requirements on Byrne JAG funds. \n7  133.  Defendants are unilaterally imposing the Challenged FY 2018 Requirements without \n8  authorization from Congress. \n9  134.  For these reasons, DOJ in imposing the Challenged FY 2018 Requirements \n10  unconstitutionally intrudes upon and usurps powers that belong to Congress, violating principles of \n11  separation of powers. \n12  COUNT TWO:  SPENDING CLAUSE \n13  135.  Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference each allegation of the prior paragraphs as \n14  if fully set forth herein.   \n15  136.  As described above, the Challenged FY 2018 Requirements violate separation of \n16  powers principles because they are not authorized by Congress, expressly or impliedly. \n17  137.  Even if Congress had delegated its authority to impose conditions on Byrne JAG funds, \n18  the Challenged FY 2018 Requirements would violate the Spending Clause by: \n19  a.  imposing conditions that are ambiguous, see Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. \n20  Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981) (“The legitimacy of Congress’ power to legislate under the \n21  spending power . . . rests on whether the State voluntarily and knowingly accepts [Congress’ \n22  conditions]…  There can, of course, be no knowing acceptance if a State is unaware of the conditions \n23  or is unable to ascertain what is expected of it…  [I]f Congress intends to impose a condition on the \n24  grant of federal moneys, it must do so unambiguously.” ); and \n25  b.  imposing conditions that are not germane to the stated purposes of the Byrne \n26  JAG funds, see South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 207 (1987) (“[C]onditions on federal grants \n27  might be illegitimate if they are unrelated ‘to the federal interest in particular national projects or \n28  programs.’”).   \nComplaint; CCSF v.

Declare the Challenged FY 2018 Requirements Defendants have imposed on the Byrne \n4  JAG program unconstitutional; \n5  2.  Permanently enjoin Defendants from using the Challenged FY 2018 Requirements as \n6  funding restrictions for any Byrne JAG awards, now or in the future; \n7  3.

Nos. 25, 29  \n   \n \n19 \nINTRODUCTION \n20 \n  Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (“Byrne JAG”) program funds have \n21 \nbeen the focal point of an ongoing dispute between the federal, state, and local governments for \n22 \nthe past two years.  After President Trump assumed office, he issued an Executive Order \n23 \nannouncing a policy of withholding federal grants from “sanctuary jurisdictions,” which was \n24 \nchallenged by the City and County of San Francisco and the County of Santa Clara.  I granted \n25 \nsummary judgment to prevent the Executive Order from being enforced; the Ninth Circuit \n26 \naffirmed.  City and Cty. of San Francisco v. Trump, 275 F. Supp. 3d 1196 (N.D. Cal. 2017), aff’d \n27 \nin part, vacated in part, remanded sub nom. City and Cty. of San Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d \n28 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-WHO   Document 60   Filed 03/04/19   Page 2 of 31\n \n1  1225 (9th Cir. 2018). \n2  Shortly thereafter, former Attorney General Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III imposed \n3  three new conditions on the receipt of Byrne JAG funding for fiscal year 2017: the access, notice, \n4  and Section 1373 certification conditions.  These conditions required Byrne JAG applicants to \n5  provide Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) with “access” to correctional facilities for \n6  immigration enforcement purposes, “notice” of detainee release dates, and to certify compliance \n7  with 8 U.S.C. § 1373.  California and San Francisco sued the DOJ for withholding their fiscal year \n8  2017 grant funds after they asserted compliance with the new conditions.  I found that the \n9  challenged conditions were unlawful on multiple grounds and held that Section 1373 was \n10  unconstitutional.  City & Cty. of San Francisco v. Sessions, 349 F. Supp. 3d 924, 934 (N.D. Cal. \n11  2018), judgment entered sub nom. California ex rel. Becerra v. Sessions, No. 3:17-CV-04701-\na  12  WHO, 2018 WL 6069940 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 20, 2018). \nrt ni\nur\noo 13    For fiscal year 2018, defendants Acting Attorney General Matthew G. Whitaker and the \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  Department of Justice (collectively, the “DOJ”) continued to include essentially the same fiscal \nstrof \nDict  15  year 2017 challenged conditions as well as two other new conditions.  The additional 2018 \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  conditions require Byrne JAG recipients: (i) not to publicly disclose sensitive federal law \nd Srn \nee 17  enforcement information in an attempt to harbor or shield “fugitives from justice” or “aliens” in \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  violation of federal immigration law (the “nondisclosure condition”); and (ii) to provide \n19  information about the applicant’s laws and policies for purposes of assessing compliance with \n20  Section 1373 (the “information condition”).  \n21    California and San Francisco have sued the DOJ challenging five conditions in the fiscal \n22  year 2018 Byrne JAG Program.  The DOJ filed a partial motion to dismiss or a partial motion for \n23  summary judgment, seeking dismissal or judgment on California’s and San Francisco’s claims \n24  regarding the nondisclosure and information conditions.  The DOJ has preserved its arguments on \n25  the access, notice, and certification conditions from the prior case on fiscal year 2017 funds, which \n26  apply to some of the fiscal year 2018 Byrne JAG funding.  \n27  California and San Francisco responded with their own motions for summary judgment.  \n28  They seek declaratory relief that the challenged conditions are unconstitutional violations of the \n2 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-WHO   Document 60   Filed 03/04/19   Page 3 of 31\n \n1  separation of powers and the Spending Clause of the United States Constitution and to enjoin the \n2  DOJ from enforcing the challenged conditions or withholding Byrne JAG funds based on those \n3  requirements.  California also brings an Administrative Procedure Act claim and seeks mandamus \n4  relief compelling the DOJ to issue California its fiscal year 2018 Byrne JAG awards without the \n5  challenged conditions. \n6  Only the nondisclosure condition raises a substantive concern that I have not addressed, \n7  and it fails for somewhat different reasons than the other conditions.  Left to its core—that local \n8  jurisdictions should not publicize confidential federal law enforcement actions that are disclosed to \n9  local authorities to insure deconfliction and protect local law enforcement and residents—seems \n10  self-evident and reasonable.  But DOJ did not leave it to its core, and instead larded it with broad-\n11  ranging, ambiguous language that would allow DOJ the discretion to coerce local jurisdictions to \na  12  comply with its interpretation of the statutes in dispute in these cases.  The exercise of such \nrt ni\nur\noo 13  discretion is all the more suspect in light of the active litigation over immigration issues between \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  California jurisdictions and the federal government, and the threat made by Administration \nstrof \nDict  15  officials to commence criminal prosecution of California officials who follow that sovereign’s \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  interpretation of the law.  See, e.g., CA Request for Judicial Notice (“RJN”), Ex. F (DHS \nd Srn \nee 17  Secretary Nielsen confirming to the Senate Judiciary Committee that DOJ was “reviewing what \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  avenues might be available” to bring criminal charges against elected officials abiding by \n19  sanctuary policies.). \n20  Accordingly, for the reasons discussed more fully below, I find that (i) the challenged \n21  conditions are ultra vires and violate the separation of powers, (ii) Section 1373 is \n22  unconstitutional, (iii) the Attorney General exceeds the Spending Clause in violation of the United \n23  States Constitution by imposing ambiguous challenged conditions in the fiscal year 2018 Byrne \n24  JAG Program, (iv) the conditions are arbitrary and capricious, (v) California is entitled to the \n25  mandamus relief it seeks, and (vi) a nationwide injunction is warranted but stayed.  California’s \n26  and San Francisco’s motions for summary judgment are granted, and the DOJ’s motions are \n27  denied. \n28   \n3 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-WHO   Document 60   Filed 03/04/19   Page 4 of 31\n \n1  BACKGROUND \n2  I.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n3  A.  The Immigration and Nationality Act \n4  Congress reinforced the Executive Branch’s inherent authority “over the subject of \n5  immigration and the status of aliens” when it passed the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), \n6  8 U.S.C.  § 1101 et seq.  Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 394 (2012).  The INA authorizes \n7  the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) as well as the DOJ and other federal agencies to \n8  enforce the immigration laws.  See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2) (allowing the Attorney General or \n9  Secretary of Homeland Security to order removal of certain classes of immigrants).  It also \n10  contemplates coordination between federal officials and state or local jurisdictions.  See Arizona, \n11  567 U.S. at 411 (“Consultation between federal and state officials is an important feature of the \na  12  immigration system.”).  Various provisions seek to accomplish such coordination and information \nrt ni\nouor 13  sharing when possible.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1252c (authorizing state and local officers to make arrests \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  for unlawful reentry); 8 U.S.C. § 1324(c) (authorizing state and local officers to make arrests for \nstrof \nDict  15  INA violations); 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g) (authorizing state and local officers to perform functions of a \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  federal immigration officer). \nd Srn \nee 17  B.  The Byrne JAG Program \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  The Byrne JAG program is a formula grant program that is administered by the Bureau of \n19  Justice Assistance, a department within the Office of Justice Programs (“OJP”).  See 34 U.S.C. § \n20  10156(d)(2)(A) (stating that “the Attorney General shall allocate to each unit of local government” \n21  funds determined by the established formula).  Grant funding is awarded as a function of \n22  population and violent crime rate.  See 34 U.S.C. § 10156(a).  Eligible grantees are entitled to their \n23  awards so long as their Byrne JAG funds go toward programs in one of eight program areas: (1) \n24  law enforcement, (2) prosecution and court, (3) prevention and education, (4) corrections and \n25  community corrections, (5) drug treatment and enforcement, (6) planning, evaluation, and \n26  technology improvement, (7) crime victim and witness programs, and (8) mental health programs.  \n27  See 34 U.S.C. § 10152(a)(1)(A)–(H).  \n28  Under the formula, California is expected to receive $28.9 million Byrne JAG funds in \n4 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-WHO   Document 60   Filed 03/04/19   Page 5 of 31\n \n1  fiscal year 2018, including $18 million going to the Board of State and Community Corrections \n2  (“BSCC”).  Jolls Decl. ¶ 5.  The BSCC plans to continue using the funds for education and crime \n3  prevention, law enforcement, and court programs, as it has in previous years.  Id. ¶¶ 9–10 \n4  (detailing the types of sub-grants that BSCC has provided in previous years, and the focus on \n5  education and crime prevention programs for the next three-year grant cycle). \n6  San Francisco is expected to receive $489,966 in direct Byrne JAG funding and \n7  approximately $1 million in state sub-grant funding under the formula.  Chyi Decl. ¶ 8, Ex. C.  \n8  San Francisco uses the funding to support law enforcement programs aimed at reducing the drug \n9  trade and recidivism among repeat offenders, and for programs connecting those with substance \n10  and mental health problems to appropriate services.  Id. ¶¶ 10–11, 17.  As in fiscal year 2017, San \n11  Francisco faces the prospect of eliminating approximately ten full-time positions spanning six \na  12  departments without Byrne JAG funding.  Id. ¶¶ 10–19; see also City & Cty. of San Francisco, \nrt ni\nur\noo 13  349 F. Supp. 3d at 936 (discussing San Francisco’s intended uses for JAG funds).  \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  California and San Francisco received their fiscal year 2018 Byrne JAG award documents \nstrof \nDict  15  on November 16, 2018.  See DOJ RJN Exs. C, D.1  Because the award documents contained the \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  challenged conditions at issue in this litigation, California and San Francisco requested and \nd Srn \nee 17  received an extension from the DOJ to accept the awards until 30 days after a Judgment is entered \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  in their respective cases.  Chyi Decl. ¶ 15–16; Sherman Decl. at Ex. 7.  \n19  C.  Fiscal Year 2017 Byrne JAG Program Conditions and Related Litigation \n20  In 2016, the DOJ announced that Section 1373 would be an “applicable law” for the Byrne \n21  JAG Program.  See Admin. Record (“AR”)-384 (SF Dkt. No. 26; CA Dkt. No. 24).  For the \n22  following fiscal year (2017), the Byrne JAG Solicitation formalized the announcement, requiring a \n23 \n                                                 \n1 The parties requested judicial notice of various public records, government documents, or court \n24 \nfilings, whose accuracy and authenticity are not disputed.  Government records such as letters, \nmemos, bulletins, or other reports or statements of public record are judicially noticeable.  See, \n25 \ne.g., Brown v. Valoff, 422 F.3d 926, 933 n.9 (9th Cir. 2005) (taking judicial notice of government \nadministrative bulletin); Fed. R. Evid. 201(b).  Court records from other proceedings are also \n26 \nsusceptible to judicial notice if relevant to this litigation.  See U.S. ex rel. Robinson Rancheria \nCitizens Council v. Borneo, Inc., 971 F.2d 244, 248 (9th Cir. 1992) (holding that a court “may take \n27 \nnotice of proceedings in other courts, both within and without the federal judicial system, if those \nproceedings have a direct relation to matters at issue”).  Thus, the requests for judicial notice are \n28 \nGRANTED.  See SF Dkt. Nos. 27-1, 31, 57; CA Dkt. Nos. 25-1, 29-2, 41-1, 45.   \n5 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-WHO   Document 60   Filed 03/04/19   Page 6 of 31\n \n1  certification of compliance with Section 1373.  AR-994, 1032-33.  The DOJ additionally required \n2  Byrne JAG funding recipients to have policies allowing federal agents “access” to any state or \n3  local government correctional facility, and to provide “notice” of scheduled release dates for non-\n4  citizens in those facilities.  AR-1687–88. \n5  I found, along with every court to hear challenges to the fiscal year 2017 Byrne JAG \n6  conditions, that these conditions were unlawful.  See City & Cty. of San Francisco, 349 F. Supp. \n7  3d at 940–41 (summarizing related litigation at the time concerning the fiscal year 2017 Byrne \n8  JAG conditions); see also City of Chicago v. Sessions, 888 F.3d 272, 293 (7th Cir. 2018) \n9  (invalidating notice and access conditions); City of Philadelphia v. Sessions, 309 F. Supp. 3d 289 \n10  (E.D. Pa. 2018) (invalidating the notice, access, and Section 1373 certification condition). \n11  Since then, the Third Circuit has affirmed in part the City of Philadelphia decision.  City of \na  12  Philadelphia v. Attorney Gen. of United States of Am., No. 18-2648, 2019 WL 638931 (3d Cir. \nrt ni\nur\noo 13  Feb. 15, 2019).  The court found that no authority was conferred to the DOJ by Congress via the \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  Byrne JAG statute itself or other statutes at issue here such as Section 10102 or Section \nstrof \nDict  15  10153(a)(5)(D).  Id. at *10.  Several more courts also found the 2017 challenged conditions \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  unlawful.  In States of New York, et al. v. Dep't of Justice, 343 F. Supp. 3d 213 (S.D.N.Y. 2018), \nd Srn \nee 17  the court granted plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment.  It found the 2017 conditions \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  were ultra vires under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), id. at 231, Section 1373 was \n19  unconstitutional under the anticommandeering doctrine of the Tenth Amendment, id. at 237, the \n20  conditions violated the separation of powers, id. at 238, and the conditions were arbitrary and \n21  capricious under the APA, id. at 241.  Similarly, in Los Angeles v. Sessions, No. 17-cv-7215 (C.D. \n22  Cal. Sept. 13, 2018) (Dkt. No. 93) the court granted plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction \n23  of the 2017 challenged conditions.  It found that 34 U.S.C. § 10153(a), the provision providing the \n24  Attorney General with authority over the “form” of the application, did not indicate authority to \n25  add civil immigration conditions.  Id. at 3.   \n26  In City of Los Angeles v. Sessions, No. 18-cv-7347 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 15, 2019), the district \n27  court addressed the same fiscal year 2018 Byrne JAG conditions at issue here and granted \n28  plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment while denying defendant’s motion for partial dismissal \n6 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-WHO   Document 60   Filed 03/04/19   Page 7 of 31\n \n1  or partial summary judgment.  See Joint Supp. RJN, Ex. A.  It found no authority conferred by \n2  Section 10153(a)(5)(D) to support the nondisclosure condition, and it found that the information \n3  condition exceeded the “programmatic and financial information” that the Attorney General was \n4  otherwise authorized to require of state and local governments.  Id. at 7–8.  Lastly, the court \n5  granted a program-wide injunction and permanently enjoined the defendants from imposing the \n6  challenged conditions in fiscal year 2018 Byrne JAG awards.  Id. at 10.  \n7  D.  Challenged Conditions in the Fiscal Year 2018 Byrne JAG Program \n8  The DOJ continued to utilize requirements that are functionally equivalent to the three \n9  challenged conditions in the prior fiscal year 2017 JAG Solicitation and added two new conditions \n10  in fiscal year 2018.  California and San Francisco challenge each of these five conditions in the \n11  2018 Byrne JAG Solicitation.  See SF First Amended Compl. (“FAC”) (Dkt. No. 22); CA FAC \na  12  (Dkt. No. 20).  The DOJ moves for partial dismissal or summary judgment on the two new \nrt ni\nur\noo 13  conditions.  \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  The 2018 Solicitation requires California and San Francisco, through their chief legal \nstrof \nDict  15  officer, to continue to certify compliance with Section 1373.  It modifies this requirement \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  somewhat by also requiring certification of compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1644.  See DOJ RJN Ex. \nd Srn \nee 17  D ¶¶ 41–43.  Section 1644 contains nearly identical language as Section 1373 and prohibits \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  restrictions on communicating immigration information.  AR-1258, 1264.   \n19  The 2018 Solicitation also requires the chief legal officer to certify that the applying \n20  jurisdiction will not interfere with law enforcement in their access to correctional facilities or in \n21  the removal process by failing to provide notice of scheduled release dates and times.  See DOJ \n22  RJN Ex. D ¶¶ 45–46.  Put another way, the Solicitation requires the applicant not to have laws, \n23  policies, or practices that “impede” federal officers from exercising their authority under 8 U.S.C. \n24  § 1357(a) and which impede their authority “relating to” 8 U.S.C. §§ 1226(a), 1226(c), 1231(a)(4), \n25  1366(1), and 1366(3).  AR-1233, 1241–42, 1250, 1260, 1268.  Section 1357(a) describes \n26  immigration officer authority to “interrogate any alien,” “arrest any alien,” or exercise other \n27  proscribed powers without a warrant.  8 U.S.C. § 1357(a).  Additionally, Sections 1226, 1231, and \n28  1366 involve immigration officer powers to make arrests, detain, and release undocumented \n7 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-WHO   Document 60   Filed 03/04/19   Page 8 of 31\n \n1  persons, and to make annual reports on certain “criminal alien” statistics. \n2  The nondisclosure and the information conditions appear for the first time in the fiscal year \n3  2018 Byrne JAG funding conditions.  The nondisclosure condition provides that:  \n \n4 \nConsistent with the purposes and objectives of federal law enforcement statutes and \nfederal criminal law (including 8 U.S.C. 1324 and 18 U.S.C. chs. 1, 49, 227), no public \n5 \ndisclosure may be made of any federal law enforcement information in a direct or \n6  indirect attempt to conceal, harbor, or shield from detection any fugitive from justice \nunder 18 U.S.C. ch. 49, or any alien who has come to, entered, or remains in the United \n7  States in violation of 8 U.S.C. ch. 12 – without regard to whether such disclosure would \nconstitute (or could form a predicate for) a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1071 or 1072 or of 8 \n8  U.S.C. 1324(a).  \n9  See DOJ RJN Ex. D ¶ 44.  \n10  The information condition, which the DOJ disputes is a condition in the first instance, \n11  requires award recipients to collect certain information from sub-grant recipients.  Id., Ex. D ¶ 47.  \na  12  For example, California would not be able to authorize a sub-grant “unless it first obtains from the \nrt ni\nur\noo 13  proposed subrecipient responses to the questions identified in the program solicitation as \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  ‘Information regarding Communication with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and/or \nstrof \nDict  15  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).”  Id.  Those questions include whether the \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  jurisdiction has “any laws, policies, or practices related to whether, when, or how employees may \nd Srn \nee 17  communicate with DHS or ICE,” and require applicants to provide a copy of the law or policy, \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  describe the practices, and explain how it complies with Section 1373.  See FAC at 52 (SF Dkt. \n19  No. 22-2; CA Dkt. No. 20-1). \n20  E.  California and San Francisco’s Laws and Policies \n21  The plaintiffs’ asserted interests implicated by the Byrne JAG Program challenged \n22  conditions have been discussed thoroughly in the prior litigation of the fiscal year 2017 conditions.  \n23  See City & Cty. of San Francisco, 349 F. Supp. 3d at 937–40 (summarizing California and San \n24  Francisco laws and policies relevant to the 2017 conditions).  The California Legislature sought, in \n25  its laws and policies, to use its “limited resources for public safety rather than immigration \n26  enforcement” after concluding that limited involvement with immigration enforcement resulted in \n27  safer communities.  Id. at 938 (citing Cal. Gov. Code § 7284.2(f)).  It also based policies on local \n28  law enforcement’s belief in the importance of maintaining trust with immigrant communities.  Id.  \n8 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-WHO   Document 60   Filed 03/04/19   Page 9 of 31\n \n1  San Francisco agreed, providing its own evidence in support of the importance that trust holds for \n2  “greater reporting of crimes, more cooperative witnesses, and more assistance with law \n3  enforcement investigations.”  Id. at 941. \n4  II.  PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n5  In August 2018, California and San Francisco filed lawsuits challenging the DOJ’s \n6  imposition of the five challenged conditions on Byrne JAG funding in fiscal year 2018.  See \n7  Complaint (SF Dkt. No. 1; CA Dkt. No. 1).  The plaintiffs filed their first amended complaints in \n8  November 2018, and the DOJ filed a motion for partial dismissal or partial summary judgment in \n9  December.  See DOJ Partial Mot. to Dismiss or Summ. J. (SF Dkt. No. 27; CA Dkt. No. 25).  In \n10  response, California and San Francisco filed motions for summary judgment.  See Mots. For \n11  Summ. J. (SF Dkt. No. 30; CA Dkt. No. 29).  Amici have also filed briefs in both matters.2  \na  12  LEGAL STANDARD \nrt ni\nur\noo 13  I.  MOTIONS TO DISMISS \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the plaintiff must allege “enough facts to \nstrof \nDict  15  state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  (2007).  A claim is plausible when the plaintiff pleads facts that “allow[] the court to draw the \nd Srn \nee 17  reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (citation omitted).  While courts do not require “heightened fact \n19  pleading of specifics,” a plaintiff must allege facts sufficient to “raise a right to relief above the \n20  speculative level.”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, 570.  There must be “more than a sheer possibility \n21  that a defendant has acted unlawfully.”  Id. \n22  To decide if the plaintiff has stated a claim upon which relief can be granted, the court \n23  accepts the plaintiff’s allegations as true and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the \n24  plaintiff.  See Usher v. City of Los Angeles, 828 F.2d 556, 561 (9th Cir. 1987).  However, the court \n25  is not required to accept as true “allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of \n26 \n                                                 \n27 \n2 There are two motions for leave to file amicus briefs.  See Admin. Mots. for Leave (SF Dkt. No. \n54; CA Dkt. No. 38).  Because each motion complies with my prior Order Regarding Amicus \n28 \nBriefing, they are GRANTED.  \n9 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-WHO   Document 60   Filed 03/04/19   Page 10 of 31\n \n1  fact, or unreasonable inferences.”  In re Gilead Scis. Sec. Litig., 536 F.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir. \n2  2008). \n3  If the court dismisses a complaint, it “should grant leave to amend even if no request to \n4  amend the pleading was made, unless it determines that the pleading could not possibly be cured \n5  by the allegation of other facts.”  Lopez v. Smith, 203 F.3d 1122, 1127 (9th Cir. 2000).  In making \n6  this determination, the court should consider factors such as “the presence or absence of undue \n7  delay, bad faith, dilatory motive, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by previous amendments, \n8  undue prejudice to the opposing party and futility of the proposed amendment.”  Moore v. Kayport \n9  Package Express, 885 F.2d 531, 538 (9th Cir. 1989). \n10  II.  MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \n11  A party is entitled to summary judgment where it “shows that there is no genuine dispute \na  12  as to any material fact and [it] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a).  \nrt ni\nur\noo 13  To prevail, a party moving for summary judgment must show the lack of a genuine issue of \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  material fact with respect to an essential element of the non-moving party’s claim, or to a defense \nstrof \nDict  15  on which the non-moving party will bear the burden of persuasion at trial.  See Celotex Corp. v. \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  Once the movant has made this showing, the burden then shifts \nd Srn \nee 17  to the party opposing summary judgment to identify “specific facts showing there is a genuine \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  issue for trial.”  Id.  The party opposing summary judgment must then present affirmative \n19  evidence from which a jury could return a verdict in that party’s favor.  Anderson v. Liberty \n20  Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, 257 (1986). \n21  On summary judgment, the Court draws all reasonable factual inferences in favor of the \n22  non-movant.  Id. at 255.  In deciding a motion for summary judgment, “[c]redibility \n23  determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the \n24  facts are jury functions, not those of a judge.”  Id.  However, conclusory and speculative testimony \n25  does not raise genuine issues of fact and is insufficient to defeat summary judgment.  See \n26  Thornhill Publ’g Co., Inc. v. GTE Corp., 594 F.2d 730, 738 (9th Cir. 1979). \n27   \n28   \n10 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-WHO   Document 60   Filed 03/04/19   Page 11 of 31\n \n1  DISCUSSION \n2  I.  BYRNE JAG CONDITIONS RESEMBLING THE 2017 CONDITIONS \n3  As an initial matter, the parties have agreed to incorporate by reference arguments and \n4  supporting documents that they presented in the related 2017 Byrne JAG litigation to preserve \n5  their arguments for appeal.  See Minute Order (SF Dkt. No. 25; CA Dkt. No. 23); City & Cty. of \n6  San Francisco, 349 F. Supp. 3d 924.  There is no dispute that certain challenged conditions in the \n7  fiscal year 2018 Byrne JAG Program are functionally the same as the notice, access, and Section \n8  1373 certification conditions in the fiscal year 2017 Byrne JAG program at issue in the previous \n9  related litigation.  See SF RJN Ex. B at 36–37, 43 (stating the conditions); Ex. C at 3–4 \n10  (summarizing conditions, including “interview” and “custody” conditions on fiscal year 2018 \n11  Byrne JAG requirements resembling the notice and access conditions); City of Los Angeles, No. \na  12  18-cv-7347 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 15, 2019)(“the substance and effect of the conditions remains the \nrt ni\nur\noo 13  same” even after minor changes were made from 2017), Joint Supp. RJN, Ex. A at 5.  Even \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  though the conditions remain in the 2018 Solicitation, the parties also do not dispute that the DOJ \nstrof \nDict  15  is not enforcing them—at least while the matter is pending in the Ninth Circuit.  \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  As the notice, access, and Section 1373/1644 certification conditions remain essentially the \nd Srn \nee 17  same, my conclusions on those conditions still hold and I incorporate it by reference.  The 2018 \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  notice, access, and Section 1373/1644 certification conditions “violate the separation of powers; \n19  Section 1373 is unconstitutional; the Attorney General exceeds the Spending Power in violation of \n20  the United States Constitution” by imposing the Section 1373/1644 certification condition and \n21  access and notice conditions; and “the challenged conditions are arbitrary and capricious.”  City & \n22  Cty. of San Francisco, 349 F. Supp. 3d at 934. \n23  The remaining analysis in this Order focuses on the nondisclosure and information \n24  conditions, the challenged conditions in the 2018 Byrne JAG award and Solicitation that were not \n25  present in 2017.  \n26  II.  THE SEPARATION OF POWERS \n27  The DOJ argues that the nondisclosure and information conditions are authorized by three \n28  statutory provisions that are permissible under the separation of powers.  Specifically, it cites \n11 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-WHO   Document 60   Filed 03/04/19   Page 12 of 31\n \n1  34 U.S.C. § 10153(a)(5)(D) and 34 U.S.C. §§ 10102(a)(2) and (a)(6), asserts that the authority \n2  applies to the Byrne JAG program, and contends that the statutes exhibit congressional intent to \n3  allow the Assistant Attorney General (“AAG”) of the Office of Justice Programs to exercise \n4  discretion over formula grants.  \n5  Congress may, consistent with the separation of powers, delegate certain authority to spend \n6  money to the Executive Branch.  See Clinton v. City of N.Y., 524 U.S. 417, 488 (1998) (“Congress \n7  has frequently delegated the President the authority to spend, or not to spend, particular sums of \n8  money.”) (Breyer, J. dissenting).  The Constitution gives an “unmistakable expression of a \n9  determination that legislation by the national Congress be a step-by-step, deliberate and \n10  deliberative process.”  I.N.S. v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 959 (1983).   \n11  Sections 10102(a)(2) and (6) state:  \n \na  12  The  Assistant  Attorney  General  shall…  (2)  maintain  liaison  with...State \nrt ni\nur governments in matters relating to criminal justice; [and]… (6) exercise such other \noo 13 \nCif powers and functions as may be vested in the Assistant Attorney General pursuant \nt al\nicC 14  to this chapter or by delegation of the Attorney General, including placing special \nstrof  conditions on all grants, and determining priority purposes for formula grants. \nDict  15 \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  34 U.S.C. § 10102. \nd Srn \nee 17  Section 10153 reads in part:  \nth\nUniort  \nN 18 \n(a) To request a grant under this part, the chief executive officer of a State or unit \nof local government shall submit an application to the Attorney General within 120 \n19 \ndays after the date on which funds to carry out this part are appropriated for a fiscal \n20  year, in such form as the Attorney General may require. \n… \n21  (5) A certification, made in a form acceptable to the Attorney General and executed \nby the chief executive officer of the applicant (or by another officer of the applicant, \n22 \nif qualified under regulations promulgated by the Attorney General), that \n… \n23 \n(D) the applicant will comply with all provisions of this part and all other applicable \n24  Federal laws. \n25  34 U.S.C. § 10153. \n26  None of these statutory authorities grants the DOJ power to impose the fiscal year 2018 Byrne \n27  JAG challenged conditions, as discussed further below. \n28 \n12 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-WHO   Document 60   Filed 03/04/19   Page 13 of 31\n \nA.  Section 10102 Does Not Grant Authority to Impose the Fiscal Year 2018 Byrne \n1  JAG Challenged Conditions \n2  The DOJ relies on Section 10102 for independent authority to impose the nondisclosure \n3  and information conditions.  It makes similar arguments in favor of the new fiscal year 2018 \n4  conditions that it made in the litigation over the 2017 conditions.  In particular, it contends that \n5  Section 10102(a)(6) grants it authority because the amendment of the Reauthorization Act, \n6  creating the Byrne JAG Program in 2006 inserted “including placing special conditions on all \n7  grants, and determining priority purposes for formula grants.”  Pub. L. No. 109-162, § 1152(b), \n8  119 Stat. at 3113; 34 U.S.C. § 10102(a)(6).  The DOJ contends that giving the amendment no \n9  practical effect would contravene the “well-known canon of statutory construction that, in general, \n10  a statute should not be construed so as to render a word or clause inoperative.”  Bell v. Reno, 218 \n11  F.3d 86, 91 (2d Cir. 2000); see, e.g., Johnson v. Consumerinfo.com, Inc., 745 F.3d 1019, 1022 (9th \na  12  Cir. 2014) (“When Congress acts to amend a statute, we presume it intends its amendment to have \nrt ni\nur\noo 13  real and substantial effect.”) (citation omitted). \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  The DOJ noted its disagreement with my prior Order in the related litigation, but has not \nstrof \nDict  15  shown why the legal reasoning concerning the fiscal year 2017 conditions does not apply with \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  equal force in 2018.  In City of Chicago v. Sessions, 888 F.3d 272, 284–85 (7th Cir. 2018), and \nd Srn \nee 17  City of Philadelphia v. Sessions, 280 F. Supp. 3d 579, 616–17 (E.D. Pa. 2017), the courts found \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  that the DOJ’s interpretation of Section 10102(a)(6) was contrary to the plain meaning of the \n19  statute.  I agreed with City of Chicago and City of Philadelphia in the prior related litigation.  See \n20  City & Cty. of San Francisco, 349 F. Supp. 3d at 947–48.  Since then, the Third Circuit and the \n21  Hon. Egardo Ramos of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York \n22  have also rejected the DOJ’s interpretation of Section 10102(a)(6).  See City of Philadelphia, 2019 \n23  WL 638931, at *8; States of New York, et al. v. Dep't of Justice, 343 F. Supp. 3d 213 (S.D.N.Y. \n24  2018). \n25  Section 10102(a)(6)’s language allowing the Attorney General to place “special conditions \n26  on all grants” and to determine “priority purposes for formula grants” depends on the authority \n27  “vested in the Assistant Attorney General pursuant to this chapter…” 34 U.S.C. § 10102.  As I \n28  found in the related litigation, “[n]o portion of the same chapter authorizes the conditions \n13 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-WHO   Document 60   Filed 03/04/19   Page 14 of 31\n \n1  explicitly,” the Attorney General does not have the power to impose the conditions independent of \n2  Congress, and the Byrne JAG statute does not reference Section 10102.  City & Cty. of San \n3  Francisco, 349 F. Supp. 3d at 948. \n4  Section 10102(a)(6)’s statutory structure does not support the DOJ’s interpretation of its \n5  broad independent authority either.  As the court discussed in City of Chicago, 888 F.3d at 285, \n6  the final “catch-all provision at the end of a list of explicit powers would be an odd place indeed to \n7  put a sweeping power to impose any conditions on any grants…”  This is still true.  \n8  1.  The duty to maintain liaison under Section 10102(a)(2) \n9    Related to the power to place “special conditions,” however, the DOJ relies on a provision \n10  stated earlier in the list of its “Duties and Functions of the Assistant Attorney General.”  34 U.S.C. \n11  § 10102.  The DOJ asserts that under Section 10102(a)(2), the AAG’s duty to “maintain liaison” \na  12  with California and San Francisco in matters related to criminal justice authorizes it to impose the \nrt ni\nouor 13  nondisclosure and information conditions.3  It contends that the nondisclosure condition is \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  justified by the need to keep law enforcement officers safe and their operations confidential while \nstrof \nDict  15  working with state and local law enforcement, and that the information condition was intended to \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  clarify that applicants can abide by other conditions and maintain liaison with DOJ.  It interprets \nd Srn \nee 17  Section 10102(a)(2) as permitting it to (i) protect the confidentiality of federal law enforcement \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  information provided to state and local agencies, and (ii) assess the ability of those agencies to \n19  engage in cooperation by gathering information about their laws and policies.  See Eringer v. \n20  Principality of Monaco, No. CV 10-1803 GAF (EX), 2011 WL 13134271, at *5 (C.D. Cal. Aug. \n21  23, 2011), aff’d, 533 F. App’x 703 (9th Cir. 2013) (stating that plaintiff’s duty to “maintain \n22  liaison” between two agencies entailed “regularly shar[ing] sensitive intelligence information.”).  \n23  An agency lacks power to act “unless and until Congress confers power upon it.”  La. Pub. \n24  Serv. Comm’n v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986).  In the grant context, the power to place \n25  conditions on grants depends on “whether Congress conferred authority on the Attorney General \n26 \n                                                 \n3 Previously, the DOJ relied on Section 10102(a)(2) to argue that its 2017 conditions comport with \n27 \nthe Spending Power and were related to the criminal justice purposes of the Byrne JAG Program.  \nI found that the challenged conditions, premised on the authority of Section 10102(a)(2), were \n28 \nunrelated.  See City & Cty. of San Francisco, 349 F. Supp. 3d at 958–59. \n14 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-WHO   Document 60   Filed 03/04/19   Page 15 of 31\n \n1  to impose them.”  City of Chicago v. Sessions, 264 F. Supp. 3d 933, 940 (N.D. Ill. 2017).  The \n2  DOJ puts far more weight on “maintain liaison” than it can hold.   \n3  As discussed above, the plain text of Section 10102 grants the AAG “power to place \n4  special conditions on grants only to the extent that such power has been vested in him or her \n5  ‘pursuant to this chapter or by delegation of the Attorney General.”  City of Philadelphia, 2019 \n6  WL 638931, at *7.4  The text of the “maintain liaison” authority on which the DOJ relies states \n7  only that “[t]he Assistant Attorney General shall… (2) maintain liaison with...State governments \n8  in matters relating to criminal justice.”  34 U.S.C. § 10102.  This provision does not support a \n9  broad authority to place the challenged conditions on Byrne JAG grantees.  California and San \n10  Francisco argue that this statutory provision was not intended as empowering the DOJ to impose \n11  conditions, and instead was an instruction for the AAG to maintain bilateral communications or \na  12  act as a point of contact with state and local governments. \nrt ni\nur\noo 13  The DOJ does not identify where in the statutory text Congress expressed its intent for \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  maintaining liaison to amount to discretionary authority for creating conditions on state and local \nstrof \nDict  15  governments in the Byrne JAG Program.  Instead, it merely defines “liaison” itself.  See DOJ \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  Oppo./Reply at 3 (citing Liaison, Merriam-Webster, https://www.merriam-\nd Srn \nee 17  webster.com/dictionary/liaison (last visited Jan. 15, 2019) (defining liaison as “a close bond or \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  connection” or “a person who establishes and maintains communication for mutual understanding \n19  and cooperation.”).  It is too great a leap to conclude that because Congress imposed an obligation \n20  on the DOJ to “maintain liaison,” or maintain a close connection to “Federal and State \n21  governments in matters relating to criminal justice,” that it was intending to grant the DOJ broad \n22  authority to impose the challenged conditions over states and local governments receiving funds.  \n23  34 U.S.C. § 10102(a)(2). \n24  The structure of Section 10102 does not support the contention that “maintain liaison” in \n25 \n                                                 \n4 This is consistent with the findings of every other court to hear this argument on Section \n26 \n10102(a)(6).  See, e.g., City of Chicago, 888 F.3d at 285 (finding the term “including” limited \nauthority to placing conditions vested in the Attorney General in the same chapter or delegated to \n27 \nhim or her elsewhere); States of New York et al., 343 F. Supp. 3d at 228 (same); City & Cty. of San \nFrancisco, 349 F. Supp. 3d at 948 (same). \n28 \n  \n15 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-WHO   Document 60   Filed 03/04/19   Page 16 of 31\n \n1  Section 10102(a)(2) provides more than a ministerial duty on the Attorney General to maintain \n2  communication with other Federal and State agencies.  As the Third Circuit recently stated, “a \n3  word is known by the company it keeps.”  City of Philadelphia, 2019 WL 638931, at *8.  The six \n4  powers of the AAG in this section “all deal with the AAG’s power to disseminate criminal justice \n5  information and coordinate with various agencies and officials.”  Id.  The Seventh Circuit agrees \n6  with this interpretation.  See City of Chicago, 888 F.3d at 285 (“The preceding ‘powers’ in the list, \n7  §§ 10102(a)(1)–(5), address the communication and coordination duties of the Assistant Attorney \n8  General.”).   \n9  On the other hand, the nondisclosure condition is more than ministerial.  It requires \n10  grantees to internally enforce against “direct or indirect attempts” to disclose information, and it \n11  empowers the AAG to be the sole arbiter of what it considers to be a violation of the condition.  \na  12  Further, there is no indication that the “maintain liaison” duty in “matters relating to \nrt ni\nur\noo 13  criminal justice” conferred a power to place conditions pertaining to immigration enforcement at \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  all.  Id.  The information condition is squarely focused on immigration enforcement, and at most \nstrof \nDict  15  superficially touches on the liaison relationship.  The information condition may help determine if \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  grantees can maintain liaison, as the DOJ argued at the hearing, but it was also intended to confirm \nd Srn \nee 17  compliance with conditions like the Section 1373 certification condition.   \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  The nondisclosure condition raises a closer question.  The DOJ asserts that the condition is \n19  concerned with protecting confidential federal law enforcement information and the liaison \n20  relationship between the federal and state or local partners.  A narrow and unambiguous condition \n21  requiring jurisdictions to promise not to disclose imminent confidential federal criminal law \n22  enforcement operations in order to receive a law enforcement grant would be reasonable: the risk \n23  of harm to law enforcement officers and civilians would be significantly increased if lack of trust \n24  between federal and local partners caused the federal government not to disclose planned \n25  operations to their local counterparts.  That would interfere with the ability to “maintain liaison.”  \n26  California and San Francisco agreed at the hearing that the desire to maintain confidentiality is \n27  reasonable and that they would not intentionally publicize confidential information concerning \n28  impending operations.  \n16 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-WHO   Document 60   Filed 03/04/19   Page 17 of 31\n \n1  That said, the scope of the nondisclosure condition exceeds the narrow characterization \n2  offered by the DOJ, and it exceeds the ministerial duty to “maintain liaison.”  The duty to \n3  “maintain liaison…in matters relating to criminal justice,” however expansively one reads it, does \n4  not venture into immigration enforcement more broadly. Yet the nondisclosure condition focuses \n5  not only on preventing disclosures related to harboring “fugitives of justice” but applies to “any \n6  alien.”  Further, it prohibits a “direct or indirect attempt” to harbor those individuals, as \n7  determined by the AAG.  This language seeks the broadest coverage possible by its use of the \n8  term “indirect attempt,” which has no boundary.  It would be interpreted by the AAG.  Given the \n9  current tension between federal and local authorities, it does not require much imagination to think \n10  that the AAG today might well consider many parts of the “sanctuary” laws as indirect attempts to \n11  harbor “aliens,” despite rulings of courts around the country that have rejected DOJ’s \na  12  interpretations of its authority and the constitutionality of Section 1373.   \nrt ni\nur\noo 13  The DOJ’s interest in immigration enforcement is distinct from the criminal justice focus \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  of the Byrne JAG Program.  City & Cty. of San Francisco, 349 F. Supp. 3d at 946 (“Congress \nstrof \nDict  15  repealed the only requirement related to immigration that existed before, and it has failed to amend \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  the Byrne JAG statute to add similar conditions since.”).  Congress knows how to grant broad \nd Srn \nee 17  discretionary authority but did not do so here.  See 34 U.S.C. § 10446(e)(3) (Grants to Combat \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  Violent Crime Against Women) (“In disbursing grants under this subchapter, the Attorney General \n19  may impose reasonable conditions on grant awards....”).  There is no authority in Section 10102 \n20  for the DOJ to impose the fiscal year 2018 Byrne JAG nondisclosure or information conditions \n21  based on its authority to place “special conditions” on grants or its duty to “maintain liaison” in \n22  criminal justice matters.   \n23  B.  Section 10153(a) Does Not Grant Authority to Impose the Fiscal Year 2018 \nByrne JAG Challenged Conditions \n24 \nThe DOJ contends that Section 10153(a), allowing the AAG to dictate the “form” of \n25 \napplications, and Section 10153(a)(5)(D), allowing it to require compliance with all “applicable \n26 \nFederal laws” in connection with the Byrne JAG awards, provide ample support for the \n27 \nnondisclosure and information conditions.  The nondisclosure condition references statutes like 8 \n28 \n17 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-WHO   Document 60   Filed 03/04/19   Page 18 of 31\n \n1  U.S.C. § 1324(a), while the information condition references compliance with Section 1373.  See \n2  DOJ Mot. for Partial Dismissal or Summ. J. at 7–8.5   \n3    California argues that the conditions violate the Tenth Amendment for three reasons: (i) \n4  the statutory structure of JAG limits the “applicable Federal laws” to those related to the grant \n5  application; (ii) laws identified in the fiscal year 2018 certifications do not apply to California or \n6  its subdivisions at all; and (iii) even if Sections 1226, 1231, 1357, or 1366 were “applicable \n7  Federal laws,” the DOJ lacks authority to dictate what the state can do without violating \n8  anticommandeering doctrine.  San Francisco’s Tenth Amendment arguments primarily concern \n9  Section 1373, which I have already addressed.  See supra Sec. I.  \n10  In the Byrne JAG Program, Congress has pre-determined who the eligible recipients are \n11  and how much money they are to receive, but the operative statute leaves to the Attorney General \na  12  certain discretion to carry out parts of the program.  For example, the Byrne JAG statute grants \nrt ni\nur\noo 13  authority to waive the “program assessment component” requirement, 34 U.S.C. § 10152(c)(1)–\nCif\nt al\nicC 14  (2), to add requirements to assure that the applicant report certain programmatic and financial \nstrof \nDict  15  records “as the Attorney General may reasonably require,” id. at § 10153(a)(4), and to require a \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  certification that “there has been appropriate coordination with affected agencies.”  Id. at § \nd Srn \nee 17  10153(a)(5).  \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  In the related litigation, I addressed whether Section 1373 (if it was constitutional) would \n19  be an applicable law authorized by Section 10153(a)(5)(D).  Starting with the text, I found that the \n20  term “applicable” could hold both meanings proposed by the parties and agreed with the City of \n21  Philadelphia and City of Chicago decisions that found the plain meaning of the text in the statute a \n22  “close call.”  City of Philadelphia, 280 F. Supp. 3d at 619; City of Chicago, 264 F. Supp. 3d at \n23  944.  The text alone did not indicate an answer to the scope of authority included in requiring \n24  compliance with applicable federal laws.  \n25  Turning to the statutory structure, I found that the “applicable laws” clause – located in the \n26 \n                                                 \n27 \n5 The fiscal year 2018 JAG Solicitation requires other certifications of compliance with Section \n1373, Section 1644, Section 1324, and a certification to not “impede” federal officials’ authority \n28 \nrelated to 8 U.S.C. §§ 1226, 1231, 1357, and 1366.  See AR-1268.  \n18 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-WHO   Document 60   Filed 03/04/19   Page 19 of 31\n \n1  last of four residual clauses within a proviso concerning the grant application – confined \n2  “applicable” to the subject matter of the principal clause.  See Republic of Iraq v. Beaty, 556 U.S. \n3  848, 857–58 (2009).  Therefore, “the phrase ‘all other applicable Federal laws’ refers to the \n4  preceding clause requiring grant applications to include a certification ‘in a form acceptable to the \n5  Attorney General.’”  City & Cty. of San Francisco, 349 F. Supp. 3d at 955 (citing 34 U.S.C. § \n6  10153(a)(5) (emphasis added)).  I reaffirm that view here.6 \n7   The DOJ’s references to federal laws in the fiscal year 2018 certifications, to the extent \n8  they are asserted as applicable at all, are not related to the grant application or its form.  For \n9  “applicable” laws like Section 1373 and Section 1644, the DOJ preserves its disagreements for \n10  appeal.  However, the DOJ does not argue against California’s position that the other laws \n11  referenced in the conditions are not applicable to the State at all.  See DOJ Mot. at 19 (“the FY \na  12  2018 Byrne JAG conditions do not require California to comply with the other provisions – that is, \nrt ni\nur\noo 13  8 U.S.C. §§ 1226, 1231, 1357, and 1366.”).  If the federal laws mentioned in the new 2018 \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  certifications are not “applicable Federal laws,” their respective conditions are not authorized by \nstrof \nDict  15  Section 10153(a).   \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  California also argues that the anticommandeering doctrine would bar the challenged \nd Srn \nee 17  conditions, even if Sections 1226, 1231, 1257, and 1366 were applicable laws.  See Murphy v. \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  NCAA, 138 S. Ct. 1461, 1478 (2018) (finding prohibitions that “unequivocally dictate[] what a \n19  state legislature may and may not do” violate the anti-commandeering rule as much as affirmative \n20  commands.).  I need not decide this now.  The DOJ does not contend those laws, referenced in its \n21  conditions, are “applicable” to California or San Francisco in the first place.   \n22  After reviewing the asserted authority of Section 10102 and Section 10153(a), I find that \n23  Congress has not granted the DOJ the power to impose the nondisclosure or information \n24 \n                                                 \n6 The Third Circuit also held that Section 1373 was not an applicable law for purposes of the \n25 \nByrne JAG program.  See City of Philadelphia, 2019 WL 638931, at *9 (finding “it would be \nreasonable to view ‘all other applicable Federal laws’ to refer specifically to laws that apply to \n26 \noperations relating to the grant, not to require the City to certify compliance with every single law \nthat might apply to it.”).  The court also stated that 34 U.S.C. § 10228(a), which prohibits the DOJ \n27 \nfrom “exercis[ing] any direction, supervision, or control over any police force or any other \ncriminal justice agency,” could be a statutory limit on what is “applicable” under Section \n28 \n10153(a).

Accordingly, imposition of the challenged conditions is ultra vires and violates the \n2  separation of powers.  \n3  III.  THE SPENDING POWER \n4  Plaintiffs raise claims for relief premised on a violation of the Spending Clause of Article \n5  I, Section VIII of the United States Constitution, assuming for the sake of argument that Congress \n6  delegated to the DOJ authority to impose the challenged conditions on Byrne JAG funding.  See \n7  SF FAC at 26; CA FAC at 35.  Congress “may offer funds to the States, and may condition those \n8  offers on compliance with specified conditions.”  Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. \n9  519, 537 (2012).  However, if Congress intended to impose conditions on spending they must be \n10  “reasonably related to the purpose of the federal program.”  S. Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 207 \n11  (1987) (O’Connor, J., dissenting).   \na  12  Additionally, if Congress intended “to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, \nrt ni\nouor 13  it must do so unambiguously.”  Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  (1981).  Unambiguous conditions enable “States to exercise their choice knowingly, cognizant of \nstrof \nDict  15  the consequences of their participation.”  Id.  Courts thus view statutes “from the perspective of a \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  state official who is engaged in the process of deciding whether the State should accept [the] funds \nd Srn \nee 17  and the obligations that go with those funds.”  Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Murphy, \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  548 U.S. 291, 296 (2006).  \n19  A.  Relatedness \n20  The Byrne JAG Program is a formula grant program for certain criminal justice purposes.  \n21  34 U.S.C. § 10152(a)(1); see also City & Cty. of San Francisco, 349 F. Supp. 3d at 959 \n22  (summarizing the criminal justice purposes of the Byrne JAG Program more thoroughly).  The \n23  DOJ moves for dismissal or summary judgment, insisting that the nondisclosure and information \n24  conditions are sufficiently related to the federal interests in the Byrne JAG Program.  See New \n25  York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 167 (1992) (stating that only “some relationship” is necessary \n26  between spending conditions and “the purpose of the federal spending.”).  Specifically, the DOJ \n27  asserts that the nondisclosure and information conditions insure that any funded program does not \n28  “thwart the federal government’s exercise of its ability to remove aliens not lawfully present in the \n20 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-WHO   Document 60   Filed 03/04/19   Page 21 of 31\n \n1  United States or removable due to a criminal conviction.”  DOJ Mot. at 14:17–19. \n2  San Francisco contrasts the immigration enforcement purposes of the challenged fiscal \n3  year 2018 conditions with Congress’s purposes in creating the Byrne JAG Program—to support \n4  states and local law enforcement in eight permissible program areas related to “combat[ting] the \n5  most urgent public safety problems in their own communities.”  City & Cty. of San Francisco, 349 \n6  F. Supp. 3d at 959 (quoting 151 Cong. Rec. 25, 919 (2005)).  I have already addressed why \n7  immigration enforcement conditions like the access and notice conditions were not sufficiently \n8  related to criminal justice to meet the relatedness requirement.  Id. (“immigration law does not \n9  impact local law enforcement’s administration and enforcement efforts in the criminal justice \n10  system.”); see also City of Philadelphia, 280 F. Supp. 3d at 642, 642 (“Immigration law has \n11  nothing to do with the enforcement of local criminal laws.”).   \na  12  The same is true with the information condition, which appears to be included at least in \nrt ni\nur\noo 13  part “to assess the accuracy” of the applicant’s certifying compliance with Section 1373.  DOJ \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  Mot. at 8.  Section 1373 is unrelated to Byrne JAG for all the reasons discussed in my prior Order.  \nstrof \nDict  15  See City & Cty. of San Francisco, 349 F. Supp. 3d at 961 (“Requiring a certification of \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  compliance with an inapplicable law would seem to exemplify un-relatedness.”).  Similarly, \nd Srn \nee 17  requiring the underlying information from grantees to assess their compliance with an inapplicable \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  law like Section 1373 is equally unrelated.  The immigration enforcement interests furthered by \n19  the information condition do not sufficiently relate to the federal interests in criminal justice of the \n20  Byrne JAG Program.   \n21  However, my prior analysis is not necessarily dispositive of the nondisclosure condition, a \n22  part of which could be reasonably related to Byrne JAG’s purposes.  See Dole, 483 U.S. at 213 \n23  (“Congress may condition grants under the spending power only in ways reasonably related to the \n24  purpose of the federal program.”).  The crux of DOJ’s argument relies on an incident where the \n25  Oakland’s mayor informed residents of an impending federal immigration operation on social \n26  media, allegedly compromising the operation and law enforcement safety.7  The nondisclosure \n27 \n                                                 \n7 Plaintiffs dispute the underlying facts and whether this incident would apply to the nondisclosure \n28 \ncondition.  The evidence of what happened is not before me, and I take no position on it.   \n21 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-WHO   Document 60   Filed 03/04/19   Page 22 of 31\n \n1  condition requires California and San Francisco to certify that they will not disclose confidential \n2  federal law enforcement information that relates to harboring both criminals and non-criminal \n3  immigrants.  See DOJ RJN Ex. D ¶ 44.   \n4  Unlike the 2017 notice and access conditions, the nondisclosure condition’s focus on \n5  protecting confidential federal law enforcement information expressly includes criminal and  \n6  immigration enforcement.  While immigration enforcement conditions had no relationship with \n7  any of the eight permissible Byrne JAG funded program areas, protecting the communication of \n8  confidential law enforcement information in exigent circumstances overlaps with some focuses of \n9  the program.  See, e.g., 34 U.S.C. § 10152(a)(1)(A) (“law enforcement program”); (E) (“drug \n10  treatment and [drug] enforcement programs”).  Accordingly, protecting confidential federal law \n11  enforcement information has some relationship with plaintiffs’ Byrne JAG funded programs.  For \na  12  example, California’s Byrne JAG funding has in the past gone towards task forces on criminal \nrt ni\nur\noo 13  drug enforcement, violent crime, and gang activities—all of which would share an interest in \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  maintaining the confidentiality of federal law enforcement information.  See Joll Decl. ¶ 15.  San \nstrof \nDict  15  Francisco’s funding appears to be more services-oriented, but it has also used funds for law \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  enforcement programs “designed to reduce criminal behavior and improve public safety…” SF \nd Srn \nee 17  Mot. Summ. J. at 4; Chyi Decl. ¶¶ 10–11, 17 (discussing programs like Young Adult Court, Law \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  Enforcement Assisted Diversion, Focused Drug Deterrence, and Drug Court Prosecution aimed at \n19  reducing recidivism).  \n20  That said, as California and San Francisco argue, the nondisclosure condition does not \n21  make a distinction between undocumented immigrants subject to potential criminal law \n22  enforcement and those who are not, even though “many immigration violations do not involve \n23  criminal law and are only violations of civil penalties.”  City & Cty. of San Francisco, 349 F. \n24  Supp. 3d at 960; see also 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(6)(A) & (9)(B), 1202(g), 1227(a)(1)(B).  The \n25  nondisclosure condition is somewhat related to the federal interests in criminal justice, but for the \n26  reasons described below it does not pass muster because of its ambiguity.  \n27  B.  Ambiguity  \n28  California and San Francisco challenge the nondisclosure and information conditions as \n22 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-WHO   Document 60   Filed 03/04/19   Page 23 of 31\n \n1  ambiguous.  I focus again on the nondisclosure condition because the analysis of the information \n2  condition is little different than the Section 1373 certification condition in the 2017 litigation.  \n3  California argues that (i) the nondisclosure condition’s authority under Section 10102(a)(2) is \n4  even more ambiguous than Section 10102(a)(6) or Section 10152(a)(5)(D), which I also found to \n5  be ambiguous; and (ii) the DOJ’s own explanations of the nondisclosure condition does not enable \n6  grantees to knowingly participate “cognizant of the consequences.”  DOJ Ex. D ¶ 44.  San \n7  Francisco adds that both conditions “cannot have been unambiguously authorized by Congress” \n8  because they were never statutorily authorized by Congress.  City of Philadelphia, 280 F. Supp. 3d \n9  at 646.   \n10  The parties dispute whether the nondisclosure condition is clear by its text.  The DOJ \n11  points to the Rules of Construction that define terms like “alien,” “federal law enforcement \na  12  information,” and “public disclosure” for purposes of the nondisclosure condition.  Each award \nrt ni\nur\noo 13  document also directs applicants to ask the Office of Justice Programs questions on the meaning or \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  scope of the conditions if anything is not clear.  See DOJ RJN, Ex. C ¶¶ 42–46.  The DOJ relies on \nstrof \nDict  15  cases from different circuits that each hold Congress “need not specifically identify and proscribe \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  in advance every conceivable state action that would be improper.”  Benning v. Georgia, 391 F.3d \nd Srn \nee 17  1299, 1306 (11th Cir. 2004); see also Charles v. Verhagen, 348 F.3d 601, 607 (7th Cir. 2003) \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  (finding that the nature of a grant condition can be indeterminate as long as its existence is clear).  \n19  DOJ’s argument fails.  For one thing, the nondisclosure condition suffers from the same \n20  problem identified by the court in City of Philadelphia: if there is no authority conferred by \n21  Section 10102(a)(2) enabling the DOJ’s nondisclosure condition, then it cannot have been \n22  unambiguously authorized.  City of Philadelphia, 280 F. Supp. 3d at 646 (finding the conditions \n23  “[c]annot have been unambiguously authorized by Congress if they were never statutorily \n24  authorized.”).  For another, the nondisclosure condition flunks the operative test of whether it \n25  allows grantees to participate in the Byrne JAG Program “knowingly,” and “cognizant of the \n26  consequences.”  Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp., 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981).  The condition goes well \n27  beyond the DOJ’s stated purposes.  It is one thing to protect against disclosures of the kind \n28  allegedly made by Oakland’s mayor.  AR-01038–39.  But it is quite another to require grantees to \n23 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-WHO   Document 60   Filed 03/04/19   Page 24 of 31\n \n1  comply with the unexplained and unbounded discretion of the AAG to avoid “indirect attempts” to \n2  disclose information. \n3  California posits that it is unclear whether the condition prevents it from participation \n4  because of its TRUTH Act and Model Policies for K-12 schools.  The TRUTH Act was enacted to \n5  “promote public safety” and transparency by subjecting local law enforcement who assist federal \n6  immigration enforcement “to meaningful oversight.”  2016 Cal. Legis. Serv. Ch. 768 § 2(h), (i).  \n7  The TRUTH Act classifies certain ICE records as public records under the California Public \n8  Records Act, and it requires that jurisdictions providing ICE with access to detention facilities \n9  hold community forums to inform the public about ICE access.  Cal. Gov’t Code § 7283.1(d).  The \n10  State has found these forums helpful to “promoting accountability between law enforcement and \n11  the community.”  Goldstein Decl. ¶ 11.  \na  12  California’s K-12 Model Policies for responding to immigration enforcement were \nrt ni\nur\noo 13  published in Assembly Bill 699, Cal. Ed. Code § 234.7(f)(1), to support students’ “inalienable \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  right to attend campuses which are safe, secure and peaceful.”  Cal. Const. art. I § 28(f)(1).  The \nstrof \nDict  15  K-12 Model Policies require school employees to provide students and their families “with \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  appropriate notice and a description of the immigration officer’s request,” along with any \nd Srn \nee 17  documents provided by the law enforcement officer, if there is a request for immigration \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  enforcement information.  CA RJN Ex. D at 20.  School employees are also required to obtain \n19  consent from the student’s parent or guardian before allowing them to be interviewed or searched \n20  for immigration enforcement purposes.  CA RJN Ex. D at 31.8   \n21  At the hearing, the DOJ disclaimed any intent to reach the TRUTH Act’s public forum \n22  requirements or the K-12 model policies by enforcement of the nondisclosure condition.  Yet in its \n23  APA argument, the DOJ contended that California Labor Code § 90.2(a), requiring employers to \n24 \n                                                 \n25 \n8 Amicus Los Angeles Unified School District joins California in arguing that AB 699 and the K-\n12 Model Policies restrict schools from sharing information for immigration purposes potentially \n26 \nprohibited by the nondisclosure condition.  See Amicus Brief (CA Dkt. No. 38).  According to \nLAUSD, the State Legislature intended to support the view that “[c]hildren should be able to learn \n27 \nwithout fear and disruptions.”  S. Comm. on Education, analysis of AB 699, 2017- 2018 Reg. \nSess. (passed as amended Sept. 15, 2017).  It believes the nondisclosure condition is antithetical to \n28 \nthe interests and policies of the State embodied by AB 699 and its K-12 Model Policies. \n24 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-WHO   Document 60   Filed 03/04/19   Page 25 of 31\n \n1  notify employees of records inspections by federal immigration authorities, was indicative of a \n2  larger problem in California in which undocumented employees are given an opportunity to leave \n3  before immigration officers detect them.  Similar notice requirements are at issue with the K-12 \n4  Model Policies.  California also notes that the federal government’s own statements about \n5  California laws increase the ambiguity of its Byrne JAG application.  See CA RJN Exs. E–G \n6  (citing the Acting ICE Director’s statements suggesting that California laws violate the \n7  nondisclosure requirement).   \n8  The DOJ argues that intent is required to make an attempt to disclose information, even an \n9  indirect one.  Perhaps so, but this does not clarify what conduct is proscribed; it merely leaves the \n10  AAG with authority to determine a violation “without regard to whether such disclosure would \n11  constitute (or could form a predicate for) a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1071 or 1072 or of 8 U.S.C. \na  12  1324(a).”  Id.  \nrt ni\nur\noo 13  Even if Congress provided the DOJ with authority to impose the nondisclosure condition \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  within the duty of Section 10102(a)(2) to “maintain liaison” or other laws (which I found was not \nstrof \nDict  15  the case), the breadth of the condition’s scope render it ambiguous.  It is not an answer to refer \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  questions to the Office of Justice Programs—the scope must be clear from the condition so that \nd Srn \nee 17  prospective Byrne JAG applicants may make an informed choice, cognizant of the consequences. \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  IV.  ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS CLAIM \n19  The DOJ moves to dismiss or for summary judgment on California’s arbitrary and \n20  capricious APA claim.  It asserts that the claim fails because its reasons for imposing the condition \n21  and requirements “were entirely rational.”  FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, \n22  517 (2009).  The DOJ insists that it was reasonable for the Office of Justice Programs to deny \n23  federal law enforcement funding to a jurisdiction that publicly discloses sensitive information in \n24  an attempt to harbor unlawful immigrants or fugitives from detection, or for refusing to provide \n25  information about its laws or policies on communicating with federal authorities.  \n26  In APA claims asserting that agency action was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \n27  discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), the defendant agency \n28  is required to “examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation” for their \n25 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-WHO   Document 60   Filed 03/04/19   Page 26 of 31\n \n1  actions.  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 \n2  (1983).  Actions with a “rational connection between the facts found and the choice made” are \n3  valid.  Id.  In contrast, agency action should be overturned if the agency relied on factors Congress \n4  did not intend for it to consider, failed to consider important aspects of the problem, or its decision \n5  was counter to the evidence before it.  Id.  Thus, the reviewing court should “not supply a \n6  reasoned basis for the agency’s action that the agency itself has not given,” and should “uphold a \n7  decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency’s path may reasonably be discerned.”  Bowman \n8  Transp., Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight Sys., Inc., 419 U.S. 281, 285–86 (1974) (internal citation \n9  omitted).  \n10  The complete administrative record includes 1867 pages of documents.  See Admin. \n11  Record (SF Dkt. No. 26; CA Dkt. No. 28).  The DOJ argues its agency action for the new \na  12  conditions was reasonable given an Office of Inspector General Memorandum regarding potential \nrt ni\nur\noo 13  violations of Section 1373 (AR00366), emails to Byrne JAG grantees and state administering \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  agencies (AR00392–97), the Backgrounder on Grant Requirements (AR00993), and social media \nstrof \nDict  15  posts from Oakland Mayor Libby Schaff (AR01038–39). \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  The 2016 OIG Memorandum and Backgrounder on Grant Requirements are the same \nd Srn \nee 17  documents that the DOJ unsuccessfully relied upon in the prior related litigation, and in City of \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  Philadelphia, 280 F. Supp. 3d at 619–625.  I found that the OIG Memorandum could not be relied \n19  on for establishing a “rational connection between the facts found and the choice made” because \n20  the choice to impose a Section 1373 condition was made before the Memorandum was issued, and \n21  the document did not purport to offer any post-hoc rationalizations for the decision.  State Farm, \n22  463 U.S. at 43.  To rely on it would be circular as “a report concluding that many jurisdictions are \n23  not complying with Section 1373 does not justify imposing a condition requiring those \n24  jurisdictions to certify compliance.”  City of Philadelphia, 280 F. Supp. 3d at 624.  \n25  I have discussed why the Backgrounder is insufficient in two prior Orders.  See City & Cty. \n26  of San Francisco, 349 F. Supp. 3d at 964; see also State ex rel. Becerra v. Sessions, 284 F. Supp. \n27  3d 1015, 1032 (N.D. Cal. 2018).  To summarize the problem again, “[t]here is not a clear \n28  link…between localities keeping release dates or contact information confidential and more \n26 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-WHO   Document 60   Filed 03/04/19   Page 27 of 31\n \n1  dangerous or less safe communities.”  City & Cty. of San Francisco, 349 F. Supp. 3d at 964.  This \n2  record concerns the fiscal year 2017 conditions, so it also lacks any explanation of the new \n3  nondisclosure condition.   \n4  Next, the DOJ cites two emails to Byrne JAG grantees and state agencies for the first time \n5  in this court and contends that they show the Section 1373 certification condition was put in place \n6  to protect the exchange of information between federal, state, and local law enforcement.  AR-\n7  00392–97.  Contrary to this claim, the emails merely provide “updated guidance” on Section 1373.  \n8  Id.  There is no portion of the emails that “articulate a satisfactory explanation for [the DOJ’s] \n9  action.”  State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43. \n10  Finally, the DOJ relies on social media posts from the Oakland’s mayor to justify its \n11  imposition of fiscal year 2018 conditions.  AR-01038–39.  The posts are a new addition to the \na  12  administrative record.  They disclose that ICE “is preparing to conduct an operation in the Bay \nrt ni\nur\noo 13  Area” within the next 24 hours and provide a link for residents to click-through to understand their \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  legal rights in the event of being detained.  Id.   \nstrof \nDict  15  California asserts that there is no evidence that one disclosure is indicative of a larger \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  problem and that the nondisclosure condition is broader than what is necessary to address the \nd Srn \nee 17  problem.  I disagree with the first contention.  If the facts are as DOJ suggests, it does not need to \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  wait for a larger number of disclosures of imminent law enforcement operations to justify acting.  \n19  Treating the nondisclosure condition as a response to Mayor Schaff’s disclosure at least begins to \n20  approach what the Court in Bowman described as “a decision of less than ideal clarity [in which] \n21  the agency’s path may reasonably be discerned.” Bowman Transp., 419 U.S. at 286.  \n22  At the same time, the social media screenshots by themselves fail to explain the DOJ’s \n23  decision to impose a nondisclosure condition that has much broader scope and application than the \n24  situation that purportedly inspired the condition.  See State Farm, 463 U.S. at 50 (“It is well-\n25  established that an agency’s action must be upheld, if at all, on the basis articulated by the agency \n26  itself.”) (internal citation omitted).  Ultimately there are still “no findings and no analysis” in the \n27  administrative record “to justify the choice made” if the only document that supports a condition is \n28  a screenshot of the posts themselves.  See Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. \n27 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-WHO   Document 60   Filed 03/04/19   Page 28 of 31\n \n1  156, 167 (1962)(no support for remedy chosen by the Interstate Commerce Commission).   \n2  On this record the agency has not provided an articulated basis for the condition as drafted.  \n3  The DOJ’s justification and reliance on the social media posts without more, does not establish a \n4  “product of reasoned decision making.”  State Farm, 463 U.S. at 52.  Although I can hypothesize \n5  how a nondisclosure condition in a significantly narrower form could be a reasonable response, \n6  there is a conspicuous lack of a record surrounding why the condition was imposed in its current \n7  form, where it could be used wittingly or unwittingly as a Trojan horse for acts and interpretations \n8  of the law that this court and others across the country have enjoined.  Burlington Truck Lines, 371 \n9  U.S. 156, 168 (1962) (“courts may not accept appellate counsel’s post hoc rationalizations for \n10  agency action.”).  I cannot fill-in my own or counsel’s discretion for that of the agency.  \n11  Accordingly, I find that the challenged conditions are arbitrary and capricious under the APA.   \na  12  V.  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nrt ni\nur\noo 13  The parties raise a now familiar dispute over the scope of the injunctive relief that is \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  merited in this case.  According to principles of equity, a permanent injunction is appropriate \nstrof \nDict  15  when: (i) a plaintiff “suffered an irreparable injury;” (ii) available remedies at law are \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  “inadequate;” (iii) the “balance of hardships” between the parties supports an equitable remedy; \nd Srn \nee 17  and (iv) public interest is “not disserved.”  eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, LLC, 547 U.S. 388, 391 \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  (2006).  California and San Francisco are entitled to a permanent injunction in light of the finding \n19  that the fiscal year 2018 challenged conditions violate the separation of powers.  \n20  The remaining question is whether injunctive relief should have nationwide scope.  \n21  Because the parties have stipulated to incorporating the arguments and supporting documents from \n22  the 2017 Byrne JAG litigation, the same record that supported a permanent nationwide injunction \n23  supports one here.  Additionally, San Francisco and California provide evidence that the new \n24  fiscal year 2018 conditions apply and cause harm to jurisdictions nationwide.  See SF RJN Ex. B, \n25  Chyi Decl. Ex. C (SF), Wright Decl. Ex. C (Somerville, Massachusetts); Nair Decl., Ex. 2 \n26  (Albuquerque, New Mexico).  The conditions will continue to apply to jurisdictions without an \n27  injunction.  See Jerzyk Decl. (Central Falls, Rhode Island); Wright Decl. (Somerville, \n28  Massachusetts); Reeve Decl. (Portland, Oregon); Springer Decl. (Denver, Colorado); Pittman \n28 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-WHO   Document 60   Filed 03/04/19   Page 29 of 31\n \n1  Decl. (Seattle, Washington); Segal Decl. (Minneapolis, Minnesota); Nair Decl. (Albuquerque, \n2  New Mexico); Muhammad Decl. (Chicago, Illinois).9 \n3  The DOJ offers the three arguments against a nationwide injunction that it made in the \n4  prior related litigation.  First, it believes that plaintiffs lack standing to seek a nationwide \n5  injunction.  It asserts the plaintiffs’ “remedy must be limited to the inadequacy that produced \n6  [their] injury in fact,” and therefore a nationwide injunction here would violate Article III \n7  standing.  See Gill v. Whitford, 138 S. Ct. 1916 (2018) (rejecting standing for a statewide \n8  gerrymandering challenge because a plaintiff’s remedy must be limited to his injury).  Second, it \n9  restates the concern, of which I am mindful, that nationwide injunctions risk preventing “legal \n10  questions from percolating through the federal courts, encouraging forum shopping, and making \n11  every case a national emergency for the courts and for the Executive Branch.”  Trump v. Hawaii, \na  12  138 S. Ct. 2392, 2425 (2018) (Thomas, J., concurring).  Finally, similar litigation is pending in \nrt ni\nouor 13  other jurisdictions.  See City of Los Angeles v. Whitaker, No. 2:18-cv-07347-R-JC (C.D. Cal.); \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  City of Chicago v. Whitaker, No. 1:18-cv-06859 (N.D. Ill.); City of New York v. Whitaker, No. \nstrof \nDict  15  1:18-cv-06474-ER (S.D.N.Y.); City of Providence v. Whitaker, No. CA-18-437-JJM-LDA \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  (D.R.I.).  \nd Srn \nee 17  Neither party offers convincing reasons for me to deviate from the prior Order in the \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  related 2017 litigation.  The appropriateness of nationwide injunctive relief for the 2017 Byrne \n19  JAG conditions applies equally in 2018.  See City & Cty. of San Francisco, 349 F. Supp. 3d at 973 \n20  (granting but staying the nationwide injunction because the Ninth Circuit might disagree about the \n21  constitutionality of Section 1373 and “because the laws and practices of each ‘sanctuary’ \n22  jurisdiction differ.”).   \n23  California and San Francisco have shown that Section 1373 is unconstitutional and that \n24  there is a violation of the separation of powers, which supports nationwide relief.  City & Cty. of \n25 \n                                                 \n9 Amici 46 Counties, Cities, and Local Government Organizations further shed light on the \n26 \nbenefits of the Byrne JAG Program, as well as the far-reaching consequences of the fiscal year \n2018 challenged conditions.  See Amicus Brief (SF Dkt. No. 54).  They argue that a nationwide \n27 \ninjunction is the only remedy for local governments that are faced with the precarious decision to \nsubmit to the DOJ’s conditions or forego important funding for local programs that benefit their \n28 \ncommunities.  Id. at 10–12.  \n29 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-WHO   Document 60   Filed 03/04/19   Page 30 of 31\n \n1  San Francisco, 897 F.3d at 1232; see also Int'l Refugee Assistance Project v. Trump, 857 F.3d \n2  554, 605 (4th Cir. 2017) (finding that relief limited to the parties in suit where there was a likely \n3  constitutional violation “would not cure the constitutional deficiency, which would endure in all \n4  [its] applications.”).  As set forth above, the nondisclosure condition is defective for different \n5  reasons.  But those reasons are also applicable to jurisdictions throughout the country; no factual \n6  differences would cause a different legal conclusion.  Accordingly, I grant the injunction in favor \n7  of plaintiffs but stay its nationwide scope.  \n8  VI.  MANDAMUS RELIEF \n9  California seeks mandamus relief to compel the DOJ to issue and disburse fiscal year 2018 \n10  Byrne JAG funds without the challenged conditions.  CA FAC ¶ 138; Prayer for Relief ¶ 4.  The \n11  DOJ disputes the need for mandamus relief in a footnote, stating that it already issued fiscal year \na  12  2018 Byrne JAG awards to California and its subdivisions and has mooted this request.  However, \nrt ni\nur\noo 13  the parties agreed to an extension on the deadline for accepting the awards until after I rule on the \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  dispositive motions at issue here.  Sherman Decl., Ex. 7. \nstrof \nDict  15    Consistent with the TRAC factors traditionally used to evaluate mandamus relief, I find \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  that the facts support mandamus relief for California.  See Indep. Min. Co. v. Babbitt, 105 F.3d \nd Srn \nee 17  502, 507 (9th Cir. 1997) (citing Telecommc'ns. Research & Action v. FCC (TRAC), 750 F.2d 70, \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  79–80 (9th Cir. 1984)).  \n \n19 \n(1) the time agencies take to make decisions must be governed by a rule of reason; \n(2) where Congress has provided a timetable or other indication of the speed with \n20 \nwhich it expects the agency to proceed in the enabling statute, that statutory scheme \n21  may supply content for this rule of reason; (3) delays that might be reasonable in the \nsphere of economic regulation are less tolerable when human health and welfare are \n22  at stake; (4) the court should consider the effect of expediting delayed action on \nagency activities of a higher or competing priority; (5) the court should also take into \n23 \naccount the nature and extent of the interests prejudiced by delay; and (6) the court \nneed not find any impropriety lurking behind agency lassitude in order to hold that \n24 \nagency action is unreasonably delayed. \n25 \n750 F.2d at 80 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \n26 \nThe Byrne JAG formula grant is an annual program; delay in disbursal impacts human \n27 \nhealth and welfare dependant on the Byrne JAG funded programs.  It remains undisputed that \n28 \n30 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-05146-WHO   Document 60   Filed 03/04/19   Page 31 of 31\n \n1  California risks discontinuing its Byrne JAG programs if it loses funding.  Expediting disbursal \n2  would not prejudicially affect the federal government’s related interests in federal immigration \n3  enforcement or maintaining the confidentiality of law enforcement information.  Mandamus relief \n4  is appropriate. \n5  CONCLUSION \n6    For the reasons stated, California and San Francisco’s motions for summary judgment are \n7  GRANTED and the DOJ’s motions for partial dismissal or partial summary judgment are \n8  DENIED.  Plaintiffs shall prepare a proposed judgment and shall meet and confer with the DOJ \n9  concerning its form.  Within two weeks of this Order, the parties shall either submit a stipulated \n10  form of judgment or two competing versions, with DOJ’s proposed revisions to plaintiff’s form in \n11  track changes, along with a Joint Statement if necessary of no more than five pages in length \na  12  explaining any disagreements.  \nrt ni\nouor 13  IT IS SO ORDERED. \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  Dated:  March 4, 2019    \nstrof \nDict  15                  _______________________ \ns ri\net William H.
