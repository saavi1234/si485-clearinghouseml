    "summary": "<p>On September 7, 2018, five Oregon residents filed this class-action lawsuit against members of the Oregon Department of Transportation, the Oregon Transportation Commission, and the Oregon Department of Motor Vehicles. The plaintiffs, represented by the Oregon Law Center, sued the defendants under 42 U.S.C. §1983. They alleged that Oregon’s statewide policy of suspending drivers licenses of Oregon residents who accrued unpaid traffic fines without allowing those individuals the opportunity to demonstrate an inability to pay was a violation of those individuals’ Fourteenth Amendment Rights to due process and equal protection. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief and attorney’s fees. This case was initially assigned to Judge Anna Brown on September 10, 2018, but was re-assigned to Judge Marco Hernandez on September 14, 2018.</p><p>In the first complaint, the plaintiffs consisted of five Oregon residents who had their licenses suspended as a result of unpaid traffic debt. All alleged they were unable to pay these fines because of their individual economic situations. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on November 6, 2018. In this complaint, they added a new plaintiff: a Washington resident who had his license suspended in Oregon.</p><p>The plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction on September 7, 2018. In their motion, they asked for the plaintiffs and all others in their class to have their license suspensions for nonpayment removed. They also asked that plaintiffs and everyone else in their class receive the opportunity to demonstrate inability to pay before the defendants suspend their licenses again. Judge Hernandez rejected this motion on December 12, 2018, stating in his opinion that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on their claims. 358 F.Supp.3d 1145</p><p>Although the plaintiffs filed this lawsuit as a class action suit, for unknown reasons the plaintiffs submitted an unopposed motion to withdraw their class certification request on January 11, 2019.  This motion was granted on January 14, 2019.</p><p>The plaintiffs filed a second amended class action complaint on February 25, 2019, adding another Oregon resident as a plaintiff. On March 1, 2019, the defendants sought to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. Holding that the court had jurisdiction but the plaintiffs failed to state a claim, the court granted the motion to dismiss on May 16, 2019. Relying on the same legal analysis and discussion found in the opinion denying preliminary injunction, the court concluded that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim “because as a matter of law, the challenged statutes do not implicate a fundamental constitutional right, do not implicate a suspect classification, and are rationally related to a legitimate state interest.”  2019 WL 2251290.</p><p>The plaintiffs appealed this case on June 11, 2019 (docket number 19-35506); this case is ongoing. </p><p></p>",

See, e.g., Or. Rev. Stat.\n§§ 1.202(1), (2), 809.267, 809.380 (fee added whenever a court gives a defendant a period of\n2 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 3 of 63\nMore specifically, the six named Plaintiffs, each of whom lives on an extremely limited income\nand has had a driver's license suspended because of the inability to pay one or more traffic\nviolation fines, contend that suspending a driver's license for failure to pay traffic debt absent an\nassessment of an individual's ability to pay violates the Fourteenth Amendment of the United\nStates Constitution.  Defendants are the Director of the Oregon Department of Transportation\n(ODOT), members of the Oregon Transportation Commission, and the Administrator of ODOT's\nDriver and Motor Vehicles Division.  Collectively, they are \"the DMV.\"  Simultaneously with\nfiling the Complaint, Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction and to certify the class.  This\nOpinion addresses the preliminary injunction motion only.  At oral argument on that motion, I\ndeferred any further briefing on the class certification motion, and any other activity in the case,\nuntil resolution of the preliminary injunction motion.  \nPlaintiffs bring three claims, each alleging a violation of either due process, equal\nprotection, or both.  Because Plaintiffs fail to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits as\nto any of their claims, I deny the motion.\nBACKGROUND\nOregon, like other states, has a statutory scheme in which the failure to pay a court-\nadjudicated traffic violation fine can result in the suspension of a driver's license.  Recently, some\nstates have addressed the practice through legislation.  In California, for example, according to a\nLos Angeles Times article cited by Plaintiffs, the California Legislature passed a bill, signed by\nthe Governor in June 2017, preventing the suspension of driver's licenses because of unpaid\ntime to pay a financial obligation after its imposition; fee added when court uses a private\ncollection agency or revenue department to recover debt; fee added when a court issues a notice\nof suspension; requiring fee for post-suspension reinstatement).  \n3 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 4 of 63\nfines.2  Other states are in litigation over the practice.  E.g., Fowler v. Johnson, No. 17-11441,\n2017 WL 6379676 (E.D. Mich. Dec. 14, 2017) (challenge to Michigan statutes allowing\nsuspension of driver's licenses of individuals who fail to pay court-ordered fines, costs, fees, and\nassessments resulting from traffic violations) (\"Fowler I\")3; Robinson v. Purkey, No. 3:17-cv-\n1263, 2017 WL 4418134 (M.D. Tenn. Oct. 5, 2017) (challenge to Tennessee statutes allowing\nsuspension of driver's licenses for nonpayment of fines or costs imposed for conviction of driving\noffenses) (\"Robinson I\").4  This case, however, involves Oregon's statutory scheme.  Thus, I\n2  See \nhttp://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-driver-license-fees-20170629-story.html (also\nnoting that the law did not apply retroactively and that a related bill which would allow low-\nincome individuals who cannot afford their traffic tickets to ask a judge to lower the fine or\nsubstitute the fine with community service, was advancing through the California Legislature).\nPlaintiffs also assert that Maine has abolished the practice.  Pls.' Mot. for Pre. Inj. (\"Pls.\nMot.\") 41 n.12, ECF 2.  However, the article they rely on indicates that the legislation in Maine\nconcerned criminal fines for \"non-driving-related violations.\"  See \nhttps://bangordailynews.com/2018/07/10/politics/maine-drivers-will-not-have-licenses-suspende\nd-for-failing-to-pay-fines (reporting that Maine lawmakers were \"putting an end to the practice of\nautomatic drivers' license suspensions for failing to pay fines for most non-driving-related\nviolations\"; further describing the previous practice as: \"failure to pay a fine for a criminal\noffense and your driver's license is automatically suspended.\").  \n3  Fowler I granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs' preliminary injunction motion. \nThe defendants appealed.  No. 17-2504 (6th Cir. Dec. 19, 2017).  The district court denied the\ndefendants' request for a stay pending appeal. 2017 WL 6540926 (E.D. Mich. Dec. 19, 2017)\n(\"Fowler II\").  In February 2018, the Sixth Circuit remanded the case for the district court to\naddress the plaintiffs' standing, and the district court issued an opinion and order addressing that\nissue on April 11, 2018.   2018 WL 1737122 (E.D. Mich. Apr. 11, 2018) (\"Fowler III\").  \n4  In an October 5, 2017 decision, the court in Robinson granted a temporary restraining\norder to the plaintiffs who challenged Tennessee's practice of suspending an individual's driver's\nlicense for failure to pay \"traffic debt.\"  2017 WL 4418134 (\"Robinson I\").  In a later decision\nissued in June 2018, the court denied in part the defendants' motion to dismiss, granted the class\ncertification motion, and scheduled a hearing at a later date on the preliminary injunction motion. \n326 F.R.D. 105 (M.D. Tenn. 2018) (\"Robinson II\"), appeal filed, No. 18-6121 (6th Cir. Oct. 24,\n2018).  Meanwhile, the same district court judge handling the Robinson case issued a decision in\n4 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 5 of 63\nbegin there before turning to other evidence in the record submitted in support of, and in\nopposition to, the motion.  \nI.  Oregon's Statutory Scheme\nThe Oregon Vehicle Code defines \"traffic violation\" as \"a traffic offense that is\ndesignated as a traffic violation in the statute defining the offense, or any other offense defined in\nthe Oregon Vehicle Code that is punishable by a fine but that is not punishable by a term of\nimprisonment.\"  Or. Rev. Stat. § (O.R.S). 801.557; see also O.R.S. 153.008(1)(a), (b) (providing\ngenerally that an \"offense\" is a \"violation\" if it is \"designated as a violation by the statute\ndefining the offense,\" or the \"statute prescribing the penalty for the offense provides that the\noffense is punishable by a fine but does not provide that the offense is punishable by a term of\nimprisonment.\").  \nViolations are classified into categories.  O.R.S. 153.012 (designating categories as Class\nA, Class B, Class C, and Class D, as well as \"unclassified violations as described in O.R.S.\n153.015,\" and \"[s]pecific fine violations as described in O.R.S. 153.015.\").  \"The penalty for\ncommitting a violation is a fine.\"  O.R.S. 153.018(1).  There are maximum, presumptive, and\nminimum fines for each category of violation.  O.R.S. 153.018(2) (maximum fines); O.R.S.\n153.019 (presumptive fines); O.R.S. 153.020 (increasing presumptive fines for violations\na related case challenging Tennessee's practice of suspending an individual's driver's license for\nfailure to pay \"court debt.\"  Thomas v. Haslam, 303 F. Supp. 3d 585 (M.D. Tenn. 2018) (denying\nmotions to dismiss, ordering further briefing on summary judgment motions, granting class\ncertification motion) (\"Thomas I\").  In July 2018, the district court in the Thomas case issued a\ndecision granting summary judgment to plaintiffs and denying summary judgment to defendants. \n329 F. Supp. 3d 475 (M.D. Tenn. 2018) (\"Thomas II\"), appeal filed, No. 18-5766 (6th Cir. July\n27, 2018).  \n5 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 6 of 63\ncommitted in a highway work zone, school zone, or safety corridor); O.R.S. 153.021 (minimum\nfines).  The Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court is required to establish a uniform fine\nschedule for violations prosecuted in circuit courts. O.R.S. 153.800(4)(b).  Courts other than\ncircuit courts are required to establish schedules of the amounts of penalties to be imposed for\nfirst, second, and subsequent violations, designating each violation specifically or by class. \nO.R.S. 153.800(4)(a). \nWhen law enforcement officers issue a citation and summons to a driver for a traffic\nviolation, certain information must be included as specified in O.R.S. 153.045-153.051.  This\nincludes the amount of the presumptive fine, if there is one for the violation.  O.R.S. 153.051(4)\n(requirements of the summons).  The summons must notify the person that a monetary judgment\nmay be entered for up to the maximum amount of fines, restitution, and other costs allowed by\nlaw if the person fails to make all required appearances at proceedings.  O.R.S. 153.051(5).  And,\nthe summons must notify the person that if he or she pleads no contest and pays the presumptive\nfine, the person may submit an explanation of the circumstances of the violation and the court\nmay consider that explanation in establishing the amount of the fine, but the court cannot impose\na fine less than the statutory minimum.  O.R.S. 153.051(7).  The summons must also notify the\nperson that if the person pleads not guilty and requests a trial, the fines still cannot be less than\nthe minimum unless the person is found not guilty.  O.R.S. 153.051(8).  \nA person who has been issued a citation must make an appearance in person at the time\nindicated in the citation/summons, request a trial, or deliver payment of the presumptive fine to\nthe court.  O.R.S. 153.061(1), (3).  Circuit courts, municipal courts, and justice courts adjudicate\ntraffic violations.  In cases where the defendant pleads no contest by delivering payment of the\n6 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 7 of 63\npresumptive fine to the court under O.R.S. 153.061(3), the amount of the fine may not exceed the\npresumptive fine.  Id.  Additionally, a judge may suspend operation of any part of a judgment\nentered under the \"Violations and Fines\" chapter of the Oregon statutes upon condition that the\ndefendant pay the nonsuspended portion of a fine within a specified period of time.  O.R.S.\n153.090(4).  \nWhen a traffic violation fine remains unpaid, a court may use a private collection agency\nto seek recoupment of the debt or refer the debt to the Oregon Department of Revenue (ODOR). \nO.R.S. 1.197(1).  In addition to these options, \"[a] court may . . . (a) issue a notice of suspension\nto the [DMV] that directs the department to implement procedures under ORS 809.416[,] or (b)\n[o]rder a defendant's driving privileges restricted.\"  O.R.S. 809.210(1).  This case concerns only\n(a), the issuance of the notice of suspension.  Although an unpaid traffic violation fine allows a\ncourt to send a suspension notice to the DMV, a court is prohibited from sending a notice of\nsuspension for those who have failed to pay fines for bicycle, pedestrian, or parking offenses. \nO.R.S. 809.210(7). \nUpon receipt of the notice of suspension from a court, suspension of a driver's license by\nthe DMV is mandatory.  A person \"is subject to suspension under ORS 809.415(4) if the\ndepartment receives a notice of suspension from a court under ORS 809.210 indicating that the\nperson has failed or refused to pay a fine[.]\" O.R.S. 809.416(2).  The \"department shall suspend\ndriving privileges when provided under ORS 809.416.\"  O.R.S. 809.415(4) (emphasis added);\nsee also O.R.S. 809.210(4)(b) (providing that if the court issues a notice of suspension that\ndirects the DMV to implement procedures under O.R.S. 809.416, the DMV shall take action on\nthe suspension as provided under O.R.S. 809.416).  \n7 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 8 of 63\nA person is subject to suspension under O.R.S. 809.416(2) until one of the following\noccurs: (1) the person presents the department with a notice of reinstatement issued by the court\nshowing that the person (a) is making payments or has paid the fine; or (b) has enrolled in a\npreapprenticeship program as defined or is a registered apprentice as defined; or (2) twenty years\nhas elapsed from the date of the traffic offense.  O.R.S. 809.416(2); see also O.R.S.\n809.415(4)(a) (the mandatory suspension shall continue until the earlier of (1) the person\nestablishes that she or he has performed all acts necessary under O.R.S. 809.416 to make the\nperson not subject to suspension; or (2) twenty years from the date the traffic offense occurred if\nthe suspension is imposed for a reason described in O.R.S. 809.416(2) (failure or refusal to pay a\nfine)).  Echoing the exception in O.R.S. 809.210(7), O.R.S. 809.416(3) exempts from suspension\npersons who fail or refuse to pay a fine relating to any pedestrian, bicycle, or parking offense.  \nWhile mandatory unless excepted under O.R.S. 809.416(2)(a) or (b), the suspension does\nnot take effect immediately.  Instead, the department, upon receipt of a notice of suspension from\na court, must send a letter by first class mail advising the person that suspension will begin sixty\ndays from the date of the letter unless the department is presented with a notice of reinstatement\nby the court under O.R.S. 809.416(2)(a).  O.R.S. 809.416(3); see also O.R.S. 809.210(4)(a)\n(providing that if the court issues a notice of suspension that directs the DMV to implement\nsuspension procedures under O.R.S. 809.416, and if at any time within the period of suspension,\na person pays the fine or has begun making payments according to the payment schedule\nestablished with the court, the court shall immediately send to the department a notice of\nreinstatement; further stating that the notice of suspension may be reissued if the person ceases\nmaking payments before the fine is paid in full).  \n8 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 9 of 63\nA person whose license has been suspended under O.R.S. 809.415(4)(a) is entitled to\nadministrative review under O.R.S. 809.440.  O.R.S. 809.415(4)(b).  This review is an \"informal\nadministrative process to assure prompt and careful review by the department of the documents\nupon which an action is based.\"  O.R.S. 809.440(2)(a).  A person may defend against the \ndepartment's action by showing (1) that the conviction did not involve a motor vehicle and the\ndepartment's action is permitted only if the offense involves a motor vehicle; (2) an out-of-state\nconviction on which the department's action is based was for an offense that is not comparable to\nan offense under Oregon law; or (3) the records relied on by the department identify the wrong\nperson.  O.R.S. 809.440(2)(b).  Judicial review of a department order affirming a suspension is\nallowed.  O.R.S. 809.440(2)(e).  \nThe statutes do not appear to address the contents of the sixty-day notice sent by the\nDMV.  However, the preliminary injunction record contains copies of such notices sent to\nseveral of the Plaintiffs.  First, a sixty-day notice was sent to Plaintiff Gloria Bermudez on\nOctober 7, 2013 and makes clear that her driving privileges will be suspended beginning at 12:01\nAM on December 6, 2013.  Bermudez Decl., Ex. 2, ECF 4-2.  The information in the notice is\ncomprehensive and includes information indicating that the suspension can be prevented by\ncontacting the applicable court.  It states, at various places in the notice:\nTo prevent this suspension you must make certain the action required below is\ncompleted and received by DMV no later than 5:00 pm on the last business day\nprior to December 06, 2013.  \n* * * \nYou can stop this suspension by contacting the court named below and\ncompleting all the requirements necessary to clear this matter.  If we receive a\nclearance notice from the court before the date the suspension begins, this\n9 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 10 of 63\nsuspension will not go into effect.  \nId.  The notice urges the recipient to contact the court as soon as possible.  Id.  It states that no\nhardship permit is available.  Id.  It also informs the recipient of the right to administrative\nreview, how to obtain that review, and what the department will review.  Id. (\"In this review we\nwill look at our records and the documents concerning this matter to determine if we took\nappropriate action\" and further stating that the DMV will review the person's evidence to\ndetermine if \"you are the same person\" named on the notice from the court, if the DMV received\nnotice from the court that you failed to pay a fine, and if the DMV received a clearance notice\nfrom the court).  \nNext, a notice dated October 27, 2016 was sent to Plaintiff Cekais Toni Ganuelas. \nGanuelas Decl., Ex. 1, ECF 6-1.  It indicates the date and reason for the suspension.  Id.  It also\nstates that the suspension will last until the DMV receives a \"court clearance (notice of\nreinstatement) or 20 years have elapsed from the date the traffic offense(s) occurred.\"  Id.  A\nseparate section provides: \nCAN I STOP THIS SUSPENSION?\nTo stop the suspension, DMV must receive a court clearance.  Contact the court to\ndetermine how to obtain a court clearance for the docket(s) shown.  You will find\ncourt contact information on DMV's website.\nId.  The notice provides additional information on the right to obtain an administrative review,\nhow to obtain that review, and what the DMV will consider.  Id.  Notices identical to the one sent\nto Ganuelas were issued to Plaintiff Cindy Mendoza on July 29, 2015, and to Plaintiff Karl Wade\nRoberts on July 6, 2018.  Mendoza Decl., Ex. 2, ECF 8-2; Roberts Decl., Ex. 1, ECF 9-1.  \nEven if suspension has begun, a court may still issue a notice of reinstatement and the\n10 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 11 of 63\nsuspension will be terminated.  E.g., Bermudez Decl., Ex. 2 (\"You can stop this suspension after\nit begins by meeting the court's requirements and obtaining a court clearance notice.\"; \"If we\nreceive the clearance notice on or after the date the suspension begins, you will have to pay a\nreinstatement fee to DMV[.]\"); Ganuelas Decl., Ex. 1 (\"If DMV receives the court clearance after\nthe suspension begins, you will have to pay a DMV reinstatement fee.\"). \nII.  Plaintiffs' Suspensions & Personal Circumstances\nEach of the six named Plaintiffs currently has a suspended license for failure to pay traffic\ndebt.  Bermudez Decl. ¶ 6; Ganuelas Decl. ¶ 3, ECF 6; Heath Decl. ¶¶ 5, 6, ECF 7; Mendoza\nDecl. ¶ 5, ECF 8; Roberts Decl. ¶ 6, ECF 9; Chase Decl. ¶ 12, ECF 34.  Some have had multiple\nsuspensions over many years.  E.g., Bermudez Decl. ¶¶ 8, 10 (license suspended in 2003 and\nagain in 2014); Heath Decl. ¶¶ 5, 6 (license suspended in 1995 and has received six notices of\nsuspension since then); Mendoza Decl. ¶¶ 5, 7, 13 (license suspended in 2010, again in 2016, and\nexpects another as a result of unpaid fines).  \nThe underlying violations which resulted in fines include (1) failing to obey a traffic\ncontrol device, failing to use proper child seats, driving with expired tags, driving while using a\ncell phone; Bermudez Decl. ¶¶ 8, 9, 10, 13; (2) failing to display plates or illegal display of\nplates; Ganuelas Decl. ¶ 3; Roberts Decl. ¶ 6; (3) speeding; Ganuelas Decl. ¶ 4; Mendoza Decl. ¶\n7; Chase Decl. ¶¶ 7, 8; and (4) failing to appear at arraignment for misdemeanor traffic case\ninvolving a car accident with property damage only; Mendoza Decl. ¶ 12.  Additionally,\nPlaintiffs have received citations, and thus fines, for driving with a suspended license.  E.g.,\nBermudez Decl. ¶¶ 10, 13; Ganuelas Decl. ¶ 5; Mendoza Decl. ¶¶ 5, 6; Roberts Decl. ¶ 6.  \nSome Plaintiffs have attempted to work out payment plans.  Bermudez states that she was\n11 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 12 of 63\ncited in 2003 for failing to obey a traffic control device.  Bermudez Decl. ¶ 8; id., Ex. 1 (copy of\ncitation).  Because she failed to appear at her arraignment and apparently did not pay the\npresumptive fine, her license was suspended in May 2003.  Id. ¶ 8.  The debt was sent to\ncollections but the court later set up a payment plan, allowing her license to be reinstated in 2010. \nId.  However, she could not keep up with the $50/month payments and her license was\nsuspended again in 2012.  Id.  In July 2012, Bermudez was cited for several violations.  Id. ¶ 13. \nShe worked out a payment plan with the court.  Id. ¶ 15; id., Ex. 3.  She was to pay $75 per\nmonth, on the 24th of each month, until the total of $435 was paid.  Id.  On August 24, 2012, the\ndate her first payment was due, she wrote a letter to the court explaining that she could not make\nthe payment because she just had a premature baby.  Id., Ex. 4.  A handwritten note dated the\nsame day states \"allow 30 days extra.\"  Id.  However, she still could not make the payments.  Id.\n¶ 13.  She states that her license was suspended in 2013 as a result.  Id. \nSince 2012, Ganuelas has been cited at least three times for driving with a suspended\nlicense.  Ganuelas Decl. ¶ 5.  On one of those occasions, in 2015, she was offered a payment plan\nfor the $485 owed.  Id. ¶ 20.  She made $50 monthly payments for a time but was unable to pay a\n$160 balance at which point the court notified the DMV which suspended her license.  Id.  Heath\nstates that \"various courts have forced me into payment plans that I couldn't afford.\"  Heath Decl.\n¶ 8.  Most required her to make a minimum $50 monthly payment. Id.  Most recently, the\nPendleton Municipal Court imposed that requirement on her.  Id.  She began making $20\nmonthly payments instead, which subjected her to a show cause hearing during which the court\nagreed to allow her to continue making $20 monthly payments.  Id. \nMendoza does not remember being offered a payment plan for traffic debt owed to the\n12 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 13 of 63\nBeaverton or Milwaukie Municipal Courts.  Mendoza Decl. ¶¶ 9.  She currently is on a payment\nplan for traffic debt owed to Clackamas County Circuit Court, but she has missed some of the\n$100 monthly payments and that court has now sent the debt to collections.  Id. ¶¶ 12, 13.  She\nexpects that the court will send a suspension notice to the DMV which will suspend her license. \nId.  Roberts states that at one point, he made payments to the Baker County Justice Court but\nsince then, he has acquired more traffic tickets which he cannot pay off with his limited income. \nRoberts Decl. ¶ 7.  It is his belief that the Baker County Justice Court will not ask the DMV to\nlift his suspension unless he is able to make $50 monthly payments to that court.  Id. ¶ 10.  \nChase was offered payment plans in Gilliam and Sherman County Justice Courts when he\nexplained he could not pay the fines and fees for speeding citations.  Chase Decl. ¶¶ 7, 8. \nHowever, each county told him the longest term possible was twelve months which resulted in a\nmonthly payment more than he could afford.  Id.  Both of the debts were eventually sent to\ncollections.  Id. ¶ 10.  He also received traffic violations in 2006 and 2008 in Beaverton.  Id. ¶ 11. \nConsistent with what he was told by the Gilliam and Sherman County Justice Courts, the\nBeaverton Municipal Court also told him that a payment plan was available, but it could not\nextend beyond twelve months.  Id. This debt was also assigned to a private debt collector.  Id.\nChase worked out payment plans with the private collection agencies beginning in 2013 to pay\noff the debts to the Gilliam and Sherman County Justice Courts.  Id. ¶¶ 15-17.  Both of those\ndebts have been discharged.  Id.  He has attempted to negotiate a payment plan with the\nBeaverton Municipal Court but was told that because the debt had been referred to a private\ncollection agency, the debt was \"out of house\" and he could not meet with a judge.  Id. ¶¶ 18-19.  \nThe private collection agency has refused to enter into a payment plan extending longer than\n13 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 14 of 63\ntwelve months which would result in monthly payments greater than $100, an amount Chase\ncannot afford.  Id. ¶ 20.  Nonetheless, in January 2018, Chase began to pay the debt collection\nagency $75 per month and then $50 per month beginning in April 2018.  Id. ¶ 22.  At $50 per\nmonth, it will take him more than two more years to pay the debt in full at which point he can get\nhis license reinstated.  Id.  \nSeveral Plaintiffs state that the DMV never inquired about an ability to pay the traffic\ndebt before suspending a license.  Bermudez Decl. ¶ 16 (stating that before each suspension, no\none from the DMV or any court asked if she was able to pay the debt); Mendoza Decl. ¶ 10\n(same); Ganuelas Decl. ¶ 24 (no one from the DMV asked about ability to pay before suspending\nlicense); Heath Decl. ¶ 7 (same); Roberts Decl. ¶ 11 (same); Chase Decl. ¶ 13 (same).  Plaintiffs\nfurther state that if given the chance to avoid suspension by explaining an inability to pay, he or\nshe would have done so.  Bermudez Decl. ¶ 16; Ganuelas Decl. ¶ 24; Heath Decl. ¶ 7; Mendoza\nDecl. ¶ 10; Roberts Decl. ¶ 11; Chase Decl ¶ 13.  \nBy any measurable standard, each Plaintiff is impoverished.  All live on very limited\nincomes.  Bermudez Decl. ¶¶ 3-5 (single parent of four children; works as a cook in a shopping\nmall restaurant earning $14 per hour; receives $420 per month in food stamps); Ganuelas Decl.\n¶¶ 2, 6, 7, 8  (single parent of one child; lost job in July 2018 where she earned $400 per week;\nnow earns $140 per month teaching yoga; has received $117 per week in child support but father\nof child stopped paying two months ago); Heath Decl. ¶ 3 (receives $750 per month in social\nsecurity disability; four times per year receives $400 in casino dividends from the Confederated\nTribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation but receipt of casino dividends results in a\ncorresponding reduction in social security payments; receives $189 per month in food stamps;\n14 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 15 of 63\nhas not maintained regular employment since 1997); Mendoza Decl. ¶¶ 2-4 (unemployed single\nparent of three children; recently moved to subsidized two-bedroom apartment but previously\nspent four months living in a motel room and in a homeless shelter; receives approximately\n$1,100 monthly in assistance, including food stamps); Roberts Decl. ¶¶ 3-4 (lives with wife and\neach receive $562 per month in social security income; has not had substantial paid work since\nMarch 2003 due to disabilities); Chase Decl. ¶ 2 (receives $817 per month in social security\ndisability and approximately $190 per month in food stamp with no other sources of income).  \nPlaintiffs struggle to obtain basic life necessities such as housing and food, and some\nhave medical issues and are on disability.  Bermudez Decl. ¶ 5 (earnings not enough to support\nher family resulting in struggles to pay monthly electric, gas, and phone bills; often seeks free\nfood at food pantries at end of the month); Ganuelas Decl. ¶ 10 (recently moved from apartment\nto renting a room from a friend because the apartment rent was too high); Heath Decl. ¶ 3, 12 (on\ndisability; homeless for seven years until December 2017); Mendoza Decl. ¶ 4 (assistance and\nfood stamp amounts not enough to support family requiring her to find free boxes at food\npantries every month); Roberts Decl. ¶¶ 3-5 (disabled for several years; social security income\nreceived by Roberts and his wife not enough for the family with no money left after paying bills\nand buying groceries); Chase Decl. ¶¶ 2, 14 (disabled since 2009).\nRegardless of residence in an urban or rural community, each Plaintiff describes the\ndifficulties of life without the ability to drive a car.  For example, Bermudez, who lives in\nPortland, explains that she still drives because it cuts her work commute from one hour on the\nbus to twenty-five minutes by car, and given her children's needs, she cannot afford the extra\ntime on the bus.  Bermudez Decl. ¶ 20.  She drives her children to school in five to ten minutes to\n15 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 16 of 63\nspare them an hour-long bus ride starting at 6:45 a.m. which would cause sleep deprivation with\nnegative health and learning impacts.  Id. ¶ 21.  She buys groceries by car because of the amount\nof food needed for a family of five.  Id. ¶ 22.  Each day without a driver's license makes it hard\nfor her to shop for groceries, take her children to school, get to medical appointments, and get to\nwork.  Id. ¶ 24.  \nGanuelas recently moved from Pendleton to Mission, about six miles away, because\nPendleton's rent was too high.  Ganuelas Decl. ¶¶ 2, 10.  Before she moved, her job as a\nbartender was one mile away and she walked, even though she had to cross a busy four-lane\nhighway and walking home from her late-night shift made her feel unsafe.  Id. ¶ 9.  After\nmoving, she had to pay a friend to take her to work or use a taxi.  Id. ¶ 10.  In July 2018, she lost\nher bartending job because she missed a shift.  Id. ¶ 7.  She had gone away with friends who\ndecided to stay longer than planned.  Id.  This left her with no way to return.  Id.  No one would\nlend her a car given that her license was suspended.  Id.  She was fired at the end of the pay\nperiod for failing to show up for her shift.  Id.  Ganuelas can use a tribal shuttle to get from\nMission to Pendleton but it runs only six days per week from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. and thus, was not\nan option when she still was bartending.  Id. ¶ 11.  Not having a license makes it difficult for her\nto provide for herself and her daughter.  Id. ¶ 12.  To buy groceries, clothes, and necessary\nhousehold goods, she has to find a ride and pay $10 each way.  Id.  Her daughter has been unable\nto play on a youth soccer team because Ganuelas lacks a reliable way to get her to practices and\ngames.  Id. ¶ 13.  Ganuelas has missed events at her daughter's school because of her inability to\ndrive.  Id. ¶ 14.  It is difficult for her to visit extended family in Washington, Alaska, and other\nparts of Oregon without a car.  Id. ¶ 15.  \n16 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 17 of 63\nHeath explains that when she last worked, in 1997, she walked five and one-half miles\neach way because her license was suspended.  Heath Decl. ¶¶ 4, 5.  She lives in Pendleton,\nwhere, she states, the public transportation is slow and limited.  Id. ¶ 10.  There are no ride-\nhailing services such as Uber or Lyft.  Id.  Taxis are expensive.  Id.  Because of her suspension,\nshe has had to pay expensive cab fares, walk long distances in hot, cold, and wet weather, and\ntake slow public transit systems.  Id. ¶ 11.  She has missed funeral services for family members\nand tribal events.  Id.  Walking is difficult for her because she gets exhausted and experiences\nsoreness in her back, legs, and feet, but without a driver's license, she has to walk long distances\nevery day.  Id. ¶ 16.  \nMendoza lives in Portland and has had difficulty finding a job without a valid driver's\nlicense.  Mendoza Decl. ¶¶ 2, 4, 21.  She still drives occasionally to get her children to medical\nappointments, to buy clothes and school supplies, and to access food pantries.  Id. ¶¶ 17-19.  She\ntries to take the bus or light rail but for groceries, food pantries, and medical appointments, she\nrelies on her car.  Id. ¶ 20.  Uber and Lyft are too expensive for her.  Id. \nRoberts lives in Baker City where there is very little public transportation.  Roberts Decl.\n¶ 17.  His wife also does not have a driver's license and needs transportation to frequent medical\nappointments required by a health condition.  Id. ¶ 16.  He tries to avoid driving but still does so\non a limited basis because he does not see an alternative in Baker City given his and his wife's\nhealth issues.  Id. ¶ 18.  He has ridden his bicycle as an alternative, even through the harsh Baker\nCity winters, to purchase groceries but as he has aged, it has become more difficult and his\ndoctor has now advised against it for health reasons.  Id. ¶ 15.  It is \"pretty much impossible\" to\nfish and hunt or to visit his adult children in Idaho and Missouri without a car.  Id. ¶¶ 13, 14. \n17 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 18 of 63\nFinally, Chase, who lives in Vancouver, Washington, states that he uses public\ntransportation to get around, but the inability to drive is still a hardship.  Chase Decl. ¶ 25.  Using\npublic transportation in the Vancouver-Portland area typically takes ninety minutes and two\ntransfers with trains and buses often delayed.  Id. He has been stranded multiple times.  Id. \nHaving a driver's license would make it much easier to take care of basic life necessities such as\nbuying groceries and going to medical appointments.  Id.  Without the ability to drive, he does\nnot feel like a full participant in society.  Id. ¶ 26.  \nDefendants do not dispute that Plaintiffs' traffic debt remains unpaid only because they\ncannot afford to pay it, not because of a willful refusal to pay.  Defendants do not dispute\nPlaintiffs' descriptions of their economic, social, or employment circumstances or how the loss of\ntheir driver's licenses for nonpayment of traffic debt has contributed to their poverty and added\nchallenges to their lives.  Defendants do not dispute that the ability to drive a car plays a central\nrole in one's life, whether living in a large metropolitan area, a small city, or a rural area.  Thus, I\nrely on these facts, which are supported by Declarations and undisputed by Defendants, in this\nOpinion.\nIII.  Judicial Officers' Adjudication of Traffic Violations & Fine Impositions\nThree judges of municipal or justice courts submitted Declarations explaining Oregon's\nstatutory scheme for traffic debt and how each carries forth his or her duties in that regard.  Judge\nJad Lemhouse, a Justice of the Peace for the Linn County Justice of the Peace District 4A,\nregularly conducts proceedings on traffic offenses, both misdemeanor crimes and violation\noffenses.  Lemhouse Decl. ¶ 2, ECF 25.  He states that in his experience, \"most judges in Oregon\nare willing to work with people to get them out of the system.\"  Lemhouse Decl. ¶ 16.  But, he\n18 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 19 of 63\nexplains, a person must appear in court and follow the court's directions and procedures \"for that\nto happen.\"  Id.  \nWhen a person with a suspended license comes into Lemhouse's court for a driving while\nsuspended violation, he talks to the person about whether the person wants to get her or his\ndriving privileges reinstated.  Id. ¶ 12.  If the person does, he defers sentencing and discusses\nwhat is required for reinstatement and what kind of timeline is necessary to accomplish certain\ntasks such as contacting each of the courts to which the person owes a fine to try and make\npayment arrangements, contacting the state support enforcement division to address the person's\nunpaid child support, if any, and contacting five or six insurance agents to ascertain the cost of\nobtaining insurance.  Id.  Lemhouse works with the person to schedule proposed payments to the\ncourts or the support enforcement division along with the monthly insurance cost.  Id. ¶ 13.  At\nthis point, the person can show each of the courts that he or she is seriously making an effort.  Id. \nIf necessary, Lemhouse writes to the judge or judges in question supporting the person's\nproposal.  Id.; see also id., Attach. A.  With this process, Lemhouse reports that more than half of\nthe individuals succeed.  Id.  Lemhouse allows equitable relief from judgment when a person has\nmade twenty-four consecutive payments on their payment plans and has received no new\nconvictions in that period.  Id. ¶ 15.  If those requirements are successfully completed, any\nremaining fine balance is remitted in full.  Id.  \nJudge Karen Brisbin is a Municipal Judge for the City of Sandy and a Justice of the Peace\nfor Clackamas County Justice Court.  Brisbin Decl. ¶ 1, ECF 26.  She hears traffic violation\ncases and states that when a fine is imposed, the person may pay in full or set up a payment plan. \nId. ¶ 2.  The monthly payment may be different for each person based on the ability to pay.  Id.  If\n19 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 20 of 63\nthe person is unable to make a payment after the payment plan is set, and the person is in contact\nwith the court, the court will work with the person to assure compliance with the court's order. \nId.  In such cases, the person may be allowed to skip a monthly payment or reduce the amount of\nthe monthly payment until the person can get back to work.  Id.  She states: \"The key is to keep\nin contact with the court.\"  Id.  \nWhen individuals do not appear or do not contact the court, or fail to continue to make\ntheir payments as part of a payment plan, and when the court \"cannot get the convicted person's\nattention for compliance,\" the court will issue the notice of suspension to the DMV to initiate\nsuspension procedures.  Id. ¶ 3.  Once the DMV sends the sixty-day suspension notice, the\nperson can contact the court and get into compliance by paying the fine or setting up a payment\nplan.  Id.  This allows the person to entirely avoid the license suspension and the DMV\nreinstatement fee.  Id.  Even post-suspension, the person can obtain reinstatement by working\nwith the court to pay the fine via a payment plan.  Id.  According to Brisbin, \"[p]ersons may\nprovide a letter to the judge stating their financial hardship along with documentation to resolve\nthe license suspension.\"  Id.  Brisbin observes that the notice of suspension issued by the DMV\n\"often . . . works so that the person contacts the court who then works with the person to\nfacilitate payment of the fine.  The system would not work nearly as well without the suspension\nprovisions in the statute.\"  Id. ¶ 4.  \nFinally, Judge Kathy Stinnett is a Justice of the Peace for Grant County and is the\nPresident of the Oregon Justice of the Peace Association. Stinnett Decl. ¶ 1, ECF 35.  There are\ntwenty-eight justices of the peace who preside in twenty-eight justice courts.  Id. ¶ 1.  They heard\n125,918 traffic violation cases in the 2017-18 fiscal year.  Id.  She submits her Declaration on\n20 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 21 of 63\nbehalf of the Association.  Id. After explaining how traffic violation cases come to courts and\nwhat options the individual has upon receiving a violation, she states that \"[j]udges are aware\nthat the purpose of a traffic fine is to get the attention of the driver to change or reinforce driving\nbehavior consistent with the rules of the road in Oregon for traffic safety.\"  Id. ¶ 4.  \nAccording to Stinnett, a person may pay the fine in full or set a payment plan with the\ncourt.  Id.  She observes that \"[c]ourts routinely work with individuals regarding payment of\nfines.\"  Id. ¶ 5.  When payments are missed, the court may reach out to the person by letter or\ntelephone.  Id.  If the person is in contact with the court, the court will review the individual\ncircumstances to determine how, when, and if the fine will be paid.  Id.  In cases where a\nsuspension is initiated for failure to pay the fine, in \"numerous cases\" the person contacts the\ncourt within the sixty-day period and works with the court to pay the fine or get back on track\nwith the payment plan.  Id. ¶ 7.  Courts also work with persons after suspension.  Id.  She states\nthat the license suspension is an important tool used by courts when working with persons who\nowe traffic debt.

Given that\nStinnett's Declaration is submitted on behalf of the Oregon Justice of the Peace Association, it is\nunclear if Plaintiffs would make the same objection to her characterization of how justice courts\nhandle traffic violation fines and debt.  \n21 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 22 of 63\ntheir peers.  Assuming that is the case and thus, that they rely on out-of-court statements for the\ntruth of the matter asserted, the evidence may be inadmissible hearsay.  However, \"the rules of\nevidence do not apply strictly to preliminary injunction proceedings\" given the urgency of\nobtaining an injunction and the limited factual development that has occurred.  Herb Reed\nEnters, LLC v. Fla. Entm't Mgmt., Inc., 736 F.3d 1239, 1250 n.5 (9th Cir. 2013).  \"[I]n deciding a\nmotion for a preliminary injunction, the Court has broad discretion to consider all arguments and\nevidence, including hearsay and other inadmissible evidence, [and] declarations from interested\nparties[.]\"  Brinton Bus. Ventures, Inc. v. Searle, 248 F. Supp. 3d 1029, 1032 (D. Or. 2017)\n(citing Johnson v. Couturier, 572 F.3d 1067, 1083 (9th Cir. 2009); Lane v. Dep't of Interior, 523\nF.3d 1128, 1140 (9th Cir. 2008)).  Thus, even assuming that the Declarations are based on\npotential inadmissible hearsay, the statements are appropriately considered for the purposes of\nthis motion.  \nIV.  Oregon's Scheme in Law & in Practice\nOregon courts adjudicate traffic violations.  Punishment for a traffic violation is a fine.\nCitations give notice of the court date and time that the violator must appear to address the\ncitation.  Some violators do not wish to contest guilt and are willing and able to pay the assessed\nfine, which is the presumptive fine as set by the Oregon Legislature.  This may be accomplished\nwithout a formal court appearance.  Otherwise, the violator must appear.  The statutes addressing\nthe contents of citations and summonses do not require that the violator be told that even when\nguilt is admitted, a payment plan may be worked out in cases of indigency or that failure to pay\ncould result in suspension of a license.\nThe statutes also do not require that an Oregon court assessing a fine for a traffic\n22 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 23 of 63\nviolation notify the violator of the possibility of a payment plan for the fine.  Nonetheless, several\nOregon courts, as demonstrated by the judicial officers' Declarations as well as the Declarations\nof several Plaintiffs, do consider a person's indigency and will offer a payment plan.  Whether\nthis occurs frequently, regularly, occasionally, or otherwise is unclear.  The evidence indicates\nthat each time a Plaintiff requested an initial payment plan from a court, he or she was given\none.6  It may not have been one that suited the Plaintiff's ability to pay, for example when Chase\nwas told the fine had to be paid over twelve months making for untenable monthly payments, but\na payment plan was initially offered. \nWhile the statutes provide for a minimum fine for each type of violation, they also\nprovide that a judge may suspend any part of the judgment, including the fine, \"upon condition\nthat the defendant pay the nonsuspended portion of a fine within a specified period of time.\" \nO.R.S. 153.090(4).  This suggests that judges have flexibility to work with a violator so that the\ntotal fine paid may be less than the minimum statutory fine.  In fact, Judge Lemhouse notes that\nhe remits the unpaid portion of a fine upon completion of his requirements of consecutive\npayments of twenty-four months with no new violations.  \nThe lack of consistency among the courts in whether they affirmatively account for\nviolators' indigency and notify violators of the possibility and terms of a payment plan is\ntroubling.  What may benefit a violator in one jurisdiction may be unavailable in another. \nCertainly, the statutes do not prohibit a court from offering a payment plan or from accounting\nfor an individual's financial circumstances.  But, the statutes undisputably do not require a court\n6  Some Plaintiffs do not recall a payment plan being offered but the record shows that\nwhen a Plaintiff requested a payment plan, one was given. \n23 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 24 of 63\nto make an assessment of an individual violator's ability to pay a fine and structure a fine and\npayment plan accordingly.  \nIt is also clear that the suspension of a driver's license is within the discretion of the court. \nThe statute unambiguously states that when a fine is unpaid, the \"court may . . . issue a notice of\nsuspension to the [DMV] that directs the department to implement procedures under ORS\n809.416[.]\"  O.R.S. 809.210(1)(a) (emphasis added).  It is not mandatory for the court to issue\nthe notice.  However, once issued, it is mandatory for the DMV to suspend the license after\nissuing the sixty-day suspension notice when no reinstatement order from the court is received by\nthe DMV before the sixty-day period expires.  In contrast to the discretion afforded the court,\nthere is no discretion for the DMV.  \nThe sixty-day notices in the record expressly direct the recipients to the court to address\nthe outstanding fine, but they fail to mention anything about options if one is unable to pay. \nWhile the statute contemplates that the court has the authority to work out a payment plan at that\npoint, or even after suspension has begun, the sixty-day notices do not specifically inform the\nrecipients that a payment plan may be an option.  Instead, recipients are told that they can stop\nthe suspension by contacting the court and \"completing all the requirements necessary to clear\nthis matter,\" or by \"meeting the court's requirements.\"  In the more recent version of the notices,\nthe recipient is told to \"[c]ontact the court to determine how to obtain a court clearance for the\ndocket(s) shown.\"  Unless one knows to ask for a payment plan, it may not occur to a person\nreceiving the sixty-day notice that anything other than full payment is possible.  Nonetheless, it is\nundisputed that based on the examples of the sixty-day notices in the record, notice recipients are\nclearly informed to contact the court to address the matter.  \n24 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 25 of 63\nThe judicial officers' Declarations indicate that some courts do not always exercise their\ndiscretion to send a suspension notice to the DMV without first attempting to contact the person\nand assess the situation.  Courts may use the threatened suspension as leverage to obtain\ncompliance with a payment plan or to at least initiate a conversation about options.  And, some\ncourts remain open to such a discussion during the sixty-day period or after suspension is\neffective.  \nFinally, it is undisputed that the statutes do not provide for the DMV to consider an\nindividual's ability to pay before suspending a driver's license for failure to pay traffic debt.  \nSTANDARDS\nA party seeking a preliminary injunction \"must establish that he is likely to succeed on\nthe merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the\nbalance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.\"  Winter v.\nNatural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  The plaintiff \"must establish that\nirreparable harm is likely, not just possible[.]\"  Alliance For The Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632\nF.3d 1127, 1131 (9th Cir. 2011).  The court may apply a sliding scale test, under which \"the\nelements of the preliminary injunction test are balanced, so that a stronger showing of one\nelement may offset a weaker showing of another.\"  Id.  Thus, a  party seeking an injunction may\nshow greater irreparable harm as the probability of success on the merits decreases.  Id. (noting\nalso that the relevant test in the Ninth Circuit is described as the \"serious questions\" test where\nthe likelihood of success is such that \"serious questions going to the merits were raised and the\nbalance of hardships tips sharply in plaintiff's favor\") (internal quotation marks and brackets\nomitted).  \n25 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 26 of 63\nThe party requesting a preliminary injunction must carry its burden of persuasion by a\n\"clear showing\" of the four required elements set forth above.

Nature of the Claims and the Injunctive Relief Sought\nA.  First Amended Complaint\nPlaintiffs bring three claims.  The first relies on the \"fundamental fairness\" concept of\nsubstantive due process and equal protection as explained by the Supreme Court in cases such as\nGriffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12 (1956), and Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660 (1983).  First Am.\nCompl. ¶¶ 207-212, ECF 38.  Plaintiffs contend that under Griffin, \"states must provide an\nevaluation of ability to pay to assess an individual's indigence prior to [] taking any measures that\ncould result in any additional punishment beyond that imposed upon financially solvent\nindividuals.\"  Id. ¶ 210; see also id. ¶ 211 (citing Bearden and alleging that the \"Fourteenth\nAmendment's Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses prohibit punishing individuals for non-\npayment without first determining that they had the ability to pay and willfully refused to make a\nmonetary payment.\").  The \"gist\" of this claim, according to Plaintiffs, \"is that the Fourteenth\nAmendment prohibits a government from treating indigent defendants worse than non-indigent\ndefendants, because of their poverty.\"  Pls.' Reply 14.  \nIn their second claim, Plaintiffs rely only on the Equal Protection Clause.  Id. ¶¶ 213-15. \n27 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 28 of 63\nSpecifically, they rely on James v. Strange, 407 U.S. 128 (1972), to contend that the state may\nnot distinguish indigent traffic debt debtors from other indigent debtors.  Id.  They assert that\nunder Strange, equal protection principles are violated by statutes which result in the DMV\ntreating indigent traffic debtors worse than indigent debtors who commit bicycle, pedestrian, or\nparking offenses, private debtors with delinquent credit card debt, and child support debtors.  Id.\n¶ 215; see also Pls.' Mot. 32 (\"Under Strange, ORS § 809.416 is unconstitutional because it\nempowers the DMV to treat indigent traffic debtors worse than other kinds of indigent debtors.\"). \n  The third claim is a procedural due process claim.  Id. ¶¶ 216-18.  Plaintiffs allege that\nthey have property and liberty interests in their driver's licenses and their ability to drive legally. \nId. ¶ 217.  They assert that Defendants violate their procedural due process rights by suspending\ntheir driver's licenses without affording them a pre-suspension or post-suspension hearing to\ndetermine if they are able or unable to pay their traffic debt.  Id. \nPlaintiffs seek both declaratory and injunctive relief.  Id. § X.  They seek a declaration\nthat Defendants' practices with respect to the suspension of driver's licenses as alleged have\nviolated and continue to violate the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the\nConstitution.  Id. § X(b).  They seek injunctive relief in the form of an order (1) prohibiting\nDefendants from suspending Plaintiffs' and class members' driver's licenses for unpaid traffic\ndebt until such time as the DMV and the State of Oregon implement a system that complies with\nthe Constitution; and (2) requiring Defendants to remove Plaintiffs' and class members'\nsuspensions for nonpayment of traffic debt that were effected before the date of judgment, and as\npart of that removal, prohibiting Defendants from requiring Plaintiffs and class members to pay\nreinstatement fees as a condition of reinstatement.  Id.; see also X(c), (d).  \n28 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 29 of 63\nB.  Preliminary Injunction Motion\nIn the preliminary injunction motion, Plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction (1)\ncompelling Defendants to remove the license suspensions on Plaintiffs' licenses for nonpayment\nof their traffic debt under O.R.S. 809.416 and, if Plaintiffs are then eligible for reinstatement of\ntheir licenses, compelling Defendants to waive the reinstatement and issuance fees under O.R.S.\n870.370; and (2) ordering Defendants to refrain from suspending Plaintiffs' licenses for failure to\npay their traffic debt unless and until Plaintiffs have had the opportunity to demonstrate their\ninability to pay, entitling them to be exempt from suspension, through a procedure that comports\nwith due process.\nAs I understand the injunctive relief sought in the motion, Plaintiffs do not seek only the\nopportunity to demonstrate their inability to pay the outstanding traffic debt.  They seek as well\nan order from this Court requiring the DMV to exempt them from paying the outstanding debt\nupon a determination that they are indigent and cannot pay the debt.  Additionally, they seek an\norder requiring the DMV to reinstate their driver's licenses at this point, notwithstanding the\noutstanding debt, and without a reinstatement fee.  \nDefendants argue that the injunctive relief sought is mandatory because Plaintiffs seek to\nalter rather than preserve the status quo.  Plaintiffs contend the requested relief is prohibitory but\neven if any portion of it is considered mandatory, they have demonstrated the strength of their\nclaims.  \nAn injunction preventing future unconstitutional conduct is \"a classic form of prohibitory\ninjunction.\"  Hernandez, 872 F.3d at 998.  Thus, in Hernandez, the requested preliminary\ninjunctive relief preventing the defendant from conducting future initial bond hearings under\n29 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 30 of 63\nunconstitutional procedures was prohibitory.  Id.  In contrast, ordering the defendant to provide\nnew bond hearings to individuals currently detained on bonds set pursuant to allegedly \nunconstitutional procedures was arguably mandatory.  Id. at 998-99.  \"The relevant status quo is\nthat between the parties pending a resolution of a case on the merits.\"  Ariz. Dream Act Coalition\nv. Brewer, 757 F.3d 1053, 1061 (9th Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nIn this case, the relevant status quo at the inception of the case is that Plaintiffs' licenses\nare suspended.  I agree with Plaintiffs that the portion of their requested relief seeking to prevent\nDefendants from suspending their licenses without giving Plaintiffs the opportunity to\ndemonstrate their inability to pay and entitling them to an exemption consistent with procedural\ndue process, is prohibitory.  But, I agree with Defendants that the requested relief requiring\nDefendants to revoke Plaintiffs' suspensions and reinstate their licenses without any additional\nfee, is mandatory because it orders Defendants to take action instead of prohibiting them from\nfuture allegedly unconstitutional conduct.  And, in this case, the requested injunctive relief that is\nprohibitory is unavailable to Plaintiffs unless the mandatory injunctive relief is granted.  Because\nthe status quo is one of current suspensions, it is only if Defendants first rescind Plaintiffs'\nsuspensions and restore their driving privileges that a future prohibition on suspending Plaintiffs'\nlicenses without an exemption upon demonstrated inability to pay would matter.  Thus, in this\ncase, I analyze the motion as one seeking a mandatory injunction.  \nII.  Younger Abstention\nDefendants argue that this Court should abstain from considering this case under the\nprinciples of Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971).  Younger abstention recognizes that\nprinciples of equity and comity preclude federal courts from enjoining state criminal proceedings\n30 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 31 of 63\nand state \"civil enforcement actions akin to criminal proceedings.\"  ReadyLink Healthcare, Inc.\nv. State Comp. Ins. Fund, 754 F.3d 754, 758 (9th Cir. 2014) (citing Younger, 401 U.S. at 43-54;\nHuffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U.S. 592, 604 (1975)) (internal quotation marks omitted).  For state\ncivil enforcement proceedings, the Younger analysis looks at whether the state proceedings \"(1)\nare ongoing, (2) are quasi-enforcement criminal actions or involve a state's interest in enforcing\nthe orders and judgments of its courts, (3) implicate an important state interest, and (4) allow\nlitigants to raise federal challenges.\"  Id. at 959.  \nBecause I resolve the preliminary injunction motion in favor of Defendants, I decline to\naddress the Younger abstention issue at this time.  \nIII.  First Claim for Relief - Griffin/Bearden Fundamental Fairness\nPlaintiffs contend that under the Griffin/Bearden line of cases, due process and equal\nprotection principles combine to prohibit penalizing people simply because they are poor.\nPlaintiffs suggest that under these cases, the appropriate inquiry is not based solely on either\nsubstantive due process or equal protection.  Instead substantive due process and equal protection\nconsiderations converge into considerations of \"fundamental fairness.\"  Thus, in cases involving\nthe treatment of indigent criminal defendants, the court must engage in a \"more searching\ninquiry,\" Pls.' Mot. 23, which requires analyzing factors such as \"the nature of the individual\ninterest affected, the extent to which it is affected, the rationality of the connection between\nlegislative means and purpose, and the existence of alternative means for effectuating the\npurpose.\"  Bearden, 461 U.S. at 666-67 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  \nUnder this analysis, Plaintiffs argue that the nature of the individual interest involved is\nthe \"right to basic self-sufficiency\" and the constitutional right to travel.  Pls.' Mot. 25-28.  Next,\n31 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 32 of 63\nthey argue that the interests involved are greatly affected as demonstrated by Plaintiffs'\nunchallenged Declarations detailing the burdens they experience when deprived of their driver's\nlicenses.  Third, Plaintiffs contend that there is no rational connection between suspending a\nlicense for failure to pay traffic debt and the challenged means of doing so without an inquiry\ninto the debtor's ability to pay before or during suspension.  Plaintiffs concede that O.R.S.\n809.416 may be a rational means for coercing payment of traffic debt for those who can afford to\npay it.  But, that is not the case for those low-income individuals who cannot afford to make\npayments on the debt.  \"Visiting a harsh consequence on 'someone who through no fault of his\nown is unable to make' the payment sought 'will not make [payment] suddenly forthcoming.'\"\nThomas I, 303 F. Supp. 3d at 614 (quoting Bearden, 461 U.S. at 670) (brackets in Thomas).  In\nfact, Plaintiffs argue, depriving traffic debtors of their driver's licenses based on a failure to pay is\ncounterproductive because it undermines the objective of obtaining payments on traffic debt by\nadversely affecting the debtors' ability to find and maintain a job.  Finally, Plaintiffs argue that\nthere are \"robust, alternative means for collecting traffic debt.\"  Pls.' Mot. 30.  They note that the\nstate can send collection letters, assign a delinquent account to a private collection agency or to\nthe ODOR for set offs, and garnish a traffic debtor's wages.  Id. at 30-31.  \nDefendants argue that the Griffin/Bearden cases have a more limited application than\nPlaintiffs suggest, that driving is not a fundamental right, that poverty is not a protected class,\nand that the statutory scheme has a rational basis.  Based on these arguments, Defendants\ncontend that Plaintiffs fail to establish substantive due process or equal protection claims.  \nGriffin addressed the constitutionality of requiring criminal defendants to pay for\ntranscripts in order to appeal.  351 U.S. at 13.  Undisputably, the issue arose in the criminal\n32 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 33 of 63\ncontext.  Several times in the plurality decision the Court referred to criminal trials.  E.g., id. at\n17 (\"our own constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection both call for\nprocedures in criminal trials which allow no invidious discriminations between persons and\ndifferent groups of persons\"; \"all people charged with a crime must, so far as the law is\nconcerned, stand on an equality before the bar of justice.\") (internal quotation marks omitted). \nWhile the plurality decision did not make clear if it was addressing the issue as one of due\nprocess or equal protection, Justice Frankfurter, concurring in the judgment, relied on equal\nprotection principles.  E.g., id. at 21 (equal protection does not deny a state \"the right to make\nclassifications in law when the classifications are rooted in reason\").\nCases following Griffin also addressed rights implicated when one is a criminal\ndefendant.  Like Griffin, which ultimately concerned the right to be free of wrongful\nimprisonment/right to liberty, the right at issue in Williams v. Illinois concerned the\nimprisonment of an indigent criminal defendant when a non-indigent criminal defendant in the\nsame circumstances would not have faced that punishment.  399 U.S. 235 (1970).  In Williams,\nthe criminal defendant received the maximum punishment for theft of one year in jail and a $500\nfine, plus $5 in court costs.  Id. at 236.  The judgment provided that if the defendant did not pay\nthe fine and court costs by the end of his one-year jail term, he would remain in jail until that\ndebt was paid, to be calculated at the rate of $5 per day.  Id. at 236-37.  This equaled 101 days in\naddition to the maximum term of imprisonment he had already received.  Id.  The Court held that\nit was unconstitutional to subject an indigent individual to imprisonment beyond the maximum\nsentence when he was not willfully refusing to pay.  Id. at 244.  The defendant presented this as\nan equal protection argument which the Court relied on to hold that the \"Equal Protection Clause\n33 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 34 of 63\nof the Fourteenth Amendment requires that the statutory ceiling placed on imprisonment for any\nsubstantive offense be the same for all defendants irrespective of their economic status.\"  Id.; see\nalso id. at 242 (\"By making the maximum confinement contingent upon one's ability to pay, the\nState has visited different consequences on two categories of persons since the result is to make\nincarceration in excess of the statutory maximum applicable only to those without the requisite\nresources to satisfy the money portion of the judgment.\").  The Court made clear that it did not\npreclude imprisonment for one who willfully refused to pay the fine.  Id. at 242 n.19.\nThe next year, the Court struck down a Texas law which allowed conversion of the\ndefendant's fine into a jail term even though the traffic offense violation limited punishment to a\nfine and even though the fine was unpaid due to the defendant's indigency.  Tate v. Short, 401\nU.S. 395 (1971).  The Court observed that Tate involved offenses punishable by fines only, but it\nanalogized to Williams nonetheless because, the Court explained, an individual's imprisonment\nfor nonpayment is the same unconstitutional discrimination as in Williams given that the\nindividual is subjected to imprisonment solely because of his indigency.  Id. at 397-98.  The\nCourt explained that because Texas had legislated a \"fines only\" policy for traffic offenses, that\nstatutory ceiling could not, consistent with the Equal Protection Clause, limit punishment to\npayment of a fine for a defendant able to pay but convert it to a prison term for a defendant\nunable to pay.  Id. at 399.  Although Tate involved a traffic violation and not a more serious\ncharge, the statute at issue, like the statutes in Griffin and Bearden, implicated the defendant's\nright to be free from wrongful incarceration.  \nFinally, in Bearden, the Court once again was concerned with the imprisonment of a\ncriminal defendant solely because the defendant could not pay a fine.  461 U.S. at 661.  In that\n34 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 35 of 63\ncase, the Georgia sentencing court revoked the defendant's probation for failure to pay a fine and\nmake restitution.  Id. at 662-63.  Justice O'Connor summarized the prior holdings of Griffin and\nsubsequent cases after noting that the Court had \"long been sensitive to the treatment of indigents\nin our criminal justice system.\"  Id. at 664.  She also noted, however, that the Court had\n\"recognized limits on the principle of protecting indigents in the criminal justice system.\"  Id. \nFor example, the Court held that indigents had no constitutional right to appointed counsel for a\ndiscretionary appeal.  Id. at 664-65 (citing Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U.S. 600 (1974)).  It also rejected\nan equal protection challenge to a federal statute permitting a district court to provide an indigent\nwith a free trial transcript only if the court certified that the challenge to the conviction was not\nfrivolous and the transcript was needed to prepare the petition.  Id. at 665 (citing United States v.\nMacCollum, 426 U.S. 317 (1976) (plurality opinion)).  \nThe Bearden Court explained that \"[d]ue process and equal protection principles\nconverge in the Court's analysis in these cases.\"  Id. at 665.  Acknowledging that most decisions\nrelied on an equal protection analysis, Justice O'Connor explained that the Court \"generally\nanalyze[s] the fairness of relations between the criminal defendant and the State under the Due\nProcess Clause, while we approach the question whether the State has invidiously denied one\nclass of defendants a substantial benefit available to another class of defendants under the Equal\nProtection Clause.\"  Id.  The parties presented arguments based on equal protection and\nstrenuously argued whether strict scrutiny or rational basis was the correct standard of review. \nId.  There was no doubt that the state had treated the defendant differently from a person who did\nnot violate probation by failing to pay the fine.  Id.  But, the Court believed that the question of\nwhether the differential treatment violated the Equal Protection Clause required the\n35 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 36 of 63\ndetermination of whether, and under what circumstances, a defendant's indigent status may be\nconsidered in the decision whether to revoke probation.  Id. at 665-66.  This, the Court explained,\nwas \"substantially similar to asking directly the due process question of whether and when it is\nfundamentally unfair or arbitrary for the State to revoke probation when an indigent is unable to\npay the fine.\"  Id. at 666.  \nContinuing, the Court enunciated the four-part test Plaintiffs rely on here:\nWhether analyzed in terms of equal protection or due process, the issue cannot be\nresolved by resort to easy slogans or pigeonhole analysis, but rather requires a\ncareful inquiry into such factors as \"the nature of the individual interest affected,\nthe extent to which it is affected, the rationality of the connection between\nlegislative means and purpose, and the existence of alternative means for\neffectuating the purpose.\"\nId. at 666-67 (quoting Williams, 399 U.S. at 260 (Harlan, J., concurring)) (footnote and brackets\nomitted).  \nFollowing Williams and Tate, the Court concluded in Bearden that if a state determines\nthat a fine or restitution is the appropriate sentence for the crime, it is unconstitutional for the\nstate to thereafter imprison the defendant solely because she or he lacks the resources to pay.  Id.\nat 667-68.  The Court was careful to distinguish situations where a defendant is at fault for failing\nto pay the fine.  Id. at 668 (noting that \"[i]f the probationer has willfully refused to pay the fine or\nrestitution when he has the means to pay, the State is perfectly justified in using imprisonment as\na sanction to enforce collection.\").  In reaching its conclusion, the Court rejected the state's\nrationales for why it had to revoke probation in such circumstances.  Id. at 671-72.  The Court\nalso noted alternatives such as extending time for payments, reducing the fine, or performing\npublic service.  Id. at 671-72.  In the end, the Court held that \"in revocation proceedings for\n36 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 37 of 63\nfailure to pay a fine or restitution, a sentencing court must inquire into the reasons for the failure\nto pay.\"  Id. at 672.  If the probationer willfully refused to pay or failed to make sufficient bona\nfide legal efforts to acquire the funds to pay, the court could, consistent with the Constitution,\nrevoke probation and sentence the defendant to imprisonment.  Id.  If the probationer satisfied the\ncourt that he could not pay despite such bona fide efforts, the court had to consider alternatives. \nId.  The court could revoke probation and order imprisonment only if alternative measures were\ninadequate to meet the state's interests in punishment and deterrence.  Id.  \"To do otherwise\nwould deprive the probationer of his conditional freedom simply because, through no fault of his\nown, he cannot pay the fine.  Such a deprivation would be contrary to the fundamental fairness\nrequired by the Fourteenth Amendment.\"  Id. at 672-73.\nThe Griffin/Bearden line of cases firmly establishes that the government may not\nimprison a criminal defendant solely due to the person's non-willful inability to pay a fee or a\nfine.  Grounded in concepts of due process and equal protection, the Court has found such\nstatutes to be \"fundamentally unfair.\"  The Ninth Circuit has applied this line of reasoning,\nincluding in a case challenging a federal sentencing guideline provision which imposed\nadditional criminal history points at sentencing, and thus increased the defendant's period of\nincarceration, because of the defendant's failure to pay a fine imposed in a prior state-court\nconviction.  United States v. Parks, 89 F.3d 570 (9th Cir. 1996).  The court, relying on Bearden,\nconcluded that the imposition of criminal history points for failure to pay a fine without a finding\nthat the failure to pay was willful, violated the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause.  Id. at 572-\n73.  Imposition absent such inquiry solely based on nonpayment would be \"'fundamentally\nunfair.'\"  Id. at 573 (quoting Bearden, 461 U.S. at 668).  \n37 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 38 of 63\nThese cases have all arisen in the context of the criminal justice system where\nfundamental rights of liberty are implicated.  Few cases have extended these principles beyond\nthat context.  The Supreme Court addressed this issue in M.L.B. v. S.L.J, a case in which the state\ncourt had terminated a mother's parental rights and then dismissed her appeal because of her\nfinancial inability to comply with statutes requiring her to pay more than $2,000 in record and\ntranscript preparation fees.  519 U.S. 102 (1996).  Justice Ginsburg explained that Griffin was the\n\"foundation case\" for issues concerning access to appeal in general and transcripts required for\nappeal in particular.  Id. at 110.  Before analyzing the particulars of the statute at issue in M.L.B.,\nshe discussed the application of Griffin beyond \"cases in which imprisonment is at stake.\"  Id. at\n111.  \nOne of those cases was Mayer v. Chicago, 404 U.S. 189 (1971), which involved an\nindigent defendant convicted on non-felony charges who received a fine for each offense.  He\nintended to appeal based on prosecutorial misconduct and insufficient evidence, but the state\nprovided free transcripts only for felony cases.  The Mayer Court rejected the argument that\nGriffin was distinguishable because the defendant in that case, and defendants in other\n\"transcript\" cases, were sentenced to confinement.  404 U.S. at 196.  The city argued that a\ndefendant's interest in a transcript for a fine-only non-felony case was outweighed by the state's\nfiscal and other interests in not burdening the appellate process.  According to Mayer, such an\nargument \"misconceives\" Griffin's principle.  Id.  Griffin, the Mayer Court stated, did not\n\"represent a balance between the needs of the accused and the interests of society[.]\" Id.  Instead,\n\"its principle is a flat prohibition against pricing indigent defendants out of as effective an appeal\nas would be available to others able to pay their own way.\"  Id. at 196-97.  \"The invidiousness of\n38 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 39 of 63\nthe discrimination that exists when criminal procedures are made available only to those who can\npay is not erased by any differences in sentences that may be imposed.\"  Id. at 197.\nAs discussed by Justice Ginsburg in M.L.B., the Mayer Court was concerned with access\nto the courts.  M.L.B., 519 U.S. at 112 (noting statements in Mayer that Griffin prohibited\n\"'making access to appellate processes from even the State's most inferior courts depend upon the\nconvicted defendant's ability to pay,'\" and that an \"impecunious party, . . . whether found guilty of\na felony or conduct only 'quasi criminal in nature,' 'cannot be denied a record of sufficient\ncompleteness to permit proper appellate consideration of his claims[.]'\") (quoting Mayer, 404\nU.S. at 196-98) (citation and brackets omitted).  Justice Ginsburg also noted, however, that the\nCourt had limited the application of the \"flat prohibition of bolted doors that the Griffin line of\ncases securely established[.]\"  Id. at 112 (internal quotation marks omitted) (noting that under its\ncases, the right to counsel was \"less encompassing\" given that a state must provide trial counsel\nfor an indigent felon charged with a felony but not when charged with a non-felony with no term\nof imprisonment actually imposed, and that a state must provide appellate counsel to poor\ndefendants facing incarceration who file appeals as of right but not those pursuing a discretionary\nappeal or petitioning for review with the Supreme Court).  \nNext, Justice Ginsburg discussed the \"narrow category of civil cases in which the State\nmust provide access to its judicial processes without regard to a party's ability to pay court fees.\" \nId. at 113.  Summarizing her discussion of those cases which involved access to the courts for\nthose seeking to dissolve their marriages and tenants seeking to appeal adverse decisions in\neviction cases, she concluded that \"this Court has not extended Griffin to the broad array of civil\ncases.\" Id. at 116.  The narrow set of cases which the Court \"set apart from the mine run of [civil]\n39 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 40 of 63\ncases\" was limited to those \"involving state controls or intrusions on family relationships.\"  Id. \n\"In that domain,\" the M.L.B. Court wrote, \"to guard against undue official intrusion, the Court\nhas examined closely and contextually the importance of the governmental interest advanced in\ndefense of intrusion.\"  Id.  \nThe Court turned to the specific issue presented in the case and noted the state's argument\nthat the case belonged with \"the generality of civil cases, in which indigent persons have no\nconstitutional right to proceed\" in forma pauperis and the mother's contrary argument that the\n\"accusatory\" state action she was trying to \"fend off\" was \"barely distinguishable from criminal\ncondemnation in view of the magnitude and permanence\" of the loss she faced.  Id. at 119. \nDiscussing the \"character and intensity of the individual interest at stake\" and the \"state's\njustification for its exaction,\" the Court found the mother's \"stakes,\" which it described as the\nforced dissolution of her parental rights, to be large and substantial.  Id. at 120-21 (noting that\n\"[p]arental status termination is irretrievably destructive of the most fundamental family\nrelationship\") (brackets omitted).  While the state had a legitimate interest in offsetting the costs\nof the court system, the Court concluded that the \"tightly circumscribed category of parental\nstatus termination cases,\" where appeals are few, would not impose an undue burden on the state. \nId. at 122. \nSeeking to allay concerns that its holding would open \"floodgates\" if Griffin was not\nrestricted to criminal cases, id. at 127, the Court affirmed the general rule that fee requirements\nare ordinarily examined only for rationality and that the state's need for revenue to offset costs\ngenerally \"satisfies the rationality requirement[.]\"  Id. at 123.  But, the Court allowed that there\nwere two exceptions to the general rule: (1) the \"basic right to participate in the political process\n40 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 41 of 63\nas voters and candidates cannot be limited to those who can pay for a license\"; and (2) \"access to\njudicial processes in cases criminal and quasi-criminal in nature\" cannot \"turn on ability to pay.\" \nId. (internal quotation marks omitted).  Although a parental termination order did not fit neatly\ninto either of those exceptions, the Court found that under its prior decisions, \"parental\ntermination decrees are among the most severe forms of state action.\"  Id. at 128.  Thus, the\nCourt concluded, it was satisfied that the parental status termination cases \"work a unique kind of\ndeprivation\" and are therefore set apart from \"mine run civil actions\" and even other domestic\nrelations matters such as divorce, paternity, and child custody.  Id. at 127 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).  Such cases involve the \"awesome authority of the state to destroy permanently\nall legal recognition of the parental relationship,\" and the \"label 'civil' should not entice [the\nCourt] to leave undisturbed the state courts' disposition of this case.\"  Id. at 128 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\nThe Ninth Circuit discussed M.L.B. in Hernandez which involved the detention of non-\ncitizens in removal proceedings who were eligible for release on bond but who could not afford\nto pay the bond.  Hernandez, 872 F.3d 976.  The bond determinations were made without\nconsidering the detainee's ability to pay or alternatives which would ensure the detainee's future\nappearance.  Id. at 983.  The plaintiffs raised due process, equal protection, and excessive bail\nclaims, but the court addressed only the Fifth Amendment due process claim.  Id. at 990 n.16. \nThe court noted that the right to be free from imprisonment, meaning government custody,\ndetention, or other forms of physical restraint, was at the heart of the Due Process Clause, and\nasked whether consideration of the detainees' financial circumstances, as well as of possible\nalternative release conditions, was necessary to ensure that the conditions of release would be\n41 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 42 of 63\nreasonably related to the government's interest in securing their appearance at a future hearing. \nId. at 990-91.  The court affirmed the district court's grant of a preliminary injunction because it\nwas likely the plaintiffs would succeed on the merits.  In reaching its conclusion, the court\ncompared immigration cases to the parental termination decree in M.L.B.  Id. at 993.  Both were\n\"set 'apart from mine run civil actions'\" because they \"'involve the awesome authority of the\nState' to take a 'devastatingly adverse action,'\" which in immigration cases, is the state's power to\nremove individuals from their homes and separate them from their families.  Id. (quoting M.L.B.,\n515 U.S. at 127-28).  \nWhat all of these cases teach is that the \"fundamental fairness\" principles of due process\nand equal protection originating in Griffin have been applied when either incarceration or access\nto the courts, or both, is at stake.  The incarceration cases clearly implicate the fundamental right\nto be free from wrongful detention, meaning the fundamental right to liberty.  The access to\ncourts cases have arisen in either (1) the criminal context where the rights to both a fair trial and\na conviction only upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt are implicated by effectively denying an\nappeal to an indigent defendant, or (2) the narrow circumstance of a parental termination where\nthe state's \"awesome\" authority to permanently destroy what the Supreme Court had already\nrecognized as \"the most fundamental family relationship\" was at stake.  M.L.B., 519 U.S. at 121\n(citing Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 753 (1982)).  \nNone of those rights or interests are present here.  As the Fowler I court recognized, the\nGriffin/Bearden line of cases does not establish \"that it is fundamentally unfair in a constitutional\nsense (i.e. in violation of the Due Process Clause) for a state to deprive a person of a property\ninterestS such as a driver's licenseS because of the person's inability to pay a fine associated with\n42 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 43 of 63\nthat interest.\"  2017 WL 6379676, at *7.  The case law, the court concluded, does not support\nextending the Due Process Clause that far.  Id.  The court analogized to a state legally foreclosing\non a residence for failure to pay property taxes.  Id.  Such action may lead to the homeowner\nbecoming homeless but, the state's \"action is not barred by the Due Process Clause.\"  Id.  To be\nsure, the Fowler I court explained, it is unfair and unwise to deprive individuals of their driver's\nlicenses because of an inability to pay.  Id.  But, it is not \"unfair\" in a constitutional sense.  Id. \nAbsent a fundamental right or suspect class, the government must act only rationally and afford\ncertain procedural protections before the deprivation of a protected interest.  Id.  Putting aside the\nprocedural issue, which the court addressed later, the court concluded that the plaintiffs'\n\"fundamentally unfair\" argument based on Griffin/Bearden was not likely to succeed.  Id.\nThe judge in the Robinson and Thomas cases reached the opposite conclusion.  The\ndiscussion in those cases is extensive, but even under a rational basis review which the court felt\nbound to apply by Johnson v. Bredesen, 624 F.3d 742 (6h Cir. 2010), a controlling Sixth Circuit\ncase, the court determined that the plaintiffs' Griffin/Bearden claims had merit.  Robinson I, 2017\nWL 4418134, at *7-9 (concluding likelihood of success on the merits of the Griffin/Bearden\nclaim); Robinson II, 326 F.R.D. at 149-59 (denying defendants' motion to dismiss\nGriffin/Bearden claim); Thomas I, 303 F. Supp. 3d at 607-19 (denying motion to dismiss\nGriffin/Bearden claim).  Under that analysis, the judge concluded that the license suspensions for\nindigent traffic or court debtors were not rationally related to a state interest.  \nThe Robinson/Thomas court believed that the Griffin line of cases required it to consider\nthe suspension of driver's licenses for nonpayment of traffic debt absent an exception for those\nwilling but unable to pay, as \"the equivalent of a statute that imposes a harsher sanction on\n43 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 44 of 63\nindigent debtors than their non-indigent peers.\"  Thomas I, 303 F. Supp. 3d at 614.  Then, the\ncourt explained, if the statutory scheme affords no adequate exception for indigence, Griffin and\nthe cases following it \"instruct this court to consider that scheme as the constitutional equivalent\nof the state's using, as the sole justification for its action, the poverty of the defendant.\"  Id.\n(internal quotation marks omitted).  The court's discussion of the issue in these cases emphasized\nthe impact of the law on the indigent debtor's right to self-sufficiency.  Thomas I, 303 F. Supp. 3d\nat 613, 615; Robinson II, 326 F.R.D. at 154 (noting that the Sixth Circuit recognized that the\nright to self sufficiency justified \"an at least somewhat more searching standard of review\") \n(citing Johnson); but see id. at 153 (noting that self-sufficiency and self-respect had not been\nrecognized by the Sixth Circuit or Supreme Court as fundamental rights in a constitutional\nsense).  It also discussed the impact on the right to travel, and while acknowledging that the right\ndoes not generally prohibit the state from denying a single mode of transportation, the court\nnoted that the law may still impact driving in a way that potentially triggers a heightened level of\nscrutiny.  Thomas I, 303 F. Supp. 3d at 613; Robinson II, 326 F.R.D. at 153-54.  \nI respectfully disagree with Robinson and Thomas and believe that the Fowler court made\nthe correct ruling.  Although Robinson and Thomas purported to apply a rational basis review,\nthe conclusions reached suggest that the court in those cases applied a more stringent level of\nscrutiny.  As a result, I find these decisions somewhat internally inconsistent.  \nI find no support in the caselaw for Plaintiffs' assertions of a constitutional right to self-\nsufficiency.  Additionally, wealth/poverty is not a suspect class.  E.g., Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S.\n297, 323 (1980) (\"this Court has held repeatedly that poverty, standing alone is not a suspect\nclassification\"); see also Kadrmas v. Dickinson Pub. Sch., 487 U.S. 450, 458 (1988) (\"We have\n44 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 45 of 63\npreviously rejected the suggestion that statutes having different effects on the wealthy and the\npoor should on that account alone be subjected to strict equal protection scrutiny.\").  \nAs for the right to travel, neither the Supreme Court nor the Ninth Circuit has recognized\na constitutional right to intrastate travel.  Nunez ex rel. Nunez v. City of San Diego, 114 F.3d 935,\n944 n.7 (9th Cir. 1997); see also Mem'l Hosp. v. Maricopa Cty., 415 U.S. 250, 255-56 (1974)\n(declining to decide whether the Constitution guarantees the fundamental right of intrastate\ntravel); Fruitts v. Union Cty., No. 2:14-cv-00309-SU, 2015 WL 5232722, at *6 (D. Or. Aug. 17,\n2015) (finding no constitutional right to intrastate travel; explaining that the right had not been\nrecognized by the Ninth Circuit or Supreme Court and that district courts in the Ninth Circuit\nhave \"refused to expand\" the constitutional interest in interstate travel to include such a right);\nadopted by J. Simon, 2015 WL 5232696 (D. Or. Sept. 8, 2015).  \nA burden on a single mode of transportation does not implicate the constitutional right to\ninterstate travel.  Miller v. Reed, 176 F.3d 1202, 1205 (9th Cir. 1999).  There is no fundamental\nright to drive.  Id. at 1206 (citing Dixon v. Love, 431 U.S. 105, 112-16 (1977)).  Nor is there a\nfundamental right to a driver's license.  Franceschi v. Yee, 887 F.3d 927 (9th Cir. 2018), cert.\ndenied, No. 18-585, 2018 WL 5792470 (U.S. Dec. 10, 2018).  And in Miller, the court rejected\nthe plaintiff's argument that driving was an essential mode of transportation given the importance\nof cars in modern society.  Miller, 176 F.3d at 1205.  Although, as Plaintiffs note, the Supreme\nCourt has acknowledged, in a case invalidating a New York law awarding civil service\npreference points to veterans who lived in New York at the time they entered military service,\nthat the right to interstate travel may be implicated when \"it actually deters such travel, when\nimpeding travel is its primary objective, or when it uses any classification which serves to\n45 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 46 of 63\npenalize the exercise of that right,\" the Court noted that \"heightened scrutiny [is] triggered\" \"only\nwhere a State's law operates to penalize those persons who have exercised their constitutional\nright to interstate migration[.]\"  Attorney Gen. of N.Y. v. Soto-Lopez, 476 U.S. 898, 903, 905\n(1986) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  That is not the situation here.  \nI agree with Plaintiffs that the loss of their driver's licenses causes serious problems in\nmany areas of their lives from employment to health care to recreation.  There is no doubt that for\nmost Americans, driving makes life easier, whether one lives in a large city, a small city, or in the\ncountry.  It is also true that some parts of Oregon are better served by alternative public\ntransportation systems than others.  But, as the Fowler I court explained, appropriately in my\nopinion, \"[f]undamental rights are not identified by looking so narrowly or locally[.]\"  2017 WL\n6379676, at *8 (rejecting the plaintiffs' argument that the court should recognize a fundamental\nright where public transportation is \"woefully inadequate\" and plaintiffs lacked access to other\nmodes of travel).  Fundamental rights, the Fowler I court noted, are those rooted in the nation's\nhistory and tradition.  Id.  Geography and transportation systems cannot control constitutional\nrights.  A resident of Mission, Oregon cannot have a constitutional right to travel while a resident\nof Portland, Oregon does not.  Thus, despite difficulties presented by alternative transportation\nsystems, or the lack thereof, a challenge to the suspension of a driver's license is not\n\"fundamental in a national or constitutional sense.\"  Id.  \nMy reading of the Robinson and Thomas cases indicates that the court there\ninappropriately found or implied fundamental rights which have not been recognized as having\nconstitutional protection.  The court inappropriately applied a heightened level of scrutiny to the\nstatutory scheme.  This in turn, prompted the court to extend the Griffin/Bearden cases beyond\n46 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 47 of 63\nthe parameters of criminal justice or quasi-criminal justice cases where incarceration or equal\naccess to the courts was at stake, and beyond that rare civil case such as M.L.B. where the state\nwields its \"awesome\" power to potentially deprive a parent of her or his most fundamental of\nfamily relationships.  I do not believe the Griffin/Bearden \"more searching\" or \"more careful\"\ninquiry or  \"close examination\" of the government's interest is required in this case.  \nIn Franceschi, a recent Ninth Circuit case, the court considered a statutory scheme which\nsuspended the driver's licenses of individuals who appeared on the state's \"top 500\" list of\ndelinquent taxpayers who owed at least $100,000.  887 F.3d at 933-34.  The court explained that\n\"[g]overnmental conduct, such as revocation of a driver's license, that neither proceeds along\nsuspect lines nor infringes fundamental constitutional rights, is subject to rational basis\nreview[.]\" Id. at 940.  There, the plaintiff argued that the \"top 500\" list and suspension \nstatutes created selection criteria that had \"the effect of meting out unequal treatment to similarly\nsituated individuals\" and was arbitrary and unreasonable.  Id.  The court reviewed the argument\nunder a rational basis analysis and concluded that the state had legitimate and significant interests\nsupporting a rational basis.  Id. at 940-41.  \nOregon's challenged statutes are rationally related to a legitimate state interest.7 \n7  Here, even though the statute is facially neutral, it has a disparate impact on indigent\ndrivers.  Fowler I concluded that with a facially neutral suspension statute and no evidence of\ndiscriminatory intent, even rational basis review was unnecessary.  2017 WL 6379676, at *8. \nThe court there explained that when a \"challenged law neither creates classifications nor burdens\na fundamental right,\" \"'even the deferential rational basis scrutiny that is applied to ordinary\ngovernmental classifications is not appropriate.'\" Id. (quoting Johnson v. Rodriguez, 110 F.3d\n299, 306 (5th Cir. 1997)). Absent discriminatory intent, a facially-neutral law remained so even if\nit had a disparate impact, such as the Michigan driver's license suspension statute which\nadversely affected indigent drivers.  Id. (citing Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 248 (1976)). \nDefendants here do not make that argument and argue instead that the state's laws have a rational\n47 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 48 of 63\nDefendants argue that the state has a strong interest in enforcing traffic laws to deter future\nmisdeeds.  Defs.' Mem. 12, ECF 24; see also id. at 9 (\"the suspension of driving privileges is\neffective in obtaining compliance through payment of traffic fines\").  Certainly, traffic laws exist\nas a basic manifestation of the state's undisputed interest in protecting the health and safety of its\ncitizens.  Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U.S. 476, 485 (1995) (\"the Government . . . has a\nsignificant interest in protecting the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens\").  Thus, the state\nhas a legitimate interest in punishing, in some form, violations such as speeding, driving while\ntalking on a cell phone, failure to obey a traffic control device, failure to use proper car seats, etc. \nEven a broken tail light implicates visibility and thus, safety.  Fines, therefore, are rationally\nrelated to enforcement of traffic laws and to the deterrence of continued violations.  The sting of\npaying a fine will hopefully prevent future unsafe driving practices.  Even those who can pay the\nfine likely do not desire to part with their money for this reason.\nMethods by which the state can enforce compliance with the fine requirement, therefore,\nare rationally related to the safety goal.  Without a compliance mechanism, the fine is toothless\nand without deterrent effect.  Accordingly, fines are reduced to a judgment, subject to payment or\ncollection by a number of methods, and eventually or additionally, can result in the violator's\nlicense suspension if the fine is unpaid.  Nonetheless, as the judicial officers explain, the threat of\nbasis.  Franceschi suggests that rational review should be used.  Cases addressing an adverse\nimpact on indigent individuals indicate that as well.  See, e.g., M.L.B., 519 U.S. at 126-27\n(rejecting the defendants' argument that under Washington v. Davis, the transcript law was\nfacially neutral and no equal protection violation was shown just because of an allegedly\ndisparate impact on the indigent; noting that a facially discriminatory law may be discriminatory\nin operation and that the statute was not merely \"disproportionate in impact\" but \"wholly\ncontingent on one's ability to pay\" and thus \"visit[ed] consequences on two categories of\npersons.\") (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  \n48 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 49 of 63\nsuspension is an effective tool to coerce payment.  Of course, compliance efforts may be\nineffective as to those whose life circumstances leave them on the edge of economic survival\nevery day.  But, the evidence in the record shows that even as to those individuals, the threat of\nsuspension, or an actual suspension, has motivated the individual to return to the court to attempt\nto establish a payment plan or to obtain a reduction in the traffic debt.  While not always\nsuccessful, the threat of suspension has resulted in compliance in some occasions.  \nUnder rational basis review, the law will be upheld \"if there is any reasonably\nconceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.\"  Franceschi,\n887 F.3d at 940 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Moreover, that the statute may be\noverinclusive by its enforcement as to indigent traffic debtors with no means of paying the fine,\ndoes not, under rational basis review, render it unconstitutional.  E.g., Vance v. Bradley, 440 U.S.\n93, 108 (1979) (perfection is not required); Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 485 (1970)\n(classification need not be made with \"mathematical nicety\") (internal quotation marks omitted);\nGallinger v. Becerra, 898 F.3d 1012, 1018 (9th Cir. 2018) (rejecting the plaintiffs' argument that\na classification was too broad to be rationally related to a legitimate government interest as\ncontrary to Supreme Court precedent upholding classifications that are underinclusive and\noverinclusive under rational basis review).  Finally, even if the challenged statute sometimes\nproduces unequal and unfair results, it does not necessarily fail rational basis review.  United\nStates v. Padilla-Diaz, 862 F.3d 856, 862 (9th Cir. 2017); see also Nat'l Ass'n for Advancement\nof Psychoanalysis v. Cal. Bd. of Psychology, 228 F.3d 1043, 1051 (9th Cir. 2000) (indicating that\nunder rational basis review, a state law is constitutional even if it is \"'unwise, improvident, or out\nof harmony with a particular school of thought,'\" as long as it bears a rational relationship to\n49 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 50 of 63\nsome legitimate end) (quoting Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., 348 U.S. 483, 488\n(1955)).  Oregon's driver's license suspension statutes for the nonpayment of traffic debt are\nreasonably related to the state's legitimate interest in enforcing fines for violation of traffic laws.  \nBased on my determinations that the challenged statute, either facially or in its\napplication, does not implicate a fundamental constitutional right, does not implicate a suspect\nclassification, and is rationally related to a legitimate state interest, Plaintiffs are not likely to\nsucceed on a \"fundamental fairness\" claim under Griffin/Bearden.  \nIV.  Second Claim for Relief - Strange Equal Protection\nPlaintiffs' second claim addresses the distinction between indigent traffic debtors subject\nto driver's license suspensions and indigent debtors who are exempted from such suspensions. \nPlaintiffs argue that there are three kinds of similarly-situated indigent debtors who, unlike\nPlaintiffs, are not subject to license suspension for unpaid debt, or are given the ability to\ndemonstrate inability to pay:  (1) traffic debtors who committed bicycle, pedestrian, or parking\noffenses; (2) private debtors generally; and (c) child support debtors.  \nPlaintiffs base this claim on Strange, which held that a Kansas recoupment statute\nviolated the Equal Protection Clause by permitting the state to recoup court-appointed attorney's\nfees from indigent criminal defendants without permitting them to raise any of the defenses\navailable to other civil judgment debtors.  407 U.S. at 141-42.  Exemptions available generally to\nother civil judgment debtors included restrictions on the amount of disposable income subject to\ngarnishment and protection from wage garnishment.  Id. at 135.  The Court indicated that under\nappropriate circumstances, a state's claim to reimbursement may take precedence over the claims\nof private creditors, and that enforcement procedures with respect to judgments did not need to\n50 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 51 of 63\nbe identical.  Id. at 138.  But, while the Kansas statute stated that a judgment lien as to a criminal\ndefendant was comparable to other judgments under the state's civil procedure code, the statute\nthen omitted the exemptions in the civil procedure code which were designed \"primarily to\nbenefit debtors of low and marginal incomes,\" from the enforcement of reimbursement\njudgments.  Id. at 139.  The Court explained that the Equal Protection Clause \"imposes a\nrequirement of some rationality in the nature of the class singled out\" and that such rationality is\n\"lacking where . . . the State has subjected indigent defendants to such discriminatory conditions\nof repayment\" that are not imposed on other judgment debtors.  Id. at 140 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\nTwo years after Strange, the Court revisited the issue in Fuller v. Oregon, 417 U.S. 40\n(1974).  There, an Oregon recoupment statute retained all of the exemptions accorded to other\njudgment debtors.  Id. at 47-48.  The Court held that the statute did not violate equal protection. \nId.  The statute was directed only to convicted defendants who were indigent at the time of the\ncriminal proceeding and who later gained the ability to pay the expenses of legal representation. \nId. at 46.  The Fuller Court explained that in Strange, the \"offending aspect of the Kansas statute\nwas its provision that in an action to compel repayment of counsel fees, none of the exemptions\nprovided for in the code of civil procedure (for collection of other judgment debts) shall apply to\nany such judgment[.]\"  Id. at 47 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Strange, the Fuller Court\nnoted, \"found that the elimination of the exemptions normally available to judgment debtors\n'embodied elements of punitiveness and discrimination which violate the rights of citizens to\nequal treatment under the law.'\" Id. (quoting Strange, 407 U.S. at 142) (brackets omitted).  \n\"[N]o such infirmity\" was present in the Oregon statute.  Id.  No express denials of\n51 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 52 of 63\nexemptions from execution given to other judgment debtors were included in the Oregon statute. \nId.  Instead, the \"convicted person from whom recoupment is sought\" retained \"all the\nexemptions accorded other judgment debtors,\" as well as the ability to show that the recovery of\nthe costs would impose a hardship.  Id.  Thus, the Oregon statute was \"wholly free of the kind of\ndiscrimination that was held in [Strange] to violate the Equal Protection Clause.\"  Id. at 47-48.  \nPlaintiffs argue that the central holding of Strange requires \"striking down statutes that\nprovide more of a safety net to indigent private debtors than to indigent criminal debtors, and\nupholding statutes relating to debt collection that do provide for an indigency determination and\nexception.\"  Pls.' Mot. 32-33.  Because Oregon's license suspension scheme singles out indigent\ntraffic debtors for \"uniquely worse treatment relative to other kinds of indigent debtors,\"\nPlaintiffs argue that the statute violates equal protection under Strange.  Defendants argue that\nStrange does not apply \"because the challenged statutory scheme does not expressly eliminate\nany exemptions that would ordinarily be available to judgment debtors with respect to the\ncollection of government debt.\"  Defs.' Mem. 8.  \nDefendants' argument is taken directly from the Fowler I decision which concluded that\nthe plaintiffs' Strange claim was unlikely to succeed on the merits.  Fowler I, 2017 WL 6379676,\nat *9-10.  The Michigan license suspension statutes, the court explained, were like the Oregon\nstatutes at issue in Fuller and \"do not expressly eliminate any exemptions normally available to\njudgment creditors with respect to the collection of a government debt.\"  Id. at 9.  In reaching its\nconclusion, the court observed that \"[n]othing in Strange suggests that the Court's holding would\napply here[.]\" Id. (further remarking that the plaintiffs cited no case \"reading the Equal Protection\nClause's guarantees in a way that Plaintiffs assert Strange does.\").  \n52 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 53 of 63\nI agree with the Fowler I case.  The issue presented in Strange and considered again in\nFuller is not present here.  Nothing in the Oregon statutory scheme regarding the collection of a\njudgment for unpaid traffic debt provides for treatment different from any civil judgment debtor\nby creating exemptions from ordinary collection methods.  And, under my reading of Strange, it\nwas the explicit exemption from the wage garnishment protections available to other civil\njudgment debtors that the Court found unconstitutional.  Thus, I disagree with the Robinson\ncourt's determination that the Robinson plaintiffs showed a likelihood of success on the merits or\nstated a claim under Strange because Tennessee \"heaped on additional tools of coercion.\" \nRobinson II, 326 F.R.D. at 160-61 (acknowledging that the Kansas statute in Strange removed\nprotections but concluding that Tennessee's additional \"tools of coercion\" were analogous).  As a\nresult, Plaintiffs fail to establish a likelihood of success on the merits of the Strange claim. \nEven if I were to consider Plaintiffs' argument to properly arise under Strange, I would\nstill determine that Plaintiffs had not met their preliminary injunction burden on this claim.  In a\n1987 case, the Ninth Circuit observed that the Strange Court struck down the Kansas statute\nbecause it found the \"'requirement of some rationality in the nature of the class singled out' not to\nhave been met.\"  United States v. Smith, 818 F.2d 687, 692 (9th Cir 1987) (quoting Strange, 407\nU.S. at 140); see also Strange, 407 U.S. at 138, 139 (asserting that a state's judgment\nenforcement procedures need not be identical and indicating that the issue is whether there is a\nrational basis for singling out a class).  Thus, rational basis is the relevant inquiry.  \nHere, fines imposed for traffic safety violations committed by those in a car, are, as\nexplained above, rationally related to the state's interest in modifying driving conduct to comply\nwith traffic laws.  The fine is a behavior modification tool and the driver's license suspension\n53 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 54 of 63\nassists in obtaining compliance with fine payment.  Private debt does not originate in the same\nway.  Violations of pedestrian, bicycle, and parking laws do not trigger the same need to address\nviolation of traffic laws such as speeding, failure to obey a traffic control device, etc.  Moreover,\na driver's license is not even needed to cross a street or ride a bicycle.  Child support obligations\nalso do not originate in the same context.  Thus, for each of the categories of distinguishable\nindigent debtors, there is a rational basis for the classification.  No Strange equal protection\nclaim is likely to succeed here. \nV.  Third Claim for Relief - Procedural Due Process\nPlaintiffs argue that Oregon's license suspension statutes for traffic debtors violate\nprocedural due process because the statutes fail to provide an ability-to-pay hearing before\nsuspension is effective.  See Pls.' Reply 19 (\"The absence of an ability-to-pay determination is the\ndue process that plaintiffs assert is missing[.]\").  They contend that the private interests at stake\nare fundamental, the risk of an erroneous deprivation is high, and any government interest in\ncollecting traffic debt is actually harmed by the absence of an indigency determination given that\nindigent debtors cannot pay and the suspension actually interferes with the debtors' means of\nobtaining income to repay the debt.  Plaintiffs argue that an assessment of these factors\nestablishes that only a pre-deprivation notice and pre-deprivation hearing on the ability to pay\nsatisfies due process.  In response, Defendants contend that no fundamental rights are at issue,\nPlaintiffs received substantial process before suspension, and the government has a significant\ninterest in enforcing traffic laws.  \nMathews v. Eldridge is the foundational Supreme Court procedural due process case.  424\nU.S. 319 (1976).  \"Procedural due process imposes constraints on governmental decisions which\n54 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 55 of 63\ndeprive individuals of 'liberty' or 'property' interests within the meaning of the Due Process\nClause of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment.\"  Id. at 332.  The \"fundamental requirement of\ndue process is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\"  Id.\nat 333 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Due process, however, \"is flexible and calls for such\nprocedural protections as the particular situation demands.\"  Id. at 334 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).  \nUnder Mathews, the court weighs three factors to evaluate the sufficiency of procedural\nprotections: (1) \"the private interest that will be affected by the official action,\" (2) \"the risk of an\nerroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probative value, if\nany, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards,\" and (3) \"the Government's interest,\nincluding the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or\nsubstitute procedural requirement would entail.\" Id. at 335; see also Yagman v. Garcetti, 852\nF.3d 859, 864 (9th Cir. 2017) (explaining that \"there are no hard and fast rules for determining\nthe requisite timing and adequacy of pre- and post-deprivation procedures\" and that once it is\ndetermined that a protected interest is at stake, a court applies the three-part balancing test\nestablished in Mathews to determine whether a pre-deprivation hearing is required and what\nspecific procedures must be employed at that hearing given the particularities of the deprivation)\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).   \nA driver's license is a significant enough property interest to warrant procedural due\nprocess protections. Dixon v. Love, 431 U.S. 105, 112 (1977); Franceschi, 887 F.3d at 935. \nPlaintiffs argue that the private interests at stake, the right to self-sufficiency and travel, are\nfundamental rights and are of significant interest.  They rely on the Thomas court's observation\n55 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 56 of 63\nthat the \"substantive nature of the rights and facts at issue affects the application of the Eldridge\nfactors.\"  Thomas I, 303 F. Supp. 3d at 632.  However, as previously explained, I find no\nfundamental rights implicated here.  No one is losing his or her freedom or parental rights.  The\nright to drive is simply not constitutionally fundamental.  Thus, the private interests at stake are\nnot as significant as Plaintiffs assert.  \nThere is little risk of erroneous deprivation given that the suspensions are triggered by the\nobjective fact of nonpayment of the fines.  Mackey v. Montrym, 443 U.S. 1, 13 (1979) (upholding\nlicense suspension based on \"objective facts either within the personal knowledge of an impartial\ngovernment official or readily ascertainable by him\"); Crawford v. Blue, 271 F. Supp. 3d 316,\n329 (D. Mass 2017) (discussing three-part Mathews test in case challenging driver's license\nsuspension and citing Mackey).  I understand Plaintiffs' position that the risk of erroneous\ndeprivation is high under the procedures currently used because absent the opportunity to\nestablish indigency, Plaintiffs' fundamental rights will be wrongfully deprived.  But, Plaintiffs'\ncharacterization of the deprivation is founded upon an assumption that there is a constitutional\nright to an indigency determination in the first place and that the rights implicated by the\nsuspensions are fundamental in a constitutional sense.  As stated previously, I disagree with\nPlaintiffs on this point.8  I do not intend my conclusion to suggest that I am blind to the\n8  The Fowler I court, although concluding that the plaintiffs' Griffin/Bearden and Strange\nclaims were unlikely to succeed, nonetheless concluded that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed\non their procedural due process claim.  The court faulted the Michigan statutes for failing to\ninform individuals of the ability, with court approval, to pay traffic debt under a payment plan. \n2017 WL 6379676, at *11.  But, because the court had rejected the constitutional claims, it was\nerror to consider the lack of such payment plan notice as procedurally deficient.  Thus, I do not\nfind the Fowler I opinion persuasive in regard to the procedural due process claim.  In any event,\nthe Michigan statutes which suspend the license upon extremely short notice are distinguishable\n56 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 57 of 63\nfundamental effect that driver's license suspensions for nonpayment of traffic debt have on\nPlaintiffs' lives.  I do not underestimate the adverse effects on their employment opportunities,\nrecreational opportunities, access to medical care, and more.  But, for the reasons previously\nexplained, I do not find support in the caselaw for concluding that the rights they assert have\nbeen recognized as \"constitutionally fundamental.\"  Thus, Plaintiffs' articulation of the risk of\nerroneous deprivation is misplaced. \nThe second Mathews factor also looks at the probative value, if any, of additional or\nsubstitute procedural safeguards.  Here, the fine is imposed only after a violation has been\nadjudicated by a court. See Franceschi, 887 F.3d at 937 (noting that the facts supporting\nsuspension related to the plaintiff's tax deficiency had already been established through prior\nproceedings).   If the court exercises discretion to initiate suspension of the license for\nnonpayment of the fine, the DMV issues a pre-deprivation sixty-day notice informing the violator\nthat she or he may resolve the issue by returning to the court.  Again, because I conclude that the\nConstitution does not require Plaintiffs' indigence to be assessed, the fact that the DMV sixty-day\nnotice does not expressly inform the violator that the court may be willing to entertain a payment\nplan does not render the notice ineffective.  Thus, the procedures currently used allow the\nviolator to appear in court to contest the violation and then, if a fine is imposed and remains\nunpaid and the court notifies the DMV, the violator receives a pre-deprivation notice directing\nfor that reason alone.  See Fowler I, 2017 WL 6379676, at *1 (under Michigan statutes, Secretary\nof State must suspend license within fourteen days of nonpayment with no pre-suspension\nnotification); Fowler II, 2017 WL 6540926, at *2-3 (further explaining Michigan statutory\nscheme under which payment extensions for a maximum of two weeks are given only to a\ndefendant who asks and only if the defendant can immediately pay half of the fine).  \n57 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 58 of 63\nhim or her to return to the court.  At that point, the court may consider indigency and can create a\npayment plan or adjust the fine. The pre-deprivation notice also advises the violator of the right\nto administrative, albeit limited, review.  Additional procedures here would be of little probative\nvalue.  \nFinally, the government has a strong interest in enforcing traffic fines to deter continuing\ntraffic violations.  E.g., Crawford, 271 F. Supp. 3d at 329 (\"Massachusetts has a substantial\ninterest in securing public safety on its roads by suspending the operating privileges of drivers\nwho default on [civil motor vehicle infractions].\") (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nWhen weighing all of these factors, I conclude that the Oregon scheme complies with\nprocedural due process.  The nature of the private interest, the nature of the government interest,\nand the low risk of erroneous deprivation support a determination that the opportunity to initially\ncontest the violation and the pre-deprivation notice with its instructions to return to court and\ninformation regarding the  right to administrative review, sufficiently protect an individual's\nproperty interest in his or her driver's license.  \nVI.  Remaining Preliminary Injunction Considerations \nHaving found that Plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on the merits of any of their claims,\nI do not need to consider the remaining preliminary injunction factors of the likelihood of\nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, balancing of the equities, and whether an\ninjunction is in the public interest.  Garcia, 786 F.3d at 740 (\"Because it is a threshold inquiry,\nwhen a plaintiff has failed to show the likelihood of success on the merits, we need not consider\nthe remaining three Winter elements.\") (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). \nNonetheless, I briefly address the factors to provide the parties, and the Ninth Circuit should this\n58 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 59 of 63\nruling be appealed, my analysis.  \nA.  Irreparable Harm\nPlaintiffs argue that any constitutional violation is, by definition, irreparable harm. \nHernandez, 872 F.3d at 994 (\"the deprivation of constitutional rights unquestionably constitutes\nirreparable injury\") (internal quotation marks omitted).  They also rely on the facts in their\nDeclarations which show the harm they have suffered from their license suspensions and which\nwill continue absent injunctive relief.  Every day, they state, they are faced with the impossible\nchoice between driving with a suspended license and risking deeper debt, and providing the basic\nnecessities of life for themselves and their families.  \nDefendants note that under the heightened standard for a mandatory injunction, Plaintiffs\nmust show that serious and extreme damage will occur absent preliminary injunctive relief. \nDefendants argue that the harm here is speculative.  They acknowledge that Plaintiffs have\ndescribed difficult lives in their Declarations.  But, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have not\nproven that without an immediate injunction some specific factors will cause an additional and\nirreparable harm.  They note that any injunctive relief will not address past harm and the future\nharms are only speculative.  \nDefendants' evidence establishes that there is no irreparable harm because even if I\ngranted the requested relief, Plaintiffs' licenses would remain suspended.  According to Mary\nGarcia, a Driver Control Operations and Policy Analyst for the DMV, the DMV driving records\nfor each Plaintiff9 show that each one would need to resolve additional suspensions and satisfy\n9  At the time, Chase had not yet been added as a Plaintiff and thus, Garcia's review\nexcluded him but included all the Plaintiffs named in the original Complaint.  \n59 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 60 of 63\nother requirements, separate from the suspensions for failure to comply and related reinstatement\nfees which they challenge here, before they could drive with an Oregon driver's license.  Garcia\nSupp'l Decl. ¶¶ 1, 3, ECF 36.  Some Plaintiffs are unable to reinstate his or her driver's license\nwithout submitting an insurance certificate.  Id. ¶¶ 4, 5, 7, 8 (Mendoza, Roberts, Bermudez,\nGanuelas).  All but Heath have additional suspensions for failure to appear.  Id.  Some need to\ntake a new driver's test.  Id. ¶¶ 5, 6, 7 (Roberts, Heath, Bermudez, Ganuelas).  I agree with\nDefendants that Plaintiffs cannot satisfy the standard required to show serious and extreme\ndamage which will be relieved by the injunctive relief sought.  See Robinson I, 2017 WL\n4418134, at * 6 (holding the temporary restraining order motion in that case in \"abeyance\" until\nthe two named plaintiffs filed proof that they had obtained the necessary insurance to comply\nwith the Tennessee driver financial responsibility laws which were not challenged). \nB.  Balance of Equities\nThis factor requires the court to \"balance the competing claims of injury\" and \"consider\nthe effect on each party of the granting or withholding of the requested relief.\"  Winter, 555 U.S.\nat 24 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Plaintiffs argue that the balance of hardships \"tips\nsharply\" in their favor.  Pls.' Mot. 40.  Absent injunctive relief, they risk (1) additional traffic\nviolations; (2) additional debt, (3) loss of employment opportunities that could alleviate their\npoverty, opportunities for family bonding, important life events, and cultural activities; and (4)\ncontinued struggles to provide food and ensure medical treatment of children being raised by\nsingle parents.  \nDefendants rely on the administrative burden it would take to process about 90,000\nlicense suspensions each year if it were required to assess a driver's ability to pay each time.  At\n60 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 61 of 63\nthis point, absent certification of a class, the relief is restricted to only the six named Plaintiffs. \nThus, the balance of equities goes to Plaintiffs.  \nC.  Public Interest\n\"The public interest inquiry primarily addresses impact on non-parties rather than\nparties.\"  League of Wilderness Defs/Blue Mountain Biodiversity Project v. Connaughton, 752\nF.3d 755, 766 (9th Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Plaintiffs note that if this Court\ncertifies the class, the injunction sought will affect thousands of other indigent traffic debtors.  \nPlaintiffs rely on the discussion in Hernandez which found that the interests of the general public\nwould be served by granting a preliminary injunction requiring immigration officials to consider\na detainee's financial ability to obtain a bond and alternative conditions of release.  872 F.3d at\n996-97.  The court there noted \"[g]enerally, public interest concerns are implicated when a\nconstitutional right has been violated, because all citizens have a stake in upholding the\nConstitution.\"  Id. at 996 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Plaintiffs argue that similar\nconcerns are implicated here.  The Hernandez court also noted that in addition to the hardships\nexperienced by the Plaintiffs in the absence of an injunction, the court may consider the \"indirect\nhardship to their friends and family.\"  Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).  Plaintiffs note the\nevidence here showing the collateral harm to Plaintiffs' children and spouses due to the loss of\ntheir driver's licenses.  Id.  Finally, the Hernandez court observed that the \"general public's\ninterest in the efficient allocation of the government's fiscal resources favors granting the\ninjunction.\"  Id.  Plaintiffs argue that while discovery will reveal the actual financial and\nadministrative resources expended by DMV in suspending the licenses of indigent traffic debtors,\nany money spent supporting this \"irrational and counterproductive policy is a wasted one.\"  Pls.\n61 - OPINION & ORDER\n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 40    Filed 12/12/18    Page 62 of 63\nReply 26.\nDefendants make no separate \"public interest\" argument other than to state that their\nadministrative burden argument supports a conclusion that Plaintiffs cannot show that an\ninjunction would be in the public interest.\nGiven that Plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on their constitutional claims and that their'\nargument relies on the class certification motion being granted, which it has not, at this point, I\nfind the public interest to be a neutral factor.  \nSUMMARY\nFor the reasons explained above, I conclude that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated a\nlikelihood of success on the merits as to any of their three claims.  Plaintiffs may be correct that\nsuspending driver's licenses for indigent traffic debtors is an exercise in futility.  While the record\nshows that the threat of suspension, or the actual suspension, of a driver's license has prompted\nsome Plaintiffs to make payments on traffic debt from time to time, I assume that for the majority\nof indigent traffic debtors, suspension is misguided and counterproductive.  I recognize that\nPlaintiffs' economic situations are marginal and the loss of their driver's licenses for their\ninability to pay their traffic debt burdens their lives with little chance that the state will actually\ncollect full payment.  Nonetheless, their predicaments, as desperate as they may be, do not raise\nconstitutional claims.  Absent constitutional implications, it is not the court's position to\ndetermine if the statutory scheme is \"unwise,\" whether it \"best fulfills the relevant social and\neconomic objections\" that the state \"might ideally espouse,\" or if \"a more just and humane\nsystem could not be devised.\"  Dandridge, 397 U.S. at 487.

INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  During the past ten years, the Oregon DMV suspended Oregonians’ driver’s \nlicenses 334,338 times for failure to pay fines, costs, and fees arising from minor traffic citations \n(“traffic debt”).  Of the approximately 3.1 million Oregonians who hold driver’s licenses,1 as \nmany as 10 percent have had their licenses suspended for failure to pay traffic debt.  \n2.  Approximately 536,146 Oregonians live below the federal poverty line, about \n                                                 \n1 In 2016, there were 3,100,321 “drivers of issuance” in Oregon. This includes all license \nholders with active, expired, and non-active driving privileges. See 2016 Oregon DMV Driver \nStatistics Report (Run date: 1/18/17). \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT - 2 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 1    Filed 09/07/18    Page 3 of 37\n   \n13% of the state’s population.  “Oregon 2017,” Talk Poverty, https://talkpoverty.org/state-year-\nreport/oregon-2017-report/ (last visited August 23, 2018).  Oregonians living in poverty struggle \nto pay for basic necessities like food and shelter and cannot afford to pay traffic debt.  \n3.  The DMV suspends driver’s licenses for failure to pay traffic debt without \nconsidering an individual’s ability to pay her traffic debt and exempting from suspension those \nlow-income individuals who cannot pay.   \n4.  License suspension may be an appropriate way to secure payment from \nindividuals who can afford to pay traffic debt but willfully refuse to do so.  For low-income \nindividuals, this statutory regime punishes them for being poor.  \n5.  For the vast majority of Oregonians, driving is the only reliable means of \ntransportation to find and maintain employment, to get to medical appointments, to take their \nchildren to school, and to shop for necessities, including food.   \n6.  Without paying down their traffic debt, low-income Oregonians cannot regain \ntheir licenses for 20 years.  \n7.  License suspensions lead to further financial and legal burdens, including charges \nfor driving with a suspended license, and additional fees and fines.  A minor traffic infraction – \nsuch as failing to buckle a seatbelt or driving with a defective taillight – can plunge low-income \npeople into a legal and financial rut from which any reasonable person would struggle to escape. \n8.  Plaintiffs and class members in this case are among tens of thousands of \nOregonians who have lost their driver’s licenses, and cannot get them back, simply because of \ntheir poverty.   \n9.  Punishing people for being unable to pay traffic debt violates the Due Process and \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT - 3 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 1    Filed 09/07/18    Page 4 of 37\n   \nEqual Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution.   \n10.  Plaintiffs and class members, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly \nsituated, seek declaratory and injunctive relief against Matthew Garrett, in his official capacity as \nDirector of the ODOT; Tammy Baney, in her official capacity as Chair of the OTC; Sean \nO’Hollaren, in his official capacity as Member of the OTC; Bob Van Brocklin, in his official \ncapacity as Member of the OTC; Martin Callery, in his official capacity as Member of the OTC; \nand Tom McClellan, in his official capacity as Administrator of the DMV, to end this \nunconstitutional statutory scheme.   \n11.  The DMV should refrain from suspending the driver’s licenses of low-income \nindividuals who cannot afford to pay their traffic debt.  Alternatively, the DMV should \nimplement an ability-to-pay determination process that comports with due process and equal \nprotection prior to suspending driver licenses for failure to pay traffic debt, and provide \nsubsequent opportunities to lift suspensions because of indigence.  \nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n12.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C §§ 1331 and \n1343, in that Plaintiffs’ claims arise under the Fourteenth Amendment and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n13.  Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) because a \nsubstantial part of the events giving rise to these claims occurred in the District.   \nIII.      PARTIES \n14.  Plaintiff Cindy Mendoza is a resident of Portland, Oregon. \n15.  Plaintiff Gloria Bermudez is a resident of Portland, Oregon. \n16.  Plaintiff Cekais Toni Ganuelas is a resident of Mission, Oregon. \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT - 4 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 1    Filed 09/07/18    Page 5 of 37\n   \n17.  Plaintiff Karl Wade Roberts is a resident of Baker City, Oregon. \n18.  Plaintiff Rebecca Heath is a resident of Pendleton, Oregon. \n19.  Defendant Matthew Garrett is the Director of ODOT.  Director Garrett supervises \nand has authority over the activities of ODOT, including those designed to promote traffic safety \nand issuing driving privileges to Oregon residents.  As part of his duties, Director Garrett \nappoints and supervises the Administrator of the DMV.  DMV’s mission is to promote driver \nsafety, and it is responsible for issuing driving privileges to Oregon residents.  Director Garrett is \nsued in his official capacity. \n20.  Defendant Tammy Baney is the Chair, and Defendants Sean O’Hollaren, Bob \nVan Brocklin, and Martin Callery are Members, of the OTC. Among other things, the Chair and \nMembers of the OTC are responsible for establishing policies and adopting rules and orders \ngoverning the operation of ODOT, including policies, rules, and orders related to traffic safety \nand issuing driving privileges to Oregon residents. Commissioners Baney, O’Hollaren, Van \nBrocklin, and Callery are sued in their official capacity. \n21.  Defendant Tom McClellan is the Administrator of the DMV.  Administrator \nMcClellan supervises and is responsible for the activities, policies, and practices of the DMV, \nincluding suspending driver licenses of licensees who are unable to pay court debts for traffic \nviolations. He is sued in his official capacity.  \n… \n… \n… \n… \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT - 5 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 1    Filed 09/07/18    Page 6 of 37\n   \n \nIV.     FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  The DMV is Unconstitutionally Punishing Low-Income Traffic Debtors Solely \nBecause of their Poverty. \n \ni.  A Driver’s License is Necessary to Maintain Employment and to \nAccess Essential Services.  \n \n22.  In Oregon, the majority of workers commute by car.  Approximately 82% of \nOregonians over the age of 16 travel to work by car, either alone or in a carpool.2  Statewide, \nonly 4.3% of residents commute by public transportation, while 6.4% get to work by bicycle or \non foot.3 \n23.  For most Oregonians, public transit is not a viable commuting alternative.  In 32 \nof Oregon’s 34 counties, at least 40% of residents do not live within a .25-mile radius of a stop \noperated by any transit agency.  In 28 of Oregon’s 34 counties, the percentage is more than 50%.  \nAccess is worse in rural areas.  More than 64% of Umatilla County residents and more than 75% \nof Baker City residents lack access to public transit. \n24.  Not having a valid driver’s license is a direct barrier to employment because \nmany lower paying jobs require a driver’s license.  Alana Semuels, “No Driver’s License, No \nJob,” The Atlantic (June 15, 2016), https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/06/no-\ndrivers-license-no-job/486653/.  A study of New Jersey drivers found that 42% of drivers lost \ntheir jobs after their driver’s licenses were suspended. Jon A. Carnegie, Ian M. Voohees \n                                                 \n2 U.S. Dep’t of Transp., Bur. Of Transp. Stats., OREGON: Transportation by the \nNumbers (2016), https://www.bts.gov/sites/bts.dot.gov/files/legacy/oregon.pdf \n3 Id. \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT - 6 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 1    Filed 09/07/18    Page 7 of 37\n   \nTransportation Center, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Driver’s License \nSuspensions, Impacts and Fairness Study 56 (2007), http://njgov/transportation/refdata/research \n/reports/FHW A-NJ-2007-0200-VI.pdf. \n25.  Driver’s license suspensions also deprive low-income individuals of employment \nopportunities because private employers often screen out applicants who do not have driver’s \nlicenses.4 People who are able to travel farther distances also have access to a greater number of \njob opportunities in different locations.5     \n26.  In urban areas, like Portland, where gentrification and a housing crisis have \ndisplaced low-income people and people of color, the ability to travel to work longer distances is \ncrucial.6 \n27.  In rural areas of Oregon, most employment is accessible only by car due to the \ndistances between home and work. \n28.  A Pew Research Center Study found that 86% of Americans consider a car to be a \n“necessity of life,” higher than the percentage of people who identified cell phones as a necessity \nat 47% or microwaves at 45%.7 \n29.  The loss of a driver’s license affects the driver’s basic self-sufficiency.  In \naddition to requiring a car to travel to work, most Oregonians must drive to obtain medical care, \nto travel to the grocery store to buy food and clothing, and to ensure the care and education of \n                                                 \n4 Stephen Bingham et al., Stopped, Fined, Arrested: Racial Bias in Policing and Traffic \nCourts in California, 26-28 (2016).  \n5 Id., referring generally to Adie Tomer et al., Brookings Institute, Missed Opportunity: \nTransit and Jobs in Metropolitan America (2011). \n6 Id. \n7 Paul Taylor and Wendy Wang et al., The Fading Glory of The Television and \nTelephone, Pew Research Center 1 (Aug. 10, 2010), http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/3/2011/01/Final-TV-and-Telephone.pdf \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT - 7 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 1    Filed 09/07/18    Page 8 of 37\n   \ntheir children. \n30.  Even in urban areas, where public transportation is more widely available, taking \nbuses or trains is not a viable option for many people.  Delays create the risk of a late arrival to \nwork or a tardy pick up of a child from a childcare facility.  Multiple transfers require departure \nearly in the morning and return late in the evening, hours when childcare is either very expensive \nor unavailable.  A low-income person cannot afford to simply pay for a taxi or summon an Uber \nor Lyft to get them where they need to go. \nii.  Oregon’s License Suspension Regime for Traffic Debtors. \n \n31.  In Oregon, a minor traffic violation8 results in the imposition of a fine, based on \nthe violation’s statutory classification. See ORS §§ 153.012, 153.018-153.021.   \n32.  Oregon circuit courts abide by a uniform fine schedule. ORS § 153.800.9  In \ngeneral, courts may not “defer, waive, suspend or otherwise reduce the fine” below the statutory \nminimum. ORS § 153.021. \n33.  When a driver is charged with a traffic violation, the officer issues him or her a \ncitation with the corresponding “presumptive fine.” ORS §§ 153.019, 153.020.  For example, \nfailing to signal a turn is a Class D violation. ORS § 811.335(1)(b).  The presumptive fine is \n$115.  ORS § 153.019(1)(d).  Driving 11 to 20 miles per hour in excess of the speed limit, is a \nClass C traffic violation. ORS § 811.109(1)(b). The presumptive fine for this violation is $165. \n                                                 \n8 “Traffic offense” is the umbrella term for actions that violate Oregon traffic laws and \nordinances. ORS § 801.555. An offense is a “traffic violation” if the sentence does not include \njail time. ORS § 153.008.   \n9 See Office of the State Court Administrator, 2018 “Schedule of Fines” on Violations \n(SOF-18), available at \nhttps://digital.osl.state.or.us/islandora/object/osl%3A104207/datastream/OBJ/view. \n \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT - 8 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 1    Filed 09/07/18    Page 9 of 37\n   \nORS § 153.019(1)(c).   \n34.  People who can afford to pay traffic violation fines simply pay them. However, \nmany Oregonians cannot afford a $100 to $200 fine. \n35.  According to a recent Federal Reserve survey, approximately 40% of Americans \nreported that they did not have enough money to cover a $400 emergency expense.10  More than \n13% of Oregonians live below the federal poverty line.11  The rate of food insecurity is even \nhigher, affecting 552,900 Oregonians.12 \n36.  In Oregon, traffic debt is collected by courts, private collections agencies, the \nOregon Department of Revenue.  The DMV also collects reinstatement and issuance fees, a \nportion of the traffic debt. \n37.  Circuit courts generally provide a 35-day window for collection of traffic fines \nand fees; after that time, a “failure to comply” license sanction is entered and the account \nbecomes delinquent.  See ORS § 809.210 (2017).  See also Oregon Judicial Department Financial \nCase Processing Manual – Collections (updated Dec. 2017), at p. 5. \n38.  In Multnomah County, the court imposes the following fees if a debtor fails to \nsatisfy a monetary judgment within 30 days: $50 for amounts up to $149.99; $125 for amounts \nfrom $150 to $399.99; or $200 for amounts greater than $400.14 \n                                                 \n10 Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2017, May 2018, at 21, \navailable at https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2017-report-economic-well-being-\nus-households-201805.pdf. \n11 U.S. Census Bureau, Quick Facts: Oregon, available at \nhttps://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/or/INC110216. \n12 Oregon Food Bank, Hunger in Oregon, available at \nhttps://www.oregonfoodbank.org/our-work/hunger-in-oregon/. \n14 Schedule available at \nhttps://www.courts.oregon.gov/courts/multnomah/payments/Pages/faq.aspx  \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT - 9 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 1    Filed 09/07/18    Page 10 of 37\n   \n39.  If an individual does not pay her debt in full within the required time, the court \nmay send the account to a private collections agency or the Oregon Department of Revenue, \nresulting in even more costs and fees. See ORS §§ 1.102(2), 293.231, 697.105. Clackamas \nCounty Circuit Court, for example, adds a 28% fee to delinquent account balances when it refers \ndebts to the Department of Revenue or a private collection agency. \n40.  When a traffic debtor “fails or refuses to pay” traffic debt, the court may do one \nof the following: (1) issue a notice of suspension to the Department of Transportation that directs \nthe department to implement procedures under ORS § 809.416 or (2) order a defendant’s driving \nprivileges restricted.  ORS § 809.210(1)(a) & (b).   \n41.  The statute does not require courts to make a pre-suspension ability-to-pay \ndetermination. \n42.  When the deadline passes without payment from the licensee, court clerks notify \nthe DMV of the nonpayment of the debt. \n43.  The clerks automatically send notices of the delinquencies to the DMV without \nany individualized inquiry into the reason for nonpayment, including the licensee’s ability to pay \nthe debt.  Judges are not involved in the process. \n44.  Courts impose a $15 fee each time they send notification to the DMV for failure \nto comply with payment of court fees, fines, and costs. ORS § 809.267. \n45.  Pursuant to ORS § 809.416(2)-(3), the DMV suspends a traffic debtor’s driver’s \nlicense upon receipt of a notice of suspension and issuance of a 60-day warning to the traffic \ndebtor.   \n46.  To avoid or end the suspension, the traffic debtor must present the DMV with a \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT - 10 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 1    Filed 09/07/18    Page 11 of 37\n   \nnotice of reinstatement issued by the court showing that she “(A) [i]s making payments, has paid \nthe fine[,] or has obeyed the order of the court; or (B) [h]as enrolled in a preapprenticeship \nprogram…or is a registered apprentice.” ORS § 809.416(2).   \n47.  Unless a licensee pays her traffic debt, she generally must wait 20 years “from the \ndate the traffic offense occurred” before the suspension on her driver’s license is lifted.  Id. ORS \n§ 809.415(4)(a)(B).   \n48.  While a traffic debtor can request administrative review of her suspension, \ninability to pay is not a defense.  ORS §§ 809.415(4)(b), 809.440. \n49.  Oregon’s circuit courts allow, but do not oblige, courts to offer payment plans for \ntraffic debt.  These plans come with additional fees, and minimum monthly payment amounts are \ncalculated based on the amount owed, without consideration of the debtor’s financial \ncircumstances.  These courts may add a fee that is at least $50 and as much as $200 “to any \njudgment that includes a monetary obligation that the court or judicial branch is charged with \ncollecting.” ORS § 1.202(1).  See also Chief Justice Order No. 11-027 (June 20, 2011).  \nMunicipal courts may, or may not, offer any payment plan at all. \n50.  If an individual enters into a payment plan, the suspension may be re-imposed “if \nthe person ceases making payments before the fine is paid in full.” ORS § 809.210(4)(a). \n51.  License holders are not permitted to be heard by the DMV on the question of \nwhether they are able to afford their payment plan or whether their poverty caused them to miss \npayments. \n52.  Once a driver has had her license suspended, she risks being cited for driving with \na suspended license.  This is an additional, new traffic violation, ORS § 811.175, with a \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT - 11 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 1    Filed 09/07/18    Page 12 of 37\n   \npresumptive fine of $440, ORS § 153.019(1)(a), subject to the same debt collection and license \nsuspension procedures. \n53.  Low-income debtors who manage to pay down their traffic debt within the 20-\nyear suspension period face one final economic barrier: a $75 reinstatement fee, and issuance \nfees between $26.50 and $68, depending on whether the debtor’s driver’s license has expired \nwith the passage of time. ORS § 807.370(5), (25), (33). \n54.  Fee waivers for reinstatements and issuance fees are available, but not on the \nbasis that the requester is unable to pay. ORS §§ 809.380(6)(a)-(L), 809.380(7). \n55.  In 2017 alone, 2,433 Oregonians were eligible for license reinstatement after \ntraffic debt-related suspension, but they did not pay reinstatement and issuance fees. \n56.  Low-income Oregonians struggle to supply food for their families, pay utilities, \nand pay rent.  Even when they scrape together the funds to discharge traffic debt, paying an \nadditional $150 or more for the reinstatement and issuance of their driver’s license is a final, \nsignificant obstacle. \niii.  Consequences of Oregon’s License Suspension Law. \n \n \n57.  Between 2012 and 2017, the DMV issued an average of 33,482 license \nsuspensions each year because of a driver’s failure to pay court debts arising out of traffic \nviolations.   \n58.  Oregon’s driver’s license suspension statute, ORS § 809.416, puts low-income \npeople in an impossible position.  They either stop driving, making it impossible to meet their \nwork and family obligations, or drive illegally, placing themselves at risk of being cited for \ndriving with a suspended license and further compounding their traffic debt. \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT - 12 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 1    Filed 09/07/18    Page 13 of 37\n   \n59.  Tens of thousands of Oregon residents take the risk of driving with a suspended \nlicense each year.  In 2010, DMV reported 40,837 drivers were convicted for driving on a \nsuspended license. See Joseph Rose, “After 7 Suspensions, Why Hasn’t Oregon Revoked \nJefferson Smith’s License?,” The Oregonian/Oregon Live (August 22, 2012); See also Nick \nMorgan, “Many Oregon Drivers Undeterred by Suspended Licenses,” The Associated Press \n(January 4, 2018); Eric Hidle, “Driving While Suspended in Oregon: Thousands do it, but law \nofficers say little can be done to solve the problem,” The Bulletin (April 25, 2011). \n60.  With each violation for driving on a suspended license – a new traffic violation – \nlow-income residents amass even more traffic debt.  The fine for driving on a suspended license, \na class A traffic violation, is presumptively $440, with a minimum fine of $225 and a maximum \nfine of $2,000. ORS § 153.019. \n61.  Low-income people who rely on their vehicles, but cannot afford to pay their \ntraffic debts, risk these additional fines and punishments every time they drive. \nB.  The DMV’s License Suspension Scheme, Which Provides No Indigency \nException for Traffic Debtors, Is Unconstitutional.   \n  \ni.  Discriminatory Debt Collection.  \n62.  Drivers of all income levels are cited for minor traffic violations, but in Oregon, \nthe consequences of these citations are far worse for drivers who are poor. \n63.  Moderate and high-income drivers can easily avoid license suspension by simply \npaying their fines.  Wealthier drivers can get numerous traffic violations, pay the fines, and keep \ndriving.  \n64.  For low-income drivers, paying a $115 to $440 fine for a traffic violation is an \ninsurmountable obstacle.  Unlike higher-income drivers who can afford to pay these fines, an \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT - 13 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 1    Filed 09/07/18    Page 14 of 37\n   \nindigent driver has no way to avoid suspension.   \n65.  Under Oregon’s wealth-based license suspension regime, indigent drivers can be \ncited for one minor traffic violation and find themselves plunged deeper into debt as they risk \nfurther fines for driving while suspended. \n66.  Oregonians who owe traffic debt to county, municipal, or justice courts also are \nsingled out for harsh and discriminatory treatment compared to other types of indigent debtors. \n67.  ORS § 809.416 differentiates between traffic debtors who committed bicycle, \npedestrian, or parking offenses and other traffic debtors. See also ORS § 809.210(7) (prohibiting \ncourts from sending a notice of suspension to those who have failed to pay fines for bicycle, \npedestrian or parking offenses). \n68.  A low-income person who is cited for failing to signal or stop on a bicycle, ORS § \n814.440, but who cannot afford to pay the fine, will not have her license suspended.  By contrast, \nan indigent person who owes a fine for driving with a broken taillight and cannot pay her court \ndebt is punished with a license suspension and related negative consequences. \n69.  Similarly, private judgment debtors in civil actions in Oregon, such as individuals \nindebted to credit card companies, are not subject to a suspension of their driver’s licenses if they \nare too poor to pay their debt. \n70.  While both debtors may find themselves subject to collection actions by private \ncollection firms, a private debt holder does not risk losing his driver’s license if he cannot afford \nto make payments or pay the balance in full.  By contrast, traffic debtors receive an automatic \npunishment of suspension simply because they owe a debt to the state.   \n71.  Indigent child support debtors also receive more procedural protections than do \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT - 14 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 1    Filed 09/07/18    Page 15 of 37\n   \ntraffic debtors.  \n72.  Oregon suspends driver’s licenses for failure to pay child support.  ORS § \n25.750(1)(a).  However, child support debtors have the ability to avoid suspension of their \ndriver’s licenses at the following three stages: (1) at the establishment of a support obligation, \nORS § 25.275(1)(a)-(d); (2) at any modification proceeding, ORS § 25.280, 25.287(5), OAR \n137-055-3430(3)(c)(B) (“substantial change” warranting modification includes financial \nchanges); and (3) once the child support debtor’s payments are in arrears, ORS § 25.750(1)(a). \n73.  Unlike traffic debtors, child support debtors also are accorded a six-month, \nindefinitely renewable “hardship exception” to reduce or eliminate the parent’s obligations upon \ndemonstration of that parent’s inability to pay.  OAR 137-055-4420(10). \n74.  Accordingly, in Oregon, a parent who owes child support can avoid suspension of \nhis driver’s license by demonstrating he cannot afford his child support obligation.  By contrast, \na single parent who receives no child support, and is responsible for her children, will lose her \ndriver’s license simply because she is too poor to pay a fine for a broken tail light violation. \nC.  The DMV’s License Suspension Scheme Deprives Traffic Debtors of Procedural \nDue Process. \n \ni.  Indigent Traffic Debtors Are Not Afforded an Ability-to-Pay Hearing. \n \n75.  For low-income traffic debtors in Oregon, having a driver’s license to operate a \ncar is much more than a mode of transportation.  It is an essential tool to maintain self-\nsufficiency, to find or keep a job, and to care for one’s children. \n76.  Unlike child support debtors who have several opportunities to establish their \nindigence to avoid license suspensions, traffic debtors have no right to have their indigence \ndetermined, by any entity, at any point prior to or during their suspension.  The DMV does not \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT - 15 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 1    Filed 09/07/18    Page 16 of 37\n   \nevaluate ability-to-pay nor ensure that any entity has made such a determination prior to or \nduring the period of suspension.  \n77.  Although the Oregon Judicial Department allows circuit courts to offer payment \nplans, minimum payment amounts are tied to the total debt amount rather than to the amount the \ndebtor can afford to pay each month.  In addition, these plans involve additional fees.  Some \nmunicipal courts may not offer any payment plan. \n78.  Delinquent payment plans generally result in courts automatically generating a \nnotice of suspension. \n79.  Once the DMV issues a driver’s license suspension notice, debtors can only avoid \nsuspension by obtaining a notice of reinstatement from the court indicating full payment or \npayment plan compliance, or engagement in certain apprenticeship programs.  ORS § \n809.416(2)(a)-(b).  Debtors have no opportunity to avoid or challenge the suspension based on \ninability to pay. \n80.  Administrative review of the DMV’s suspension does not stay the suspension and \nis limited to an evaluation of criteria unrelated to the debtor’s ability to pay or indigency.  ORS § \n809.415((4)(b) and ORS § 809.440(2);  \n81.  At no point during the process of suspending driver’s licenses does the DMV \nprovide a procedure for low-income traffic debtors to demonstrate that they are unable to pay \ntheir traffic debt. \n82.  For indigent traffic debtors who cannot afford to pay their traffic debt or make the \nminimum payments under a payment plan, Oregon’s lack of pre-suspension procedural \nsafeguards results in hundreds of thousands of low-income individuals systematically being \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT - 16 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 1    Filed 09/07/18    Page 17 of 37\n   \npunished for being poor.   \nD.  The Named Plaintiffs. \ni.  Cindy Mendoza \n83.  Cindy Mendoza is 28-year-old resident of Portland, Oregon.  Ms. Mendoza is \nraising three sons on her own: a 2-year-old toddler, a 7-year old, and a 9-year old.   \n84.  Ms. Mendoza lives in a two-bedroom subsidized apartment.  Until recently, Ms. \nMendoza and her children lived in a motel room; they were forced to move to the motel after \ntheir previous residence, a homeless shelter, became uninhabitable after the roof caved in from a \nheavy leak.  \n85.  Ms. Mendoza is currently unemployed.  She is looking for work, but has had \ndifficulty finding a job without a valid driver’s license.  She receives approximately $1,100 \nmonthly in assistance, including food stamps.  She has no other source of income, placing her \nfamily well below the federal poverty line.  \n86.  Near the end of every month, Ms. Mendoza’s family struggles without enough \nfood.  She has to try to find free food boxes at pantries so that her family has something to eat.   \n87.  The first time Ms. Mendoza’s driver’s license was suspended was on June 8, \n2010, after getting a traffic violation in Wasco County for speeding.  The ticket was for $400.  \nMs. Mendoza was unemployed at the time and had a new baby.  She could not afford to pay the \ntraffic fine.  The amount increased to $812 with court costs and fees and the debt was referred to \na collections agency.  \n88.  It took Ms. Mendoza five years, but after obtaining steady employment, she was \nfinally able to pay off her debt to Wasco County Circuit Court and her license was reinstated in \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT - 17 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 1    Filed 09/07/18    Page 18 of 37\n   \nApril 2015. \n89.  However, prior to paying off that debt, Ms. Mendoza was cited a few more times \nfor driving on a suspended license.  These additional traffic citations put her in a downward \nspiral, making it impossible for her to ever get caught up. \n90.  Ms. Mendoza’s driver’s license is currently suspended because she owes \n$1,660.37 to Milwaukie Municipal Court for various traffic violations, including a January 8, \n2016, citation for driving on a suspended license.  DMV suspended her license on April 8, 2016 \ndue to her inability to pay her court debt for these traffic violations.   \n91.  Ms. Mendoza also owes $2,020.40 to Beaverton Municipal Court for non-\npayment of court fines and fees for another driving on a suspended license traffic violation that \noccurred on August 24, 2013.  The DMV suspended her license for non-payment of her court \ndebt on July 29, 2015.13 \n92.  Additionally, Ms. Mendoza owes $7,602 in unpaid court fines and fees to \nClackamas County Circuit Court for failing to appear at her arraignment for a misdemeanor \ntraffic case involving a car accident with property damage only.  Ms. Mendoza is on a payment \nplan for this case, but she cannot afford to pay $100 per month to the court when she is \nunemployed and is the sole provider for her three children.  Because Ms. Mendoza has missed \nher payments, in June 2018 Clackamas Circuit Court referred her debt to collections.  She \nanticipates that the court will also send a notice to the DMV to suspend her driver’s license. \n93.  The DMV never considered whether Ms. Mendoza could afford to pay her traffic \n                                                 \n13 The DMV also suspended Ms. Mendoza’s license on October 11, 2013 due to her \nfailure to appear for a hearing in that same case, but that suspension is no longer active. \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT - 18 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 1    Filed 09/07/18    Page 19 of 37\n   \ndebt before suspending her license. \n94.  The DMV has not offered Ms. Mendoza any opportunity to reinstate her license \nbased on her inability to pay. \n95.  In total, Ms. Mendoza owes $11,282.77 to three courts. If she could afford to, Ms. \nMendoza would pay these debts, or make periodic payments to reduce the amounts of debt she \nowes. \n96.  Due to her poverty, it impossible for Ms. Mendoza to pay this sum to get her \ndriver’s license reinstated.  In fact, she is too poor to pay anything at all.  Therefore, she cannot \nbenefit from a payment plan, even though one has been offered to her. \n97.  Meanwhile, Ms. Mendoza continues to drive, risking further traffic violations for \ndriving on a suspended license.  She is looking for employment, but is limited in the types of \njobs that she can apply for because she does not have a driver’s license.  Recently she inquired \nabout a position as a street “flagger” for construction jobs, but she was turned away because the \njob required a valid driver’s license.  Ms. Mendoza has also had a difficult time finding work that \nis close to her apartment so that she can avoid using her car for transportation. \n98.  Nevertheless, Ms. Mendoza continues to drive so that she can get her children to \nmedical appointments and to buy clothes and food for her family.   \n99.  Ms. Mendoza knows she is taking a risk driving on a suspended driver’s license, \nbut she feels as though she has no other choice because she is too poor to pay enormous sums of \ntraffic debt and relies on her vehicle to provide necessities for herself and her family. \nii.  Gloria Bermudez \n100.  Gloria Bermudez is a 36-year-old resident of Portland, Oregon.  She is a single \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT - 19 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 1    Filed 09/07/18    Page 20 of 37\n   \nmother with four children, ages 11, 8, 7 and 6.  She is the sole wage earner for her family.  Ms. \nBermudez works as a cook at a restaurant in a shopping mall. She earns $14 per hour or \napproximately $1,600 per month.  She also receives approximately $420 per month in food \nstamps to help feed her family.   \n101.  Ms. Bermudez struggles to keep up with her electric, gas, and phone bills every \nmonth.  Frequently, by the end of the month, she seeks free food at pantries to put food on the \ntable. \n102.  Ms. Bermudez’s driver’s license is currently suspended because she is unable to \npay a total of $2,812.38 in traffic debt to two courts, Multnomah County Circuit Court and \nWashington County Justice Court. \n103.  Ms. Bermudez owes $1,902.38 to Multnomah County Circuit Court related to \nthree different traffic violation cases.   \n104.  In one of the cases, she was cited on February 22, 2003 for failing to obey a \ntraffic control device.  The ticket – originally for $175 – grew to $299.16 with additional court \nfees and costs.  Initially, her license was suspended, in May 2003, because she failed to appear at \nher arraignment.  Her debt was sent to collections.  The court later set her up on a payment plan \nand her license was reinstated on May 12, 2010.  However, she couldn’t afford to keep up with \nthese $50 payments, so the DMV suspended her license again – this time based on her failure to \npay her traffic debt – on September 14, 2012.  \n105.  In another case, she was cited on July 1, 2013 for failing to use proper child seats \nfor her two children.  This was originally a $120 ticket, but grew to $237 with added fees.  The \nDMV suspended her license due to her inability to pay that amount on October 7, 2013.    \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT - 20 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 1    Filed 09/07/18    Page 21 of 37\n   \n106.  At the time that Ms. Bermudez was cited for improper use of child seats, she was \nalso cited for driving on a suspended license, driving with expired tags, and driving while \nuninsured.  In this related case, Ms. Bermudez owes $1,306 in unpaid court fines and fees to \nMultnomah County Circuit Court for failing to appear at her arraignment.  The DMV suspended \nher driver’s license in that case on January 21, 2014.   \n107.  Ms. Bermudez estimates that, during the past ten years, she has paid hundreds of \ndollars in payments to Multnomah County Circuit Court, but she always fell behind on these \npayments because she did not have enough money to keep up.  \n108.  Ms. Bermudez also owes Washington County Justice Court a total of $910 for \ntraffic debt.   \n109.  In one of the cases, she was cited on July 2, 2012 for driving while operating a \ncell phone, driving without proof of insurance, and for driving with a suspended license.  Due to \nher inability to pay $470 in fines and fees for that case, the DMV suspended her driver’s license \non October 7, 2013.   \n110.  In her 2012 case, Ms. Bermudez was offered a payment plan of $75 per month to \npay her traffic debt.  However, she was not able to make her initial payment on August 24, 2012 \nbecause she had recently given birth to a premature baby and had no money to spare.  She hand-\ndelivered a letter to the court explaining these circumstances.  The court did not offer to \neliminate or further reduce her payments under the plan.  \n111.  More recently, on February 24, 2018, Ms. Bermudez was stopped by the police \nwhile driving home late after work.  She was cited for driving on a suspended license.  Ms. \nBermudez owes another $440 for this traffic violation.  She received a letter, on April 6, 2018, \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT - 21 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 1    Filed 09/07/18    Page 22 of 37\n   \nfrom Washington County Justice Court informing her that if she is unable to pay this amount or \nbegin making payments by April 20, 2018, the court would send a notice of suspension to the \nDMV.  Ms. Bermudez cannot afford to pay this debt either.  She fears receiving another notice \nby mail from the DMV informing her that her driver’s license will be suspended for failing to \npay this additional traffic debt. \n112.  The DMV never considered whether Ms. Bermudez could afford to pay her traffic \ndebt before suspending her license. \n113.  DMV has not offered Ms. Bermudez any opportunity to reinstate her license \nbased on her inability to pay. \n114.  If Ms. Bermudez could afford to pay down her court debts, she would.  However, \nher poverty makes it impossible for her to apply any amount of money towards this debt. \n115.  Ms. Bermudez has continued to drive despite the risk that she may be cited again \nfor driving on a suspended license.  Her workplace is about seven miles away from her home.  It \ntakes her 25 minutes to drive to work.  It would take her about an hour to get to work on city \nbuses. \n116.  Ms. Bermudez also drives her four children to school, which is a 5- to 10-minute \ncar ride.  The alternative, that her children board a school bus at 6:45am to take an hour-long bus \nride to their school, would result in her young children becoming sleep-deprived, jeopardizing \ntheir ability to learn at school, as well as increasing their chances of numerous health problems.14  \nMs. Bermudez also drives to buy groceries at the store and to take her children to medical \n                                                 \n14 See https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/sleep/conditioninfo/sleep-deprivation; See \nalso https://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/sleep.htm. \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT - 22 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 1    Filed 09/07/18    Page 23 of 37\n   \nappointments.  \n117.  Ms. Bermudez knows she risks getting more traffic violations for driving on a \nsuspended license, which also means amassing more court debt.  However, she feels as though \nshe has no other choice to maintain her job and transport her family. \niii.  Cekais Toni Ganuelas \n118.  Cekais Toni Ganuelas is a 27-year-old resident of Mission, Oregon, which is \nabout six miles outside of Pendleton.  She and her 8-year-old daughter live in a room they rent \nfrom a friend.   \n119.  Until recently, Ms. Ganuelas worked as a bartender at a restaurant in Pendleton.  \nShe worked about twenty hours per week and earned minimum wage plus tips, or about $400 per \nweek.  She was fired in late July 2018 when she failed to show up for work due to transportation \ndifficulties.  Since Ms. Ganuelas lost her job, her only source of income is $140 per month from \nteaching yoga.  She does not currently receive food stamps or cash assistance.  \n120.  Ms. Ganuelas is an enrolled member of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla \nIndian Reservation.  The Tribes operate a shuttle service between Pendleton and Mission, \nOregon.  Ms. Ganuelas is able to use the shuttle some days.  However, the shuttle runs only \nbetween about 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Monday through Saturday.  The shuttle was not a viable option \nfor Ms. Ganuelas when she was working as a bartender because her shifts began and ended at \nirregular hours, including late at night.  In addition, the shuttle stopped on the opposite side of a \nbusy four-lane highway, requiring her to make a dangerous crossing on foot to get to work.   \n121.  In 2012, Ms. Ganuelas was cited for failure to display plates.  She was unable to \npay her $150 ticket, so the Pendleton Municipal Court notified the DMV.  The DMV suspended \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT - 23 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 1    Filed 09/07/18    Page 24 of 37\n   \nher driver’s license on July 16, 2012. \n122.  Since Ms. Ganuela’s license suspension in 2012, she has received multiple \nadditional suspension notices for failure to pay traffic debt.   \n123.  Most recently, the DMV sent Ms. Ganuelas a notice of suspension on October 27, \n2016, notifying her that her license would be suspended effective December 25, 2016.  That \nsuspension was in connection with her failure to pay a $195 speeding ticket in Umatilla County \nCircuit Court.   \n124.  Ms. Ganuelas has also been cited at least three times for driving with a suspended \nlicense.   \n125.  The DMV never considered whether Ms. Ganuelas could afford to pay her traffic \ndebt before suspending her license. \n126.  DMV has not offered Ms. Ganuelas any opportunity to reinstate her license based \non her inability to pay. \n127.  Ms. Ganuelas believes that she currently owes in excess of $750 in traffic debt to \nthree courts: Umatilla County Circuit Court, Pendleton Municipal Court, and Lower Kittitas \nCounty District Court in Washington State.  \n128.  When Ms. Ganuelas can afford to, she has made payments to the courts to pay for \nher traffic debt.  Currently, it is impossible for her to pay any amount of money toward her traffic \ndebt.  Without a steady source of income, paying any amount toward traffic debt would make it \neven harder to keep herself and her daughter clothed, fed, and housed. \n129.  Not having a valid driver’s license makes it difficult for Ms. Ganuelas to provide \nfor herself and her daughter.  In order to buy groceries, clothes, necessary household goods, she \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT - 24 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 1    Filed 09/07/18    Page 25 of 37\n   \nmust find a ride into Pendleton, which cost of at least $10 each way by taxi.   \n130.  Ms. Ganuelas’ daughter loves to play soccer and wants to play with the Pendleton \nYouth Soccer Association.  That group has strict rules about parental involvement and being on \ntime for practices and games.  Because Ms. Ganuelas has to rely on friends to get to Pendleton, \nher daughter has not been able to play on a soccer team for the past two years.  \n131.  Ms. Ganuelas has also missed many events at her daughter’s school because her \nlicense is suspended.  In December 2017, she was unable to attend an awards ceremony at her \ndaughter’s school, where he daughter received an award, because she could not drive there. \n132.  Family is very important to Ms. Ganuelas and her extended family lives in \nAlaska, Washington, and other parts of Oregon.  Not being able to drive with a valid license \nmeans she cannot travel to family functions out of state.  Ms. Ganuelas’ grandparents, who are \nmore than eighty years old, live in Yakima, Washington, 150 miles away from my home.  She \nlaments not being able to visit them and to attend important family events at their home because \nher license is suspended.   \n133.  Ms. Ganuelas knows the consequences of driving without a valid license.  To \nreturn home after her grandmother’s 84th birthday in Yakima in July 2015, Ms. Ganuelas took \nthe risk of driving her mother’s car so that she could make it to work on time.  She had no other \ntransportation option.  She was stopped for speeding and for driving on a suspended license.  \n134.  Ms. Ganuelas has been trying to find work, but having a suspended license is a \nhurdle.  For the past three weeks, she have been looking for a job through the Tribal \nEmployment Rights Office.  One of the questions on the sign-in form is “do you have a valid \nlicense?”  Many of the jobs also require a driver’s license.  ODOT was hiring flaggers through \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT - 25 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 1    Filed 09/07/18    Page 26 of 37\n   \nTERO, but she did not qualify because her license is suspended.  It is also difficult for her to \nfollow up on applications or attend interviews without being able to drive.  \n135.  If Ms. Ganuelas had an opportunity now, or at any time since her license has been \nsuspended, to get her suspensions lifted by showing that she cannot afford to pay her traffic debt, \nshe would take it.   \n136.  Every day without a driver’s license makes it hard for Ms. Ganuelas to shop for \ngroceries, provide for her daughter, and find a job. \niv.  Karl Wade Roberts \n137.  Plaintiff Karl Wade Roberts is 57-year-old resident of Baker City, Oregon.  Mr. \nRoberts lives with his wife.  He and his wife each receive $562 per month in social security \nincome.  They do not receive income from any other source.  Their combined monthly income of \n$1,124 places them below the federal poverty line. \n138.  Mr. Roberts has been unable to work since March 2003 due to the combined \neffects of injuries from an automobile accident in 1984 and a traumatic brain injury in 2003.   \n139.  On December 30, 1994, DMV suspended Mr. Roberts’s license after he failed to \npay a traffic ticket.  His driving privileges have not been restored since then.   \n140.  During the last twenty-five years, Mr. Roberts has received at least twenty \nadditional notices of suspension based in full or in part upon his failure to pay tickets for minor \ntraffic violations, such as driving while suspended or illegal display of plates.  The DMV most \nrecently suspended his license on September 4, 2018. \n141.  Mr. Roberts currently owes traffic debt for approximately 11 unpaid traffic \ntickets.  He owes $3,580 in fees and fines to the Baker County Justice Court.  He also owes $465 \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT - 26 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 1    Filed 09/07/18    Page 27 of 37\n   \nto a collection agency on a traffic debt assigned to that agency by the Arlington County Justice \nCourt. \n142.  Before becoming disabled, Mr. Roberts made payments to the Baker County \nJustice Court, hoping to get his license reinstated.  Since then, he has acquired more traffic debt, \nmaking it impossible for him to make the payments with his limited income. \n143.  For Mr. Roberts’s amount of traffic debt, the Baker County Justice Court will not \napprove a payment plan with a monthly payment of less than $50 per month.  He cannot pay $50 \nper month toward those debts. \n144.  Mr. Roberts has been jailed for not paying traffic fines and fees that he could not \nafford to pay. \n145.  The DMV never considered whether Mr. Roberts could afford to pay his traffic \ndebt before suspending his license. \n146.  The DMV has not offered Mr. Roberts any opportunity to reinstate his license \nbased on his inability to pay. \n147.  Mr. Roberts’ wife does not have a driver’s license and requires frequent \ntransportation to medical appointments due to her health. \n148.  Mr. Roberts used to ride his bicycle, even during Baker City’s harsh winters, to \npurchase groceries and other necessities for his family.  As he has aged, it has become difficult \nfor him to carry groceries by bike. \n149.  Mr. Roberts is an enrolled member of the Western Cherokee Nation of Arkansas \nand Missouri.  As part of his Native heritage, he grew up fishing and hunting. Loss of driving \nprivileges severely diminished his ability to enjoy these important cultural and recreational \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT - 27 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 1    Filed 09/07/18    Page 28 of 37\n   \nactivities. \n150.  Mr. Roberts’ adult children live in Boise, Idaho and St. Louis, Missouri.  He \ncannot afford to fly to see them. Without a license, he rarely gets to visit them. \n151.  There is very little public transportation where Mr. Roberts lives.  \n152.  Mr. Roberts continues to drive on a limited basis.  He lives in fear, knowing that \nhe risks accumulating more traffic debt for driving with a suspended license, and additional jail \ntime, if he receives additional traffic tickets that he cannot afford to pay.  However, he needs to \ndrive to provide for his wife’s and his own basic needs. \nv.   Rebecca Heath \n153.  Plaintiff Rebecca Heath is 60-year-old resident of Pendleton, Oregon. \n154.  Ms. Heath receives $750 per month in SSDI and $189 per month in food stamps.  \n155.  Ms. Heath is an enrolled member of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla \nIndian Reservation.  Each quarter, she receives $400 in casino dividends.  In the months she \nreceives a casino dividend check, her SSDI check is reduced by $400. \n156.  Ms. Heath does not receive income from any other source.  Her monthly income \nof $939 places her below the federal poverty line. \n157.  Ms. Heath suffers from a debilitating back injury.  She also fought a years-long \nbattle with a tuberculosis.  Due to these health problems, she was homeless for seven years, from \n2010 to 2017. \n158.  Ms. Heath was found disabled and began receiving SSDI in 2017.  Prior to that, \nshe attempted to make ends meet by collecting cans, selling beadwork, and performing Native \ndance.  She has not been able to maintain regular employment since 1997. \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT - 28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 1    Filed 09/07/18    Page 29 of 37\n   \n159.  Ms. Heath’s driver’s license was originally suspended on September 29, 1995, \nafter she failed to appear on an out-of-state traffic ticket.  Her driving privileges have not been \nrestored since then. \n160.  Over the past 23 years, Ms. Heath has received approximately six additional \nnotices of driver’s license suspension from the DMV as a result of her inability to pay her traffic \ndebt.  At the time of each suspension, she was too poor to afford to pay the traffic debt. \n161.  Because more than 20 years have passed since Ms. Heath’s license was suspended \nfor failure to pay traffic debt, she is eligible for reinstatement.  However, she cannot reinstate her \nlicense because she cannot afford DMV’s testing and reinstatement fees of $149. \n162.  Ms. Heath has been jailed for paying traffic fines and fees that she could not \nafford to pay. \n163.  The DMV never considered whether Ms. Heath could afford to pay her traffic \ndebt before suspending her license. \n164.  The DMV has not offered Ms. Heath any opportunity to reinstate her license \nbased on her inability to pay. \n165.  The DMV does not waive or reduce reinstatement fees based on inability to pay. \n166.  Being unable to drive made it very difficult for Ms. Heath to find and maintain \nregular employment.  At her last regular job, in 1997, she had to walk 5.5 miles each way to get \nto work without driving. \n167.  Due to her inability to drive, Ms. Heath has had to pay expensive cab fares; walk \nlong distances in extreme weather; and take slow public transit systems.  She has missed \nimportant family and cultural events such as funeral services and tribal gatherings.  During the \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT - 29 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 1    Filed 09/07/18    Page 30 of 37\n   \nseven years she was homeless, Ms. Heath’s inability to drive meant that she had to carry all her \npossessions with her in a backpack. \n168.  Plaintiffs Mendoza, Bermudez, Roberts and Heath, through their attorney, sent a \nletter to Administrator McClellan of the DMV on August 14, 2018, requesting that their driver’s \nlicenses be reinstated, that their reinstatement fees be waived, and that the agency stop its \npractice of suspending driver’s licenses for non-payment of traffic debt.  Alternatively, these \nPlaintiffs requested that the DMV provide an opportunity, through a hearing, to lift their \nsuspensions based on their inability to pay their traffic debt.  \n169.  The DMV denied Plaintiffs’ requests in a letter, dated August 21, 2018.  \nV.     CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n170.  This action is brought and may properly be maintained as a class action pursuant \nto Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a)(1)-(4) and 23(b)(2). \n171.  This lawsuit satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy \nrequirements of those provisions. \nA.  Numerosity – Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1) \n172.  The class in this suit is so numerous that joinder of all of its members is \nimpracticable.  During the last ten years, the Oregon DMV suspended Oregonians’ driver’s \nlicenses 334,338 times for failure to pay traffic debt.  In 2017 alone, the DMV issued 32,280 \nlicense suspensions for failure to pay traffic debt.  Many of the individuals whose driver’s \nlicenses were suspended are, like the named plaintiffs, low-income people who are not paying \ntraffic debt solely because they cannot afford to. \nB.  Commonality – Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2) \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT - 30 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 1    Filed 09/07/18    Page 31 of 37\n   \n173.  The relief sought is common to all class members, and common questions of law \nand fact exist as to all class members.  All of the named Plaintiffs have had their driver’s licenses \nsuspended for non-payment of traffic debt.  All of the Plaintiffs were and are unable to pay \nbecause of their poverty. \n174.  The DMV automatically suspends driver’s licenses for failure to pay court fees \nand fines as mandated under Or Rev. Stat. § 809.416 and Or. Rev. Stat. § 809.210(4)(b).  The \nrequirements of the suspension statutes apply equally to class members, and the resolution of \nthese legal and factual issues will determine whether all class members are entitled to the relief \nthey seek. \n175.  The named Plaintiffs seek relief concerning whether the DMV’s policy and \npractice of suspending the driver’s licenses of those who are too poor to pay their traffic debt \nviolates the rights of class members.  Plaintiffs also seek relief mandating that Defendants end \ntheir policy and practice so that the constitutional rights of the class will be protected in the \nfuture. \n176.  The questions of law and fact common to the class predominate over any \nquestions affecting solely individual members of the action, and include: \na.  Whether Defendants’ policy and practice of suspending driver’s licenses for non-\npayment of traffic debt without considering the license-holder’s ability to pay \ndeprives Plaintiffs and class members of substantive due process and equal \nprotection, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution; \nb.  Whether Defendants’ wealth-based suspension scheme violates procedural due \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT - 31 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 1    Filed 09/07/18    Page 32 of 37\n   \nprocess because it does not provide an ability-to-pay hearing; \nc.  Whether Defendants’ wealth-based suspension scheme violates equal protection \nand substantive due process because indigent traffic debtors are treated differently \nthan traffic debtors who can afford to pay their traffic violation fines to avoid \ndriver’s license suspensions;  \nd.  Whether Defendants violate the Equal Protection Clause by treating indigent \ntraffic debtors differently from other similarly situated indigent debtors; \ne.  Whether Plaintiffs and members of the class are entitled to declaratory relief; and  \nf.  Whether Plaintiffs and class members are entitled to injunctive relief. \nC.  Typicality – Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3) \n177.  Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the class.  Plaintiffs, like all other members of the \nclass, are Oregon residents who had their driver’s licenses suspended for their inability to pay \ntheir traffic debt to Oregon courts.  They are all affected by the Defendants’ suspension of their \ndriver’s licenses and continue to risk further traffic violations – and traffic debt – by driving with \nsuspended driver’s licenses. \n178.  If the named Plaintiffs succeed in their claim that the Defendant’s policy and \npractice of suspending driver’s licenses of residents who are too poor to pay traffic debt violates \ntheir constitutional rights, that ruling would benefit every class member. \nD.  Adequacy – Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4) \n179.  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.  There are no \nknown conflicts among class members, all of whom have a similar interest in asserting their \nconstitutional rights. \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT - 32 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 1    Filed 09/07/18    Page 33 of 37\n   \n… \nE.  Rule 23(b) \n180.  This case is appropriate for class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) \nbecause Defendants’ policy and practice of suspending driver’s licenses for non-payment of \ntraffic debt warrants declaratory and injunctive relief that is appropriate to the class as a whole.  \nA declaration and injunction stating that the DMV cannot suspend driver’s licenses when \nsomeone is too poor to pay their traffic debt would provide relief to every member of the class. \n181.  Concentrating this litigation in one forum, as opposed to separate individual cases \nin various courts, will promote judicial economy, consistency and parity among the claims of \nindividual class members.  Allowing this lawsuit to proceed as a class action will permit the class \nof similarly situated persons to prosecute their common claims in a single forum simultaneously \nand efficiently. \n182.  Plaintiffs are not aware of any difficulty that could be encountered in the \nmanagement of this action that would preclude its maintenance as a class action. \n \nVI.      FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (Due Process/Equal Protection Bearden \nand Griffin Violation)  \n183.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations above as if fully set forth \nherein. \n184.  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that “[n]o State \nshall … deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.” U.S. Const. \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT - 33 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 1    Filed 09/07/18    Page 34 of 37\n   \namend. XIV, §1. \n185.  The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that “[n]o \nState shall … deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” \n186.  Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12 (1956), and its progeny, establishes the principle \nthat people should not be penalized just for being poor.  Under Griffin, states must provide an \nevaluation of ability to pay to assess an individual’s indigence prior to any taking any measures \nthat could result in any additional punishment beyond that imposed upon financially solvent \nindividuals. \n187.  The Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses prohibit \npunishing individuals for non-payment without first determining that they had the ability to pay \nand willfully refused to make a monetary payment.  See Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660 \n(1983).   \n188.  Under Griffin and Bearden, DMV’s automatic suspension of driver’s licenses for \nnonpayment of traffic debt without any inquiry into or consideration of the license holder’s \nability to pay violates the right to substantive due process and equal protection. \nVII.   SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (Equal Protection Under Strange)   \n189.  Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations above as if fully set forth herein. \n190.  Defendants’ policy and practice of suspending driver’s licenses as a means of debt \ncollection for state courts from people who are too poor to pay their traffic debts, but not \nsuspending the driver’s licenses of other indigent judgment debtors, violates the right to equal \nprotection under the law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT - 34 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 1    Filed 09/07/18    Page 35 of 37\n   \nConstitution. \n191.  Under James v. Strange, 407 U.S. 128 (1972), the Defendants’ policy and practice \nof suspending driver’s licenses under ORS § 809.416 violates the equal protection clause \nbecause it empowers the DMV to treat indigent traffic debtors worse than traffic debtors who \ncommitted bicycle, pedestrian, or parking offenses, private debtors with delinquent credit card \ndebt, and child support debtors.  In Oregon, only indigent traffic debtors are punished with \ndriver’s license suspensions without any inquiry into or consideration of their ability to pay their \ntraffic debt. \nVIII.   THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (Procedural Due Process – Failure to \nProvide Pre- and Post-Deprivation Hearings)  \n192.  Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations above as if fully set forth herein. \n193.  Plaintiffs have protected property and liberty interests in their driver’s licenses \nand their ability to drive legally.  Defendants violate Plaintiffs’ procedural due process rights by \nsuspending their licenses without affording them a pre-suspension hearing to determine whether \nthey are able to pay their traffic debt.  Defendants also violate Plaintiffs’ procedural due process \nrights by not affording them a post-suspension hearing to determine if they are unable to pay \ntheir traffic debt. \n194.  Plaintiffs are entitled to prospective relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, because they \nhave demonstrated that Defendants, acting under color of state law, caused them to suffer a \nviolation of a right secured by the Constitution. See West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988).   \n \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT - 35 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 1    Filed 09/07/18    Page 36 of 37\n   \nIX.     DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL \n195.  Plaintiffs hereby demand a trial by jury. \n     \nX.     PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all members of the proposed class, \npray for: \n(a)  An order designating this action as a class action;  \n(b)  A declaration that Defendants’ practices with respect to suspensions of driver’s \nlicenses as alleged herein have violated and continue to violate the Due Process and Equal \nProtection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution as to the class;   \n(c)  An order and judgment preliminarily and permanently ordering Defendants, their \nsubordinates, agents, employees, representatives, and all others acting or purporting to act on their \nbehalf, from suspending driver’s licenses for unpaid traffic debt against Plaintiffs and class \nmembers until such time as the DMV and the State of Oregon implement a system that complies \nwith the United States Constitution; \n(d) An order and judgment preliminarily and permanently ordering Defendants to remove \nPlaintiffs’ and class members’ suspensions for non-payment of traffic debt that were effected prior \nto the date of judgment in this matter and enjoining the Defendants from requiring the Plaintiffs \nand class members to pay reinstatement fees as a condition of reinstatement;  \n(e) An award of reasonable attorney fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988, and costs and \ndisbursements incurred herein; \n(f) Prejudgment interest; and \n(g) Such other and further legal and equitable relief as this Court deems just and proper. \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT - 36 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 1    Filed 09/07/18    Page 37 of 37\n   \n \nDATED this 7th day of September, 2018.   \n   \n   \n \n \nOREGON LAW CENTER \n \n \n/s/ Marisa Samuelson      \nEmily Teplin Fox, OSB No. 121720 \nefox@oregonlawcenter.org \nMarisa Samuelson, OSB No. 144234 \nmsamuelson@oregonlawcenter.org \nBeth Englander, OSB No. 980190 \nbenglander@oregonlawcenter.org \nKelsey Heilman, OSB No. 140348 \nkheilman@oregonlawcenter.org  \n522 SW Fifth Ave., Suite 812 \nPortland, OR 97204 \n(503) 473-8310 \n \nJonathan M.

INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  During the past ten years, the Oregon DMV suspended Oregonians’ driver’s \nlicenses 334,338 times for failure to pay fines, costs, and fees arising from minor traffic citations \n(“traffic debt”).  Of the approximately 3.1 million Oregonians who hold driver’s licenses,1 as \nmany as 10 percent have had their licenses suspended for failure to pay traffic debt.  \n2.  Approximately 536,146 Oregonians live below the federal poverty line, about \n                                                 \n1 In 2016, there were 3,100,321 “drivers of issuance” in Oregon. This includes all license \nholders with active, expired, and non-active driving privileges. See 2016 Oregon DMV Driver \nStatistics Report (Run date: 1/18/17). \n \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT – 2 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 38    Filed 10/16/18    Page 3 of 40\n   \n13% of the state’s population.  “Oregon 2017,” Talk Poverty, https://talkpoverty.org/state-year-\nreport/oregon-2017-report/ (last visited August 23, 2018).  Oregonians living in poverty struggle \nto pay for basic necessities like food and shelter and cannot afford to pay traffic debt.  \n3.  The DMV suspends driver’s licenses for failure to pay traffic debt without \nconsidering an individual’s ability to pay her traffic debt and exempting from suspension those \nlow-income individuals who cannot pay.   \n4.  License suspension may be an appropriate way to secure payment from \nindividuals who can afford to pay traffic debt but willfully refuse to do so.  For low-income \nindividuals, this statutory regime punishes them for being poor.  \n5.  For the vast majority of Oregonians, driving is the only reliable means of \ntransportation to find and maintain employment, to get to medical appointments, to take their \nchildren to school, and to shop for necessities, including food.   \n6.  Without paying down their traffic debt, low-income Oregonians cannot regain \ntheir licenses for 20 years.  \n7.  License suspensions lead to further financial and legal burdens, including charges \nfor driving with a suspended license, and additional fees and fines.  A minor traffic infraction – \nsuch as failing to buckle a seatbelt or driving with a defective taillight – can plunge low-income \npeople into a legal and financial rut from which any reasonable person would struggle to escape. \n8.  Plaintiffs and class members in this case are among tens of thousands of \nOregonians who have lost their driver’s licenses, and cannot get them back, simply because of \ntheir poverty.   \n9.  Punishing people for being unable to pay traffic debt violates the Due Process and \n \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT – 3 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 38    Filed 10/16/18    Page 4 of 40\n   \nEqual Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution.   \n10.  Plaintiffs and class members, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly \nsituated, seek declaratory and injunctive relief against Matthew Garrett, in his official capacity as \nDirector of the ODOT; Tammy Baney, in her official capacity as Chair of the OTC; Sean \nO’Hollaren, in his official capacity as Member of the OTC; Bob Van Brocklin, in his official \ncapacity as Member of the OTC; Martin Callery, in his official capacity as Member of the OTC; \nand Tom McClellan, in his official capacity as Administrator of the DMV, to end this \nunconstitutional statutory scheme.   \n11.  The DMV should refrain from suspending the driver’s licenses of low-income \nindividuals who cannot afford to pay their traffic debt.  Alternatively, the DMV should \nimplement an ability-to-pay determination process that comports with due process and equal \nprotection prior to suspending driver licenses for failure to pay traffic debt, and provide \nsubsequent opportunities to lift suspensions because of indigence.  \nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n12.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C §§ 1331 and \n1343, in that Plaintiffs’ claims arise under the Fourteenth Amendment and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n13.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  The DMV is Unconstitutionally Punishing Low-Income Traffic Debtors Solely \nBecause of their Poverty. \n \ni.  A Driver’s License is Necessary to Maintain Employment and to \nAccess Essential Services.  \n \n23.  In Oregon, the majority of workers commute by car.  Approximately 82% of \nOregonians over the age of 16 travel to work by car, either alone or in a carpool.2  Statewide, \nonly 4.3% of residents commute by public transportation, while 6.4% get to work by bicycle or \non foot.3 \n24.  For most Oregonians, public transit is not a viable commuting alternative.  In 32 \nof Oregon’s 34 counties, at least 40% of residents do not live within a .25-mile radius of a stop \noperated by any transit agency.  In 28 of Oregon’s 34 counties, the percentage is more than 50%.  \nAccess is worse in rural areas.  More than 64% of Umatilla County residents and more than 75% \nof Baker City residents lack access to public transit. \n25.  Not having a valid driver’s license is a direct barrier to employment because \nmany lower paying jobs require a driver’s license.  Alana Semuels, “No Driver’s License, No \nJob,” The Atlantic (June 15, 2016), https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/06/no-\ndrivers-license-no-job/486653/.  A study of New Jersey drivers found that 42% of drivers lost \ntheir jobs after their driver’s licenses were suspended. Jon A. Carnegie, Ian M. Voohees \nTransportation Center, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Driver’s License \n                                                 \n2 U.S. Dep’t of Transp., Bur. Of Transp.

Driver’s license suspensions also deprive low-income individuals of employment \nopportunities because private employers often screen out applicants who do not have driver’s \nlicenses.4 People who are able to travel farther distances also have access to a greater number of \njob opportunities in different locations.5     \n27.  In urban areas, like Portland, where gentrification and a housing crisis have \ndisplaced low-income people and people of color, the ability to travel to work longer distances is \ncrucial.6 \n28.  In rural areas of Oregon, most employment is accessible only by car due to the \ndistances between home and work. \n29.  A Pew Research Center Study found that 86% of Americans consider a car to be a \n“necessity of life,” higher than the percentage of people who identified cell phones as a necessity \nat 47% or microwaves at 45%.7 \n30.  The loss of a driver’s license affects the driver’s basic self-sufficiency.  In \naddition to requiring a car to travel to work, most Oregonians must drive to obtain medical care, \nto travel to the grocery store to buy food and clothing, and to ensure the care and education of \ntheir children. \n                                                 \n4 Stephen Bingham et al., Stopped, Fined, Arrested: Racial Bias in Policing and Traffic \nCourts in California, 26-28 (2016).  \n5 Id., referring generally to Adie Tomer et al., Brookings Institute, Missed Opportunity: \nTransit and Jobs in Metropolitan America (2011). \n6 Id. \n7 Paul Taylor and Wendy Wang et al., The Fading Glory of The Television and \nTelephone, Pew Research Center 1 (Aug. 10, 2010), http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/3/2011/01/Final-TV-and-Telephone.pdf \n \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT – 7 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 38    Filed 10/16/18    Page 8 of 40\n   \n31.  Even in urban areas, where public transportation is more widely available, taking \nbuses or trains is not a viable option for many people.  Delays create the risk of a late arrival to \nwork or a tardy pick up of a child from a childcare facility.  Multiple transfers require departure \nearly in the morning and return late in the evening, hours when childcare is either very expensive \nor unavailable.  A low-income person cannot afford to simply pay for a taxi or summon an Uber \nor Lyft to get them where they need to go. \nii.  Oregon’s License Suspension Regime for Traffic Debtors. \n \n32.  In Oregon, a minor traffic violation8 results in the imposition of a fine, based on \nthe violation’s statutory classification. See ORS §§ 153.012, 153.018-153.021.   \n33.  Oregon circuit courts abide by a uniform fine schedule. ORS § 153.800.9  In \ngeneral, courts may not “defer, waive, suspend or otherwise reduce the fine” below the statutory \nminimum. ORS § 153.021. \n34.  When a driver is charged with a traffic violation, the officer issues him or her a \ncitation with the corresponding “presumptive fine.” ORS §§ 153.019, 153.020.  For example, \nfailing to signal a turn is a Class D violation. ORS § 811.335(1)(b).  The presumptive fine is \n$115.  ORS § 153.019(1)(d).  Driving 11 to 20 miles per hour in excess of the speed limit, is a \nClass C traffic violation. ORS § 811.109(1)(b). The presumptive fine for this violation is $165. \nORS § 153.019(1)(c).   \n                                                 \n8 “Traffic offense” is the umbrella term for actions that violate Oregon traffic laws and \nordinances. ORS § 801.555. An offense is a “traffic violation” if the sentence does not include \njail time. ORS § 153.008.   \n9 See Office of the State Court Administrator, 2018 “Schedule of Fines” on Violations \n(SOF-18), available at \nhttps://digital.osl.state.or.us/islandora/object/osl%3A104207/datastream/OBJ/view. \n \n \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT – 8 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 38    Filed 10/16/18    Page 9 of 40\n   \n35.  People who can afford to pay traffic violation fines simply pay them. However, \nmany Oregonians cannot afford a $100 to $200 fine. \n36.  According to a recent Federal Reserve survey, approximately 40% of Americans \nreported that they did not have enough money to cover a $400 emergency expense.10  More than \n13% of Oregonians live below the federal poverty line.11  The rate of food insecurity is even \nhigher, affecting 552,900 Oregonians.12 \n37.  In Oregon, traffic debt is collected by courts, private collections agencies, the \nOregon Department of Revenue.  The DMV also collects reinstatement and issuance fees, a \nportion of the traffic debt. \n38.  Circuit courts generally provide a 35-day window for collection of traffic fines \nand fees; after that time, a “failure to comply” license sanction is entered and the account \nbecomes delinquent.  See ORS § 809.210 (2017).  See also Oregon Judicial Department Financial \nCase Processing Manual – Collections (updated Dec. 2017), at p. 5. \n39.  In Multnomah County, the court imposes the following fees if a debtor fails to \nsatisfy a monetary judgment within 30 days: $50 for amounts up to $149.99; $125 for amounts \nfrom $150 to $399.99; or $200 for amounts greater than $400.14 \n40.  If an individual does not pay her debt in full within the required time, the court \n                                                 \n10 Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2017, May 2018, at 21, \navailable at https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2017-report-economic-well-being-\nus-households-201805.pdf. \n11 U.S. Census Bureau, Quick Facts: Oregon, available at \nhttps://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/or/INC110216. \n12 Oregon Food Bank, Hunger in Oregon, available at \nhttps://www.oregonfoodbank.org/our-work/hunger-in-oregon/. \n14 Schedule available at \nhttps://www.courts.oregon.gov/courts/multnomah/payments/Pages/faq.aspx  \n \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT – 9 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 38    Filed 10/16/18    Page 10 of 40\n   \nmay send the account to a private collections agency or the Oregon Department of Revenue, \nresulting in even more costs and fees. See ORS §§ 1.102(2), 293.231, 697.105. Clackamas \nCounty Circuit Court, for example, adds a 28% fee to delinquent account balances when it refers \ndebts to the Department of Revenue or a private collection agency. \n41.  When a traffic debtor “fails or refuses to pay” traffic debt, the court may do one \nof the following: (1) issue a notice of suspension to the Department of Transportation that directs \nthe department to implement procedures under ORS § 809.416 or (2) order a defendant’s driving \nprivileges restricted.  ORS § 809.210(1)(a) & (b).   \n42.  The statute does not require courts to make a pre-suspension ability-to-pay \ndetermination. \n43.  When the deadline passes without payment from the licensee, court clerks notify \nthe DMV of the nonpayment of the debt. \n44.  The clerks automatically send notices of the delinquencies to the DMV without \nany individualized inquiry into the reason for nonpayment, including the licensee’s ability to pay \nthe debt.  Judges are not involved in the process. \n45.  Courts impose a $15 fee each time they send notification to the DMV for failure \nto comply with payment of court fees, fines, and costs. ORS § 809.267. \n46.  Pursuant to ORS § 809.416(2)-(3), the DMV suspends a traffic debtor’s driver’s \nlicense upon receipt of a notice of suspension and issuance of a 60-day warning to the traffic \ndebtor.   \n47.  To avoid or end the suspension, the traffic debtor must present the DMV with a \nnotice of reinstatement issued by the court showing that she “(A) [i]s making payments, has paid \n \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT – 10 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 38    Filed 10/16/18    Page 11 of 40\n   \nthe fine[,] or has obeyed the order of the court; or (B) [h]as enrolled in a preapprenticeship \nprogram…or is a registered apprentice.” ORS § 809.416(2).   \n48.  Unless a licensee pays her traffic debt, she generally must wait 20 years “from the \ndate the traffic offense occurred” before the suspension on her driver’s license is lifted.  Id. ORS \n§ 809.415(4)(a)(B).   \n49.  While a traffic debtor can request administrative review of her suspension, \ninability to pay is not a defense.  ORS §§ 809.415(4)(b), 809.440. \n50.  Oregon’s circuit courts allow, but do not oblige, courts to offer payment plans for \ntraffic debt.  These plans come with additional fees, and minimum monthly payment amounts are \ncalculated based on the amount owed, without consideration of the debtor’s financial \ncircumstances.  These courts may add a fee that is at least $50 and as much as $200 “to any \njudgment that includes a monetary obligation that the court or judicial branch is charged with \ncollecting.” ORS § 1.202(1).  See also Chief Justice Order No. 11-027 (June 20, 2011).  \nMunicipal courts may, or may not, offer any payment plan at all. \n51.  If an individual enters into a payment plan, the suspension may be re-imposed “if \nthe person ceases making payments before the fine is paid in full.” ORS § 809.210(4)(a). \n52.  License holders are not permitted to be heard by the DMV on the question of \nwhether they are able to afford their payment plan or whether their poverty caused them to miss \npayments. \n53.  Once a driver has had her license suspended, she risks being cited for driving with \na suspended license.  This is an additional, new traffic violation, ORS § 811.175, with a \npresumptive fine of $440, ORS § 153.019(1)(a), subject to the same debt collection and license \n \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT – 11 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 38    Filed 10/16/18    Page 12 of 40\n   \nsuspension procedures. \n54.  Low-income debtors who manage to pay down their traffic debt within the 20-\nyear suspension period face one final economic barrier: a $75 reinstatement fee, and issuance \nfees between $26.50 and $68, depending on whether the debtor’s driver’s license has expired \nwith the passage of time. ORS § 807.370(5), (25), (33). \n55.  Fee waivers for reinstatements and issuance fees are available, but not on the \nbasis that the requester is unable to pay. ORS §§ 809.380(6)(a)-(L), 809.380(7). \n56.  In 2017 alone, 2,433 Oregonians were eligible for license reinstatement after \ntraffic debt-related suspension, but they did not pay reinstatement and issuance fees. \n57.  Low-income Oregonians struggle to supply food for their families, pay utilities, \nand pay rent.  Even when they scrape together the funds to discharge traffic debt, paying an \nadditional $150 or more for the reinstatement and issuance of their driver’s license is a final, \nsignificant obstacle. \niii.  Consequences of Oregon’s License Suspension Law. \n \n \n58.  Between 2012 and 2017, the DMV issued an average of 33,482 license \nsuspensions each year because of a driver’s failure to pay court debts arising out of traffic \nviolations.   \n59.  Oregon’s driver’s license suspension statute, ORS § 809.416, puts low-income \npeople in an impossible position.  They either stop driving, making it impossible to meet their \nwork and family obligations, or drive illegally, placing themselves at risk of being cited for \ndriving with a suspended license and further compounding their traffic debt. \n60.  Tens of thousands of Oregon residents take the risk of driving with a suspended \n \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT – 12 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 38    Filed 10/16/18    Page 13 of 40\n   \nlicense each year.  In 2010, DMV reported 40,837 drivers were convicted for driving on a \nsuspended license. See Joseph Rose, “After 7 Suspensions, Why Hasn’t Oregon Revoked \nJefferson Smith’s License?,” The Oregonian/Oregon Live (August 22, 2012); See also Nick \nMorgan, “Many Oregon Drivers Undeterred by Suspended Licenses,” The Associated Press \n(January 4, 2018); Eric Hidle, “Driving While Suspended in Oregon: Thousands do it, but law \nofficers say little can be done to solve the problem,” The Bulletin (April 25, 2011). \n61.  With each violation for driving on a suspended license – a new traffic violation – \nlow-income residents amass even more traffic debt.  The fine for driving on a suspended license, \na class A traffic violation, is presumptively $440, with a minimum fine of $225 and a maximum \nfine of $2,000. ORS § 153.019. \n62.  Low-income people who rely on their vehicles, but cannot afford to pay their \ntraffic debts, risk these additional fines and punishments every time they drive. \nB.  The DMV’s License Suspension Scheme, Which Provides No Indigency \nException for Traffic Debtors, Is Unconstitutional.   \n  \ni.  Discriminatory Debt Collection.  \n63.  Drivers of all income levels are cited for minor traffic violations, but in Oregon, \nthe consequences of these citations are far worse for drivers who are poor. \n64.  Moderate and high-income drivers can easily avoid license suspension by simply \npaying their fines.  Wealthier drivers can get numerous traffic violations, pay the fines, and keep \ndriving.  \n65.  For low-income drivers, paying a $115 to $440 fine for a traffic violation is an \ninsurmountable obstacle.  Unlike higher-income drivers who can afford to pay these fines, an \nindigent driver has no way to avoid suspension.   \n \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT – 13 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 38    Filed 10/16/18    Page 14 of 40\n   \n66.  Under Oregon’s wealth-based license suspension regime, indigent drivers can be \ncited for one minor traffic violation and find themselves plunged deeper into debt as they risk \nfurther fines for driving while suspended. \n67.  Oregonians who owe traffic debt to county, municipal, or justice courts also are \nsingled out for harsh and discriminatory treatment compared to other types of indigent debtors. \n68.  ORS § 809.416 differentiates between traffic debtors who committed bicycle, \npedestrian, or parking offenses and other traffic debtors. See also ORS § 809.210(7) (prohibiting \ncourts from sending a notice of suspension to those who have failed to pay fines for bicycle, \npedestrian or parking offenses). \n69.  A low-income person who is cited for failing to signal or stop on a bicycle, ORS § \n814.440, but who cannot afford to pay the fine, will not have her license suspended.  By contrast, \nan indigent person who owes a fine for driving with a broken taillight and cannot pay her court \ndebt is punished with a license suspension and related negative consequences. \n70.  Similarly, private judgment debtors in civil actions in Oregon, such as individuals \nindebted to credit card companies, are not subject to a suspension of their driver’s licenses if they \nare too poor to pay their debt. \n71.  While both debtors may find themselves subject to collection actions by private \ncollection firms, a private debt holder does not risk losing his driver’s license if he cannot afford \nto make payments or pay the balance in full.  By contrast, traffic debtors receive an automatic \npunishment of suspension simply because they owe a debt to the state.   \n72.  Indigent child support debtors also receive more procedural protections than do \ntraffic debtors.  \n \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT – 14 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 38    Filed 10/16/18    Page 15 of 40\n   \n73.  Oregon suspends driver’s licenses for failure to pay child support.  ORS § \n25.750(1)(a).  However, child support debtors have the ability to avoid suspension of their \ndriver’s licenses at the following three stages: (1) at the establishment of a support obligation, \nORS § 25.275(1)(a)-(d); (2) at any modification proceeding, ORS § 25.280, 25.287(5), OAR \n137-055-3430(3)(c)(B) (“substantial change” warranting modification includes financial \nchanges); and (3) once the child support debtor’s payments are in arrears, ORS § 25.750(1)(a). \n74.  Unlike traffic debtors, child support debtors also are accorded a six-month, \nindefinitely renewable “hardship exception” to reduce or eliminate the parent’s obligations upon \ndemonstration of that parent’s inability to pay.  OAR 137-055-4420(10). \n75.  Accordingly, in Oregon, a parent who owes child support can avoid suspension of \nhis driver’s license by demonstrating he cannot afford his child support obligation.  By contrast, \na single parent who receives no child support, and is responsible for her children, will lose her \ndriver’s license simply because she is too poor to pay a fine for a broken tail light violation. \nC.  The DMV’s License Suspension Scheme Deprives Traffic Debtors of Procedural \nDue Process. \n \ni.  Indigent Traffic Debtors Are Not Afforded an Ability-to-Pay Hearing. \n \n76.  For low-income traffic debtors in Oregon, having a driver’s license to operate a \ncar is much more than a mode of transportation.  It is an essential tool to maintain self-\nsufficiency, to find or keep a job, and to care for one’s children. \n77.  Unlike child support debtors who have several opportunities to establish their \nindigence to avoid license suspensions, traffic debtors have no right to have their indigence \ndetermined, by any entity, at any point prior to or during their suspension.  The DMV does not \nevaluate ability-to-pay nor ensure that any entity has made such a determination prior to or \n \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT – 15 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 38    Filed 10/16/18    Page 16 of 40\n   \nduring the period of suspension.  \n78.  Although the Oregon Judicial Department allows circuit courts to offer payment \nplans, minimum payment amounts are tied to the total debt amount rather than to the amount the \ndebtor can afford to pay each month.  In addition, these plans involve additional fees.  Some \nmunicipal courts may not offer any payment plan. \n79.  Delinquent payment plans generally result in courts automatically generating a \nnotice of suspension. \n80.  Once the DMV issues a driver’s license suspension notice, debtors can only avoid \nsuspension by obtaining a notice of reinstatement from the court indicating full payment or \npayment plan compliance, or engagement in certain apprenticeship programs.  ORS § \n809.416(2)(a)-(b).  Debtors have no opportunity to avoid or challenge the suspension based on \ninability to pay. \n81.  Administrative review of the DMV’s suspension does not stay the suspension and \nis limited to an evaluation of criteria unrelated to the debtor’s ability to pay or indigency.  ORS § \n809.415((4)(b) and ORS § 809.440(2);  \n82.  At no point during the process of suspending driver’s licenses does the DMV \nprovide a procedure for low-income traffic debtors to demonstrate that they are unable to pay \ntheir traffic debt. \n83.  For indigent traffic debtors who cannot afford to pay their traffic debt or make the \nminimum payments under a payment plan, Oregon’s lack of pre-suspension procedural \nsafeguards results in hundreds of thousands of low-income individuals systematically being \npunished for being poor.   \n \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT – 16 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 38    Filed 10/16/18    Page 17 of 40\n   \nD.  The Named Plaintiffs. \ni.  Cindy Mendoza \n84.  Cindy Mendoza is 28-year-old resident of Portland, Oregon.  Ms. Mendoza is \nraising three sons on her own: a 2-year-old toddler, a 7-year old, and a 9-year old.   \n85.  Ms. Mendoza lives in a two-bedroom subsidized apartment.  Until recently, Ms. \nMendoza and her children lived in a motel room; they were forced to move to the motel after \ntheir previous residence, a homeless shelter, became uninhabitable after the roof caved in from a \nheavy leak.  \n86.  Ms. Mendoza is currently unemployed.  She is looking for work, but has had \ndifficulty finding a job without a valid driver’s license.  She receives approximately $1,100 \nmonthly in assistance, including food stamps.  She has no other source of income, placing her \nfamily well below the federal poverty line.  \n87.  Near the end of every month, Ms. Mendoza’s family struggles without enough \nfood.  She has to try to find free food boxes at pantries so that her family has something to eat.   \n88.  The first time Ms. Mendoza’s driver’s license was suspended was on June 8, \n2010, after getting a traffic violation in Wasco County for speeding.  The ticket was for $400.  \nMs. Mendoza was unemployed at the time and had a new baby.  She could not afford to pay the \ntraffic fine.  The amount increased to $812 with court costs and fees and the debt was referred to \na collections agency.  \n89.  It took Ms. Mendoza five years, but after obtaining steady employment, she was \nfinally able to pay off her debt to Wasco County Circuit Court and her license was reinstated in \nApril 2015. \n \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT – 17 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 38    Filed 10/16/18    Page 18 of 40\n   \n90.  However, prior to paying off that debt, Ms. Mendoza was cited a few more times \nfor driving on a suspended license.  These additional traffic citations put her in a downward \nspiral, making it impossible for her to ever get caught up. \n91.  Ms. Mendoza’s driver’s license is currently suspended because she owes \n$1,660.37 to Milwaukie Municipal Court for various traffic violations, including a January 8, \n2016, citation for driving on a suspended license.  DMV suspended her license on April 8, 2016 \ndue to her inability to pay her court debt for these traffic violations.   \n92.  Ms. Mendoza also owes $2,020.40 to Beaverton Municipal Court for non-\npayment of court fines and fees for another driving on a suspended license traffic violation that \noccurred on August 24, 2013.  The DMV suspended her license for non-payment of her court \ndebt on July 29, 2015.13 \n93.  Additionally, Ms. Mendoza owes $7,602 in unpaid court fines and fees to \nClackamas County Circuit Court for failing to appear at her arraignment for a misdemeanor \ntraffic case involving a car accident with property damage only.  Ms. Mendoza is on a payment \nplan for this case, but she cannot afford to pay $100 per month to the court when she is \nunemployed and is the sole provider for her three children.  Because Ms. Mendoza has missed \nher payments, in June 2018 Clackamas Circuit Court referred her debt to collections.  She \nanticipates that the court will also send a notice to the DMV to suspend her driver’s license. \n94.  The DMV never considered whether Ms. Mendoza could afford to pay her traffic \ndebt before suspending her license. \n                                                 \n13 The DMV also suspended Ms. Mendoza’s license on October 11, 2013 due to her \nfailure to appear for a hearing in that same case, but that suspension is no longer active. \n \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT – 18 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 38    Filed 10/16/18    Page 19 of 40\n   \n95.  The DMV has not offered Ms. Mendoza any opportunity to reinstate her license \nbased on her inability to pay. \n96.  In total, Ms. Mendoza owes $11,282.77 to three courts. If she could afford to, Ms. \nMendoza would pay these debts, or make periodic payments to reduce the amounts of debt she \nowes. \n97.  Due to her poverty, it impossible for Ms. Mendoza to pay this sum to get her \ndriver’s license reinstated.  In fact, she is too poor to pay anything at all.  Therefore, she cannot \nbenefit from a payment plan, even though one has been offered to her. \n98.  Meanwhile, Ms. Mendoza continues to drive, risking further traffic violations for \ndriving on a suspended license.  She is looking for employment, but is limited in the types of \njobs that she can apply for because she does not have a driver’s license.  Recently she inquired \nabout a position as a street “flagger” for construction jobs, but she was turned away because the \njob required a valid driver’s license.  Ms. Mendoza has also had a difficult time finding work that \nis close to her apartment so that she can avoid using her car for transportation. \n99.  Nevertheless, Ms. Mendoza continues to drive so that she can get her children to \nmedical appointments and to buy clothes and food for her family.   \n100.  Ms. Mendoza knows she is taking a risk driving on a suspended driver’s license, \nbut she feels as though she has no other choice because she is too poor to pay enormous sums of \ntraffic debt and relies on her vehicle to provide necessities for herself and her family. \nii.  Gloria Bermudez \n101.  Gloria Bermudez is a 36-year-old resident of Portland, Oregon.  She is a single \nmother with four children, ages 11, 8, 7 and 6.  She is the sole wage earner for her family.  Ms. \n \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT – 19 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 38    Filed 10/16/18    Page 20 of 40\n   \nBermudez works as a cook at a restaurant in a shopping mall. She earns $14 per hour or \napproximately $1,600 per month.  She also receives approximately $420 per month in food \nstamps to help feed her family.   \n102.  Ms. Bermudez struggles to keep up with her electric, gas, and phone bills every \nmonth.  Frequently, by the end of the month, she seeks free food at pantries to put food on the \ntable. \n103.  Ms. Bermudez’s driver’s license is currently suspended because she is unable to \npay a total of $2,812.38 in traffic debt to two courts, Multnomah County Circuit Court and \nWashington County Justice Court. \n104.  Ms. Bermudez owes $1,902.38 to Multnomah County Circuit Court related to \nthree different traffic violation cases.   \n105.  In one of the cases, she was cited on February 22, 2003 for failing to obey a \ntraffic control device.  The ticket – originally for $175 – grew to $299.16 with additional court \nfees and costs.  Initially, her license was suspended, in May 2003, because she failed to appear at \nher arraignment.  Her debt was sent to collections.  The court later set her up on a payment plan \nand her license was reinstated on May 12, 2010.  However, she couldn’t afford to keep up with \nthese $50 payments, so the DMV suspended her license again – this time based on her failure to \npay her traffic debt – on September 14, 2012.  \n106.  In another case, she was cited on July 1, 2013 for failing to use proper child seats \nfor her two children.  This was originally a $120 ticket, but grew to $237 with added fees.  The \nDMV suspended her license due to her inability to pay that amount on October 7, 2013.    \n107.  At the time that Ms. Bermudez was cited for improper use of child seats, she was \n \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT – 20 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 38    Filed 10/16/18    Page 21 of 40\n   \nalso cited for driving on a suspended license, driving with expired tags, and driving while \nuninsured.  In this related case, Ms. Bermudez owes $1,306 in unpaid court fines and fees to \nMultnomah County Circuit Court for failing to appear at her arraignment.  The DMV suspended \nher driver’s license in that case on January 21, 2014.   \n108.  Ms. Bermudez estimates that, during the past ten years, she has paid hundreds of \ndollars in payments to Multnomah County Circuit Court, but she always fell behind on these \npayments because she did not have enough money to keep up.  \n109.  Ms. Bermudez also owes Washington County Justice Court a total of $910 for \ntraffic debt.   \n110.  In one of the cases, she was cited on July 2, 2012 for driving while operating a \ncell phone, driving without proof of insurance, and for driving with a suspended license.  Due to \nher inability to pay $470 in fines and fees for that case, the DMV suspended her driver’s license \non October 7, 2013.   \n111.  In her 2012 case, Ms. Bermudez was offered a payment plan of $75 per month to \npay her traffic debt.  However, she was not able to make her initial payment on August 24, 2012 \nbecause she had recently given birth to a premature baby and had no money to spare.  She hand-\ndelivered a letter to the court explaining these circumstances.  The court did not offer to \neliminate or further reduce her payments under the plan.  \n112.  More recently, on February 24, 2018, Ms. Bermudez was stopped by the police \nwhile driving home late after work.  She was cited for driving on a suspended license.  Ms. \nBermudez owes another $440 for this traffic violation.  She received a letter, on April 6, 2018, \nfrom Washington County Justice Court informing her that if she is unable to pay this amount or \n \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT – 21 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 38    Filed 10/16/18    Page 22 of 40\n   \nbegin making payments by April 20, 2018, the court would send a notice of suspension to the \nDMV.  Ms. Bermudez cannot afford to pay this debt either.  She fears receiving another notice \nby mail from the DMV informing her that her driver’s license will be suspended for failing to \npay this additional traffic debt. \n113.  The DMV never considered whether Ms. Bermudez could afford to pay her traffic \ndebt before suspending her license. \n114.  DMV has not offered Ms. Bermudez any opportunity to reinstate her license \nbased on her inability to pay. \n115.  If Ms. Bermudez could afford to pay down her court debts, she would.  However, \nher poverty makes it impossible for her to apply any amount of money towards this debt. \n116.  Ms. Bermudez has continued to drive despite the risk that she may be cited again \nfor driving on a suspended license.  Her workplace is about seven miles away from her home.  It \ntakes her 25 minutes to drive to work.  It would take her about an hour to get to work on city \nbuses. \n117.  Ms. Bermudez also drives her four children to school, which is a 5- to 10-minute \ncar ride.  The alternative, that her children board a school bus at 6:45am to take an hour-long bus \nride to their school, would result in her young children becoming sleep-deprived, jeopardizing \ntheir ability to learn at school, as well as increasing their chances of numerous health problems.14  \nMs. Bermudez also drives to buy groceries at the store and to take her children to medical \nappointments.  \n                                                 \n14 See https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/sleep/conditioninfo/sleep-deprivation; See \nalso https://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/sleep.htm. \n \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT – 22 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 38    Filed 10/16/18    Page 23 of 40\n   \n118.  Ms. Bermudez knows she risks getting more traffic violations for driving on a \nsuspended license, which also means amassing more court debt.  However, she feels as though \nshe has no other choice to maintain her job and transport her family. \niii.  Jeremy Chase \n119.  Jeremy Chase is a 37-year-old resident of Vancouver, Washington.  Mr. Chase \nwas a resident of Oregon from 2006 to 2018.  Most recently, he lived in Milwaukie, Oregon.    \n120.  Mr. Chase is a disabled veteran of the United States Air Force.  He began \nreceiving Social Security Disability Insurance (“SSDI”) in 2009.  His only income is $817 per \nmonth in SSDI.  He also receives approximately $190 per month in food stamps.  \n121.  In early 2006, Mr. Chase decided to enroll as a journalism student at Portland \nState University.  \n122.  Mr. Chase’s license is currently suspended because he owes traffic debt to \nBeaverton Municipal Court.  Mr. Chase estimates that he owes $1,500 to that court. \n123.  Until recently, Mr. Chase also owed traffic debt to Gilliam County Justice Court \nand Sherman County Justice Court.  His debts to these three courts initially totaled more than \n$3,800 and stemmed from traffic citations issued on four separate dates between 2006 and 2008, \nwhile he was a low-income student.   \n124.  For each citation, Mr. Chase appeared in court and explained to the judge that he \nhad quit his job to enroll in school and could not afford to pay the fines and fees.  Each judge \nreferred Mr. Chase to a court administrator to discuss payment options.  \n125.  Mr. Chase’s first citation was in Gilliam County, Oregon.  The Gilliam County \nJustice Court administrator explained that payment plans were available, and that Mr. Chase \n \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT – 23 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 38    Filed 10/16/18    Page 24 of 40\n   \ncould elect to repay his debt over six or twelve months.  Mr. Chase responded that he was a low-\nincome student and could not afford a payment of more than $100, the lowest monthly payment \noffered.  He proposed repayment over twenty-four months instead.  The court administrator told \nhim that one year was the longest available repayment term. \n126.  Mr. Chase was given the same repayment options in Sherman County Justice \nCourt and Beaverton Municipal Court.  Each time, he told the court administrator he could not \nafford to repay the debt in twelve months; each time, the court administrator responded that \ntwelve months was the longest available repayment term.    \n127.  Mr. Chase financed his education with Pell Grants, government loans, and work \nstudy.  After paying tuition, he struggled to find affordable housing and pay for books, food, and \nother necessities.  He could not afford the lowest available monthly payment to any single court, \nmuch less to all three courts. \n128.  Gilliam County Justice Court, Sherman County Justice Court, and Beaverton \nMunicipal Court all eventually referred Mr. Chase’s debts to private collections agencies.  \n129.  The DMV suspended Mr. Chase’s license because of his failure to pay his traffic \ndebt.   \n130.  The DMV never considered whether Mr. Chase could afford to pay his traffic \ndebt, or whether he had been granted an opportunity to avoid suspension by establishing his \nindigence and/or entering into a payment plan he could afford, before suspending his license. \n131.  The DMV has not offered Mr. Chase, or made sure that he has been offered, any \nopportunity to reinstate his license based on his inability to pay. \n132.  Since 2013, Mr. Chase has been paying what he can afford toward his traffic debt. \n \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT – 24 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 38    Filed 10/16/18    Page 25 of 40\n   \n133.  He began with the Gilliam County debt.  He made $50 monthly payments to \nNorthwest Collections Agency, the private debt collector to which Gilliam County Justice Court \nassigned his debt.  After a year and a half of consecutive payments, that agency discharged the \ndebt. \n134.  In 2015, Mr. Chase began making $50 monthly payments toward his debt in \nSherman County.  After seven months of consecutive payments, that debt was discharged. \n135.  After repaying the Gilliam County and Sherman County debts, Mr. Chase went to \nBeaverton Municipal Court and requested a hearing before a judge regarding his traffic debt.  He \nknew that the DMV would lift the suspension on his driver’s license if the court certified that he \nwas making payments on a payment plan.  Mr. Chase wanted a judge to review his income and \napprove a payment plan he could afford. \n136.  A court administrator told Mr. Chase that because the debt had been referred to a \nprivate collections agency, the debt was “out of house” and he could not see a judge about a \npayment plan.  The administrator told him that, in order to get his license suspension lifted, the \nprivate collections agency would have to certify to the court that Mr. Chase was making \npayments on a payment plan. \n137.  Mr. Chase called Alliance One, the private collections agency, to ask about \nentering a payment plan.  Alliance One offered two repayment terms: six months and one year.  \nThe monthly payment on a twelve-month repayment term was more than $100 per month.  Mr. \nChase cannot afford monthly payments in that amount. \n138.  Mr. Chase told Alliance One that he is indigent and that his only source of income \nis SSDI.  Alliance One refused to offer a plan with a lower monthly payment.  \n \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT – 25 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 38    Filed 10/16/18    Page 26 of 40\n   \n139.  Since January 2018, Mr. Chase has been making monthly payments to Alliance \nOne on his debt to Beaverton Municipal Court.  He paid $75 per month in January, February, and \nMarch 2018, and he has paid $50 per month since then.  His license remains suspended because \nAlliance One will not certify to the court that Mr. Chase is making payments on a payment plan. \n140.  It is very difficult for Mr. Chase to make $50 monthly payments because he \nsurvives on a fixed income of $817 per month, plus food stamps.  He estimates that it will take \nhim two and a half years to discharge the debt with Alliance One.  \n141.  If Mr. Chase had an opportunity now, or at any time since his license was \nsuspended, to get his suspension lifted by showing that he cannot afford to pay his traffic debt, \nhe would take it.   \niv.  Cekais Toni Ganuelas \n142.  Cekais Toni Ganuelas is a 27-year-old resident of Mission, Oregon, which is \nabout six miles outside of Pendleton.  She and her 8-year-old daughter live in a room they rent \nfrom a friend.   \n143.  Until recently, Ms. Ganuelas worked as a bartender at a restaurant in Pendleton.  \nShe worked about twenty hours per week and earned minimum wage plus tips, or about $400 per \nweek.  She was fired in late July 2018 when she failed to show up for work due to transportation \ndifficulties.  Since Ms. Ganuelas lost her job, her only source of income is $140 per month from \nteaching yoga.  She does not currently receive food stamps or cash assistance.  \n144.  Ms. Ganuelas is an enrolled member of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla \nIndian Reservation.  The Tribes operate a shuttle service between Pendleton and Mission, \nOregon.  Ms. Ganuelas is able to use the shuttle some days.  However, the shuttle runs only \n \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT – 26 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 38    Filed 10/16/18    Page 27 of 40\n   \nbetween about 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Monday through Saturday.  The shuttle was not a viable option \nfor Ms. Ganuelas when she was working as a bartender because her shifts began and ended at \nirregular hours, including late at night.  In addition, the shuttle stopped on the opposite side of a \nbusy four-lane highway, requiring her to make a dangerous crossing on foot to get to work.   \n145.  In 2012, Ms. Ganuelas was cited for failure to display plates.  She was unable to \npay her $150 ticket, so the Pendleton Municipal Court notified the DMV.  The DMV suspended \nher driver’s license on July 16, 2012. \n146.  Since Ms. Ganuela’s license suspension in 2012, she has received multiple \nadditional suspension notices for failure to pay traffic debt.   \n147.  Most recently, the DMV sent Ms. Ganuelas a notice of suspension on October 27, \n2016, notifying her that her license would be suspended effective December 25, 2016.  That \nsuspension was in connection with her failure to pay a $195 speeding ticket in Umatilla County \nCircuit Court.   \n148.  Ms. Ganuelas has also been cited at least three times for driving with a suspended \nlicense.   \n149.  The DMV never considered whether Ms. Ganuelas could afford to pay her traffic \ndebt before suspending her license. \n150.  DMV has not offered Ms. Ganuelas any opportunity to reinstate her license based \non her inability to pay. \n151.  Ms. Ganuelas believes that she currently owes in excess of $750 in traffic debt to \nthree courts: Umatilla County Circuit Court, Pendleton Municipal Court, and Lower Kittitas \nCounty District Court in Washington State.  \n \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT – 27 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 38    Filed 10/16/18    Page 28 of 40\n   \n152.  When Ms. Ganuelas can afford to, she has made payments to the courts to pay for \nher traffic debt.  Currently, it is impossible for her to pay any amount of money toward her traffic \ndebt.  Without a steady source of income, paying any amount toward traffic debt would make it \neven harder to keep herself and her daughter clothed, fed, and housed. \n153.  Not having a valid driver’s license makes it difficult for Ms. Ganuelas to provide \nfor herself and her daughter.  In order to buy groceries, clothes, necessary household goods, she \nmust find a ride into Pendleton, which cost of at least $10 each way by taxi.   \n154.  Ms. Ganuelas’ daughter loves to play soccer and wants to play with the Pendleton \nYouth Soccer Association.  That group has strict rules about parental involvement and being on \ntime for practices and games.  Because Ms. Ganuelas has to rely on friends to get to Pendleton, \nher daughter has not been able to play on a soccer team for the past two years.  \n155.  Ms. Ganuelas has also missed many events at her daughter’s school because her \nlicense is suspended.  In December 2017, she was unable to attend an awards ceremony at her \ndaughter’s school, where he daughter received an award, because she could not drive there. \n156.  Family is very important to Ms. Ganuelas and her extended family lives in \nAlaska, Washington, and other parts of Oregon.  Not being able to drive with a valid license \nmeans she cannot travel to family functions out of state.  Ms. Ganuelas’ grandparents, who are \nmore than eighty years old, live in Yakima, Washington, 150 miles away from my home.  She \nlaments not being able to visit them and to attend important family events at their home because \nher license is suspended.   \n157.  Ms. Ganuelas knows the consequences of driving without a valid license.  To \nreturn home after her grandmother’s 84th birthday in Yakima in July 2015, Ms. Ganuelas took \n \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT – 28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 38    Filed 10/16/18    Page 29 of 40\n   \nthe risk of driving her mother’s car so that she could make it to work on time.  She had no other \ntransportation option.  She was stopped for speeding and for driving on a suspended license.  \n158.  Ms. Ganuelas has been trying to find work, but having a suspended license is a \nhurdle.  For the past three weeks, she have been looking for a job through the Tribal \nEmployment Rights Office.  One of the questions on the sign-in form is “do you have a valid \nlicense?”  Many of the jobs also require a driver’s license.  ODOT was hiring flaggers through \nTERO, but she did not qualify because her license is suspended.  It is also difficult for her to \nfollow up on applications or attend interviews without being able to drive.  \n159.  If Ms. Ganuelas had an opportunity now, or at any time since her license has been \nsuspended, to get her suspensions lifted by showing that she cannot afford to pay her traffic debt, \nshe would take it.   \n160.  Every day without a driver’s license makes it hard for Ms. Ganuelas to shop for \ngroceries, provide for her daughter, and find a job. \nv.  Karl Wade Roberts \n161.  Plaintiff Karl Wade Roberts is 57-year-old resident of Baker City, Oregon.  Mr. \nRoberts lives with his wife.  He and his wife each receive $562 per month in social security \nincome.  They do not receive income from any other source.  Their combined monthly income of \n$1,124 places them below the federal poverty line. \n162.  Mr. Roberts has been unable to work since March 2003 due to the combined \neffects of injuries from an automobile accident in 1984 and a traumatic brain injury in 2003.   \n163.  On December 30, 1994, DMV suspended Mr. Roberts’s license after he failed to \npay a traffic ticket.  His driving privileges have not been restored since then.   \n \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT – 29 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 38    Filed 10/16/18    Page 30 of 40\n   \n164.  During the last twenty-five years, Mr. Roberts has received at least twenty \nadditional notices of suspension based in full or in part upon his failure to pay tickets for minor \ntraffic violations, such as driving while suspended or illegal display of plates.  \n165.  Mr. Roberts currently owes traffic debt for approximately 11 unpaid traffic \ntickets.  He owes $3,580 in fees and fines to the Baker County Justice Court.  He also owes $465 \nto a collection agency on a traffic debt assigned to that agency by the Arlington County Justice \nCourt. \n166.  Before becoming disabled, Mr. Roberts made payments to the Baker County \nJustice Court, hoping to get his license reinstated.  Since then, he has acquired more traffic debt, \nmaking it impossible for him to make the payments with his limited income. \n167.  For Mr. Roberts’s amount of traffic debt, the Baker County Justice Court will not \napprove a payment plan with a monthly payment of less than $50 per month.  He cannot pay $50 \nper month toward those debts. \n168.  Mr. Roberts has been jailed for not paying traffic fines and fees that he could not \nafford to pay. \n169.  The DMV never considered whether Mr. Roberts could afford to pay his traffic \ndebt before suspending his license. \n170.  The DMV has not offered Mr. Roberts any opportunity to reinstate his license \nbased on his inability to pay. \n171.  Mr. Roberts’ wife does not have a driver’s license and requires frequent \ntransportation to medical appointments due to her health. \n172.  Mr. Roberts used to ride his bicycle, even during Baker City’s harsh winters, to \n \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT – 30 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 38    Filed 10/16/18    Page 31 of 40\n   \npurchase groceries and other necessities for his family.  As he has aged, it has become difficult \nfor him to carry groceries by bike. \n173.  Mr. Roberts is an enrolled member of the Western Cherokee Nation of Arkansas \nand Missouri.  As part of his Native heritage, he grew up fishing and hunting. Loss of driving \nprivileges severely diminished his ability to enjoy these important cultural and recreational \nactivities. \n174.  Mr. Roberts’ adult children live in Boise, Idaho and St. Louis, Missouri.  He \ncannot afford to fly to see them. Without a license, he rarely gets to visit them. \n175.  There is very little public transportation where Mr. Roberts lives.  \n176.  Mr. Roberts continues to drive on a limited basis.  He lives in fear, knowing that \nhe risks accumulating more traffic debt for driving with a suspended license, and additional jail \ntime, if he receives additional traffic tickets that he cannot afford to pay.  However, he needs to \ndrive to provide for his wife’s and his own basic needs. \nvi.   Rebecca Heath \n177.  Plaintiff Rebecca Heath is 60-year-old resident of Pendleton, Oregon. \n178.  Ms. Heath receives $750 per month in SSDI and $189 per month in food stamps.  \n179.  Ms. Heath is an enrolled member of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla \nIndian Reservation.  Each quarter, she receives $400 in casino dividends.  In the months she \nreceives a casino dividend check, her SSDI check is reduced by $400. \n180.  Ms. Heath does not receive income from any other source.  Her monthly income \nof $939 places her below the federal poverty line. \n181.  Ms. Heath suffers from a debilitating back injury.  She also fought a years-long \n \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT – 31 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 38    Filed 10/16/18    Page 32 of 40\n   \nbattle with a tuberculosis.  Due to these health problems, she was homeless for seven years, from \n2010 to 2017. \n182.  Ms. Heath was found disabled and began receiving SSDI in 2017.  Prior to that, \nshe attempted to make ends meet by collecting cans, selling beadwork, and performing Native \ndance.  She has not been able to maintain regular employment since 1997. \n183.  Ms. Heath’s driver’s license was originally suspended on September 29, 1995, \nafter she failed to appear on an out-of-state traffic ticket.  Her driving privileges have not been \nrestored since then. \n184.  Over the past 23 years, Ms. Heath has received approximately six additional \nnotices of driver’s license suspension from the DMV as a result of her inability to pay her traffic \ndebt.  At the time of each suspension, she was too poor to afford to pay the traffic debt. \n185.  Because more than 20 years have passed since Ms. Heath’s license was suspended \nfor failure to pay traffic debt, she is eligible for reinstatement.  However, she cannot reinstate her \nlicense because she cannot afford DMV’s testing and reinstatement fees of $149. \n186.  Ms. Heath has been jailed for paying traffic fines and fees that she could not \nafford to pay. \n187.  The DMV never considered whether Ms. Heath could afford to pay her traffic \ndebt before suspending her license. \n188.  The DMV has not offered Ms. Heath any opportunity to reinstate her license \nbased on her inability to pay. \n189.  The DMV does not waive or reduce reinstatement fees based on inability to pay. \n190.  Being unable to drive made it very difficult for Ms. Heath to find and maintain \n \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT – 32 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 38    Filed 10/16/18    Page 33 of 40\n   \nregular employment.  At her last regular job, in 1997, she had to walk 5.5 miles each way to get \nto work without driving. \n191.  Due to her inability to drive, Ms. Heath has had to pay expensive cab fares; walk \nlong distances in extreme weather; and take slow public transit systems.  She has missed \nimportant family and cultural events such as funeral services and tribal gatherings.  During the \nseven years she was homeless, Ms. Heath’s inability to drive meant that she had to carry all her \npossessions with her in a backpack. \n192.  Plaintiffs Mendoza, Bermudez, Roberts and Heath, through their attorney, sent a \nletter to Administrator McClellan of the DMV on August 14, 2018, requesting that their driver’s \nlicenses be reinstated, that their reinstatement fees be waived, and that the agency stop its \npractice of suspending driver’s licenses for non-payment of traffic debt.  Alternatively, these \nPlaintiffs requested that the DMV provide an opportunity, through a hearing, to lift their \nsuspensions based on their inability to pay their traffic debt.  \n193.  The DMV denied Plaintiffs’ requests in a letter, dated August 21, 2018.  \nV.     CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n194.  This action is brought and may properly be maintained as a class action pursuant \nto Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a)(1)-(4) and 23(b)(2). \n195.  This lawsuit satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy \nrequirements of those provisions. \nA.  Numerosity – Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1) \n196.  The class in this suit is so numerous that joinder of all of its members is \nimpracticable.  During the last ten years, the Oregon DMV suspended Oregonians’ driver’s \n \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT – 33 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 38    Filed 10/16/18    Page 34 of 40\n   \nlicenses 334,338 times for failure to pay traffic debt.  In 2017 alone, the DMV issued 32,280 \nlicense suspensions for failure to pay traffic debt.  Many of the individuals whose driver’s \nlicenses were suspended are, like the named plaintiffs, low-income people who are not paying \ntraffic debt solely because they cannot afford to. \nB.  Commonality – Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2) \n197.  The relief sought is common to all class members, and common questions of law \nand fact exist as to all class members.  All of the named Plaintiffs have had their driver’s licenses \nsuspended for non-payment of traffic debt.  All of the Plaintiffs were and are unable to pay \nbecause of their poverty. \n198.  The DMV automatically suspends driver’s licenses for failure to pay court fees \nand fines as mandated under Or Rev. Stat. § 809.416 and Or. Rev. Stat. § 809.210(4)(b).  The \nrequirements of the suspension statutes apply equally to class members, and the resolution of \nthese legal and factual issues will determine whether all class members are entitled to the relief \nthey seek. \n199.  The named Plaintiffs seek relief concerning whether the DMV’s policy and \npractice of suspending the driver’s licenses of those who are too poor to pay their traffic debt \nviolates the rights of class members.  Plaintiffs also seek relief mandating that Defendants end \ntheir policy and practice so that the constitutional rights of the class will be protected in the \nfuture. \n200.  The questions of law and fact common to the class predominate over any \nquestions affecting solely individual members of the action, and include: \na.  Whether Defendants’ policy and practice of suspending driver’s licenses for non-\n \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT – 34 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 38    Filed 10/16/18    Page 35 of 40\n   \npayment of traffic debt without considering the license-holder’s ability to pay \ndeprives Plaintiffs and class members of substantive due process and equal \nprotection, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution; \nb.  Whether Defendants’ wealth-based suspension scheme violates procedural due \nprocess because it does not provide an ability-to-pay hearing; \nc.  Whether Defendants’ wealth-based suspension scheme violates equal protection \nand substantive due process because indigent traffic debtors are treated differently \nthan traffic debtors who can afford to pay their traffic violation fines to avoid \ndriver’s license suspensions;  \nd.  Whether Defendants violate the Equal Protection Clause by treating indigent \ntraffic debtors differently from other similarly situated indigent debtors; \ne.  Whether Plaintiffs and members of the class are entitled to declaratory relief; and  \nf.  Whether Plaintiffs and class members are entitled to injunctive relief. \nC.  Typicality – Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3) \n201.  Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the class.  Plaintiffs, like all other members of the \nclass, are Oregon residents who had their driver’s licenses suspended for their inability to pay \ntheir traffic debt to Oregon courts.  They are all affected by the Defendants’ suspension of their \ndriver’s licenses and continue to risk further traffic violations – and traffic debt – by driving with \nsuspended driver’s licenses. \n202.  If the named Plaintiffs succeed in their claim that the Defendant’s policy and \npractice of suspending driver’s licenses of residents who are too poor to pay traffic debt violates \n \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT – 35 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 38    Filed 10/16/18    Page 36 of 40\n   \ntheir constitutional rights, that ruling would benefit every class member. \nD.  Adequacy – Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4) \n203.  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.  There are no \nknown conflicts among class members, all of whom have a similar interest in asserting their \nconstitutional rights. \nE.  Rule 23(b) \n204.  This case is appropriate for class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) \nbecause Defendants’ policy and practice of suspending driver’s licenses for non-payment of \ntraffic debt warrants declaratory and injunctive relief that is appropriate to the class as a whole.  \nA declaration and injunction stating that the DMV cannot suspend driver’s licenses when \nsomeone is too poor to pay their traffic debt would provide relief to every member of the class. \n205.  Concentrating this litigation in one forum, as opposed to separate individual cases \nin various courts, will promote judicial economy, consistency and parity among the claims of \nindividual class members.  Allowing this lawsuit to proceed as a class action will permit the class \nof similarly situated persons to prosecute their common claims in a single forum simultaneously \nand efficiently. \n206.  Plaintiffs are not aware of any difficulty that could be encountered in the \nmanagement of this action that would preclude its maintenance as a class action. \nVI.      FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (Due Process/Equal Protection Bearden \nand Griffin Violation)  \n207.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations above as if fully set forth \n \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT – 36 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 38    Filed 10/16/18    Page 37 of 40\n   \nherein. \n208.  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that “[n]o State \nshall … deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.” U.S. Const. \namend. XIV, §1. \n209.  The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that “[n]o \nState shall … deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” \n210.  Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12 (1956), and its progeny, establishes the principle \nthat people should not be penalized just for being poor.  Under Griffin, states must provide an \nevaluation of ability to pay to assess an individual’s indigence prior to any taking any measures \nthat could result in any additional punishment beyond that imposed upon financially solvent \nindividuals. \n211.  The Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses prohibit \npunishing individuals for non-payment without first determining that they had the ability to pay \nand willfully refused to make a monetary payment.  See Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660 \n(1983).   \n212.  Under Griffin and Bearden, DMV’s automatic suspension of driver’s licenses for \nnonpayment of traffic debt without any inquiry into or consideration of the license holder’s \nability to pay violates the right to substantive due process and equal protection. \nVII.   SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (Equal Protection Under Strange)   \n213.  Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations above as if fully set forth herein. \n214.  Defendants’ policy and practice of suspending driver’s licenses as a means of debt \n \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT – 37 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 38    Filed 10/16/18    Page 38 of 40\n   \ncollection for state courts from people who are too poor to pay their traffic debts, but not \nsuspending the driver’s licenses of other indigent judgment debtors, violates the right to equal \nprotection under the law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution. \n215.  Under James v. Strange, 407 U.S. 128 (1972), the Defendants’ policy and practice \nof suspending driver’s licenses under ORS § 809.416 violates the equal protection clause \nbecause it empowers the DMV to treat indigent traffic debtors worse than traffic debtors who \ncommitted bicycle, pedestrian, or parking offenses, private debtors with delinquent credit card \ndebt, and child support debtors.  In Oregon, only indigent traffic debtors are punished with \ndriver’s license suspensions without any inquiry into or consideration of their ability to pay their \ntraffic debt. \nVIII.   THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (Procedural Due Process – Failure to \nProvide Pre- and Post-Deprivation Hearings)  \n216.  Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations above as if fully set forth herein. \n217.  Plaintiffs have protected property and liberty interests in their driver’s licenses \nand their ability to drive legally.  Defendants violate Plaintiffs’ procedural due process rights by \nsuspending their licenses without affording them a pre-suspension hearing to determine whether \nthey are able to pay their traffic debt.  Defendants also violate Plaintiffs’ procedural due process \nrights by not affording them a post-suspension hearing to determine if they are unable to pay \ntheir traffic debt. \n218.  Plaintiffs are entitled to prospective relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, because they \n \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT – 38 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 38    Filed 10/16/18    Page 39 of 40\n   \nhave demonstrated that Defendants, acting under color of state law, caused them to suffer a \nviolation of a right secured by the Constitution. See West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988).   \nIX.     DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL \n219.  Plaintiffs hereby demand a trial by jury. \n     \nX.     PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all members of the proposed class, \npray for: \n(a)  An order designating this action as a class action;  \n(b)  A declaration that Defendants’ practices with respect to suspensions of driver’s \nlicenses as alleged herein have violated and continue to violate the Due Process and Equal \nProtection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution as to the class;   \n(c)  An order and judgment preliminarily and permanently ordering Defendants, their \nsubordinates, agents, employees, representatives, and all others acting or purporting to act on their \nbehalf, from suspending driver’s licenses for unpaid traffic debt against Plaintiffs and class \nmembers until such time as the DMV and the State of Oregon implement a system that complies \nwith the United States Constitution; \n(d) An order and judgment preliminarily and permanently ordering Defendants to remove \nPlaintiffs’ and class members’ suspensions for non-payment of traffic debt that were effected prior \nto the date of judgment in this matter and enjoining the Defendants from requiring the Plaintiffs \nand class members to pay reinstatement fees as a condition of reinstatement;  \n(e) An award of reasonable attorney fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988, and costs and \ndisbursements incurred herein; \n \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION ALLEGATION COMPLAINT – 39 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01634-HZ    Document 38    Filed 10/16/18    Page 40 of 40\n   \n(f) Prejudgment interest; and \n(g) Such other and further legal and equitable relief as this Court deems just and proper. \n \nDATED this 16th day of October 2018.   \n   \n   \n \n \nOREGON LAW CENTER \n \n \n/s/ Marisa Samuelson         \nEmily Teplin Fox, OSB No. 121720 \nefox@oregonlawcenter.org \nMarisa Samuelson, OSB No. 144234 \nmsamuelson@oregonlawcenter.org \nBeth Englander, OSB No. 980190 \nbenglander@oregonlawcenter.org \nKelsey Heilman, OSB No. 140348 \nkheilman@oregonlawcenter.org  \n522 SW Fifth Ave., Suite 812 \nPortland, OR 97204 \n(503) 473-8310 \n \nJonathan M.
