    "summary": "<p>On March 12, 2018, a group of U.S. children, their non-citizen parents, and other non-citizen adults filed this class action lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The plaintiffs challenged DHS&rsquo; new rule for determining whether or not to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designations for immigrants from countries facing various crises warranting their nationals to stay in the U.S. rather than be returned home. The plaintiffs argued that the new DHS rule violated their rights under the Fifth Amendment as well as requirements set out by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Represented by the ACLU, the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, and Sidley Austin LLP, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief. This case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and assigned to Judge Edward M. Chen.</p>\r\n<p>As the complaint explained, TPS is a formal mechanism by which individuals from designated countries can legally stay and work in the U.S. when their countries are facing armed conflict, natural disaster, or other extraordinary circumstances making it untenable for them to return. Breaking from previous administrations&rsquo; practices, the Trump administration adopted a new rule in assessing whether to continue TPS status that allowed it to ignore consideration of any new crises that emerged since TPS status was granted. The complaint argued that the new DHS rule threatened more than 200,000 individuals with the risk of losing their right to legally work and live in the U.S. Thus, the complaint argued that over 200,000 U.S. citizen children faced the choice of being separated from their families or leaving the only home they had ever known. Moreover, the complaint highlighted President Trump&rsquo;s various past statements to argue that issuance of the new rule was motivated by racial animus.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs were a combination of children who were U.S. citizens, their non-citizen parents with TPS status, and other adults with TPS status. The plaintiffs also sought to represent the following class: &ldquo;The U.S. citizen children, from ages five to eighteen, of all TPS holders from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Sudan.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>On May 3, 2018, the parties filed a joint letter brief concerning a discovery dispute they were having. The plaintiffs were seeking early discovery to support a motion for a preliminary injunction, but the defendants opposed the request. On May 17, Judge Chen directed DHS to begin assembling the administrative record to avoid delay if production is later required.</p>\r\n<p>DHS moved to dismiss the case on May 21. On June 15, the parties filed another joint letter brief regarding their discovery dispute. Specifically, the plaintiffs argued that discovery should not be limited to the administrative record given that they had pled separate constitutional claims. The defendants claimed that the court should first order production of the administrative record before considering questions of possible discovery.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Chen issued a summary order denying the defendants' motion to dismiss on June 25, 2018. 2018 WL 3109604. The court held that it had jurisdiction to hear the case because, although the courts were limited in reviewing TPS designation determinations, this case did not challenge a particular determination but rather a broader policy. The court also held that the APA claim stood because DHS had not provided any reasoned explanation for the new rule as required under the APA. The court maintained the Fifth Amendment equal protection claim based on the plaintiffs' racial animus argument, holding that the Fifth Amendment barred racial discrimination in the immigration setting regardless of how much deference the executive branch normally receives on immigration matters. Finally, the court maintained the due process claim because the APA and equal protection claims were sufficiently pleaded. Judge Chen also ordered the defendants to respond to plaintiffs' discovery requests and to produce the administrative records for the TPS termination of Sudan and Nicaragua within 10 days, and for El Salvador and Haiti one week later.</p>\r\n<p>On June 26, Judge Chen directed the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing whether the court should reconsider its holding with respect to the plaintiffs' equal protection claims in light of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in <em><a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15626\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trump v. Hawaii</a></em>.</p>\r\n<p>On July 20, Judge Chen referred the parties to Magistrate Judge Sallie Kim to address their ongoing discovery dispute.</p>\r\n<p>On August 6, 2018, Judge Chen issued another order denying the defendants' motion to dismiss, this time elaborating on his prior order and addressing intervening case law. 321 F.Supp.3d 1083. In addition to affirming his previous conclusions regarding the plaintiffs' APA and due process claims, Judge Chen found that the plaintiffs had plausibly alleged that racial and national-origin animus held by President Trump was a motivating factor in DHS's decision to terminate TPS designations, violating equal protection.</p>\r\n<p>On August 10, Magistrate Judge Kim granted the plaintiffs' request to require the defendants to produce documents they had withheld on the basis of the deliberative process privilege. That same day, the defendants sought an emergency stay of the Magistrate's order pending review by the district court. On August 13, Judge Chen denied the defendants' emergency motion, finding that the production of documents could not be delayed. Judge Chen then denied the defendants' request for relief from the discovery order on August 15.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction on August 23, which Judge Chen granted on Oct. 3, 2018. 2018 WL 4778285. The court held that the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm, including family separation and being forced to move back to countries where neither the children nor adults had any remaining ties. Moreover, the court held that the U.S. economy itself would be hurt if thousands of TPS status holders were suddenly removed. The court found that DHS had not provided any justification for its new rule, and that if anything, the rule was implemented out of racial animus and to affect the administration's pre-determined outcome to terminate TPS status. Subsequently, DHS appealed the decision to the Ninth Circuit, which assigned the appeal case number 18-16981. The district court approved the parties&rsquo; joint motion to stay proceedings pending the appeal on October 26, 2018.</p>\r\n<p>In the district court on Feb. 26, 2019, Judge Chen found <em>Bhattarai v. Nielsen</em> (located <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17194\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> in this Clearinghouse) to be related and reassigned the case to his docket.</p>\r\n<p>The Ninth Circuit heard oral argument on Aug. 14, 2019. On Aug. 21, the Court ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefs addressing whether (1) the government had waived any argument concerning the scope of the administrative record; if not, (2) whether the district court made sufficient findings to warrant additional discovery to supplement the record; and (3) whether the district court abused its discretion by ordering additional discovery. The parties filed their supplemental briefs.</p>\r\n<p>On September 14, 2020, the Ninth Circuit vacated the preliminary injunction. 975 F.3d 872. In an opinion by Judge Callahan, the Ninth Circuit found that the district court did not have jurisdiction to review the plaintiffs APA because the TPS statute itself states that the Secretary of Homeland Security possesses full and unreviewable discretion in designating foreign states under the statute. The Ninth Circuit also found that there was not sufficient likelihood that the plaintiffs would succeed on the merits of their claims, as they did not provide adequate evidence linking President Trump's statements about other countries to the DHS Secretaries' TPS decision-making. As such, after vacating the preliminary injunction, the Ninth Circuit remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\r\n<p>DHS petitioned for a rehearing <em>en banc</em>, but the parties agreed to enter the Circuit Mediation Program on June 25, 2021 while the petition for rehearing was pending. On February 13, 2023, Judge Murguia of the Ninth Circuit ordered another rehearing&nbsp;<em>en banc&nbsp;</em>and vacated the previous three judges' panel opinion. He ordered another oral argument to take place on June 20, 2023.</p>\r\n<p>On June 29, 2023, Judge Murguia put out another order based on the appellee's motion for voluntary dismissal. During 2021 and 2022, the Secretary of Homeland Security designated TPS for Haiti and Sudan while also rescinding the terminations for El Salvador and Nicaragua, providing an extension instead. Termination of TPS status was further rescinded for two additional countries, Nepal and Honduras. Based on these developments, Judge Murguia granted the motion for voluntary dismissal of the appeal before the Ninth Circuit. However, the court did not address whether the DHS&rsquo;s actions related to the countries at issue had mooted the case.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs then filed an amended class action complaint on August 24, 2023. The complaint expanded the class to include U.S. citizen children from the original four countries as well as Nepal and Honduras. The complaint first took issue with the &ldquo;unlawful terminations issued in 2017 and 2018&rdquo; which DHS has not recognized as unlawful, which they alleged would increase the risk of unlawful loss of TPS status in the future. Plaintiffs contended the terminations were unconstitutional because they were motivated by racial animus, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. Secondly, the complaint took issue with the Biden Administration&rsquo;s TPS designations/extensions which established registration deadlines that are \"irrational... grossly premature,&rdquo; contending they violated both the APA and the Fifth Amendment&rsquo;s Due Process Clause. Finally, the plaintiffs contended that DHS illegally charged Haitian and Sudanese TPS holders a $50 registration fee, for they were required to register as new applicants due to terminations the plaintiffs allege to be unlawful. On September 14, 2023, the defendants promptly filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, contending the case was moot.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On December 28, 2023, the District Court granted the defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss, finding the case to be moot. 2023 WL 9002731. The court found no indication that DHS&rsquo;s change in policy regarding TPS would be a &ldquo;temporary [one] that [it] will refute once&hellip;litigation has concluded.&rdquo; According to the court, although the current administration hasn&rsquo;t conceded that the prior TPS policy was unlawful, their square rejection of the policy is indicative that similar conduct is not reasonably expected to recur. The court held that action which implicitly repudiates prior policy establishes mootness, thereby dismissing the case with prejudice with regard to the TPS claims &mdash; that is, no chance of filing an amended complaint. In its order, the court also addressed the plaintiff&rsquo;s claim on the $50 registration fee. Seeing as no named plaintiff actually paid the fee following the new designations of Haiti and Sudan under TPS, the court found no plaintiff to have standing to proceed with the claim. For this registration fee claim only, Judge Chen dismissed the claim but provided the plaintiffs 60 days to file an amended complaint. The plaintiffs, thus, had until February 26, 2024 to file an amended complaint.</p>\r\n<p>Since the plaintiffs did not file an amended complaint by February 26, on February 27, 2024, the court ordered that the case be dismissed without prejudice.&nbsp;Judgment was entered in favor of the defendants.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Following the final judgment, plaintiffs filed a motion for attorney&rsquo;s fees on May 24, 2024. On August 15, 2024, the court deferred ruling on the motion and stayed the case pending a decision by the Supreme Court in Lackey v. Stinnie regarding the meaning of &ldquo;prevailing party.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Stinnie was decided by the Supreme Court on February 25, 2025. 145 S.Ct. 659.&nbsp;The case held that a victory on a preliminary injunction alone does not render a plaintiff &ldquo;prevailing&rdquo; for purposes of fee awards under 42 U.S.C. 1988, and that where external events render a case moot after the plaintiff wins a preliminary injunction, their victory on the preliminary injunction does not suffice to render plaintiffs prevailing. The parties in this case filed a joint status report on March 11, 2025 discussing their differing views on how Stinnie ought to be applied to the case at hand. Given the joint status report, the court ordered for supplemental briefings on the matter, with deadlines for each party in April and May of 2025.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case remains ongoing.&nbsp;</p>",

    "summary_short": "On March 12, 2018, children who are citizens of the U.S., their non-citizen parents, and other non-citizen adults filed this class action against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The plaintiffs challenged DHS’ new rule for determining whether or not to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designations for those countries facing various crises warranting their nationals to stay in the U.S. rather than be returned home. The plaintiffs argued that the new DHS rule violated Fifth Amendment due process and equal protection and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The court granted a preliminary injunction on Oct. 3, 2018. DHS appealed, and the Ninth Circuit issued a decision on September 14, 2020, vacating the preliminary injunction and remanding the case back to the district court. DHS petitioned the Ninth Circuit for a rehearing en banc, but due to changes in immigration policy between presidential administrations, the appeal was voluntarily dismissed. On August 24, 2023, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint with the district court challenging the lack of recognition of the previous TPS terminations as unlawful by the current presidential administration and taking issue with the new $50 registration fee associated with re-designation and extension of TPS status for select countries. In response, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for a lack of standing on September 14, 2023. On December 28, 2023, the District Court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss, finding the case to be moot, but provided the plaintiffs with 60 days to file an amended complaint regarding the claim on registration fees. The plaintiffs, thus, have until February 26, 2024 to file an amended complaint with regard to the only living claim left: registration fees. Since the plaintiffs did not file an amended complaint by February 26, on February 27, 2024, the court ordered that the case be dismissed without prejudice. Judgment was entered in favor of the defendants.\r\n\r\nFollowing the final judgment, plaintiffs filed a motion for attorney’s fees; however, the court deferred ruling on the motion and stayed the case pending a decision by the Supreme Court in Lackey v. Stinnie. Following the Supreme Court’s decision in Stinnie in February 2025, the case remains ongoing as the parties brief the court on how the decision impacts the case at hand.",

W. Bush signed the Immigration Act of \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  1990, creating the ―Temporary Protected Status‖ (TPS) program.  See Pub. L. 102-232 (1991).  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  The TPS statute codifies a long-standing practice: ―every Administration since and including that \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  of President Eisenhower has permitted one or more groups of otherwise deportable aliens to \nS d nr\nee 17  remain temporarily in the United States out of concern that the forced repatriation of these \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  individuals could endanger their lives or safety.‖  H.R. Rep. 100-627, at 6 (1988).  TPS is thus a \n19  humanitarian program: it authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to temporarily permit \n20  nationals from certain countries to live and work in the United States when an ongoing armed \n21  conflict, environmental disaster, or other conditions prevent the safe return of those persons to \n22  their countries of origin.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1254a(b)(1)(A)-(C).  Since 1990, several countries have \n23  received TPS status.   \n24  At issue here are the designations for El Salvador, Nicaragua, Haiti, and Sudan.  Sudan \n25  was designated for TPS in 1997 on account of a brutal civil war.  Its TPS designation was \n26  extended periodically by every administration until late 2017, when Defendants announced that \n27  Sudan‘s status would be terminated.  Similarly, Nicaragua was designated in 1999 due to \n28  Hurricane Mitch; El Salvador was designated in 2001 and Haiti in 2010, both on the basis of \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 2 of 57\n \n1  devastating earthquakes.  Each country‘s TPS designation was periodically extended on every \n2  occasion until late 2017.  Between October 2017 and January 2018, Defendants announced that \n3  TPS status for all four countries would be terminated by November 2, 2018 (Sudan), January 5, \n4  2019 (Nicaragua), July 22, 2019 (Haiti), and September 9, 2019 (El Salvador).    \n5  These TPS designations have given rise to a sizeable population of over 200,000 people \n6  who have lived in the United States with lawful status pursuant thereto for 10-20 years.  Many \n7  have built careers, bought homes, married, and had children—children who are U.S. citizens.   \n8  Plaintiffs in this case are TPS-beneficiaries and their U.S.-citizen children.  At the crux of \n9  their compliant is an allegation that Defendants, under the President‘s influence, have adopted a \n10  new interpretation of the TPS statute.  Whereas prior administrations evaluated the severity of \n11  intervening events when considering whether to extend TPS, the present administration allegedly \n12  ignores those events and focuses solely on whether the original rationale for TPS continues to \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  exist.   \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Plaintiffs assert four legal claims.  First, the U.S.-citizen children between the ages of 5 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  and 18 allege that Defendants‘ termination violates their substantive due process rights because \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  the Government—without good reason—is forcing them to choose between living in the United \nS d nr\nee 17  States without their parents or leaving their country of citizenship to return to countries they \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  maintain are unsafe.  Second, Plaintiffs allege that the termination of TPS and adoption of a new \n19  interpretation of the TPS statute violates the Constitution‘s equal protection guarantee because it \n20  they were based on President Trump‘s racial animus against persons from those countries and his \n21  alleged disdain for non-white immigrants.  Third, the TPS beneficiaries allege that Defendants \n22  have violated their substantive due process rights because they have not advanced a reasonable \n23  basis to terminate their TPS status of the countries in question or to change their interpretation of \n24  the TPS statute.  Finally, the TPS-beneficiaries allege that Defendants‘ actions violated the \n25  Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because Defendants departed from long-standing policy and \n26  practice without acknowledging the change or providing good reasons for it. \n27  Defendants have moved to dismiss on the basis that the Court lacks jurisdcition to hear \n28  Plaintiffs‘ claims or review the Secretary‘s decisions with respect to TPS.  Defendants also \n2 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 3 of 57\n \n1  maintain that, even if the Court has jurisdiction, Plaintiffs fail to state a claim on any theory.   \n2  A hearing was held on June 22, 2018.  See Docket Nos. 35, 39.  On June 25, 2018, this \n3  Court issued a summary order denying the motion (Docket No. 34 ).  This order elaborates on that \n4  order and addresses intervening case law. \n5  I.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n6  Plaintiffs are nine persons who have permission to live and work in the United States \n7  because their countries of origin have been designated for ―Temporary Protected Status‖ (TPS) \n8  and four U.S.-citizen children whose parents currently hold TPS status.  See Compl. ¶¶ 16-29.  \n9  The TPS holders come from Sudan, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Haiti, four countries that have \n10  continuously been designated for TPS since 1997, 1999, 2001, and 2010, respectively.  Pursuant to \n11  these TPS designations, Plaintiffs with TPS have been lawfully present in the United States from \n12  approximately ten to twenty years.  Despite long-standing practice periodically extending TPS \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  designations for these four countries, Defendants announced that TPS would be terminated over a \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  three month period between October 2017 and January 2018.  As a result, over 200,000 residents \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  who have resided in the United States for years, some for decades, stand to lose their permission to \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  live and work in the United States and will be subject to deportation.  Below, the Court \nS d nr\nee 17  summarizes Plaintiffs‘ personal experiences as well as the history of TPS designations for each of \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  the four countries at issue. \n19  A.  Plaintiffs‘ Backgrounds \n20  The following is a sample of Plaintiffs‘ backgrounds alleged in the Complaint. \n21  1.  Hiwaida Elarabi (Sudan) \n22  Plaintiff Hiwaida Elarabi is originally Sudanese, but has lived in the United States since \n23  1997 with TPS status.  Compl. ¶ 29.  She came to the United States with a valid visitor‘s visa in \n24  1997 to visit her aunt and family (all of whom are U.S. citizens); the security situation in Sudan \n25  deteriorated during her stay.  Compl. ¶ 65.  For that reason, the United States government \n26  designated Sudan for TPS and Ms. Elarabi was permitted to remain in the United States because \n27  she could not safely return to Sudan.  Id.  She has spent the past 20 years here because the United \n28  States has extended Sudan‘s TPS designation at every relevant interval.  In the United States, Ms. \n3 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 4 of 57\n \n1  Elarabi a Master‘s degree in Bioinformatics from Brandeis University.  Id.  For 16 years, she \n2  worked as a Health Educator at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.  Id.  In 2015, she \n3  borrowed money to open a restaurant.  Id.  After Defendants terminated Sudan‘s TPS designation, \n4  she ―made the difficult decision to sell it, at great cost‖ because ―her future was uncertain and she \n5  did not know whether she would be able to sustain the restaurant.‖  Id.  Now, she must leave the \n6  country she has lived in since 1997.   \n7  2.  Elsy Yolanda Flores de Ayala, Maria Jose and Juan Eduardo (El Salvador) \n8  Plaintiff Elsy Yolanda Flores de Ayala was born in El Salvador.  Her mother, father, and \n9  siblings fled El Salvador in the 1980s due to the country‘s brutal civil war, but she could not make \n10  the journey because she was too young.  Compl. ¶ 60.  Her immediate relatives are now U.S. \n11  citizens or legal permanent residents.  In 2000, Ms. Flores de Ayala married, and migrated to the \n12  United States with her daughter, Plaintiff Maria Jose Ayala Flores, a one-year-old at the time.  Id.  \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  While they were in the United States, devastating earthquakes struck El Salvador.  Id.  The United \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  States determined that nationals of El Salvador could not safely return and designated the country \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  for TPS.  Id.  Ms. Flores de Ayala and her daughter, Maria Jose, been living in the United States \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  since 2000 with TPS protection.  In the United States, Ms. Flores de Ayala has worked as a \nS d nr\nee 17  domestic worker and child-care provider for over fourteen years.  Id. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Maria Jose, Ms. Flores de Ayala‘s daughter, is now 19-year-old.  Compl. ¶ 59.  She was \n19  brought to the United States as an infant and has lived virtually her whole life here under the \n20  umbrage of TPS.  Id.  All her schooling has taken place here.  Id.  In 2016, she graduated high \n21  school.  Id.  She did not learn of her TPS status until she applied for college and realized she was \n22  ineligible for many scholarships.  Id.  Currently, she is studying mathematics at Montgomery \n23  College in Maryland and would like to teach math to elementary students.  Id.  However, if \n24  Defendants‘ termination of TPS for El Salvador takes effect, she will be required to leave the only \n25  country she has known and will be unable to complete her studies. \n26  Ms. Flores de Ayala‘s youngest son, Juan Eduardo, is a U.S.-citizen.  Compl. ¶ 53.  He was \n27  born in the United States and is also a plaintiff in this case.  Id.  He is currently in seventh grade.  \n28  Id.  He may have no choice but to return to El Salvador with his parents and siblings, or be \n4 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 5 of 57\n \n1  separated from them and placed with another family if he remains in the country of his citizenship \n2  to complete his education.  Id.   \n3  3.  Hnaidi Cenemat and Wilna Destin (Haiti) \n4  The plaintiffs from Nicaragua and Haiti will confront similar hardship.  Plaintiff Hnaidi \n5  Cenemat is also a U.S.-citizen, fourteen years old, whose mother, Plaintiff Wilna Destin, was born \n6  in Haiti but has lived in the United States for 18-years after Haiti suffered from an earthquake that \n7  prompted TPS designation.  Compl. ¶ 54.  Hnaidi is a freshman high school student in Florida, \n8  where she is on the honor roll and active in her school and church communities, joining her church \n9  choir and aspiring to join the cheerleading and flag football teams at her school in addition to the \n10  Student Council.  Id.  She enjoys studying math and science and aspires to become an \n11  obstetrician/gynecologist to help others.  Id.  She fears moving to Haiti with her mother—a \n12  country she does not know—but she also fears being placed with a foster family in the United \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  States without her mother.  Id.  The situation is no less harrowing for her mother, Wilna.  Compl. ¶ \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  61.  Wilna not only fears separation from her daughter, but also does not want to leave behind the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  life she has built in the United States over the past eighteen years (eight of them with TPS status).  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Id.  She owns a home in Florida, is an active member of her community and church, and has \nS d nr\nee 17  worked for a union for the past four years.  Id.  After Hurricane Katrina, she traveled to New \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Orleans to volunteer with humanitarian relief efforts.  Id. \n19  4.  Imara Ampie (Nicaragua) \n20  Plaintiff Imara Ampie was born in Nicaragua, but traveled to the United States in 1998 at \n21  the age of 26 to procure material for her mother‘s tailoring business.  Compl. ¶ 63.  While she was \n22  here, Nicaragua was devastated by Hurricane Mitch.  Id.  The government designated Nicaragua \n23  for TPS, so Ms. Ampie stayed here.  Id.  She married another TPS holder and they had two \n24  children in the United States, who are both U.S. citizens.  Id.  She has lived here for twenty years.  \n25  Id.  She owns a home in California.  Id.  She worries that she will have to return to Nicaragua \n26  despite the lives she and her husband have built here, and that she will not be able to satisfy her \n27  family‘s health care and educational needs in Nicaragua.  Id.  Her children would suffer whether \n28  they are required to return to Nicaragua or whether they remain in the United States without their \n5 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 6 of 57\n \n1  parents.  Id.  She has been here more than half of her adult life. \n2  The plight of other named Plaintiffs are described in ¶¶ 50-65 of the Complaint.  As noted \n3  above, over 200,000 other people stand to lose their TPS status.  Id. ¶ 2.  Further, over 200,000 \n4  U.S.-citizen children have at least one parent who is a TPS holder likely to be deported.  Id.  \n5  B.  Background of TPS Designations and Terminations \n6  The history of TPS designation for Haiti, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Sudan is \n7  summarized below. \n8  1.  Haiti \n9  Haiti was originally designated for TPS on January 21, 2010 based on the 7.0-magnitude \n10  earthquake on January 12, 2010 that prevented Haitians from returning safely.  See Designation of \n11  Haiti for Temporary Protected Status, 75 Fed. Reg. 3476 (Jan. 21, 2010).  The Secretary described \n12  that a third of Haiti‘s population had been affected by the earthquake and that Haiti‘s critical \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  infrastructure—including hospitals, food, water, electricity, and telephone supplies—was severely \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  impaired.  Id.  Haiti‘s designation was subsequently extended and re-designated four times by the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Obama administration and once by the Trump administration.1  Three of the designations cited \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  factors other than the original earthquakes; for example, the 2012, 2014, and 2015 extensions cited \nS de nre 17  subsequent ―steady rains . . . which led to flooding and contributed to a deadly cholera outbreak.‖2 \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  On January 18, 2018, Acting Secretary Duke announced that Haiti‘s TPS designation \n19  would be terminated effective July 22, 2019.  See Termination of the Designation of Haiti for \n20  Temporary Protected Status, 83 Fed. Reg. 2648-01 (Jan. 18, 2018).  The termination notice states \n21  that ―DHS has reviewed conditions in Haiti‖ in consultation with other federal agencies and \n22 \n                                                 \n23 \n1  See Extension and Redesignation of Haiti for Temporary Protected Status, 76 Fed.

The notice states that Haiti ―has made progress \n4  recovering from the 2010 earthquake and subsequent effects that formed the basis for its \n5  designation,‖ including that 98% of internally displaced persons sites have closed, and only \n6  38,000 of the estimated 2 million Haitians who lost their homes were still living in camps in June \n7  2017.  Id.  The United Nations had withdrawn its peacekeeping mission in October 2017.  Id.  It \n8  held a presidential election, and the Haitian government was working to rebuild government \n9  infrastructure that had been destroyed.  Economic recovery ―has been generally positive.‖  Id.  \n10  Further, ―[a]lthough Haiti has grappled with a cholera epidemic that began in 2010 in the \n11  aftermath of the earthquake, cholera is currently at its lowest level since the outbreak began.‖  Id.  \n12  Based on these considerations, the Acting Secretary determined that ―the conditions for the \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  designation of Haiti for TPS‖ are no longer met.  Id. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  2.  El Salvador \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  El Salvador was designated for TPS on March 9, 2001 based on a series of earthquakes.  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  See Designation of El Salvador Under Temporary Protected Status, 66 Fed. Reg. 14214 (Mar. 9, \nS d nr\nee 17  2001) (citing a ―devastating earthquake‖ causing displacement of 17% of the population, \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  destruction of 220,000 homes, 1,696 schools, and 856 public buildings, and causing losses in \n19  excess of $2.8 billion).  El Salvador‘s designation has been extended 11 times by the Bush and \n20  Obama administrations,3 including due to ―a subsequent drought‖ in 2002,4 and the effects of \n21 \n                                                 \n3  See Extension of the Designation of El Salvador Under the Temporary Protected Status \n22 \nProgram, 67 Fed.

See Termination of the Designation of El Salvador for Temporary Protected \n5  Status, 83 Fed. Reg. 2654-01 (Jan. 18, 2018).  According to the notice, the Secretary ―reviewed \n6  conditions in El Salvador‖ and considered input from other government agencies, and ―determined \n7  that the conditions supporting El Salvador‘s 2001 designation for TPS on the basis of \n8  environmental disaster due to the damage caused by the 2001 earthquakes are no longer met.‖  Id. \n9  at 2655-56.  The notice states that recovery efforts relating to the earthquakes have ―largely‖ \n10  completed, ―social and economic conditions affected by the earthquakes have stabilized,‖ and \n11  ―people are able to conduct their daily activities without impediments directly related to damage \n12  from the earthquakes.‖  Id. at 2656.  It also notes that El Salvador has been accepting the return of \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  people removed from the United States, including 20,538 persons in 2016 and 18,838 in 2017.  Id.  \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  The notice also describes the international aid El Salvador has received since 2001, the completion \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  of ―many reconstruction projects,‖ including schools, hospitals, homes, and support for improving \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  water, sanitation, and roads.  The notice also cites ―stead[y] improv[ement]‖ in El Salvador‘s \nS d nr\nee 17  economy, including a 7% unemployment rate and increases in its gross domestic product.  Id.  The \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  notice acknowledges that assistance and resources for returnees are ―limited,‖ but that the \n19  governments of the U.S., El Salvador, and international organizations ―are working cooperatively \n20  to improve security and economic opportunities.‖  Id. \n21  3.

Duke announced the termination of \n4  Sudan‘s TPS status, to be effective November 2, 2018 in order to permit an orderly transition.  See \n5  Termination of the Designation of Sudan for Temporary Protected Status, 82 Fed. Reg. 47228-02 \n6  (Oct. 11, 2017).  The notice explains that Sudan‘s designation was terminated because: \n \n7  DHS and the Department of State (DOS) have reviewed the \nconditions in Sudan.  Based on this review and consultation, the \n8  Secretary has determined that conditions in Sudan have sufficiently \nimproved for TPS purposes.  Termination of the TPS designation of \n9  Sudan is required because it no longer meets the statutory conditions \nfor designation.  The ongoing armed conflict no longer prevents the \n10  return of nationals of Sudan to all regions of Sudan without posing a \nserious threat to their personal safety.  Further, extraordinary and \n11  temporary conditions within Sudan no longer prevent nationals from \nreturning in safety to all regions of Sudan. \n  12   \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Id. at 47230.  The notice explains that conflict is limited to Darfur and the Two Areas (South \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Kordofan and Blue Nile states), but that in the 2016-2017 timeframe, the parties in conflict \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  engaged in ―time-limited unilateral cessation of hostilities declarations‖ that ―result[ed] in a \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  reduction in violence and violent rhetoric.‖  Id.  ―The remaining conflict is limited and does not \nS d nr\nee 17  prevent the return of nationals of Sudan to all regions of Sudan without posing a serious threat to \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  their personal safety.‖  Id.

Defendants‘ Termination Decisions \n4  Plaintiffs question how the conditions in four countries that had been repeatedly designated \n5  for TPS by multiple administrations over an eight to twenty year period improve within the span \n6  of four months between October 2017 and January 2018.  Plaintiffs contend Defendants ―adopted \n7  a novel interpretation of the TPS statute.‖  Compl. ¶ 75.  Previously, ―DHS or its predecessors \n8  considered intervening natural disasters, conflicts, and other serious social and economic problems \n9  as relevant factors when deciding whether to continue or instead terminate a TPS designation,‖ but \n10  ―the Trump administration‘s DHS has now taken the position that such factors cannot be \n11  considered.‖  Id.  This change occurred without any explicit acknowledgment, announcement, or \n12  explanation.  Id. ¶ 76.   \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Plaintiffs cite two statements given to Congress by DHS officials as evidence to support \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  those claims.  On June 6, 2017, then-DHS Secretary John Kelly stated that ―the program [TPS] is \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  for a specific event.  In – in Haiti, it was the earthquake.  Yes, Haiti had horrible conditions before \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  the earthquake, and those conditions aren‘t much better after the earthquake.  But the earthquake \nS d nr\nee 17  was why TPS was – was granted and – and that‘s how I have to look at it.‖  Id. ¶ 76.  Current \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Secretary Kirstjen Nielson more expressly stated that ―[t]he law does not allow me to look at the \n19  country conditions of a country writ large.  It requires me to look very specifically as to whether \n20  the country conditions originating from the original designation continue to exist.‖  Id.  ¶ 77.   \n21  Plaintiffs contend this change in approach was not a good-faith change in legal \n22  interpretation of the TPS statute.  Instead, they allege Defendants‘ action was motivated by racial \n23  and national-origin animus.  Compl. ¶ 66.  They trace the animus to President Donald J. Trump \n24  and others in his administration who have made statements which ―leave no doubt as to the \n25  speaker‘s racially discriminatory motives against non-white and non-European immigrants.‖  Id.  \n26  Most relevant to the TPS terminations at issue here, in a January 11, 2018 meeting with \n27  Congressional representatives concerning TPS protections for nationals from Latin American and \n28 \n12 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 13 of 57\n \n1  African countries, in which at least El Salvador and Haiti were specifically discussed,11 President \n2  Trump wondered aloud, ―Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?‖  \n3  Id. ¶ 70.  He expressed a preference, instead, for immigrants from countries like Norway, which is \n4  overwhelmingly white.  Id.  President Trump asked ―Why do we need more Haitians?‖ and \n5  ―insisted that lawmakers ‗[t]ake them out‘ of any potential immigration deal.‖  Id.   \n6  Just one week after President Trump‘s comments, Deputy Secretary Duke announced the \n7  decision terminating Haiti‘s TPS designation, and Secretary Nielsen announced the decision \n8  terminating El Salvador‘s designation.  Compl. ¶¶ 81, 84.  Secretary Nielsen was allegedly present \n9  at the meeting with President Trump.  Id. ¶ 72.   \n10  The White House has allegedly exerted pressure on DHS with respect to recent TPS \n11  terminations.  In particular, Plaintiffs allege that in November 2017, White House Chief of Staff \n12  John F. Kelly and White House Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert ―repeatedly called \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Acting [DHS] Secretary Duke and pressured her to terminate the TPS designation for Honduras.‖  \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Compl. ¶ 73.  One official with knowledge of the exchange stated that ―[t]hey put massive \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  pressure on [Acting Secretary Duke].‖  Id.  Chief of Staff Kelly who allegedly called from Japan \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  while traveling with President Trump, ―was irritated and persistent,‖ and ―warn[ed] Acting \nS d nr\nee 17  Secretary Duke that the TPS program ‗prevents [the Trump Administration‘s] wider strategic goal‘ \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  on immigration.‖  Id.  The pressure was so severe that Acting Secretary Duke stated she would \n19  resign her position.  Id.  \n20  II.  LEGAL STANDARD \n21  Defendants move to dismiss under both Rule 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). \n22  A.  Rule 12(b)(1) \n23  ―[A] defendant may challenge the plaintiff‘s jurisdictional allegations in one of two ways.  \n24 \n                                                 \n25 \n11  Plaintiffs‘ complaint cites a news article stating that the topic of discussion at the January 11, \n2018 meeting was immigrants ―from Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries.  See Compl. at 20, \n26 \nn. 37 (citing Josh Dawsey, Trump Derides Protections for Immigrants from “Shithole” Countries, \nWASH. POST (Jan 12, 2018), https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-attacks-protections-\n27 \nfor-immigrants-from-shithole-countries-in-oval-office-meeting/2018/01/11/bfc0725c-f711-11e7-\n91af-31ac729add94_story.html.  The article is incorporated by reference into the complaint.  See \n28 \nIn re NVIDIA Corp. Securities Litig., 768 F.3d 1046, 1051 (9th Cir. 2014). \n13 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 14 of 57\n \n1  A ‗facial‘ attack accepts the truth of the plaintiff‘s allegations but asserts that they are insufficient \n2  on their face to invoke federal jurisdiction.  The district court resolves a facial attack as it would a \n3  motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6): Accepting the plaintiff‘s allegations as true and drawing \n4  all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff‘s favor, the court determines whether the allegations are \n5  sufficient as a legal matter to invoke the court‘s jurisdiction.‖  Leite v. Crane Co., 749 F.3d 1117, \n6  1121 (9th Cir. 2014) (citations and quotations omitted). \n7  ―A ‗factual‘ attack, by contrast, contests the truth of the plaintiff‘s factual allegations, \n8  usually by introducing evidence outside the pleadings.  When the defendant raises a factual attack, \n9  the plaintiff must support her jurisdictional allegations with ‗competent proof,‘ under the same \n10  evidentiary standard that governs in the summary judgment context.  The plaintiff bears the \n11  burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that each of the requirements for subject-\n12  matter jurisdiction has been met.‖  Id. (citations omitted).   \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Here, Defendants concede that they are mounting only a ―facial‖ attack to Plaintiffs‘ \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  allegations with respect to jurisdiction.  Accordingly, the Court accepts those allegations as true \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  and draws reasonable inferences in their favor.   \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  B.  Rule 12(b)(6) \nS d nr\nee 17  In reviewing a motion to dismiss, the Court takes all allegations of material fact as true and \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  construes them in favor of the plaintiffs to determine whether a plausible legal claim has been \n19  stated.   Cousins v. Lockyer, 568 F.3d 1063, 1067 (9th Cir. 2009).  A claim ―has facial plausibility \n20  [if the plaintiffs] plead[] factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that \n21  the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.‖  Aschroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  \n22  Importantly, ―[i]f there are two alternative explanations [for the challenged conduct], one \n23  advanced by defendant and the other advanced by plaintiff, both of which are plausible, plaintiff‘s \n24  complaint survives a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).‖  Starr v. Baca, 652 F.3d 1202, 1216 \n25  (9th Cir. 2011).  Dismissal is only warranted if Defendants‘ ―plausible alternative explanation is \n26  so convincing that [Plaintiffs‘] explanation is implausible.‖  Id. (emphasis in original).   \n27  III.  DISCUSSION \n28  Defendants argue that the Court lacks jurisdiction to review any claim related to \n14 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 15 of 57\n \n1  Defendants‘ termination of TPS for the four countries at issue and that, even if the Court can \n2  consider Plaintiffs‘ claims, they each fail on the merits.  For the reasons stated in its prior \n3  summary order and below, the Court denies Defendants‘ motion. \n4  A.  Jurisdictional Bar – Dismissal Under Rule 12(b)(1) \n5  Section 1254a(b)(5)(A) of the TPS statute provides:  \n \n6  There is no judicial review of any determination of the [Secretary of \nHomeland Security]12 with respect to the designation, or termination \n7  or extension of a designation, of a foreign state under this \nsubsection. \n8   \n9  8 U.S.C. § 1254a(b)(5)(A).   \n10  Defendants construe this provision broadly to preclude review not only of the Secretary‘s \n11  substantive determination with respect to a particular country (e.g., whether conditions in a \n12  particular foreign country have abated), but also any generally applicable process, practice, or \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  legal interpretation employed by the Secretary in making such determinations.  The Court first \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  construes the scope of § 1254a and then considers whether Plaintiffs‘ claims fall within its scope. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  1.  Section 1254a Does Not Preclude Challenges to General Collateral Practices \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Statutory interpretation begins with the text of the statute. See Los Angeles Lakers, Inc. v. \nS d nr\nee 17  Fed. Ins. Co., 869 F.3d 795, 802 (9th Cir. 2017).  Construction of a jurisdiction-stripping statute, \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  however, is guided by important overarching principles.  ―A strong presumption exists that the \n19  actions of federal agencies are reviewable in federal court.‖  KOLA, Inc. v. U.S., 882 F.2d 361, 363 \n20  (9th Cir. 1989); see also Sackett v. E.P.A., 566 U.S. 120, 128 (2012) (explaining that ―[t]he \n21  APA . . . creates a presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action‖).  Furthermore, \n22  ―where Congress intends to preclude judicial review of constitutional claims its intent to do so \n23  must be clear.‖  Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592, 603 (1988).  The presumption in favor of judicial \n24  review may be overcome ―only upon a showing of ‗clear and convincing evidence‘ of a contrary \n25  legislative intent.‖ Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 141 (1967) (citations omitted).  Such \n26  indications may be ―drawn from ‗specific language,‘ ‗specific legislative history,‘ and ‗inferences \n27 \n                                                 \n12  Section 1254a vests this authority with the Attorney General, but that power was subsequently \n28 \ntransferred to the Secretary of Homeland Security.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1103; 6 U.S.C. § 557. \n15 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 16 of 57\n \n1  of intent drawn from the statutory scheme as a whole,‘ that Congress intended to bar review.‖  \n2  Cuozzo Speed Techs., LLC v. Lee, 136 S. Ct. 2131, 2140 (2016) (quotation omitted).  Finally, \n3  ―[e]ven where the ultimate result [of a statute] is to limit judicial review, . . . as a matter of the \n4  interpretive enterprise itself, the narrower construction of a jurisdiction-stripping provision is \n5  favored over the broader one.‖  ANA Int’l, Inc. v. Way, 393 F.3d 886, 891 (9th Cir. 2004).  Giving \n6  effect to provisions eliminating judicial review raises serious questions as to separation of powers, \n7  and raises constitutional concerns.  See Webster, 486 U.S. at 603 (explaining that a ―heightened \n8  showing‖ of Congressional intent is required ―in part to avoid the ‗serious constitutional question‘ \n9  that would arise if a federal statute were construed to deny any judicial forum for a colorable \n10  constitutional claim‖). \n11  The TPS statute precludes review of the ―any determination . . .  with respect to the \n12  designation, or termination or extension of a designation, of a foreign state under this subsection.‖  \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  8 U.S.C. § 1254a(b)(5)(A) (emphasis added).  The statute does not define ―determination,‖ but it \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  is evident from the statutory context that this provision refers to the designation, termination, or \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  extension of a country for TPS.  Id.  The statute uses the word ―determines‖ or ―determination‖ in \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  connection with the Secretary‘s initial designation, periodic review, and termination of a TPS \nS d nr\nee 17  foreign-state designation.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1254a(b)(3)(A) (providing that the Secretary \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  periodically ―shall determine whether the conditions for such designation . . . continue to be met‖ \n19  and to timely publish ―such determination‖); id. § 1254a(b)(3)(B) (if the Secretary ―determines‖ \n20  the conditions are no longer met, then he ―shall terminate the designation by publishing notice . . . \n21  of the determination‖); id. § 1254a(b)(3)(C).  There is no clear provision stating ―determination‖ \n22  refers to, e.g., general procedures or criteria applied in making such country-by-country \n23  determinations. \n24  The Supreme Court has concluded that similar statutes which preclude review of a \n25  ―determination‖ of immigration status did not preclude review of collateral practices and policies.  \n26  For example, McNary v. Haitian Refugee Ctr., Inc., 498 U.S. 479 (1991), concerned a jurisdiction-\n27  stripping provision related to the ―Special Agricultural Workers‖ (SAW) amnesty program for \n28  certain farmworkers.  Under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (―IRCA‖), alien \n16 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 17 of 57\n \n1  farmworkers who were unlawfully present but met certain criteria could apply for adjustment of \n2  status.  See generally 8 U.S.C. § 1160(a).  The Attorney General was responsible for administering \n3  the application process, including a required interview.  The plaintiffs in McNary alleged that the \n4  ―interview process was conducted in an arbitrary fashion that deprived applicants of the due \n5  process guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution‖ because, inter alia, they were not \n6  apprised of or given an opportunity to challenge adverse evidence, denied the opportunity to \n7  present witnesses, were denied access to competent interpreters, and because the interviews were \n8  not recorded, inhibiting meaningful review of denials.  Id. at 487.  They did not challenge their \n9  individual denials on the merits (i.e., the application of the statute‘s substantive eligibility criteria \n10  to their individual case), but rather collaterally challenged the process under which their denials \n11  were determined. \n12  The government argued that the McNary plaintiffs‘ claims were precluded from bringing \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  suit because the statute (similar to the TPS statute here) provided that ―[t]here shall be no \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  administrative or judicial review of a determination respecting an application for adjustment of \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  status under this section except [as provided under 8 U.S.C. § 1160(e)(3)(A) of ‗an order of \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  exclusion or deportation‘].‖  8 U.S.C. § 1160(e).  The Supreme Court held that ―the reference to ‗a \nS d nr\nee 17  determination‘ describes a single act rather than a group of decisions or a practice or procedure \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  employed in making decisions.‖  Id. at 492 (emphasis added).  The court found that its \n19  interpretation was bolstered by the fact that the statute limited judicial review of such \n20  ―determinations‖ to a narrow process; that review was limited to an administrative record related \n21  to an individual‘s eligibility for relief, and was thus inadequate ―to address the kind of procedural \n22  and constitutional claims‖ asserted by the plaintiffs.  Id. at 493.  The Supreme Court noted that, \n23  ―had Congress intended the limited review provisions . . . to encompass challenges to INS \n24  procedures and practices, it could easily have used broader statutory language,‖ such as ―all \n25  causes . . . arising under‖ the statute, or ―all questions of law and fact.  Id. at 494.  In short, the \n26  Supreme Court held that ―[w]e agree . . . this language [describes] the process of direct review of \n27  individual denials of SAW status, rather than as referring to general collateral challenges to \n28  unconstitutional practices and policies used by the agency in processing applications.‖  498 U.S. at \n17 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 18 of 57\n \n1  492. \n2  The Supreme Court applied McNary in Reno v. Catholic Social Servs., Inc., 509 U.S. 43 \n3  (1993) (―CSS‖).  In Reno, the Supreme Court considered a challenge to regulations promulgated \n4  by the AG pursuant to IRCA with respect to another amnesty program permitting certain aliens to \n5  adjust their immigration status.  A similar set of jurisdiction-stripping provisions collectively \n6  provided that ―a determination respecting an application for adjustment of status‖ could only be \n7  reviewed in a single level of administrative appellate review and then ―only in the judicial review \n8  of an order of deportation.‖  See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1255a(f)(1), 1255a(f)(3)(A), 1255a(f)(4)(A), \n9  1255a(f)(1).  Although the suit in Reno was not the judicial review authorized by the statute, the \n10  Court permitted the case to proceed because the plaintiffs‘ challenge was to the AG‘s regulations \n11  interpreting the statute, rather than an individual determination.  The Supreme Court thus held that \n12  the jurisdiction-stripping provision did not apply.13   \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Here, Plaintiffs challenge, inter alia, DHS‘s change in interpretation of the TPS statute (a \nCfi\n tclaC 14  general procedural issue), not an individual determination.14  The Department‘s general \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  interpretation of the TPS statute is a question distinct from the Department‘s designation or \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  termination of a particular country‘s TPS status.   \nS d nr\nee 17  Contrary to Defendants‘ argument, the statute‘s reference to ―any determination‖ does not \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  subsume ―any‖ general policies or practices.  Rather, the word ―any‖ must be understood in its \n19  grammatical context: ―any determination . . . with respect to the designation, or termination or \n20 \n                                                 \n21 \n13  The Supreme Court then determined that several plaintiffs‘ claims may not be ripe because they \n22  had not yet applied for and been denied adjustment of status under the regulation they challenged.  \nDefendants do not challenge the ripeness of Plaintiffs‘ claims in this case.  Moreover, no such \n23  problem appears.  In CSS, the plaintiffs were unlawfully present in the United States and would \nnot be affected by the problematic regulation unless they applied for adjustment of status and then \n24  were denied on the basis of the challenged regulation (rather than on other grounds).  In contrast, \nhere, Plaintiffs and others similarly situated have permission to remain in the United States and \n25  Defendants‘ actions will, if undisturbed, strip them of that status.   \n \n26  14  See also Immigrant Assistance Project of AFL-CIO v. I.N.S., 306 F.3d 842, 862-63 (9th Cir. \n2002) (applying McNary to hold that a statute depriving aliens applying for amnesty of ―judicial \n27  review of a determination respecting an application for adjustment‖ did not preclude district court \njurisdiction over the plaintiffs‘ ―procedural rather than substantive‖ challenge); Proyecto San \n28 \nPablo v. I.N.S., 189 F.3d 1130, 1138-41 (9th Cir. 1999) (same).   \n18 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 19 of 57\n \n1  extension of a designation, of a foreign state.‖  8 U.S.C. § 1254a(b)(5)(A) (emphasis added).  See \n2  Small v. U.S., 544 U.S. 385, 388 (2005) (holding that statutory phrase ―convicted in any court‖ did \n3  not include foreign courts); U.S. v. Alvarez-Sanchez, 511 U.S. 350, 357 (1994) (holding that \n4  ―respondent errs in placing dispositive weight on the broad statutory reference to ‗any‘ law \n5  enforcement officer or agency without considering the rest of the statute‖).  In context, ―any \n6  determination‖ means the determination to designate, the determination to terminate, and the \n7  determination to extend a designation.  ―Any‖ modifies but does not define ―determinations.‖ \n8  The government cites a House Judiciary Committee report which states that ―none of the \n9  [Secretary‘s] decisions with regard to granting, extending, or terminating TPS will be subject to \n10  judicial review,‖ H.R. Rep. No. 101-245 (1989), at 14.  That citation is inapt for two reasons.  \n11  First, this committee report concerns the ―Chinese Temporary Protected Status Act of 1989,‖ \n12  House Resolution 2929 (101st Congress), which was never passed.  Although the judicial review \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  provision in that proposed legislation is similar to the language ultimately included in the general \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  TPS statute passed and codified at 8 U.S.C § 1254a, the latter was part of the Immigration Act of \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  1990, Pub. L. No. 101-649, Nov. 29, 1990.  Defendants have not identified other relevant \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  legislative history pertaining to the legislation actually passed by Congress.  In any case, the \nS d nr\nee 17  language cited in this committee report would not provide additional guidance even if it pertained \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  to the TPS statute at issue here.  It merely echoes the language of the statute, using the word \n19  ―decisions‖ instead of ―determinations.‖  That is not clear and convincing evidence of \n20  Congressional intent to strip jurisdiction of the courts to review generally applicable policies and \n21  practices which transcend individual TPS determination for a particular country. \n22  Finally, the fact that Plaintiffs‘ challenge might result in vacating the four TPS \n23  determinations at issue in this case is not dispositive to the interpretation question at hand.  The \n24  same was true in McNary and CSS; both had the effect of vacating individual determinations and \n25  requiring the agency to re-consider them after correcting procedural deficiencies and applying the \n26  correct legal standard.  Similarly, if Plaintiffs prevail here, Defendants would not be compelled to \n27  extend each country‘s TPS designation.  Instead, Defendants may make a new determination \n28  whether TPS should be extended or terminated once they correct any legal errors identified by the \n19 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 20 of 57\n \n1  Court.   \n2  2.  Section 1254a Does Not Preclude Colorable Constitutional Claims \n3  Plaintiffs‘ constitutional claims do challenge, inter alia, DHS‘s determinations to terminate \n4  each of the four country‘s TPS status on grounds that do not depend on DHS‘s general \n5  interpretation of the TPS statute.  For example, the U.S.-citizen children allege that Defendants‘ \n6  termination of their parents‘ TPS status violates their substantive due process rights because \n7  ―Defendants have articulated no substantial governmental interest and have failed to adequately \n8  tailor their action to promote any legitimate interest they may have,‖ and the TPS termination \n9  notices do not ―identif[y] any risk to the interests of the United States that would follow from \n10  allowing the school-aged U.S. citizen children to remain in the United States with their TPS holder \n11  parents until the children reach the age of majority.‖  Compl. ¶ 105.  Similarly, Plaintiffs‘ equal \n12  protection claim alleges that ―Defendants‘ decisions to terminate the TPS designations for El \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Sudan are unconstitutional because they were motivated, at least \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  in part, by intentional discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or national origin.‖  Compl. ¶ 110.  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Finally, the TPS-holder Plaintiffs allege that their due process rights have been violated because \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  ―[t]he government also has not articulated, and cannot establish, any rational basis for . . . ignoring \nS d nr\nee 17  the current capability of TPS countries to safely receive longtime TPS holders, their families, and \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  their U.S. citizen children.‖  Compl. ¶ 115.   \n19  These challenges are not collateral challenges to broad policies.  Rather, they directly \n20  attack the determinations themselves.  Thus, McNary and Reno do not apply to these challenges.  \n21  Nevertheless, as noted above, ―where Congress intends to preclude judicial review of \n22  constitutional claims its intent to do so must be clear.‖  Webster, 486 U.S. at 603.  This \n23  ―heightened showing‖ is required ―in part to avoid the ‗serious constitutional question‘ that would \n24  arise if a federal statute were construed to deny any judicial forum for a colorable constitutional \n25  claim.‖  Id. (citation and quotation omitted).   \n26  Here, Plaintiffs argue that the phrase ―under this subsection‖ in Section 1254a(b)(5)(A) \n27  means that the provision does not preclude a legal claim arising under the Constitution or other \n28  statutes.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1254a(b)(5)(A) (―There is no judicial review of any determination of the \n20 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 21 of 57\n \n1  Attorney General . . . under this subsection.‖ (emphasis added)).  This argument is not persuasive.  \n2  Under Plaintiffs‘ interpretation, the statute only precludes a cause of action arising directly under § \n3  1254a; but there is no direct cause of action under § 1254a, so Plaintiffs‘ interpretation would \n4  render the phrase meaningless.  Rather, as the Government contends, ―under this subsection‖ is \n5  more reasonably read to describe the ―determinations‖ for which review is precluded, i.e., specific \n6  TPS determinations made by the Secretary under the statute.   \n7  However, there is no ―clear and convincing‖ evidence that Congress intended to preclude \n8  the Court from reviewing constitutional challenges of the nature alleged here.  Indeed, as Plaintiffs \n9  point out, where Congress otherwise intended to preclude review of all constitutional claims in the \n10  INA, it said so explicitly.  See 8 USC 1252(b)(9) (―Judicial review of all questions of law and fact, \n11  including interpretation and application of constitutional and statutory provisions, arising from \n12  any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien . . . shall be available only in judicial \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  review of a final order under this section.‖ (emphasis added)); see also McNary, 509 U.S. at 494.  \nCfi\n tclaC 14  Such a clear expression of intent is absent in the TPS statute.15  Constitutional concerns counsel \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  for a narrow interpretation of jurisdiction-limiting statutes.  Thus, absent clear evidence of \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Congressional intent, the jurisdiction-stripping provision should be construed to preclude review \nS d nr\nee 17  only of claims challenging a determination for reasons that are ―closely tied to the application and \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  interpretation of statutes‖ which are committed by statute to the Secretary‘s discretion.  See \n19  Cuozzo, 136 S.Ct. at 2141-42 (holding that lawsuit challenging U.S. Patent and Trademark \n20  Office‘s decision to institute inter partes review based on the alleged insufficiency of the petition \n21 \n                                                 \n15  The government cites only one case to support its interpretation that § 1254a precludes review \n22 \nof constitutional claims, Krua v. U.S. Dept. of Homeland Sec., 729 F.Supp.2d 452, 455 (D. Mass. \n2010) (holding that pro se Liberian national‘s claim that Secretary‘s TPS designation violated the \n23 \nequal protection guarantee because it arbitrarily distinguished between Libyans present in the U.S. \nbefore and after Oct. 1, 2002 was precluded from review).  The Krua court did not undertake a \n24 \nreasoned analysis in construing Section 1254a‘s jurisdiction-stripping provision so is not \npersuasive.  In any event, it is not necessarily inconsistent with the Court‘s holding.  Arguably, the \n25 \nSecretary‘s decision with respect to eligibility cut-off dates for TPS protection is ―closely related‖ \nto administration of the TPS statute and therefore unreviewable under Cuozzo.  See 8 U.S.C. \n26 \n§ 1254a(b)(2)(A) (TPS designation of a foreign state ―take[s] effect upon the date of \npublication . . . or such later date as the Attorney General may specify‖).  Thus, the plaintiff‘s \n27 \nequal protection challenge based on the differential treatment of Liberians arriving before and \nafter a particular cut-off date established by law could be precluded.  In contrast, Congress did not \n28 \ncharge the Secretary with making termination decisions on the basis of racial animus.  \n21 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 22 of 57\n \n1  for review was precluded by jurisdiction-stripping statute, but expressly holding that ―we do not \n2  categorically preclude review of a final decision where  . . . there is a due process problem with the \n3  entire proceeding, nor does our interpretation enable the agency to act outside its statutory limits‖).   \n4  Applying that principle here, Section 1254a does not reflect a clear Congressional intent to \n5  preclude this Court from reviewing Plaintiffs‘ constitutional challenges to the Secretary‘s \n6  determinations.  The substance of Plaintiffs‘ constitutional challenges is far afield of fact-based \n7  criteria that are ―closely tied‖ to administration of the TPS statute.  While the Secretary‘s \n8  evaluation of particular facts based on statutory criteria under 8 U.S.C. § 1254a(b)(1)(A)-(C) may \n9  be ―closely tied to the application and interpretation of statutes related to‖ the Secretary‘s \n10  decisions, ascertaining whether the decision is driven by unconstitutional racial animus is not.  \n11  Nor is the purely legal question regarding the scope of a person‘s substantive due process interests \n12  against removal (i.e., how to balance an individual‘s interests with the Government‘s interests).  \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Unlike, e.g., a challenge to the Secretary‘s determination to terminate TPS for a particular country \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  being allegedly arbitrary because the country is not in fact safe, the constitutional claims at issue \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  here do not focus on the factual accuracy of the Secretary‘s evaluation of specific country \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  conditions, an evaluation which Section 1254a was intended to insulate.  Instead, these \nS d nr\nee 17  constitutional challenges are predicated on facts outside the considerations prescribed (and \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  committed to the Secretary‘s evaluation) by the TPS statute.   \n19  Defendants argue that the Webster presumption in favor of judicial review of colorable \n20  constitutional claims does not apply here because Congress did not preclude all judicial review but \n21  ―simply channel[ed] review of a constitutional claim to a particular court.‖  Elgin v. Dept. of \n22  Treasury, 567 U.S. 1, 9 (2012).16  Defendants‘ argument rests on the assumption that an alien \n23 \n                                                 \n16  In its Reply brief, the Government cites the plurality opinion in Patchak v. Zinke, 138 S. Ct. \n24 \n897 (2018).  In that case, the plaintiff sued the Secretary of the Interior for taking land into trust on \nbehalf of an Indian tribe; after the suit was instituted, Congress passed a statute stripping the \n25 \ndistrict courts of jurisdiction over lawsuits relating to the land.  Id. at 902.  The plaintiff argued \nthat Congress violated Article III of the Constitution by improperly directing the results of \n26 \npending litigation.  Id. at 904.  The Supreme Court explained that ―Congress violates Article III \nwhen it ‗compel[s] . . . findings or results under old law,‘‖ but not ―when it ‗changes the law.‘‖  \n27 \nId. at 905 (citations omitted, alteration in original).  The court interpreted the new statute stripping \njurisdiction as a change in law that was not problematic.  In so doing, the court explained that \n28 \n―Congress generally does not infringe the judicial power when it strips jurisdiction because, with \n22 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 23 of 57\n \n1  ordered removed may seek judicial review in the context of removal proceedings of constitutional \n2  claims challenging termination of a country‘s TPS status under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D).17  The \n3  argument is flawed for several reasons.   \n4  First, Defendants do not concede that review of constitutional claims through those \n5  procedures would be available to aliens ordered removed:  Defendants therefore seem to doubt \n6  their own premise.   \n7  Second, the TPS statute was passed in 1990; the TPS statute did not purport to ―channel‖ \n8  review of constitutional claims arising out of TPS country determinations to a particular forum.  \n9  Congress did not create the judicial review provisions of 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D) until a decade \n10  later, when it passed the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub. L. 109-13, in response to the Supreme \n11  Court‘s decision in INS v. St. Cyr., 533 U.S. 289 (2001).  The Act eliminated district court habeas \n12  jurisdiction over orders of removal‖ and ―addressed Suspension Clause concerns raised in St. Cyr. \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  by allowing (i.e., reinstating) review in courts of appeal of final removal orders of aggravated \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  felons for ‗constitutional claims or questions of law.‘‖  Iasu v. Smith, 511 F.3d 881, 886 (9th Cir. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  2007) (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D)).  The REAL ID Act reflects Congress‘s intent to \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  channel constitutional challenges to a removal order; it does not reflect a Congressional purpose \nS d nr\nee 17  to circumvent constitutional challenges to TPS country determinations; nor was it intended to limit \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  challenges brought by a person who is not facing removal (e.g., a U.S.-citizen).   \n19  Third, U.S.-citizen children cannot seek judicial review through that process because they \n20  are not aliens who would be ordered removed; Congress therefore could not have intended to \n21  channel their claims to appeals from a removal proceeding.   \n22  Finally, even for aliens ordered removed, judicial review in removal proceedings would be \n23 \n                                                                                                                                                                \nlimited exceptions, a congressional grant of jurisdiction is a prerequisite to the exercise of judicial \n24 \npower.‖  Id. at 907.  The plurality opinion‘s language is inapposite because, as explained above, \nCongress has not clearly expressed its intent to strip the Court of jurisdiction over Plaintiffs‘ \n25 \nclaims here.  Thus, the question whether Congress could strip the district court of jurisdiction over \nconstitutional claims is not necessarily at issue here. \n26 \n \n17  See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D) (providing that ―[n]othing . . . in any other provision of this \n27 \nchapter . . . which limits or eliminates judicial review, shall be construed as precluding review of \nconstitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review [of a final order of \n28 \nremoval] filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section‖).   \n23 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 24 of 57\n \n1  ineffective because it would be limited to ―the administrative record on which the order of \n2  removal is based.‖  See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(A).  Plaintiffs would not have an opportunity to \n3  develop a record regarding their constitutional claims to support review.   \n4  For these reasons, Congress has not clearly indicated an intent to preclude jurisdiction over \n5  colorable constitutional challenges related to TPS determinations. \n6  B.  Motion to Dismiss \n7  Plaintiffs bring four claims.  First, they allege that Defendants‘ adoption of a new \n8  interpretation of the TPS statute violates the Administrative Procedure Act insofar as it departed \n9  sub silentio from a past practice (Count Four).  Second, Plaintiffs bring two separate due process \n10  claims on behalf of the TPS-holding parents and the U.S.-citizen children on the basis that \n11  Defendants have not advanced a sufficient rationale to justify infringing on their protected liberty \n12  and/or property interests (Counts One and Three).  Finally, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants‘ \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  termination of TPS violates the equal protection guarantee of the Due Process Clause because it \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  was motivated, at least in part, by racial or national-origin animus.  The Court analyzes each claim \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  on which Defendants seek dismissal substantively under Rule 12(b)(6). \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  1.  APA Claim (Count Four) \nS d nr\nee 17  a.  Legal Standard \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Under the APA, agency action may be set aside if it is arbitrary or capricious.  See 5 \n19  U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  Under this standard, an agency must ―examine the relevant data and \n20  articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action.‖  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, \n21  Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  But ―a court is not to \n22  substitute its judgment for that of the agency‖ and ―should uphold a decision of less than ideal \n23  clarity if the agency‘s path may reasonably be discerned.‖  F.C.C. v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., \n24  556 U.S. 502, 513-14 (2009) (citation and quotation omitted).   \n25  The APA constrains an agency‘s ability to change its practices or policies without \n26  acknowledging the change or providing an explanation.  ―[T]he requirement that an agency \n27  provide reasoned explanation for its action would ordinarily demand that [an agency] display \n28  awareness that it is changing position.‖  Id. at 515 (emphasis in original).  Thus, agencies ―may \n24 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 25 of 57\n \n1  not . . . depart from a prior policy sub silentio or simply disregard rules that are still on the books,‖ \n2  and ―must show that there are good reasons for the new policy.‖  Id. (emphasis in original).  An \n3  agency need not demonstrate that ―the reasons for the new policy are better than the reasons for \n4  the old one; it suffices that the new policy is permissible under the statute, that there are good \n5  reasons for it, and that the agency believes it to be better, which the conscious change of course \n6  adequately indicates.‖  Id. (emphasis in original). \n7  This constraint on changes to agency policy is not limited to formal rules or official \n8  policies.  It applies to practices implied from the agency conduct.  For example, in California \n9  Trout v. F.E.R.C., 572 F.3d 1003 (9th Cir. 2009), the plaintiffs challenged the Federal Energy \n10  Regulatory Commission‘s (FERC) denial of their untimely attempt to intervene in a proceeding \n11  concerning the renewal of an operating license for a dam and power plant.  In essence, the \n12  plaintiffs argued that FERC‘s decision to grant late intervention requests in three prior \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  adjudications had given rise to an implicit rule that FERC would always grant late requests in \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  certain circumstances, and that FERC was required to offer a reasoned explanation before \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  abandoning that practice.  Although it ultimately held against the plaintiffs, the Ninth Circuit \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  agreed that the alleged change in adjudicative practice was subject to the APA‘s requirements for \nS d nr\nee 17  reasoned decision-making.  It explained that ―while an agency may announce new principles in an \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  adjudicatory proceeding, it may not depart, sub silentio, from its usual rules of decision to reach a \n19  different, unexplained result in a single case.‖  Id. at 1022(quotation and citation omitted)).  \n20  Rather, ―‗if [an agency] announces and follows—by rule or by settled course of adjudication—a \n21  general policy by which its exercise of discretion will be governed, an irrational departure from \n22  that policy (as opposed to an avowed alteration of it) could constitute action that must be \n23  overturned as ‗arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion‘ within the meaning of the \n24  Administrative Procedure Act.‘‖  Id. at 1023 (quoting INS v. Yueh-Shaio Yang, 519 U.S. 26, 32 \n25  (1996)) (emphasis added, alteration in original).  The court proceeded to consider the claim on the \n26  merits and held that the agency‘s prior decisions had not ―establish[ed] a broad principle that the \n27  Commission will allow untimely intervention.‖  Id. at 1024. \n28  Thus, California Trout establishes that a shift in agency practice (as opposed to a formal \n25 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 26 of 57\n \n1  rule or policy) is also reviewable under the APA.  Courts have also looked, in part, to whether an \n2  agency‘s past practice evinces the existence of an implicit rule or policy.  See, e.g., Northwest Env. \n3  Def. Ctr. v. Bonneville Power Admin., 477 F.3d 668 (9th Cir. 2007) (holding that BPA‘s decision \n4  to stop funding Fish Passage Center and to divert its responsibilities to two other entities after \n5  nearly two decades was arbitrary and capricious where no reasoned explanation was provided); \n6  Am. Wild Horse Pres. Campaign v. Perdue, 873 F.3d 914, 927 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (after \n7  ―longstanding practice‖ of treating certain land as if it were part of the Wild Horse Territory, \n8  agency‘s unexplained change in practice was arbitrary-and-capricious, particularly where it \n9  ―fail[ed] even to acknowledge its past practice . . . let alone to explain its reversal of course in the \n10  2013 decision‖).   \n11  b.  Plaintiffs Plausibly Allege a Change in Practice or Policy \n12  Plaintiffs allege that to justify the termination of TPS for El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  and Sudan, ―DHS has adopted a novel interpretation of the TPS statute.  Under prior \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  administrations, DHS or its predecessors considered intervening natural disasters, conflicts, and \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  other serious and social economic problems as relevant factors when deciding whether to continue \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  or instead terminate a TPS designation. . . .  [T]he Trump administration‘s DHS has now taken the \nS d nr\nee 17  position that such factors cannot be considered.‖  Compl. ¶ 75.  Plaintiffs more specifically cite \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  former Secretary Kelly‘s June 6, 2017 Senate testimony that ―the [TPS] program  is for a specific \n19  event.  In – in Haiti, it was the earthquake.  Yes, Haiti had horrible conditions before the \n20  earthquake, and those conditions aren‘t much better after the earthquake.  But the earthquake was \n21  why TPS was – was granted and – and that‘s how I have to look at it.‖  Compl. ¶ 76.  \n22  Additionally, as noted above, Secretary Nielsen later stated that ―[t]he law does not allow me to \n23  look at the country conditions of a country writ large.  It requires me to look very specifically as to \n24  whether the country conditions originating from the original designation continue to exist.‖  Id. ¶ \n25  77.  Plaintiffs also cite three press releases issued by DHS with respect to TPS for El Salvador, \n26  Haiti, Nicaragua, and Honduras where the Secretary stated that she compared ―the conditions upon \n27  which the country‘s original designation was based‖ with ―an assessment of whether those \n28  originating conditions continue to exist.‖  Id. ¶ 78. \n26 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 27 of 57\n \n1  Defendants argue that a facial comparison between the termination notices here and prior \n2  notices shows that they are in fact consistent, not that any radical change has occurred.  Indeed, to \n3  state a claim, Plaintiffs must plausibly allege not only that Defendants considered only the \n4  ―originating conditions‖ in terminating TPS here, but also that Defendants‘ prior practice was to \n5  the contrary.  They have done so here.  Prior to October 2017, extension and/or re-designation \n6  notices indicate that DHS consistently considered, at the very least, whether intervening events \n7  had frustrated or impeded recovery efforts from the originating conditions in Sudan, Haiti, \n8  Nicaragua, and El Salvador.  For example, in notices regarding Sudan, DHS emphasized both the \n9  persistence of the armed conflict prompting the original designation and consequential problems \n10  beyond the conflict itself, which together prevented the safe return of Sudanese nationals.18  The \n11 \n                                                 \n12 \na  18  Sudan:  \ntruo inro 13    Extension and Redesignation of Sudan Under the Temporary Protected Status Program, \nCfi 64 FR 61128-01, 1999 WL 1008419 (Nov. 9, 1999) (finding that the armed conflict is \n tla ongoing and extraordinary and temporary conditions continue to exist);  \ncC 14 \nirts fo   Extension of Designation of Sudan Under the Temporary Protected Status Program, 65 \niD tc 15  Fed.

plausibility of Plaintiffs‘ allegation of a shift from past \n24 \npractice or policy.  For every country (although to varying degrees), factors that were explicitly \n25 \nconsidered recently by prior administrations were wholly absent from the four termination notices \n26 \nissued between October 2017 and January 2018.  That supports a plausible inference, corroborated \n27 \nby the statements of former Secretary Kelly and Secretary Nielsen, that Defendants changed their \n28 \ninterpretation of the TPS statute so as to focus solely (or nearly solely) on the originating \n32 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 33 of 57\n \n1  condition without considering intervening events in making TPS determinations. \n2  There are only two exceptions to this observation.  First, Haiti‘s designation was extended \n3  once by former Secretary Kelly under the current administration.  See Extension of the \n4  Designation of Haiti for Temporary Protected Status, 82 Fed. Reg. 23,830-01 (May 24, 2017).  \n5  This does not undermine Plaintiffs‘ allegations that the change in policy occurred recently.  \n6  Indeed, a comparison between Secretary Kelly‘s extension and Acting Secretary Duke‘s \n7  termination six months later supports an inference of an intervening change in policy or practice: \n8  although Secretary Kelly explicitly considered intervening events like Hurricane Matthew in \n9  October 2016 and heavy rains in late April 2017, Acting Secretary Duke did not.   \n10  Second, arguably the termination notice for Sudan touches, albeit indirectly and with much \n11  less specificity, on nearly all of the themes discussed in the most recent extension notice.  \n12  However, that does not undermine the plausibility that Defendants at some point adopted a new \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  rule or policy as indicated by the discrepancies between the notices for El Salvador, Haiti, and \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Nicaragua.  The arguably more complete discussion with respect to Sudan does not defeat the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  viability of Plaintiffs‘ APA claim challenging the change in practice itself; at most, it might affect \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  the scope of Plaintiffs‘ remedy if, for example, the new rule or policy was not instituted until after \nS de nre 17  Sudan‘s termination.23   \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Finally, Defendants argue that prior administrations have terminated TPS despite ongoing \n19  problems in the designated countries.  That fact is not dispositive to the case at bar.  The question \n20  is whether those ongoing problems were considered when the termination decision was made.  \n21 \n                                                 \n22 \n23  The Government cited the example of Montserrat, which was initially designated for TPS based \non a volcanic eruption in 1997, see 62 Fed. Reg. 45686 (Aug. 28, 1997), and then re-designated \n23 \nsix times, see  63 Fed. Reg. 45864 (Aug. 27, 1998); 64 Fed. Reg. 48190 (Sep. 2, 1999); 65 Fed. \nReg. 58806 (Oct. 2, 2000); 66 Fed. Reg. 40834 (Aug. 3, 2001); 67 Fed. Reg. 47002 (Jul. 17, \n24 \n2002); 68 Fed. Reg. 39106 (Jul. 1, 2003).  However, its TPS designation was eventually \nterminated in 2004 because ―the volcanic eruptions can no longer be considered temporary in \n25 \nnature‖ based on scientists‘ position that such eruptions ―generally last 20 years, but the volcano \ncould continue to erupt sporadically for decades.‖  See Termination of the Designation of \n26 \nMontserrat Under the Temporary Protected Status Program, 69 Fed. Reg. 40642-01 (Jul. 6, \n2004).  This example is inapposite, however, because the termination notice reflected a judgment \n27 \nthat the originating condition was not ―temporary.‖  Defendants‘ terminations of TPS for Haiti, \nSudan, El Salvador, and Nicaragua are not based on such a finding; rather, they are based on the \n28 \nnotion that the originating condition has abated. \n33 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 34 of 57\n \n1  The notices confirm Plaintiffs‘ assertion that under the prior practice, intervening events were at \n2  least considered.24   \n3  In sum, Plaintiffs‘ allegations and a facial review of the termination notices support a \n4  plausible inference that Defendants have adopted a new policy or practice without any explanation \n5  for the change.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs have stated a claim under the APA, and thus Defendants‘ \n6  motion to dismiss the APA claim is DENIED. \n7  2.  U.S. Citizens‘ Children‘s Due Process Claim to Family Integrity (Count One) \n8  The U.S.-citizen children  assert that Defendants have not ―articulated [a] substantial \n9  governmental interest‖ to justify intruding on their right to live in the United States, to live with \n10  their parents, and against being forced to make a choice between the two, thus violating their \n11  substantive due process rights.  See Compl. ¶¶ 105-6.   \n12  ―The concept of ‗substantive due process‘ . . . forbids the government from depriving a \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  person of life, liberty, or property in such a way that ‗shocks the conscience‘ or ‗interferes with \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  rights implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.‘‖  Nunez v.

See U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark, \n12  169 U.S. 649 (1898) (confirming that children born in the U.S. are citizens under 14th \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Amendment and that, therefore, citizen could not be denied entry to the U.S.); Lee Sing Far v. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  U.S., 94 F.3 834, 836 (9th Cir. 1899) (a U.S. citizen has the ―right to land and remain in the United \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  States‖).25  These cases did not involve indirect pressures upon a citizen resulting from action \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  taken against others.  But Plaintiffs have not cited any cases addressing whether the government‘s \nS d nr\nee 17  application of such indirect pressure may constitute a violation of substantive due process, and if \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  so, under what circumstances. \n19  It is well-settled that children have a liberty interest in living with their parents.  See, e.g., \n20  Ching v. Mayorkas, 725 F.3d 1149, 1157 (9th Cir. 2013) (―The right to live with and not be \n21  separated from one‘s immediate family is a right that ranks high among the interests of the \n22  individual and that cannot be taken away without procedural due process.‖ (quotation omitted)).  \n23  However, Plaintiffs have not cited any case where this interest was deemed sufficient to prevent \n24  the enforcement of a legitimate immigration law to remove a person at the cost of family \n25 \n                                                 \n26 \n25  Nguyen v. I.N.S., 533 U.S. 53, 67 (2001) refers to ―the absolute right to enter [the United \nStates‘] borders,‖ but the Supreme Court was reviewing whether the state could condition \n27 \nacquisition of citizenship of persons born abroad depending on whether citizenship derived from a \nmother or father.  The court was not squarely confronted with government action frustrating the \n28 \nright to enter the United States.   \n35 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 36 of 57\n \n1  separation.26  The Government cites a litany of cases rejecting the notion that immigration \n2  enforcement resulting in family separation inherently violates a U.S. citizen‘s constitutional rights.  \n3  For instance, in Gebhardt v. Nielsen, 879 F.3d 980, 988 (9th Cir. 2018), the Ninth Circuit held that \n4  U.S. citizen‘s due process rights were not violated by denial non-citizen wife and her children‘s \n5  visa petitions based on his own sex offense because ―the generic right to live with family is ‗far \n6  removed‘ from the specific right to reside in the United States with non-citizen family members,‖ \n7  and holding that ―a fundamental right to reside in the United States with [one‘s] non-citizen \n8  relatives‖ ―would ―run[] headlong into Congress‘ plenary power over immigration.‖  See Morales-\n9  Izquierdo v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 600 F.3d 1076, 1091 (9th Cir. 2010) (holding that ―lawfully \n10  denying Morales adjustment of status does not violate any of his or his family‘s substantive rights \n11  protected by the Due Process Clause‖ even ―when the impact of our immigration laws is to scatter \n12  a family or to require some United States citizen children to move to another country with their \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  parent‖), overruled in part on other grounds by Garfias-Rodriguez v. Holder, 702 F.3d 504 (9th \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Cir. 2012) (en banc).  Cf. De Mercado v. Mukasey, 566 F.3d 810, 816 n.5 (9th Cir. 2009) (stating, \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  in dicta, that ―family unity‖ theory of due process in immigration context is ―implausible‖ because \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  ―no authority [has been identified] to suggest that the Constitution provides [alien petitioners] with \nS d nr\nee 17  a fundamental right to reside in the United States simply because other members of their family \nth\nintr\nUoN 18  are citizens or lawful permanent residents‖).27 \n19 \n                                                 \n26  Plaintiffs cite cases that merely hold that a U.S. citizen has a ―protected liberty interest in \n20 \nmarriage [that] gives rise to a right to constitutionally adequate procedures in the adjudication of \nher husband‘s visa application.‖  Bustamante v. Mukasey, 531 F.3d 1059, 1062 (9th Cir. 2008) \n21 \n(holding that U.S.-citizen spouse of Mexican national had liberty interest permitting her to \nchallenge denial of her husband‘s visa application, but it was limited to assuring that ―the reason \n22 \ngiven [for denial] is facially legitimate and bona fide‖); see also Cardenas v. U.S., 826 F.3d 1164, \n1170-72 (9th Cir. 2016).  But that liberty interest, cited to support a procedural due process claim, \n23 \ndid not overcome the government‘s interest in either case, so long as the government had \nidentified a facially valid and bona fide reason for denying the visa.   \n24 \n \n27  The Government has also cited out-of-circuit cases in accord.  See Payne-Barahona v. \n25 \nGonzales, 474 F.3d 1, 1-2 (1st Cir. 2007) (explaining that ―[t]he circuits that have addressed the \nconstitutional issue (under varying incarnations of the immigration laws and in varying procedural \n26 \npostures) have uniformly held that a parent‘s otherwise valid deportation does not violate a child‘s \nconstitutional right,‖ ―[n]or does deportation necessarily mean separation since the children could \n27 \nbe relocated during their minority‖); Ayala-Flores v. INS, 662 F.2d 444, 446 (6th Cir. 1981) (per \ncuriam) (same); Marin-Garcia v. Holder, 647 F.3d 666, 674 (7th Cir. 2011) (―If an alien could \n28 \navoid the consequences of unlawful entry in to the United States by having a child, it would create \n36 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 37 of 57\n \n1  Plaintiffs are correct that Gebhardt, Morales-Izquierdo, and De Mercado differ from the \n2  instant situation in three senses.  First, they involved persons who were removed or denied an \n3  immigration benefit based on criminal conduct, thus heightening the government‘s interest in \n4  removal.  Second, they involved persons seeking a permanent right to remain in the United States \n5  whereas Plaintiffs seek only temporary permission for their parents to reside until they reach \n6  adulthood.  Third, the children here have a stronger liberty interest because the countries to which \n7  they would be forced to return are allegedly unsafe.28  But these factors do not appear to have been \n8  material to the analysis in these cases.29  Accordingly, the government appears to have a \n9  persuasive argument. \n10  Plaintiffs also assert the ―unconstitutional choice‖ doctrine in advancing their due process \n11  claim.  See Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 394 (1968) (it is ―intolerable that one \n12  constitutional right should have to be surrendered in order to assert another‖).  However, while the \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Court recognizes that U.S.-citizen children Plaintiffs will face the difficult and unenviable choice \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  between living in the United States or abroad with their parents in a land they have never known, \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  the ―unconstitutional choice‖ doctrine appears inapt.  Virtually all of the cases that Plaintiffs have \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16                                                                                                                                                                  \nS d nr perverse incentives and undermine Congress‘s authority over immigration matters.‖). \nee 17 \ntinUhtro  28  The only case Plaintiffs cite alluding to dangerous conditions as a basis for a constitutional \nN 18 \nlimitation on removal, Martinez de Mendoza v. I.N.S., 567 F.2d 1222 (3d Cir. 1977), does not in \nfact go so far.  In de Mendoza, a Colombian mother with a U.S.-citizen child had been ordered \n19 \ndeported, but in her appellate petition identified new evidence that her and her daughter‘s safety \nmight be endangered if they were deported.  The court held, on statutory grounds specific to the \n20 \nstandard of review, that new material evidence required remand to the agency for reconsideration.  \nThe court merely hinted, in dicta, in a footnote, that if the allegations of physical danger ―are \n21 \ncorrect, they may well be sufficient to raise questions of the constitutionality of such deportation.‖  \nId. at 1225, n.8.  But Plaintiffs have not cited any case in the past 44 years that has relied on this \n22 \nfootnote to establish a constitutional rule against deportation in case of dangerous country \nconditions. \n23 \n \n29  Plaintiffs also cite Wang v. Reno, 81 F.3d 808 (9th Cir. 1996), but it is inapposite.  There, the \n24 \ngovernment had arranged for Wang to be paroled into the United States from China to give grand \njury testimony, which the government knew might have been procured through torture.  When \n25 \nWang arrived, he testified that Chinese authorities tortured him to obtain false testimony.  Wang \nwas decided under the state-created danger doctrine: because the government ―placed Wang in \n26 \ndanger of violating his own conscience and the federal perjury statute, or of facing torture and \npossible execution in China,‖ id. at 819, its own actions created the danger he sought to avoid by \n27 \nreturn to China.  Plaintiffs‘ allegations here are dissimilar.  They do not allege the government \ncreated a danger specific to Plaintiffs simply by granting temporary protective status to their \n28 \nparents. \n37 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 38 of 57\n \n1  cited arise in the criminal prosecution context,30 or in the immigration context on the narrow \n2  question of whether an alien‘s right to choose voluntary departure could be conditioned on \n3  abandonment of the right to judicial review.31  Plaintiffs have not cited a case where the forced \n4  choice doctrine was applied to prohibit the government from deporting a non-citizen parent from \n5  their U.S.-citizen child based solely on the asserted due process interest in family integrity; even \n6  though the due process interest was recognized in those cases, it was not sufficient to overcome \n7  the government‘s interests.  To hold that substantive due process bars deportation of parents could \n8  have the effect of circumventing the holdings in Gebhardt, Morales-Izquierdo, and De Mercado.   \n9  In any event, the nature of Plaintiffs‘ choice here is arguably different from \n10  ―unconstitutional choice‖ cases such as Simmons, Jackson, or Elian.  In those cases, by asserting \n11  one right, the individual necessarily extinguished the other.  Here, even if a U.S.-citizen child left \n12  the country to live with a parent, they would retain the right to return to and live in the U.S; they \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  would still be legally free to stay or leave.  It is not clear that the forced-choice doctrine would \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  extend to this situation, where the government is not forcing a person to irretrievably relinquish \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  one right in order to exercise another. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16                                                   \nS d nr 30  See Simmons, 390 U.S. at 394 (holding that criminal defendant‘s testimony to establish \nee 17 \ntinhtr standing to request exclusion of evidence under Fourth Amendment could not be admitted against \nUo him to demonstrate guilt without violating Fifth Amendment or else defendant is forced to \nN 18 \nabandon one right in favor of another); United States v.

Hayden, 387 U.S. 294 (1967).  Further, New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, \n25 \n176 (1992) (holding, inter alia, that legislation regulating disposal of radioactive waste exceeded \nCongress‘s enumerated powers insofar as it offered states a ―choice‖ between two unconstitutional \n26 \nalternatives), is inapposite, because it did not involve a forced choice between two constitutional \nrights but rather the validity of two unconstitutional conditions. \n27 \n \n31  See Elian v. Ashcroft, 370 F.3d 897, 900 (9th Cir. 2004); see also Contreras-Aragon v. I.N.S., \n28 \n852 F.2d 1088, 1094-95 (9th Cir. 1988). \n38 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 39 of 57\n \n1  The Court need not resolve these questions at this time, however.  See In re Snyder, 472 \n2  U.S. 634, 642 (1985) (―We avoid constitutional issues when resolution of such issues is not \n3  necessary for disposition of a case.‖).  If the challenged action by the Administration were \n4  otherwise illegitimate and unlawful, the deprivation of Plaintiffs‘ liberty interests in family \n5  integrity, even if typically insufficient to defeat the government‘s interest in enforcing valid \n6  immigration laws, may be unlawful where it is not be supported by a legitimate government \n7  interest.  Cf. Smith v. City of Fontana, 818 F.2d 1411, 1419-20 (9th Cir. 1987) (state had ―no \n8  legitimate interest in interfering with [protected] liberty interest [in familial relations] through the \n9  use of excessive force by police officers‖), overruled on other grounds, Hodgers-Durgin v. de la \n10  Vina, 199 F.3d 1037, 1040 n.1 (9th Cir. 1999); Diaz v.

Because Plaintiffs have adequately pled that \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Defendants‘ actions violate the APA and equal protection (as discussed below), Plaintiffs‘ due \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  process claim is sufficiently plausible to proceed at least on that basis.   \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  3.  TPS-Beneficiaries‘ Due Process Claim (Count Three) \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  The TPS-beneficiaries separately allege that, as persons lawfully present in the United \nS d nr\nee 17  States, they have a significant liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause in non-arbitrary \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  decisionmaking with respect to the continuation of TPS status.  See Compl. ¶¶ 113-15.  Plaintiffs \n19  assert that Defendants‘ termination decisions must at least pass a rationality test, and that ―[t]he \n20  government . . . has not articulated, and cannot establish, any rational basis for reversing course on \n21  decades of established TPS policy and ignoring the current capability of TPS countries to safely \n22  receive longtime TPS holders, their families, and their U.S. citizen children.‖  Compl. ¶ 115. \n23  Plaintiffs assert two bases for the liberty interest asserted here: a ―property‖ interest \n24  conferred by the TPS statute in remaining in the U.S. so long as their countries of origin are \n25  unsafe, and a liberty interest based on the right to live and work in the United States conferred by \n26  the TPS statute.  The Court analyzes each in turn. \n27  a.  Property Interest \n28  ―[A] person receiving . . . benefits under statutory and administrative standards defining \n39 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 40 of 57\n \n1  eligibility for them has an interest in continued receipt of those benefits.‖  Nozzi v. Hous. Auth., \n2  806 F.3d 1178, 1190-91 (9th Cir. 2015) (citation omitted).  A statute does not give a claim of \n3  entitlement, however, when availability of the benefit is entirely discretionary.  See Kwai Fun \n4  Wong v. United States, 373 F.3d 952, 967-68 (9th Cir. 2004) (no procedural or substantive due \n5  process interest in ―temporary parole status‖ where ―the statute makes clear that whether and for \n6  how long temporary parole is granted are matters entirely within the discretion of the Attorney \n7  General‖); Meachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215, 228 (1976) (holding that a prisoner has no due \n8  process interest against transfer from one prison to another within the same state system, but there \n9  was no statute purporting to grant him any entitlement to a particular prison).  To constitute a \n10  protected property interest, an individual must have ―more than an abstract need or desire‖ or \n11  ―unilateral expectation‖ for a benefit, but rather a ―legitimate claim of entitlement‖ based on, inter \n12  alia, ―existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law,‖ a \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  ―statute defining eligibility,‖ a contract ―creat[ing] and defin[ing]‖ certain terms, or some other \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  ―clearly implied promise.‖  See Bd. of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 576-78 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  (1972) (holding that public employee had no cognizable property interest in re-appointment for a \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  second term where contract did not provide for renewal).   \nS d nr\nee 17  Defendants contend that TPS designations are entirely discretionary and that Plaintiffs \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  therefore have no legitimate claim of entitlement protected by due process.  That is not entirely \n19  correct.  The Secretary is given broad discretion in deciding whether to make an initial TPS \n20  designation.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1254a(b)(1) (―The [Secretary], after consultation with appropriate \n21  agencies of the Government, may designate any foreign state . . . .‖ (emphasis added)).  An alien \n22  from an undesignated country therefore would not appear to have any legitimate entitlement to \n23  receive TPS status.   \n24  The same is not true with respect to extensions and terminations, however.  The statute \n25  provides that the Secretary ―shall‖ terminate TPS status only if the Secretary ―determines . . . that \n26  a foreign state . . . no longer continues to meet the conditions for designation under paragraph (1).‖  \n27  8 U.S.C. § 1254a(b)(3)(B).  If the Secretary does not make that determination, then ―the period of \n28  designation of the foreign state is extended for an additional period.‖  Id. § 1254a(b)(3)(C).  That \n40 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 41 of 57\n \n1  Plaintiffs are entitled to continue receiving benefits until the Secretary makes the determination to \n2  terminate pursuant to the process and criteria set forth in the statute brings this case closer to Nozzi \n3  than Wong and Meachum.   \n4  To be sure, Plaintiffs‘ statutory entitlement is narrower than they suggest.  The statute does \n5  not guarantee that a country will continue to be designated for TPS so long as its conditions in fact \n6  warrant.  Rather, it merely provides that the Secretary ―shall review the conditions . . . and shall \n7  determine whether the conditions for such designation under this subsection continue to be met.‖  \n8  8 U.S.C. § 1254a(b)(3)(A) (emphasis added).  Because Plaintiffs‘ ―reasonable expectation of \n9  entitlement is determined largely by the language of the statute,‖ Wedges/Ledges of Cal., Inc. v. \n10  City of Phoenix, Ariz., 24 F.3d 56, 62 (9th Cir. 1994) (citation omitted), they can expect no more \n11  than the statutorily-mandated ―review‖ and ―determin[ation].‖  And, as explained above, the Court \n12  generally may not review the Secretary‘s factual evaluation of country conditions.  Nevertheless, \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  if the Secretary‘s determination is unlawful for other reasons, Plaintiffs may state a due process \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  claim.  Plaintiffs arguably have a property interest in loss of TPS status, a loss which may not be \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  justified by an unlawful government interest.  Accordingly, to the extent Plaintiffs‘ challenge is \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  based on a property-entitlement theory, they have at least a plausible claim co-extensive with their \nS d nr\nee 17  ability to prove that Defendants violated the APA or equal protection guarantee.   \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  b.  Liberty Interest \n19  Plaintiffs‘ also assert a liberty interest arising from the fact that the TPS statute permits \n20  them to live and work in this country.  Cf. Bridges v. Wixon, 326 U.S. 135, 154 (1945) (observing \n21  that deportation ―visits a great hardship on the individual and deprives him of the right to stay and \n22  live and work in this land of freedom‖).   \n23  The Court is doubtful whether Plaintiffs can state such a viable due process claim absent \n24  Defendants‘ violation of the APA or Equal Protection.  In essence, Plaintiffs claim that although \n25  the protection they received was ―temporary‖ in name, it became ―permanent‖ or ―long-term‖ in \n26  actual administration and practice and thus gave rise to important interests protected by due \n27  process.  Cf. Woodby v. I.N.S., 385 U.S. 276 (1966) (highlighting ―the drastic deprivations that \n28  may follow when a resident of this country is compelled by our Government to forsake all the \n41 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 42 of 57\n \n1  bonds formed here and go to a foreign land where he often has no contemporary identification,‖ \n2  and noting that ―many resident aliens have lived in this country longer and established stronger \n3  family, social, and economic ties here than some who have been naturalized citizens‖).  But this \n4  theory ignores the explicitly temporary nature of the TPS status. \n5  Moreover, Plaintiffs‘ theory, if credited, could undermine the purpose of the TPS statute \n6  by deterring this and future administrations from designating and extending TPS designations in \n7  order to avoid giving rise to a permanent due process defense against removal.  And it could have \n8  implications for other nominally temporary immigration statuses, such as student, H-1 and H-2 \n9  visa holders, if the status is extended long enough for the alien to form the types of ties and \n10  interests alleged here.  These possible consequences, which in effect could result in a new, \n11  judicially-crafted immigration status, might be a reason warranting ―reluctan[ce] to expand the \n12  concept of substantive due process.‖  Washington, 521 U.S. at 720 (quotation and citation \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  omitted).   \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  While the Court is dubious about whether Plaintiffs‘ asserted due process liberty interest \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  can overcome the government‘s interest in enforcing an otherwise valid immigration law, the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Court need not resolve the question at this time because Plaintiffs have stated a plausible due \nS d nr\nee 17  process claim at least to the extent that Defendants‘ termination also violated the APA and/or the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  equal protection guarantee for the same reasons stated above.   \n19  4.  Equal Protection Claim (Count Two)  \n20  Plaintiffs allege that both:  (1) the decision to terminate TPS for Haiti, Nicaragua, El \n21  Salvador, and Sudan, and (2) Defendants‘ alleged change in rule, were motivated by racial animus.  \n22  Defendants do not deny that President Trump‘s alleged statements evidence racial animus; rather, \n23  they argue the President‘s animus is irrelevant because the Secretary of Homeland Security, not \n24  the President, terminated TPS for Sudan, Haiti, Nicaragua, and El Salvador.  Defendants also \n25  argue that in order to state an equal protection claim, Plaintiffs must allege the existence of a \n26  similarly situated class of people who were treated more favorably for no rational reason.  Finally, \n27  Defendants contend that even if Plaintiffs are not required to allege the existence of a comparator \n28  group, the Secretary‘s decisions with regard to TPS are subject only to a highly deferential form of \n42 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 43 of 57\n \n1  rational basis review, rather than strict scrutiny.    \n2  After the Court had already issued its order denying the motion to dismiss the equal \n3  protection claim ruling, see Docket No. 34, the Supreme Court handed down its decision in Trump \n4  v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. ___ (2018).  This Court thereafter invited supplemental briefing whether to \n5  reconsider its earlier holding.  For the reasons stated herein, the Court affirms its denial of the \n6  motion. \n7  The Court first analyzes whether the President‘s animus is attributable to the Secretary.  \n8  Then, the Court decides whether a comparator group need be alleged.  Next, the Court discusses \n9  whether Trump v. Hawaii alters the legal standard or outcome in this case.  Finally, the Court \n10  examines whether Plaintiffs‘ allegations plausibly state a claim under the correct legal standard. \n11  a.  President Trump‘s Alleged Animus is Attributable to the Secretary of \n12  Homeland Security \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Plaintiffs concede that they have not alleged direct evidence of animus by Acting Secretary \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Duke or Secretary Nielsen.  Defendants claim that this failure is dispositive, notwithstanding \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  President Trump‘s alleged animus. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Defendants are incorrect.  Even if Acting Secretary Duke and Secretary Nielsen do not \nS d nr\nee 17  personally harbor animus towards TPS-beneficiaries from Haiti, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Sudan, their actions may violate the equal protection guarantee if President Trump‘s alleged \n19  animus influenced or manipulated their decisionmaking process.  For example, in Poland v. \n20  Chertoff, 494 F.3d 1174 (9th Cir. 2007), the Ninth Circuit permitted the animus of a subordinate \n21  employee to be imputed to his employer, announcing a general holding that ―if a subordinate . . . \n22  sets in motion a proceeding by an independent decisionmaker that leads to an adverse employment \n23  action, the subordinate‘s bias is imputed to the employer if the plaintiff can prove that the \n24  allegedly independent adverse employment decision was not actually independent because the \n25  biased subordinate influenced or was involved in the decision or decisionmaking process.‖  Id. at \n26  1182.  Similarly, in Avenue 6E Investments, LLC v. City of Yuma, Ariz., 818 F.3d 493 (9th Cir. \n27  2016), in considering an allegation that a city discriminated against a group of developers to please \n28  constituents who had expressed racial animus, the Ninth Circuit held that ―[t]he presence of \n43 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 44 of 57\n \n1  community animus can support a finding of discriminatory motives by government officials, even \n2  if the officials do not personally hold such views.‖  Id. at 504.   \n3  There is no logical reason why this principle should not apply with equal force when the \n4  superior entity or authority (here, the President) influences a subordinate (here, a cabinet member) \n5  to perform an action charged to the latter.  See Batalla-Vidal, 291 F.Supp.3d at 279 (holding that \n6  ―[i]f, as Plaintiffs allege, President Trump himself directed the end of the DACA program, it \n7  would be surprising if his ‗discriminatory intent [could] effectively be laundered by being \n8  implemented by an agency under his control‘‖).  The central question, simply put, is whether the \n9  challenged decision was infected by the tainted influence. \n10  Defendants appear to concede that the White House was involved in the termination \n11  decisions, Reply at 9 (―Of course something of this nature would involve the White House . . .‖), \n12  so they do not necessarily reject this ―cats‘ paw‖ theory of animus in principle.  Instead, they \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  argue that the White House‘s involvement ―does not mean that Secretaries Duke and Nielsen did \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  not independently consider the evidence before them in making their decisions.‖  Id.  Even if that \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  were the case, however, ―[i]f there are two alternative explanations, one advanced by defendant \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  and the other advanced by plaintiff, both of  which are plausible, plaintiff‘s complaint survives a \nS d nr\nee 17  motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).‖  Starr, 625 F.3d at 1216.  Here, the claim of President \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Trump‘s influence is plausible; as explained in more detail below, for example, President Trump \n19  described Haiti as a ―shithole‖ in a meeting with Secretary Nielsen where he expressed desire not \n20  to welcome Haitians in the United States, just days before DHS announced it would terminate \n21  Haiti‘s status.  See Compl. ¶¶ 66, 720, 72, 81, 84.  Whether President Trump‘s animus altered the \n22  outcome of DHS‘s independent decisionmaking process is a question of fact to be resolved in this \n23  litigation.   \n24  b.  Under Arlington Heights, Plaintiffs Need Not Rely on a Comparator Group \n25  and May Rely Instead on Direct Evidence of Discriminatory Intent \n26  Plaintiffs bring their claim under Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., \n27  429 U.S. 252 (1977).  Under Arlington Heights, government action may violate equal protection if \n28  a discriminatory purpose was one motivating factor.  Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 265-66.  \n44 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 45 of 57\n \n1  Under this standard, the Court may look behind the stated reasons for government action to other \n2  circumstantial evidence to find evidence of discriminatory purpose, such as: \n3    a decision‘s historical background ―if it reveals a series of official actions taken for \n4  invidious purposes;‖  \n5    ―[t]he specific sequence of events leading up [to] the challenged decision;‖  \n6    ―[d]epartures from the normal procedural sequence;‖  \n7    ―[s]ubstantive departures . . . particularly if the factors usually considered important \n8  by the decisionmaker strongly favor a decision contrary to the one reached;‖ and,  \n9    ―[t]he legislative or administrative history . . . especially where there are \n10  contemporary statements by members of the decisionmaking body, minutes of its \n11  meetings, or reports.‖  \n12  Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 267-78.   \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  The Government argues that Plaintiffs must identify a group of similarly situated persons \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  who were treated more favorably to state an equal protection claim.  That is incorrect.  Plaintiffs \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  may state a claim by alleging that ―defendants acted with an intent or purpose to discriminate \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  against the plaintiff based upon membership in a protected class.‖  Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 \nS d nr\nee 17  F.3d 668, 686 (9th Cir. 2001) (quotation and citation omitted).  While one method alleging a \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  viable claim of discrimination is for the plaintiff to allege that the defendants (i) withheld a benefit \n19  from the plaintiff (ii) for which he or she was qualified (iii) which was extended to other similarly \n20  situated persons (iv) and that the defendants had no reasonable basis for treating plaintiff \n21  differently, McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-803 (1973), there are alternate \n22  paths to proving discrimination.  A plaintiff need not satisfy the McDonnell Douglas framework; \n23  Arlington Heights permits more generally ―a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct \n24  evidence of intent [to discriminate] as may be available.‖  429 U.S. at 266.  As the Ninth Circuit \n25  explained in Pac. Shores Props., LLC v. City of Newport Beach, 730 F.3d 1142, 1158-59 (9th Cir. \n26  2013), ―[o]ur cases clearly establish that plaintiffs who allege disparate treatment under statutory \n27  anti-discrimination laws need not demonstrate the existence of a similarly situated entity who or \n28  which was treated better than the plaintiffs in order to prevail.  [That] is only one way to survive \n45 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 46 of 57\n \n1  summary judgment on a disparate treatment claim.‖  (Emphasis in original.)  See Ave. 6E \n2  Investments, LLC v. City of Yuma, Ariz., 818 F.3d 493, 504-507 (9th Cir. 2016) (holding that \n3  plaintiffs stated a claim that city‘s denial of development permit violated Equal Protection Clause \n4  based on statements evidencing racial animus without allegation that similarly-situated developers \n5  were treated more favorably).  See also U.S. Department of Justice, Title VI Legal Manual, ¶ B, \n6  available at https://www.justice.gov/crt/fcs/T6Manual6#PID (explaining that Arlington Heights \n7  and McDonnell Douglas are alternative frameworks for proving intentional discrimination).   \n8  Thus, Plaintiffs need only plausibly plead direct or circumstantial evidence of \n9  discriminatory intent; they do not need specifically to plead that a group of similarly situated \n10  persons were treated more favorably to demonstrate discriminatory intent. \n11  c.  AADC Does Not Apply to This Case \n12  The Government argues that, under Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  U.S. 471 (1999) (―AADC‖), strict scrutiny does not apply in the immigration context even where a \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  claim of animus against a protected group is plausibly alleged.  In AADC, a group of aliens alleged \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  that the Attorney General had selectively initiated removal proceedings against them on the basis \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  of their political beliefs and affiliations in violation of the First Amendment.  The Supreme Court \nS d nr\nee 17  explained that ―[a]s a general matter . . . an alien unlawfully in this country has no constitutional \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  right to assert selective enforcement as a defense against his deportation.‖  525 U.S. at 488-89.  \n19  However, it did not ―rule out the possibility of a rare case in which the alleged basis of \n20  discrimination is so outrageous that the foregoing considerations can be overcome.‖  Id. at 491.   \n21  Importantly, the AADC standard confining discrimination claims to ―outrageous‖ cases is \n22  limited to challenges to the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, i.e., the ―discretion to choose to \n23  deport one person rather than another.‖  Kwai Fun Wong v. U.S., 373 F.3d 952, 970 (9th Cir. \n24  2004).  The reason for this limitation stems from the purpose of the AADC rule itself:  namely, that \n25  ―in deportation proceedings the consequence [of invading prosecutorial discretion] is to permit and \n26  prolong a continuing violation of United States law,‖ and ―[t]he contention that a violation must \n27  be allowed to continue because it has been improperly selected is not powerfully appealing.‖  \n28  AADC, 525 U.S. at 490-91.  Thus, Kwai Fun Wong held that AADC did not apply where an alien \n46 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 47 of 57\n \n1  challenged the discriminatory denial of adjustment of status and revocation of parole rather than \n2  the decision to pursue removal.  See also Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen, 291 F.Supp.3d 260, 275 \n3  (E.D.N.Y. 2018) (―Rather than alleging that they in particular are being targeted for removal \n4  because of their race—in which case judicial review of their suit would presumably be limited by \n5  [the AADC standard]—Plaintiffs allege that the categorical decision to end the DACA program, \n6  which provided them with some limited assurance that they would not be deported, was motivated \n7  by unlawful animus.‖).   \n8  This case is similar to Kwai Fun Wong.  The challenge here is not to a specific removal \n9  decision, where the continued presence of the alien in the U.S. prolongs an established continuing \n10  violation of law and the only thing that stands in the way of removal is a claim of prosecutorial \n11  misconduct in the selection of persons for removal.  Rather, as in Kwai Fun Wong, the challenge \n12  here is several steps removed from the prosecutorial decision to seek removal of any particular \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  individual.32  Moreover, the challenge here is on a programmatic level; it does not challenge an \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  individualized prosecutorial decision. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Although the Government contends that even programmatic challenges to immigration \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  policies independent of prosecutorial discretion in selecting individuals for removal are subject to \nS d nr\nee 17  review under AADC, citing Kandamar v. Gonzales, 464 F.3d 65 (1st Cir. 2006) and Hadayat v. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Gonzales, 458 F.3d 659 (7th Cir. 2006), these cases do not support the Government‘s argument.  \n19  In Kandamar, a Moroccan petitioner was placed in removal proceedings based on statements he \n20  made indicating that he had overstayed his visa in an interview required by the National Security \n21  Entry-Exit Registration System (―NSEERS‖) program.  NSEERS required young male \n22  nonimmigrant aliens from certain designated countries, including Morocco, to ―appear before, \n23  register with, answer questions from, and present documents . . . to DHS.‖  Kandamar, 464 F.3d at \n24  67.  In his removal proceedings, Kandamar filed a motion to suppress his NSEERS interview \n25  statements arguing, in part, that NSEERS ―constitutes racial profiling and discrimination based on \n26  national origin‖ and was fundamentally unfair because it was used ―to entrap nationals of certain \n27 \n                                                 \n32  Apart from TPS status, affected individual may have claims for, e.g., adjustment of status, \n28 \nasylum, or otherwise.   \n47 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 48 of 57\n \n1  countries.‖  Id. at 68.  Tellingly, the First Circuit did not apply AADC‘s narrow standard of review \n2  to Kandamar‘s programmatic attack on NSEERS.  Rather, it applied the traditional level of review \n3  under the equal protection doctrine for Congressional line-drawing with respect to ―immigration \n4  criteria based on an alien‘s nationality or place of origin,‖ id. at 72, the rational basis test.  The \n5  Court did not apply the specialized AADC test to the challenge to the NSEERS program. \n6  Separate from this programmatic challenge in the context of his motion to suppress, \n7  Kandamar argued that he was ordered removed based on national origin; the First Circuit agreed \n8  that ―a person in the same situation [as Kandahar] but not from one of the NSEERS countries \n9  would not have been placed in removal proceedings.‖  Id. at 74.  But because this aspect of \n10  Kandamar‘s challenge pertained to the decision to remove him (rather than the decision to \n11  interview him pursuant to NSEERS), the First Circuit followed AADC and held that ―[t]here is \n12  nothing in this record to demonstrate outrageous discrimination.‖  Id.  Thus, the AADC standard \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  was only applied to the challenge to the decision to pursue removal.   \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  In Hadayat, the Seventh Circuit considered a similar claim by an Indonesian petitioner \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  alleging that he was placed in removal because of NSEERS whereas a similarly situated person \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  from another country would not have been.  In that context, the Seventh Circuit applied AADC to \nS d nr\nee 17  conclude that ―Hadayat‘s conclusory comments regarding the allegedly discriminatory effect of \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  NSEERS do not come close to meeting [AADC‘s] high burden.‖  458 F.3d at 665 (emphasis \n19  added).  The AADC standard was applied because the programmatic attack arose in the context of \n20  his challenge to removal.  Hadayat contended ―he was unconstitutionally targeted for registration \n21  and removal based on his ethnicity and religion‖ id. at 664-65.  \n22  Thus, Kandamar and Hadayat are inapposite because they did not apply AADC beyond the \n23  narrow context of direct challenges to the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in removing \n24  individuals from this country.33  Cf. Wong, 373 F.3d at 974, 974, n.29 (refusing to ―countenance \n25 \n                                                 \n26 \n33  The Government‘s reliance on Cardenas v. United States, 826 F.3d 1164, 1169 (9th Cir. 2016) \nis also inapposite because it has to do with the doctrine of consular nonreviewability with respect \n27 \nto the denial of a visa application, for which judicial review is limited to confirming that the \nexecutive branch has cited a ―facially legitimate and bona fide reason.‖  This case does not involve \n28 \nthe denial of visa applications and the doctrine consular nonreviewability. \n48 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 49 of 57\n \n1  that the Constitution would permit immigration officials to engage in such behavior as rounding \n2  up all immigration parolees of a particular race solely because of a consideration such as skin \n3  color,‖ without ―address[ing] the question whether racial, ethnic, or religious discrimination \n4  against immigration parolees is tested by the usual heightened scrutiny applicable to such \n5  classifications‖).   \n6  d.  Trump v. Hawaii Does Not Require a Different Outcome \n7  In light of the Supreme Court‘s decision in Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. ___, 138 S.Ct. 2392 \n8  (2018), the Court must determine whether Trump alters that analysis by mandating deferential \n9  rational basis review rather than traditional strict scrutiny under Arlington Heights even where \n10  government conduct is motivated by race, color, or ethnicity. The Court is not persuaded that \n11  Trump‘s standard of deferential review applies here. \n12  In Trump, the President had issued a Proclamation which ―placed entry restrictions on the \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  nationals of eight foreign states whose systems for managing and sharing information about their \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  nationals the President deemed inadequate‖ for purposes of ―assess[ing] whether nationals of \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  particular countries present ‗public safety threats.‘‖  Id. at 2404.  The President declared that the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  restrictions ―were necessary to ‗prevent the entry of those foreign nationals about whom the \nS d nr\nee 17  United States Government lacks sufficient information‘; ‗elicit improved identity-management \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  and information-sharing protocols and practices from foreign governments‘; and otherwise \n19  ‗advance [the] foreign policy, national security, and counter-terrorism‘ objectives of the United \n20  States.  Id. at 2405.  Further, the restrictions ―would be the ‗most likely to encourage cooperation‘ \n21  [of foreign governments] while ‗protect[ing] the United States until such time as improvements \n22  occur.‘‖  Id.  The Proclamation purported to be an exercise of statutory authority under 8 U.S.C. § \n23  1182(f), which permits the President to ―suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens‖ \n24  whenever he ―finds‖ that their entry ―would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.‖  8 \n25  U.S.C. § 1182(f).   \n26  Notwithstanding the facially neutral text of the proclamation, the Trump plaintiffs alleged \n27  in part that the President‘s vitriolic anti-Muslim statements prior to taking the oath of office and \n28  thereafter demonstrated that the proclamation was motivated by religious animus in violation of \n49 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 50 of 57\n \n1  the First Amendment‘s establishment clause.  The principal question on review was what level of \n2  scrutiny would apply to the President‘s Proclamation in light of the alleged religious animus.   \n3  The Supreme Court explained that two factors informed the standard of review applied in \n4  Trump: that ―plaintiffs seek to invalidate a national security directive regulating the entry of aliens \n5  abroad,‖ and that the executive order was ―facially neutral toward religion‖ and thus required \n6  ―prob[ing] the sincerity of the stated justifications for the policy by reference to extrinsic \n7  statements.‖  Id. at 2418 (emphasis added).  The court noted that ―[f]or more than a century, this \n8  Court has recognized that the admission and exclusion of foreign nationals is a ‗fundamental \n9  sovereign attribute exercised by the Government‘s political departments largely immune from \n10  judicial control.‘‖  Id. (emphasis added).  ―Because decisions in these matters may implicate \n11  ‗relations with foreign powers,‘ . . . such judgments are ‗frequently of a character more \n12  appropriate to either the Legislature or the Executive.‘‖ Id. (quoting Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  67, 81 (1976)).  Moreover, because the persons in question were foreign nationals abroad seeking \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  admission with ―no constitutional right to entry,‖ the scope of review was already \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  ―circumscribed‖—review was available only to the extent that denial of the alien‘s admission \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  imposed ―burdens [on] the constitutional rights of a U.S. citizen.‖  Id. at 2419.  Taking these \nS d nr\nee 17  factors together, the Supreme Court concluded that ―[t]he upshot . . . in this context is clear: ‗Any \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  rule of constitutional law that would inhibit the flexibility‘ of the President ‗to respond to \n19  changing world conditions should be adopted only with the greatest caution,‘ and our inquiry into \n20  matters of entry and national security is highly constrained.‖  Id. at 2419-20 (quoting Mathews, \n21  426 U.S. at 81-82 (holding that Congress may condition an alien‘s eligibility for participation in \n22  federal medical insurance on duration of residency and permanent resident status)).  Further, the \n23  proposed inquiry could ―intrud[e] on the President‘s constitutional responsibilities in the area of \n24  foreign affairs.‖  Id. at 2419.   \n25  Applying these considerations—the entry of aliens from outside the United States, express \n26  national security concerns and active involvement of foreign policy—the Supreme Court applied a \n27  standard of review ―considers whether the entry policy is plausibly related to the Government‘s \n28  stated objective to protect the country and improve vetting procedures.‖  Id. at *21.  The Supreme \n50 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 51 of 57\n \n1  Court ―assume[d] that [it] may look behind the face of the Proclamation to the extent of applying \n2  rational basis review‖ including consideration of ―plaintiffs‘ extrinsic evidence [of President \n3  Trump‘s anti-Muslim statements].‖  Id. at 2420.  It held, however, that taking these statements into \n4  consideration, it would ―uphold the policy so long as it can reasonably be understood to result \n5  from a justification independent of unconstitutional grounds.‖  Id.   \n6  The case at bar is distinguishable from Trump in several respects.  First, Defendants herein \n7  did not cite national security as a basis for terminating TPS.  Rather, the stated basis purports to be \n8  nothing more than a factual determination that conditions in the ground in four countries no longer \n9  meet the statutory criteria of the TPS statute and thus the humanitarian (not national security) \n10  purposes underpinning TPS status have been obviated.   \n11  Second, unlike the Proclamation in Trump, Defendants have not claimed that TPS has been \n12  terminated for foreign policy reasons.  The government‘s decision to terminate TPS status was not \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  intended to induce the cooperation or action of a foreign government.  Compare Trump, 138 S.Ct. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  at 2421 (noting that Proclamation was ―expressly premised on legitimate purposes: preventing \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  entry of nationals who cannot be adequately vetted and inducing other nations to improve their \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  practices‖).   \nS d nr\nee 17  Third, the TPS-beneficiaries here, unlike those affected by the Proclamation in Trump, are \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  already in the United States.  They are not aliens abroad seeking entry or admission who ―have no \n19  constitutional right of entry‖ id. at 2419;34 TPS-beneficiaries have been admitted to the United \n20  States.  See Ramirez v. Brown, 852 F.3d 954, 958-61 (9th Cir. 2017).  As Plaintiffs currently \n21  reside lawfully in the United States, id., this case is unlike Trump; it does not implicate ―the \n22  admission and exclusion of foreign nationals,‖ Trump, 138 S.Ct. at 2418, who have ―no \n23  constitutional rights regarding [their] application‖ in light of the ―sovereign prerogative‖ ―to admit \n24  or exclude aliens.‖  Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U.S. 21, 32 (1982).  Hence, the basis for invoking \n25 \n26 \n                                                 \n34  Thus, their situation is unlike persons physically present at a United States port of entry who \n27 \nhad not been admitted but sought to be paroled.  See Nadarajah v. Gonzales, 443 F.3d 1069, 1082-\n83 (9th Cir. 2006) (reviewing agency‘s discretion to grant parole to alien under a deferential \n28 \n―facially legitimate and bona fide‖ reasons standard).  \n51 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 52 of 57\n \n1  broad judicial deference to executive action in excluding aliens does not apply.35 \n2  Fourth, relatedly, aliens within the United States have greater constitutional protections \n3  than those outside who are seeking admission for the first time.  See Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. \n4  678, 693 (2001) (explaining that ―certain constitutional protections available to persons inside the \n5  United States are unavailable to aliens outside of our geographic borders,‖ id., ―[b]ut once an alien \n6  enters the country, the legal circumstance changes, for the Due Process Clause applies to all \n7  ‗persons‘ within the United States, including aliens‖).  The aliens affected by the President‘s \n8  Proclamation in Trump were outside the United States and had ―no constitutional rights regarding \n9  [their] application,‖ Landon, 459 U.S. at 32; the courts could therefore only ―engage[] in a \n10  circumscribed judicial inquiry when the denial of a visa allegedly burdens the constitutional rights \n11  of a U.S. citizen.‖  Trump, 138 S.Ct. at 2419.  TPS-beneficiaries in the United States in contrast \n12  have ties to the United States, many with deep, long-term ties.  For example, 88% of Salvadoran \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  and 81% of Haitian TPS holders are employed, 11% are entrepreneurs, and 30% (45,500 \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  households with Savaldoran TPS holders and 6,200 with Haitian TPS holders) have mortgages.  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Compl. ¶ 48.  See Landon, 459 U.S. at 32 (―[O]nce an alien gains admission to our country and \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  begins to develop the ties that go with permanent residence his constitutional status changes \nS d nr\nee 17  accordingly.‖).  Although Landon refers to permanent resident aliens, the alien‘s ties to the United \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  States, not his or her formal immigration status, confer increased constitutional protection.  See \n19  U.S. v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259, 271 (1990) (―[A]liens receive constitutional protections \n20  when they have come within the territory of the United States and developed substantial \n21  connections with this country.‖); Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U.S. 763, 770 (1950) (―The alien, to \n22  whom the United States has been traditionally hospitable, has been accorded a generous and \n23  ascending scale of rights as he increases his identity with our society.  Mere lawful presence in the \n24  country creates an implied assurance of safe conduct and gives him certain rights[.]‖); see also \n25  Ibrahim v. Dep’t of Homeland Security, 669 F.3d 983, 997 (9th Cir. 2012) (holding that alien with \n26  nonimmigrant student visa had ―established ‗significant voluntary connection‘ with the United \n27 \n                                                 \n35  Indeed, TPS benefits may only be extended to admissible aliens, unless the Government \n28 \nextends a waiver to inadmissibility.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1254a(c)(1)(A)(iii); id. § 1254a(c)(2)(A).   \n52 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 53 of 57\n \n1  States such that she has the right to assert claims under the First and Fifth Amendments,‖ even \n2  though she had left the country and been denied re-entry while outside the country).   \n3  Fifth, the executive order at issue in Trump was issued pursuant to a very broad grant of \n4  statutory discretion: Section 1182(f) ―exudes deference to the President in every clause‖ by \n5  ―entrust[ing] to the President the decisions whether and when to suspend entry . . .; whose entry to \n6  suspend . . .; for how long . . .; and on what conditions.‖  Trump, 138 S.Ct. at 2408.  In contrast, \n7  Congress has not given the Secretary carte blanche to terminate TPS for any reason whatsoever.  \n8  Rather, the TPS statute empowers the Secretary of Homeland Security discretion to initiate, \n9  extend, and terminate TPS in specific enumerated circumstances.  8 U.S.C. § 1254a(b).  Even \n10  though the statute circumscribes judicial review, see supra, Congress prescribed the discretion of \n11  the Secretary in administering TPS.  Cf. Trump, 138 S.Ct. at 2424 (Kennedy, J., concurring) \n12  (“There are numerous instances in which the statements and actions of Government officials are \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  not subject to judicial scrutiny or intervention. That does not mean those officials are free to \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  disregard the Constitution and the rights it proclaims and protects.”).   \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  For these reasons, the facts, legal posture, and legal issues in Trump are substantially and \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  materially different from the present case.  Trump did not address the standard of review to be \nS d nr\nee 17  applied under the equal protection doctrine when steps are taken to withdraw an immigration \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  status or benefit from aliens lawfully present and admitted into the United States for reasons \n19  unrelated to national security or foreign affairs.  Trump therefore does not alter the Ninth Circuit‘s \n20  refusal to ―countenance that the Constitution would permit immigration officials to . . . round[] up \n21  all immigration parolees of a particular race solely because of a consideration such as skin color.‖  \n22  Wong, 373 F.3d at 974, 974, n. 29.  The equal protection guarantee applies with its conventional \n23  force to all persons in the United States.  Cf. Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 369 (1886) \n24  (explaining that the Fourteenth Amendment‘s ―provisions are universal in their application, to all \n25  persons within the territorial jurisdiction, without regard to any differences of race, of color, or of \n26  nationality‖ and holding that the administration of a race-neutral law in a prejudicial manner \n27  violates Equal Protection Clause).  TPS beneficiaries residing in the United States are such \n28  persons.  Accordingly, the deferential standard of review in Trump does not apply. \n53 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 54 of 57\n \n1  e.  Application to Plaintiffs‘ Allegations \n2  Having clarified that the Arlington Heights framework applies to review of Defendants‘ \n3  actions and that President Trump‘s stated animus may be attributed to the Secretary if he \n4  influenced an otherwise independent decision-making process, the Court now reviews whether \n5  Plaintiffs‘ factual allegations plausibly state a claim.   \n6  Plaintiffs chiefly rely on a set of anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim comments made by President \n7  Trump to support their claim of animus.  As set forth in detail above, President Trump has \n8  allegedly expressed animus toward ―non-white, non-European people,‖ Compl. ¶ 9, including by \n9  labeling Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists, id. ¶ 67, ―compar[ing] immigrants to snakes \n10  who will bite and kill anyone foolish enough to take them in,‖ id. ¶ 68, complaining that 40,000 \n11  Nigerians in the United States ―would never ‗go back to their huts‘ in Africa,‖ id. ¶ 69, and \n12  ―disseminat[ing] a debunked story about celebrations of the September 11, 2001, attacks [by \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Arabs living in New Jersey],‖ id.  President Trump also specifically made derogatory comments \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  about Haitians, including that the 15,000 admitted to the United States ―all have AIDS,‖ id.  One \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  week before TPS was terminated, President Trump asked aloud regarding Latin American and \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  African countries, including Haiti and El Salvador, ―Why are we having all these people from \nS d nr\nee 17  shithole countries come here?‖  He expressed a preference instead for Norwegians, who are \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  overwhelmingly white.  Id. ¶ 70.  The President also asked ―Why do we need more Haitians?‖ and \n19  insisted they be removed from an immigration deal.  Id. ¶ 70.  Plaintiffs characterize these \n20  statements and other evidence as evidence of ―racial and national-origin animus.‖  Compl. ¶ 66.  \n21  These allegations are more than sufficient to support a plausible inference of the President‘s \n22  animus based on race and/or national origin/ethnicity against non-white immigrants in general and \n23  Haitians, Salvadoreños, Nicaraguans, and Sudanese people in particular. 36   \n24 \n                                                 \n36  Insofar as Plaintiffs allege national origin discrimination, see Compl. ¶ 111, the Court construes \n25 \nit as a reference to ethnicity in light of the nature of the President‘s alleged comments relying on \nstereotypes about the physical or cultural characteristics of persons from the countries in question.  \n26 \nCf. Wong, 373 F.3d at 968, n.21 (construing allegation of national origin discrimination as being \nbased on ethnicity); cf. 29 C.F.R. § 1606.1 (defining ―national origin discrimination‖ under Title \n27 \nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include ―denial of equal employment opportunity because \nof an individual‘s, or his or her ancestor‘s place of origin; or because an individual has the \n28 \nphysical, cultural or linguistic characteristics of a national origin group‖ (emphasis added)). \n54 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 55 of 57\n \n1  Moreover, Plaintiffs plausibly allege that President Trump‘s animus was a factor in the \n2  TPS termination decisions in question.  According to Plaintiffs‘ allegations, President Trump \n3  repeatedly expressed his animus towards non-white immigrants on the campaign trail and after \n4  entering office, and explicitly linked those sentiments to his proposed immigration policies and \n5  priorities.  Most directly, at a meeting about TPS on January 11, 2018, President Trump expressed \n6  his disdain for persons from Haiti and El Salvador,37 and his administration then took action to \n7  terminate TPS status for those countries a mere 7 days later.  Compl. ¶ 70.  Although the \n8  termination of Sudan and Nicaragua in October and December 2017 pre-date the January 11, 2018 \n9  meeting, they post-date the other statements made by President Trump reflecting animus against \n10  non-white immigrants and other persons of Latino or African origin.  See Compl. ¶¶ 67 \n11  (categorical labels of Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists), 69 (complaining that migrants \n12  from Nigeria would never ―go back to their huts‖ in Africa); id. (disseminating a false anti-Arab \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  rumor about celebrations of the September 11, 2001 attacks in New Jersey).  Thus, Plaintiffs \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  plausibly allege that President Trump harbored racial and national origin/ethnic animus as of the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  time of all four TPS decisions challenged in this case.  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Further, Plaintiffs plausibly allege that President Trump influenced DHS‘s decision to \nS d nr\nee 17  terminate TPS status.  Most directly, Secretary Nielsen was present at the January 11, 2018 \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  meeting where the President referred to Haiti and El Salvador (at least) as ―shithole countries‖ and \n19  questioned why the United States would welcome their people here.  Compl. ¶ 72.  Haiti and El \n20  Salvador‘s TPS designations were terminated seven days later.  Id. ¶¶ 81, 84.  Further, Plaintiffs‘ \n21  allege that on November 6, 2017, with respect to Honduras—which is not at issue in this case—\n22  the White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly and White House Homeland Security Adviser Tom \n23  Bossert ―repeatedly called Acting Secretary Duke and pressured her to terminate the TPS \n24  designation for Honduras.‖  Id. ¶ 73.  Kelly was reportedly traveling with President Trump at the \n25 \n                                                 \n37  President Trump did not merely call Haiti and El Salvador ―shithole countries.‖  He asked \n26 \n―Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?‖ and ―Why do we need \nmore Haitians?‖  Compl. ¶ 70.  These are not merely comments about a place, but can reasonably \n27 \nbe understood as comments about the people who come from those places and their intrinsic \nworth.  It is reasonable to infer racial or national-origin/ethnic animus from these statements, as \n28 \nconfirmed by the reaction of listeners who were present.  Id. ¶ 71  \n55 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 56 of 57\n \n1  time.  Id.  Another news article cited by Plaintiffs (and thus incorporated into the complaint) notes \n2  that as early as June 2017 President Trump was ―berating his most senior advisers,‖ including \n3  then-DHS Secretary John Kelly, about immigrants who had entered the country that year from \n4  Afghanistan, Haiti, and Nigeria.  Id. ¶ 69, n.33.  Together, these allegations support a plausible \n5  inference that the White House has proactively inserted itself into DHS‘s TPS termination \n6  decisions during the relevant time period of October 2017 to January 2018 when the termination \n7  decisions were announced as part of its broader agenda on immigration.  Indeed, Defendants \n8  effectively concede that President Trump has insinuated himself into the TPS process.  See Reply \n9  at 9 (―Of course something of this nature would involve the White House . . .‖). \n10  In light of the allegations above, Plaintiffs have plausibly pled that President Trump‘s \n11  racial and national-origin/ethnic animus was a motivating factor in DHS‘s TPS termination \n12  decisions and thus have plausibly stated an equal protection claim.  Defendants‘ motion to dismiss \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  is DENIED. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  IV.  CONCLUSION \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  In sum, the Court holds that Section 1254a does not preclude judicial review of \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Defendants‘ APA claim to the extent Plaintiffs challenge the sub silentio departure from a prior \nS d nr\nee 17  practice or policy.  Further, Section 1254a does not preclude judicial review of Plaintiffs‘ \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  constitutional due process and equal protection claims.  Defendants‘ motion to dismiss under Rule \n19  12(b)(1) is DENIED. \n20  Defendants‘ motion to dismiss is also DENIED.  Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that \n21  Defendants‘ sub silentio departure from a prior practice or policy violates the Administrative \n22  Procedure Act (Fourth Claim).  Plaintiffs have also plausibly pled that the TPS termination \n23  decisions, as well as Defendants‘ adoption of a new interpretation of the TPS statute, were \n24  motivated by racial and/or ethnic animus in violation of the equal protection guarantee of the  \n25  /// \n26  /// \n27  /// \n28  /// \n56 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 55   Filed 08/06/18   Page 57 of 57\n \n1  constitution (Second Claim).  Finally, Plaintiffs have plausibly pled that Defendants‘ termination \n2  decisions violate Plaintiffs‘ substantive due process rights, at least to the extent that the decisions \n3  violated the APA and/or equal protection guarantee and therefore did not involve pursuit of a \n4  legitimate governmental interest. \n5  This order disposes of Docket No. 20.   \n6   \n7  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n8   \n9  Dated: August 6, 2018 \n10   \n11  ______________________________________ \nEDWARD M.

Under three prior \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  administrations, the TPS designations of these countries have been repeatedly extended based on \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  adverse and dangerous conditions in these countries.  Under the designations, approximately \nS d nr\nee 17  300,000 TPS beneficiaries have been allowed to stay and work in the United States because of \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  dangerous or unsafe conditions in their home countries.1  Without TPS designations, these \n19  beneficiaries will be subject to removal from the United States.   \n20  Plaintiffs in this case are TPS beneficiaries (who have resided in the United States for \n21  years) along with their U.S.-citizen children.  In this suit, Plaintiffs challenge the Trump \n22  administration’s decision to terminate TPS status for the affected countries.  Currently pending \n23  before the Court is Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.  Plaintiffs seek to enjoin the \n24  government from implementing or enforcing the decisions of the Secretary of the Department of \n25  Homeland Security to terminate TPS designations of these countries pending a final resolution of \n26 \n                                                 \n1 See Degen Decl., Ex. 14 (NSC Memo) (indicating that there are 5,349 TPS beneficiaries from \n27 \nNicaragua; 263,282 TPS beneficiaries from El Salvador; and 58,706 TPS beneficiaries from \nHaiti); Degen Decl., Ex. 87 (Decision Memo at 2) (indicating that there are 1,039 TPS \n28 \nbeneficiaries from Sudan).  \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 2 of 43\n \n1  the case on the merits. \n2  As described below, absent injunctive relief, TPS beneficiaries and their children \n3  indisputably will suffer irreparable harm and great hardship.  TPS beneficiaries who have lived, \n4  worked, and raised families in the United States (many for more than a decade), will be subject to \n5  removal.  Many have U.S.-born children; those may be faced with the Hobson’s choice of \n6  bringing their children with them (and tearing them away from the only country and community \n7  they have known) or splitting their families apart.  In contrast, the government has failed to \n8  establish any real harm were the status quo (which has been in existence for as long as two \n9  decades) is maintained during the pendency of this litigation.  Indeed, if anything, Plaintiffs and \n10  amici have established without dispute that local and national economies will be hurt if hundreds \n11  of thousands of TPS beneficiaries are uprooted and removed. \n12  The balance of hardships thus tips sharply in favor of TPS beneficiaries and their families.  \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  And Plaintiffs have made substantial showing on the merits of their claims, both on the facts and \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  the law.  They have presented a substantial record supporting their claim that the Acting Secretary \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  or Secretary of DHS, in deciding to terminate the TPS status of Haiti, El Salvador, Nicaragua and \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Sudan, changed the criteria applied by the prior administrations, and did so without any \nS d nr\nee 17  explanation or justification in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.  There is also \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  evidence that this may have been done in order to implement and justify a pre-ordained result \n19  desired by the White House.  Plaintiffs have also raised serious questions whether the actions \n20  taken by the Acting Secretary or Secretary was influenced by the White House and based on \n21  animus against non-white, non-European immigrants in violation of Equal Protection guaranteed \n22  by the Constitution.  The issues are at least serious enough to preserve the status quo. \n23  Having considered the parties’ briefs and accompanying submissions, as well as the oral \n24  argument of counsel, the Court hereby GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion.  It also sets a Case \n25  Management Conference for October 26, 2018 at 10:30 a.m. to discuss with the parties the \n26  possibility of an expeditious adjudication of the merits. \n27 \n28 \n2 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 3 of 43\n \n1  I.  FACTUAL & PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n2  A.  Statutory Background \n3  The TPS statute is 8 U.S.C. § 1254a.  Section 1254a(b) covers TPS designations.  It \n4  provides in relevant part as follows. \n \n5  (1)  In general.  The Attorney General, after consultation with \nappropriate agencies of the Government, may designate any \n6  foreign state (or any part of such foreign state) under this \nsubsection only if –  \n7   \n(A)  the Attorney General finds that there is an ongoing \n8  armed conflict within the state and, due to such \nconflict, requiring the return of aliens who are \n9  nationals of that state to that state (or to the part of \nthe state) would pose a serious threat to their personal \n10  safety; \n \n11  (B)  the Attorney General finds that –  \n \na  12  (i)  there has been an earthquake, flood, drought, \ntr in epidemic, or other environmental disaster in \nuoro 13  the state resulting in a substantial, but \nCfi\n tla temporary, disruption of living conditions in \nciC 14  the area affected, \nrts fo (ii)  the foreign state is unable, temporarily, to \niD tc 15  handle adequately the return to the state of \n sir\net aliens who are nationals of the state, and \ntatsiD 16  (iii)  the foreign state officially has requested \nS d nr designation under this subparagraph; or \nee 17   \nth\nintr (C)  the Attorney General finds that there exist \nUo\nN 18  extraordinary and temporary conditions in the foreign \nstate that prevent aliens who are nationals of the state \n19  from returning to the state in safety, unless the \nAttorney General finds that permitting the aliens to \n20  remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to \nthe national interest of the United States. \n21   \n22  8 U.S.C. § 1254a(b). \n23  Per the statute, “the initial period of designation of a foreign state . . . is the period, \n24  specified by the Attorney General, of not less than 6 months and not more than 18 months.”  Id. § \n25  1254a(b)(2).  Thereafter, there is periodic review to see whether the TPS designation should be \n26  terminated or extended.  See id.  Under § 1254a(b)(3)(A), “[a]t least 60 days before end of the \n27  initial period designation, and any extended period of designation, . . . the Attorney General, after \n28  consultation with appropriate agencies of the Government, shall review the conditions in the \n3 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 4 of 43\n \n1  foreign state (or part of such foreign state) . . . and shall determine whether the conditions for such \n2  designation under this subsection continue to be met.” \n3  •  “If the Attorney General determines . . . that a foreign state (or part of such foreign \n4  state) no longer continues to meet the conditions for designation under paragraph \n5  (1), the Attorney General shall terminate the designation . . . .”  Id. § \n6  1254a(b)(3)(B) (emphasis added). \n7  •  “If the Attorney General does not determine . . . that a foreign state (or part of such \n8  foreign state) no longer meets the conditions for designation under paragraph (1), \n9  the period of designation of the foreign state is extended for an additional period of \n10  6 months (or, in the discretion of the Attorney General, a period of 12 or 18 \n11  months).”  Id. § 1254a(b)(3)(C) (emphasis added). \n12  Section 1254a(b)(5)(A) provides that “[t]here is no judicial review of any determination of \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  the Attorney General with respect to the designation, or termination or extension of a designation, \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  of a foreign state under this subsection.”  Id. § 1254a(b)(5)(A).  However, the Court previously \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  held that this provision does not bar the Court from considering Plaintiffs’ particular claims \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  brought in the instant case, including their Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) and Equal \nS d nr\nee 17  Protection claims.  See Docket No. 55 (Order at 15, 20-21) (holding that this provision does not \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  preclude a challenge to general collateral practices or certain colorable constitutional claims). \n19  B.  General Process for TPS Designation Decision (on Periodic Review) \n20  For the most part, the parties agree that the general process for a TPS designation decision \n21  (on periodic review) is as follows.  The decisions are formally made by the Secretary for the \n22  Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”).  For her review, RAIO2 (a division within USCIS) \n23  provides a Country Conditions Memo.  In addition, OP&S3 (another division within USCIS) drafts \n24  a Decision Memo that contains USCIS’s recommendation on what to do about the TPS \n25  designation.  Once the Decision Memo is finalized, the USCIS Director passes it on to the DHS \n26 \n                                                 \n27 \n2 RAIO stands for Refugee, Asylum and International Operations Directorate. \n \n28 \n3 OP&S stands for Office of Policy and Strategy. \n4 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 5 of 43\n \n1  Secretary.  The State Department provides further input (e.g., country conditions, \n2  recommendations).  At times, input can also come from other government sources, but the above \n3  is the information consistently provided to the DHS Secretary.  See generally Rodriguez Decl. \n4  (former USCIS director during part of the Obama administration). \n5  C.  General Timeline for Countries at Issue \n6  Below is a general timeline of events for each of the countries at issue. \n7  1.  Haiti \n8  “Haiti was originally designed for TPS on January 21, 2010 based on the 7.0-magnitude \n9  earthquake on January 12, 2010 that prevented Haitians from returning safely.”  Docket No. 55 \n10  (Order at 6); see also 75 Fed. Reg. 3476, 3477 (Jan. 21, 2010).  “Haiti’s designation was \n11  subsequently extended and re-designated four times by the Obama administration and once by the \n12  Trump administration.”  Docket No. 55 (Order at 6).   \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Although the Trump administration extended Haiti’s TPS designation one time (in or about \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  May 2017), the extension was for six months only, and the Federal Register Notice announcing \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  the extension emphasized that “the designation of TPS was intended by Congress to be temporary \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  in nature”; that “the Government of Haiti has expressed a desire for its nationals to return”; that \nS d nr\nee 17  the DHS Secretary would – after the six months – “consider whether permitting Haitian nationals \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  to remain in the United States is contrary to the national interest of the United States”; and that \n19  beneficiaries are therefore “encouraged to prepare for their return to Haiti.”   82 Fed. Reg. 23830, \n20  23831 (May 24, 2017); see also Degen Decl., Ex. 45 (Decision Memo at 2) (noting that former \n21  DHS Secretary Kelly “extended Haiti’s TPS designation for a limited period of 6 months, with \n22  strong public messaging to the Haitian community to prepare for their return to their homeland”).  \n23  In short, the Notice portended the end of Haiti’s TPS designation. \n24  Subsequently, on November 20, 2017, Acting Secretary Duke made the decision to \n25  terminate Haiti’s TPS designation.  See 83 Fed. Reg. 2648, 2650 (Jan. 18, 2018).  The termination \n26  was formally announced on January 18, 2018.  See Docket No. 55 (Order at 6).  The Federal \n27  Register Notice stated that the Acting Secretary was terminating the TPS designation for Haiti as \n28  of July 22, 2019, because “the conditions for Haiti’s designation for TPS – on the basis of \n5 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 6 of 43\n \n1  ‘extraordinary and temporary conditions’ relating to the 2010 earthquake that prevented Haitian \n2  nationals from returning in safety – are no longer met.”  83 Fed. Reg. 2648, 2650 (Jan. 18, 2018). \n3  2.  Sudan \n4  “Sudan was designated for TPS in November 1997 due to an ongoing armed conflict and \n5  extraordinary conditions preventing nationals from returning safely.”  Docket No. 55 (Order at \n6  10); see also 62 Fed. Reg. 59737 (Nov. 4, 1997).  The TPS designation “was periodically extended \n7  and/or re-designated . . . 15 times by the Clinton, Bush, and Obama administrations.”  Docket No. \n8  55 (Order at 10).   \n9  It appears that, in early September 2017, Acting Secretary Duke made the decision to \n10  terminate Sudan’s TPS designation.  See, e.g., Degen Decl., Ex. 5 (email) (discussing “edits to the \n11  FRN [Federal Register Notice] announcing the termination of TPS for Sudan”). \n12  “On October 11, 2017, Acting Secretary . . . Duke announced the termination of Sudan’s \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  TPS [designation] . . . .”  Docket No. 55 (Order at 11).  The Federal Register Notice stated that the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  TPS designation was being terminated as of November 2, 2018, because “[t]he ongoing armed \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  conflict no longer prevents the return of nationals to Sudan to all regions of Sudan without posing \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  a serious threat to their personal safety.  Further, extraordinary and temporary conditions within \nS d nr\nee 17  Sudan no longer prevent nationals from returning in safety to all regions of Sudan.”  82 Fed. Reg. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  47228, 47230 (Oct. 11, 2017). \n19  3.  Nicaragua \n20  “Nicaragua was originally designated for TPS on January 5, 1999 on the basis of Hurricane \n21  Mitch.”  Docket No. 55 (Order at 8).  Its “designation was extended 13 times by the Clinton, Bush, \n22  and Obama administrations.”  Docket No. 55 (Order at 9). \n23  On or about November 5, 2017, Acting Secretary Duke made the decision to terminate \n24  Nicaragua’s TPS designation.  See Degen Decl., Ex. 30 (email).   \n25  “On December 15, 2017, Acting Secretary Duke announced that Nicaragua’s designation \n26  would terminate . . . .”  Docket No. 55 (Order at 9).  The Federal Register Notice stated that the \n27  TPS designation was being terminated as of January 9, 2019, because “conditions for Nicaragua’s \n28  1999 designation for TPS on the basis of environmental disaster due to the damage caused by \n6 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 7 of 43\n \n1  Hurricane Mitch are no longer met.”  82 Fed. Reg. 59636, 59637 (Dec. 15, 2017).   \n2  4.  El Salvador \n3  “El Salvador was designated for TPS on March 9, 2001 based on a series of earthquakes.”  \n4  Docket No. 55 (Order at 7).  Its designation was “extended 11 times by the Bush and Obama \n5  administrations.”  Docket No. 55 (Order at 7). \n6  It is not clear from the record when Secretary Nielsen made the actual decision to \n7  terminate but it appears to have taken place some time in early to mid-January 2018.  See El \n8  Salvador AR at 1 (email, dated January 4, 2018, from Maj. Gen. Norman (U.S. Southern \n9  Command)) (providing comments on what might happen if the TPS designation were terminated); \n10  El Salvador AR at 5-01 (memo on January 5, 2018, phone call to President of El Salvador) \n11  (referring to “your upcoming decision regarding the future of El Salvador’s Temporary Protected \n12  Status (TPS) designation”).   \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  The termination of El Salvador’s TPS designation was formally announced on January 18, \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  2018.  See Docket No. 55 (Order at 8).  The Federal Register Notice stated that the TPS \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  designation was being terminated as of September 9, 2019, because “the conditions supporting El \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Salvador’s 2011 designation for TPS on the basis of environmental disaster due to the damage \nS d nr\nee 17  caused by the 2001 earthquakes are no longer met.”  83 Fed. Reg. 2654, 2655-56 (Jan. 18, 2018).   \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  II.  DISCUSSION \n19  A.  Legal Standard \n20  “[The] purpose of a preliminary injunction . . . is to preserve the status quo and the rights \n21  of the parties until a final judgment issues in the cause.”  U.S. Philips Corp. v. KBC Bank N.V., \n22  590 F.3d 1091, 1094 (9th Cir. 2010); see also Boardman v. Pac. Seafood Grp., 822 F.3d 1011, \n23  1024 (9th Cir. 2016) (stating that “[t]he ‘purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the \n24  status quo ante litem pending a determination of the action on the merits’; ‘[s]tatus quo ante litem’ \n25  refers to ‘the last uncontested status which preceded the pending controversy’”).  “A preliminary \n26  injunction . . . is not a preliminary adjudication on the merits but rather a device for preserving the \n27  status quo and preventing the irreparable loss of rights before judgment.”  Sierra On-Line, Inc. v. \n28  Phx. Software, Inc., 739 F.2d 1415, 1422 (9th Cir. 1984). \n7 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 8 of 43\n \n \n1  A party seeking a preliminary injunction must meet one of two \nvariants of the same standard.  Under the original Winter standard, a \n2  party must show “that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is \nlikely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, \n3  that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is \nin the public interest.”  Winter v. NRDC, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  \n4  Under the “sliding scale” variant of the Winter standard, “if a \nplaintiff can only show that there are ‘serious questions going to the \n5  merits’ – a lesser showing than likelihood of success on the merits – \nthen a preliminary injunction may still issue if the ‘balance of \n6  hardships tips sharply in the plaintiff's favor,’ and the other two \nWinter factors are satisfied.”  \n7   \n8  All. for the Wild Rockies v. Pena, 865 F.3d 1211, 1217 (9th Cir. 2017). \n9  B.  Likelihood of Irreparable Injury/Balance of Hardships/Public Interest \n10  The Court addresses first the likelihood of irreparable injury, the balance of hardships, and \n11  the public interest. \n12  The record evidence establishes a compelling case as to these factors in favor of Plaintiffs.  \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Plaintiffs have submitted a number of declarations which establish that, without a preliminary \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  injunction, TPS beneficiaries are likely to suffer irreparable injury.  See, e.g., Docket No. 91 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  (Abdalla Decl.); Docket No. 92 (De Ayala Decl.); Docket No. 93 (Elarabi Decl.); Docket No. 94 \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  (Ampie Decl).  The declarants are TPS beneficiaries who have lived in the United States for a \nS d nr\nee 17  significant number of years, some as many as twenty.  Without a preliminary injunction, the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  declarants risk being removed.  At the hearing, the government conceded that there are \n19  approximately 300,000 TPS beneficiaries registered as such and that they are likely to be subject \n20  to removal.4  TPS beneficiaries thus risk being uprooted from their homes, jobs, careers, and \n21  communities.  They face removal to countries to which their children and family members may \n22  have little or no ties and which may not be safe.  Those with U.S.-citizen children will be \n23  confronted with the dilemma of either bringing their children with them, giving up their children’s \n24  lives in the United States (for many, the only lives they know), or being separated from their \n25  children.  See County/Citi Amici at 4 (noting that “[t]he beneficiaries . . . have hundreds of \n26 \n                                                 \n4 Removal of TPS status returns beneficiaries to their former status.  Those who have an \n27 \nindependent status entitling them to stay in the U.S. are not likely to be registered under TPS \nstatus.  Hence, those who are so registered likely do not enjoy any other status entitling them to \n28 \nstay.  The government essentially conceded such at the hearing. \n8 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 9 of 43\n \n1  thousands of U.S.-citizen children, 192,000 born to Salvadoran beneficiaries alone”).  \n2  Understandably, this prospect is a source of great emotional distress, fear, and anxiety.   \n3  For example, Ebtihal Abdalla and her husband are TPS beneficiaries from Sudan.  They \n4  have been beneficiaries since the late 1990s.  They have three children.  One is a TPS beneficiary \n5  and has lived in the United States since she was a baby.  The other two are U.S. citizens.  Once \n6  Sudan’s designation is terminated, her husband will be unable to work and, as he is the primary \n7  breadwinner, this will have significant impact on the family’s livelihood.  Furthermore, since the \n8  announcement of Sudan’s termination, Ms. Abdalla has suffered bouts of uncontrollable crying \n9  and serious migraines.  She has also found it difficult to eat and to leave the house.  She was \n10  recently diagnosed with severe depression and prescribed medications.  Ms. Abdalla’s children \n11  have also been impacted by the announcement of Sudan’s termination.  For example, Ms. \n12  Abdalla’s oldest daughter is currently at a community college.  Once Sudan’s termination is \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  terminated, she will not be able to work, and she needs the work in order to help pay for tuition.  \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  She is fearful that she will not be able to attend a four-year college or university, as planned, if \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Sudan’s TPS is terminated before she completes her coursework at the community college.  As for \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Ms. Abdalla’s youngest daughter, she is only twelve and, after learning that her family’s \nS d nr\nee 17  immigration status is in jeopardy, she has struggled at school, with a teacher even expressly \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  voicing concern.   \n19  Similar testimony is provided in the declarations of Elsy Yolanda Flores De Ayala, see De \n20  Ayala Decl. (testifying about the impact of the announcement of El Salvador’s termination on her, \n21  her husband, her U.S.-citizen sister who has cancer, and her three children, one who is a TPS \n22  beneficiary and the other two who are U.S. citizens); Hiwaida Elarabi, see Elarabi Decl. (testifying \n23  about the impact of the announcement of Sudan’s termination on him, her extended family with \n24  whom she lives in the United States and whom she helps support, and her parents in Sudan whom \n25  she helps support); Imara Ampie, see Ampie Decl. (testifying about the impact of the \n26  announcement of Nicaragua’s termination on her, her husband, and her two U.S.-citizen children, \n27  both of whom have special needs); and Wilna Destin.  See Destin Decl. (testifying about the \n28  impact of the announcement of Haiti’s termination on her and her two U.S.-citizen children).  See \n9 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 10 of 43\n \n1  also Docket No. 55 (Order at 3-6) (discussing Plaintiffs’ backgrounds as alleged in the complaint). \n2  The amicus briefs underscore that the harms to TPS beneficiaries will also harm the public \n3  interest.  For example, many TPS beneficiaries are part of the workforce and have a significant \n4  presence in the construction, hospitality, food service, landscaping, home health care, child care, \n5  and retail industries.  See, e.g., Docket No. 103-1 (State Amici at 9) (noting that “an estimated \n6  37,000-70,000 construction workers are TPS holders”).  Without a preliminary injunction, these \n7  TPS beneficiaries will no longer be able to work, thus adversely impacting state and local \n8  economies.  The State Amici estimates that “loss of legal status for these TPS holders is projected \n9  to cost $132.6 billion in GDP (due to lost earnings as well as decreased industry outputs), $5.2 \n10  billion in Social Security and Medicare contributions, and $733 million in employers’ turnover \n11  costs.”  Docket No. 103-1 (State Amici at 9).  Also, if TPS beneficiaries cannot work, then they \n12  will lose their employer-sponsored health care which will put a strain on public resources.  \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Furthermore, many TPS beneficiaries are homeowners; if these TPS beneficiaries are no longer \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  able to work, they may not be able to pay their property taxes, and their homes may become \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  subject to foreclosure.  See, e.g., Docket No. 103-1 (State Amici at 10) (stating that “[t]hirty-two \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  percent of TPS holders from El Salvador and Haiti have mortgages, and almost 42 percent of \nS d nr\nee 17  Nicaraguan immigrants are homeowners”; adding that “Salvadoran TPS homeowners pay an \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  estimated $100 million in property taxes annually, including up to $32 million in the Los Angeles \n19  area alone”).  Finally, TPS beneficiaries also contribute to their communities in other less tangible, \n20  but equally important, ways.  See, e.g., County/Citi Amici at 5 (noting that “a survey of TPS \n21  recipients from El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua found that 30 percent are civically active, \n22  and about 20 percent engage in community service such as volunteering with nonprofit \n23  organizations or at children’s hospitals”). \n24  The government does not dispute the practical and human hardships upon TPS \n25  beneficiaries and their children that will be caused if TPS status were terminated.  Nor has the \n26  government taken issue with the estimates of adverse impact upon the economy resulting from the \n27  termination and resulting en masse removal of TPS beneficiaries. \n28  Indeed, the government’s own documents reflect that public interest considerations weighs \n10 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 11 of 43\n \n1  in favor of a preliminary injunction.  Apart from adversely impacting the domestic economy, \n2  terminating TPS status may have adverse ramifications internationally.  For example, in a memo \n3  dated October 2017, James Nealon, then-Assistant Secretary for International Affairs in OP&S \n4  (and a former ambassador to Honduras), gave examples as to why terminating the TPS \n5  designations for, inter alia, Nicaragua and El Salvador would be against the United States’ own \n6  interest – e.g., returning aliens to these countries would put a strain on the countries’ systems and \n7  “possibly spur further irregular migration to the United States.”  Degen Decl., Ex. 161 (Memo at \n8  2); El Salvador AR at 1 (U.S. Southern Command, making a similar point regarding El Salvador); \n9  see also Degen Decl., Ex. 70 (U.S. embassy in El Salvador, recommending extension of TPS \n10  designation because it was in the United States’ own interest).  In an email dated September 2017, \n11  the Department of Defense raised concerns that termination of Sudan’s TPS designation could \n12  negatively impact the United States from a foreign policy perspective.  See Degen Decl., Ex. 9 \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  (email from Department of Defense, expressing concern about draft language in Federal Register \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Notice regarding Sudan’s TPS designation; adding that “[w]e are entering a delicate phase in our \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  relationship with the Government of Sudan that may set the future trajectory of the relationship for \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  years to come, and maintaining domestic and international partner support through consistent and \nS d nr\nee 17  credible messaging will be critical to achieving defense interests in Sudan”).   \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  As noted, the government does not challenge the record evidence compiled by Plaintiffs \n19  and amici.  That is, as a factual matter, the government does not contest any of the injuries or \n20  hardships catalogued above.  Instead, the government offers only two legal arguments as to why \n21  there is no likelihood of irreparable injury, the balance of hardships does not tip sharply in \n22  Plaintiffs’ favor, and/or the public interest weighs against a preliminary injunction.  Those legal \n23  arguments are: (1) Plaintiffs will suffer an irreparable injury only if they prevail on the merits and \n24  Plaintiffs are likely to lose on the merits and (2) Plaintiffs’ injuries “are inherent in the temporary \n25  nature of TPS status” – i.e., “[a] TPS beneficiary is . . . always subject to the same uncertainties \n26  and concerns that Plaintiffs allege here” because the TPS program is inherently temporary in \n27  nature.  Opp’n at 26.  Neither of these arguments is persuasive. \n28  The government’s first argument is problematic because it effectively makes the factor of \n11 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 12 of 43\n \n1  likelihood of success on the merits dispositive.  But likelihood of success on the merits is not the \n2  sole consideration at the preliminary injunction phase; rather, irreparable injury and the balance of \n3  hardships must also be taken into account.  The government’s position cannot be squared with the \n4  sliding scale test expressly endorsed by the Ninth Circuit – i.e., that the balance of hardships \n5  defines the showing on the merits the plaintiff must make at the preliminary injunction stage.  \n6  Instead, the government’s argument assumes there is no merit to Plaintiffs’ claims and thus no \n7  irreparable injury.  But at this stage, the merits cannot be definitively resolved, as evident in this \n8  Court’s order denying the motion to dismiss, its assessment of the merits below, and the District \n9  Court’s decision in Centro Presente v. United States Dep’t of Homeland Sec., No. 18-10340, 2018 \n10  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 122509 (D. Mass. July 23, 2018) (in similar TPS case, largely denying \n11  government’s motion to dismiss).  At bottom, the government’s argument ignores the fact that “[a] \n12  preliminary injunction . . . is not a preliminary adjudication on the merits but rather a device for \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  preserving the status quo and preventing the irreparable loss of rights before judgment.”  Sierra \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  On-Line, 739 F.2d at 1422. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  The government’s second argument fares no better.  Although the TPS program is \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  temporary in nature, that does not mean that Plaintiffs’ injuries claimed herein are the purely result \nS d nr\nee 17  of the temporary nature of the program as opposed to the government’s actions.  For example, if \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  (as Plaintiffs argue) the government were to follow the APA’s procedural requirements as \n19  Plaintiffs contend is mandated by law, then, at the very least, TPS beneficiaries would have \n20  additional time in the United States to, e.g., work, wrap up their affairs in the United States, and \n21  prepare for a return to their countries of origin.  Although their stay is temporary in nature, the \n22  shortening of their time in the United States and acceleration of their removal if relief is not \n23  granted may constitute irreparable injury.  There is also the possibility that were DHS to apply \n24  properly the requisites of the APA in assessing the TPS designation at issue, and to do so free of \n25  any Equal Protection taint, the Secretary might determine the extension(s) of TPS status for one or \n26  more of the affected countries is justified. \n27  Balanced against Plaintiffs’ injuries if a preliminary injunction were not to issue are the \n28  government’s injuries if a preliminary injunction were to issue.  As an initial matter, the Court \n12 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 13 of 43\n \n1  notes that the government cannot argue in good faith that the continued presence of TPS \n2  beneficiaries in the country pending a final adjudication of the merits causes any concrete harm to \n3  the United States.  By and large, TPS beneficiaries have been in the United States for a significant \n4  number of years, and there is nothing in the record suggesting their continued presence until the \n5  merits of this case can be adjudicated threatens the national interest or, e.g., national security.  \n6  Rather, as amici have underscored and the government has not disputed, TPS beneficiaries are \n7  contributors to state and local communities.5  Moreover, the Court intends to expedite trial and \n8  final adjudication on the merits without delay, thereby minimizing any prejudice to the \n9  government. \n10  The government nevertheless protests that it and the public “share an interest in ensuring \n11  that the process established by Congress – under which the Secretary of Homeland Security is \n12  vested with unreviewable discretion to carefully weigh the statutory factors governing TPS \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  designations – is followed as Congress intended.”  Opp’n at 27.  The government also states that \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  “the injunctive relief sought by Plaintiffs would frustrate and displace the DHS Secretary’s \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  substantive judgment as to how to implement the TPS statute.”  Opp’n at 27.  But these arguments \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  are lacking because they relate to jurisdictional issues upon which this Court has already ruled in \nS d nr\nee 17  denying the government’s motion to dismiss – e.g., the APA claim herein focuses on process only \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  (not the actual substantive determination as to TPS status of each country), and thus judicial \n19  review is not barred.  While the equal protection claim could impact the ultimate determination as \n20  to each country, it would do so not on the Secretary’s factual findings about country condition \n21  which would be insulated from judicial review, but because of the influence of an overarching \n22  unconstitutional consideration that transcends each individual determination.   \n23  Furthermore, the government’s argument would apply to any public injunction enjoining \n24  the implementation or execution of any legislation or agency/executive policy.  The risk of \n25  interference with governmental actions inheres in any public injunction, but that does not \n26 \n                                                 \n5 At the hearing, the government mentioned for the first time that there would be operational costs \n27 \ninvolved if the Court were to issue a preliminary injunction in favor of Plaintiffs.  However, this \nargument is waived as it was never presented in the government’s papers.  Moreover, there is no \n28 \nrecord evidence to substantiate any “operational harm.” \n13 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 14 of 43\n \n1  categorically bar such injunctions.  While courts must exercise particular caution in issuing \n2  injunctions on matters that concern immigration given Congress and the President’s extensive \n3  authority in this arena, it is beyond peradventure that governmental decision, even those that \n4  concern on immigration, are not immune from judicial review.  See, e.g., Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 \n5  U.S. 678, 682 (2001) (with respect to “aliens who were admitted to the United States but \n6  subsequently ordered removed,” considering “whether the post-removal-period statute authorizes \n7  the Attorney General to detain a removable alien indefinitely beyond the removal period or only \n8  for a period reasonably necessary to secure the alien’s removal”) (emphasis added); Osorio-\n9  Martinez v. AG United States, 893 F.3d 153, 175 (3d Cir. 2018) (“recogniz[ing] that, while the \n10  political branches’ plenary power over immigration is ‘by no means . . . subject to judicial review \n11  in all contexts,’ it is ‘certain[ly]’ subject to judicial review in some contexts because that power ‘is \n12  [not] limitless in all respects’”; thus, distinguishing between aliens seeking initial admission to the \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  country and those who had developed substantial connections with the country).  \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  The bottom line is there is nothing in the record establishing the continued presence of TPS \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  beneficiaries in the United States causes harm to the country; in contrast, if the Court were to deny \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  an injunction, Plaintiffs stand to suffer substantial irreparable injury.  Any ultimate adjudication on \nS d nr\nee 17  the merits in their favor may come too late if they have been removed prior to final adjudication.  \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Once the TPS beneficiaries are removed, the government’s actions – if deemed unlawful in this \n19  lawsuit – could not practically be undone.   \n20  Accordingly, the Court finds that, without a preliminary injunction, there is a strong \n21  likelihood that Plaintiffs would suffer irreparable injury, with concomitant harm to state and local \n22  communities as well.  In addition, any harm to the government or the public if a preliminary \n23  injunction were issued is strongly outweighed by the harm to Plaintiffs and their communities \n24  should a preliminary injunction not issue.6  The balance of hardships tips decidedly in Plaintiffs’ \n25 \n                                                 \n6 To the extent the government argues laches (i.e., Plaintiffs should have brought their case and/or \n26 \nmoved for a preliminary injunction earlier), that contention is without merit because Plaintiffs \nhave been diligent.  Plaintiffs filed their case in March 2018, which was only a few months after \n27 \ndecisions were made on Haiti and El Salvador.  While the decisions on Sudan and Nicaragua were \nmade a little earlier, Plaintiffs’ lawsuit was still filed well in advance of the actual termination \n28 \ndates.  As for the motion for preliminary injunction, although it was not filed until August 2018, \n14 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 15 of 43\n \n1  favor. \n2  C.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits/Serious Questions Going to the Merits \n3  The Court now turns to the issue of likelihood of success on the merits.  Because Plaintiffs \n4  have established that the balance of hardships tips sharply in their favor, they need only show \n5  serious questions on the merits have been raised in order to obtain preliminary injunctive relief.  \n6  Plaintiffs argue that they are likely to succeed, but, at the very least, there are serious questions \n7  going to the merits, on both their APA and Equal Protection claims.  Each claim is addressed \n8  below. \n9  1.  APA Claim \n10  The Court previously laid out the legal standard for Plaintiffs’ APA claim in its order \n11  denying the government’s motion to dismiss: \n \na  12  Under the APA, agency action may be set aside if it is arbitrary or \ntr in capricious. See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Under this standard, an \nuoro 13  agency must “examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory \nCfi\n tla explanation for its action.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United \nciC 14  States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 \nrts fo (1983).  But “a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the \niD tc 15  agency” and “should uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if \n sir\net the agency’s path may reasonably be discerned.”  F.C.C. v. Fox \ntatsiD 16  Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 513-14 (2009) (citation and \nS d nr quotation omitted). \nee 17   \nth\nintr The APA constrains an agency’s ability to change its practices or \nUo\nN 18  policies without acknowledging the change or providing an \nexplanation.  “[T]he requirement that an agency provide reasoned \n19  explanation for its action would ordinarily demand that [an agency] \ndisplay awareness that it is changing position.”  Id. at 515 (emphasis \n20  in original). Thus, agencies “may not . . . depart from a prior policy \nsub silentio or simply disregard rules that are still on the books,” and \n21  “must show that there are good reasons for the new policy.”  Id. \n(emphasis in original).  An agency need not demonstrate that “the \n22  reasons for the new policy are better than the reasons for the old \none; it suffices that the new policy is permissible under the statute, \n23  that there are good reasons for it, and that the agency believes it to \nbe better, which the conscious change of course adequately \n24  indicates.”  Id. (emphasis in original). \n \n25  This constraint on changes to agency policy is not limited to formal \nrules or official policies.  It applies to practices implied from the \n26  agency conduct.  For example, in California Trout v. F.E.R.C., 572 \n27 \n                                                 \nthat is because the parties first decided to litigate the 12(b)(6) issues, which included a \n28 \njurisdictional issue. \n15 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 16 of 43\n \nF.3d 1003 (9th Cir. 2009), the plaintiffs challenged the Federal \n1  Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) denial of their untimely \nattempt to intervene in a proceeding concerning the renewal of an \n2  operating license for a dam and power plant.  In essence, the \nplaintiffs argued that FERC’s decision to grant late intervention \n3  requests in three prior adjudications had given rise to an implicit rule \nthat FERC would always grant late requests in certain \n4  circumstances, and that FERC was required to offer a reasoned \nexplanation before abandoning that practice.  Although it ultimately \n5  held against the plaintiffs, the Ninth Circuit agreed that the alleged \nchange in adjudicative practice was subject to the APA’s \n6  requirements for reasoned decision-making.  It explained that “while \nan agency may announce new principles in an adjudicatory \n7  proceeding, it may not depart, sub silentio, from its usual rules of \ndecision to reach a different, unexplained result in a single case.”  \n8  Id. at 1022 (quotation and citation omitted)).  Rather, “if [an agency] \nannounces and follows – by rule or by settled course of adjudication \n9  – a general policy by which its exercise of discretion will be \ngoverned, an irrational departure from that policy (as opposed to an \n10  avowed alteration of it) could constitute action that must be \noverturned as ‘arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion’ \n11  within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act.’”  Id. at \n1023 (quoting INS v. Yueh-Shaio Yang, 519 U.S. 26, 32 (1996)) \na  12  (emphasis added, alteration in original).  The court proceeded to \ntr in consider the claim on the merits and held that the agency’s prior \nuoro 13  decisions had not “establish[ed] a broad principle that the \nCfi\n tla Commission will allow untimely intervention.”  Id. at 1024. \nciC 14   \nrts fo Thus, California Trout establishes that a shift in agency practice (as \niD tc 15  opposed to a formal rule or policy) is also reviewable under the \n sir\net APA.  Courts have also looked, in part, to whether an agency’s past \ntatsiD 16  practice evinces the existence of an implicit rule or policy.  See, e.g., \nS d nr Northwest Env. Def. Ctr. v. Bonneville Power Admin., 477 F.3d 668 \nee 17  (9th Cir. 2007) (holding that BPA’s decision to stop funding Fish \nth\nintr Passage Center and to divert its responsibilities to two other entities \nUo\nN 18  after nearly two decades was arbitrary and capricious where no \nreasoned explanation was provided); Am. Wild Horse Pres. \n19  Campaign v. Perdue, 873 F.3d 914, 927 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (after \n“longstanding practice” of treating certain land as if it were part of \n20  the Wild Horse Territory, agency’s unexplained change in practice \nwas arbitrary-and-capricious, particularly where it “fail[ed] even to \n21  acknowledge its past practice . . . let alone to explain its reversal of \ncourse in the 2013 decision”). \n22   \n23  Docket No. 55 (Order at 24-26).  The alleged changes in policy – eliminating consideration of \n24  intervening conditions not directly related to the originating condition – is substantive and highly \n25  consequential; it is at least as significant and impactful as the changes in California Trout, \n26  Bonneville Power Admin., and Am Wild Horse Pres. Campaign.  Indeed, the significance of the \n27  change was recognized by Acting Secretary Duke as “a strong break with past practice.”  Degen \n28  Decl., Ex. 30.  See Centro Presente, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 122509, at *62 (in a similar TPS case, \n16 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 17 of 43\n \n1  noting that “even if the alleged new policy is interpretive [rather than legislative, with only the \n2  latter requiring the notice-and-comment process], Defendants would be required to provide some \n3  rationale acknowledging the change in position to provide the ‘observance of procedure required \n4  by law’”).  Cf. Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 136 S. Ct. 2117, 2125-26 (2016) (noting that, \n5  in explaining its changed position, an agency must also be cognizant that longstanding policies \n6  may have “engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into account”). \n7  Based on the above legal standard, all that Plaintiffs must show to establish a likelihood of \n8  success on the merits – or least serious questions going to the merits – is a change in DHS \n9  practices with respect to TPS designations.  There is no dispute that DHS never acknowledged any \n10  change in practice and thus has not provided any explanation for any such change. \n11  Recognizing the impact of the Court’s order on the motion to dismiss, the government \n12  implicitly suggests that the Court should reconsider its ruling that the APA’s restrictions apply to \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  agency practices, and not just formal rules or official policies.  This is evidenced by the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  government’s attempt to distinguish the cases cited by the Court in its order on the motion to \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  dismiss.  See Opp’n at 12-13 & n.11 (addressing, inter alia, three cases discussed in the Court’s \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  order – namely, California Trout, Bonneville Power, and Wild Horse).  The Court rejects the \nS d nr\nee 17  government’s implicit suggestion because (1) the government has not formally moved for \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  reconsideration of the Court’s order on the motion to dismiss and (2) even if it had, it has made no \n19  showing that, e.g., the Court manifestly failed “to consider material facts or dispositive legal \n20  arguments which were presented to the Court before” it ruled on the motion to dismiss.  Civ. L.R. \n21  7-9(b)(3). \n22  Left with this, the government has come up with a slightly different legal argument:  \n23  (1) that the purpose behind the APA’s procedural requirements is “to ensure that regulated \n24  entities have fair notice of permissible and impermissible regulated conduct and their \n25  obligations under the law, as well as the sanctions they may incur if they breach those \n26  obligations”;  \n27  (2) that the APA’s procedural requirements therefore kick in only when an agency \n28  “change[s] the rules of the game in a way that bears directly on the rights or interests of \n17 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 18 of 43\n \n1  regulated entities and other stakeholders”; and  \n2  (3) that, here, “[u]nlike regulatory administrative actions, the designation of a country for \n3  [TPS] and the subsequent termination of that temporary status does not impose \n4  regulatory obligations or restrictions on regulated entities, or impose penalties for the \n5  violation of those obligations or restrictions.”  Opp’n at 11, 13.   \n6  This argument is not convincing for two reasons.  First, although there are cases in which \n7  regulated entities have challenged regulating agency policy or practices, there are also cases in \n8  which the challenging party is not a regulated entity – including California Trout, Bonneville \n9  Power, and Wild Horse.  For example, the plaintiffs in California Trout were organizations \n10  designed to preserve California’s wild trout populations and to preserve California’s rivers; they \n11  argued that an agency’s denial of their ability to intervene in a license renewal proceeding for a \n12  dam operator was arbitrary and capricious.  See Cal. Trout, 572 F.3d at 1011; see also Bonneville \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Power, 477 F.3d at 672 (plaintiff-environmental groups challenging an action of the federal \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  agency that operates dams on the Columbia River – i.e., transferring the functions of the Fish \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Passage Center to other entities); Wild Horse, 873 F.3d at 922 (plaintiff-advocates for the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  protection of wild horses asserting that the Forest Service’s revision of the Devil’s Garden Wild \nS d nr\nee 17  Horse Territory violated various federal statutes).  Second, TPS beneficiaries clearly have a stake \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  in whether their countries of origin maintain their TPS designations.  A person cannot become a \n19  TPS beneficiary unless he or she is, in the first place, “a national . . . of a foreign state” with a TPS \n20  designation.  8 C.F.R. § 244.2(a).  Therefore, TPS beneficiaries have a sufficient interest – as \n21  much interest as any regulated entity – to challenge the agency actions: here DHS’s decisions to \n22  terminate TPS designations.   \n23  In its opposition, the government contends that, to the extent TPS beneficiaries are \n24  regulated, the only rules to which APA procedural requirements attach are the regulations found in \n25  8 C.F.R. Part 244, which expressly apply to TPS beneficiaries.  See, e.g., 8 C.F.R. § 244.2 \n26  (providing that “an alien may in the discretion of the director be granted [TPS] if the alien \n27  establishes” certain facts); id. § 244.10 (providing, inter alia, that “USCIS will grant temporary \n28  treatment benefits to the applicant if the applicant establishes prima facie eligibility for [TPS]” and \n18 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 19 of 43\n \n1  that, if TPS is denied, the alien may appeal).  But the government offers no principled reason why \n2  the APA’s procedural requirements attach to these regulations only.  Even though these \n3  regulations deal with TPS beneficiaries specifically, that does not mean that TPS beneficiaries are \n4  not impacted by rules that relate to TPS designations more broadly, including the practices and \n5  policies at issue here.  As noted above, broader rules on TPS designations do impact TPS \n6  beneficiaries since a TPS beneficiary’s status is dependent on a TPS designation.    \n7  The government protests that, even if Plaintiffs are allowed to challenge the process related \n8  to a TPS designation, they have still failed to show that there is any new policy or practice that \n9  would trigger the APA’s procedural requirements (i.e., an acknowledgment of the change in policy \n10  or practice and an explanation thereof).  According to the government, there have simply been \n11  “variations in how different Secretaries render their fact-intensive TPS determinations” – “at most \n12  a difference in emphasis rather than what could plausibly be considered a ‘new rule.’”  Opp’n at \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  11.  The Court disagrees.  There is a wealth of record evidence to support Plaintiffs’ position that \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  the DHS changed its practices with regard to TPS designations – notably, evidence beyond a \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  comparison of the Federal Register Notices on TPS designations before and after the Trump \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  administration took over which this Court previously undertook.  See Docket No. 55 (Order at 27-\nS d nr\nee 17  33) (noting, inter alia, that “[p]rior to October 2017, extension and/or re-designation notices \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  indicate that DHS consistently considered, at the very least, whether intervening events had \n19  frustrated or impeded recovery efforts from the originating conditions in Sudan, Haiti, Nicaragua, \n20  and El Salvador”; in contrast, “the termination notices for Sudan, Haiti, Nicaragua, and El \n21  Salvador [under the Trump administration] are curt and fail to address numerous conditions that \n22  justified extensions of TPS status in the most recent notices issued by prior administrations”).  The \n23  comparative table set forth in this Court’s prior order is relevant here.  See Docket No. 55 (Order \n24  at 30-32). \n25  Since that order, Plaintiffs have developed additional evidence of a change in DHS process \n26  and policy.  For example, Leon Rodriguez, a former USCIS director, testified that, both before and \n27  during his tenure at USCIS, there was no agency policy or practice that precluded “consideration \n28  of the full range of current country conditions” in assessing whether a TPS designation should be \n19 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 20 of 43\n \n1  terminated or extended.  Rodriguez Decl. ¶ 17 (emphasis added).  \n \n2  Rather, USCIS had broad discretion to consider current conditions \nin the subject country.  Intervening factors arising after a country’s \n3  original TPS designation, such as subsequent natural disasters, \nissues of governance, housing, health care, poverty, crime, general \n4  security, and other humanitarian considerations were considered \nrelevant to determining whether a country continued to meet the \n5  conditions for continuing TPS designation.  This was true regardless \nof whether those intervening factors had any connection to the event \n6  that formed the basis for the original designation or to the country’s \nrecovery from that originating event. \n7   \n8  Rodriguez Decl. ¶ 17 (emphasis added).  See, e.g., Degen Decl., Exs. 125-26 (Decision Memos, \n9  signed by Mr. Rodriguez while USCIS director) (recommending extensions for Nicaragua and El \n10  Salvador because of “subsequent environmental disasters”). \n11  Evidence that DHS/USCIS under the Trump administration changed the above practice – \n12  now disregarding current conditions if they are not the originating condition or directly related to \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  the originating condition – is substantiated by the following: \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  •  On April 14, 2017, a career USCIS staff member sent an email to a senior RAIO \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  official regarding Haiti’s TPS designation.  The staff member indicated that the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  decision regarding Haiti “was a political one . . . . Their position was that Haiti was \nS d nr\nee 17  designated on account of the 2010 earthquake, and those conditions have \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  significantly improved.  The extraordinary conditions Haiti currently faces are \n19  longstanding, intractable problems, not ‘temporary’ as the statute requires.”  \n20  Degen Reply Decl., Ex. 124 (email) (emphasis added). \n21  •  On May 22, 2017, there was a press call on Haiti’s TPS designation.  During the \n22  call, there were reporter questions about, e.g., what “evidence and information that \n23  the [DHS] Secretary looked at to make the decision and what went into his \n24  determination that conditions were improving.”  Degen Decl., Ex. 17 (email, with \n25  attachment).  “The most common response [from DHS] was that the Secretary was \n26  doing exactly what Congress asked us to do via the INA and that is to determine \n27  whether conditions that led to Haiti’s initial designation in 2010 remain.”  Degen \n28  Decl., Ex. 17 (email, with attachment) (emphasis added). \n20 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 21 of 43\n \n1  •  On May 23, 2017, an email was sent from USCIS to OP&S which provided \n2  guidance from the DHS Secretary with respect to “drafting response letters \n3  regarding TPS for Haiti.”  Degen Reply Decl., Ex. 127 (email).  “‘From S1 [the \n4  Secretary], make case as such: Highlight temporary nature; 2010 Earthquake is the \n5  only reason for TPS being granted – Not based on hurricane, or current economic \n6  conditions – Not based on cholera epidemic.’  Suggested language, ‘As you know, \n7  granting TPS was based solely on 2010 earthquake that ravaged Port au Prince.  \n8  Primarily localized damage in capital region of Port au Prince.  Recovery slow but \n9  steady, UN has determined their stabilization force is no longer needed.  Decision \n10  to rebuild palace shows economic [sic] is recovering.’”  Degen Reply Decl., Ex. \n11  127 (email) (emphasis added).   \n12  •  On June 6, 2017, then-DHS Secretary Kelly testified before the Senate Homeland \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and was asked whether DHS was \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  “going to look at the situation that started temporary protected status, and ask if that \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  situation has changed.”  Degen Decl., Ex. 35 (Tr. at 69).  Secretary Kelly \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  responded: “[O]nce someone goes on this status, they – traditionally or historically, \nS d nr\nee 17  they just renew it”; “some of the Central Americans have been on status over 20 \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  years, and they were put on status because of a hurricane that happened over 20 \n19  years ago.  [¶] I can tell you that things are going better in Central America, much, \n20  much better over the last 20 years, in many ways better.  But no one’s every looked \n21  at it.  And I think that’s something – we have to do that.”  Degen Decl., Ex. 35 (Tr. \n22  at 70).  Secretary Kelly continued: “[A]nd the program is for a specific event.  In – \n23  in Haiti, it was the earthquake.  Yes, Haiti had horrible conditions before the \n24  earthquake, and those conditions aren’t much better after the earthquake.  But the \n25  earthquake was why TPS was – was granted and – and that’s how I have to look at \n26  it.”  Degen Decl., Ex. 35 (Tr. at 70) (emphasis added). \n27  •  On November 6, 2017, Acting Secretary Duke wrote an email to White House \n28  Chief of Staff Kelly, informing him of her decisions on TPS for Nicaragua and \n21 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 22 of 43\n \n1  Honduras (terminate and extend for six months, respectively).  She noted that her \n2  decisions “will send a clear signal that TPS in general is coming to a close” – “a \n3  strong break with past practice.”  Degen Decl., Ex. 30 (email). \n4  •  On November 6, 2017, there was a moderated press call regarding Acting Secretary \n5  Duke’s decisions on Nicaragua and Honduras’s TPS designations.  See Degen \n6  Decl., Ex. 31 (transcript).  During the call, Mr. Hoffman (the Assistant Secretary of \n7  Public Affairs at DHS) was asked the following question: “If you talk to immigrant \n8  advocates in the Central American community, they’ll raise the issue of creasing \n9  violence in Central America in the northern triangle and while that was not the \n10  cause for the initial TPS, they say that that warrants continuing the program.  Is that \n11  a factor that you are considering?”  Degen Decl., Ex. 31 (Tr. at 8).  Mr. Hoffman \n12  responded: “So, under the Statute, the INA restricts considerations for continuing \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  designation of TPS to the conditions on the ground as impacted by the initial event, \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  whether it’s a civil war or a natural disaster.  So, the conditions on the ground and \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  how they were impacted by that event is what we have to consider under the State.  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  I will say that if individuals believe that there are other reasons that they cannot \nS d nr\nee 17  return, there are other avenues available and they can apply for other immigration \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  benefits outside of TPS.”  Degen Decl., Ex. 31 (Tr. at 8) (emphasis added). \n19  •  In January 2018, DHS Secretary Nielsen testified before the Senate Judicial \n20  Committee, noting that “[w]e did not talk generally about the country conditions, \n21  and I want to be very clear on this.  The law does not allow me to look at the \n22  country conditions of a country, writ large”; rather, “[i]t requires me to look very \n23  specifically as to whether the country conditions originating from the original \n24  designation continue to exist” so, for El Salvador, “we didn’t dispute the country \n25  conditions are difficult . . . , but unfortunately, the law requires me, if I cannot say \n26  that the conditions emanating from the earthquakes still exist, regardless of other \n27  systemic conditions, I must terminate TPS.”  Degen Decl., Ex. 36 (Tr. at 26) \n28  (emphasis added). \n22 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 23 of 43\n \n1  •  In April 2018, DHS Secretary Nielsen testified before the House Appropriations \n2  Subcommittee on Homeland Security.  She was asked about the termination of \n3  Haiti’s TPS designation – more specifically, “[H]ow can we possibly rationalize \n4  sending 59,000 people back to those kinds of conditions?” which included \n5  “political violence” and “civil unrest” such that the DOS has a “level three travel \n6  advisory for Haiti, meaning that people should reconsider any plans to travel there \n7  because of the conditions on the ground.”  Degen Decl., Ex. 34 (Tr. at 47).  \n8  Secretary Nielsen responded in part as follows: “[T]he law really restricts my \n9  ability to extend TPS.  The law says that if the effects of the originating event, so \n10  that’s a causation issue, do not continue to exist then the secretary of Homeland \n11  Security must terminate.”  Degen Decl., Ex. 34 (Tr. at 47) (emphasis added). \n12  •  The Decision Memos for the countries at issue reference recovery from the \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  originating condition as the basis for termination and, in three out of four instances, \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  explicitly reject consideration of current country conditions not directly related \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  thereto.7  See, e.g.,  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  ❖  Degen Decl., Ex. 45 (Haiti Decision Memo at 1, 5) (noting that Haiti was \nS d nr\nee 17 \nth\ninUtro                                                  \nN 18 \n7 The Country Conditions Memos, which the government does not dispute were prepared by \ncareer DHS/RAIO employees rather than political appointees, did not limit discussion of country \n19 \nconditions to those only directly related to the originating conditions for the TPS designations.  \nSee, e.g., Haiti AR at 46-47 (noting that “Haiti has also experienced various setbacks that have \n20 \nimpeded its recovery, including a cholera epidemic and the impact of Hurricane Matthew”;

“current \n5  challenges cannot be directly tied to damage from the earthquakes”). \n6  A particularly telling communication is an internal email exchange within DHS/OP&S, \n7  dated October 13, 2017.  Ms. Kovarik (Chief of OP&S) stated that, with respect to the draft \n8  Decision Memos for what appear to be Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador, there was a \n9  “problem” in that the memos “read[] as though we’d recommend an extension b/c we talk so much \n10  about how bad it is, but there’s not enough in there about positive steps that have been taken since \n11  it’s designation.”  Degen Decl., Ex. 2 (email).  A responsive email from a career employee stated: \n12  “We can comb through the country conditions to try to see what else there might be, but the basic \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  problem is that it IS bad there [with respect to] all of the standard metrics.  Our strongest \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  argument for termination, we thought, is just that it is not bad in a way clearly linked to the initial \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  disasters prompting the designations.  We can work with RU to try to get more, and/or comb \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  through the country conditions we have again looking for positive gems, but the conditions are \nS d nr\nee 17  what they are.”  Degen Decl., Ex. 2 (email) (emphasis added). \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  The government makes much of the fact that Acting Secretary Duke – who made the TPS \n19  decisions on Haiti, Sudan, and Nicaragua – was given information about current conditions (and \n20  from many different sources), see Opp’n at 4-5; that Acting Secretary Duke was required to \n21  consider current conditions per the TPS statute (e.g., in the case of an environmental disaster, to \n22  assess whether the country of origin could adequately handle the return of its nationals); and that \n23  Acting Secretary Duke did give current conditions weight as reflected by her November 2017 \n24  decision not to terminate Honduras’s TPS designation and extend it for six months.   \n25  However, the fact that Acting Secretary Duke received information regarding current \n26  conditions, does not prove she ultimately considered and relied on those conditions in deciding to \n27  terminate TPS status.  The substantial record recited above strongly suggests she did not.  As to \n28  the government’s new claim that the Acting Secretary (or Secretary) was now required under TPS \n25 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 26 of 43\n \n1  statute to consider country conditions other than the triggering condition, that assertion is belied \n2  by the record evidence above.  It is also not supported by any reference by the Acting Secretary or \n3  Secretary to any document acknowledging any such requirement. \n4  As to Honduras, the Court notes that (1) Honduras was given only a brief extension of six \n5  months; (2) Honduras’s TPS designation was eventually terminated; (3) whether a foreign country \n6  can adequately handle the return of its nationals is – at least arguably – a secondary issue, separate \n7  and distinct from whether the originating condition or conditions directly related thereto persist; \n8  (4) Acting Secretary Duke’s November 2017 decision did not disavow the general approach that a \n9  TPS designation must ultimately be terminated if the existence of the originating condition or \n10  conditions directly related do not exist; and (5) Acting Secretary Duke seemed to endorse that \n11  approach, stating, in an email dated November 6, 2017, that her actions on Honduras were “a \n12  strong break with past practice . . . . By not affirmatively extending, I’m stating that I’m not \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  satisfied that the country conditions remain – but not yet sure how to best end TPS for this \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  country.”  Degen Decl., Ex. 30 (email).  Finally, regardless of what Acting Secretary Duke did \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  with respect to Honduras, the fact remains that she did not grant any extension for Haiti, Sudan, \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  and Nicaragua and that, as reflected in the Federal Register Notices related to the termination of \nS d nr\nee 17  those countries’ TPS designations, termination largely turned on whether the originating condition \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  or conditions directly related thereto persisted. \n19  Accordingly, the Court concludes that not only have Plaintiffs have shown serious \n20  questions going to the merits, they have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits for \n21  their APA claim.  DHS made a deliberate choice to base the TPS decision solely on whether the \n22  originating conditions or conditions directly related thereto persisted, regardless of other current \n23  conditions no matter how bad, and that this was a clear departure from prior administration \n24  practice.9  This departure was a substantial and consequential change in practice – indeed, as the \n25 \n                                                 \n26 \n9 In their briefs, Plaintiffs also describe other changes in the TPS decision-making process.  These \nchanges are more relevant to the Equal Protection claim and therefore are addressed there.  \n27 \nHowever, the Court acknowledges that the changes in the TPS decision-making process do have \nsome probative value for the APA claim as well – i.e., the changes underscore that there was a \n28 \nconscious choice by DHS under the Trump administration to take a different approach. \n26 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 27 of 43\n \n1  government now argues, it could violate the TPS statute itself.  The government has offered no \n2  explanation or justification for this change.  The evidence submitted by Plaintiffs (discussed above \n3  and below) suggests this change may have been made in order to implement and justify a pre-\n4  ordained result. \n5  In light of the balance of hardships, which, as discussed above, tips sharply in Plaintiffs’ \n6  favor, Plaintiffs are entitled to a preliminary injunction based on their showing on the merits of the \n7  APA claim. \n8  2.  Equal Protection Claim \n9  Regarding the Equal Protection claim, the Court finds that there are, at the very least, \n10  serious questions going to the merits, thus justifying the issuance of a preliminary injunction on an \n11  independent ground. \n12  a.  Arlington Heights \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  In its order denying the government’s motion to dismiss, the Court held that Village of \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252 (1977) – and not \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392 (2018) – provides the governing legal standard.  See Docket No. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  55 (Order at 44-45).  Under Arlington Heights, “[p]roof of a racially discriminatory intent or \nS d nr\nee 17  purpose of required to show a violation of the Equal Protection Clause,” and, “[w]hen there is \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  proof that a discriminatory purpose has been a motivating factor in the [government’s] decision, . . \n19  . judicial deference [to that decision] is no longer justified.”  Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 265-\n20  66.  Arlington Heights sets forth various factors to consider in discerning whether the decision at \n21  issue was based on an impermissible purpose. \n22  Here, Plaintiffs have provided sufficient evidence to raise serious questions as to whether a \n23  discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor in the decisions to terminate the TPS designations.  \n24  In particular, Plaintiffs have provided evidence indicating that (1) the DHS Acting Secretary or \n25  Secretary was influenced by President Trump and/or the White House in her TPS decision-making \n26  and (2) President Trump has expressed animus against non-white, non-European immigrants.  As \n27  this Court noted, even if the DHS Secretary or Acting Secretary did not “personally harbor animus \n28  . . . , their actions may violate the equal protection guarantee if President Trump’s alleged animus \n27 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 28 of 43\n \n1  influenced or manipulated their decisionmaking process.”  Docket No. 55 (Order at 43). \n2  As to the first issue, Plaintiffs have pointed to several pieces of evidence suggesting that \n3  the White House was putting pressure on DHS to end TPS.  For example, there is evidence that \n4  “the White House was keenly interested in the [DHS] Secretary’s decisions related to TPS,” \n5  Degen Decl., Ex. 12 (Nealon Depo. at 89-90), and that Stephen Miller, “an important [senior] \n6  adviser to the President and the White House,” “frequently” reached out to Chad Wolf, the DHS \n7  Chief of Staff, about TPS, Degen Decl., Ex. 85 (Nealon Depo. at 288, 297, 300), as well as Gene \n8  Hamilton, the Senior Counselor to the DHS Secretary.  On more than one occasion, Mr. Hamilton \n9  stated that “Mr. Miller favored the termination of TPS.”  Degen Decl., Ex. 85 (Nealon Depo. at \n10  292). \n11  As another example, shortly before Acting Secretary Duke was to make a decision on the \n12  TPS designations for Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador, a White House Principals Meeting \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  was held to discuss the TPS designations.10  It appears that attendees included high-level White \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  House officials such as Chief of Staff Kelly, then-Principal Deputy Chief of Staff Nielsen, and \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Press Secretary Sanders.  A memo distributed by the White House National Security Council in \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  advance of the meeting recommended that the TPS designations be terminated and that Congress \nS d nr\nee 17  be engaged “to pass a comprehensive immigration reform to include a merit based entry system.”  \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Degen Decl., Ex. 14 (NSC Memo at 2).  The National Security Council recommendation to \n19  terminate TPS status was given to Acting Secretary Duke.  See Degen Decl., Ex. 29 (Memo at 2).  \n20  In addition, White House Chief of Staff Kelly subsequently had a conversation with Acting \n21  Secretary Duke about the TPS designations for the Central American countries.11  See Degen \n22 \n                                                 \n10 A Principals Meeting is “a meeting of people at the cabinet level to coordinate policy.”  Docket \n23 \nNo. 117-4 (Martin Decl., Ex. 4) (Nealon Depo. at 340). \n \n24 \n11 The Washington Post reported that White House Chief of Staff Kelly had put pressure on \nActing Secretary Duke to terminate Honduras’s TPS designation.  See Degen Decl., Ex. 28 \n25 \n(Washington Post article, dated November 9, 2017).  The Court acknowledges, however, that, in \nan email that was eventually passed on to Acting Secretary Duke, White House Chief of Staff \n26 \nKelly maintained that he merely told Acting Secretary Duke that the decision was hers and that he \nwould recommend a limited extension no longer than twelve months for the Central American \n27 \ncountries.  See Martin Decl., Ex. 3 (email) (White House Chief of Staff maintaining that he simply \nconveyed that his “view was to grant limited (no more than 12 months or so [versus] the \n28 \nmaximum 18 months allowed by the TPS program) to the Central American TPS recipients who \n28 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 29 of 43\n \n1  Decl., Ex. 30 (email).   \n2  That the White House did, in fact, have influence on the TPS decisions is supported by the \n3  fact that, soon after the above, Acting Secretary Duke terminated the TPS designation for \n4  Nicaragua.  Also, Acting Secretary Duke essentially indicated to White House Chief of Staff Kelly \n5  that Honduras’s TPS designation would eventually be terminated as well, although she was not, at \n6  that point, formally terminating that country’s status.  See Degen Decl., Ex. 30 (email) (stating \n7  that, “[b]y not affirmatively extending [Honduras’s TPS designation], I’m stating that I’m not \n8  satisfied that the country conditions remain – but not yet sure how to best end TPS for this \n9  country”; also stating that “[t]hese decisions along with the public statements will send a clear \n10  signal that TPS in general is coming to a close”) (emphasis added).   \n11  Notably, Acting Secretary Duke’s writings suggest that she, in her role at DHS, was \n12  largely carrying out or conforming with a predetermined presidential agenda to end TPS.  For \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  example, in a November 2017 email to White House Chief of Staff Kelly, in which she reported \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  on her decision to terminate for Nicaragua and temporarily extend for Honduras, Acting Secretary \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Duke stated that “[t]hese decisions along with the public statements will send a clear signal that \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  TPS in general is coming to a close.  I believe it is consistent with the President’s position on \nS d nr\nee 17  immigration . . . .”  Degen Decl., Ex. 30 (email) (emphasis added).  She added: “[T]his decision is \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  really just a difference in strategy to get to the President’s objectives.”  Degen Decl., Ex. 30 \n19  (email) (emphasis added).  In a subsequent email to White House Chief of Staff Kelly, Acting \n20  Secretary Duke noted that Tom Bossert of the White House National Security Council had \n21  “informed me of a strategy I was not previously aware of” and she had now “incorporated this \n22  new information into my final decision.”12  Degen Decl., Ex. 30 (email).  In a draft memo \n23  regarding her TPS decisions, Acting Secretary Duke was equally direct:  “The TPS program must \n24  end for these countries soon . . . . [¶] This conclusion is the result of an America first view of the \n25 \n                                                 \nhave been here for 20 years,” and that he simply told Acting Secretary Duke to make a decision – \n26 \nand “[t]hat the decision on TPS was entirely hers”). \n \n27 \n12 Cf. Degen Reply Decl., Ex. 135 (email) (Acting Secretary Duke stating that there was an \n“internal controversy . . . at least in part because there was a WH strategy that DHS, and me as the \n28 \ndecision maker, wasn’t informed of”). \n29 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 30 of 43\n \n1  TPS decision.”  Degen Decl., Ex. 29 Memo at 1 (emphasis added).   \n2  Because there is evidence that President Trump and/or the White House influenced the \n3  DHS on the TPS decisions to at least raise serious question on the merits, the remaining issue is \n4  whether there is evidence that President Trump harbors an animus against non-white, non-\n5  European aliens which influenced his (and thereby the Secretary’s) decision to end the TPS \n6  designation.  As Plaintiffs have catalogued, there is evidence of such as reflected by statements \n7  made by President Trump before, during, and after the TPS decision-making process13: \n8  •  In June 2015, Mr. Trump announced that he was running for President and \n9  delivered remarks characterizing Mexican immigrants as drug dealers or users, \n10  criminals, and rapists.  See Degen Decl., Ex. 92 (Washington Post article). \n11  •  “In December 2015, [Mr.] Trump called for ‘a total and complete shutdown of \n12  Muslims entering the United States.’”  Degen Decl., Ex. 95 (New York Times \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  article). \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  •  In June 2017, President Trump stated that “15,000 recent immigrants from Haiti \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  ‘all have AIDS’ and that 40,000 Nigerians, once seeing the United States, would \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  never ‘go back to their huts’ in Africa.”  Degen Decl., Ex. 95 (New York Times \nS d nr\nee 17  article).  \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  •  On January 11, 2018, during a meeting with lawmakers where immigrants from \n19  Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries were discussed, including with respect to \n20  TPS designations that had been terminated, President Trump asked: “‘Why are we \n21  having all these people from shithole countries come here?’  [He] then suggested \n22 \n                                                 \n13 The government has objected to “hearsay excerpts from newspaper articles and similar sources.”  \n23 \nOpp’n at 10.  However, the objection lacks merit for several reasons. \n \n24 \n  First, Plaintiffs cited the statements in their complaint, but the government did not clearly \ndeny them in the answer.  See, e.g., Ans. ¶ 66 (“Defendants aver that any such statements speak \n25 \nfor themselves.”).  Second, it is not apparent that President Trump’s statements are even hearsay in \nthe first place.  See Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2) (providing that an opposing party’s statement, when \n26 \noffered against the opposing party, is not hearsay).  Finally, as Plaintiffs point out, the Ninth \nCircuit has held that “[a] district court may . . . consider hearsay in deciding whether to issue a \n27 \npreliminary injunction” – in fact, “‘may give even inadmissible evidence some weight, when to do \nso serves the purpose of preventing irreparable harm before trial.’”  Johnson v. Couturier, 572 \n28 \nF.3d 1067, 1083 (9th Cir. 2009). \n30 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 31 of 43\n \n1  that the United States should instead bring more people from countries such as \n2  Norway,” which has a predominantly white population.  Degen Decl., Ex. 96 \n3  (Washington Post article).  He also told lawmakers that immigrants from Haiti \n4  “must be left out of any deal.”  Degen Decl., Ex. 96 (Washington Post article).   \n5  •  In February 2018, President Trump gave a speech at the annual Conservative \n6  Political Action Conference where he used MS-13 – a gang with many members \n7  having ties to Mexico and Central America – to disparage immigrants, indicating \n8  that that they are criminals and comparing them to snakes.  See Degen Decl., Ex. \n9  93 (article from www.vox.com); see also Degen Decl., Ex. 98 (New York Times \n10  article) (stating that President Trump characterized undocumented immigrants as \n11  “‘animals’”).   \n12  •  In July 2018, President Trump told European leaders that “they ‘better watch \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  themselves’ because a wave of immigration of ‘changing the culture’ of their \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  countries,’” which he characterized as being “‘a very negative thing for Europe.’”  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Degen Decl., Ex. 99 (Washington Post article). \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  See also Centro Presente, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 122509, at *15-19 (cataloguing evidence of \nS d nr\nee 17  possible animus, including but not limited to those identified above). \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  The Court also notes that not only is there direct evidence of animus, but there is also \n19  circumstantial evidence of race being a motivating factor.  Under Arlington Heights, \n20  circumstantial evidence of a discriminatory intent can be inferred from, e.g., “[t]he impact of the \n21  official action – whether it bears more heavily on one race than another”; “[t]he historical \n22  background of the decision” and “[t]he specific sequence of events leading up to the challenged \n23  decision”; and “[d]epartures from the normal procedural sequence.”  Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. \n24  at 266-67 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In the instant case, consideration of these factors \n25  weighs in favor of Plaintiffs. \n26  First, the impact of the TPS terminations clearly bears more heavily on non-white, non-\n27  European individuals; indeed, it affects those populations exclusively. \n28  Also, the sequence of events leading up to the challenged decisions are irregular and \n31 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 32 of 43\n \n1  suggestive of a pre-determined outcome not based on an objective assessment.  The record \n2  evidence indicates that, after receiving Decision Memos from career DHS employees, higher-level \n3  DHS employees – i.e., the political appointees – were “repackaging” the memos in order to get to \n4  the President/White House’s desired result of terminating TPS.  This was especially apparent with \n5  respect to the process on Sudan. \n6  •  On August 17, 2017, USCIS submitted a Decision Memo on Sudan to the Acting \n7  DHS Secretary.  (The memo was signed by James McCament, the USCIS Deputy \n8  Director and then-Acting USCIS Director.)  In the memo, USCIS noted that the \n9  State Department had submitted a draft package to the Secretary of State and that \n10  the draft package “assesses that the statutory conditions supporting Sudan’s TPS \n11  designation continue to be met and recommends an 18-month extension of Sudan’s \n12  designation for TPS.”  Degen Decl., Ex. 40 (Decision Memo at 1).  USCIS further \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  indicated that, per its own country conditions report, “the ongoing armed conflict \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  and temporary conditions that supported Sudan’s designation for TPS persist.”  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Degen Decl., Ex. 40 (Decision Memo at 1).  USCIS concluded the memo by listing \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  the Acting Secretary’s options – i.e., extend, redesignate, or terminate.  Although \nS d nr\nee 17  USCIS did not formally make a recommendation at that time, it did note, under the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  extend option, that “[t]he review of conditions in Sudan indicates that it remains \n19  unsafe for individuals to return to Sudan and that the statutory requirements to \n20  designate a country for TPS under Immigration and Nationalit Act § 244(b)(1)(A) \n21  (ongoing armed conflict) and under § 244(b)(1)(C) (extraordinary and temporary \n22  conditions) continue to be met.”  Degen Decl., Ex. 40 (Decision Memo at 4) \n23  (emphasis added).  Similarly, under the terminate option, USCIS stated: “Because \n24  the conditions supporting Sudan’s TPS designation persist, termination does not \n25  appear to be warranted.”  Degen Decl., Ex. 40 (Decision Memo at 5) (emphasis \n26  added). \n27  •  A week and a half later, on August 28, 2017, USCIS submitted a second Decision \n28  Memo on Sudan to the Acting DHS Secretary.  In the memo, USCIS reiterated \n32 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 33 of 43\n \n1  largely reiterated all of the above – but in spite of such, USCIS now made a formal \n2  recommendation that Sudan’s TPS designation be terminated.  Degen Decl., Ex. \n3  41 (Decision Memo at 5). \n4  •  The very next day, August 29, 2018, Frank Cissna, who would later become the \n5  USCIS Director, sent an email noting that the Decision Memo “seems a bit \n6  confused” – i.e., the extend and terminate options indicated that TPS should be \n7  extended but the recommendation came to the opposite conclusion.  Degen Decl., \n8  Ex. 1 (email).  Mr. Cissna added: “The memo reads like one person who strongly \n9  supports extending TPS for Sudan wrote everything up to the recommendation \n10  section, and then someone who opposes extension snuck up behind the first guy, \n11  clubbed him over the head, pushed his senseless body out of the way, and finished \n12  the memo.  Am I missing something?”  Degen Decl., Ex. 1 (email) (emphasis \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  added).  \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  •  The same day, Kathy Kovarik, the Chief of OP&S (a political appointee), \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  informed Mr. Hamilton, the Senior Counselor to the DHS Secretary (and another \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  political appointee), that she was to blame: “The options memo went up, and \nS d nr\nee 17  because of our rush to add recommendations, I didn’t catch the contradiction.  \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  How would like you us to proceed?”  Degen Decl., Ex. 48 (email).  Mr. \n19  Hamilton’s response was: “We need to repackage.”  Degen Decl., Ex. 48 (email). \n20  •  On September 1, 2017, the Decision Memo was “repackaged” and included a \n21  recommendation to extend Sudan’s TPS designation for six months.  See Degen \n22  Decl., Ex. 27 (email and attachment).  In the memo, USCIS noted that the Deputy \n23  Secretary of State recommended a six-month extension because “the statutory \n24  conditions supporting Sudan’s TPS designation continue to be met.”  Degen Decl., \n25  Ex. 27 (Decision Memo at 1).  USCIS further noted that, per its own country \n26  conditions report, “the ongoing armed conflict and extraordinary and temporary \n27  conditions that supported Sudan’s designation for TPS persist.”  Degen Decl., Ex. \n28  27 (Decision Memo at 2).  Finally, USCIS made its own recommendation that a \n33 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 34 of 43\n \n1  six-month extension be given because, inter alia, the Deputy Secretary of State \n2  had recommended such and because USCIS had “assesse[d] the conditions related \n3  to the most recent designation continue to be met,” that is, “there is an ongoing \n4  armed conflict limited to certain parts of Sudan and extraordinary and temporary \n5  conditions continue to exist preventing nationals from returning in safety.”  Degen \n6  Decl., Ex. 27 (Decision Memo at 5).  That recommendation, however, was \n7  apparently not satisfactory to Mr. Hamilton, the Senior Counselor to the DHS \n8  Acting Secretary.  Thus, following a discussion with Mr. Hamilton, Mr. \n9  McCament, the Acting USCIS Director, prepared a new Decision Memo “to \n10  clearly support the AS1 decision to terminate with a delayed effective date of 12 \n11  months.”  Degen Decl., Ex. 27 (email). \n12  •  In the new Decision Memo, USCIS acknowledged the recommendation of the \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Deputy Secretary of State (a six-month extension) but now stated that its review of \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  country conditions indicated that there was “emerging progress and improvement \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  in certain areas while noted challenges remain.”  Degen Decl., Ex. 87 (Decision \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Memo at 2).  Ultimately, USCIS recommended that Sudan’s TPS designation be \nS d nr\nee 17  terminated with a delayed effective date by twelve months.  Included as support \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  for the recommendation was the statement that “[t]here is ongoing conflict in some \n19  regions, but not the entire country.”  Degen Decl., Ex. 87 (Decision Memo at 6).  \n20  USCIS did not explain, however, whether it made an assessment of any kind as to \n21  whether some TPS beneficiaries would likely be returned to those unsafe areas \n22  where conflict persisted. \n23  •  Subsequently, DHS took steps to prepare the Federal Register Notice for the \n24  termination.  Following an edit of the notice by Mr. Hamilton (the Senior \n25  Counselor to the Acting DHS Secretary), a DHS career employee noted that, \n26  “based on what we’ve seen to date, [the] State [Department] would likely object to \n27  the removal of human rights violations – pared down as the language already was \n28  – that was in there.  For our part, we’d just say that this could be read as taking \n34 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 35 of 43\n \n1  another step toward providing an incomplete and lopsided country conditions \n2  presentation to support termination, which may increase the likelihood of criticism \n3  from external stakeholders to that effect.”  Degen Decl., Ex. 5 (email). \n4  •  The DHS career employee rightly noted that the State Department would have \n5  concerns about the Federal Register Notice.  The State Department stated that it \n6  believed there were “some significant mischaracterizations that are at odds with \n7  the Department’s understanding of circumstances on the ground.”  Degen Decl., \n8  Ex. 7 (email); see also Degen Decl., Ex. 8 (email) (State Department again \n9  expressing concern about mischaracterizations and downplaying of the actual \n10  situation).  Mr. Hamilton responded that, while DHS would work to accommodate \n11  some of the State Department’s concerns, it would not do all, deeming many of the \n12  concerns as overblown and irrelevant to the legal determination for TPS \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  designation.  See Degen Decl., Ex. 9 (email).   \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  The TPS decision-making for the other countries underwent a similar process.  For \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  example, for the decisions on Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador, Ms. Kovarik, the Chief of \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  OP&S, complained that the Decision Memos “read[] as though we’d recommend an extension b/c \nS d nr\nee 17  we talk so much about how bad it is, but there’s not enough in there about positive steps that have \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  been taken since its designation.”  Degen Decl., Ex. 2 (email).  A career DHS employee \n19  responded:  \n \n20  We can comb through the country conditions to try to see what else \nthere might be, but the basis problem is that it IS bad wrt [with \n21  respect to] all of the standard metrics.  Our strongest argument for \ntermination, we thought, is just that it is not bad in a way clearly \n22  linked to the initial disasters prompting the designations.  We can \nwork with RU to try to get more, and/or comb through the country \n23  conditions we have again looking for positive gems, but the \nconditions are what they are \n24   \n25  Degen Decl., Ex. 2 (email).  After the career employee “cleaned up [the Central American] TPS \n26  decisions memos,” Degen Decl., Ex. 4 (email), Ms. Kovarik was still not satisfied with the \n27  repackaging, noting, e.g., that “disasters” should be changed to “challenges.”  Degen Decl., Ex. 4 \n28  (email). \n35 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 36 of 43\n \n1  For Haiti, the same career employee submitted a Decision Memo “written so that it could \n2  support either extension or termination, but left the recommendation blank, pending further \n3  discussion.”  Degen Decl., Ex. 3 (email).  Robert Law, a Senior Adviser to Ms. Kovarik, still \n4  responded:  \n \n5  The draft is overwhelming[ly] weighted for extension which I do not \nthink is the conclusion we are looking for.  The memo seems to \n6  dismiss or downlay the positive developments that should suggest \nreauthorization is inappropriate.  The memo also makes no mention \n7  of the substantial amount of foreign aid the U.S. and charities have \ninvested in Haiti since the earthquake[,] another relevant factor to \n8  indicate that Haiti no longer meets the definition of TPS. \n9  Degen Decl., Ex. 3 (email).  Mr. Law then made edits to the Decision Memo: “I made the \n10  document fully support termination and provided comment boxes where additional data should be \n11  provided to back up this decision.”  Degen Decl., Ex. 3. \n12  And in addition to the above “repackaging,” Acting Secretary Duke expressly \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  acknowledged that the terminations of TPS designations were “a strong break with past practice,” \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Degen Decl., Ex. 30 (email) – designed to fit the President’s objectives on immigration which \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  would put “America first.”  See Degen Decl., Ex. 30 (email) (“These decisions along with the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  public statements will send a clear signal that TPS in general is coming to a close.  I believe it is \nS d nr\nee 17  consistent with the President’s position on immigration . . . .”) (emphasis added); Degen Decl., \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Ex. 29 (memo) (“The TPS program must end for these countries soon . . . . [¶] This conclusion is \n19  the result of an America first view of the TPS decision.”) (emphasis added).  This begs the \n20  question what “America first” means.  Plaintiffs suggest this is a code word for removal of \n21  immigrants who are non-white and/or non-European.  When the Court asked the government’s \n22  counsel at the hearing what “an America first view of the TPS decision” meant, counsel was \n23  unable to provide a clear and direct response.  See Docket No. 127 (Tr. at 69-70) (defense counsel \n24  arguing that Acting Secretary Duke was referring to “migration and . . . drug enforcement issues \n25  and a general kind of perspective” and that she was “grappling with the decision” on what to do \n26  about TPS). \n27  Finally, as discussed above in the context of the APA claim, there were departures from \n28  the normal procedural sequence during the TPS decision-making process; that is, instead of \n36 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 37 of 43\n \n1  considering all current country conditions as had been done in previous administrations, the DHS \n2  political appointees in the current administration made TPS decisions turn on whether the \n3  originating condition or conditions directly related thereto continued to exist, disregarding all \n4  other current conditions no matter how bad.  Moreover, at the apparent behest of then-DHS \n5  Secretary Kelly, there was an effort to gather negative information about Haitian TPS beneficiaries \n6  prior to the decision on Haiti’s TP designation – in particular, whether Haitian TPS beneficiaries \n7  had been convicted of crimes or were on public or private relief.  See Degen Decl., Ex. 84 (email).  \n8  There is no indication that these factors had previously been considered by DHS in making TPS \n9  decisions14; indeed, the email indicated that the request for the information should be kept quiet.  \n10  See Degen Decl., Ex. 84 (email) (“Please keep the prep for this briefing limited to those on this \n11  email.  If you need a specific data set and need to ask someone to pull it, please do not indicate \n12  what it is for.  I don’t want this to turn into a big thing were people start prodding and things start \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  leaking out.”).  The information sought by the Secretary coincides with racial stereotypes – i.e., \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  that non-whites commit crimes and are on the public dole.   \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Accordingly, the Court holds that, at the very least, the evidence submitted by Plaintiffs \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  supports serious questions on the merits on the Equal Protection Claim.  Combined with a balance \nS d nr\nee 17  of hardships that tips sharply in Plaintiffs’ favor, a preliminary injunction based on the Equal \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Protection claim (and not just the APA claim) is also warranted. \n19  b.  Trump v. Hawaii \n20  The government protests that the above analysis is incorrect because Arlington Heights \n21  does not provide the proper legal standard and that the Equal Protection claim should be evaluated \n22  based on the deferential standard articulated in Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2392.  But this is \n23  essentially a request for reconsideration of the Court’s prior order denying the government’s \n24 \n                                                 \n14 Although the government argues that such information is relevant to the “national interest of the \n25 \nUnited States,” 8 U.S.C. § 1254a(b), this appears to be a post-hoc justification.   Cf. Degen Reply \nDecl., Ex. 129 (email exchange, dated May 20, 2017) (in response to email recommending that, as \n26 \na talking point, the agency deny having used crime and public benefits data to make the TPS \ndecision on Haiti, acknowledging that “[w]e did try to dig up some data on crime and public \n27 \nbenefits” but proposing that “there is a fair argument that that sort of data could be considered \nunder the [TPS] statute . . . given the national interest component”).  No document presented to \n28 \nthis Court substantiates this was the purpose of the request. \n37 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 38 of 43\n \n1  motion to dismiss.  The Court shall not reconsider its earlier ruling because (1) the government has \n2  not formally moved to reconsider and (2) even if it had, it has not shown that the Court manifestly \n3  failed “to consider material facts or dispositive legal arguments which were presented to the Court \n4  before” it ruled on the motion to dismiss.  Civ. L.R. 7-9(b)(3).   \n5  However, even if the Court were to reconsider and take into account the government’s new \n6  argument, the government would still fare no better.  The Court previously held that a deferential \n7  standard was applied in Trump v. Hawaii because the case involved “the entry of aliens from \n8  outside the United States, express national security concerns[,] and active involvement of foreign \n9  policy.”  Docket No. 55 (Order at 50).  The instant case was distinguishable from Trump v. Hawaii \n10  because (1) there was no indication that national security or foreign policy was a reason to \n11  terminate TPS designations15; (2) unlike the aliens in Trump v. Hawaii, the aliens here (i.e., the \n12  TPS beneficiaries) are already in the United States and “aliens within the United States have \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  greater constitutional protections than those outside who are seeking admission for the first time”; \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  and (3) “the executive order in Trump [v. Hawaii] was issued pursuant to a very broad grant of \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  statutory discretion” whereas “Congress has not given the Secretary carte blanche to terminate \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  TPS for any reason whatsoever.”  Docket No. 55 (Order at 52-53); see also Docket No. 55 (Order \nS d nr\nee 17  at 53) (stating that Trump v. Hawaii “did not address the standard of review to be applied under \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  the equal protection doctrine when steps are taken to withdraw an immigration status or benefit \n19  from aliens lawfully present and admitted into the United States for reasons unrelated to national \n20  security or foreign affairs”) (emphasis in original).  In another TPS case pending in the District of \n21  Massachusetts, the district court made a similar analysis of Trump v. Hawaii.  See Centro \n22 \n                                                 \n15 The Court notes that the record evidence presented in conjunction with the preliminary \n23 \ninjunction motion continues to reflect that national security was not tendered as a reason to \nterminate TPS designation.  As for foreign policy, although the State Department provided DHS \n24 \nwith its evaluation of country of conditions and recommendations, and although Acting DHS \nSecretary did appear to consider foreign policy for at least the Central American TPS designations, \n25 \nultimately, the decisions to terminate (or, for Honduras, temporarily extend but with the indication \nthat termination would be forthcoming) were ultimately driven by the question of whether the \n26 \noriginating condition or conditions directly related thereto continued to exist.  Notably, the foreign \npolicy considerations appeared to warrant extension, not termination, of TPS status of the affected \n27 \ncountries.  In short, the termination decisions were not justified by foreign policy considerations.  \nIn contrast to the travel ban at issue in Trump v. Hawaii, the TPS statute was enacted primarily for \n28 \nhumanitarian reasons, not as a tool for foreign policy. \n38 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 39 of 43\n \n1  Presente, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 122509, at *44 (stating that the Supreme Court’s “decision to \n2  apply rational basis review [in Trump v. Hawaii] was based on two considerations not at issue \n3  here: first, the limited due process rights afforded to foreign nationals seeking entry into the \n4  United States and the particular deference accorded to the executive in making national security \n5  determinations”).  Applying Arlington Heights, the Massachusetts court found that there were \n6  sufficient allegations in the complaint to withstand the government’s motion to dismiss.  See id. at \n7  *56 (“find[ing] that the combination of a disparate impact on particular racial groups, statements \n8  of animus by people plausibly alleged to be involved in the decision-making process, and an \n9  allegedly unreasoned shift in policy sufficient to allege plausibly that a discriminatory purpose \n10  was a motivating factor in a decision”). \n11  The government argues that the Court’s analysis above is inconsistent with cases cited in \n12  Trump v. Hawaii, see Opp’n at 19-20 (arguing that Trump v. Hawaii “is not limited to executive \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  actions rooted in national security concerns or to actions restricting entry of foreign nationals”).  \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  The Court does not agree.   \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753 (1972), is a case that involved admission of an alien \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  into the United States, and thus is distinguishable from the instant case where the TPS \nS d nr\nee 17  beneficiaries are already lawfully present and admitted into the country.  In fact, the alien in \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Mandel was actually ineligible for a visa under the Immigration and Nationality Act (because of \n19  his advocacy of Communist doctrines) and could only enter the United States if he first obtained a \n20  waiver from the Attorney General.  See id. at 756-59.   \n21  Similarly, Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U.S. 787 (1977), is an admission case and is therefore \n22  distinguishable.  See id. at 790 n.3 (noting that appellants all sought immigrant visas on the basis \n23  of a parent-child relationship where the parent was the natural father and the child the illegitimate \n24  offspring).  The Court acknowledges that, in Fiallo, the appellants “characterize[d] [the Supreme \n25  Court’s] prior immigration cases as involving foreign policy matters and congressional choices to \n26  exclude or expel groups of aliens that were specifically and clearly perceived to pose a grave \n27  threat to the national security . . . or to the general welfare of this country” and that the Supreme \n28  Court noted there was  \n39 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 40 of 43\n \n \n1  no indication in our prior cases that the scope of judicial review is a \nfunction of the nature of the policy choice at issue.  To the contrary, \n2  [s]ince decisions in these matters may implicate our foreign powers, \nand since a wide variety of classifications must be defined in the \n3  light of changing political and economic circumstances, such \ndecisions are frequently of a character more appropriate to either the \n4  Legislature or the Executive than to the Judiciary, and [t]he reasons \nthat preclude judicial review of political questions also dictate a \n5  narrow standard of review of decisions made by the Congress or the \nPresident in the area of immigration and naturalization. \n6   \n7  Id. at 796 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Fiallo also contains other broad language that could \n8  be read unfavorably to Plaintiffs (i.e., suggesting limited judicial review).  See Fiallo, 430 U.S. at \n9  792 (“Our cases ‘have long recognized the power to expel or exclude aliens as a fundamental \n10  sovereign attribute exercised by the Government’s political departments largely immune from \n11  judicial control.’”).  However, this language of “expel” and “exclude” appears to be a dated or \n12  historical phrase, see Fong Yue Ting v. United States, 149 U.S. 698, 707 (1893) (indicating that \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  “‘[t]he control of the people within its limits, and the right to expel from its territory persons who \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  and dangerous to the peace of the State, are too clearly within the essential attributes of \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  sovereignty to be seriously contested’”), and does not detract from evolved and well-established \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  authority that aliens lawfully within the United States have rights from those seeking admission in \nS d nr\nee 17  the first instance into the United States.  See Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 693 (noting that “certain \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  constitutional protections available to persons inside the United States are unavailable to aliens \n19  outside of our geographic borders”); cf. Yamataya v. Fisher, 189 U.S. 86, 101 (1903) (stating that \n20  “it is not competent for the Secretary of the Treasury or any executive officer, at any time within \n21  the year limited by the statute, arbitrarily to cause an alien, who has entered the country, and has \n22  become subject in all respects to its jurisdiction, and a part of its population, although alleged to be \n23  illegally here, to be taken into custody and deported without giving him all opportunity to be heard \n24  upon the questions involving his right to be and remain in the United States”). \n25  In any event, this Court does not hold that Trump v. Hawaii inapplicable to the instant case \n26  solely because the decisions to terminate did not rest on national security – or foreign policy – \n27  concerns.  Rather, the Court’s holding is predicated on an amalgam of factors:  the fact that the \n28  TPS beneficiaries are living and have lived in the United States for lengthy periods with \n40 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 41 of 43\n \n1  established ties to the community, no foreign policy or national security interest has been relied \n2  upon the DHS to support its decision to terminate TPS status for the affected countries, and the \n3  TPS statute does not conferred unfettered authority upon the Secretary.  The justification for a \n4  kind of super deference advocated by the government in this case is not warranted.   \n5  Finally, Rajah v. Mukasey, 544 F.3d 427 (2d Cir. 2008), is distinguishable from the instant \n6  case as well.  Although Rajah, like the instant case, is not an admission case, it is still \n7  distinguishable because the aliens in Rajah were, undisputedly, deportable from the country, and \n8  the only issue was whether the aliens might be able to get a reprieve from deportation because the \n9  “deportation proceedings were so tainted by the [post-9/11] Program [that required nonimmigrant \n10  alien males over the age of 16 from designated countries to appear for registration and \n11  fingerprinting] and associated events.”  Id. at 434.  See, e.g., id. at 434-38 (addressing petitioners’ \n12  arguments that, inter alia, “the Attorney General had no statutory authority to enact the Program,” \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  that “the Program was invalidly promulgated because the relevant regulations were not subject to \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  the required public notice and comment,” and that the petitioners’ “deportation orders violate their \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  rights under . . . Equal Protection . . . because the immigration laws were selectively enforced \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  against them based on their religion, ethnicity, gender, and race”).  Moreover, Rajah is \nS d nr\nee 17  distinguishable because, while the case (like the instant case) involved an Equal Protection claim, \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  the claim was really one for selective prosecution/enforcement, an area in which the courts have \n19  applied substantial deference to the exercise of prosecutorial discretion.  See, e.g., Reno v. Am.-\n20  Arab Anti-Discrim. Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 489-90 (1999) (noting that, “[e]ven in the criminal-law \n21  field, a selective prosecution claim is a rara avis” because “such claims invade a special province \n22  of the Executive” and therefore a “criminal defendant [must] introduce ‘clear evidence] displacing \n23  the presumption that a prosecutor has acted lawfully”; adding that “[t]hese concerns are greatly \n24  magnified in the deportation context” but also stating that “we need not rule out the possibility of a \n25  rare case in which the alleged basis of discrimination is so outrageous that the foregoing \n26  considerations can be overcome”).   \n27  At the very least, the above analysis indicates that there are serious questions going to the \n28  merits as to whether Trump v. Hawaii governs in the instant case.  Even if Trump v. Hawaii did \n41 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 42 of 43\n \n1  provide the governing legal standard for the Equal Protection claim here, the Court nevertheless \n2  finds that there are serious questions going to the merits that warrant a preliminary injunction.  In \n3  Trump v. Hawaii, the Supreme Court stated that the “standard of review considers whether the \n4  [challenged decision] is plausibly related to the Government’s stated objective.”  Trump v. \n5  Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2420.  The Supreme Court also indicated that, in spite of this deferential \n6  standard of review, it assumed a court could “look behind the face of the [challenged decision] to \n7  the extent of applying rational basis review.”  Id.  In other words, a court could “consider [a \n8  plaintiff’s] extrinsic evidence,” including statements by the President, and should “uphold [the \n9  challenged decision] so long as it can reasonably be understood to result from a justification \n10  independent of unconstitutional grounds.”  Id.  Judicial review, though more deferential than \n11  traditional strict scrutiny, remains fact based.  Here, considering the substantial extrinsic evidence \n12  submitted by Plaintiffs, there are serious questions as to whether the terminations of TPS \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  designations could “reasonably be understood to result from a justification independent of \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  unconstitutional grounds.”  Id.; see also Centro Presente, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 122509, at *58-\ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  59 (in similar TPS case, stating that, “even if rational basis review were to apply, Plaintiffs’ \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  claims, at this early stage of litigation, would still survive”; noting that “there is no justification, \nS d nr\nee 17  explicit or otherwise, for Defendants’ switch to focusing on whether the conditions that caused the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  initial designation had abated rather than a fuller evaluation of whether the country would be able \n19  to safely accept returnees”). \n20  III.  CONCLUSION \n21  For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.   \n22  1.  It is hereby ORDERED THAT Defendants, their officers, agents, employees, \n23  representatives, and all persons acting in concert or participating with them, are ENJOINED AND \n24  RESTRAINED from engaging in, committing, or performing, directly or indirectly, by any means \n25  whatsoever, implementation and/or enforcement of the decisions to terminate TPS for Sudan, \n26  Haiti, El Salvador, and Nicaragua pending resolution of this case on the merits.  \n27  2.  It is further ORDERED that Defendants shall take all administrative actions needed \n28  to preserve the status quo pending completion of discovery and a ruling on the merits of the \n42 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 128   Filed 10/03/18   Page 43 of 43\n \n1  action, including all steps needed to ensure the continued validity of documents that prove lawful \n2  status and employment authorization for TPS holders.  Defendants shall report to the Court within \n3  fifteen (15) days of this Order on the administrative steps taken to comply with this paragraph and \n4  otherwise preserve the status quo. \n5  The preliminary injunction shall take effect immediately and shall remain in effect pending \n6  resolution of this case on the merits or further order of this Court.  The Court shall hold a Case \n7  Management Conference on October 26, 2018 at 10:30 a.m.  The parties shall file a joint case \n8  management conference statement by October 19, 2018 and shall address, inter alia, the expedited \n9  setting of trial or other means of adjudication of the merits. \n10  This order disposes of Docket No. 120. \n11   \n12  IT IS SO ORDERED. \na \ntr in\nuoro 13   \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Dated: October 3, 2018 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15   \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  ______________________________________ \nS d nr EDWARD M.

STINNIE \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255     Filed 03/11/25     Page 3 of 12\n \n1 The Parties file this joint status report pursuant to the Court’s order of August 15, 2024, Dkt. \n2 248, which requested that the Parties provide statements after the Supreme Court’s decision in \n3 Lackey v. Stinnie, No. 23-621, 2025 WL 594737 (U.S. Feb. 25, 2025). A copy of the decision is \n4 attached for the Court’s convenience. The Parties disagree about the effect of Stinnie on the pending \n5 fee motion before this Court. Defendants believe the Court should deny Plaintiffs’ fee motion now. \n6 Plaintiffs believe they are entitled to fees under Stinnie, and believe supplemental briefing is \n7 warranted to demonstrate why. Plaintiffs request that the Parties be permitted to brief the question \n8 on an agreed-upon schedule. Defendants believe briefing is unnecessary, but in the event the Court \n9 orders supplemental briefing, they do not oppose the schedule Plaintiffs have proposed. \n10 I.   Plaintiffs’ Statement \n11 A.   Plaintiffs’ Summary of Why They Prevail Under Stinnie \n12 Plaintiffs’ position is that they should be allowed to file supplemental briefs on the question \n13 whether they are prevailing parties under Stinnie and the law that continues to govern their fee \n14 motion post-Stinnie. However, they sketch a portion of their position here because Defendants have \n15 asked the Court to resolve Plaintiffs’ fee motion based on this Joint Status Report, without any \n16 further briefing. They provide this outline of their position on Stinnie only to demonstrate why \n17 supplemental briefing is warranted.1 \n18 Stinnie held that victory on a preliminary injunction alone does not render a plaintiff \n19 “prevailing” for purposes of fee awards under 42 U.S.C. 1988, and that where external events (such \n20 as the passage of legislation that adopts the plaintiff’s position) render a case moot after the plaintiff \n21 wins a preliminary injunction, their victory on the preliminary injunction does not suffice to render \n22 plaintiffs prevailing. Because a preliminary injunction merely “preserve[s] the relative positions of \n23 the parties until a trial on the merits can be held,” 2025 WL 594737, at *4 (internal quotation \n24\n \n25 1 Plaintiffs maintain that Stinnie’s rule may also be inapplicable to this case for the reasons they \nsuggested in their prior briefing on this issue, including that its holding may not apply to EAJA, and \n26 that retroactive application of its rule to set compensation for work performed prior to the Court’s \ndecision may violate the Due Process Clause. See ECF Nos. 228, 245. They may further address \n27 those issues in any supplemental briefing as well.  \n1 \n28 JOINT STATUS REPORT RE: LACKEY V. STINNIE \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255     Filed 03/11/25     Page 4 of 12\n \n1 omitted), the relief it affords is in that sense “transient,” rather than “enduring.” Id. at *6. Stinnie \n2 went on to hold that “for the purposes of §1988(b), a plaintiff ‘prevails’ when a court grants enduring \n3 judicial relief that constitutes a ‘material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties,’” id. at \n4 *5. (internal quotation omitted), and furthermore that “the enduring nature of that change must itself \n5 be judicially sanctioned.” \n6 Assuming the prevailing party definition announced in Stinnie applies to this case, Plaintiffs \n7 prevail under that test, albeit for different reasons than advanced when they briefed the question \n8 under the old rule. Plaintiffs have prevailed under Stinnie because they secured what was effectively \n9 a consent decree through an agreement reached between the Parties and signed by the Court after \n10 its ruling on the preliminary injunction motion. That agreement ensured certain minimal protections \n11 for all TPS holders, regardless of any litigated outcome. See Ramos ECF No. 138. In the agreement \n12 memorialized at ECF No. 138, reached after this Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary \n13 injunction, Defendants guaranteed that all TPS holders from the affected countries would be \n14 afforded continued TPS protections for a minimum of at least 120 days from the date of any adverse \n15 decision on appeal. The agreement was submitted and entered as an order of the Court. It provided:  \n16 Following the conclusion of the appeal of the preliminary injunction, TPS will remain in \neffect for [the four countries] for a minimum of the later of a) 120 days following the issuance \n17 of any mandate to the district court or b) the Secretary’s previously-announced effective date \nfor the termination of TPS designations for [the four countries]. \n18\n19 Ramos, ECF No. 138 ¶6(c). Given that it takes a minimum of 52 days for the mandate to issue from \n20 any appellate decision, this agreement guaranteed all TPS holders at least approximately six months \n21 to stay in the country beyond what the TPS statute would otherwise require—essentially the \n22 equivalent of one more TPS extension. See 8 U.S.C. 1254a(b)(3)(C). The parties initially reached \n23 that agreement for the four countries at issue in Ramos (El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Sudan), \n24 and later agreed to essentially the same terms for the two countries at issue in Bhattarai (Honduras \n25 and Nepal). See Bhattarai, ECF No. 23 ¶11(c). The Court signed both orders. These consent orders \n26 provided a significant measure of stability for Plaintiffs and the wider TPS holder community during \n27\n2 \n28 JOINT STATUS REPORT RE: LACKEY V. STINNIE \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255     Filed 03/11/25     Page 5 of 12\n \n1 a turbulent time, as reflected in the fact that legal service providers and community groups \n2 consistently assured TPS holders that their “[TPS] status and employment authorization will be \n3 valid for at least the next six months, even if the Ninth Circuit vacates the injunction.”2  \n4 The relief provided in those orders makes Plaintiffs a prevailing party under Stinnie. It \n5 changed the legal relationship between the parties, because the statute contains no such 120-day \n6 minimum post-termination period of authorized stay. It was “enduring” as Stinnie uses that term, as \n7 it was not subject to later reversal on appeal or otherwise. And it was “judicially sanctioned” because \n8 this Court adopted and entered both stipulations containing the agreement as orders, thus rendering \n9 them enforceable by the Court (such as via contempt).  \n10 While that conclusion is clear from Stinnie’s holding concerning what is needed to establish \n11 prevailing party status, a passage at the end of the opinion discussing “consent decree[s]” confirms \n12 that Plaintiffs are entitled to fees, as it makes clear that awarding fees for such decrees is “fully \n13 consistent with the rule we announce today.” 2025 WL 594737 at *8. As that passage explains, a \n14 consent decree is “approved and given force of law by the court,” and therefore “like a final \n15 judgment in the relevant ways: [i]t conclusively resolves the claim, bears a judicial imprimatur, and \n16 may grant enduring relief that materially alters the legal relationship between the parties.” Id. \n17 (emphasis in original); see also Richard S. v. Dep’t of Developmental Servs. of State of California, \n18 317  F.3d  1080,  1088  (9th  Cir.  2003)  (distinguishing  between  “purely  private”  and  “legally \n19 enforceable” settlement agreements and holding the latter, like consent decrees, contain a “judicial \n20 imprimatur that alters the legal relationship of the parties”) (quotation omitted). Stinnie also \n21 reaffirms that a plaintiff can prevail even if the only relief they win is not the most significant form \n22 of relief sought. 2025 WL 594737 at *5 (“a final victory on a material even if not predominant \n23 claim,” can suffice); see also id. (noting that the Court had previously rejected “the ‘central issue \n24 test,’ which would have required a party to prevail on its central claim in order to be awarded \n25\n \n26 2 CLINIC, Latest Developments in Ramos v. Nielsen and Impact on TPS Holders, available at \nhttps://www.cliniclegal.org/resources/humanitarian-relief/latest-developments-ramos-v-nielsen-\n27 and-impact-tps-holders (Nov. 1, 2018). \n3 \n28 JOINT STATUS REPORT RE: LACKEY V. STINNIE \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255     Filed 03/11/25     Page 6 of 12\n \n1 attorney’s fees.”); Fisher v. SJB-P.D., 214 F.3d 1115, 1117–19 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding settlement \n2 agreement requiring defendants to print four-paragraph non-discrimination statement rendered \n3 plaintiff “prevailing party” entitled to attorney fees). And Stinnie reaffirms that a party can prevail \n4 even if the order that renders them prevailing does not come at the end of the case. Id. at *7 (“many \n5 final orders may issue in the course of the litigation.”). \n6 In  their  statement  below,  Defendants  suggest  the  Parties’  agreement  does  not  render \n7 Plaintiffs prevailing parties because it was a “housekeeping” agreement that merely “preserved the \n8 status quo,” did not resolve any claim on the merits, and provided only temporary benefits. Each of \n9 these claims is wrong. Plaintiffs respectfully request the opportunity to explain why, but offer here \n10 just  a  brief  summary  of  their  positions:  Stinnie  contains  no  exception  for  “housekeeping” \n11 agreements, and in any event that label does not reflect the agreement’s significance to Plaintiffs \n12 and other TPS holders.  \n13 The agreement did not preserve the status quo; the preliminary injunction preserved the \n14 status quo. The agreement granted a substantial additional benefit that the law does not provide.3 It \n15 was on the merits insofar as the entire litigation was about securing TPS protection. The agreement \n16 granted Plaintiffs the equivalent of an additional TPS extension, effectively ensuring the challenged \n17 termination decisions would be reversed regardless of the outcome of the litigation.  \n18 Moreover, under longstanding doctrine, a consent agreement does not need to resolve the \n19 entirety of a claim or convey relief for more than a limited period of time to render Plaintiffs \n20 prevailing. Conditioning prevailing party status on proof that a stipulated order applies to the \n21 entirety of a claim also make no sense; consent agreements between parties often do not say what \n22 claims, if any, underly the agreed-upon relief. Under Stinnie, so long as an agreed-upon order \n23\n24\n \n25 3 Defendants suggest below, n.5, that the 120 days was simply the “outgrowth” of administrative \nsteps  they  planned  to  take  to  comply  with  the  Court’s  preliminary  injunction,  but  fail  to \n26 acknowledge that those steps were actually “based on an agreement reached with Plaintiffs ‘as part \nof a negotiation to stay district court proceedings pending appellate review of the preliminary \n27 injunction.’” ECF No. 138 ¶3 (quoting Declaration of Donald Neufeld [ECF No. 135-1]). \n4 \n28 JOINT STATUS REPORT RE: LACKEY V. STINNIE \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255     Filed 03/11/25     Page 7 of 12\n \n1 materially alters the legal relationship between the parties in a manner that is both judicially-\n2 sanctioned and will take effect even after pending proceedings, they establish prevailing status.  \n3 Finally, under Stinnie what renders relief “enduring” is not its length of time it remains in \n4 effect, but rather whether it is subject to later reversal. Were it otherwise, Stinnie would not have \n5 pointed to temporary consent orders entered mid-litigation as examples of enduring relief that render \n6 litigants prevailing parties. 2025 WL 594737 at *7-*8. \n7 B.   This Report Is Not a Proper Vehicle to Resolve Substantive Disputes. \n8 Defendants disagree with Plaintiffs’ view of Stinnie. For that reason, the Court should allow \n9 the Parties to file supplemental briefs before resolving the issue, rather than deciding it based only \n10 on the summary discussion here. In its order deferring ruling on Plaintiffs’ motion for attorneys’ \n11 fees, the Court directed that “[t]he parties shall file a status report within two weeks after the \n12 Supreme Court issues its decision in Stinnie.” It did not ask the Parties to analyze and then brief all \n13 of Stinnie’s implications in that narrow window of time. ECF No. 248 at 2:9–10.  \n14 Denying Plaintiffs the opportunity to file supplemental briefs would be particularly unfair \n15 here,  because  until  the  morning  of  this  filing  Plaintiffs  were  under  the  misimpression  that \n16 Defendants had agreed that supplemental briefing is warranted, only to realize a few hours ago that \n17 Defendants intended to ask the Court to rule on the fee motion based on this status report.4  \n18 This is not a setting where condensed briefing on a truncated schedule is appropriate. \n19 Plaintiffs’ counsel, collectively, devoted more than 7,900 hours to this matter and have applied for \n20 more than $3.6 million in fees, ECF No. 231-6 at 2. This Court and other courts regularly order \n21 supplemental briefing when Supreme Court precedent comes down after the parties’ original \n22 briefing has been submitted. See, e.g., The Pandolfi v. AviaGames, Inc., No. 23-cv-05971-EMC, \n23 2024 WL 4051754, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 4, 2024) (directing parties “to file further supplemental \n24 briefing because of a recently issued California Supreme Court decision” bearing on motion); \n \n25\n4 To be clear, Plaintiffs in no way intend to suggest that Defendants sought to mislead Plaintiffs. A \n26 genuine miscommunication occurred. But whatever the source of the misunderstanding, the fact \nremains that Defendants’ approach would require Plaintiffs to brief all of the potential implications \n27 of Stinnie within what is effectively less than a day. \n5 \n28 JOINT STATUS REPORT RE: LACKEY V. STINNIE \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255     Filed 03/11/25     Page 8 of 12\n \n1 Ramos v. Nielsen, 321 F.Supp.3d 1083, 1123 (N.D. Cal.

Cal. June 19, 2018) (same); D.light \n4 Design, Inc. v. Boxin Solar Co., Ltd., No. 13-cv-05988-EMC, 2015 WL 7731781, at *2 (N.D. Cal. \n5 Dec. 1, 2015) (same). This case should be no exception, especially given the nature and number of \n6 disagreements among the parties, the significant stakes, and the lack of any prejudice to Defendants \n7 of permitting supplemental briefing. Cf. In re Social Media Adolescent Addiction/Personal Injury \n8 Prods. Liab. Litig., No. 22-md-03047-YGR (PHK), 2024 WL 1808607, at *4 (N.D. Cal. April 25, \n9 2024) (finding “relative legal or factual complexity of the issue,” “extent to which [a] dispute \n10 concerns substantive as opposed to administrative or procedural issues,” and anticipated page length \n11 needed as factors favoring resolving matters via briefing rather than a joint statement report). \n12 *    *    * \n13 For all these reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court permit the Parties to brief \n14 the effect of Stinnie on Plaintiffs’ fee motion. Plaintiffs propose that they be allowed to file their \n15 supplemental brief on April 25, 2025; that Defendants’ response be due on May 9, 2025; and that \n16 Plaintiffs’ reply be due on May 23, 2025. Plaintiffs propose that the opening briefs be no more than \n17 15 pages, and their reply be no more than 10 pages. Defendants have stated that, in the event that \n18 the Court orders briefing, they would not oppose the schedule and page specifications set forth \n19 above. \n20  \n21 II.  Defendants’ Statement \n22 In their motion for attorneys’ fees (ECF No. 228), Plaintiffs contended that they were \n23 “prevailing parties” eligible for attorneys’ fees because they “secur[ed] a preliminary injunction that \n24 lasted for years,” even though the Court ultimately dismissed this case as moot. Id. at 12:25-26; see \n25 id. at 12:21-13:9. The Court stayed consideration of the motion because the Supreme Court’s then-\n26 forthcoming decision in Lackey v. Stinnie, 23-621, “has the potential to be dispositive of the pending \n27\n6 \n28 JOINT STATUS REPORT RE: LACKEY V. STINNIE \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255     Filed 03/11/25     Page 9 of 12\n \n1 motion.” Order re Plaintiffs’ Motion for Attorneys’ Fees at 2:4, ECF No. 248. It is. The Supreme \n2 Court’s holdings in Stinnie that“[b]ecause preliminary injunctions do not conclusively resolve the \n3 rights of parties on the merits, they do not confer prevailing party status” and that “external events \n4 that render a dispute moot do not convert a temporary order designed to preserve the status of the \n5 parties into a conclusive adjudication of their rights” are completely dispositive of Plaintiff’s fees \n6 motion. Stinnie at 7 (slip op.); see also id. at 13 (“A preliminary injunction . . . does not render a \n7 plaintiff a ‘prevailing party.’ Nor do external events that moot the action and prevent the court from \n8 conclusively adjudicating the claim.”). Accordingly, the Court should deny Plaintiff’s motion in \n9 full, without further briefing. \n10 Plaintiffs now suggest a wholly new theory not raised in their motion—that the parties’ \n11 purely procedural stipulation entered to stay proceedings on the merits while the preliminary \n12 injunction was pending appeal (ECF No. 138) instead makes them “prevailing parties,” even though \n13 the preliminary injunction itself cannot. This is of course incorrect. As the Supreme Court explained \n14 in Stinnie, “[a] prevailing party . . . is [t]he party ultimately prevailing when the matter is finally at \n15 rest” and that “[b]ecause preliminary injunctions do not conclusively resolve the rights of parties on \n16 the merits, they do not confer prevailing party status.” Stinnie at 6-7 (slip op.). Nothing in the \n17 stipulation “conclusively resolved” any “rights” or “claim” “on the merits,” so it cannot provide the \n18 basis for prevailing party status. Id. at 7, 13. The operative portion of the stipulation itself makes \n19 clear that it contemplates “[f]urther proceedings on the merits of the case” whether or not “the \n20 preliminary injunction is affirmed in whole or in part” or “the preliminary injunction is vacated on \n21 appeal.” Stipulation at 3:16-22, ECF No. 138. Far from being a “final judgment” or analogous to a \n22 “consent decree” as Plaintiffs suggest, this stipulation was just a housekeeping agreement to \n23 maintain the status quo temporarily while the preliminary injunction order (which could not itself \n24 establish prevailing party status) was on appeal, subsequent to which there would be “[f]urther \n25 proceedings on the merits of this case.” Id. at 3:16. Nor was the 120-day period on which Plaintiffs \n26 rely for their argument “final” in any respect; it was temporary. Indeed, the case continued to be \n27\n7 \n28 JOINT STATUS REPORT RE: LACKEY V. STINNIE \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255     Filed 03/11/25     Page 10 of 12\n \n1 litigated after it the stipulation ceased being effective. Ultimately, despite a wide variety of relief \n2 Plaintiffs sought in both the original and amended complaint (neither of which includes the 120-day \n3 period), there is no final order on the merits granting any of it, and the case was dismissed as moot.5   \n4 While they do not press the below arguments here, Plaintiffs have also suggested to \n5 Defendants that Stinnie may not apply to their fee request under EAJA because that case involved \n6 § 1988, but such a contention is both inconsistent with Stinnie and foreclosed by Ninth Circuit \n7 precedent.  See,  e.g.,  Stinnie  at  5  (slip  op.)  (“As  we  have  previously  recognized,  the  phrase \n8 ‘prevailing party’ in § 1988(b) is a ‘legal term of art.”); Perez-Arellano v. Smith, 279 F.3d 791, 794 \n9 (9th Cir. 2002) (“[W]e discern no reason to interpret the EAJA inconsistently with the Supreme \n10 Court's interpretation of “prevailing party” in the FHAA [i.e. § 1988] and the ADA as explained in \n11 Buckhannon.”).  \n12 Similarly, Plaintiffs’ argument previously proffered to Defendants that Stinnie does not \n13 apply retroactively is unfounded. “When th[e Supreme] Court applies a rule of federal law to the \n14 parties before it, that rule is the controlling interpretation of federal law and must be given full \n15 retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct review and as to all events, regardless of whether \n \n16\n5 Plaintiffs’ strained attempt to transform a limited stipulation into a “consent decree” is neither \n17 supported by the facts nor any plausible construction of Stinnie.  The 120-day period that Plaintiffs \nclaim affords them “prevailing party” status and entitles them to millions of dollars in attorneys’ \n18 fees itself arose directly from the Court’s order granting the preliminary injunction that “Defendants \nshall report to the Court within fifteen (15) days of this Order on the administrative steps taken to \n19 comply with this paragraph and otherwise preserve the status quo,” Order Granting Plaintiffs ‘ Mot. \nfor Preliminary Injunction at 43, ECF No 128, as the Stipulation itself makes clear. See Stipulation \n20 to Stay Proceedings at 1:22-27 (“[O]n October 23, 2018, pursuant to this Court’s Order, Defendants \nreported on the administrative steps they are undertaking in response to the preliminary injunction. \n21 In  the  Declaration  of  Donald  Neufeld  [ECF  No.  135-1]  attached  to  that  filing,  Defendants \nrepresented that, in the event the preliminary injunction was reversed on appeal, any termination of \n22 TPS for Sudan, Haiti, El Salvador, and Nicaragua would go into effect no sooner than 120 days \nfrom the issuance of any appellate mandate to this Court.”). If the preliminary injunction could not \n23 afford prevailing party status itself, it is hard to see how this outgrowth thereof could plausibly do \nso. And despite Plaintiffs’ claims that this 120-day period provided “essentially the equivalent of \n24 one more TPS extension,” supra, it did nothing of the sort: By the time of the Ninth Circuit’s \nmandate (which was effective the date of its order dismissing the appeal), all affected countries \n25 already had their TPS extended or redesignated, so it did not provide meaningful relief beyond that \nalready afforded by the preliminary injunction. Plaintiffs knew Stinnie was pending when they \n26 briefed their motion for attorneys’ fees and imperiled the theory of “prevailing party” status at the \ntime; if this new theory were colorable enough to warrant briefing, they would have seen fit to \n27 include it then. They should not be afforded another bite at the apple now. \n8 \n28 JOINT STATUS REPORT RE: LACKEY V. STINNIE \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255     Filed 03/11/25     Page 11 of 12\n \n1 such events predate or postdate our announcement of the rule.” Harper v. Virginia Dep’t of Tax’n, \n2 509 U.S. 86, 97 (1993); see also Hajro v. U.S. Citizenship & Immigr. Servs., 811 F.3d 1086, 1099 \n3 (9th Cir. 2016) (“When the Supreme Court announces a new rule and retroactively applies it to the \n4 case before it, all courts must apply the rule retroactively.”). As the Supreme Court applied the rule \n5 announced in Stinnie to the circumstances there, and as this case “is still open on direct review” in \n6 the context of attorneys’ fees, Stinnie “is the controlling interpretation of federal law” that must be \n7 “given full retroactive effect” here. Plaintiffs cannot escape this rule by citing caselaw addressing \n8 the alternate circumstance of the retroactive application of statutes, in which a different analysis \n9 applies. See, e.g., Martin v. Hadix, 527 U.S. 343, 353 (1999) (“When should a new federal statute \n10 be applied to pending cases? To answer the question, we ask first whether Congress has expressly \n11 prescribed the statute’s proper reach. . . . [If not, and] the application of the statute to the conduct at \n12 issue would result in a retroactive effect . . . then in keeping with our traditional presumption against \n13 retroactivity, we presume that the statute does not apply to that conduct.” (citations and internal \n14 quotation marks omitted)).  \n15 For the foregoing reasons, Defendants maintain that Plaintiffs’ motion for fees should be \n16 denied without further briefing. If, however, the Court disagrees and would prefer further briefing, \n17 Defendants do not oppose the schedule and page limitations proposed by Plaintiffs herein. \n18    \n19  \n20 Date:  March 11, 2025       Respectfully submitted, \n21  \nYAAKOV M.

STINNIE ET \nAL. \nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR \nTHE FOURTH CIRCUIT  \nNo. 23–621.  Argued October 8, 2024—Decided February 25, 2025  \nDrivers whose licenses were  suspended under a Virginia statute for fail-\nure to pay court fines sued the Commissioner of the Virginia Depart-\nment of Motor Vehicles under 42 U.  S. C. §1983, challenging the stat-\nute as unconstitutional.  The District Court granted a preliminary \ninjunction prohibiting the Commissioner from enforcing the statute.   \nBefore trial, the Virginia General Assembly repealed the statute and \nrequired reinstatement of licenses suspended under the law.  The par-\nties then agreed to dismiss the pending case as moot.   \n     Section 1988(b) allows an award of attorney’s fees to “prevailing par-\nties” under §1983.  The District Court declined to award attorney’s fees  \nto the drivers  under that section on the ground that parties who obtain \na preliminary injunction do not qualify as “prevailing part[ies].”  A  \nFourth Circuit panel affirmed, but the Fourth Circuit  reversed en  \nbanc.  The en  banc court held that some preliminary injunctions can \nprovide lasting, merits-based relief and qualify plaintiffs as prevailing \nparties, even if the case becomes moot before final judgment.  \nHeld: The plaintiff drivers here—who gained only preliminary injunctive \nrelief before this action became moot—do not qualify as “prevailing \npart[ies]” eligible for attorney’s fees under §1988(b) because no  court  \nconclusively resolved their claims by granting enduring judicial relief \non the merits that materially altered the legal relationship between \nthe parties.  Pp. 4–13. \n   (a)Under the “American Rule,” a prevailing litigant is ordinarily not \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 2 of 35\n2  LACKEY v. STINNIE  \n   \nSyllabus  \nentitled to collect attorneys’  fees from the loser absent express statu-\ntory authorization. See Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness So-\nciety, 421 U. S. 240, 249.  Congress has provided that in actions  \nbrought under certain civil rights statutes—including 42 U. S.  C. \n§1983—“the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, \nother than the United States, a reasonable attorney’s fee as part of the \ncosts.”  §1988(b).   \n   To  determine  whether  the  drivers  here  qualify  as  “prevailing\npart[ies]” under §1988(b), the Court begins  with the statute’s text.  The \nCourt has recognized “prevailing party” as a legal term of art.  Buck-\nhannon Board & Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and  \nHuman Resources, 532 U. S. 598, 603.  When §1988(b) was adopted, \ncontemporary dictionaries defined a prevailing party as one who suc-\ncessfully maintains its claim when the matter is finally resolved.  See  \nBlack’s Law Dictionary 1352 (4th ed. 1968);  Ballentine’s Law Diction-\nary 985 (3d ed. 1969).   \n   Preliminary injunctions do  not make a party “prevailing” because \nthey do not conclusively decide the case on the merits.  Such injunc-\ntions only determine if a plaintiff is likely to succeed, along with factors \nsuch as   irreparable harm, the balance of equities, and the public in-\nterest.  See Winter v.  Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.  \nS. 7, 20.  The purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the \nstatus quo until a trial can occur, see University of Tex.  v. Camenisch, \n451 U. S. 390, 395, and external events that render a dispute moot do \nnot  convert  that  temporary  order  into  a  conclusive   adjudication.   \nPp. 4–7.\n   (b) The Court’s precedents interpreting §1988(b) establish that a \nplaintiff “prevails” when a court grants enduring judicial relief that \nmaterially alters the legal relationship between the parties.  Two re-\ncent decisions emphasize that this change must be both judicially sanc-\ntioned and enduring. In Buckhannon, the Court rejected the “catalyst  \ntheory”—the theory that a plaintiff may receive attorney’s fees under \n§1988(b) when he “achieves the desired result because the lawsuit  \nbrought about a voluntary  change in the defendant’s conduct.”  532  \nU. S., at 601.  The Court explained that the plaintiff was not a “pre-\nvailing party” because there had been “no judicially sanctioned change \nin the legal relationship of the parties.”  Id., at 605.  And in Sole v.  \nWyner, 551 U. S. 74, the Court decided that a plaintiff initially granted \na preliminary injunction after an abbreviated hearing, but denied a  \npermanent injunction after a adjudication on the merits, did not qual-\nify as a “prevailing party” within the meaning of §1988(b) because the  \nplaintiff gained no enduring  change in the  legal relationship between \nherself and the defendants. Id., at 77, 78, 86.  The Court’s holding in  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 3 of 35\n  Cite as:  604 U. S. ____ (2025)  3 \n \nSyllabus  \nthis case—that the enduring nature of that change must itself be judi-\ncially sanctioned—follows naturally from Sole and Buckhannon.   A \nplaintiff who wins a transient victory on a preliminary injunction does \nnot become a “prevailing party” simply because external events con-\nvert the transient victory into a lasting one.  Pp. 7–9. \n   (c) The rule established serves the interests of judicial economy.  A \nstraightforward, bright-line rule is easy to administer, reducing the \nrisk of significant litigation over attorney’s fees.  Concerns that gov-\nernment defendants who have lost at the preliminary injunction stage \nwill strategically moot litigation are speculative, and such a risk could \narise in only a small number of contexts.  The judicial role here is lim-\nited. Congress may amend the statutory language to empower courts \nto award attorney’s fees to plaintiffs who have enjoyed some success  \nbut have not prevailed in a judgment on the merits.  Pp. 10–11.  \n   (d) The drivers’ remaining arguments are unpersuasive. The argu-\nment that §1988(b) was enacted against a historical backdrop that fa-\nvored awarding interim costs at equity, including for preliminary in-\njunctions, was rejected by the Court in  Alyeska Pipeline.  421 U. S., at  \n241, 247.  The drivers also contend that the availability of fees in some \ncases while litigation is ongoing suggests that §1988(b) includes no fi-\nnality requirement, but the Court’s decisions simply indicate that at-\ntorney’s fees  may be awarded when conclusive, enduring judicial relief \nis meted out on an incremental basis.  Finally, the availability of fees \nafter a court-ordered consent decree is consistent with the rule an-\nnounced here.  While the decree reflects the parties’ own resolution of \nthe merits, it is approved and given force of law by a court, and it may \ngrant enduring relief that materially alters the legal relationship be-\ntween the parties.  The dissent conflates preliminary judicial relief  \nthat becomes irreversible by way of mootness with relief that is perma-\nnent by virtue  of a judicial order.

LACKEY, IN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY AS THE \nCOMMISSIONER OF THE VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT  \nOF MOTOR VEHICLES, PETITIONER  v. DAMIAN \nSTINNIE, ET  AL. \nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \nAPPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT  \n[February 25, 2025] \n CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS  delivered  the  opinion  of  the \nCourt.  \n  Respondents are Virginia drivers whose licenses were \nsuspended due to their failure to  pay court fines or costs.  \nThe drivers sued the Commissioner of the Virginia Depart-\nment of Motor Vehicles under 42  U. S. C. §1983, arguing \nthat the Virginia statute requiring suspension of their li-\ncenses was unconstitutional.  The District Court prelimi-\nnarily enjoined the Commissioner from enforcing the stat-\nute.  But  before  the  case  reached  final  judgment,  the \nVirginia General Assembly repealed the challenged law, \nrendering  the  action  moot.  The  question  presented  is\nwhether the drivers are “prevailing part[ies]” who qualify \nfor an award of attorney’s fees under §1988(b). \nI \n  Until recently, a Virginia statute directed the state courts \nto suspend the license of any driver who failed to pay “any \nfine, costs, forfeitures, restitution, or penalty lawfully as-\nsessed against him” for violation of a federal, state, or local \nlaw.  The suspension remained in force until the amount  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 5 of 35\n2  LACKEY v.

Virginia drivers—whose licenses \nwere suspended under the law and who asserted that they \ncould not afford to pay the fines or costs or keep up with a  \npayment plan—sued the Commissioner of the Virginia De-\npartment of Motor Vehicles on their own behalf and on be-\nhalf of a putative class. The drivers alleged that the statute \nfacially violated the Due Process Clause by “failing to pro-\nvide sufficient notice or hearing to any driver before license \nsuspension” and violated both the Due Process and Equal \nProtection Clauses “as applied to people who cannot afford \nto pay due to their modest financial circumstances.”  First \nAmended Class Action Complaint in Stinnie v. Holcomb, \nNo. 3:16−cv−00044 (WD Va., Sept. 11, 2018), ECF Doc. 84, \npp. 2−3; see also id., at 37−43.  The drivers sought declara-\ntory relief, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, \nand attorney’s fees under 42 U. S. C. §1988(b).\n  In December 2018, the District Court granted a prelimi-\nnary injunction, prohibiting the Commissioner from enforc-\ning the statute against the drivers or future class members.  \nSee Stinnie v. Holcomb, 355 F. Supp. 3d 514, 520 (WD Va. \n2018).  The court explained that the drivers had made “a \nclear showing that [they were] likely to succeed” on their \nprocedural due process claim, though it noted that they \nneed not “establish a certainty of success.” Id., at 527 (quot-\ning Di Biase v. SPX Corp., 872 F. 3d 224, 230 (CA4 2017)).  \nThe court also determined that the remaining preliminary \ninjunction factors—the risk of irreparable harm, the bal-\nance of equities, and the public interest—weighed in the \ndrivers’ favor.  Stinnie, 355 F. Supp. 3d, at 532; see Winter  \nv. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U. S. 7, 20 \n(2008).

The Virginia \nGeneral Assembly had recently adopted Budget Amend-\nment No. 33, which “eliminate[d] the suspension of drivers’ \nlicenses for failure to pay court fines and costs through July \n1, 2020, but [did] not repeal §46.2–395.”  Ibid.  The Com-\nmissioner  represented  that  the  General  Assembly  was\nlikely to repeal the law during the next legislative session.  \nThe District Court granted a stay, reasoning in part that \ndoing so served the interests of judicial economy and ena-\nbled the court to avoid “weigh[ing] in on sensitive constitu-\ntional questions about license suspension schemes about \nwhich other courts ha[d] disagreed.”  Id., at 660. \n  In April 2020, the Virginia General Assembly repealed \n§46.2–395 and required the permanent reinstatement of li-\ncenses suspended under the law.  See 2020 Va. Acts ch. 965.  \nAs a result, the parties agreed that the action had become\nmoot and stipulated to dismissal. The drivers, however, as-\nserted  that  they  were  entitled  to  attorney’s  fees  under \n§1988(b), so the parties jointly requested that the court re-\ntain jurisdiction to resolve that dispute. The District Court  \ndeclined  to  award  attorney’s  fees,  following  Smyth  v. \nRivero, 282 F. 3d 268 (CA4 2002).   See Stinnie v. Holcomb, \n2021 WL 2292807 (WD Va., June 4, 2021).  In Smyth the  \nFourth Circuit held that a plaintiff awarded a preliminary \ninjunction is not a “prevailing party” within the meaning of \n§1988(b).  282 F. 3d, at 277.  A Fourth Circuit panel af-\nfirmed, again relying on Smyth.  Stinnie v. Holcomb, 37 F.  \n4th 977 (2022).  Judge Harris concurred, suggesting that \nthe Circuit may wish to reconsider that precedent.  Id., at  \n983. \n  The Fourth Circuit did so, rehearing the case en banc and \noverturning its decision in Smyth.  Stinnie v. Holcomb, 77  \nF. 4th 200 (2023).  It observed that Smyth had become the \n“outlier” among the courts of appeals.  77 F. 4th, at 209.  It  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 7 of 35\n4  LACKEY v. STINNIE  \n   \nOpinion of the Court \nreasoned that some preliminary injunctions “provide en-\nduring, merits-based relief that satisfies all the requisites \nof the prevailing party standard.”  Id., at 203.  And it ex-\nplained, in light of this Court’s decision in Winter v.  Natural  \nResources Defense  Council, that a plaintiff could no longer \nprevail on a preliminary injunction for reasons that “had \nvirtually nothing to do with the merits of her claim.”  77 F.  \n4th, at 208−209; see Winter, 555 U.  S., at 20 (clarifying that  \na finding of  likely success on the merits is a prerequisite to\npreliminary injunctive relief).  Finally, it noted that Con-\ngress had enacted §1988(b) in the interest of facilitating the\nredress of civil rights grievances.  77 F. 4th, at 210. \n  The en banc court articulated a new standard: “When a  \npreliminary injunction provides the plaintiff concrete, irre-\nversible relief on the merits of her claim and becomes moot  \nbefore final judgment because no further court-ordered as-\nsistance proves necessary, the subsequent mootness of the \ncase does not preclude an award of attorney’s fees.”  Ibid. \nApplying that standard, the en banc court vacated and re-\nmanded the case to allow the District Court to determine a  \nreasonable fee.  Id., at 218.  Judge Quattlebaum dissented, \narguing that a preliminary injunction does not constitute a \njudicial decision on the merits and that a fee award on the \nbasis of such an injunction therefore conflicts with both the \ntext of §1988(b) and this Court’s precedents. See id., at 225, \n227, 231. \n  We granted certiorari to determine whether the term \n“prevailing party” in §1988(b) encompasses a party who is \nawarded a preliminary injunction, if the case becomes moot \nbefore the court reaches a final judgment.  601 U. S. ___ \n(2024). \nII  \n  Since 1796, this Court has maintained that “the Judici-\nary itself would not create a general rule, independent of \nany statute, allowing awards of attorneys’ fees in federal  \ncourts.”  Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 8 of 35\n  Cite as:  604 U. S. ____ (2025)  5 \n \nOpinion of the Court \n421 U. S. 240, 249 (1975) (citing Arcambel v. Wiseman, 3  \nDall. 306 (1796)).  The principle that “the prevailing litigant \nis ordinarily not entitled to collect a reasonable attorneys’ \nfee from the loser” became known as the “American Rule.”   \nAlyeska Pipeline, 421 U. S., at 247.  Federal courts may de-\npart from this rule only when “there is express statutory \nauthorization” to do so.  Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424,  \n429 (1983).\n  In 1976, Congress adopted the Civil Rights Attorney’s \nFees Awards Act.  90 Stat. 2641.  The law provides that, in \nactions brought under certain civil rights statutes—includ-\ning 42 U. S.  C. §1983—“the court, in its discretion, may al-\nlow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a \nreasonable attorney’s fee as part of the costs.”  §1988(b).  \nThe question is whether the drivers in this case qualify as \n“prevailing part[ies]” within the meaning of §1988(b). \nA \n  When interpreting a statute, we begin with the text.  As  \nwe  have  previously  recognized,  the  phrase  “prevailing\nparty” in §1988(b) is a “legal term of art.”  Buckhannon  \nBoard & Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health \nand Human Resources, 532 U. S. 598, 603 (2001).  We as-\nsume that “when Congress ‘borrows terms of art in which \nare accumulated the legal tradition and meaning of centu-\nries of practice, it presumably knows and adopts the cluster \nof  ideas  that  were  attached  to  each  borrowed  word.’”  \n \nUnited States v. Hansen, 599 U. S. 762, 774 (2023) (quoting \nMorissette v. United States, 342 U. S. 246, 263 (1952)). \n  At the time §1988(b) was adopted, Black’s Law Diction-\nary defined “prevailing party” as the party “who success-\nfully prosecutes the action or successfully defends against \nit.”  Black’s Law Dictionary 1352 (rev. 4th ed. 1968).  It ex-\nplained that prevailing party status “does not depend upon \nthe degree of success at different stages of the suit, but \nwhether, at the end of the suit, or other proceeding, the  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 9 of 35\n6  LACKEY v. STINNIE  \n   \nOpinion of the Court \nparty who has made a claim against the other, has success-\nfully maintained it.”  Ibid.; accord, Ballentine’s Law Dic-\ntionary 985 (3d ed. 1969).  A prevailing party, in other \nwords, is “[t]he party ultimately prevailing when the mat-\nter is finally set at rest.”  Black’s Law Dictionary 1352. \n  Preliminary injunctions, however, do not conclusively re-\nsolve legal disputes.  In awarding preliminary injunctions,\ncourts determine if a plaintiff is likely to succeed on the \nmerits—along with the risk of irreparable harm, the bal-\nance of equities, and the public interest.  Winter, 555 U. S., \nat 20.  “The purpose of a preliminary injunction is merely \nto preserve the relative positions of the parties until a trial \non the merits can be held,” University of Tex. v. Camenisch, \n451 U. S. 390, 395 (1981), and “to balance the equities as \nthe litigation moves forward,” Trump v. International Ref-\nugee Assistance Project, 582 U. S. 571, 580 (2017) (per cu-\nriam).  “Crafting a preliminary injunction is an exercise of \ndiscretion and judgment, often dependent as much on the \nequities of a given case as the substance of the legal issues \nit presents.”  Id., at 579.  Such relief is also “customarily \ngranted on the basis of procedures that are less formal and \nevidence that is less complete than in a trial on the merits.”  \nCamenisch, 451 U. S., at 395.  As a result, we have previ-\nously cautioned against “improperly equat[ing] ‘likelihood \nof success’ with ‘success’” and treating preliminary injunc-\n \ntions as “tantamount to decisions  on the underlying mer-\nits.”  Id., at 394. \n  The transient nature of preliminary injunctions is most \napparent when a court reaches a different conclusion upon\nfull consideration of the merits.  For example, in one of our \nmore recent cases interpreting §1988, Sole v.  Wyner, 551 \nU. S. 74, 78–79 (2007), protesters sought a preliminary in-\njunction against a state regulation of beach attire in order \nto assemble nude in the form of a peace sign.  The day after \nthe complaint was filed, the District Court held a hearing \nand granted the preliminary injunction.  Id., at 79.  The \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 10 of 35\n  Cite as:  604 U. S. ____ (2025)  7 \n \nOpinion of the Court \npreliminary injunction permitted the protest to occur and \nthus preserved the participants’ rights until a final deter-\nmination could be made on the merits of their claim.  Ulti-\nmately, however, the court declined to award a permanent \ninjunction, ruling that the regulation was no more burden-\nsome than necessary to protect the public.  Id., at 80−81. \n  Because preliminary injunctions do not conclusively re-\nsolve the rights of parties on the merits, they do not confer \nprevailing party status.  A plaintiff who secures a prelimi-\nnary injunction has achieved only temporary success at an \nintermediary “stage[ ] of the suit.”  Black’s Law Dictionary  \n1352.  It cannot yet be said that he will “ultimately pre-\nvail[ ] when the matter is finally set at rest” or that he will \nhave “successfully maintained” his claim “at the end.” Ibid.   \nAnd external events that render a dispute moot do not con-\nvert a temporary order designed to preserve the status of \nthe parties into a conclusive adjudication of their rights.\n  The Fourth Circuit en banc was persuaded that “Winter’s \nstringent merits requirement” avoided the “risk” that “a \nplaintiff may prevail, and thus be entitled to fees, based on \na preliminary injunction that had virtually nothing to do \nwith the merits of her claim.”  77 F. 4th, at 209.  But it is \nnot enough that Winter guarantees a preliminary injunc-\ntion award has at least something to do with the merits.  \nThe plaintiff must succeed on the merits. \nB \n  This conclusion is consistent with our precedents inter-\npreting §1988(b).  We have held that, for the purposes of\n§1988(b), a plaintiff “prevails” when a court grants endur-\ning judicial relief that constitutes a “material alteration of \nthe legal relationship of the parties.”  Texas State Teachers  \nAssn. v. Garland Independent School Dist., 489 U. S. 782, \n792−793 (1989). For example, we have ruled that a plaintiff\nmay qualify as a “prevailing party” based on an award of \nnominal damages, Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U. S. 103, 112 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 11 of 35\n8  LACKEY v. STINNIE  \n   \nOpinion of the Court \n(1992), or a final victory on a material even if not predomi-\nnant  claim,  Texas  State  Teachers  Assn.,  489  U. S.,  at  \n791−793.  By contrast, a party does not qualify as a “pre-\nvailing party” when a court of appeals overturns directed \nverdicts and discovery orders entered against him, Hanra-\nhan v. Hampton, 446 U. S. 754, 756 (1980) (per curiam), or  \nwhen a court enters a declaratory judgment but does not \nmodify  the  defendant’s  behavior  toward  the  plaintiff,  \nRhodes v. Stewart, 488 U. S. 1, 3−4 (1988) (per curiam)\n(holding that no fees were available under §1988 when the \njudgment afforded no relief to the plaintiff due to moot-\nness). \n  Two of our more recent decisions highlight the require-\nments that the change in legal relationship be judicially \nsanctioned and enduring.  In Buckhannon Board & Care \nHome, Inc. v. West Virginia Department of Health and Hu-\nman Resources, we rejected the “catalyst theory”—the the-\nory  that  a  plaintiff  may  receive  attorney’s  fees  under \n§1988(b) when he “achieves the desired result because the \nlawsuit brought about a voluntary change in the defend-\nant’s conduct.”  532 U.  S., at 601; see id., at 600.  In that \ncontext, we explained that the plaintiff was not a “prevail-\ning party” because there had been “no judicially sanctioned\nchange in the legal relationship of the parties.” Id., at 605.  \nThe defendant’s voluntary actions “lack[ed] the necessary \njudicial imprimatur.”  Ibid.  We were not persuaded that \n§1988(b) “authorizes federal courts to award attorney’s fees \nto a plaintiff who” filed a “potentially meritless lawsuit” and \n“reached the ‘sought-after destination’ without obtaining \nany judicial relief.”  Id., at 606 (quoting id., at 634 (Gins-\nburg, J., dissenting)).\nIn Sole v. Wyner, we decided that “a plaintiff who gain[ed] \na preliminary injunction after an abbreviated hearing, but \n[was] denied a permanent injunction after a dispositive ad-\njudication on the merits,” did not qualify as a “prevailing\nparty” within the meaning of §1988(b).  551 U. S., at 77; see  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 12 of 35\n  Cite as:  604 U. S. ____ (2025)  9 \n \nOpinion of the Court \nid., at 78.  That plaintiff, we explained, “gained no enduring \nchange in the legal relationship” between herself and the \ndefendants. Id., at 86 (emphasis added; alterations and in-\nternal quotation marks omitted).  Although we left open the \nquestion presented in this case, see ibid., we described the \nplaintiff’s success at the preliminary injunction stage as “a \n \ntransient victory at the threshold of an action,” a “fleeting \nsuccess” that “did not establish that [the plaintiff] prevailed \non the gravamen of her plea for injunctive relief,” one “ten-\ntative [in] character, in view of the continuation of the liti-\ngation to definitively resolve the controversy,”  id., at 78, 83, \n84. \n  We recognize that neither opinion  resolves this case, but \nour holding today follows naturally from these precedents.  \nIn Sole, we established that the change in the legal rela-\ntionship between the parties must be “enduring.”  Id., at 86.   \nIn Buckhannon, we established that the change must be \n“judicially sanctioned.”  532 U. S., at 605.  Today, we estab-\nlish that the enduring nature of that change must itself be \njudicially sanctioned.  A plaintiff who wins a transient vic-\ntory on a preliminary injunction does not become a “prevail-\ning party” simply because external events convert the tran-\nsient  victory  into  a  lasting  one.  Rather,  a  plaintiff \n“prevails” under the statute when a court conclusively re-\nsolves a claim by granting enduring judicial relief on the \nmerits that materially alters the legal relationship between \nthe parties.* \n—————— \n*A different body of caselaw addresses when a defendant  is a “prevail-\ning party” for the purposes of other fee-shifting statutes.  Our decision  \ntoday should not be read to affect our previous holding that a defendant \nneed not obtain a favorable judgment on the merits to prevail, nor to \naddress the question we left open of whether a defendant must obtain a \npreclusive judgment in order to prevail.  See CRST Van Expedited, Inc.  \nv.  EEOC,  578  U. S.  419,  431−434  (2016).    As  we  have  explained, \n“[p]laintiffs and defendants come to court with different objectives.”   Id., \nat 431. \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 13 of 35\n10  LACKEY v. STINNIE  \n   \nOpinion of the Court \nC \n  The rule we establish today also serves the interests of \njudicial economy.  A straightforward, bright-line rule is \neasy to administer, reducing the risk of “a second major lit-\nigation” over attorney’s fees.  Cf. Hensley, 461 U. S., at 437.   \nThe drivers, however, suggest that our rule promotes sim-\nplicity at the cost of creating perverse incentives.  They fear \nthat government defendants who have lost at the prelimi-\nnary injunction stage will strategically moot litigation ra-\nther than risk a fee award were they to ultimately lose on  \nthe merits.  See Brief for Respondents 42−47.  We found \nsimilar concerns to be “entirely speculative” when we re-\njected the catalyst theory in Buckhannon, 532 U. S., at 608.   \nWe reiterate that such risk could arise in only a small num-\nber of contexts. After all, if a plaintiff “has a cause of action \nfor damages, a defendant’s change in conduct will not moot \nthe case.”  Id., at 609.  And even if the plaintiff seeks only\ninjunctive relief, voluntary cessation of the challenged con-\nduct does not moot an action “unless it is ‘absolutely clear \nthat the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably \nbe expected to recur.’”  Ibid. (quoting Friends of the Earth,  \n \nInc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528  \nU. S. 167, 189 (2000)); see also FBI v. Fikre, 601 U. S. 234,  \n241  (2024)  (characterizing  this  burden  as  “formidable”\n(quoting Friends of the Earth, 528 U. S., at 190)).  A survey\nasking public interest organizations to self-report on the \nimpact of Buckhannon does not change our minds.  See post, \nat 17−18 (JACKSON, J., dissenting).\n  It is Congress’s job to craft policy and ours to interpret \nthe words that codify it.  “Atextual judicial supplementation \nis particularly inappropriate when . . . Congress has shown \nthat it knows how to adopt the omitted language or provi-\nsion.”  Rotkiske v. Klemm, 589 U. S. 8, 14 (2019).  Congress \nhas shown that it knows how to empower courts to award \nattorney’s fees to plaintiffs who have enjoyed some success \nbut have not prevailed in a judgment on the merits.  In the \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 14 of 35\n  Cite as:  604 U. S. ____ (2025)  11  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nFreedom of Information Act, for example, Congress author-\nized courts to assess attorney’s fees when a complainant \nhas “substantially prevailed,” even if through “a voluntary \nor unilateral change in position by the agency.”  5 U. S. C.  \n§552(a)(4)(E).  If Congress determines that the rule we\nadopt today is unwise, it may amend the statutory lan-\nguage—just as it enacted §1988(b) itself in response to our \ndecision in Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Soci-\nety.  421 U.  S. 240; see Hensley, 461 U. S., at 429.  Until \nthen, “it is of course our job to apply faithfully the law Con-\ngress has written.”  Henson  v. Santander Consumer USA  \nInc., 582 U. S. 79, 89 (2017). \nD \n  The drivers urge the opposite conclusion, but we find \ntheir arguments unpersuasive. \n  First, the drivers, joined by the dissent, argue that the \ndictionary definitions support them.  But they assume that  \nthe favorable resolution of a dispute is tantamount to suc-\ncess on a  claim in a legal action. A “prevailing party,” how-\never, is defined in the latter sense—one who “successfully\nprosecutes the action,” who has “made a claim” against an-\nother and “has successfully maintained it.”  Black’s Law \nDictionary 1352.\n  Second, the drivers and dissent contend that §1988(b)\nwas  enacted  against  a  historical  backdrop  that  favored \nawarding interim costs at equity, including for preliminary \ninjunctions. See Brief for Respondents 19−21. The dissent  \nin Alyeska Pipeline similarly invoked “the well-established \npower of federal equity courts to award attorneys’ fees when \nthe interests of justice so require.”  421 U. S., at 272 (Mar-\nshall, J., dissenting). We rejected that argument, however, \nand determined that the American Rule supplied the de-\nfault rule at law and equity, subject to narrow historical ex-\nceptions not at issue here.  See id., at 241, 247 (majority \nopinion). \n  Next, the drivers argue that the availability of fees while  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 15 of 35\n12  LACKEY v. STINNIE  \n   \nOpinion of the Court \nlitigation is ongoing suggests that §1988(b) includes no fi-\nnality requirement. See Brief for Respondents 40−42. The \ndissent likewise points to our statement in Buckhannon  \nthat a “‘prevailing party’ is not intended to be limited to the \n \nvictor only after entry of a final judgment following a full \ntrial on the merits.”  532 U. S., at 607 (quoting H. R. Rep. \nNo. 94–1558, p. 7 (1976)); see post, at 15.  We have recog-\nnized that “Congress contemplated the award of fees pen-\ndente lite in some cases.”  Hanrahan, 446 U. S., at 757.  For \nexample, we have explained that, in school desegregation \ncases, “many final orders may issue in the course of the lit-\nigation” because injunctive relief “must prove its efficacy  \n. . . over a period of time and often with frequent modifica-\ntions.”  Bradley v. School Bd. of Richmond, 416 U. S. 696, \n723 (1974).  Our decisions simply indicate that attorney’s \nfees may be  awarded when conclusive, enduring judicial re-\nlief is meted out on an incremental basis.  Hanrahan, 446 \nU. S., at 758 (“Congress intended to permit the interim \naward of counsel fees only when a party has prevailed on \nthe merits of at least some of his claims.”).  Key language \non which the dissent relies—our statement that a party pre-\nvails when it “succeed[s] on any significant claim affording \nit some of the relief sought,” including relief on the merits \npendente lite—explained our rejection of the “central issue\ntest,” which would have required a party to prevail on its \ncentral claim in order to be awarded attorney’s fees.  Texas  \nState Teachers Assn., 489 U. S., at 791; see post, at 4. It did \nnot refer to preliminary relief.\n  The availability of fees following the entry of a court- \nordered consent decree is fully consistent with the rule we \nannounce today.  A consent decree reflects the parties’ own \nresolution of the merits, but it is approved and given force \nof law by the court.  See Firefighters v. Cleveland, 478 U. S.  \n501, 523 (1986).  Violation of a consent decree is enforceable \nby a citation for contempt.  Ibid.   So a consent decree is like  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 16 of 35\n  Cite as:  604 U. S. ____ (2025)  13  \n \nOpinion of the Court \na final judgment in the relevant ways: It conclusively re-\nsolves the claim, bears a judicial  imprimatur, and may \ngrant enduring relief that materially alters the legal rela-\ntionship between the parties.  That is why “[w]e have only \nawarded attorney’s fees where the plaintiff has received a \njudgment on the merits or obtained a court-ordered consent \ndecree.”  Buckhannon, 532 U. S., at 605 (citation omitted).  \nFor its part, the dissent conflates preliminary judicial relief \nthat becomes irreversible by way of mootness with relief  \nthat is permanent by virtue of a judicial order.  See post, at \n10−11.  That a preliminary order may sometimes “func-\ntion[ ] . . . like” a final order due to external circumstances,  \nsee post, at 11 (citation omitted), is not dispositive of the \nnature of the order. \n*  *  * \n  Section 1988(b) permits courts to award attorney’s fees to \na “prevailing party.”  A party “prevails” when a court con-\nclusively resolves his claim by granting enduring relief on \nthe merits that alters the legal relationship between the \nparties.  Critically, both the change in relationship and its \npermanence must result from a judicial order.  A prelimi-\nnary injunction, which temporarily preserves the parties’ \nlitigating positions based in part on a prediction of the like-\nlihood of success on the merits, does not render a plaintiff a \n“prevailing party.”  Nor do external events that moot the \naction and prevent the court from conclusively adjudicating \nthe claim.  Because the drivers in the present case gained \nonly preliminary injunctive relief before this action became \nmoot, they do not qualify as “prevailing part[ies]” eligible \nfor attorney’s fees under §1988(b).\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Cir-\ncuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further pro-\nceedings consistent with this opinion. \n \n  It is so ordered.  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 17 of 35\n  Cite as:  604 U.

Today, the Court holds that a plaintiff \nwho secures a preliminary injunction does not “prevail” un-\nder this fee-shifting statute, even when the preliminary in-\njunction provides meaningful relief and is never reversed \non the merits.  The Court maintains that this holding “fol-\nlows naturally from” our precedents.  Ante, at  9.  But that \nwill come as a surprise to the eleven Courts of Appeals that \nhave previously considered this issue; all of them agree that \nat least some preliminary injunctions trigger fee eligibility \nunder §1988(b).\n  Stated simply, the majority’s categorical preclusion of fee \nawards for any plaintiff who successfully obtains prelimi-\nnary injunctive relief is unwarranted.  It lacks any basis in\nthe text of §1988(b) and is plainly inconsistent with that \nstatutory provision’s clear objective, which is to encourage  \nattorneys to file civil rights actions on behalf of the most \nvulnerable people in our society.  The Court has now elimi-\nnated fee eligibility for all preliminary injunctions—even \nthose that effectively resolve the case.  But if Congress had  \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 18 of 35\n2  LACKEY v. STINNIE  \n   \nJACKSON,  J., dissenting  \nmeant for “prevailing party” status to hinge entirely on the \n“conclusive” nature of a judicial order, it could easily have \nsaid so.  It is the role of Congress, not this Court, to weigh \nconcerns about administrative ease against the benefits of \nguaranteeing individuals an opportunity to vindicate their \ncivil rights. \n  There is no persuasive reason to believe that Congress \nmeant to preclude fee awards for every plaintiff who secures \npreliminary injunctive relief but not a final judgment, no \nmatter the context.  Therefore, I respectfully dissent. \nI \nA \n  Nothing in §1988(b)’s text compels the conclusion that a \nplaintiff who obtains preliminary injunctive relief is never  \neligible for a fee award.  Section 1988(b) states simply that, \nin actions to enforce certain civil rights statutes, including \n42 U. S. C. §1983, “the court, in its discretion, may allow \nthe prevailing party, other than the United States, a rea-\nsonable attorney’s fee as part of the costs.”  §1988(b).  The \nmajority recognizes that “prevailing party” is a legal term \nof art and begins its analysis by asserting that this term \nmeans what legal dictionaries said it meant at the time that\n§1988(b) was enacted.\n  According to the majority’s preferred dictionary, a “pre-\nvailing party” is one “‘who successfully prosecutes the ac-\n \ntion or successfully defends against it.’” Ante,  at 5 (quoting\n \nBlack’s Law Dictionary 1352 (rev. 4th ed. 1968)).  Thus, pre-\nvailing party status turns on “‘whether, at the end of the \n \nsuit, or other proceeding, the party who has made a claim \nagainst the other, has successfully maintained it.’”  Ante, at \n \n6 (quoting Black’s Law Dictionary, at 1352).  Reasoning\nfrom this definition, the majority holds that preliminary in-\njunctions, which provide interim relief by their nature, can \nnever confer prevailing party status because they do not\n“conclusively resolve the rights of parties on the merits.”  \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 19 of 35\n  Cite as:  604 U. S. ____ (2025)  3 \n \nJACKSON,  J., dissenting  \nAnte, at 7.  \n  But the majority’s analysis inexplicably conflates the re-\nquirement for success when the suit ends (which is what the \ndictionary definition says) with a requirement that the suit \nend by virtue of a “conclusive” judicial ruling on the merits \nof the plaintiff ’s claims (which is nowhere in Black’s Law \n \nDictionary or anywhere else).  In other words, the majority’s \nreasoning elides the fact that a suit can end in various \nways—including through acts of the defendant or others \nthat moot the legal action.  Black’s Law Dictionary and its  \ncontemporaries simply require a court determining eligibil-\nity for a fee award to take stock of where things stand at \nthe end of the lawsuit. A prevailing party for §1988(b) pur-\nposes is one who has successfully maintained his claim (in \nthe manner I describe below, see Part II–A, infra) “when \nthe matter is finally set at rest.”  Black’s Law Dictionary, at  \n1352. \n  In essence, then, the majority errs by assuming that the \nonly kind of resolution to a suit that can precipitate a fee \naward is a “conclusive” final judgment on the merits.  See, \ne.g.,  ante, at 6–7, 9, 12. That assumption is unfounded. The \ntext of the fee statute does not require a final  judgment in \nthe party’s favor, “conclusive” or otherwise.  Nor does any \ndictionary definition of “prevailing party” to which the ma-\njority cites.  Rather, according to Black’s Law Dictionary, a  \n“prevailing party” is simply a “part[y] to a suit who success-\nfully prosecutes the action or successfully defends against \nit, prevailing on the main issue, even though not to the ex-\ntent of his original contention.”  Black’s Law Dictionary, at \n1352.  Ballentine’s Law Dictionary is substantially similar; \nit defines “prevailing party” as “[t]he party who is success-\nful or partially successful in an action, so as to be entitled \nto costs.”  Ballentine’s Law Dictionary 985 (3d ed. 1969). \n  Significantly for present purposes, both dictionaries fur-\nther emphasize that “[t]o be [a prevailing party] does not\ndepend upon the degree of success at different stages of the  \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 20 of 35\n4  LACKEY v. STINNIE  \n   \nJACKSON,  J., dissenting  \nsuit, but whether, at the end of the suit . . . the party who \nhas made a claim against the other, has successfully main-\ntained it.” Black’s Law Dictionary, at 1352; accord, Ballen-\ntine’s Law Dictionary, at 985.  Yet, today, the majority de-\nmands  that,  in  order  to  prevail,  the  party  must  have \nachieved a certain degree of success at a certain point in the \ncase: a conclusive final judgment in his favor at the end of \nlitigation. \nB \n  This Court has not previously linked prevailing party sta-\ntus to securing a conclusive final judgment.  Quite to the \ncontrary, we have held that a prevailing party for fee-\nshifting purposes is one who has “succeeded on any signifi-\ncant claim affording it some of the relief sought, either pen-\ndente lite”—i.e., pending the suit—“or at the conclusion of \nthe litigation.”  Texas State Teachers Assn. v. Garland In-\ndependent School Dist., 489 U. S. 782, 791 (1989).  That is,  \na plaintiff prevails when he accomplishes his lawsuit’s “ob-\njectiv[e],” which is to achieve “a material alteration in the\nlegal relationship between the parties.”  CRST Van Expe-\ndited, Inc. v. EEOC, 578 U. S. 419, 431 (2016).  This is be-\ncause, for a plaintiff, “[a]t the end of the rainbow lies not a \njudgment, but some action (or cessation of action) by the \ndefendant that the judgment produces—the payment of \ndamages, or some specific performance, or the termination \nof some conduct.”  Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U. S. 755, 761  \n(1987).\n  A plaintiff who secures a preliminary injunction award-\ning actual relief on the merits of his claim that is never re-\nversed by a final decision of the court has “successfully\nmaintained” his claim “at the end.” Black’s Law Dictionary,  \nat 1352.  Such a plaintiff has achieved what he has “come \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 21 of 35\n  Cite as:  604 U. S. ____ (2025)  5 \n \nJACKSON,  J., dissenting  \nto court” for—the desired “alteration in the legal relation-\nship between the parties.”  CRST, 578 U. S., at 431.1  \n  Take this case, for example.  At the point it ended—when  \nthe District Court dismissed the litigation as moot—re-\nspondents had secured a preliminary injunction against the \nCommissioner of the Virginia Department of Motor Vehi-\ncles.  That order enabled respondents to drive their cars on\nVirginia’s highways for sixteen months, over the Commis-\nsioner’s objection. And, because the District Court’s interim  \naward had facilitated respondents’ access to the road as li-\ncensed drivers, they had prevailed on the merits of their\nclaim in every meaningful sense.  Put another way, “at the \nend of the litigation,” respondents did not “leav[e] the court-\nhouse  emptyhanded.”    Sole  v.  Wyner,  551  U. S.  74,  78  \n(2007). Instead, they departed having accomplished exactly \nwhat they had sought to achieve.  The fact that respondents \nachieved their goal via a preliminary court ruling, as op-\nposed to a final judgment, is irrelevant, for “[n]othing in the \nlanguage of §1988 conditions the District Court’s power to \naward fees on full litigation of the issues or on a judicial \ndetermination that the plaintiff ’s rights have been vio-\n \nlated.”  Maher v. Gagne, 448 U. S. 122, 129 (1980) (empha-\nsis added).\n  Juxtapose that reality with the text of other statutes that\nmake “prevailing party” status expressly dependent on the\nentry of a final order.  For example, the Emergency School\nAid Act of 1972—enacted just four years before §1988(b)— \nstates that, “[u]pon the entry of a final order,” a court hear-\ning a school desegregation case may “allow the prevailing \nparty, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney’s  \n—————— \n1There are, of course, other kinds of preliminary injunctive orders, in-\n \ncluding orders that maintain the status quo.  All that is  necessary to re-\nject the majority’s categorical rule is the recognition that at least some  \npreliminary injunctions afford the type of material change that confers  \nprevailing party status.  \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 22 of 35\n6  LACKEY v. STINNIE  \n   \nJACKSON,  J., dissenting  \nfee as part of the costs.”  20 U. S. C. §1617 (repealed) (em-\nphasis added).  Several statutes enacted after §1988(b) are \nsimilarly explicit about when a fee award must be fastened \nto a final judgment.  See, e.g., 28 U.  S. C. §2412(d)(2)(H) (de-\nfining “prevailing party” in eminent domain proceedings to \n“mea[n] a party who obtains a final judgment” of a certain \namount); 15 U. S. C. §6104(d) (authorizing courts hearing \nactions under the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and \nAbuse Prevention Act to award “reasonable fees . . . to the  \nprevailing party” upon “issuing any final order”).  The fact \nthat §1988(b) lacks any such language confirms that a con-\nclusive ruling from the court in the form of a final judgment \nis not a prerequisite for a fee award under that statute.  \nC \n  The majority disregards these important context clues \nand focuses instead on a provision of the Freedom of Infor-\nmation Act (FOIA) that authorizes fee awards for a “com-\nplainant” who “has substantially prevailed” by “obtain[ing] \nrelief through either—(I) a judicial order, or an enforceable \nwritten agreement or consent decree; or (II) a voluntary or \nunilateral change in position by the agency.”  5 U. S. C.  \n§552(a)(4)(E).  The  term  “prevailing  party”  appears  no-\nwhere in this FOIA provision.  But, no matter: The majority  \nnevertheless suggests that this is how Congress authorizes \nfee shifting for “plaintiffs who have enjoyed some success \nbut have not prevailed in a judgment on the merits.”  Ante,  \nat 10. \n  The problem is that Congress had a much more targeted \nobjective when it enacted §552(a)(4)(E).  It sought merely to\nrepudiate this Court’s decision in Buckhannon Board & \nCare Home,  Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and Hu-\nman Resources, 532 U.  S. 598, 606 (2001), which had held \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 23 of 35\n  Cite as:  604 U. S. ____ (2025)  7 \n \nJACKSON,  J., dissenting  \nthat a plaintiff must obtain some “judicial relief ” to be eli-\n \ngible for a fee award in FOIA cases.2  Since the point of \n§552(a)(4)(E) was to “abrogat[e] the rule of Buckhannon in \nthe FOIA context and reviv[e] the possibility of FOIA fee \nawards in the absence of a court decree,” Brayton v. Office \nof U. S. Trade Rep., 641 F. 3d 521, 525 (CADC 2011), that \nstatutory provision sheds no light whatsoever on whether \nthe term “prevailing party” requires a plaintiff to secure a \nconclusive ruling on the merits to qualify as a prevailing \nparty for purposes of §1988(b). \n  In short, while the majority insists that obtaining a pre-\nliminary injunction can never suffice for a fee award under \n§1988(b) “[b]ecause preliminary injunctions do not conclu-\nsively resolve the rights of parties on the merits,” ante, at \n7, the text of §1988(b), contemporary dictionary definitions, \nand our precedents require far less. All of the Courts of Ap-\npeals to consider the question—eleven in total—understood \nthis and thus correctly held that, for fee-shifting purposes, \nit is possible for a party to prevail based on a preliminary \nruling.3  The majority’s reading of “prevailing party” in \n—————— \n2Congress enacted 5 U. S. C. §552(a)(4)(E) because Buckhannon had  \n \nempowered Government agencies to “stonewall valid FOIA claims” and \nthen prevent an award of attorney’s fees by “disclosing the documents at \nthe last moment before judgment,” thereby mooting the case.  Brayton v.  \nOffice of U.  S. Trade Rep., 641 F. 3d 521, 525 (CADC 2011).  Under  Buck-\nhannon, such plaintiffs were not eligible for fee awards because they had \nnot obtained any judicial order—preliminary, final, or otherwise.  This  \nstrategic behavior ensured that FOIA plaintiffs never became eligible for \nfee awards despite incurring significant costs, so Congress intervened.   \n641 F. 3d, at 525.  \n3See, e.g.,  Haley v.  Pataki, 106 F. 3d 478, 484 (CA2 1997); Singer \n \nMgmt. Consultants, Inc.  v.  Milgram, 650 F. 3d 223, 229–230, and n.  4 \n(CA3 2011) (en banc); Stinnie v.  Holcomb, 77 F. 4th 200, 210 (CA4 2023)  \n(en banc) (case below); Dearmore v.  Garland, 519 F. 3d 517, 524 (CA5  \n2008); Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio  Region v.

STINNIE  \n   \nJACKSON,  J., dissenting  \n§1988(b) makes obtaining a court’s conclusive final judg-\nment the hallmark of that status in a manner that is both  \nnovel and in many ways anathema to the legal term of art \nthat Congress actually chose.  \nII  \nA \n  So what does it take to qualify as a “prevailing party” for \npurposes of this fee-shifting statute?  In Farrar  v. Hobby, \n506 U. S. 103 (1992), we explained that a plaintiff “‘pre-\n \nvails’” if he receives (1) “actual relief on the merits of his \n \nclaim” in a manner that (2) “materially alters the legal re-\nlationship between the parties by modifying the defendant’s \nbehavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff.”  Id.,  \nat 111–112; see also Lefemine v. Wideman, 568 U. S. 1, 4  \n(2012) (per curiam).  This test is well established, and it \nleads inexorably to the conclusion that, in some circum-\nstances, an unreversed preliminary injunction can confer \nprevailing party status.\n  Start with the requirement of a “‘material alteration of \n \nthe legal relationship of the parties,’” which we have re-\n \npeatedly called the “‘touchstone’” of the prevailing party in-\n   \nquiry. Sole, 551 U. S., at 82 (quoting Garland, 489 U. S., at \n792–793). A plaintiff need not obtain all of the relief he has \nrequested in the lawsuit to satisfy this requirement.  In-\nstead, under our precedents, a plaintiff who has achieved \neven  “‘some  of  the  benefit’”  he  sought  has secured  the  \n   \nchange  in  the  parties’  legal  relationship  necessary  to \n“cros[s] the threshold to a fee award of some kind.”  Id., at \n791–792 (quoting Nadeau v. Helgemoe, 581 F. 2d 275, 278– \n—————— \n2013); Kansas Jud. Watch v. Stout, 653 F. 3d 1230, 1232, 1238–1239  \n(CA10 2011); Common Cause Ga. v.  Georgia, 17 F. 4th 102, 107 (CA11  \n2021); Select Milk  Producers, Inc.  v.  Johanns, 400 F. 3d 939, 942, 948– \n949 (CADC 2005).  The First Circuit has not yet considered the issue.  \nSee Sinapi v.  Rhode Island Bd. of Bar Examiners, 910 F. 3d 544, 552  \n(2018). \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 25 of 35\n  Cite as:  604 U. S. ____ (2025)  9 \n \nJACKSON,  J., dissenting  \n279 (CA1 1978); emphasis added).\n  A permanent injunction—just like a declaratory judg-\nment or a damages award—“will usually satisfy that test,” \nLefemine, 568 U. S., at 4, because permanent injunctive re-\nlief generally “affects the behavior of the defendant toward \nthe plaintiff,” Rhodes v. Stewart, 488 U. S. 1, 4 (1988) (per \ncuriam).  At least some preliminary injunctions also qual-\nify.  The preliminary injunction in this case, for example, \nprovided respondents with actual relief by reinstating their \nsuspended licenses, allowing them to drive without fear of \nsanction for failing to repay their fines and fees.  For the \nroughly sixteen months that the preliminary injunction \nwas in place, “that ruling worked the requisite material al-\nteration in the parties’ relationship” by permitting respond-\nents to engage in conduct that would have been prohibited \notherwise.  Lefemine, 568 U. S., at 5. \n  It is indisputable that the preliminary injunction the Dis-\ntrict Court issued provided a “direc[t] benefit” to respond-\nents.  Farrar,  506  U. S.,  at  111.   That  relief  was  also \nawarded “‘on the merits.’”  Lefemine, 568 U. S., at 4 (quot-\n   \ning Farrar, 506 U. S., at 111–112).  We have long taken a \n“practical” approach to the merits inquiry in this context.  \nHanrahan v. Hampton, 446 U. S. 754, 758 (1980) (per cu-\nriam).  Under that approach, relief is granted “on the mer-\nits” when it provides “a resolution of the dispute which \nchanges the legal relationship between [the plaintiff] and \nthe defendant.” Garland, 489 U. S., at 792 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).\n  Notably, for prevailing party status, we have not required \nthat a court actually determine whether a legal claim is \nmeritorious.  The majority acknowledges our holding that \nthe entry of a consent decree following “the parties’ own res-\nolution of the merits” counts.  Ante, at 12; see Farrar, 506  \nU. S., at 111 (recognizing that a consent decree satisfies the \nrequirement that the plaintiff “obtain at least some relief \non the merits of his claim”). Indeed, in Maher, we upheld a  \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 26 of 35\n10  LACKEY v. STINNIE  \n   \nJACKSON,  J., dissenting  \nfee award based on a consent decree that “did not purport \nto adjudicate” the plaintiff ’s claims at all.  448 U. S., at 126,  \n \nn. 8, 129.  We have also suggested that default judgments, \nwhich do not involve any assessment of the merits of the \nplaintiff ’s  claims,  “almost  invariably  give  rise  to  fee \n \nawards.”  Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 579 U. S.  \n197, 208, n. 3 (2016). \n  A court’s entry of a preliminary injunction—which does  \nrequire a judge to make a preliminary assessment of the \nmerits—provides a basis for prevailing party status that is \nat least as strong as a consent decree or a default judgment.  \nPlaintiffs seeking the “extraordinary remedy” of a prelimi-\nnary injunction must make a “clear showing” that they are \n“likely to succeed on the merits.”  Winter v.  Natural Re-\nsources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U. S. 7, 20, 22 (2008).  \nAnd the court’s decision to order preliminary injunctive re-\nlief often involves “searching” proceedings, Sole, 551 U. S.,  \nat 84, even though the “evidence . . . is less complete than\nin a trial on the merits,” University of Tex. v. Camenisch, \n451 U. S. 390, 395 (1981).\n  In this case, the District Court thoroughly assessed the \nmerits of respondents’ claims and granted their request for \npreliminary injunctive relief after extensive briefing and an\nevidentiary hearing during which multiple witnesses testi-\nfied.  It blinks reality to suggest that the District Court’s \norder requiring the Commissioner to give respondents their \nlicenses back now—based on the court’s conclusion that re-\nspondents were likely to succeed if this matter proceeded to \ntrial—was “not the stuff of which legal victories are made.”  \nHewitt, 482 U. S., at 760. \n  It is no answer to simply declare by ipse dixit that pre-\nliminary injunctions are materially different from consent \ndecrees because “a consent decree is like a final judgment \nin the relevant ways”—i.e., “[i]t conclusively resolves the\nclaim, bears a judicial imprimatur, and may grant enduring \nrelief that materially alters the legal relationship between \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 27 of 35\n  Cite as:  604 U. S. ____ (2025)  11  \n \nJACKSON,  J., dissenting  \nthe parties.” Ante, at 12–13.  The very question before us is \nthe relevance of this kind of finality to the prevailing party \ndetermination.  And, luckily, that question  has already \nbeen answered: Neither the text of §1988(b) nor any of this \nCourt’s past cases make fee eligibility dependent on the en-\ntry of a conclusive final judgment, as I explained above. \n  In any event, if a plaintiff need only obtain an order that \nis “like a final judgment” to prevail, ibid., it is not at all \nclear why at least some preliminary injunctions would not \ncount.  Consider, for example, a dispute in which the dis-\ntrict court reviews the evidence and the parties’ arguments \nand enters the type of preliminary injunction that changes \nthe legal relationship of the parties.  The case proceeds but \nthen becomes moot such that the litigation ends; the pre-\nliminary injunction is not—and can never be—reversed by \na subsequent order of the court.  In this scenario, all the \npurportedly “relevant” characteristics of a consent decree \nexist, because the parties’ legal relationship was materially \naltered by judicial imprimatur, and that preliminary relief \nis conclusive insofar as the case has ended and the ruling\ncannot be undone by a later determination.  In this circum-\nstance, the preliminary injunction “functions much like the \ngrant of an irreversible partial summary judgment on the \nmerits,” Northern Cheyenne Tribe v. Jackson, 433 F. 3d \n1083, 1086 (CA8 2006), which all appear to agree would suf-\nfice to confer fee eligibility under §1988(b). \nB \n  Our decisions in Buckhannon, 532 U. S. 598, and Sole, \n551 U. S. 74, are not to the contrary.  The majority cites\nthese two decisions to support its view that obtaining a pre-\nliminary injunction is never sufficient to qualify the recipi-\nent for a fee award under §1988(b).   Ante, at 8–9.  But those \ncases hold no such thing.  Instead, they simply clarify that, \nfor a plaintiff to prevail, the requisite “change in the legal \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 28 of 35\n12  LACKEY v. STINNIE  \n   \nJACKSON,  J., dissenting  \nrelationship of the parties” must be both “judicially sanc-\ntioned,” Buckhannon, 532 U. S., at 605, and “enduring,” \nSole, 551 U. S., at 86.  Neither case mandates the majority’s \ncategorical rule.\nIn Buckhannon, this Court rejected the so-called “cata-\nlyst theory,” under which a plaintiff could collect a fee  \naward as a “prevailing party” without securing any judicial \nrelief so long as the lawsuit produced “a voluntary change \nin the defendant’s conduct.”  532 U.  S., at 601.  We held that \nsuch a voluntary change, “although perhaps accomplishing \nwhat the plaintiff sought to achieve by the lawsuit, lacks \nthe necessary judicial imprimatur on the change” to trigger \nfee eligibility.  Id., at 605.  In Sole, we considered whether  \na plaintiff who obtains a preliminary injunction but is sub-\nsequently denied a permanent one prevails for fee purposes \nunder §1988(b).  551 U. S., at 77.  We explained that when \na plaintiff ’s “initial victory” at the preliminary injunction \n \nstage is “superseded” by a non-favorable final “ruling on the \nmerits,” he does not qualify as a “prevailing party,” because \nthe relief he received was not “enduring.”  Id., at 84–86. \n  A preliminary injunction that mandates a judicially sanc-\ntioned legal change in the parties’ relationship  and is never \nreversed by a final ruling on the merits satisfies both Buck-\nhannon and Sole. A court that issues interim injunctive re-\nlief unquestionably gives its “judicial imprimatur” to the \nchange afforded, as Buckhannon requires.  532 U. S., at \n605.  For its part, Sole stands merely for the proposition\nthat a party can be divested of “prevailing party” status if\nhis “success rested on a premise the District Court ulti-\nmately rejected.”  551 U. S., at 84–86.  But Sole is inappo-\nsite when a subsequent final decision does not thwart the \njudge-sanctioned basis for the preliminary injunction.  In-\ndeed, Sole expressly said so, by specifically reserving the\nquestion “whether, in the absence of a final decision on the \nmerits of a claim for permanent injunctive relief, success in \ngaining a preliminary injunction may sometimes warrant \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 29 of 35\n  Cite as:  604 U. S. ____ (2025)  13  \n \nJACKSON,  J., dissenting  \nan award of counsel fees,” id., at 86—the precise issue that \nis before the Court today. \n  The majority thus overreads our precedents to support its \nblanket rule that preliminary injunctions can never support \nfee awards. Ante, at 7–9.  With respect to Sole in particular, \nit is true that we  characterized the preliminary injunction \nat issue there as “fleeting” and “tentative.” 551 U. S., at 83– \n84; see also ante, at 9 (contrasting interim relief with relief \nthat “last[s]”).  But the  Sole Court did not tie the require-\nment for “enduring” relief to the inherent permanence of \nthe relevant judicial order.  Instead, we made crystal clear \nthat “[o]f controlling importance to our decision” was the \nfact that “the eventual ruling on the merits for defendants, \nafter both sides considered the case fit for final adjudica-\ntion, superseded the preliminary ruling.”  551 U. S., at 84– \n85 (emphasis added); see also  id., at 78 (observing that  a \nplaintiff does not prevail if “at the end of the litigation, her\ninitial success is undone and she leaves the courthouse  \nemptyhanded”).\n  At the end of the day, Sole should be taken to mean only \nwhat it expressly holds: Preliminary injunctive relief that \nis subsequently superseded by a final judgment reversing \nthe ruling does not endure for fee-shifting purposes.  Here,  \nthe  preliminary  injunction  provided  actual  relief  to  re-\nspondents for more than sixteen months, and there was no  \nSole-like supplanting of that preliminary relief by a subse-\nquent court order. \nIII  \nA \n  In addition to misinterpreting the text of §1988(b) and \nmisconstruing our precedents, the majority ignores Con-\ngress’s clear intent to expand access to justice.  It is puz-\nzling, to say the least, that the majority seems to go out of \nits way to adopt a rule that categorically prohibits fee shift-\ning while interpreting a statute that expressly authorizes \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 30 of 35\n14  LACKEY v. STINNIE  \n   \nJACKSON,  J., dissenting  \nfee awards. \n  There is no dispute that Congress enacted §1988(b) “for a \nspecific purpose”: to respond to this Court’s decision in  \nAlyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U. S.  \n240 (1975), which had rejected the “former equitable prac-\ntice of awarding attorney’s fees to the prevailing party in\ncertain civil rights cases.” Farrar, 506 U. S., at 118 (O’Con-\nnor, J., concurring).  The Alyeska Court held that, absent  \nstatutory authorization, courts should not depart from the \n“‘American Rule,’” under which litigants ordinarily bear \n   \ntheir own attorney’s fees.  421 U. S., at 247.  Congress\nswiftly enacted §1988(b) in Alyeska’s wake to codify a civil \nrights exception to the American Rule.  The majority does \nnot, and cannot, dispute that Congress’s intent was “to en-\nsure ‘effective access to the judicial process’ for persons with \ncivil rights grievances.”  Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S.  \n424,  429  (1983)  (quoting  H. R.  Rep.  No.  94–1558,  p. 1 \n(1976)).\n  Consistent with that “clear congressional intent,” this  \nCourt has previously recognized that fee awards should be \navailable  to  “partially  prevailing  civil  rights  plaintiffs.”  \nGarland, 489 U. S., at 790.  This principle is, in fact, readily \napparent from the statute’s enactment history.  See Buck-\nhannon, 532 U. S., at 607.  The history demonstrates that \nthe question of awarding fees for success based on interim \norders was not overlooked by the legislature; to the con-\ntrary, Congress specifically “contemplated the award of fees \npendente lite,” at least where a party “has established his \nentitlement to some relief on the merits of his claims.”  Han-\nrahan, 446 U. S., at 757 (citing S. Rep. No. 94–1011, p. 5 \n(1976); H. R. Rep. No. 94–1558, at 7–8).\n  The majority says that Congress merely wanted §1988(b)\nto authorize fee awards when “conclusive, enduring judicial \nrelief is meted out on an incremental basis.”  Ante, at 12.  \nBut that is not what the historical record establishes, and \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 31 of 35\n  Cite as:  604 U. S. ____ (2025)  15  \n \nJACKSON,  J., dissenting  \nBuckhannon flatly rejects this contention.  There, we spe-\ncifically observed that, per §1988(b)’s legislative history, \n“‘“prevailing party” is not intended to be limited to the vic-\n  \ntor only after entry of a final judgment following a full trial \non  the  merits.’”    532  U. S.,  at  607  (quoting  H. R. Rep.   \n \nNo. 94–1558, at 7); see also Hanrahan, 446 U.  S., at 756– \n757.  The legislative history is likewise unequivocal that a \nprevailing party for §1988(b) purposes should “also include \na litigant who succeeds even if the case is concluded prior \nto  a  full  evidentiary  hearing  before  a  judge  or  jury.”  \nH. R. Rep. No. 94–1558, at 7. \nB \n  Nor could a Congress that wished to authorize fee awards \nfor civil rights victories have intended the absurdities that \nwill result from the majority’s categorical preclusion of pre-\nliminary injunctive relief from §1988(b).  To state the obvi-\nous, the majority’s bright-line rule lacks the nuance that is \nneeded to account for the various circumstances in which a  \npreliminary injunction may be “preliminary” in name only. \n  One example is the plaintiff who requests a preliminary \ninjunction to achieve an interim result, given the timeframe \nat issue.  “When protestors seek an injunction to exercise \ntheir First Amendment rights at a specific time and place—\nsay to demonstrate at a Saturday parade—a preliminary \ninjunction will give them all the court-ordered relief they \nneed  and  the  end  of  the  parade  will  moot  the  case.”  \nMcQueary v. Conway, 614 F. 3d 591, 599 (CA6 2010).  Thus,  \nthe Courts of Appeals regularly hold that plaintiffs who suc-\ncessfully obtain a preliminary injunction that permits them \nto engage in the otherwise prohibited conduct “prevail” for \nfee-shifting purposes. See, e.g., Young v.  Chicago, 202 F. 3d  \n1000, 1000–1001 (CA7 2000) (per curiam) (awarding fees to \nplaintiffs who obtained a preliminary injunction to protest\na political convention even though the “suit became moot \nbefore a definitive determination of its merits” could be  \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 32 of 35\n16  LACKEY v. STINNIE  \n   \nJACKSON,  J., dissenting  \nmade).\n  In  its  rush  to  carve  preliminary  injunctions  out  of \n§1988(b), the majority also overlooks situations in which \ncourts have, in fact, conclusively resolved the merits of a \nplaintiff ’s claims at the preliminary injunction stage.  A \n \ntrial court might definitively determine that a law is “‘“fa-\n  \ncially unconstitutional”’” in the course of granting prelimi-\n  \nnary relief, for example.  Singer Mgmt. Consultants, Inc. v. \nMilgram, 650 F. 3d 223, 229–230, and n. 4 (CA3 2011) (en \nbanc) (quoting People Against Police Violence v. Pittsburgh, \n520 F. 3d 226, 229 (CA3 2008)).  But the majority nonethe-\nless adopts a sweeping rule under which preliminary in-\njunctions can never be the basis for fee eligibility. \n  And to what end?  The majority seeks to justify its broad \nholding on the grounds that it discourages fee disputes and \nthereby “serves the interests of judicial economy.”  Ante, at \n10. But concerns about judicial administration cannot sup-\nplant Congress’s clear intent to promote access to justice via \nfee shifting in civil rights cases. \n  What is more, it is actually the majority’s categorical rule \nthat will promote wasteful litigation and incentivize liti-\ngants to manipulate fee liability.  Under the majority’s rule, \na plaintiff who has incurred substantial attorney’s fees in \norder to secure a preliminary injunction that provides all \nthe relief he needs will face a choice: He may either concede \nthat the litigation has run its course and pay his own fees,\nor he may seek to litigate the case to final judgment in order \nto secure a fee award.  No one would blame a plaintiff with \na strong case for choosing the latter option.  But such addi-\ntional litigation is an inefficient waste of judicial resources \nif the plaintiff has already achieved his objective at an ear-\nlier part of the case.\n  Worse still, the majority’s rule appears to preference con-\nservation of judicial resources over the maintenance of mer-\nitorious civil rights lawsuits, to the extent that excluding \npreliminary injunctive relief from  §1988(b) facilitates the \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 33 of 35\n  Cite as:  604 U. S. ____ (2025)  17  \n \nJACKSON,  J., dissenting  \nstrategic mooting of cases by defendants to avoid paying at-\ntorney’s fees.  This case illustrates precisely that problem.  \nAfter a robust evidentiary hearing, the District Court is-\nsued a comprehensive opinion that preliminarily enjoined \nthe  Commissioner  from  enforcing  the  challenged  law\nagainst respondents.  Seeing the writing on the wall, the \nCommissioner sought and obtained a stay of the case—over \nrespondents’ objections—based on his representation that \nthe legislature was likely to repeal the challenged law.  The \nCommissioner then successfully lobbied the legislature to \nrepeal the legislation, emphasizing that doing so would, in \nhis words, “result in [respondents’] pending litigation being \ndismissed, relieving the Department from continuing to in-\ncur costly legal fees.”  App. 409.\n  As the Fourth Circuit observed, precluding fee shifting in \nthis scenario is manifestly inequitable, because it leaves re-\nspondents “holding the bag” for considerable litigation fees \ndespite—and largely because of—their having succeeded in \nobtaining preliminary relief.  Stinnie v. Holcomb, 77 F. 4th \n200, 210 (2023) (en banc). Ironically, it was the strength of \nrespondents’ challenge as verified by the court’s prelimi-\nnary order that prompted both the change in law and the \nCommissioner’s robust effort to stiff the plaintiffs with re-\nspect to attorney’s fees.  Moreover, it is hardly a revelation \nthat lawyers who would otherwise be willing to litigate mer-\nitorious civil rights cases (i.e., matters in which interim re-\nlief is critical due to ongoing civil rights violations) will \nlikely be discouraged from taking on such representations \nif fee awards can be so easily thwarted. \n  The majority dismisses concerns about strategic mooting \nas both “‘entirely speculative’” and likely to “arise in only a \n   \nsmall number of contexts.” Ante, at 10 (quoting  Buckhan-\nnon, 532 U. S., at 608).  But, as I have shown, the facts of \nthis very case belie the majority’s nonchalance, particularly \nin light of the Buckhannon experience.  Research suggests \nthat the Court’s rejection of the catalyst theory in that case \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 34 of 35\n18  LACKEY v. STINNIE  \n   \nJACKSON,  J., dissenting  \nhad the predictable practical effect of discouraging public \ninterest organizations and private attorneys from taking on \ncivil rights actions.  C.  Albiston & L. Nielsen, The Proce-\ndural  Attack  on  Civil  Rights:  The  Empirical  Reality  of \nBuckhannon  for  the  Private  Attorney  General,  54 \nUCLA L. Rev. 1087, 1092 (2007); cf. n. 2, supra.  Similarly, \na multitude of legal advocacy groups have filed  amicus  \nbriefs in this case to explain that losing the ability to recoup \nfees for securing interim relief will jeopardize their mis-\nsions. See, e.g., Brief for Alliance Defending Freedom et al.  \nas Amici Curiae 7–10; Brief for American Civil Liberties \nUnion et al. as Amici Curiae 28–30; Brief for Lawyers’ Com-\nmittee for Civil Rights Under Law et al. as Amici Curiae  \n17–18. \n  There is thus every reason to believe that the net result \nof today’s decision will be less civil rights enforcement in \nthe long run.  Without irony, the majority reads a statute \nthat was “enacted to [e]nsure that private citizens have a \nmeaningful opportunity to vindicate their [civil] rights,”  \nPennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens’ Council for Clean  \nAir, 478 U. S. 546, 559 (1986), as if Congress meant to make \nprivate civil rights enforcement harder to achieve. \n*  *  * \n  The majority holds that obtaining a preliminary injunc-\ntion never entitles a plaintiff to fees under §1988(b).  In do-\ning so, it overrules the decisions of every Court of Appeals \nto consider the issue, relies on an atextual “conclusive judg-\nment” requirement, and ignores both our precedents and \nCongress’s intent.\n  It is quite true that Congress has demonstrated its ability \nto fix our mistakes in this realm.  Ante, at 11.  But, in my \nview, rather than relying on Congress to check our work, \nwe should give full effect to the plain text and remedial pur-\npose of §1988(b) in the first instance.  This Court should \nhave held that, when a court hearing a civil rights lawsuit \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC     Document 255-1     Filed 03/11/25     Page 35 of 35\n  Cite as:  604 U. S. ____ (2025)  19  \n \nJACKSON,  J., dissenting  \nissues a preliminary injunction that materially alters the \nrelationship between the parties and is never reversed, the \nrequesting party “prevails” for fee-shifting purposes and is \nthus eligible for a fee award under §1988(b).

Intervening factors arising after a country’s original TPS designation, such as subsequent \nnatural  disasters,  issues  of  governance,  housing,  health  care,  poverty,  crime,  general  security,  and  other \nhumanitarian considerations were considered relevant to determining whether a country continued to meet the \nconditions for continuing TPS designation. This was true regardless of whether those intervening factors had any \nconnection to the event that formed the basis for the original designation or to the country’s recovery from that \noriginating event.” \n \n10  The district court rejected the Government’s contention that Arlington Heights did not provide the proper legal \n  standard in light of Trump v. Hawaii, ––– U.S. ––––, 138 S. Ct. 2392, 201 L.Ed.2d 775 (2018), concluding that the \nlatter case was inapplicable because the decisions to terminate TPS did not rest on the same national security or \nforeign policy concerns. The district court alternative concluded that, even under Trump v. Hawaii, Plaintiffs had \nraised “serious questions” as to the merits of their EPC claim. \n \n11  Under that order, the Government stipulated that the TPS designations for Sudan, Nicaragua, Haiti, and El Salvador \n  will remain in effect on a nationwide basis until the later of (a) 120 days following the issuance of any mandate to \nthe district court reversing the injunction or (b) the Secretary’s previously announced termination date. \n \n12  In City of Rialto, we identified “two ‘guiding principles,’ ” the first of which we have already discussed, and the \n  second of which is “whether Plaintiffs’ claim is ripe.” 581 F.3d at 875 (citation omitted). Because the ripeness of \nPlaintiffs’ claim in this case is neither in dispute nor significant to our analysis, we did not need to address it at \nlength. \n \n1  I express no view on the merits of Plaintiffs’ APA procedural claim because we lack jurisdiction to decide that claim. \n35 \n \n\nRamos v. Wolf, 975 F.3d 872 (2020)   \n \n  Righthaven LLC v. Hoehn, 716 F.3d 1166, 1173 (9th Cir. 2013) (holding it “not appropriate” to resolve the merits in \nthe alternative); see also Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 101, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 \n(1998) (rejecting concept of assuming “hypothetical jurisdiction” to rule on the merits). \n \n2  My dissenting colleague does not dispute that the district court erred under Department of Commerce in ordering \n  discovery before the administrative record was filed or that the district court relied on documents outside the \nadministrative record. Dissent at 923–25. \n \n3  The term “universal” rather than “nationwide” injunction is more “precise,” Trump v. Hawaii, ––– U.S. ––––, 138 S. \n  Ct. 2392, 2425 n.1, 201 L.Ed.2d 775 (2018) (Thomas, J., concurring), because it refers to who is protected and bound \nby the injunction—in this context, everyone, including nonparties. \n \n4  The Supreme Court recently declined to address the propriety of universal injunctions in Department of Homeland \n  Security v. Regents of the University of California, ––– U.S. ––––, 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1916 n.7, 207 L.Ed.2d 353 (2020). \n \n5  We have also justified universal injunctions on the ground that a more limited injunction would “needlessly \n  complicate” immigration enforcement. E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 950 F.3d 1242, 1284 (9th Cir. 2020). \nThis justification also has nothing to do with giving full relief to plaintiffs. What’s more, “it is the Executive Branch, \nnot the courts, that [is] charged with enforcing the immigration laws.” Doe #1 v. Trump, 957 F.3d 1050, 1097 (9th \nCir. 2020) (Bress, J., dissenting). Any decision by the judicial branch about the best way to enforce immigration law is \n“far outside our role and competence” and a severe overreach. Id. \n \n6  My dissenting colleague suggests a universal injunction would be proper here because revoking a TPS designation is \n  a “single decision on a nationwide policy” that does not involve “case-by-case enforcement.” Dissent at 924 n.12. \nBut this ignores the key question for injunctive relief: whether a more limited injunction would have afforded \nPlaintiffs complete relief. Regardless, there is no dispute that the district court erred under our precedent by not \nexplaining the need for a universal injunction. See Trump, 897 F.3d at 1244–45. \n \n1  The TPS program also applies to noncitizens without nationality if they “last habitually resided” in the designated \n  state. 8 U.S.C. § 1254a(a)(1). \n \n2  Secretary John Kelly served as the administration’s first Secretary for DHS, but the four TPS terminations decisions \n  were made by Acting Secretary Elaine Duke and Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. For the sake of clarity, I refer to a \nsingular Secretary except where relevant. \n \n3  Plaintiffs seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that they are “likely to succeed on the merits, that [they \n  are] likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in [their] \nfavor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.” Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, 20, 129 S.Ct. 365, \n172 L.Ed.2d 249 (2008). \n36 \n \n\nRamos v. Wolf, 975 F.3d 872 (2020)   \n \n \n4  The statutory provision in Catholic Social Services read, “There shall be no administrative or judicial review of a \n  determination respecting an application for adjustment of status under this section except in accordance with this \nsubsection.” 8 U.S.C. § 1255a(f)(1) (emphasis added). \n \n5  The parties agree that TPS designations are made by the Secretary of Homeland Security, and that the Secretary’s \n  discretion is not unfettered. The statute requires the Secretary to consult “with appropriate agencies of the \nGovernment.” See 8 U.S.C. 1254a(b)(1). The Secretary receives a Country Conditions Memo and Decision Memo \nfrom at least two different divisions within United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The Decision \nMemo contains a recommendation to grant, extend, or terminate a TPS designation. The State Department also \nprovides input, including country conditions and recommendations, and the statute allows the Secretary to receive \ninput from other governmental sources. \n \n6  Citing H.R. Rep. No. 100-627, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. at 4, 6 (1988); 136 Cong. Rec. (House) 8686–8687. \n \n \n7  Indeed, despite Secretary Kelly’s testimony that he did not have the discretion to consider intervening events, it is \n  uncontested that he considered them when he extended Haiti’s designation in 2017. 82 Fed. Reg. 23,830, 23,832. As \nthe district court recognized, DHS later adopted a very different interpretation of the statute. \n \n8  Even though TPS designations are temporary, the district court found that the risk of harm faced by plaintiffs is not \n  entirely  attributable  to  the  temporary  nature  of  the  program.  According  to  the  complaint,  plaintiffs  are \nhomeowners, mortgage-holders, employers and entrepreneurs. They are engaged in careers, faith communities, \nlabor unions, and educational institutions. See Regents, 140 S. Ct. at 1913–14 (noting that “DACA recipients have \nenrolled in degree programs, embarked on careers, started businesses, purchased homes, and even married and \nhad children, all in reliance on the DACA program,” and observing that there is no “legal authority establishing that” \nthe temporary nature of DACA “automatically preclude[s] reliance interests” (internal quotation marks omitted)). At \nthe very least, if DHS is required to comply with the APA’s procedural requirements, plaintiffs will have additional \ntime to sell their homes and businesses—hopefully avoiding fire sale prices—make difficult decisions regarding the \ncare of their children, and prepare to return to their home countries in an orderly fashion. \n \n9  The district court created this chart for its order denying the government’s motion to dismiss, and later incorporated \n  the table by reference into its order granting plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction. \n \n10  The government also argues on appeal that the Secretary’s interpretation of her statutory authority follows from a \n  natural reading of the TPS statute. But we may only review the explanation an agency gave contemporaneously, and \nhere it is undisputed that DHS denied that it changed its practice, and certainly gave no explanation for the change. \nSee, e.g., Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, ––– U.S. ––––, 136 S. Ct. 2117, 2127, 195 L.Ed.2d 382 (2016) (holding \nthat although an agency may justify its policy change by explaining that the policy is more consistent with the \nstatutory language, the agency must provide that explanation at the time of the action). Notably, the government’s \nposition on appeal is in significant tension with the majority’s view that the statute grants the Secretary unfettered \n37 \n \n\nRamos v. Wolf, 975 F.3d 872 (2020)   \n \ndiscretion to consider or not consider intervening events. \n \n11  At the time, Cissna had been nominated by the President to serve as Director of USCIS. He was confirmed as \n  Director in October 2017. \n \n12  The concurrence also shares concerns about nationwide injunctions, though this issue was raised by the government \n  for the first time on appeal. I agree this is an unsettled and difficult area of the law; but here, it is not even clear the \ndistrict court entered a nationwide injunction. The district court was only asked to consider four discrete country \ndesignations. The TPS statute makes individual determinations dependent upon country designations. In this way, \nthe district court’s preliminary injunction is readily distinguishable from cases in which courts have enjoined \nnationwide application of other immigration provisions and policies. See, e.g., Saget v. Trump, 375 F. Supp. 3d 280, \n379 (E.D.N.Y. 2019) (observing Secretary Duke’s termination of Haiti’s TPS designation “concerns a single decision on \na nationwide policy,” not case-by-case enforcement, and the government does not argue how the TPS terminations \ncould apply to some beneficiaries and not to others). Questions regarding the intended scope of the injunction \nshould be first addressed by the district court. \n \n13  The district court’s order denying the government’s motion to dismiss included the painful observation that \n  “President Trump did not merely call Haiti and El Salvador ‘shithole countries.’ He asked ‘Why are we having all \nthese people from shithole countries come here?’ and ‘Why do we need more Haitians?’ These are not merely \ncomments about a place, but can reasonably be understood as comments about the people who come from those \nplaces and their intrinsic worth.” \nThe same is true of the President’s statements that 15,000 Haitian immigrants “all have AIDS,” and his statements \ncharacterizing immigrants from Mexico and Central America as criminals and snakes. \n \n \n \n \nEnd of Document   \n \n \n \n \n38 \n ",

Plaintiffs in this case are U.S. citizen children, their non-citizen parents, and other \n3 non-citizen adults who are in the United States legally, and who have lived in this country \n4 lawfully for years, in some cases decades.  They challenge the Department of Homeland \n5 Security’s (“DHS”) new rule for deciding whether to terminate Temporary Protected Status \n6 (“TPS”) designations for countries facing armed conflict, natural disasters, or other crises that \n7 make the return of people from those countries untenable.  Since President Donald J. Trump took \n8 office in January 2017, the Administration has announced four such terminations, each one for a \n9 country in Latin America, the Caribbean, or Africa. \n10 2.  As a result of the Department of Homeland Security’s unlawful actions, over \n11 200,000 individuals who hold TPS face the imminent loss of their right to live and work lawfully \n12 in this country.  Many of them have lived in this country for over twenty years.  In addition, over \n13 200,000 U.S. citizen children, each of them with a parent or parents who are TPS holders, face an \n14 impossible choice between leaving the only home they have ever known, and growing up without \n15 one or both parents. \n16 3.  TPS is a form of humanitarian immigration relief that allows individuals from \n17 designated countries to live and work lawfully in the United States when they cannot return safely \n18 to their country of origin due to armed conflict, natural disaster or other “extraordinary \n19 circumstances.”  See 8 U.S.C. § 1254a.  Congress created TPS to establish formal criteria and \n20 procedures to replace more ad hoc practices the Executive Branch had used for decades to provide \n21 similar relief.  Although some countries are designated for TPS only for short periods, others have \n22 been designated for many years, including El Salvador (designated since 2001), Nicaragua \n23 (designated since 1999), Sudan (designated since 1997), and Haiti (designated since 2010). \n24 4.  Under previous administrations, DHS regularly considered natural disasters and \n25 social or economic crises that occurred after a country was originally designated for TPS in \n26 deciding whether to continue or instead terminate a country’s designation.  But after President \n27 Trump took office, DHS—without any formal announcement or other explanation—adopted a \n28\n1 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/12/18   Page 5 of 39\n \n1 new, novel interpretation of the TPS statute that eschews consideration of any intervening country \n2 conditions. \n3 5.  The Administration’s new legal rule has dramatically altered the lives of many \n4 Americans.  More than 270,000 U.S. citizen children have at least one parent with TPS.  Many of \n5 them are still in school.  This country is their home in every legal and practical sense of that word.  \n6 Yet their parents will shortly lose the right to continue living and working lawfully in this country. \n7 6.  Currently, more than 400,000 individuals from ten different countries have TPS.  \n8 Whether or not they have children, many TPS holders came to this country at a young age and \n9 have lived here for most of their lives.  They have homes, spouses, jobs, and other profound social \n10 ties to their communities that now entwine their lives with this country. \n11 7.  Since President Trump took office, DHS has applied its new rule for making TPS \n12 determinations to terminate the TPS designations of El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Sudan.  \n13 Through this lawsuit, Plaintiffs challenge the legality of that change on several bases. \n14 8.  First, Defendants’ new rule violates the constitutional rights of school-age United \n15 States citizen children of TPS holders, by presenting them with an impossible choice: they must \n16 either leave their country or live without their parents.  It is well established that a U.S. citizen has \n17 an absolute right to reside in this country.  It is equally well established that families have a \n18 fundamental right to live together without unwarranted government interference.  The Secretary \n19 has not even considered the impact on U.S. citizen children of TPS holders, let alone advanced a \n20 valid reason for compelling them to make the impossible choice of forgoing one of these rights for \n21 the other. \n22 9.  Second, Defendants’ new rule violates the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause \n23 in two related respects.  The rule violates the Equal Protection guarantee of the Due Process \n24 Clause because it was motivated by intentional race- and national-origin-based animus against \n25 individuals from what President Trump has referred to as “shithole countries.”  It arises from the \n26 Trump Administration’s repeatedly-expressed racism toward non-white, non-European people \n27 from other countries. \n28\n2 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/12/18   Page 6 of 39\n \n1 10.  The new rule also violates the due process protection against arbitrary government \n2 invasion of personal liberty.  The new rule constitutes an arbitrary, unexplained abandonment of \n3 the government’s longstanding interpretation of the TPS statute, on which several hundred \n4 thousand people have come to rely.  The Due Process Clause does not permit the government to \n5 engage in such arbitrary action when individual liberty interests are at stake. \n6 11.  Finally, Defendants’ sudden and unexplained departure from decades of consistent \n7 interpretation and corresponding practice violates the Administrative Procedure Act.  This sub \n8 silentio departure from existing practice, with complete disregard for the reliance interests that \n9 years of peaceful residence in this country had engendered, failed to meet the minimum standards \n10 of considered judgment that the APA requires. \n11 JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n12 12.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because this action arises under \n13 the Constitution and laws of the United States.  This Court has additional remedial authority under \n14 the Declaratory Judgment Act, see 28 U.S.C. § 2201 et seq., and the Administrative Procedure \n15 Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701–706. \n16 13.  The federal government has waived its sovereign immunity and permitted judicial \n17 review of agency action under 5 U.S.C. § 702.  See Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) v. United States, \n18 870 F.2d 518, 525 (9th Cir. 1989).  Sovereign immunity does not bar claims against federal \n19 officials seeking solely to prevent future violations of federal law (rather than monetary relief).  \n20 See, e.g., Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 697–99 & nn.18–19 \n21 (1949); Shields v. Utah Idaho Cent. R.R. Co., 305 U.S. 177, 183–84 (1938). \n22 14.  Venue is proper in the Northern District of California under 28 U.S.C.§ 1391(e)(1) \n23 because at least one plaintiff resides in this judicial district and each defendant is an agency of the \n24 United States or an officer of the United States sued in his or her official capacity. \n25 INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT \n26 15.  For purposes of Civil Local Rule 3-2(d) and 3-5(b), a majority of the claims of the \n27 named plaintiffs arise in Alameda, Contra Costa, and Marin Counties and, thus, this case should \n28 be assigned to the San Francisco division. \n3 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/12/18   Page 7 of 39\n \n1 THE PARTIES \n2 Plaintiffs \n3 16.

Defendant Kirstjen Nielsen, sued in her official capacity, is currently the Secretary \n7 of Homeland Security.  Defendant Nielsen assumed office on or around December 6, 2017.  As \n8 the highest-ranking officer for DHS, Defendant Nielsen is responsible for, among other things, \n9 “establishing national immigration enforcement policies and priorities.”  6 U.S.C. § 202(5).  On or \n10 about January 18, 2018, Defendant Nielsen terminated the designation of TPS for El Salvador. \n11 31.  Defendant Elaine C. Duke, sued in her official capacity, is currently the Deputy \n12 Secretary of Homeland Security, and served as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security from \n13 around July 31, 2017 to December 6, 2017 or thereabout.  As the chief operating officer for DHS, \n14 Defendant Duke is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the immigration laws of \n15 the United States.  On or about January 18, 2018, Defendant Duke terminated the designation of \n16 TPS for Haiti; on or about December 15, 2017, Defendant Duke terminated the designation of \n17 TPS for Nicaragua; and, on or about October 11, 2017, Defendant Duke terminated the \n18 designation of TPS for Sudan. \n19 32.  Defendant U.S. Department of Homeland Security is a cabinet-level department of \n20 the Executive Branch of the federal government, and is an “agency” within the meaning of 5 \n21 U.S.C. § 551(1).  DHS includes various component agencies, like the U.S. Citizenship and \n22 Immigration Services (“USCIS”), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”), and U.S. \n23 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”).  DHS, together with all of its component \n24 agencies, is responsible for administering and enforcing the nation’s immigration laws and \n25 policies, including the TPS program. \n26 33.  Defendant United States of America includes all government agencies and \n27 departments responsible for the implementation, administration, and change in policy concerning \n28 the TPS program. \n6 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/12/18   Page 10 of 39\n \n1 STATUTORY FRAMEWORK \n2 34.  Congress established the Temporary Protected Status (“TPS”) program through the \n3 Immigration Act of 1990.1  TPS is a form of humanitarian relief, providing lawful immigration \n4 status to eligible foreign nationals who cannot safely return home to war-torn or disaster-stricken \n5 countries.  By enacting the TPS statute, which is codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1254a, Congress \n6 established formal criteria for relief and set forth predictable procedures.2 \n7 35.  Under the TPS statute, the Secretary of Homeland Security3 makes a “designation” \n8 determination for a given country.  After consulting with “appropriate” government agencies, the \n9 Secretary may designate a foreign state, or any part of that state, for TPS based on: (A) an \n10 “ongoing armed conflict within the state” that would “pose a serious threat” to the “personal \n11 safety” of the foreign nationals of that state; (B) an “earthquake, flood, drought, epidemic, or other \n12 environmental disaster in the state resulting in a substantial, but temporary, disruption of living \n13 conditions,” which makes the foreign state “unable, temporarily, to handle adequately the return to \n14 the state” of its nationals, and where the foreign state has “officially” requested a designation; or \n15 (C) the existence of “extraordinary and temporary conditions in the foreign state” that prevent \n16 foreign nationals from safely returning, and where the temporary presence of those foreign \n17 nationals in the United States is not “contrary to the national interest of the United States.”4 \n18 36.  An initial designation period for a given country lasts between six and eighteen \n19 months.5  Before the designation can become effective, the Secretary must publish a notice in the \n20                                                  \n1 Pub. L. No. 101-649, § 302, 104 Stat. 4978, 5030–36. \n21\n2 The Executive Branch previously used ad hoc enforcement mechanisms to allow individuals to \n22 remain in the United States for humanitarian reasons.  See Adam B. Cox & Cristina Rodríguez, \nThe President and Immigration Law, 119 Yale L.J. 458, 501–02 (2009) (discussing use of the \n23 “parole power,” which is currently codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)).  Presidents have \noccasionally exercised their discretion to designate countries for “Extended Voluntary Departure” \n24 and “Deferred Enforced Departure.”  Somewhat like TPS, both of those delayed-departure \npractices allowed foreign nationals to lawfully remain and work in the United States while \n25 conditions in their homeland were unsafe or return was impracticable. \n3 References to the Attorney General in provisions describing functions transferred from the \n26\nDepartment of Justice to the Department of Homeland Security “shall be deemed to refer to the \nSecretary” of Homeland Security.  See 6 U.S.C. § 557. \n27\n4 8 U.S.C. § 1254a(b)(1). \n28 5 8 U.S.C. § 1254a(b)(2), (b)(3)(C). \n7 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/12/18   Page 11 of 39\n \n1 Federal Register that includes, among other things, a statement of findings, the effective date of \n2 the designation, and a tally of eligible foreign nationals. \n3 37.  Once the Secretary has designated a particular country for TPS, individuals from \n4 that country (or persons without nationality who last habitually resided in that country) may apply \n5 for immigration status under the program.  To be eligible for TPS, however, individuals from a \n6 designated country must meet stringent requirements.  These requirements include, among other \n7 things, continued physical presence and continued residence in the United States from the most \n8 recent date of designation; satisfaction of the criteria for admissibility as an immigrant; lack of \n9 disqualifying criminal history; and submission of an application, extensive documentation, and \n10 fees.6 \n11 38.  Congress ensured that individuals who are ultimately granted protected status could \n12 enjoy the freedom to live and work in the United States without fear of deportation.  Under the \n13 statute, as enacted by Congress, an individual who receives and maintains TPS shall be authorized \n14 to engage in employment in the United States; shall not be detained by the Secretary of Homeland \n15 Security on the basis of immigration status; and shall not be removed from the United States by \n16 the Department of Homeland Security.7 \n17 39.  Under the TPS statute, the Secretary must periodically re-evaluate country \n18 designations.  At least 60 days before a particular designation expires, the Secretary must “review \n19 the conditions in the foreign state . . . for which a designation is in effect” and determine whether \n20 the country still meets the conditions for TPS.8  If the Secretary does not terminate TPS for a \n21 particular country, then—by default—the designation will be extended for a period of six months, \n22 or by discretion of the Secretary, for a period of twelve or eighteen months.9  This periodic-review \n23\n24\n                                                 \n25\n6 8 U.S.C. § 1254a(c)(1); 8 C.F.R. §§ 244.2, 244.4, 244.9. \n26 7 8 U.S.C. § 1254a(a)(1), (d)(4). \n8 8 U.S.C. § 1254a(b)(3). \n27\n9 8 U.S.C. § 1254a(b)(3)(C). \n28\n8 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/12/18   Page 12 of 39\n \n1 requirement also entails consultation with appropriate government agencies and, ultimately, \n2 publication of notice in the Federal Register. \n3 40.  When a designation for a particular country is terminated, the individual TPS \n4 holder’s status will typically revert back to his or her original immigration status.10 \n5 DEPORTATION OF TPS HOLDERS WILL IMPOSE \n6 EXTRAORDINARY HARM ON THEIR MINOR U.S. CITIZEN  \n7 CHILDREN, AS WELL AS ON THE  \n8 TPS HOLDERS THEMSELVES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. \n9 41.  Under the Fourteenth Amendment, children born in the United States, including \n10 those of TPS holders, are U.S. citizens with an absolute right to remain in the United States. \n11 42.   As with any child, their well-being and future development are tied to nurturing and \n12 stable relationships with their parents.11  Science confirms this common sense understanding.  The \n13 most important factor in the development of brain architecture—the trillions of connections \n14 among and across neurons in a child’s brain—is the interactive and responsive relationship \n15 between child and parent.12  The parent-child relationship promotes healthy brain development \n16 and provides the buffering protection necessary to prevent children from experiencing toxic \n17 responses to stress.13 \n18 43.  Children of immigrants acutely suffer when their parents face even the possibility of \n19 deportation.  The fear of deportation is directly tied to the prevalence of stress-related illness in \n20 children, including higher levels of anxiety and trauma, depression, and family instability.  The \n21 “fear of massive deportations”14 also diminishes the quality of day-to-day relationships between \n22 parents and their children, including because the threat of deportation deters parents from taking \n                                                 \n23\n10 8 C.F.R. § 244.19. \n24\n11 Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University, Three Principles to Improve Outcomes \nfor Children and Families 3–4 (2017), http://www.developingchild.harvard.edu. \n25\n12 Id. \n26\n13 Id. \n27 14 M.

The scale of the harm wrought by Defendants’ new TPS policies and practices is \n4 massive.  TPS holders are the parents of more than 270,000 U.S. citizen children,15 including \n5 approximately 192,700 U.S. citizen children with parents who are Salvadoran TPS holders, and \n6 27,000 U.S. citizen children with parents who are Haitian TPS holders.16 \n7 45.  All told, approximately 400,000 TPS holders currently reside in the United States.17  \n8 They live in all fifty states, as well as the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories.  At least ten \n9 states are home to more than 10,000 TPS holders each. \n10 46.  Many TPS holders have resided in the United States for many years.  Over half of \n11 Salvadoran TPS holders, and about sixteen percent of Haitian TPS holders, have lived and worked \n12 in the United States for more than two decades.18  Many TPS holders also arrived in the U.S. at a \n13 young age.19  Roughly twenty percent of TPS holders from El Salvador, and thirty percent from \n14 Haiti, arrived before they turned sixteen years old. \n15 47.  TPS holders are part of the economic and social fabric of American communities, \n16 and give back to this country in many ways.  They are active in civic life and volunteer at schools, \n17 neighborhood and work organizations, and religious institutions.20  They pay federal, state, and \n18 local taxes, and support government social welfare programs.  Experts estimate that, without \n19\n20\n21                                                  \n15 Robert Warren & Donald Kerwin, A Statistical and Demographic Profile of the US Temporary \n22\nProtected Status Population from El Salvador, Honduras, and Haiti, 5 J. on Migration & Hum. \nSec. 577, 578 (Aug. 2017) \n23\n16 Id. at 581. \n24\n17 Id. at 578; see also Jill H.

The net positive economic contributions of TPS holders is not surprising in light of \n4 their consistently high employment rate: Eighty-eight percent of Salvadoran TPS holders and \n5 eighty-one percent of Haitian TPS holders are employed.  About eleven percent are entrepreneurs, \n6 creating jobs for themselves and their communities.23  About thirty percent of households where \n7 TPS holders reside have mortgages, including 45,500 households with Salvadoran TPS holders \n8 and 6,200 households with Haitian TPS holders.24  More than half of TPS recipients from El \n9 Salvador (fifty-six percent) and Haiti (fifty-seven percent) have health insurance.25 \n10 49.

The U.S. citizen children of TPS holders, including the plaintiff children in this case, \n9 confront an impossible choice.  On one hand, they can continue to live with their parents, but only \n10 by relocating to a foreign country, leaving behind their schools, their communities, and the \n11 benefits of living in the U.S.—the only country they have ever known.  On the other hand, they \n12 can choose to remain in the U.S., but then must give up living with one or both parents, which in \n13 many cases would involve their becoming a ward of the state subject to foster care, or otherwise \n14 subject to the supervision of persons who are not their parents. \n15 51.  Plaintiff Crista Ramos, fourteen years old, is the eldest child of TPS holder Plaintiff \n16 Cristina Morales.  Crista was born in Marin, California, and is now an eighth grade student at \n17 Saint Raphael School.  She is currently applying to high school and dreams of being an \n18 immigration lawyer.  She lives with her mother, father, and her eleven-year-old brother Diego in \n19 San Pablo, California.  Crista worries about what will happen if her mother loses her TPS status \n20 and is deported because she depends on her.  She has never lived in or traveled to El Salvador. \n21 52.  Plaintiff Benjamin Zepeda, fourteen years old, is the eldest child of TPS holder \n22 Plaintiff Orlando Zepeda and TPS holder Lorena Arana.  Benjamin was born and raised in Los \n23 Angeles, California, and currently is a ninth grade student at St. John Bosco High School.

He and his sister depend on their parents for emotional, \n2 psychological, educational, spiritual, and material support.  He has never visited El Salvador and \n3 cannot imagine moving there.  He also struggles to consider how much his life would be upended \n4 if his parents lost their TPS status and did not have documentation in the United States, moved to \n5 El Salvador, or were deported there. \n6 53.  Plaintiff Juan Eduardo Ayala Flores, thirteen years old, is the youngest son of TPS \n7 holder Plaintiff Elsy Yolanda Flores de Ayala and TPS holder Juan Amilcar Ayala Rovira.  He has \n8 two older sisters, TPS holder Plaintiff Maria Jose Ayala Flores, nineteen years old, who is a \n9 college student, and Joanna Gabriela Ayala Flores, seventeen years old, who was born in \n10 Washington, D.C.  Juan is a seventh grade student at Washington Latin Public Charter School.  \n11 Juan’s parents are from El Salvador, but he has only been to El Salvador once, in 2009, for about \n12 one month to visit his grandmother.  He was born in Washington, D.C., and has lived there his \n13 entire life. \n14 54.  Plaintiff Hnaida Cenemat, fourteen years old, is the eldest child of TPS holder \n15 Plaintiff Wilna Destin, who was raised in Haiti and has lived in the United States for eighteen \n16 years.  Hnaida’s younger brother, John, is ten years old.  Hnaida was born in Orlando, Florida, and \n17 has lived there her entire life.  She visited Haiti only once for a brief period when she was one \n18 year old.  Hnaida is a motivated high school freshman at Dr. Phillips High School.  She is \n19 consistently on the honor roll and very active in her school and church.  Her favorite subjects in \n20 school are math and science, and she aspires to become an obstetrician/gynecologist because she \n21 wants to help people.  She plans to join the Student Council next year, and wants to be on the \n22 cheerleading and flag football teams.  Outside of school, she is in her church choir.  Prior to \n23 Defendants’ decision to end TPS, Hnaida did not understand that it was a legal status that could be \n24 terminated.  She is afraid of moving to Haiti with her mother and living in a country that she does \n25 not know, but she is also afraid of remaining in the United States with a foster family.  She, her \n26 brother, and their parents have spent a lot of time speaking about TPS. \n27 55.  Plaintiff Rilya Salary, five years old, was born in Rockledge, Florida and is the \n28 eldest child of TPS holder Plaintiff Sherika Blanc and Jermaine Salary, who is a U.S. citizen.  She \n13 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/12/18   Page 17 of 39\n \n1 has two younger sisters: Alaya, who is three years old, and Amara, who is less than one year old.  \n2 Rilya is in kindergarten at Kingswood Elementary School.  Rilya has never been to Haiti. \n3 TPS HOLDERS FACE IRREPARABLE HARM FROM BEING  \n4 FORCED TO RETURN TO COUNTRIES THEY FLED DECADES AGO. \n5 56.  TPS holders have built lives in the U.S. over the course of decades, building families \n6 and contributing to their communities.  The circumstances of the plaintiffs here who hold TPS \n7 illustrate the irreparable harm that inevitably will occur if they (and other TPS holders) are \n8 deported. \n9 57.  Plaintiff Cristina Morales, thirty-seven years old, was born in San Miguel, El \n10 Salvador.  She came to the United States from El Salvador at the age of twelve as an \n11 unaccompanied minor.  Her mother had escaped domestic violence and fled to the United States \n12 before her, and Cristina followed.  Cristina currently does not have family in El Salvador with \n13 whom she is in contact.  Cristina’s mother advised her to apply for TPS soon after she graduated \n14 from high school, immediately after El Salvador was designated for TPS.  Cristina has now lived \n15 in the United States for twenty-six years and had TPS for seventeen years.  Cristina and her \n16 husband met when she was in high school, and they have been married since 2008.  They have \n17 two children, fourteen-year-old Crista, and eleven-year-old Diego.  Cristina and her family live in \n18 San Pablo, California in a home they have owned since 2008.  She is currently the director of the \n19 extended care program at the Saint Raphael School, a private Catholic school in Marin County.  \n20 Cristina struggled to complete the applications for her daughter’s high school because of the stress \n21 she feels due to the looming expiration of TPS for El Salvador.  She is afraid that her family will \n22 be divided again, and that she will be forced to return to El Salvador where she has no family and \n23 which she fled as a child. \n24 58.  Plaintiff Orlando Zepeda, fifty-one years old, came to the United States from his \n25 birth country of El Salvador in 1984, at the age of eighteen years old.  He has lived in two homes \n26 in Los Angeles, California during the thirty-four years he has lived in the United States.  About \n27 fifteen years ago, he and his wife, TPS holder Lorena Arana, bought the home in which they now \n28 live with their two U.S. citizen children who are twelve and fourteen years old.  Orlando was \n14 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/12/18   Page 18 of 39\n \n1 granted TPS in 2001, when El Salvador was designated.  Orlando has worked for the past eight \n2 years providing building maintenance, including with the same company for the last four years.  \n3 He has also volunteered as a chaplain in prisons and hospitals for nearly twenty years.  His family \n4 and life are in the United States, and his children and brother are U.S. citizens.  He has lived in the \n5 United States for nearly twice as long as he lived in El Salvador.  He left El Salvador in the middle \n6 of the country’s violent armed conflict and fears he would not even recognize the country now.   \n7 59.  Plaintiff Maria Jose Ayala Flores, nineteen years old, is the oldest daughter of TPS \n8 holder Plaintiff Elsy Yolanda Flores de Ayala and TPS holder Juan Amilcar Ayala Rovira.  She \n9 arrived in the United States when she was one year old, and has had TPS since she was about two \n10 years old.  She discovered she had TPS only when it came time to apply for college, when she \n11 realized that her immigration status made her ineligible for many available college scholarships.  \n12 Since she arrived in the United States, she has only been to El Salvador once, in 2009 for \n13 approximately one month to visit her grandmother.  She graduated from high school in 2016 and \n14 is currently a sophomore at Montgomery College in Maryland studying mathematics.  She plans to \n15 teach math to elementary school students.  She has two younger siblings, Joanna Gabriela and \n16 Plaintiff Juan Eduardo. \n17 60.  Plaintiff Elsy Yolanda Flores de Ayala, thirty-eight years old, was born in San \n18 Miguel, El Salvador on May 15, 1979.  Her mother, father, and siblings fled El Salvador during \n19 the country’s brutal civil war in the 1980s, and are now all either U.S. citizens or lawful \n20 permanent residents in the United States.  As she was the youngest and unable to travel safely, she \n21 remained in El Salvador during the war.  Elsy married Juan Amilcar Ayala Rovira in 2000 in El \n22 Salvador.  They traveled to the United States in March 2000 with their daughter, Plaintiff Maria \n23 Jose Ayala Flores, who was one year old at the time.  One year later, following the earthquakes in \n24 El Salvador and El Salvador’s TPS designation, Elsy, her husband, and their daughter obtained \n25 TPS.  She now has three children.  In addition to Maria Jose, Elsy and Juan are parents to Joanna \n26 Gabriela Ayala Flores, seventeen years old, and Plaintiff Juan Eduardo Ayala Flores, thirteen \n27 years old.  Joanna and Juan were both born and raised in the United States.  Elsy has worked as a \n28 domestic worker and child-care provider since 2004.  She currently provides child care for two \n15 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/12/18   Page 19 of 39\n \n1 families.  Since 2000, Elsy and her family have lived in Washington D.C.  She has only been to El \n2 Salvador once since she arrived, in 2009 to visit her mother-in-law.  Elsy cannot imagine being \n3 forced to return to El Salvador, where she has no family, and being separated from her family in \n4 the United States, including possibly her two youngest children. \n5 61.  Plaintiff Wilna Destin, forty-three years old, was raised in Thomassique, a small \n6 township in central Haiti.  She fled Haiti in 2000 to seek a better life in the United States after \n7 experiencing threats of violence in her hometown.  She received TPS in 2010, following the \n8 earthquake in Haiti, and has had TPS since then.  Her father is a U.S. lawful permanent resident.  \n9 She also has two brothers in the United States.  One is a U.S. citizen and the other has TPS.  She is \n10 married to a TPS holder and is the mother of two children, Plaintiff Hnaida, fourteen years old; \n11 and John Walker, ten years old.  Since 2014, she has been a labor organizer with the union \n12 UNITE-HERE.  She previously worked at Disney World.  Wilna has lived in Florida for eighteen \n13 years.  For the last nine years she has owned a home in Orlando, which she shares with her family.  \n14 She is an active member of her community and church, and volunteered to travel to New Orleans \n15 after Hurricane Katrina to support the humanitarian relief efforts and help with the cleanup. \n16 62.  Plaintiff Sherika Blanc, twenty-seven years old, was born in Port de Paix, Haiti, and \n17 immigrated to the United States with her parents and two brothers when she was eight years old.  \n18 Sherika discovered that she was (then) undocumented only when she graduated from high school \n19 in 2009 and realized that she could not apply for financial aid to go to college because of her \n20 immigration status.  In 2010, soon after she graduated from high school, Haiti was designated for \n21 TPS.  Sherika applied shortly thereafter, and has had either TPS or DACA since 2010.  Her TPS \n22 status has changed her life by giving her the opportunity to work, buy a car, rent a house, and raise \n23 a family.  Her parents and her two brothers have all had TPS since 2010.  Because she could not \n24 go to university when she graduated from high school, Sherika trained successfully to become a \n25 certified nursing assistant (“CAN”) and a healthy unity coordinator (“HUC”), and received her \n26 license in 2011.  Since 2015, she has worked as a nursing assistant and HUC at the South Florida \n27 Baptist Hospital, in Plant City, Florida.

Plaintiff Imara Ampie, forty-five years old, was born and raised in Managua, \n4 Nicaragua.  In August 1998, at the age of twenty-six years old, Imara traveled to the United States \n5 to procure material for her mother’s tailoring business.  While she was in the United States, \n6 Nicaragua was devastated by Hurricane Mitch and the U.S. government designated Nicaragua for \n7 TPS.  She married a Nicaraguan TPS holder, and they are raising two young sons.  Imara is a \n8 homemaker and cares for their children.  Imara has lived in the Bay Area for twenty years.  She \n9 and her family have owned a home in Contra Costa County in northern California since 2008.  She \n10 is concerned that if TPS for Nicaragua is terminated, she and her husband may be forced to return \n11 to Nicaragua even though their lives and family are here, and there will be inadequate options to \n12 satisfy the health care and educational needs for her family.  Her children would suffer if forced to \n13 relocate to Nicaragua, but would also face tremendous obstacles if forced to remain in the United \n14 States without their parents. \n15 64.  Plaintiff Mazin Ahmed, nineteen years old, came to the United States with his \n16 mother and two younger siblings in 2012, and all have had TPS since 2013.  Mazin is Sudanese \n17 and was born in Sudan, but lived in Qatar with his parents and siblings from 1997 until 2012.  He \n18 was a baby when he and his family moved from Sudan to Qatar, and left Qatar for the United \n19 States with his mother and siblings when he was fourteen years old.  Mazin arrived in the United \n20 States in time to start high school, and graduated with honors from Westbrook High School, in \n21 Westbrook, Maine where he has lived since he arrived.  He is currently a sophomore majoring in \n22 Human Biology at the University of Southern Maine, where he has been the recipient of a merit-\n23 based President’s Scholar Award.  He plans to study to be a pediatrician.  He does not believe that \n24 he could safely return to Sudan, has no right to return to Qatar, and has built a community and \n25 excelled in his studies in the United States. \n26 65.  Plaintiff Hiwaida Elarabi, fifty-five years old, is from Sudan but has lived in the \n27 United States since 1997 when she arrived with a visitor’s visa to visit her aunt and her family—\n28 all of whom are now U.S. citizens.  During the time that Hiwaida was in the United States, the \n17 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/12/18   Page 21 of 39\n \n1 security situation deteriorated in Sudan, which was in the midst of a decades-long conflict.  Before \n2 the expiration of her visitor’s visa, the U.S. government designated Sudan for TPS and Hiwaida \n3 remained because she could not safely return.  She has now lived in the United States for twenty \n4 years, with her aunt’s family.  She has a Bachelor’s degree in biochemistry from before she \n5 arrived in the United States, and a Master’s degree in Bioinformatics from Brandeis University.  \n6 She lives in Newton, Massachusetts and has worked for the last four years at Western Governors \n7 University as an E-Care Coordinator, providing technical support to students.  Prior to that, she \n8 worked for sixteen years as a Health Educator at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.  \n9 Hiwaida is also an entrepreneur who opened up a restaurant in 2015.  She took on extensive debt \n10 to do so, and suffered from the termination of TPS.  While the restaurant was doing well in its \n11 early years, she made the difficult decision to sell it, at great cost, after Defendants terminated \n12 TPS.  She felt that her future was uncertain and she did not know whether she would be able to \n13 sustain the restaurant. \n14 MOTIVATED BY RACIAL ANIMUS, THE TRUMP  \n15 ADMINISTRATION CHANGED THE RULES GOVERNING TPS. \n16 66.  The Secretary’s adoption of a new rule for making TPS determinations was \n17 motivated in significant part by racial and national-origin animus.  This animus is evidenced by \n18 numerous statements made by President Donald J. Trump and other officials in his administration.  \n19 A limited number of those statements are described herein, and they leave no doubt as to the \n20 speaker’s racially discriminatory motives against non-white and non-European immigrants.  In \n21 particular, President Trump referred to countries designated for TPS as “shithole” countries a mere \n22 seven days before Defendants terminated Haiti’s TPS status. \n23 67.  President Donald J. Trump, along with other officials in his administration, have \n24 repeatedly expressed racially-discriminatory and anti-immigrant sentiments.  On the first day of \n25 his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump categorically labeled Mexican immigrants as criminals and \n26 rapists: “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. . . . They’re sending people \n27\n28\n18 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/12/18   Page 22 of 39\n \n1 that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with [them].  They’re bringing \n2 drugs.  They’re bringing crime.  They’re rapists.  And some, I assume, are good people.”31 \n3 68.  Both during his campaign and after taking office, President Trump has repeatedly \n4 compared immigrants to snakes who will bite and kill anyone foolish enough to take them in.32  \n5 69.  President Trump has made numerous comparable racist, anti-immigrant \n6 pronouncements about Haitians, Africans, and Muslims.  For example, in or around June 2017, in \n7 a meeting with Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and then-Secretary of Homeland Security John \n8 F. Kelly, President Trump reportedly said of the 15,000 Haitians admitted to the United States, \n9 they “all have AIDS.”33  At this same meeting, the President, after learning that 40,000 people had \n10 entered the United States from Nigeria, reportedly stated that they would never “go back to their \n11 huts” in Africa.34  In November 2015, then-candidate Trump disseminated a debunked story about \n12 celebrations of the September 11, 2001, attacks, involving “thousands and thousands of people” in \n13 New Jersey where “you have large Arab populations.”35  President Trump’s many racist \n14 statements have been documented and catalogued.36 \n15 70.  President Trump has directed his racist remarks at the TPS program.  For example, \n16 on or about January 11, 2018, several lawmakers gathered with the President in the Oval Office of \n17 the White House to discuss a bipartisan immigration proposal.  President Trump grew frustrated \n18\n                                                 \n19\n31  Donald Trump Announces a Presidential Bid, Wash.

Senator Dick Durbin, who was present at the January 11, 2018, meeting in the Oval \n8 Office, characterized the President’s comments as “clearly racial,” “hate-filled,” and “vile.”40  \n9 Senator Durbin reportedly warned the President that exclusion of immigrants based on those \n10 grounds would be “an obvious racial decision.”41 \n11 72.  Secretary Nielsen, who also was present at the January 11, 2018, meeting in the \n12 Oval Office,42 has acknowledged that the President used “tough language.”43  Although she \n13 asserted that she did not know whether Norway was a “predominately white country,” she \n14 admitted that she “imagine[d] that is the case.”44 \n15 73.

According to reports, \n3 Chief of Staff Kelly was irritated and persistent, warning Acting Secretary Duke that the TPS \n4 program “prevents [the Trump Administration’s] wider strategic goal” on immigration.46 In \n5 response to this pressure, Acting Secretary Duke reportedly told Chief of Staff Kelly that she \n6 would resign her position.47 \n7 DHS’S TPS TERMINATIONS WERE BASED ON AN ARBITRARY \n8 INTERPRETATION OF THE TPS STATUTE, BREAKING WITH DECADES OF \n9 PRIOR PRACTICE WITHOUT EXPLANATION. \n10 74.  Over the past fourteen months, DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Acting \n11 Secretary Elaine Duke announced the termination of TPS for El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and \n12 Sudan. \n13 75.  To justify those decisions, DHS has adopted a novel interpretation of the TPS \n14 statute.  Under prior administrations, DHS or its predecessors considered intervening natural \n15 disasters, conflicts, and other serious social and economic problems as relevant factors when \n16 deciding whether to continue or instead terminate a TPS designation.  Although no relevant statute \n17 or regulation has changed in the intervening decades, the Trump administration’s DHS has now \n18 taken the position that such factors cannot be considered. \n19 76.  The Administration adopted the new interpretation without a formal announcement \n20 to disclose its rationale for making a dramatic change to a decades-old policy.  Instead, the change \n21 became public during testimony by then-Secretary Kelly at a Senate hearing on June 6, 2017.  \n22 Secretary Kelly stated “the program [TPS] is for a specific event.  In – in Haiti, it was the \n23\n                                                 \n24 45 Nick Miroff, White House Chief of Staff Tried to Pressure Acting DHS Secretary to Expel \nThousands of Hondurans, Officials Say, Wash.

Yes, Haiti had horrible conditions before the earthquake, and those conditions aren’t \n2 much better after the earthquake.  But the earthquake was why TPS was – was granted and – and \n3 that’s how I have to look at it.”48 \n4 77.  Current Secretary Nielsen has since reiterated the view that “[t]he law does not \n5 allow me to look at the country conditions of a country writ large.  It requires me to look very \n6 specifically as to whether the country conditions originating from the original designation \n7 continue to exist.”49 \n8 78.   The Administration has applied its new policy to its TPS decisions.  In at least three \n9 announcements terminating a TPS designation, the DHS Secretary explicitly stated that she \n10 compared “the conditions upon which the country’s original designation was based” with “an \n11 assessment of whether those originating conditions continue to exist.”50  Even where she did not \n12 refer to the new policy explicitly, the Secretary’s new interpretation of the TPS statute is evident \n13 in its TPS termination decisions for El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Sudan. \n14 79.  El Salvador was the first country designated for TPS, as part of the Immigration Act \n15 of 1990.51  Advocacy for Salvadorans denied fair asylum processes—while the United States was \n16 supporting one of the warring parties in the civil war in El Salvador—was one of the primary \n17 motivations for that decision.52 \n18\n                                                 \n19\n48 Hearing on the Department of Homeland Security F.Y. 2018 Budget Before the S.

El Salvador was most recently designated for TPS on March 9, 2001 after three \n2 devastating earthquakes.53  All told, various administrations continued TPS for El Salvador eleven \n3 times based on a variety of factors and conditions that did not exist at the time of the original \n4 designation, and that were unrelated to the earthquakes.54  Among other considerations, they cited \n5 droughts and a leaf rust epidemic that caused destabilizing food insecurity and malnutrition,55 \n6 health emergencies,56 subsequent environmental disasters, including another earthquake in 2012, \n7\n8\n9\n                                                 \n10\n53 A devastating, 7.6 magnitude earthquake hit El Salvador on January 13, 2001, followed by over \n3,000 aftershocks.

But when terminating TPS for Salvadorans in January 2018, Secretary Nielsen \n4 ignored the contemporary realities of life in El Salvador by asking only whether disruptions \n5 traceable to the 2001 earthquakes had abated.

Contrary to his predecessors, when Secretary Kelly continued Haiti’s TPS \n7 designation in May 2017, he did so for the minimum six months allowed by statute.  He \n8 simultaneously cautioned Haitian TPS recipients living in the United States to “make other \n9 necessary arrangements for their ultimate departure from the United States” despite concluding, \n10 after consultation with the Department of State, that “conditions in Haiti supporting its designation \n11 for TPS persist.”65 \n12 84.

Nevertheless, in September 2017, Acting Secretary Duke terminated Sudan’s TPS \n8 designation on the ground that “the ongoing armed conflict and extraordinary and temporary \n9 conditions that served as the basis for Sudan’s most recent designation have sufficiently improved \n10 such that they no longer prevent nationals of Sudan from returning in safety to all regions of \n11 Sudan.” 77  The Acting Secretary did not even consider, let alone make a finding as to numerous \n12 intervening factors considered by prior administrations in extending Sudan’s TPS designation. \n13 CLASS ALLEGATIONS \n14 89.

Minor Plaintiffs seek to represent the following nationwide class: The U.S. citizen \n4 children, from ages five to eighteen, of all TPS holders from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and \n5 Sudan. \n6 91.  The proposed class satisfies the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n7 23(a)(1) because it is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. \n8 92.  On information and belief, there are tens of thousands of U.S. citizen children of \n9 TPS holders from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Sudan.  Given the dates of TPS designations \n10 for those countries, thousands of those children are minors confronted with the possibility of \n11 losing either the ability to live in their country or the care and support of a TPS-holder parent. \n12 93.  Due to the actions of Defendants, the U.S. citizen children of TPS holders will be \n13 forced to choose between their absolute and fundamental due process right to reside in this \n14 country, and their due process right to the care and support of their parents. \n15 94.  The class meets the commonality requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n16 23(a)(2).  Members of the class are subject to a common practice or policy: Defendants’ adoption \n17 of a new rule that has caused the termination of the TPS designations for their parents’ respective \n18 countries without any consideration of the impact on the class members—i.e., these American \n19 children—or any valid reason justifying the harm that decision imposes on them.  If the TPS \n20 termination decisions take effect, these children will be forced by law to choose between their \n21 right to reside in this country as citizens, and their right to reside with their parents.  Whether the \n22 Due Process Clause permits the government to force these children into that choice presents a \n23 common legal question, resolution of which will greatly aid the efficient resolution of this case. \n24 95.  The proposed class meets the typicality requirements of Federal Rule of Civil \n25 Procedure 23(a)(3) because the claims of the representative Individual Minor Plaintiffs are typical \n26 of the claims of their class.  Minor Plaintiffs and the proposed Citizen-Children Class members are \n27 the school-aged children, from ages five to eighteen, who are U.S. citizens.  Their parents will be \n28 subject to removal once the TPS termination decisions take effect.  Individual Minor Plaintiffs and \n29 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/12/18   Page 33 of 39\n \n1 their proposed class also share the same legal claims, which challenge the legality of these \n2 termination policies and practices under the Fifth Amendment. \n3 96.  The proposed class meets the adequacy requirements of Federal Rule of Civil \n4 Procedure 23(a)(4).  Individual Minor Plaintiffs seek the same relief as the other members of the \n5 class.  In defending their own rights, Individual Plaintiffs will defend the rights of all proposed \n6 class members fairly and adequately. \n7 97.  Additionally, the proposed class is represented by pro bono counsel from the \n8 National Day Laborer Organizing Network (“NDLON”), the American Civil Liberties Union of \n9 Southern California, and Sidley Austin LLP.  Plaintiffs’ counsel have extensive experience \n10 litigating class action lawsuits and other complex cases in federal court, including civil rights \n11 lawsuits on behalf of non-citizens. \n12 98.  The members of the class are readily ascertainable through Defendants’ records. \n13 99.  Finally, the proposed class satisfies Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(1)(A) and \n14 (b)(2).  Competing rulings as to whether Defendants must permit the TPS-holding parents of \n15 minor U.S. citizen children to reside in the United States could create inconsistent adjudications \n16 and establish incompatible standards of conduct governing Defendants’ behavior.  In addition, \n17 Defendants have acted on grounds that are generally applicable to the class by terminating the \n18 TPS designations for El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Sudan without considering the massive \n19 harm that decision causes to U.S. citizen children or providing reasons to justify that harm.  Thus, \n20 final injunctive and declaratory relief is appropriate for the class as a whole. \n21 CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n22 FIRST CLAIM \n23 Violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment \n24 (Against All Defendants by All U.S. Citizen Children Plaintiffs) \n25 100.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained \n26 in the preceding paragraphs. \n27 101.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides \n28 that “[n]o person shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”  \n30 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/12/18   Page 34 of 39\n \n1 U.S. Const. amend. V.  The guarantee against the deprivation of liberty without due process bars \n2 the government from infringing on certain “fundamental” liberty interests, regardless of the \n3 procedures involved, unless the action is “narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.”  \n4 Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 301–02 (1993). \n5 102.  Three such fundamental rights are implicated here.  First, the plaintiffs here who are \n6 school-aged U.S. citizens have an absolute right to live in the United States.  To compel them to \n7 live abroad at any time, let alone in their formative years, would deny them a core aspect of their \n8 liberty protected by the Fifth Amendment.  See, e.g., Nguyen v. I.N.S., 533 U.S. 53, 67 (2001); Ng \n9 Fung Ho v. White, 259 U.S. 276, 284 (1922). \n10 103.  Second, for at least so long as these U.S. citizen plaintiffs remain minors, they have \n11 a fundamental right protected by both the First and Fifth Amendments to live with and be raised \n12 by their parents.  E.g., Moore v. City of East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 499 (1977); Board of Dirs. \n13 v. Rotary Club, 481 U.S. 537, 545 (1987). \n14 104.  Third, the government’s decision to end the lawful immigration status of their \n15 parents impinges upon the U.S. citizen plaintiffs’ constitutionally-protected liberty interests.  \n16 These American children have a powerful interest in not being compelled to choose between two \n17 alternatives when each alternative will deprive them of a substantial, constitutionally-protected \n18 aspect of liberty.  See United States v. Jackson, 390 U.S. 570 (1968); cf. New York v. United \n19 States, 505 U.S. 144, 176 (1992). \n20 105.  In invading these fundamental constitutional rights, Defendants have articulated no \n21 substantial governmental interest and have failed adequately to tailor their action to promote any \n22 legitimate interest they may have.  Nowhere in the notices terminating the TPS designations for El \n23 Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Sudan, for example, have Defendants identified any risk to the \n24 interests of the United States that would follow from allowing the school-aged U.S. citizen \n25 children to remain in the United States with their TPS holder parents until the children reach the \n26 age of majority. \n27 106.  Similarly, nowhere in the notices terminating the TPS designations for El Salvador, \n28 Haiti, Nicaragua, and Sudan has the Secretary adequately explained the Secretary’s new \n31 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/12/18   Page 35 of 39\n \n1 interpretation of the governing statute, reconciled it with the Secretary’s longstanding prior \n2 interpretation, or justified its extraordinary invasion of the U.S. citizen children’s constitutional \n3 rights. \n4 107.  Plaintiffs and Minor Plaintiffs’ class will suffer irreparable injury resulting from the \n5 termination of the TPS designations. \n6 SECOND CLAIM \n7 Violation of the Equal Protection Guarantee of the  \n8 Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment \n9 (Against All Defendants by All TPS-Holder Plaintiffs) \n10 108.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained \n11 in the preceding paragraphs. \n12 109.  The Fifth Amendment contains an implicit guarantee of equal protection that \n13 invalidates any official action that in part reflects a racially discriminatory intent or purpose.  \n14 Classifications based on race or national origin receive exacting scrutiny, and even facially neutral \n15 policies and practices will be held unconstitutional when they reflect a pattern unexplainable on \n16 grounds other than race.  Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499 (1954); Vill. of Arlington Heights v. \n17 Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265–66 (1977). \n18 110.  Defendants’ decisions to terminate the TPS designations for El Salvador, Haiti, \n19 Nicaragua, and Sudan are unconstitutional because they were motivated, at least in part, by \n20 intentional discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or national origin. \n21 111.  Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury resulting from the arbitrary termination of the \n22 TPS designations. \n23 THIRD CLAIM \n24 Violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment \n25 (Against All Defendants by All TPS-Holder Plaintiffs) \n26 112.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained \n27 in the preceding paragraphs. \n28\n32 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/12/18   Page 36 of 39\n \n1 113.  Due process protections extend to “all ‘persons’ within the United States, including \n2 [non-citizens], whether their presence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or permanent.”  \n3 Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 693 (2001).  TPS holders are lawfully present in this country.  \n4 They have significant liberty interests, protected by the Due Process Clause, in a non-arbitrary \n5 decision as to the continuation of their TPS status. \n6 114.  The “very essence” of due process is the “protection of the individual against \n7 arbitrary action.”  Bd. of Regents of State Colls. v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 584 (1972).  Any \n8 deprivation of liberty or property interests must, at the very least, pass a test of rationality.  The \n9 burden on the government is greater when, as here, the liberty interests at stake derive from well-\n10 established and significant reliance interests. \n11 115.  The government also has not articulated, and cannot establish, any rational basis for \n12 reversing course on decades of established TPS policy and ignoring the current capability of TPS \n13 countries to safely receive longtime TPS holders, their families, and their U.S. citizen children. \n14 116.  Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury resulting from the arbitrary termination of the \n15 TPS designations. \n16 FOURTH CLAIM \n17 Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act \n18 (Against All Defendants by All TPS-Holder Plaintiffs) \n19 117.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained \n20 in the preceding paragraphs. \n21 118.  The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 551 et seq., ensures that federal \n22 agencies are accountable to the public by providing a “right of review” to any “person suffering \n23 legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action.”  5 \n24 U.S.C. § 702.  Judicial review is generally limited to “final agency action for which there is no \n25 other adequate remedy in a court.”  5 U.S.C. § 704. \n26 119.  Among other things, the APA empowers the federal courts to “hold unlawful and set \n27 aside agency actions, finding, and conclusions” that are “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \n28 discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  The right of review \n33 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/12/18   Page 37 of 39\n \n1 under the APA includes a right to judicial review of “executive agency action for procedural \n2 correctness.”  FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 513 (2009).   \n3 120.  To engage in procedurally appropriate decision-making, an agency must ordinarily \n4 “display awareness that it is changing position,” and may not “depart from a prior policy sub \n5 silentio.”  Id. at 515.  The APA requires an agency to provide “more substantial justification” \n6 when “its new policy rests upon factual findings that contradict those which underlay its prior \n7 policy,” or “its prior policy has engendered serious reliance interests.”  Id. \n8 121.  Defendants’ termination of the TPS designations for El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, \n9 and Sudan constitutes “final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court” \n10 pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 704, because the Defendants’ termination results in the TPS Holders’ loss \n11 of TPS “automatically and without further notice or right of appeal,” 8 C.F.R. § 244.19. \n12 122.  Defendants’ adoption of a new, drastically narrower interpretation of the TPS statute \n13 was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law in violation of the APA because it represented a \n14 sudden and unexplained departure from decades of decision-making practices and ordinary \n15 procedures.  By shifting the decision-governing standard for country designations without \n16 explanation, Defendants have ignored a clear statutory command and engaged in procedurally \n17 flawed decision-making.  Further, Defendants changed their policy without taking into account the \n18 serious reliance interests that their prior policy had engendered. \n19 123.  Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury resulting from the arbitrary termination of the \n20 TPS designations. \n21 / / / \n22 / / / \n23 / / /   \n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n34 \nCOMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/12/18   Page 38 of 39\n \n1 PRAYER FOR RELIEF  \n2 Individual Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and others similar situated, ask this Court to \n3 grant the following relief:  \n4 1.

Plaintiffs in this case are U.S. citizen children, their non-citizen parents, and other \n3  non-citizen adults who are in the United States legally, and who have lived in this country \n4  lawfully for years, in some cases decades. They challenge the Department of Homeland Security’s \n5  (“DHS”) new rule for deciding whether to terminate Temporary Protected Status (“TPS”) \n6  designations for countries facing armed conflict, natural disasters, or other crises that make the \n7  return of people from those countries untenable.  \n8  2.  During the Administration of former President Donald J. Trump, DHS announced \n9  six TPS terminations—for Sudan, Haiti, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nepal. To \n10  terminate TPS for these countries, DHS—without any formal announcement or other \n11  explanation—adopted a new, novel interpretation of the TPS statute that eschews consideration of \n12  any intervening country conditions. If permitted to take effect, these terminations would have \n13  eliminated TPS protection for approximately 400,000 individuals, making up 98 percent of all \n14  TPS holders at the time.  \n15  3.  TPS holders who would have been affected by these terminations have lived legally \n16  with this status for years, and in most cases decades. They have homes, spouses, jobs, and other \n17  profound social ties to their communities that now entwine their lives with this country. TPS \n18  allows them to live and work lawfully in the United States when they cannot return safely to their \n19  country of origin. In addition to the harm of the terminations on TPS holders themselves, over \n20  250,000 U.S. citizen children, each of them with a parent or parents who are TPS holders, would \n21  have faced an impossible choice between leaving the only home they have ever known, or \n22  growing up without one or both parents.  \n23  4.  This Court granted a preliminary injunction that preserved the status of the TPS \n24  holders for most of the last five years. The injunction was reversed on appeal by a panel of the \n25  Ninth Circuit, but that decision was then vacated when the full Ninth Circuit granted Plaintiffs’ \n26  petition for rehearing en banc. The government moved to dismiss its appeal of the injunction days \n27  before the en banc argument took place. As a result, the injunction remains in place as of this time.  \n28 \n1 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 5 of 75\n \n1  5.  Since President Biden took office, DHS has authorized TPS holders from the six \n2  countries who would have been affected by the Trump-era terminations to remain in the United \n3  States, either through new TPS designations (in the case of Haiti and Sudan), or through \n4  rescinding terminations and replacing them with extensions (in the case of El Salvador, Honduras, \n5  Nepal and Nicaragua). However, in either designating or extending TPS for these countries, DHS \n6  did not disavow the illegal terminations of the prior administration or its new rule for determining \n7  which countries warrant TPS. As a result, Plaintiffs and hundreds of thousands of other TPS \n8  holders remain vulnerable to a future illegal termination under the same legal theory DHS used \n9  before.  \n10  6.  DHS’s new designations and extensions also establish irrational, grossly premature \n11  registration deadlines which all but guarantee that many thousands of TPS holders who have been \n12  protected by this Court’s injunction for the past five years—will lose their status. For example, \n13  although the TPS extension for El Salvador does not expire until June 30, 2024, the newly-\n14  established registration period for Salvadorans to benefit from DHS’s recently-issued extension \n15  began on July 12, 2023 and expires on September 10, 2023, nine months before the TPS extension \n16  itself is currently set to expire. TPS holders who fail to re-register within this time period will lose \n17  their status on July 1, 2024, even though they have held this legal status for more than twenty \n18  years and would otherwise be eligible to have the status continue. \n19  7.  Moreover, DHS imposed an illegal $50 registration fee on Haitian and Sudanese \n20  TPS holders who were required to re-register as new applicants as a result of the unlawful \n21  terminations Plaintiffs originally challenged. \n22  8.  Therefore, in this Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs challenge both the unlawful \n23  terminations issued in 2017 and 2018, which DHS has never recognized as unlawful, and certain \n24  aspects of the new TPS rescission and extension decisions, to which they are now subject.  \n25  9.  First, Plaintiffs challenge the legality of DHS’s novel interpretation of the TPS \n26  statute that eschews consideration of any intervening country conditions, to terminate TPS status \n27  for Sudan, Haiti, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nepal. Because any individual TPS \n28  period of designation is by its nature temporary—and the time to designate, extend or terminate it \n2 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 6 of 75\n \n1  will return—the current Administration’s failure to acknowledge and disavow the illegality of the \n2  prior Administration’s process for reaching termination decisions leaves Plaintiffs and other TPS \n3  holders at risk of unlawful loss of status in the future.  \n4  10.   Defendants’ new rule violates the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause in two \n5  related respects. The rule violates the Equal Protection guarantee of the Due Process Clause \n6  because it was motivated by intentional race- and national-origin-based animus against individuals \n7  from what former President Trump referred to as “shithole countries,” i.e., non-white, non-\n8  European immigrants. \n9  11.  The new rule also violates the due process protection against arbitrary government \n10  invasion of personal liberty. The new rule constitutes an arbitrary, unexplained abandonment of \n11  the government’s longstanding interpretation of the TPS statute, on which several hundred \n12  thousand people have come to rely. The Due Process Clause does not permit the government to \n13  engage in such arbitrary action when individual liberty interests are at stake. \n14  12.  Second, Defendants’ sudden and unexplained departure from decades of consistent \n15  interpretation and corresponding practice violates the Administrative Procedure Act in two \n16  respects. The sub silentio departure from pre-existing practice, with complete disregard for the \n17  reliance interests that years of peaceful residence in this country had engendered, failed to meet \n18  the minimum standards of considered judgment that the APA requires. Separately, the rule itself \n19  violates the TPS statute insofar as it limits the set of country conditions that the Secretary may \n20  consider in determining whether to extend TPS to only those conditions directly related to the \n21  events that triggered the original designation.  \n22  13.  Third, in its new TPS extensions for TPS holders affected by its prior termination \n23  decisions, DHS violated both the APA and the Due Process Clause in establishing arbitrary \n24  registration deadlines. Because these grossly premature deadlines are untethered to the existing \n25  timeline for when the TPS extensions for these populations will expire, they will cause thousands \n26  of TPS holders who have benefited from this Court’s preliminary injunction since 2018 to lose \n27  their status.  \n28 \n3 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 7 of 75\n \n1  14.  Fourth, DHS illegally charged Haitian and Sudanese TPS holders $50 to register as \n2  initial applicants after the re-designation of Haiti and Sudan for TPS in 2021 and 2022, \n3  respectively. Absent the prior illegal termination of TPS for Haiti and Sudan, existing TPS holders \n4  from these countries would not have been obligated to pay a fee for re-registration.  \n5  15.  Finally, Plaintiffs preserve their claim that Defendants’ new rule violates the \n6  constitutional rights of school-age U.S. citizen children of TPS holders, by presenting them with \n7  an impossible choice: they must either leave their country or live without their parents.  \n8  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n9  16.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because this action arises under \n10  the Constitution and laws of the United States. This Court has additional remedial authority under \n11  the Declaratory Judgment Act, see 28 U.S.C. § 2201 et seq., and the Administrative Procedure \n12  Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701–706. \n13  17.  The federal government has waived its sovereign immunity and permitted judicial \n14  review of agency action under 5 U.S.C. § 702. See Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) v. United States, \n15  870 F.2d 518, 525 (9th Cir. 1989). Sovereign immunity does not bar claims against federal \n16  officials seeking solely to prevent future violations of federal law (rather than monetary relief). \n17  See, e.g., Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 697–99 & nn.18–19 \n18  (1949); Shields v. Utah Idaho Cent. R.R. Co., 305 U.S. 177, 183–84 (1938). \n19  18.  Venue is proper in the Northern District of California under 28 U.S.C.§ 1391(e)(1) \n20  because at least one plaintiff resides in this judicial district and each defendant is an agency of the \n21  United States or an officer of the United States sued in his or her official capacity. \n22  INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT \n23  19.  Assignment is proper in the San Francisco division because a majority of the claims \n24  of the named Ramos plaintiffs arise in Alameda, Contra Costa, and Marin Counties and one of the \n25  claims of the named Bhattarai plaintiffs arises in Alameda County. Civil Local Rule 3-2(d) and 3-\n26  5(b). \n27   \n28 \n4 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 8 of 75\n \n1  THE PARTIES \n2  Ramos Plaintiffs \n3  20.  Plaintiff Crista Ramos, fourteen years old at the time DHS announced the \n4  termination of TPS for El Salvador, is a U.S. citizen who was born in Northern California and \n5  raised in San Pablo, California. She resides permanently in San Pablo, but is currently a university \n6  student in San Francisco, California. Her mother is a TPS holder from El Salvador, Plaintiff \n7  Cristina Morales. Crista has a younger brother who is also a U.S. citizen.  \n8  21.  Plaintiff Cristina Morales was born in El Salvador and has lived in the United States \n9  since 1993. She has held TPS status since 2001. Her two children were born and raised in the \n10  United States. She and her family live in San Pablo, California. \n11  22.  Plaintiff Benjamin Zepeda, fourteen years old at the time DHS announced the \n12  termination of TPS for El Salvador, is a U.S. citizen who was born and raised in Los Angeles, \n13  California, where he now lives. His parents are TPS holders from El Salvador, including his father \n14  Plaintiff Orlando Zepeda. He has a younger sister. He continues to suffer stigmatic harm from the \n15  racism that motivated DHS’s termination decisions. \n16  23.  Plaintiff Orlando Zepeda was born in El Salvador and has lived in the United States \n17  since 1984. He has been a TPS holder since 2001. He is the father of two U.S. citizen children \n18  who were twelve and fourteen years old at the time of the announcement terminating TPS for El \n19  Salvador. He lives in Los Angeles, California. \n20  24.

He now resides in Shelton, Connecticut with his \n13  children and new spouse.  \n14  Defendants \n15  43.  Defendant Alejandro Mayorkas, sued in his official capacity, is the Secretary of \n16  Homeland Security. As the highest-ranking officer for DHS, Defendant Mayorkas has ultimate \n17  statutory authority over all TPS extension, termination, and designation decisions. See 8 U.S.C. \n18  § 1254a(b); 6 U.S.C. § 557 (transferring functions from the Attorney General).   \n19  44.  Defendant U.S. Department of Homeland Security is a cabinet-level department of \n20  the Executive Branch of the federal government, and is an “agency” within the meaning of 5 \n21  U.S.C. § 551(1). DHS includes various component agencies, including the U.S. Citizenship and \n22  Immigration Services (“USCIS”). DHS, together with all of its component agencies, is responsible \n23  for administering and enforcing the TPS program. \n24  45.  Defendant United States of America includes all other government agencies and \n25  departments responsible for the implementation, administration, and change in policy concerning \n26  the TPS program. \n27 \n28 \n8 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 12 of 75\n \n1  STATUTORY FRAMEWORK \n2  46.  Congress established the Temporary Protected Status (“TPS”) program through the \n3  Immigration Act of 1990.1 TPS is a form of humanitarian relief, providing lawful immigration \n4  status to eligible foreign nationals who cannot safely return home to war-torn or disaster-stricken \n5  countries. By enacting the TPS statute, which is codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1254a, Congress \n6  established formal criteria for relief and set forth predictable procedures.2 \n7  47.  Under the TPS statute, the Secretary of Homeland Security3 makes a “designation” \n8  determination for a given country. After consulting with “appropriate” government agencies, the \n9  Secretary may designate a foreign state, or any part of that state, for TPS based on: (A) an \n10  “ongoing armed conflict within the state” that would “pose a serious threat” to the “personal \n11  safety” of the foreign nationals of that state; (B) an “earthquake, flood, drought, epidemic, or other \n12  environmental disaster in the state resulting in a substantial, but temporary, disruption of living \n13  conditions,” which makes the foreign state “unable, temporarily, to handle adequately the return to \n14  the state” of its nationals, and where the foreign state has “officially” requested a designation; or \n15  (C) the existence of “extraordinary and temporary conditions in the foreign state” that prevent \n16  foreign nationals from safely returning, and where the temporary presence of those foreign \n17  nationals in the United States is not “contrary to the national interest of the United States.”4 \n18  48.  An initial designation period for a given country lasts between six and eighteen \n19  months.5 Before the designation can become effective, the Secretary must publish a notice in the \n20   \n1 Pub. L. No. 101-649, § 302, 104 Stat. 4978, 5030–36. \n21 \n2 The Executive Branch previously used ad hoc enforcement mechanisms to allow individuals to \n22  remain in the United States for humanitarian reasons. See Adam B. Cox & Cristina Rodríguez, \nThe President and Immigration Law, 119 Yale L.J. 458, 501–02 (2009) (discussing use of the \n23  “parole power,” which is currently codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)). Presidents have \noccasionally exercised their discretion to designate countries for “Extended Voluntary Departure” \n24  and “Deferred Enforced Departure.” Somewhat like TPS, both of those delayed-departure \npractices allowed foreign nationals to lawfully remain and work in the United States while \n25  conditions in their homeland were unsafe or return was impracticable. \n3 References to the Attorney General in provisions describing functions transferred from the \n26 \nDepartment of Justice to the Department of Homeland Security “shall be deemed to refer to the \nSecretary” of Homeland Security. See 6 U.S.C. § 557. \n27 \n4 8 U.S.C. § 1254a(b)(1). \n28  5 8 U.S.C. § 1254a(b)(2), (b)(3)(C). \n9 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 13 of 75\n \n1  Federal Register that includes, among other things, a statement of findings, the effective date of \n2  the designation, and a tally of eligible foreign nationals. \n3  49.  Once the Secretary has designated a particular country for TPS, individuals from \n4  that country (or persons without nationality who last habitually resided in that country) may apply \n5  for immigration status under the program. To be eligible for TPS, however, individuals from a \n6  designated country must meet stringent requirements. These requirements include, among other \n7  things, continued physical presence and continued residence in the United States from the most \n8  recent date of designation; satisfaction of the criteria for admissibility as an immigrant; lack of \n9  disqualifying criminal history; and submission of an application, extensive documentation, and \n10  fees.6 \n11  50.  Congress ensured that individuals who are ultimately granted protected status could \n12  enjoy the freedom to live and work in the United States without fear of deportation. Under the \n13  statute, as enacted by Congress, an individual who receives and maintains TPS shall be authorized \n14  to engage in employment in the United States; shall not be detained by the Secretary of Homeland \n15  Security on the basis of immigration status; and shall not be removed from the United States by \n16  the Department of Homeland Security.7 \n17  51.  Under the TPS statute, the Secretary must periodically re-evaluate country \n18  designations. At least 60 days before a particular designation expires, the Secretary must “review \n19  the conditions in the foreign state . . . for which a designation is in effect” and determine whether \n20  the country still meets the conditions for TPS.8 If the Secretary does not terminate TPS for a \n21  particular country, then—by default—the designation will be extended for a period of six months, \n22  or by discretion of the Secretary, for a period of twelve or eighteen months.9 This periodic-review \n23  requirement also entails consultation with appropriate government agencies and, ultimately, \n24  publication of notice in the Federal Register. \n25 \n \n26  6 8 U.S.C. § 1254a(c)(1); 8 C.F.R. §§ 244.2, 244.4, 244.9. \n7 8 U.S.C. § 1254a(a)(1), (d)(4). \n27 \n8 8 U.S.C. § 1254a(b)(3). \n28  9 8 U.S.C. § 1254a(b)(3)(C). \n10 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 14 of 75\n \n1  52.  The TPS statute requires, or, alternatively, permits the Secretary to consider \n2  intervening events—i.e. events occurring after the initial designation—during the periodic review \n3  process, without regard to whether they are directly related to the crisis that triggered the country’s \n4  initial TPS designation.  \n5  53.  When a designation for a particular country is terminated, the individual TPS \n6  holder’s status will typically revert back to his or her original immigration status.10 \n7  54.  In the event of a designation or extension of a designation, USCIS establishes \n8  periods for registration or re-registration. 8 C.F.R. § 244.17(a). The failure to register or re-register \n9  within a designated time period results in the loss of TPS status. 8 U.S.C. § 1254a(c)(3)(C); 8 \n10  C.F.R. §§ 244.14(a)(3), 244.17. Historically, the agency’s practice has been to require TPS \n11  holders to re-register during the period immediately before the effective date of termination of the \n12  existing status (i.e., the date of expiry of their TPS-related documentation and employment \n13  authorization). See, e.g., 71 Fed. Reg. 54,300, 54,302 (Sept. 14, 2006) (registration period until \n14  Nov. 13, 2006 for Burundi extension otherwise expiring on Nov. 2, 2006); 81 Fed. Reg. 44,646, \n15  44,646 (July 8, 2016) (registration period until Sept. 6, 2016 for El Salvador extension otherwise \n16  expiring on Sept. 9, 2016).  \n17  55.   On information and belief, this practice is in keeping with the near-universal \n18  practice for comparable re-registration periods. For example, if an individual wants to renew a \n19  driver’s license, that individual must do so during some period shortly before the existing license \n20  expires, not at some other period that ends long before the license expires.  \n21  56.  The TPS statute provides that DHS may require payment of a “reasonable fee” not \n22  to exceed $50 for the registration of new applicants subject to new TPS designations. 8 U.S.C. \n23  § 1254a(c)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. § 1254a(c)(1)(A)(iv). USCIS may not charge the initial registration fee \n24  for the renewal of TPS for existing TPS holders. 8 C.F.R. §§ 244.17(a). \n25  THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ADOPTED A NEW STANDARD FOR TPS \n26  DECISIONS IN ORDER TO BRING ABOUT THE END OF TPS  \n27 \n \n28  10 8 C.F.R. § 244.19. \n11 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 15 of 75\n \n1  57.  After President Trump took office, White House officials11 began to pressure DHS \n2  to end TPS. See also infra ¶¶ 138-152.   \n3  58.  The White House Domestic Policy Council sought repeatedly to influence the \n4  decision-making process at the State Department and DHS to ensure a predetermined outcome: \n5  the termination of TPS designations. Stephen Miller, President Trump’s senior advisor for \n6  domestic policy, frequently reached out to DHS to urge the termination of TPS.12  \n7  59.  In addition, a number of political surrogates13 working to advance President \n8  Trump’s agenda took positions with DHS. Officials from President Trump’s immigration \n9  transition team, including Kathy Nuebel Kovarik, Lee Francis Cissna, and Gene Hamilton, \n10  assumed high-level positions at DHS and USCIS, where they directly shaped TPS policy.  \n11  60.  In October 2017, Kovarik hired Robert Law to join USCIS as a Senior Adviser and \n12  assigned him responsibility for editing career staffs’ TPS recommendations. Law had previously \n13  worked as the Government Relations Director for the “anti-immigrant hate group” Federation for \n14  American Immigration Reform (“FAIR”),14 where he co-authored a report for the 2017 Trump \n15 \n16 \n \n17  11 Hereinafter, the terms “White House” and “White House officials” refer to political appointees \nand surrogates who worked directly for President Trump to advance and effectuate his \n18  immigration policy agenda. \n12 ECF No. 122-12 (Ex. 12) at 10‒11, 19‒20; ECF No. 122-85 (Ex. 85) at 7‒8, 11‒12, 16‒19; \n19 \nECF No. 122-71 (Ex. 71).

In order “to get to the President/White House’s desired result of terminating TPS,” \n4  President Trump’s political surrogates within DHS made numerous changes to TPS practices.16 \n5  Most significantly, under their leadership, DHS adopted a new, novel—and legally erroneous—\n6  interpretation of the TPS statute that precluded consideration of intervening events during the \n7  periodic review process. \n8  62.  Pursuant to this new, erroneous interpretation of the TPS statute, DHS abandoned a \n9  long-established practice under which it considered all current conditions—including intervening \n10  events—in deciding whether to extend or terminate a country’s TPS designation. In its place, DHS \n11  adopted a new, narrow practice in which DHS considers only whether the original conditions that \n12  initially gave rise to the TPS designation persist, and only those ongoing harms directly tied to \n13  those original conditions.  \n14  63.  Before the Trump Administration, for at least twenty years, Republican and \n15  Democratic Administrations alike regularly relied on intervening factors arising after a country’s \n16  original TPS designation to extend TPS. Secretaries considered the full range of current country \n17  conditions in making TPS decisions, regardless of whether those conditions traced back to the \n18  event that triggered the original designation.  \n19  64.  Under the Trump Administration, in contrast, extensions would be permitted only \n20  when warranted by the continued effects of the original event triggering the TPS designation.  \n21  65.  In June 2017, then-Secretary Kelly described the new standard. He testified at a \n22  Senate hearing that DHS could only consider the original reason for a country’s designation when \n23  recommending extension or termination. He explained that, in the Administration’s view, TPS “is \n24  for a specific event”—for instance, an earthquake in Haiti—“and that’s how I have to look at it.”17 \n \n25 \n15 ECF No. 122-23 (Ex. 23) at 15-16. \n26  16 See Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction, Ramos v.

Secretary Nielsen later echoed Kelly’s view. She testified, “[t]he law does not allow \n2  me to look at the country conditions of a country writ large. It requires me to look very \n3  specifically as to whether the country conditions originating from the original designation \n4  continue to exist. . . . [T]he law requires me, if I cannot say that the conditions emanating from the \n5  [originating condition] still exist, regardless of other systemic conditions, I must terminate TPS.”18 \n6  She also testified, “[t]he law says that if the effects of the originating event, so that’s a causation \n7  issue, do not continue to exist[,] then the Secretary of Homeland Security must terminate [TPS]. . . \n8  . If the underlying conditions in a country are themselves dangerous, unfortunately that is not \n9  something that I can consider in the termination.”19  \n10  67.  Internal agency guidance prepared by the Trump-era DHS directed, “the law \n11  requires that when the conditions prompting a country’s original designation for TPS no longer \n12  exist, the Department must terminate the country’s TPS designation.”20  \n13  68.  White House officials directly urged the new standard as part of its overall effort to \n14  end TPS and as applied to specific countries. For example, in November 2017, three days before \n15  the statutory deadline for TPS decisions for Nicaragua and Honduras, the White House convened \n16  a Cabinet-level meeting urging termination for Nicaragua, Honduras, Haiti, and El Salvador. In a \n17  “Discussion Paper” to guide the meeting, the White House applied the new standard, asserting that \n18  termination was required because “the temporary conditions that arose out of natural disasters and \n19  supported [the original] TPS designations have long ceased to exist.”21  \n20  69.  As one source described, following the meeting, White House Chief of Staff John \n21  Kelly and Homeland Security Advisor Tom Bossert called Acting Secretary Elaine Duke and “put \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n \n26  18 ECF No. 122-36 (Ex. 36) at 25-26. \n19 ECF No. 122-34 (Ex. 34) at 47. \n27 \n20 ECF No. 122-37 (Ex. 37) at 1 (DPP_00003099). \n28  21 ECF 122-14 (Ex. 14) at 14 (DPP_00003578). \n14 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 18 of 75\n \n1  massive pressure on her” to terminate TPS for Honduras and Nicaragua.22 They told her that TPS \n2  was an obstacle to the President’s “wider strategic goal” on immigration.23  \n3  70.  Subsequently, Acting Secretary Duke determined that “[t]he TPS program must end \n4  for these countries soon.”24 She acknowledged that “[t]his conclusion [was] the result of an \n5  America first view.”25 She then terminated TPS for Nicaragua. She declined to make a decision on \n6  TPS for Honduras, with the result that its TPS designation was automatically extended for six \n7  months. 8 U.S.C. § 1254a(b)(3)(C). She made clear, however, that termination for Honduras was \n8  imminent under the new standard. In an email to White House Chief of Staff Kelly, she explained \n9  that her “no decision” on Honduras was “a strong break with past practice. . . . By not \n10  affirmatively extending, I’m stating that I’m not satisfied that the country conditions remain—but \n11  not yet sure how best to end TPS for this country.”26 She described her decisions as “send[ing] a \n12  clear signal that TPS in general is coming to a close . . . consistent with the President’s position on \n13  immigration.”27 \n14  71.  In addition to adopting a new standard for TPS decisions, the Trump Administration \n15  altered the process for conducting TPS reviews in other ways.  \n16  72.  Prior to the Trump Administration, TPS review began with an objective country \n17  conditions report prepared by career specialists. The reports formed the basis for decision memos \n18  containing the USCIS Director’s recommendation to the DHS Secretary and Federal Register \n19  notices announcing the decision. Career officials would draft Federal Register notices in tandem \n20  with the decision memos, because the final decisions published in those notices were guided by \n21  the recommendations from the career staff in the decision memos.  \n \n22 \n22 Nick Miroff, White House chief of staff tried to pressure acting DHS secretary to expel \n23  thousands of Hondurans, officials say, WASH.

In the Trump era, this process changed. Political surrogates assumed responsibility \n2  for the periodic TPS reviews. They disregarded the recommendations of career professionals and \n3  rewrote decision memos so that the memos would “fully support” the pre-determined decision to \n4  terminate TPS.28 Political surrogates also assumed control of drafting the Federal Register notices. \n5  Whereas under prior administrations the Federal Register notice followed logically from career \n6  officials’ drafts of the decision memos, under the Trump Administration this was no longer the \n7  case.   \n8  74.  In addition, whereas prior administrations had typically conducted separate review \n9  processes for each country, the Trump Administration reviewed multiple countries together, even \n10  though each had different originating and current conditions. For example, White House officials \n11  “coordinat[ed] the conditions and process for terminating [TPS] for aliens from El Salvador, \n12  Honduras, Nicaragua, and Haiti.”29  \n13  75.  Moreover, input from U.S. embassies, traditionally accorded great weight, was \n14  disregarded by the Trump-era DHS, because the input did not support the goal of termination. As \n15  James D. Nealon, chief of the DHS Office of Policy and former U.S. Ambassador to Honduras, \n16  testified, the State Department traditionally afforded great weight to ambassadors’ input. Under \n17  prior administrations there would have been significant debate if DHS were to reject an \n18  ambassador’s recommendation in favor of a contrary, internal recommendation. However, this all \n19  changed under the Trump Administration. State Department leadership ignored cables from U.S. \n20  embassies in TPS-designated countries that sought to convey country conditions and offer \n21  recommendations on TPS decisions. Additionally, in some cases, State Department leadership \n22  stalled providing recommendations drafted by career State Department professionals until it was \n23  too late for DHS to substantively consider them. \n24  76.  The first TPS termination announced by the Trump Administration was for Sudan in \n25  September 2017. In a draft decision memo, career officials reviewed a broad range of country \n26  conditions, including intervening conditions, and recommended against terminating TPS for \n \n27 \n28 ECF No. 122-3 (Ex. 3) at 2‒3. \n28  29 ECF No. 122-14 (Ex. 14) at 12.  \n16 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 20 of 75\n \n1  Sudan. Political surrogates then edited the memo to recommend termination. The resulting \n2  decision memo was so incoherent that then USCIS Director Francis Cissna said it read “like one \n3  person who strongly supports extending TPS for Sudan wrote everything up to the \n4  recommendation section and then someone who opposes extension snuck up behind the first guy, \n5  clubbed him over the head, pushed his senseless body out of the way, and finished the memo.”30 \n6  The memo was changed several more times before ultimately being revised “to clearly support the \n7  . . . decision to terminate.”31  \n8  77.  Subsequent terminations underwent a similar process. For example, Kovarik \n9  complained in October 2017 of a “problem” in decision memos drafted by career professionals for \n10  Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador, because they “read[] as though we’d recommend an \n11  extension b/c we talk so much about how bad it is, but there’s not enough in there about positive \n12  steps that have been taken since it’s designation.”32 A career professional responded, “We can \n13  comb through the country conditions to try to see what else there might be, but the basic problem \n14  is that it IS bad there [with respect to] all of the standard metrics. Our strongest argument for \n15  termination, we thought, is just that it is not bad in a way clearly linked to the initial disasters \n16  prompting the designations.”33 \n17  DHS APPLIED ITS NEW ERROENOUS INTERPRETATION OF THE TPS \n18  STATUTE TO THE TPS TERMINATIONS AT ISSUE IN THIS CASE \n19  78.  The Trump Administration applied its new rule to its TPS decisions. In at least five \n20  announcements terminating a TPS designation, the DHS Secretary explicitly stated that she \n21  compared “the conditions upon which the country’s original designation was based” with “an \n22  assessment of whether those originating conditions continue to exist.”34 Even where she did not \n \n23 \n30 ECF No. 122-1 (Ex. 1) at DPP_00000472. \n24 \n31 ECF No. 111-1 at 12‒15. \n25  32 ECF No. 122-2 (Ex. 2) at DPP_00003139‒45. \n33 Id. at DPP_00003139. \n26 \n34 Press Release, Dep’t of Homeland Sec., Sec’y of Homeland Sec.

Sudan was first designated for TPS on November 4, 1997, in the midst of a long-\n5  running civil war.35 Since that time, successive administrations reviewed Sudan’s TPS status and \n6  saw fit to maintain TPS protection for the county eighteen times. Nine of these reviews occurred \n7  after Sudan’s civil war officially concluded in January 2005 with the signing of the \n8  Comprehensive Peace Agreement. Attorneys General and Secretaries of Homeland Security \n9  consistently considered intervening factors wholly or partially unrelated to the civil war, including \n10  natural disasters, “perennial environmental shocks, such as flooding and droughts,” new armed \n11  conflicts, growing poverty,36 criminal activity, and “deteriorating economic conditions” leading to \n12  “increased food and fuel prices.”37 \n13  80.  Nevertheless, in September 2017, Acting Secretary Duke ignored intervening \n14  conditions to terminate Sudan’s TPS designation. The TPS country conditions memo for Sudan, \n15  drafted by career staff, provided that “while armed conflict has been the primary driving force \n16  behind the humanitarian needs in Sudan, poverty, floods, drought and environmental degradation \n17  have also significantly affected the livelihoods of vulnerable people, particularly children”; “an \n18  inadequate transportation infrastructure prevents efficient access to markets”; there was \n19  “significant economic instability after the secession of South Sudan in 2011”; and the country had \n20 \n21   \n(Nov. 20, 2017); Press Release, Dep’t of Homeland Sec., Acting Sec’y Elaine Duke \n22  Announcement on Temp.

The 2017 decision memo recommending the termination of TPS for Sudan was far \n4  more limited. It provided that Sudan was designated for TPS in 1997 “due to ongoing armed \n5  conflict and extraordinary and temporary conditions in Sudan,” and that TPS for Sudan should be \n6  terminated as “[t]here were unilateral ceasefires in October 2016 which led to a reduction in \n7  violence and rhetoric from the conflict parties” and, that while “[t]here is ongoing conflict in some \n8  regions, [it is] not the entire country.”39 The Federal Register notice stated curtly that “the ongoing \n9  armed conflict and extraordinary and temporary conditions that served as the basis for Sudan’s \n10  most recent designation have sufficiently improved such that they no longer prevent nationals of \n11  Sudan from returning in safety to all regions of Sudan.” 40   \n12  82.  The periodic review process for Sudan was highly irregular, and included a series of \n13  memoranda in which the recommendations were delinked from the country conditions analyses. In \n14  a draft decision memo, career officials reviewed a broad range of conditions, including \n15  intervening events such as a cholera outbreak and lack of access to drinking water, and concluded, \n16  “termination does not appear to be warranted.”41 But political surrogates edited the decision memo \n17  to recommend termination. In support, they tacked on a section focused narrowly on the factors \n18  that triggered Sudan’s original designation. USCIS Director Francis Cissna identified the memo’s \n19  incoherence which read like different people drafted the analysis and the recommendations.42 The \n20  memo was then “repackage[d]”43 several more times before ultimately being revised “to clearly \n21  support the . . . decision to terminate.”  \n22  83.  Internal communications demonstrate that government personnel involved in the \n23  TPS decision-making for Sudan understood that they could not consider intervening conditions, \n \n24 \n38 ECF No. 111-1 (Ex. 1) at DPP_00002275, DPP_00002281.- \n25  39 ECF No. 122-87 (Ex. 87) at AR-SUDAN-00000006, AR-SUDAN-00000010. \n26  40 82 Fed.

Later, Gene Hamilton, working as Senior Counselor to the DHS Secretary, removed \n4  “examples of human rights” violations from the draft Federal Register Notice announcing the \n5  termination of TPS for Sudan. A career subject matter expert recognized that Hamilton’s edits \n6  would be “read as taking another step toward providing an incomplete and lopsided country \n7  conditions presentation to support termination[.]”44 The disconnect between the termination and \n8  the dangerous conditions in Sudan drew criticism from within DHS and the State Department. \n9  Nicaragua \n10  85.  Nicaragua was designated for TPS by Attorney General Janet Reno on January 5, \n11  1999 after Hurricane Mitch caused severe damage to the country.45 Multiple Attorneys General \n12  and DHS Secretaries subsequently agreed that conditions in Nicaragua warranted maintenance of \n13  its TPS designation, which occurred thirteen times in all. Those decisions took into consideration \n14  social, economic, and infrastructural challenges that were not directly attributable to the \n15  hurricane.46 They cited to environmental disasters that occurred after Hurricane Mitch,47 a \n16  fractured economic foundation and “chronic poverty,” and problems of governance and political \n17 \n \n18 \n44 ECF No. 122-5 (Ex. 5) at DPP_00003177. \n19  45 Hurricane Mitch killed more than 3,000 people, and destroyed an estimated 145,000 homes, \nninety health clinics, nearly 350 schools, and seventy percent of Nicaragua’s roads. The severe \n20 \nflooding and landslides resulting from Hurricane Mitch buried entire villages and caused more \nthan $1.3 billion of damage. See 64 Fed. Reg. 526 (Jan. 5, 1999); 72 Fed.

In November 2017, Acting Secretary Duke reversed course, terminating TPS for \n6  Nicaragua and relying on the Trump Administration’s new rule that only permitted the \n7  consideration of originating conditions. The November 2017 decision memo recommending the \n8  termination of TPS for Nicaragua provides that “Nicaragua’s current challenges cannot be directly \n9  tied to destruction stemming from Hurricane Mitch.”50 The December 2017 Federal Register \n10  notice which announced the termination of TPS for Nicaragua included only a three-paragraph \n11  explanation that failed to address any of the intervening conditions considered by previous \n12  administrations.51 \n13  87.  This termination decision followed immense pressure from White House officials \n14  working at the President’s behest to persuade Acting Secretary Duke to terminate TPS for \n15  Nicaragua and three other countries—Honduras, El Salvador, and Haiti. On October 31, 2017, \n16  State Department Secretary Rex Tillerson recommended the termination of TPS for these four \n17  countries, and the next day called Secretary Duke saying this was “just something she just had to \n18  do.”52 White House officials made repeated entreaties to Acting Secretary Duke in the final days \n19  before the deadline for her to make a decision regarding Nicaragua: holding a Cabinet-level \n20   \n48 75 Fed.

Haiti was first designated for TPS by Secretary Napolitano on January 21, 2010 after \n7  a 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck the country,54 killing as many as 300,000 people.55 Since then, \n8  DHS provided protection for Haiti under the TPS program from 2011 to 2017.56 In continuing \n9  Haiti’s status under the TPS program, Secretaries Napolitano and Johnson considered a variety of \n10  factors and conditions that arose subsequent to the earthquake, many of which were wholly or \n11  partially unrelated to it, including crime, poverty, unemployment, lack of adequate social \n12  services,57 and successive health and environmental disasters, including destruction caused by \n13  Hurricane Matthew.58 \n14  89.  In the first TPS decision of the Trump Administration, Secretary Kelly extended \n15  Haiti’s TPS designation in May 2017, but did so for the minimum six months allowed by statute. \n16  In an extraordinary Federal Register notice providing for this “limited 6-month” extension, DHS \n17  Secretary Kelly announced that “[t]he Secretary is committed to making TPS determinations that \n18  fully comply with the Immigration and Nationality Act and the intent of the program to provide a \n19  temporary form of immigration relief and protection.”59 The notice repeatedly suggested TPS \n20  would shortly end by, inter alia, warning TPS holders to obtain travel documents.60 and Secretary \n \n21 \n53 ECF No. 122-11 (Ex. 11) at DPP_00002599; ECF No. 122-30 (Ex. 30) at DHS_RFPD \n22  00000005. \n54 75 Fed.

Six months later, and one week after President Trump’s “shithole countries” \n4  comment, Acting Secretary Duke terminated Haitian TPS citing only conditions associated with \n5  the 2010 designation and the 2011 redesignation. The Federal Register notice terminating TPS for \n6  Haiti ignored intervening conditions identified in prior extensions of TPS for Haiti.62 The decision \n7  memo recommending the termination of TPS for Haiti incorporated the new rule, noting that Haiti \n8  was designated for TPS in 2010 “due to extraordinary and temporary conditions resulting from the \n9  [2010] earthquake” and recommending termination because “[a]ny current issues in Haiti are \n10  unrelated to the 2010 earthquake” and “Haiti has made significant progress in recovering from the \n11  2010 earthquake.”63  \n12  91.  In response to questions from legislators about the status of TPS for Haiti, both \n13  Secretary Kelly and Secretary Nielsen testified that the law required only a consideration of \n14  originating conditions. Secretary Kelly testified to the Senate in 2017 that “Haiti had horrible \n15  conditions before the earthquake, and those conditions aren't much better after the earthquake. But \n16  the earthquake was why TPS was – was granted and – and that's how I have to look at it.”64  \n17  92.  Secretary Nielsen testified similarly in response to a question about Haiti in April \n18  2018: “[T]he law really restricts my ability to extend TPS. The law says that if the effects of the \n19  originating event, so that’s a causation issue, do not continue to exist then the secretary of \n20  Homeland Security must terminate.”65 DHS publicly said the same, in communications to the \n21  press, asserting that the law required them “to determine whether conditions that led to Haiti’s \n22  initial designation in 2010 remain.”66 \n23 \n \n24  61 Press Release, Dep’t of Homeland Sec., Sec’y Kelly’s Statement on the Limited Extension of \nHaiti’s Designation for Temporary Protected Status (May 22, 2017). \n25  62 83 Fed.

In a separate email exchange, USCIS political appointee Kovarik received feedback \n9  from the person she appointed to serve as her Senior Policy Advisor that he edited the Haiti \n10  decision memo to “fully support termination” after finding that the draft memo compiled by career \n11  employees was “overwhelmingly weighted for extension,” which he did “not think [was] the \n12  conclusion we are looking for.”68  \n13  El Salvador \n14  95.  El Salvador was the first country designated for TPS, as part of the Immigration Act \n15  of 1990.69 Advocacy for Salvadorans denied fair asylum processes—while the United States was \n16  supporting one of the warring parties in the civil war in El Salvador—was one of the primary \n17  motivations for that decision.70 \n18  96.  El Salvador was most recently designated for TPS on March 9, 2001 after three \n19  devastating earthquakes.71 All told, various administrations continued TPS for El Salvador eleven \n20  times based on a variety of factors and conditions that did not exist at the time of the original \n21  designation, and that were unrelated to the earthquakes. Among other considerations, they cited \n22 \n \n23  67 ECF No. 119-1 (Ex. 124) at DPP_00018751. \n24  68 ECF No. 122-3 (Ex. 3) at DPP_00003349. \n69 Immigration Act of 1990, Pub.

The earthquakes killed over 1,100 people, damaged or destroyed approximately \n220,000 homes, 1,696 schools, and 856 public buildings, and affected approximately 1.5 million \n28 \npeople. See 66 Fed. Reg. 14,214 (Mar. 9, 2001). \n24 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 28 of 75\n \n1  droughts and a leaf rust epidemic that caused destabilizing food insecurity and malnutrition,72 \n2  health emergencies,73 subsequent environmental disasters, including another earthquake in 2012, \n3  volcanic eruptions, hurricanes, mudslides and flooding,74 economic instability, and crime75 as \n4  grounds for continuing TPS. The 2016 El Salvador decision memo, which was issued at the end of \n5  the Obama Administration, expressly considered intervening conditions as part of its \n6  recommendation that TPS be extended for El Salvador based on the 2001 earthquakes “and \n7  subsequent environmental disasters.”76 \n8  97.  But when terminating TPS for Salvadorans in January 2018, Secretary Nielsen \n9  ignored the contemporary realities of life in El Salvador by asking only whether disruptions \n10  traceable to the 2001 earthquakes had abated. The Secretary summarized the agency’s reason for \n11  termination by asserting that “DHS has reviewed conditions in El Salvador” and “determined that \n12  the conditions supporting El Salvador’s 2001 designation for TPS” based on a series of \n13  earthquakes “are no longer met” because “[r]ecovery efforts . . . have largely been completed” and \n14  “social and economic conditions affected by the earthquakes have stabilized.”77 The Secretary \n15  ignored natural and environmental disasters, pervasive gang violence, mass food insecurity, and \n16  other humanitarian crises since the 2001 earthquake.78 The decision memo expressly rejected as \n17  irrelevant current conditions not clearly related to the 2001 earthquakes—recommending the \n18 \n \n19  72 80 Fed.

Soon after making the decision to terminate TPS for El Salvador, DHS Secretary \n5  Nielsen testified before the Senate, noting that for El Salvador, “we didn't dispute the country \n6  conditions are difficult . . . , but unfortunately, the law requires me, if I cannot say that the \n7  conditions emanating from the earthquakes still exist, regardless of other systemic conditions, I \n8  must terminate TPS.”80 \n9  Nepal \n10 \n99.  Nepal was first designated for TPS by Secretary Jeh Johnson on June 24, 2015, after \n11 \na 7.8 magnitude earthquake and a number of significant aftershocks struck the country, killing \n12 \nnearly 9,000 people, injuring more than 20,000 people, displacing millions, and destroying or \n13 \nsignificantly damaging over 750,000 homes.81 On October 26, 2016, DHS extended Nepal’s \n14 \ndesignation for eighteen months.82 The extension took into account a variety of factors and \n15 \nconditions that arose subsequent to the original designation, many of which were wholly or \n16 \npartially unrelated to the earthquakes, including civil unrest, the obstruction of crossings at the \n17 \nNepal-India border, and inadequate sanitation.83 \n18 \n100.  On April 26, 2018, Secretary Nielsen announced her decision to terminate TPS for \n19 \nNepal, with a twelve-month delayed effective date. 84 Like previous Trump-era TPS terminations, \n20 \nthe decision was the product of the White House’s persistent and ongoing effort to end TPS.  \n21 \n \n22 \n79 ECF No. 122-110 (Ex. 110) at AR-EL_SALVADOR-00000045, AR-EL_SALVADOR-\n00000049. \n23 \n80 ECF No. 122-36 (Ex. 36) at 25-26. \n24 \n81 80 Fed.

Nielsen Announcement \n27  on Temporary Protected Status for Nepal (Apr. 26, 2018) (emphases added), https://www.dhs. \ngov/news/2018/04/26/secretary-kirstjen-m-nielsen-announcement-temporary-protected-status-\n28 \nnepal. \n26 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 30 of 75\n \n1  101.  In terminating Nepal’s TPS, DHS applied its new standard. The Secretary \n2  considered only whether Nepal had recovered from the earthquake that triggered its original \n3  designation; intervening conditions that affected the country were not considered except to the \n4  extent they related directly to the original basis for designation. \n5  102.  During the periodic review process for Nepal, Trump surrogate Kovarik instructed \n6  career employees to focus the country conditions report specifically on progress in earthquake and \n7  recovery efforts as opposed to the extremely comprehensive overview usually provided. In \n8  response, career employees agreed not to devote research to political crises and other intervening \n9  conditions not directly related to the earthquake.  \n10  103.  An early draft decision memo for Nepal described the decision whether to extend or \n11  terminate as a close case. It described the destructive intervening events that had befallen Nepal \n12  but then dismissed them, because they were not primarily related to the original event, stating that, \n13  in August 2017, the worst rains in 15 years struck Nepal, triggering widespread large-scale \n14  flooding and landslides, causing significant property damage, and impacting access to food, water, \n15  and healthcare, albeit primarily in the southern plains region that has been little affected by the \n16  earthquake. The draft recommended termination with an eighteen-month wind down period.  \n17  104.  Upon reviewing a subsequent draft decision memo, USCIS Director Cissna \n18  complained that it did not adequately support the proposal to terminate TPS. He noted specific \n19  sections of the memo that he viewed as problematic, including factual statements about challenges \n20  to Nepal’s rebuilding efforts and the number of individuals still living in temporary shelters.  \n21  105.  The final Nepal decision memo recommended termination with a twelve-month \n22  wind-down period and no longer described the decision as a close case. The memo emphasized \n23  original conditions and significantly downplayed the significance of any intervening factors. For \n24  example, it limited consideration of the damage caused by severe, post-earthquake flooding in \n25  Nepal to simply one of several factors delaying the completion of recovery and reconstruction \n26  efforts but otherwise unrelated to the earthquake that led to the TPS designation and, therefore, not \n27  relevant to the termination decision. To the extent the decision memo considered the independent \n28 \n27 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 31 of 75\n \n1  effects of severe flooding, it was only to assert that disruption caused by the flooding did not rise \n2  to the level of a new event that would warrant a new TPS designation.  \n3  106.  In a press release announcing the termination of TPS for Nepal, DHS explained, \n4  “[t]he decision to terminate TPS for Nepal was made after a review of the environmental disaster-\n5  related conditions upon which the country’s original designation was based and an assessment of \n6  whether those originating conditions continue to exist as required by statute.”85 \n7  107.  Accompanying DHS Press Affairs Guidance stated that based on careful \n8  consideration of available information, the Secretary determined that the original conditions \n9  caused by the 2015 earthquake no longer exist. Thus, as required under the applicable statute, the \n10  current TPS designation must be terminated. \n11  108.  The announcement terminating Nepal’s TPS was published in the Federal Register \n12  on May 22, 2018.86 The Federal Register notice made no mention of intervening events and did \n13  not discuss the severe flooding of August 2017. \n14  Honduras \n15 \n109.  Honduras was originally designated for TPS on January 5, 1999 by Attorney \n16 \nGeneral Janet Reno, after Hurricane Mitch caused severe damage to the country.87 Multiple \n17 \nAttorneys General and DHS Secretaries extended TPS for Honduras in regular periodic reviews \n18 \nover nearly twenty years—fourteen times in all. Those extensions took into consideration social, \n19 \neconomic, environmental, and infrastructural challenges that were not directly attributable to the \n20 \nhurricane.88 For instance, decisions to extend TPS for Honduras cited environmental disasters that \n21 \n22 \n \n23 \n85 Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Security, Secretary Kirstjen M.

Reg. 23,744 (May 5, 2003). \n28 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 32 of 75\n \n1  occurred after Hurricane Mitch,89 a “deteriorating economy,” and a “political crisis” that \n2  “significantly reduc[ed] economic activity.”90 \n3  110.  On May 4, 2018, Secretary Nielsen announced her decision to terminate TPS for \n4  Honduras with an eighteen-month delayed effective date. Like the previous Trump-era TPS \n5  terminations, her decision was the product of the Trump Administration’s systematic effort to end \n6  TPS. It effectuated a predetermined conclusion articulated by Acting Secretary Duke months \n7  earlier, when she allowed a short, automatic six-month extension for Honduras because she was \n8  not yet sure how best to end TPS for this country.  \n9  111.  In terminating TPS for Honduras, DHS applied its new rule. The Secretary assessed \n10  only whether Honduras had recovered from Hurricane Mitch and did not consider intervening \n11  conditions. For example, the Honduras decision memo explicitly dismissed current challenges \n12  because they cannot be directly tied to damage from the storm 20 years ago.  \n13  112.  The DHS press release announcing the Secretary’s decision explained, “[T]he \n14  Secretary determined that the disruption of living conditions in Honduras from Hurricane Mitch \n15  that served as the basis for its TPS designation has decreased to a degree that it should no longer \n16  be regarded as substantial. . . . Thus, as required under the applicable statute, the current TPS \n17  designation must be eliminated.”91 \n18  113.  On the same day that DHS publicly announced the termination of TPS for Honduras \n19  (and about six weeks after the filing of Ramos, challenging the new practice as unlawful), an \n20  addendum was added to the Honduras decision memo. The addendum provides supplemental \n21  information on environmental conditions related to problems caused by pine beetles and coffee \n22 \n \n23  89 See, e.g., id. (“[R]ecent droughts as well as flooding from Hurricane Michelle in 2001 have \nadded to the humanitarian, economic, and social problems initially brought on by Hurricane Mitch \n24 \nin 1998.”); 75 Fed. Reg. 24,734, 24,735 (May 5, 2010) (“[O]ther natural disasters have occurred \nsince Hurricane Mitch, including flooding in October 2008 and an earthquake in May 2009, which \n25 \nhave further delayed the recovery from Hurricane Mitch.”). \n26  90 75 Fed. Reg. 24,734, 24,735 (May 5, 2010). \n91 Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Security, Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen M. \n27 \nNielsen Announcement on Temporary Protected Status for Honduras (May 4, 2018) (emphasis \nadded), https://www.dhs.gov/news/2018/05/04/secretary-homeland-security-kirstjen-m-nielsen-\n28 \nannouncement-temporary-protected. \n29 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 33 of 75\n \n1  rust. The Federal Register notice announcing the termination of TPS for Honduras, published on \n2  June 5, 2018, similarly mentions pine beetles and coffee rust, along with a range of other factors.  \n3  114.  The addendum and similar information in the Federal Register notice were added as \n4  post hoc justifications for DHS’s decision to terminate TPS for Honduras. They do not reflect the \n5  narrower range of factors—based solely on the impact of Hurricane Mitch—actually considered \n6  by DHS in deciding to terminate.    \n7  115.  In a May 11, 2018 memorandum, members of the Senate Foreign Relations \n8  Committee complained that Defendants “deliberately disregarded the counsel and expertise of \n9  officials at the State Department and the U.S. Embassies in [Honduras, El Salvador, and Haiti], \n10  which uniformly argued for an extension of the TPS designations.”92 As the memorandum \n11  observed, the termination “was the result of an overtly political process.”93 \n12  THE CHANGES TO THE TPS CRITERIA AND THE ULTIMATE TERMINATIONS \n13  WERE MOTIVATED BY RACIAL ANIMUS \n14 \n116.  The Secretary’s adoption of a new rule for making TPS determinations was \n15 \nmotivated in significant part by racial and national-origin animus.  \n16 \nFormer President Trump’s Racist Statements \n17 \n18  117.  The animus motivating the new rule resulting in the termination of TPS is evidenced \n19  by numerous statements made by former President Donald J. Trump and other officials in his \n20  administration. A limited number of those statements are described herein, and they leave no \n21  doubt as to the speaker’s racially discriminatory motives against non-white and non-European \n22  immigrants.  \n23  118.  In particular, President Trump referred to countries designated for TPS as “shithole” \n24  countries a mere seven days before Defendants terminated Haiti’s TPS status, in a conversation \n25 \n \n26  92 Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Security, Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen M. \nNielsen Announcement on Temporary Protected Status for Honduras (May 4, 2018) (emphasis \n27  added), https://www.dhs.gov/news/2018/05/04/secretary-homeland-security-kirstjen-m-nielsen-\nannouncement-temporary-protected. \n28  93 Id. \n30 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 34 of 75\n \n1  with legislators about TPS. On or about January 11, 2018, several lawmakers gathered with the \n2  President in the White House’s Oval Office to discuss a bipartisan immigration proposal. \n3  President Trump grew frustrated when the conversation turned to a proposal that would grant \n4  permanent status to some people with TPS protections from certain Latin American and African \n5  countries. “Why,” the President asked, “are we having all these people from shithole countries \n6  come here?”94 He expressed a preference, instead, for immigrants from countries “like Norway.”95 \n7  119.  Senator Dick Durbin, who was present at the January 11, 2018 meeting in the Oval \n8  Office, characterized the President’s comments as “clearly racial,” “hate-filled,” and “vile.”96 \n9  Senator Durbin reportedly warned the President that excluding immigrants based on those grounds \n10  would be “an obvious racial decision.”97 Secretary Nielsen, also present at the January 11, 2018 \n11  Oval Office meeting,98 acknowledged that the President used “tough language.”99 Although she \n12  claimed that she did not know whether Norway was a “predominantly white country,” she \n13  admitted that she “imagine[d] that is the case.”100 \n14  120.  Throughout his candidacy and presidency, President Trump repeatedly denigrated \n15  non-white, non-European immigrants and has expressed his interest in resurrecting a vision of \n16  U.S. identity that privileges whiteness.  \n17  121.  On the very first day of his presidential campaign, then-candidate Trump \n18  categorically branded Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists: “When Mexico sends its \n19  people, they’re not sending their best. . . .

Both during his campaign and after taking office, President Trump repeatedly \n4  compared immigrants to snakes that will bite and kill anyone foolish enough to shelter them.102 \n5  123.  President Trump repeatedly “retweeted” avowed white nationalists, such as \n6  @WhiteGenocideTM, thereby endorsing their racist views and amplifying their message.103 \n7  124.  When a lawsuit against Trump University was assigned to Judge Gonzalo Curiel, \n8  then-candidate Trump repeatedly asserted that the Judge would be biased against him due to the \n9  Judge’s Mexican heritage.104 \n10  125.  After a crowd of white nationalists marched on Charlottesville, Virginia, President \n11  Trump praised some of the protesters as “very fine people.”105 \n12  126.  Former President Trump often conflated large groups of immigrants, and sometimes \n13  even all of them, with members of the MS-13 gang.106 In his first State of the Union address, he \n14  suggested that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) program, recipients of \n15  which are immigrants first brought to the United States as children many years ago, contributed to \n16  the spread of MS-13.107  \n17 \n18   \n101 Wash.

President Trump also made disparaging remarks about certain Central American, \n2  African, Caribbean, and South Asian countries and people, frequently relying on crude and \n3  derogatory stereotypes to stoke fear about immigration.  \n4  128.  In February 2018, President Trump gave a speech at the annual Conservative \n5  Political Action Conference, where he used MS-13 to disparage immigrants more generally, \n6  comparing them to snakes and animals.108 Again, in May 2018 at an immigration roundtable \n7  discussion, President Trump relied on MS-13 to claim that undocumented immigrants “aren’t \n8  people.

While studying a map of the region in preparation for a meeting with the Prime \n12  Minister of India, then- President Trump deliberately “mispronounced Nepal as ‘nipple’ and \n13  laughingly referred to Bhutan as ‘button.’”111 The President is also “known to fake an Indian \n14  accent to imitate Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during Oval Office meetings.”112 \n15  131.

On October 5, 2016, President Trump gave a speech discussing how “our country is \n2  being infiltrated . . . by terrorists,” referring to “immigrants from high-risk regions.”113 \n3  133.  In August of 2016, then-candidate Trump gave speeches lamenting that the United \n4  States is not “smart” because of the “problem [of terrorism] across our refugee and immigration \n5  programs.” President Trump used an example of “two immigrants from Pakistan who later applied \n6  for and received U.S. citizenship” and who “were sentenced to decades long prison sentences for \n7  plotting to detonate a bomb” in New York City.114  \n8  134.  On June 13, 2016, President Trump remarked how the male shooter from San \n9  Bernardino, California “was the child of immigrants from Pakistan and he brought his wife – the \n10  other terrorist – from Saudi Arabia through another one of our easily exploited visa programs.”115 \n11  He further noted that immigration from Afghanistan is increasing and that “99% of people in \n12  Afghanistan support oppressive Sharia Law. We admit many more from other countries in the \n13  region who share these same oppressive views.”116 \n14  135.  The former President’s repeated statements denigrating immigrants, including many \n15  directed at immigrants from TPS-designated countries, were not merely hateful rhetoric. They \n16  were also a call to action.  \n17  Trump Surrogates Targeted TPS Termination \n18  136.  White House officials working directly for former President Trump were keenly \n19  interested in TPS, and engaged in targeted efforts to terminate the program and TPS \n20  designations.117 High-level decision-makers at DHS were aware of this White House interest in \n21  terminating TPS.   \n \n22 \n113 Speech: Donald Trump in Reno, NV, FACTBASE, https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-\n23  speech-reno-nv-october-5-2016. \n24  114 Speech: Donald Trump in Green Bay, WI, FACTBASE, https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-\nspeech-green-bay-wi-august-5-2016. \n25  115 Remarks: Donald Trump at Saint Anselm College in Manchester NH, FACTBASE, \nhttps://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-manchester-nh-june-13-2016. \n26 \n116 Id. \n27  117 See, e.g., Nick Miroff et al., “U.S. embassy cables warned against expelling 300,000 \nimmigrants.

In a Discussion Paper prepared for the November 2017 Principals Meeting, White \n2  House officials recommended the immediate termination of TPS for four countries, even though \n3  the deadlines for TPS decisions for two of those countries were months away. The White House \n4  officials’ memo relied on the new rule to justify the terminations, which it recognized would \n5  deprive 95 percent of TPS holders of status. In the Discussion Paper, the White House officials \n6  stated: “the temporary conditions that arose out of natural disasters and supported TPS \n7  designations have long ceased to exist.”118 \n8  138.  As described above, supra ¶¶ 57-115, political appointees working directly for the \n9  President and high-ranking agency officials subverted the normal decision-making process on TPS \n10  by sidelining the work and recommendations of career staff members at DHS and repeatedly \n11  inserting themselves to influence the process to favor termination. In several instances, these \n12  officials manipulated the decision-making process by manufacturing reasoning that reflected racial \n13  animus against non-white people in order to justify the end of TPS.  \n14  139.  Subordinates of then Secretary Kelly covertly sought data on the number of TPS \n15  holders who committed crimes and relied on public assistance, despite that a single felony or two \n16  misdemeanor convictions render individuals ineligible for TPS. Gene Hamilton, who was “the \n17  lead on development of all immigration-policy issues” for President Trump’s Transition Team and \n18  subsequently worked as Senior Counselor to the DHS Secretary,119 intervened to override the \n19  research of career officials by directing his staff to collect information to emphasize the criminal \n20  histories and public benefits usage of TPS recipients from Haiti. Hamilton advised his staff to “not \n21  indicate what” such data was for when retrieving it, because he did not want the efforts to \n22  influence the TPS determination for Haiti to “turn into a big thing where people start prodding and \n23 \n24 \n \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-embassy-cables-warned-against-\n25 \nexpelling-300000-immigrants-trump-officials-did-it-anyway/2018/05/08/065e5702-4fe5-11e8-\nb966-bfb0da2dad62_story.html. \n26 \n118 ECF 122-14 (Ex. 14) at 14 (DPP_00003578). \n27  119 Jonathan Blitzer, A Trump Official Behind the End of DACA Explains Himself, THE NEW \nYORKER (Nov. 10, 2017), https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trump-official-behind-\n28 \nthe-end-of-daca-explains-himself. \n35 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 39 of 75\n \n1  things start leaking out.”120 See also supra ¶ 84 (describing Hamilton’s role revising the Federal \n2  Register Notice regarding termination of TPS for Sudan by removing examples of human rights \n3  violations).This Court previously found that “[t]he information sought by the secretary [Kelly] \n4  coincides with racial stereotypes – i.e., that non-whites commit crimes and are on the public \n5  dole.”121  \n6  140.  Similarly, Kathy Nuebel Kovarik, another member of President Trump’s transition \n7  team, and later head of policy and strategy for USCIS, fixated on replacing the work of career \n8  officials who documented conditions in Haiti with information about crimes committed by Haitian \n9  TPS recipients in the United States. She repeatedly emailed staff to request information on \n10  “crimes of any kind” committed by TPS recipients. She reminded her staff that they should “find \n11  any reports of criminal activity by any individual with TPS,” despite acknowledging that such data \n12  is “only a snapshot and not representative of the entire situation.” Kovarik explained that the data \n13  was needed so that DHS could establish a narrative of “more than ‘Haiti is really poor’ stories.”122 \n14  141.  Like former President Trump, several officials who exerted influence to ensure that \n15  DHS’s decision-making process on TPS favored termination harbored racial animus against non-\n16  white, non-Europeans. These officials were motivated by their racial animosity to intervene in and \n17  influence the TPS decision-making process towards termination. \n18  142.  For example, Stephen Miller, the senior advisor to the President who repeatedly \n19  called DHS to urge termination of TPS, see supra ¶ 58, had long expressed support for White \n20  Nationalism, “promoted white nationalist literature,” and “pushed racist immigration stories” to \n21  the media.123 Miller lauded historical immigration laws that imposed quotas based on racist \n22 \n \n23 \n120 ECF No. 122-84 (Ex. 84) at DPP_00001105. \n24  121 Ramos v.

He also sought to promote the false narrative \n3  that Muslim refugees, in particular, were highly susceptible to committing acts of terrorism.125  \n4  143.  Miller’s history of racial animus is reflected not only in his pressure campaign on \n5  DHS to terminate TPS, see supra ¶ 58, but also in his role as the architect of the former \n6  President’s Muslim-country travel bans, family separation policy, and dramatic reduction in \n7  refugee admissions.  \n8  144.  Miller’s views were embraced and lauded by other officials working for the Trump \n9  Administration who influenced the TPS decision-making process. One such official was Robert \n10  Law, who was recruited from a top position at the anti-immigrant hate group FAIR to join the \n11  Trump Administration as a Senior Adviser to USCIS. See supra ¶ 60 & n.14. Law publicly praised \n12  Miller’s influence in crafting the Trump Administration’s anti-immigrant policy agenda, \n13  remarking, “[e]very single component of it is basically what we [referring to his leadership of \n14  FAIR] have fought for, for a very long time.”126  \n15  145.  Law used his opportunity working at USCIS to implement his anti-immigrant views \n16  in the TPS determination process, including by stepping in to generate cover for the \n17  Administration to reject the advice of career officials to extend TPS for Haiti. In one instance, \n18  Law rewrote a memorandum on behalf of the USCIS Director to unequivocally support \n19  termination of TPS for Haiti.127 The memorandum had initially been drafted by a USCIS career \n20  official to analyze the evidence in favor of and against extending TPS, but Law was displeased \n21 \n \n22 \n124 Adam Serwer, Trump’s White-Nationalist Vanguard, THE ATLANTIC (November 19, 2019), \n23  https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/stephen-miller-alarming-emails/602242/ (“A \ncache of Miller’s emails. . . show Miller praising racist immigration restrictions from a century \n24  ago, while bitterly lamenting the law that repealed them.”). \n125 Nicole Narea, Stephen Miller sought to link immigrants to crime and terrorism in private \n25 \nemails to Breitbart, VOX (Nov. 25, 2019), https://www.vox.com/policy-and-\npolitics/2019/11/12/20961458/stephen-miller-white-supremacist-anti-immigrant-emails-breitbart-\n26 \nsouthern-poverty-law-center. \n27  126 Stephanie Akin, The Other ‘Steve’ in the White House, ROLL CALL (Feb. 13, 2017), \nhttps://rollcall.com/2017/02/13/the-other-steve-in-the-white-house/. \n28  127 Saget v.

John Kelly, too, has a documented history of racial animus against non-white people \n4  and immigrants. Kelly has defended the conscience of those who fought to preserve slavery during \n5  the American Civil War and lauded the honor of Confederate General Robert E. Lee.130 He \n6  lumped together the entirety of Haitian TPS-holders and referred to them categorically as “welfare \n7  recipients.”131 Kelly also publicly announced his belief that individuals who lack immigration \n8  status in the United States “don’t integrate well,” “don’t have skills,” and cannot “easily assimilate \n9  into the United States into our modern society.”132 He has also remarked that he believed many \n10  individuals without immigration status were “too lazy” to participate in the legal process.133  \n11  Racism Infected the TPS Periodic Reviews \n12  147.  The racism of President Trump and his surrogates, and their targeting of TPS for \n13  termination, was reflected in the TPS termination decisions.  \n14  148.  The motivation and methods for terminating TPS designations, including subversion \n15  of the normal agency decision-making process, reveal that the President’s documented animus \n16  against non-white, non-European immigrants, and that of his political subordinates and high-\n17  ranking agency officials infected the TPS decision-making process. \n18  149.

Acting Secretary Duke, in separate personal memos, expressed that her TPS \n4  decision-making was based on “an America first view,” a term that invoked then-President \n5  Trump’s racist views preferring immigration from majority-white European countries.  \n6  151.  Duke also wrote to White House Chief of Staff Kelly, contemporaneously with her \n7  November 2017 TPS decisions, to justify her actions as “consistent with the President’s position \n8  on immigration,” and describing them as a “strategy to get to the President’s objectives.”  \n9  152.  This Court previously found that “Acting Secretary Duke’s writing suggest that she, \n10  in her role at DHS, was largely carrying out or conforming with a predetermined presidential \n11  agenda to end TPS.”134 \n12   \n13  THIS COURT’S ORDERS HAVE PREVENTED THE TPS TERMINATIONS FROM \n14  TAKING EFFECT AND PRESERVED THE TPS STATUS OF HUNDREDS OF \n15  THOUSANDS OF TPS HOLDERS \n16 \n153.  In the wake of the initial terminations of TPS for El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and \n17 \nSudan, TPS-holder plaintiffs from those countries and their U.S.-citizen children successfully \n18 \nchallenged the legality of those decisions. On October 3, 2018, this Court granted a preliminary \n19 \ninjunction against those TPS terminations.135  \n20 \n154.  This Court concluded that the Ramos plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits \n21 \nof their claim under the Administrative Procedure Act because “a wealth of record evidence” \n22 \nshowed that, under President Trump, “DHS made a deliberate choice to base the TPS decision \n23 \nsolely on whether the originating conditions or conditions directly related thereto persisted, \n24 \n25 \n26 \n \n27 \n134 ECF No. 128 at 37. \n28  135 ECF No. 128. \n39 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 43 of 75\n \n1  regardless of other current conditions no matter how bad, and that this was a clear departure from \n2  prior administration practice.”136  \n3  155.  This Court also found that the Ramos plaintiffs had raised serious questions on the \n4  merits of their Fifth Amendment claim, which alleged that DHS’s TPS termination decisions and \n5  departures from prior practice were motivated and influenced by racial animus against non-white, \n6  non-European immigrants.137  \n7  156.  Defendants appealed this Court’s preliminary injunction order to the Ninth Circuit. \n8  The Parties in Ramos stipulated to stay further district court proceedings pending the outcome of \n9  the appeal. Pursuant to that stipulation, and in order to comply with this Court’s preliminary \n10  injunction, Defendants agreed to issue periodic Federal Register notices automatically extending \n11  TPS status and employment authorization for TPS holders from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and \n12  Sudan during the pendency of the appeal, for at least nine months at a time.  \n13  157.  After Ramos was filed but before this Court granted the preliminary injunction,138 \n14  Defendants announced the termination of TPS for Nepal and Honduras. Those decisions were \n15  made using the same flawed procedures described in Ramos and were infected by the same race-\n16  based motivation as the prior terminations.  \n17  158.  On February 10, 2019, TPS-holder plaintiffs from Nepal and Honduras and their \n18  U.S.-citizen children filed litigation challenging the terminations of TPS for those countries.139. \n19  This Court granted the Bhattarai Plaintiffs’ motion to relate Bhattarai to Ramos.   \n20  159.  After this Court granted leave to take early discovery, the Parties in Bhattarai \n21  stipulated to stay further proceedings pending the outcome of the Ramos appeal. Defendants \n22  stipulated that TPS for Nepal and Honduras would remain in effect during the pendency of the \n23 \n \n24 \n136 Id. at 19, 26. \n25  137 Id. at 2.  \n26  138 Ramos was originally filed on March 12, 2018.

On September 14, 2020, a divided panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed this Court and \n7  vacated the Ramos preliminary injunction. Plaintiffs filed a petition for rehearing en banc in \n8  response to that decision. The Ninth Circuit stayed its mandate during the pendency of that \n9  petition.  \n10  161.  Pursuant to this Court’s orders and the stipulated agreements between the Parties in \n11  Ramos and Bhattarai, Defendants have issued five Federal Register notices automatically \n12  extending TPS status and employment authorization for TPS holders protected by this Court’s \n13  orders.142 The most recent notice, published on November 16, 2022, automatically extends TPS \n14  and employment authorization for all TPS holders subject to the terminations challenged in this \n15  litigation through June 30, 2024. \n16  AFTER TAKING OFFICE, THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION EVENTUALLY MADE \n17  NEW TPS DECISIONS BUT DID NOT REPUDIATE THE TRUMP \n18  ADMINISTRATION’S ERRONEOUS INTERPRETATION OF THE TPS STATUTE \n19 \n162.  On November 3, 2020, Joseph Biden was elected President of the United States. \n20 \nDuring President Biden’s campaign, he criticized the TPS decisions that are the subject of this \n21 \nlitigation, and DHS’s new rule engineered to terminate TPS.

On November 30, 2020, the Ramos Plaintiffs filed a petition for panel rehearing and \n5  rehearing en banc. Defendants opposed Plaintiffs’ petition. \n6  164.  President Biden took office on January 20, 2021. On February 11, 2021, the Ramos \n7  Plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion to stay proceedings on their petition for rehearing, citing \n8  President Biden’s stated intention to take swift action on TPS.144 On April 19, 2021, the Ramos \n9  Plaintiffs and Defendants moved jointly to continue the stay.145   \n10  165.  The Biden Administration did not take action on TPS during the first 100 days after \n11  President Biden assumed office. \n12  166.  On June 22, 2021, the Ramos Plaintiffs and Defendants moved jointly to refer \n13  Defendants’ Ramos appeal to the Ninth Circuit Mediation program and enter a stay for the \n14  duration of mediation proceedings.146 The Ninth Circuit granted the motion on June 25, 2021.147  \n15  167.  Settlement negotiations were unsuccessful. On October 26, 2022, the Ninth Circuit \n16  released the Ramos appeal from the mediation program.148  \n17  168.

While settlement negotiations had been ongoing, DHS redesignated Haiti and Sudan \n2  for TPS. But despite doing so, DHS did not did not vacate or in any way disavow its prior \n3  termination of TPS for these countries, or the new rule by which it did so.  \n4  170.  On August 3, 2021, DHS published a Federal Register notice designating Haiti for \n5  TPS for 18 months, effective August 3, 2021 through February 3, 2023. The Federal Register \n6  notice cites human rights violations and abuses by law enforcement officials and non-state actors; \n7  serious security concerns, including violent criminal gangs; a dire economic situation, including a \n8  poverty rate of nearly 60%; a weak healthcare system suffering from “the lingering impact of the \n9  2010 earthquake and Hurricane Matthew in 2016”; and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.150 \n10  171.  On April 19, 2022, DHS published a Federal Register notice designating Sudan for \n11  TPS for 18 months, from April 19, 2022 through October 19, 2023. The Secretary explained that \n12  he had “determined that an eighteen-month designation is warranted because of the extraordinary \n13  and temporary conditions,” including ongoing armed conflict and civil unrest, political instability, \n14  flooding, droughts, widespread poverty, and “deteriorating economic conditions.”151 \n15  172.  In redesignating Haiti and Sudan for TPS, DHS required Haitian and Sudanese TPS \n16  holders to file a request for TPS as new applicants, which requires the payment of a $50 fee which \n17  does not apply to TPS holders renewing their registrations. Specifically, DHS instructed “ALL \n18  APPLICANTS” for TPS under the new TPS designations, “including individuals whose TPS \n19  under the previous designation [] has been continued” under preliminary injunctions to submit an \n20  Application for Temporary Protected Status (Form I-821) as a new applicant by “selecting ‘1.a \n21  This is my initial (first time) application for Temporary Protected Status (TPS). I do not currently \n22  have TPS,” along with the required $50 fee for Form I-821 or request for fee waiver.’”152 In \n23  contrast to initial TPS applicants, applicants re-registering for TPS are not required to pay any fee.  \n24  173.  Pursuant to DHS’s instructions, TPS holders protected by this Court’s preliminary \n25  injunction were required to pay a $50 fee to register for TPS under these new designations.

On June 13, 2023—one week before en banc oral argument in the Ramos appeal—\n5  DHS issued a Press Release announcing “the rescission of the prior Administration’s terminations \n6  of the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designations for El Salvador, Honduras, Nepal, and \n7  Nicaragua and the extension of TPS for these for countries for 18 months.” The Press Release \n8  explicitly acknowledged that “[t]oday’s actions are relevant to the litigation challenging the now-\n9  rescinded terminations.”153 \n10  175.  The next day, Defendants moved to voluntarily dismiss the Ramos appeal and \n11  remove the case from the en banc calendar, citing DHS’s new TPS decisions. The Ramos \n12  Plaintiffs opposed, arguing that the case continued to present a live controversy because \n13  Defendants had refused to disavow the position that DHS could not consider intervening \n14  conditions when making TPS decisions. \n15  176.  On June 21, 2023—one day before the en banc oral argument in the Ramos appeal—\n16  DHS published Federal Register notices announcing the rescission of the 2017 and 2018 \n17  terminations of the TPS designations of El Salvador, Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua and \n18  extending each country’s TPS designation.154 The Federal Register notices assert that DHS has \n19  “inherent authority to reconsider any TPS-related determination and, upon reconsideration, to \n20  change the determination.” Each notice explains that, “[a]fter conducting an independent \n21  assessment of the country conditions” as they existed at the time of termination and as of the \n22  present day, the Secretary determined that the country’s TPS designation “should not have been \n23  terminated” because “the conditions . . . that gave rise to [the country’s initial TPS designation] \n24  persisted in [the time of the termination decision] and persist to this day.” The notices fault the \n \n25 \n153 Press Release, DHS Rescinds Prior Administration’s Termination of Temporary Protected \n26  Status Designations for El Salvador, Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua, June 13, 2023, at \nhttps://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/dhs-rescinds-prior-administrations-termination-\n27  of-temporary-protected-status-designations-for-el. \n154 88 Fed.

On June 29, 2023, the Ninth Circuit granted Defendants’ motion to voluntarily \n4  dismiss their appeal. The Ninth Circuit did not address whether Defendants’ actions had mooted \n5  this litigation.155  \n6  178.  The June 21, 2023 Federal Register notices do not acknowledge that DHS’s newly-\n7  rescinded terminations had applied a rule that precluded the Secretary from considering \n8  intervening conditions when making TPS decisions; do not say that the TPS statute, properly \n9  interpreted, permits or requires the Secretary to consider intervening conditions when making TPS \n10  decisions; and do not recognize that the 2017 and 2018 terminations of TPS for El Salvador, \n11  Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua were unlawful (as opposed to merely wrong in their assessment \n12  of ground country conditions). \n13  179.  Although the TPS extensions for El Salvador, Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua were \n14  all announced on June 21, 2023, and although every TPS holder from those countries currently has \n15  TPS under an extension that runs until June 2024, each new extension decision states that it runs \n16  for a different 18-month period. Each one also sets a different 60-day registration period during \n17  which TPS holders from each country must re-register to maintain their TPS status. Each such \n18  period ends months before June 30, 2024, the current expiry date of their status.  \n19  180.  Since the 2021 and 2022 designation dates for Haiti and Sudan, DHS has extended \n20  and redesignated TPS for these countries. On January 26, 2023, DHS Secretary Mayorkas \n21  extended and redesignated TPS for Haiti for an 18-month period.156 On April 19, 2022, and again \n22  on August 21, 2023, DHS Secretary Mayorkas extended and redesignated TPS for Sudan for \n23  additional 18-month periods.157 In order to be protected under the new extensions, TPS holders \n24  must re-register during a designated 60-day registration period, each of which ends months before \n25  June 30, 2024, the current expiry date of their status pursuant to this Court’s injunction.  \n26   \n155 9th Cir., No. 18-16981, ECF No. 191. \n27 \n156 88 Fed. Reg. 5022 (Jan. 26, 2023).  \n28  157 87 Fed. Reg. 23,202 (Apr. 19, 2022); 88 Fed.

The current deadlines for registration—established by the June 21, 2023 Federal \n2  Register notices (for El Salvador, Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua), and the January 26, 2023 and \n3  August 21, 2023 notices for Haiti and Sudan—require TPS holders to complete re-registration \n4  long before this June 30, 2024 date. The current extension periods and re-registration dates for the \n5  six countries subject to the Trump Administration’s TPS terminations are as follows: \n6  A) El Salvador for 18 months, from September 10, 2023, through March 9, 2025 (60-\n7  day re-registration period from July 12, 2023, through September 10, 2023)158; \n8  B) Honduras for 18 months, from January 6, 2024, through July 5, 2025 (60-day re-\n9  registration period from November 6, 2023, through January 5, 2024)159; \n10  C) Nepal for 18 months, from December 25, 2023, through June 24, 2025 (60-day re-\n11  registration period from October 24, 2023, through December 23, 2023)160;  \n12  D) Nicaragua for 18 months, from January 6, 2024, through July 5, 2025 (60-day re-\n13  registration period from November 6, 2023, through January 5, 2024)161; \n14  E)  Haiti for 18 months, from February 4, 2023, through August 3, 2024 (60-day \n15  registration period for existing TPS holders ended March 27, 2023; registration for \n16  new applicants benefiting from the most recent designation, from January 26, 2023, \n17  through August 3, 2024)162; \n18  F)  Sudan for 18 months, from October 20, 2023, through April 19, 2025 (60-day \n19  registration period for existing TPS holders from August 21, 2023, through October \n20  20, 2023; registration for new applicants benefiting from the most recent \n21  designation, from August 21, 2023, through April 19, 2025).163 \n22  182.  As a result of this Court’s preliminary injunction, hundreds of thousands of TPS \n23  holders who would have been affected by DHS’s terminations have had TPS auto-extensions—\n \n24 \n158 88 Fed. Reg. 40,282 (June 21, 2023). \n25  159 Id. at 40,304. \n26  160 Id. at 40,317. \n161 Id. at 40,294. \n27 \n162 88 Fed. Reg. at 5,022‒5,023 (Jan. 26, 2023). \n28  163 88 Fed. Reg. 56,864 (Aug. 21, 2023). \n46 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 50 of 75\n \n1  with no action required on their part, and at no cost—since 2018. The latest auto-extension was \n2  established through the November 16, 2022 Federal Register notice, and guarantees TPS through \n3  June 30, 2024 for people from all six of the countries protected by this Court’s injunction.164 \n4  However, under DHS’s recently-announced decisions, for TPS holders to benefit from the new \n5  designations or extensions, they must register for TPS within the set periods of time identified \n6  above. If they fail to do so, they will lose their TPS status on July 1, 2024. \n7  183.  DHS has not proactively engaged in any individual outreach to TPS holders to \n8  provide them notice about the new requirement that they register by the dates described above in \n9  order to avoid losing status. Nor has DHS taken significant action to publicize the registration \n10  dates and their significance. For instance, certain relevant portions of the USCIS website provide a \n11  comprehensive summary of the status of TPS for those affected by the terminations. However, \n12  they do not clearly state that TPS holders must register by the new dates to avoid losing status on \n13  July 1, 2024.165  \n14  184.  The different extension and registration periods for each country, and their expiry \n15  long before the end of the current period of TPS status, have resulted in significant confusion \n16  among TPS holders protected since 2018 by this Court’s preliminary injunction. As a result, many \n17  TPS holders will inadvertently fail to re-register by the new deadlines DHS has set. \n18  DEPORTATION OF TPS HOLDERS WOULD IMPOSE \n19  EXTRAORDINARY AND IRREPARABLE HARM ON TPS HOLDERS, THEIR U.S.-\n20  CITIZEN CHILDREN, AND THEIR COMMUNITIES \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n \n25 \n164 Continuation of Documentation for Beneficiaries of TPS Designations for El Salvador, Haiti, \n26  Nicaragua, Sudan, Honduras, and Nepal, 87 Fed.

All told, approximately 400,000 TPS holders who were protected by this Court’s \n2  preliminary injunction currently reside in the United States.166 The scale of the harm wrought by \n3  Defendants’ TPS policies and practices has been truly massive. These TPS holders remain \n4  vulnerable both to future illegal terminations under DHS’s new rule and the inadvertent loss of \n5  status due to the new re-registration timelines.  \n6  186.  TPS holders have built lives in the United States over the course of years or decades, \n7  establishing roots and contributing to their communities. The circumstances of the TPS-holder \n8  Plaintiffs in this case vividly illustrate the irreparable harm that will occur if they (and other TPS \n9  holders) lose their TPS status. \n10  187.  Plaintiff Cristina Morales was born in San Miguel, El Salvador. She came to the \n11  United States from El Salvador at the age of twelve as an unaccompanied minor. Her mother had \n12  escaped domestic violence and fled to the United States before her, and Cristina followed. Cristina \n13  currently does not have family in El Salvador with whom she is in contact. Cristina’s mother \n14  advised her to apply for TPS soon after she graduated from high school, immediately after El \n15  Salvador was designated for TPS. Cristina has now lived in the United States for over thirty years \n16  and had TPS for seventeen years at the time of the termination of TPS for El Salvador. Cristina \n17  and her husband met when she was in high school, and they have been married since 2008. They \n18  have two children. Plaintiff Crista Ramos, their daughter, was fourteen years old when DHS \n19  announced the termination of TPS for El Salvador. Diego, their son, was eleven at the time. \n20  Cristina and her family have lived in San Pablo, California in a home they purchased in 2008. At \n21  the time of the termination announcement, Cristina served as the director of the extended care \n22  program at the Saint Raphael School, a private Catholic school in Marin County. At the time, \n23  Cristina struggled to complete the applications for her daughter’s high school because of the stress \n24  she experienced due to the looming expiration of TPS for El Salvador. She feared that her family \n25  would be divided, and that she would be forced to return to El Salvador where she has no family \n \n26 \n166 Robert Warren & Donald Kerwin, A Statistical and Demographic Profile of the US Temporary \n27  Protected Status Population from El Salvador, Honduras, and Haiti, 5 J.

Currently, she works as a preschool teacher in Berkely,  \n2  California and is a leader in her community. DHS’s illegal termination of TPS for El Salvador, \n3  and the failure of Secretary Mayorkas to acknowledge its unlawfulness, continues to create \n4  vulnerability for Cristina and cause her fear that she will lose her legal status, be separated from \n5  her family, and be forced to return to a country she has not been to for thirty years. \n6  188.  Plaintiff Orlando Zepeda came to the United States from his birth country of El \n7  Salvador in 1984, at the age of eighteen years old. He has lived in two homes in Los Angeles, \n8  California during his time in the United States. About twenty years ago, he and his wife, TPS \n9  holder Lorena Arana, bought the home in which they raised their two U.S. citizen children. At the \n10  time of the termination announcement, his children were twelve and fourteen years old. Orlando \n11  was granted TPS in 2001, when El Salvador was designated. For over a decade, Orlando has \n12  worked providing building maintenance, and since the announcement of the termination of TPS \n13  for El Salvador, has worked for an assisted living facility for people with Alzheimer's disease. He \n14  has also volunteered as a chaplain in prisons and hospitals for over twenty years. His family and \n15  life are in the United States, and his children and brother are U.S. citizens. He has lived in the \n16  United States for twice as long as he lived in El Salvador. He is also a leader with the National \n17  TPS Alliance, which organizes TPS holders to defend their rights. He left El Salvador in the \n18  middle of the country’s violent armed conflict and fears he would not even recognize the country \n19  now. Orlando’s employment authorization continues to depend on TPS, and he fears for what may \n20  happen if a future president attempts to once again terminate the program unlawfully. \n21  189.  Plaintiff Maria Jose Ayala Flores is the oldest daughter of TPS holder Plaintiff Elsy \n22  Yolanda Flores de Ayala and her husband Juan Amilcar Ayala Rovira. Maria was nineteen years \n23  old when DHS announced the termination of TPS for El Salvador. She arrived in the United States \n24  when she was one year old and has had TPS since she was about two years old. She discovered \n25  she had TPS only when it came time to apply for college, when she realized that her immigration \n26  status made her ineligible for many available college scholarships. Since she arrived in the United \n27  States, she has only been to El Salvador once, in 2009 for approximately one month to visit her \n28  grandmother. She graduated from high school in 2016 and at the time of the termination \n49 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 53 of 75\n \n1  announcement was a sophomore at Montgomery College in Maryland studying mathematics, \n2  hoping to teach math to elementary school students. In part due to the uncertainty of her TPS \n3  status, Maria took time off from college. She eventually returned and graduated in 2022. She \n4  currently works at a café. She has two younger siblings, Joanna Gabriela and Plaintiff Juan \n5  Eduardo. Because of the illegal termination of TPS for El Salvador in 2018, and DHS’ failure to \n6  repudiate the new rule, Maria feels vulnerable to a future termination of TPS for El Salvador on \n7  illegal grounds. \n8  190.  Plaintiff Elsy Yolanda Flores de Ayala is from El Salvador. Her father and siblings \n9  fled El Salvador during the country’s brutal civil war in the 1980s, and are now all either U.S. \n10  citizens or lawful permanent residents in the United States. As she was the youngest and unable to \n11  travel safely, she remained in El Salvador during the war. Elsy married Juan Amilcar Ayala \n12  Rovira in 2000 in El Salvador. They traveled to the United States in March 2000 with their \n13  daughter, Plaintiff Maria Jose Ayala Flores, who was one year old at the time. One year later, \n14  following the earthquakes in El Salvador and El Salvador’s TPS designation, Elsy, her husband, \n15  and their daughter obtained TPS. She now has three children. In addition to Maria, Elsy and Juan \n16  are parents to Joanna Gabriela Ayala Flores, and Plaintiff Juan Eduardo Ayala Flores, who were \n17  both born and raised in the United States. Since 2000, Elsy and her family have lived in \n18  Washington D.C. Elsy has worked as a child-care provider since 2008. This fall she will go back \n19  to school to pursue her high school equivalency certification. She has only been to El Salvador \n20  twice to visit since arriving in the United States. Elsy cannot imagine being forced to return to El \n21  Salvador and being separated from her family in the United States. \n22  191.  Plaintiff Wilna Destin was raised in Thomassique, a small township in central Haiti. \n23  She fled Haiti in 2000 to seek a better life in the United States after experiencing threats of \n24  violence in her hometown. She received TPS in 2010, following the earthquake in Haiti, and has \n25  had TPS since then. Her father is a U.S. lawful permanent resident. She also has two brothers in \n26  the United States. One is a U.S. citizen and the other has TPS. She is married to a TPS holder and \n27  is the mother of two U.S. citizen children, Plaintiff Hnaida Cenemet and her younger brother John \n28  Walker. Her children were fourteen and ten years old at the time of the termination announcement \n50 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 54 of 75\n \n1  for Haiti. At that time, Wilna worked as a labor organizer with the union UNITE-HERE. She also \n2  previously worked at Disney World, and more recently started her own small business. Wilna has \n3  lived in Florida for over twenty years. For the last fourteen years she has owned a home in \n4  Orlando, which she shares with her family. She is an active member of her community and \n5  church, and volunteered to travel to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina to support the \n6  humanitarian relief efforts and help with the cleanup. Wilna must actively work to counteract the \n7  stress and uncertainty of the future of TPS for Haiti, in light of the Trump Administration’s illegal \n8  termination of TPS, and the Biden Administration’s failure to repudiate it. Her husband, also a \n9  Haitian TPS-holder, continues to experience stress-related health symptoms such as headaches and \n10  anxiety, due to the family’s ongoing uncertainty about the future of TPS for Haiti. \n11  192.  Plaintiff Sherika Blanc was born in Port de Paix, Haiti, and immigrated to the United \n12  States with her parents and two brothers when she was eight years old. Sherika discovered that she \n13  was then undocumented only when she graduated from high school in 2009 and realized that she \n14  could not apply for financial aid to go to college because of her immigration status. In 2010, soon \n15  after she graduated from high school, Haiti was designated for TPS. Sherika applied shortly \n16  thereafter, and has had either TPS or DACA since 2010. Her TPS status has changed her life by \n17  giving her the opportunity to work, buy a car, rent a house, and raise a family. Her parents and her \n18  two brothers have all had TPS since 2010. Because she could not go to university when she \n19  graduated from high school, Sherika trained successfully to become a certified nursing assistant \n20  (“CNA”) and a health unit coordinator (“HUC”), and received her license in 2011. At the time \n21  DHS announced the termination of TPS for Haiti, Sherika worked as a nursing assistant and HUC \n22  at the South Florida Baptist Hospital, in Plant City, Florida. She continues to work in the \n23  healthcare industry. She has three young daughters: Plaintiff Rilya Salary, and her younger sisters \n24  Alaya and Almara. Her daughters were five, three and under one years old at the time of the \n25  termination announcement. Sherika is currently pregnant and resides with her daughters in \n26  Lexington, Kentucky. Sherika is a primary financial support for her daughters and depends on \n27  TPS for her work authorization, and ability to support her family. She fears for a future where \n28 \n51 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 55 of 75\n \n1  another president could terminate TPS for Haiti in an instant, just like DHS attempted to do in \n2  2018. \n3  193.  Plaintiff Imara Ampie was born and raised in Managua, Nicaragua. In August 1998, \n4  at the age of twenty-six years old, Imara traveled to the United States to procure material for her \n5  mother’s tailoring business. While she was in the United States, Nicaragua was devastated by \n6  Hurricane Mitch and the U.S. government designated Nicaragua for TPS. She has had TPS since \n7  then, and lived in the Bay Area for almost all that time. She and her family have owned a home in \n8  Contra Costa County in northern California since 2010. Imara is married to a Nicaraguan TPS \n9  holder, and they are raising two sons with disabilities that require a high level of attention and \n10  care. Imara is a homemaker and the primary caregiver to her two sons. Her husband has also been \n11  battling a long-time fight with lung cancer. Imara continues to be concerned that if TPS for \n12  Nicaragua is terminated, she and her husband may be forced to return to Nicaragua even though \n13  their lives and family are here, and there will be inadequate options to satisfy the health care and \n14  educational needs for her family. She relies on in-home support services from public agencies, and \n15  she continues to worry about the future because she fears that she would be unable to access these \n16  services if she were to lose lawful immigration status due to the termination of TPS for Nicaragua. \n17  Her children would suffer if forced to relocate to Nicaragua, but particularly because of their \n18  disabilities, would also face tremendous obstacles if forced to remain in the United States without \n19  their parents. \n20  194.  Plaintiff Mazin Ahmed, came to the United States with his mother and two younger \n21  siblings in 2012, and all had TPS starting in 2013. Mazin is Sudanese and was born in Sudan, but \n22  lived in Qatar with his parents and siblings from 1997 until 2012. He was a baby when he and his \n23  family moved from Sudan to Qatar, and left Qatar for the United States with his mother and \n24  siblings when he was fourteen years old. Mazin arrived in the United States in time to start high \n25  school, and graduated with honors from Westbrook High School, in Westbrook, Maine where he \n26  has lived since he arrived. At the time that DHS announced the termination of TPS for Sudan, \n27  Mazin was a sophomore majoring in Human Biology at the University of Southern Maine, where \n28  he was the recipient of a merit-based President’s Scholar Award. He does not believe that he could \n52 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 56 of 75\n \n1  safely return to Sudan, has no right to return to Qatar, and has built a community and excelled in \n2  his studies in the United States. Mazin recently adjusted his status to become a lawful permanent \n3  resident but still suffers stigmatic harm from the racism that motivated the Trump-era termination \n4  announcement and the intended termination of TPS for Sudan.   \n5  195.  Plaintiff Hiwaida Elarabi, is from Sudan but has lived in the United States since \n6  1997 when she arrived with a visitor’s visa to visit her aunt and her family—all of whom are now \n7  U.S. citizens. During the time that Hiwaida was in the United States, the security situation \n8  deteriorated in Sudan, which was in the midst of a decades-long conflict. Before the expiration of \n9  her visitor’s visa, the U.S. government designated Sudan for TPS and Hiwaida remained because \n10  she could not safely return. She has now lived in the United States for over twenty-five years, with \n11  her aunt’s family. She has a Bachelor’s degree in biochemistry from before she arrived in the \n12  United States, and a Master’s degree in Bioinformatics from Brandeis University. She lives in \n13  Newton, Massachusetts and works as a Data Analyst at Western Governors University, where she \n14  has worked since before the announcement of the termination of TPS for Sudan. Prior to that, she \n15  worked for sixteen years as a Health Educator at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. \n16  Hiwaida is also an entrepreneur who opened up a restaurant in 2015. She took on extensive debt to \n17  do so, and suffered from the termination of TPS. While the restaurant was doing well in its early \n18  years, she made the difficult decision to sell it, at great cost, after Defendants terminated TPS. She \n19  felt that her future was uncertain and she did not know whether she would be able to sustain the \n20  restaurant. Hiwaida recently adjusted her status to become a lawful permanent resident but still \n21  suffers stigmatic harm from the racism that motivated the Trump-era termination announcement \n22  and the intended termination of TPS for Sudan. She is also an advocate with African Communities \n23  Together and member of the National TPS Alliance, and concerned about the vulnerability of TPS \n24  for her community in light of the prior TPS terminations, and the refusal of DHS to repudiate \n25  them. \n26  196.  Plaintiff Salma Ahmed was born in Sudan and moved to the United States as a baby. \n27  She has had TPS since she was about two or three years old. She has lived in Chicago, Illinois \n28  since she was about ten years old. Salma learned that she had TPS when she was in middle school, \n53 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 57 of 75\n \n1  and was twenty years old when the termination of TPS for Sudan was announced. Salma \n2  graduated with honors from Lane Tech College Prep High School in 2016. As a high school \n3  student, she was accepted at various four-year colleges, including Loyola University Chicago. \n4  However, due to the limited financial aid available because of her immigration status, and her \n5  family’s limited income, she was not able to attend any of them. At the time of the termination \n6  announcement, Salma was enrolled in Harold Washington Community College. She was close to \n7  completing her coursework and transitioning to a four-year program. The termination \n8  announcement made it almost impossible to plan for her future. It called into question her plans to \n9  travel out of state for an internship, to purchase a car, to obtain a credit card, and to pursue a four-\n10  year degree. Salma graduated in 2022 with a degree in biochemistry from Dominican University. \n11  She is now working as a medical laboratory technician and planning to pursue a graduate degree \n12  to become a physician’s assistant. Salma has only been back to Sudan for a few short visits, during \n13  which she struggled to communicate comfortably with people, including close family members, \n14  because she does not speak Arabic fluently. She has not registered for TPS for Sudan under the \n15  new designations or extensions because she was not aware she had to. She carries the November \n16  2022 Federal Register notice in her wallet and believed that was sufficient to maintain her TPS \n17  status. Salma fears that because of the lack of confirmation about the illegality of prior \n18  terminations, she could still be vulnerable to an illegal termination of her status in the future. This \n19  would affect her ability to work, drive, and remain legally in the United States, the country she has \n20  lived in for the vast majority of her life and the only home she has ever known. \n21  197.  Plaintiff Keshav Raj Bhattarai was born in Nepal. Keshav’s home was significantly \n22  damaged in the April 2015 earthquake, and he and his wife had to sleep outside in a tent for about \n23  a month. In May 2015, Keshav and his wife traveled to the United States to see their son graduate \n24  from his medical fellowship program. About a month later, Nepal was designated for TPS and \n25  Keshav and his wife successfully applied for TPS status. Since receiving TPS, Keshav has worked \n26  in restaurants and gas stations. Keshav lives in Sunnyvale, California, and works as a manager at a \n27  Chevron gas station, where he has lived and worked since the announcement of the termination of \n28  TPS for Nepal. His son is a doctor, trained in geriatrics and nephrology, and has lived and \n54 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 58 of 75\n \n1  practiced in the United States for over ten years. He fears for what may happen to him, his family, \n2  and his Nepali community in the future if TPS for Nepal were to be terminated again on illegal \n3  grounds.  \n4  198.  Plaintiff Sajjan Pandey was born in Nepal, and before arriving in the United States, \n5  ran a restaurant and technical school there. Sajjan arrived in the United States in 2006, and has \n6  lived here ever since. He lives with his cousin, who is a U.S. citizen, in Alameda, California. He is \n7  an attendant and cashier at a Chevron gas station in Oakland, California. TPS is essential to his \n8  ability to work and support himself. He regularly sends money back to Nepal to help family \n9  members whose homes were damaged after the earthquake. Additionally, for over fifteen years \n10  Sajjan has been an active volunteer and leader of Motherland Nepal, a nonprofit cultural \n11  organization based in the Bay Area that creates cultural programming and fundraises for people in \n12  need. He fears what could happen if a new president were to decide to again terminate TPS for \n13  Nepal on illegal grounds as he relies on TPS for work authorization.  \n14  199.  Plaintiff Sumnima Thapa was born in Nepal and arrived in the United States in \n15  2002. She spent most of her childhood in Thailand, where she moved with her family at the age of \n16  four. Sumnima obtained her bachelor’s degree in business management and her master’s degree in \n17  project management. At the time of the termination announcement, she worked as a research \n18  specialist at Omni Data Retrieval, and she also previously volunteered with Lutheran Social \n19  Services. She now works as a project coordinator for clinical trial projects. At the time of the \n20  termination announcement, Sumnima lived in Apple Valley, Minnesota with her husband, also a \n21  TPS holder, and their two U.S.-citizen children, who were then aged six and ten. Her sons are now \n22  eleven and fifteen. The eldest is Plaintiff S.S. and he is now starting tenth grade. Her youngest son \n23  has only been to Nepal once, and her eldest son has visited Nepal only three times, once as an \n24  infant. Neither of Sumnima’s sons speak Nepali fluently. Sumnima and her family continue to live \n25  in Apple Valley, Minnesota where she and her husband own their home. Without TPS Sumnima \n26  will be unable to work and will have difficulty paying her mortgage. Sumnima and her husband \n27  continue to worry about a future illegal termination of TPS for Nepal because they depend on TPS \n28 \n55 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 59 of 75\n \n1  for work authorization and their children depend on them entirely for financial, emotional and \n2  material support. \n3  200.  Plaintiff Donaldo Posadas Caceres was born in Honduras. When he was young, his \n4  brother was murdered in Honduras, leading Donaldo to drop out of school for his protection and \n5  move to another city. He, his wife, and his eldest son, who was then a baby, entered the United \n6  States in July 1998. They have held TPS since 1999. Donaldo has worked as a bridge painter and \n7  is a member of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades (IUPAT), since the time of \n8  the announcement of the termination of TPS for Honduras. He owns his home in Baltimore, \n9  Maryland, where he lives with his wife and children. In addition to their eldest son, Donaldo and \n10  his wife have two U.S.-citizen daughters, who were aged eighteen and nine at the time of the \n11  termination announcement. His eldest daughter has been to Honduras only once, to visit her ailing \n12  grandfather, and his youngest daughter only twice, to visit her ailing grandfather and to attend a \n13  family member’s funeral. Donaldo continues to fear the illegal termination of TPS for Honduras \n14  as he is dependent on TPS for work authorization and his legal status in the United States, as well \n15  as the opportunity to keep his family together. \n16  201.  Plaintiff Sorayda Betzabe Rodriguez Motiño was born in Honduras, where she was \n17  raised by her grandmother from a young age. A few days after Sorayda turned sixteen, she and her \n18  siblings came to the United States to look for their mother. They arrived at a port of entry on or \n19  around Christmas Eve of 1998 and Sorayda was placed in a shelter for unaccompanied minors. \n20  About two weeks later, Honduras was designated for TPS and Sorayda was released to her \n21  mother. She has held TPS ever since. Sorayda lives in Harrisonburg, Virginia with her husband, \n22  also a TPS holder, and two U.S. citizen children. Her eldest child is autistic and continues to live \n23  with his parents, who provide a critical level of support and assistance to him. At the time of the \n24  termination announcement, Sorayda worked at Great Eastern Resort as a supervisor of \n25  housekeeping. Today she works at the same resort as the manager of the housekeeping department \n26  for the hotel. Sorayda is concerned about a future termination of TPS on illegal grounds. Sorayda \n27  is terrified at the thought of losing her status and having to bring her children to Honduras, a place \n28  they have never been. Her children do not speak Spanish. \n56 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 60 of 75\n \n1  202.  Plaintiff Denis Alen Molina Chavez was born in Honduras. He entered the United \n2  States in July 1997 and has had TPS since 1999. After a short time in New Jersey, he settled in \n3  Bridgeport, Connecticut, where he lived until moving to Shelton, Connecticut in 2019. At the time \n4  that DHS announced termination of TPS for Honduras, Denis was a widow and the single father \n5  of two U.S.-citizen children, a son aged thirteen- at the time and a daughter aged twelve at the \n6  time. Denis’s wife passed away in 2013 from ovarian cancer. Denis is the lead pastor at the \n7  Church of Jude Mount Zion (Iglesia de Juda Monte de Sion) in Bridgeport, which has thirty-one \n8  active members. He gives sermons and provides religious teaching for children and youth. Denis \n9  has been a pastor for more than twenty years, and has been an active member of the church since \n10  he was a child. Denis also works as a mechanic at Service My Auto in Bridgeport, where he has \n11  been employed for over a decade. Denis is very worried about what will happen to his life and the \n12  lives of his children if TPS is terminated again, as the 2018 announcement of the termination of \n13  TPS for Honduras caused an high level of emotional and physiological stress and anxiety for him \n14  and his family. Denis is a homeowner; he relies on TPS to afford his mortgage, pay for the \n15  children’s necessities, work, and serve as a pastor. Connecticut is the only home his children have \n16  ever known. Denis’ children have only been to Honduras once.  \n17  203.  At the time of the termination announcements, it was estimated that TPS holders \n18  were the parents of more than 270,000 U.S.-citizen children.167 The U.S. citizen children of TPS \n19  holders, including the Plaintiff children in this case, confront an impossible choice if TPS is \n20  terminated. On one hand, they can continue to live with their parents, but only by relocating to a \n21  foreign country, leaving behind their schools, their communities, and the benefits of living in the \n22  United States—the only country they have ever known. On the other hand, they can choose to \n23  remain in the United States, but then must give up living with one or both parents, which in many \n24  cases would involve their becoming a ward of the state subject to foster care, or otherwise subject \n25  to the supervision of persons who are not their parents. \n26 \n27 \n \n28  167 Warren & Kerwin, supra note 166, at 578. \n57 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 61 of 75\n \n1  204.  Plaintiff Crista Ramos is the eldest child of TPS holder Plaintiff Cristina Morales. \n2  She was fourteen years old at the time DHS announced the termination of TPS for El Salvador. \n3  Crista was born in Marin, California, and was an eighth grade student at Saint Raphael School at \n4  the time of the termination announcement. At the time she was applying to high school and \n5  dreaming of being an immigration lawyer. She lived with her mother, father, and her then eleven-\n6  year-old brother Diego in San Pablo, California. She continues to reside in California and attends \n7  University of San Francisco. Crista continues to suffer stigmatic harm from the racism that \n8  motivated the Trump-era termination announcement and further worries about what will happen if \n9  her mother loses her TPS status and is deported.  \n10  205.  Plaintiff Benjamin Zepeda is the eldest child of TPS holder Plaintiff Orlando Zepeda \n11  and TPS holder Lorena Arana. He was fourteen years old at the time DHS announced the \n12  termination of TPS for El Salvador. Benjamin was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, and \n13  at the time of the termination announcement was a ninth grade student at St. John Bosco High \n14  School. He has a younger sister, Lizbeth, who was then twelve years old. He is currently working \n15  and planning to return to college, which he began after graduating from high school. His sister \n16  graduated high school and enrolled at Cerritos College. Benjamin and his sister depend on their \n17  parents for emotional, psychological, educational, spiritual, and material support. He has never \n18  visited El Salvador and cannot imagine moving there. He continues to suffer stigmatic harm from \n19  the racism that motivated the DHS termination decisions, and also struggles to consider how much \n20  his life would be upended if his parents lost their TPS status and did not have documentation in \n21  the United States, moved to El Salvador, or were deported there. \n22  206.  Plaintiff Juan Eduardo Ayala Flores is the youngest son of TPS holder Plaintiff Elsy \n23  Yolanda Flores de Ayala and TPS holder Juan Amilcar Ayala Rovira. He was thirteen years old \n24  when DHS announced the termination of TPS for El Salvador. He has two older sisters, TPS \n25  holder Plaintiff Maria Jose Ayala Flores and Joanna Gabriela Ayala Flores, who was born in \n26  Washington, D.C. Juan was a seventh grade student at Washington Latin Public Charter School at \n27  the time of the termination announcement. He is now about to begin an undergraduate degree at \n28  George Washington University, from which his sister Joanna just graduated. Juan’s parents are \n58 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 62 of 75\n \n1  from El Salvador, but he has only been to El Salvador twice, to visit family. He was born in \n2  Washington, D.C., and has lived there his entire life. Juan’s parents continue to provide him with \n3  economic support and emotional guidance. He continues to suffer stigmatic harm from the racism \n4  that motivated the DHS termination decisions, and worries about what could happen to his sister, \n5  who still has TPS and has no pathway to permanent status, if DHS were to again terminate TPS \n6  for El Salvador on the same illegal grounds it utilized in 2018. \n7  207.  Plaintiff Hnaida Cenemat is the eldest child of TPS holder Plaintiff Wilna Destin, \n8  who was raised in Haiti and has lived in the United States for eighteen years. Hnaida was fourteen \n9  years old when DHS announced the termination of TPS for Haiti. Hnaida’s younger brother, John, \n10  was just ten years old. Hnaida was born in Orlando, Florida, and has lived there her entire life. She \n11  visited Haiti only once for a brief period when she was one year old. At the time of the termination \n12  announcement, Hnaida was a motivated high school freshman at Dr. Phillips High School. She \n13  aspired to become an obstetrician/gynecologist because she wanted to help people. Prior to \n14  Defendants’ decision to end TPS, Hnaida did not understand that it was a legal status that could be \n15  terminated. She was afraid of moving to Haiti with her mother and living in a country that she did \n16  not know, but she was also afraid of remaining in the United States with a foster family. She, her \n17  brother, and their parents spent a lot of time speaking about TPS. In 2021, Hnaida graduated from \n18  high school and went on to obtain her real estate license. She now works as a real estate agent and \n19  lives independently. She continues to suffer stigmatic harm from the racism that motivated the \n20  DHS termination decisions, and worries about her parents losing their immigration status.   \n21  208.  Plaintiff Rilya Salary was born in Rockledge, Florida and is the eldest child of TPS \n22  holder Plaintiff Sherika Blanc. Rilya was just five years old when DHS announced the termination \n23  of TPS for Haiti. Rilya has never been to Haiti. She has two younger sisters who were three and \n24  one years old at the time of the termination announcement. Rilya is now in sixth grade in \n25  Lexington, Kentucky where she enjoys going to classes and participating in band. Rilya depends \n26  on her mother for economic support and emotional care and guidance. Rilya would also suffer \n27  hardship if TPS were once again to be illegally terminated because her mother relies on TPS for \n28  work authorization and her ability to support and maintain her family. And, like the other U.S. \n59 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 63 of 75\n \n1  citizen children of TPS holders, Rilya would suffer harm from the impossible choice she would \n2  have to make between living with her mother and living in her country, should her mother lose her \n3  status. \n4  209.  Plaintiff S.S. is the eldest son of TPS holder Plaintiff Sumnima Thapa and her \n5  husband. S.S. was ten years old at the time that DHS announced the termination of TPS for Nepal. \n6  S.S. was born in Minnesota, where he continues to live with his parents and younger brother. At \n7  the time of the termination announcement, S.S. was in fifth grade. Today, S.S. is in tenth grade \n8  and enjoys swimming, tennis, jiu jitsu and theatre. He is also interested in IT and enjoys practicing \n9  coding. A future illegal termination of TPS for Nepal would be devastating for S.S. who is in the \n10  middle of a promising high school education.  \n11  210.  Plaintiff G.D.P. is the youngest daughter of TPS holder Plaintiff Donaldo Posadas \n12  Caceres. At the time that DHS announced the termination of TPS for Honduras, G.D.P was nine \n13  years old. She was born in Maryland, and continues to live there with her parents and older \n14  siblings. At the time of the termination announcement, G.D.P dreamed of growing up to be \n15  President because she wants to help people who come here from other countries. G.D.P is now \n16  starting high school, and enjoys school and sports.  \n17  211.  TPS holders are an integral part of the economic and social fabric of American \n18  communities, and they give back to this country in countless ways. They are active in civic life \n19  and volunteer at schools, neighborhood and work organizations, and religious institutions.168 They \n20  pay federal, state, and local taxes, and support government social welfare programs. A 2023 report \n21  estimates that the over 500,000 TPS holders living in the United States contribute $12.8 billion \n22  dollars annually to the US economy.169 The net positive economic contributions of TPS holders \n23  are not surprising in light of their consistently high employment rate. For example, eighty-five \n24  percent of Honduran TPS holders are employed. About seventeen percent are entrepreneurs, \n25 \n \n26  168 CELIA MEJÍVAR, CTR. FOR MIGRATION RES., UNIV. OF KAN., TEMP.

Individual Plaintiffs seek to represent the following nationwide class: The U.S. \n2  citizen children, from ages five to eighteen, of all TPS holders from El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, \n3  Nepal, Nicaragua, and Sudan. \n4  215.  The proposed class satisfies the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n5  23(a)(1) because it is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. \n6  216.  On information and belief, there are tens of thousands of U.S. citizen children of \n7  TPS holders from El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, and Sudan. Given the dates of \n8  TPS designations for those countries, thousands of those children are from ages five to eighteen \n9  confronted with the possibility of losing either the ability to live in their country or the care and \n10  support of a TPS-holder parent. \n11  217.  Due to the actions of Defendants, the U.S. citizen children of TPS holders will be \n12  forced to choose between their absolute and fundamental due process right to reside in this \n13  country, and their due process right to the care and support of their parents. \n14  218.  The class meets the commonality requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n15  23(a)(2). Members of the class are subject to a common practice or policy: Defendants’ adoption \n16  of a new rule that caused the termination of the TPS designations for their parents’ respective \n17  countries without any consideration of the impact on the class members—i.e., these U.S. citizen \n18  children—or any valid reason justifying the harm that decision imposes on them. When the TPS \n19  terminations were issued, these children were forced by law to choose between their right to reside \n20  in this country as citizens, and their right to reside with their parents. Whether the Due Process \n21  Clause permits the government to force these children into that choice presents a common legal \n22  question, resolution of which will greatly aid the efficient resolution of this case. \n23  219.  The proposed class meets the typicality requirements of Federal Rule of Civil \n24  Procedure 23(a)(3) because the claims of the representative Individual Plaintiffs are typical of the \n25  claims of their class. Individual Plaintiffs and the proposed Citizen-Children Class members are \n26  the school-aged children, from ages five to eighteen, who are U.S. citizens. Their parents will be \n27  subject to removal once the TPS termination decisions take effect. Individual Plaintiffs and their \n28 \n62 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 66 of 75\n \n1  proposed class also share the same legal claims, which challenge the legality of these termination \n2  policies and practices under the Fifth Amendment. \n3  220.  The proposed class meets the adequacy requirements of Federal Rule of Civil \n4  Procedure 23(a)(4). Individual Plaintiffs seek the same relief as the other members of the class. In \n5  defending their own rights, Individual Plaintiffs will defend the rights of all proposed class \n6  members fairly and adequately. \n7  221.  Additionally, the proposed class is represented by pro bono counsel from the \n8  American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, the American Civil Liberties Union of \n9  Southern California, Unemployed Workers United, the UCLA Law School Center for \n10  Immigration Law and Policy, and Sidley Austin LLP. Plaintiffs’ counsel have extensive \n11  experience litigating class action lawsuits and other complex cases in federal court, including civil \n12  rights lawsuits on behalf of non-citizens. \n13  222.  The members of the class are readily ascertainable through Defendants’ records. \n14  223.  Finally, the proposed class satisfies Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(1)(A) and \n15  (b)(2). Competing rulings as to whether Defendants must permit the TPS-holding parents of U.S. \n16  citizen children to reside in the United States could create inconsistent adjudications and establish \n17  incompatible standards of conduct governing Defendants’ behavior. In addition, Defendants have \n18  acted on grounds that are generally applicable to the class by terminating the TPS designations for \n19  El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, and Sudan without considering the massive harm \n20  that decision causes to U.S. citizen children or providing reasons to justify that harm. Thus, final \n21  injunctive and declaratory relief is appropriate for the class as a whole. \n22  CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n23  FIRST CLAIM \n24  Violation of the Equal Protection Guarantee of the  \n25  Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment \n26  (Against All Defendants by All Plaintiffs) \n27  224.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained \n28  in the preceding paragraphs. \n63 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 67 of 75\n \n1  225.  The Fifth Amendment contains an implicit guarantee of equal protection that \n2  invalidates any official action that in part reflects a racially discriminatory intent or purpose. \n3  Classifications based on race or national origin receive exacting scrutiny, and even facially neutral \n4  policies and practices will be held unconstitutional when they reflect a pattern unexplainable on \n5  grounds other than race. Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499 (1954); Vill. of Arlington Heights v. \n6  Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265–66 (1977). \n7  226.  Defendants’ decisions to terminate the TPS designations for El Salvador, Haiti, \n8  Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, and Sudan are unconstitutional because they were motivated, at least \n9  in part, by intentional discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or national origin. \n10  227.  Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury resulting from the arbitrary termination of the \n11  TPS designations. Although the TPS termination decisions for El Salvador, Honduras, Nepal, and \n12  Nicaragua themselves are now rescinded, and there are new TPS designations for Haiti and Sudan, \n13  Plaintiffs continue to suffer stigmatic harm from the racial animus that motivated the terminations \n14  and Defendants’ failure to repudiate them. \n15  SECOND CLAIM \n16  Violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment \n17  (Against All Defendants by All TPS-Holder Plaintiffs) \n18  228.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained \n19  in the preceding paragraphs. \n20  229.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides \n21  that “[n]o person shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” \n22  U.S. Const. amend. V.  \n23  230.  Due process protections extend to “all ‘persons’ within the United States, including \n24  [non-citizens], whether their presence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or permanent.” \n25  Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 693 (2001). TPS holders are lawfully present in this country. \n26  They have significant liberty interests, protected by the Due Process Clause, in a non-arbitrary \n27  decision as to the continuation of their TPS status. \n28 \n64 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 68 of 75\n \n1  231.  The “very essence” of due process is the “protection of the individual against \n2  arbitrary action.” Bd. of Regents of State Colls. v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 584 (1972). Any \n3  deprivation of liberty or property interests must, at the very least, pass a test of rationality. The \n4  burden on the government is greater when, as here, the liberty interests at stake derive from well-\n5  established and significant reliance interests. \n6  232.  The government has not articulated, and cannot establish, any rational basis for \n7  reversing course on decades of established TPS policy and ignoring the current capability of TPS \n8  countries to safely receive longtime TPS holders, their families, and their U.S. citizen children. \n9  233.  Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury resulting from the arbitrary termination of the \n10  TPS designations.  \n11  THIRD CLAIM \n12  Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act \n13  (Against All Defendants by All TPS-Holder Plaintiffs) \n14  234.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained \n15  in the preceding paragraphs. \n16  235.  The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 551 et seq., ensures that federal \n17  agencies are accountable to the public by providing a “right of review” to any “person suffering \n18  legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action.” 5 \n19  U.S.C. § 702. Judicial review is generally limited to “final agency action for which there is no \n20  other adequate remedy in a court.” 5 U.S.C. § 704. \n21  236.  Among other things, the APA empowers the federal courts to “hold unlawful and set \n22  aside agency actions, finding, and conclusions” that are “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \n23  discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). The right of review \n24  under the APA includes a right to judicial review of “executive agency action for procedural \n25  correctness.” FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 513 (2009).   \n26  237.  To engage in procedurally appropriate decision-making, an agency must ordinarily \n27  “display awareness that it is changing position,” and may not “depart from a prior policy sub \n28  silentio.” Id. at 515. The APA requires an agency to provide “more detailed justification” when \n65 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 69 of 75\n \n1  “its new policy rests upon factual findings that contradict those which underlay its prior policy,” \n2  or “its prior policy has engendered serious reliance interests.” Id. \n3  238.  Defendants’ termination of the TPS designations for El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, \n4  Nepal, Nicaragua, and Sudan constitutes “final agency action for which there is no other adequate \n5  remedy in a court” pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 704, because the Defendants’ termination results in the \n6  TPS holders’ loss of TPS “automatically and without further notice or right of appeal,” 8 C.F.R. \n7  § 244.19. \n8  239.  Defendants’ adoption of a new, drastically narrower interpretation of the TPS statute \n9  was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law in violation of the APA because it represented a \n10  sudden and unexplained departure from decades of decision-making practices and ordinary \n11  procedures. By shifting the decision-governing standard for country designations without \n12  explanation, Defendants have ignored a clear statutory command and engaged in procedurally \n13  flawed decision-making. Further, Defendants changed their policy without taking into account the \n14  serious reliance interests that their prior policy had engendered. \n15  240.  Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury resulting from the arbitrary termination of the \n16  TPS designations, and Defendants’ continued failure to repudiate the narrow interpretation of the \n17  TPS statute they previously adopted without explanation. \n18  FOURTH CLAIM \n19  Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act \n20  (Against All Defendants by All TPS-Holder Plaintiffs) \n21  241.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every \n22  allegation contained in the preceding paragraphs. \n23  242.  Defendants’ interpretation of the TPS statute to preclude consideration of \n24  intervening events was “not in accordance with law,” in violation of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) because \n25  the TPS statute does not prohibit the Secretary from considering intervening events when \n26  determining whether to extend TPS. \n27 \n28 \n66 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 70 of 75\n \n1  243.  Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury resulting from the legally erroneous \n2  termination of the TPS designations, and face the possibility of future injury from Defendants’ \n3  failure to repudiate the legally erroneous interpretation they previously adopted. \n4  FIFTH CLAIM \n5  Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act \n6  (Against All Defendants by All TPS-Holder Plaintiffs) \n7  244.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained \n8  in the preceding paragraphs. \n9  245.  Defendants’ decision to impose re-registration deadlines that expire long before the \n10  current TPS extensions expire, contrary to all historical practice in the administration of TPS, was \n11  “arbitrary, capricious, [and] an abuse of discretion” in violation of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n12  246.  Due to these arbitrary and capricious registration deadlines, Plaintiffs will suffer \n13  irreparable injury, and many thousands of TPS holders will be deprived of TPS status for which \n14  they are otherwise eligible.  \n15  SIXTH CLAIM \n16  Violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment \n17  (Against All Defendants by All TPS-Holder Plaintiffs) \n18  247.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained \n19  in the preceding paragraphs. \n20  248.  Defendants’ adoption of re-registration deadlines that expire long before the current \n21  TPS extensions expire is so lacking in justification and contrary to past practice that it fails to \n22  satisfy the rationality constraints imposed by the Fifth Amendment on governmental decision-\n23  making in this context. \n24  249.  Due to these arbitrary and capricious registration deadlines, Plaintiffs will suffer \n25  irreparable injury, and many thousands of TPS holders will be deprived of TPS status for which \n26  they are otherwise eligible. \n27  SEVENTH CLAIM \n28  Violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment \n67 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 71 of 75\n \n1  (Against All Defendants by All U.S. Citizen Children Plaintiffs) \n2  250.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained \n3  in the preceding paragraphs. \n4  251.  The Fifth Amendment guarantee against the deprivation of liberty without due \n5  process bars the government from infringing on certain “fundamental” liberty interests, regardless \n6  of the procedures involved, unless the action is “narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state \n7  interest.” Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 301–02 (1993). \n8  252.  Three such fundamental rights are implicated here. First, the plaintiffs here who are \n9  school-aged U.S. citizens have an absolute right to live in the United States. To compel them to \n10  live abroad at any time, let alone in their formative years, would deny them a core aspect of their \n11  liberty protected by the Fifth Amendment. See, e.g., Nguyen v. I.N.S., 533 U.S. 53, 67 (2001); Ng \n12  Fung Ho v. White, 259 U.S. 276, 284 (1922). \n13  253.  Second, for at least so long as these U.S. citizen plaintiffs remain school-aged, they \n14  have a fundamental right protected by both the First and Fifth Amendments to live with and be \n15  raised by their parents. E.g., Moore v. City of East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 499 (1977); Board of \n16  Dirs.of Rotary Intern. v. Rotary Club, 481 U.S. 537, 545 (1987). \n17  254.  Third, the government’s decision to end the lawful immigration status of their \n18  parents impinges upon the U.S. citizen plaintiffs’ constitutionally-protected liberty interests. These \n19  U.S. citizen children have a powerful interest in not being compelled to choose between two \n20  alternatives when each alternative will deprive them of a substantial, constitutionally-protected \n21  aspect of liberty. See United States v. Jackson, 390 U.S. 570 (1968); cf. New York v. United States, \n22  505 U.S. 144, 176 (1992). \n23  255.  In invading these fundamental constitutional rights, Defendants have articulated no \n24  substantial governmental interest and have failed adequately to tailor their action to promote any \n25  legitimate interest they may have. Nowhere in the notices terminating the TPS designations for El \n26  Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, and Sudan, for example, have Defendants identified \n27  any risk to the interests of the United States that would follow from allowing the school-aged U.S. \n28 \n68 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 72 of 75\n \n1  citizen children to remain in the United States with their TPS holder parents until the children \n2  reach the age of majority. \n3  256.  Similarly, nowhere in the notices terminating the TPS designations for El Salvador, \n4  Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, and Sudan has the Secretary adequately explained the \n5  Secretary’s new interpretation of the governing statute, reconciled it with the Secretary’s \n6  longstanding prior interpretation, or justified its extraordinary invasion of the U.S. citizen \n7  children’s constitutional rights. \n8  257.  Plaintiffs and Individual Plaintiffs’ class will suffer irreparable injury resulting from \n9  the termination of the TPS designations. \n10 \n \n11 \n/ / / \n12 \n/ / / \n13 \n/ / / \n14 \n/ / / \n15 \n/ / / \n16 \n/ / / \n17 \n/ / / \n18 \n/ / / \n19 \n/ / / \n20 \n/ / / \n21 \n/ / / \n22 \n/ / / \n23 \n/ / / \n24 \n/ / / \n25 \n/ / / \n26 \n/ / / \n27 \n/ / / \n28 \n69 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 73 of 75\n \n1  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n2  Individual Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and others similar situated, ask this Court to \n3  grant the following relief:  \n4  1.  Declare that Defendants’ termination of the TPS designations for El Salvador, Haiti, \n5  Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua and Sudan, was unconstitutional under the Due Process \n6  Clause of the Fifth Amendment and unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act; \n7  2.  Declare  that  the  Defendants’  interpretation  of  the  TPS  statute  to  preclude \n8  consideration of intervening conditions was legally erroneous in violation of the \n9  Administrative Procedure Act.  \n10  3.  Declare that Defendants’ refusal to consider intervening conditions in making TPS \n11  decisions was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law in violation of the APA \n12  because it represented a sudden, unacknowledged, and unexplained departure from \n13  decades of decision-making practices and ordinary procedures. Further, Defendants \n14  changed their policy without taking into account the serious reliance interests that \n15  their prior policy had engendered. \n16  4.  Enjoin and restrain all Defendants, and their officers, agents, servants, employees, \n17  attorneys, and all other persons who are in active concern or participation with any of \n18  them, from terminating TPS for any TPS holders protected by this Court’s preliminary \n19  injunction who registers for a TPS extension by June 30, 2024, the last date at which \n20  TPS is protected pursuant to the preliminary injunction;   \n21  5.  Enjoin and restrain all Defendants, and their officers, agents, servants, employees, \n22  attorneys, and all other persons who are in active concern or participation with any of \n23  them,  from  requiring  or  collecting  an  initial  application  fee  for  Form  I-821, \n24  Application for Temporary Protected Status, from any TPS applicant whose TPS \n25  status was preserved by this Court’s preliminary injunction in Ramos or stay of \n26  proceedings in Bhattarai; \n27  6.  Order Defendants to take all steps necessary to return any initial application fee for \n28  Form I-821, Application for Temporary Protected Status, paid by TPS holders whose \n70 \nAMENDED COMPLAINT – CASE NO. 3:18-CV-1554-EMC \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 204   Filed 08/24/23   Page 74 of 75\n \n1  status was preserved by this Court’s preliminary injunction in Ramos or stay of \n2  proceedings in Bhattarai pursuant to the April 19, 2022 designation of Sudan for TPS \n3  or the August 3, 2021 designation of Haiti for TPS; \n4  7.  Alternatively, certify this case as a class action lawsuit as proposed herein, appoint \n5  Individual Plaintiffs Rilya Salary, S.S., and G.D.P. as class representatives of their \n6  class and the undersigned counsel as class counsel; \n7  8.  And enjoin and restrain all Defendants, and their officers, agents, servants, employees, \n8  attorneys, and all other persons who are in active concern or participation with any of \n9  them, from rescinding the immigration status of those TPS holders who have school-\n10  aged U.S. citizen children for so long as the children remain age five to eighteen; \n11  9.  Grant an award of attorneys’ fees and costs; and \n12  10. Grant any other and further relief that this Court may deem fit and proper. \n13   \n14 \nDate:  August 24, 2023       Respectfully submitted, \n15 \n \nSIDLEY AUSTIN LLP \n16 \n \n      /s/ Sean A.

The noncitizen individuals have permission to be in \n sir\netatsiD 16  the country pursuant to the Temporary Protected Status (“TPS”) designations for six countries, \nt\nS d nr\nee 17  specifically: (1) Sudan; (2) Haiti; (3) Nicaragua; (4) El Salvador; (5) Honduras; and (6) Nepal.  \ntinhtr\nUo\nN 18  Plaintiffs filed suit in 2018 and 2019, challenging the Trump administration’s termination of the \n19  TPS designations for those six countries.  In October 2018, this Court granted Plaintiffs a \n20  preliminary injunction.  The government appealed and prevailed, but, subsequently, in February \n21  2023, the Ninth Circuit granted Plaintiffs’ petition for an en banc hearing.  Shortly before the en \n22  banc hearing, the government announced that it would be rescinding the 2017 and 2018 \n23  terminations of the TPS designations for El Salvador, Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua.  By that \n24  time the government had already newly designated Haiti and Sudan for TPS.  The government \n25  thereafter voluntarily moved to dismiss its appeal with the Ninth Circuit , and the Ninth Circuit \n26  granted that relief. \n27  Following the appellate proceedings, Plaintiffs took the position before this Court that the \n28  case was still not moot.  The Court allowed Plaintiffs to file a consolidated amended complaint.  \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 222   Filed 12/28/23   Page 2 of 20\n \n1  The government then filed the pending motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  \n2  The government primarily argues that the case should be dismissed based on mootness, whether \n3  Plaintiffs are arguing (1) that the Trump administration’s TPS terminations were improper or (2) \n4  that the government has improperly charged TPS holders from Haiti or Sudan a $50 registration \n5  fee. \n6  Having considered the parties’ briefs and accompanying submissions, as well as the oral \n7  argument of counsel, the Court hereby GRANTS the motion to dismiss. \n8  I.  FACTUAL & PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n9  In the operative class action amended complaint (“CAC”), Plaintiffs allege as follows. \n10  Congress established the TPS program through the Immigration Act of 1990.  See CAC ¶ \n11  46.  The TPS statute is codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1254a.  See id.  Under the program, foreign nationals \n12  of designated countries are given lawful immigrant status because they cannot safely return home.  \n \ntr ain\nuoro 13  Specifically, the Attorney General has the authority to issue a TPS designation based on certain \nCfil\n tcaC 14  criteria – e.g., an ongoing armed conflict or an environmental disaster such as an earthquake or \nirts fo\niD tc 15  flood.  See id. ¶ 47; see also 8 U.S.C. § 1254a(b)(1).  An initial designation lasts between 6 to 18 \n sir\netatsiD 16  months.  See CAC ¶ 48; see also 8 U.S.C. § 1254a(b)(2).  “Before the designation can become \nt\nS d nr\nee 17  effective, the Secretary [of Homeland Security] must publish a notice in the Federal Register that \ntinhtr\nUo\nN 18  includes, among other things, a statement of findings, the effective date of the designation, and a \n19  tally of eligible foreign nationals.”  CAC ¶ 48; see also 8 U.S.C. § 1254a(b) (“A designation of a \n20  foreign state . . . under this paragraph shall not become effective unless notice of the designation \n21  (including a statement of the findings under this paragraph and the effective date of the \n22  designation) is published in the Federal Register.  In such notice, the Attorney General shall also \n23  state an estimate of the number of nationals of the foreign state designated who are (or within the \n24  effective period of the designation are likely to become) eligible for temporary protected status \n25  under this section and their immigration status in the United States.”).   \n26  Thereafter, the Secretary engages in a periodic review of TPS designations.

See id. ¶¶ 2, 8.  The \n21  termination was based on a new interpretation of the TPS statute.  According to Plaintiffs, \n \n22  DHS abandoned a long-established practice under which it \nconsidered all current conditions – including intervening events – in \n23  deciding whether to extend or terminate a country’s TPS \ndesignation.  In its place, DHS adopted a new, narrow practice in \n24  which DHS considers only whether the original conditions that \ninitially gave rise to the TPS designation persist, and only those \n25  ongoing harms directly tied to those original conditions. \n26  Id. ¶ 62 (emphasis added).  The new interpretation was “motivated by intentional race- and \n27  national-origin-based animus against individuals from what former President Trump referred to as \n28  ‘shithole countries.’ i.e., non-white, non-European immigrants.”  Id. ¶ 10. \n3 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 222   Filed 12/28/23   Page 4 of 20\n \n1  In October 2018, this Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, barring \n2  enforcement of the decisions to terminate TPS for Sudan, Haiti, El Salvador, and Nicaragua.  See \n3  id. ¶ 153; see also Docket No. 128 (order).  The government appealed to the Ninth Circuit.  \n4  However, pending appeal, it agreed “to issue periodic Federal Register notices automatically \n5  extending TPS status and employment authorization for TPS holders from El Salvador, Haiti, \n6  Nicaragua, and Sudan . . . for at least nine months at a time.”  CAC ¶ 156.

Reg. 40,282, at 40,285.   \n27 \n•  “El Salvador was initially designated for TPS in 2001 on environmental disaster grounds \nfollowing two separate earthquakes that occurred that year.”  Id.  “While some progress on \n28 \nreconstruction projects had been made by 2018, many of the problems caused by the 2001 \n5 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 222   Filed 12/28/23   Page 6 of 20\n \n1  On June 29, 2023, the Ninth Circuit granted Defendants’ motion to voluntarily dismiss the \n2  appeal.  The court did not address whether Defendants’ actions related to the countries at issue had \n3  mooted the case.  See id. ¶ 177. \n4  In addition to the above, Plaintiffs allege that, for Haiti and Sudan, there is another \n5  problem related to TPS designations.  Specifically, “[i]n redesignating Haiti and Sudan for TPS, \n6  DHS required Haitian and Sudanese TPS holders to file a request for TPS as new applicants, \n7  which requires the payment of a $50 fee which does not apply to TPS holders renewing their \n8  registrations.”  Id. ¶ 172 (emphasis added). \n9  Based on, inter alia, the above allegations, Plaintiffs assert the following claims for relief: \n10  (1) Violation of equal protection.  “Defendants’ decisions to terminate the TPS \n11  designations for [the six countries] are unconstitutional because they were \n12  motivated, at least in part, by intentional discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or \n \ntr ain\nuoro 13  national origin.”  Id. ¶ 226.   \nCfil\n tcaC 14  (2) Violation of due process.  “The government has not articulated, and cannot \nirts fo\niD tc 15  establish, any rational basis for reversing course on decades of established TPS \n sir\netatsiD 16  policy and ignoring the current capability of TPS counties to safely receive \nt\nS d nr\nee 17  longtime TPS holders, their families, and their U.S. citizen children.”  Id. ¶ 232.   \ntinhtr\nUo\nN 18  (3) Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”).  Defendants violated \n19 \n \n20 \nearthquakes persisted.  Since the disastrous effects of the earthquakes in 2001, El Salvador \nhas been encumbered by several natural disasters, environmental challenges, high levels of \n21 \nviolence, and economic instability, all of which significantly slowed its recovery and \ncontinued to render El Salvador unable to handle the return of its nationals at the time of \n22 \nthe decision to terminate the designation.”  Id. at 40,285-86.   \n•  “At the time of the determination to terminate the designation of TPS, DHS found that the \n23 \nsocial and economic conditions affected by the earthquakes had stabilized.  That \nconclusion was in error and reflects an inadequate assessment of conditions in El Salvador \n24 \nleading up to the announcement of the decision to terminate.  Although some social and \neconomic progress had been made by 2018, frequent and significant environmental \n25 \ndisasters occurred after the 2001 earthquakes causing additional challenges.  Recovery \nfrom the earthquakes continued to be slow and encumbered by hurricanes and tropical \n26 \nstorms, heavy rains and flooding, volcanic and seismic activity, a coffee rust epidemic, a \nprolonged and severe drought, and an increase in various mosquito-borne diseases, among \n27 \nother things.”  Id. at 40,286.  “Numerous natural disasters have negatively affected El \nSalvador since the 2001 earthquakes and have adversely impacted its ability to adequately \n28 \nhandle the return of its nationals granted TPS.”  Id. \n6 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 222   Filed 12/28/23   Page 7 of 20\n \n1  the APA by making a “sudden and unexplained departure from decades of \n2  decision-making practices and ordinary procedures.  By shifting the decision-\n3  governing standard for country designations without explanation, Defendants have \n4  ignored a clear statutory command and engaged in procedurally flawed decision-\n5  making.  Further, Defendants changed their policy without taking into account the \n6  serious reliance interests that their prior policy had engendered.”  Id. ¶ 239.   \n7  (4) Violation of the APA.  Defendants did not interpret the TPS statute in accordance \n8  with the law because the statute “does not prohibit the Secretary from considering \n9  intervening events when determining whether to extend TPS.”  Id. ¶ 242.   \n10  (5) Violation of the APA.  The parties agree that this claim is now moot.  See Mot. at \n11  15; Opp’n at 18 n.6.  Plaintiffs had alleged that Defendants violated the APA by \n12  “impos[ing] re-registration deadlines that expire long before the current TPS \n \ntr ain\nuoro 13  extensions expire.”  Id. ¶ 245. \nCfil\n tcaC 14  (6) Violation of due process.  The parties agree that this claim is now moot.  See Mot. \nirts fo\niD tc 15  15; Opp’n at 18 n.6.  Plaintiffs had alleged that “Defendants’ adoption of re-\n sir\netatsiD 16  registration deadlines that expire long before the current TPS extensions expire is \nt\nS d nr\nee 17  so lacking in justification and contrary to past practice that it fails to satisfy the \ntinhtr\nUo\nN 18  rationality constraints imposed by the Fifth Amendment on governmental \n19  decisionmaking in this context.”  Id. ¶ 248. \n20  (7) Violation of due process.  The due process rights of U.S. citizen children have \n21  been violated.  They have an absolute right to live in the United States and they \n22  have a fundamental right to live with and be raised by their parents.  See id. ¶¶ 252-\n23  53.  “[T]he government’s decision to end the lawful immigration status of their \n24  parents” forces the children “to choose between two alternatives when each \n25  alternative will deprive them of a substantial, constitutionally-protected aspect of \n26  liberty.”  Id. ¶ 254.   \n27 \n28 \n7 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 222   Filed 12/28/23   Page 8 of 20\n \n1  II.  DISCUSSION \n2  A.  Legal Standard \n3  In the pending motion, the government argues that Plaintiffs’ case is now moot.  Because \n4  mootness “pertain[s] to a federal court’s subject-matter jurisdiction under Article III, [it is] \n5  properly raised in a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), not Rule \n6  12(b)(6).”  White v. Lee, 227 F.3d 1214, 1242 (9th Cir. 2000). \n \n7  A Rule 12(b)(1) jurisdictional attack may be facial or factual.  In a \nfacial attack, the challenger asserts that the allegations contained in a \n8  complaint are insufficient on their face to invoke federal \njurisdiction.  By contrast, in a factual attack, the challenger disputes \n9  the truth of the allegations that, by themselves, would otherwise \ninvoke federal jurisdiction. . . . \n10   \nIn resolving a factual attack on jurisdiction, the district court may \n11  review evidence beyond the complaint without converting the \nmotion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment.  The court \n  12  need not presume the truthfulness of the plaintiff’s allegations.  \ntr ain “Once the moving party has converted the motion to dismiss into a \nuoro 13  factual motion by presenting affidavits or other evidence properly \nC tcirtsfilaC fo 14  baefsrfotaiudbgalihvstih tbisn eogfro  soruetb htjheerec  etc vomiudaretttn,e ctrhe j eun rpeicasdertsiycs atoiropynp t.oo”s  sinagti stfhye  imtso btuiornd emnu osft  furnish \niD tc 15   \n sir\netatsiD 16  Safe Air For Everyone v.

The \n19  government makes a facial attack to the extent Plaintiffs are challenging the Trump \n20  administration’s TPS terminations.3  The government makes a facial and a factual attack to the \n21  extent Plaintiffs are asserting that the government has failed to refund the $50 registration fee to \n22  TPS holders from Haiti and Sudan. \n23  B.  Mootness \n24  “A case becomes moot – and therefore no longer a ‘Case’ or ‘Controversy’ for purposes of \n25  Article III – ‘when the issues presented are no longer “live” or the parties lack a legally cognizable \n26 \n \n3 Although the government made a facial attack, Plaintiffs have somewhat tried to convert the \n27 \nattack into a factual one by submitting a notice about recent statements made by Candidate \nTrump’s team – i.e., regarding an intend to rescind TPS if Trump is elected President in 2024.  See \n28 \nDocket No. 219 (notice). \n8 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 222   Filed 12/28/23   Page 9 of 20\n \n1  interest in the outcome.’” Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 133 S. Ct. 721, 726 (2013).  According to the \n2  government, to the extent Plaintiffs challenge the Trump administration’s TPS terminations, that \n3  challenge is now moot because there are no live issues to resolve: (1) the government has given \n4  new TPS designations to Haiti and Sudan and (2) the government has rescinded the TPS \n5  terminations and granted TPS extensions for the remaining four countries at issue.   \n6  In response, Plaintiffs argue that their claims are not moot because of the voluntary \n7  cessation exception to mootness.  See Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Lohn, 511 F.3d 960, 964 (9th \n8  Cir. 2007) (taking note of “several major exceptions to mootness, including for (1) ‘collateral legal \n9  consequences,’ (2) ‘wrongs capable of repetition yet evading review,’ and (3) ‘voluntary \n10  cessation’”).  Under the voluntary cessation exception, “‘a defendant cannot automatically moot a \n11  case simply by ending its unlawful conduct once sued.’”  Brach v. Newsom, 38 F.4th 6, 12 (9th \n12  Cir. 2022).  The exception is based on “‘the principle that a party should not be able to evade \n \ntr ain\nuoro 13  judicial review, or to defeat a judgment, by temporarily altering questionable behavior.’”  Id.; see \nCfil\n tcaC 14  also Rosebrock v. Mathis, 745 F.3d 963, 971 (9th Cir. 2014) (stating that the “‘[t]he voluntary \nirts fo\niD tc 15  cessation of challenged conduct does not ordinarily render a case moot because a dismissal for \n sir\netatsiD 16  mootness would permit a resumption of the challenged conduct as soon as the case is dismissed’”) \nt\nS d nr\nee 17  (emphasis added).   \ntinhtr\nUo\nN 18  “[V]oluntary cessation can yield mootness if a ‘stringent’ standard is met: ‘A case might \n19  become moot if subsequent events made it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior \n20  could not reasonably be expected to recur.’”  Id.  “Reasonable expectation means something more \n21  than ‘a mere physical or theoretical possibility.’”  Brach, 38 F.4th at 14 (where plaintiffs alleged \n22  state officials violated federal law by suspending in-person instruction in schools during COVID-\n23  19 pandemic but restrictions had since been lifted and schools reopened, stating that the \n24  “speculative contingency [that pandemic conditions might change] and the fact ‘the Governor has \n25  the power to issue executive orders cannot itself be enough to skirt mootness, because then no suit \n26  against the government would ever be moot’”).   \n27  “The party asserting mootness bears a ‘heavy burden’ in meeting [the] standard [of no \n28  reasonable expectation of recurrence].”  Rosebrock, 745 F.3d at 971.  This is true even where it is \n9 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 222   Filed 12/28/23   Page 10 of 20\n \n1  the government that claims mootness.  But a court  \n \n2  nonetheless “treat[s] the voluntary cessation of challenged conduct \nby government officials with more solicitude . . . than similar action \n3  by private parties.”  This is no bare deference: we probe the record \nto determine whether the government has met its burden, even as we \n4  grant it a presumption of good faith. \n5  Brach, 38 F.4th at 12-13; see also Rosebrock, 745 F.3d at 971 (“We presume that a government \n6  entity is acting in good faith when it changes its policy, but when the Government asserts \n7  mootness based on such change it still must bear the heavy burden of showing that the challenged \n8  conduct cannot reasonably be expected to start up again.”). \n9  According to the government, a government entity generally meets the heavy burden of \n10  establishing no reasonable expectation of recurrence when a plaintiff is challenging a regulation \n11  and the government then “changes or repeals the regulation at issue.”  M.W., 2017 WL 10456732, \n12  at *5; cf. Rosebrock, 745 F.3d at 971 (“‘A statutory change . . . is usually enough to render a case \n \ntr ain\nuoro 13  moot, even if the legislature possesses the power to reenact the statute after the lawsuit is \nCfil\n tcaC 14  dismissed.’”).  The government adds that, with this kind of voluntary cessation, the burden shifts \nirts fo\niD tc 15  to the plaintiff to show that the government entity will likely reenact the regulation.  The \n sir\netatsiD 16  government’s position is supported by Ninth Circuit precedent.  In Board of Trustees of the \nt\nS d nr\nee 17  Glazing Health & Welfare Trust v. Chambers, 941 F.3d 1195 (9th Cir. 2019), the Ninth Circuit \ntinhtr\nUo\nN 18  stated: \n \n19  [W]e join the majority of our sister circuits in concluding that \nlegislative actions should not be treated the same as voluntary \n20  cessation of challenged acts by a private party, and that we should \nassume that a legislative body is acting in good faith in repealing or \n21  amending a challenged legislative provision, or in allowing it to \nexpire.  Therefore, in determining whether a case is moot, we should \n22  presume that the repeal, amendment, or expiration of legislation will \nrender an action challenging the legislation moot, unless there is a \n23  reasonable expectation that the legislative body will reenact the \nchallenged provision or one similar to it. \n24   \nThe party challenging the presumption of mootness need not show \n25  that the enactment of the same or similar legislation is a “virtual \ncertainty,” only that there is a reasonable expectation of \n26  reenactment.  But a determination that such a reasonable expectation \nexists must be founded in the record, as it was in City of Mesquite,[4] \n27 \n \n28 \n4 See City of Mesquite v. Aladdin’s Castle, Inc., 455 U.S. 283, 289 & n.11 (1982) (stating that “the \n10 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 222   Filed 12/28/23   Page 11 of 20\n \nrather than on speculation alone. \n1   \n2  Id. at 1199 (emphasis added); see also Rentberry, Inc. v. City of Seattle, 814 Fed. Appx. 309, 309 \n3  (9th Cir. 2020) (stating that “[a]ppellants have not met their burden of showing a ‘reasonable \n4  expectation’ that Seattle will enact a same or similar ordinance in the future”); Cocina Cultura \n5  LLC v. Oregon Dep’t of Admin. Servs., No. 3:20-cv-01866-IM, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 162629, at \n6  *16 (D. Or. Aug. 27, 2021) (stating that, “[n]otably, Glazing Health placed the burden on the \n7  plaintiff to show the case is not moot”); Cal. Rental Hous. Ass’n v. Newsom, No. 2:21-cv-01394-\n8  JAM-JDP, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 186483, at *9 (E.D. Cal. Oct. 11, 2022) (stating that, “[a]s the \n9  party seeking to rebut the presumption of mootness, Plaintiffs must show there is a reasonable \n10  expectation that the State will reoffend”).5 \n11  However, in the case at bar, the government has not repealed or amended any statute or \n12  regulation.  The government’s TPS determinations did not undergo the same rigorous process that \n \ntr ain\nuoro 13  statutes and regulations generally do (whether for repeal or amendment).  On the other hand, there \nCfil\n tcaC 14  is also no dispute that the government’s TPS designations/extensions have the force of law, and its \nirts fo\niD tc 15  actions have been formalized through publication in the Federal Register.  Thus, it may be argued \n sir\netatsiD 16  that the government’s TPS designations/extensions are akin to regulations – in which case, \nt\nS d nr\nee 17  arguably, mootness should be presumed and the burden shifted to Plaintiffs, i.e., to show that that \ntinhtr\nUo\nN 18  there is a reasonable expectation that the government will terminate the TPS designations in the \n19  future. \n20  For purposes of this order, the Court need not decide whether it would be appropriate to \n21  presume mootness based on the government’s TPS determinations and shift the burden to \n22 \n \n23 \ncity’s repeal of the objectionable language would not preclude it from reenacting precisely the \nsame provision if the District Court’s judgment were vacated”; “[i]ndeed, the city has announced \n24 \njust such an intention”). \n \n25 \n5 In addition to the Ninth Circuit, the Eleventh Circuit has adopted the same approach.  See Walker \nv. City of Calhoun, 901 F.3d 1245, 1270 (11th Cir. 2018) (“When a government voluntarily ceases \n26 \nthe challenged action, however, there is a presumption that the government will not later resume \nthe action, so the plaintiff bears the burden of showing that there is ‘a reasonable expectation’ that \n27 \nthe government ‘will reverse course and reenact the allegedly offensive’ policy.”) (emphasis \nomitted). \n28 \n \n11 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 222   Filed 12/28/23   Page 12 of 20\n \n1  Plaintiffs.  This is because, even under the typical standard – which imposes a heavy burden on the \n2  government to prove mootness – the government has sufficiently established there is no \n3  reasonable expectation that the government will reverse course on the TPS designations.  In this \n4  regard, the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Rosebrock is instructive.  There, the Ninth Circuit noted \n5  that  \n \n6  a policy change not reflected in statutory changes or even changes in \nordinances or regulations will not necessarily render a case moot, \n7  but it may do so in certain circumstances. \n \n8  We have not set forth a definitive test for determining whether a \nvoluntary cessation of this last type – one not reflected in statutory \n9  changes or even in changes in ordinances or regulations – has \nrendered a case moot.  But we have indicated that mootness is more \n10  likely if (1) the policy change is evidenced by language that is \n“broad in scope and unequivocal in tone”; (2) the policy change \n11  fully “addresses all of the objectionable measures that [the \nGovernment] officials took against the plaintiffs in th[e] case”; (3) \n  12  “th[e] case [in question] was the catalyst for the agency’s adoption \ntr ain of the new policy”; (4) the policy has been in place for a long time \nuoro 13  when we consider mootness; and (5) “since [the policy’s] \nC tcirtsfilaC fo 14  isamirmep illleeasmrs  etionn tctahltianiote ndc h tthaole lf eainnggdeen dmc yob’oyst  tnohefesf sipc wliaaihlnse thriefaf vt[h e]e .n” “o  ntO eenwn g tphaoeg leoicdtyh i en. r . c h.o acnnodduu,l dcwt  e \niD tc 15  be easily abandoned or altered in the future.” \n sir\netatsiD 16  Rosebrock, 745 F.3d at 971-72. \nt\nS d nr\nee 17  At the hearing, Plaintiffs argued that the government’s actions in the case at bar did not \ntinhtr\nUo\nN 18  amount to a change in policy.  The Court rejects that position.  The government clearly made a \n19  policy change: it considered intervening conditions for each of the six countries in making its TPS \n20  determinations (contrary to the Trump administration considering only originating conditions).6  \n21  Furthermore, the government’s consideration of intervening conditions was memorialized in \n22  written form – indeed, documented publicly in the Federal Register.  It is also worth noting that \n23  each designation granted TPS status for the statutory maximum of eighteen months.  Cf. White, \n24  227 F.3d at 1223 (stating that “it is clear that the Achtenberg memorandum [a document issued by \n25  the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity] represents a permanent change in \n26  the way HUD conducts HFA investigations, not a temporary policy that the agency will refute \n27 \n \n6 And for Haiti and Sudan, there were two designations each; the first TPS designation took place \n28 \nin 2022 and the second in 2023. \n12 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 222   Filed 12/28/23   Page 13 of 20\n \n1  once this litigation has concluded”).   \n2  At the hearing, Plaintiffs suggested that the government’s TPS determinations did not \n3  amount to a policy change because the government simply considered intervening factors as a \n4  factual matter and never stated outright that it was legally required to do so.  Plaintiffs’ position is \n5  strained.  Because the government considered intervening conditions in making its TPS \n6  determinations, it implicitly endorsed consideration of intervening conditions as a legal matter, \n7  even if it never expressly stated so.7  Even in the absence of a statement that it was legally required \n8  to consider intervening circumstances, the government’s clearly articulated decision to do so \n9  negates a reasonable expectation that it will revert to the previous administration’s contrary policy. \n10  Because the government’s TPS determinations did amount to a policy change, the Court \n11  turns to the Rosebrock factors.  Those factors point to mootness. \n12  (1) The government’s policy change is unequivocal for the reasons stated above – e.g., \n \ntr ain\nuoro 13  it consistently considered intervening conditions in multiple TPS determinations as \nCfil\n tcaC 14  publicly documented in the Federal Register. \nirts fo\niD tc 15  (2) The policy change fully addressed Plaintiffs’ objections by granting TPS status \n sir\netatsiD 16  and/or rescinding TPS terminations at issue. \nt\nS d nr\nee 17  (3) Although it is not definitively evident whether the instant case was the catalyst for \ntinhtr\nUo\nN 18  the government to make the policy change, the case was referred to in the Federal \n19  Register notices, thus indicating that the case was in fact a consideration for the \n20  government.   \n21  (4) Of the six countries at issue, Haiti was the first to be given a TPS designation after \n22  the Trump administration ended.  Since Haiti’s TPS designation issued in 2021, the \n23  policy change has been in effect for at least two years.  This is not an insignificant \n24  period of time, especially as eighteen months is the statutory maximum for a TPS \n25  designation.  Furthermore, it is notable that, by Plaintiffs’ own account, the \n26  government’s policy change was a return to a “‘long-established practice’ . . . used \n27 \n \n7 To the extent Plaintiffs are asserting that mootness cannot be established absent an express \n28 \nrenunciation of a prior policy or practice by the government, that issue is addressed infra. \n13 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 222   Filed 12/28/23   Page 14 of 20\n \n1  ‘by Republican and Democratic Administrations alike.’”  Mot. at 11 (quoting \n2  CAC); see also CAC ¶ 11 (alleging that the Trump administration “abandoned a \n3  long-established practice under which [DHS] considered all current conditions – \n4  including intervening events – in deciding whether to extend or terminate a \n5  country’s TPS designation”).  The current policy is a long standing one. \n6  (5) Since the policy change, agency officials have not engaged in conduct similar to \n7  that challenged by Plaintiffs.  In fact, Haiti and Sudan have each been designated \n8  twice, which reflects a commitment to the policy change. \n9  In short, there is no indication that the government’s policy change here is a “temporary [one] that \n10  [it] will refute once this litigation has concluded.”8  White, 227 F.3d at 1223. \n11  In their papers, Plaintiffs protest it is not absolutely clear that the challenged conduct could \n12  not reasonably be expected to recur because the government has failed to acknowledge that the \n \ntr ain\nuoro 13  Trump administration’s interpretation of the TPS statute “ever existed” and has refused to \nCfil\n tcaC 14  explicitly acknowledge the unlawfulness of that interpretation.  Opp’n at 1; see also Opp’n at 5 \nirts fo\niD tc 15  (“Defendants appears to have departed from a past practice . . . for the time being, but have never \n sir\netatsiD 16  acknowledged using it, let alone disavowed it.”).  But Plaintiffs’ position cannot be squared with \nt\nS d nr\nee 17  the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Brach.  There, the court stated: “‘[T]he mere power to reenact a \ntinhtr\nUo\nN 18  challenged [policy] is not a sufficient basis on which a court can conclude that a reasonable \n19  expectation of recurrence exists.’”  Brach, 38 F.4th at 14.  Moreover, as noted above, even if the \n20  current administration does not concede the prior policy was unlawful, it has squarely rejected that \n21  policy. \n22  Plaintiffs contend still that case authority supports their position that there is no mootness \n23  where the government changes its conduct but fails to clearly renounce its prior conduct (i.e., it \n24  does not clearly repudiate that prior conduct).  See Opp’n at 6-7.  The cases that Plaintiffs cite, \n25 \n \n26 \n8 To be sure, the Court is recognizes Plaintiffs’ concern that there is the possibility of another \npolicy change in the future, in particular, if Candidate Trump is reelected.  But at this point in the \n27 \nproceedings, that possibility is too speculative.  Furthermore, nothing precludes Plaintiffs from \nreinitiating a challenge if Candidate Trump were to be reelected and reinstates the challenged \n28 \npolicy. \n14 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 222   Filed 12/28/23   Page 15 of 20\n \n1  however, are distinguishable.  For example, in West Virginia v. EPA, 142 S. Ct. 2587 (2022), the \n2  EPA promulgated what was known as the Clean Power Plan rule (pursuant to the Clean Air Act).  \n3  The Clean Power Plan never went into effect because the same day that the EPA promulgated the \n4  rule, a number of parties petitioned for review in federal court.  The Supreme Court granted a stay \n5  which prevented the rule from taking effect.  Before the lower appellate court could issue a \n6  decision on the merits, there was a change in Presidential administrations, and “[t]he new \n7  administration requested that the litigation be held in abeyance so that EPA could reconsider the \n8  Clean Power Plan.”  Id. at 2604.   \n9  Subsequently, the EPA repealed the rule, concluding that the Plan had been in excess of its \n10  statutory authority.  The agency also replaced the Clean Power Plan by promulgating a new \n11  regulation known as the Affordable Clean Energy rule.  This agency action precipitated a new \n12  round of petitions for review.  The D.C. Circuit thereafter held that the EPA’s repeal of the Clean \n \ntr ain\nuoro 13  Power Plan rested on a mistaken reading of the Clean Air Act and thus vacated the agency’s repeal \nCfil\n tcaC 14  of the Clean Power Plan and further vacated the replacement rule.  This court decision was \nirts fo\niD tc 15  followed by another change in Presidential administrations.  The EPA then asked the D.C. Circuit \n sir\netatsiD 16  to partially stay issuance of its mandate so that the Clean Power Plan “would not immediately go \nt\nS d nr\nee 17  back into effect.  EPA believed that such a result would not make sense while it was in the process \ntinhtr\nUo\nN 18  of considering whether to promulgate a new [replacement] rule.”  Id. at 2606. \n19  One of the issues before the Supreme Court was whether any petitioners had standing to \n20  seek relief from the federal court.  The Supreme Court held that at least one group of petitioners \n21  did, specifically because they had suffered injury as a result of the D.C. Circuit decision vacating \n22  the repeal of the Clean Power Plan.  That decision “purports to bring the Clean Power Plan back \n23  into legal effect.”  Id. at 2606.  The government argued that the petitioners’ challenge should be \n24  deemed moot because the EPA had made a representation that it had “no intention of enforcing the \n25  Clean Power Plan prior to promulgating a new . . . rule.”  Id. at 2607.  The Supreme Court rejected \n26  the government’s position, stating as follows: “[T]he Government ‘nowhere suggests that if this \n27  litigation is resolved in its favor it will not’ reimpose emissions limits predicated on generation \n28  shifting; indeed, it ‘vigorously defends’ the legality of such an approach.  We do not dismiss a \n15 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 222   Filed 12/28/23   Page 16 of 20\n \n1  case as moot in such circumstances.”  Id.   \n2  As the government points out in its papers, West Virginia is of limited support to Plaintiffs.  \n3  The facts in West Virginia are markedly different from those in instant case as (1) West Virginia \n4  involved a mere promise, not a policy change as in the case at bar, and (2) the promise in West \n5  Virginia was that the government would not enforce an existing policy whereas, here, the \n6  government has acted to enforce its policy and demonstrated a commitment to the same. \n7  This, of course, is not to say that it is entirely irrelevant whether the government expressly \n8  repudiates its prior conduct.  See, e.g., Brach, 38 F.4th at 13 (“California has presented a strong \n9  case that the current order opening schools is not a temporary move to sidestep the litigation.  \n10  Most importantly, the State has ‘unequivocally renounce[d]’ the use of school closure orders in the \n11  future.  The State has consistently worked to reopen schools and Governor Newsom has publicly \n12  ‘reaffirm[ed]’ his ‘commitment to keeping California’s schools open for safe, in-person learning.’  \n \ntr ain\nuoro 13  That reaffirmance is no mere statement of aspiration.’”).  But as one district court has noted, \nCfil\n tcaC 14  Brach’s reference to the government’s unequivocal renouncing of prior conduct should not be \nirts fo\niD tc 15  overstated: \n sir\netattsiD 16   Although the Ninth Circuit found it compelling that the State \nS d nr “renounce[d] its use of school closure orders in the future,” the court \netinehtr 17  dreindo nuontc eremqeunirt ew aans  esxigpnliicfiitc arennt oounnlyce bmeecnatu sfeo ri ti tdse amnoalnysstirsa.t e Tdh teh e \nUo\nN 18  State’s “commitment” to keeping schools open.  As such, where the \nState shows through other means that it is committed to quitting the \n19  challenged conduct, the State does need an explicit announcement \ndenouncing its previous conduct. \n20   \n21  Cal. Rental Hous. Ass’n, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 186483, at *9-10 (emphasis added); see also Am. \n22  Diabetes Ass’n v. United States Dep’t of the Army, 938 F.3d 1147, 1152 (9th Cir. 2019) (stating \n23  that government “still must bear the heavy burden of showing that the challenged conduct cannot \n24  reasonably be expected to start up again” and “[i]t may do so by persuading the court that the \n25  change in its behavior is entrenched or permanent”) (emphasis added; internal quotation marks \n26  omitted).  While an express repudiation of prior policy may make for an exceptionally clear case \n27  for mootness, unequivocal action which implicitly repudiates prior policy may also establish \n28  mootness, particularly when all or nearly all the Rosebrock factors are satisfied. \n16 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 222   Filed 12/28/23   Page 17 of 20\n \n1  Accordingly, the Court concludes that the government has met its burden of showing that \n2  the challenged conduct cannot reasonably be expected to recur.  Plaintiffs’ challenge to the TPS \n3  terminations is moot. \n4  C.  Registration Fee of $50 \n5  Plaintiffs argue that, even if the Court finds their challenge to the TPS terminations moot, \n6  the case still has another live component.  Plaintiffs have alleged that, when DHS issued new TPS \n7  designations for Haiti and Sudan (in August 2021 and April 2022), it required TPS holders from \n8  those countries to pay a $50 registration fee – “which does not apply to TPS holders renewing \n9  their registrations.”  CAC ¶ 172 (emphasis added).  “These individuals would not have had to pay \n10  any fee if TPS for Haiti and Sudan had not been terminated during the Trump Administration, \n11  because they would have been able to apply for TPS as re-registrants, rather than initial \n12  applicants.”  Id. ¶ 173. \n \ntr ain\nuoro 13  In response to this claim of injury, the government has provided a declaration from a \nCfil\n tcaC 14  USCIS employee, Sharon Orise.  In her declaration, Ms. Orise testifies to the following: \nirts fo\niD tc 15  •  “On August 3, 2021, an FRN was published newly designating Haiti for TPS. \n sir\netatsiD 16  Everyone who applied for Haiti TPS under this designation had to file as an initial \nt\nS d nr\nee 17  registrant and pay the $50 registration fee, regardless of whether an individual had \ntinhtr\nUo\nN 18  TPS prior to the January 18, 2018 termination [by the Trump administration].”  \n19  Orise Decl. ¶ 15. \n20  •  “On April 19, 2022, an FRN was published designating Sudan for TPS. Everyone \n21  who applied for Sudan TPS under this designation had to file as an initial registrant \n22  and pay the $50 registration fee, regardless of whether an individual had TPS prior \n23  to the October 2017 termination [by the Trump administration].”  Orise Decl. ¶ 18. \n24  •  But “[i]n August 2021, USCIS began refunding the $50 registration fee to \n25  Sudanese and Haitian TPS beneficiaries who paid this fee a second time due to the \n26  2021 and 2022 FRNs.  This would include applicants who paid the $50 fee under \n27  the Haiti 2021 designation, provided they had Haiti TPS prior to January 2018, and \n28  applicants who paid the $50 fee under the Sudan 2022 designation, provided they \n17 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 222   Filed 12/28/23   Page 18 of 20\n \n1  had Sudan TPS prior to October 2017.  The first certified refund request was \n2  received on August 3, 2022.  Thereafter, USCIS has been refunding on a quarterly \n3  basis.  USCIS efforts to identify and refund applicable payments continue.  There \n4  are currently no refunds pending.”  Orise Decl. ¶ 20. \n5  •  “As of August 29, 2023, USCIS has processed 24,227 refunds for TPS Haiti \n6  applicants and 43 refunds for TPS Sudan applicants.”  Orise Decl. ¶ 21. \n7  The Orise declaration’s statements regarding refunds are consistent with statements regarding \n8  registration fees made in the TPS extension given to Haiti in January 2023.  See 88 Fed. Reg. \n9  5,022, at 5,028 (Jan. 26, 2023) (“Individuals with existing TPS granted under the 2021 designation \n10  of Haiti must file Form-821 for re-registration as discussed above.  Individuals who currently \n11  retain their TPS under the Ramos injunction noted in footnote 1 above, may file Form I-821 for re-\n12  registration if they wish to help ensure that their TPS continues should the Ramos court order end \n \ntr ain\nuoro 13  and they remain eligible.  Re-registrants do not pay the $50 filing fee for the Form I-821 but must \nCfil\n tcaC 14  pay the biometric services fee if age 14 or older (or request a fee waiver).”). \nirts fo\niD tc 15  The government argues that any injury claimed by Plaintiffs with respect to the $50 \n sir\netatsiD 16  registration fee is at most a collateral consequence (the primary injury being the TPS terminations \nt\nS d nr\nee 17  by the Trump administration).9  Plaintiffs somewhat disagree, asserting that the injury here could \ntinhtr\nUo\nN 18  be construed as an ongoing injury, and not just a collateral consequence.  How exactly the injury is \n19  characterized is not material.  The government’s position is that: \n20  (1) Plaintiffs themselves have not suffered that injury – i.e., those Plaintiffs who are from \n21 \n \n22 \n9 There is an exception to mootness for collateral legal consequences.  This exception applies \nwhere a party would suffer collateral legal consequences “although the primary injury may have \n23 \npassed.”  EEOC v. Fed. Express Corp., 558 F.3d 842, 847 (9th Cir. 2009) (stating that “[t]he \ncollateral legal consequences exception applies [where], although the primary injury may have \n24 \npassed . . . , there remains ‘a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal \ninterests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment’”); \n25 \nsee also Ctr. for Biological Diversity, 511 F.3d at 964-65 (the exception “applies where an \nappellant ‘would suffer collateral legal consequences if the actions being appealed were allowed to \n26 \nstand’”).  “It is commonly applied in habeas corpus proceedings where mootness would generally \nbar relief if the petitioner completes his sentence before the court has addressed the merits of his \n27 \npetition, but not if the plaintiff demonstrates he will suffer collateral legal consequences if the \nchallenged conviction is allowed to stand.”  San Luis & Delta-Mendota Water Auth. v. United \n28 \nStates DOI, 870 F. Supp. 2d 943, 959 (E.D. Cal. 2012). \n18 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 222   Filed 12/28/23   Page 19 of 20\n \n1  Haiti or Sudan did not themselves pay a $50 registration fee even if other Haitian or \n2  Sudanese TPS holders did.  See Mot. at 11 (“No Plaintiff alleges that they have actually \n3  had to pay a $50 registration fee.”); Reply at 9 (“Whether cast as a continuing harm or \n4  collateral legal consequence, Plaintiffs do not allege that they are affected by the now-\n5  rescinded and already refunded $50 re-registration fee and thus have no standing to \n6  challenge it.”).   \n7  (2) Even if Plaintiffs could amend to correct this deficiency (either amending to allege that \n8  they suffered this injury or amending to add a new plaintiff who did, see Opp’n at 14 \n9  n.3), “the latest amended complaint seeks only declaratory and injunctive relief,” and \n10  “a moot case seeking [such] relief cannot be revived by a damages claim raised for the \n11  first time in briefing challenging mootness.”  Reply at 9; see also Seven Words LLC v. \n12  Network Solns., 260 F.3d 1089, 1097 (9th Cir. 2001) (“The Supreme Court has \n \ntr ain\nuoro 13  admonished us to be wary of late-in-the-day damages claims . . . , cautioning that ‘a \nCfil\n tcaC 14  claim for . . . damages, extracted late in the day from [plaintiff’s] general prayer for \nirts fo\niD tc 15  relief and asserted solely to avoid otherwise certain mootness, [bears] close \n sir\netatsiD 16  inspection.’”). \nt\nS d nr\nee 17  (3) Even if the Court were inclined to allow a damages claim, there is sovereign immunity.  \ntinhtr\nUo\nN 18  See Reply at 9. \n19  For purposes of this order, the Court need only address the first argument.  Plaintiffs agree \n20  that no named Plaintiff has paid a $50 registration fee following the new designations of Haiti and \n21  Sudan.  That being the case, there is no Plaintiff in this case who has standing to proceed with this \n22  claim.   \n23  III.  CONCLUSION \n24  For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants the government’s motion to dismiss.  Plaintiffs’ \n25  claims challenging the TPS terminations are moot.  Those claims are therefore dismissed.  The \n26  dismissal is with prejudice as Plaintiffs have not indicated that they could plead additional facts to \n27  overcome this deficiency.   \n28  As for Plaintiffs’ claim challenging the $50 registration fee, it is also dismissed but based \n19 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01554-EMC   Document 222   Filed 12/28/23   Page 20 of 20\n \n1  on lack of standing.
