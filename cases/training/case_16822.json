The plaintiff sued the County of Susquehanna under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for alleged violations of the Fourth Amendment. Specifically, the plaintiff challenged the Susquehanna Prison policy of delousing, showering and strip-searching all inmates, regardless of the nature of their charged crime or the likelihood that the individual was concealing a weapon or contraband. The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary damages, and class certification.</p><p>Although the case was initially assigned to Judge Thomas I. Vanaskie, it was later reassigned to Chief Judge Yvette Kane and then to Judge A. Richard Caputo. </p><p>The parties sought class-action status for a statewide class of those who were strip-searched after being charged with minor violations or misdemeanors in the judicial district. </p><p>Meanwhile, as litigation in this case continued, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that blanket strip search policies were constitutional. </p><p>Florence v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders of County of Burlington, 621 F.3d 296 (3d Cir. 2010).</p><p>In light of the new holding, the plaintiff sought class certifications for two new classes pertaining solely to the delousing portion of the strip search procedure. The plaintiffs claimed that the delousing policy was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment and that it violated the detainees' rights to refuse unwanted medical treatments under the Fourteenth Amendment.</p><p>On October 5, 2011, Judge Caputo certified the Fourteenth Amendment Class but denied the Fourth Amendment Class, on the grounds that the court in <i>Florence</i> held that the strip search procedures, including the delousing portion, were reasonable.  621 F.3d 296. The liability class consisted of all people who had been placed into the custody of the Susquehanna County Jail after being sentenced or as pre-trial detainees who were deloused upon their entry into Susquehanna County Jail. The defendants appealed this decision, but the Court of Appeals denied the petition to appeal the order. Extensive discovery followed between 2012-2013. </p><p>On September 13, 2013, Judge Caputo granted the Defendant’s motion for summary judgment with respect to the constitutionality of the delousing policy. The Court reasoned that the state had a legitimate interest in maintaining a sanitary facility, that the policy was reasonable, and accommodating inmates’ right to refuse the treatment would substantially burden the defendant. 2013 WL 5201571. </p><p>The case is now closed. </p><p></p>",

This is a class action lawsuit brought to redress the deprivation by The County of \nSusquehanna, of rights secured to the plaintiff, Roneld Logoroy, and the proposed Class, by the \nUnited States Constitution and the laws of the United States of America.  For at least the past \ntwo years prior to the date of the commencement of this litigation, Susquehanna County and the \nSusquehanna County Jail  have had a blanket policy of delousing, showering and strip-searching \nall individuals who enter the Susquehanna County Prison (\"SCCF\") and are placed in jail \nclothing, regardless of the crime for which they are charged.  This blanket policy is, in part, \nderived from the written procedures of the SCCF, and was promulgated by senior Susquehanna \nCounty officials. \n2.  It has been well established in this Judicial Circuit for many years that individuals \ncharged with misdemeanors or minor violations cannot be strip-searched absent particularized \nsuspicion that they possess weapons or contraband.  In short, the blanket policy of Susquehanna \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01448-TIV     Document 1      Filed 07/24/2009     Page 2 of 11\nCounty and the SCCF to force those charged with minor crimes to undergo the indignities of a \nstrip search upon entry into the SCCF (\"SCJ\") is illegal. \n3.  Roneld Logory (\"Plaintiff') brings this action on behalf of himself, and on behalf of a \nclass of thousands of others who were deloused, showered, and strip searched after being \ncharged with petty offenses, to vindicate the clear and unnecessary violation of his civil rights \nand those of the class members he proposes to represent.  Plaintiff was charged with a \nmisdemeanor offense, and subjected to a strip search, in violation of his right against \nunreasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  Plaintiff \nseeks monetary damages for himself and each member of the proposed class, a declaration that \nthe Jail's policies are unconstitutional, and an injunction precluding Susquehanna County and the \nSCCF from continuing to violate the rights of those placed into their custody.  With the \nforegoing as  background, and upon information and belief except as to the allegations \nconcerning himself, Plaintiff complains as follows: \nJURISDICTION \n4.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, \n1341 and 1343 because the action was filed to obtain compensatory damages and injunctive \nrelief for the deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights of citizens of the United States \nsecured by the United States Constitution and by federal law pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and \n1983.  This Court also has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of28 U.S.C. § 2201, \nas it was filed to obtain declaratory relief relative to the constitutionality of the policies of a \nlocal government. \n5.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) (2) because the events giving rise to the \nPlaintiff's claims and those of the proposed class members occurred in this judicial district. \n2 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01448-TIV     Document 1      Filed 07/24/2009     Page 3 of 11\nPARTIES \n6.  Plaintiff, Roneld Logory, is, and at all times relevant hereto has been, a resident of the \nState ofNew Jersey, and is domiciled in Princeton, New Jersey.  On or about June 19,2008, Mr. \nLogory was detained at the SCCF. \n7.  Defendant Susquehanna County (the \"County\") is a county government organized and \nexisting under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  At all times relevant hereto, \nthe County was responsible for the policies, practices, supervision, implementation and \nconduct of all matters pertaining to the SCCF and was responsible for the appointment, \ntraining, supervision and conduct of all SCCF personnel.  In addition, at all relevant times, the \nCounty was responsible for enforcing the rules of the SCCF and for ensuring that SCCF \nemployees obey the Constitution and the laws of the United States. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n8.  Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(l), 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of Plaintiff and a class of similarly situated \nindividuals who were arrested for misdemeanors or minor violations and who were unlawfully \nstrip-searched upon their entry into the SCCF . \n9.  The class that Plaintiff seeks to represent is defined as follows: \nAll persons who have been be placed into custody of the SCCF after being charged with \nmisdemeanor offenses, summary offenses, traffic infractions, family court violations \nand/or civil commitments and were strip-searched upon their entry into the SCCF.  The \nClass period commences on or about July 24, 2007 and extends to the date on which the \nDefendant is enjoined from, or otherwise ceases, enforcing its unconstitutional policy, \npractice and custom of conducting strip-searches absent reasonable suspicion. \nSpecifically excluded from the Class are Defendant and any and all of its respective \naffiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees. \n3 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01448-TIV     Document 1      Filed 07/24/2009     Page 4 of 11\n10.  This action may be brought and may properly be maintained as a class action under \nFederal law and satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy requirements for \nmaintaining a class action under Fed.  R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n11.  The members of the Class are so numerous as to render joinder impracticable.  There are, \nand have been, hundreds and probably thousands of people who have been arrested for \nmisdemeanors, summary offenses, traffic infractions, failing to make payment on outstanding \ntraffic violations, failing to make payment on outstanding fines, family court commitments or \nother minor crimes, who were strip-searched under the circumstances described herein. \n12.  Joinder of all these individuals is impracticable because of the large number of Class \nmembers and the fact that Class members are likely dispersed over a large geographic area, with \nsome members residing outside of Susquehanna County and this Judicial District.  Furthermore, \nmany members of the Class are low-income persons, may not speak English, may not know of \ntheir rights and likely would have great difficulty in pursuing their rights individually. \n13.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, in that all Class \nmembers' rights to be free from unreasonable searches were violated by Defendant, which \nconducted blanket strip searches absent particularized suspicion.  All members of the Class were \ncharged with misdemenaor crimes or other minor crimes when placed into the custody of the \nSCCF, and all were illegally strip searched in violation of the established law in this Judicial \nCircuit. \n14.  Plaintiffs claims are typical of the claims of the members of the Class.  Plaintiff and all \nmembers of the Class have sustained damages arising out of Defendant's course of conduct.  The \nharms suffered by the Plaintiff are typical of the harms suffered by the Class. \n4 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01448-TIV     Document 1      Filed 07/24/2009     Page 5 of 11\n15.  The representative Plaintiff has the requisite personal interest in the outcome of this \naction and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class.  Plaintiff has no interests \nthat are adverse to the interests of the members of the Class. \n16.  The named Plaintiffhas retained counsel with substantial experience and success in the \nprosecution of class action and civil rights litigation.  Plaintiff is being represented by Charles J. \nLaDuca, Alexandra Warren, and Brendan Thompson of Cuneo Gilbert & LaDuca, LLP; Elmer \nRobert Keach, III, Esquire ofthe Law Offices of Elmer Robert Keach, III, PC; and Beverly \nSteinberg-Spom, Esquire.  Plaintiff's counsel have the resources, expertise and experience to \nsuccessfully prosecute this action against the Defendant.  No conflict exists between the Plaintiff \nand members of the Class, or between counsel and members of the Class. \n17.  This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  As such, the Plaintiff seeks \nclass certification under Fed.R.Civ.P.  23(b)(2), in that all Class members were subject to the \nsame policy requiring the illegal strip searches of individuals charged with misdemeanor or other \nminor crimes and placed into the custody ofthe SCJ.  In short, the County of Susquehanna, and \nSCCF Officers acted on grounds generally applicable to all Class members. \n18.  In addition to certification under Rule 23(b )(2), and in the alternative, Plaintiff seeks \ncertification under Rule 23(b)(3). \n19.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class that predominate \nover any questions that affect only individual members of the Class.  The predominant common \nquestions of law and fact include, without limitation, the common and predominate question of \nwhether the Defendant's written and/or de facto blanket policy of strip-searching individuals \nwho were charged with misdemeanor charges or violations when transferred to and placed into \n5 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01448-TIV     Document 1      Filed 07/24/2009     Page 6 of 11\nthe custody of the Jail violate the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution and whether such a written and/or de facto policy existed during the Class period. \n20.  A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication \nof this controversy since joinder of all of the individual members of the Class is impracticable \ngiven the large number of Class members and the fact that they are dispersed over a large \ngeographic area. Furthermore, the expense and burden of individual litigation would make it \ndifficult or impossible for individual members of the Class to redress these constitutional \nviolations.  The cost to the federal court system of adjudicating thousands of individual cases \nwould be enormous.  Individualized litigation would also magnify the delay and expense to all \nparties and the court system.  By contrast, the classification of this action as a class action in this \nDistrict presents far fewer management difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the \ncourt system, and protects the rights of each member of the Class. \n21.  There are no other actions pending to address the Defendant's flagrant violation of the \ncivil rights of detainees, even though the Defendant has maintained its illegal strip search \nregimen for at least the past several years. \n22.  In addition to, and in the alternative, Plaintiff seeks certification under Fed.R.Civ.P. \n23(b)(3) or seeks partial certification under Fed. R.Civ.P. 23(c)(4). \nFACTS \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally \n23.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits the Defendant from \nperforming strip searches of pre-trial detainees who have been charged with misdemeanors, \nsummary offenses, civil commitments or other minor crimes unless there is reasonable \nsuspicion to believe that the arrestee is concealing a weapon or contraband. \n6 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01448-TIV     Document 1      Filed 07/24/2009     Page 7 of 11\n24.  Susquehanna County has instituted a blanket policy of delousing, showering and strip-\nsearching all individuals who enter the custody of the SCJ regardless of the nature of their \ncharged crime and without the presence of reasonable suspicion to believe that the individual \nwas concealing a weapon or contraband. \n25.  Susquehanna County has instituted a written blanket policy of delousing, showering, and \nconducting visual inspections of all detainees who enter the SCJ while they are in a state of \ncomplete undress, regardless of the individual characteristics or the nature of their charged \ncrime.  For purposes of this Complaint, this practice is collectively referred to as \"strip-\nsearches.\" \n26.  Defendant knows or should know, that it may not institute, enforce or permit \nenforcement of a policy or practice of conducting strip-searches without particularized, \nreasonable suspicion.  The SCJ written policy is based on a policy promulgated by Susquehanna \nCounty and/or the SCCF. \n27.  The Defendant's written and/or de facto policy, practice and custom mandating blanket \nstrip-searches of pre-trial misdemeanor detainees has been promulgated, effectuated and/or \nenforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established law. \n28.  Reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip search may emanate only from the circumstances \nincident to the search, such as the nature of the crime charged, the characteristics of the arrestee, \nand/or the circumstances of the arrest. \n29.  Susquehanna County has promulgated, implemented, enforced, and/or failed to rectify a \nwritten and/or de facto policy, practice or custom of strip-searching all individuals placed into \nthe custody of the SCJ without any requirement of reasonable suspicion in violation of the \nFourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  This written and/or de facto policy has \n7 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01448-TIV     Document 1      Filed 07/24/2009     Page 8 of 11\nmade the strip-searching of pre-trial detainees routine; neither the nature of the offense charged, \nthe characteristics of the arrestee, nor the circumstances of a particular arrest have been taken \ninto account in enforcing the policy, practice and custom of routine strip-searches. \n30.  Pursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, each member of the Class, including the \nnamed Plaintiff, was the victim of a routine strip-search upon their entry into the SCCF.  These \nsearches were conducted without inquiry into or establishment of reasonable suspicion, and in \nfact, were not supported by reasonable suspicion. Strip searches are conducted for individuals \narrested for, among other minor offenses, unpaid parking tickets, traffic violations, outstanding \ntraffic fines and other minor offenses. \n31.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip-search conducted pursuant to this \nwritten and/or de facto policy, the victims ofthe unlawful blanket strip-searches-each \nmember of the Class, including the named Plaintiff-has suffered or will suffer psychological \npain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiff \n32.  Plaintiffs experiences are representative of the Class. \n33.  On the evening of June 19, 2008, Mr. Logory was arrested for Driving Under the \nInfluence, a misdemeanor offense.  Upon being transported to the SCJ, Plaitiffwas taken to a \nbathroom by two Correctional Officers.  Mr. Logory was directed to remove all of his clothing \nand, among other things, spread the lobes of his buttocks and lift his testicles, to allow for \ninspection by the Correctional Officers.  After the strip search, a Correctional Officer sprayed \nPlaintiff with a delousing agent on his genitals and was then required to undergo a supervised \nshower.  Plaintiff was humiliated and degraded by these illegal unconstitutional acts. \n8 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01448-TIV     Document 1      Filed 07/24/2009     Page 9 of 11\nCAUSES OF ACTION \nAS AND FOR A FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST \nDEFENDANT SUSQUEHANNA COUNTY \nViolation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law \n-Unreasonable Search and Failure to Implement Municipal Policies to Avoid \n· Constitutional Deprivation Under Color of State Law-\n34.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges each and every allegation stated in the \npreceding paragraphs, as if fully set forth herein. \n35.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens from \nunreasonable searches by law enforcement officers, and prohibits officers from conducting strip \nsearches of individuals arrested for misdemeanor offenses or violations absent some \nparticularized suspicion that the individual in question has either contraband or weapons. \n36.  The actions of the Defendant Susquehanna County, as detailed above, violated Plaintiff's \nand the Class's rights under the United States Constitution.  Simply put, it was not objectively \nreasonable for SCCF personnel to strip search Plaintiff and the members of the Class based on \ntheir arrests for misdemeanor or other minor criminal charges. \n37.  These strip searches were conducted pursuant to the blanket policy, custom or practice of \nSusquehanna County.  As such, Defendant Susquehanna County is directly liable for the \ndamages of the Class. \n38.  This conduct on the part ofthe Defendants represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983, \ngiven that their actions were undertaken under color of state law. \n39.  As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above, Plaintiff and \nthe Class have been irreparably injured and seek damages, as well as the declaratory and \ninjunctive relief set forth immediately below in the Prayer for Relief. \n9 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01448-TIV     Document 1      Filed 07/24/2009     Page 10 of 11\nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY \n40. The Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff, individually and on behalf of a Class of others similarly \nsituated, requests that this Honorable Court grant them the following relief: \nA.  An order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. \nB.  A judgment against Defendant Susquehanna County on Plaintiff's claims \ndetailed herein, awarding compensatory damages to Plaintiff and each member \nof the proposed Class in an amount to be determined by a jury and/or the Court \non both an individual and a class-wide basis. \nC.  A declaratory judgment against Defendant declaring Susquehanna County's \npolicy, practice and custom of strip searching all detainees entering the SCCF, \nregardless of the offense charged or suspicion of contraband, to be \nunconstitutional and improper. \nD.  A preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining Defendant from continuing to \nstrip search individuals charged with misdemeanor offenses and minor crimes \nabsent particularized, reasonable suspicion that the arrestee subjected to the \nsearch is concealing weapons or other contraband. \nE.  A monetary award for attorneys' fees and the costs ofthis action, pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983 and Fed.R.Civ. P. 23, \nF.  Such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. \n10 \n\nCase 3:09-cv-01448-TIV     Document 1      Filed 07/24/2009     Page 11 of 11\nDated: July 24, 2009  Respectfully submitted, \n~~ \nAlexandra C.

Logory and members of\nthe class were subject to a mandatory delousing procedure by Defendant as part of their \nadmission to the Susquehanna County Correctional Facility (“SCCF”).  Logory contends that\nDefendant’s delousing policy violates his right to refuse unwanted medical treatment\nprotected by the  Fourteenth Amendment and that based on the undisputed facts, he is\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law on the issue of liability pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §\n1983.1  Defendant seeks summary judgment in its favor, arguing that because its delousing\n1  Logory’s allegations that the delousing policy violates inmates’ rights to refuse\nunwanted medical treatment protected by the Fourteenth Amendment are contained in his\nReply Brief in Further Support of Plaintiff’s Motion for Class Certification (Doc. 42).  Logory\nacknowledges that his Complaint (Doc. 1) “arguably does not include a separate count\nasserting a Fourteenth Amendment claim.”  Id. at 5 n.5.   However, he asserts that “the\nparties conferred and agreed that rather than submitting an Amended Complaint, Plaintiff\nwould explain the scope of the delousing claim in this submission and that Defendant\n\npolicy is reasonably related to a legitimate penological objective, it is valid under the\nstandard established by Turner v. Safely, 482 U.S. 89, 107 S. Ct. 2254, 96 L. Ed. 2d 64\n(1987).  Because Defendant’s delousing policy was reasonably related to its legitimate\ninterest in maintaining a healthy and sanitary facility, Defendant’s motion for summary\njudgment will be granted with respect to the constitutionality of the delousing policy and\nLogory’s motion for partial summary judgment will be denied.  Defendant’s motion for\nsummary judgment with respect to disqualification of the testimony of Logory’s expert\nwitness will be denied.  Finally, Defendant’s motion to decertify class and Logory’s motion\nto exclude Defendant’s expert testimony will be denied as moot.\nBACKGROUND\nA. Factual Background\n Defendant’s policies and procedures require inmates to undergo a delousing\nprocedure upon admission to SCCF if they are first subjected to a strip search. (Doc. 85,\nPl.’s Statement of Material Facts, “Pl.’s SMF,” ¶ 10.)  In effect, almost all new admissions\nto SCCF are strip searched.  (Pl.’s SMF, ¶ 18.)  \nIt is undisputed that there have been at least three (3) reported cases of lice at SCCF\nin the past eight (8) to nine (9) years.  (Pl.’s SMF, ¶ 22.)   Dr.  Hassan Khalil, medical doctor\nat SCCF from 1999 to October 2008, testified that he did not see an “outbreak” of lice\nduring his employment there but did have “a few inmates with head lice.”  (Pl.’s SMF, ¶ 23.) \nDefendant produced records “concerning the presence of head lice at the facility, which\nnoted the following: on December 1, 2008, “[a]ll females in MZ on medical isolation;” on\nwould not contest Plaintiff’s right to make any argument about delousing.” Id.  \n2\n\nDecember 10, 2008, five (5) inmates were checked for head lice by the facility’s nurse and\nwere found to be free and clear; on March 20, 2011, an inmate was rechecked for head lice\nand was found to be clear; and on November 16, 2011, head lice were found on the hair\nof an inmate and the inmate was placed in isolation while two other inmates were checked\nand found to be free and clear of head lice.  (Pl.’s SMF, ¶ 26; Doc. 83, Ex. 17.)\nThe medical personnel and doctors employed at SCCF during the class period were\nunaware of the delousing procedures used  by the Corrections Officers (COs).  (Pl.’s SMF,\n¶ 29-30.)  During the delousing procedure at SCCF, detainees were sprayed with Liceall,\na delousing fluid, on the “hair, chest, underarms, [and] privates.”  (Pl.’s SMF, ¶ 33.)  The\nspray device used by SCCF to dispense Liceall is unapproved by the manufacturer.  (Pl.’s\nSMF, ¶ 37.) The COs at SCCF did not comply with all of the directions on the Liceall label\nin their use of the product.  (Pl.’s SMF, ¶¶ 35, 37-38, 40.)  Specifically, COs did not\nuniformly allow the Liceall solution to remain on the inmates’ bodies as indicated, despite\ntheir training to do so.  (Pl.’s SMF, ¶ 35, Defendant’s Statement of Material Facts, “Def.’s\nSMF,” ¶ 8.)  In addition, COs did not spend extra time combing out the spray or any\npossible nits or lice after the initial application of Liceall and the shower process. (Pl.’s SMF,\n¶40.)   Failure to follow the Liceall directions impacts the effectiveness of the delousing\nprocess.  (Pl.’s SMF, ¶ 39.)    \nSCCF Warden Nicholas Conigliaro issued a memo on December 27, 2011, stating\nthat COs were to start using  Pre-Emptive Strike, a different delousing product, as opposed\nto Liceall.  (Doc. 81, 27; Doc. 84, Ex. 26.)  Conigliaro’s memo stated that “[t]he Intake\nProcess will remain the same with the exception of the delousing delivery system.”  (Doc.\n84, Ex. 26.)  Section 16.5 of the SCCF Policy and Procedures Manual describes the\n3\n\ndelousing procedure as of December 27, 2011, as follows: “[f]ollowing the search, the new\ncommitment will be handed approximately one (1) once [sic] of non-toxic, all natural, Pre-\nEmptive Strike everyday lice control shampoo to utilize during their initial intake shower.” \n(Doc. 84, Ex. 27.)\nMr. Logory was admitted to SCCF on June 18, 2008, on misdemeanor charges of\ndriving under the influence.  (Pl.’s SMF, ¶ 41.)  After being strip searched, he was told to\nstep into the shower and  was “forced to be sprayed with some chemical” and subsequently \nto take a brief shower.  (Pl.’s SMF, ¶ 46.)  During the delousing procedure the COs did not\nexplain what they were doing to Logory, and the chemical spray was “uncomfortable” and\n“unknown.”  (Pl.’s SMF, ¶ 47.)  Logory testified that the experience of being deloused and\nadmission to SCCF was distressing.  (Pl.’s SMF, ¶ 48.)  Logory believes that the class\nperiod  should  end  as  of  December  27,  2011  because  he  does  not  contest  the\nconstitutionality of SCCF’s delousing policy as of December 27, 2011.  (Doc. 81, 20.)    \nB. Procedural History\nMr. Logory filed a class action complaint against Defendant on July 24, 2009. (Doc.\n1.)  Defendant filed an answer to the complaint on September 23, 2009.  On August 31,\n2010, Logory moved for class certification, which was eventually granted in part on October\n6, 2011.  (Docs. 9 and 10.)  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(3),\nthe Court certified a class action on behalf of:  \nAll  persons  who  have  been  placed  into  custody  of  the\nSusquehanna County Jail after being sentenced or as pre-trial\ndetainees  who  were  deloused  upon  their  entry  into  the\nSusquehanna County Jail. The Class period commences on or\nabout July 24, 2007 and extends to the date on which the\nDefendant is enjoined from, or otherwise ceases, enforcing its\nunconstitutional  policy,  practice  and  custom  of  delousing\n4\n\ndetainees absent reasonable suspicion. Specifically excluded\nfrom the Class are Defendant and any and all of its respective\naffiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors, employees\nor assignees.\n(Doc. 51.)   After class certification, discovery ensued.  The Court granted a motion\nto stay proceedings pending appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals on December 6,\n2012.  (Doc. 57.)  On January 19, 2012, the Third Circuit of Appeals denied Defendant’s\npetition for leave to appeal pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f). (Doc. 58.)   \nDefendant moved for summary judgment (Doc. 73) and Logory moved for partial\nsummary judgment (Doc. 74) on June 12, 2013.  Both parties filed briefs in opposition to\nthe other party’s motion on July 23, 2013.  (Docs. 89 and 94.)  Defendant also filed a motion\nto decertify class (Doc. 93) while Logory filed a motion to exclude testimony of Defendant’s\nexpert Anthony Pizon, M.D. (Doc. 88) on July 23, 2013.  Both parties filed reply briefs\nregarding their respective motions for summary judgment and partial summary judgment\non August 7, 2013. (Docs. 98 and 97.)  Defendant also filed a brief in opposition to Logory’s\nmotion to exclude the expert testimony of Dr. Pizon on that same date. (Doc. 99.) \nTherefore, the motions for summary judgement and partial summary judgment, Defendant’s\nmotion to decertify class, and Logory’s motion to exclude Dr. Pizon’s expert testimony are\nripe for disposition. \nDISCUSSION\nA.  Legal Standard\nSummary judgment shall be granted “if the movant shows that there is no genuine\ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” \nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  “Summary judgment is appropriate when ‘the pleadings, depositions,\n5\n\nanswers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show\nthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled\nto a judgment as a matter of law.’”  Wright v. Corning, 679 F.3d 101, 103 (3d Cir. 2012)\n(quoting Orsatti v. N.J. State Police, 71 F.3d 480, 482 (3d Cir. 1995)).  A fact is material if\nproof of its existence or nonexistence might affect the outcome of the suit under the\napplicable substantive law.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).\nWhere there is no material fact in dispute, the moving party need only establish that\nit is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  See Edelman v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., 83 F.3d\n68, 70 (3d Cir. 1996).  However, where there is a disputed issue of material fact, summary\njudgment is appropriate only if the factual dispute is not a genuine one.  Anderson, 477 U.S.\nat 248.  An issue of material fact is genuine if “a reasonable jury could return a verdict for\nthe nonmoving party.”  Id.  Where there is a material fact in dispute, the moving party has\nthe initial burden of proving that: (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact and (2) the\nmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  See 2D Charles Alan Wright &\nArthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2727 (2d ed. 1983).  The moving party\nmay present its own evidence or, where the non-moving party has the burden of proof,\nsimply point out to the court that “the non-moving party has failed to make a sufficient\nshowing on an essential element of her case.”  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323\n(1986).\n“When considering whether there exist genuine issues of material fact, the court is\nrequired to examine the evidence of record in the light most favorable to the party opposing\nsummary judgment, and resolve all reasonable inferences in that party's favor.”  Wishkin\nv. Potter, 476 F.3d 180, 184 (3d Cir. 2007).  Once the moving party has satisfied its initial\n6\n\nburden, the burden shifts to the non-moving party to either present affirmative evidence\nsupporting its version of the material facts or to refute the moving party's contention that the\nfacts entitle it to judgment as a matter of law.  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 256–57.  The Court\nneed not accept mere conclusory allegations, whether they are made in the complaint or\na sworn statement.  Lujan v. Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n, 497 U.S. 871, 888 (1990).\n“To prevail on a motion for summary judgment, the non-moving party must show\nspecific facts such that a reasonable jury could find in that party's favor, thereby establishing\na genuine issue of fact for trial.”  Galli v. N.J. Meadowlands Comm'n, 490 F.3d 265, 270 (3d\nCir. 2007) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)).  “While the evidence that the non-moving party\npresents  may  be  either  direct  or  circumstantial,  and  need  not  be  as  great  as  a\npreponderance, the evidence must be more than a scintilla.”  Id. (quoting Hugh v. Butler\nCnty. Family YMCA, 418 F.3d 265, 267 (3d Cir. 2005)).  In deciding a motion for summary\njudgment, “the judge's function is not himself to weigh the evidence and determine the truth\nof the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.”  Anderson, 477\nU.S. at 249.\nWhere cross-motions for summary judgment are filed, as is the case here, the\nsummary judgment standard remains the same. Lawrence v. City of Phila., 527 F.3d 299,\n310 (3d Cir. 2008).  Of course, when presented with cross motions for summary judgment,\nthe Court must and does consider the motions separately. See Williams v. Phila. Hous.\nAuth., 834 F.Supp. 794, 797 (E.D. Pa. 1993), aff'd, 27 F.3d 560 (3d Cir. 1994).\nB. Summary Judgment Motions\n1.  Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment\nAs noted, Defendant moved for summary judgment on June 12, 2013.  First,\n7\n\nDefendant asserts that the delousing portion of SCCF’s strip search policy is\nconstitutional under Florence v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders of Burlington, 132 S. Ct\n1510, 182 L. Ed. 2d 566 (2013).  Second, Defendant contends that the delousing portion\nof SCCF’s strip search policy is constitutional under the standard set forth in Turner v.\nSafely, 482 U.S. 78, 107 S. Ct. 2254, 96 L. Ed. 2d 64 (1987).  Third, Defendant\ncontends that the decision of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Russell v.\nRichards, 384 F. 3d 444 (7th Cir. 2004) is “precedential and controlling.”  (Doc. 78, 4.) \nFinally, Defendant requests that the court disqualify the testimony of Logory’s expert, Dr.\nMichael R. Greenberg.         \n2. Logory’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to Liability\nLogory’s motion for partial summary judgment was also filed on June 12, 2013. \nLogory seeks a declaratory judgement that Defendant’s policy and practice of requiring\nsentenced and pretrial detainees to undergo the mandatory delousing procedure from\nJuly 24, 2007, to December 26, 2011, violates the Fourteenth Amendment.  In support,\nLogory contends that the Defendant’s policy is unconstitutional under Turner because:\n(1) Defendant cannot demonstrate that the policy was rationally related to its interest in\nmaintaining a healthy and sanitary facility by preventing outbreaks of lice; (2) the burden\non SCCF of accommodating inmates’ rights to refuse treatment is slight; and (3) an\nalternative approach of confining high-risk inmates and offering other inmates the choice\nto undergo delousing accommodates inmates’ rights without impacting SCCF’s valid\npenological objectives.  According to Logory, since there are no material facts in dispute\nregarding the SCCF’s delousing policy, summary judgment in his favor on liability is\nappropriate.    \n8\n\nC. Analysis\nSection 1983 provides that “[e]very person who, under color of any statute,\nordinance, regulation, custom, or usage ... subjects, or causes to be subjected, any\ncitizen . . . or other person . . . to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities\nsecured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured, . . .” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983.  “To establish liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, a plaintiff must show that the\ndefendants, acting under color of law, violated the plaintiff's federal constitutional or\nstatutory rights, and thereby caused the complained of injury.” Elmore v. Cleary, 399\nF.3d 279, 281 (3d Cir. 2005) (citing Sameric Corp. of Del., Inc. v. City of Phila., 142 F.3d\n582, 590 (3d Cir. 1998)).  A municipality may be liable under § 1983 if the governmental\nbody itself “subjects” a person to a deprivation of rights or “causes” a person “to be\nsubjected” to such deprivation. See Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436\nU.S. 658, 692, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611 (1978).  A plaintiff seeking to impose\nliability on local governments under § 1983 must prove that “action pursuant to official\nmunicipal policy” caused their injury. Monell, 436 U.S. at 691, 694, 98 S. Ct. at 2037.\n1. Florence Is Not Determinative\nDefendant first argues that SCCF’s delousing procedure is constitutional in light\nof the Supreme Court’s decision in Florence v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders of Burlington,\n132 S. Ct 1510, 182 L. Ed. 2d 566 (2013).  The Supreme Court granted certiorari in\nFlorence to address whether the Fourth Amendment required COs to exempt some\ndetainees who were to be admitted to the jail’s general population from the search at\nissue.  Id. at 1515.  Admission to the jail included a requirement that “every arrestee . . .\nshower with a delousing agent.”  Id. at 1514.  The Supreme Court concluded that the\n9\n\nsearch at issue in Florence “struck a reasonable balance between inmate privacy and\nthe needs of the institution.”  Id. at 1523.  Because the issue here is not inmate privacy\nbut rather the constitutionality of Defendant’s delousing policy in light of inmates’ right to\nbe free from unwanted medical treatment under the Fourteenth Amendment,\nDefendant’s motion for summary judgment will not be granted on this ground.  \n2.  Application of the Factors Identified in Turner \nInmates have a right to refuse unwanted medical treatment under the Fourteenth\nAmendment of the U.S. Constitution.  See Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 221-22, \n110 S. Ct 1028, 108 L. Ed. 2d 178 (1990); Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497\nU.S. 261, 278, 110 S. Ct. 2841, 111 L. Ed. 2d 224 (1990); White v. Napoleon, 897 F.2d\n103, 113 (3d Cir. 1990).  When an inmate or detainee alleges that his constitutional\nrights have been violated by a prison regulation, the regulation is valid if it is “reasonably\nrelated to legitimate penological interests.”  Turner, 482 U.S. at 89.  See also Harper,\n494 U.S. at 224 (“[T]he standard of review we adopted in Turner applies to all\ncircumstances in which the needs of prison administration implicate constitutional\nrights.”).2\nLogory contends that Defendant’s policy of spraying inmates with Liceall\n2 In addition to arguing that Defendant’s delousing policy is invalid under Turner,\nLogory also advances arguments under the standard set forth in White v. Napoleon, 897\nF.2d 103 (3d Cir. 1990).  White was decided by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals on\nFebruary 23, 1990, four (4) days before Harper was decided by the Supreme Court.  As\nindicated in Harper, the standard articulated in Turner governs this case, and Logory’s\narguments pursuant to the standard set forth in White will not be considered further. See\nalso Iseley v. Dragovich, 236 F. Supp. 2d 472, 476 (E.D. Pa. 2002) (“The proper inquiry is\n‘whether the regulation [at issue] is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests’”\nunder the Turner factors). \n10\n\nconstitutes unwanted medical treatment.  Defendant acknowledges that “[b]oth medical\nexperts in this matter have testified that the use of Liceall is a “medical treatment” for the\ncondition of pediculosis.” (Doc. 78, 15.)  Although the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals\nin Russell  “assum[ed] without deciding” that use of Liceall constitutes medical\ntreatment, the Court is not convinced that it does.  See Russell, 384 F.3d at 447. \nHowever, even if the Court did find that SCCF’s delousing policy qualifies as medical\ntreatment, the policy is constitutional because it reasonably relates to the SCCF’s\nlegitimate penological interest in maintaining a healthy and sanitary facility.  \nIn Turner, the Supreme Court describes various factors “relevant to determining\nthe reasonableness of a prison regulation. . . .”  See Turner, 482 U.S. at 89-90.  Harper\nspecifies that three of the factors described in Turner are relevant to determining\nwhether a prison policy infringes on inmates’ right to be free from unwanted medical\ntreatment.  See Harper, 494 U.S. at 224.  First, “‘there must be a ‘valid, rational\nconnection’ between the prison regulation and the legitimate governmental interest put\nforward to justify it.’” Id. at 224-25 (quoting Turner, 482 U.S. at 89).  The burden is on the\nparty defending the policy to demonstrate that the policy’s drafters “‘could rationally have\nseen a connection’ between the policy and the interest.”  Wolf v. Ashcroft, 297 F.3d 305,\n308 (3d Cir. 2002) (citing Waterman v. Farmer, 183 F.3d 208, 217-18 (3d Cir. 1999)). \nSecond, courts should consider “‘the impact accommodation of the asserted\nconstitutional right will have on guards and other inmates, and on the allocation of prison\nresources generally.’” Harper, 494 U.S. at 225 (quoting Turner, 482 U.S. at 90).  Third,\n“‘the absence of ready alternatives is evidence of the reasonableness of a prison\nregulation.’” Id.  However, consideration of ready alternatives is not “a ‘least restrictive\n11\n\nalternative’ test: prison officials do not have to set up and then shoot down every\nconceivable alternative method of accommodating the claimant’s constitutional\ncomplaint.” Turner, 482 U.S. at 90-91 (internal citations omitted). \nThe Third Circuit Court of Appeals treats the initial Turner factor as a threshold\ninquiry.  “The first factor is ‘foremost’ in the sense that a rational connection is a\nthreshold requirement—if the connection is arbitrary or irrational, then ‘the regulation\nfails, irrespective of whether the other factors tilt in its favor.’” Wolf, 297 F.3d at 310\n(quoting Shaw v. Murphy, 532 U.S. 223, 229–30, 121 S. Ct. 1475, 149 L. Ed. 2d 420\n(2001)).  If a defendant satisfies his initial burden of showing a valid, rational connection\nbetween the regulation and a legitimate penological interest, this “‘commences rather\nthan concludes [the] inquiry’” and courts must “proceed to consider the remaining Turner\nfactors in order to draw a conclusion as to the policy's overall reasonableness.”  Wolf,\n297 F.3d at 310 (quoting DeHart v. Horn, 227 F.3d 47, 53 (3d Cir. 2000) (en banc)). \nApplying the Turner factors to the case at hand, Defendant’s motion for summary\njudgment will be granted with respect to the constitutionality of the delousing policy\nbecause it is reasonably related to SCCF’s legitimate penological interest in maintaining\na healthy and sanitary facility and avoiding outbreaks of lice.\na.  There is a Valid, Rational Connection between the SCCF’s\nDelousing Policy and a Legitimate Governmental Interest \nWith respect to the first Turner factor, it is not disputed that SCCF has a\nlegitimate interest in maintaining a sanitary facility.  (Doc. 89, 3.)  However, Logory \ncontends that the threshold inquiry under the first Turner factor is not satisfied because\nDefendant cannot establish that SCCF’s delousing policy was “actually designed to\n12\n\nprotect” or “in fact protects” this interest.  (Doc. 89, 4.)  Logory also argues that the\ndelousing policy is unnecessary because he does not consider three (3) cases of lice at\nthe facility in eight (8) to nine (9) years sufficient to justify implementation of a delousing\npolicy.  (Doc 89, 3; Doc. 81, 6-8.)  Further, Logory contends that the delousing\nprocedure itself was ineffective because the COs at SCCF did not comply with the\nmanufacturer’s directions in their use of Liceall (Doc 89, 3; Doc. 81, 9-12.) \nDefendant contends that the connection between preventative lice treatment and\nthe goal of maintaining a healthy and sanitary facility is clear and rational.  (Doc. 78, 10.) \nIn response to Logory’s assertion that delousing is unnecessary, Defendant does not\ndispute the number of recorded instances of lice at SCCF, but argues both that “there is\nno magic number” of lice outbreaks in the prison setting that triggers the necessity of a\ndelousing policy, and that the low incidence of reported lice at the prison “may well be\nprecisely because of the Defendant’s routine delousing.”  (Doc. 98, 2.) \nA party’s initial burden under Turner is slight, and in certain instances “may be a\nmatter of common sense.”  Wolf, 297 F.3d at 308-09.  To be sure, a party must\ndemonstrate the rational connection between the policy and the interest by more than “‘a\nconclusory assertion,’” but a showing of actual or factual connection, as Logory\ncontends, is not required.  See Jones v. Brown, 461 F.3d 353, 360 (3d Cir. 2006)\n(quoting Wolf, 297 F.3d at 308).\nWhen a prison policy aims to minimize the risk of a harmful occurrence, to find a\nrational connection between the policy and the facility’s interest in preventing that\nharmful occurrence, there must be some “rational basis for believing there was a non-\nnegligible risk” that the harm will occur.  See Jones, 461 F.3d at 361 (finding no rational\n13\n\nrelationship between a prison’s policy of opening mail in the absence of inmate\naddressees and its interest in protecting the safety of the prison by reducing the risk of\nanthrax contamination two (2) years after the events of September 11, 2001 and of\nOctober of 2001, when letters containing anthrax spores were posted).  Here, the parties\ndo not dispute that there have been at least three (3) reported cases of lice at the prison\nduring the class period.  This is more than a “non-negligible risk” of a lice outbreak at the\nprison, and is therefore sufficient to demonstrate a rational connection between the\nprison’s delousing policy and its interest in maintaining a healthy and sanitary facility.  \nContrary to Logory’s contentions, the effectiveness of SCCF’s delousing policy as\nimplemented is not material to whether the policy's drafters could rationally have seen a\nconnection between the delousing policy and maintaining a healthy and sanitary facility\nunder to the initial Turner factor.  The parties agree that the COs did not uniformly follow\nthe manufacturers precise instructions for applying Liceall.  For instance, inmates were\nnot always instructed to leave the product in their hair for ten (10) minutes prior to\nshowering, and inmates were not subject to a combing out procedure afterwards. \nAlthough failure to precisely follow the Liceall directions may have made the delousing\nprocedure less effective than it could have been had COs strictly adhered to the\ninstructions, this failure to comply with the directions does not defeat the rational\nconnection between SCCF’s policy and its legitimate penological interest.  The Seventh\nCircuit Court of Appeals held that there was a rational connection between a jail’s\nlegitimate interests and its “prophylactic approach of giving a cup of delousing shampoo\nto each inmate when he arrives at the jail and instructs him to use it in the shower,”\ndespite the fact that COs did not abide by the manufacturer’s directions.  See Russell,\n14\n\n384 F.3d at 448 (“[T]he policy might be more effective if the jail also instructed the\ninmate to leave the shampoo in his hair for the recommended period of 10 minutes . . .\nand/or supplied a follow-up dose as recommended by the manufacturer.”).  \nLogory argues that Russell should be distinguished from the case at hand\nbecause in Russell inmates were given Liceall in a disposable cup, as opposed to being\nsprayed with it before a shower.  The Court already found that the difference between a\npolicy requiring self application of delousing shampoo followed by a supervised shower\nand being sprayed with a delousing shampoo followed by an unsupervised shower is de\nminimus and does not “materially alter the Fourth Amendment analysis.”  Logory v.\nCounty of Susquehanna, 277 F.R.D. 135, 142 (M.D. Pa. 2011).  Similarly, in the context\nof a Fourteenth Amendment analysis, this difference in method of application does not\ngreatly impact the determination of whether there is a rational connection between a\nprison’s policy and its legitimate penological interest.  \nLogory also attempts to distinguish Russell by highlighting that the prison in that\ncase had “endured a number of lice outbreaks in the past,” which demonstrated that the\nrisk of lice was “more than an abstract possibility.”  Id. at 448-49.  He argues that\nDefendant cannot make a similar demonstration about the possibility of a lice outbreak\nat SCCF.  (Doc. 89, 9.)  Because the court did not specify that record of a precise\nnumber lice outbreaks was necessary to find that the prison policy was valid in Russell, \nthe Court agrees with Defendant that this potential difference is insufficient to distinguish\nthe two cases.  Furthermore, the three (3) reported cases of lice at SCCF during the\nclass period demonstrate that a lice outbreak was more than an “abstract” or theoretical\npossibility at the facility.     \n15\n\n   b. Accommodating Inmates’ Right to Refuse Unwanted Medical\nTreatment Would Substantially Burden Defendant\nWith respect to the second relevant Turner factor, Logory suggests that SCCF’s\ncurrent delousing policy shows that inmates’ right to refuse unwanted medical treatment\ncan be accommodated without substantially burdening the guards, inmates, and\nallocation of SCCF resources generally.  (Doc. 89, 5.)  Alternatively, Logory suggests\nthat Defendant could have implemented a delousing protocol “whereby detainees whom\nCorrections Officers actually suspected were infected with lice would be placed in\nisolation until they could be seen by medical personnel, and upon a finding that they\nwere in fact infected with lice, these inmates would be treated.”  Id.  Logory relies on the\nexpert report of Dr. Greenberg for this suggestion. (Doc. 81, Ex. 21).  Further, Logory\ncontends that this alternative procedure is feasible because SCCF “already has facilities\navailable to isolate inmates if necessary for medical conditions and new admissions are\nroutinely seen by medical staff.” (Doc. 81, 29.)   In addition, Logory suggests that\ninmates could be given the option of showering with a delousing solution.  (Doc. 81, 29.) \nAccording to Defendant, “[i]f it is determined that an inmate had head-lice, he or\nshe is placed into isolation . . . [and] is not returned to the general population until he or\nshe is cleared by medical.”  (Doc. 83, Ex. 20 ¶ 21).  However, SCCF does not have the\nphysical space to individually isolate all incoming inmates and detainees until they are\nexamined by a physician to determine whether they harbor lice.  (Doc. 98, Ex. A ¶ 10.) \nSpecifically, Warden Conigliaro states that SCCF only has two (2) isolation cells, and the\nonly other available space in the prison that could accommodate individual isolation prior\nto a medical examination is the “special housing” block.  Id. at ¶¶ 10-11.  For security\n16\n\nreasons, Defendant notes that detainees cannot be housed in the “special housing”\nblock for this purpose.  Id.  Further, according to Conigliaro, more than fifty (50) percent\nof incoming detainees are either dirty in appearance, homeless, have a history of\nintravenous drug use, are incoming from overcrowded conditions, or are admitted due to\nalcohol related offenses, and that, according to Logory’s expert, all of these people\nwould require isolation because they would qualify as “high risk.”  Id. at ¶¶ 4-5.  Logory\nhas failed to offer evidence supporting his contention that it would not be substantially\nburdensome for SCCF to isolate all high-risk incoming detainees.  Therefore, despite\nDefendant’s evidence to the contrary, Logory has failed to offer evidence demonstrating\nthat his proposed method of accommodating inmates’ rights would not substantially\nburden other inmates, staff, and allocation of SCCF resources generally under the\nsecond relevant Turner factor.    \nFurther, if Defendant allowed inmates the right to refuse delousing, this would\nalso result in a substantial burden on other inmates, guards, and prison resources\ngenerally.  Given the option, infected incoming inmates could elect not to treat\nthemselves with Liceall, enter the general prison population with lice, and expose other\ninmates and staff to infestation.  As the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals explained in\nRussell, “[p]ermitting the individual inmate to reject the delousing shampoo thus would\nplace the health and sanitation of the other prisoners and jail staff at risk . . . .” Russell,\n384 F.3d at 449.   Therefore, accommodating inmates’ rights by offering them the option\nof using delousing shampoo would be a substantial burden for Defendant.  \nFinally, with respect to Logory’s initial argument that SCCF’s current delousing\npolicy accommodates inmates’ rights without substantially burdening Defendant, the\n17\n\nCourt agrees with Defendant that SCCF’s delousing policy did not change significantly\nwhen Liceall was replaced by Pre-Emptive Strike.  Beyond product name, it is not clear\nthat there is a material difference between the two delousing products.3  Therefore, it\nappears that the only remaining difference between the delousing policy at issue and the\npolicy in place as of December 27, 2011, is the method of application of the delousing\nsolution: Liceall was sprayed on inmates and Pre-Emptive Strike is dispensed to\nprisoners in a disposable cup.  As noted above, this difference is de minimus and thus\ndoes not represent an accommodation of inmates’ right to be free from unwanted\nmedical treatment.  \nc. Reasonable Alternatives \nUnder the final Turner factor, the absence of ready alternatives to a given prison\nregulation is evidence of the reasonableness of the regulation. See Turner, 482 U.S. at\n90.  “By the same token, the existence of obvious, easy alternatives may be evidence\nthat the regulation is not reasonable, but is an ‘exaggerated response’ to prison\nconcerns.”  Id.  More specifically, “if an inmate claimant can point to an alternative that\nfully accommodates the prisoner’s rights at de minimis cost to valid penological interests,\na court may consider that as evidence that the regulation does not satisfy the\nreasonable relationship standard.”  Id. at 90-91.  \nThe parties arguments under the final Turner factor overlap with those made with\nrespect to the second relevant factor.  In terms of the availability of reasonable\n3 Logory contends that Pre-Emptive Strike differs from Liceall because it has not\nbeen approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). (Doc. 83, Ex. 21.) The Court\ndoes not find this distinction to be sufficiently meaningful. \n18\n\nalternatives, in addition to the approach advanced by Logory’s expert addressed above,\nLogory seems to assert that the policies of other correctional facilities in the state\nrepresent reasonable alternatives to SCCF’s disputed policy.  Specifically, he contends\nthat “it is significant that other Pennsylvania Correctional Facilities do not require\ninmates to submit to a delousing medical procedure upon admission.”  (Doc. 81, 17.)  In\nsupport of this position, Logory references a number of different policies from\ncorrectional facilities across the state that differ from the policy employed at SCCF.  \nBecause consideration of ready alternatives is not a “least restrictive alternative”\ntest, the fact that other prisons in the state employ different delousing procedures does\nnot alone demonstrate that Defendant’s delousing policy is an exaggerated response to\nprison concerns, rendering it unconstitutional.  Moreover, the policies of the other\nfacilities referenced by Logory either afford inmates the option of applying a delousing\nsolution or simply decline to engage in a delousing procedure altogether.  (Pl.’s SMF ¶¶\n63-66.)  Just as allowing inmates the option of treating themselves with delousing\nsolution poses a substantial burden on Defendant as noted above, it would also pose\nmore than a “de minimis” cost to the valid penological interest of SCCF of maintaining a\nhealthy and sanitary facility by preventing outbreaks of lice.  The same reasoning applies\nto the alternative policy of declining to implement a delousing procedure altogether. \nTherefore, in the absence of an alternative that fully accommodates inmates’ rights at a\nde minimis cost to valid penological interests, Defendant’s policy appears to be\nreasonable under the final Turner factor despite the fact that other facilities in the state\nemploy different delousing procedures.\n    \n19\n\n3.   Plaintiff’s Expert is Not Disqualified\nThe Court considered the expert testimony of Dr. Greenberg in deciding to grant\nDefendant’s motion for summary judgment with respect to the constitutionality of the\nSCCF delousing policy under the Fourteenth Amendment and to deny Logory’s motion\nfor partial summary judgment.  As such, Defendant’s motion to for summary judgment is\ndenied with respect to disqualification of Dr. Greenberg’s expert testimony.  \nD.  Logory’s Motion to Exclude Defendant’s Expert\nLogory moved to exclude testimony of Defendant’s expert Anthony Pizon, M.D.\non July 23, 2013 on the basis that he fails to exhibit the proper qualifications to discuss\nappropriate procedures at Defendant’s correctional facility.  Because the Court will grant\nDefendant’s motion for summary judgment without relying on this testimony, Logory’s\nmotion to exclude testimony of Defendant’s expert will be denied as moot.  \nE. Defendant’s Motion to Decertify Class\nBecause the Court will grant summary judgment for Defendant with respect to the\nconstitutionality of SCCF’s delousing policy, Defendant’s motion to decertify class will be\ndenied as moot. \nCONCLUSION\nFor all the above reasons, Defendant’s motion for summary judgment (Doc. 77)\nwill be granted with respect to the constitutionality of the delousing policy and denied\nwith respect to disqualification of Logory’s expert witness.  Logory’s partial motion for\nsummary judgment (Doc. 80) will be denied.  Logory’s motion to exclude the expert\ntestimony of Dr. Pizon (Doc. 88) and Defendant’s motion to decertify class (Doc. 93) will\nbe denied as moot.   \n20\n\nAn appropriate Order follows.\n September 13, 2013                               /s/ A.

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA\nRONELD LOGORY,\nPlaintiff, CIVIL ACTION NO. 3:09-CV-1448\nv.\n(JUDGE CAPUTO)\nTHE COUNTY OF SUSQUEHANNA,\nDefendant.\nMEMORANDUM\nPresently before the Court is Plaintiff’s Motion for Class Certification.  (Doc. 30). \nRoneld Logory (“Plaintiff”) seeks class certification on behalf of a class of others similarly\nsituated  against the County of Susquehanna.  Plaintiff specifically maintains that (1)  the\nJail’s delousing policy is unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment; and (2) the Jail’s\ndelousing policy violates the detainees’ Fourteenth Amendment rights to refuse unwanted\nmedical treatment.  (Doc. 42 at 4).  This action is seeking declaratory and injunctive relief\nagainst these delousing procedures as well as compensatory damages.\nI. Background \nRoneld Logory was arrested for a misdemeanor offense on June 19, 2008.  He was\ndetained at Susquehanna County Correctional Facility (“SCCF”) where he was subjected to\na strip search and a delousing agent upon his arrival.  As a result of that treatment, Plaintiff\nfiled his Complaint on August 24, 2009, complaining that SCCF had implemented “a blanket\npolicy of delousing, showering and strip-searching all individuals who enter the custody of\nthe [SCCF] regardless of the nature of their charged crime and without the presence of\nreasonable suspicion to believe that the individual was concealing a weapon or contraband.” \n\n(Doc. 1 at ¶ 24).  Plaintiff initially sought to certify a class action comprised of “[a]ll persons\nwho have been placed into custody of the SCCF after being charged with misdemeanor\noffenses,  summary  offenses,  traffic  infractions,  family  court  violations  and/or  civil\ncommitments and were strip-searched upon their entry into the SCCF.”  (Doc. 1 at ¶ 9).    \nOn September 21, 2010, the Third Circuit held that blanket search policies of\narrestees held over in prison populations were inherently reasonable and thus not violative\nof the Fourth Amendment.  Florence v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders of Burlington, 621 F.3d\n296, 311 (3d Cir. 2010).  In light of this holding, Plaintiff abandoned his class claim as\npertaining to the strip-search policies, but instead proposed two new classes for certification:1 \n1) The Fourth Amendment Class–All persons who have been placed into\ncustody of the Susquehanna County Jail as pre-trial detainees who were\ndeloused upon their entry into the Susquehanna County Jail.  The Class period\ncommences on or about July 24, 2007 and extends to the date on which the\nDefendant is enjoined from, or otherwise ceases, enforcing its unconstitutional\npolicy,  practice  and  custom  of  delousing  detainees  absent  reasonable\nsuspicion.  Specifically excluded from the Class are Defendant and any and\nall  of  its  respective  affiliates,  legal  representatives,  heirs,  successors,\nemployees or assignees.\n2) The Fourteenth Amendment Class–All persons who have been placed into\ncustody of the Susquehanna County Jail after being sentenced or as pre-trial\ndetainees who were deloused upon their entry into the Susquehanna County\nJail.  The Class period commences on or about July 24, 2007 and extends to\nthe date on which the Defendant is enjoined from, or otherwise ceases,\n1Plaintiff offers these amended class definitions through his reply brief.  (Doc. 42).  This is    \n“procedurally appropriate, as the Court retains jurisdiction to modify the class until there is a\ndecision on the merits.”  Jordan v. Commonwealth Fin. Sys., 237 F.R.D. 132, 136 n.3 (E.D. Pa.\n2006) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(C)); Gulino v. Bd. of Educ., 201 F.R.D. 326, 330 n.3 (S.D.N.Y.\n2001) (allowing a class definition that was proposed in the plaintiffs' reply brief “in response to some\nof defendants' objections found in defendants' opposition briefs.”).  \n2\n\nenforcing  its  unconstitutional  policy,  practice  and  custom  of  delousing\ndetainees absent reasonable suspicion.  Specifically excluded from the Class\nare Defendant and any and all of its respective affiliates, legal representatives,\nheirs, successors, employees or assignees.\n(Doc. 42 at 4). \nSpecifically, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Plaintiff is seeking declaratory relief that\nthe SCCF delousing policies are unconstitutional, injunctive relief against the continuance\nof these policies, and compensatory damages for himself and other class members, as well\nas attorney fees and costs. \nII. Discussion \nA. Legal Standard \nRule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides for class action certification. \nUnder Rule 23(a), class certification may be appropriate if the following requirements are\nmet:\n(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable\n[(“numerosity”)], (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class\n[(“commonality”)], (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are\ntypical of the claims or defenses of the class [(“typicality”)], and (4) the\nrepresentative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the\nclass [(“adequacy of representation”)]. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a); In re Mercedes-Benz Antitrust Litig., 213 F.R.D. 180, 183 (D.N.J.\n2003).  Once the requirements of 23(a) are satisfied, the class may be certified if at least one\nof the three subsections of 23(b) are met.  In re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., 552 F.3d\n305, 309 n.6 (3d Cir. 2008).\nA court may certify a class action only if it “is satisfied, after a rigorous analysis, that\nthe [requirements of Rule 23] have been satisfied.”  Gen. Tel. Co. of the Sw. v. Falcon, 457\n3\n\nU.S. 147, 161 (1982).  In weighing the merits of a class certification, a “district court must\nmake whatever factual and legal inquiries are necessary and must consider all relevant\nevidence and arguments presented by the parties.”   Hydrogen Peroxide, 552 F.3d at 307. \nSpecifically,  a  certifying  court  must  find  that  each  element  of  Rule  23  is  met  by  a\npreponderance of evidence, and “must resolve all factual or legal disputes relevant to class\ncertification, even if they overlap with the merits--including disputes touching on elements\nof the cause of action.”  Id. at 305.  This reflects the notion that Rule 23 is more than a “mere\npleading standard,” and those “seeking class certification must affirmatively demonstrate his\ncompliance with the Rule.”  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 2551 (2011).\nB.  Certification Under Rule 23(a)\nHere, the Plaintiff seeks to certify both classes under Rule 23(b)(3), or (b)(2) in the\nalternative.  Therefore, as the moving party, the Plaintiff bears the burden of first showing\nthat the requirements of Rule 23(a) are satisfied, and then demonstrating that the elements\nof subsections (b)(2) or (b)(3) are met.  See Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591,\n613–14 (1997); Behrend v. Comcast Corp., No. 10-2865, 2011 WL 3678805, at *5 (3d Cir.,\nAug. 23, 2011).  \nThe “threshold requirements” of Rule 23(a) are referred to as (1) numerosity; (2)\ncommonality; (3) typicality; and (4) adequacy of representation.  Amchem, 521 U.S. at 613. \nEach requirement will be evaluated in turn.  For the reasons stated below, the Court will find\neach element of Rule 23(a) satisfied as to the Fourteenth Amendment Class, but will decline\nto certify the Fourth Amendment Class.  \n4\n\n(1.) Numerosity \nNumerosity under  Rule 23(a)(1) requires only that the class be “so numerous that\njoinder of all members is impracticable.”  Unfortunately, \"[n]o single magic number exists\nsatisfying the numerosity requirement.”  Florence v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders, No. 05-\n3619, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22152 at *18 (D.N.J. Mar. 20, 2008) (citation omitted). \nHowever, the Third Circuit has opined that while there is technically no minimum class size, \n“generally if the named plaintiff demonstrates that the potential number of plaintiffs exceeds\n40, the first prong of Rule 23(a) has been met.”  Stewart v. Abraham, 275 F.3d 220, 226-27\n(3d Cir. 2001).\nAll SCCF detainees who were strip searched were subjected to delousing procedures. \nDefendant admits that its “delousing procedure is, in fact, part of its strip search process.” \n(Doc. 49 at 14).  Therefore, it is necessary to determine how many such detainees were strip\nsearched over the period in question in order to determine whether numerosity is satisfied\nin the instant case.  From the record, it is unclear how many detainees actually entered the\nSCCF since July 24, 2007, much less how many of those were subjected to a strip search. \nHowever, it is clear that between June 2007 to March 25, 2010, at least one hundred and\nseventy (170) pre-trial detainees charged with summary offenses and misdemeanors were\nstrip searched out of five hundred and seven total pre-trial detainees over that period.  (Doc.\n38-3 at 2-3).     \nAs the Fourth Amendment Class would be comprised of pre-trial detainees who were\ndeloused upon entry to the jail, the Court concludes by a preponderance of the evidence that\nthis number easily exceeds forty (40) and thus numerosity is satisfied.  Moreover, as the\nFourteenth Amendment Class would be even broader in including pre-trial detainees as well\n5\n\nas sentenced prisoners, it is further apparent that this Class also easily satisfies numerosity. \nPlaintiff further avers that traditional joinder would be especially impractical in this\naction as “Class members are likely dispersed over a large geographic area, with some\nmembers residing outside of Susquehanna County and this Judicial District.  Furthermore,\nmany members of the Class are low-income persons, may not speak English, may not know\nof their rights and likely would have great difficulty in pursuing their rights individually.”  (Doc.\n1 at 4).  The Court agrees with this assessment and finds that it only bolsters a finding that\nnumerosity is satisfied.  Therefore, as the population of these classes well exceed the lower\nbounds of numerosity, and as regular joinder rules would be impractical, the numerosity\nrequirement of  Rule 23(a) has been easily satisfied for both potential classes. \n(2.) Commonality\nCommonality requires that “there are questions of law or fact common to the class.” \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2); Danvers Motor Co. v. Ford Motor Co., 543 F.3d 141, 148 (3d Cir.\n2008).  This “does not require an identity of claims or facts among class members; rather,\nthe commonality requirement will be satisfied if the named plaintiffs share at least one\nquestion of fact or law with the grievances of the prospective class.”  In re Ins. Brokerage\nAntitrust  Litigation,  579  F.3d  241,  264  (3d  Cir.  2009)  (quotations  omitted).    As  “the\nrequirement may  be satisfied by a single common issue, it is easily met . . .”  Baby Neal v.\nCasey, 43 F.3d 48, 56 (3d Cir. 1994).  \nHowever, the Supreme Court has recently opined that commonality is not the mere\nexistence of a classwide question, but instead the potential for a “classwide resolution.” \nWal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 2551 (2011).  “What matters to class\n6\n\ncertification . . . is not the raising of common 'questions' -- even in droves -- but, rather the\ncapacity of a classwide proceeding to generate common answers apt to drive the resolution\nof the litigation.”  Id. (citing Richard A. Nagareda, Class Certification in the Age of Aggregate\nProof, 84 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 97, 132 (2009)).     \n(a) The Fourth Amendment Class \nThe Fourth Amendment class seeks to represent solely pre-trial detainees who were\nsubjected to delousing upon their entry to the SCCF.  Specifically, Plaintiff is attempting to\nenjoin this delousing as an impermissible Fourth Amendment search.  \nReasonableness under the Fourth Amendment considers “the scope of the particular\nintrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place\nin which it is conducted.”  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979).  As delousing at the\nSCCF is predicated on an inmate’s being strip searched, Plaintiff argues that such delousing\nwas unreasonable in that a determination of whether a strip search should be conducted on\na pre-trial detainee has no bearing on whether a particular individual is a carrier of lice.     \nPlaintiff argues that the recent decision in Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders\nof Burlington should have no effect on the viability of the Fourth Amendment Class.  621\nF.3d 296 (3d Cir. 2010).  There, the Third Circuit held that strip searches of non-indictable\narestees,  absent  any  individualized  suspicion,  was  constitutional  under  the  Fourth\nAmendment.  Id. at 311.  Almost identical to the instant case, the searches considered in\nFlorence also employed a delousing component.  Id. at 300, 307 (requiring “arrestees to\nundress completely and submit to a visual observation of their naked bodies before taking\na supervised shower.”).   The Third Circuit specifically found that the Jails’ security interest\n7\n\noutweighed the inmates’ privacy interests, but declined to consider whether the searches\ncould be sustained on the Jails’ interest in preventing disease alone.  Id. at 307, 311 n.9.  \nAn overlap between a class certification requirement and the merits of a claim is no\nreason to decline to resolve relevant disputes if necessary to determine whether a class\ncertification requirement is met.  In re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., 552 F.3d 305, 316\n(3d Cir. 2008).  Such an inquiry “may include a ‘preliminary inquiry into the merits,’ and the\ncourt may ‘consider the substantive elements of the plaintiffs' case in order to envision the\nform that a trial on those issues would take.’”  Id. at 317 (citations omitted).  In as much, “a\ndistrict court errs as a matter of law when it fails to resolve a genuine legal or factual dispute\nrelevant to determining the requirements.”  Id. at 320.  Therefore, it is necessary for the\nCourt to evaluate whether this particular Class has a viable claim after the Third Circuit’s\nholding in Florence.    \nFlorence held explicitly that “the strip search procedures . . . at [the Prisons] are\nreasonable.”  Id. at 311.  As those procedures explicitly included a delousing, it is curious as\nto how Plaintiff could maintain a class premised on an alleged Fourth Amendment violation\nthat involving the very same procedures.  Plaintiff attempts to play up the differences\nbetween the two procedures, that Florence utilized a self-applied shampoo followed by a\nsupervised shower while the instant case concerns a delousing spray followed by an\nunsupervised shower.  It is true that Fourth Amendment reasonableness is a fact-specific\ninquiry, \"not capable of precise definition or mechanical application.\"  Id. at 301 (citing Bell\nv. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979)).  However, the Court agrees with the Defendant that\nthese are de minimus differences that do not materially alter the Fourth Amendment\n8\n\nanalysis.  \nMoreover, there is no component of the SCCF’s delousing procedure that would\nsomehow aggravate the invasiveness of the strip search that Florence deemed acceptable. \nWhile the Court agrees below that, for certification purposes, there is merit to the claim that\nsuch procedures could present unwarranted medical treatment, combining a delousing\ntreatment with a strip search does very little to broaden the scope of that particular\nintrusion–the search of the naked body.  The delousing procedure itself does not inherently\nincrease the exposure or duration of a strip search, and while the Plaintiff never specifies,\nthe Court is hard-pressed to determine exactly how delousing functionally exaggerates the\nscope of the approved strip search.  While perhaps a medical treatment, to characterize\ndelousing as an extension of the strip search appears redundant.   \nTherefore, relying on the Third Circuit’s holding that suspicionless searches of pre-trial\ndetainees including a delousing procedure is permissible absent particularized suspicion, \nthe Court finds no viable Fourth Amendment claim in the instant case.  As it cannot be said\nthat there is a common question of law as to the Fourth Amendment class, that Class fails\non the commonality prong and will not be certified.  \n(b) The Fourteenth Amendment Class\nThe Fourteenth Amendment Class seeks to include all pre-trial and sentenced\ndetainees who were subjected to delousing procedures upon their entry to the SCCF.\nWithin the class of detainees subjected to strip search procedures, commonality is\nhigh as each was subjected to the very same delousing procedure.  There is no evidence\nin the record that there was any differentiation whatsoever in the delousing process.  In fact,\nafter a rigorous analysis of the facts, the Court agrees by a preponderance of the evidence\n9\n\nthat the SCCF employed a policy of delousing each inmate who was strip searched.2  While\nDefendant argues that there are a multitude of reasons as to why an inmate would be strip\nsearched, each inmate who was striped searched was necessarily subjected to delousing\nwithout further inquiry. \nDefendant maintains that at the time of Plaintiff’s intake, the SCCF had a policy in\neffect  requiring  “individualized,  reasonable  suspicion  before  a  detainee  may  be  strip\nsearched.”  (Doc. 49 at 8).  The factors contributing to such a determination included:\nthe appearance and demeanor of the detainee, the nature of the charges\npending against the detainee, the detainee’s conduct during the period of\nconfinement, the  detainee’s prior  arrest  record  if  known,  and  any other\nreasonable  suspicion  based  upon  specific  circumstances  that  leads  the\ncorrections officer the suspect that the detainee is concealing weapons,\nevidence of a specific crime, controlled substances or other contraband.\n(Id. at 8-9).  Aside from potentially the appearance and demeanor of the detainee, none of\nthese factors speak to whether delousing, a necessary component of the strip search, is\nwarranted.  Specifically, the factors above appear to be wholly tailored towards drugs and\ncontraband and include no express medical determinations.  From the facts, it cannot be\nsaid that these detainees were deloused pursuant to any sort of individualized determination.\nAs such, a common, if not identical, set of facts applies to each member of this Class,\ncomprised of detainees who were automatically subjected to a delousing “regardless of\nwhether there is reason to believe that detainees have a medical condition that would benefit\n2In her deposition, Corrections Officer Smith denied that there would be reason to suspect\nthat someone who was strip searched was more likely to have lice.  Smith Dep., 44:22-45:1, June 25,\n2010.  Of course, the record well establishes that all strip searched detainees were deloused. \nConigliaro Dep., 86:2-6, Feb. 24 2010; Stewart Dep., 94:5-95:11 (affirming that for those detainees\nwho get strip searched, “there’s no attempt to determine whether they might be carrying parasites\nthat will require them to be deloused”); Hunsinger Dep., 18:8-11, April 13, 2010.   \n10\n\nfrom this medical treatment and without advising detainees of the scope of the medical\nprocedure or providing them with the opportunity to decline to undergo the procedure.”  (Doc.\n42 at 2).  Unlike Dukes, where commonality was destroyed where there was no “common\nmode of exercising discretion that pervade[d] the entire company,”  131 S.Ct. at 2554-55,\nhere there is a solid policy that applied directly to all potential class members.  See e.g.\nChurchill v. Cigna Corp., No. 10-6911, 2011 WL 3563489 at *4 (finding an indisputable\nnational policy necessarily ran inapposite to the Dukes holding). \nFlowing from these common facts is a common question of law–whether it was\nreasonable for the Defendant to automatically delouse  all  individuals who were strip\nsearched.  Even more importantly under the Dukes holding, this common question will be\nwholly satisfied by a singular answer.\nThe Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment confers the “right to refuse\nunwanted medical treatment, and . . . the right to sufficient information to intelligently\nexercise those rights.”  White v. Napoleon, 897 F.2d 103, 111 (3d Cir. 1990) (citations\nomitted).  In the prison setting, prisoners “retain a limited right to refuse treatment and a\nrelated right to be informed of the proposed treatment and viable alternatives.”  Id. at 113. \nWhile prisons can force medical procedures on prisoners where they are necessary in\nfurtherance of valid penological ends, prisoners still “have a right to such information as is\nreasonably necessary to make an informed decision to accept or reject proposed treatment,\nas well as a reasonable explanation of the viable alternative treatments that can be made\navailable in a prison setting.”  Id.  Flowing from this, the Fourteenth Amendment class clearly\nshares a common question of law–whether Defendant has “violated Plaintiff and the Class’s\n11\n\nright to refuse unwanted medical treatment.”  (Doc. 42 at 7).  \nDefendant cites a Seventh Circuit opinion for the proposition that delousing is clearly\nan allowable procedure tied to a jail’s legitimate interest in sanitary conditions.  Russell v.\nRichards, 384 F.3d 444 (7th Cir. 2004).  There, inmates were instructed to self-apply a\ndelousing shampoo, and they had the right to refuse.  Id. at 446.  That court accepted the\npremise that directing the use of shampoo did trigger the prisoners’ constitutional right to\nrefuse unwanted medical treatment.  Id. at 447.  From there, that court applied the factors\nset out in Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987), to determine whether the prison’s procedures\nwere “reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.”  Id. at 447-49.  On the particular\nfacts before that court, the judge concluded that “the record does not support the conclusion\nthat the jail's policy with respect to delousing shampoo amounts to an unreasonable intrusion\non an inmate's constitutional rights.”  Id. at 449.  As such a determination is highly fact-\nspecific, it is unclear at this juncture whether the same result would be had in the instant\ncase.  However, it is clear beyond a preponderance of evidence that the Plaintiff has a\nlegitimate claim under the law that is both common in law and fact to those of the overall\nproposed Class.    \nUnlike the Fourth Amendment claims, whether delousing absent necessity and\nwithout consent provides a triable issue under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Therefore, as\nthere are common questions of fact and law to the Fourteenth Amendment Class, the\ncommonality qualification is satisfied. \n(3.) Typicality\nRule 23(a)(3) requires that “the claims or defenses of the representative parties are\n12\n\ntypical of the claims or defenses of the class.”  This element appraises the alignment\nbetween the named plaintiff’s particular case and the claims of the other potential class\nmembers.  Stewart v. Abraham, 275 F.3d 220, 227 (3d Cir. 2001).  “The typicality criterion\nis intended to preclude certification of those cases where the legal theories of the named\nplaintiffs potentially conflict with those of the absentees by requiring that the common claims\nare comparably central to the claims of the named plaintiffs as to the claims of the\nabsentees.”  Baby Neal v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 57 (3d Cir. 1994).  “Factual differences will not\nrender a claim atypical if the claim arises from the same event or practice or course of\nconduct that gives rise to the claims of the class members, and if it is based on the same\nlegal theory.\"  Id. at 58 (citation omitted).    \nPlaintiff Logory’s interests are squarely aligned with those of the putative class.  For\nall intents and purposes, Logory’s claims arise out of the same exact course of conduct as\nthat of all of the other putative class members–a policy that strip searches necessitate\ndelousing regardless of any specific determinations.  In fact, the class is defined as a\nfunction of being subjected to identical treatment by SCCF employees.  While Plaintiff\nLogory’s alleged state of intoxication at his intake may have rendered him atypical as to his\ninitial claim of being subjected to a strip search absent cause, Plaintiff now only pursues\nclaims against the delousing procedure, and his status at intake is no longer relevant.  There\nis no evidence that he, or any detainee entering the facility, was deloused based on any\nparticularized determination of necessity.  Furthermore, while Plaintiff seeks to represent all\ninmates, both pre-trial and incarcerated, there is no indication that his delousing experience\nas a pre-trial detainee differs in any regard from that of an incarcerated inmate. \nAs such, the Court concludes that Plaintiff Logory’s claim is highly typical of those of\n13\n\nthe class generally, and this element of Rule 23(a) is satisfied.   \n(4.) Adequacy of Representation \nRule 23(a)(4) requires that “the representative part[y] will fairly and adequately protect\nthe  interests  of  the  class.”    This  requirement  has  been  interpreted  to  analyze  “the\nqualifications of the counsel to represent the class” and “to uncover conflicts of interest\nbetween named parties and the class they seek to represent.”  Barnes v. American Tobacco\nCo., 161 F.3d 127, 141 (3d Cir. 1998).  The Defendant has raised no challenge to this\nelement of the Rule 23(a) certification. \nUpon investigation of their credentials, Plaintiff’s counsel appears to be “qualified,\nexperienced, and generally able to conduct the proposed litigation.”  Wetzel v. Liberty Mut.\nIns. Co., 508 F.2d 239, 247 (3d Cir. 1975).  Plaintiff’s counsel state that they have “the\nresources, expertise and experience to successfully prosecute this action against the\nDefendant.”  (Doc. 1 at 5).  The Court agrees and further notes that all of the lawyers are\noverall accomplished and experienced, and at least one has extensive experience in the\nrealm of complex litigation.  As such, the Court finds no indication that the adequacy of\nrepresentation is lacking in any respect.  \nThe Court also finds that the named Plaintiff will adequately protect the interests of\nthe class.  Plaintiff Logory has sufficient interest in challenging the procedure and obtaining\ncompensation and his interests in no way diverge from those of the putative class. \nTherefore, the Court finds representation of this class adequate, and the requirements of\nRule 23(a) are fully satisfied in respect to the Fourteenth Amendment Class.    \n14\n\nC. Certification Under Rule 23(b)\nPlaintiff is primarily seeking class certification under the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure Rule 23(b)(3).  (Doc. 50 at 3).  However, in the alternative, Plaintiff seeks to certify\nthis class pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2).  \n(1.) Rule 23(b)(3)\nUnder Rule 23(b)(3), the Court must find that “questions of law or fact common to\nclass members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that\na class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the\ncontroversy.”    Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  23(b)(3).    Rule  23(b)(3)  therefore  adds  two  further\nrequirements  to the class action calculus: predominance and superiority.  \n(a) Predominance   \n“Predominance tests whether the proposed class is sufficiently cohesive to warrant\nadjudication by representation.”  In re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., 552 F.3d 305, 311\n(citation omitted).  This goes far beyond the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a), and\nrequires the district court to “formulate some prediction as to how specific issues will play out\nin order to determine whether common or individual issues predominate in a given case.” \nId. (quoting In re New Motor Vehicles Can. Exp. Antitrust Litig., 522 F.3d 6, 20 (1st Cir.\n2008)).  Specifically, \"[i]f proof of the essential elements of the cause of action requires\nindividual treatment, then class certification is unsuitable.\"  Id. (citing Newton v. Merrill Lynch,\nPierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 259 F.3d 154, 172 (3d Cir. 2001)). \n“[T]he task for plaintiffs at class certification is to demonstrate that the element of\n[their claim] is capable of proof at trial through evidence that is common to the class rather\n15\n\nthan individual to its members.  Deciding this issue calls for the district court's rigorous\nassessment of the available evidence and the method or methods by which plaintiffs\npropose to use the evidence to prove impact at trial.”  Id. at 311-12.  \nFollowing these standards, predominance is met in the instant case.  The nature of\nPlaintiff’s claim is precisely that all detainees inducted into the SCCF were treated exactly\nthe same.  From the factual record, it is evident that each detainee who was strip searched\nwas wholesale deloused, including those who evidently did not require the procedure.3  As\nsuch, the cause of action requires almost no individual treatment.  The very fact that SCCF’s\npolicy appears to have not made individualized determinations as to the necessity of\ndelousing is precisely what satisfies the predominance requirement in this action.  \nImportantly, this claim is easily capable of proof at trial through evidence common to\nthe class.  As the allegation is that all detainees were treated similarly unconstitutionally, this\naction especially lends itself to proof that is common to the class, and Plaintiff will attempt\nto prove this case in the form of prison policies and sworn testimony.  Factual questions as\nto the exact nature of this policy, its implementation, and its effects will be the same for each\nclass member and will thus predominate to a very high degree.  \nOther cases have met the predominance requirement on very similar theories.  In\nFlorence, the defendants argued that predominance was not satisfied under strip search\n3Deposition testimony indicates that individualized determinations were actually disregarded. \nIn his testimony, Corrections Officer Stewart affirmed that there was “no attempt to obtain\nreasonable suspicion to determine whether [inmates were] carrying parasites prior to delousing\nthem” and that the SCCF policy was “to delouse everyone regardless or what their answer to the\n[medical questions] may be.”  Stewart Dep. 94:23-95:11.  Defendant acknowledges that “the\ntestimony . . . clearly establishes that there is no separate delousing policy at the Susquehanna\nCounty Jail; no one is deloused unless he is strip searched.”  (Doc. 49 at 15).        \n16\n\nclaims  as  they  believed  each  potential  class  member  would  be  required  to  present\nindividualized proof of their specific damages.  Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of\nCounty of Burlington, No. 05-3619, 2008 WL 800970 at *13 (D.N.J. March 20, 2008).  That\ncourt disagreed, noting that “liability will seemingly boil down to . . . the intake procedures .\n. . . a common question and, as previously stated, subject to generalized proof.”  Id.  This is\nhighly analogous to the instant case, which will focus almost exclusively on the SCCF’s\nintake procedures.  However, even if more individualized calculations were necessary,\npredominance can still be satisfied.  Id; see also Gwiazdowski v. County of Chester, 263\nF.R.D. 178, 189 (E.D. Pa. 2009) (finding that where a delousing procedure was applied\npursuant to policy, “[p]laintiff will be able to show that she was searched through common\nrather than individual evidence.”).  Here, Plaintiff’s case will substantially center around such\npolicy, and the overall class action ranks high on the predominance scale. \nFinally, predominance also requires “that the alleged damages are capable of\nmeasurement on a class-wide basis using common proof.”  Behrend v. Comcast Corp., No.\n10-2865, 2011 WL 3678805 at *15 (3d Cir. Aug. 23, 2011).  As above, the inquiry similarly\nlooks to whether damages can be measured “on a class-wide basis using common proof.” \nId. at *18.  This is a determination that sits on a continuum as some individualization in\ndamages will not alone defeat certification.  Id.  However, as established, almost no\nindividualized determinations are necessary in the instant case.  Variation in damages is\nlikely to be very rare due to the dearth of reported injury in the record, and the rare individual\ncalculations that do arise are sure to be simple and isolated.  Therefore, as the putative class\nwill be wholly comprised of those who were subjected to the same procedure and suffered\n17\n\nessentially identical damages, the Court finds the predominance requirement is squarely\nsatisfied.  \n(b) Superiority \nPertinent to a finding of superiority is: “(A) the class members' interests in individually\ncontrolling the prosecution or defense of separate actions; (B) the extent and nature of any\nlitigation concerning the controversy already begun by or against class members; (C) the\ndesirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum;\nand (D) the likely difficulties in managing a class action.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). \nSpecifically, the superiority requirement asks a trial court to \"balance, in terms of fairness\nand efficiency, the merits of a class action against those of alternative available methods of\nadjudication.\"  Danvers Motor Co. v. Ford Motor Co., 543 F.3d 141, 149 (3d Cir. 2008)\n(quoting Georgine v. Amchem Prods., 83 F.3d 610, 632 (3d Cir. 1996)). \nAllowing the instant action to proceed as a class action is a far superior method of\nadjudication.  In fact, this is exactly the sort of claim that is best-suited to class action\nlitigation.  “In a case like this one, where the plaintiff's claims attack the same course of\ndefendants' conduct, proceeding as a class action is far superior to allowing piecemeal\nlitigation of the exact same claims in countless lawsuits potentially occurring throughout the\ncountry.”  Stanford v. Foamex L.P., 263 F.R.D. 156, 174 n.22 (E.D. Pa. 2009).  A case like\nthis, pertaining to the Defendant’s uniform policy, is especially appropriate for the economies\nof scale that will result from the class action mechanism.\nMoreover, “class certification is preferred where the recovery being sought by each\nof the plaintiffs is not sufficiently large to render individualized litigation a realistic possibility.” \n18\n\nBizzarro v. Ocean County, No. 07-5665, 2009 WL 1617887 at *17 (D.N.J. June 9, 2009)\n(citation omitted).  Addressing the rights of those who would not otherwise be appropriately\nincentivized to bring their own singular claims was precisely the aim of the Advisory\nCommittee in promulgating Rule 23(b)(3).  Amchem Prods. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 617\n(1997).  Here, as Plaintiff points out, the class is likely to “contain poor and marginalized\nclass members who are unlikely to be able to litigate these cases individually, especially\nwhen the prosecution of delousing cases generally requires expensive testimony from\nmedical doctors.”  (Doc. 33 at 36).  As such, class certification might not just be superior, but\nnecessary in order to try these particular claims.  See e.g. Tardiff v. Knox County, 365 F.3d\n1, 7 (1st Cir. 2004).  Thus, to allow this to proceed as a class action would not be removing\nclaims from the hands of the class members, but would instead afford them an opportunity\nto pursue them.\nFinally. the Court is not aware of any claims pending by or against class members on\nthis matter, and notes that such an action is most sensibly brought within the same judicial\ndistrict in which the SCCF is located.  Therefore, for the foregoing reasons, the Court finds\nsuperiority satisfied in the instant case. \n(2.)  Rule 23(b)(2)\nCertification as a Rule 23(b)(2) class may be warranted where “the party opposing\nthe class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that\nfinal injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class\nas a whole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  \nAs the Court is prepared to certify this Class pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3), it is not\n19\n\nnecessary to endeavor on a lengthy analysis of the merits of a Rule 23(b)(2) certification. \nHowever, such actions are not appropriate where, as here, the Plaintiff is seeking monetary\ndamages.  In his Prayer for Relief, Plaintiff specifically requests compensatory damages for\nhimself and “each member of the proposed Class in an amount to be determined by a jury\nand/or the Court on both an individual and a class-wide basis.”  (Doc. 1 at 10).  The Supreme\nCourt has recently clarified Rule 23(b)(2) actions in holding that “individualized monetary\nclaims belong in Rule 23(b)(3).”  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 2558\n(2011).  While Rule 23(b)(2) may allow monetary claims on an indivisible basis, individual\nrelief is inapposite to the Rule’s purpose of remedying classwide relief in a single classwide\norder.  Id. at 2557-58.\nD. Notice to Potential Class Members\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(c)(2)(B) provides that in any action maintained\nunder Rule 23(b)(3), the Court must direct notice to all members that can be identified\nthrough reasonable effort.  As such, the Court will order the parties to formulate a plan for\nsuch notice to be presented to the Court.      \nE. Appointment of Class Counsel and Class Representative \nAs the Court finds Plaintiff Roneld Logory will fairly and adequately represent the\ninterests of the class, he will therefore be appointed as Class Representative.   \nRule 23(g)(1) further requires the Court to appoint class counsel.  As noted above,\nthe Court finds Plaintiff's counsel to be “qualified, experienced, and generally able to conduct\nthe proposed litigation.”  Wetzel v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 508 F.2d 239, 247 (3d Cir. 1975). \nAs such, the Court will therefore grant Plaintiff’s motion to appoint them as Class Counsel.\n20\n\nIII. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court will certify the Fourteenth Amendment Class as\na Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 23(b)(3) class action.  The Fourth Amendment Class\nwill not be certified.  An appropriate order follows.\n October 5, 2011        /s/ A. Richard Caputo       \nDate A.
