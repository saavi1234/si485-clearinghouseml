    "summary": "<p>On May 18, 2014, inmates at the Clackamas County Jail (CCJ) filed this class action lawsuit against Clackamas County and one of its senior Department officials. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, brought this claim under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, alleging violations of the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments for strip and visual cavity searches conducted on pre-trial detainees and convicted inmates at the CCJ beginning in May 2012. The plaintiffs sought compensatory damages on both individual and class-wide basis, as well as punitive damages. They also sought a declaratory judgment that the strip search practices of the County were unconstitutional. Lastly, the plaintiffs sought a preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining Clackamas County and its officials from continuing to implement the strip and visual cavity searches in group and public fashion without adequate privacy and reasonable suspicion.</p><p>The plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on May 4, 2015 to add plaintiffs and claims. They then sought to amend the complaint again on February 27, 2017. The motion was denied by Magistrate Judge Youlee Yim You on April 6, 2017 and that recommendation adopted by Judge Michael Simon on April 21, 2017.</p><p>The defendants moved for summary judgment on November 2, 2016. They alleged that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted under the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendment, and that the plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue claims of unconstitutional searches on behalf of female inmates and future inmates, among others. On May 2, 2018, Magistrate Judge You granted the motion as to all claims under the Eighth Amendment and plaintiffsโ claims for constitutional violations based on the emergency search of October 10, 2012. Otherwise, the defendantsโ motion for summary judgment was denied. Judge Simon confirmed the order on July 23, 2018.</p><p>The plaintiffs sought to certify three classes and moved for partial summary judgment on February 27, 2017. Class One included everyone who had undergone unjustified strip searches at CCJ since May 19, 2012. The two subclasses included persons undergone group and public strip searches since September 25, 2012 as well as a group of inmates searched on October 10, 2012, respectively. On May 2, 2018, Magistrate Judge You certified Class One, but only as to โthe Fourth Amendment claims of male inmates at the CCJ who underwent return-from-court visual strip searches between September 25, 2012, and the date in May 2013 on which the County installed privacy panels in CCJโs hallway.โ As for the partial summary judgment, the plaintiffsโ motion was denied. The recommendations were confirmed by Judge Simon on July 23, 2018.</p><p>On September 7, 2017, the defendants moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. They alleged that the plaintiffsโ claims must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because some plaintiffs made no showing of a physical injury as required by the Prison Litigation Reform Act. As for the remaining named plaintiffs, the defendants alleged that none of them were in custody at the CCJ when the second amended complaint was filed. In addition, Article III of the Constitution prevented the current plaintiffs from pursuing this case on behalf of the female CCJ inmates. This motion was denied on July 23, 2018 by Magistrate Judge You. </p><p>On April 10, 2019, the defendants moved to decertify the class, and on May 21, 2019, the defendants moved for imposition of sanctions.</p><p>Oral argument was held on May 21, 2019 on the motion to decertify the class. On August 6, 2019 Magistrate Judge You recommended that the motion to decertify the class be granted. Magistrate Judge You also denied the defendants' motion for sanctions on the same day. The plaintiffs filed objections to the recommendation. 2019 WL 6709545 (D.Or. Aug. 06, 2019). On December 9, 2019, District Judge Simon adopted the magistrate judge's recommendations and granted the defendant's motion to decertify the class. 2019 WL 6709381 (D.Or. Dec. 09, 2019).</p><p>Eight days after the order was issued, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit (Appeal Docket No. 19-36084). On December 23, 2019, the deputy clerk of the Ninth Circuit filed an order stating that the Ninth Circuit may not have jurisdiction over the appeal because the district court's decision to decertify the class may not be final or appealable. The court ordered that within 21 days, the appellants must move for voluntary dismissal of the appeal or show cause as to why the appeal should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  On January 13, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a response to the order to show cause, but the Ninth Circuit (Judges William C. Canby, Ronald M. Gould, and Paul J. Watford) dismissed the appeal in a February 25, 2020 order. 2020 WL 1290290 (9th. Cir. 2020).  </p><p>Meanwhile, back in the district court, on October 1, 2019, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. On April 20, 2020, Magistrate Judge You issued a recommendation on the defendants' motion for summary judgment. Magistrate Judge You recommended that the motion for summary judgment should be granted in full, stating that: \"1) the ยง 1983 claims against Sheriff Roberts should dismissed; 2) the Fourth Amendment claim against the County should be dismissed; and 3) the state claim against defendants should be dismissed.\" 2020 WL 2544781 (D.Or. Apr. 20, 2020)</p><p>Two weeks later, the plaintiffs filed an objection to the magistrate judge's recommendations. In May 2020, District Judge Simon adopted the recommendations of Magistrate Judge You, granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment, and dismissed the case with prejudice. 2020 WL 2545312 (D.Or. May 19, 2020)</p><p>On June 16, 2020, the plaintiffs appealed to the Ninth Circuit (Appeal Docket No. 20-35544).  Six days later, the plaintiffs filed a Mediation Questionnaire briefly describing the issues in the case, and the next day, the  Ninth Circuit filed a mediation order saying that this case had not been selected for inclusion in the court's mediation program.  As of July 2020, the appeal is ongoing.</p>",

For at \nleast the past two years,  Clackamas County (hereinafter, โCCโ)  has had a policy of strip-\nsearching inmates in public and in public and group settings with closed circuit cameras \nin view in violation of the ABA Standard 23-7.9 Searches of prisonersโ bodies and  OAR \n291-041-0020 Inmates   (infra) for random searches, after court hearings, and during \nroutine searches as well as one mass search of 160 inmates on or about October 10, 2012.\n     These group and public strip searches have been conducted in the hallways and open \nareas  in the Clackamas  County  Jail  (hereinafter โCCJโ) on a daily basis  since May 21, \n2012.  No pat-downs occur.  Other corrections facilities do pat-down searches and only \nconduct  strip searches when reasonable suspicion arises from a pat-down and in private, \nindividually. On or about October 10, 2012, several dozen inmates up to 160 or more \nwere pulled out of their cells in pairs by deputies in camouflage commando gear and \npublicly strip searched.    Upon information and belief, this strip search practice derived \nfrom  the  custom,  practices  and/or  written  procedures  of  the  aforementioned  County \nDepartments, and was promulgated by senior Department officials.\n   With this as a background, Plaintiff William Dillon, Scott Graue, and david \nHodges individually, by and through counsel, hereby complains as follows:\nJURISDICTION\n1. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \nยงยง 1331, 1341 & 1343 because it is filed to obtain compensatory damages, punitive \ndamages, and injunctive relief for the deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights \n2 COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 1    Filed 05/18/14    Page 3 of 20\nof citizens of the United States secured by the Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. ยงยง 1981 & 1983.   This Court also has jurisdiction over this action under the \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. ยง 2201, as it is filed to obtain declaratory relief relative to the \nConstitutionality of the policies of a local government.\n2. Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(e)(2) because the events giving rise to \nPlaintiffsโ claims and those of proposed class members occurred in this judicial district.\nPARTIES\n3. Plaintiff  Scott  Graue  resides  in  Clackamas  County,  Oregon,  Dillon  and \nHodges live in other counties. \n4. Defendant  Clackamas  County  (hereinafter,โCCโ)  is  a  county  government \norganized and existing under the laws of the State of Oregon.   At all times relevant \nhereto, the County, acting through its Corrections Department, was responsible for the \npolicies, practices, supervision, implementation and conduct of all matters pertaining to \nthe MCIJ   and was responsible for the appointment, training, supervision and conduct of \nall  Department personnel.  In addition, at all relevant times, the County was responsible \nfor enforcing the rules of the CCJ, and for ensuring the personnel employed in the CCJ \nfollowed the Constitution and laws of the United States and of the State of Oregon.\n5. Defendant Craig Roberts is the sheriff and final decision-maker and  policy \nmakers with respect to the treatment of pre-trial and other detainees over which the CCJ \nexercises custodial or other control. \n3 COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 1    Filed 05/18/14    Page 4 of 20\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS\n6. Plaintiff bring this action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(1), 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly \nsituated individuals who were strip searched in public and group settings.\n7. The classes that Plaintiffs seek to represent are defined as follows:\nClass One\n     All persons who have been or will be placed into the custody of the CCJ \nregardless of charges, while unclothed in a group and public setting in open \nareas involving one or more deputy who:\nA. Inspects the individual from top to bottom;\nB. Inspects  his  hair,  ears,  mouth,  hands,  armpits,  feet, \nbetween toes, nostrils;\nC. Inspects a womanโs breasts or tells a man to separate \nhis penis and testicles;\nD. Inspects  beneath  the  foreskin  of  an  uncircumcised \nmale;\nE. Requires the individual to bend and spread buttocks;\nF. Requires  the  individual  to  face  a  wall  so  staff  can \ninspect the back of the body;\nThe class period commences on May 19, 2012 and extends to the \ndate  on  which  Clackamas  County    (CC)  is  enjoined  from,  or \notherwise ceases, enforcing their unconstitutional policy, practice \nand custom of conducting group and public strip searches after \ncourt  hearings,  on  routine  schedules  and/or  on  a  random  basis. \nSpecifically excluded from the class are Defendants and any and all \nof their respective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors, \nemployees or assignees.  \nCLASS TWO\nAll persons who have been or will be placed into the custody of the CCJ \nregardless of charges, while unclothed in a group and public setting in open \nareas involving one or more deputy who:\n4 COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 1    Filed 05/18/14    Page 5 of 20\nG. Inspects the individual from top to bottom;\nH. Inspects  his  hair,  ears,  mouth,  hands,  armpits,  feet, \nbetween toes, nostrils;\nI. Inspects a womanโs breasts or tells a man to separate \nhis penis and testicles;\nJ. Inspects  beneath  the  foreskin  of  an  uncircumcised \nmale;\nK. Requires the individual to bend and spread buttocks;\nL. Requires  the  individual  to  face  a  wall  so  staff  can \ninspect the back of the body;\nThe class period pertains to a one-time public search of at least 160 \ninmates on or about October 10, 2012 and the class commences on \nMay 19, 2012 and extends to the date on which Clackamas County \nis  enjoined  from,  or  otherwise  ceases,  enforcing  their \nunconstitutional  policy,  practice  and  custom  of  conducting  such \nstrip searches.  Specifically excluded from the class are Defendants \nand any and all of their respective affiliates, legal representatives, \nheirs, successors, employees or assignees.  \n8. This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class action \nunder Federal law and satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy \nrequirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).\n9. The members of the class are so numerous as to render joinder impracticable. \nUpon information and belief, there are hundreds, if not thousands,   of people arrested \nwho are placed into the custody of CC every month โ all of whom are members of the \nproposed class.  Upon information and belief, the size of the proposed class totals at least \n2,000 individuals.\n10. Upon  information  and  belief,  joinder  of  all  of  these  individuals  is \nimpracticable because of the large number of class members and the fact that class \nmembers  are  likely  dispersed  over  a  large  geographical  area,  with  some  members \npresently residing outside of the County and this Judicial District.   Furthermore, upon \n5 COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 1    Filed 05/18/14    Page 6 of 20\ninformation and belief, many members of the class are low-income persons, may not \nspeak English, and likely would have great difficulty in pursuing their rights individually.\n11. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, in that \nthey all had their right to be free from unreasonable searches violated by Defendantsโ \nconducting strip searches in an unreasonable fashion.   All members of the class were \nplaced into the custody of their CCJ facilities, and all were illegally strip searched in \nviolation of the clearly established law in this judicial circuit.\n12. Plaintiffsโ  claims  are  typical  of  the  claims  of  the  members  of  the  Class. \nPlaintiff and all members of the class sustained damages arising out of Defendantsโ \ncourse of conduct.  The harms suffered by the Plaintiff are typical of the harms suffered \nby the class members.\n13. The  representative  Plaintiff  (s)  have  the  requisite  personal  interest  in  the \noutcome of this action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class. \nPlaintiffs have no interests that are adverse to the interests of the members of the Class.\n14. Plaintiffs have retained counsel who has substantial experience and success in \nthe prosecution of civil rights litigation and class action litigation. \n15. Counsel for Plaintiffs know of no conflicts among members of the class, or \nbetween counsel and members of the class.\n16. This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.   As such, the \nPlaintiffs seek class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), in that all class members \nwere subject to the same policy requiring the illegal strip searches of individuals placed \ninto the custody of MC and involved in kitchen duty.   In short, the aforementioned \n6 COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 1    Filed 05/18/14    Page 7 of 20\nCounty Departments, the Policy Making Defendants and County Corrections Officers \nacted on grounds generally applicable to all class members.\n17. In addition to certification under Rule 23(b)(2), and in the alternative, Plaintiff \n(s) seek certification under Rule 23(b)(3).  \n18. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, and \npredominate over any questions that affect only individual members of the Class.  These \ncommon  questions  of  law  and  fact  include,  without  limitation,  the  common  and \npredominate question of whether the Defendantsโ written and/or  de facto  policy/practice \nof strip searching in an unreasonable fashion,  all individuals committed to the MCIJ is a \nviolation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, \nand whether such a written and/or de facto policy existed during the class period.\n19. A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual members of the \nclass is impracticable given the large number of class members and the fact that they are \ndispersed over a large geographical area.   Furthermore, the expense and burden of \nindividual litigation would make it difficult or impossible for individual members of the \nclass to redress the wrongs done to them.   The cost to the federal court system of \nadjudicating thousands of individual cases would be enormous.  Individualized litigation \nwould also magnify the delay and expense to all parties and the court system.   By \ncontrast, the conduct of this action as a class action in this District presents far fewer \nmanagement difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court system, and \nprotects the rights of each member of the Class.\n7 COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 1    Filed 05/18/14    Page 8 of 20\n20. Upon information and belief, there are no other actions pending to address the \nDefendantsโ flagrant violation of the civil rights of thousands of individuals, even though \nthe Defendants have maintained their illegal strip search regimen for the past several \nyears.\n21. In the alternative to certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), Plaintiff(s) \nalso seek partial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4).\n8 COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 1    Filed 05/18/14    Page 9 of 20\nFACTS\nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally\n22. The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits state and \ncounty officials, such as the Policy Making Defendant in this action and the Corrections \nOfficers they supervise, from performing strip searches in an unreasonable fashion on \npre-trial detainees.\n23. The Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits state and \ncounty officials, such as the Policy Making Defendants in this action and the Corrections \nOfficers they supervise, from performing strip searches in an unreasonable fashion on \nsentenced inmates, as an example of cruel and unusual punishment.\n24. Upon information and belief, CC and the Policy Making Defendants have \ninstituted a written and/or  de facto  policy, custom or practice of strip searching all \nindividuals who participate in kitchen duty in the custody of CC (by forcing them to \nremove their clothing for a visual inspection of their bodies and/or forcing them to submit \nto a visual inspection of their body cavities in a public setting in front of fellow inmates \nand other deputies) and are later allowed to dress back into jail clothing.  For purposes of \nthis Complaint, strip and visual cavity searches are collectively referred to as โstrip \nsearches.โ\n25. The aforementioned CC, and the Policy Making Defendant know that they \nmay not institute, enforce or permit enforcement of a policy or practice of conducting \nstrip searches unreasonably. \n9 COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 1    Filed 05/18/14    Page 10 of 20\n26. The  Defendantsโ  written  and/or  de  facto  policy,  practice  and  custom \nmandating  wholesale  unreasonable  strip  searches  has  been  promulgated,  effectuated \nand/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established law.  \n27.

Plaintiff(s) incorporate by reference and realleges each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 41.\n43. The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens \nand pre-trial detainees from unreasonable searches by law enforcement officers, and \nprohibits  deputies  from  conducting  strip  searches  of  individuals  absent  some \nparticularized suspicion and in a group and in a public and demeaning fashion.\n1 COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 1    Filed 05/18/14    Page 14 of 20\n44. The Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits state and \ncounty officials, such as the Policy Making Defendants in this action and the Corrections \nOfficers they supervise, from performing strip searches in an unreasonable fashion on \nsentenced inmates, as an example of cruel and unusual punishment.\n45. The actions of Defendants detailed above violated Plaintiffs' rights under the \nUnited States Constitution.  Simply put, it was not objectively reasonable for CC Officers \nto strip search Plaintiff (s) and class members absent probable cause and in a public and \ngroup setting.    It was also not objectively reasonable for the Policy Making Defendants \nto order/direct  County Corrections Officers to conduct such searches.  \n46. These strip searches were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or practice \nof the County and the Countyโs Department.  As such, the County is directly liable for the \ndamages of the named Plaintiff(s) and members of the Class(es).\n47. Upon  information  and  belief,  the  aforementioned  Sheriff  Roberts  is \nresponsible for establishing the policies, customs, practices, and procedures to be utilized \nin the operation of their facilities, and is responsible for the implementation of the strip \nsearch policy questioned in this lawsuit and/or ratified the policy.  As such, each named \nindividual  is  individually  responsible  for  the  damages  of  the  named  Plaintiff(s)  and \nmembers of the Class.   \n48. Named individuals knew that the strip search policy was illegal, and acted \nwillfully, knowingly, and with specific intent to deprive Plaintiffs and members of the \nClass of their Constitutional rights.\n49. This conduct on the part of all Defendants represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. \nยง 1983, given that their actions were undertaken under color of state law.\n1 COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 1    Filed 05/18/14    Page 15 of 20\n50. As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above, \nPlaintiff(s) and members of the proposed class have been irreparably injured.\n51. Defendant Roberts is the Clackamas County Sheriff , and final decision-maker \nwith respect to the treatment of pre-trial and sentenced  detainees and inmates over which \nthe CC exercises custodial or other control. He is made a defendant in this action in both \nhis individual and official capacities. Mr. Roberts is referred to as the โPolicy Making \nDefendant.โ\n1 COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 1    Filed 05/18/14    Page 16 of 20\nAS AND FOR A SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS\n-- Demand for Declaratory Judgment --\n52. Plaintiff(s) incorporate by reference and realleges each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 51.\n53. The policy, custom and practice of the County Departments, the County and \nthe Policy Making Defendants are clearly unconstitutional, in that these entities and \nindividuals are directing/conducting the strip searches of all individuals on kitchen duty \nin CC custody without any particularized suspicion that the individuals in question have \neither  contraband  or  weapons,  and  the  searches  are  unconstitutional  in  their  scope, \nmanner and duration.\n54. Plaintiff(s)  and  members  of  the  Class(es)  request  that  this  Court  issue  a \ndeclaratory judgment, and that it declare the strip search policies of the County and the \nCounty  Departments to be unconstitutional.\nAS AND FOR A THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS\n-- Demand for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction --\n55. Plaintiff  incorporate  by  reference  and  realleges  each  and  every  allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 54.\n56. The policy, custom and practice of the County Departments, the County and \nthe Policy Making Defendants are clearly unconstitutional, in that these entities and \nindividuals are directing/conducting the strip searches CC custody in a group and public \nsetting and   absent any particularized suspicion that the individuals in question have \neither contraband or weapons.\n1 COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 1    Filed 05/18/14    Page 17 of 20\n57. Upon  information  and  belief,  this  policy  is  currently  in  place  at  the  CC \nfacilities, with new and/or prospective members of the Class being subjected to the harms \nthat have already been inflicted upon the named Plaintiff(s).  \n58. The continuing pattern of strip searching individuals in group and public \nsettings will cause irreparable harm to the new and/or prospective members of the Class, \nan adequate remedy for which does not exist at law.\n59. Plaintiffs  demand  that  the  County,  the  County  Departments,  the  Policy \nMaking  Defendants  and  County  Corrections  Officers  immediately  desist  from  strip \nsearching individuals placed into their custody whether pre-trial or sentenced, in group \nand puvlic settings and  also absent any particularized suspicion that the individuals in \nquestion have either contraband or weapons, and seek both a preliminary and permanent \ninjunction from this Court ordering as much.\n1 COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 1    Filed 05/18/14    Page 18 of 20\nDEMAND FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES\n60.  The actions of the Individual Defendants detailed herein are outrageous, in \nthat they continue to propagate an illegal strip search policy even though they know for a \nfact that their actions are unconstitutional.\n61. It is clear that the Policy Making Defendant Roberts, the County and the \nCounty  Departments and all other named defendant counties have no respect for the civil \nrights of individual citizens or for the rule of law.  Consequently, an award of punitive \ndamages is necessary to punish the Policy Making Defendants, and to send a message to \nthem that the requirements of the United States Constitution also apply to government \nofficials in all named counties.\nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY\n62. The Plaintiff(s) hereby demand trial by jury.\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  William  Dillon,  Scott  Graue,  David  Hodges \nindividually  and  on  behalf  of  a  class  of  others  similarly  situated,  request  that  this \nHonorable Court grants them the following relief:\nA. An order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.\nB.

For at least the past two years, Clackamas County (hereinafter, โCCโ) has an \nunconstitutional policy, custom and practice of strip-searching pre-trial detainees and convicted \ninmates in public and group settings in view of closed circuit cameras in violation of minimal \npenal standards and codes of conduct as exemplified by ABA Standard 23-7.9 [Searches of \nprisonersโ bodies] and OAR 291-041-0020 [Inmates (infra)] for random searches, after court \nhearings, and during routine searches as well as one mass search of 160 inmates on or about \nOctober  10,  2012.    For  purposes  of  this  Complaint,  strip  and  visual  cavity  searches  are \ncollectively referred to as โstrip searches.โ \n2.  No pat-downs occur.  Other corrections facilities do pat-down searches and only \nconduct strip searches when reasonable suspicion arises from a pat-down and on a private, \nindividual basis.  \n3.  The complained-of group and public strip searches have been conducted in the \nhallways and open areas in the Clackamas County Jail (hereinafter โCCJโ) on a daily basis since \nMay 21, 2012.   \n4.  On or about October 10, 2012, several dozen inmates (believed to be up to 160 or \nmore) were pulled out of their cells in pairs by deputies in camouflage commando gear and \npublicly strip searched on a mass basis.   \n5.  Upon information and belief, this afore-described strip search custom, practice \nand policy derived from the custom, practices and/or written policies of the aforementioned \n2  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 31    Filed 05/04/15    Page 3 of 19\nCounty Departments, and was promulgated by senior Department officials including Defendant \nSheriff Craig Roberts. \n6.  Defendants have instituted a written policy, custom or practice of strip searching \nall individuals in public and group settings in the custody of CC (by forcing them to remove their \nclothing  for  a  visual  inspection  of  their  bodies  and/or  forcing  them  to  submit  to  a  visual \ninspection of their body cavities in a public setting in front of fellow inmates and other deputies) \nand are later allowed to dress back into jail clothing.  These written policies include but are not \nlimited to the following: \n25.47.4 C    Searches are done on a โroutine and random basis.โ  \n25.47.4 2D (2)(b)  Unclothed Searches, are to be viewed by: \n1.  staff members conducting search  \n2.  staff members working in the area  \n3.  other inmates being searched at the same time.  \n7.  The policies, customs and practices of the Defendants as described herein are \nclearly unconstitutional, in that these entities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip \nsearches of all individuals  in  public and group settings in  CC custody  and/or without any \nparticularized suspicion that the individuals in question have either contraband or weapons, and \nthe searches are unconstitutional in their scope, manner and duration in violation of the United \nStates Constitution. \n8.  Upon information and belief, this policy is currently in place at the CCJ, with new \nand/or prospective members of the Class being subjected to the harms that have already been \ninflicted upon the named Plaintiff(s).   \n3  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 31    Filed 05/04/15    Page 4 of 19\n9.  The continuing policy, practice and custom of strip searching individuals in group \nand public settings will cause irreparable harm to the new and/or prospective members of the \nClass, an adequate remedy for which does not exist at law.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n10.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. ยงยง \n1331 and 1343 because it is filed to obtain compensatory damages, punitive damages, and \ninjunctive relief for the deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights of citizens of the \nUnited States secured by the Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.   This \nCourt additionally has supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claim(s) asserted herein under \n28 U.S.C. ยง1367. \n11.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(e)(2) because the events giving rise to \nPlaintiffsโ claims and those of proposed class members occurred in this judicial district. \nPARTIES \n12.  Plaintiffs Graue, Dillon and Hodges reside in jail custody in Oregon. \n13.  Plaintiff Saylor lives in Clackamas County out of jail custody. \n14.  Plaintiff Love lives in Multnomah County out of jail custody.   \n15.  The proposed class members currently reside either in jail custody in Clackamas \nCounty, Oregon and in other counties, or out of jail custody. \n16.  Defendant CC is a county government organized and existing under the laws of \nthe State of Oregon.  At all times relevant hereto, CC, acting through its Corrections Department, \nwas  responsible  for  the  policies,  practices,  supervision,  implementation  and  conduct  of  all \nmatters pertaining to the CCJ and was responsible for the appointment, training, supervision and \nconduct of all Department personnel.  In addition, at all relevant times, CC was responsible for \n4  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 31    Filed 05/04/15    Page 5 of 19\nenforcing the rules of the CCJ, and for ensuring the personnel employed in the CCJ followed the \nConstitution and laws of the United States and of the State of Oregon. \n17.

Inspects the individual from top to bottom; \n                                                 \n2 All named Plaintiffs are proposed Class Representatives for Class Two. \n3 Plaintiffs Graue, Dillon and Hodges are proposed Class Representatives for Class Three. \n6  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 31    Filed 05/04/15    Page 7 of 19\nB.  Inspects his hair, ears, mouth, hands, armpits, feet, between toes, \nnostrils; \nC.  Inspects a womanโs breasts or tells a man to separate his penis and \ntesticles; \nD.  Inspects beneath the foreskin of an uncircumcised male; \nE.  Requires the individual to bend and spread buttocks; \nF.  Requires the individual to face a wall so staff can inspect the back \nof the body; \nThe class period commences on September 25, 2012 and extends to the date on \nwhich CC is either enjoined from its policy, practice and custom of unlawful \nstrip searches or ceases to conduct its policy, practice and custom of unlawful \nstrip searches.  Specifically excluded from the class are Defendants and any \nand all of their respective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors, \nemployees or assignees.   \n \n21.  This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class action \nunder  Federal  law  and  satisfies  the  numerosity,  commonality,  typicality  and  adequacy \nrequirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n22.  The members of the class are so numerous as to render joinder impracticable. \nUpon information and belief, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of people arrested who are \nplaced into the custody of CC every month โ all of whom are members of the proposed class.  \nUpon information and belief, the size of the proposed class totals at least 2,000 individuals. \n23.  Upon information and belief, joinder of all of these individuals is impracticable \nbecause of the large number of class  members and the fact  that class members are likely \ndispersed over a large geographical area, with some members presently residing outside of the \nCounty and this Judicial District.  Furthermore, upon information and belief, many members of \nthe class are low-income persons, may not speak English, and likely would have great difficulty \nin pursuing their rights individually. \n7  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 31    Filed 05/04/15    Page 8 of 19\n24.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, in that \nthey all had their right to be free from unreasonable searches violated by Defendantsโ conducting \nstrip searches in an unreasonable fashion.  All members of the class were placed into the custody \nof their CCJ facilities, and all were illegally strip searched in violation of the clearly established \nlaw in this judicial circuit. \n25.  Plaintiffsโ claims are typical of the claims of the members of the Class.  Plaintiff \nand all members of the class sustained damages arising out of Defendantsโ course of conduct.  \nThe harms suffered by the Plaintiff are typical of the harms suffered by the class members. \n26.  The representative Plaintiff (s) have the requisite personal interest in the outcome \nof this action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class.  Plaintiffs have no \ninterests that are adverse to the interests of the members of the Class. \n27.  Plaintiffs have retained counsel who have substantial experience and success in \nthe prosecution of civil rights litigation and class action litigation.  \n28.  Counsel for Plaintiffs know of no conflicts  among members of the class, or \nbetween counsel and members of the class. \n29.  This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  As such, the Plaintiffs \nseek class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), in that all class members were subject to \nthe same policy requiring the illegal strip searches of individuals placed into the custody of CC.  \nIn short, the aforementioned County Departments, the Policy Making Defendants and County \nCorrections Officers acted on grounds generally applicable to all class members. \n30.  In addition to certification under Rule 23(b)(2), and in the alternative, Plaintiff (s) \nseek certification under Rule 23(b)(3).   \n8  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 31    Filed 05/04/15    Page 9 of 19\n31.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, and \npredominate  over  any  questions  that  affect  only  individual  members  of  the  Class.    These \ncommon questions of law and fact include, without limitation, the common and predominate \nquestion of whether the Defendantsโ written and/or de facto policy/practice of strip searching in \nan unreasonable fashion, all individuals committed to the CCJ is a violation of the Fourth and \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and whether such a written and/or de \nfacto policy existed during the class period. \n32.  A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual members of the class is \nimpracticable given the large number of class members and the fact that they are dispersed over a \nlarge geographical area.  Furthermore, the expense and burden of individual litigation would \nmake it difficult or impossible for individual members of the class to redress the wrongs done to \nthem.  The cost to the federal court system of adjudicating thousands of individual cases would \nbe enormous.  Individualized litigation would also magnify the delay and expense to all parties \nand the court system.  By contrast, the conduct of this action as a class action in this District \npresents far fewer management difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court \nsystem, and protects the rights of each member of the Class. \n33.  Upon information and belief, there are no other actions pending to address the \nDefendantsโ flagrant violation of the civil rights of thousands of individuals, even though the \nDefendants have maintained their illegal strip search regimen for the past several years. \n34.  In the alternative to certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), Plaintiff(s) also \nseek partial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4). \n \n9  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 31    Filed 05/04/15    Page 10 of 19\nFACTS \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally \n35.  The  Fourth  Amendment  of  the  United  States  Constitution,  by  means  of  the \nsubstantive  due  process  clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment,  prohibits  state  and  county \nofficials, such as the Defendants in this action and the Corrections Officers they employ and \nsupervise, from performing strip searches in an unreasonable fashion on pre-trial detainees in a \nrandom and/or routine fashion. \n36.  The  Eighth  Amendment  of  the  United  States  Constitution,  by  means  of  the \nsubstantive  due  process  clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment,  prohibits  state  and  county \nofficials,  such  as  the  Defendants  in  this  action  and  the  Corrections  Officers  they  employ \nsupervise, from performing strip searches in an unreasonable fashion on sentenced inmates, in a \nrandom and/or routine fashion, as an example of cruel and unusual punishment. \n37.  Defendants know that they may not institute, enforce or permit enforcement of a \npolicy or practice of conducting strip searches unreasonably or in violation of the Constitution.  \n38.  The Defendantsโ written and/or de facto policy, practice and custom mandating \nwholesale unreasonable strip searches has been promulgated, effectuated and/or enforced in bad \nfaith and contrary to clearly established law.   \n39.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Defendants  have  promulgated,  implemented, \nenforced, and/or failed to rectify a written and/or de facto policy, practice or custom of public, \nmass strip-searching all in the custody of CCJ in an unreasonable fashion. \n40.  Pursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, each member of the Classes, \nincluding the named Plaintiffs, were the victims of routine group and public strip searches.   \n10 SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 31    Filed 05/04/15    Page 11 of 19\n41.  This policy, custom or practices of group strip searches blatantly violate the \nConstitution and the minimal penal standards and codes as exemplified by ABA Standard 23-7.9 \nSearches of prisonersโ bodies and OAR 291-041-0020 Inmates  to wit: \nABA Standard 23-7.9  \n \n(a) In conducting a search of a prisonerโs body, correctional authorities should \nstrive to preserve the privacy and dignity of the prisoner. Correctional authorities \nshould use the least intrusive appropriate means to search a prisoner. Searches of \nprisonersโ bodies should follow a written protocol that implements this Standard. \n(b) Except in exigent situations, a search of a prisonerโs body, including a pat-\ndown search or a visual search of the prisonerโs private bodily areas, should be \nconducted by correctional staff of the same gender as the prisoner. \nโฆ \n(d) Visual searches of a prisonerโs private bodily areas, whether or not inspection \nincludes the prisonerโs body cavities, should: \n \n(i) be conducted only by trained personnel in a private place out of the sight \nof other prisoners and of staff not involved in the search, (emphasis added) \nexcept that a prisoner should be permitted to request that more than one staff \nmember be presentโฆ. \n \nThe relevant OAR states in part: \n \n291-041-0010 Definitions \n(c) Skin: A search procedure wherein the person being searched removes all of \nhis/her  clothing  and  is  visually  examined  and  clothing  removed  is  carefully \ninspected before return and redressing, for the purpose of detecting contraband.  \n \n291-041-0020 Inmates \n \n(7) Skin Searches: Skin searches conducted by DOC staff will be of the same \ngender as the inmate, unless there is an emergency. Except in emergencies, \ninmates undergoing skin searches will be removed to a private area for the \nsearch. (Emphasis added) \n \n42.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip searches conducted pursuant \nto this written and/or de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip searches โ each member of \nthe class, including the named Plaintiff(s) โ have suffered or will suffer psychological pain, \n11 SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 31    Filed 05/04/15    Page 12 of 19\nhumiliation, suffering and mental anguish and in the alternative, are also entitled to nominal \ncompensatory damages. \nFacts Applicable to the Plaintiff Scott Graue \n43.  Graue's experiences are representative of the class at large. On a daily basis, seven \ndays a week from on or about May 19, 2012 until the present CC searched inmates randomly, \nafter hearings and on a routine schedule.  Graue and others sustained multiple public strip \nsearches while housed at CCJ, and on October 10, 2012 Graue sustained a mass public strip \nsearch in open areas of the CCJ likely exceeding 160 inmates when deputies strip searched him \nand others in a group and public fashion.  \n44.  As Corrections Officers watched, Graue and others removed all of their clothing, \nincluding underpants.   \n45.  A Corrections Officer inspected Graue from top to bottom while naked. The \ndeputy then instructed him to bend over and spread his buttocks, lift and separate the penis and \ntesticles.  \n46.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip searches conducted pursuant \nto CC policy, practice and custom, he has suffered and continues to suffer damages. \n47.  A tort claim notice from Graue including twenty-three other inmates (including \nSaylor, Hodges and Love) timely issued on January 21, 2013. \nFacts Applicable to the Plaintiff David Hodges \n48.  Hodges' experiences are representative of the class at large.  On a daily basis, \nseven days a week from on or about May 19, 2012 until the present, CC searched inmates \nrandomly, after hearings and on a routine schedule, and Hodges and others sustained multiple \npublic strip searches.  On October 10, 2012, Hodges sustained a mass public strip search in open \n12 SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 31    Filed 05/04/15    Page 13 of 19\nareas of the CCJ likely exceeding 160 inmates when deputies strip searched him and others in a \ngroup and public fashion.   \n49.

Dillon's experiences are representative of the class at large.   Dillon suffered \ngroup strip searches on multiple occasions in 2013 at CCJ including but not limited to on or \nabout February 15, 2013 and February 19, 2013, after court dates. \n54.

Plaintiff(s) incorporate by reference and realleges each and every allegation stated \nin paragraphs 1 through 68. \n70.  The  Fourth  Amendment  of  the  United  States  Constitution,  by  means  of  the \nsubstantive  due  process  clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment,  prohibits  state  and  county \nofficials, such as the Defendants in this action and the Corrections Officers they employ and \nsupervise, from performing strip searches in an unreasonable fashion on pre-trial detainees in a \nrandom and/or routine fashion. \n15 SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 31    Filed 05/04/15    Page 16 of 19\n71.  The  Eighth  Amendment  of  the  United  States  Constitution,  by  means  of  the \nsubstantive  due  process  clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment,  prohibits  state  and  county \nofficials, such as the Defendants in this action and the Corrections Officers they employ and \nsupervise, from performing strip searches in an unreasonable fashion on sentenced inmates, in a \nrandom and/or routine fashion, as an example of cruel and unusual punishment. \n72.  The actions of Defendants detailed above violated Plaintiffs' rights under the \nUnited States Constitution.  Simply put, it was not objectively reasonable for CC Officers to strip \nsearch Plaintiff (s) and class members absent probable cause and in a public and group setting.    \nIt was also not objectively reasonable for the Defendants to order/direct County Corrections \nOfficers to conduct such searches.   \n73.  These strip searches were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or practice of \nthe County and the Countyโs Department.  As such, the County is directly liable for the damages \nof the named Plaintiff(s) and members of the Class(es). \n74.  Upon information and belief, the aforementioned Sheriff Roberts is responsible \nfor establishing the policies, customs, practices, and procedures to be utilized in the operation of \ntheir facilities, and is responsible for the implementation of the strip search policy questioned in \nthis  lawsuit  and/or  ratified  the  policy.    As  such,  each  named  individual  is  individually \nresponsible for the damages of the named Plaintiff(s) and members of the Class.    \n75.  Defendants knew that the strip search policy was illegal, and acted willfully, \nknowingly, and with specific intent to deprive Plaintiffs and members of the Class of their \nConstitutional rights. \n76.  This conduct on the part of all Defendants represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. ยง \n1983, given that their actions were undertaken under color of state law. \n16 SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 31    Filed 05/04/15    Page 17 of 19\nCOUNT II \nViolation of State Law Rights Under Oregon Tort Claims Act โ Invasion of Personal \nPrivacy \n \n77.  Plaintiff(s) incorporate by reference and realleges each and every allegation stated \nin paragraphs 1 through 76. \n78.  In  violation  of  ORS  ยง30.865,  Defendants  knowingly  made  or  recorded  a \nphotograph(s), motion picture(s), videotape(s) or other visual recording(s) of Plaintiffs and the \nClass in a state of nudity during the group and public strip searches without the consent of \nPlaintiffs or the Class, and at the time the visual recording was made or recorded the plaintiff \nwas in a place and circumstances where the plaintiff had a reasonable expectation of personal \nprivacy. \n79.  Plaintiffs and the Class had a reasonable expectation of personal privacy in not \nbeing subjected to unlawful group and public strip searches open to public view of other inmates \nand/or CC employees. \n80.  Plaintiffs and the Class suffered damages as a result of Defendantsโ invasion of \ntheir  personal  privacy  and  are  therefore  entitled  to  compensatory  damages  and  reasonable \nattorneys fees. \n81.  As more fully described above, Defendants were provided with requisite and \ntimely notice under the Oregon Tort Claims Act pursuant to ORS ยง 30.275.  \nDEMAND FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES \n82.  Plaintiff(s) incorporate by reference and realleges each and every allegation stated \nin paragraphs 1 through 81. \n17 SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 31    Filed 05/04/15    Page 18 of 19\n83.  Sheriff Roberts continues to propagate an illegal strip search policy, custom and \npractice with complete indifference to the Plaintiffsโ and Class Membersโ rights even though he \nknows for a fact that his actions are unconstitutional. \n84.  Sheriff Robertsโ development and propagation of an illegal strip search policy, \ncustom and practice is  oppressive because it violates the rights of Plaintiffs and the Class \nMembers with unnecessary harshness or severity. \n85.  It is clear that Sheriff Roberts has no respect for the civil rights of individual \ncitizens or for the rule of law.  Consequently, an award of punitive damages is necessary to \npunish Sheriff Roberts, and to send a message to him that the requirements of the United States \nConstitution also apply to government officials in all named counties. \nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY \n86.  The Plaintiff(s) hereby demand trial by jury. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs William Dillon, Scott Graue, David Hodges, Jayson Saylor, \nAlbert Love individually and on behalf of a class of others similarly situated, request that this \nHonorable Court grant them the following relief: \nA.

P. 72(b)(3).  \nPlaintiffs timely filed an objection (ECF 150) to which Defendants responded, ECF 155. \nPlaintiffs object to the portions of Judge Youโs recommendation finding that (1) Plaintiffs had \nnot presented a genuine question of material fact as to whether the October 10, 2012 emergency \nshakedown search was exaggerated or excessive; and (2) the record was insufficient to determine \nwhether the daily return-from-court searches were unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. \nDefendants also timely filed an objection (ECF 154) to which Plaintiffs responded, ECF 159. \nDefendants object to Judge Youโs recommendations that (1) the Court should certify the class of \nplaintiffs whose claims are predicated on the daily return-from-court searches; (2) the Court \nshould deny Defendantsโ motion for summary judgment as to the claim that the return-from-\ncourt searches violate the Fourth Amendment; and (3) the Court should deny Defendantsโ motion \nfor summary judgment as to Plaintiffsโ claims for a violation of Or. Rev. Stat. (โORSโ) ยง 30.865. \nA.  Plaintiffsโ and Defendantsโ Objections to Findings on Motions for Summary Judgment \n1.  October 12, 2010 Emergency Shakedown \nPlaintiffs object to Judge Youโs finding that there was no genuine question of material \nfact that the October 12, 2010 emergency shakedown search was unreasonable. As Judge You \ncorrectly noted, the test for whether a visual strip search of an incarcerated person violates the \nFourth Amendment requires consideration of โthe scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in \nPAGE 2 โ ORDER \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 160    Filed 07/23/18    Page 3 of 8\nwhich it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.โ \nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979) (emphasis in original). When there is a possibility that \na prisoner has access to a weapon, strip searches have a legitimate penological purpose, and \nPlaintiffs bear โthe burden of showing that [prison] officials intentionally used exaggerated or \nexcessive means to enforce security . . .โ Michenfelder v. Sumner, 860 F.2d 328, 332-333 (9th \nCir. 1988). Judge You found that Plaintiffs failed to counter Defendantsโ evidence that the \nemergency search was conducted because a possible weapon, in the form of a piece of metal, \nwas unaccounted for. Judge You also found that Plaintiffs presented no evidence that \nDefendantsโ response to the discovery of the missing metal was exaggerated or excessive. \nPlaintiffs now argue only that the video evidence showing portions of the emergency search do \nnot show that the search was reasonable and that alternative, more private locations were \navailable. Given the justification for the search, the proffered video evidenceโwhich Judge You \nalso considered, and which shows inmates stripping in groups of up to six in front of their cellsโ\ndoes not raise a reasonable inference that the place, manner or scope of the search was \nunreasonable, or that the prison officialsโ response was exaggerated or excessive.  \n2.  Routine Return-From-Court Strip Searches \nBoth Plaintiffs and Defendants object to Judge Youโs finding that, based on the record, it \nwas impossible to determine whether the daily return-from-court visual strip searches were \nunreasonable under the Fourth Amendment, and her recommendation that the Court deny both \nmotions for summary judgment on this claim. Judge You concluded that, although there was no \nindication that Defendants had considered measures to restrict the viewing of naked inmates by \nthird parties, Plaintiffs had also not presented evidence of โexactly what could be seen on the \nCCTV monitors and by whom, how frequently female third parties could and did view them \nnaked, and the like.โ For this reason, she recommended denial of both Plaintiffsโ and \nPAGE 3 โ ORDER \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 160    Filed 07/23/18    Page 4 of 8\nDefendantsโ motions for summary judgment on Plaintiffsโ Fourth Amendment claim based on \nthese searches.  \nPlaintiffsโ objections to this finding are difficult to parse. Plaintiffs appear to argue that \nthe record was sufficient to justify summary judgment for Plaintiffs because (1) Defendantsโ \nstrip search practices were inconsistent with their own regulations; and (2) it is uncontested that \nthe opportunity existed for staff members not involved in the searches to observe naked inmates. \nLocal laws and regulations may create privacy requirements for strip searches that are more \ndemanding than those imposed by the Constitution. That an agency fails to follow its own \nstandards, therefore, does not render its actions unconstitutional as a matter of law. Similarly, \nthat the privacy panels allowed for the opportunity for staff members not involved in searches to \nobserve the inmates does not render the search practices unconstitutional as a matter of law. The \nreasonableness test articulated in Bell and Michenfelder is a highly fact-specific inquiry. Judge \nYou correctly concluded that a further showing regarding to whom and how often the naked \ninmates were actually exposed to third parties is necessary to demonstrate that the scope, \nmanner, justification and place of the search practices were so unreasonable as to violate the \nFourth Amendment.  \nDefendantsโ objections largely reiterate their argument in briefing before Judge You on \ntheir motion for summary judgment. Defendants argue that they must be granted summary \njudgment under Bell because that case held that searches similar to the routine strip searches \nchallenged in this case were constitutional. Defendantsโ argument is focused almost entirely on \nthe justification for such routine strip searches. Under Bell, although strip searches may be \njustified without probable cause, they must nevertheless be conducted in a reasonable manner. \n441 U.S. at 560. The decision in Bell did not contemplate whether strip searches conducted in the \nPAGE 4 โ ORDER \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 160    Filed 07/23/18    Page 5 of 8\nmanner described in this case are reasonable, but rather addressed the narrow issue of โwhether \nvisual body-cavity inspections . . . can ever be conducted on less than probable cause.โ Bell, 441 \nU.S. at 560. The justification for the searches is not contested here. Rather, Plaintiffs challenge \nthe allegedly unreasonable circumstances of the searchesโspecifically, that they were exposed \nto CCTV cameras and female inmates after fully disrobing and presenting their intimate sexual \nareas and bodily orifices for detailed visual inspection.  \nThe Ninth Circuit has previously held that, depending on the frequency, regularity, and \nproximity, cross-gender observation of strip searches may be unconstitutional. See, e.g., Byrd v. \nMaricopa Cty. Bd. of Supervisors, 845 F.3d 919 (9th Cir. 2017) (holding that male pretrial \ndetainees had stated a claim for a Fourth Amendment violation where they alleged frequent and \nup-close cross-gender observation of their showering and toilet use); cf. Michenfelder, 860 F.2d \nat 334 (holding that strip searches were not unconstitutional specifically because female guards \nwere โnot routinely present for strip searchesโ and observation from video monitors was largely \nobstructed). Given the evidence that Plaintiffs were exposed to female inmates and CCTV \ncameras while undergoing strip searches and the lack of evidence of exigent circumstances or \nefforts on behalf of the Defendants to restrict the viewing of naked inmates by third parties, \nJudge You correctly denied Defendantsโ motion for summary judgment.  \n3.  ORS ยง 30.865 \nDefendants object to Judge Youโs finding that Plaintiffsโ claim for invasion of privacy in \nviolation of ORS ยง 30.865, which was alleged for the first time in Plaintiffsโ second amended \ncomplaint, relates back to Plaintiffsโ original complaint and is thus not barred by the statute of \nlimitation. The Court agrees with Judge You that conduct giving rise to Plaintiffsโ statutory \nclaim arises from the exact same conduct alleged in Plaintiffsโ original complaint. Plaintiffsโ \nPAGE 5 โ ORDER \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 160    Filed 07/23/18    Page 6 of 8\nstatutory claim therefore relates back to the filing date of Plaintiffsโ original complaint and is not \ntime-barred.  \nB.  Defendantsโ Objections to Findings on Motion for Class Certification \nDefendants first argue that โnot one of the Plaintiffs qualifies as a class representativeโ \nfor Class One, defined to include those who underwent return-from-court strip searches between \nSeptember 25, 2012 and May 4, 2013. Defendants argue that Plaintiff Love cannot be a class \nrepresentative because by the time he was added as a named Plaintiff in the Second Amended \nComplaint, his claim was time-barred. Plaintiffs Dillon, Graue, and Hodges, Defendants argue, \nalso cannot be class representatives because the PLRA strips the Court of subject matter \njurisdiction over their claims.  \nโThe filing of a class action tolls the statute of limitations as to all asserted members of \nthe classโ Crown, Cork & Seal Co. v. Parker, 462 U.S. 345, 350 (1983). Similarly, when a new \nclass representative is named in an amended complaint, that class representativeโs claim typically \nโrelates backโ to the filing date of the original class action complaint. See, e.g., Philips v. Ford \nMotor Co., 435 F.3d 785, 788 (7th Cir. 2006) (โRelation back to add named plaintiffs in a class \naction suit is of particular importance because of the interests of the unnamed members of the \nclass.โ). Plaintiffsโ original complaint, which named Dillon, Graue, and Hodges, but not Love, \nwas styled as a putative class action and sought to represent a class of plaintiffs who Defendants \nhad subjected to routine, invasive, and public group strip searches. When the original complaint \nwas filed, Plaintiff Love was an unnamed member of that class. Plaintiff Loveโs claim is thus \ntimely both because his claim relates back to the original filing date, and because the statute of \nlimitations for his claim was tolled as of that filing date.  \nPlaintiffs Dillon, Graue, and Hodges are also adequate class representatives. Defendantsโ \nchallenge to these Plaintiffsโ status as class representatives essentially echoes their argument \nPAGE 6 โ ORDER \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 160    Filed 07/23/18    Page 7 of 8\nbefore Judge You that the PLRAโs โphysical injuryโ requirement, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1997e(e), strips \nthis Court of subject matter jurisdiction over their complaint because they allege only emotional \nand mental injuries. The Court has reviewed Judge Youโs findings and agrees with her reasoning \nand conclusions. Plaintiffs seek damages premised on the violation of their Fourth Amendment \nrightsโnot merely for mental and emotional injuryโand the Ninth Circuit has held that \nconstitutional claims for โcompensatory, nominal or punitive damages . . . are not barred by \nยง 1997(e)(e).โ Oliver v. Keller, 289 F.3d 623, 630 (9th Cir. 2002). Defendantsโ attempts to \ndistinguish Oliver are unpersuasive.  \nDefendants also object that Plaintiffs have offered โno proofโ that the class is sufficiently \nnumerous to warrant a class action. Judge Youโs analysis in estimating the likely size of the \nclass, however, was appropriate. Even when basing her analysis on estimated numbers that were \nso conservative as to be highly unlikely, Judge You concluded that Class One contains at least \n160 plaintiffsโfar more than is necessary to satisfy the numerosity requirement. Finally, \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs have not shown that Class One satisfies the predominance \nrequirement of Rule 23(b)(3) because individual damages calculations will โoverwhelmโ the \nquestions of fact that are common to the class. The Court has reviewed Judge Youโs findings and \nagrees with her conclusions and analysis. The class members were subjected to substantively \nidentical treatment and individual damages calculations are thus unlikely to be burdensome or \neven necessary.  \nThe Court ADOPTS Judge Youโs Findings and Recommendation, ECF 148.1 \nDefendantsโ Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction (ECF 127) is DENIED; Defendantsโ \n                                                 \n1 In neither their response to the Motion for Class Certification before Judge You nor in \ntheir objections to Judge Youโs Findings and Recommendations before this Court did Defendants \nPAGE 7 โ ORDER \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 160    Filed 07/23/18    Page 8 of 8\nMotion for Summary Judgment (ECF 58) is GRANTED as to plaintiffsโ claims for alleged \nconstitutional violations based on the emergency shakedown search of October 10, 2012 and \nGRANTED as to all claims under the Eighth amendment. Otherwise, Defendantsโ Motion for \nSummary Judgment (ECF 58) is DENIED. Plaintiffsโ Motion to Certify the Class (ECF 79) is \nGRANTED as to Class One, but only as to the Fourth Amendment claims of male inmates at the \nCCJ who underwent return-from-court visual strip searches between September 25, 2012, and \nthe date in May 2013 on which the County installed privacy panels in CCJโs hallway. Plaintiffs \nWilliam Dillon, Scott Graue, David Hodges, and Albert Love should be appointed as class \nrepresentatives of Class One. Additionally, Leonard Berman should be appointed as class \ncounsel. In all other respects, the motion to certify is DENIED. Plaintiffsโ Motion for Partial \nSummary Judgment (ECF 82) is DENIED. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nDATED this 23th day of July, 2018. \n \n              /s/ Michael H. Simon    \nMichael H.

In this class action, \nplaintiffs allege that their federal constitutional and state statutory rights were violated by visual \nstrip searches they endured during incarceration.  This case was originally filed on May 18, \n2014, and included as named plaintiffs William Dillon, Scott Graue, and David Hodges.  On \nMay 4, 2015, plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint adding two additional named \n1 โ FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 198    Filed 08/06/19    Page 2 of 12\nplaintiffs, Albert Love and Jayson Saylor.1  Second Am. Compl. , ECF #31.  Defendants include \nClackamas County and the County Sheriff, Craig Roberts. \n  On July 23, 2018, the court granted plaintiffsโ motion to certify the class โas to the Fourth \nAmendment claims by male inmates at the CCJ who underwent return-from-court visual strip \nsearches between September 25, 2012, and the date in May 2013 on which the County installed \nprivacy panels in CCJโs hallway.โ  Order 8, ECF #160.  The court also appointed Leonard \nBerman as class counsel.  Id. \nDefendants move the court for an order decertifying the class on the basis that plaintiffsโ \ncounsel Leonard Berman cannot adequately represent the class.  ECF #177.  For the reasons \ndiscussed below, defendantsโ motion should be GRANTED. \nFINDINGS \nA district courtโs order granting class certification is subject to later modification, \nincluding class decertification.  See FRCP 23(c)(1)(C) (โAn order that grants or denies class \ncertification may be altered or amended before final judgment.โ); see also Sali v. Corona \nRegional Medical Center, 909 F.3d 996, 1004 (9th Cir. 2018) (citing Coopers & Lybrand v. \nLivesay, 437 U.S. 463, 469 n.11 (1978)) (describing a courtโs class certification order as \nโinherently tentativeโ).  A district courtโs decision to decertify a class is committed to its sound \ndiscretion.  Knight v. Kenai Peninsula Borough Sch. Dist., 131 F. 3d 807, 816 (9th Cir. 1997).  \nPlaintiffs, as the party seeking class certification, bear the burden of demonstrating that the \nrequirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 are met.  See United Steel Workers v. \nConocoPhillips Co., 593 F.3d 802, 807 (9th Cir. 2010) (โThe party seeking class certification \nbears the burden of demonstrating that the requirements of Rules 23(a) and (b) are met.โ).  \n                                                 \n1  Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed Saylor as a named plaintiff on January 9, 2017.  ECF #65.   \n2 โ FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 198    Filed 08/06/19    Page 3 of 12\nRule 23(a)(4) provides that โ[o]ne or more members of a class may sue or be sued as \nrepresentative parties on behalf of all members only if . . . the representative parties will fairly \nand adequately protect the interests of the class.โ  โTo satisfy constitutional due process \nconcerns, absent class members must be afforded adequate representation before entry of a \njudgment which binds them.โ  Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1020 (9th Cir. 1998) \n(citation omitted).   \nDetermining the adequacy of representation requires consideration of two questions: โ(1) \ndo the named plaintiffs and their counsel have any conflicts of interest with other class members \nand (2) will the named plaintiffs and their counsel prosecute the action vigorously on behalf of \nthe class?โ  Id (citation omitted).  The latter factor is at issue in this case. \nRule 23(g)(1)(A) directs courts to consider several factors when appointing class counsel: \n(i) the work counsel has done in identifying or investigating potential claims in \nthe action; \n \n(ii) counselโs experience in handling class actions, other complex litigation, and \nthe types of claims asserted in the action; \n \n(iii) counselโs knowledge of the applicable law; and \n \n(iv) the resources that counsel will commit to representing the class. \n \nFRCP 23(g)(1)(A).  Courts also may consider โany other matter pertinent to counselโs ability to \nfairly and adequately represent the interests of the class.โ  FRCP 23(g)(1)(B). \nMr. Berman appears to have sufficient knowledge regarding the applicable law, as \nevidenced by the fact he has brought other prisoner civil rights actions in this district.  However, \nMr. Bermanโs repeated failure to meet court deadlines in this case and others, the multitude of \nmistakes that he made in providing class notice in this case, and his history in this district \ndemonstrate his inability to adequately represent the class in this case.   \n3 โ FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 198    Filed 08/06/19    Page 4 of 12\nI.  Deficiencies in Class Notice \nDefendants contend that Mr. Berman failed to properly effectuate notice of class \ncertification pursuant to Rule 23(c)(2)(B).  Def. Reply 3, ECF #182.  As the class was certified \nunder Rule 23(b)(3), pursuant to Rule 23(c)(2)(B), โthe court must direct to class members the \nbest notice that is practicable under the circumstances, including individual notice to all members \nwho can be identified through reasonable effort.โ  โBoth the form and content of the notice must \nbe adequate to be approved by the courts.โ  Fraser v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., No. 2:13-cv-00520-\nTLN-DB, 2016 WL 6208367, at *6 (E.D. Cal. Oct. 24, 2016) (citing Monterrubio v. Best Buy \nStores, L.P., 291 F.R.D. 443, 452 (E.D. Cal. 2013)).  Moreover, โ[u]nder Rule 23(c)(2)(B), \ncourts must scrutinize the form and content of the proposed notice, as well as the manner in \nwhich it is to be disseminated.โ  Lauber v. Belford High School, No. 09-CV-14345, 2012 WL \n12994873, at *1 (E.D. Mich. Apr. 6, 2012).  โTypically, the plaintiff prepares the notice for the \nCourtโs review and approval, giving the defendant the opportunity to object or suggest changes.  \nHowever, the Court is ultimately responsible for directing notice to the class members and \nprotecting their due process rights to remain in the class or be excluded.โ  Patton v. Dollar Tree \nStores, Inc., No. CV-15-03813-MWF, 2017 WL 8233883, at *2 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 5, 2017) \n(citation omitted).   \nHere, the notice that was effectuated on February 16, 2019, was not approved by the \ncourt.  The court did not have the opportunity to scrutinize the form and content of the proposed \nnotice, and defendants had no opportunity to object or suggest changes.  The court cannot fulfill \nits duty under FRCP 23(c)(2)(B) to direct the โbest notice that is practicable,โ if it has no \nopportunity to review the notice before it is sent to class members. \n4 โ FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 198    Filed 08/06/19    Page 5 of 12\nAfter defendants filed their motion to decertify the class, the court instructed Mr. Berman \nto file a copy of the class notice by Friday, May 17, 2019, for the courtโs review.  Order, ECF \n#184.  On May 15, 2019, plaintiffs filed a copy of a class notice; however, it was a notice of a \nproposed settlement from a different class action.  See Proposed Class Notice, ECF #185.  The \nnext day Mr. Berman emailed a copy of the class noticeโfor this caseโto the court, but was \nunable to upload the notice into ECF.  In his email, Mr. Berman claimed to be having \nโunprecedented computer problems.โ   \nOn May 20, 2019, plaintiffs filed a copy of the class notice in the docket; however, there \nis at least one difference between the class notice that was emailed to the court on May 16, 2019, \nand the class notice that was filed in ECF four days later.2  Compare Corrected Proposed Notice, \nECF #186, with Emailed Class Notice, ECF #197.  It is not clear whether Mr. Berman made \nupdates to the class notice in the interim, or whether he had two versions of the class notice, and \nemailed one and filed the other.  In any event, it is unclear which version was mailed to the class \nmembers.  Indeed, given the fact that Mr. Berman initially provided the court with an incorrect \ndocument from a completely different case, and then provided two different versions of the class \nnotice, it is conceivable that an entirely different versionโone that the court has not seenโwas \nmailed to the class members.  These doubts certainly raise concerns as to the adequacy of \nrepresentation. \nThe two notices provided by Mr. Berman also contain typographical and grammatical \nerrors.  Moreover, the definition of the class is not โclearly and concisely state[d] in plain, easily \n                                                 \n2 The word โFROMโ was included in the definition of the class in the version that was emailed to \nthe court on May 16, 2019; however, it was deleted in the version that was filed on May 20, \n2019. \n5 โ FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 198    Filed 08/06/19    Page 6 of 12\nunderstood languageโ as required by FRCP 23(c)(2)(B).  The class is defined verbatim as \nfollows: \nThe class includes all male inmates were booked into the Clackamas County Jail \nand strip-searched in a group, UPON RETURN FROM COURT, OUTSIDE OF \nPRIVACY PANELS but only as to the Fourth Amendment claims of male \ninmates at the CCJ who underwent return-from-court group visual strip searches \nbetween September 25, 2012, and a date in May 2013 when privacy panels were \ninstalled. \n \nCorrected Proposed Notice, ECF #186.3  Adding to the confusion is an incomplete sentence that \nreferences a โproposed Settlement,โ despite the fact that there is no proposed settlement in this \ncase: โIf the proposed Settlement receives final approval, people who were subjected to a strip \nsearch in the Clackamas County Jail.โ  Corrected Proposed Notice, ECF #186.  In sum, not only \nwas the notice mailed after the deadline and without court approval, but the notice itself fails to \nmeet the requirements of FRCP 23(c)(2)(B). \nII.  Missed Deadlines \nAfter the court had already ordered that, due to the age of the case, no further extensions \nwould be granted, Mr. Berman requested a 90-day extension of time to effectuate notice.  See \nAm. Order, ECF #170; Mot. Exten., ECF #172.  The motion was filed January 31, 2019, the day \n                                                 \n3 Compare the class notice in this case to the clear and concise language approved by a court in \nanother class action in this district: \n \nThe Court has certified this case as a class action consisting of all current and \nformer employees of Butler Investments, Inc. and/or Canby Pub & Grill from \nOctober 9, 2007, to the present, including a first subclass of all front-of-the-house \nemployees during this time period and a second subclass of all back-of-the-house \nemployees during this time period. This notice constitutes notice to the class \nmembers that the above class has been certified, and of their right to opt-out, and \nthe required procedures for doing so. \n \nChastain v. Cam, No. 3:13-cv-1802-SI, ECF #142, at 3; id., ECF #143 (order approving \nproposed notice). \n6 โ FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 198    Filed 08/06/19    Page 7 of 12\nbefore the deadline for completing notice was to expire.  Id.  Plaintiffs eventually completed \nnotice on February 15, 2019, two weeks after the deadline had passed.  Cert. Compl., ECF #175.   \nAdditionally, Mr. Berman failed to meet the deadline for delivering his expert report.  On \nApril 23, 2019, the court granted a stipulated motion for extension of discovery, and ordered \nplaintiffs to provide their expert disclosures to defendants by May 1, 2019.  Order, ECF #181.  \nThe next day, Mr. Berman emailed defendants informing them that he had to replace his expert \nand said he expected โto get [them] a report by early to mid-May.โ  Lillegren Decl. ยถ 5, ECF \n#190.  Mr. Berman delivered the expert report on May 16, 2019, two weeks after the May 1, \n2016 deadline.  Id. ยถ8.  However, Mr. Berman failed to obtain permission to extend this deadline, \nand this failure to comply with the courtโs deadline is the subject of a pending motion for \nsanctions filed by the defense.  Mot. Imp. Sanctions, ECF # 189; see Lilligren Decl. ยถยถ 6-7 \n(contending that by informing defense counsel on April 24, 2019, that he had replaced his expert, \nMr. Berman had โno intention of complying with the Courtโsโ May 1, 2019 deadline). \nMr. Bermanโs failure to meet deadlines appears to be in keeping with a pattern.  In \nanother case, Lyons v. Peters, Judge Simon recently found that Mr. Berman could not adequately \nrepresent a class, relying in part on the fact that Mr. Berman had โrepeatedly missed briefing and \ndiscovery deadlines. . . .โ  See Order 3, ECF #67, No. 3:17-cv-720. \nIII.   Resources \nIn Lyons, Judge Simon also expressed concern that Mr. Berman is a solo practitioner, \nnoting that he might not have had the โavailable resourcesโ to commit to a class action case.  Id. \nat 6.  Judge Simon explained that those concerns were โcompounded by the fact that [Mr. \nBerman had] approximately 20 active cases in this district.โ  Id.  Currently, including this case, \nMr. Berman has 14 active cases in this district.   \n7 โ FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 198    Filed 08/06/19    Page 8 of 12\nMr. Berman argues that Lyons would have involved more work than this case because it \nhad 14,000 potential class members whereas this case has only 1,500 class members.  Pl. Resp. \n3, ECF #180.  Whether or not this case will require less work than Lyons, there nevertheless has \nbeen a failure to meet deadlines in this case.  Moreover, the class notice contained typographical \nand grammatical errors, was poorly formatted, and included confusing language, which indicates \nthat Mr. Berman does not have the resources to carefully proofread a one-page class notice, \ndespite the importance of the document. \nIV.  Conduct in Other Cases \nAdditionally, as Judge Simon noted in Lyons, Mr. Berman has demonstrated an โapparent \naversion to trial,โ calling into question whether he will see this case through to final disposition.  \nOrder 6, ECF #67, No. 3:17-cv-730-SI.  For example, Mr. Berman has, on multiple occasions, \nsought to withdraw as counsel shortly before trial.  Id. \nIn one such instance, after his motion to withdraw was denied two weeks before \ntrial, Mr. Berman simply failed to appear in court on the day of trial.  See Radilla \nv. Newberg et al, Case No. 3:15-cv-1019-MO, ECF 66 (D. Or. Sept. 13, 2016) \n(denying motion to withdraw); Id. ECF 73 (D. Or. Sept. 27, 2016) (granting Mr. \nBermanโs motion to withdraw on reconsideration after he failed to appear in court \non the day of trial). \n \nId.   \nRecently, Mr. Berman completed a jury trial to verdict in this district.  Torres v. Snider, \nNo. 3:17-cv-00624-SI.  However, given the age of this case and the amount of work remaining \nfor the parties and the court leading up to a potential trial, it remains of concern that Mr. Berman \nmay move to withdraw at the eleventh hour or fail to appear in court on the day of trial. \nV.  Withdrawal of Co-Counsel \nMr. Berman was the original counsel of record in this case but was subsequently joined \nby Tonna Farrar as co-counsel.  See Compl., ECF #1; Notice of Appearance, ECF #13.  Prior to \n8 โ FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 198    Filed 08/06/19    Page 9 of 12\nclass certification, Ms. Farrar withdrew from the case.  See Notice of Attorney Withdrawal, ECF \n#55; ECF #56.  In plaintiffsโ Motion for Class Certification, Mr. Berman alleged that โif granted \nclass certification, former counsel Tonna Farrar will likely rejoin the case.โ  Mot. Class Cert. 10, \nECF #79.  Class certification was granted; nevertheless, former counsel Ms. Farrar has not \nrejoined the case.  Indeed, based on the reasons given for her withdrawal, it does not appear that \nthere was ever any realistic possibility that she would return to the case.  See Notice of Attorney \nWithdrawal ยถยถ 2, 4, ECF #55 (explaining that โirreconcilable differencesโ between Ms. Farrar \nand Mr. Berman would โrender it impossibleโ for her to provide effective counsel and required \nher to withdraw under RPC 5.1).   \nVI.  Work Completed in the Case \nIn Sali v. Corona Regional Medical Center, 909 F.3d 996, 1007-08 (9th Cir. 2018), the \nNinth Circuit held that a district court abused its discretion in concluding that proposed class \ncounsel was inadequate.  The court found that the district court had focused only on the errors \nmade by counsel, but ignored the โevidence in the record demonstrating class counselโs \nsubstantial and competent work on the case.โ  Id. at 1008.  Specifically, the Ninth Circuit relied \non the fact that class counsel had: \nincurred thousands of dollars in costs and invested significant time in this matter, \nincluding preparing dozens of interrogatories and requests for production, taking \nnumerous depositions, retaining experts, defending the named plaintiffsโ \ndepositions and the deposition of the plaintiffsโ expert economist, reviewing and \nanalyzing thousands of documents, interviewing hundreds of class members, \nobtaining signed declarations, and preparing and filing a motion for class \ncertification.  \nId. \n \nIn Lyons, the court distinguished Sali, noting that โMr. Bermanโs investments in this case \ndo not appear to be nearly as significant as those of the proposed class counsel in Sali.โ  Order 6, \nECF #67, No. 3:17-cv-730-SI.  Likewise, in this case, while Mr. Berman has certainly made \n9 โ FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 198    Filed 08/06/19    Page 10 of 12\ninvestments in the case, they do not rise to the level in Sali.  Mr. Berman has taken and defended \ndepositions, filed and responded to a number of motions, retained an expert, and issued a class \nnotice; however, there is no indication that he has interviewed hundreds of class members, \nreviewed and analyzed thousands of documents, or prepared dozens of interrogatories.   \nFurthermore, in Sali, there was no evidence that class counsel had a history or pattern of \nfailing to meet deadlines or comply with court orders.  There also was no risk that class counsel \nwould withdraw on the eve of trial or fail to show up for trial.  Additionally, as noted by Judge \nSimon in Lyons, โclass counsel in Sali consisted of an entire law firm,โ whereas Mr. Bermanโs \nโavailable resources to commit to this case as a solo practitioner are far more modest.โ  Order 6, \nECF #67, No. 3:17-cv-730-SI. \nWhile the Ninth Circuit held in Sali that it was โprematureโ at such an โearly stage of the \nlitigationโ to determine that class counsel was inadequate, here the litigation has progressed \nfurther.  909 F.3d at 1008.  At this point in the case, the court has a good idea of whether Mr. \nBerman has the ability to handle a class action.  Importantly, as detailed above, Mr. Berman \nfailed to meet the courtโs deadline for effectuating class notice and the notice itself was deficient.  \nMr. Bermanโs failure to communicate effectively with absent class members cuts to the heart of \nhis adequacy as class counsel.   \nFinally, plaintiffs have fallen short of meeting their burden of demonstrating that the \nrequirements of Rule 23 are met.  United Steel Workers, 593 F.3d at 807.  In his four-page \nresponse, Mr. Berman did not discuss or cite to Rule or any relevant caselaw.  Pl. Resp., ECF \n#180.  Despite asserting that significant effort and expense has been incurred, Mr. Berman \nprovide no evidence documenting the amount of work he has completed or the actual amount of \nexpenses incurred.  Indeed, the effectuation of notice to 1,500 potential class members was the \n10 โ FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 198    Filed 08/06/19    Page 11 of 12\nonly example Mr. Berman gave regarding the work he has completed in this case.  See Pl. Resp. \n1-2, ECF #180.  The court must consider counselโs โcompetent work on the case,โ but Mr. \nBermanโs improperly effectuated class notice does not qualify as competent work.  Sali, 909 \nF.3d at 1008. \nPlaintiffs argue that nearly 1,500 class members have been notified and significant effort \nand expense would be required to notify the pending class of decertification.  Pl. Resp. 1-2, ECF \n#180.  However, the class notice was deficient; therefore, similar effort and expense would be \nrequired to cure the deficient notice even if the court denied the motion to decertify.  See Day v. \nWhirlpool Corporation, No. 2:13-CV-02164, 2014 WL 12461378, at *8 (W.D. Ark. Dec. 3, \n2014) (holding that the proposed notice did not โclearly and concisely define the class in plain \nlanguage as required by Rule 23(c)(2)(B)(ii)โ and explaining that where the court is viewing a \nnotice โretrospectivelyโ it would have the discretion to determine whether the failure to comply \nwith FRCP 23(c)(2)(B) was harmless).4   \nPlaintiffs also argue that the court was aware of Mr. Bermanโs solo practitioner status, \nhealth challenges, and litigation lapses when it initially appointed him as counsel in this case.  Pl. \nResp. 2, ECF #180.  Whether or not the court was aware of those issues, at that point, there were \nno objections to the adequacy of Mr. Berman as class counsel and the court declined to raise the \nmatter sua sponte.  Moreover, subsequent to his appointment, Mr. Berman has missed deadlines \nand committed a number of missteps in effectuating notice, with the result being that a deficient \nclass notice was mailed to 1,500 potential class members.   \n                                                 \n4 Because the court is recommending that defendantsโ motion to decertify the class be granted, it \nis not necessary to reach the question of whether or not the deficiency was harmful and \ncorrective notice would have been required.  Nevertheless, it appears that the confusing language \nincluded in the class definition, taken together with the false assertion that there was a proposed \nsettlement, would not be harmless. \n11 โ FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00820-YY    Document 198    Filed 08/06/19    Page 12 of 12\nRECOMMENDATION \nFor the reasons stated above, defendantsโ motion to decertify the class (ECF #177) should \nbe GRANTED.  If these findings and recommendations are adopted, the court should direct \nplaintiffs to immediately prepare and provide notice of decertification to all members of the class \nto whom notice has previously been sent.  This notice of decertification should be submitted to \nthe court for approval before it is sent. \nSCHEDULING ORDER \nThese Findings and Recommendations will be referred to a district judge.  Objections, if \nany, are due Tuesday, August 20, 2019.  If no objections are filed, then the Findings and \nRecommendations will go under advisement on that date. \nIf objections are filed, then a response is due within 14 days after being served with a \ncopy of the objections.  When the response is due or filed, whichever date is earlier, the Findings \nand Recommendations will go under advisement. \nNOTICE \nThese Findings and Recommendations are not an order that is immediately appealable to \nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.  Any Notice of Appeal pursuant to Rule 4(a)(1), Federal \nRules of Appellate Procedure, should not be filed until entry of a judgment. \nDATED  August 6, 2019. \n/s/ Youlee Yim You \nYoulee Yim You \nUnited States Magistrate Judge \n12 โ FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ",
