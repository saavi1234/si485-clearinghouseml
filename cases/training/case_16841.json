We AFFIRM the grants of declaratory relief as to the declarations that the Attorney General exceeded the authority delegated by Congress in the Byrne JAG statute. We REMAND for the district court to modify the injunction to require the Attorney General to calculate the City of Chicago's Byrne JAG grant as if the challengedconditions were universally inapplicable to all grantees. We AFFIRM the extension of injunctive relief to include the application of the challenged conditions to the Byrne JAG grant now and in the future. We REMAND for the district court to determine if any other injunctive relief is appropriate in light of our determination. Finally, because the injunctive relief is necessary to provide complete relief to Chicago itself, the concern with improperly extending relief beyond the particular plaintiff does not apply, andtherefore there is no reason to stay the application of the injunctive relief. The above is in accordance with the decision of this court entered on this date. Each party to bear its own costs. (ec, ) (Entered: 08/11/2020)"

    "summary": "<p>This case is a response to efforts by the Trump Administration to strip law enforcement funding from &ldquo;sanctuary&rdquo; cities and states unless their governments agree to participate in federal immigration enforcement. The City of Chicago previously sued the Department of Justice over these conditions in 2017; details of that ongoing case can be found <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16080\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The City of Chicago filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on October 12, 2018. The plaintiff, represented by its Department of Law and private attorneys, sued the U.S. Attorney General under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 551 et seq.). The City of Chicago claimed that immigration-related conditions imposed by the government on federal funding to the city were unauthorized by Congress, <em>ultra vires</em>, and in violation of principles of federalism and anti-comandeering. The City of Chicago sought declaratory relief, as well as an injunction to prevent the government from imposing the immigrationp policy conditions on the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (Byrne JAG) program, which provided support for Chicago law enforcement. The case was assigned to Judge Harry D. Leinenweber.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In its complaint, Chicago pointed out that this court had recently struck down many of the same conditions at issue here, referring to a permanent injunction that had been entered to prevent the conditions from being applied to Byrne JAG grants in the prior fiscal year. The City of Chicago alleged that despite this injunction, the government was again attempting to impose unlawful immigration-related conditions on the Byrne JAG grants for fiscal year 2018. The City stated that three of the FY2018 conditions were materially identical to FY2017 conditions which had already been set aside by the court. These conditions required grant recipients to: give the federal government 48-hour notice prior to an arrestee&rsquo;s release; give federal immigration officials unlimited access to local police stations and law enforcement facilities; and comply with 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1373, which bars local governments from restricting their employees from sharing citizenship and immigration status information with federal immigration authorities. The City of Chicago also alleged that the government added an additional unlawful condition for FY2018: requiring cities to certify compliance with 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1644, meaning they would not publicly disclose federal law enforcement information in an attempt to conceal, harbor, or shield from detection fugitives from justice or undocumented immigrants.</p>\r\n<p>The City of Chicago filed an amended complaint on December 17, 2018, addressing the issue of Attorney General Sessions&rsquo;s resignation, which occurred in November. The City alleged that Matthew Whitaker&rsquo;s assumption of Sessions&rsquo;s duties violated federal law and the Appointments Clause. Furthermore, Chicago alleged that since the city received an award letter for its FY2018 Byrne JAG grant shortly after Whitaker took over, Whitaker could not impose the challenged grant conditions on Chicago, because he could not lawfully exercise the powers of the Attorney General. The City of Chicago later abandoned this claim because Whitaker was appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate in February 2019.</p>\r\n<p>The Attorney General filed a motion for partial dismissal on March 1, 2019, with regard to the plaintiff's claims not already covered by the district court's ruling in the 2017 case.</p>\r\n<p>On April 3, 2019, Chicago filed a motion for partial summary judgment on its claims that the conditions imposed on FY2018 Byrne JAG awards were <em>ultra vires</em>, violated the separation of powers and the Spending Clause, and were contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious.</p>\r\n<p>On September 19, 2019, Judge Leinenweber granted in part and denied in part both parties' motions. First, he held that Chicago had sufficiently alleged an injury-in-fact to establish standing. Next, he found that DOJ's proposed placement of these conditions was final agency action subject to judicial review, and that the Attorney General lacked statutory authority to place the conditions on the city's receipt of Byrne JAG funding; thus, the DOJ's imposition of the conditions violated the separation of powers and was ultra vires. He also held that &sect; 1644 violated the Tenth Amendment because it prevented state or local government entities/officials from prohibiting disclosure of immigration statute to or from federal immigration authorities (he noted that &sect; 1644's language was essentially identical to &sect; 1373, which had been found unconstitutional in the 2017 case). Finally, he decided that a permanent injunction was warranted.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Leinenweber noted that the district court's last injunction, in the 2017 litigation, was limited to the FY2017 Byrne JAG program in the hope that the DOJ would not reimpose its unlawful conditions. But, because the DOJ did impose the conditions again in FY2018, the Judge found it appropriate to enter a permanent injunction covering all future years of the Byrne JAG program. However, because the nationwide scope of the injunction in the 2017 case was currently stayed pending decision from the Seventh Circuit, the Judge stayed the nationwide scope of the injunction in this case, pending the outcome of that appeal. 405 F.Supp.3d 748.</p>\r\n<p>On November 18, 2019, the Attorney General filed an appeal to the Seventh Circuit (docket no. 19-3290).</p>\r\n<p>On November 20, 2019, the Seventh Circuit consolidated the appeal of the injunction in this case with the appeal of the injunction in the 2017 case, <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16080\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">City of Chicago v. Sessions</a>.</p>\r\n<p>On March 6, 2020, Chicago filed a motion for attorney fees with the district court.</p>\r\n<p>On April 30, 2020, the Seventh Circuit affirmed Judge Leinenweber's grant of injunctive relief to Chicago and extended it nationwide. The Court found that while the executive branch has significant powers in the realm of immigration, it does not have Congress' power of the purse and thus cannot withhold Byrne JAG grants in order to force Chicago to alter its behavior. The Court affirmed the district court's grants of declaratory relief to Chicago, finding that the Attorney General exceeded the authority delegated to him by Congress in imposing the challenged conditions to the FY2017 and FY2018 grants, and that the Attorney General's decision to impose the conditions in both years violated the separation of powers.</p>\r\n<p>The Court found it unnecessary to reach the constitutionality of &sect; 1373 under the anti-commandeering doctrine. The government had relied on language in 34 U.S.C. &sect; 10153 to support its imposition of the compliance condition. &sect; 10153 stated that in a request for a grant, the application shall include a certification that the applicant \"will comply with all provisions of this part and all other applicable Federal laws.\" The government had argued that the reference to \"all other applicable Federal laws\" allowed it to require that applicants certify compliance with &sect; 1373. However, the Seventh Circuit disagreed with this interpretation and instead found that the phrase could not be construed so broadly as to encompass all federal laws that applied to states or localities, including federal immigration statutes.</p>\r\n<p>The Court also held that a nationwide injunction was proper due to the interconnected nature of applicants for the Byrne JAG grants. In order for the grant amounts to be properly calculated for Chicago, the Court held that the unlawful conditions could not be imposed elsewhere. Finally, the Court remanded for the district court to determine whether any other injunctive relief was appropriate in light of its determination that &sect; 10153 could not be used to incorporate laws unrelated to the grants or grantees. 957 F.3d 772.</p>\r\n<p>Following the Seventh Circuit Opinion, Judge Leinenweber provided the parties time to file briefs proposing modification or adjustments to the court&rsquo;s initial order in light of the appellate decision. In light of these briefs, on January 13, 2021, the District Court withdrew its declaration that 8 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1373 and 1644 are unconstitutional. Although the Seventh Circuit&rsquo;s mandate did not order the Court to vacate this declaration, the District Court maintained that the remanding opinion indicated that such a declaratory judgment was no longer necessary. 513 F.Supp.3d 828.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>An amended final judgment was filed on February 5, 2021 in favor of the City of Chicago and against the Attorney General. The Court&rsquo;s judgment declared that the Attorney General&rsquo;s immigration policy conditions to the FY 2018 Byrne JAG grant violated the constitutional principle of separation of powers. The Court also provided injunctive relief for the Attorney General was permanently enjoined from denying or delaying issuance of the Byrne JAG award in FY 2018 or any other future program year insofar as that denial or delay is based on the challenged immigration policy conditions or materially identical conditions. The permanent injunction ran to the benefit of all Byrne JAG applicants and recipients, and the Court noted it was not limited to the City of Chicago.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Attorney General appealed the amended final judgment to the Seventh Circuit on April 6, 2021 (Docket No. 21-1604). The City of Chicago cross-appealed on April 19, 2021 (Docket No. 21-1701). The Seventh Circuit consolidated these appeals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 28, 2021, the District Court granted and denied in part the City of Chicago&rsquo;s motion for attorney&rsquo;s fees, thereby awarding the City $391,168.55. The Attorney General appealed the award of attorney&rsquo;s fees to the Seventh Circuit on June 25, 2021 (Docket No. 21-2200). 2021 WL 1676387.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The parties then began settlement negotiations wherein monthly status updates were provided to the Court beginning in September of 2021.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On March 8, 2022, an amended final judgment and order was filed, clarifying that the permanent injunction shall not preclude the Attorney General from requiring Byrne JAG applicants to provide a general certification that they will comply with applicable federal law.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As a result of the March 8 order, all Seventh Circuit appeals were voluntarily dismissed on March 22, 2022 and April 25, 2022.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As of February 13, 2024, the case is ongoing for purposes of enforcing the permanent injunction.&nbsp;</p>",

    "summary_short": "On October 12, 2018, Chicago sued the Attorney General for imposing immigration-related conditions on federal funding for law enforcement (specifically, FY2018 Byrne JAG grants). The city requested an injunction to prevent the government from imposing the conditions moving forward. On September 19, 2019, the district court granted summary judgment for the city and issued a permanent injunction covering all future years of Byrne JAG funding. The government appealed, and the Seventh Circuit consolidated the appeal with the appeal of an injunction issued in the related case, <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16080\">City of Chicago v. Sessions</a> (which challenged the same funding restrictions, but for FY2017 Byrne JAG grants). On April 30, 2020, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the district court's grant of injunctive relief to Chicago and extended it nationwide. Following the Seventh Circuit opinion, in February of 2021, the district court ruled in favor of the City of Chicago, declaring the Attorney General's immigration conditions violated constitutional principles of separation of powers and ordering the nationwide permanent injunction. The district court also awarded the City $391,168.55 in attorney's fees. The district court's final judgment was amended in March 2022 to clarify that the permanent injunction did not preclude the Attorney General from requiring Byrne JAG applicants to provide a general certification that they will comply with applicable federal law. As of February 13, 2024, the case is ongoing for purposes of enforcing the permanent injunction.",

      "text": "CITY OF CHICAGO, Plaintiff-Appellee, \nv. \nWILLIAM P. BARR, Attorney General of the United States, Defendant-\nAppellant. \nNos. 18-2885 & 19-3290. \nUnited States Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit. \nArgued April 10, 2020. \nDecided April 30, 2020. \nAppeals from the United States District Court for the, Northern District of Illinois, Eastern \nDivision, Nos. 1:17-cv-05720 & 1:18-cv-06859 — Harry D. Leinenweber, Judge. \nBefore BAUER, MANION, AND ROVNER, Circuit Judges. \nROVNER, Circuit Judge. \nIn this appeal from two consolidated cases, we consider for a second time the legality of \nconditions imposed by the Attorney General on the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice \nAssistance Grant Program (\"Byrne JAG\"). See 34 U.S.C. § 10151 et seq. (formerly 42 \nU.S.C. § 3750). Previously, the district court granted a preliminary injunction as to two \nconditions—known as the notice and access conditions —imposed by the Attorney General \non the FY 2017 Byrne JAG grant applicants. We upheld the preliminary injunction and its \nnationwide scope in City of Chicago v. Sessions, 888 F.3d 272 (7th Cir. 2018) (\"Chicago I\"). \nThe Attorney General then took the rare step of seeking en banc review limited to only the \nnationwide scope of the injunction, excluding the determination that injunctive relief was \nproper as to the notice and access conditions, and we granted en banc review. During the \npendency of that review, the district court granted a permanent injunction, and in light of that \nsuperseding relief we vacated the decision granting en banc review. City of Chicago v. \nSessions, No. 17-2991, 2018 WL 4268814, at *2 (7th Cir. Aug. 10, 2018). The district court \nagain determined that the notice and access conditions imposed by the Attorney General \nwere unlawful and unconstitutional, but also determined that a third condition — the \ncompliance condition — was unconstitutional as well. City of Chicago v. Sessions, 321 F. \nSupp. 3d 855 (N.D. Ill. 2018). The court extended the injunction to apply to all FY 2017 \ngrant recipients program-wide, but in light of our prior grant of en banc review regarding the \nscope of the injunction, stayed the injunction to the extent that it applied beyond the City of \nChicago. \nThe Attorney General appealed that determination, and while it was pending in this court, \nthe district court granted a permanent injunction in a second case brought by the City of \nChicago, this time challenging the Attorney General's imposition of conditions on the FY \n2018 Byrne JAG grant. City of Chicago v. Barr, 405 F. Supp. 3d 748 (N.D. Ill. 2019). Those \nconditions included the same notice, access, and compliance conditions that the district \ncourt enjoined as to the FY 2017 grant, as well as some new conditions. The district court \n\nenjoined the imposition of all of the challenged conditions as to the FY 2018 Byrne JAG \ngrant and all future years, and once more stayed the injunction as to grantees other than \nthe City of Chicago. Id. at 770. The Attorney General again appealed to this court, and we \nconsolidated the two cases for the purposes of the appeal. \nThe stakes in this case are high. Chicago, like many local governments, has determined \nthat: (1) effective law enforcement requires the cooperation of its undocumented residents; \n(2) such cooperation cannot be accomplished if those residents fear immigration \nconsequences should they communicate with the police; and, therefore, (3) local law \nenforcement must remain independent from federal immigration enforcement. The Byrne \nJAG grant was enacted by Congress to support the needs of local law enforcement to help \nfight crime, yet it now is being used as a hammer to further a completely different policy of \nthe executive branch—presenting a city such as Chicago with the stark choice of forfeiting \nthe funds or undermining its own law enforcement effectiveness by damaging that \ncooperative relationship with its residents. \nThe Attorney General repeatedly expresses frustration that Chicago, or any other \njurisdiction, can \"simultaneously accept federal law enforcement grants, yet maintain local \npolicies that frustrate federal immigration enforcement.\" Appellant's Brief 1-3-20 at 1. It is a \nsentiment echoed by the only circuit—of the five that have considered it—to uphold the \nchallenged conditions thus far. See State of New York v. Dept. of Justice, 951 F.3d 84, 107 \n(2d Cir. 2020) (\"there is something disquieting in the idea of States and localities seeking \nfederal funds to enforce their own laws while themselves hampering the enforcement of \nfederal laws, or worse, violating those laws.\") But states do not forfeit all autonomy over \ntheir own police power merely by accepting federal grants. And the Attorney General's \nperception of the urgency of immigration enforcement does not corral for the executive \nbranch the powers entrusted to the legislative branch. The executive branch has significant \npowers over immigration matters; the power of the purse is not one of them. This tendency \nto overlook the formalities of the separation of powers to address the issueof-the-day has \nbeen seen many times by the courts, and it is no more persuasive now than it was in those \ncases. As the Supreme Court has stated, repeatedly: \nMuch of the Constitution is concerned with setting forth the form of our government, and the \ncourts have traditionally invalidated measures deviating from that form. The result may \nappear `formalistic' in a given case to partisans of the measure at issue, because such \nmeasures are typically the product of the era's perceived necessity. But the Constitution \nprotects us from our own best intentions: It divides power among sovereigns and among \nbranches of government precisely so that we may resist the temptation to concentrate \npower in one location as an expedient solution to the crisis of the day. \nPrintz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 933 (1997), quoting New York v. United States, 505 \nU.S. 144, 187 (1992). \nWe conclude again today, as we did when presented with the preliminary injunction, that the \nAttorney General cannot pursue the policy objectives of the executive branch through the \npower of the purse or the arm of local law enforcement; that is not within its delegation. It is \nthe prerogative of the legislative branch and the local governments, and the Attorney \n\nGeneral's assertion that Congress itself provided that authority in the language of the \nstatutes cannot withstand scrutiny. \nI. Facts and District Court Rulings. \nIn Chicago I, we discussed at length the Byrne JAG program and Chicago's Welcoming \nOrdinance, as well as their respective purposes. See Chicago I, 888 F.3d at 276-82. In \nshort, the Byrne JAG grants are awarded annually to address the needs of state and local \nlaw enforcement. They are the primary source of federal criminal justice enforcement \nfunding for state and local governments. This lawsuit stemmed initially from the Attorney \nGeneral's decision to attach three conditions to those grants — the notice, access and \ncompliance conditions, which as set forth by the district court provide respectively: \n(1) A State statute, or a State rule, -regulation, -policy, or -practice, must be in place that is \ndesigned to ensure that, when a State (or State-contracted) correctional facility receives \nfrom DHS a formal written request authorized by the Immigration and Nationality Act that \nseeks advance notice of the scheduled release date and time for a particular alien in such \nfacility, then such facility will honor such request and—as early as practicable—provide the \nrequested notice to DHS. \n(2) A State statute, or a State rule, -regulation, -policy, or -practice, must be in place that is \ndesigned to ensure that agents of the United States acting under color of federal law in fact \nare given [] access [to] any State (or State-contracted) correctional facility for the purpose of \npermitting such agents to meet with individuals who are (or are believed by such agents to \nbe) aliens and to inquire as to such individuals' right to be or remain in the United States. \n(3) The applicant local government must submit the required `Certification of Compliance \nwith 8 U.S.C. § 1373' (executed by the chief legal officer of the local government). \nCity of Chicago v. Sessions, 264 F. Supp. 3d 933, 937-38 (N.D. Ill. 2017). In short: \n• the notice condition requires that state or local officials honor requests to provide federal \nagents advance notice of the scheduled release date and time for aliens in custody; \n• the access condition requires state or local correctional facilities to give federal agents \naccess to aliens in their custody; \n• and the compliance condition requires the state or local governments to certify their \ncompliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373 (hereinafter \"§ 1373\"), which prohibits state and local \ngovernments from restricting their own officials from communicating information regarding \nthe citizenship or immigration status of any individual to the Immigration and Naturalization \nService.  \n[1]\nAll of those conditions were imposed on applicants for the FY 2018 Byrne JAG grant as \nwell, but three new conditions were added. The first was virtually identical to the compliance \ncondition, except that it referenced 8 U.S.C. § 1644 (hereinafter § 1644) rather than 8 \nU.S.C. § 1373 which contains essentially the same language: \n• the § 1644 compliance condition requires certification that the \"program or activity\" funded \nunder the Byrne JAG award complies with § 1644, which provides \"[n]otwithstanding any \nother provision of Federal, State, or local law, no State or local government entity may be \nprohibited, or in any way restricted, from sending to or receiving from the Immigration and \n\nNaturalization Service information regarding the immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of an \nalien in the United States.\" \nThe Attorney General concedes that the two compliance conditions are equivalent and that \nour disposition as to one will control as to the other. \nThe Attorney General imposed two additional conditions on the FY 2018 Byrne JAG grant \nthat were distinct from those imposed on the FY 2017 grant, which have been termed the \n\"harboring\" condition and the \"additional certification\" condition: \n• The harboring condition prohibits the recipient jurisdiction from making any \"public \ndisclosure ... of any federal law enforcement information in a direct or indirect attempt to \nconceal, harbor, or shield from detection any fugitive from justice under 18 U.S.C. ch. 49, or \nany alien who has come to, entered, or remains in the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. \nch. 12—without regard to whether such disclosure would constitute (or could form a \npredicate for) a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1071 or 1072 or of 8 U.S.C. 1324(a).\" \n• The additional certification condition requires the certification that \"neither the jurisdiction \nnor any entity, agency, or official of the jurisdiction has in effect ... any law, rule, policy, or \npractice that would apply to the `program or activity' to be funded ... that would or does—(a) \nimpede the exercise by federal officers of authority under 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a); or (b) impede \nthe exercise by federal officers of authority relating to 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a) or (c), 8 U.S.C. § \n1231(a), or 8 U.S.C. § 1366(1) or (3).\" \nChicago, 405 F. Supp. 3d at 754-55. \nThose conditions conflict with the Welcoming City Ordinance, which reflects Chicago's \ndetermination that the cooperation of all persons, whether documented or undocumented, \n\"`is essential to achieve the City's goals of protecting life and property, preventing crime and \nresolving problems.'\" Chicago I, 888 F.3d at 279 (quoting Chicago Municipal Code, \nWelcoming City Ordinance (the \"Ordinance\"), § 2-173-005 \"Purpose and Intent\"). Toward \nthat end, the Ordinance sets forth standards which include prohibitions on requesting or \ndisclosing information as to immigrant status, as well as a prohibition on detaining persons \nsolely based on a belief as to their immigration status or on immigration detainers based \nsolely on violations of civil immigration laws. Chicago I, 888 F.3d at 279; Ordinance, § 2-\n173-020, -030, -042. The Ordinance further provides that \"unless acting pursuant to law \nenforcement purposes unrelated to the enforcement of civil immigration law, no agency or \nagent shall permit Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents access to a person \nbeing detained or permit the use of agency facilities for investigative interviews, nor can an \nagency or agent while on duty expend time responding to ICE inquiries or communicating \nwith ICE as to a person's custody status or release date.\" Chicago I, 888 F.3d at 279; \nOrdinance § 2-173-042. Those restrictions in the Ordinance are inapplicable when the \nsubject of the investigation \"has an outstanding criminal warrant, ... has been convicted of a \nfelony, ... is a defendant ... where ... a felony charge is pending, ... or has been identified as \na known gang member either in a law enforcement agency's database or by his or her own \nadmission.\" Ordinance, § 2-173-042(c); Chicago I, 888 F.3d at 279-80. \nA. Challenge to FY 2017 grant \n\nIn the first of the two cases before us, Chicago challenges the conditions imposed on the \nFY 2017 grant, alleging: that the conditions were unconstitutional because the Byrne JAG \nstatute does not provide the Attorney General with the statutory authority to impose the \nconditions, and that the imposition is therefore ultra vires and a violation of the separation of \npowers; that the conditions violate the Spending Clause of the Constitution; and that, \nindependent of the Byrne JAG grant, § 1373 is an impermissible federal conscription of \nstate power and is unconstitutional under the anticommandeering doctrine of the Tenth \nAmendment. Chicago also sought a declaratory judgment providing that even if § 1373 is \nconstitutional, Chicago is in compliance with it. Finally, Chicago alleged that the imposition \nof the conditions was arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedures \nAct and violated the Paperwork Reduction Act. \nThe Attorney General sought dismissal of the complaint in its entirety, arguing that the \ncomplaint was insufficient to state a claim and that the court lacked subject matter \njurisdiction. As to subject matter jurisdiction, the Attorney General asserted that the \nDepartment of Justice had not yet consummated any final agency action that was ripe for \njudicial review because it had not reached a final decision as to whether to award Chicago \nfunds under the Byrne JAG grant. Chicago responded that its challenge was not to the \nAttorney General's pending decision as to whether to award the grant funds, but rather to \nthe decision to attach the conditions to the grant in the first instance. The district court \nagreed with Chicago as to the nature of the challenge, noting that the complaint requested \nthat the court \"[d]eclare that all three immigration-related conditions for the FY 2017 Byrne \nJAG are unlawful.\" City of Chicago, 321 F. Supp. 3d at 865. The court noted that in order for \nan agency action to be final, two criteria must be satisfied: it must mark the consummation \nof the agency's decision-making process and not merely a tentative or interlocutory \ndecision; and it must be one by which rights or obligations of the challenging party have \nbeen determined or from which legal consequences will flow. Id. at 865 (citing Bennett v. \nSpear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-78 (1997)). The court held that the action was not merely \ntentative or interlocutory, because the Attorney General stated in his declaration that every \nFY 2017 award would include conditions identical to the ones in the grant already awarded, \nwhich included all of the challenged conditions. Id. at 865. In addition, the court noted that \nthe FY 2017 grants were awarded based on a solicitation that clearly imposed the \nchallenged conditions. Id. The court held that the second criteria was met as well, because \nthe conditions force Chicago to choose between accepting the award with those conditions, \nor forgoing the grant and the corresponding law enforcement benefit in favor of maintaining \nthe policies that it believed would maximize law enforcement goals. Id. at 866. \nChicago moved for partial summary judgment as to three counts, arguing that the Attorney \nGeneral acted ultra vires in imposing the conditions, and in violation of the separation of \npowers, and contending that even if the compliance condition was valid, Chicago was not in \nviolation of § 1373. The district court granted the motion and determined that § 1373 was \nfacially unconstitutional under the Tenth Amendment's anti-commandeering principle, that \nthe Attorney General exceeded the authority delegated by Congress in the Byrne JAG \nstatute, 34 U.S.C. § 10151 et seq., and in 34 U.S.C. § 10102(a)(6), and that the Attorney \nGeneral violated the principle of the separation of powers in attaching conditions to the FY \n2017 Byrne JAG grant. The court enjoined the imposition of the three conditions program-\nwide, but stayed the injunction beyond the City of Chicago pending the appeal. Id. at 882. \nThe Attorney General now appeals that decision as to all three of the conditions. \n\nB. Challenge to FY 2018 grant \nIn the second of the two cases consolidated in this appeal, Chicago raises identical \nchallenges to the notice, access and compliance conditions, and also challenges the \nharboring condition and the additional certification requirement.  The district court held that \n[2]\nthe notice, access, and compliance conditions were materially identical to the conditions it \nhad already enjoined in the case challenging the FY 2017 grant conditions, and that the \nnew compliance condition referencing § 1644 was indistinguishable from the § 1373 \ncompliance condition and therefore unlawful under the same reasoning. As to the additional \ncertification requirement, the court first recognized that the Executive possesses no inherent \nauthority to impose conditions on the payment of federal funds authorized by the \nLegislature, and that the Attorney General had failed to identify any source of authority as to \nthe imposition of the additional certification requirement. The district court nevertheless \nproceeded to analyze whether any statutory basis for the Attorney General's authority was \napparent. \nThe court first noted that the Byrne JAG statute itself provided no such authority, and in fact \nstrictly delineated the formula for the distribution of grant funds. The court then noted that it \nhad already held, with respect to the notice and access conditions, that § 10102(a)(6) did \nnot provide such authority. The court further held that the statutes enumerated in the \nadditional certification requirement applied only to the federal government and did not \nrequire cities or localities to do anything, and therefore the Attorney General could not \nrequire compliance with those statutes as an \"applicable federal law\" under § \n10153(A)(5)(D). Finally, the court addressed the harboring condition. After again noting that \n§ 10102(a)(6) cannot provide a source of such authority, the court considered the Attorney \nGeneral's argument that 34 U.S.C. §§ 10102(a)(2) and (4) authorize the imposition of the \nharboring condition. Those sections require the Assistant Attorney General to maintain \nliaison with the executive and judicial branches of the federal and state governments, public \nand private educational and research institutions, state and local governments, and \ngovernments of other nations, relating to criminal justice. The district court held that §§ \n10102(a)(2) and (4) contain no delegation of authority to place a harboring condition on \nByrne JAG grantees, but rather are more plausibly read as an instruction that the Assistant \nAttorney General maintain bilateral communications with state and local governments. \nII. Analysis—Overview. \nAs we discussed in Chicago I, this appeal is not about optimal federal or state immigration \npolicies. That is not for the court to discuss or decide. Rather, the issues before us to-day \nconcern the spheres of power that reside in the state rather than in the federal government, \nand the critical balance of power between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of \nthe federal government. Chicago, in deciding that its law enforcement needs would be \nbetter met if its undocumented residents could report crimes and communicate with its \npolice force without fear of immigration consequences, is exercising its police power—an \narea of power long recognized as resting with the states. The Attorney General now seeks \nto pursue the federal government's interest in enforcing its immigration laws. Regulating \nimmigration into this country is a legitimate federal interest, and the executive branch \nincluding the Attorney General has authority to enforce the nation's immigration laws. But \n\nthe methods the executive employs in pursuit of those legitimate ends must be lawful and, \nin this case, the means the Attorney General has chosen are not lawful. The federal \ngovernment cannot merely conscript the police forces of the state or local governments to \nachieve its ends; that would eviscerate the principles of federalism that rest at the very \nfoundation of our government. \nThe Attorney General's use of extra-statutory conditions on federal grant awards as a tool to \nobtain compliance with his policy objectives strikes at the heart of another core value, which \nis the separation of powers among the branches of the federal government. The authority to \npass laws and the power of the purse rest in the legislative not the executive branch. The \ncomposition of the legislature—with elected representatives and dual chambers—provides \ninstitutional protection from the abuse of such power. But no such institutional protection \nfrom abuse exists should such power be concentrated in the executive branch, where one \nindividual—whether the President or the Attorney General or another official—determined to \nimpose his or her policy preferences regardless of the will of Congress, could proceed \nunimpeded by the types of institutional checks present in the legislative body. Such a \nconcentration of power would allow tyranny to flourish, and our system of government is \nwisely set up by the Founders to foreclose such a danger. The executive branch has \nsignificant powers of its own— particularly in matters such as immigration—but the power to \nwield the purse to alter behavior rests squarely with the legislative branch. Congress has \nthus far refused to pass legislation that would do precisely what the Attorney General seeks \nto do here. \"Respecting the separation of powers forecloses no substantive outcomes. It \nonly requires us to respect along the way one of the most vital of the procedural protections \nof individual liberty found in our Constitution.\" Gundy v. United States, 139 S. Ct. 2116, \n2145 (2019)(Gorsuch, J., dissenting). \nArticle I of the Constitution vests the power to legislate with Congress, not the \nExecutive. Id. at 2123. Therefore, \"when Congress confers decisionmaking authority upon \nagencies Congress must `lay down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the \nperson or body authorized to [act] is directed to conform.'\" (emphasis in original) Whitman v. \nAm. Trucking Ass'ns, 531 U.S. 457, 472 (2001), quoting J.W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United \nStates, 276 U.S. 394, 409 (1928). \nIII. Notice, Access, Harboring and Additional \nCertification Conditions \nFor his authority to impose the conditions, the Attorney General points to 34 U.S.C. § \n10102, which sets forth the duties and functions of the Assistant Attorney General as \nfollows: \n(a) Specific, general and delegated powers \nThe Assistant Attorney General shall— \n(1) publish and disseminate information on the conditions and progress of the criminal \njustice systems; \n\n(2) maintain liaison with the executive and judicial branches of the Federal and State \ngovernments in matters relating to criminal justice; \n(3) provide information to the President, the Congress, the judiciary, State and local \ngovernments, and the general public relating to criminal justice; \n(4) maintain liaison with public and private educational and research institutions, State and \nlocal governments, and governments of other nations relating to criminal justice; \n(5) coordinate and provide staff support to coordinate the activities of the Office and the \nBureau of Justice Assistance, the National Institute of Justice, the Bureau of Justice \nStatistics, the Office for Victims of Crime, and the Office of Juvenile Justice and \nDelinquency Prevention; and \n(6) exercise such other powers and functions as may be vested in the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral pursuant to this chapter or by delegation of the Attorney General, including placing \nspecial conditions on all grants, and determining priority purposes for formula grants. \n34 U.S.C. § 10102. \nThe Attorney General argues that §§ 10102(a)(2), (4), and \n(6) provide authority for him to impose the substantive conditions on the Byrne JAG grant. \nSpecifically, he points to § 10102(a)(6) as allowing virtually unlimited authority to place \nconditions on grants and therefore allowing the imposition of the notice, access, harboring \nand additional certification conditions. He further points to the provisions in §§ 10102(a)(2) \nand (4) empowering the Assistant Attorney General to \"maintain liaison\" as further authority \nfor the harboring condition. \nA. Section 10102(a)(6) \nWe turn first to the notice and access conditions, which we previously addressed in the \nappeal from the grant of a preliminary injunction. Chicago I, 888 F.3d 272. The district court \nimposed a preliminary injunction as to those notice and access conditions, and in Chicago \nI we upheld that preliminary injunction. The standard for preliminary injunctive relief requires \nonly a showing of a likelihood of success on the merits, whereas permanent relief requires a \ndetermination on the merits. Amoco Prod. Co. v. Vill. of Gambell, AK, 480 U.S. 531, 546 \nn.12 (1987). As to the challenge to the notice and access conditions, however, this is a \ndistinction without a difference. \nOur reasoning in Chicago I established Chicago's entitlement to relief on the merits, not \nmerely a likelihood of success. The Attorney General relied on 34 U.S.C. § 10102(a)(6) as \nproviding the statutory authority to impose both of those conditions. \nSubsection (a)(6) provides that the Assistant Attorney General shall \"exercise such other \npowers and functions as may be vested in the Assistant Attorney General pursuant to this \nchapter or by delegation of the Attorney General, including placing special conditions on all \ngrants, and determining priority purposes for formula grants.\" § 10102(a)(6) (emphasis \nadded). During the first appeal, we held that the plain meaning of that language was to \ndelineate the subcategory of powers and functions that the Assistant Attorney General \ncould exercise when vested in the Assistant Attorney General either by the terms of this \nchapter or by delegation of the Attorney General. Chicago I, 888 F.3d at 285; accord New \n\nYork, 951 F.3d at 102, City of Philadelphia v. Atty. Gen. of United States, 916 F.3d 276, 287 \n(3d Cir. 2019), City & Cnty. of San Francisco v. Sessions, 372 F. Supp. 3d 928, 943 n.4 \n(N.D. Cal. 2019). The \"inescapable problem\" with the Attorney General's interpretation, \nhowever, was that he did not even claim that the power exercised here was authorized \nanywhere in the chapter, nor could he claim that the Attorney General possesses that \nauthority and could delegate it to the Assistant Attorney General. Chicago I, 888 F.3d at \n285. And the plain language of § 10102(a)(6) precludes an interpretation that it is a \nstandalone grant of power unrelated to the authority granted in the chapter or the authority \ngranted to the Attorney General. Id. \nWe further noted that our plain reading of the statute was consistent with the structure of § \n10102 and the Byrne JAG program itself. Id. at 285-86. In contrast to discretionary grants, \nthe Byrne JAG program was a formula grant program, with strictly-circumscribed provisions \nallocating award amounts and penalties. An interpretation of § 10102(a)(6) that would \nauthorize the wholesale denial of all grant funds would be a radical departure from the \notherwise carefully-de-lineated rules for the awarding and the withholding of funds, and one \nwould expect such a significant power to be unmistakable in its language and to be \nconnected to the Byrne JAG (or grant awards in general) by reference. We noted that \n`[a] clause in a catch-all provision at the end of a list of explicit powers would be an odd \nplace indeed to put a sweeping power to impose any conditions on any grants—a power \nmuch more significant than all of the duties and powers that precede it in the listing, and a \npower granted to the Assistant Attorney General that was not granted to the Attorney \nGeneral.... As the Supreme Court has repeatedly held, `Congress ... does not alter the \nfundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions—it does \nnot, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.' \nId. at 285-87, quoting Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U.S. 243, 267 (2006); Philadelphia, 916 \nF.3d at 288. We will not repeat that analysis here, but it applies equally in the context of a \npermanent injunction. No new meritorious arguments have been raised by the Attorney \nGeneral as to those conditions in this appeal. Accordingly, we adopt and incorporate the \nreasoning from Section III of that opinion in this appeal. Chicago I, 888 F.3d at 282-87. For \nthe reasons stated in Chicago I, the district court did not err in granting permanent injunctive \nrelief as to the notice and access conditions. The Attorney General relies on § 10102(a)(6) \nas the authority to impose the additional certification and harboring conditions as well, and \nour rejection of that argument in Chicago I forecloses the argument as to those conditions \nas well.  \n[3]\nB. Sections 10102(a)(2) and (4) \nThe Attorney General attempts to salvage the harboring condition by pointing to a different \nportion of § 10102—the subsections that instruct the Assistant Attorney General to maintain \nliaisons with other entities—in (a)(2), \"with the executive and judicial branches of the \nFederal and State governments in matters relating to criminal justice,\" and in (a)(4) \"with \npublic and private educational and research institutions, State and local governments, and \ngovernments of other nations relating to criminal justice.\" That language entrusts the \nAssistant Attorney General with maintaining lines of communication with other entities, and \nis sandwiched between a recitation of other relatively-ministerial duties of the Assistant \n\nAttorney General including the power to: \"publish and disseminate information on the \nconditions and progress of the criminal justice systems [in (a)(1)], ... provide information to \nthe President, the Congress, the judiciary, State and local governments, and the general \npublic relating to criminal justice [in (a)(3),] ... [and] coordinate and provide staff support to \ncoordinate the activities of the Office and the Bureau of Justice Assistance, the National \nInstitute of Justice, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the Office for Victims of Crime, and the \nOffice of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention [in (a)(5)].\" 34 U.S.C. §§ 10102(a)(1), \n(3), (5); Chicago I, 888 F.3d at 287. \nNothing in that language even references, let alone authorizes, the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral to impose conditions on the distribution of funds authorized by \nCongress. See State of Oregon v. Trump, 406 F. Supp. 3d 940, 969 (2019) (holding that the \ndefinition of liaison does not even hint at a punitive aspect, \"let alone a discretionary \nauthority to completely dissolve relations when one side does not abide by the wishes of the \nother,\" and that the structure of the statute also weighs against the Attorney General's \ninterpretation); San Francisco, 372 F. Supp. 3d at 944 (noting that \"[t]he structure of Section \n10102 does not support the contention that `maintain liaison' in Section 10102(a)(2) \nprovides more than a ministerial duty on the Attorney General to maintain communication \nwith other Federal and State agencies.\"). It would strain statutory interpretation to the \nbreaking point to interpret a provision that requires the fostering of communication as \nhanding to the Assistant Attorney General the power to withhold the entire Byrne JAG \naward for the failure to comply with substantive conditions imposed by the Attorney General \n— particularly given that the language in the Byrne JAG grant sets forth highly detailed and \nprecise circumstances that would justify the withholding of funds and the percentages that \ncan be withheld. See Chicago I, 888 F.3d at 286-87. \nMoreover, the language in subsections (a)(2) and (4) could not support the harboring \ncondition even if we were to ignore the problem that the language itself does not authorize \nthe imposition of conditions. Both subsections address the power to maintain \nliaisons relating to criminal justice matters. But the harboring condition that the Attorney \nGeneral seeks to impose on the Byrne JAG grant is explicitly not targeted to criminal \nmatters. The harboring condition prohibits the recipient jurisdiction from making any \"public \ndisclosure ... of any federal law enforcement information in a direct or indirect attempt to \nconceal, harbor, or shield from detection any fugitive from justice under 18 U.S.C. ch. 49, or \nany alien who has come to, entered, or remains in the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. \nch. 12—without regard to whether such disclosure would constitute (or could form a \npredicate for) a violation of [federal criminal law provisions] 18 U.S.C. 1071 or 1072 or of 8 \nU.S.C. 1324(a).\" (emphasis added) Chicago, 405 F. Supp. 3d at 754-55. Thus, it would \nwithhold funds even regarding disclosures that related only to civil immigration and not the \nmore narrow category of criminal immigration matters. And it is being used by the Attorney \nGeneral to target Chicago's Welcoming City Ordinance, which explicitly allows the City to \ncooperate in criminal, as opposed to civil, immigration matters. The Attorney General \ncannot rely on a provision encouraging communications as to criminal justice matters as \nauthority to deny funds for disclosures related only to civil matters. See San Francisco, 372 \nF. Supp. 3d at 945 (holding that the scope of the harboring condition exceeds the ministerial \nduty to maintain liaison). For that reason as well, §§ 10102(a)(2) and (4) do not provide \nauthority for the harboring condition. \n\nIV. Compliance Condition. \nWe turn, then, to the compliance condition, which requires the state or local government to \ncertify that it will not restrict its own officials from communicating information regarding the \ncitizenship or immigration status of any individual. The burden of that requirement is not \ninsignificant. For instance, in City & Cnty. of San Francisco v. Sessions, 349 F. Supp. 3d \n924, 952 (N.D. Cal. 2018), considering only detainer requests, the district court noted that \n\"California's law enforcement agencies experienced double the detainer requests from ICE \nin one year—from 15,000 in fiscal year 2016 to 30,000 in fiscal year 2017.\" Under the \nAttorney General's compliance condition, a state or local government could not instruct its \nown employees that they must devote their time to law enforcement tasks that it deems a \nhigher priority rather than respond to those information requests from ICE. \nThe compliance condition was not before this court in the prior appeal. The district court had \ndenied preliminary relief as to that condition and Chicago did not cross-appeal that issue to \nthis court. At the permanent injunction stage, however, the court reversed course and \ngranted injunctive relief as to that condition as well based on the Supreme Court's decision \nin Murphy v. Nat'l Collegiate Athletic Ass'n, 138 S. Ct. 1461 (2018), which had been issued \nin the interim. \nA. District Court Analysis \nIn the \"Overview of Legal Requirements Generally Applicable to OJP [Office of Justice \nPrograms] Grants and Cooperative Agreements — FY 2017 Awards,\" (hereinafter \n\"Overview of Legal Requirements\"), the Attorney General declared that he was imposing \nthe compliance condition \"[c]onsistent with OJP's statutory authority to impose grant \nconditions, including 42 U.S.C. 3712 [now found at 34 U.S.C. § 10102].\" See Dist. Ct. R. 26, \nExh. M. As with the notice and access conditions, the Attorney General points to § \n10102(a)(6) as authorizing the Assistant Attorney General to place special conditions on all \ngrants and determine priority purposes for formula grants. We rejected that interpretation \nin Chicago I as to the notice and access provisions, and we have adopted that rationale in \nthis appeal as well. The Attorney General's reliance on § 10102(a)(6) fails for the same \nreason when applied to the compliance condition. \nDespite his declaration that the grant condition would be imposed pursuant to his power \nunder § 10102, in the district court and on appeal the Attorney General primarily anchors \nthe compliance condition to 34 U.S.C. § 10153(A)(5)(D) (hereinafter \"§ 10153\"). That \nprovision states that in a request for a grant, the application \"shall include ... [a] certification, \nmade in a form acceptable to the Attorney General ... that ... the applicant will comply with \nall provisions of this part and all other applicable Federal laws.\" (emphasis added) The \nAttorney General argues that the italicized portion allows him to require that applicants \ncertify compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373. \nSection 1373 provides: \n(a) In general \n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of Federal, State, or local law, a Federal, State, or local \ngovernment entity or official may not prohibit, or in any way restrict, any government entity \nor official from sending to, or receiving from, the Immigration and Naturalization Service \ninformation regarding the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any \nindividual. \n(b) Additional authority of government entities \nNotwithstanding any other provision of Federal, State, or local law, no person or agency \nmay prohibit, or in any way restrict, a Federal, State, or local government entity from doing \nany of the following with respect to information regarding the immigration status, lawful or \nunlawful, of any individual: \n(1) Sending such information to, or requesting or receiving such information from, the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service. \n(2) Maintaining such information. \n(3) Exchanging such information with any other Federal, State, or local government entity. \n(c) Obligation to respond to inquiries \nThe Immigration and Naturalization Service shall respond to an inquiry by a Federal, State, \nor local government agency, seeking to verify or ascertain the citizenship or immigration \nstatus of any individual within the jurisdiction of the agency for any purpose authorized by \nlaw, by providing the requested verification or status information. \nUnder the Attorney General's reasoning, Congress itself incorporated § 1373 into the Byrne \nJAG program by requiring compliance with \"all other applicable federal laws.\" And the \nAttorney General interprets the requirements of § 1373 incredibly broadly, maintaining that \nthe information as to \"citizenship or immigration status\" incorporates information beyond an \nindividual's immigration status, including, for instance, an alien prisoner's release date. \nThe district court interpreted the term \"all other applicable federal laws\" as encompassing all \nfederal law. City of Chicago, 321 F. Supp. 3d at 875. The court held that if Congress wanted \nto limit the term to include just a specific body of federal grant-making laws, it could have \ndone so, but that the language \"all other applicable federal law\" includes any federal law \nthat applies to Chicago. Id. Because § 1373 is a federal law, the court held that § 10153 \nwould require applicants to certify compliance with it. Id. \nBut the district court then considered whether § 1373 was itself constitutional, reasoning \nthat an unconstitutional law could not constitute an \"applicable law\" under § 10153. The \ncourt held that § 1373 violated the anticommandeering doctrine of the Tenth Amendment in \nlight of the Supreme Court's decision in Murphy, 138 S. Ct. 1461. City of Chicago, 321 F. \nSupp. 3d at 866-73, 875. In Murphy, the Court made clear that regardless of whether a \nfederal law commands state action or precludes it, Congress cannot issue direct orders to \nstate legislatures. Murphy, 138 S. Ct. at 1478. Accordingly, the language in § 1373 could be \nproblematic under the Tenth Amendment even if it merely operated to preclude the state \nfrom taking certain actions. The district court then considered the language of § 1373, which \nbars any government entity or official from prohibiting, or in any way restricting, any other \ngovernment entity or official from exchanging information with federal immigration \nauthorities, and also prohibits any person or agency from doing the same. The court held \nthat Chicago had challenged § 1373 as an independent statute, and concluded that it was \nunconstitutional under the anti-commandeering doctrine of the Tenth Amendment. City of \nChicago, 321 F. Supp. 3d at 867, 869. The court noted that a state's ability to control its \n\noffices and employees is at the heart of state sovereignty and that § 1373 violates that in a \nnumber of ways: first, it supplants local control of officers, precluding Chicago and other \nlocalities from limiting the amount of paid time its employees use to communicate with \nfederal immigration authorities; second, it indirectly constrains local rule-making by \nprecluding local lawmakers from passing laws that implement the localities' preferred \npolicies, such as the Welcoming City Ordinance, which run counter to § 1373—a concern \nsquarely addressed in Murphy; third, it redistributes local decision-making power by \ntransferring that power from local policymakers to line-level employees who are empowered \nto decide for themselves whether or not to communicate with immigration authorities; and \nfinally, because it eliminates the ability of a locality such as Chicago to control its \nemployees' communications with federal immigration authorities, § 1373 prevents that \nlocality from extricating itself from federal immigration enforcement, thus foreclosing the \n\"critical alternative\" recognized in New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 177 (1992), of \nthe option of non-participation in a federal program. City of Chicago, 321 F. Supp. 3d at \n869-70. The court concluded that § 1373 was unconstitutional on its face and, as an \nunconstitutional law, it could not be considered an \"applicable federal law\" for purposes of § \n10153. Id. at 875-76. It rejected the Attorney General's baseless argument that even an \nunconstitutional law could be considered an \"applicable federal law\" under § 10153. \nB. Section 10153 \nThe Attorney General challenges those conclusions on appeal, but we need not address the \ndistrict court's compelling analysis of that Tenth Amendment issue, because we hold that \nthe term \"all other applicable federal law\" cannot be construed so broadly as to encompass \n§ 1373. Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 241 (2009) (noting the court's long-time \npractice of \"constitutional avoidance,\" where courts do not pass on questions of \nconstitutionality unless such adjudication is unavoidable). Our analysis begins with the plain \nlanguage of § 10153, interpreted not in a vacuum, but in light of the context and the \nstatutory structure as a whole. Gundy, 139 S. Ct. at 2126; Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. \nHalderman, 451 U.S. 1, 18-19 (1981). Proper interpretation considers not only the specific \ncontext in which the language is used, but the overall structure of the statute as a whole, as \nwell as its history and purpose. Gundy, 139 S. Ct at 2126. \n1. Plain Language \nThe Attorney General argues that the term \"all other applicable federal law\" incorporates all \nfederal law that applies to states or localities. The immediate problem with that \ninterpretation is that it renders the words \"other applicable\" superfluous. See TRW Inc. v. \nAndrews, 534 U.S. 19, 31 (2001) (quoting Duncan v. Walker, 533 U.S. 167, 174 (2001)) \n(\"[i]t is `a cardinal principle of statutory construction' that `a statute ought, upon the whole, to \nbe so construed that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be \nsuperfluous, void, or insignificant.'\"); Philadelphia, 916 F.3d at 289 (\"the canon against \nsurplusage counsels us to read the term `applicable' in a way that gives it some \nindependent heft.\") If Congress meant to incorporate all law that applies to States or \nlocalities, that would be accomplished by requiring compliance with \"all federal law.\" Any \nfederal laws that did not apply to states or localities would simply be irrelevant in \nconsidering compliance, in that an entity could not fail to comply with a law that does not \n\nimpose any legal obligations on it, and therefore the term would not be overinclusive. By \nincluding only \"applicable\" federal laws, the provision encompasses only laws that apply by \ntheir terms to the award itself. \nThe natural reading of the phrase considers the language in the subsection as a whole: \n(A) To request a grant ... the ... State or unit of local government shall submit an application \nto the Attorney General ... in such form as the Attorney General may require. Such \napplication shall include the following: \n... \n(5) A certification, made in a form acceptable to the Attorney General and executed by the \nchief executive officer of the applicant (or by another officer of the applicant, if qualified \nunder regulations promulgated by the Attorney General), that— \n(A) the programs to be funded by the grant meet all the requirements of this part; \n(B) all the information contained in the application is correct; \n(C) there has been appropriate coordination with affected agencies; and \n(D) the applicant will comply with all provisions of this part and all other applicable Federal \nlaws. \n34 U.S.C. § 10153(A)(5). This provision relates to the grant application itself and \nconformance to all of its requirements. It provides for an assurance that the programs to be \nfunded by the grant meet all the requirements, that the information in the grant application is \ncorrect, that appropriate coordination with agencies affected by the grant has occurred, and \nthat the applicant will comply with all provisions of this part and \"all other applicable Federal \nlaws.\" The most natural reading of the last provision is that \"all other applicable\" laws refers \nto the many federal laws that apply specifically to grants or grantees. That is consistent with \nthe structure of the provision as a whole which addresses requirements related to the grant \nand the application for the grant itself. See City of Providence v. Barr, 2020 WL 1429579 at \n*11 (1st Cir. March 24, 2020); Philadelphia, 916 F.3d at 289 (noting that those four \nsubsections all relate to the programs that will be funded under the grant, thus counseling \nagainst a broader interpretation of the applicable laws clause); San Francisco, 349 F. Supp. \n3d at 954 (noting that all of the conditions preceding it apply to the grant itself). This reading \nalso tracks more closely to the language of § 10153(A)(5)(D) itself, which requires \ncertification that the \"applicant\" will comply with all provisions of this part and all other \napplicable federal laws, thus signaling that the requirement is tethered to the status of the \nstate and locality as a grant applicant and not merely as a governmental entity. \n2. Consistency with Other Statutes Applied \nThe language at issue is mirrored in a subsequent subchapter that also applies on its terms \nto the Byrne JAG program, and provides: \nWhenever, after reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing on the record in \naccordance with section 554 of Title 5, the Bureau of Justice Assistance, the National \nInstitute of Justice, and the Bureau of Justice Statistics finds that a recipient of assistance \nunder this chapter has failed to comply substantially with— \n(1) any provisions of this chapter; \n(2) any regulations or guidelines promulgated under this chapter; or \n\n(3) any application submitted in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, or the \nprovisions of any other applicable Federal Act; \nthe Director involved shall, until satisfied that there is no longer any such failure to comply, \nterminate payments to the recipient under this chapter, reduce payments to the recipient \nunder this chapter by an amount equal to the amount of such payments which were not \nexpended in accordance with this chapter, or limit the availability of payments under this \nchapter to programs, projects, or activities not affected by such failure to comply. \n(emphasis added) 34 U.S.C. § 10222. Again, the statute speaks in terms of the \"recipient of \nassistance under this chapter\" complying with \"the provisions of any other applicable \nFederal law,\" thus signaling that the laws that would be \"applicable\" are laws that refer \nspecifically to grant recipients, not any laws that apply generally to states or localities. The \nreference to \"other\" applicable Federal law is a nod to the requirements that precede it, \nwhich all relate to the grant itself and regulations relating to it. Specifically, preceding the \"all \nother applicable Federal law\" provision are the requirements that the recipient of assistance \ncomply substantially with provisions of that chapter, regulations or guidelines promulgated \nunder that chapter, and applications submitted in accordance with the provisions of this \nchapter. All of those requirements directly relate to the requirements specific to the subject \nmatter of the grants. The most natural reading of the phrase \"all other applicable Federal \nlaw,\" then, is that it includes laws relating to grant recipients that appear outside this specific \nchapter of the United States Code. \nAnd that is true of the same language in § 10153(A)(5)(D) as well. Because many federal \nlaws explicitly apply to federal grantees, the most natural reading of § 10153 as a whole is \nthat it requires the applicant to certify that it will comply with all of those federal laws that \napply, by their terms, to successful grant applicants. That is consistent with the other listed \nprovisions in § 10153(A)(5) which relate to the grant itself—either in assuring that it is \nawarded based on correct information, or that it is pursued in proper coordination with \naffected agencies, or, in the part at issue here, that it will be in compliance with all the grant \nrequirements in this part or other parts of federal law. It is also reflected in the OJP's own \nexplanation of grant requirements as set forth in its Overview of Legal Requirements, which \nexplains that \"[e]ach recipient of an OJP grant or cooperative agreements must comply with \nall federal statutes and regulations applicable to the award, as well as the particular award \nconditions included in the award document.\" (emphasis added) Dist. Ct. R. 26, Exh. M.; see \nalso id. (providing applicant an overview of statutes and award conditions \"that apply \nto many (or in some cases, all) OJP grants and cooperative agreements awarded in 2017\") \n(emphasis added). As that language makes clear, the connection of the law to the award \nitself is what renders a particular federal law \"applicable.\"  \n[4]\nSuch statutes directly applying to grants and grant recipients are plentiful, and the Byrne \nJAG program explicitly identifies a number of them in its application. In fact, a review of the \nother federal laws referenced in the application reveals a clear pattern of laws that explicitly \napply to those receiving federal funds. The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance \nGrant Program FY 2017 Local Solicitation directs applicants to the web pages accessible \nthrough the \"Overview of Legal Requirements Generally Applicable to OJP Grants and \nCooperative agreements — FY 2017 Awards\" for a general overview of the important \nstatutes and regulations that apply to the grant. Appellant's Appendix, No. 18-2885, at \nA175. That source identifies a number of federal laws that apply to the grant, and those \n\nlaws are identified in the grant award itself as well. See id. at A50-A69. Unlike § 1373, \nhowever, those laws by their very language apply expressly to grants and recipients of \ngrants. For instance, the laws include: \n18 U.S.C. § 1913—Lobbying with appropriated moneys, which provides that \"[n]o part of the \nmoney appropriated by any enactment of Congress shall, in the absence of express \nauthorization by Congress, be used directly or indirectly to pay for any personal service, \nadvertisement, [etc.] ... intended or designed to influence in any manner a Member of \nCongress ....\" \n22 U.S.C. § 7104—Prevention of trafficking, which in § 1704(g) provides that \"the President \nshall ensure that any grant ... provided or entered into by a Federal department or agency \nunder which funds are to be provided to a private entity, in whole or in part, shall include a \ncondition that authorizes the department or agency to terminate the grant ... if the grantee or \nany subgrantee ... engages in ... (1) severe forms of trafficking in persons ....\" \n41 U.S.C. § 4712(a)(1)—Enhancement of contractor protection from reprisal for disclosure \nof certain information, providing that \"[a]n employee of a ... grantee, or subgrantee ... may \nnot be discharged, demoted or otherwise discriminated against as a reprisal for disclosing \nto a person or body described in paragraph (2) information that the employee reasonably \nbelieves is evidence of gross mismanagement of a Federal contract or grant ....\" \n28 C.F.R. § 54.100—Title IX regulation \"designed to eliminate (with certain exceptions) \ndiscrimination on the basis of sex in any education program or activity receiving Federal \nfinancial assistance, whether or not such program or activity is offered or sponsored by an \neducational institution ....\" \n28 C.F.R. § 42.102-42.105—Title VI of the Civil Rights Act—prohibits discrimination on the \nground of race, color, or national origin and \"applies to any program for which Federal \nassistance is authorized under a law administered by the Department,\" with Federal \nfinancial assistance defined as including \"grants and loans of Federal funds.\" It also \nrequires that \"[e]very application for Federal financial assistance to which this subpart \napplies ... shall, as a condition to its approval and the extension of any Federal financial \nassistance pursuant to the application, contain or be accompanied by an assurance that the \nprogram will be conducted or the facility operated in compliance with all requirements \nimposed by or pursuant to this subpart.\" \n31 U.S.C. § 1352—Limitation on use of appropriated funds to influence certain Federal \ncontracting and financial transactions, providing that \"[n]one of the funds appropriated by \nany Act may be expended by the recipient of a Federal... grant ... to pay any person for \ninfluencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a Member of \nCongress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a Member of Congress in \nconnection with [federal contracts].\" \n(emphasis added). Those statutes and regulations also provide specific remedies tailored to \neach provision for violations—ranging from civil penalties to abatement measures to grant \ntermination—in contrast to §1373 for which the Attorney General himself has determined \nthat wholesale withholding of the entire grant is the remedy for noncompliance. See, \ne.g., 31 U.S.C. § 1352(a)-(c) incorporated by reference in 18 U.S.C. § 1913, 22 U.S.C. § \n7104(g), 41 U.S.C. § 4712(c). Section 1373, therefore, represents a departure from the \nother federal law incorporated into the grant. In fact, the Third Circuit in Philadelphia, 916 \nF.3d at 290, considered the history as to which laws the Justice Department included under \nthe applicable laws clause, and noted that \"[e]very condition that is authorized by the \n\nApplicable Laws Clause applies specifically to programs funded under the grant, not more \ngenerally to the grantee.\" \nC. Problems with AG's Interpretation \nThe Attorney General's interpretation of the compliance provision, in contrast, would expand \nthat provision far beyond the context of the grant and its application, to encompass the \nbroad, unrelated array of federal laws that apply to states or local governments regardless \nof their connection to this or any grant. Moreover, as we will explain, the Attorney General's \ninterpretation would: (1) allow the executive to impose conditions that Congress repeatedly \ndeclined to institute itself; (2) allow the Attorney General in his discretion to impose a \nsubstantive qualifying condition on a grant that Congress explicitly established as a formula \nrather than a discretionary grant; (3) render irrelevant or illogical other provisions in the \nByrne JAG statute and raise constitutional concerns; and (4) conflict with another statutory \nprovision. As such, it is inconsistent with the bedrock principles of separation of powers and \nfederalism, and the district court properly granted injunctive and declaratory relief. \n1. \nAlthough the Attorney General interprets § 10153 as requiring compliance with § 1373, \nCongress has repeatedly refused to pass legislation that would do precisely that, as we \nrecognized in Chicago I: \nIn the past few years, numerous pieces of legislation were introduced in the House and \nSenate seeking to condition federal funding on compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373—which \nwas intended to address \"sanctuary cities\" and prohibit federal, state or local government \nofficials or entities from restricting the exchange of information with the immigration \nauthorities regarding citizenship or immigration status. None of those efforts were passed \nby Congress. See, e.g., Stop Dangerous Sanctuary Cities Act, H.R. 5654, 114th Cong. § 4 \n(2016); Stop Dangerous Sanctuary Cities Act, S. 3100, 114th Cong. § 4 (2016); Enforce the \nLaw for Sanctuary Cities Act, H.R. 3009, 114th Cong. § 3 (2015); Mobilizing Against \nSanctuary Cities Act, H.R. 3002, 114th Cong. § 2 (2015); Stop Sanctuary Policies and \nProtect Americans Act, S. 2146, 114th Cong. § 3(a) (2015); Stop Sanctuary Cities Act, S. \n1814, 114th Cong. § 2 (2015) (all available at https://www.congress.gov). see also Annie \nLai & Christopher N. Lasch, Crimmigration Resistance and the Case of Sanctuary City \nDefunding, 57 Santa Clara L. Rev. 539, 553 n. 87 (2017) (listing eight pieces of legislation \nintroduced during that time, all of which were unsuccessful). \nChicago I, 888 F.3d at 277-78. The Attorney General's reading would thus allow the \nExecutive Branch to override Congress' refusal to endorse § 1373 compliance and would \neffectively \"legislate\" a different result. \n2. \nSecond, the Attorney General's interpretation would vest the executive branch with \nunbridled power to identify select federal laws and impose them as a precondition for the \n\nreceipt of federal grant money allocated by Congress. That discretionary authority is \nfundamentally inconsistent with the nature of the Byrne JAG grant as a formula grant, \nlocated in a separate section of the Act than the discretionary grants. See generally Bureau \nof Justice Assistance Grant Program, 34 U.S.C. § 10151 et seq. As a formula grant rather \nthan a discretionary grant, the grant awarded is a function of the state or local government's \nproportionate crime rate and population, and is incompatible with the sort of unbridled \ndiscretion that the Attorney General's interpretation would yield. See Philadelphia, 916 F.3d \nat 290 (noting that Congress structured the Byrne JAG program as a formula grant, and that \nallowing the withholding of funds \"because a jurisdiction does not certify compliance with \nany federal law of the Attorney General's choosing undermines the predictability and \nconsistency embedded in the program's design, thus turning the formula grant into a \ndiscretionary one.\").  \n[5]\nThe Attorney General dismisses this as a non-issue, declaring that the States and local \ngovernments were already subject to those laws and therefore the certification of \ncompliance imposes no burden or barrier. He disclaims any role in determining which laws \nwill be applied, stating that his interpretation \"does not require compliance with laws \n`selected at the Attorney General's uncabined discretion.'\" Reply Brief, No. 18-2885, at 5. \nInstead, he declares that he is \"not urging that the Attorney General has discretion to select \napplicable laws; rather, Congress has made laws applicable to Chicago, and Chicago must \ncomply with them.\" Id. at 5-6. But that argument is utterly inconsistent with the application \nprocess that the Attorney General has actually implemented and is meritless. \nFirst, the grant application does not purport to track compliance with the entire universe of \nfederal law. Instead, the Attorney General has singled out particular federal laws which act \nas a gatekeeper to control and limit access to the grant. That is apparent in the language of \nthe application— which identifies specific statutes—and also in the Attorney General's \napparent absence of concern with the multitudes of other federal laws that apply by their \nterms to states and cities, such as OSHA requirements or EPA regulations or any other \nfederal constitutional, statutory or regulatory law. In fact, the Attorney General has singled \nout § 1373 and required a separate certification of compliance for that statute alone, with \npenalties for false statements or omissions ranging from civil penalties to criminal \nprosecution. Rather than conditioning the award of the grant on evidence that the state or \nlocal government is in compliance with all federal laws that by their terms apply to states or \nlocal governments, the Attorney General conditions the award on a certification that the \nstate or locality is in compliance with one specific law—§ 1373—as is trumpeted in the \nfollowing notice to grant applicants: \nAlert: New Requirements for Certain FY 2017 Programs \nConsistent with OJP's statutory authority to impose grant conditions, including 42 U.S.C. \n3712, OJP will include—in an award document sent to a prospective FY 2017 Edward \nByrne Justice Assistance Grant (\"Byrne JAG\") recipient for acceptance—express award \nconditions concerning ongoing compliance with 8 U.S.C. 1373, throughout the award \nperiod, in the \"program or activity\" funded by the award. (In general, section 1373 bars \nrestrictions on communication between State and local agencies and officials and the \nDepartment of Homeland Security (and certain other entities) with respect to information \nregarding the citizenship or immigration status of any individual.) States and units of local \ngovernment that apply for awards under the FY 2017 Byrne JAG Program will be required— \n\nprior to award acceptance—to submit a specific certification from the chief legal officer of \nthe jurisdiction regarding the applicant's compliance with 8 U.S.C. 1373(a) and (b). \nInterested applicants may view a sample certification document at \nhttps://ojp.gov/funding/Explore/SampleCertifications-8USC1373.htm. \nIn addition, consistent with OJP's statutory authority, OJP will include in any FY 2017 Byrne \nJAG award (as part of the award document) additional express conditions that, with respect \nto the \"program or activity\" that would be funded by the FY 2017 award, are designed to \nensure that States and units of local government that receive funds from the FY 2017 Byrne \nJAG award: (1) permit personnel of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") to \naccess any correctional or detention facility in order to meet with an alien (or an individual \nbelieved to be an alien) and inquire as to his or her right to be or remain in the United \nStates; and (2) provide at least 48 hours' advance notice to DHS regarding the scheduled \nrelease date and time of an alien in the jurisdiction's custody when DHS requests such \nnotice in order to take custody of the alien pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act. \nOverview of Legal Requirements, Dist. Ct. R. 26, Exh. M. That alert to future grant \napplicants expressly recognizes that the OJP has selected one federal statute to impose as \na grant condition with requirements of certification that are specific to that statute. Its \ncontention that Congress, rather than the Attorney General, has selected the laws that will \nconstitute conditions of the grant is patently false. \nThe argument that the certificate of compliance imposes no burden because government \nentities were already required to follow the law fails for an additional reason. The \nidentification of a federal law as an \"other applicable law\" for receipt of the grant imposes a \npenalty on the violation of that law that would otherwise not exist. It transforms every federal \nlegal obligation into a potential basis to withhold funding that has been designated by \nCongress for disbursement to state and local governments for law enforcement. Yet that \npenalty for non-compliance is not a penalty set forth by Congress in those other statutes. \nTherefore, the interpretation by the Attorney General which could transform any federal law \ninto a condition of the grant would indeed impose a burden not already provided by the \nfederal law itself, in the form of a steep financial penalty. In fact, that \"penalty\" could extend \nwell beyond the denial of the Byrne JAG grant if the Attorney General's interpretation of \"all \nother applicable federal law\" is adopted. It would allow the Attorney General to withhold \nmyriad other grants that have been authorized by Congress because that precise term is \nused in numerous other statutes—often as part of a statutory section that mirrors the one in \nthe Byrne JAG grant at issue here—including statutes providing grants under: the \nComprehensive Opioid Abuse Grant Program, 34 U.S.C. § 10702; Matching Grant Program \nfor School Security, 34 U.S.C. § 10552; Career and Technical Education Assistance to the \nStates, 20 U.S.C. § 2322; and the Bureau of Justice Assistance Discretionary Grants, 34 \nU.S.C. § 10181. \nInterpreting that language as potentially incorporating any federal law would vest the \nAttorney General with the power to deprive state or local governments of a wide variety of \ngrants, based on those entities' failure to comply with whatever federal law the Attorney \nGeneral deems critical. Yet there is nothing in those statutes that even hints that Congress \nintended to make those grants dependent on the Attorney General's whim as to which laws \nto apply, cabined only by the requirement that the laws apply generally to states or \nlocalities. That anomalous result is avoided if we interpret the term \"all other applicable \n\nfederal law\" to incorporate federal laws that explicitly apply to grants or grant recipients. As \nto those federal laws, Congress clearly intended them to apply to states and local \ngovernments applying for federal grants, and to impact those grants. \nThe potential for abuse is apparent. Here, the Attorney General has used the broad \ninterpretation of \"other applicable law\" as a means of hijacking the legislatively-established \nByrne JAG program to further particular policy goals of the Executive, despite the repeated \nrefusal of Congress to impose such a prerequisite itself. The open-ended ability to choose \nfederal laws at will would allow the targeting of states or policy issues if the Attorney \nGeneral chose to do so. For instance, the Attorney General could effectively isolate specific \nstates by requiring certification of compliance with federal law regarding controlled \nsubstances, thus disqualifying states or local governments that have legalized or \ndecriminalized marijuana, or by requiring a certification of compliance with federal \nconstitutional law such as Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), thus eliminating grant funding \nfor states that recently have passed \"heartbeat bills\" and other legislation designed to \nchallenge Roe. That would transform the highly-structured formula grant into one that \nvested total in the Attorney General to impose barriers to the grant through his choice as to \nwhich other federal laws to target as grant conditions.  \n[6]\n3. \nThe Attorney General's identification of a specific law— and the conditioning of the grant on \ncompliance with it—falls far astray from the language, context and structure of the statute \nitself. And a reading of the statutory language in a manner promoted by the Attorney \nGeneral would raise potential constitutional and statutory concerns. First, as we have \nalready discussed, the statute cited as providing the authority for the imposition of the \ncondition grants no such power to the Attorney General. Moreover, the vesting of such \ndiscretionary authority in the hands of the Attorney General would render irrelevant or \nillogical the statute's exacting delineation of the formula for grant awards and the precise \nlimits on the extent to which the Attorney General can deviate from that distribution, as we \ndiscussed in Chicago I, 888 F.3d at 286: \nThe ability of the Attorney General to depart from the distribution mandated by the formula \nis strictly circumscribed. For instance, of the total amount available in a given fiscal year, the \nAttorney General is authorized to reserve \"not more than 5 percent, to be granted to 1 or \nmore States or units of local government\" for one or more of the allowed statutory purposes, \n\"pursuant to his determination that the same is necessary (1) to combat, address, or \notherwise respond to precipitous or extraordinary increases in crime, or in a type or types of \ncrime; or (2) to prevent, compensate for, or mitigate significant programmatic harm resulting \nfrom operation of the formula ....\" 34 U.S.C. § 10157(b). Moreover, the Attorney General is \nauthorized by other statutes to reduce the funding in certain circumstances, but even then \nthe amount of the reduction is set by statute. For example, the Sex Offender Registration \nand Notification Act mandates a 10 percent reduction in JAG funding if a state fails to \nsubstantially implement its provisions. 34 U.S.C. § 20927(a). And the Prison Rape \nElimination Act of 2003 stipulates that a state that does not certify full compliance with its \nnational standards can forfeit 5 percent of JAG funds unless it certifies that no less than 5 \npercent of such funds will be used solely to achieve compliance. 34 U.S.C. § \n30307(e)(2)(A). \n\nIn contrast to those carefully delineated reductions for specific circumstances, the Attorney \nGeneral's interpretation would allow the Attorney General to withhold 100% of funds based \non his determination as to which federal law to target. \nIn addition to the dissonance with the statutory structure, the selective targeting of specific \nstatutes without regard to the statute's relation to the grant or its purposes could present \nconstitutional concerns. First, we note that as the Supreme Court reaffirmed in Gundy, 139 \nS. Ct. at 2129, a statutory delegation of authority \"is constitutional so long as Congress has \nset out an `intelligible principle' to guide the delegee's exercise of authority ... [o]r in a \nrelated formulation, the Court has stated that a delegation is permissible if Congress has \nmade clear to the delegee `the general policy' he must pursue and the `boundaries of [his] \nauthority.'\" Although courts rarely second-guess the degree of policy judgment left by \nCongress to those responsible for executing the law, the term \"applicable\" by itself is so \ndevoid of any definition or guidance that, if the Attorney General were relying on that \nprovision as a delegation of authority to impose the conditions, it would vest discretion \nunmoored by any legislative general policy or boundaries of authority. \nIn fact, the Supreme Court in Gundy recognized the constitutional issues presented by \nstatutory provisions vesting such broad discretion, in considering the Sex Offender Registry \nNotification Act (\"SORNA\") which provided that \"[t]he Attorney General shall have the \nauthority to specify the applicability of the requirements of this subchapter to sex offenders \nconvicted before the enactment of this chapter ... and to prescribe rules for the registration \nof any such sex offender.\" Id. at 2122. Although the Justices in the plurality decision \nin Gundy could not agree as to the outcome, a majority recognized that such a provision, if \nread as granting the Attorney General discretion to determine whether to apply SORNA to \noffenders rather than the mechanics of how to apply it, would present constitutional \nnondelegation problems. See Gundy, 139 S. Ct. at 2123, 2128 (plurality) (discussing the \nwhether/how distinction and noting that it would present a nondelegation question if, as \nGundy argued, the provision in the SORNA statute \"grants the Attorney General plenary \npower to determine SORNA's applicability to pre-Act offenders—to require them to register, \nor not, as she sees fit, and to change her policy for any reason and at any time\") and 139 S. \nCt. at 2143, 2145 (dissenting) (noting that the provision \"gave the Attorney General \nunfettered discretion to decide which requirements to impose on which pre-Act offenders\" \nand that \"[m]ost everyone, the plurality included, concedes that if SORNA allows the \nAttorney General as much authority as we have outlined, it would present `a nondelegation \nquestion.'\"). \nHere, the Attorney General's interpretation of the \"other applicable federal law\" language \nwould grant the type of unfettered discretion to determine whether a particular federal law \nwill be a precondition of the grant that seven Justices of the Grundy Court recognized \npresents a constitutional nondelegation issue. Accordingly, the language of the statute, if \nread as delegating the authority to the Attorney General to choose which federal laws would \nconstitute conditions of the grant, would raise grave constitutional concerns. \nBut the Attorney General has not relied on that language in that manner. Instead, the \nAttorney General asserts that Congress, with the \"other applicable law\" provision, itself \nimposed the condition on the grant under its Spending Clause power because Congress \nthereby incorporated all federal laws as grant conditions. Yet among the requirements for \n\nthe constitutional exercise of such spending power, is the requirement that Congress, if it \ndesires to condition the receipt of federal funds, \"`must do so unambiguously ..., enabl[ing] \nthe States to exercise their choice knowingly, cognizant of the consequences of their \nparticipation.'\" South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 207 (1987), quoting Pennhurst, 451 \nU.S. at 17. A state cannot knowingly accept the conditions of the federal funding if that state \nis unaware in advance of the conditions or unable to ascertain what is expected of it, and \ntherefore we insist that Congress must speak with a clear voice. Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17. \nAn interpretation of \"other applicable federal laws\" that is limited to laws that expressly \napply to grantees is clearly ascertainable, in contrast to the broader interpretation of the \nAttorney General which is unbounded—which would literally include thousands of federal \nstatutes and regulations. \nThe Second Circuit, in adopting the broad interpretation of the language that the Attorney \nGeneral seeks, acknowledges —even celebrates—the unbounded authority that such an \ninterpretation would provide, and makes clear that the interpretation will allow denial of the \ngrant for federal laws entirely unrelated to the purposes of the grant such as environmental \nlaws: \nIndeed, whether a grant is awarded by formula or by discretion, there is something \ndisquieting in the idea of States and localities seeking federal funds to enforce their own \nlaws while themselves hampering the enforcement of federal laws, or worse, violating those \nlaws. One has only to imagine millions of dollars in Byrne funding being sought by a locality \nthat is simultaneously engaged in persistent, serious violations of federal environmental \nlaws. The formula nature of the Byrne Program does not dictate that such an applicant must \nbe given federal money even as it continues to flout federal law. To the contrary, § \n10153(a)(5)(D) authorizes the Attorney General to condition the locality's receipt of a Byrne \ngrant on its certified willingness to comply with all federal laws applicable to that locality, \nwhich includes environmental laws. \nNew York, 951 F.3d at 107-08. \nWe do not agree with that interpretation of the language. Congress, under its spending \npower, can attach only conditions that \"bear some relationship to the purpose of the federal \nspending,\" and the universe of all federal laws as promoted by the Attorney General would \nnecessarily include many laws that fail to meet that standard—once again rendering the \nconditions ambiguous. New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 167 (1992), citing South \nDakota, 483 U.S. at 207-08 and n.3. Thus, the more narrow reading of the language is not \nonly more consistent with the structure of the statute, but it avoids potential constitutional \nquestions. \n4. \nMoreover, the narrower interpretation that we adopt to-day also avoids a conflict with 34 \nU.S.C. § 10228, which applies to the chapter that includes the Byrne JAG grant provisions. \nSection 10228 provides: \n(a) General rule \n\nNothing in this chapter or any other Act shall be construed to authorize any department, \nagency, officer, or employee of the United States to exercise any direction, supervision, or \ncontrol over any police force or any other criminal justice agency of any State or any \npolitical subdivision thereof. \nThe incorporation of § 1373 as a condition of the Byrne JAG grant directly conflicts with § \n10228. Through § 1373, the Attorney General seeks to prohibit the state or political \nsubdivision from providing certain instructions and limitations on the actions of its own \npolice force, thus exercising \"direction, supervision, or control\" over that police force. Nor \ndoes it matter that § 1373 prohibits the state from taking an action, as opposed to requiring \nan action. As the Supreme Court recognized in Murphy (in considering a claim under the \nanticommandeering doctrine of the Tenth Amendment), it does not matter whether a law \ncommands a state to take an affirmative action or prohibits a state from taking an action—\neither situation involves the exercise of control over the state. Murphy, 138 S. Ct. at 1478. \nSection 1373 declares that a state or local government may not prohibit or restrict its own \nofficials from communicating information regarding the citizenship or immigration status of \nany individual to the INS. That restriction of the state or local government would constitute \ndirection or control over the communications by the state or local police force. Because § \n10228 declares that \"[n]othing in this chapter or any other Act shall be construed to \nauthorize\" such direction or control, we should not construe § 10153 in a manner that would \nincorporate § 1373 as a condition of the grant. See Philadelphia, 916 F.3d at 291 (noting \nthat § 10228 may be a statutory limit to which laws are \"applicable\"). \nAccordingly, based on the language, structure, and purpose of the Act, the reference to \"all \nother applicable federal laws\" in § 10153 should be read as referencing any federal law that \nby its terms applies to federal grants or grantees in that capacity. Accord Providence, 2020 \nWL 1429579 at *12. Because we so hold, we need not consider the alternative argument \nthat § 1373 cannot be considered an \"applicable federal law\" even under the broader \nreading by the Attorney General because it is unconstitutional under the \nanticommandeering doctrine of the Tenth Amendment. See Pearson, 555 U.S. at \n241 (noting that we generally should avoid constitutional questions if possible). The holding \nthat § 1373 is not an \"applicable federal law\" equally dooms the argument that § 1644 \nprovides authority for the compliance condition, as the parties concede that § 1644 is \nidentical to § 1373. \nV. Relief. \nWe turn, then, to the final issue in this case, which is whether the district court erred in \nextending the injunction beyond the City of Chicago. In its Final Judgment and Order in the \nFY 2017 litigation, the district court granted declaratory and injunctive relief to Chicago. The \ndistrict court ordered that \"the Attorney General's decision to attach the Conditions to the FY \n2017 Byrne JAG grant is set aside and shall have no legal effect\" and enjoined the Attorney \nGeneral from \"denying or delaying issuance of any FY 2017 Byrne JAG award insofar as \nthat denial or delay is based on the Conditions.\" Dist. Ct. Final Judgment and Order, R. 211 \nat 3. The court further held that \"[t]his Order applies to the Attorney General's imposition of \nthe Challenged Conditions on the Byrne JAG grant program as a whole. Its effects run to \nthe benefit of all Byrne JAG applicants and recipients are not limited to the City of Chicago \nand its sub-grantees.\" Id. at 4. The court stayed the order as to all areas of the country \n\nbeyond Chicago in light of the stay our court had granted pending the since-vacated grant \nof an en banc rehearing. \nThe court declared that § 1373 violated the Tenth Amendment's anticommandeering \nprinciple and was therefore facially unconstitutional, that the Attorney General exceeded the \nauthority delegated by Congress in the Byrne JAG statute, 34 U.S.C. § 10151 et seq., and \nin 34 U.S.C. § 10102(a)(6), and that the Attorney General's decision to attach the conditions \nto the FY 2017 Byrne JAG grant violated the constitutional principle of separation of powers. \nDist. Ct. Final Judgment and Order, R.211 at 2. In the subsequent challenge to the FY 2018 \ngrant conditions, the district court held that §§ 1373 and 1644 violate the Tenth \nAmendment's anti-commandeering principles and are therefore facially unconstitutional, \nthat the Attorney General exceeded the authority delegated by Congress in the Byrne JAG \nstatute and in § 10102(a) in attaching the challenged conditions to the FY 2018 Byrne JAG \ngrant, and that the decision to attach those conditions to the grant violated the constitutional \nprinciple of separation of powers. The district court extended the permanent injunction it had \nimposed as to the FY 2017 Byrne JAG grant to include FY 2018 and all future years, \nenjoining the Attorney General from denying or delaying issuance of the Byrne JAG award \ninsofar as that denial or delay is based on the challenged conditions or materially identical \nconditions. Dist. Ct. Final Judgment and Order, Appellant Appendix, No. 19-3290, at SA50. \nThe court stayed the injunction to the extent that it applied to grantees other than the City of \nChicago. \nThe district court's decision to extend the injunctive relief to include future years reflected \nthe history of litigation and the positions taken by the Attorney General. In the litigation \nchallenging the FY 2017 injunction, the Department of Justice attorney representing the \nAttorney General [hereinafter \"DOJ attorney\"], asserted that it would be premature to enjoin \nconditions in FY 2018 or the years to follow because those conditions were \"still in \nformation and ... will be different in some respects from the 2017 conditions.\" Dist. Ct. \nTranscript of Proceedings, Doc. 213 at 5. The DOJ attorney then stated that although \ndisagreeing with the district court's analysis, \"we've certainly taken it to heart. And so we \nare looking at the conditions for next year against the backdrop of your prior \ndecision.\" Id. He argued to the district court that relief beyond the specific year was \nimproper because the issue was not yet ripe, arguing: \n[DOJ attorney]: Your Honor, two things. One, the solicitation is not — are not the actual \nconditions. This is an invitation to seek a grant. It doesn't expressly state what the \nconditions are. \nTwo, I've told you that we're looking at those conditions and that we are taking to heart your \nprior decision. And three, I think your point about, if we impose the exact same conditions \nwithout notice and force them to affirmatively file a case, there might be other remedies \navailable to the plaintiffs in that context. \n[District court]: That would mean their lawyers would get paid. \nId. at 5-6. Despite these assurances made by the DOJ attorney to Judge Leinenweber, the \nAttorney General nevertheless imposed the very same conditions again in the FY 2018 \ngrant application, and indeed also added yet another condition that was identical to the § \n1373 compliance condition as well as two more conditions that relied on the same statutory \nauthority that the district court and this court rejected. In its FY 2018 Byrne JAG application, \n\nChicago included an addendum indicating that it would not comply with those conditions. \nThe Department of Justice began announcing grant recipients in the fall of 2018, issuing \n752 Byrne JAG local awards by October 12, but still had not granted Chicago's application; \nat that time Chicago filed a complaint challenging the FY 2018 conditions. About a month \nafter Chicago filed suit, on November 20, the Department of Justice informed Chicago that it \nwas awarded the grant. The Department of Justice subsequently announced that in light of \nthe ongoing litigation, it would not enforce the notice, access, compliance, and additional \ncertification conditions against Chicago, but that it retained the right to enforce the harboring \ncondition. \nThe temporal scope of the injunctive relief in this case is proper. Injunctive relief is forward-\nlooking, and a plaintiff injured by an unconstitutional or unlawful action in one year does not \nneed to suffer injuries repeatedly in each ensuing year—and separately sue after each \ninjury—to obtain relief from the unlawful actions. See United States v. Oregon State Med. \nSoc., 343 U.S. 326, 333 (1952) (\"[t]he sole function of an action for injunction is to forestall \nfuture violations\"); see generally § 2942 Availability of Injunctive Relief—In General, 11A \nFed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. § 2942 (3d ed.) (noting that injunctive relief looks to the future and is \ndesigned to deter rather than punish, and that even if the defendant claims the conduct has \nbeen discontinued, the court will deny injunctive relief only if there is no reasonable \nexpectation of future injurious conduct). Injunctive relief is designed to prevent precisely that \nscenario. Once an injury is shown in the imposition of the grant conditions sufficient to \ndemonstrate standing, Chicago can challenge the imposition of those conditions in the \nByrne JAG grant, and that challenge is not temporally limited—at least where, as here, the \nchallenge is not in any way related to the timing of the conditions. And of course, the \nAttorney General's indication to the district court that it would alter the conditions in future \ngrants proved false. See Oregon State Med. Soc., 343 U.S. at 333 (\"It is the duty of the \ncourts to beware of efforts to defeat injunctive relief by protestations of repentance and \nreform, especially when abandonment seems timed to anticipate suit, and there is \nprobability of resumption.\"). The district court need not await yet another round of the same \nconditions and the same rejected justifications before enjoining the future conduct. \nA. Injunctive Relief Beyond City of Chicago \nThe Attorney General argues that, even if we agree with the district court on the merits, the \ncourt erred in extending injunctive relief beyond the City of Chicago. In Chicago I, 888 F.3d \n272, the panel addressed a similar issue as to the preliminary injunctive relief, with the \nmajority holding that nationwide injunctive relief was proper and with one panel member \ndissenting. Our court granted rehearing en banc to consider only the issue of the proper \nscope of the injunction, but that rehearing was vacated when the district court's grant of the \npermanent injunction superseded the preliminary injunction. We now are presented again \nwith the issue of the proper scope, although in the different context of a permanent rather \nthan a preliminary injunction. \nAt the outset, we note that a remand is necessary for the district court to consider whether \nany additional injunctive relief is appropriate as to the unlawful imposition of the compliance \ncondition. The court imposed declaratory relief as to the constitutionality of § 1373, and \ninjunctive relief as to the imposition of that condition. But because we have determined that \nthe term \"all other applicable Federal law\" encompasses only law that by its terms applies to \n\nfederal grants or grantees in that capacity, we have not reached that Tenth Amendment \nissue. A remand is required to allow the district court to determine whether any additional \ninjunctive relief is appropriate for the violation as we have framed it. For instance, the \ndeclaratory relief would no longer be necessary because § 1373 is inapplicable here, but \nother injunctive relief might be proper, such as enjoining the Attorney General from \ninterpreting the phrase \"all other applicable federal law\" to include laws that do not explicitly \napply by their terms to the grant or grantees. The Attorney General relied on that misuse of \n§ 10153 to impose the § 1373 compliance condition on Chicago. In the FY 2018 grant, the \ngovernment continues to require a certification of compliance with § 1373, but perhaps \nanticipating the foreclosure of that option, added the requirement of certification of \ncompliance with the parallel provision in § 1644. \nThat FY 2018 condition leaves no doubt that the Attorney General intends to continue to \ninterpret § 10153 as allowing the incorporation of federal laws unrelated to the grant or \ngrantees. Because the injury to Chicago in this case, in relation to the compliance \nconditions in both § 1373 and § 1644, is caused by the Attorney General's unsupportable \ninterpretation of § 10153 as allowing the incorporation of all federal law as a condition of the \ngrant, proper relief in this case could include an injunction preventing the Attorney General \nfrom incorporating federal law unrelated to grants or grantees as a condition of the grant \nunder § 10153. The proper scope of any additional relief, however, is for the district court, \nnot this court, to determine as an initial matter, and we remand for the district court to \nconsider whether to order any other relief as to the unlawful imposition of the compliance \ncondition in light of our decision. We review such decisions only for an abuse of \ndiscretion. eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C., 547 U.S. 388, 391 (2006). We may consider, \nhowever, the propriety of the injunctive relief that has already been granted as to all of the \nchallenged conditions \n1. Authority of the Court \nCourts and commentators, particularly recently, have recognized serious concerns with \nimposing injunctive relief that extends beyond the parties before the court to include third \nparties. In fact, the question as to the authority of a court to issue such nationwide, or \nuniversal, injunctions, as well as the propriety of such injunctions, has spawned a veritable \ncottage industry of scholarly articles in the past few years. See e.g. Mila Sohoni, The Lost \nHistory of the \"Universal\" Injunction, 133 HARV. L. REV. 920, 924-25 N. 16 (2020) \n[hereinafter Sohoni, Lost History], citing: Spencer E. Amdur & David Hausman, \nResponse, Nationwide Injunctions and Nationwide Harm, 131 HARV. L. REV. F. 49 (2017) \n[hereinafter Amdur & Hausman, Nationwide Injunctions]; Samuel L. Bray, Multiple \nChancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 HARV. L. REV. 417, 419 (2017) \n[hereinafter Bray, Multiple Chancellors]; Zachary D.

Wasserman, \"Nationwide\" Injunctions Are Really \"Universal\" \nInjunctions and They Are Never Appropriate, 22 LEWIS & CLARK L. REV. 335 (2018) \n[hereinafter Wasserman, Nationwide Injunctions].  Those articles are a response to the \n[7]\nperceived increase in the utilization of universal injunctions in the past few decades. It is a \nquestion for another forum whether any such increase signals an expanding judicial \noverreach or an increasing executive autocracy. \nAs to the authority to issue such injunctions, some urge that injunctions extending beyond \nthe parties before the court are a recent invention, first appearing in the 1960s, and that the \nabsence of such equitable relief before that time should cause us to question the legitimacy \nof that remedy. See e.g. Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392, 2425 & 2428 (2018) (Thomas, J. \nconcurring) (indicating that the first universal injunction emerged \"a century and a half after \nthe founding,\" in 1963, and \"appear to be inconsistent with longstanding limits on equitable \nrelief and the power of Article III courts\"); see also Bray, Multiple Chancellors at 437-38; \nWasserman, Nationwide Injunctions at 353. \nBut recent scholarship casts doubt on that constricted window of universal injunctions, \nexhaustively documenting the use of injunctions that extend beyond the plaintiff going back \nover a century, from a Supreme Court decision in 1913 to the present. See Sohoni, Lost \nHistory, 133 Harv. L. Rev. 920, 924 (2020); see also Samuel Bray, A Response to The Lost \nHistory of the \"Universal\" Injunction, 36 Yale J. on Reg.: Notice & Comment (Oct. 6, 2019) \navailable at: https://www.yalejreg.com/nc/a-response-to-the-lost-history-of-the-universal-\ninjunction-by-samuel-bray/ (last visited 4/7/2020) (discussing \"four serious problems\" with \nSohoni's analysis), and Mila Sohoni, A Reply to Bray's Response to The Lost History of the \n\"Universal\" Injunction, 36 Yale J. on Reg.: Notice & Comment (October 10, 2019) \n(http://perma.cc/P8BA-2UJ6 (last visited 4/7/2020) (refuting Bray's concerns). Sohoni \nmeticulously examines equitable remedies in the past century, documenting the equitable \nrelief that extended to non-parties throughout that history, and reaching the conclusion that \nuniversal injunctions are consistent with those traditional equitable remedies. Id. \nThat conclusion has found support as well in an amicus brief submitted to this court by a \ngroup of legal historians, professors at Stanford and Columbia Law Schools and Princeton \nUniversity, who concluded that \"[n]ot only did equity courts have the equitable power to \ngrant injunctions that look like modern nationwide injunctions (save they did not run against \nthe federal government itself),  but they in fact issued injunctions of astonishing scope.\" \n[8]\nBrief of Amici Curiae Legal Historians In Support of Plaintiff and Appellee the City of \nChicago [hereinafter \"Amicus\"], No. 18-2885, at 6. That wide scope included even \nexercising \"their equity powers at nationwide scale in the 19th and early 20th centuries, to \nenjoin the activities of hundreds of thousands of individuals, including thousands of non-\nparties.\" Amicus at 18. Bray, a leading opponent of universal injunctions, disagreed with \ntheir conclusions, but nevertheless acknowledged the gravitas of the authors of that amicus \nbrief, characterizing the authors as \"an all-star cast of legal historians and historians of the \nearly Republic\" and recognizing that \"[t]hese historians have written some of the leading \nscholarship on American equity.\" Bray, National Injunctions: Historians Enter the Lists, THE \nVOLOKH CONSPIRACY (Nov. 17, 2018, 2:21 PM), https://reason.com/2018/11/17/national-\ninjunctions-historians-enter-th/ (last visited 4-7-2020). Those historians examined the relief \nprovided in equity from the 18th century onward, such as bills of peace as well as ordinary \n\nbills for injunctions including injunctions to abate nuisances, and concluded that \"equity \ncourts had the equitable powers to issue nationwide injunctions in the early republic,\" and \n\"have long issued injunctions that protect the interests of non-parties.\" Amicus at 6, 8. In \nfact, the historians noted periods of time in which the equitable remedies were much more \ndrastic, extending as far as enjoining non-parties (which it noted would not be accepted \ntoday) and including a period of time in which injunctions were so broad they were called \n\"omnibus injunctions\" and \"Gatling-gun injunctions.\" Amicus at 16-17. They noted that those \nomnibus injunctions were repeatedly upheld by the Supreme Court, and ultimately \nCongress used its power to restrain their issuance. Amicus at 17. Although concluding that \nnationwide injunctions are historically grounded, the legal historians cautioned against an \napproach that would anchor equitable remedies too closely to the \"notoriously difficult \nsubject\" of history, noting that the continuity of some traditional equity practices should not \nforeclose adapting equitable remedies to modern circumstances. Amicus at 25; see \nalso Frost, In Defense at 1081. \n2. Consistency with Supreme Court Law \nTherefore, there is a substantial historical basis for the concept of injunctive relief that \nextends to the benefit of non-parties. The Attorney General and the dissent in this case \nnevertheless argue that universal injunctions are inconsistent with the Supreme Court's \ndecision in United States v. Mendoz a, 464 U.S. 154 (1984). The Mendoza Court held that \nthe government in that case should not be subjected to nonmutual offensive collateral \nestoppel because the \"economy interests underlying a broad application of nonmutual \ncollateral estoppel are outweighed by the constraints which peculiarly affect the \ngovernment.\" Id. at 162-63. The Court was concerned with the impact on the government if \none decision could bind the government as to that legal issue in any subsequent cases \nbrought by other litigants. The Attorney General and the dissent argue that the same danger \nis presented in a universal injunction. \nThere are, however, important distinctions between nonmutual offensive collateral estoppel \nand a universal injunction. First, as is obvious, the legal concepts at issue here are not \nidentical, so the Court's decision as to an estoppel issue is in no way dispositive of the \nquestion as to the availability of universal injunctions. The significance of Mendoza must \ncome from its reasoning, then. But the very different contexts make Mendoza of less \nrelevance to this question. As to collateral estoppel, \"once a court has decided an issue of \nfact or law necessary to its judgment, that decision is conclusive in a subsequent suit based \non a different cause of action involving a party to the prior litigation.\" Id. at 158. The \nprinciple would apply to litigation remote in time, involving different underlying causes of \nactions, and regardless of whether the litigant in the subsequent suit was similarly situated \nto the one in the past case. \nThat expansive reach presented issues uniquely problematic for the government. Whereas \nin disputes over private rights between private litigants, there was \"`no sound reason for \nburdening the courts with repetitive litigation,'\" the position of the government is not identical \nto that of the private litigant. Id. at 159-60., quoting Standefer v. United States, 447 U.S. 10, \n24 (1980). The government is more likely to be involved in cases with significant legal \nissues and is likely to be sued more often than a private party, thus increasing the potential \nfor estoppel to be invoked. Id. at 160. In addition to depriving the government of the benefit \n\nof multiple courts of appeal weighing in on the issue, the application of estoppel would force \nthe government to appeal every time it disagreed with a legal issue regardless of the \nsignificance of the case in which it was presented, or risk being bound by that holding in a \nlater case of more importance to the government. Id. at 160-61. Finally, the use of estoppel \nwould prevent subsequent Administrations from altering the government's position on a \nlegal issue, thus upsetting the ability of the Executive Branch to adapt to the changing \nphilosophies of subsequent political leaders. Id. at 161-62. In light of those concerns unique \nto the government as a litigant, the Court held that \"[t]he conduct of government litigation in \nthe courts of the United States is sufficiently different from the conduct of private civil \nlitigation in those courts so that what might otherwise be economy interests underlying a \nbroad application of collateral estoppel are outweighed by the constraints which peculiarly \naffect the government.\" Id. at 162-63. \nThe concerns expressed by the Court as to the use of estoppel against the government are \nnot equally present in the context of the universal injunction. Of course, both situations \npresent the concern with one court's decision preventing the percolation of the issue in \ndifferent courts. But unlike the collateral estoppel context, the universal injunction by its \nnature will concern an issue that is common to all parties bound by it who will be similarly-\nsituated, will involve an issue of obvious and significant impact (thus not presenting the \ngovernment with the need to appeal every adverse legal decision in even minor cases), and \nwill not interfere with the ability of future Administrations to change policies (because the \nimpact of the universal injunction will be felt in one ongoing case that would be appealed, \nnot in unlimited, unforeseeable cases in the future). Its restriction on the government's \nability to relitigate an issue will be limited to that case and will not raise the prospect of \nimpacting future unforeseeable situations remote in time. Therefore, the reasoning \nof Mendoza counsels an outcome as applied to universal injunctions. See Frost, In \nDefense at 1113. To the extent that Mendoza identifies factors relevant to both estoppel \nand universal injunctions, the weighing of the factors should occur—as it routinely does—in \nthe district court's discretionary determination as to the appropriate equitable relief. The \nsituations are not similar enough to support a blanket prohibition of universal injunctions \nunder the reasoning of Mendoza. \nAnd the decisions of numerous courts post-Mendoza, including the Supreme Court itself, \nsupport that conclusion. The historical underpinning for the argument that courts have the \npower to issue universal injunctions is complemented by the actual allowance of injunctions \nbenefitting non-parties more recently. As we noted in Chicago I, the Supreme Court \nin Trump v. Intern. Refugee Assistance Project, 137 S. Ct. 2080 (2017) (\"IRAP\"), allowed an \ninjunction to remain in place that applied to non-parties. 888 F.3d at 289. In IRAP, the Court \ndenied in part a request for a stay of a nationwide injunction in a challenge to an Executive \nOrder that suspended entry of foreign nationals from seven countries. The Court recognized \nthat \"[c]rafting a preliminary injunction is an exercise of discretion and judgment, often \ndependent as much on the equities of a given case as the substance of the legal issues it \npresents.\" IRAP, 137 S. Ct. at 2087. The Court granted the government's request to stay \nthe injunction as to foreign nationals who lacked any bona fide relationship with a person or \nentity in the United States, but refused to stay the injunction not only as to the respondents \nin the case, but also as to persons not parties to the case who were similarly situated. Id. at \n2088. If the lower court was without the power to impose an injunction that provided relief to \nnon-parties, and thus relief greater than that necessary for the parties before the court, then \n\nthe Supreme Court's decision to allow the injunction to remain in place as to those non-\nparties would be inexplicable. \nThe concurring and dissenting justices in IRAP would have stayed the injunction entirely, \nbut particularly argued that the injunctions should not have remained in place as to \"an \nunidentified, unnamed group of foreign nationals abroad\" for whom no class had been \ncertified and in a case in which neither party had asked for the scope of relief applied by the \nCourt. Id. at 2090 (Thomas, J. concurring in part, dissenting in part). They further asserted \nthat the role of courts was to provide complete relief only to the plaintiffs, and not to non-\nparties. Id. The IRAP Court's refusal to stay the injunction as to similarly-situated \nindividuals, in light of those arguments in the dissent, should put to rest any argument that \nthe courts lack the authority to provide injunctive relief that extends to non-\nparties. See Frost, In Defense at 1086. \n3. Propriety of Injunctive Relief \nTherefore, both historical and current practice lends support to a determination that the \ncourts possess the authority to impose injunctions that extend beyond the parties before the \ncourt. The propriety of such an injunction, in a given case, is another matter. \nSuch injunctions present real dangers, and will be appropriate only in rare circumstances. \nFor instance, a nationwide injunction can truncate the process of judicial review, elevating \nthe judgment of a single district court. That effect, however, is not absolute. As a practical \nmatter, the issuance of such an injunction is unlikely to dramatically foreclose all other \nreview, because the possibility of a stay while seeking review in the court of appeals—as \nhappened here—limits the immediate impact on litigation in other jurisdictions, and ensures \nreview by multiple judges in short order. See Amdur & Hausman, Nationwide Injunctions at \n53 n.27 (providing examples in which nationwide injunctions did not foreclose percolation). \nBut even if the impact is not absolute, it is nonetheless a concern and has the clear \npotential to narrow the input from different judicial panels. Moreover, the potential for forum \nshopping is a real hazard and alone should caution against such broad injunctive relief. See \ne.g. Bray, Multiple Chancellors at 457; Frost, In Defense at 1104. \nThat does not, however, mandate a conclusion that universal injunctions are never \nproper. See Frost, In Defense at 1105 (noting that \"[a]bolishing nationwide injunctions is \nboth an over- and under-inclusive response to that problem\"). In some circumstances, \nuniversal injunctions can be necessary \"to provide complete relief to plaintiffs, to protect \nsimilarly-situated nonparties, and to avoid the chaos and confusion that comes from a \npatchwork of injunctions.\" Id. at 1101. Just as the percolation through the courts is a valid \nconsideration, so too the desire to avoid a multiplicity of suits has long been a consideration \nin equity, which even the opponents of universal injunctions \nacknowledge. See Bray, Multiple Chancellors at 426; Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2427 (Thomas, \nJ, concurring). \nAn outright prohibition of such injunctions, however, would handcuff the ability of courts to \ndetermine the relief that is proper in exceptional circumstances. Any number of factors \ncould influence a court's determination as to the proper scope of an injunction, including the \nnature of the violation, the extent of the impact, the urgency of the situation, the multiplicity \n\nof litigation, and the ability of others to even access the courts. IRAP presented the type of \nsituation in which the remedy of a universal injunction can be particularly crucial. 137 S. Ct. \n2080. As we stated above, in that case, the Supreme Court denied in part a request for a \nstay of a nationwide injunction in a challenge to an Executive Order that suspended entry of \nforeign nationals from seven countries. The travel ban was imposed suddenly, impacting an \nimmense number of people immediately—including people who were already on planes to \nthe United States—and the ability of persons affected by the ban to access the courts \nindividually for redress was extremely limited. In such a circumstance, a court that in its \ndiscretion determines that the equities of the case and the substance of the legal issues \njustifies an injunction, should not be limited to imposing that relief only as to those few \npersons who could obtain attorneys or present themselves in court. \nNor is the presence of the vehicle of a class action a realistic alternative in such a case. The \ndifficulties, expense and delay inherent in pursuing a class action would render it \ninadequate for the type of situation presented in IRAP. As noted by Frost, \n[d]emonstrating these prerequisites [of numerosity, commonality and typicality and the \nadequacy of the named plaintiff to represent the class] is difficult and time consuming and \nhas been getting harder as a result of recent court decisions and federal legislation. Courts \nhave heightened the evidentiary standard for class certification, requiring hearings and \nsometimes significant amounts of evidence on the merits of the case before certifying the \nclass. In recent years, courts have started to deny class certification if they think there has \nbeen a flaw in class definition. These courts typically deny certification without first allowing \nthe plaintiffs to amend that definition in response to the court's concerns. Under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 23(f), defendants can seek interlocutory review of a court's decision \nto certify a class, adding further delay and expense to the certification process. Noting these \ndifficulties, one commentator has described the class certification process as a \"drawn-out \nprocedural bog,\" which comes with significant expense and delay for the would be class \nmember. \n(footnotes omitted) Frost, In Defense at 1096-97, quoting Samuel Issacharoff, Private \nClaims, Aggregate Rights, 2008 SUP. CT. REV. 183, 208; see also Malveaux, Class \nActions at 59 (describing the increasing hurdles to class actions and arguing that \"Bray's \nconcession that `the requirements for a class action will not always be easy to meet' \nunderstates the significant hurdles erected over the last fifty years\"). The class action \nmechanism is not an adequate substitute for a universal injunction in the proper case. \nAbsent the ability to grant injunctive relief that extends beyond the particular party, courts \nwill have little ability to check the abuse of power that presents the most serious threat to \nthe rule of law — such as that which is swift in implementation, widespread in impact, and \ntargeted toward those with the least ability to seek redress. Although circumspection is \nappropriate in ascertaining whether such relief is appropriate, an outright ban of such \ninjunctions is neither required by history nor desirable in light of the range of situations—\nsome as unpredictable and impactful as the sudden travel ban—that courts may confront. \nThat said, it is a more difficult question as to whether the nationwide injunction is proper in \nthis case. In exercising its discretion to impose the permanent injunction nationwide, the \ndistrict court identified a number of factors that strongly weighed in favor of an injunction \n\nthat included more comprehensive relief. The court first noted that compliance with the \nAttorney General's conditions would damage the relationship between local law \nenforcement and immigrant communities, and would decrease the cooperation with those \ncommunities that is critical to preventing and to solving crimes. The court held that the loss \nof trust, which once lost is not easily restored, would cause irreparable harm that could not \nbe remedied with money damages. Moreover, the court held that the balance of hardships \nfavored Chicago, noting that the Attorney General could distribute the funds without \nimposing the conditions, and nothing in the injunction would prevent any state or local \ngovernment from coordinating its local law enforcement with the federal authorities absent \nthose unlawful conditions. Finally, the court recognized that the public interest was served \nby an injunction in that it acts as a check on the executive's encroachment of congressional \npower that violates the separation of powers. \nThe Attorney General does not address those factors and does not question the court's \ndetermination that injunctive relief is proper. Instead, the Attorney General focuses his \nchallenge on the scope of the injunction, asserting injunctive relief must be limited to that \nnecessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiff and cannot extend to non-parties. But as \nwe have already discussed, courts have the authority to extend injunctive relief to non-\nparties, and therefore those arguments fail. \nThe district court identified a number of considerations that supported extending injunctive \nrelief in this case program-wide and to include future years. Among those considerations \nwas the Attorney General's repeated imposition of the conditions despite adverse court \nrulings. Upon our decision affirming the grant of the preliminary injunction in this case, the \nAttorney General took the highly unusual step of seeking en banc review only as to the \nscope of the injunction, declining to present for en banc consideration our holding that the \nAttorney General's claim to lawful authority was unfounded. And despite his failure to seek \nrehearing as to the preliminary injunctive relief to Chicago itself, the Attorney General \ncontinued to refuse to release the grant funds to Chicago, choosing instead to withhold the \ngrant of all funds to all recipients. See U.S. Department of Justice FY 2020 Performance \nBudget Office of Justice Programs March 2019, \nhttps://www.justice.gov/file/1144566/download, at 99-100 (last visited 4-8-20) (noting that of \nthe $403 million available for Byrne JAG grants in FY 2017, only $254.4 million had been \nawarded and similarly only $256 million of the $415.5 million available had been awarded in \nFY 2018, and explaining in a footnote that some FY 2017 and FY 2018 formula grants had \nnot been released to grantees as a result of \"concerns regarding compliance with federal \nimmigration laws and ongoing litigation related to those matters.\") Because of that conduct, \nthe district court explicitly enjoined the Attorney General from denying or delaying the \nissuance of the grant funds in the permanent injunction. \nMoreover, as described earlier, the Attorney General assured the district court that the \npermanent injunction need not cover future years, because the conditions imposed in future \nyears would reflect a careful consideration of the court's holdings as to their legality. The \ncourt accepted that assurance, and yet the Attorney General proceeded to impose \nthe identical conditions on the grants for the next year, issuing an award to Chicago that \nwas not dependent on satisfaction of the unlawful conditions only after Chicago filed suit yet \nagain. See City & Cty. of San Francisco, 372 F. Supp. 3d at 940-41 (\"There is no dispute \nthat certain challenged conditions in the fiscal year 2018 Byrne JAG Program are \n\nfunctionally the same as the notice, access, and Section 1373 certification conditions in the \nfiscal year 2017 Byrne JAG program at issue in the previous related litigation.\"). Despite \nchoosing to forgo en banc review as to the unlawfulness of the grant conditions, and with no \nchange in the legal basis for those conditions, the Attorney General persists in his \ndetermination to impose conditions on the Byrne JAG grant that we held unlawful and that \nCongress itself has failed to impose. Those actions make manifest that each and every \nstate and local government will have to bring its own suit in order to obtain relief (and \npossibly for each new grant year, given the Attorney General's penchant for adding new \nstatutory authorizations — even ones identical in language to rejected ones), leaving behind \nthose who cannot afford such litigation. The concern with multiplicity of litigation is a valid \nfactor in assessing the appropriate scope of injunctive relief. \nAs the district court held, the nature of the violation also supports the scope of the injunction \nhere, in that it involves a violation of the separation of powers doctrine. The nature of the \ninjury is a valid consideration in determining the proper scope of injunctive relief. Whether \ndeemed a statutory or a constitutional violation, the executive's usurpation of the \nlegislature's power of the purse implicates an interest that is fundamental to our government \nand essential to the protection against tyranny. See Dalton v. Spector, 511 U.S. 462, 472 \n(1994) (distinguishing ultra vires claims, alleging an action that exceeded the authority, from \nconstitutional claims, alleging an absence of any authority). \nAt its core, this case implicates principles of federalism— involving federal intrusion into \nspheres of power possessed by states—and, more directly, principles of the separation of \npowers between the executive, the legislative, and the judicial branches. \nWhy did the framers insist on this particular arrangement? They believed the new federal \ngovernment's most dangerous power was the power to enact laws restricting the people's \nliberty..... Some occasionally complain about Article I's detailed and arduous processes for \nnew legislation, but to the framers these were bulwarks of liberty. \n... \nIf Congress could pass off its legislative power to the executive branch, the \"[v]esting \n[c]lauses, and indeed the entire structure of the Constitution,\" would \"make no sense.\" \nWithout the involvement of representatives from across the country or the demands of \nbicameralism and presentment, legislation would risk becoming nothing more than the will \nof the current President. And if laws could be simply declared by a single person, they \nwould not be few in number, the product of widespread social consensus, likely to protect \nminority interests, or apt to provide stability and fair notice. Accountability would suffer too. \n... \n[E]nforcing the separation of powers isn't about protecting institutional prerogatives or \ngovernmental turf. It's about respecting the people's sovereign choice to vest the legislative \npower in Congress alone. And it's about safeguarding a structure designed to protect their \nliberties, minority rights, fair notice, and the rule of law. So when a case or controversy \ncomes within the judicial competence, the Constitution does not permit judges to look the \nother way; we must call foul when the constitutional lines are crossed. Indeed, the framers \nafforded us independence from the political branches in large part to encourage exactly this \nkind of \"fortitude... to do [our] duty as faithful guardians of the Constitution.\" \n\nGundy, 139 S. Ct. at 2134-35 (Gorsuch, J., joined by the Chief Justice and Thomas, J., \ndissenting). In our case, the executive branch has usurped the power of the legislature to \ndetermine spending and to set conditions on that spending. It has done so to conscript the \npolice power of the states to serve the civil immigration goals of the federal government. \nThe challenged actions strike at the heart of the vital principles of separation of powers and \nfederalism and comity for state's rights. \nThat is particularly true in this case where the revolving door of statutory provisions relied \nupon by the Attorney General as authorization for the withholding of funds upends the \nprocess. Like a whack-a-mole game at a carnival, the Attorney General has presented the \ncourts with one statutory \"authorization\" after another for the decision to withhold all Byrne \nJAG funding from sanctuary cities—from § 10102(a)(6) initially to §§ 10153(A)(4), \n10153(A)(5)(C), and 10155 before the First and Second Circuits for the notice and access \nconditions; from § 1373 to § 1644 for the federal law supporting the compliance condition; \nand from § 10102(a)(6) to § 10153(A)(5)(D) as the catch-all for the conditions. See e.g. City \nof Providence, 2020 WL 1429579 at *6-9. By relying on a moving target of statutory \nprovisions, the Attorney General undermines his own argument that the conditions were a \nresponse to a legislative grant of authority rather than an executive policy in search of a \nlegislative \"hook.\" The nature of the violation in this case strongly weighs in favor of more \ncomprehensive relief, both because respect for the separation of powers is fundamental to \nour government, and because the willingness to add new \"statutory authorizations\" every \ntime a court strikes one down—and to reimpose conditions on jurisdictions in ensuing years \nthat have already been rejected—portends a multiplicity of litigation that would be a drain on \nthe resources of the courts. At this point in time, five circuits have weighed in on the issues, \ndiluting the benefit of any additional \"percolation\" through the courts. Those factors provide \nstrong support for the district court's determination that program-wide relief extending to \nnon-parties is proper. \nB. Injunction as Providing Complete Relief to Plaintiff \nBut we should avoid deciding that more expansive issue if a more narrow approach is \navailable, and it is available here. It is widely accepted—even by self-professed opponents \nof universal injunctions—that a court may impose the equitable relief necessary to render \ncomplete relief to the plaintiff, even if that relief extends incidentally to non-\nparties. See Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702 (1979); Wasserman, Nationwide \nInjunctions at 360-61; see, e.g., McKenzie v. City of Chicago, 118 F.3d 552, 555 (7th Cir. \n1997) (noting that \"in reapportionment and school desegregation cases, for example, it is \nnot possible to award effective relief to the plaintiffs without altering the rights of third \nparties\"); Gill v. Whitford, 138 S. Ct. 1916, 1930 (2018) (recognizing, for instance, in two \nmalapportionment cases, that \"the only way to vindicate an individual plaintiff's right to an \nequally weighted vote was through a wholesale `restructuring of the geographical \ndistribution of seats in a state legislature'\"). \nThe Byrne JAG grant is a formula grant, not a discretionary grant. The determination of the \nfunds that will be provided to a grantee is based upon a very structured, precise calculation \nthat is set forth by Congress at 34 U.S.C. § 10156 (formerly 42 U.S.C. § 3755), and the \namount received by a specific state or locality is dependent on the calculations related to \nthe other states and localities. Therefore, to provide complete and accurate relief to Chicago \n\nnow and in the future, and ensure that it receives the allocation that it would receive if the \nAttorney General did not apply the unlawful conditions, the allocations as a whole must be \nlawfully determined. In this formula grant, the relief from the unlawfully-imposed conditions \nmust be applied program-wide in order for the grant amounts to be properly calculated for \nthe plaintiff itself. \nBefore delving into the minutia as to the structure of the Byrne JAG awards and the \ninterrelationship of the grants, it might be helpful to provide a brief overview. If every \ngrantee was allocated a set grant amount, independent from each other, then relief for \nChicago could be calculated and awarded in a vacuum. There would be no need to enjoin \nthe conditions beyond Chicago to redress the monetary injury, because the imposition of \nthe conditions beyond Chicago would not impact Chicago's grant award. But that is not the \ncase. The slice of the Byrne JAG pie that Chicago receives is related to the slices received \nby Illinois and other states, and if the imposition of the unlawful conditions eliminates Illinois \nor other states from receiving their own awards, then that can impact Chicago's award as \nwell. The grant awards are statutorily interrelated. \nThe Byrne JAG program allocates grant amounts to some localities directly, and also \nallocates grant amounts to each state, which then must pass on a certain percentage to \nother localities. If a state is unable to qualify to receive funds under the program, that state's \naward is redistributed to the localities. In that way, the amount a locality can receive is \nconnected to the amount the state is awarded and to the ability of the state to participate in \nthe program. And the amount that the state is awarded is itself impacted by the amounts \nawarded to other states. In a number of ways, Byrne JAG funds can be redistributed from \nsome states to other states, thus decreasing some states' awards and increasing the award \nfor the other states. \nThe Byrne JAG conditions challenged here disrupt the entire distribution plan, because they \ncan prevent the states from even applying for an award—and clearly prevent the states \nfrom receiving a Byrne JAG award—if they cannot comply with the unlawful conditions at \nissue in this case. Because the awards to states are interrelated, and the award for \nlocalities is also related to the award to states, the imposition of the unlawful conditions \nimpacts the proper calculation of all awards, including awards to localities such as Chicago. \nAs we will see, the Attorney General does not really contest that Chicago's award could be \nimpacted by the imposition of conditions on states. Instead, the Attorney General argues \nthat we need not be concerned with that because the imposition of the unlawful conditions \non other grant applicants would be a windfall to Chicago, resulting in a higher grant amount \nthan it would otherwise receive, and Chicago cannot complain of receiving a higher amount. \nAs we will discuss, the impact on Chicago if the unlawful conditions are applied to the states \nwould not necessarily be an increase in its grant amount; it could operate to decrease the \ngrant to Chicago as well. Moreover, even an improper increase in its award would be \nproblematic. Once we have concluded that the Attorney General is without the authority to \nimpose the challenged conditions, the court's role should be to ensure that Chicago \nreceives the grant it would have been entitled to absent the unlawful conditions. Courts \nshould not impose relief that makes Chicago an involuntary beneficiary of the very conduct \nthat it seeks to enjoin. That can only be assured if the Byrne JAG awards as a whole are \n\ncalculated absent the imposition of the conditions, and therefore program-wide injunctive \nrelief was appropriate. \n1. Statutory Formula for Allocation \nThat is the overview. We turn, now, to the details. As an initial matter, it is important to \nunderstand the statutory formula for calculating grants, with its awards to states and \nlocalities. In this subpart, we describe the statutory formula for the initial allocations of funds \nas to states and localities. That is the base, from which subsequent redistributions will \noccur, which we discuss in subsections 2 and 3. The dissent argues that we misunderstand \n§ 10156(d) and (e) as making Chicago's award contingent on any governing body's \ncompliance with the unlawful conditions. We do not argue that § 10156(d)-(e) has any such \neffect. Those provisions set forth the formula for the allocation of funds at the outset, which \nis determined proportionally and therefore will inform redistributions of funds as well. \nSubsections 2 and 3 demonstrate the redistributions of funds that are provided in the \nstatute, and explain how the imposition of the unlawful conditions on states can alter that \nredistribution and thereby impact Chicago's Byrne JAG grant award. \nConsideration of the precise formula delineated by Congress in § 10156 makes clear the \nneed for program-wide relief. Under that statute, the Attorney General first determines the \ninitial allocations to states and U.S. territories (hereinafter collectively referred to as \n\"states\"), allocating half of the available funds based on the ratio of a state's population to \nthe national population, and half allocated based on the ratio of a state's share of violent \ncrime to that of the nation. 34 U.S.C. § 10156(a)(1). If that number falls below the minimum \nallocation provided in § 10156(a)(2), reflecting 0.25% of the total Byrne JAG allocation, the \nstate is awarded that minimum allocation. The population and crime data from those states \nreceiving the minimum allocation is excluded in calculating the ratios in § 10156(a)(1). With \nthe exception of the U.S. territories and the District of Columbia, 60% of the total allocation \nto a state is retained by the state, with 40% set aside for local governments. § 10156(b). \nThe amounts allocated to local governments are calculated based on their share of all \nviolent crimes reported in the state. §10156(d). If the local government is entitled to an \naward greater than or equal to $10,000, then that unit of local government is eligible to \nreceive the award directly. § 10156(c)-(e). If the amount allocated to a unit of local \ngovernment is less than $10,000, that amount is returned to the state governments for \nredistribution to state law enforcement agencies and local governments. Id. Moreover, units \nof local government may not receive a Byrne JAG award that exceeds that local \ngovernment's total expenditures on criminal justice services for the most recently completed \nfiscal year, and therefore award amounts in excess of that total expenditure are \nreallocated proportionally among other units of local government. § 10156(e)(1). \nThe formula for grant distribution also recognizes that, in some circumstances, a disparity \ncan exist between the funding eligibility of a county and its associated municipalities. The \nthree types of disparity include: a zero-county disparity, when one or more municipalities \nwithin a county are eligible for a direct award but the county is not, yet the county is \nresponsible for providing criminal justice services for the municipality and therefore should \nbe entitled to part of the municipality's award; a disparity in which both a county and a \nmunicipality within it qualify for a direct award, but the award amount for the municipality \nexceeds 150% of the county's award amount; and a disparity in which a county and multiple \n\nmunicipalities within that county are all eligible for direct awards, but the sum of those \nawards exceeds 400% of the county's award amount. § 10156(d)(4); see also BJA \nTechnical Report, Justice Assistance Grant Program, 2016, \nhttps://www.bja.gov/JAG/pdfs/JAG-Technical-Report.pdf at 2-6 (\"BJA Technical report\") \n(last visited 4-8-2020); BJA Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program \nFrequently Asked Questions \nhttps://bja.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh186/files/media/document/JAGFAQ.pdf at 23-24 (last \nvisited 4-8-2020). Jurisdictions subject to such disparity must identify a fiscal agent to \nsubmit a joint application for the aggregate of funds to which the units of local government \nare eligible, and that joint application must specify the amount of funds to be distributed to \neach of the units of local government and the purposes for which the funds will be used. Id. \nAccordingly, the statutory formula for distribution of Byrne JAG funding includes both direct \nand indirect distributions to states and units of local government, and in some \ncircumstances requires a unit of local government to submit a joint application on behalf of \nitself and specified geographically constituent units of local government. Chicago falls within \nthose provisions, and therefore it files its application for Byrne JAG funding on behalf of \nitself but also on behalf of eleven other neighboring units of local government. Chicago \nI, 888 F.3d at 292. For instance, the City of Evanston, which is currently pursuing its own \nchallenge to the Byrne JAG conditions along with the United States Conference of Mayors, \nreceives its funds indirectly through an application submitted by the City of Chicago. \nThe statute therefore employs a precise formula for determining the amounts to be awarded \nto applicants, including states and units of local governments. Because the amounts \nallocated are based on percentages, the actual amount that a unit of local government such \nas Chicago will receive is dependent on the number of applicants and the local \ngovernment's share of all violent crimes reported in the state relative to those other \napplicants. Nor is the award a static one that, once awarded, is automatically and \npermanently distributed to the applicants. The awards themselves are for a four-year period \nof time. During that time, the award requires of each applicant ongoing compliance with the \nterms of the award, which according to the Attorney General, includes the requirement of \ncompliance with § 1373. An inability to comply with § 1373 during that time can result in the \nloss of the award. As we will explain, when a state is forced to relinquish its award or cannot \nqualify for an award in the first place for any reason including the unlawful conditions, that \nsituation can impact the award amount provided both to localities and to other states. \nEssentially, application of the unlawful conditions to the Byrne JAG program can impact \nChicago's grant in any of three different ways: (1) if applied to Chicago, it will eliminate its \ngrant entirely; (2) if applied to Illinois, it could disqualify Illinois from receiving a grant and \nincrease Chicago's grant award as described in subsection 2; (3) if applied to other states, it \ncan impact Illinois' award either by increasing or decreasing the award that Illinois otherwise \nwould get as described in subsection 3. And again, that altered amount can impact \nChicago's award as described in subsection 2—even if the unlawful conditions were not \napplied to Illinois. \n2. Redistribution from State to Locality \n\nFirst, a state's inability to participate in the Byrne JAG program for any reason, including the \ninability to comply with the unlawful conditions, can result in an increase in the grant \nreceived by the locality. In that way, the grant for the locality is interconnected with the grant \nto the state. \nSection 10156(f) explicitly provides for additional funding to units of local government, \nwhere a state is unable or unwilling to comply with the program's requirements during that \ntime, as follows: \n(f) Funds not used by the State \nIf the Attorney General determines, on the basis of information available during any grant \nperiod, that any allocation (or portion thereof) under this section to a State for such grant \nperiod will not be required, or that a State will be unable to qualify or receive funds under \nthis part, or that a State chooses not to participate in the program established under this \npart, then such State's allocation (or portion thereof) shall be awarded by the Attorney \nGeneral to units of local government, or combinations thereof, within such State, giving \npriority to those jurisdictions with the highest annual number of part 1 violent crimes of the \nUniform Crime Reports reported by the unit of local government to the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation for the three most recent calendar years for which such data are available. \n(emphasis added). Thus, even after the initial award, during that four-year period of the \ngrant the Attorney General could determine that a State no longer qualifies to receive funds, \nand those funds will be redistributed to the units of local government, as long as that \nallocation does not exceed the local government unit's total expenditure on criminal justice \nservices for the most recently completed fiscal year for which such data is available. § \n10156(e)(1). That can result in a redistribution of funds from Illinois to its localities for any of \na number of reasons; one of those possible reasons is if the unlawful conditions were \napplied to Illinois and it was unable to comply with those conditions. \nThe possibility of that provision impacting Chicago's grant amount is far from negligible. The \nState of Illinois, for instance, recently passed the Keep Illinois Families Together Act, 5 \nILCS § 835/1, which forbids local law enforcement agencies or officials from participating in \nthe federal 287(g) program, an ICE program that allows local law enforcement officials to \nidentify and remove undocumented residents from the United States. Id. at § 835/5. If the \nAttorney General were to determine that the law operated to restrict a local government \nofficial's ability to send or receive information regarding immigration status in violation of § \n1373, or if Illinois were to extend its protections of its families to prevent all communications \nregarding immigration status, then under § 10156(f) the funds awarded to the State of \nIllinois could be redistributed to units of local government. \nRegardless of whether the State of Illinois is in compliance with the unlawful conditions, the \npoint here is that the award to a unit of local government such as the City of Chicago can be \nimpacted by the award and compliance status of the state and the other units of local \ngovernment, not just in the grant year but in the three years following it. That would require, \nat a minimum, that injunctive relief extend to the state level. But an injunction prohibiting the \napplication of the unlawful conditions to Illinois would not itself ensure that Chicago receives \nthe proper grant amount because, under § 10156(f), any number of scenarios can result in \nthe redistribution of Illinois' grant award to its localities. And the grant that Illinois receives, \n\nwhich can then be redistributed to its localities, is itself impacted by the enforcement of the \nunlawful conditions as to the other states. That is because the structure of the Byrne JAG \nprogram renders the grants at the state level interrelated as well. See City and County of \nSan Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1244 (9th Cir. 2018); Wasserman, Nationwide \nInjunctions at 387-88 (acknowledging that the Ninth Circuit properly allowed the injunction to \nrun to non-party California because the state grant could impact San Francisco's grant). \n3. Redistribution from State to State \nByrne JAG grant awards to each state are not determined in isolation from each other. First, \nthe awards are based on the statistics of each state relative to that of the others. If states \nare no longer eligible for the grant program based on the unlawful conditions, the allocations \ncould be calculated excluding those states, resulting in a higher amount for the remaining \nstates. That is a hypothetical possibility, not a certainty, because it is possible that the initial \nallocations would still be calculated as to all states — even those rendered ineligible for \nfunds — and the states would be excluded only at the award stage. If that was the only \nredistribution, we would remand to the district court for further fact-finding to determine \nwhether the initial grant allocations will be impacted by the ineligibility of states due to the \nunlawful conditions. But we need not remand here because the state Byrne JAG awards are \ninterrelated in other ways that do not require factual development. \nWhat is clear, even without factfinding, is that other statutorily-mandated redistributions of \nByrne JAG funds among states will be upended by the imposition of the unlawful Byrne JAG \nconditions. Just as recipients of Byrne JAG grants have to certify compliance with anti-\nlobbying statutes and other grant-related requirements in order to be eligible for their grant \naward, grantees also can have their grant award reduced or increased based on their \ncompliance with the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), 34 U.S.C. § \n20927(a), and the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA), 34 U.S.C. § 30307(e)(2)(A). In \ncontrast to the award conditions imposed in this case by executive fiat, the conditions of \ncompliance with SORNA and PREA are legislatively-authorized, in explicit statutory \nlanguage. See 34 U.S.C. § 20927(a),(c), and § 30307(e)(2)(A), (E). \nAs described above, in the Byrne JAG program, initial allocations of Byrne JAG funds are \nmade to states and, after the states submit their applications with the required certifications, \nawards of the grant are issued. If a state seeking a Byrne JAG grant is non-compliant with \nthe requirements of SORNA, then its Byrne JAG grant award is reduced by 10 percent. \nThose funds are then reallocated as an addition to the Byrne JAG grant award to other, \nSORNA-compliant states in the following fiscal year unless the non-compliant state seeks \nreallocation of those funds to its own Byrne JAG grant award by certifying that the funds will \nbe used solely to obtain SORNA compliance and that request is approved. 34 U.S.C. § \n20927(c). The amounts at stake in that redistribution can be significant. For FY 2016, the \n10% penalty applied to SORNA-non-compliant states reduced Byrne JAG grants by more \nthan $6 million, with approximately $5 million reallocated to the SORNA-non-compliant \nstates that applied for the funds to promote SORNA implementation, and over a million \ndollars reallocated as a bonus award to SORNA-compliant states. See Justice Assistance \nGrant Program, 2016 Technical Report at 7, at \nhttps://bja.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh186/files/media/document/jag-technical-report.pdf (last \nvisited 4-8-2020). \n\nAccordingly, a state's Byrne JAG award can be increased or decreased based on that \nstate's own compliance with SORNA and based on whether other states are non-compliant. \nBecause the penalty is assessed when the Byrne JAG grant is awarded, it will not be \nassessed as to states that either cannot even apply for the award because they cannot \ncertify that they are in compliance with the unlawful conditions, or that apply and are denied \nan award because they are not in compliance with those conditions. See Office of Justice \nPrograms SMART, Byrne JAG Grant Reductions Under SORNA at \nhttps://smart.gov/byrneJAG_grant_reductions.htm (last visited 4-8-2020)(noting that the 10 \npercent reduction is imposed when the awards are made). \nThat is a real problem if the unlawful Byrne JAG conditions challenged in this case are \nimposed upon the states. States that cannot or will not comply with those unlawful \nconditions will not be able to receive any award under the Byrne JAG grant. In fact, even \nfiling an application for the Byrne JAG grant is problematic for such states. The application \nrequirements and penalties leave potential applicants in \"sanctuary\" or \"welcoming\" \njurisdictions with few options. The chief executive of each state or unit of local government \nmust certify that the unit of government will comply with all Byrne JAG provisions and all \napplicable federal laws, and must include the certification of compliance with § 1373. The \nsolicitation for Byrne JAG applications makes clear that the certification is subject to review \nby DOJ, and that a false statement or concealment or omission of a material fact may result \nin criminal prosecution, and also may trigger civil penalties and administrative remedies \nincluding suspension or termination of the award, placement on the DOJ high risk grantee \nlist (with attendant consequences), disallowance of costs, and suspension or debarment of \nthe recipient. See Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program FY 2017 \nLocal Solicitation CFDA # 16.738 at 8-9, Appellant's Appendix, No. 18-2885, at A153-54. In \nthe amicus briefs in this case alone, fourteen states have challenged the conditions, which \nindicates that the number of states that could be impacted by the imposition is significant. \nThat likelihood is apparent as well in the Department of Justice's Byrne JAG Application and \nAward History, which as of March 2019 indicated that approximately $150 million of the \n$400 million in Byrne JAG funds each year for FY 2017 and FY 2018 still had not been \nreleased to grantees \"as a result [of] concerns regarding compliance with federal \nimmigration laws and ongoing litigation related to these matters.\" U.S. Dept. of Justice, FY \n2020 Performance Budget, OJP March 2019, \nhttps://www.justice.gov/file/1144566/download at 100 (last visited 4-8-2020). \nIf states cannot apply for or receive Byrne JAG awards, then that impacts the SORNA \npenalties collected from and redistributed to the remaining states in the Byrne JAG grants. \nFor instance, if SORNA-non-compliant states can no longer qualify for Byrne JAG funds \nbecause of the unlawful conditions challenged here, then the 10 percent SORNA penalty \nwill not be assessed as to them because they will have no award. Therefore the penalty \namounts will not be redistributed to the Byrne JAG grant the following year to SORNA-\ncompliant states, thus lowering the Byrne JAG grant awards that the remaining states would \nhave received. Those SORNA-compliant states will not receive the additional funds that \nwould have been reallocated from the award of those non-compliant states. Similarly, if \nSORNA-compliant states are unable to participate in the Byrne JAG program because they \ncannot comply with the unlawful conditions, then the remaining SORNA-compliant states \nwill receive a larger share of the SORNA penalty funds solely because the unlawful \nconditions forced the exclusion of those states and impacted the number of SORNA-\n\ncompliant states left in the redistribution mix. The inability of SORNA-non-compliant states \nto seek reallocation of the penalty to their own Byrne JAG award, in years for which the \nunlawful conditions deprive them of any award, will also skew the calculations. \nWhether states experience a loss or a windfall, the result is that the imposition of the \nunlawful Byrne JAG conditions, by precluding states from eligibility for Byrne JAG awards, \nwill alter the Byrne JAG grant amounts for other states, and therefore can alter amounts for \nlocalities as well. In other words, if the unlawful conditions are imposed upon the states so \nas to render some of them ineligible for the Byrne JAG award, the Byrne JAG award for \nother states will be impacted because the Byrne JAG award for each state is impacted by \nthe amounts redistributed from other states. \nA similar redistribution of funds between states occurs based on compliance with the PREA. \nThe PREA stipulates that a state that does not certify full compliance with its national \nstandards can forfeit 5 percent of Byrne JAG funds unless it certifies that no less than 5 \npercent of such funds will be used solely to achieve compliance. See 34 U.S.C. § \n30307(e)(2)(A). In FY 2019, as a result of the PREA compliance requirement, nearly $3 \nmillion in Byrne JAG grant funds were reallocated, held in abeyance, or \nreduced. See Impact of PREA on Justice Grants, FY 2019 at https://bja.ojp.gov/ \nsites/g/files/xyckuh186/files/media/document/FY2019-PREA-Grant-Impact.pdf (last visited \n4-8-2020). If states are unable to comply with certain PREA requirements, the PREA \nprovides that \"the Attorney General shall redistribute the funds of the State held in \nabeyance to other States to be used in accordance with the conditions of the grant program \nfor which the funds were provided.\" 34 U.S.C. § 30307(e)(2)(E)(iii). \nStates that are ineligible for Byrne JAG funds because they cannot comply with the \nchallenged conditions will not be awarded Byrne JAG funds, and therefore the redistribution \nof Byrne JAG funds that would occur for non-compliance with the PREA will be disrupted. \nOnce again, the impact of the challenged conditions will impact not only the individual \nstate's Byrne JAG grant amount, but will impact the grant amount of other states as well. \nJust as the Byrne JAG grants for localities are impacted by the grants for states and each \nstate's ability to comply with the challenged Byrne JAG conditions, so too the grants for \nstates are impacted by the ability of each other state to comply with those Byrne JAG \nconditions. \n4. Complete Relief to Plaintiff \nThe only way to ensure that the plaintiff receives, now and in the future, the Byrne JAG \ngrant amount that it would be entitled to in the absence of the unlawful conditions, is to \ncalculate the amounts for grant recipients as a whole absent the unlawful conditions. Like a \nriver that flows throughout an entire region, in which an impact on one part cannot be \nseparated from the whole and relief for injury to the part must target the whole, relief for one \ngrantee in the Byrne JAG program must target the whole program. Complete relief to \nChicago requires that the unlawful grant conditions are not applied to the program at all. In \nthat context, a program-wide injunction is appropriate. \nThe dissent asserts that SORNA and PREA are irrelevant to a claim involving the Byrne \nJAG grant. But the focus here is not on the source of the redistribution of Byrne JAG funds; \n\nrather, the relevant question is whether that required redistribution renders Byrne JAG \nfunding intertwined, such that the elimination of some states from the Byrne JAG program \nas a result of the unlawful conditions can impact the funds received by other states and \nlocalities in that program. The relevant question is whether the formula for calculating the \nByrne JAG award renders one state's and one locality's award dependent on the award for \nother states, and whether the imposition of the unlawful conditions challenged in this lawsuit \ndisrupts that calculation. If the imposition of the unlawful Byrne JAG conditions on the states \nas a whole could alter the award that a state (and therefore a locality) would receive, then a \nprogram-wide injunction is necessary in order for Chicago to receive the award that it would \nbe entitled to in the absence of the unlawful conditions. Chicago's award is impacted not \nonly if the unlawful conditions are applied to its own Byrne JAG application, but if they are \napplied to deny Byrne JAG awards to Illinois or to other states. Accordingly, the relief that \nwould eliminate the impact of those unlawful conditions on Chicago's Byrne JAG grant is an \ninjunction preventing the consideration of those unlawful conditions in the awarding of the \nByrne JAG grant program-wide. A program-wide injunction is necessary to provide \ncomplete relief to the plaintiff, and therefore is proper. \nNotably, the Attorney General has never tried to establish that the grant awards are not \ninterdependent. In his brief, the Attorney General addressed \"the panel majority's belief that \n`the structure of the Byrne JAG program itself' supports entry of nationwide injunction.\" \nAppellant's Brief, No. 18-2885, at 54. But rather than challenge the assumption that the \nByrne JAG funds would be redistributed from jurisdictions that lost funding, the Attorney \nGeneral declared that the panel majority \"failed to explain how that redistribution required a \nnationwide injunction to protect Chicago's interests,\" because such redistribution would \nbenefit Chicago by increasing its grant. Id. at 54-55. At oral argument, the Attorney General \nagain declared only that it is \"unclear\" whether funds from another applicant could increase \nChicago's award if the conditions rendered that applicant unable to retain or obtain a Byrne \nJAG award, but again argued that such redistribution would be a windfall of which Chicago \ncould not complain. Under the Attorney General's theory, then, even if Chicago would \nreceive more funds if the unlawful conditions are applied to other Byrne JAG applicants, that \nwould constitute a surplus and Chicago could not complain that it failed to obtain all relief to \nwhich it is entitled. The notion that a plaintiff cannot complain if it becomes a beneficiary of \nthe unlawful actions it is challenging is an odd one. It is the equivalent of arguing that a \nvictim of an unlawful pyramid scheme can receive proper relief from the illegal conduct if \nthat victim is given a cut of the profits of that very same ongoing unlawful scheme. Chicago \nseeks a remedy that provides redress for the unlawful conduct, not one that allows it to \nprofit from the continued imposition of that unlawful conduct as to others. A remedy that \nessentially makes the City complicit in the action it seeks to prohibit is no remedy at all, and \ncertainly not one that can, by any measure, constitute a remedy grounded in equity. \nCourts have an obligation to award proper relief, and a windfall achieved by the imposition \nof unlawful conditions on other applicants is not proper relief. This is not a situation in which \nit is impossible to ensure that Chicago receives the award it would be entitled to without the \nunlawful conditions; it requires only that the unlawful conditions not be applied to the Byrne \nJAG awards at all. That relief is the proper and complete relief here, and it does not cease \nto be proper merely because other, non-plaintiffs, will thereby be relieved of the unlawful \nconditions that would otherwise be applied to their grant awards. In fact, relief that requires \nconsistency in the application of conditions to all Byrne JAG grants is truer to the statutory \n\nstructure. Particularly where, as discussed above, the other equitable factors also weigh in \nfavor of broad relief, there is no reason in equity to deny the remedy that will provide \ncomplete relief to Chicago. \nMoreover, as discussed above, the impact of the unlawful conditions on the other states \nwould not necessarily result in a windfall. It could also result in a lower grant award than \nwould be proper absent the impact of those unlawful conditions. If, for example, SORNA-\nnon-compliant states cannot receive a grant award, then the 10 percent penalty cannot be \nimposed on their award and redistributed to other states. That will decrease the awards to \nother SORNA-compliant states, and as set forth above, the state award can impact the local \naward. The assumption, then, that Chicago could only experience a windfall is unsupported \nas the statutory formula is structured. \nWe have determined that the Attorney General lacked the authority to impose the \nchallenged conditions. The proper relief to Chicago is to enjoin the imposition of the \nconditions to the extent necessary to ensure that Chicago receives the grant award that it \nwould be entitled to if the unlawful conditions were not imposed. In a formula grant structure \nsuch as the one presented here, in which grant amounts are based on percentages and the \naward amounts are interrelated and interdependent, a program-wide injunction is necessary \nto ensure that Chicago itself receives proper relief. Therefore, even considering only the \nrelief necessary to the plaintiff itself, the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing \na program-wide injunction. Because we so hold, we need not consider Chicago's argument \nthat program-wide relief is proper under the Administrative Procedure Act's authorization \nthat unlawful agency actions should be \"set aside.\" See D.C. v. U.S. Dep't of Agric., ___ \nF.3d ___, 2020 WL 1236657, at *34 (D.D.C. Mar. 13, 2020) and cases cited therein \n(discussing a line of cases all holding that \"the APA's instruction that unlawful agency \nactions be `set aside' is ordinarily read as an instruction to vacate, wherever applicable, \nunlawful agency rules\"); see also Sohoni, Lost History at 991 n.466. \nVI. Conclusion. \nOnce again, we address the need to preserve the separation of powers between the \nlegislative and executive branch. The separation of powers is a foundation of our \ngovernment, not a formality to be swept aside on the path to achieving goals that the \nexecutive branch deems worthy. The Attorney General's nod to checks and balances rings \nhollow in light of the changing justifications provided here for the conditions, with a new \npurported legislative \"authorization\" whenever another is deemed baseless by the court. \nRather than an exercise of authority granted to it by the legislature, the conditions imposed \nhere are an executive usurpation of the power of the purse. See Providence, 2020 WL \n1429579 at *8 (\"[i]t is nose-on-the-face plain that [C]ongress intended Byrne JAG to operate \nas a formula grant program .... Congress did not make an allowance for any deviation that \nwould justify the actions undertaken by the DOJ in this case.\") \nThe imposition of the challenged conditions in this manner is an abrogation of the legislative \nprocess. Preservation of the separation of powers is paramount if our democracy is to \nsurvive. \n\nAccordingly, we affirm the grants of declaratory relief as to the declarations that the Attorney \nGeneral exceeded the authority delegated by Congress in the Byrne JAG statute, 34 U.S.C. \n§ 10151 et seq., and in 34 U.S.C. § 10102(a), in attaching the challenged conditions to the \nFY 2017 and FY 2018 grants, and that the Attorney General's decision to attach the \nconditions to the FY 2017 and FY 2018 Byrne JAG grants violated the constitutional \nprinciple of separation of powers. In light of our determination as to the language in § \n10153, it is unnecessary to reach the constitutionality of § 1373 under the \nanticommandeering doctrine of the Tenth Amendment. We affirm the district court's grant of \ninjunctive relief as to the application of the challenged conditions to the Byrne JAG grant \nprogram-wide now and in the future, which included enjoining the Attorney General from \ndenying or delaying issuance of the Byrne JAG award to grants in FY 2017, FY 2018, FY \n2019 and any other future program year insofar as that denial or delay is based on the \nchallenged conditions or materially identical conditions. We remand for the district court to \ndetermine if any other injunctive relief is appropriate in light of our determination that § \n10153 cannot be used to incorporate laws unrelated to the grants or grantees. Finally, \nbecause the injunctive relief is necessary to provide complete relief to Chicago itself, the \nconcern with improperly extending relief beyond the particular plaintiff does not apply, and \ntherefore there is no reason to stay the application of the injunctive relief. \nMANION, Circuit Judge, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part. \nToday's opinion holds unlawful several conditions attached to the Byrne JAG program and \naffirms the imposition of a nationwide injunction with respect to those conditions. My \nconcurrence addresses all parts except the court's approval of a nationwide injunction. \nBroad, sweeping relief of such nature is rarely appropriate, and nothing indicates Chicago \nneeds a nationwide injunction to preserve its Byrne JAG award. \nI. \nThe Attorney General challenges the district court's conclusion that the notice, access, and \n§ 1373 compliance conditions required of FY 2017 and FY 2018 Byrne JAG applicants are \nunlawful. He also challenges the same finding regarding three new conditions placed on FY \n2018 grant applicants: the § 1644 compliance condition; the harboring condition; and the \nadditional certification condition. These requirements all conflict with Chicago's \"Welcoming \nCity Ordinance,\"  which, broadly speaking, forbids the city's agencies or agents from \n[1]\ncooperating with federal immigration authorities unless the individual subject to federal \ninquiry has an outstanding criminal warrant, a pending felony charge, or gang affiliations. \nChicago, Ill., Mun. Code § 2-173-042. This ordinance, in my opinion, spoils the many \ninherent values gained when local and federal law enforcement agencies collaborate, yet \nthe city claims this measure is necessary to foster cooperation between local law \nenforcement and \"undocumented\" immigrants, i.e., those here illegally, who might otherwise \nfear detention and removal (legal consequences) after coming forward as criminal \nwitnesses. The city further insists the cooperation of illegal aliens \"is essential to achieve \nthe City's goals of protecting life and property, preventing crime and resolving problems.\" § \n2-173-005. I find this logic unconvincing when, in 2018, Chicago's self-reported clearance \nrates (cases in which a suspect was arrested, charged, and prosecuted) for murder (44.42 \npercent) and aggravated assault (38.42 percent) fell substantially below the national \n\nclearance average for those crimes (62.3 and 52.5 percent, respectively).  Clearly, willing \n[2]\nwitnesses are lacking in Chicago despite its \"welcoming\" policies. \nWe already addressed the notice and access conditions in City of Chicago v. Sessions, 888 \nF.3d 272 (7th Cir. 2018) (\"Chicago I\"), where we rejected the Attorney General's reliance on \n§ 10102(a)(6) of the Byrne JAG statute and upheld the district court's grant of a preliminary \ninjunction regarding those two requirements. Here, the Attorney General relies on § \n10102(a)(6) once again, this time maintaining the provision extends to support the new \nharboring and additional certification conditions. But he raises no new meritorious \narguments regarding § 10102(a)(6) in this appeal, so I agree with the court that our earlier \nreasoning warrants the same result here. I also agree that §§ 10102(a)(2) and (a)(4) do not \nsupport the harboring condition. Those provisions only permit the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral to \"maintain liaisons\" with government agencies regarding criminal justice matters, \nnot to impose conditions on grant money. \nThat still leaves the Attorney General's § 1373 compliance condition.  Section 1373 \n[3]\nprohibits states and localities from restricting the flow and maintenance of information \nregarding the citizenship or immigration status of any individual. 8 U.S.C. § 1373. According \nto the Attorney General, conditioning Chicago's grant award on the city's compliance with \nthis law is proper under § 10153 of the Byrne JAG statute. Section 10153 requires \napplicants to certify, among other things, compliance with the program's provisions and \"all \nother applicable Federal laws.\" 34 U.S.C. § 10153(A)(5)(D). The Attorney General argues \nthis language captures § 1373, but such logic depends on a revision to the statutory \nlanguage, one that requires certified compliance with \"all Federal laws,\" not just \nthe applicable ones. \nThere are thousands of federal laws. Adopting the Attorney General's literal position would \ncondition a grant award on certifying compliance with each and every one of them. That \ncannot be the case. Under its spending power, Congress can attach only those conditions \nthat \"bear some relationship to the purpose of the federal spending\" and must do so \nunambiguously. New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 167, 172 (1992) (citations \nomitted). The Attorney General's unbounded interpretation ignores this concept. His \noversight makes a difference because the relevant statutory context limits § \n10153(A)(5)(D)'s \"all other applicable Federal laws\" language to federal grant applicants. \nReading § 10153 as a whole makes this clear. Indeed, the immediately preceding \nsubsections, (A)-(C), all require certification of items pertaining directly to the Byrne JAG \napplication itself. Moreover, the Byrne JAG program's FY 2017 solicitation literature directs \napplicants to specific federal laws that the applicants need to abide by. Those laws, unlike § \n1373, by their very language pertain expressly to federal grants and grant recipients, further \nindicating that compliance with § 1373 represents a departure from the grant's statutory \nrequirements. \nThe Attorney General's conditions, viewed in isolation, are perfectly reasonable. Federal \nofficers have a basic duty to ensure enforcement of and compliance with our country's \nimmigration laws. That the federal government would require cooperation with its agencies \nin exchange for grant funds should come as no surprise. Nevertheless, the Constitution \nplaces the power to spend money in the legislative branch. See U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1 \n(\"The Congress shall have Power ... to pay the Debts and provide for the ... general Welfare \n\nof the United States ....\"). The spending power also comes with the ancillary authority to \nplace conditions on the receipt of federal funds. Nat'l Fed'n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 \nU.S. 519, 576 (2012). So, the executive lacks authority to place conditions on the receipt of \nfederal funds unless Congress vests it with such power. See generally La. Pub. Serv. \nComm'n v. F.C.C., 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986) (\"[A]n agency literally has no power to act ... \nunless and until Congress confers power upon it.\"). Here, context clashes with the Attorney \nGeneral's expanded reading of § 10153(A)(5)(D), and he has received no such assignment \nof power from Congress. Holding Byrne JAG applicants to § 1373, therefore, is not \nsupported by law. \nII. \nI respectfully dissent, however, from my colleagues' view that the injunction here should be \napplied beyond Chicago, nationwide.  I departed from the panel on this same issue in our \n[4]\nprior opinion, see Chicago I, 888 F.3d at 293-300 (Manion, J., concurring in the judgment in \npart and dissenting in part), and for similar reasons here, I reiterate my disagreement.  \n[5]\nA. The Byrne JAG Statute \nIn Chicago I, the court justified a nationwide preliminary injunction to avoid \"simultaneous \nlitigation of [a] narrow question of law in countless jurisdictions\" and because the Attorney \nGeneral imposed unlawful conditions that applied \"uniformly\" to all grant applicants. 888 \nF.3d at 291-92. This time around, it seeks to affirm the same scope of relief on narrower \ngrounds. In a nutshell, the court claims the Byrne JAG statute's structure permits a \nnationwide injunction because all applicants—localities and states—are interconnected \nregarding how much funding they receive. Therefore, according to the court, a nationwide \ninjunction is needed to prevent the Attorney General from enforcing his unlawful conditions \nin other jurisdictions (beyond Chicago) because if those jurisdictions are denied funding for \nfailing to comply, then that will affect Chicago's award.  \n[6]\nThe court misinterprets the statute. With one exception, none of the provisions invoked by \nthe court—read singly or in combination—make Chicago's award contingent on any other \ngoverning body's compliance with the Attorney General's conditions. See generally 34 \nU.S.C. § 10156. For example, any reallocated funds Chicago receives under § 10156(e)(1) \ncome from excess awards granted to other local governments, not from those jurisdictions' \nnoncompliance. And, the joint application process described in § 10156(d)(4) is likewise \nsilent on whether one local government's failure to comply can alter the grant awards of its \nfellow \"geographical constituent units.\" \nFurthermore, the court theorizes that the disqualification of a given locality (for failing to \ncomply with the Attorney General's conditions) can alter Chicago's award amount because \nChicago's funds depend on both \"the number of applicants\" and its \"share of all violent \ncrimes reported in the state relative to those other applicants.\" Maj. Op. at 81 (emphasis \nadded). That's not what the statute says. Subsection 10156(d)(2)(A) governs grant \nallocations to localities. It directs the Attorney General to allocate an amount equal to the \nratio of (1) the average number of violent crimes reported by the applicant over the three \nmost recent years for which such data is available to (2) the number of \"violent crimes \n\nreported by all units of local government in the State in which the [applicant] is located ... for \nsuch years.\" Id. (emphasis added). By its own language—\"all units of local government\"—§ \n10156(d)(2)(A) simply compares the applicant's violent crimes against those reported by all \nlocalities within the applicant's state. In other words, even if another Illinois locality fails to \ncomply with the notice and access conditions, its violent crime statistics are not removed \nfrom § 10156(d)(2)(A)'s formula; they are still used to calculate Chicago's award. The ratio \nremains the same regardless of any other locality's noncompliance, and the yield for \nChicago, therefore, is not affected. The one exception, foreshadowed above, is § 10156(f). \nThat subsection provides: \nIf the Attorney General determines ... that a State will be unable to qualify or receive funds \nunder this part ... then such State's allocation (or portion thereof) shall be awarded by the \nAttorney General to units of local government, or combinations thereof, within such State .... \nId. (emphasis added). So, if a state falls out of compliance, any redistribution of funds \nbenefits that state's local governments. But if, for example, California refuses to comply with \nthe Attorney General's conditions, then California's allocation would not go to Chicago or \notherwise change Chicago's award at all. The states' allocations are siloed by state; in this \nexample, California's allocation (or portion thereof) would be redistributed only to compliant \nlocalities within its borders. \nThe court showcases the Keep Illinois Families Together Act, 5 ILCS 835, to emphasize \nthat \"[t]he possibility of [§ 10156(f)] impacting Chicago's grant amount is far from negligible\" \nbecause the Attorney General may determine the legislation runs afoul of his unlawful \nrequirements. Maj. Op. at 83. Maybe so. But while the possibility of an Illinois law impacting \nChicago's Byrne JAG award is \"more than negligible\" under § 10156(f), the possibility \nof another state's law impacting Chicago's award is zero. \nMy colleagues' reliance on the reallocation clauses in SORNA and PREA similarly falls \nshort of justifying nationwide relief. SORNA and PREA each provide that jurisdictions failing \nto implement the statutes' mandates will be penalized with a reduction to their Byrne JAG \naward. 34 U.S.C. § 20927(a) and § 30307(e)(2)(A). Those reductions are redistributed \namong SORNA- and PREA-compliant jurisdictions. Id. § 20927(c) and § 30307(e)(2)(E)(iii). \nThe court's theory is that, if states other than Illinois both (1) are held ineligible for a Byrne \nJAG grant because of the Attorney General's unlawful conditions and (2) fail to implement \nSORNA and PREA, then Illinois—and perhaps by extension, Chicago—will miss out on the \nreallocated penalties. The court thus believes only a nationwide injunction can prevent \ninjury to Chicago. \nBut Illinois and Chicago are not guaranteed reallocated funds in the first place; that depends \non whether any other jurisdictions fail to implement SORNA and PREA. Even still, how \nmuch money would Chicago stand to receive? Any reallocated penalties, while not small \nsums themselves, are a drop in the bucket compared to all Byrne JAG funds. As the court \nnotes, in FY 2016, reallocated SORNA penalties exceeded $6 million across the country. \nReallocated PREA penalties in FY 2019 totaled nearly $3 million. Compare those amounts \nwith nearly $275 million in Byrne JAG funds distributed for FY 2016 and over $252 million \nfor FY 2019.  Describing the reallocated SORNA and PREA penalties as \"significant\" \n[7]\n\noverstates the matter, yet the court's analysis of SORNA and PREA is a key player in its \napproval of injunctive relief that stretches beyond Chicago. \nSince other state and local governments' compliance with the Attorney General's conditions \ndoes not affect Chicago's award amount, the purported need for a nationwide injunction \ndisappears as Chicago cannot prove (and has not done so here) how an injunction imposed \nthroughout the country— upon every state and locality—is necessary to protect \nits own interests. See California v. Azar, 911 F.3d 558, 582 (9th Cir. 2018) (Nationwide \ninjunctive relief \"must be necessary to give prevailing parties the relief to which they are \nentitled.\") (internal quotations and citation omitted). Indeed, if granted injunctive relief for \njust Chicago, then Chicago cannot lose; it is guaranteed at least the same amount of grant \nmoney, if not more should the State of Illinois fail to qualify for funding. This outcome stays \nthe same under the court's statutory interpretation, too, where Chicago's funds can be \naltered by the non-compliance of other states or localities in other states. Even then, a \nlimited injunction would ensure Chicago receives either the same or more funding. \nThe court deems this relief not \"proper\" because it fears Chicago could receive a windfall \nwhen the would-be awards of other unlawfully denied applicants make their way into \nChicago's grant. First of all, this still does not justify nationwide relief. At best, it serves as a \nbasis for an Illinois-wide injunction because, again, nothing indicates the noncompliance of \nlocal governments or states outside Illinois will result in any additional funds being \nredistributed to Chicago. \nMore importantly, the \"proper\" relief the court speaks of is not for Chicago's redress, but for \nthat of unrelated non-parties; the relief here ensures other applicants receive their deserved \nslice of the pie. This approach oversteps the narrow and well-established maxim that \n\"injunctive relief should be no more burdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide \ncomplete relief to the plaintiffs,\" not to non-litigant third parties. Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 \nU.S. 682, 702 (1979) (emphasis added); see also Int'l Kennel Club of Chi., Inc. v. Mighty \nStar, Inc., 846 F.2d 1079, 1094 (7th Cir. 1988) (holding that the geographic scope of an \ninjunction \"must not exceed the extent of the plaintiff's protectable rights.\") (emphasis \nadded); Azar, 911 F.3d at 584 (\"The scope of [injunctive relief] must be no broader and no \nnarrower than necessary to redress the injury shown by the plaintiff[s].\") (emphasis added). \nThe \"usual rule,\" after all, is \"that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the individual \nnamed parties only.\" Califano, 442 U.S. at 700-01. Thus, the court's approach also breaks \nwith \"American courts' tradition of providing equitable relief only to parties ....\" Trump v. \nHawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392, 2427 (2018) (Thomas, J., concurring) (emphasis added). As \nJustice Thomas outlined: \nFor most of our history, courts understood judicial power as fundamentall[y] the power to \nrender judgments in individual cases. Misuses of judicial power, Hamilton reassured the \npeople of New York, could not threaten the general liberty of the people because courts, at \nmost, adjudicate the rights of individual[s]. \nId. at 2427-28 (alterations in the original) (internal quotation marks and citations \nomitted).  Chicago has failed to show why a nationwide injunction—and nothing less—is \n[8]\n\nnecessary to preserve its Byrne JAG award, and the court's statute-based explanation is, in \nmy view, inadequate to rescue the city's request. \nB. Mendoza Concerns \nEven were the court's statutory interpretation sound, I would still dissent because its \nreasoning necessarily depends on the following assumptions: that the parties presented the \ndistrict court with the very best arguments on the merits; that no other jurisdictions' \nstandards for injunctive relief would yield different results than in this case; that what goes \nfor a Chicago-specific ordinance goes for all others; and that no trial judge sitting in the 93 \nother districts could possibly reach a different decision on these issues. \nThe Supreme Court cautioned against these same kinds of assumptions in United States v. \nMendoza, determining that a judicial holding against the federal government in one case \ncould not be used by another party in another case \"to preclude relitigation of issues ....\" \n464 U.S. 154, 162 (1984). The Court was concerned that allowing parties to use preclusion \nin this way \"would substantially thwart the development of important questions of law by \nfreezing the first final decision rendered on a particular legal issue,\" thereby depriving the \nCourt of the benefit it receives when the various circuits explore and address difficult legal \nissues. Id. at 160. Thus, in barring the use of such nonmutual offensive collateral estoppel \nagainst the government, the Court sought to promote \"thorough development of legal \ndoctrine by allowing litigation in multiple forums.\" Id. at 163. \nWhile the Court in Mendoza did not address its concerns within the framework of nationwide \ninjunctions, its reasoning nonetheless applies here. Indeed, the Fourth and Ninth Circuits \nhave overruled nationwide injunctions as preventing the development of divergent views \nand outcomes. See Va. Soc'y for Human Life, Inc. v. Fed. Election Comm'n, 263 F.3d 379, \n393 (4th Cir. 2001) (remanding nationwide injunction in favor of more limited relief because \nsuch a broad measure encroaches on other circuits' ability to develop their own precedent, \nrelying on Mendoza), overruled on other grounds by Real Truth About Abortion, Inc. v. \nFEC, 681 F.3d 544, 550 n.2 (4th Cir. 2012); East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Barr, 934 F.3d \n1026, 1029-30 (9th Cir. 2019) (criticizing nationwide injunctions for depriving other parties of \nthe ability to litigate issues in other jurisdictions, interfering with judicial decisionmaking, and \npreventing the percolation of legal issues and the development of the law, citing accordance \nwith Mendoza in a footnote); Azar, 911 F.3d at 583-84 (determining nationwide injunction \noverbroad, citing Mendoza's concerns).  \n[9]\nBy affirming the nationwide scope of relief here, the court blocks the underlying issues from \npercolating through the lower courts and thereby hinders the issues' development, prevents \ndivergent legal views and opinions from coming to the fore, and forces all future litigants in \nthis country to accept the determination of one district judge who was presented \nwith one city's ordinance and who took arguments from one set of parties. These are real, \ntangible harms that impair our federal legal system. See Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2425 \n(Thomas, J., concurring) (\"[Nationwide] injunctions are beginning to take a toll on the \nfederal court system—preventing legal questions from percolating through the federal \ncourts, encouraging forum shopping, and making every case a national emergency for the \ncourts and for the Executive Branch.\"). And the fact that five circuits have now sounded off \non the Attorney General's conditions does not lessen the need for other courts to do so. \n\nDiversity of thought and opinion that flows from percolation is meant to benefit not only the \nCourts of Appeals, but our Supreme Court as well. See Arizona v. Evans, 514 U.S. 1, 23 \nn.1 (1995) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (\"[W]hen frontier legal problems are presented, periods \nof `percolation' in, and diverse opinions from, state and federal appellate courts may yield a \nbetter informed and more enduring final pronouncement by this Court.\"). Why should the \njudiciary call it a day after only five circuits weigh in, especially when they are split? \nIII. \nThe phenomenon of nationwide injunctions began to emerge in the latter half of the \ntwentieth century but has \"exploded in popularity\" in recent years. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at \n2429 (Thomas, J., concurring). Indeed, in the public domain, the Attorney General has \nrepresented that, as of September 2019, the current administration had already faced at \nleast forty such injunctions, compared with twenty total throughout the previous \nadministration's eight years. William Barr, End Nationwide Injunctions, The Wall Street \nJournal, Sept. 5, 2019, http://www.wsj.com/articles/end-nationwide-injunctions-\n11567723072 (last visited April 24, 2020). That figure has since gone up. \nThe nationwide injunction trend has also received scrutiny from the academy, and as \nJustice Thomas cautioned, the Supreme Court will be \"dutybound to adjudicate\" the lower \ncourts' authority to issue such \"legally and historically dubious\" injunctions should the \npractice continue. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2429 (Thomas, J., concurring). \nLast year, when ordering a limited injunction to ensure relief to the sole plaintiff before him, \nJudge Bennett of the District of Maryland observed: \nIt is clear that most of the nationwide injunctions issued against the federal government in \nthe past two years have come from United States District Courts in states less favorably \ninclined politically to the current administration. It is also clear that most of the nationwide \ninjunctions against the federal government in the years before also came from United \nStates District Courts in states less favorably inclined politically to the previous \nadministration. It is important that the federal judiciary not allow itself to become part of \nunderlying policy debate. \nMayor & City Council of Baltimore v. Azar, 392 F. Supp. 3d. 602, 619 n.12 (D. Md. \n2019) (emphasis added) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Considering the recent \nflood of nationwide injunctions, I echo Judge Bennett in emphasizing this final point: we \nmust not allow nationwide injunctions to serve as pretext for judicial activism. \nAn injunction is a \"drastic and extraordinary\" remedy, Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed \nFarms, 561 U.S. 139, 165 (2010), outdone only by an injunction issued on a national scale. \nThis type of relief should be issued only when absolutely necessary, and it is far from \nnecessary here. This is a funding case at its core, not an immigration case, where a \nnationwide injunction may, in very limited circumstances, be appropriate. See, e.g., Int'l \nRefugee Assistance Project v. Trump, 857 F.3d 554, 605 (4th Cir. 2017) (upholding a \nnationwide injunction on the President's \"travel ban\" because plaintiffs were \"dispersed \nthroughout the United States\" and there existed a need to apply immigration laws \nuniformly). Those circumstances are not present here. Therefore, once again, I would \n\nremand this issue in its entirety to the district court with instructions to curtail its injunction \nso as to prevent the Attorney General from enforcing the unlawful conditions with respect to \nChicago's funds only. \n[1] The Homeland Security Act of 2002 completely dismantled the Immigration and Naturalization Service and \ncreated a new cabinet level agency— the Department of Homeland Security—under which Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement (ICE) now operates. See Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135. \n[2] Although one additional claim was dismissed without prejudice, the City of Chicago has informed the court that it \ndisavows any right to further pursue that claim in this action, and therefore the judgment is reviewable under § \n1291. See West v. Louisville Gas & Elec. Co., 920 F.3d 499, 506 (7th Cir. 2019). \n[3] In the course of his argument that § 10102(a)(6) authorizes the imposition of the additional certification condition, \nthe Attorney General also states in a parenthetical that the additional certification condition \"also involves the \nprovision of programmatic information to the extent that any active impeding takes the form of withholding \ninformation, see 34 U.S.C. § 10153(A)(4).\" Appellant Brief, No. 19-3290, at 22; see also City of Providence v. \nBarr, 2020 WL 1429579 at *7 (1st Cir. March 24, 2020) (rejecting the argument that the \"programmatic information\" \nlanguage in § 10153(A)(4) provided authority for the conditions). That is the sole reference to § 10153(A)(4) as a \nbasis to support the imposition of the additional certification condition, and is insufficient to raise the argument before \nthis court. See Sauk Prairie Conservation All. v. United States Dep't of the Interior, 944 F.3d 664, 674 (7th Cir. 2019). \n[4] The Attorney General argues that some federal laws and regulations include language modifying \"applicable,\" and \nthat absent such language the term should be interpreted as unbounded (citing 42 U.S.C. § 16154(g)(1) (\"generally \napplicable Federal laws and regulations governing awards of financial assistance, contracts, or other agreements\") \nand Pub. L. No. 113-121, § 1043(a)(3)(C)(ii)(II), 128 Stat. 1193, 1246 (2014) (\"all applicable Federal laws (including \nregulations) relating to the use of the funds\")). It is not at all clear that such language serves to narrow rather than to \nclarify, but regardless, the use of modifying language in other statutes does not alter our conclusion that the context, \nlanguage and structure of this statute defines the phrase as including only laws relating to grants and grantees. \n[5] As we noted in Chicago I, the provision for discretionary grants is located in a different subpart of the same \nstatute, and \"imbues the Director (who reports to the Assistant Attorney General) with the authority to award funds on \nterms and conditions that the Director determines to be consistent with that subpart.\" Chicago I, 888 F.3d at 286. \n[6] In addition to the impropriety of such discretion in a formula grant generally, the discretion to set conditions here is \nalso problematic because the certification provided in § 10153(A)(5) is only a certification \"in a form acceptable to the \nAttorney General\" that the applicant will comply with all other applicable federal laws. The statute, then, grants \ndiscretion only over the form of the certification, not the content as the Attorney General seeks to assert \nhere. Compare 13 U.S.C. § 141 (providing that \"[t]he Secretary shall ... take a decennial census of the population ... \nin such form and content as he may determine ....\") (emphasis added); accord City of Providence, 2020 WL 1429579 \nat *11. \n[7] The terms \"nationwide\" and \"universal\" injunctions are both used by courts and commentators to describe \ninjunctions for which relief extends beyond the plaintiff, see Wasserman, Nationwide Injunctions at 352-53, and we \nuse these terms interchangeably in this opinion. As to the relief provided in this case, we use \"program-wide\" \ninjunction because it is more descriptive of the actual reach of the injunction here. \n[8] They subsequently explained that injunctions restraining the \"United States\" from nationwide enforcement of a law \ncould not happen until after 1976, when the United States enacted its first general waiver of sovereign immunity, and \nthat suits to restrain high level executive branch officials like the Attorney General were difficult to bring because \"[i]n \nthe absence of the modern venue statute, and because of doctrinal barriers that no longer exist, a modern nationwide \ninjunction could only have been brought in Washington, D.C.\" Amicus at 18-19. \n[1] Although Chicago's ordinance places the city among other so-called \"sanctuary\" jurisdictions, Chicago creatively \nlabels itself a \"welcoming city,\" perhaps to avoid prosecutorial suspicion over whether its elected officials are \ncommitting a federal harboring offense. Federal law makes it a crime for any person, \"knowing or in reckless \ndisregard of the fact that an alien has come to, entered, or remains in the United States in violation of law,\" to \n\"harbor\" that alien. 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(iii). The same statute also criminalizes encouraging or inducing an alien \nto \"come to, enter, or reside in the United States,\" knowing that such entry or residence would be in violation of \n\nlaw. Id. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(iv). With the right facts, a policy like Chicago's could very well facilitate harboring or at least \nencourage and induce aliens to enter and reside unlawfully in the United States. \n[2] Compare 2018 CHI. POLICE DEP'T ANN. REP., at 62 (2019), available at http://home.chicagopolice.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/07/2018AnnualReport-05July19.pdf (last visited April 24, 2020), with FED. BUREAU OF \nINVESTIGATION, CRIME IN THE UNITED STATES 2018, Table 25: Percent of Offenses Cleared by Arrest or \nExceptional Means, available at https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-\n2018/topicpages/tables/table-25 (last visited April 24, 2020). \n[3] As the court notes, the Attorney General concedes the two compliance conditions—§ 1373 and § 1644—rise and \nfall together. \n[4] I use the term \"nationwide\" while recognizing that \"universal\" might be more precise, see Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. \nCt. 2392, 2425 n.1 (2018) (Thomas, J., concurring): the court's injunction really prohibits the Attorney General from \nenforcing a policy with respect to any applicant, regardless of geographic scope. I do not, however, accept the court's \nreference to a \"program-wide\" injunction. This word choice is an obvious euphemism that downplays the injunction's \ninappropriate extension to non-parties and tiptoes around the growing criticism of nationwide injunctions in general. \n[5] I do not dissent, however, from the court's decision to affirm the injunction's temporal scope, i.e., \"all future years.\" \nNor do I disagree with remanding for the district court to consider proper injunctive relief regarding the compliance \ncondition. \n[6] The court relied on this same statute-based logic in its previous decision, but to a lesser degree and without the \nsame detailed discussion as here.

Chicago brings this action to enjoin the Attorney General of the United States \nfrom yet again imposing  sweeping immigration  policy conditions  on the Edward Byrne \nMemorial Justice Assistance Grant (“Byrne JAG”) program, a formula grant that has for years \nprovided crucial support for law enforcement in Chicago and other cities.   \n2.  The challenged conditions  are unauthorized  by Congress and ultra vires, and \nviolate federalism principles.  They are an unlawful attempt to punish Chicago for prioritizing \npublic safety for all Chicagoans instead of yielding  to federal dictates.  In fact, this Court struck \ndown many of the conditions  already, issuing  a permanent injunction  just months ago preventing \nthe conditions  from being applied to last year’s Byrne JAG grants.  But despite the Court’s clear \nruling  that the conditions  are unlawful,  and its clear warning that re-issuing them could result in \nan award of attorney’s fees against the federal government, the Attorney General purports to \n-1- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 2 of 57 PageID #:240\n  \nimpose them again on grants for FY2018.  This renewed attempt to conscript local police to \nserve federal policy contravenes the Constitution  and federal statutes alike.  Just like the FY2017 \nconditions,  the FY2018 conditions  are unlawful on their face and should be set aside. \n3.  The conditions  are also unlawful as applied to Chicago, because they were \nimposed on Chicago’s award by an official who is unlawfully  occupying the Office of the \nAttorney General.  Since former Attorney General Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III’s \nresignation on November 7, 2018, Matthew Whitaker, Mr. Sessions’ chief of staff, has purported \nto assume the duties of the office of the Attorney General at the direction of the President.  Mr. \nWhitaker’s appointment  as acting Attorney General violates federal law and the Appointments \nClause.  Chicago received an award letter for its FY2018 Byrne JAG grant on November 20, \n2018—thirteen  days after Mr. Whitaker began acting as Attorney General.  The award \nnotification—issued  under the authority of the Attorney General—purported to impose the \nchallenged conditions  on Chicago’s receipt of Byrne JAG grant funds.  In addition  to the \nproblem that the challenged conditions  are not authorized by Congress and therefore ultra vires \nregardless of who heads the Department of Justice, Mr. Whitaker may not permissibly  impose \nthem on Chicago because he may not lawfully  exercise the powers of the Office of the Attorney \nGeneral.   \nBACKGROUND \n4.  Since the 1980s, Chicago has adhered to a “Welcoming  City” policy  that \nprioritizes  local crimefighting  and community  engagement, rather than federal civil immigration \nenforcement.  That policy  promotes cooperation between local law enforcement and the diverse \nimmigrant  communities  that have long flourished  in Chicago.  For many years, Chicago’s \nWelcoming  City policy  has been no obstacle to its receipt of law enforcement funds under the \nByrne JAG formula grant program. \n-2- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 3 of 57 PageID #:241\n  \n5.  Despite that long history, last year, Attorney General Sessions tried to use the \nByrne JAG program to gut Chicago’s Welcoming  City policy  and others like it.  In July 2017, \nthe Department of Justice released the FY2017 solicitation  for Byrne JAG funding.  The \nsolicitation  informed grant applicants that they would be expected to comply with three \nimmigration-related  grant conditions.   Those conditions  would have required Chicago (1) to \ndetain its own residents and others at federal immigration  officials’ request, in order to give the \nfederal government a 48-hour notice window prior to an arrestee’s release (the “notice \ncondition”);  (2) to give federal immigration  officials unlimited  access to local police stations and \nlaw enforcement facilities  in order to interrogate any suspected non-citizen  held there, effectively \nfederalizing  all of the City’s detention facilities  (the “access condition”);  and (3) to certify \ncompliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373, a federal statute that bars local governments from restricting \ntheir employees from sharing citizenship  and immigration  status information  with federal \nimmigration  authorities (the “Section 1373 compliance condition”). \n6.  Chicago sued, and this Court (Leinenweber, J.) held the three conditions \nunconstitutional  and ultra vires and set them aside.  The Court first issued a preliminary \ninjunction  against the notice and access conditions that was affirmed by the Seventh Circuit.  \nThen, in July 2018, the Court permanently enjoined all three conditions  for FY2017.  In its \ndecision on the permanent injunction,  the Court held that the notice and access conditions were \nunlawful because, consistent with the Seventh Circuit’s ruling,  no statute authorized the Attorney \nGeneral to impose discretionary policy conditions  on the Byrne JAG formula grant program, and \nthus his attempt to do so anyway—to usurp Congress’s legislative  authority by rewriting basic \naspects of the Byrne JAG program—violated  the constitutional  Separation of Powers.  The Court \nalso held that the Section 1373 compliance condition  was unlawful because Section 1373 itself is \n-3- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 4 of 57 PageID #:242\n  \nfacially unconstitutional  under the Tenth Amendment anti-commandeering  doctrine.  In addition, \nthe Court ordered the Attorney General to issue Chicago’s FY2017 award and to release \nChicago’s FY2017 award funds no later than when the Attorney General issued awards and \nreleased funds for any other grantee.  The Court also made clear that it would not tolerate any \nattempt by the Attorney General to circumvent its ruling  by re-imposing  the conditions  in \nFY2018.  If the Attorney General re-imposed the conditions,  the Court noted, Chicago’s \n“lawyers would get paid.” \n7.  In the face of those rulings,  Attorney General Sessions once again attempted to \npress local law enforcement officers into the service of the federal immigration  authorities  by \nimposing  sweeping policy conditions  on Byrne JAG formula grant funds—this time, as a \ncondition  on FY2018 funds.  Those conditions  are unlawful both facially and as applied to \nChicago.   \n8.  In the FY2018 Byrne JAG solicitation,  the Department of Justice specifically \nnoted that it would issue awards by September 30, 2018.  In early October 2018, the Department \nbegan releasing FY2018 Byrne JAG award letters.  By the time Chicago filed its initial \ncomplaint  on October 12, 2018, the Department had issued 752 FY2018 local awards, totaling \nalmost $59 million—70%  of the local funding available for FY2018, covering over 65% of the \neligible  jurisdictions.   But notwithstanding  this Court’s order not to delay Chicago’s FY2017 \naward, the Department did not issue Chicago’s FY2018 award at the same time as the awards for \nthe other 752 jurisdictions.    \n9.  Instead, Chicago was forced to file suit to prompt action on its FY2018 Byrne \nJAG application.   Only after Chicago filed this lawsuit did the Department finally  issue \n-4- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 5 of 57 PageID #:243\n  \nChicago’s FY2018 award on November 20, 2018, two months after the Department began \nissuing awards to hundreds of other jurisdictions.     \n10.  Four of the conditions  announced in the FY2018 solicitation  and included in \nChicago’s FY2018 Byrne JAG award are materially identical to the FY2017 Byrne JAG \nconditions  this Court has already set aside as unlawful.  Specifically,  the Department once again \nrequired Chicago and its subgrantees, as well as all other Byrne JAG recipients, to:  (1) comply \nwith 8 U.S.C. § 1373, which this Court already held facially unconstitutional;  (2) comply with 8 \nU.S.C. § 1644, which prohibits  the same conduct as Section 1373 and is thus unconstitutional  for \nthe same reason; (3) provide 48 hours’ advance notice to federal immigration  authorities,  “where \nfeasible” and when requested, before releasing an alien from custody, just like the notice \ncondition  that was already set aside as unlawful by this Court; and (4) provide federal authorities \nwith “access to any correctional facility  in order to meet with an alien (or an individual  believed \nto be an alien) and inquire as to his right to be or remain in the United States,” just like the access \ncondition  already set aside by this Court.   \n11.  On or about November 2, 2018—weeks after Chicago filed this lawsuit—the \nDepartment posted a separate “Special Notice” on its website stating that the Department will not \n“use or enforce” these conditions  against Chicago while this litigation  is pending.  The Notice, \nhowever, does not formally  withdraw the conditions  and expressly purports to reserve the \nDepartment’s right to impose the conditions  at a later date.    \n12.  Beyond attempting to resuscitate the conditions  that this Court already held \nunlawful,  the Attorney General also added a new unlawful condition  requiring  Chicago and other \ncities not to publicly  disclose federal law enforcement information  in an attempt to conceal, \nharbor, or shield from detection fugitives from justice or undocumented immigrants,  even where \n-5- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 6 of 57 PageID #:244\n  \nsuch disclosure would not violate the law.  This vague and sweeping new condition  would chill \nCity officials from publicly  criticizing  controversial federal immigration  enforcement strategies, \nsuch as the targeting of noncitizens  at courthouses or other sensitive locations.    \n13.  Neither the Byrne JAG statute nor any other statute allows the Attorney General \nto impose conditions  on Byrne JAG formula grant funds.  Indeed, most of the conditions \nimposed on the FY2018 Byrne JAG program were already held unlawful by this Court in the \nlitigation  over the FY2017 Byrne JAG program, and Chicago is accordingly  entitled to attorney’s \nfees and costs because the unreasonable decision to impose unlawful  conditions  has forced \nChicago to prosecute this action to once again obtain an injunction  against them. \n14.  The law has not changed since this Court last ruled:  The Federal Executive may \nnot arrogate power that the Constitution  reserves to Congress on the one hand, or to state and \nlocal governments on the other.  Yet the imposition  on the Byrne JAG formula grant program of \npolicy conditions  that were never approved by Congress does just that.  The conditions  would \nalso federalize local jails, mandate warrantless detentions for civil  infractions, sow fear in local \nimmigrant  communities,  undermine local law, and make the people of Chicago less safe.   \n15.  The new conditions  are just as harmful as those struck down by this Court, and in \nprecisely the same ways.  They threaten local policies  that foster crucial trust between police and \nimmigrant  communities,  on pain of denying Chicago crucial funds that provide lifesaving \nequipment to Chicago police officers and critical services to Chicago residents, in the face of this \nCourt’s explicit ruling  last year that these conditions  are unlawful and that the harms to Chicago \nare irreparable and cannot be remedied by later payment of the funds at issue.   \n16.  The conditions  additionally  are unlawful as applied to Chicago because during the \nperiod between the filing  of the initial  complaint  and the issuance of Chicago’s Byrne JAG \n-6- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 7 of 57 PageID #:245\n  \naward, Attorney General Sessions resigned, and the President unlawfully  directed Mr. Whitaker \nto assume the duties of the Attorney General.  Mr. Whitaker lacks the statutory and constitutional \nauthority to impose these conditions—or  any other conditions—on  Chicago’s Byrne JAG grant. \n17.  This Court should order declaratory and corresponding  injunctive  relief \nconfirming  that the challenged conditions  are unlawful and ultra vires and setting those \nconditions  aside pursuant to the Administrative  Procedure Act (“APA”).  In order to prevent an \nendless cycle of litigation,  in which the Attorney General unlawfully  withholds  Chicago’s grant \nfunds each year until Chicago sues and the Court intervenes, that relief should cover FY2018 and \nall future grant years.  The Attorney General should be ordered to pay Chicago the City’s \nattorney’s fees and costs incurred in relitigating  conditions  previously  enjoined by this Court.   \n18.  This Court should also order declaratory and corresponding  injunctive  relief \nconfirming  that Mr. Whitaker cannot lawfully exercise the duties of the office of the Attorney \nGeneral and that such duties instead must be exercised by Deputy Attorney General Rod J. \nRosenstein unless and until another proper appointment  is made. \nPARTIES \n19.  Plaintiff Chicago is a municipal  corporation and home rule unit organized and \nexisting under the constitution  and laws of the State of Illinois.   Chicago is the third largest city \nin the Nation, and is home to almost 3 million  residents, including  numerous immigrants. \n20.  The Attorney General of the United States is the federal official in charge of the \nDepartment of Justice, which took and threatens to take the actions at issue in this lawsuit.  The \nAttorney General of the United States is also the federal official that the Byrne JAG statute \ndirects to administer the Byrne JAG program.  At all relevant times prior to November 7, 2018, \nthe Attorney General was Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III.  Since November 7, 2018, Matthew \nWhitaker purports to exercise the duties of the office of the Attorney General of the United \n-7- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 8 of 57 PageID #:246\n  \nStates and claims to be the federal official in charge of the Department of Justice, pursuant to an \norder of the President to that effect.  At the time of that order, Mr. Whitaker was not serving in a \nSenate-confirmed role.1  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n21.  The Court has subject matter jurisdiction  under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1346.  The \nCourt is authorized to issue the relief sought here under the Administrative  Procedure Act, 5 \nU.S.C. §§ 702, 705, 706, the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651, the mandamus statute, 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1361, the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201, 2202, and the United States \nConstitution. \n22.  Venue is proper in the Northern District of Illinois  under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) \nbecause substantial events giving  rise to this action occurred therein and because Chicago resides \ntherein and no real property is involved  in this action. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nI.  CHICAGO PRIORITIZES LOCAL CRIMEFIGHTING UNDER ITS \nWELCOMING CITY POLICY  \n23.  Chicago is a metropolis  of almost 3 million  that has attracted migrants and \nimmigrants  of every race, nationality,  and creed for nearly two centuries.  Chicago’s diverse \npopulation  requires a public  safety strategy that respects all the City’s residents.  One aspect of \nthat strategy—the Welcoming  City Ordinance—has developed over the past few decades.  \n                                              \n1   In light of Attorney General Sessions’s departure from office, his successor is \nautomatically  substituted in the caption of this official capacity action under the Federal Rules.  \nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 25 (d).  However, the identity  of Mr. Sessions’s successor—and more \nspecifically,  the purported installation  of Matthew Whitaker as Acting Attorney General—is \ncontested, for the reasons noted herein.  For ease of reference, Chicago has restyled this action as \nChicago v. Attorney General of the United States.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(d) (“A public officer \nwho sues or is sued in an official capacity may be designated by official title rather than by \nname.”).  \n-8- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 9 of 57 PageID #:247\n  \n24.  The first formal iteration of the policy was announced by then-Mayor Harold \nWashington in a 1985 Executive Order that provided that City officials would not “request \ninformation  about or otherwise investigate or assist in the investigation  of the citizenship  or \nresidency status of any person” unless required by other law to do so.  Mayor Richard M. Daley \nreiterated this policy upon taking office in April 1989.   \n25.  In 2006, the Chicago City Council unanimously  incorporated the policy  into the \nCity’s Municipal  Code by enacting the Welcoming City Ordinance.  Among other things, the \nCouncil cited its concern that local enforcement of federal immigration  infractions would “cause \na chilling  effect on crime prevention and solving  if both witnesses and victims are called upon to \nweigh a need to cooperate with local authorities against a fear of deportation, thereby \nundermining  long-standing  efforts to engender trust and cooperation between law enforcement \nofficials and immigrant  communities.”  Like the executive orders that preceded it, the 2006 \nOrdinance prohibited  City “agent[s]” and “agenc[ies]” from “request[ing] information  about or \notherwise investigat[ing]  or assist[ing] in the investigation  of the citizenship  or residency status \nof any person unless such inquiry  or investigation  is required by Illinois  State Statute, federal \nregulation,  or court decision.”  It also barred disclosure of “information  regarding the citizenship \nor residency status of any person unless required to do so by legal process . . . .”  \n26.  In 2012, Mayor Rahm Emmanuel and the Chicago City Council expanded the \nWelcoming  City Ordinance to address increasing federal requests to detain individuals  suspected \nof immigration-related  offenses (also known as “immigration  holds”) issued by U.S. \nImmigration  and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”).  The expanded Welcoming City Ordinance \nprovides that Chicago will comply with an immigration  hold only when it has an independent \n-9- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 10 of 57 PageID #:248\n  \nreason to believe that the subject poses a threat to public safety, such as if they have an \noutstanding  criminal warrant, or have been identified  as a gang member.   \n27.  The 2012 Welcoming  City Ordinance reflects the City Council’s findings  that \n(1) “the cooperation of all persons, both documented citizens and those without documentation \nstatus, is essential to achieve the City’s goals of protecting life and property, preventing crime \nand resolving  problems,” (2) “assistance from a person, whether documented or not, who is a \nvictim of, or a witness to, a crime is important to promoting  the safety of all [of the City’s] \nresidents,” and (3) “[t]he cooperation of the City’s immigrant  communities  is essential to prevent \nand solve crimes and maintain public order, safety and security in the entire City.”  Chicago \nMunicipal  Code § 2-173-005. \n28.  The current Welcoming  City Ordinance, codified as Chapter 2-173 of the Chicago \nMunicipal  Code, and the Chicago Police Department’s implementing  policy,  Special Order S06-\n14-03, contain several key prohibitions  relevant to this lawsuit.   \na.  Subject to certain exceptions for certain criminal  suspects and gang members,2 \nSection 2-173-042 prohibits  City “agent[s]” or “agenc[ies]” from “arrest[ing], \ndetain[ing]  or continu[ing]  to detain a person solely on the belief that the person is \nnot present legally  in the United States, or that the person has committed a civil \nimmigration  violation,”  or doing so “based upon an immigration  detainer, when \nsuch immigration  detainer is based solely on a violation  of a civil  immigration \nlaw.” \n                                              \n2   Specifically,  and as noted above, the Section 2-173-042 restrictions do not apply if the \nsubject of the ICE investigation  “(1) has an outstanding  criminal  warrant; (2) has been convicted \nof a felony in any court of competent jurisdiction;  (3) is a defendant in a criminal  case in any \ncourt of competent jurisdiction  where a judgment has not been entered and a felony charge is \npending; or (4) has been identified  as a known gang member.” \n-10- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 11 of 57 PageID #:249\n  \nb.  Subject to the same exceptions, as well as an exception for “legitimate  law \nenforcement purpose[s] . . . unrelated to the enforcement of a civil immigration \nlaw,” Section 2-173-042 also prohibits  City “agent[s]” or “agenc[ies]” from, \n“while on duty, expend[ing] their time responding to ICE inquiries  or \ncommunicating  with ICE regarding a person’s custody status or release date,” or \nfrom “permit[ting]  ICE agents access to a person being detained by, or in the \ncustody of, the agency or agent” or “permit[ting]  ICE agents use of agency \nfacilities for investigative  interviews or other investigative  purpose.”   \nc.  The prohibitions  of Section 2-173-042  are implemented  by Chicago Police \nDepartment (“CPD”) Special Order S06-14-03,  which contains the same \nprohibitions,  subject to the same exceptions, as Section 2-173-042. \nd.  Section 2-173-020 prohibits  City “agent[s]” or “agenc[ies]” from “request[ing] \ninformation  about or otherwise investigat[ing]  or assist[ing] in the investigation  of \nthe citizenship  or immigration  status of any person unless such inquiry  or \ninvestigation  is required by Illinois  State Statute, federal regulation,  or court \ndecision.” \ne.  Section 2-173-030 prohibits  City “agent[s]” or “agenc[ies]” from “disclos[ing] \ninformation  regarding the citizenship  or immigration  status of any person” unless \n“otherwise provided under applicable federal law,” the City is “required to do so \nby legal process,” or “such disclosure has been authorized in writing by the \nindividual  to whom such information  pertains.” \n29.  Chicago’s official interpretation of the Welcoming  City Ordinance—which was \nexpressly communicated to all City Departments in October 2017—is that the Welcoming  City \n-11- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 12 of 57 PageID #:250\n  \nOrdinance is not intended to prohibit  or restrict any Chicago entity or official from sending to or \nreceiving from federal immigration  authorities information  concerning an individual’s \nimmigration  status.  Nor is it intended to enable the City to harbor undocumented individuals.   It \nis instead intended to prevent Chicago and its police officers from themselves enforcing federal \nimmigration  law.   \n30.  Chicago’s Welcoming City policy plays a vital role in strengthening the \nrelationship  between Chicago’s government, its police force, and its immigrant  communities.   \nThis relationship  is built city block by city block, and it is essential that Chicago’s police officers \nhave the flexibility  they need to engage the immigrant  communities  in their crime-fighting \ninitiatives  without projecting  a constant threat of deportation.  Social science research has \nconsistently shown that policies like the City’s Welcoming City policy are sound means of \nbuilding  trust with immigrant  communities  and reducing crime.  One recent review of relevant \nliterature concluded that “existing evidence supports the expansion of limited  cooperation \npolicies” like Chicago’s Welcoming  City Ordinance.3  Another recent study found that “crime is \nstatistically  significantly  lower in sanctuary counties compared to nonsanctuary counties . . . \ncontrolling  for population  characteristics.”4  That conclusion is consistent with the lived \nexperience of untold police officers; as a broad coalition  of police chiefs explained,  “build[ing] \ntrusting and supportive relations with immigrant  communities  . . . is essential to reducing crime \nand helping  victims.”5  By contrast, the idea that policies like Chicago’s encourage crime is a \n                                              \n3   Daniel E.

Meanwhile, the perception that Chicago’s policies provide amnesty or \n“sanctuary” to violent criminals  is also false.  As the Seventh Circuit recognized, Chicago’s \npolicy is designed to avoid local participation  in federal immigration  enforcement but “does not \ninterfere in any way with the federal government’s lawful pursuit of its civil immigration \nactivities,  and presence in such localities  will not immunize  anyone to the reach of the federal \ngovernment.  The federal government can and does freely operate in ‘sanctuary’ localities.”   City \nof Chicago v. Sessions, 888 F.3d 272, 281 (7th Cir. 2018).  Moreover, Chicago makes exceptions \nto this general non-participation  policy for individuals  most likely  to present a threat to the \ncommunity,  such as those with an outstanding  criminal  warrant and those who are known gang \nmembers.

THE BYRNE JAG PROGRAM, A NON-DISCRETIONARY FORMULA GRANT \nPROGRAM, PROVIDES LAW ENFORCEMENT FUNDING FOR CHICAGO \n32.  Congress created the current Byrne JAG program in 2005 by merging two \nfunding programs for state and local criminal justice initiatives.   H.R. Rep. No. 109-233,  at 88-\n89 (2005).  Those predecessor programs afforded state and local governments significant \ndiscretion over their use of program funds.  In combining  the programs, Congress sought to give \ngrantees even “more flexibility  to spend money for programs that work for them rather than to \nimpose a ‘one size fits all’ solution” for local policing.   Id. \n33.  The Byrne JAG program’s design promotes local discretion by circumscribing  the \nAttorney General’s authority to impose federal policy priorities  on grantees.  The program \n                                              \n6   Benjamin Gonzalez et al., The Politics of Refuge: Sanctuary Cities, Crime, and \nUndocumented Immigration, 9-10, 18-24, Urb. Aff. Rev. (2017), http://tinyurl.com/y8hb9fnc.    \n-13- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 14 of 57 PageID #:252\n  \nrequires that the Attorney General “shall allocate” funds, 34 U.S.C. § 10156(d)(2)(A),  “in \naccordance with” a formula based on population  and crime statistics, id. § 10152(a)(1).  See id. \n§ 10156(d)(2)(A).   \n34.  Consistent with the nature of formula grants, the Byrne JAG statute limits  the \nAttorney General’s discretion over the program.  He does not decide the amount of each grant.  \nRather, the Attorney General must follow the statutory formula to determine allotments  for each \nstate and local government.  34 U.S.C. § 10156.  As part of this process, the Attorney General is \nauthorized to “reserve not more than 5 percent” of the funds allocated to the program for specific \npurposes after a finding  that such reservation is “necessary” to address “extraordinary increases \nin crime” or to “mitigate significant  programmatic harm” caused by the formula.  Id. § 10157(b).  \nThe statute authorizes no other deviations from the prescribed formula.   \n35.  The Attorney General’s authority to define or modify the components of the \nByrne JAG application  is similarly  circumscribed.  He may specify the “form” of the application.   \n34 U.S.C. § 10153(a).  He may specify what “data, records, and information  (programmatic and \nfinancial)” applicants can be “reasonably” required to provide to ensure programmatic and \nfinancial integrity.   Id. § 10153(a)(4).  He can “coordinat[e] with the National Institute of \nJustice” to develop a mandatory “program assessment component” to measure the success of \nfunded programs.  Id. § 10152(c).  And he can require applicants to “comply  with all provisions \nof this part and all other applicable  Federal laws.”  Id. § 10153(a)(5)(D).  There is no provision \nauthorizing  him to alter the application’s  components, or to add new policy requirements.   \n36.  Byrne JAG applications  have only one substantive component:   A plan indicating \nhow the applicant will use its funds within one or more of eight broadly defined programmatic \nareas, 34 U.S.C. § 10153(a)(6),  ranging from “[l]aw enforcement” to “[d]rug treatment” to \n-14- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 15 of 57 PageID #:253\n  \n“crime victim” support, id. § 10152(a)(1)(A)-(H).  An applicant is entitled to receive its Byrne \nJAG allotment  so long as it uses funds to advance “any one” of those objectives.  Id. \n§§ 10152(a)(1)-(2), 10153(a)(6)(B).   \n37.  Indeed, federal law prohibits  the Department of Justice from using the Byrne JAG \nprogram to “exercise any direction,  supervision,  or control over any police force or any other \ncriminal  justice agency of any State or any political  subdivision  thereof.”  28 U.S.C. § 10228. \n38.  Chicago has received Byrne JAG funds every fiscal year between 2005, the year \nthe program began, and 2017.  In FY2016, Chicago received $2.33 million  through the Byrne \nJAG program.  Chicago received its FY2017 award letter, awarding it $2.2 million,  on August \n20, 2018 (but, as explained herein, only after litigating  for more than a year to enjoin  the \nimmigration-related  conditions  that Attorney General Sessions unlawfully  sought to impose on \nthe FY2017 funds).   \n39.  Chicago has used Byrne JAG funds to support projects ranging from critical law \nenforcement equipment and overtime to community  policing  outreach and engagement.  Since \nFY2005, for instance, Chicago has spent approximately  $33 million  in Byrne JAG funds to buy \nnearly 1,000 police vehicles.  Several of those projects have extended across multiple  grant \nyears, including  the Force for Good program, which began in 2011 and helps not-for-profit \norganizations  meet community  needs in neighborhoods  experiencing high rates of violent crime, \nby providing  services such as emergency shelter and clothing;  youth mentoring and safe, \nstructured activities; and job training  and placement.  Most recently, Chicago has used Byrne \nJAG funds to pay for ShotSpotter technology,  which facilitates rapid police responses to \nshooting incidents.  Without Byrne JAG funds, Chicago would have to restrict or shut down \nsome or all of these programs, or else divert funds from other policing  objectives to sustain them.   \n-15- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 16 of 57 PageID #:254\n  \n40.   Chicago plans to use its FY2018 Byrne JAG funds to increase its Bureau of \nDetectives’ capacity to clear violent cases and bring shooters to justice.  Those capacity-building \nefforts include a planned investment in technology  that will permit forensic analysis of mobile \ndevices; an initiative  to digitize  hard-copy records and make them searchable; prioritized  case \nand evidence review of homicides,  nonfatal shootings,  and cold cases to generate new \ninvestigative  leads; and advanced interview and investigation  training for detectives.  An \nadditional  portion of the Byrne JAG funding will support the Force for Good program.     \n41.  Eleven other local governments, including  Cook County, the City of Evanston, \nand the Village of Skokie, depend on Chicago’s Byrne JAG application  for the funds they \nreceive through the program each year.  Those subgrantees receive their own Byrne JAG funds \nthrough Chicago’s application. \nIII.  THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TARGETS CHICAGO’S BYRNE JAG FUNDING \nA.  The Trump Administration And Attorney General Sessions Target So-Called \nSanctuary Cities  \n42.  Despite the soundness of Chicago’s policies—and  despite the City’s sovereign \nright to decide its own law enforcement priorities  and strategies—the Trump Administration  has \nsingled out Chicago and other so-called “sanctuary” jurisdictions.   In his first week in office, \nPresident Trump issued Executive Order 13768, which threatened to deny federal grants and take \nenforcement actions against such jurisdictions.   President Trump ordered DHS to publish  weekly \nlists of any municipalities  that refused to comply with immigration  hold requests, together with \nlists of any undocumented immigrants  arrested—but not necessarily convicted—for any non-\nimmigration  offenses.   \n-16- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 17 of 57 PageID #:255\n  \n43.  This executive order was later enjoined in large part—a ruling later affirmed by \nthe Ninth Circuit—for violating  the constitutional  Separation of Powers.  City and County of San \nFrancisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1234-1235  (9th Cir. 2018).  \n44.  From the early days of the Trump Administration,  former Attorney General \nSessions personally  led the charge against so-called “sanctuary” cities and focused special \nattention and ire on Chicago.  Less than two months into his tenure, Attorney General Sessions, \nwithout any factual basis, labeled so-called sanctuary jurisdictions  a “clear and ongoing  threat to \npublic safety.”7  He continued with this rhetoric in subsequent months, asserting that \n“[s]anctuary cities put the lives and well-being  of their residents at risk” and “give sanctuary to \ncriminals,  not to law-abiding  Americans.”8  And over the objection  of career attorneys, he \npersonally pushed the Department of Justice to develop  policies that would target so-called \nsanctuary cities.9  \n45.  Attorney General Sessions singled out Chicago for special opprobrium.   The very \nsame day that Chicago filed suit to challenge the unlawful FY2017 conditions,  Attorney General \nSessions declared that “[t]o a degree perhaps unsurpassed by any other jurisdiction,  the political \nleadership of Chicago has chosen deliberately and intentionally  to adopt a policy that obstructs \n                                              \n7   Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Statement by Attorney General Jeff Sessions on the \nU.S. Immigration  and Customs Enforcement Declined Detainer Outcome Report (Mar. 20, \n2017), http://tinyurl.com/ybrrnf8g. \n8   Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Department of Justice Reviewing Letters from Ten \nPotential Sanctuary Jurisdictions  (July 6, 2017),  http://tinyurl.com/ybdhf7vy.   \n9   See Katie Benner, Justice Dept. Rank-and-File Tell of Discontent Over Sessions’s \nApproach, NY Times (October 19, 2018), https://tinyurl.com/yd6trvzv  (describing one instance \nin which former Attorney General Sessions “directly questioned a career lawyer” at the \nDepartment of Justice who expressed concern about the legal grounds for pursuing  a particular \nanti-sanctuary city policy).    \n-17- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 18 of 57 PageID #:256\n  \nthis country’s lawful immigration  system.” 10  He vowed to deny Chicago grant dollars unless it \ncomplied  with the conditions.11   And he returned to this same theme again and again in speeches \nacross the country.  In remarks in Miami in August 2017, he described Chicago’s “‘sanctuary’ \npolicies” as a “sad example” of a supposed breakdown in the “respect for the rule of law.”12  And \nhe asserted that “requir[ing]”  Chicago to “reorder[] [its] law enforcement practice is exactly the \npoint!” of his policies.13 \n46.  Attorney General Sessions’ public criticism of so-called “sanctuary” cities \ncontinued even in the face of numerous setbacks in federal court.  Even after this Court and \nothers had enjoined his unlawful  attempts to target those jurisdictions,  his preoccupation with \njurisdictions  like Chicago remained unbroken.  In June 2018, he declared that “[s]anctuary \npolicies are terribly wrong” and vowed to “keep fighting”  notwithstanding  lawsuits from \n“sanctuary cities like … Chicago” that challenged the imposition  of conditions  on the Byrne JAG \nprogram.14  A few weeks later, in a speech in California,  Attorney General Sessions even \nsuggested (with no evidence whatsoever) that sanctuary policies may lead to the “release [of] \n                                              \n10   Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Statement by Attorney General Sessions on the City \nof Chicago’s Lawsuit Against the U.S. Department of Justice (Aug. 7, 2017), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/yan8j9ca.   \n11   Id. \n12   Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Attorney General Sessions Delivers Remarks on \nSanctuary Policies (Aug. 16, 2017), https://tinyurl.com/y7tyj3so.   \n13   Id. \n14   Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Attorney General Jeff Sessions Delivers Remarks at \nLackawanna College on Immigration  and Law Enforcement Actions (June 15, 2018), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/yac8f5nz.   \n-18- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 19 of 57 PageID #:257\n  \npedophiles,  rapists, murderers, drug dealers, and arsonists back into the communities  where they \nhad no right to be in the first place.”15   \nB.  Attorney General Sessions Targets The Byrne JAG Program  \n47.  Soon after taking office, Attorney General Sessions began to turn his rhetoric into \naction by targeting the Byrne JAG program.  On July 25, 2017, he claimed that “[s]o-called \n‘sanctuary’ policies  make all of us less safe because they intentionally  undermine our laws and \nprotect illegal  aliens” and announced that he therefore would impose three conditions  on a \ngrantee’s ability  to receive its allotted Byrne JAG funds in order to “encourage these ‘sanctuary’ \njurisdictions  to change their policies.”16    \na.  The “notice” condition:  The FY2017 awards contained a condition  requiring \nthat, “when a local-government  (or local-government-contracted)  correctional \nfacility receives from DHS a formal written request . . . that seeks advance notice \nof the scheduled release date and time for a particular alien in such facility,  then \nsuch facility will  honor such request and—as early as practicable . . . —provide \nthe required notice to DHS.” \nb.  The “access” condition:  The FY2017 awards also contained a condition \nrequiring  that “agents of the United States acting under color of federal law in \nfact are given access [to] a local-government  (or local-government-contracted) \ncorrectional facility  for the purpose of permitting  such agents to meet with \n                                              \n15   Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Attorney General Sessions Delivers Remarks to the \nCriminal  Justice Legal Foundation  (June 26, 2018),  https://tinyurl.com/ydhx7ezm.   \n16   Attorney General Sessions, Statement Announcing  Byrne JAG Conditions  (July 25, \n2017), https://tinyurl.com/y9ttqhsl. \n-19- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 20 of 57 PageID #:258\n  \nindividuals  who are (or are believed by such agents to be) aliens and to inquire as \nto such individuals’  right to be or remain in the United States.”     \nc.  The “Section 1373 compliance” condition: In addition  to the notice and access \nconditions,  the FY2017 awards contained a requirement that the recipient certify \nits compliance with Section 1373.  \n48.  In August 2017, Chicago sought a preliminary  injunction  to prevent Attorney \nGeneral Sessions from imposing  those conditions  on FY2017 Byrne JAG funds, on grounds that \nthe conditions  were unconstitutional,  ultra vires, and arbitrary and capricious.   \n49.  Attorney General Sessions defended the notice and access conditions  by arguing \nthat they were authorized by 34 U.S.C. § 10102(a)(6), which endows an Assistant Attorney \nGeneral with the power to “exercise such other powers and functions as may be vested in the \nAssistant Attorney General pursuant to this chapter or by delegation of the Attorney General, \nincluding  placing special conditions  on all grants.”  He defended the Section 1373 compliance \ncondition  by invoking  34 U.S.C. § 10153(a)(5)(D), which permits the Attorney General to \nrequire a “certification” that “the applicant will comply with all provisions  of this part and all \nother applicable Federal laws.”  He also suggested that all three conditions  were meant to ensure \nthat state and local law enforcement would not impair the law-enforcement activities of the \nfederal government,  including  those federal activities contemplated by 8 U.S.C. §§ 1226(c), \n1231(a)(1)(B), and 1231(a)(4). \n50.  This Court preliminarily  enjoined  the notice and access conditions,  in large part \nbecause Attorney General Sessions “fail[ed] to direct the Court to any textual authority within \nthe Byrne JAG statute itself” allowing  him to impose the notice and access conditions.  City of \nChicago v. Sessions, 264 F. Supp. 3d 933, 941 (N.D. Ill. 2017).  The Court did not preliminarily \n-20- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 21 of 57 PageID #:259\n  \nenjoin the Section 1373 compliance condition.   Attorney General Sessions took an interlocutory \nappeal from the preliminary  injunction  order, and the Seventh Circuit affirmed, unanimously \nholding  that the notice and access conditions were ultra vires and unlawful and that Attorney \nGeneral Sessions’ reading of Section 10102(a)(6) as authorizing  those conditions  was “contrary \nto the plain meaning of the statutory language.”  City of Chicago v. Sessions, 888 F.3d 272, 284 \n(7th Cir. 2018).   \n51.  This Court ultimately  granted summary judgment  in Chicago’s favor on all three \nconditions,  concluding  in July 2018 that each of the notice, access, and Section 1373 compliance \nconditions  was ultra vires and unconstitutional.   See Mem. Op. and Order, City of Chicago v. \nSessions, No. 1:17-cv-05720  (N.D. Ill.), ECF No. 198, at 58 (attached as Ex. A).  On the notice \nand access conditions,  the Court adopted “the same reasons stated in [its] preliminary  injunction \nruling  and the Seventh Circuit’s opinion.”   Id. at 36-37.  On the Section 1373 compliance \ncondition,  the Court concluded that, particularly in light of the Supreme Court’s intervening \ndecision in Murphy v. NCAA, 138 S. Ct. 1461 (2018), Section 1373 violated Tenth Amendment \nanti-commandeering  principles  by tying Chicago’s hands in managing city personnel and city \npolicy.  Id. at 32-34.  Having held Section 1373 unconstitutional,  the Court concluded that the \nAttorney General lacked authority to require compliance with Section 1373 as an “applicable \nfederal law” under the Byrne JAG statute.  Id. at 40. \n52.  This Court’s final judgment  declared each of the notice, access, and Section 1373 \ncompliance conditions  ultra vires and a violation  of the constitutional  principle  of separation of \npowers and set the conditions  aside under the Administrative  Procedure Act as unlawful.  See \nFinal Judgment and Order, City of Chicago v. Sessions, No. 1:17-cv-05720  (N.D. Ill.), ECF No. \n211, at 2 (attached as Ex. B).  It also permanently enjoined the Attorney General from “denying \n-21- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 22 of 57 PageID #:260\n  \nor delaying  issuance of any FY 2017 Byrne JAG award insofar as that denial or delay” was \nbased on the notice, access, or compliance condition,  and prohibited  the Attorney General from \n“using the Conditions  in any FY 2017 Byrne JAG award document, delaying the processing or \napproval of a recipient’s requests to draw upon the FY 2017 Byrne JAG funds based on the \nConditions,  and enforcing the Conditions  against FY 2017 Byrne JAG recipients, regardless of \nwhether those Conditions  appeared in FY 2017 Byrne JAG award documents.”  Id. at 3.    \n53.  During the remedy phase, Chicago expressed concern that the FY2018 Byrne \nJAG grant would contain the same provisions  and asked the Court to issue an injunction \ncovering future grant awards.  The Court declined to do so but warned that attorney’s fees would \nlikely  be appropriate if the Attorney General once again forced Chicago to sue to prevent \nimposition  of the same unlawful conditions. \nC.  The Justice Department Expresses Concern That Chicago Does Not Comply \nWith Section 1373 But Refuses To Make A Final Determination \n54.  Because this Court determined that Section 1373 was unconstitutional  and thus \nthat the Section 1373 compliance condition  was not authorized in the first place, it did not take \nup the question whether Chicago actually complies with Section 1373.  But Chicago has always \nmaintained that it does comply.   \n55.  The Justice Department began requiring Byrne JAG grantees to certify \ncompliance with Section 1373 in FY2016, and Chicago did so at that time.  In a May 2016 report \nby the Department of Justice’s Office of Inspector General, the Department suggested that the \nWelcoming  City Ordinance, which prohibits  City employees from sharing immigration  status \ninformation  with federal agents unless “otherwise provided under applicable  federal law,” \nChicago Municipal  Code § 2-173-030,  contains “a potential ambiguity”  as to its “proper \nconstruction” such that the “saving clause” contained in the Ordinance might be unclear.   \n-22- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 23 of 57 PageID #:261\n  \n56.  Since that report, Chicago has exchanged multiple  letters with the Department of \nJustice concerning Chicago’s compliance with Section 1373.  On April 21, 2017, the Department \nsent letters to Chicago and eight other jurisdictions,  informing  Chicago that it was “required to \nsubmit documentation … that validates that your jurisdiction  is in compliance with 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1373.”  Chicago responded in July 2017, explaining  that the Ordinance’s “saving clause” in \nfact “makes clear than an individual’s  citizenship  or immigration  status information  will  not be \nkept confidential  if federal law provides otherwise.”  In October 2017, the Department of Justice \nsent another letter, stating among other things that it had “determined that [Chicago] appears to \nhave laws, policies,  or practices that violate 8 U.S.C. § 1373.”  The letter was based on the \npremise that Section 1373 applies not only to the sharing of “information  regarding immigration \nstatus,” but also information  “regarding a person’s custody status or release date.”   Chicago sent \nanother response, disagreeing with the Department’s interpretation  of the relevant statutory text, \nbut reporting that, “[i]n the interest of resolving  this issue,” it had sent written notice to City \ndepartment heads “instructing  them to share with their officers and employees Chicago’s \ninterpretation  of the [Welcoming  City Ordinance] and explanation  of its compliance with Section \n1373.”  See Letter from Edward Siskel,  Corporation Counsel, City of Chicago, to Alan R. \nHanson, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Dep’t of Justice \n(October 27, 2017) (attached as Ex. C).  \n57.  The Department of Justice nevertheless sent Chicago another letter in January \n2018, announcing that “the Department remains concerned that your jurisdiction’s  laws, policies, \nor practices may violate section 1373, or, at a minimum,  that they may be interpreted or applied \nin a manner consistent with section 1373.”  The letter requested that Chicago produce “[a]ll \ndocuments reflecting any orders, directives, instructions,  or guidance to your law enforcement \n-23- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 24 of 57 PageID #:262\n  \nemployees …, that were distributed,  produced, and/or in effect during the relevant timeframe, \nregarding whether and how these employees may, or may not, communicate” with federal \nagents.  Chicago timely responded to the Department’s request on February 23, 2018 by \nvoluntarily  providing  the Department with copies of responsive documents.  In the spirit of \ntransparency, Chicago accompanied that response with an expedited FOIA request for \ndocuments related to the Department’s interpretation  of Section 1373.   \n58.  To date, Chicago has neither received a final determination  of compliance with \nSection 1373 nor any documents in response to its FOIA request.   \nD.  The Trump Administration Adopts Controversial Immigration Enforcement \nStrategies That Prompt Public Criticism From Local Officials, Including In \nChicago \n59.  Beyond the Byrne JAG program, the Trump Administration  has adopted \naggressive immigration  enforcement tactics that target noncitizens  in so-called “sanctuary” \njurisdictions.    \n60.  One especially controversial  strategy deployed by the Trump Administration \ninvolves  targeting noncitizens  inside courthouses, including  noncitizens  on official business at \nthe courthouse, to seek a protective order, testify as a witness, or other reasons.17  The prior \nAdministration  had allowed limited  immigration  enforcement at courthouses for noncitizens \nfitting within  certain “enforcement priorities,”  such as threats to national security, public  safety, \n                                              \n17   E.g., Steve Coll, When a Day in Court Is a Trap for Immigrants, THE NEW YORKER \n(Nov. 8, 2017), https://tinyurl.com/ybv355d3;  see also, e.g., Brittany Mejia and Jazmine Ulloa, \nICE arrests in courtrooms escalate feud between California and Trump administration over \nimmigration policy, L.A.

The Trump Administration  has expressly linked  this strategy of targeting people \nin courthouses to its disagreement with Chicago’s Welcoming  City ordinance and other similar \nlocal policies.  According to ICE, “courthouse arrests seem to be occurring more frequently” \nbecause “some law enforcement agencies no longer honor ICE detainers or limit  ICE’s access to \ntheir detention facilities.”20   \n62.  The Trump Administration  has targeted other sensitive locations as well, arresting \nnoncitizens  as they drop their children off for school or as they leave a hospital.21  Although  the \nAdministration’s  policy  purportedly is to “generally . . . avoid[]” taking enforcement actions at \nschools, medical facilities,  places of worship, religious  ceremonies, or public  demonstrations, \nICE expressly permits such enforcement actions under certain circumstances.22  \n                                              \n18   U.S. Immigration  and Customs Enforcement, Fact Sheet: Frequently Asked Questions - \nExisting Guidance on Enforcement Actions at or Focused on Sensitive Locations (July 15, 2016), \nhttps://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/07/15/fact-sheet-frequently-asked-questions-existing-guidance-\nenforcement-actions-or. \n19   See U.S. Immigration  and Customs Enforcement, FAQ on Sensitive Locations and \nCourthouse Arrests, https://www.ice.gov/ero/enforcement/sensitive-loc. \n20   Id.; see also id.

Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has stated unequivocally  that it is City policy not \nto permit ICE to enforce federal immigration  law in Chicago schools.23  It is essential to the \nvalues embodied in the Welcoming  City Ordinance that Chicago and its officials remain free to \nspeak out publicly  and forcefully against attempts by the Trump Administration  to arrest \nnoncitizens  at sensitive locations,  including  courthouses, schools, medical facilities,  places of \nworship, religious  ceremonies, and public  demonstrations.  The Board President of Cook County \n(which is a Byrne JAG sub-grantee of Chicago) has also issued a formal proclamation \nspecifically  opposing  ICE’s courthouse arrests after a resident who has previously  received \nprotection from immigration  enforcement activity under the Deferred Action for Childhood \nArrivals (DACA) program was wrongfully  detained in the Cook County courthouse in Skokie \nafter appearing for a minor traffic violation.24   Chicago and its subgrantees will continue to speak \nout against wrong-headed immigration  enforcement strategies that sow fear and chaos in local \ncourthouses, schools, hospitals, and places of worship. \nE.  The Trump Administration Advances A Radical New Interpretation Of 8 \nU.S.C. § 1324 \n64.  While the litigation  over the FY2017 conditions  on the Byrne JAG Program was \npending,  the Trump Administration  sought to weaponize another provision  of the U.S. Code \nagainst jurisdictions  seeking to prioritize  local law enforcement over enforcement of civil \nimmigration  law. \n                                              \n23   See Press Conference (September 6, 2017), \nhttps://livestream.com/chicagosmayor/press/videos/162377651  (“ICE will not go to our \nschools.”).   \n24   Carrie Frillman,  Cook Co.

During a January 4, 2018, interview on Fox News, then-Acting Director of U.S. \nImmigrations  and Customs Enforcement Thomas Homan said that he had asked the Department \nof Justice to “[l]ook into criminal  charges for elected officials with sanctuary policies,  as they are \nharboring illegal  aliens, according to 8 U.S.C. § 1324.”  Kirstjen Nielsen, the Secretary of \nHomeland Security, confirmed during testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on \nJanuary 16, 2018, that “the Department of Justice is reviewing what avenues may be available” \nto charge elected officials in so-called sanctuary jurisdictions.   \n66.  In the nearly seventy years since 8 U.S.C. § 1324 was enacted, the federal \ngovernment has never attempted to prosecute an elected official acting in their official capacity \nfor violation  of that statute.  For much of this time, cities such as Chicago declined to participate \nin federal immigration  enforcement without any indication  that doing so violated any criminal \nstatute.  This attempt by the Trump Administration  to criminalize  the policy choices of local \ngovernments represents a significant  threat to the ability  of cities such as Chicago to enact \npolicies intended to foster public safety. \nF.  Attorney General Sessions Seeks To Impose The Same Unlawful Conditions \n(Plus Two New Ones) On FY2018 Byrne JAG Grants  \n67.  Notwithstanding  over a year of litigation  before this Court and this Court’s clear \nrulings invalidating  its approach, the Department of Justice’s FY2018 Byrne JAG Local \nSolicitation  and required certifications (attached as Exs. F-I) reflect Attorney General Sessions’ \ndecision to re-impose the FY2017 notice, access, and 1373 conditions,  as well as several new \nconditions  similarly  designed to impress state and local officers into the service of federal \nimmigration-enforcement  priorities.   Those conditions  are described in further detail below. \n68.  Chicago submitted an application  for FY2018 Byrne JAG funding,  but refused to \ncertify it would comply with the unlawful  conditions. \n-27- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 28 of 57 PageID #:266\n  \n69.  Attorney General Sessions began issuing  FY2018 Byrne JAG grants in early \nOctober 2018.  The conditions  announced in the FY2018 Local Solicitation  appeared in FY2018 \nByrne JAG award letters issued at this time.  \n70.  By October 12, 2018, the Department had issued 752 FY2018 local awards, \ntotaling  almost $59 million—representing  70% of the local funding  available for FY2018 and \nover 65% of the eligible  jurisdictions.   But Chicago still  had not received notification  of its \nFY2018 award or of when it might expect to receive its award.  Chicago therefore commenced \nthis action in an attempt to obtain the FY2018 Byrne JAG grant to which it is entitled.  \nG.  Attorney General Sessions Resigns And The President Unlawfully Directs \nMatthew Whitaker To Act As Attorney General \n71.  Meanwhile, on November 7, 2018, Attorney General Sessions resigned at the \nrequest of the President.   \n72.  Federal law directs that upon the Attorney General’s resignation the Deputy \nAttorney General is empowered to “exercise all the duties” of the office of the Attorney General.  \n5 U.S.C. § 508.  Federal law further provides for other high-ranking,  Senate-confirmed Justice \nDepartment officials to exercise such duties should the Deputy Attorney General be unavailable \nto do so.   \n73.  Notwithstanding  the clear requirements of federal law, the President directed Mr. \nWhitaker, Attorney General Sessions’ chief of staff, to act as the Attorney General.  The \nAttorney General’s chief of staff is not in the statutory line of succession.  \n74.   Nor was Mr. Whitaker appointed to his role as Attorney General Sessions’ chief \nof staff with the advice and consent of the Senate.  The Appointments Clause of the U.S. \nConstitution  requires that the appointment  of principal  officers of the United States, such as the \nAttorney General, be with the advice and consent of the Senate.   \n-28- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 29 of 57 PageID #:267\n  \n75.  There are no fewer than seven Department of Justice officials,  including  Deputy \nAttorney General Rosenstein and Solicitor  General Noel Francisco, who were nominated by \nPresident Trump and appointed pursuant to the Appointments  Clause to offices in the statutory \nline of succession for the office of the Attorney General.  Numerous other officials currently \nserving in the Department of Justice have also been confirmed to their roles by the Senate.  The \nPresident has not explained why none of these constitutionally  appointed officers could fulfil  the \nduties of the Attorney General.  Nor has he claimed any exigency that would justify  even \ntemporarily  installing  an unconfirmed  Department of Justice employee into a cabinet-level \nposition. \nH.  The Department Imposes Unlawful Conditions On Chicago’s FY2018 Byrne \nJAG Award \n76.  On November 20, 2018—more than a month after Chicago commenced this \naction, and almost two weeks into Mr. Whitaker’s supposed tenure as Acting Attorney \nGeneral—Chicago received notification  of its FY2018 Byrne JAG grant award. \n77.  The notification  confusingly  states that it was issued “[o]n behalf of Attorney \nGeneral Jefferson Sessions III,” who had resigned thirteen days before the notification  was sent.   \n78.  Four of the immigration-related  conditions  contained in Chicago’s FY2018 award \nare materially  identical to the FY2017 Byrne JAG conditions  this Court has already held \nunlawful and set aside.  On that basis alone, the Attorney General—whoever that may be—is \nprecluded from defending the conditions.    \n79.  The Department of Justice—under the direction of Attorney General Sessions—\nannounced on November 3, 2018 that it would not “use or enforce” those repeat conditions,  but \nreserved the right to do so “[i]f the posture of the pending litigation  changes (or if the pending \nlitigation  is resolved) in a manner such that DOJ decides to use or enforce any or all of [the \n-29- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 30 of 57 PageID #:268\n  \nrepeat conditions].”   Special Notice Re: FY 2018 Byrne JAG award conditions  41-43 and 45-47 \n(attached as Ex. E).  This reservation of the right to impose the illegal  conditions  means that, \ndespite this Court’s extremely clear admonition  that the Attorney General should not reimpose \nthose very conditions,  Chicago did not obtain its FY2018 Byrne JAG award when other \njurisdictions  did and cannot obtain those funds free and clear.  Accordingly,  Chicago was forced \nto sue again on the same conditions  and should receive its attorney’s fees and costs for having to \ndo so. \n80.  The repeated conditions  are, as mentioned,  materially identical  to those already \nenjoined and held unlawful by this Court: \n81.  The “Section 1373 compliance condition”:  Chicago’s FY2018 award requires \nthat the “program or activity” funded under Chicago’s Byrne JAG award comply with 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1373(a) and (b) and that the Chief Legal Officer of the recipient execute a certification \n(attached as Ex. F) declaring the “program or activity” in compliance with those provisions.   Ex. \nD ¶¶ 41-42.  This condition  is materially identical  to the FY2017 Section 1373 compliance \ncondition. \n82.  The “Section 1644 compliance condition”:  Chicago’s FY2018 award requires \nthat the “program or activity” funded under Chicago’s Byrne JAG award comply with 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1644 and that the Chief Legal Officer of the recipient execute a certification declaring the \n“program or activity” in compliance with that provision  (attached as Ex. F).  Ex. D ¶¶ 41-42.  \nThis condition  is materially identical  to the FY2017 Section 1644 compliance condition,  because \n8 U.S.C. § 1644 proscribes the exact same conduct as 8 U.S.C. § 1373. \n83.  The “FY2018 notice condition”:  Chicago’s FY2018 award requires Chicago to \n“provide—as early as practicable … —advance notice to [federal immigration  officials] of the \n-30- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 31 of 57 PageID #:269\n  \nscheduled release date and time for a particular alien, if a State or local government (or \ngovernment-contracted) correctional facility receives from [a federal immigration  authority] a \nformal written request pursuant to the INA that seeks such advance notice.”  Ex. D ¶ 46.  The \nconduct required by this condition  is identical  to the conduct Attorney General Sessions \nattempted to require with the FY2017 notice condition.   \n84.  The “FY2018 access condition”:  Chicago’s FY2018 award requires Chicago to \npermit “access to any State or local government (or government-contracted) correctional facility \nby such agents for the purpose [of] ‘interrogat[ing]  any alien or person believed to be an alien as \nto his [or her] right to be or to remain in the United States.’”  Ex. D ¶ 45.  The conduct required \nby this condition  is identical  to the conduct Attorney General Sessions attempted to require with \nthe FY2017 access condition.  \n85.  In addition  to these revived conditions,  Chicago’s FY2018 Byrne JAG award \ncontains a new unlawful condition,  and an additional  mandatory certification,  each of which is \nintended to deny funds to cities like Chicago that seek nothing  more than to exercise their right \nto opt out of participation  in federal immigration  enforcement.   \n86.   The “harboring” condition: Chicago’s FY2018 Byrne JAG award prohibits \nChicago from “direct[ly] or indirect[ly]”  attempting to “conceal, harbor, or shield from \ndetection” any undocumented immigrant  by publicly  disclosing  federal law enforcement \ninformation,  even where doing so would not violate any statute.  Ex. D ¶ 44.  The award letter \nattempts to justify this condition  as being “[c]onsistent with the purposes and objectives of \nfederal law enforcement statutes and federal criminal  law.”  As written, this condition  would \nappear to prohibit  Chicago and its subgrantees from publicly  criticizing  ICE enforcement \nstrategies that involve targeting City residents at courthouses, schools, and other sensitive \n-31- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 32 of 57 PageID #:270\n  \nlocations,  in violation  of the City’s stated policies and in contravention of the spirit of the \nWelcoming  City Ordinance and fundamental principles  of decency and public order.  The \ncondition  also would require Chicago to monitor its subgrantees to ensure their compliance with \nthis condition.   Ex. D ¶ 44(2). \n87.  The “additional certification” condition:  In addition to certifying compliance \nwith Section 1373 and 1644, the FY2018 Byrne JAG Local Solicitation  requires the Chief Legal \nOfficer of a FY2018 Byrne JAG applicant to execute a “Certification  Relating to 8 U.S.C. \n§§ 1226(a) & (c), 1231 (a), 1324(a), 1357(a), & 1366(1) & (3)” (attached as Ex. G).  The Chief \nExecutive Officer, in turn, is required to execute “Certifications  and Assurances by the Chief \nExecutive of the Applicant Government” (attached as Ex. H) that adopts this certification by the \nChief Legal Officer.  Ex. D ¶ 61.  The Chief Legal Officer certification represents that “neither \nthe jurisdiction  nor any entity, agency, or official of the jurisdiction  has in effect, purports to \nhave in effect, or is subject to or bound by, any law, rule, policy,  or practice that would apply to \nthe ‘program or activity’ to be funded … that would or does—(a) impede the exercise by federal \nofficers of authority under 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a); or (b) impede the exercise by federal officers of \nauthority relating to 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a) or (c), 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a), or 8 U.S.C. § 1366(1) or (3).”  \nEx. G.  As with the repeat conditions,  the Attorney General has temporarily withdrawn this \ncondition,  but reserved the right to reimpose it “[i]f the posture of the pending litigation  changes \n(or if the pending litigation  is resolved) in a manner such that DOJ decides to use or enforce any \nor all of [the repeat conditions].”  Ex. E.  \n88.  These conditions  have no legal basis.  Moreover, all the conditions  are invalid \nbecause Mr. Whitaker lacked the authority to serve as Acting Attorney General when he imposed \nthe conditions  on Chicago.     \n-32- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 33 of 57 PageID #:271\n  \nIV.  THE UNLAWFUL NEW CONDITIONS HAVE INJURED AND CONTINUE TO \nINJURE CHICAGO \n89.  By imposing  the unlawful conditions  on the Byrne JAG program, Attorney \nGeneral Sessions sought to pressure cities into abandoning  their longstanding  public  safety \npriorities,  on pain of losing  critical formula grant funds that would otherwise support officer \nsafety, community  empowerment, and innovative  countermeasures in the fight against gun \nviolence. \n90.  The Department of Justice under purported acting Attorney General Whitaker has \ncontinued this strategy, including  by seeking to impose unlawful conditions  on Chicago’s \nFY2018 Byrne JAG grant award.   \n91.  The imposition  of these unlawful conditions  through the Byrne JAG program \ninjures Chicago by hindering  the City’s sovereign ability  to develop and deploy effective \npolicing  policy without regard to the constraints imposed by the conditions.   In addition,  the \nconditions  injure Chicago in myriad specific ways set forth below.      \n92.  The Department’s delay in issuing Chicago its FY2018 award deprived Chicago \nand its sub-grantees of access to critically  needed law enforcement funding and forced Chicago \nto file this lawsuit to obtain its funding.  And, by continuing  to reserve the right to reimpose the \nconditions  already held unlawful and by insisting  that Chicago acquiesce in an equally unlawful \n“harboring” condition,  the Department continues to threaten Chicago and its sub-grantees with \nthe loss of the award that was issued only as a result of this lawsuit.  Finally,  by forcing Chicago \nto sue to force the Department even to issue an award letter and temporarily withdraw the repeat \nunlawful conditions,  the Department has demonstrated that it will continue to subject Chicago to \nsuch delays and deprivations  in subsequent years unless this Court orders otherwise.    \n-33- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 34 of 57 PageID #:272\n  \n93.  Although the Department has declared that it will not “use or enforce” the \nunlawful FY2018 conditions  carried over from FY2017, it has reserved the right to impose them \nat some unspecified point in the future.  The voluntary and assertedly temporary decision not to \nenforce the repeat conditions  does not redress Chicago’s injury.   So long as the Attorney General \nreserves the right to impose these conditions,  Chicago is in danger of the harms described below.  \n94.  To date, the Department has refused to finally determine whether Chicago \ncomplies with Section 1373 (and therefore also Section 1644).  Instead, it has expressed a vague \nconcern that Chicago has some heretofore unidentified  policy that contradicts its official \ninterpretation  of the Welcoming  City Ordinance and put forth an unprincipled  and overbroad \ndefinition  of “immigration  status information”  that encompasses a detainee’s custody status and \nrelease date.  Despite refusing to provide clear guidance on what Sections 1373 and 1644 \nrequire, the Department continues to insist that Byrne JAG applicants’ chief legal and executive \nofficers execute certifications—under  express penalty of “criminal  prosecution,” or “civil \npenalties and administrative  remedies for false claims”—that their jurisdictions  comply with \nSections 1373 and 1644.  This uncertainty has clouded the City’s ability  to apply for funds.   \n95.  The uncertainty regarding the Department’s interpretation  of Section 1373 and \n1644 also has given rise to a fear of prosecution or other adverse legal action.  In the first week \nfollowing  his inauguration,  President Trump ordered the Attorney General to take “appropriate \nenforcement action against any entity that violates [Section] 1373,” Executive Order No. 13,768 \n§ 9(a), which Attorney General Sessions interpreted to mean filing  civil preemption actions \nagainst jurisdictions  he believes violate Section 1373.  See Opp. Mot. Prelim. Inj., Richmond v. \nTrump, No. 3:17-cv-01535  (N.D. Cal.), ECF No. 16, at 8-9, 22.  Carrying out that threat, the \nDepartment of Justice sued the State of California based in part on Section 1373 to try to force \n-34- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 35 of 57 PageID #:273\n  \nCalifornia  to abandon its immigration-related  policies.  See United States v. State of California, \nNo. 2:18-cv-00490  (E.D. Cal.).  Chicago reasonably believes that the Department may pursue \nsimilar enforcement litigation  against Chicago.   \n96.  The additional  certification requirement poses the same problems.  While Chicago \nis confident that it does not “impede” the federal government’s exercise of authority under 8 \nU.S.C. §§ 1226(a) or (c), 1231(a)(4), 1357(a) or 1366(1) or (3), it has well-founded  concerns, \nbased on the Trump Administration’s  history of targeting Chicago, that the Administration  may \nput forth a new, broad interpretation of those provisions,  designed to ensnare Chicago or its \nofficials in a dispute over the validity  of those certifications.  \n97.  The new “harboring” condition  also threatens to chill the speech of City officials \nwho disagree with the federal government’s controversial immigration  enforcement strategies, \nsuch as targeting noncitizens  at courthouses, schools, hospitals,  or places of worship in so-called \n“sanctuary” jurisdictions.   The City and its sub-grantees have publicly  criticized  such practices in \nthe past and will publicly  criticize them again in the future.  But Chicago has well-founded \nconcerns that the Department will consider such criticism a violation  of the Department’s vague \nprohibition  on “direct[ly] or indirect[ly]” attempting to “conceal, harbor, or shield from \ndetection” any undocumented noncitizens  by publicly  disclosing  federal law enforcement \ninformation.   And those concerns are heightened by the suggestions from the former Acting \nDirector of ICE and the current Secretary of Homeland Security that the Administration  is \nconsidering  criminally prosecuting elected officials in so-called sanctuary jurisdictions  on the \ntheory that Welcoming  City-style policies violate the federal anti-harboring  statute, 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1324.  This unauthorized  attempt to silence City officials from commenting  on the affairs of \n-35- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 36 of 57 PageID #:274\n  \ncourthouses, schools, hospitals, and public spaces within the City strikes directly at the City’s \nright to self-government. \n98.  More fundamentally,  complying  with the FY2018 conditions  would undermine \npublic safety in Chicago.  The Welcoming City Ordinance assists effective policing  by building \ntrust between law enforcement officers and the immigrant  community.  Conversely, policing \nsuffers when members of that community,  whatever their immigration  status, do not feel free to \nreport crimes, assist in investigations,  or testify as witnesses.  Purported acting Attorney General \nMr. Whitaker’s insistence that Chicago abandon its existing policies,  that Chicago give \nimmigration  enforcement agents on-demand access to its detention facilities to investigate \npotential civil  immigration  violations,  and that Chicago detain individuals  solely so that they can \nbe investigated for possible civil  immigration  violations  would undermine crucial public trust, \ncut local law enforcement efforts off at the knees, and make everyone in Chicago less safe.   \n99.  Chicago now faces the prospect of a severe federal incursion on its sovereignty.  \nChicago could abandon its attempts to preserve the policymaking  autonomy afforded it under our \nfederal system, in hopes that the Attorney General award Chicago the funds promised it by \nCongress.  Given the dogged refusal to award Chicago funds to which it has a plain statutory \nentitlement,  even such a dramatic reversal may not bring Chicago the law enforcement funds it \nneeds.  Or Chicago could continue its decades-long focus on policies that further the best \ninterests of its residents and officers but lose out on funds it has long used to fund critical law-\nenforcement needs.  The use of the federal government’s coercive power in this manner causes a \ndeep and irreparable injury  to Chicago’s sovereignty, and to our federal system.  \n100.  Moreover, whichever decision Chicago ultimately  makes, its residents and police \nforce will be immediately  and irreparably harmed.  If Chicago accepts the unlawful conditions,  it \n-36- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 37 of 57 PageID #:275\n  \nwill forfeit decades’ worth of trust and goodwill  that its police force has built  in the communities \nit serves.  And as those decades of experience show, that kind of trust, once lost, is lost forever.  \nAlternatively,  if Chicago asserts its right to determine its own policy and refuses to certify \ncompliance with the Department’s new and unlawful conditions,  it (and the eleven other \njurisdictions  that depend on Chicago’s application  for their Byrne JAG funds) will forever forfeit \nthe FY2018 Byrne JAG grant monies—monies  that are critical to Chicago’s community  policing \noperation and that purchase essential and life-saving  equipment for Chicago and its neighboring \njurisdictions.   Even if Chicago and its neighbors could later obtain those funds, the damage \nwould have already been done in the months or years their police forces and residents will have \nspent without crucial equipment and services. \nV.  THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS NOW PRECLUDED FROM DEFENDING \nMOST OF THE FY2018 BYRNE JAG CONDITIONS \n101.  The Attorney General is precluded from relitigating  claims and issues resolved in \nthe FY2017 litigation  brought by Chicago—namely,  the legality  of the Section 1373 compliance, \nSection 1644 compliance,  notice, and access conditions on the Byrne JAG program—with  regard \nto the FY2018 Byrne JAG awards or any future Byrne JAG awards.  All of the legal \nrequirements for preclusion  are met here. \n102.  The FY2018 versions of those conditions  are materially identical  to the FY2017 \nversions this Court has already enjoined as unlawful.  The FY2018 Section 1373 and Section \n1644 compliance conditions  are no different than the FY2017 Section 1373 condition,  because \nSection 1644 proscribes the same conduct as Section 1373.  And the FY2018 notice and access \nconditions,  though framed slightly  differently,  require the same conduct as the FY2017 notice \nand access conditions—providing  48 hours’ advance notice to federal immigration  authorities of \nthe scheduled release date and time of identified  individuals  and allowing  federal officials on-\n-37- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 38 of 57 PageID #:276\n  \ndemand access to individuals  in Chicago’s custody for purposes of immigration-related \ninterrogation. \n103.  The validity  of the FY2017 Section 1373, notice, and access conditions was not \njust actually litigated  in a prior lawsuit—it  was the central issue in the FY2017 litigation.   \n104.  This Court’s final judgment  critically  depended upon its determination  that the \nFY2017 Section 1373, notice, and access conditions were unlawful.  That order set aside each of \nthe three FY2017 conditions  based on this Court’s conclusion  the Attorney General could not \nlawfully  impose any of those conditions.    \n105.  Finally,  the Attorney General was fully  represented in the FY2017 litigation  by \ncapable lawyers from the Department of Justice.   \nCOUNT ONE:  VIOLATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706 (ULTRA VIRES) \n106.  Chicago incorporates by reference the allegations  of the preceding paragraphs. \n107.  The Department of Justice may exercise only authority conferred by statute.  See \nCity of Arlington, Tex. v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 297 (2013); see also 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C).  \nA.  The FY2018 Notice And Access Conditions Are Ultra Vires \n108.  Notwithstanding  this Court’s order setting aside the materially identical  FY2017 \nnotice and access conditions,  Attorney General Sessions sought to impose FY2018 conditions \nrequiring  identical conduct.  Purported acting Attorney General Whitaker has continued this \npolicy. \n109.  The Court’s prior determination  that the notice and access conditions are \nunlawful,  in a lawsuit involving  the same parties and the same underlying  federal grant program, \nis conclusive here.  The Attorney General is therefore precluded from relitigating  the lawfulness \nof the notice and access conditions. \n-38- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 39 of 57 PageID #:277\n  \n110.  Even as an initial  matter, the Attorney General lacks statutory authority to \ncondition  Byrne JAG funds on the FY2018 notice and access conditions.  Indeed, such authority \nis at odds with the text, structure, and purpose of the Byrne JAG statute, as this Court and the \nSeventh Circuit have held.   The FY2018 notice and access conditions cannot stand. \n111.  As a direct and proximate result of those unlawful conditions,  Chicago will be \nforced to accept unlawful and unconstitutional  grant conditions  or forgo Byrne JAG funds and \nshut down the programs they support.    \n112.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Chicago is entitled to a \ndeclaration that the Attorney General is without authority to impose the FY2018 notice and \naccess conditions on Byrne JAG funds (or materially  identical conditions  in future grant years), \nan order that those conditions  be set aside, and an injunction  preventing those conditions  from \ngoing into effect. \n113.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1361 and 1651, Chicago is entitled to a writ of \nmandamus compelling  the Attorney General to issue and fund Chicago’s FY2018 Byrne JAG \naward as contemplated by the Byrne JAG statute (i.e., without the FY2018 notice or access \nconditions).   \n114.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A), Chicago is entitled to an award of its \ncosts, attorney’s fees, and expenses associated with this litigation.   The attempt to impose the \nFY2018 notice and access conditions on Chicago is not substantially  justified  given this Court’s \norder setting aside materially identical  conditions  Attorney General Sessions attempted to \nimpose on FY2017 Byrne JAG funds.   \n115.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412(b), Chicago is entitled to an award of its costs, \nattorney’s fees, and expenses associated with this litigation.   The attempt to impose the FY2018 \n-39- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 40 of 57 PageID #:278\n  \nnotice and access conditions on Chicago notwithstanding  this Court’s order setting aside \nmaterially  identical conditions  from FY2017 demonstrates bad faith and an attempt to undermine \nor avoid this Court’s permanent injunction  in Chicago’s FY2017 suit. \nB.  The Section 1373 And Section 1644 Compliance Conditions Are Ultra Vires \n116.  The Court’s prior determination  that the Section 1373 compliance condition  is \nunlawful,  in a lawsuit involving  the same parties and the same underlying  federal grant program, \nis conclusive here as to both the Section 1373 compliance condition  and the substantively \nidentical Section 1644 compliance condition.   The Attorney General is therefore precluded from \nrelitigating  the lawfulness of the notice and access conditions. \n117.  The Attorney General lacks statutory authority to condition  Byrne JAG funds on \ncompliance with Section 1373 or Section 1644.  The Byrne JAG statute’s requirement that \ngrantees comply with “all other applicable Federal laws” does not confer authority to condition \nByrne JAG funding on Section 1373 or Section 1644 compliance,  because neither provision  is an \n“applicable”  law here.  The phrase “all other applicable Federal laws” in the Byrne JAG statute \nrefers to the host of laws that regulate the conduct of federal grant recipients as grant recipients.  \nIt does not refer to every section of the U.S. Code that could possibly  apply to a state or local \ngovernment.  Neither Section 1373 nor Section 1644 regulate grantees as grantees nor do its \nterms mention federal grants or funds.   \n118.  Moreover, and as this Court already held with respect to a substantively identical \ncondition  in the FY2017 Byrne JAG grant, Section 1373 and Section 1644 are facially \nunconstitutional  because they seek to commandeer state and local officials into the service of \nfederal immigration-enforcement  authorities.  Because those laws are facially unconstitutional, \nthey are not “applicable  laws” available for incorporation  into the Byrne JAG program.  \n-40- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 41 of 57 PageID #:279\n  \n119.  The Section 1373 and Section 1644 compliance conditions  on the FY2018 Byrne \nJAG grant cannot stand.   \n120.  As a direct and proximate result of these unlawful conditions,  Chicago will be \nforced to accept unlawful and unconstitutional  grant conditions  or forgo Byrne JAG funds and \nshut down the programs they support.    \n121.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Chicago is entitled to a \ndeclaration that the Attorney General is without authority to impose the FY 2018 Section 1373 \nand Section 1644 conditions  on Byrne JAG funds (or materially identical  conditions  in future \ngrant years), an order that those conditions  be set aside, and an injunction  preventing those \nconditions  from going into effect. \n122.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1361 and 1651, Chicago is entitled to a writ of \nmandamus compelling  the Attorney General to issue and fund Chicago’s FY2018 Byrne JAG \naward as contemplated by the Byrne JAG statute (i.e., without the FY2018 Section 1373 or \nSection 1644 conditions).   \n123.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A), Chicago is entitled to an award of its \ncosts, attorney’s fees, and expenses associated with this litigation.   The attempt to impose the \nFY2018 Section 1373 compliance and Section 1644 compliance conditions  on Chicago is not \nsubstantially  justified given this Court’s order setting aside materially  identical conditions \nAttorney General Sessions attempted to impose on FY2017 Byrne JAG funds.   \n124.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412(b), Chicago is entitled to an award of its costs, \nattorney’s fees, and expenses associated with this litigation.   The attempt to impose the FY2018 \nSection 1373 compliance and Section 1644 compliance conditions  on Chicago notwithstanding \nthis Court’s order setting aside materially identical  conditions  from FY2017 demonstrates bad \n-41- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 42 of 57 PageID #:280\n  \nfaith and an attempt to undermine or avoid this Court’s permanent injunction  in Chicago’s \nFY2017 suit. \nC.  The Harboring Condition Is Ultra Vires \n125.  The Attorney General also lacks statutory authority to condition  FY2018 Byrne \nJAG funding  on a commitment not to conceal, harbor, or shield from detection undocumented \nimmigrants  by disclosing  federal law enforcement information.    \n126.  The Byrne JAG statute allows the Attorney General to require a certification of \ncompliance only with applicable laws.  The harboring condition  specifically  states that it applies \neven where disclosure of information  would not violate federal anti-harboring  laws.    \n127.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201,  Chicago is entitled to a \ndeclaration that Attorney General is without authority to impose the harboring condition  on \nFY2018 Byrne JAG funds (or materially identical  conditions  in future grant years), an order that \nthat condition  be set aside, and an injunction  preventing that condition  from going into effect. \n128.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1361 and 1651, Chicago is entitled to a writ of \nmandamus compelling  the Attorney General to issue and fund Chicago’s FY2018 Byrne JAG \naward as contemplated by the Byrne JAG statute (i.e., without the harboring condition).   \n129.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A), Chicago is entitled to an award of its \ncosts, attorney’s fees, and expenses associated with this litigation.   The attempt to impose the \nharboring condition  on Chicago is not substantially  justified  given that this Court has already \nheld that the Attorney General lacks the authority to impose this sort of policy condition  on \nByrne JAG funds.     \n130.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412(b), Chicago is entitled to an award of its costs, \nattorney’s fees, and expenses associated with this litigation.   The attempt to impose the harboring \ncondition  on Chicago notwithstanding  this Court’s holding  that the Attorney General lacks the \n-42- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 43 of 57 PageID #:281\n  \nauthority to impose this sort of policy  condition  on Byrne JAG funds demonstrates bad faith and \nan attempt to undermine or avoid this Court’s permanent injunction  in Chicago’s FY2017 suit. \nD.  The Additional Certification Requirement Is Ultra Vires \n131.  The Attorney General also lacks statutory authority to condition  Byrne JAG funds \non a certification that the applicant has no law that “impedes” the federal government’s exercise \nof authority under 8 U.S.C. §§ 1226(a) & (c), 1231 (a), 1357(a), or 1366(1) & (3). \n132.  The phrase “all applicable  Federal laws” in the Byrne JAG statute refers to laws \nthat regulate the conduct of federal grant recipients.  Sections 1226(a) and (c), 1231(a), 1357(a), \nand 1366(1) and (3), by their terms, apply to the federal government, not individual  cities and \nstates.  Those laws are therefore not “applicable”  to individual  grant recipients making the \ncertifications required for participation  in the Byrne JAG program. \n133.  As a direct and proximate result of these unlawful conditions,  Chicago will be \nforced to accept unlawful and unconstitutional  grant conditions  or forgo Byrne JAG funds and \nshut down the programs they support.    \n134.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201,  Chicago is entitled to a \ndeclaration that the Attorney General is without authority to impose the additional  certification \nrequirement on Byrne JAG funds (in FY2018 or any future grant year), an order that the \ncondition  be set aside, and an injunction  preventing the condition  from going into effect. \n135.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1361 and 1651, Chicago is entitled to a writ of \nmandamus compelling  the Attorney General to issue and fund Chicago’s FY2018 Byrne JAG \naward as contemplated by the Byrne JAG statute (i.e., without the FY2018 additional \ncertification condition).   \n136.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A), Chicago is entitled to an award of its \ncosts, attorney’s fees, and expenses associated with this litigation.   Any attempt to impose the \n-43- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 44 of 57 PageID #:282\n  \nadditional  certification requirement on Chicago is not substantially  justified  given that this Court \nhas already held that the Attorney General lacks the authority to impose this sort of condition  on \nByrne JAG funds.     \n137.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412(b), Chicago is entitled to an award of its costs, \nattorney’s fees, and expenses associated with this litigation.   Any attempt to impose the \nadditional  certification requirement on Chicago notwithstanding  this Court’s holding  that the \nAttorney General lacks the authority to impose this sort of condition  on Byrne JAG funds \ndemonstrates bad faith and an attempt to undermine or avoid this Court’s permanent injunction \nin Chicago’s FY2017 suit. \nCOUNT TWO:  VIOLATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706 (SEPARATION OF POWERS) \n138.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations  of the preceding paragraphs. \n139.  When an agency acts “contrary to constitutional  right, power, privilege,  or \nimmunity,”  a reviewing court must “hold unlawful and set aside” the challenged action.  5 \nU.S.C. § 706.  \n140.  The Constitution  vests the spending power in Congress, not the President.   \nThe Executive “does not have unilateral authority to refuse to spend . . . funds” that have already \nbeen appropriated by Congress “for a particular project or program.”  In re Aiken Cty., 725 F.3d \n255, 261 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 2013). \n141.  Congress in the Byrne JAG statute required the Executive to distribute Byrne JAG \nfunds based on a simple funding formula.  Imposing a new condition  on the program amounts to \nrefusing to spend money appropriated by Congress unless that condition  is satisfied.  The \nFY2018 notice and access conditions,  the Section 1373 and Section 1644 compliance conditions, \nthe harboring condition,  and the additional  certification condition  were not imposed by Congress, \n-44- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 45 of 57 PageID #:283\n  \nbut rather by the Attorney General.  Those conditions  therefore amount to improper usurpation \nof Congress’s spending power by the Executive Branch. \n142.  The Court’s prior determination  that the Attorney General lacks the statutory \nauthority to impose the notice and access conditions  or the Section 1373 compliance condition, \nin a lawsuit involving  the same parties and the same underlying  federal grant program, is \nconclusive here.  The Attorney General is therefore precluded from relitigating  the issue of his \nauthority to impose the notice and access conditions  or the Section 1373 compliance condition \nand the substantively  identical  Section 1644 compliance condition. \n143.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Chicago is entitled to a \ndeclaration that the FY2018 notice and access conditions,  the Section 1373 and Section 1644 \ncompliance conditions,  the harboring condition,  and the additional  certification  condition  (as \nwell as any materially  identical conditions  the Attorney General may impose in future grant \nyears) violate the constitutional  separation of powers and arrogate to the Executive power that is \nreserved to the Legislature, as well as an injunction  preventing those conditions  from going into \neffect.  \n144.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1361 and 1651, Chicago is entitled to a writ of \nmandamus compelling  the Attorney General to issue and fund Chicago’s FY2018 Byrne JAG \naward as contemplated by the Byrne JAG statute (i.e., without the FY2018 Section 1373 \ncompliance,  Section 1644 compliance,  notice, access, harboring,  or additional  certification \nconditions).   \n145.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A), Chicago is entitled to an award of its \ncosts, attorney’s fees, and expenses associated with this litigation.   The attempt to impose the \nFY2018 Section 1373 compliance,  Section 1644 compliance, notice, and access conditions on \n-45- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 46 of 57 PageID #:284\n  \nChicago is not substantially  justified  given this Court’s order setting aside materially identical \nconditions  Attorney General Sessions attempted to impose on FY2017 Byrne JAG funds.  The \nattempt to impose the harboring condition  and the additional  certification condition  on Chicago \nis not substantially  justified  given that this Court has already held that the Attorney General lacks \nthe authority to impose these sorts of policy  conditions  on Byrne JAG funds. \n146.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412(b), Chicago is entitled to an award of its costs, \nattorney’s fees, and expenses associated with this litigation.   The attempt to impose the FY2018 \nSection 1373 compliance,  Section 1644 compliance, notice, and access conditions on Chicago \nnotwithstanding  this Court’s order setting aside materially  identical conditions  from FY2017 \ndemonstrates bad faith and an attempt to undermine or avoid this Court’s permanent injunction \nin Chicago’s FY2017 suit.  The attempt to impose the harboring condition  and the additional \ncertification condition  on Chicago notwithstanding  this Court’s holding  that the Attorney \nGeneral lacks the authority to impose these sorts of policy conditions  on Byrne JAG funds \ndemonstrates bad faith and an attempt to undermine or avoid this Court’s permanent injunction \nin Chicago’s FY2017 suit. \nCOUNT THREE: VIOLATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706 (SPENDING CLAUSE)  \n147.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations  of the preceding paragraphs. \n148.  In any event, Congress could not have authorized the conditions  here because \nthey do not satisfy the additional  requirements of the Spending  Clause.  Accordingly,  those \nrequirements must be enjoined.   \n-46- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 47 of 57 PageID #:285\n  \nA.  The Conditions Are Unconstitutionally Ambiguous \n149.  Federal restrictions on grants provided to state and local governments must also \nbe articulated “unambiguously”  so that the recipient can “voluntarily  and knowingly  accept[]” \nCongress’s terms.  Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 16-17 (1981).   \n150.  All of the FY2018 immigration-related  conditions  are ambiguous  as to what is \nexpected of grant recipients in Chicago’s position,  particularly  given Chicago’s Welcoming  City \nOrdinance and other relevant policies  and practices.  The FY2018 notice and access conditions \ndo not provide Chicago sufficient notice of what will be expected of it because they are entirely \ndependent on the future exercise of discretion by federal agents outside of the Department of \nJustice.  The Section 1373 and Section 1644 compliance conditions  are also ambiguous,  and the \nDepartment’s guidance documents and other actions have only added to the confusion.   \nFurthermore, many interpretations of Section 1373 and Section 1644 would raise serious \nconstitutional  concerns.  The harboring condition  is likewise ambiguous.  The Trump \nAdministration  has offered no guidance on how a municipality’s  disclosure of information  could \nconstitute “conceal[ing],  harbor[ing],  or shield[ing]  from detection” any individual.   Finally,  the \nadditional  certification condition  is also ambiguous.  It imposes on the certifying jurisdiction  an \nobligation  not to “impede” the federal government’s exercise of its authority under 8 U.S.C. \n§§ 1226(a) & (c), 1231 (a), 1357(a), or 1366(1) & (3), but nowhere explains what the \nDepartment understands “impede” to mean.   \nB.  The Conditions Are Not Germane To The Byrne JAG Program \n151.  Conditions  on spending grants must be “relevant to [the] federal interest” in the \nparticular grant program.  Ivanhoe Irr. Dist. v. McCracken, 357 U.S. 275, 295 (1958); accord \nSouth Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 207-208 & n.3 (1987).  This nexus requirement ensures that \n-47- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 48 of 57 PageID #:286\n  \nthe federal government does not use spending conditions  to regulate state and local governments \nbeyond the contours of the spending program itself.   \n152.  The FY2018 notice and access conditions are not relevant to the federal interest in \nthe Byrne JAG funds Chicago receives.  Among other things, information  concerning when \ndetainees will be released from lockup and policies  respecting access for federal immigration \nagents bear no relevance to improving  the ability  of Chicago’s Bureau of Detective to solve \nviolent crimes, the Force for Good Program, or other uses to which Chicago puts Byrne JAG \nfunds.  Nor are they relevant to the Byrne JAG program’s larger purposes.   \n153.  The Section 1373 and Section 1644 compliance conditions  are also not relevant to \nthe federal interest in the Byrne JAG funds Chicago receives, or to the program’s larger \npurposes.  Information sharing with federal officials regarding an individual’s  immigration  status \nbears no connection to the replacement vehicles for worn-out police patrol cars, support for the \nForce for Good program, or the acquisition  of new law enforcement equipment.   \n154.  The additional  certification condition  is also not relevant to the federal interest in \nthe Byrne JAG funds Chicago receives.   \n155.  The harboring condition  is also not relevant to the federal interest in the Byrne \nJAG funds Chicago receives.  \n156.  As a direct and proximate result of these unconstitutional  conditions,  Chicago will \nbe forced to accept unlawful and unconstitutional  grant conditions  or forgo Byrne JAG funds and \nshut down or materially  alter the programs they support.    \n157.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Chicago is entitled to a \ndeclaration that the FY 2018 notice and access conditions,  the Section 1373 and Section 1644 \ncompliance conditions,  the Section 1324 condition,  the harboring condition,  and the additional \n-48- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 49 of 57 PageID #:287\n  \ncertification condition  (as well as any materially  identical conditions  the Attorney General may \nimpose in future grant years) violate the Spending Clause, as well as an injunction  preventing \nthose conditions  from going into effect.  \n158.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1361 and 1651, Chicago is entitled to a writ of \nmandamus compelling  the Attorney General to issue and fund Chicago’s FY2018 Byrne JAG \naward as contemplated by the Byrne JAG statute (i.e., without the FY2018 Section 1373 \ncompliance,  Section 1644 compliance,  notice, access, harboring or additional  certification \nconditions).   \nCOUNT FOUR: COMMANDEERING \n159.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations  of the preceding paragraphs. \n160.  As this Court has already declared, in a lawsuit involving  the same parties and the \nsame underlying  federal grant program, 8 U.S.C. § 1373 is facially unconstitutional.   That \ndetermination  is conclusive here.  The Attorney General is therefore precluded from relitigating \nSection 1373’s constitutionality.    \n161.  8 U.S.C. § 1644 is substantively  identical to Section 1373.  The Attorney General \nis therefore precluded from litigating  Section 1644’s constitutionality  as well.  \n162.  And beyond the conclusive import of the prior litigation  with regard to Section \n1373 and Section 1644, they are plainly  unconstitutional  under the anticommandeering  doctrine.  \nThe Tenth Amendment prohibits  the federal government from “requir[ing]”  state and local \ngovernments “to govern according to Congress’s instructions,”  New York v. United States, 505 \nU.S. 144, 162 (1992), or “command[ing]  the States’ officers . . . to administer or enforce a \nfederal regulatory program,” Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 935 (1997).  Congress has \ntransgressed the limits  of the Tenth Amendment when it “regulat[es] activities undertaken by \n-49- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 50 of 57 PageID #:288\n  \ngovernment entities only,” Ex. A at 21, rather than “evenhandedly  regulat[ing]  an activity in \nwhich both States and private actors engage,” NCAA, 138 S. Ct. at 1478.  \n163.  Sections 1373 and 1644 do just that, by prohibiting  state and local governments \nfrom engaging in a core aspect of governing:  controlling  the actions of their own employees and \nretaining control over local law enforcement policy. Sections 1373 and 1644 are therefore \nfacially unconstitutional  and cannot be validly  enforced against Chicago or imposed on Byrne \nJAG recipients as “applicable  Federal laws.”  34 U.S.C. § 10153(a)(5)(D). \n164.  As a direct and proximate result of these unconstitutional  conditions,  Chicago will \nbe forced to accept unlawful and unconstitutional  grant conditions  or forgo Byrne JAG funds and \nshut down or materially  alter the programs they support.    \n165.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Chicago is entitled to a declaration that 8 U.S.C. \n§§ 1373 and 1644 violate the Tenth Amendment. \n166.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Chicago is further entitled to a declaration that 8 \nU.S.C. §§ 1373 and 1644 cannot validly  be imposed as conditions  on the Byrne JAG program as \nwell as an injunction  preventing the FY2018 Section 1373 and Section 1644 conditions  (or any \nmaterially  identical conditions  the Attorney General may seek to impose in future grant years) \nfrom going into effect.  \n167.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1361 and 1651, Chicago is entitled to a writ of \nmandamus compelling  the Attorney General to issue and fund Chicago’s FY2018 Byrne JAG \naward as contemplated by the Byrne JAG statute (i.e., without the FY2018 Section 1373 \ncompliance or Section 1644 compliance conditions).   \n168.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A), Chicago is entitled to an award of its \ncosts, attorney’s fees, and expenses associated with this litigation.   Any contention that the \n-50- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 51 of 57 PageID #:289\n  \nSection 1373 and Section 1644 are constitutional  is not substantially  justified  given this Court’s \norder holding  Section 1373 facially unconstitutional.    \n169.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412(b), Chicago is entitled to an award of its costs, \nattorney’s fees, and expenses associated with this litigation.   Any contention that that Section \n1373 and Section 1644 are constitutional  demonstrates bad faith and an attempt to undermine or \navoid this Court’s permanent injunction  in Chicago’s FY2017 suit.   \nCOUNT FIVE: DECLARATORY JUDGMENT THAT CHICAGO’S WELCOMING \nCITY ORDINANCE AND IMPLEMENTING POLICIES COMPLY WITH \nSECTION 1373 AND SECTION 1644 \n170.  Chicago incorporates by reference the allegations  of the preceding paragraphs. \n171.  Where City officials or agents come to possess immigration  status information, \nChicago has no policy restricting the sharing of such information  contrary to Section 1373 or \nSection 1644.  \n172.  Section 20 of the Welcoming  City Ordinance permits Chicago’s agents and \nagencies to request or receive information  about citizenship  or immigration  status (from ICE or \nelsewhere) whenever required by “federal regulation”—which,  as Chicago’s Chief Legal Officer \nhas explained,  “do[es] not restrict the sharing of immigration  status information  with federal \nimmigration  officers.”  \n173.  Section 30 of the Welcoming  City Ordinance limits  the disclosure of an \nindividual’s  citizenship  or immigration  status information  “[e]xcept as otherwise provided by \napplicable federal law.”  In the context of the Welcoming  City Ordinance—and, again, as \nChicago’s Chief Legal Office has explained—“applicable  federal law” includes Sections 1373 \nand 1644 to whatever extent Sections 1373 and 1644, and any individual  federal request made \npursuant to those provisions,  is a lawful and constitutional  exercise of federal authority.   \n-51- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 52 of 57 PageID #:290\n  \n174.  Section 42 of the Welcoming  City Ordinance (and the Chicago Police \nDepartment’s implementing  policy,  CPD Special Order S06-14-03) does not violate Section \n1373 or Section 1644 because the information  Chicago’s agents or agencies may not share is \ninformation  “regarding a person’s custody status or release date.”  That information  is not \n“information  regarding . . . citizenship  or immigration  status” covered by Sections 1373 and \n1644.  See Steinle v. City and County of San Francisco, 230 F. Supp. 3d 994, 1015 (N.D. Cal. \n2017). \n175.  Chicago has repeatedly certified its compliance with Section 1373 and explained \nits reasons for doing so.  Those certifications necessarily extend to Section 1644, because Section \n1373 and Section 1644 proscribe the same conduct.   \n176.  To date, the Department has not stated whether it accepts Chicago’s prior \ncertifications.  While Chicago is confident it complies with both Section 1373 and Section 1644 \nfor the reasons stated above, the Department’s conduct has sown confusion and created the \nimpression  that the federal government believes otherwise, notwithstanding  Chicago’s legal \nanalysis.  Chicago is reluctant to certify compliance with Section 1373 and Section 1644 in its \nFY 2018 Byrne JAG application,  which is due imminently,  until the Department affirms that the \nCity’s prior certifications are acceptable. \n177.  Chicago has a credible fear of prosecution  or other enforcement action.  The \nDepartment has taken the President’s directive to “enforce” Section 1373 as an instruction  to file \npreemption lawsuits against jurisdictions  with policies  it believes violate Section 1373.  See \nsupra ¶ 65.  That the Department has sued the State of California over its approach to federal \nimmigration  enforcement is a strong indication  that the Department has taken the President’s \ninstruction  to heart and is willing  to pursue legal action against “sanctuary” jurisdictions. \n-52- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 53 of 57 PageID #:291\n  \n178.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Chicago is entitled to a declaration that its \nWelcoming  City Ordinance and implementing  policies  comply with Sections 1373 and 1644. \nCOUNT SIX: DECLARATORY JUDGMENT THAT CHICAGO’S WELCOMING CITY \nORDINANCE AND IMPLEMENTING POLICIES COMPLY WITH 8 U.S.C. § 1324 \n \n179.  Chicago incorporates by reference the allegations  of the preceding paragraphs. \n180.  The Welcoming  City Ordinance prohibits  Chicago’s agents and agencies from \narresting, detaining,  or continuing  to detain an individual  based solely on their immigration \nstatus unless required to do so by applicable law.  These provisions  expressly require compliance \nwith federal laws and regulations,  including  8 U.S.C. § 1324. \n181.  The Ordinance also restricts the extent to which local officials may be compelled \nto participate in federal immigration  enforcement.  Nothing in 8 U.S.C. § 1324 creates an \naffirmative requirement for local governments to enforce immigration  law or to assist federal \nauthorities in enforcing immigration  law. \n182.  While Chicago is confident it complies with Section 1324, the Department has \nsown confusion and created the impression that the federal government believes otherwise, \nnotwithstanding  Chicago’s own legal analysis.   \n183.  High-ranking  Trump Administration  officials have threated to prosecute local \nofficials and governments for violation  of Section 1324, without providing  any meaningful \nguidance on how to determine compliance.   \n184.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Chicago is entitled to a declaration that it complies \nwith Section 1324. \nCOUNT SEVEN: VIOLATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706 (ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS) \n185.  Chicago incorporates by reference the allegations  of the preceding paragraphs. \n-53- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 54 of 57 PageID #:292\n  \n186.  In addition  to lacking statutory and constitutional  authority to impose the \nimmigration-related  conditions  on the Byrne JAG grant, the conditions  are arbitrary and \ncapricious, in violation  of the Administrative  Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706. \n187.  The FY 2018 immigration-related  conditions  are arbitrary and capricious because \nthe Department failed to rely on reasoned decisionmaking  and, to the extent it cited reasons at \nall, those reasons are contradicted by the evidence before the agency.  “Normally,  an agency rule \nwould be arbitrary and capricious if the agency has relied on factors which Congress has not \nintended it to consider . . . .”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. \nIns. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  Here, among other things, the Department proposes to evaluate \ngrant applicants on the basis of their immigration  policies  rather than on their compliance with \nexpressly enumerated statutory application  requirements.  See 34 U.S.C. § 10153(a)(1)-(5).  It \nalso “entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,” State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43, \nincluding  but not limited  to the policing  challenges created by alienating  and inducing  fear in \nimmigrant  communities.   It also “offered an explanation  for its decision that runs counter to the \nevidence before the agency,” which likewise is arbitrary and capricious,  id., including  the \nevidence submitted by nine jurisdictions  in their Section 1373 certification  letters indicating  that \nWelcoming  City-style policies promote rather than detract from effective policing.   Indeed, when \nAttorney General Sessions referred to one study in the press that showed that such policies  lead \nto higher crime, the study’s own authors said he was misrepresenting their work. \n188.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. §§ 1651 and 2201, Chicago is entitled \nto a declaration that the immigration-related  conditions  for the FY2018 Byrne JAG funds are in \nviolation  of the APA as well as an injunction  preventing those conditions  from going into effect. \n-54- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 55 of 57 PageID #:293\n  \nCOUNT EIGHT:  DECLARATORY JUDGMENT THAT MR. WHITAKER LACKS \nTHE AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE THE CONDITIONS \n189.  Chicago incorporates by reference the allegations  of the preceding paragraphs. \n190.  Upon Attorney General Sessions’ resignation,  the Department of Justice’s \nsuccession statute required that Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein should exercise the duties \nof the office of the Attorney General until such time as a new Attorney General was appointed \nby and with the advice and consent of the Senate.  There is no indication  that Deputy Attorney \nGeneral Rosenstein is not available to exercise the duties of the office of the Attorney General.  \nAnd if Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein were for any reason unable to act in this capacity, \nthe statutorily  mandated line of succession would next run to Solicitor  General Francisco. \n191.  The Department of Justice’s specific succession statute, 28 U.S.C. § 508, controls \nhere, and the more general Federal Vacancies Reform Act, 5 U.S.C. § 3345 et seq. does not.  The \nPresident accordingly lacked statutory authority to circumvent the succession statute by directing \nMr. Whitaker to act as the Attorney General.   \n192.  Moreover, if any provision  of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act did allow a non-\nSenate-confirmed Justice Department employee to be installed as Acting Attorney General, that \nprovision  would be unconstitutional  as applied here.  Any authority the President has to appoint \nan Acting Attorney General from outside the line of succession set forth in the Department of \nJustice’s organic statute is still cabined by the Appointments  Clause of the U.S. Constitution.   \nThe Appointments  Clause requires that anyone acting as an officer of the United States be \nappointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, with a potential exception for \nexigencies.  The office of the Attorney General is indisputably  an office subject to the \nAppointments  Clause, and no exigency existed sufficient to overcome the requirements of the \nAppointments  Clause. \n-55- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 56 of 57 PageID #:294\n  \n193.  The purported appointment  of Mr. Whitaker as acting Attorney General is invalid \nand ineffective.  Therefore, the conditions  imposed on Chicago’s Byrne JAG grant award under \nhis purported authority are invalid  as applied to Chicago for that reason as well. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays this Court: \na)  Declare unlawful and set aside the immigration-related  conditions  included in the \nFY2018 Byrne JAG solicitation  and awards on a program-wide basis;  \nb)  Declare that 8 U.S.C. §§ 1373 and 1644 violate anti-commandeering  principles \nand are therefore facially unconstitutional  under the Tenth Amendment;  \nc)  Declare that Chicago’s Welcoming  City Ordinance and implementing  policies \ncomply with 8 U.S.C. § 1373, 8 U.S.C. § 1644, and 8 U.S.C. § 1324; \nd)  Declare that Matthew Whitaker’s purported appointment  as Acting Attorney \nGeneral is unlawful and that the imposition  of the challenged conditions  on Chicago’s FY2018 \nByrne JAG award is unlawful as applied for that reason as well; \ne)  Enjoin  the Attorney General from enforcing the proposed immigration-related \nconditions  on FY2018 Byrne JAG funding on a program-wide basis; \nf)  Enjoin  the Attorney General from imposing  substantively  similar conditions  in \nfuture grant years; \ng)  Enjoin  the Attorney General from denying or delaying  issuance of any Byrne JAG \naward and from denying or delaying release of any Byrne JAG funds (in FY2018 or future grant \nyears) insofar as the denial or delay is based on the challenged conditions;    \nh)  Order the Attorney General to issue and fund Chicago’s FY2018 Byrne JAG \naward immediately;   \n-56- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 34 Filed: 12/17/18 Page 57 of 57 PageID #:295\n  \ni)  Award attorney’s fees and costs to Chicago to the fullest extent permissible  by \nlaw; \nj)  Retain jurisdiction  to monitor  the Attorney General’s compliance with this \nCourt’s judgment; and \nk)  Grant such other relief as this Court may deem proper. \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \nDecember 17, 2018.

Case No. 18 C 6859     \n   \nWILLIAM P. BARR, in his  Judge Harry D.

In this case—the latest chapter of a dispute playing \nout in district and appellate courts around the country—the City \nof Chicago takes issue with the conditions that the U.S. Attorney \nGeneral  placed  on  the  FY  2018  Edward  Byrne  Memorial  Justice \nAssistance Grant (“Byrne JAG”) Program. The City contends that \ncertain  conditions  attached  to  Byrne  JAG  funds  violate  the \nconstitutional requirements of federalism and the separation of \npowers.  For  the  reasons  stated  herein,  Defendant’s  Motion  to \nDismiss  (Dkt.  No.  42)  is  granted  in  part  and  denied  in  part.  \nPlaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. No. 48) is granted \nin part and denied in part.  \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 2 of 47 PageID #:2921\nI.  BACKGROUND \n  In addition to describing the most relevant facts here, the \nCourt incorporates those facts previously described in its earlier \nSee City of Chicago v. Sessions\nruling.  , 321 F. Supp. 3d 855 (N.D. \n \nIll. 2018). \n  The  Byrne  JAG  program  is  the  primary  source  of  federal \ncriminal justice funding available to state and local governments. \n(Def.’s Resp. to Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts (“PSOF”) ¶ 11, Dkt. No. 62.) \nThis program is overseen by the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) \nwithin the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). (PSOF ¶ 11.) The Byrne \nJAG  program  distributes  funds  by  a  statutorily-defined  formula \nbased on a state’s population and the number of violent crimes \nSee\nreported within that jurisdiction in the past year.   34 U.S.C. \n§ 10156. To receive Byrne JAG funds, a state or local government \nmust  apply  and  comply  with  all  conditions  outlined  in  the \nSee\nSolicitation document that the Attorney General provides.   34 \nU.S.C. § 10153. \n  Chicago has received Byrne JAG funds every year since 2005. \n(PSOF ¶ 12.) But in 2017 the City ran into trouble when it came \ntime to apply for and accept Byrne JAG funds. The Attorney General \nattached several new immigration-related conditions to the FY 2017 \nfunds  that  conflicted  with  Chicago’s  stated  policy  goals  of \npromoting cooperation between local law enforcement and immigrant \ncommunities and ensuring access to essential city services for all \n \n- 2 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 3 of 47 PageID #:2921\ncity  residents  regardless  of  citizenship  status.  Therefore,  in \nAugust of 2017, the City sued the Attorney General (then Jefferson \nSessions) to enjoin his office from attaching those conditions to \nSee City of Chicago v. Sessions\nthe FY 2017 Byrne JAG funds.  , \nNo. 17-cv-5720 (N.D. Ill.). \n  In the 2017 case, Chicago challenged three conditions that \nthe Court will explain in detail later and will refer to as the \n“notice,  access,  and  Section  1373  compliance  conditions.”  In \nSeptember  of  2017,  this  Court  issued  a  nationwide  preliminary \nSee City of \ninjunction as to the notice and access conditions. \nChicago v. Sessions\n, 264 F. Supp. 3d 933 (N.D. Ill. 2017). The \nCourt denied the Attorney General’s request to stay the nationwide \nSee City of Chicago v. \napplication of the preliminary injunction. \nSessions\n,  No.  17-cv-5720,  2017  WL  4572208  (N.D.  Ill.  Oct.  13, \n2017). The Seventh Circuit affirmed the Court’s decision to grant \nthe  preliminary  injunction,  but  later  decided  to  take  up  the \nen banc See \nlimited issue of the injunction’s nationwide scope  . \nCity  of  Chicago  v.  Sessions\n,  888  F.3d  272  (7th  Cir.  2018) \nreh’g en banc granted in \n(affirming the preliminary injunction), \npart, opinion vacated in part\n, No. 17-2991, 2018 WL 4268817 (7th \nen banc\nCir. June 4, 2018) (granting   review as to the issue of \nwhether a nationwide injunction was proper). \n  Then,  in  July  2018,  this  Court  granted  partial  summary \n See City of Chicago v. Sessions\njudgment for the City. , 321 F. \n \n- 3 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 4 of 47 PageID #:2921\nSupp. 3d 855 (N.D. Ill. 2018). The Court held the notice and access \nconditions unconstitutional because neither the Byrne JAG statute \nnor  any  other  federal  law  gave  the  Attorney  General  statutory \nId\nauthority to impose them.  . at 873-74. The Court further found \nthat  8  U.S.C.  § 1373  is  unconstitutional  as  it  violates  the \nanticommandeering doctrine, and that therefore the Section 1373 \ncompliance  condition  is  unlawful  because  the  Attorney  General \nId\ncannot demand compliance with an unconstitutional law.  . at 875-\n76. The Court entered a permanent nationwide injunction preventing \nthe  Attorney  General  from  attaching  the  three  aforementioned \nId\nconditions  to  the  FY  2017  Byrne  JAG  funds.  .  at  881;  Final \nChicago  v.  Sessions  \nJudgment  and  Order,  , No.  17-cv-5720  (N.D. \nIll.), Dkt. No. 211. However, as the Seventh Circuit had at the \ntime stayed the nationwide scope of the preliminary injunction \nen banc\npending an   rehearing, this Court stayed the nationwide \nSee City of \nscope of the permanent injunction in the same fashion. \nChicago\n, 321 F. Supp. 3d at 881-82. However, the Seventh Circuit \nen banc \nvacated the  hearing after this Court issued its permanent \ninjunction, as by that point the preliminary injunction “ha[d] all \nCity of Chicago\nbut evaporated.”  , 2018 WL 4268814, at *2. Thus, \nthe permanent injunction regarding the notice, access, and Section \n1373 compliance conditions currently applies only to the FY 2017 \nSee \nfunds and Chicago.  Final Judgment and Order. The Court’s 2018 \n \n- 4 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 5 of 47 PageID #:2921\nsummary judgment opinion is on appeal before the Seventh Circuit. \nSee City of Chicago v. William Barr\n, No. 18-2885 (7th Cir.).  \n  The Attorney General began issuing FY 2018 Byrne JAG funds in \nOctober  of  2018.  (PSOF  ¶ 34.)  Chicago  filed  this  suit  on \nOctober 12, 2018, seeking to enjoin the Attorney General from again \nimposing  certain  immigration-related  conditions on  the  FY  2018 \nfunds. On November 20, 2018, DOJ notified Chicago that OJP had \nawarded the City $2,268,856 for its FY 2018 Byrne JAG award. (PSOF \n¶ 35.) However, as before, to accept the money, Chicago had to \nSee \nagree to a variety of conditions. ( Chicago FY 2018 Byrne JAG \nAward, Ex. C to Def.’s Request for Judicial Notice (“RJN”), Dkt. \nNo. 44-1.) \n  Several funding conditions are at issue in this case. Some \nthis Court has already ruled upon, and others are new. The first \nfour conditions, which have already been before this Court and \ntherefore will be referred to as the “repeat conditions,” are as \nfollows:  \n \n1. The notice condition. This condition requires the \nState  or  local  government  to  “provide—as  early  as \npracticable…  —advance  notice  to  [the  Department  of \nHomeland Security (DHS)] of the scheduled release date \nand time for a particular alien, if a State or local \ngovernment  (or  government-contracted)  correctional \nfacility  receives  from  DHS  a  formal  written  request \npursuant to the INA that seeks such advance notice.” \n(Chicago FY 2018 Byrne JAG Award ¶ 46.) \n \n \n2. The access condition. This condition requires the \nState or local government to permit federal government \nagents  “access  to  any  State  or  local  government  (or \n \n- 5 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 6 of 47 PageID #:2921\ngovernment-contracted)  correctional  facility  by  such \nagents for the purpose” of “interrogat[ing] any alien or \nperson believed to be an alien as to his [or her] right \nId\nto be or to remain in the United States.” ( . ¶ 45.) \n \n \n3. The  Section  1373  compliance  condition.  This \ncondition  requires  the  Chief  Legal  Officer  of  the \nrecipient jurisdiction to certify that the “program or \nactivity” funded under the Byrne JAG award complies with \nId\n8 U.S.C. §§ 1373 (a) and (b). ( . ¶¶ 41-43.) 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1373 provides: “Notwithstanding any other provision of \nFederal, State, or local law, a Federal, State, or local \ngovernment entity or official may not prohibit, or in \nany way restrict, any government entity or official from \nsending  to,  or  receiving  from,  the  Immigration  and \nNaturalization  Service  information  regarding  the \ncitizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, \nof any individual.” 8 U.S.C. § 1373. \n \n \n4. The  Section  1644  compliance  condition.  This \ncondition requires the Chief Legal Officer to certify \nthat the “program or activity” funded under the Byrne \nJAG award complies with 8 U.S.C. § 1644.  (Chicago FY \n2018  Byrne  JAG  Award  ¶¶ 41-43.)  8  U.S.C.  § 1644 \nprovides:  “Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of \nFederal,  State,  or  local  law,  no  State  or  local \ngovernment  entity  may  be  prohibited,  or  in  any  way \nrestricted,  from  sending  to  or  receiving  from  the \nImmigration  and  Naturalization  Service  information \nregarding the immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of \nan alien in the United States.” 8 U.S.C. § 1644.  \n \nOn November 2, 2018, DOJ announced that, “at this time” it would \nnot “use or enforce” the repeat conditions against Chicago, because \nSee \nthese  conditions  were  the  subject  of  pending  litigation.  (\nFY 2017 and FY 2018 JAG Award Special Notices at 2, Ex. D to Def.’s \nRJN.)  However,  DOJ  reserved  the  right  to  enforce  the  repeat \nconditions against Chicago in the future if “the posture of the \npending  litigation  changes  (or  if  the  pending  litigation  is \n \n- 6 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 7 of 47 PageID #:2921\nresolved) in a manner such that DOJ decides to use or enforce any \nId\nor all of [the repeat conditions.]” ( .) \n  There are also two new conditions attached to the FY 2018 \ngrants that are at issue in this case:   \n \n1. The harboring condition. This condition prohibits \nthe  recipient  jurisdiction  from  making  any  “public \ndisclosure… of any federal law enforcement information \nin a direct or indirect attempt to conceal, harbor, or \nshield from detection any fugitive from justice under 18 \nU.S.C. ch. 49, or any alien who has come to, entered, or \nremains in the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. \nch. 12—without regard to whether such disclosure would \nconstitute (or could form a predicate for) a violation \nof  18  U.S.C.  1071  or  1072  or  of  8  U.S.C.  1324(a).” \n(Chicago FY 2018 Byrne JAG Award.)  \n \n \n2. The  additional  certification  requirement.  This \ncondition requires the recipient jurisdiction to submit \na “Certifications and Assurances by the Chief Executive \nof the Applicant Government.” (Chicago FY 2018 Byrne JAG \nAward ¶ 61.) The condition incorporates a requirement \nthat  the  City’s  Chief  Legal  officer  certify  that \n“neither  the  jurisdiction  nor  any  entity,  agency,  or \nofficial of the jurisdiction has in effect… any law, \nrule,  policy,  or  practice  that  would  apply  to  the \n‘program or activity’ to be funded… that would or does—\n(a) impede the exercise by federal officers of authority \nunder 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a); or (b) impede the exercise by \nfederal  officers  of  authority  relating  to  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1226(a)  or  (c),  8  U.S.C.  §  1231(a),  or  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1366(1) or (3).” (State or Local Government: FY 2018 \nCertification, Ex. M to Pl.’s RJN, Dkt. No. 52-13.)  \n \nThe  Court  will  refer  to  these  two  conditions  as  the  “new \nconditions.”  As with the repeat conditions, DOJ announced that it \nwould not enforce the additional certification requirement against \nSee \nChicago. ( FY 2017 and FY 2018 JAG Award Special Notices at 2.) \n \n- 7 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 8 of 47 PageID #:2921\nThe Court will refer to all six funding conditions together as the \n“challenged conditions.” \n  The  present  motions  concern  Chicago’s  Amended  Complaint, \nwhich contains eight Counts.  Count I charges that the challenged \nultra vires,\nconditions are   as the Attorney General does not have \nstatutory  authority  to  impose  them.  Count  II  alleges  that  the \nchallenged conditions violate the separation of powers doctrine. \nCount  III  alleges  that  the  challenged  conditions  violate  the \nSpending Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Count IV alleges that \n8 U.S.C.  §§ 1373  and  1644  violate  the  Tenth  Amendment’s \nanticommandeering doctrine and thus the Attorney General cannot \nimpose compliance with these laws as conditions on the Byrne JAG \nprogram.  Count  V  asserts  that,  notwithstanding  the \nunconstitutionality of §§ 1373 and 1644, Chicago’s Welcoming City \nOrdinance and implementing policies comply with §§ 1373 and 1644, \nand  the  City  deserves  declaratory  judgment  to  that  effect.  In \nCount VI, Chicago seeks a declaratory judgment that its Welcoming \nCity  Ordinance  and  implementing  policies  comply  with  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1324.  Count  VII  alleges  that  the  challenged  conditions  are \narbitrary  and  capricious  in  violation  of  the  Administrative \nProcedure  Act  (“APA”).  Finally,  Count  VIII  asserts  that  the \nPresident lacked statutory authority under the DOJ’s succession \nstatute, 28 U.S.C. § 508, to appoint Matthew Whitaker as acting \nAttorney General. Chicago seeks a permanent injunction preventing \n \n- 8 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 9 of 47 PageID #:2921\nthe challenged conditions from taking effect. The City further \nreserves its right, upon final judgment of the Court and pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. § 2412, to seek reasonable attorneys’ fees, expenses, \nand costs.   \n  Chicago  now  moves  for  summary  judgment  in  its  favor  on \nCounts I, II, III, IV, and VII, seeking a declaration that the \nchallenged conditions violate the U.S. Constitution and the APA, \nand a permanent injunction that prohibits the DOJ from imposing \nthe challenged conditions on the FY 2018 funds or in any future \nprogram year. The Attorney General moves under Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) to dismiss various aspects \nof  the  Amended  Complaint.  Specifically,  the  Attorney  General \nargues that Chicago lacks standing to challenge the additional \ncertification  requirement,  seek  a  declaration  regarding  its \ncompliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1324, and challenge the President’s \nappointment  of  former  Acting  Attorney  General  Whitaker;  and \nChicago fails to state a claim on its APA counts and its challenges \nto the harboring condition. \n  The Court will first address the standing and jurisdictional \narguments for dismissal, and then turn to the merits of the Counts \nat issue in Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment.  \nII.  MOTION TO DISMISS \n  The Attorney General moves to dismiss Counts I, II, III, VI, \nVII and VIII of Chicago’s Amended Complaint under Rules 12(b)(1) \n \n- 9 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 10 of 47 PageID #:2921\nand 12(b)(6). A motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) tests \nSee \nthe jurisdictional sufficiency of the complaint.  FED. R. CIV. \nPRO. 12(b)(1). Defendant asserts a facial challenge to Chicago’s \nSee Silha v. ACT, Inc.\nAmended Complaint.    , 807 F.3d 169, 173 (7th \nCir. 2015) (noting that in evaluating a challenge to subject matter \njurisdiction, a court must first determine whether a defendant has \nraised a factual or facial challenge). A facial challenge argues \nthat the plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged a basis of subject \nId\nmatter jurisdiction.  . In a facial challenge to subject matter \njurisdiction, the court does not look beyond the allegations in \nthe complaint, which are taken as true for purposes of the motion. \nApex Digital, Inc. v. Sears, Roebuck & Co.\n, 572 F.3d 440, 444 (7th \nCir. 2009). The plaintiff bears the burden of establishing the \nSee Silha  \nelements necessary for jurisdiction.  , 807 F.3d at 173.  \n  Rule 12(b)(6) allows dismissal for “failure to state a claim \nSee \nupon which relief can be granted.”  FED. R. CIV. PRO. 12(b)(6). \nA  court  entertaining  a  Rule  12(b)(6)  motion  must  construe  the \ncomplaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and accept \nTamayo v. Blagojevich\nas true all well-pleaded facts alleged.  , 526 \nF.3d 1074, 1081 (7th Cir. 2008). To survive a motion to dismiss \nunder Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint must “provide a short and plain \nstatement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to \nrelief, sufficient to provide the defendant with fair notice of \nId see also \nthe claim and its basis.”  .;  FED. R. CIV. P. 8(a)(2). \n \n- 10 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 11 of 47 PageID #:2921\n  A.  Whitaker Appointment (Count VIII) \n  The  Court  can  dispense  of  the  first  issue  quickly.  In \nCount VIII, Plaintiff challenges the President’s 2018 appointment \nof Matthew Whitaker as Acting Attorney General. In February 2019, \nthe President appointed, and the Senate confirmed, William Barr to \nserve  as  Attorney  General.  Accordingly,  in  its  response  to \nDefendant’s  Motion  to  Dismiss,  Plaintiff  concedes  that  it  is \nSee \nabandoning this claim. ( Pl.’s Memo. at 24, Dkt. No. 50 (“[T]he \nCourt need not take up this weighty constitutional issue now.”).) \nThus, Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss Count VIII with prejudice is \ngranted.  \nB.  Welcoming City Ordinance Declaratory Judgment (Count VI) \n \n  The Court turns to the Attorney General’s argument against \nCount VI, in which the City seeks a declaratory judgment that its \nWelcoming City Ordinance (the “Ordinance”) and its implementing \npolicies comply with 8 U.S.C. § 1324. Section 1324 contains the \nSee \nfederal prohibition against harboring illegal aliens.  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1324(a)  (establishing  criminal  liability  for  any  person  who \n“knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that an alien has \ncome to, entered, or remains in the United States in violation of \nlaw, conceals, harbors, or shields from detection, or attempts to \nconceal,  harbor,  or  shield  from  detection,  such  alien  in  any \nplace”).  \n \n- 11 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 12 of 47 PageID #:2921\n  This  Ordinance,  codified  as  Chapter  2-173  of  the  Chicago \nMunicipal Code, reflects the City’s determination that, “as a City \nin which one out of five of its residents is an immigrant, ‘the \ncooperation of all persons, both documented citizens and those \nwithout documentation status, is essential to achieve the City’s \ngoals  of  protecting  life  and  property,  preventing  crime  and \nCity of Chicago\nresolving problems.’”  , 888 F.3d at 279 (citing \nChicago,  Ill.  Muni.  Code  § 2-173-005).  The  Ordinance  prohibits \nCity agents from arresting, detaining, or continuing to detain a \nperson based upon an immigration detainer when such detainer is \nfor a civil immigration law violation, or on the belief that the \nperson is not present legally in the U.S. or has committed a civil \nimmigration violation. Chicago, Ill. Muni. Code § 2-173-042(a). So \ntoo  are  City  agents  prohibited  from  allowing  Immigrations  and \nCustoms  Enforcement  (ICE)  agents  access  to  a  person  in  City \ncustody,  allowing  ICE  agents  use  of  City  facilities  for \ninvestigative purposes, expending their time on duty responding to \nICE inquiries, and informing ICE of a person’s custody status or \nrelease  date.  Chicago,  Ill.  Muni.  Code  §  2-173-042(b).  The \nprohibitions in § 2-173-042 do not apply when the individual in \nquestion is a gang member, convicted felon, has a felony charge \nId\npending,  or  has  an  outstanding  criminal  warrant.  .  §  2-173-\n042(c).  There  is  also  an  exception  for  when  City  agents  act \n \n- 12 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 13 of 47 PageID #:2921\npursuant to a “legitimate law enforcement purpose that is unrelated \nId\nto the enforcement of a civil immigration law.”  . § 2-173-042(b). \n  In its Amended Complaint, Chicago alleges that high-ranking \nofficials in President Trump’s administration have threatened to \n“weaponize”  8  U.S.C.  § 1324  against  Chicago  and  other \njurisdictions  seeking  to  prioritize  local  law  enforcement  over \nenforcement of federal immigration law. Chicago cites to two such \nincidents: (1) a January 4, 2018, interview on Fox News in which \nthen-Acting Director of ICE Thomas Homan states that he had asked \nDOJ  to  “look  into  criminal  charges  for  elected  officials  with \nsanctuary  policies,  as  they  are  harboring  illegal  aliens, \naccording to 8 U.S.C. § 1324.” (Am. Compl. ¶ 65, Dkt. No. 34.) And \n(2)  a  January  16,  2018,  hearing  before  the  Senate  Judiciary \nCommittee  in  which  Kirstjen  Nielsen,  the  then-Secretary  of \nHomeland  Security,  stated  during  her  testimony  that  “the \nDepartment of Justice is reviewing what avenues may be available” \nto charge elected officials in so-called sanctuary jurisdictions. \nId\n( .) The City emphasizes that in the approximately 70 years of \nthe law’s existence, the federal government has never attempted to \nprosecute  an  elected  official  acting  in  his  or  her  official \ncapacity for a violation of Section 1324. This, despite the fact \nthat Chicago has had a version of a policy of prohibiting City \nofficials  from  assisting  in  federal  immigration  investigations \nsince 1984. (Am. Compl. ¶ 24.) Chicago contends that these comments \n \n- 13 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 14 of 47 PageID #:2921\nfrom  Trump  Administration  officials  suggest  that  DOJ  is \nconsidering criminally prosecuting elected officials in Chicago \nunder Section 1324. \n  The Attorney General asserts that Chicago’s request for a \ndeclaration that its Ordinance complies with Section 1324 is unripe \nbecause the City does not allege that the federal government has \ntaken any effort to charge the City or its leaders with violating \nthat statute. Nor does the City allege that federal government \nofficials have suggested future Section 1324 prosecutions against \nChicago \nofficials specifically.  \n  To establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must show (1) \nan “injury in fact,” (2) a sufficient “causal connection between \nthe injury and the conduct complained of,” and (3) a “likelihood” \nSusan \nthat the injury “will be redressed by a favorable decision.” \nB. Anthony List v. Driehaus\n, 573 U.S. 149, 157-58 (2014) (citing \nLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife\n, 504 U.S. 555 at 560-61 (1992)). \nThe  Attorney  General’s  argument  concerns  the  injury  in  fact \nrequirement, ensures that a plaintiff has a “personal stake in the \nId\noutcome  of  the  controversy.”  .  at  158,  157  n.5  (noting  that \nstanding and ripeness issues in a pre-enforcement challenge case \n“boil down to the same question”). An injury sufficient to satisfy \nArticle III must be “concrete and particularized” and “actual or \nId\nimminent,  not  conjectural  or  hypothetical.”  .  (internal \nquotations omitted). An allegation of future injury may suffice if \n \n- 14 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 15 of 47 PageID #:2921\nthe  threatened  injury  is  “certainly  impending,”  or  there  is  a \nId\n“substantial risk that the harm will occur.”  . (citation and \ninternal quotations omitted).  \n  Count  VI  raises  a  “pre-enforcement  challenge.”  When  a \nplaintiff claims that the threatened enforcement of a law creates \nan injury sufficient to create Article III standing, an actual \narrest,  prosecution,  or  other  enforcement  action  is  “not  a \nSusan B. Anthony\nprerequisite to challenging the law.”  , 573 U.S. \nat  158-59.  A  court  may  undertake  pre-enforcement  when \ncircumstances  “render  the  threatened  enforcement  sufficiently \nId\nimminent.”  . at 159. Specifically, a plaintiff satisfies the \ninjury-in-fact requirement if he alleges “an intention to engage \nin a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional \ninterest, but proscribed by a statute, and there exists a credible \nId Babbitt  v.  Farm \nthreat  of  prosecution  thereunder.”  .  (citing \nWorkers\n, 442 U.S. 289, 298 (1979)).  \n  Chicago has met the ripeness standard. The City has alleged \nan intention to engage in—or more accurately, declared that it is \nalready engaging in—a course of conduct arguably affected with a \nSee \nconstitutional interest but proscribed by 8 U.S.C. § 1324. \nDriehaus\n, 573 U.S. at 159. The Attorney General has not raised an \nargument as to why Chicago’s constitutionally protected interests \nare  not  in  play.  Regardless,  the  City  properly  identifies  two \nconstitutional interests relevant to its desire to implement its \n \n- 15 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 16 of 47 PageID #:2921\nsee\nOrdinance: (1) Chicago’s First Amendment free speech rights,   \nRosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Virginia\n, 515 U.S. \n819, 833 (1995); and (2) the anticommandeering doctrine, which \nlimits Congress’s ability to issue orders directly to State and \nsee Murphy v. Nat’l Collegiate Athletic Ass’n\nlocal governments,  , \n138 S. Ct. 1461, 1475 (2018). Furthermore, Chicago alleged that \nthe federal government made a credible threat of prosecution under \nDriehaus Ohio Civil Rights Comm’n \nSection 1324.  , 573 U.S. at 159; \nv. Dayton Christian Schools, Inc.\n, 477 U.S. 619, 625 n.1, (1986) \n(“[A]  reasonable  threat  of  prosecution  creates  a  ripe \ncontroversy.”). No less than the Acting Director of ICE and the \nSecretary of Homeland Security advised the public that DOJ was \nconsidering charging elected officials in “sanctuary cities” with \nviolating  Section  1324.  The  high-ranking  nature  of  these \nindividuals’ roles in the executive branch renders their threats \ncredible. The fact that these officials did not threaten Chicago \nor its elected officials by name does not doom the City’s claim. \nThe federal government has “not disavowed any intention of invoking \nthe criminal penalty” behind Section 1324, leaving the City “some \nSee \nreason in fearing prosecution” for violation of that statute. \nBabbitt . \n,  442  U.S.  at  302 Thus,  Chicago’s  pre-enforcement \nchallenge  is  ripe,  and  the  Court  denies  Defendant’s  Motion  to \nDismiss Count VI.  \n \n- 16 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 17 of 47 PageID #:2921\n  However, the Court notes that while Chicago opposed the Motion \nto Dismiss Count VI, it did not move for summary judgment on this \nCount.  Thus, Count VI remains in the case at this time. \nC.  Standing to Challenge the Additional Certification \nRequirement \n \n  The  Attorney  General  argues  that  the  Court  lacks  subject \nmatter jurisdiction over Chicago’s challenges to the additional \ncertification requirement (contained in Counts I, II, and III) \nbecause the City does not have Article III standing to pursue them. \nSpecifically, the Attorney General argues that Chicago lacks an \ninjury  in  fact  sufficient  to  challenge  the  additional \ncertification requirement because OJP has “publicly announced that \nit is not enforcing this requirement as to Chicago and several \nother jurisdictions.” (Def.’s Mot. at 22, Dkt. No. 44.) Further, \nthe Attorney General asserts that if OJP were to decide to enforce \nthe requirement, it would provide formal, written notice. \n  The City counters that DOJ’s announcement was issued three \nweeks after the filing of Chicago’s suit and, as a result, standing \nis not defeated. (Pl.’s Mot. at 20). The City is correct. Standing \nSee Friends of the \nis measured at the commencement of an action.   \nEarth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs (TOC), Inc.\n.  , 528 U.S. 167, \n189 (2000) (“The requisite personal interest that must exist at \nthe  commencement  of  the  litigation  (standing)  must  continue \nthroughout  its  existence  (mootness).”).  Chicago  filed  its \n \n- 17 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 18 of 47 PageID #:2921\nComplaint on October 12, 2018, and DOJ issued its announcement on \nNovember 2, 2018. Because the City’s injury is measured at the \ntime the complaint is filed, Defendant’s argument fails. \n  Instead, the question is one of mootness, and whether DOJ’s \nwithdrawal  of  the  additional  compliance  requirement  moots  the \nCity’s complaint on this issue. Normally, under Article III, cases \nwithout  “actual,  ongoing  controversies  are  moot  and  must  be \nFed’n  of  Adver.  Indus. \ndismissed  for  lack  of  jurisdiction.” \nRepresentatives, Inc. v. City of Chicago\n, 326 F.3d 924, 929 (7th \nStotts v. Cmty. Unit Sch. Dist. No. 1\nCir. 2003) (quoting  , 230 \nF.3d 989, 990–91 (7th Cir. 2000)). One exception to this rule is \nwhen a defendant voluntary stops performing the challenged conduct \nFriends of the Earth, Inc.\nafter the commencement of a suit.  , 528 \nU.S. at 173. Ordinarily, the “voluntary cessation of the allegedly \nId.\nunlawful conduct” is insufficient to render a claim moot.   But \nfor this exception, courts would be left “compelled to leave the \nId.\ndefendant… free to return to his old ways.”   at 189 (citing \nCity of Mesquite v. Aladdin’s Castle, Inc.\n, 484 U.S. 283, 289 \n \n(1982)  (internal  quotations  omitted)). Finally,  “[t]he  heavy \nburden of persuading the court that the challenged conduct cannot \nreasonably  be  expected  to  start  up  again  lies  with  the  party \nId\nasserting mootness.”  . at 189.  \n  The Attorney General does not specifically argue mootness, \nWhitmore v. Arkansas\nbut cites  , 495 U.S. 149, 157–58 (1990), for \n \n- 18 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 19 of 47 PageID #:2921\nthe proposition that for a court to have jurisdiction the injury \nalleged in the complaint must be “certainly impending.” To support \nthis,  Defendant  notes  that  DOJ  would  need  to  give  Chicago \n“specific, formal, written notice of DOJ’s intent” to re-start \nenforcement of the additional certification requirement and argues \nthat such a development is “speculative” to begin with. (Def.’s \nLos Angeles v. Lyons\nMot. at 22.) In  , 461 U.S. 95 (1983), the \nSupreme Court held that a plaintiff lacked standing to seek an \ninjunction against the enforcement of a police chokehold policy \nbecause he could not credibly allege that he faced a realistic \nthreat from the policy. However, the Supreme Court explained that \na  citywide  moratorium  on  police  chokeholds  would  not  moot  “an \notherwise  valid  claim  for  injunctive  relief,  because  the \nFriends of the Earth, \nmoratorium by its terms was not permanent.” \nInc. Lyons\n, 528 U.S. at 190 (citing  , 461 U.S. at 101). Here, DOJ’s \nnotice is by its own terms impermanent. Indeed, DOJ has not offered \nany  evidence  about  what  “specific,  formal,  written  notice” \nentails, and there is no reason to believe that if the litigation \nwere terminated today the DOJ could not reimpose the conditions \ntomorrow. As a result, the Attorney General has not met his heavy \nburden of persuading the Court that his voluntary cessation moots \nthis issue.   \n \n- 19 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 20 of 47 PageID #:2921\n  Accordingly,  Defendant’s  Motion  to  Dismiss  Plaintiff’s \nchallenge to the additional certification requirement on account \nof standing or mootness is denied.  \nD.  APA Claims (Counts I, II, III, and VII) \n  Next, the Attorney General moves to dismiss Counts I, II, \nIII, and VII on the basis that they rely on the APA, but there is \nno final agency action for Chicago to challenge. As the Court \nexplained in its summary judgment opinion, two things must be true \nfor an agency action to be considered final. “First, the action \nmust  mark  the  ‘consummation’  of  the  agency’s  decision  making \nprocess—it  must  not  be  of  a  merely  tentative  or  interlocutory \nnature. And second, the action must be one by which ‘rights or \nobligations  have  been  determined,’  or  from  which  ‘legal \nBennett v. Spear\nconsequences will flow.’”  , 520 U.S. 154, 177–78 \n(1997). Chicago asserts, as this Court has held previously, that \nthe  Attorney  General’s  decision  to  impose  the  challenged \nconditions on the JAG funds constitutes final agency action that \nSee City of Chicago\nis ripe for judicial review.  , 321 F. Supp. 3d \nat 866.  \n  According to the Attorney General, imposing the challenged \nconditions on the FY 2018 grants is not a final agency action \nbecause “OJP has issued the City’s FY 2018 Byrne JAG award pursuant \nto court injunctions, [but] the Office has not yet determined to \ngrant or deny the application administratively.” (Def.’s Mot. at \n \n- 20 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 21 of 47 PageID #:2921\n19).  This  contention  is  particularly  unsuitable  because  the \nAttorney General made this precise argument in its briefing before \nthe Court’s last summary judgment decision, and the Court rejected \nSee City of Chicago v. Sessions\nit.   , No. 17-cv-5720 (N.D. Ill.), \nDef.’s Memo., Dkt. 139 (“As there is no dispute that the Department \nhas not yet determined whether to grant FY 2017 Byrne JAG funds to \nthe City, or to deny its pending application, it follows that there \nis, as of yet, no final agency action for this Court to review.”); \nCity of Chicago\n, 321 F. Supp. 3d at 865-66. Although the Court has \nalready ruled on these precise issues, nevertheless it will rule \non them once again.  \n  First, as before, the decision to impose conditions on the \nJAG program is the “end result of [the] decision-making process on \nCity of Chicago\nthis score.”  , 321 F. Supp. 3d at 865. Accepting \nthe grants requires compliance with the conditions, and as a result \nthe “imposition of these Conditions by the Attorney General is far \nId. \nfrom  ‘tentative.’”  As  a  result,  the  first  requirement  for \nSee Bennett\nfinality under the APA is satisfied.  , 520 U.S. at 177–\n78. \n  Moreover,  nothing  has  changed  the  Court’s  analysis  with \nrespect to the second condition. The conditions still “trigger \nimportant legal and practical consequences: They force Chicago to \nchoose between accepting the award with the Conditions or forgoing \nthe award in favor of maintaining the City’s policy preferences.” \n \n- 21 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 22 of 47 PageID #:2921\nCity of Chicago See also Abbs v.

Thus, \nthe second requirement is met. Accordingly, the Court again finds \nthat  the  decision  to  require  compliance  with  the  challenged \nconditions as a condition of accepting Byrne JAG funds constitutes \nfinal agency action that is ripe for judicial review.  \n  The number of courts that have concluded the same has grown \nSee, e.g., City \nsince this Court’s last opinion on this subject. \nof  Los  Angeles  v.

Summary judgment is appropriate \nwhen the movant shows that there is “no genuine dispute as to any \nmaterial fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter \n \n- 22 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 23 of 47 PageID #:2921\nSee \nof law.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 56. A court must construe the facts \nand draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to \nFoley v. City of Lafayette, Ind.\nthe nonmoving party.  , 359 F.3d \n925, 928 (7th Cir. 2004). In ruling on summary judgment, courts do \nAnderson v. Liberty \nnot determine the truth of disputed matters. \nLobby, Inc.\n, 477 U.S. 242, 249 (1986). The Court will begin its \nsummary judgment analysis with the four repeat conditions the City \nis challenging, before turning to the two new conditions in the FY \n2018 grants. \nA.  Four Repeat Conditions \n  There  four  repeat  conditions  are  virtually  identical  to \nconditions that this Court found unlawful in its summary judgment \nruling on the FY 2017 grants. The similarities are evident:  \nThe FY 2018 notice condition, like the FY 2017 notice \ncondition,  requires  local  governments  to  provide \n“advance notice to [federal immigration authorities] of \nthe  scheduled  release  date  and  time  of  a  particular \nSee \nalien” when federal authorities request it. ( Chicago \nFY 2018 Byrne JAG Award.) \n \nThe FY 2018 access condition, like the FY 2017 access \ncondition, requires local governments to permit federal \nimmigration  agents  “access  to  any  State  or  local \ngovernment  (or  government-contracted)  correctional \nfacility… for the purpose [of] interrogat[ing] any alien \nor person believed to be an alien as to his right to be \nSee id\nor remain in the United States.” ( .) \n \nThe FY 2018 Section 1373 compliance condition, like the \nFY 2017 Section 1373 compliance condition, requires that \nthe recipient comply with 8 U.S.C. § 1373(a) and (b), \n \n- 23 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 24 of 47 PageID #:2921\nand  to  execute  a  certification  of  “compliance”  with \nSee id\nthose provisions. ( .) \n \nThe FY 2018 Section 1644 compliance condition requires \nChicago to certify compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1644. This \ncondition was not attached to the FY 2017 grants, but \nSection 1664 is materially identical to Section 1373(b). \nCompare with see \n 8 U.S.C. § 1644   8 U.S.C. § 1373(b); \nalso City & Cty. of San Francisco v. Sessions,\n 372 F. \nSupp. 3d 928, 938 (N.D. Cal. 2019) (noting that “Section \n1644 contains  nearly  identical  language  as Section \n1373”). Defendant recognizes that analysis regarding the \nconstitutionality  of  §  1373  “appl[ies]  equally  to \nSection  1644.”  (Def.’s  Mot.  at  2.)  Accordingly, \nDefendant  refers  to  these  conditions  jointly  as  the \nId\n“Section 1373/1644 compliance conditions.” ( .)  \n \n  Moreover, the Attorney General concedes that the four repeat \nconditions are “very similar” to the FY 2017 notice, access, and \nSection 1373 compliance conditions. (Def.’s Mot. at 2.) Thus, the \nCourt  concludes  that  the  repeat  conditions  are  materially \nidentical to the conditions that this Court has already enjoined. \nSee City & Cty. of San Francisco\n, 372 F. Supp. 3d at 941 (finding \nthat  the  FY  2018  “notice,  access,  and  Section  1373/1644 \ncertification conditions remain essentially the same” as their FY \n2017 counterparts and holding that those repeat conditions are \nunlawful).  \n  The Court has already ruled that each of the repeat conditions \nis unlawful. In its summary judgment opinion on the FY 2017 grants, \nthis  Court  found  that  the  Attorney  General  lacked  statutory \nauthority  to  impose  the  notice  and  access  conditions,  and \n \n- 24 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 25 of 47 PageID #:2921\nconsequently DOJ’s efforts to impose them violated the separation \nultra vires See City of Chicago\nof powers doctrine and were  .  , 321 \nF. Supp. 3d at 874. That decision was bolstered by the Seventh \nCircuit’s holding, in the context of upholding the preliminary \ninjunction, that this Court “did not err in determining that the \nCity established a likelihood of success on the merits of its \ncontention that the Attorney General lacked the authority to impose \nthe  notice  and  access  conditions  on  receipt  of  the  Byrne  JAG \nCity of Chicago . \ngrants.”  , 888 F.3d at 287 It has been further \nbolstered by the Third Circuit’s recent holding that Congress did \nnot empower the Attorney General to enact the notice and access \nSee City of Philadelphia v. Attorney Gen. of United \nprovisions. \nStates\n, 916 F.3d 276, 291 (3d Cir. 2019). Finally, in its 2018 \nsummary judgment ruling, this Court also found that 8 U.S.C. § 1373 \nis  unconstitutional  under  the  anticommandeering  doctrine,  and \nultra vires\naccordingly, the § 1373 compliance condition is   as the \nAuthority General lacks authority to demand compliance with an \nSee City of Chicago\nunconstitutional statute.  , 321 F. Supp. 3d at \n872, 875-76.  \n  The  Attorney  General  does  not  defend  on  the  merits  its \ndecision to re-impose conditions in the FY 2018 grants that this \nCourt found to be unlawful and enjoined. Instead, the Attorney \nGeneral merely states that he “respectfully disagrees with those \nrulings,” and “incorporate[s] . . . the arguments made previously” \n \n- 25 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 26 of 47 PageID #:2921\nin the FY 2017 case. (Def.’s Mot. at 10.) The Attorney General is \npresumably preserving his arguments on the repeat conditions as he \nawaits the Seventh Circuit’s decision in the appeal of this Court’s \nSee Chicago v. Barr\nsummary judgment opinion.  , 18-2885 (7th Cir.). \n  Because  the  Attorney  General  agreed  that  the  four  repeat \nconditions are essentially identical as the condition this Court \nalready declared unlawful and declined to present any new legal \narguments to defend the four repeat conditions, the Court finds \nthat Chicago is entitled to summary judgment on these conditions. \nAs this Court already articulated, the notice and access conditions \nultra vires,\nare   and § 1373 is unconstitutional, rendering the \nultra vires See City of Chicago\n§ 1373 compliance condition  .  , 321 \nF.  Supp.  3d  at  876.  The  Court  grants  summary  judgment  in \nPlaintiff’s favor on Counts I and II with respect to the repeat \nconditions.  \n  Additionally, the Court grants summary judgment in Chicago’s \nfavor on Count IV, in which the City seeks a declaration that \n8 U.S.C. § 1644 violates the Tenth Amendment’s anticommandeering \ndoctrine  and  thus  the  Attorney  General  cannot  impose  the \nSection 1644  compliance  condition  as  a  condition  of  accepting \nByrne  JAG  funds.  The  Attorney  General  concedes  that  8  U.S.C. \n§§ 1373 and 1644 contain essentially identical language, and that \ntherefore  analysis  regarding  the  constitutionality  of  § 1373 \n“appl[ies] equally to Section 1644.” (Def.’s Mot. at 2.) As such, \n \n- 26 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 27 of 47 PageID #:2921\nthe  Court’s  ruling  that  § 1373  violates  the  anticommandeering \nSee City of Chicago\ndoctrine applies equally to § 1644.  , 321 F. \nSupp. 3d at 875-76. 8 U.S.C. § 1644 violates the Tenth Amendment’s \nanticommandeering doctrine and therefore compliance with § 1644 \ncannot be imposed as a condition of accepting Byrne JAG funds. \nB.  Two New Conditions \n1.  Additional certification requirement \n  Chicago moves for summary judgment on its claim, contained in \nultra \nCount I, that the additional certification requirement is \nvires\n. This condition requires the would-be grantee to certify \nthat it is not subject to or bound by any “law, rule, policy, or \npractice” that would “impede the exercise by federal officers of \nauthority” under 8 U.S.C. §§ 1357(a), 1226(a) or (c), 1231(a), or \n1366(1) or (3). (State or Local Government: FY 2018 Certification.) \nThe City argues that the Attorney General lacks authority to impose \nthe  additional  certification  requirement  as  a  condition  for \nreceiving grant funding.  \n  It is well established that the “power of the purse does not \nCity of Chicago v. Sessions\nbelong to the Executive Branch.”  , 888 \nF.3d 272, 283 (7th Cir. 2018). The Executive possesses “no inherent \nauthority as to the grant at issue here to condition the payment \nof such federal funds on adherence to its political priorities.” \nId.  See \nSpending is instead the domain of Congress.  U.S. Const. \nArt. I § 8. If the Executive has spending power, it is because \n \n- 27 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 28 of 47 PageID #:2921\nCongress  delegated  that  authority.  Therefore,  whether  the \nadditional certification requirement is proper depends on whether \nCongress  delegated  authority  to  the  Attorney  General  through \nSee Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass’ns\nstatute to impose it.  , 531 U.S. \nCity of Arlington, Tex. v. F.C.C.\n457, 472 (2001);  , 569 U.S. 290, \n297  (2013)  (“[F]or  agencies  charged  with  administering \ncongressional statutes … the power to act and how they are to act \nis authoritatively prescribed by Congress, so that when they act \n.”\nimproperly… what they do is ultra vires ). Accordingly, the Court \nmust look to federal statute to determine the Attorney General’s \nauthority to impose the additional certification requirement.  \n  Statutory interpretation begins with the plain language of \nUnited States v. Berkos\nthe statute.  , 543 F.3d 392, 396 (7th Cir. \n2008). A court must “assume that the legislative purpose [of the \nstatute] is expressed by the ordinary meaning of the words used.” \nId\n. (citations omitted). Absent clearly expressed Congressional \nintent to the contrary, the plain language should be conclusive. \nId\n. The language and design of the statute as a whole may also \nprovide  guidance  in  determining  the  plain  meaning  of  its \nId\nprovisions.  .  \n  In  this  round  of  briefing,  DOJ  presented  no  arguments \nregarding  the  source  of  its  statutory  authority  to  impose  the \nadditional certification requirement, and for that reason seems to \nSee Bloch v. Frischholz\nhave conceded the point.  , 587 F.3d 771, \n \n- 28 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 29 of 47 PageID #:2921\n784  (7th  Cir.  2009)  (arguments  not  developed  during  summary \n \njudgment are waived). Regardless, because of the importance of the \nconstitutional principles at issue in this case, the Court will \nperform the relevant analysis to determine whether there is indeed \na statutory basis for the Attorney General’s authority to impose \nthe additional certification requirement.  \n  The Byrne JAG statute itself, codified at 34 U.S.C. §§ 10151–\n10158, does not grant the Attorney General authority to impose the \nadditional certification requirement. The Seventh Circuit has held \nthat the Byrne JAG statute does not grant the Attorney General \n“the authority to impose conditions that require states or local \ngovernments to assist in immigration enforcement, nor to deny funds \nto states or local governments for the failure to comply with those \nCity of Chicago\nconditions.”  , 888 F.3d at 284. Indeed, the Attorney \nGeneral’s ability to depart from the funding distribution formula \nCity of \nmandated by 34 U.S.C. § 10156 is “strictly circumscribed.” \nChicago\n, 888 F.3d at 286. Thus, the Byrne JAG statute cannot be \nthe source of authority. The City has identified two potential \nstatutory sources of authority based on the Attorney General’s \nbriefing in earlier iterations of this case, and the Court will \nconsider those sources in turn.  \n  In the FY 2017 Byrne JAG case, the Attorney General argued \nthat his authority to impose conditions on the Byrne JAG funds \ncame from 34 U.S.C. § 10102(a)(6). 34 U.S.C. § 10102(a) sets forth \n \n- 29 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 30 of 47 PageID #:2921\nthe  specific,  delegated,  and  general  powers  of  the  Assistant \nAttorney  General  (“AAG”)  for  the  Office  of  Justice  Programs, \nincluding  the  authority  to  place  “special  conditions  on  all \ngrants.” 34 U.S.C. § 10102(a). As the Court will detail in the \nnext section, this is not a valid source of statutory authority to \nimpose the additional certification requirement.  \n  The other potential source of statutory authority is 34 U.S.C. \n§ 10153(A)(5)(D), a section of the Byrne JAG statute that allows \nthe  Attorney  General  to  require  grant  recipients  certify \ncompliance with “all other applicable Federal laws.” This Court \nhas interpreted this statute to mean what it “literally says.” \nCity of Chicago Ali v. Fed. Bureau \n, 321 F. Supp. 3d at 875 (citing \nof  Prisons\n,  552  U.S.  214,  228  (2008)).  It  declined  to  adopt \nChicago’s narrow reading of the statute, which would limit the \nreach of “all other applicable Federal laws” to mean federal laws \nId.\n“applicable to federal grantees generally.”   Instead, the Court \nadopted Defendant’s plain-meaning interpretation of the statute \nand meant that “applicable Federal laws” meant “any federal law \nId.   see  also  City  of  Chicago  v. \nthat  applies  to  Chicago.”  ;\nSessions\n, 264 F. Supp. 3d 933, 945 (N.D. Ill. 2017) (“Congress \ncould  expect  an  entity  receiving  federal  funds  to  certify  its \ncompliance  with  federal  law…  the  entity  is—independent  of \nreceiving federal funds—obligated to comply.”).  \n \n- 30 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 31 of 47 PageID #:2921\n  Chicago argues that it is not obliged to comply with the \nstatutes listed in the additional certification requirement (let \nalone be prohibited from having any laws or policies that “impede” \nenforcement of these statutes) because these statutes do not apply \nto cities and localities but instead are applicable only to the \nfederal  government.  This  argument  is  well  taken.  The  statutes \nenumerated in the additional certification requirement—8 U.S.C. \n§§ 1226(a) and (c), 1231(a), 1357(a), and 1366(1) and (3)—deal \nwith the federal government’s authority and obligation to arrest \nand detain criminal aliens, remove criminal aliens, interrogate \naliens and perform other investigatory actions without a warrant, \nand submit reports to Congressional committees, respectively. None \nof these statutes require cities or localities to do anything—they \napply only to the federal government and as a result, the Attorney \nGeneral  cannot  require  Chicago  to  “comply”  with  them.  It  is \nCongress’ job to attach such conditions to the receipt of federal \ngrants, and the Executive cannot unilaterally attach conditions to \nthe receipt of grant funding without express authorization from \n. City of Chicago  \nCongress   , 888 F.3d at 286. This power has not \nbeen delegated, and thus the additional certification requirement \nultra  vires\nis  .  The  Court  grants  Chicago’s  Motion  for  Summary \nJudgment as to the additional certification requirement.  \n \n- 31 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 32 of 47 PageID #:2921\n2.  Harboring condition \n  The Attorney General asserts that Chicago’s challenges to the \nharboring  condition  (contained  in  Counts  I,  II,  III,  and  VII) \nshould be dismissed for failure to state a claim, while the City \nmoves for summary judgment on those same counts. The harboring \ncondition  prohibits  grant  recipients  from  making  any  “public \ndisclosure… of any federal law enforcement information in a direct \nor indirect attempt to conceal, harbor, or shield from detection \nany fugitive from justice under 18 U.S.C. ch. 49, or any alien who \nhas come to, entered, or remains in the United States in violation \nof 8 U.S.C. ch. 12—without regard to whether such disclosure would \nconstitute (or could form a predicate for) a violation of 18 U.S.C. \n1071 or 1072 or of 8 U.S.C. 1324(a).” (Chicago FY 2018 Byrne JAG \nAward.)  Chicago  contends  that  Congress  did  not  authorize  the \nAttorney General to impose the harboring condition, rendering it \nultra  vires\n  and  a  violation  of  the  separation  of  powers.  The \nAttorney  General  contends  that  his  authority  to  impose  the \nharboring condition is found in 34 U.S.C. § 10102(a).  \n  First,  the  Attorney  General  asserts  that  34  U.S.C. \n§§ 10102(a)(2)  and  (a)(4)  provide  authority  to  impose  the \nharboring condition. These sections require the AAG to “maintain \nliaison with the executive and judicial branches of the Federal \nand State governments in matters relating to criminal justice,” \nand  “maintain  liaison  with  public  and  private  educational  and \n \n- 32 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 33 of 47 PageID #:2921\nresearch  institutions,  State  and  local  governments,  and \ngovernments  of  other  nations  relating  to  criminal  justice.” \n34 U.S.C.  §§ 10102(a)(2),  (a)(4).  Citing  to  Merriam-Webster’s \nDictionary, Defendant notes that “liaison” is defined as “a close \nbond or connection” or “a person who establishes and maintains \ncommunication for mutual understanding and cooperation.” From this \ndefinition, the Attorney General concludes that Congress charged \nthe AAG with facilitating cooperation between federal and state \ncriminal justice authorities—thus conferring a grant of authority \nthat “encompasses… protecting the confidentiality of federal law \nenforcement  information  provided  to  state  and  local  agencies.” \n(Def.’s Mot. at 12.) \n  The plain language of §§ 10102(a)(2) and (a)(4) simply does \nnot support the Attorney General’s interpretation. The relevant \nlanguage  requires  the  AAG  to  “maintain  liaison  with…  State \ngovernments in matters relating to criminal justice.” 34 U.S.C. \n§ 10102(a)(2). Nothing in this language indicates a delegation of \nauthority to place the harboring condition on Byrne JAG grantees. \nSections  10102(a)(2)  and  (a)(4)  are  more  plausibly  read  as  an \ninstruction for the AAG to maintain bilateral communications or \nSee \nact as a point of contact with state and local governments. \nCity & Cty. of San Francisco v. Sessions\n, 372 F. Supp. 3d 928, 944 \n(N.D. Cal. 2019). Here, the Court agrees with the Northern District \nof  California’s  analysis  of  this  same  argument—that  court \n \n- 33 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 34 of 47 PageID #:2921\nconcluded that DOJ put “far more weight on ‘maintain liaison’ than \nSee id.\nit can hold.”   at 943-45 (holding that the AAG’s duty to \n“maintain liaison” in criminal justice matters does not confer \nauthority for DOJ to impose the harboring condition). The duty to \n“maintain liaison… in matters relating to criminal justice” does \nnot venture into the authority to impose funding conditions related \nto immigration enforcement. And the harboring condition goes far \nbeyond  the  authority  that  the  Attorney  General  claims  to  have \nderived  from  §§ 10102(a)(2)  and  (a)(4)—to  protect  the \nconfidentiality of federal law enforcement information provided to \nstate and local agencies. It prohibits disclosure of federal law \nenforcement information related to “a direct or indirect attempt” \nto harbor not just “fugitives of justice” but also “any alien.” \nThe language seeks “the broadest coverage possible” by its use of \nthe term “indirect attempt,” which “has no boundary” and would \nCity & Cty. of San \npresumably up for interpretation by the AAG. \nFrancisco\n, 372 F. Supp. 3d at 945. Such sweeping authority is \nhardly implicit in the AAG’s responsibility to communicate with \nand disseminate criminal justice information to various state and \nlocal entities.   \n  Moreover,  as  the  Seventh  Circuit  has  noted,  Sections \n10102(a)(1)-(5) “address the communication and coordination duties \nCity of Chicago\nof the Assistant Attorney General.”  , 888 F.3d at \nSee City of \n285.

Especially  given  the  “strictly \ncircumscribed”  nature  of  the  Byrne  JAG  program—the  Byrne  JAG \nstatute  “precisely  describes  the  formula  through  which  funds \nshould be distributed to states and local governments, and imposes \nprecise limits on the extent to which the Attorney General can \ndeviate from that distribution”—it would be “inconceivable” that \nCongress would have anticipated that the AAG could abrogate that \ndistribution scheme and deny funds to localities based on a new \nSee City of Chicago\ncondition related to harboring aliens.  , 888 \nF.3d at 286. After all, Congress “does not alter the fundamental \ndetails  of  a  regulatory  scheme  in  vague  terms  or  ancillary \nprovisions—it  does  not,  one  might  say,  hide  elephants  in \nCity of Chicago Gonzales v. \nmouseholes.”  , 888 F.3d at 287 (citing \nOregon\n, 546 U.S. 243, 267 (2006)). Thus, the structure and design \nof the statute as a whole does not support the contention that \n“maintain liaison” provides authority for the Attorney General to \nimpose the harboring condition. Accordingly, this argument fails.  \n  Second,  the  Attorney  General  contends  that  § 10102(a)(6) \nsupplies him with the requisite authority to impose the harboring \n \n- 35 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 36 of 47 PageID #:2921\ncondition. Section 10102(a)(6) states that the AAG shall “exercise \nsuch other powers and functions as may be vested in the Assistant \nAttorney General pursuant to this chapter or by delegation of the \nincluding  placing  special  conditions  on  all \nAttorney  General, \ngrants, and determining priority purposes for formula grants\n.” 34 \nU.S.C. § 10102(a)(6) (emphasis added). The italicized language, \nDefendant contends, confers the requisite authority.  \n  The Seventh Circuit and this Court have already considered \nand rejected this argument. As Defendant well knows, in holding \nthat Chicago had established a likelihood of success on the merits \nof its contention that the Attorney General lacked the authority \nto impose the FY 2017 notice and access conditions, the Seventh \nCircuit characterized Section 10102(a)(6) as follows:  \n[Section] 10102(a)(6) is a catch-all provision, simply \nrecognizing that the Assistant Attorney General can also \nexercise such other powers and functions as may be vested \nthrough  other  sources—either  in  that  Chapter  or  by \ndelegation from the Attorney General. … A clause in a \ncatch-all provision at the end of a list of explicit \npowers would be an odd place indeed to put a sweeping \npower to impose any conditions on any grants—a power \nmuch more significant than all of the duties and powers \nthat precede it in the listing, and a power granted to \nthe Assistant Attorney General that was not granted to \nthe  Attorney  General.  …  [T]he  Attorney  General’s \nargument  is  that  the  “including”  clause  itself  is  a \nstand-alone grant of authority to the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral to attach any conditions to any grants in that \nsubchapter  or  other  subchapters  even  though  that \nauthority is not otherwise provided in the chapter and \nis not possessed by the Attorney General. Because that \n \n- 36 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 37 of 47 PageID #:2921\ninterpretation  is  so  obviously  belied  by  the  plain \nmeaning of the word “including,” the Attorney General’s \nposition is untenable. \n \nCity of Chicago\n, 888 F.3d at 285. The Attorney General does not \nexplain why the Seventh Circuit’s analysis of § 10102(a)(6) in the \ncontext of the notice and access conditions should not equally \napply  to  the  harboring  condition.  Defendant  is  not  free  to \ndisregard the Seventh Circuit’s rulings in its briefings before \nthis Court. The Seventh Circuit has already held that the statutory \ntext of § 10102, and the structure of relevant statutes, supports \nthe  conclusion  that  § 10102(a)(6)  does  not  give  the  AG  broad \nauthority to impose even reasonable conditions on Byrne JAG grants. \nSee City of Chicago\n, 888 F.3d at 287. Accordingly, the harboring \ncondition exceeds DOJ’s statutory authority, and the Court grants \nsummary judgment in Chicago’s favor on Counts I and II. \n  The City proposes additional arguments as to why the harboring \ncondition  violates  the  Spending  Clause  and  is  arbitrary  and \ncapricious  under  the  APA.  However,  as  the  Court  found  before, \ngranting summary judgment on Counts I, II, and IV affects the \nCity of Chicago\nbalance of Chicago’s claims.  , 321 F. Supp. 3d at \n876. The Court need not delve into the arguments regarding the \nSpending  Clause  or  whether  this  condition  is  arbitrary  and \ncapricious, as it has already held that Plaintiff is entitled to \nultra \nsummary judgment on the basis of the harboring clause being \n \n- 37 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 38 of 47 PageID #:2921\nvires\n. Thus, Counts III and VII are dismissed as moot. Count V, in \nwhich Chicago requests a declaration that the City complies with \n8 U.S.C. § 1644, is also moot because the Court has declared § 1644 \nId\nunconstitutional.  . at 876.   \nIV.  INJUNCTION \nWith the merits decided, the Court turns to Chicago’s request \nfor a permanent injunction. As a reminder, in 2018 this Court \nissued a permanent national injunction prohibiting Defendant from \nimposing  the  notice,  access,  and  Section 1373  compliance \nconditions on the FY 2017 Byrne JAG funds. (Final Judgment and \nChicago  v.  Sessions  \nOrder,  , No.  17-cv-5720  (N.D.  Ill.),  Dkt. \nNo. 212.)  However,  at  the  time  the  Court  issued  the  permanent \ninjunction, the Seventh Circuit had stayed the nationwide scope of \nen banc \nthe preliminary injunction entered in this case pending an \nrehearing. Accordingly, the Court stayed the nationwide scope of \nthat  injunction.  Thus,  the  permanent  injunction  regarding  the \nnotice, access, and Section 1373 compliance conditions currently \napplies only to the FY 2017 funds and Chicago. \n  The City now seeks a permanent injunction that prohibits the \nAttorney General from imposing the challenged conditions—the four \nrepeat conditions as well as the harboring condition and additional \ncertification requirement—in all future years of the Byrne JAG \nprogram. Chicago seeks a “program-wide” injunction—that is, one \nthat is nationwide in scope. The Court will first consider whether \n \n- 38 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 39 of 47 PageID #:2921\nthe City is entitled to a permanent injunction and then turn to \nthe scope of said injunction. \nA.  Permanent Injunction \n  The Court may issue permanent injunctive relief if the moving \nparty demonstrates: \n(1) that it has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that \nremedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are \ninadequate  to  compensate  for  that  injury;  (3)  that, \nconsidering  the  balance  of  hardships  between  the \nplaintiff  and  defendant,  a  remedy  in  equity  is \nwarranted; and (4) that the public interest would not be \ndisserved by a permanent injunction. \n \neBay Inc. v. MercExchange, LLC\n, 547 U.S. 388, 391 (2006).  \n  The  Attorney  General  does  not  engage  with  these  four \nrequirements in its briefing. Instead, he only argues that any \ninjunction the Court issues should be limited to Chicago—or, if \nthe Court issues a national injunction, its application beyond \nChicago should be stayed pending the Seventh Circuit’s decision in \nChicago v. Barr\n.  Thus, it appears to the Court that the Attorney \nGeneral does not object to a permanent injunction of the challenged \nconditions. Regardless, Chicago carries the burden to demonstrate \nthat it is entitled to a permanent injunction, so the Court will \nproceed with its analysis without any specific objections from the \nAttorney General. \n  As  for  the  first  and  second  requirements,  Chicago  has \ndemonstrated that it has suffered an irreparable injury for which \nno available remedies at law can compensate. The City has again \n \n- 39 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 40 of 47 PageID #:2921\nsubmitted  an  affidavit  from  Chicago  Police  Department  (“CPD”) \nLieutenant Kevin Hannigan, who explains that if the City complies \nwith the challenged conditions, undocumented immigrants will be \nless  likely  to  interact  and  cooperate  voluntarily  with  local \npolice,  believing  that  such  contacts  could  put  them  or  their \nSee\nfamilies at risk of deportation. (  Hannigan Decl., Dkt. No. 54.) \nLieutenant Hannigan, who has served in the CPD for thirty years, \nexplains that trust between CPD and immigrant communities would be \n“badly damaged” if CPD was seen as “proactive enforcers of federal \ncivil immigration rules, or volunteering to help ICE prosecute \ncivil immigration enforcement actions against non-violent, law-\nId\nabiding citizens.” ( . ¶ 6.) As this Court has found before, this \nloss of trust is an irreparable harm for which no adequate remedy \nSee City of Chicago\nat law.  , 321 F. Supp. 3d at 877–78 (citing \nGateway E. Ry. Co. v. Terminal R.R. Ass’n of St. Louis\n, 35 F.3d \n1134, 1140 (7th Cir. 1994) (finding that loss of goodwill can \nqualify as an irreparable harm for which there is no adequate \nSee \nremedy at law)). Money damages cannot remedy a loss of trust. \nCity of Chicago\n, 888 F.3d at 291 (“Such trust, once destroyed by \nthe  mandated  cooperation  and  communication  with  the  federal \nimmigration  authorities,  would  not  easily  be  restored.”). \nMoreover, a constitutional injury alone can constitute irreparable \nSee City of Chicago\nharm.  , 321 F. Supp. 3d at 878 (citing 11A \nWright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure § 2948.1 (2d ed. \n \n- 40 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 41 of 47 PageID #:2921\n1995) (“When an alleged deprivation of a constitutional right is \ninvolved, most courts hold that no further showing of irreparable \ninjury is necessary.”)). Chicago faces such an injury here, as the \nAttorney General subjects the City’s receipt of Byrne JAG funding \non unconstitutionally imposed conditions. Accordingly, Chicago has \ndemonstrated  the  first  two  required  elements  for  a  permanent \ninjunction.   \n  Third, the balance of hardships weighs in the City’s favor. \nAs the Seventh Circuit explained, the harm the Attorney General \nsuffers  from  an  injunction  is  minimized  because  “the  Attorney \nGeneral can distribute the funds without mandating the conditions—\nas has been done for over a decade—and nothing in the injunction \nprevents any state or local government from coordinating its local \nCity of Chicago\nlaw enforcement with the federal authorities.”  , \n888 F.3d at 291. Importantly, the Court has found the challenged \nconditions  to  be  unlawful,  and  the  Attorney  General  cannot \nplausibly  argue  that  being  prevented  from  imposing  unlawful \nconditions would present a hardship. As this Court has already \nexplained, the injunction “does not strip away any option [the \nCity of Chicago\nAttorney General] could [lawfully] exercise.”  , 321 \nF. Supp. 3d at 878–79. On the other hand, the impact on Chicago if \nCity \nforced to comply with the conditions would be “devastating.” \nof Chicago\n, 888 F.3d at 291. Either Chicago would have to accept \nthe  funds  with  the  unlawful  conditions  attached,  damaging  its \n \n- 41 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 42 of 47 PageID #:2921\nrelationship with its immigrant communities and its crime fighting \ncapabilities, or Chicago would have to decline the funds entirely. \nThe City intends to use the FY 2018 funds to increase its Bureau \nof Detectives’ capacity to clear violent cases and bring shooters \nSee \nto justice. ( Am. Compl. ¶ 40.) Without the FY 2018 Byrne JAG \nfunds, Chicago will not be able to carry out that initiative as \nplanned.  Thus,  the  continued  application  of  the  challenged \nconditions would cause Chicago hardship by unlawfully blocking it \nfrom funds it could otherwise accept—as it has since 2005—without \ngrievance.  \n  Fourth  and  finally,  the  public  interest  is  served  by  a \npermanent injunction in this case. As before, the Court has found \nthat  the  Attorney  General  failed  to  administer  the  Byrne  JAG \nprogram  in  conformance  with  the  limited  statutory  authority \nCongress affords him. As the Seventh Circuit recently reminded in \nthis case, the judiciary must act as a check on usurpation of power \nby the Executive Branch, and “jealously guard” the separation of \nCity of Chicago\npowers.  , 888 F.3d at 277. Enjoining the unlawful \nconditions  and  checking  the  Executive’s  encroachment  of \nSee \ncongressional power undoubtedly serves the public interest. \nGordon  v.  Holder,\n  721  F.3d  638,  653  (D.C.  Cir.  2013) \n(“[E]nforcement of an unconstitutional law is always contrary to \nthe public interest.”). \n \n- 42 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 43 of 47 PageID #:2921\n  Thus,  Chicago  has  demonstrated  all  four  requirements  for \npermanent  injunctive  relief.  Accordingly,  the  Court  finds  that \npermanent injunctive relief is warranted as to DOJ’s imposition of \nthe challenged conditions.  \nB.  Scope of Injunction \n  The Court turns to its assessment of the appropriate scope of \nthe  injunction.  As  the  Third  Circuit  recently  observed  in  a \nparallel case, “[w]hile there are tried and true standards for \nwhen \ndetermining  equitable  relief  is  warranted, there  is  less \nscope City  of \nauthority  regarding  the   of equitable  relief.” \nPhiladelphia v. Attorney Gen. of United States\n, 916 F.3d 276, 291–\n92  (3d  Cir.  2019).  This  is  because  “when  district  courts  are \nproperly acting as courts of equity, they have discretion unless \nUnited States v. Oakland \na statute clearly provides otherwise.” \nCannabis Buyers’ Co-op.\n, 532 U.S. 483, 496 (2001). The scope of \ninjunctive  relief  is  dictated  by  the  extent  of  the  violation \nCalifano  v.  Yamasaki\nestablished.  ,  442  U.S.  682,  702  (1979). \nInjunctive relief should be “no more burdensome to the defendant \nId\nthan necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.”  . \nWhen  a  court  believes  the  underlying  right  to  be  highly \nsignificant, “it may write injunctive relief as broad as the right \nZamecnik v. Indian Prairie Sch. Dist. No. 204\nitself.”  , 636 F.3d \nLaw  of \n874,  879  (7th  Cir.  2011)  (citing  1  Dan  B.  Dobbs, \nRemedies\n § 2.4(6), p. 113 (2d ed. 1993)).  \n \n- 43 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 44 of 47 PageID #:2921\n \n  The Court’s last injunction was limited to the FY 2017 Byrne \nJAG program in the hope that DOJ would not re-impose its unlawful \nconditions. It did. To this end, Chicago petitions the Court to \nenjoin the imposition of the challenged conditions not just in the \nall\nFY 2018 Byrne JAG funds, but in   future years of the Byrne JAG \nprogram. The Attorney General offers no opinion on the subject. \n  Given the extent of the violation established, and DOJ’s track \nrecord in this litigation, an injunction that covers all future \nyears of the Byrne JAG program is appropriate. The nature of injury \nhere—a violation of the separation of powers doctrine—is highly \nSee City of Chicago v. Sessions\nsignificant.  , 888 F.3d 272, 277 \n(7th Cir. 2018) (“The founders of our country well understood that \nthe  concentration  of  power  threatens  individual  liberty  and \nestablished a bulwark against such tyranny by creating a separation \nof powers among the branches of government. If the Executive Branch \ncan  determine  policy,  and  then  use  the  power  of  the  purse  to \nmandate  compliance  with  that  policy  by  the  state  and  local \ngovernments, all without the authorization or even acquiescence of \nelected legislators, that check against tyranny is forsaken.”). \nUnless the Seventh Circuit overturns this Court’s summary judgment \nopinion, it will never be permissible for the Attorney General to \nimpose the challenged conditions on Chicago. And importantly in \nthis equitable consideration, the Attorney General has shown a \n \n- 44 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 45 of 47 PageID #:2921\nwillingness to impose unlawful conditions in the next round of \nByrne  JAG  program  administration,  despite  an  injunction \nprohibiting those same conditions in the previous year. This action \nhas imposed a serious cost on the City, as it had to initiate new \nlitigation after the Attorney General again imposed the four repeat \nconditions on the FY 2018 grants. Indeed, DOJ recently released \nthe  Byrne  JAG  Solicitation  for  FY  2019,  which  again  contains \nSee\nseveral of the challenged conditions. (  Byrne JAG Grant FY 2019 \nLocal Solicitation, Ex. 1 to Pl.’s Mot. to Cite Supp. Authority, \nDkt. No. 75-1.) Thus, it is apparent to the Court that entering an \ninjunction  regarding  all  future  JAG  funds  is  the  only  way  to \nprevent Chicago from being forced to litigate the Byrne JAG funding \nconditions every year. Enjoining the unlawful conditions for all \nfuture  program  years  is  an  appropriate  remedy  based  on  the \nviolation established.  \n  Next,  the  Court  must  determine  the  only  aspect  of  the \ninjunction that the Attorney General actually contests: whether \nthe injunction should be limited to Chicago and its sub-grantees, \nor  nationwide  in  scope.  The  scope  of  the  FY  2017  permanent \ninjunction—national but stayed as to its application outside of \nChicago—is currently on appeal before the Seventh Circuit. Yet \ndistrict  court  proceedings  do  not  freeze  while  an  appeal  is \nSee City of Chicago City & Cty. \npending.  , 321 F. Supp. 3d at 879; \nof San Francisco v. Sessions\n, 372 F. Supp. 3d at 954 (issuing a \n \n- 45 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 80 Filed: 09/19/19 Page 46 of 47 PageID #:2921\npermanent injunction as to FY 2018 Byrne JAG conditions while the \ncourt’s decision on 2017 Byrne JAG conditions was still on appeal). \nAnd there have been no changes in facts or law since the FY 2017 \npreliminary and permanent injunction rulings that would shift this \nCourt’s understanding of the propriety of a nationwide injunction \nin this case. Unless the Seventh Circuit reverses, this Court will \nnot  depart  from  its  earlier  analysis,  which  will  preserve  the \nstatus quo and the integrity of the pending appeal.  \n  Accordingly,  the  Court  will  again  issue  a  permanent \nnationwide  injunction  as  to  all  six  challenged  conditions. \nHowever, in deference to the Seventh Circuit’s pending decision on \nthe issue of nationwide injunctions in this case, the Court will \nagain stay the nationwide scope of the permanent injunction. Stays \nare “necessary to mitigate the damage that can be done during the \ninterim period before a legal issue is finally resolved on its \nIn re A & F \nmerits. The goal is to minimize the costs of error.” \nEnters., Inc. II see also City \n, 742 F.3d 763, 766 (7th Cir. 2014); \n&  Cty.  of  San  Francisco\n,  372  F.

Chicago brings this action to enjoin the Attorney General of the United States \nfrom yet again imposing sweeping immigration policy conditions on the Edward Byrne \nMemorial Justice Assistance Grant (“Byrne JAG”) program, a formula grant that has for years \nprovided crucial support for law enforcement in Chicago and other cities.  The challenged \nconditions are unauthorized by Congress and ultra vires, and violate federalism principles.  They \nare an unlawful attempt to punish Chicago for prioritizing public safety for all Chicagoans \ninstead of yielding to federal dictates.  In fact, this Court struck down many of the conditions \nalready, issuing a permanent injunction just months ago preventing the conditions from being \napplied to last year’s Byrne JAG grants.  But now, despite the Court’s clear ruling that the \nconditions are unlawful, and its clear warning that re-issuing them could result in an award of \nattorney’s fees against the federal government, the Attorney General has imposed them again on \n-1- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 2 of 45 PageID #:2\n  \nthe coming year’s grants.  His renewed attempt to conscript Chicago’s police to serve federal \npolicy rather than City policy contravenes the Constitution and federal statutes alike.   \n2.  Since the 1980s, Chicago has adhered to a “Welcoming City” policy that \nprioritizes local crimefighting and community engagement, rather than federal civil immigration \nenforcement.  That policy promotes cooperation between local law enforcement and the diverse \nimmigrant communities that have long flourished in Chicago.  For many years, Chicago’s \nWelcoming City policy has been no obstacle to its receipt of law enforcement funds under the \nByrne JAG formula grant program. \n3.  Despite that long history, last year, the Attorney General tried to use the Byrne \nJAG program to gut Chicago’s Welcoming City policy and others like it.  In July 2017, the \nDepartment of Justice released the FY2017 solicitation for Byrne JAG funding.  The solicitation \ninformed grant applicants that they would be expected to comply with three immigration-related \ngrant conditions.  Those conditions would have required Chicago (1) to detain its own residents \nand others at federal immigration officials’ request, in order to give the federal government a 48-\nhour notice window prior to an arrestee’s release (the “notice condition”); (2) to give federal \nimmigration officials unlimited access to local police stations and law enforcement facilities in \norder to interrogate any suspected non-citizen held there, effectively federalizing all of the City’s \ndetention facilities (the “access condition”); and (3) to certify compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373, \na federal statute that bars local governments from restricting their employees from sharing \ncitizenship and immigration status information with federal immigration authorities (the “Section \n1373 compliance condition”). \n4.  Chicago sued, and this Court (Leinenweber, J.) held the three conditions \nunconstitutional and ultra vires and set them aside.  The Court first issued a preliminary \n-2- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 3 of 45 PageID #:3\n  \ninjunction against the notice and access conditions that was affirmed by the Seventh Circuit.  \nThen, in July 2018, the Court permanently enjoined all three conditions for FY2017.  In its \ndecision on the permanent injunction, the Court held that the notice and access conditions were \nunlawful because, consistent with the Seventh Circuit’s ruling, no statute authorized the Attorney \nGeneral to impose discretionary policy conditions on the Byrne JAG formula grant program, and \nthus his attempt to do so anyway—to usurp Congress’s legislative authority by rewriting basic \naspects the Byrne JAG program—violated the constitutional Separation of Powers.  The Court \nalso held that the Section 1373 compliance condition was unlawful because Section 1373 itself is \nfacially unconstitutional under the Tenth Amendment anti-commandeering doctrine.  The Court \nalso made clear that it would not tolerate any attempt by the Attorney General to circumvent its \nruling by re-imposing the conditions in FY2018.  If the Attorney General re-imposed the \nconditions, the Court noted, Chicago’s “lawyers would get paid.” \n5.  In the face of those rulings, the Attorney General has once again attempted to \npress Chicago’s law enforcement officers into the service of the federal immigration authorities \nby imposing sweeping policy conditions on Byrne JAG formula grant funds—this time, as a \ncondition on FY2018 funds.  Those conditions are unlawful both facially and as applied to \nChicago.   \n6.  In the FY2018 Byrne JAG solicitation, the Department of Justice specifically \nnoted that it would issue awards by September 30, 2018.  In early October 2018, the Department \nbegan releasing FY2018 Byrne JAG award letters.  To date, the Department has issued 752 \nFY2018 local awards, totaling almost $59 million; by contrast, the Department has issued 806 \nlocal awards, worth almost $71 million, for FY2017.  Despite the release of a substantial portion \nof FY2018 funding, the Department has not yet issued Chicago’s award.  \n-3- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 4 of 45 PageID #:4\n  \n7.  Four of the conditions imposed on the FY2018 Byrne JAG grant are materially \nidentical to the FY2017 Byrne JAG conditions this Court has already set aside as unlawful.  \nSpecifically, the Department has again required Byrne JAG recipients and their subgrantees to:  \n(1) comply with 8 U.S.C. § 1373, which this Court already held facially unconstitutional; (2) \ncomply with 8 U.S.C. § 1644, which prohibits the same conduct as Section 1373 and is thus \nunconstitutional under the same reasoning; (3) provide 48 hours’ advance notice to federal \nimmigration authorities, “where feasible” and when requested, before releasing an alien from \ncustody, just like the notice condition that was already set aside as unlawful by this Court; and \n(4) provide federal authorities with “access to any correctional facility in order to meet with an \nalien (or an individual believed to be an alien) and inquire as to his right to be or remain in the \nUnited States,” just like the access condition already set aside by this Court.  Beyond attempting \nto resuscitate the conditions that this Court already held unlawful, the Attorney General has also \nadded a new unlawful condition requiring Chicago and other cities to certify that they will not \npublicly disclose federal law enforcement information in an attempt to conceal, harbor, or shield \nfrom detection fugitives from justice or undocumented immigrants, even where such disclosure \nwould not violate the law.    \n8.  Neither the Byrne JAG statute nor any other statute empowers the Attorney \nGeneral to condition formula grant funds in this manner.  Indeed, most of the conditions the \nAttorney General seeks to impose were already held unlawful by this Court, and Chicago is \nentitled to attorney’s fees and costs because the Attorney General’s unreasonable decision to \nimpose unlawful conditions has forced Chicago to prosecute this action to once again obtain an \ninjunction against them. \n-4- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 5 of 45 PageID #:5\n  \n9.  The law has not changed since this Court ruled:  The Federal Executive may not \narrogate power that the Constitution reserves to Congress on the one hand, or to state and local \ngovernments on the other.  Yet the Attorney General does just that by again imposing on the \nByrne JAG formula grant program policy conditions that were never approved by Congress and \nthat would federalize local jails, mandate warrantless detentions for civil infractions, sow fear in \nlocal immigrant communities, undermine local law, and make the people of Chicago less safe.   \n10.  The Attorney General’s new conditions are just as harmful as those struck down \nby this Court, and in precisely the same ways.  The Attorney General once again seeks to \ncountermand local policies that foster crucial trust between police and immigrant communities, \non pain of denying Chicago crucial funds that provide lifesaving equipment to Chicago police \nofficers and critical services to Chicago residents.  Once again, his sole justification is his \ndisagreement with Chicago’s policy choices.  He does so in the face of this Court’s explicit \nruling last year that his conditions are unlawful and that the harms to Chicago are irreparable and \ncannot be remedied by later payment of the funds at issue.   \n11.  This Court should order injunctive and corresponding declaratory relief and \nshould order the Attorney General to pay fees and costs to Chicago as well.  In order to prevent \nan endless cycle of litigation, in which the Attorney General unlawfully withholds Chicago’s \ngrant funds each year until Chicago sues and the Court intervenes, that relief should cover \nFY2018 and all future grant years.   \n-5- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 6 of 45 PageID #:6\n  \nPARTIES \n12.

The Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1346.  The \nCourt is authorized to issue the relief sought here under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 \nU.S.C. §§ 702, 705, 706, the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651, the mandamus statute, 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1361, the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201, 2202, and the United States \nConstitution. \n15.  Venue is proper in the Northern District of Illinois under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) \nbecause substantial events giving rise to this action occurred therein and because Chicago resides \ntherein and no real property is involved in this action. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nI.  CHICAGO PRIORITIZES LOCAL CRIMEFIGHTING UNDER ITS \nWELCOMING CITY POLICY  \n16.  Chicago is a metropolis of almost 3 million that has attracted migrants and \nimmigrants of every race, nationality, and creed for nearly two centuries.  Chicago’s diverse \npopulation requires a public safety strategy that respects all the City’s residents.  One aspect of \nthat strategy—the Welcoming City Ordinance—has developed over the past few decades.  \n-6- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 7 of 45 PageID #:7\n  \n17.  The first formal iteration of the policy was announced by then-Mayor Harold \nWashington in a 1985 Executive Order that provided that City officials would not “request \ninformation about or otherwise investigate or assist in the investigation of the citizenship or \nresidency status of any person” unless required by other law to do so.  Mayor Richard M. Daley \nreiterated this policy upon taking office in April 1989.   \n18.  In 2006, the Chicago City Council unanimously incorporated the policy into the \nCity’s Municipal Code by enacting the Welcoming City Ordinance.  Among other things, the \nCouncil cited its concern that local enforcement of federal immigration infractions would “cause \na chilling effect on crime prevention and solving if both witnesses and victims are called upon to \nweigh a need to cooperate with local authorities against a fear of deportation, thereby \nundermining long-standing efforts to engender trust and cooperation between law enforcement \nofficials and immigrant communities.”  Like the executive orders that preceded it, the 2006 \nOrdinance prohibited City “agent[s]” and “agenc[ies]” from “request[ing] information about or \notherwise investigat[ing] or assist[ing] in the investigation of the citizenship or residency status \nof any person unless such inquiry or investigation is required by Illinois State Statute, federal \nregulation, or court decision.”  It also barred disclosure of “information regarding the citizenship \nor residency status of any person unless required to do so by legal process . . . .”  \n19.  In 2012, Mayor Rahm Emmanuel and the Chicago City Council expanded the \nWelcoming City Ordinance to address increasing federal requests to detain individuals suspected \nof immigration-related offenses (also known as “immigration holds”) issued by U.S. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”).  The expanded Welcoming City Ordinance \nprovides that Chicago will comply with an immigration hold only when it has an independent \n-7- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 8 of 45 PageID #:8\n  \nreason to believe that the subject poses a threat to public safety, such as if they have an \noutstanding criminal warrant, or have been identified as a gang member.   \n20.  The 2012 Welcoming City Ordinance reflects the City Council’s findings that (1) \n“the cooperation of all persons, both documented citizens and those without documentation \nstatus, is essential to achieve the City’s goals of protecting life and property, preventing crime \nand resolving problems,” (2) “assistance from a person, whether documented or not, who is a \nvictim of, or a witness to, a crime is important to promoting the safety of all [of the City’s] \nresidents,” and (3) “[t]he cooperation of the City’s immigrant communities is essential to prevent \nand solve crimes and maintain public order, safety and security in the entire City.”  Chicago \nMunicipal Code § 2-173-005. \n21.  The current Welcoming City Ordinance, codified as Chapter 2-173 of the Chicago \nMunicipal Code, and the Chicago Police Department’s implementing policy, Special Order S06-\n14-03, contain several key prohibitions relevant to this lawsuit.   \na.  Subject to certain exceptions for certain criminal suspects and gang members,1 \nSection 2-173-042 prohibits City “agent[s]” or “agenc[ies]” from “arrest[ing], \ndetain[ing] or continu[ing] to detain a person solely on the belief that the person is \nnot present legally in the United States, or that the person has committed a civil \nimmigration violation,” or doing so “based upon an immigration detainer, when \nsuch immigration detainer is based solely on a violation of a civil immigration \nlaw.” \n                                                 \n1   Specifically, and as noted above, the Section 2-173-042 restrictions do not apply if the \nsubject of the ICE investigation “(1) has an outstanding criminal warrant; (2) has been convicted \nof a felony in any court of competent jurisdiction; (3) is a defendant in a criminal case in any \ncourt of competent jurisdiction where a judgment has not been entered and a felony charge is \npending; or (4) has been identified as a known gang member.” \n-8- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 9 of 45 PageID #:9\n  \nb.  Subject to the same exceptions, as well as an exception for “legitimate law \nenforcement purpose[s] . . . unrelated to the enforcement of a civil immigration \nlaw,” Section 2-173-042 also prohibits City “agent[s]” or “agenc[ies]” from, \n“while on duty, expend[ing] their time responding to ICE inquiries or \ncommunicating with ICE regarding a person’s custody status or release date,” or \nfrom “permit[ting] ICE agents access to a person being detained by, or in the \ncustody of, the agency or agent” or “permit[ting] ICE agents use of agency \nfacilities for investigative interviews or other investigative purpose.”   \nc.  The prohibitions of Section 2-173-042 are implemented by Chicago Police \nDepartment (“CPD”) Special Order S06-14-03, which contains the same \nprohibitions, subject to the same exceptions, as Section 2-173-042. \nd.  Section 2-173-020 prohibits City “agent[s]” or “agenc[ies]” from “request[ing] \ninformation about or otherwise investigat[ing] or assist[ing] in the investigation of \nthe citizenship or immigration status of any person unless such inquiry or \ninvestigation is required by Illinois State Statute, federal regulation, or court \ndecision.” \ne.  Section 2-173-030 prohibits City “agent[s]” or “agenc[ies]” from “disclos[ing] \ninformation regarding the citizenship or immigration status of any person” unless \n“otherwise provided under applicable federal law,” the City is “required to do so \nby legal process,” or “such disclosure has been authorized in writing by the \nindividual to whom such information pertains.” \n22.  Chicago’s official interpretation of the Welcoming City Ordinance—which was \nexpressly communicated to all City Departments in October 2017—is that the Welcoming City \n-9- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 10 of 45 PageID #:10\n  \nOrdinance is not intended to prohibit or restrict any Chicago entity or official from sending to or \nreceiving from federal immigration authorities information concerning an individual’s \nimmigration status.  Nor is it intended to enable the City to harbor undocumented individuals.  It \nis instead intended to prevent Chicago and its police officers from themselves enforcing federal \nimmigration law.   \n23.  Chicago’s Welcoming City policy plays a vital role in strengthening the \nrelationship between Chicago’s government, its police force, and its immigrant communities.  \nThis relationship is built city block by city block, and it is essential that Chicago’s police officers \nhave the flexibility they need to engage the immigrant communities in their crime-fighting \ninitiatives without projecting a constant threat of deportation.  Social science research has \nconsistently shown that policies like the City’s Welcoming City policy are sound means of \nbuilding trust with immigrant communities and reducing crime.  One recent review of relevant \nliterature concluded that “existing evidence supports the expansion of limited cooperation \npolicies” like Chicago’s Welcoming City Ordinance.2  Another recent study found that “crime is \nstatistically significantly lower in sanctuary counties compared to nonsanctuary counties . . . \ncontrolling for population characteristics.”3  That conclusion is consistent with the lived \nexperience of untold police officers; as a broad coalition of police chiefs explained, “build[ing] \ntrusting and supportive relations with immigrant communities . . . is essential to reducing crime \nand helping victims.”4  By contrast, the idea that policies like Chicago’s encourage crime is a \n                                                 \n2   Daniel E.

Meanwhile, the perception that Chicago’s policies provide amnesty or \n“sanctuary” to violent criminals is also false.  As the Seventh Circuit recognized, Chicago’s \npolicy is designed to avoid local participation in federal immigration enforcement but “does not \ninterfere in any way with the federal government’s lawful pursuit of its civil immigration \nactivities, and presence in such localities will not immunize anyone to the reach of the federal \ngovernment.  The federal government can and does freely operate in ‘sanctuary’ localities.”  City \nof Chicago v. Sessions, 888 F.3d 272, 281 (7th Cir. 2018).  Moreover, Chicago makes exceptions \nto this general non-participation policy for individuals most likely to present a threat to the \ncommunity, such as those with an outstanding criminal warrant and those who are known gang \nmembers.

THE BYRNE JAG PROGRAM, A NON-DISCRETIONARY FORMULA GRANT \nPROGRAM, PROVIDES LAW ENFORCEMENT FUNDING FOR CHICAGO \n25.  Congress created the current Byrne JAG program in 2005 by merging two \nfunding programs for state and local criminal justice initiatives.  H.R. Rep. No. 109-233, at 88-\n89 (2005).  Those predecessor programs afforded state and local governments significant \ndiscretion over their use of program funds.  In combining the programs, Congress sought to give \ngrantees even “more flexibility to spend money for programs that work for them rather than to \nimpose a ‘one size fits all’ solution” for local policing.  Id. \n26.  The Byrne JAG program’s design promotes local discretion by circumscribing the \nAttorney General’s authority to impose federal policy priorities on grantees.  The program \nrequires that the Attorney General “shall allocate” funds, 34 U.S.C. § 10156(d)(2)(A), “in \n                                                 \n5   Benjamin Gonzalez et al., The Politics of Refuge: Sanctuary Cities, Crime, and \nUndocumented Immigration, 9-10, 18-24, Urb. Aff. Rev. (2017), http://tinyurl.com/y8hb9fnc.   \n-11- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 12 of 45 PageID #:12\n  \naccordance with” a formula based on population and crime statistics, id. § 10152(a)(1).  See id. \n§ 10156(d)(2)(A).   \n27.  Consistent with the nature of formula grants, the Byrne JAG statute limits the \nAttorney General’s discretion over the program.  He does not decide the amount of each grant.  \nRather, the Attorney General must follow the statutory formula to determine allotments for each \nstate and local government.  34 U.S.C. § 10156.  As part of this process, the Attorney General is \nauthorized to “reserve not more than 5 percent” of the funds allocated to the program for specific \npurposes after a finding that such reservation is “necessary” to address “extraordinary increases \nin crime” or to “mitigate significant programmatic harm” caused by the formula.  Id. § 10157(b).  \nThe statute authorizes no other deviations from the prescribed formula.   \n28.  The Attorney General’s authority to define or modify the components of the \nByrne JAG application is similarly circumscribed.  He may specify the “form” of the application.  \n34 U.S.C. § 10153(a).  He may specify what “data, records, and information (programmatic and \nfinancial)” applicants can be “reasonably” required to provide to ensure programmatic and \nfinancial integrity.  Id. § 10153(a)(4).  He can “coordinat[e] with the National Institute of \nJustice” to develop a mandatory “program assessment component” to measure the success of \nfunded programs.  Id. § 10152(c).  And he can require applicants to “comply with all provisions \nof this part and all other applicable Federal laws.”  Id. § 10153(a)(5)(D).  There is no provision \nauthorizing him to alter the application’s components, or to add new policy requirements.   \n29.  Byrne JAG applications have only one substantive component:  A plan indicating \nhow the applicant will use its funds within one or more of eight broadly defined programmatic \nareas, 34 U.S.C. § 10153(a)(6), ranging from “[l]aw enforcement” to “[d]rug treatment” to \n“crime victim” support, id. § 10152(a)(1)(A)-(H).  An applicant is entitled to receive its Byrne \n-12- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 13 of 45 PageID #:13\n  \nJAG allotment so long as it uses funds to advance “any one” of those objectives.  Id. \n§§ 10152(a)(1)-(2), 10153(a)(6)(B).   \n30.  Indeed, federal law prohibits the Department of Justice from using the Byrne JAG \nprogram to “exercise any direction, supervision, or control over any police force or any other \ncriminal justice agency of any State or any political subdivision thereof.”  28 U.S.C. § 10228. \n31.  Chicago has received Byrne JAG funds every fiscal year between 2005, the year \nthe program began, and 2017.  In FY2016, Chicago received $2.33 million through the Byrne \nJAG program.  Chicago received its FY2017 award letter, awarding it $2.2 million, on August \n20, 2018 (but, as explained herein, only after litigating for more than a year to enjoin the \nunlawful immigration-related conditions that the Attorney General imposed on the FY2017 \nfunds).   \n32.  Chicago has used Byrne JAG funds to support projects ranging from critical law \nenforcement equipment and overtime to community policing outreach and engagement.  Since \nFY2005, for instance, Chicago has spent approximately $33 million in Byrne JAG funds to buy \nnearly 1,000 police vehicles.  Several of those projects have extended across multiple grant \nyears, including the Force for Good program, which began in 2011 and helps not-for-profit \norganizations meet community needs in neighborhoods experiencing high rates of violent crime, \nby providing services such as emergency shelter and clothing; youth mentoring and safe, \nstructured activities; and job training and placement.  Most recently, Chicago has used Byrne \nJAG funds to pay for ShotSpotter technology, which facilitates rapid police responses to \nshooting incidents.  Without Byrne JAG funds, Chicago would have to restrict or shut down \nsome or all of these programs, or else divert funds from other policing objectives to sustain them.   \n-13- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 14 of 45 PageID #:14\n  \n33.   Chicago plans to use its FY2018 Byrne JAG funds to increase its Bureau of \nDetectives’ capacity to clear violent cases and bring shooters to justice.  Those capacity-building \nefforts include a planned investment in technology that will permit forensic analysis of mobile \ndevices; an initiative to digitize hard-copy records and make them searchable; prioritized case \nand evidence review of homicides, nonfatal shootings, and cold cases to generate new \ninvestigative leads; and advanced interview and investigation training for detectives.  An \nadditional portion of the Byrne JAG funding will support the Force for Good program.     \n34.  Eleven other local governments, including Cook County, the City of Evanston, \nand the Village of Skokie, depend on Chicago’s Byrne JAG application for the funds they \nreceive through the program each year.  Those subgrantees receive their own Byrne JAG funds \nthrough Chicago’s application. \nIII.  THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TARGETS CHICAGO’S BYRNE JAG \nFUNDING \nA.  The Trump Administration Targets So-Called Sanctuary Cities By Executive \nOrder \n35.  Despite the soundness of Chicago’s policies—and despite the City’s sovereign \nright to decide its own law enforcement priorities and strategies—the Trump Administration has \nsingled out Chicago and other so-called “sanctuary” jurisdictions.  In his first week in office, \nPresident Trump issued Executive Order 13768, which threatened to deny federal grants and take \nenforcement actions against such jurisdictions.  President Trump ordered DHS to publish weekly \nlists of any municipalities that refused to comply with immigration hold requests, together with \nlists of any undocumented immigrants arrested—but not necessarily convicted—for any non-\nimmigration offenses.   \n-14- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 15 of 45 PageID #:15\n  \n36.  This executive order was later enjoined in large part—a ruling later affirmed by \nthe Ninth Circuit—for violating the constitutional Separation of Powers.  City and County of San \nFrancisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1234-1235 (9th Cir. 2018).  \nB.  The Trump Administration Targets The Byrne JAG Program  \n37.  The Trump Administration next began targeting the Byrne JAG program.  For the \nFY2017 Byrne JAG application, the Attorney General imposed three conditions on a grantee’s \nability to receive their allotted Byrne JAG funds.  \na.  The “notice” condition:  The FY2017 awards contained a condition requiring \nthat, “when a local-government (or local-government-contracted) correctional \nfacility receives from DHS a formal written request . . . that seeks advance notice \nof the scheduled release date and time for a particular alien in such facility, then \nsuch facility will honor such request and—as early as practicable . . . —provide \nthe required notice to DHS.” \nb.  The “access” condition:  The FY 2017 awards also contained a condition \nrequiring that “agents of the United States acting under color of federal law in \nfact are given access [to] a local-government (or local-government-contracted) \ncorrectional facility for the purpose of permitting such agents to meet with \nindividuals who are (or are believed by such agents to be) aliens and to inquire as \nto such individuals’ right to be or remain in the United States.”     \nc.  The “Section 1373 compliance” condition: In addition to the notice and access \nconditions, the FY2017 awards contained a requirement that the recipient certify \nits compliance with Section 1373.  \n-15- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 16 of 45 PageID #:16\n  \n38.  In August 2017, Chicago sought a preliminary injunction to prevent the Attorney \nGeneral from imposing those conditions on FY2017 Byrne JAG funds, on grounds that the \nconditions were unconstitutional, ultra vires, and arbitrary and capricious.   \n39.  The Attorney General defended the notice and access conditions by arguing that \nthey were authorized by 34 U.S.C. § 10102(a)(6), which endows an Assistant Attorney General \nwith the power to “exercise such other powers and functions as may be vested in the Assistant \nAttorney General pursuant to this chapter or by delegation of the Attorney General, including \nplacing special conditions on all grants.”  He defended the Section 1373 compliance condition \nunder 34 U.S.C. § 10153(a)(5)(D), which permits the Attorney General to require a \n“certification” that “the applicant will comply with all provisions of this part and all other \napplicable Federal laws.”  He defended all three conditions by suggesting they were meant to \nensure that state and local law enforcement would not impair the law-enforcement activities of \nthe federal government, including those federal activities contemplated by 8 U.S.C. §§ 1226(c), \n1231(a)(1)(B), and 1231(a)(4). \n40.  This Court preliminarily enjoined the notice and access conditions, in large part \nbecause the Attorney General “fail[ed] to direct the Court to any textual authority within the \nByrne JAG statute itself” to impose the notice and access conditions.  City of Chicago v. \nSessions, 264 F. Supp. 3d 933, 941 (N.D. Ill. 2017).  The Court did not preliminarily enjoin the \ncompliance condition.  The Attorney General took an interlocutory appeal from the preliminary \ninjunction order, and the Seventh Circuit affirmed, unanimously holding that the notice and \naccess conditions were ultra vires and unlawful and that the Attorney General’s reading of \nSection 10102(a)(6) as authorizing those conditions was “contrary to the plain meaning of the \nstatutory language.”  City of Chicago v. Sessions, 888 F.3d 272, 284 (7th Cir. 2018).   \n-16- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 17 of 45 PageID #:17\n  \n41.  This Court ultimately granted summary judgment in Chicago’s favor on all three \nconditions, concluding in July 2018 that each of the notice, access, and Section 1373 compliance \nconditions was ultra vires and unconstitutional.  See Mem. Op. and Order, City of Chicago v. \nSessions, No. 1:17-cv-05720 (N.D. Ill.), ECF No. 198, at 58 (attached as Ex. A).  On the notice \nand access conditions, the Court adopted “the same reasons stated in [its] preliminary injunction \nruling and the Seventh Circuit’s opinion.”  Id. at 36-37.  On the Section 1373 compliance \ncondition, the Court concluded that, particularly in light of the Supreme Court’s intervening \ndecision in Murphy v. NCAA, 138 S. Ct. 1461 (2018), Section 1373 violated Tenth Amendment \nanti-commandeering principles by tying Chicago’s hands in managing city personnel and city \npolicy.  Id. at 32-34.  Having held Section 1373 unconstitutional, the Court concluded that the \nAttorney General lacked authority to require compliance with Section 1373 as an “applicable \nfederal law” under the Byrne JAG statute.  Id. at 40. \n42.  This Court’s final judgment declared each of the notice, access, and Section 1373 \ncompliance conditions ultra vires and a violation of the constitutional principle of separation of \npowers and set the conditions aside under the Administrative Procedure Act as unlawful.  See \nFinal Judgment and Order, City of Chicago v. Sessions, No. 1:17-cv-05720 (N.D. Ill.), ECF No. \n211, at 2 (attached as Ex. B).  It also permanently enjoined the Attorney General from “denying \nor delaying issuance of any FY 2017 Byrne JAG award insofar as that denial or delay” was \nbased on the notice, access, or compliance condition, and prohibited the Attorney General from \n“using the Conditions in any FY 2017 Byrne JAG award document, delaying the processing or \napproval of a recipient’s requests to draw upon the FY 2017 Byrne JAG funds based on the \nConditions, and enforcing the Conditions against FY 2017 Byrne JAG recipients, regardless of \nwhether those Conditions appeared in FY 2017 Byrne JAG award documents.”  Id. at 3.    \n-17- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 18 of 45 PageID #:18\n  \n43.  During the remedy phase, Chicago expressed concern that the FY2018 Byrne \nJAG grant would contain the same provisions, and asked the Court to issue an injunction \ncovering future grant awards.  The Court declined to do so, but warned that attorney’s fees would \nlikely be appropriate if the Attorney General once again forced Chicago to sue to prevent \nimposition of the same unlawful conditions. \nC.  The Justice Department Expresses Concern That Chicago Does Not Comply \nWith Section 1373 But Refuses To Make A Final Determination \n44.  Because this Court determined that Section 1373 was unconstitutional and thus \nthat the Section 1373 compliance condition was not authorized in the first place, it did not take \nup the question whether Chicago actually complies with Section 1373.  But Chicago has always \nmaintained that it does comply.   \n45.  The Justice Department began requiring Byrne JAG grantees to certify \ncompliance with Section 1373 in FY2016, and Chicago did so at that time.  In a May 2016 report \nby the Department of Justice’s Office of Inspector General, the Department suggested that the \nWelcoming City Ordinance, which prohibits city employees from sharing immigration status \ninformation with federal agents unless “otherwise provided under applicable federal law,” \nChicago Municipal Code § 2-173-030, contains “a potential ambiguity” as to its “proper \nconstruction” such that the “saving clause” contained in the Ordinance might be unclear.   \n46.  Since that report, Chicago has exchanged multiple letters with the Department of \nJustice concerning Chicago’s compliance with Section 1373.  On April 21, 2017, the Department \nsent letters to Chicago and eight other jurisdictions, informing Chicago that it was “required to \nsubmit documentation … that validates that your jurisdiction is in compliance with 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1373.”  Chicago responded in July 2017, explaining that the Ordinance’s “saving clause” in \nfact “makes clear than an individual’s citizenship or immigration status information will not be \n-18- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 19 of 45 PageID #:19\n  \nkept confidential if federal law provides otherwise.”  In October 2017, the Department of Justice \nsent another letter, stating among other things that it had “determined that [Chicago] appears to \nhave laws, policies, or practices that violate 8 U.S.C. § 1373.”  The letter was based on the \npremise that Section 1373 applies not only to the sharing of “information regarding immigration \nstatus,” but also information “regarding a person’s custody status or release date.”   Chicago sent \nanother response, disagreeing with the Department’s interpretation of the relevant statutory text, \nbut reporting that, “[i]n the interest of resolving this issue,” it had sent written notice to City \ndepartment heads “instructing them to share with their officers and employees Chicago’s \ninterpretation of the [Welcoming City Ordinance] and explanation of its compliance with Section \n1373.”  See Letter from Edward Siskel, Corporation Counsel, City of Chicago, to Alan R. \nHanson, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Dep’t of Justice \n(October 27, 2017) (attached as Ex. C).  \n47.  The Department of Justice nevertheless sent Chicago another letter in January \n2018, announcing that “the Department remains concerned that your jurisdiction’s laws, policies, \nor practices may violate section 1373, or, at a minimum, that they may be interpreted or applied \nin a manner consistent with section 1373.”  The letter requested that Chicago produce “[a]ll \ndocuments reflecting any orders, directives, instructions, or guidance to your law enforcement \nemployees …, that were distributed, produced, and/or in effect during the relevant timeframe, \nregarding whether and how these employees may, or may not, communicate” with federal \nagents.  Chicago timely responded to the Department’s request on February 23, 2018 by \nvoluntarily providing the Department with copies of responsive documents.  In the spirit of \ntransparency, Chicago accompanied that response with an expedited FOIA request for \ndocuments related to the Department’s interpretation of Section 1373.   \n-19- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 20 of 45 PageID #:20\n  \n48.  To date, Chicago has neither received a final determination of compliance with \nSection 1373 nor any documents in response to its FOIA request.   \nD.  The Trump Administration Advances A Radical New Interpretation Of 8 \nU.S.C. § 1324 \n49.  While the litigation over the FY2017 conditions on the Byrne JAG Program was \npending, the Trump Administration sought to weaponize another provision of the U.S. Code \nagainst jurisdictions seeking to prioritize local law enforcement over enforcement of civil \nimmigration law. \n50.  During a January 4, 2018, interview on Fox News, then-Acting Director of U.S. \nImmigrations and Customs Enforcement Thomas Homan said that he had asked the Department \nof Justice to “[l]ook into criminal charges for elected officials with sanctuary policies, as they are \nharboring illegal aliens, according to 8 U.S.C. § 1324.”  Kirstjen Nielsen, the Secretary of \nHomeland Security, confirmed during testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on \nJanuary 16, 2018, that “the Department of Justice is reviewing what avenues may be available” \nto charge elected officials in so-called sanctuary jurisdictions.  \n51.  In the nearly seventy years since 8 U.S.C. § 1324 was enacted, the federal \ngovernment has never attempted to prosecute an elected official acting in their official capacity \nfor violation of that statute.  For much of this time, cities such as Chicago declined to participate \nin federal immigration enforcement without any indication that doing so violated any criminal \nstatute.  This attempt by the Trump Administration to criminalize the policy choices of local \ngovernments represents a significant threat to the ability of cities such as Chicago to enact \npolicies intended to foster public safety. \n-20- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 21 of 45 PageID #:21\n  \nE.  The FY2018 Byrne JAG Award Documents Contain The Same Unlawful \nConditions (Plus Two New Ones) \n52.  Notwithstanding over a year of litigation before this Court and this Court’s clear \nrulings invalidating its approach, the Department of Justice’s FY2018 Byrne JAG Local \nSolicitation and required certifications (attached as Exs. D-G) reflect the Attorney General’s \ndecision to re-impose the FY2017 notice, access, and 1373 conditions, as well as several new \nconditions similarly designed to impress state and local officers into the service of federal \nimmigration-enforcement priorities. \n53.  The conditions announced in the FY2018 Local Solicitation appear in FY2018 \nByrne JAG award letters issued to date to jurisdictions other than Chicago.     \n54.  Four of the immigration-related conditions announced in the FY2018 solicitation \nand carried over to each jurisdiction’s award letter are materially identical to the FY2017 Byrne \nJAG conditions this Court has already held unlawful and set aside.  On that basis alone, the \nAttorney General is precluded from defending the conditions.  Therefore, the conditions should \nbe enjoined and Chicago should be awarded fees and costs. \n55.  The “Section 1373 compliance condition”:  The FY2018 award letters issued by \nthe Attorney General require that the “program or activity” funded under the Byrne JAG award \ncomply with 8 U.S.C. § 1373(a) and (b) and that the Chief Legal Officer of the recipient execute \na certification (attached as Ex. E) declaring the “program or activity” in compliance with those \nprovisions.  This condition is materially identical to the FY2017 Section 1373 compliance \ncondition. \n56.  The “Section 1644 compliance condition”:  The FY2018 award letters issued by \nthe Attorney General require that the “program or activity” funded under the Byrne JAG award \ncomply with 8 U.S.C. § 1644 and that the Chief Legal Officer of the recipient execute a \n-21- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 22 of 45 PageID #:22\n  \ncertification declaring the “program or activity” in compliance with that provision (attached as \nEx. E).  This condition is materially identical to the FY2017 Section 1644 compliance condition, \nbecause 8 U.S.C. § 1644 proscribes the exact same conduct as 8 U.S.C. § 1373. \n57.  The “FY2018 notice condition”:  The FY2018 award letters issued by the \nAttorney General require that Byrne JAG recipients “provide—as early as practicable…—\nadvance notice to [federal immigration officials] of the scheduled release date and time for a \nparticular alien, if a State or local government (or government-contracted) correctional facility \nreceives from [a federal immigration authority] a formal written request pursuant to the INA that \nseeks such advance notice.”  The conduct required by this condition is identical to the conduct \nthe Attorney General attempted to require with the FY2017 notice condition.  \n58.  The “FY2018 access condition”:  The FY2018 award letters issued by the \nAttorney General require that Byrne JAG recipients permit “access to any State or local \ngovernment (or government-contracted) correctional facility by such agents for the purpose [of] \n‘interrogat[ing] any alien or person believed to be an alien as to his [or her] right to be or to \nremain in the United States.’”  The conduct required by this condition is identical to the conduct \nthe Attorney General attempted to require with the FY2017 access condition.  \n59.  In addition to these revived conditions, the FY2018 Byrne JAG solicitation \nannounced a new unlawful condition, and an additional mandatory certification, each of which is \nintended to deny funds from cities like Chicago that seek nothing more than to exercise their \nright to opt out of participation in federal immigration enforcement.  The Attorney General has \nlikewise carried these conditions over to FY2018 award documents.  \n60.   The “harboring” condition: The FY2018 Byrne JAG award letters issued by the \nAttorney General prohibit grantees from attempting to conceal, harbor, or shield from detection \n-22- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 23 of 45 PageID #:23\n  \nany undocumented immigrant by publicly disclosing federal law enforcement information, even \nwhere doing so would not violate any statute.  The Attorney General purported to justify this \ncondition as being “[c]onsistent with the purposes and objectives of federal law enforcement \nstatutes and federal criminal law.” \n61.  The “additional certification” condition:  In addition to certifying compliance \nwith Section 1373 and 1644, the FY2018 Byrne JAG Local Solicitation requires the Chief Legal \nOfficer of a FY2018 Byrne JAG applicant to execute a “Certification Relating to 8 U.S.C. \n§§ 1226(a) & (c), 1231 (a), 1324(a), 1357(a), & 1366(1) & (3)” (attached as Ex. F).  The award \ndocuments require the Chief Executive Officer to execute “Certifications and Assurances by the \nChief Executive of the Applicant Government” (attached as Ex. G) that adopts this certification \nby the Chief Legal Officer.  The Chief Legal Officer certification represents that “neither the \njurisdiction nor any entity, agency, or official of the jurisdiction has in effect, purports to have in \neffect, or is subject to or bound by, any law, rule, policy, or practice that would apply to the \n‘program or activity’ to be funded … that would (1) impede the exercise by federal officers of \nauthority under 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a); or (2) impede the exercise by federal officers of authority \nrelating to 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a) or (c), 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a), or 8 U.S.C. § 1366(1) or (3).”  Ex. F.  \nThese conditions have no legal basis.    \n62.  On information and belief, the same conditions are contained in all FY2018 Byrne \nJAG award documents.  In the prior litigation, the Attorney General submitted a sworn \ndeclaration from the Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs \nexplaining that the FY2017 conditions were “identical” for “each award document being \ngenerated within OJP . . . including any such award document that would be generated for the \nCity of Chicago, Illinois.” \n-23- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 24 of 45 PageID #:24\n  \nIV.  THE UNLAWFUL NEW CONDITIONS WILL INJURE CHICAGO \n63.  The Trump Administration’s unlawful actions pose a threat of imminent harm to \nChicago.  By imposing the unlawful conditions on the Byrne JAG program, the Attorney General \nseeks to pressure Chicago into abandoning its longstanding public safety priorities, on pain of \nlosing critical formula grant funds that would otherwise support officer safety, community \nempowerment, and innovative countermeasures in the fight against gun violence.  Last year, \nChicago had to wait more than a year before receiving its FY2017 Byrne JAG funds.  Now, \nChicago faces another interminable delay.     \n64.  To date, the Department has refused to finally determine whether Chicago \ncomplies with Section 1373 (and therefore also Section 1644).  Instead, it has expressed a vague \nconcern that Chicago has some heretofore unidentified policy that contradicts its official \ninterpretation of the Welcoming City Ordinance and put forth an unprincipled and overbroad \ndefinition of “immigration status information” that encompasses a detainee’s custody status and \nrelease date.  Despite refusing to provide clear guidance on what Sections 1373 and 1644 \nrequire, the Department continues to insist that Byrne JAG applicants’ chief legal and executive \nofficers execute certifications—under express penalty of “criminal prosecution,” or “civil \npenalties and administrative remedies for false claims”—that their jurisdictions comply with \nSections 1373 and 1644.  This uncertainty has clouded the City’s ability to apply for funds.   \n65.  The uncertainty regarding the Department’s interpretation of Section 1373 and \n1644 also has given rise to a fear of prosecution or other adverse legal action.  In the first week \nfollowing his inauguration, President Trump ordered the Attorney General to take “appropriate \nenforcement action against any entity that violates [Section] 1373,” Executive Order No. 13,768 \n§ 9(a), which the Attorney General has interpreted to mean filing civil preemption actions \nagainst jurisdictions he believes violate Section 1373.  See Opp. Mot. Prelim. Inj., Richmond v. \n-24- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 25 of 45 PageID #:25\n  \nTrump, No. 3:17-cv-01535 (N.D. Cal.), ECF No. 16, at 8-9, 22.  Carrying out that threat, the \nDepartment of Justice sued the State of California based in part on Section 1373 to try to force \nCalifornia to abandon its immigration-related policies.  See United States v. State of California, \nNo. 2:18-cv-00490 (E.D. Cal.).  Chicago reasonably believes that the Attorney General may \npursue similar enforcement litigation against Chicago, particularly given that the Attorney \nGeneral has singled out Chicago for special opprobrium:  In a public speech given shortly after \nChicago filed its FY2017 lawsuit against the same conditions, he declared that “requir[ing]” \nChicago to “reorder[] [its] law enforcement practice is exactly the point!” of his policies.   \n66.  The additional certification requirement poses the same problems.  While Chicago \nis confident that it does not “impede” the federal government’s exercise of authority under 8 \nU.S.C. §§ 1226(a) or (c), 1231(a)(4), 1357(a) or 1366(1) or (3), it has well-founded concerns, \nbased on the Trump Administration’s history of targeting Chicago, that the Administration may \nput forth a new, broad interpretation of those provisions, designed to ensnare Chicago or its \nofficials in a dispute over the validity of those certifications.  \n67.  More fundamentally, complying with the FY2018 conditions would undermine \npublic safety in Chicago.  The Welcoming City Ordinance assists effective policing by building \ntrust between law enforcement officers and the immigrant community.  Conversely, policing \nsuffers when members of that community, whatever their immigration status, do not feel free to \nreport crimes, assist in investigations, or testify as witnesses.  The Attorney General’s insistence \nthat Chicago abandon its existing policies, that Chicago give immigration enforcement agents \non-demand access to its detention facilities to investigate potential civil immigration violations, \nand that Chicago detain individuals solely so that they can be investigated for possible civil \n-25- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 26 of 45 PageID #:26\n  \nimmigration violations would undermine crucial public trust, cut local law enforcement efforts \noff at the knees, and make everyone in Chicago less safe.   \n68.  Chicago now faces the prospect of a severe federal incursion on its sovereignty.  \nChicago could abandon its attempts to preserve the policymaking autonomy afforded it under our \nfederal system, in hopes that the Attorney General award Chicago the funds promised it by \nCongress.  Given the Attorney General’s dogged refusal to award Chicago funds to which it has \na plain statutory entitlement, even such a dramatic reversal may not bring Chicago the law \nenforcement funds it needs.  Or Chicago could continue its decades-long focus on policies that \nfurther the best interests of its residents and officers but lose out on funds it has long used to fund \ncritical law-enforcement needs.  The use of the federal government’s coercive power in this \nmanner causes a deep and irreparable injury to Chicago’s sovereignty, and to our federal system.  \n69.  Moreover, whichever decision Chicago ultimately makes, its residents and police \nforce will be immediately and irreparably harmed.  If Chicago submits to the Attorney General’s \ndemands, it will forfeit decades’ worth of trust and goodwill that its police force has built in the \ncommunities it serves.  And as those decades of experience show, that kind of trust, once lost, is \nlost forever.  Alternatively, if Chicago asserts its right to determine its own policy and refuses to \ncertify compliance with the Department’s new and unlawful conditions, it (and the eleven other \njurisdictions that depend on Chicago’s application for their Byrne JAG funds) will forever forfeit \nthe FY2018 Byrne JAG grant monies—monies that are critical to Chicago’s community policing \noperation and that purchase essential and life-saving equipment for Chicago and its neighboring \njurisdictions.  Even if Chicago and its neighbors could later obtain those funds, the damage \nwould have already been done in the months or years their police forces and residents will have \nspent without crucial equipment and services. \n-26- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 27 of 45 PageID #:27\n  \nV.  THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS NOW PRECLUDED FROM DEFENDING \nMOST OF THE FY2018 BYRNE JAG CONDITIONS \n70.  The Attorney General is precluded from relitigating claims and issues that he lost \nin the FY2017 litigation brought by Chicago—namely, the legality of the Section 1373 \ncompliance, Section 1644 compliance, notice, and access conditions on the Byrne JAG \nprogram—with regard to the FY2018 Byrne JAG awards or any future Byrne JAG awards.  All \nof the legal requirements for preclusion are met here. \n71.  The FY2018 versions of those conditions are materially identical to the FY2017 \nversions this Court has already enjoined as unlawful.  The FY2018 Section 1373 and Section \n1644 compliance conditions are no different than the FY2017 Section 1373 condition, because \nSection 1644 proscribes the same conduct as Section 1373.  And the FY2018 notice and access \nconditions, though framed slightly differently, require the same conduct as the FY2017 notice \nand access conditions—providing 48 hours’ advance notice to federal immigration authorities of \nthe scheduled release date and time of identified individuals and allowing federal officials on-\ndemand access to individuals in Chicago’s custody for purposes of immigration-related \ninterrogation. \n72.  The validity of the FY2017 Section 1373, notice, and access conditions was not \njust actually litigated in a prior lawsuit—it was the central issue in the FY2017 litigation.  \n73.  This Court’s final judgment critically depended upon its determination that the \nFY2017 Section 1373, notice, and access conditions were unlawful.  That order set aside each of \nthe three FY2017 conditions based on this Court’s conclusion the Attorney General could not \nlawfully impose any of those conditions.   \n74.  Finally, the Attorney General was fully represented in the FY2017 litigation by \ncapable lawyers from the Department of Justice.   \n-27- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 28 of 45 PageID #:28\n  \nCOUNT ONE:  VIOLATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706 (ULTRA VIRES) \n75.  Chicago incorporates by reference the allegations of the preceding paragraphs. \n76.  The Department of Justice may exercise only authority conferred by statute.  See \nCity of Arlington, Tex. v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 297 (2013); see also 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C).  \nA.  The FY2018 Notice And Access Conditions Are Ultra Vires \n77.  Notwithstanding this Court’s order setting aside the materially identical FY2017 \nnotice and access conditions, the Attorney General continues to press FY2018 conditions \nrequiring identical conduct.   \n78.  The Court’s prior determination that the notice and access conditions are \nunlawful, in a lawsuit involving the same parties and the same underlying federal grant program, \nis conclusive here.  The Attorney General is therefore precluded from relitigating the lawfulness \nof the notice and access conditions. \n79.  Even as an initial matter, the Attorney General lacks statutory authority to \ncondition Byrne JAG funds on the FY2018 notice and access conditions.  Indeed, such authority \nis at odds with the text, structure, and purpose of the Byrne JAG statute, as this Court and the \nSeventh Circuit have held.   The FY2018 notice and access conditions cannot stand. \n80.  As a direct and proximate result of those unlawful conditions, Chicago will be \nforced to accept unlawful and unconstitutional grant conditions or forgo Byrne JAG funds and \nshut down the programs they support.    \n81.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Chicago is entitled to a \ndeclaration that the Attorney General is without authority to impose the FY2018 notice and \naccess conditions on Byrne JAG funds (or materially identical conditions in future grant years), \n-28- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 29 of 45 PageID #:29\n  \nan order that those conditions be set aside, and an injunction preventing those conditions from \ngoing into effect. \n82.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1361 and 1651, Chicago is entitled to a writ of \nmandamus compelling the Attorney General to issue and fund Chicago’s FY2018 Byrne JAG \naward as contemplated by the Byrne JAG statute (i.e., without the FY2018 notice or access \nconditions).  \n83.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A), Chicago is entitled to an award of its \ncosts, attorney’s fees, and expenses associated with this litigation.  The Attorney General’s \nattempt to impose the FY2018 notice and access conditions on Chicago is not substantially \njustified given this Court’s order setting aside materially identical conditions the Attorney \nGeneral attempted to impose on FY2017 Byrne JAG funds.   \n84.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412(b), Chicago is entitled to an award of its costs, \nattorney’s fees, and expenses associated with this litigation.  The Attorney General’s attempt to \nimpose the FY2018 notice and access conditions on Chicago notwithstanding this Court’s order \nsetting aside materially identical conditions from FY2017 demonstrates bad faith and an attempt \nto undermine or avoid this Court’s permanent injunction in Chicago’s FY2017 suit. \nB.  The Section 1373 And Section 1644 Compliance Conditions Are Ultra Vires \n85.  The Attorney General also persists in his attempts to impose the Section 1373 and \nSection 1644 conditions, even in the face of this Court’s decision that Section 1373 is facially \nunconstitutional and therefore cannot be imposed as an “applicable law” on Byrne JAG \napplicants.  \n86.  The Court’s prior determination that the Section 1373 compliance condition is \nunlawful, in a lawsuit involving the same parties and the same underlying federal grant program, \nis conclusive here as to both the Section 1373 compliance condition and the substantively \n-29- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 30 of 45 PageID #:30\n  \nidentical Section 1644 compliance condition.  The Attorney General is therefore precluded from \nrelitigating the lawfulness of the notice and access conditions. \n87.  The Attorney General lacks statutory authority to condition Byrne JAG funds on \ncompliance with Section 1373 or Section 1644.  The Byrne JAG statute’s requirement that \ngrantees comply with “all other applicable Federal laws” does not confer authority to condition \nByrne JAG funding on Section 1373 or Section 1644 compliance, because neither provision is an \n“applicable” law here.  The phrase “all other applicable Federal laws” in the Byrne JAG statute \nrefers to the host of laws that regulate the conduct of federal grant recipients as grant recipients.  \nIt does not refer to every section of the U.S. Code that could possibly apply to a state or local \ngovernment.  Neither Section 1373 nor Section 1644 regulate grantees as grantees nor do its \nterms mention federal grants or funds.   \n88.  Moreover, and as this Court already held with respect to a substantively identical \ncondition in the FY2017 Byrne JAG grant, Section 1373 and Section 1644 are facially \nunconstitutional because they seek to commandeer state and local officials into the service of \nfederal immigration-enforcement authorities.  Because those laws are facially unconstitutional, \nthey are not “applicable laws” available for incorporation into the Byrne JAG program.  \n89.  The Section 1373 and Section 1644 compliance conditions on the FY2018 Byrne \nJAG grant cannot stand.   \n90.  As a direct and proximate result of these unlawful conditions, Chicago will be \nforced to accept unlawful and unconstitutional grant conditions or forgo Byrne JAG funds and \nshut down the programs they support.    \n91.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Chicago is entitled to a \ndeclaration that Attorney General is without authority to impose the FY 2018 Section 1373 and \n-30- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 31 of 45 PageID #:31\n  \nSection 1644 conditions on Byrne JAG funds (or materially identical conditions in future grant \nyears), an order that those conditions be set aside, and an injunction preventing those conditions \nfrom going into effect. \n92.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1361 and 1651, Chicago is entitled to a writ of \nmandamus compelling the Attorney General to issue and fund Chicago’s FY2018 Byrne JAG \naward as contemplated by the Byrne JAG statute (i.e., without the FY2018 Section 1373 or \nSection 1644 conditions).  \n93.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A), Chicago is entitled to an award of its \ncosts, attorney’s fees, and expenses associated with this litigation.  The Attorney General’s \nattempt to impose the FY2018 Section 1373 compliance and Section 1644 compliance conditions \non Chicago is not substantially justified given this Court’s order setting aside materially identical \nconditions the Attorney General attempted to impose on FY2017 Byrne JAG funds.   \n94.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412(b), Chicago is entitled to an award of its costs, \nattorney’s fees, and expenses associated with this litigation.  The Attorney General’s attempt to \nimpose the FY2018 Section 1373 compliance and Section 1644 compliance conditions on \nChicago notwithstanding this Court’s order setting aside materially identical conditions from \nFY2017 demonstrates bad faith and an attempt to undermine or avoid this Court’s permanent \ninjunction in Chicago’s FY2017 suit. \nC.  The Harboring Condition Is Ultra Vires \n95.  The Attorney General also lacks statutory authority to condition FY2018 Byrne \nJAG funding on a commitment not to conceal, harbor, or shield from detection undocumented \nimmigrants by disclosing federal law enforcement information.   \n-31- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 32 of 45 PageID #:32\n  \n96.  The Byrne JAG statute allows the Attorney General to require a certification of \ncompliance only with applicable laws.  The harboring condition specifically states that it applies \neven where disclosure of information would not violate federal anti-harboring laws.    \n97.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Chicago is entitled to a \ndeclaration that Attorney General is without authority to impose the harboring condition on \nFY2018 Byrne JAG funds (or materially identical conditions in future grant years), an order that \nthat condition be set aside, and an injunction preventing that condition from going into effect. \n98.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1361 and 1651, Chicago is entitled to a writ of \nmandamus compelling the Attorney General to issue and fund Chicago’s FY2018 Byrne JAG \naward as contemplated by the Byrne JAG statute (i.e., without the harboring condition).  \nD.  The Additional Certification Requirement Is Ultra Vires \n99.  The Attorney General also lacks statutory authority to condition Byrne JAG funds \non a certification that the applicant has no law that “impedes” the federal government’s exercise \nof authority under 8 U.S.C. §§ 1226(a) & (c), 1231 (a), 1357(a), or 1366(1) & (3). \n100.  The phrase “all applicable Federal laws” in the Byrne JAG statute refers to laws \nthat regulate the conduct of federal grant recipients.  Sections 1226(a) and (c), 1231(a), 1357(a), \nand 1366(1) and (3), by their terms, apply to the federal government, not individual cities and \nstates.  Those laws are therefore not “applicable” to individual grant recipients making the \ncertifications required for participation in the Byrne JAG program. \n101.  As a direct and proximate result of these unlawful conditions, Chicago will be \nforced to accept unlawful and unconstitutional grant conditions or forgo Byrne JAG funds and \nshut down the programs they support.    \n102.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Chicago is entitled to a \ndeclaration that the Attorney General is without authority to impose the additional certification \n-32- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 33 of 45 PageID #:33\n  \nrequirement on Byrne JAG funds (in FY2018 or any future grant year), an order that the \ncondition be set aside, and an injunction preventing the condition from going into effect. \n103.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1361 and 1651, Chicago is entitled to a writ of \nmandamus compelling the Attorney General to issue and fund Chicago’s FY2018 Byrne JAG \naward as contemplated by the Byrne JAG statute (i.e., without the FY2018 additional \ncertification condition).  \nCOUNT TWO:  VIOLATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706 (SEPARATION OF POWERS) \n104.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations of the preceding paragraphs. \n105.  When an agency acts “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or \nimmunity,” a reviewing court must “hold unlawful and set aside” the challenged action.  5 \nU.S.C. § 706.  \n106.  The Constitution vests the spending power in Congress, not the President.   \nThe Executive “does not have unilateral authority to refuse to spend . . . funds” that have already \nbeen appropriated by Congress “for a particular project or program.”  In re Aiken Cty., 725 F.3d \n255, 261 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 2013). \n107.  Congress in the Byrne JAG statute required the Executive to distribute Byrne JAG \nfunds based on a simple funding formula.  Imposing a new condition on the program amounts to \nrefusing to spend money appropriated by Congress unless that condition is satisfied.  The \nFY2018 notice and access conditions, the Section 1373 and Section 1644 compliance conditions, \nthe harboring condition, and the additional certification condition were not imposed by Congress, \nbut rather by the Attorney General.  Those conditions therefore amount to improper usurpation \nof Congress’s spending power by the Executive Branch. \n-33- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 34 of 45 PageID #:34\n  \n108.  The Court’s prior determination that the Attorney General lacks the statutory \nauthority to impose the notice and access conditions or the Section 1373 compliance condition, \nin a lawsuit involving the same parties and the same underlying federal grant program, is \nconclusive here.  The Attorney General is therefore precluded from relitigating the issue of his \nauthority to impose the notice and access conditions or the Section 1373 compliance condition \nand the substantively identical Section 1644 compliance condition. \n109.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Chicago is entitled to a \ndeclaration that the FY2018 notice and access conditions, the Section 1373 and Section 1644 \ncompliance conditions, the harboring condition, and the additional certification condition (as \nwell as any materially identical conditions the Attorney General may impose in future grant \nyears) violate the constitutional separation of powers and arrogate to the Executive power that is \nreserved to the Legislature, as well as an injunction preventing those conditions from going into \neffect.  \n110.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1361 and 1651, Chicago is entitled to a writ of \nmandamus compelling the Attorney General to issue and fund Chicago’s FY2018 Byrne JAG \naward as contemplated by the Byrne JAG statute (i.e., without the FY2018 Section 1373 \ncompliance, Section 1644 compliance, notice, access, harboring, or additional certification \nconditions).  \n111.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A), Chicago is entitled to an award of its \ncosts, attorney’s fees, and expenses associated with this litigation.  The Attorney General’s \nattempt to impose the FY2018 Section 1373 compliance, Section 1644 compliance, notice, and \naccess conditions on Chicago is not substantially justified given this Court’s order setting aside \n-34- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 35 of 45 PageID #:35\n  \nmaterially identical conditions the Attorney General attempted to impose on FY2017 Byrne JAG \nfunds.   \n112.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412(b), Chicago is entitled to an award of its costs, \nattorney’s fees, and expenses associated with this litigation.  The Attorney General’s attempt to \nimpose the FY2018 Section 1373 compliance, Section 1644 compliance, notice, and access \nconditions on Chicago notwithstanding this Court’s order setting aside materially identical \nconditions from FY2017 demonstrates bad faith and an attempt to undermine or avoid this \nCourt’s permanent injunction in Chicago’s FY2017 suit. \nCOUNT THREE: VIOLATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706 (SPENDING CLAUSE)  \n113.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations of the preceding paragraphs. \n114.  In any event, Congress could not have authorized the conditions here because \nthey do not satisfy the additional requirements of the Spending Clause.  Accordingly, those \nrequirements must be enjoined.   \nA.  The Conditions Are Unconstitutionally Ambiguous \n115.  Federal restrictions on grants provided to state and local governments must also \nbe articulated “unambiguously” so that the recipient can “voluntarily and knowingly accept[]” \nCongress’s terms.  Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 16-17 (1981).   \n116.  All of the FY2018 immigration-related conditions are ambiguous as to what is \nexpected of grant recipients in Chicago’s position, particularly given Chicago’s Welcoming City \nOrdinance and other relevant policies and practices.  The FY2018 notice and access conditions \ndo not provide Chicago sufficient notice of what will be expected of it because they are entirely \ndependent on the future exercise of discretion by federal agents outside of the Department of \nJustice.  The Section 1373 and Section 1644 compliance conditions are also ambiguous, and the \n-35- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 36 of 45 PageID #:36\n  \nDepartment’s guidance documents and other actions have only added to the confusion.   \nFurthermore, many interpretations of Section 1373 and Section 1644 would raise serious \nconstitutional concerns.  The harboring condition is likewise ambiguous.  The Trump \nAdministration has offered no guidance on how a municipality’s disclosure of information could \nconstitute “conceal[ing], harbor[ing], or shield[ing] from detection” any individual.  Finally, the \nadditional certification condition is also ambiguous.  It imposes on the certifying jurisdiction an \nobligation not to “impede” the federal government’s exercise of its authority under 8 U.S.C. §§ \n1226(a) & (c), 1231 (a), 1357(a), or 1366(1) & (3), but nowhere explains what the Department \nunderstands “impede” to mean.   \nB.  The Conditions Are Not Germane To The Byrne JAG Program \n117.  Conditions on spending grants must be “relevant to [the] federal interest” in the \nparticular grant program.  Ivanhoe Irr. Dist. v. McCracken, 357 U.S. 275, 295 (1958); accord \nSouth Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 207-208 & n.3 (1987).  This nexus requirement ensures that \nthe federal government does not use spending conditions to regulate state and local governments \nbeyond the contours of the spending program itself.   \n118.  The FY2018 notice and access conditions are not relevant to the federal interest in \nthe Byrne JAG funds Chicago receives.  Among other things, information concerning when \ndetainees will be released from lockup and policies respecting access for federal immigration \nagents bear no relevance to improving the ability of Chicago’s Bureau of Detective to solve \nviolent crimes, the Force for Good Program, or other uses to which Chicago puts Byrne JAG \nfunds.  Nor are they relevant to the Byrne JAG program’s larger purposes.   \n119.  The Section 1373 and Section 1644 compliance conditions are also not relevant to \nthe federal interest in the Byrne JAG funds Chicago receives, or to the program’s larger \npurposes.  Information sharing with federal officials regarding an individual’s immigration status \n-36- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 37 of 45 PageID #:37\n  \nbears no connection to the replacement vehicles for worn-out police patrol cars, support for the \nForce for Good program, or the acquisition of new law enforcement equipment.   \n120.  The additional certification condition is also not relevant to the federal interest in \nthe Byrne JAG funds Chicago receives.   \n121.  As a direct and proximate result of these unconstitutional conditions, Chicago will \nbe forced to accept unlawful and unconstitutional grant conditions or forgo Byrne JAG funds and \nshut down or materially alter the programs they support.    \n122.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Chicago is entitled to a \ndeclaration that the FY 2018 notice and access conditions, the Section 1373 and Section 1644 \ncompliance conditions, the Section 1324 condition, and the additional certification condition (as \nwell as any materially identical conditions the Attorney General may impose in future grant \nyears) violate the Spending Clause, as well as an injunction preventing those conditions from \ngoing into effect.  \n123.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1361 and 1651, Chicago is entitled to a writ of \nmandamus compelling the Attorney General to issue and fund Chicago’s FY2018 Byrne JAG \naward as contemplated by the Byrne JAG statute (i.e., without the FY2018 Section 1373 \ncompliance, Section 1644 compliance, notice, access, or additional certification conditions).  \nCOUNT FOUR: COMMANDEERING \n124.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations of the preceding paragraphs. \n125.  As this Court has already declared, in a lawsuit involving the same parties and the \nsame underlying federal grant program, 8 U.S.C. § 1373 is facially unconstitutional.  That \ndetermination is conclusive here.  The Attorney General is therefore precluded from relitigating \nSection 1373’s constitutionality.   \n-37- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 38 of 45 PageID #:38\n  \n126.  8 U.S.C. § 1644 is substantively identical to Section 1373.  The Attorney General \nis therefore precluded from litigating Section 1644’s constitutionality as well.  \n127.  And beyond the conclusive import of the prior litigation with regard to Section \n1373 and Section 1644, they are plainly unconstitutional under the anticommandeering doctrine.  \nThe Tenth Amendment prohibits the federal government from “requir[ing]” state and local \ngovernments “to govern according to Congress’s instructions,” New York v. United States, 505 \nU.S. 144, 162 (1992), or “command[ing] the States’ officers . . . to administer or enforce a \nfederal regulatory program,” Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 935 (1997).  Congress has \ntransgressed the limits of the Tenth Amendment when it “regulat[es] activities undertaken by \ngovernment entities only,” Ex. A at 21, rather than “evenhandedly regulat[ing] an activity in \nwhich both States and private actors engage,” NCAA, 138 S. Ct. at 1478.  \n128.  Sections 1373 and 1644 do just that, by prohibiting state and local governments \nfrom engaging in a core aspect of governing: controlling the actions of their own employees and \nretaining control over local law enforcement policy. Sections 1373 and 1644 are therefore \nfacially unconstitutional and cannot be validly enforced against Chicago or imposed on Byrne \nJAG recipients as “applicable Federal laws.”  34 U.S.C. § 10153(a)(5)(D). \n129.  As a direct and proximate result of these unconstitutional conditions, Chicago will \nbe forced to accept unlawful and unconstitutional grant conditions or forgo Byrne JAG funds and \nshut down or materially alter the programs they support.    \n130.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Chicago is entitled to a declaration that 8 U.S.C. \n§§ 1373 and 1644 violate the Tenth Amendment. \n131.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Chicago is further entitled to a declaration that 8 \nU.S.C. §§ 1373 and 1644 cannot validly be imposed as conditions on the Byrne JAG program as \n-38- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 39 of 45 PageID #:39\n  \nwell as an injunction preventing the FY2018 Section 1373 and Section 1644 conditions (or any \nmaterially identical conditions the Attorney General may seek to impose in future grant years) \nfrom going into effect.  \n132.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1361 and 1651, Chicago is entitled to a writ of \nmandamus compelling the Attorney General to issue and fund Chicago’s FY2018 Byrne JAG \naward as contemplated by the Byrne JAG statute (i.e., without the FY2018 Section 1373 \ncompliance or Section 1644 compliance conditions).  \n133.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A), Chicago is entitled to an award of its \ncosts, attorney’s fees, and expenses associated with this litigation.  Any contention that the \nSection 1373 and Section 1644 are constitutional is not substantially justified given this Court’s \norder holding Section 1373 facially unconstitutional.   \n134.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412(b), Chicago is entitled to an award of its costs, \nattorney’s fees, and expenses associated with this litigation.  Any contention that that Section \n1373 and Section 1644 are constitutional demonstrates bad faith and an attempt to undermine or \navoid this Court’s permanent injunction in Chicago’s FY2017 suit.   \nCOUNT FIVE: DECLARATORY JUDGMENT THAT CHICAGO’S WELCOMING \nCITY ORDINANCE AND IMPLEMENTING POLICIES COMPLY WITH \nSECTION 1373 AND SECTION 1644 \n135.  Chicago incorporates by reference the allegations of the preceding paragraphs. \n136.  Where City officials or agents come to possess immigration status information, \nChicago has no policy restricting the sharing of such information contrary to Section 1373 or \nSection 1644.  \n137.  Section 20 of the Welcoming City Ordinance permits Chicago’s agents and \nagencies to request or receive information about citizenship or immigration status (from ICE or \nelsewhere) whenever required by “federal regulation”—which, as Chicago’s Chief Legal Officer \n-39- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 40 of 45 PageID #:40\n  \nhas explained, “do[es] not restrict the sharing of immigration status information with federal \nimmigration officers.”  \n138.  Section 30 of the Welcoming City Ordinance limits the disclosure of an \nindividual’s citizenship or immigration status information “[e]xcept as otherwise provided by \napplicable federal law.”  In the context of the Welcoming City Ordinance—and, again, as \nChicago’s Chief Legal Office has explained—“applicable federal law” includes Sections 1373 \nand 1644 to whatever extent Sections 1373 and 1644, and any individual federal request made \npursuant to those provisions, is a lawful and constitutional exercise of federal authority.   \n139.  Section 42 of the Welcoming City Ordinance (and the Chicago Police \nDepartment’s implementing policy, CPD Special Order S06-14-03) does not violate Section \n1373 or Section 1644 because the information Chicago’s agents or agencies may not share is \ninformation “regarding a person’s custody status or release date.”  That information is not \n“information regarding . . . citizenship or immigration status” covered by Sections 1373 and \n1644.  See Steinle v. City and County of San Francisco, 230 F. Supp. 3d 994, 1015 (N.D. Cal. \n2017). \n140.  Chicago has repeatedly certified its compliance with Section 1373 and explained \nits reasons for doing so.  Those certifications necessarily extend to Section 1644, because Section \n1373 and Section 1644 proscribe the same conduct.   \n141.  To date, the Department has not stated whether it accepts Chicago’s prior \ncertifications.  While Chicago is confident it complies with both Section 1373 and Section 1644 \nfor the reasons stated above, the Department’s conduct has sown confusion and created the \nimpression that the federal government believes otherwise, notwithstanding Chicago’s legal \nanalysis.  Chicago is reluctant to certify compliance with Section 1373 and Section 1644 in its \n-40- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 41 of 45 PageID #:41\n  \nFY 2018 Byrne JAG application, which is due imminently, until the Department affirms that the \nCity’s prior certifications are acceptable. \n142.  Chicago has a credible fear of prosecution or other enforcement action.  The \nAttorney General has made clear that he considers so-called “sanctuary” cities like Chicago a \n“clear and ongoing threat to public safety” and that “OJP will rely upon this certification as a \nmaterial representation in any decision to make an award to the applicant entity.”  He has also \ntaken the President’s directive to “enforce” Section 1373 as an instruction to file preemption \nlawsuits against jurisdictions with policies he believes violate Section 1373.  See supra ¶ 65.  \nThat the Department has sued the State of California over its approach to federal immigration \nenforcement is a strong indication that the Department has taken the President’s instruction to \nheart and is willing to pursue legal action against “sanctuary” jurisdictions. \n143.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Chicago is entitled to a declaration that its \nWelcoming City Ordinance and implementing policies comply with Sections 1373 and 1644. \nCOUNT SIX: DECLARATORY JUDGMENT THAT CHICAGO’S WELCOMING CITY \nORDINANCE AND IMPLEMENTING POLICIES COMPLY WITH 8 U.S.C. § 1324 \n \n144.  Chicago incorporates by reference the allegations of the preceding paragraphs. \n145.  The Welcoming City Ordinance prohibits Chicago’s agents and agencies from \narresting, detaining, or continuing to detain an individual based solely on their immigration \nstatus unless required to do so by applicable law.  These provisions expressly require compliance \nwith federal laws and regulations, including 8 U.S.C. § 1324. \n146.  The Ordinance also restricts the extent to which local officials may be compelled \nto participate in federal immigration enforcement.  Nothing in 8 U.S.C. § 1324 creates an \naffirmative requirement for local governments to enforce immigration law or to assist federal \nauthorities in enforcing immigration law. \n-41- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 42 of 45 PageID #:42\n  \n147.  While Chicago is confident it complies with Section 1324, the Attorney General’s \nconduct has sown confusion and created the impression that the federal government believes \notherwise, notwithstanding Chicago’s own legal analysis.   \n148.  High-ranking Trump Administration officials have threated to prosecute local \nofficials and governments for violation of Section 1324, without providing any meaningful \nguidance on how to determine compliance.   \n149.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Chicago is entitled to a declaration that it complies \nwith Section 1324. \nCOUNT SEVEN: VIOLATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706 (FAILURE TO USE NOTICE AND COMMENT PROCEDURES; ARBITRARY \nAND CAPRICIOUS) \n150.  Chicago incorporates by reference the allegations of the preceding paragraphs. \n151.  In addition to lacking statutory and constitutional authority to impose the \nimmigration-related conditions on the Byrne JAG grant, the conditions are arbitrary and \ncapricious, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706. \n152.  The FY 2018 immigration-related conditions are arbitrary and capricious because \nthe Department failed to rely on reasoned decisionmaking and, to the extent it cited reasons at \nall, those reasons are contradicted by the evidence before the agency.  “Normally, an agency rule \nwould be arbitrary and capricious if the agency has relied on factors which Congress has not \nintended it to consider . . . .”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. \nIns. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  Here, among other things, the Department proposes to evaluate \ngrant applicants on the basis of their immigration policies rather than on their compliance with \nexpressly enumerated statutory application requirements.  See 34 U.S.C. § 10153(a)(1)-(5).  It \nalso “entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,” State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43, \nincluding but not limited to the policing challenges created by alienating and inducing fear in \n-42- \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 1 Filed: 10/12/18 Page 43 of 45 PageID #:43\n  \nimmigrant communities.  It also “offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the \nevidence before the agency,” which likewise is arbitrary and capricious, id., including the \nevidence submitted by nine jurisdictions in their Section 1373 certification letters indicating that \nWelcoming City-style policies promote rather than detract from effective policing.

BARR, in his   \nofficial capacity as the  Judge Harry D.

( 10/10/2019  Final  Judgment  and  Order,  Dkt. \nNo. 86.)  Considering  this  opinion  and  the  Seventh  Circuit’s \nApril 29, 2020 opinion, as amended on June 4, 2020, the parties \nshall submit either an agreed amended final judgment and order or \ncompeting final judgment and orders for the Court to consider on \nor before February 2, 2021. \nI.  PROCEDURAL POSTURE \n  The Court considers certain modifications to its October 10, \n2019 final judgment and order as directed by the Seventh Circuit \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 126 Filed: 01/13/21 Page 2 of 22 PageID #:3535\nSee City of Chi. v. Barr  \non remand.  , 961 F.3d 882 (7th Cir. 2020). \nThat appeal and this remand are the result of two consolidated \ncases  where  the  Attorney  General  appealed  preliminary  and \npermanent injunction orders—one addressing the notice and access \nconditions on FY 2017 Byrne JAG grant applicants and the other \naddressing the conditions on FY 2018 Byrne JAG grant applicants. \nSee, e.g., City of Chi. v.

For a detailed discussion of the case history, facts, and \nissues, the Court refers to its previous opinions and the recent \nCity of Chi.

Supp. 3d 855. \n  On August 11, 2020, the Seventh Circuit returned its mandate. \nThat  mandate  directed  the  Court  to  address  the  following  two \nmatters on remand: (1) whether “any other injunctive relief is \nappropriate in light of [its] determination that § 10153 cannot be \nused to incorporate laws unrelated to the grants or grantees” and \n(2) to “modify the injunction to require the Attorney General to \ncalculate  the  City  of  Chicago’s  Byrne  JAG  grant  as  if  the \nchallenged  conditions  were  universally  inapplicable  to  all \nCity of Chi.\ngrantees.”  , 961 F.3d at 931–32. \n  The Court ordered the parties to meet and confer about the \nSeventh Circuit’s decision and to submit a joint statement with \ntheir proposed modifications to the Court’s final judgment and \n \n- 2 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 126 Filed: 01/13/21 Page 3 of 22 PageID #:3536\norder.  (8/14/2020  Minute  Entry,  Dkt.  No.  117.)  The  parties \nsubmitted their joint statement and proposed further briefing on \nthe two issues. (9/11/2020 Joint Statement, Dkt. No. 118.) The \nCourt adopted that briefing schedule. Based on those briefs, the \nCourt  now  determines  whether  additional  relief  concerning  the \ncompliance condition is appropriate and whether it will adopt any \nproposed modifications to the injunction.  \nA.  Additional Relief Concerning the Compliance Condition \n  The Byrne JAG statute permits the Attorney General to require \nthat an application for funding under the Byrne JAG program also \ninclude a certification that “the applicant will comply with all \nprovisions of this part and all other applicable Federal laws.”  \n34 U.S.C. § 10153(a)(5)(D). For FY 2018, the Attorney General’s \ncondition  under  this  provision  required  certification  of \ncompliance with 8 U.S.C. §§ 1373 & 1644. The Attorney General \npreviously defended this compliance condition on the basis that \n§§ 1373 & 1644 qualified as applicable federal laws. The Court \nfound  §§  1373  &  1644  facially  unconstitutional  and  thus \nunenforceable as part of the Attorney General’s certificate of \nCity of Chi.\ncompliance with “applicable Federal laws.”  , 321 F. \nCity of Chi.\nSupp. 3d at 875–76;  , 405 F. Supp. 3d at 762–63.  \n  The  Seventh  Circuit  affirmed  the  Court’s  judgment  that \n§§ 1373 & 1644 were not “applicable Federal laws” on different \nSee City of Chi.  \ngrounds.  , 961 F.3d at 898–99. Without reaching \n \n- 3 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 126 Filed: 01/13/21 Page 4 of 22 PageID #:3537\nthe constitutional question, the Seventh Circuit held that the \nphrase “applicable Federal laws” includes only those laws that \nId. see also \n“apply by their terms to the award itself.”   at 899; \nid.\n at 909. The Attorney General lacks the authority to impose \nlaws that do not specifically apply to the grant or grantees as \nSee id.\ncompliance conditions.   at 901. Because § 1373 and § 1644 \ndo not specifically apply to the grant or grantees, they cannot be \nSee id.\nimposed as compliance conditions.    \n  The Seventh Circuit then remanded “for the district court to \nconsider whether any additional injunctive relief is appropriate \nId.\nas to the unlawful imposition of the compliance condition.”   at \n911. The Seventh Circuit concluded that there is “no doubt that \nthe Attorney General intends to continue to interpret § 10153 as \nallowing the incorporation of federal laws unrelated to the grant \nor grantees” and that, as a result, “proper relief in this case \ncould include an injunction preventing the Attorney General from \nincorporating federal law unrelated to grants or grantees as a \nId.\ncondition of the grant under § 10153.”   at 912. \n  In light of the Seventh Circuit’s remand, the parties agree \nthat the Court should modify the first paragraph under the header \n“Permanent Injunction” of its final judgment and order to reflect \nthe Seventh Circuit’s conclusion that § 10153’s reference to “all \napplicable  Federal  laws”  only  encompasses  laws  that  expressly \napply to federal grants or grant recipients. The parties do not \n \n- 4 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 126 Filed: 01/13/21 Page 5 of 22 PageID #:3538\nagree, however, on whether and how to modify the first paragraph \nunder  the  header  “Declaratory  Relief”—declaring  “that  8  U.S.C. \n§§ 1373 and 1644 violate the Tenth Amendment’s anticommandeering \nprinciples and are therefore facially unconstitutional.” \n  Chicago contends the Court’s declaration that §§ 1373 and \n1644 are unconstitutional should remain in effect. Chicago argues \nthat Count Four of the Amended Complaint challenges §§ 1373 and \n1644  “on  grounds  beyond  just  their  application  as  funding \nconditions” and that “relief narrowly limited to the Byrne JAG \nprogram is therefore not complete relief.” (Chi. Br. at 6, Dkt. \nNo. 121.) Chicago also argues that “the Attorney General’s pattern \nof  aggressively  enforcing  an  expansive  interpretation  of \nSection 1373  casts  a  ‘continuing  and  brooding  presence’  over \nId.\nChicago’s  Welcoming  City  Ordinance.”  ( )  Chicago  claims  that \nonly the Court’s declaration that §§ 1373 and 1644 violate Tenth \nAmendment  anticommandeering  principles  can  “fully  protect \nChicago’s right to set local law-enforcement priorities free from \nId.\nthe threat of unlawful federal intervention.” ( )  \n  In  response,  the  Attorney  General  argues  the  Court’s \ndeclaration  that  §§ 1373  and  1644  are  unconstitutional  is \nunnecessary and moot. The Attorney General claims that, as framed \nin  the  Amended  Complaint,  Count  Four  ties  §§  1373  and  1644’s \nconstitutionality to their use in Byrne JAG award conditions. Thus, \ncomplete relief is satisfied by the injunction, and declaratory \n \n- 5 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 126 Filed: 01/13/21 Page 6 of 22 PageID #:3539\nrelief  is  unnecessary  and  moot.  The  Attorney  General  also \nencourages  the  Court  to  practice  constitutional  avoidance.  In \ndoing  so,  he  notes  the  Seventh  Circuit’s  decision  to  practice \nconstitutional  avoidance  in  its  remanding  opinion,  calling  it \n“controlling precedent” that “determined that the proper scope of \ndeclaratory  relief  as  to  [§§]  1373  and  1644  is  exactly  none, \nbecause  they  are  ‘inapplicable’  as  related  to  Byrne  JAG  award \nCity of Chi.\nconditions.” (Gov. Resp. at 3 (citing  , 961 F.3d at \n911),  Dkt.  No.  124.)  The  Attorney  General  emphasizes  that  the \nSeventh  Circuit  limited  remand  to  determining  “whether  any \ninjunctive \nadditional  relief  is  appropriate  as  to  the  [  ] \nimposition of the compliance condition,” and the district court’s \ncompletion of that task does not involve revisiting declaratory \nrelief  that  the  “Seventh  Circuit  determined  was  unnecessary.” \nCity of Chi.\n(Gov. Resp. at 2 ( , 961 F.3d at 911).) \n  The Court withdraws its declaration that §§ 1373 and 1644 are \nunconstitutional. Although the Seventh Circuit’s mandate does not \norder the Court to vacate its declaration, the remanding opinion \nindicates that the declaratory judgment is no longer necessary. \nSee Guzman v. City of Chi.\n, No. 05 CV 6617, 2010 WL 11627264, at \n*1 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 25, 2010) (stating that a “court must carefully \nread the Seventh Circuit’s opinion to determine what issues are \nlaw of the case because they were decided expressly or by necessary \nimplication”). In reaching its conclusion, the Court considers the \n \n- 6 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 126 Filed: 01/13/21 Page 7 of 22 PageID #:3540\nSee Meds. Co. \ncontext surrounding the Seventh Circuit’s directive. \nv. Mylan Inc.\n, 257 F. Supp. 3d 1023, 1029 (N.D. Ill. 2017) (“A \nmandate is to be construed by considering the context”) (citation, \nquotations, and alterations omitted). The language at issue here \nis in the second paragraph of a sub-section about the proper scope \nof the permanent injunction. Before reaching the substance of the \nscope issue, the Seventh Circuit states: \nAt the outset, we note that a remand is necessary for \nthe district court to consider whether any additional \ninjunctive  relief  is  appropriate  as  to  the  unlawful \nimposition  of  the  compliance  condition. The  court \nimposed declaratory relief as to the constitutionality \nof § 1373, and injunctive relief as to the imposition of \nthat condition. But because we have determined that the \nterm “all other applicable Federal law” encompasses only \nlaw  that  by  its  terms  applies  to  federal  grants  or \ngrantees in that capacity, we have not reached that Tenth \nAmendment  issue.  A  remand  is  required  to  allow  the \ndistrict  court  to  determine  whether  any  additional \ninjunctive relief is appropriate for the violation as we \nhave  framed  it. For  instance,  the  declaratory  relief \nwould  no  longer  be  necessary  because § 1373 is \ninapplicable here, but other injunctive relief might be \nproper,  such  as  enjoining  the  Attorney  General  from \ninterpreting the phrase “all other applicable federal \nlaw” to include laws that do not explicitly apply by \ntheir  terms  to  the  grant  or  grantees. The  Attorney \nGeneral relied on that misuse of § 10153 to impose the \n§ 1373 compliance condition on Chicago. In the FY 2018 \ngrant,  the  government  continues  to  require  a \ncertification  of  compliance  with §  1373,  but  perhaps \nanticipating the foreclosure of that option, added the \nrequirement  of  certification  of  compliance  with  the \nparallel provision in § 1644. \n \nId.\n at 911 (emphasis added). \n  As explained by the Seventh Circuit, declaratory judgment is \nno  longer  necessary  to  award  complete  relief  to  Chicago.  By \n \n- 7 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 126 Filed: 01/13/21 Page 8 of 22 PageID #:3541\nemploying the doctrine of constitutional avoidance, the Seventh \nCircuit  did  not  reach  the  question  of  §§ 1373’s  and  1644’s \nconstitutionality.  The  Court,  in  addressing  the  violation  as \nframed by the Seventh Circuit, reaches the same conclusion. The \nCourt follows the fundamental principle of judicial restraint and \nforbears  to  “resolve  a  constitutional  dispute  unless  that \nFrier v. City of Vandalia, \n[resolution] is absolutely necessary.” \nIll.\n, 770 F.2d 699, 701 (7th Cir. 1985).  \n  Chicago  argues  an  expansive  injury  beyond  the  Byrne  JAG \nprogram necessitates maintaining the declaration. This lawsuit, \nhowever,  focuses  on  Chicago’s  injury  from  unlawful  conditions \nattached to Byrne JAG fund grants. Chicago argues the declaration \nis necessary to control a “continuing and brooding presence” and \nto “fully protect Chicago’s right to set local law-enforcement \npriorities free from the threat of unlawful federal intervention.” \n(Chi. Br. at 6.) But these issues go far beyond the scope of this \ncase. The Court cannot divorce Chicago’s arguments against §§ 1373 \nand 1644 from the central subject of this dispute.  \n  The Seventh Circuit’s opinion forbidding the application of \n§§ 1373 and 1644 as conditions to Byrne JAG award grants moots \nthis issue. “Federal courts may not give opinions on moot questions \nDorel  Juvenile  Grp.,  Inc.  v. \nor  abstract  propositions.” \nDiMartinis Calderon v. \n, 495 F.3d 500, 503 (7th Cir. 2007) (citing \nMoore\n, 518 U.S. 149, 150 (1996)). Whether these statutes “remain \n \n- 8 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 126 Filed: 01/13/21 Page 9 of 22 PageID #:3542\nostensibly  enforceable  federal  laws  that  the  Department  could \ninvoke against the City by other means” is not the crux of this \ncase nor a live controversy appropriate for the Court to decide. \n(Chi. Br. at 1.) Accordingly, the Court withdraws its declaration \nthat §§ 1373 and 1644 are unconstitutional. \nB.  Proposed Modifications to Injunction \n  The Court’s final order and judgment expressly “run[s] to the \nbenefit of all Byrne JAG applicants and recipients” and is “not \nlimited  to  the  City  of  Chicago  and  its  sub-grantees.”  (Final \nJudgment and Order at 4.) But the Court stayed its injunction “as \nto all Byrne JAG grantees other than the City of Chicago and its \nsub-grantees”  pending  the  Seventh  Circuit’s  final  opinion  and \nId.\njudgment. ( ) The Court noted that the “stay shall terminate \nautomatically if the Seventh Circuit issues a final ruling . . . \nthat affirms the nationwide application of the FY 2017 injunction.” \nId.\n( ) \n  The  Seventh  Circuit  determined  that  under  the  Byrne  JAG \nprogram “the amount received by a specific state or locality is \ndependent  on  the  calculations  related  to  the  other  states  and \nCity of Chi.\nlocalities.”  , 961 F.3d at 921. Thus, it found “the \nimposition of the conditions” should be enjoined “to the extent \nnecessary to ensure that Chicago receives the grant award that it \nwould be entitled to if the unlawful conditions were not imposed.” \nId.\n  at  929.  Because  the  Seventh  Circuit  understood  that  the \n \n- 9 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 126 Filed: 01/13/21 Page 10 of 22 PageID #:3543\nnationwide injunction “is necessary to provide complete relief to \nChicago  itself,  the  concern  with  improperly  extending  relief \nbeyond the particular plaintiff does not apply, and therefore there \nis no reason to stay the application of the injunctive relief.” \nId. \nat 932. \n  Although  the  Seventh  Circuit  understood  that  the \n“interrelated  and  interdependent”  nature  of  Byrne  JAG  awards \nid. \nlikely necessitated nationwide relief,  at 929–30, the Seventh \nCircuit  instructed  the  Court  to  modify  the  language  of  the \ninjunction to be as limited as possible, such that it would require \nthe Attorney General to calculate Chicago’s Byrne JAG award “as if \nthe  challenged  conditions  were  universally  inapplicable  to  all \nId. \ngrantees.”  at 930. Accordingly, the Court allowed the Attorney \nGeneral the opportunity to explain (1) whether he can calculate \nChicago’s Byrne JAG award as if no grantee or potential grantee \nwere  subject  to  the  unlawful  conditions;  (2)  if  so,  how  that \ncalculation would work; and (3) why the Attorney General believes \nthis approach suffices to meet the requirements set forth in the \nSeventh Circuit’s decision.  \n1.  Byrne JAG Funds Calculation \n  The  Attorney  General  provides  a  declaration  from  Tracey \nTrautman, the Principal Deputy Director of the Bureau of Justice \nAssistance (“BJA”) within the Office of Justice Program (“OJP”) of \nthe United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”), to explain the \n \n- 10 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 126 Filed: 01/13/21 Page 11 of 22 PageID #:3544\nstatutory formula and calculation process for Byrne JAG awards. \nSee \n( Trautman Decl., Gov. Br., Ex. A, Dkt. No. 122-1.) Trautman \nexplains that the BJA calculates Byrne JAG awards according to the \nId.\nstatutory formula provided in 34 U.S.C. § 10156. (  ¶ 2.)  \na.  State Awards \n  Under the statutory formula, “each state’s award allocation \nis based on its population and the number of reported violent \ncrimes in the state, and is calculated each year for every state.” \nId.\n( ) Every state is then “offered the opportunity to apply for \nits award allocation,” which includes a 60% allocation to the state \ngovernment and 40% reserved for direct awards to units of local \nId.\ngovernment within that state. ( ) Of the 60% that goes to the \nstate, a certain statutorily calculated amount “must be used by \nthat  state  to  make  ‘pass-through’  subawards  to  units  of  local \nId.\ngovernment.” ( ) The allocation of these subawards is subject to \nId.\neach individual state’s discretion. ( ) Illinois “has made no \nsubawards to Chicago with funds from the state JAG award for fiscal \nId.\nyear 2017, 2018, or 2019.” ( ) \n  “[N]o state has rejected a JAG award offer or otherwise been \nId.\ndisqualified  from  receiving  one.”  (   ¶  5.)  Were  a  state  to \ndecline, based on the unlawful conditions or otherwise, “the funds \nallocated to that state would be made available to units of local \ngovernment  within  the  state  in  accordance  with  34  U.S.C. \nId.\n§ 10156(f).” ( ) Whether “a state receives, accepts, or declines \n \n- 11 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 126 Filed: 01/13/21 Page 12 of 22 PageID #:3545\nan offer of a JAG award also does not affect the size of an award \nId.\nto another state.” ( )  \n  Two  other  statutes  require  compliance-based  reductions  or \npenalties  to  states’  initial  Byrne  JAG  award  calculations, \nregardless  of  whether  the  state  accepts  a  JAG  award—the  Sex \nOffender Registration and Notification Act (“SORNA”), 34 U.S.C. \n§ 20927(a), and the Prison Rape Elimination Act (“PREA”), 34 U.S.C. \nId.\n§ 30307(e)(2)(A). (  ¶ 6.) SORNA imposes a 10% reduction on a \nstate’s JAG award if the state does not substantially implement \nId.\nits standards. (  ¶ 7.) Similarly, PREA imposes a 5% reduction \nto any DOJ grant funds, including JAG awards, for any state that \nId.\ndoes not certify full compliance with its standards. (  ¶ 8.) If \na state declines its JAG award, all money—including any SORNA or \nPREA reallocation or bonus funds would be reallocated to units of \nId. \nlocal government only within that state. ( ¶¶ 7–8.) If a state \naccepts its JAG award and faces a SORNA or PREA penalty, it may \napply  for  the  penalty  funds  through  a  process  called  direct \nId.\nreallocation.  ( )  SORNA  and  PREA  “penalties  and  direct \nreallocation  awards  are  calculated  separately  from  JAG \nId.\nallocations, but are reflected in a state’s award offer.” (  \n¶ 6.) “Penalties and direct allocation awards are calculated based \nId.\non the formula allocations for JAG awards.” ( ) Their calculation \nis not affected by whether a jurisdiction accepts its JAG award. \nId.\n( ) \n \n- 12 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 126 Filed: 01/13/21 Page 13 of 22 PageID #:3546\n  If penalty funds are not reallocated, they become “bonus” \nId. \nfunds. ( ¶ 9.) Decisions about whether and how to distribute \nthese “bonus” funds among compliant states or whether and how to \ndistribute the “bonus” funds in a targeted fashion “are made prior \nId.\nto JAG allocation calculations.” ( ) These decisions “are made \nwithout regard to whether a state will receive, accept, or reject \na JAG award offer or file a legal challenge to award conditions.” \nId.\n( ) SORNA and PREA penalties, reallocation awards, and bonus \nfunds “are awarded without regard to whether any state accept[s] \nId.\nJAG funds.” (  ¶ 10.) \nb.  Direct Local Awards \n  BJA also awards Byrne JAG funds directly to localities, like \nSee id.\nChicago. (  ¶ 1.) Unlike state awards, “it is common for a \nsmall percentage of units of local government to decline direct \nId.\nlocal JAG awards each year for a variety of reasons.” (  ¶ 11.) \n34 U.S.C. § 10156(d)(4) provides the statutory formula that BJA \nuses each year to calculate what are known as “disparate” groups \nId.\nof jurisdictions. (  ¶ 11 n.1.) If the locality is part of a \ndisparate  group of  jurisdictions,  declined  funds  remain  within \nthat group “to be divided up among themselves at the discretion of \nId.\nthe remaining members of the group.” (  ¶ 11.) If the locality \nis  not  part  of  a  disparate  group  or  a  whole  disparate  group \ndeclines, the declined funds “remain with OJP to be distributed in \nId.\nfuture fiscal years.” ( )  \n \n- 13 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 126 Filed: 01/13/21 Page 14 of 22 PageID #:3547\n  Such funds are “frequently [used for] DOJ priority projects \nthat  are  distinct  from  the  JAG  formula  program,  but  can  also \ninclude augmenting the total amount of JAG funding that is run \nId.\nthrough the formula in a future fiscal year.” ( ) “Roughly 40% \nId. \nof local JAG awards are made to disparate groups each year.” (\n¶  11  n.1.)  Chicago  is  usually  part  of  a  disparate  group  of \nId.\njurisdictions  within  Cook  County.  ( )  For  fiscal  year  2020, \nChicago’s  disparate  group  included  Berwyn,  Calumet,  Chicago \nId.\nHeights, Cicero, Harvey, Matteson, Maywood, and Skokie. ( ) \n2.  The Attorney General’s Proposal \n  The Attorney General’s position is that complete relief in \nSee generally\nthis case does not require a nationwide injunction. (  \nGov. Br. (citing Manion, J.’s concurrence in the judgment and the \nconflict  on  a  nationwide  injunction  with  the  Second  Circuit’s \nNew York v. Department of Justice\ndecision in  , 951 F.3d 84, 90–91 \n(2d Cir. 2020)).) Instead, the Attorney General proposes the Court \n“(1) limit the injunction to Chicago and, at most, Illinois and \nother units of local government within Chicago’s disparate group \nof jurisdictions, and (2) if necessary, limit OJP’s discretion to \nallocate  toward  a  future  year  of  Byrne  JAG  funding  any  funds \ndeclined  by  a  locality  because  of  the  immigration-related \nconditions.” (Gov. Br. at 8, Dkt. No. 122.) The Attorney General \nroots this proposal in Trautman’s explanation of the statutory \nformula  and  calculation  process.  Per  this  explanation,  the \n \n- 14 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 126 Filed: 01/13/21 Page 15 of 22 PageID #:3548\nAttorney  General  argues  that  the  statutory  formula  already \ncalculates Byrne JAG awards as if the challenged conditions were \nuniversally inapplicable because the BJA calculates all state and \nlocal JAG awards regardless of whether the jurisdiction will accept \nor  decline  the  award.  As  a  result,  the  immigration-related \nconditions do not affect how the statutory formula is run.  \n  When a state declines a Byrne JAG award, those funds are \nreallocated to localities within the declining state. Similarly, \nthe immigration-related conditions do not affect reallocation of \nSORNA  and  PREA  penalties  to  a  non-compliant  state  or  bonus \nallocations  to  compliant  states.  Thus,  the  Attorney  General \nconcludes that the immigration-related conditions do not impact \nthe calculation of Byrne JAG allocations among different states \nnor do they impact the calculation of Byrne JAG allocations between \nlocalities in a given fiscal year.  \n  When a locality declines a JAG award, the reallocation differs \nbased on whether the locality is part of a disparate group. For \njurisdictions that are part of a disparate group, declined funds \nare allocated among the remaining members of that disparate group \nat the group’s discretion. For jurisdictions that are not part of \na disparate group or if an entire disparate group declines, the \ndeclined awards remain with the OJP “for a variety of potential \nId.\nuses.” (  at 6.) One such use is to augment total JAG funding \navailable  nationwide  in  a  future  year.  The  Attorney  General \n \n- 15 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 126 Filed: 01/13/21 Page 16 of 22 PageID #:3549\nId.\ncharacterizes this as a “slim possibility.” ( ) Ultimately, the \nAttorney General argues these “effects are either nil (in the case \nof localities that are part of a disparate group of jurisdictions \nother than Chicago’s) or easily accounted for, if necessary (in \nthe case of localities that are not part of any disparate group).” \nId.\n( )  \n  In response, Chicago argues the nationwide injunction should \nremain in place because it is both necessary to provide Chicago \ncomplete relief and the proper remedy under the Administrative \nProcedure  Act  (“APA”).  Chicago  contends  the  Attorney  General’s \nexplanation  demonstrates  that  unused  funding,  either  due  to  a \nlocality’s decision to decline funds or due to a denial of funds \nto the locality because of the unlawful conditions, can impact the \nsize of Chicago’s Byrne JAG award in future years. To Chicago, \nthese effects necessitate a nationwide injunction.    \n  Chicago  argues  the  Attorney  General’s  proposed  injunction \nasks  the  Court  to  substitute  the  present  injunction  with  a \ndifferent one still with nationwide effect—one that would prohibit \nthe  Attorney  General  from  “augmenting  the  total  amount  of  JAG \nfunding that is run through the formula in a future fiscal year.” \n(Chi. Resp. at 1–2 (citing Trautman Decl. ¶ 11), Dkt. No. 123.) \nChicago  contends  this  proposal  would  contravene  the  Seventh \nCircuit’s mandate, replacing a “carefully drawn injunction with \none that could affirmatively harm not only Chicago, but also every \n \n- 16 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 126 Filed: 01/13/21 Page 17 of 22 PageID #:3550\nother jurisdiction eligible for Byrne JAG funds in perpetuity, by \nensuring the Attorney General cannot augment the total pool of \nfunding distributed to those jurisdictions through the Byrne JAG \nformula.” (Chi. Resp. at 2.)  \n3.  Scope of the Injunction \n  The  Seventh  Circuit  instructed  the  Court  to  “modify  the \ninjunction to require the Attorney General to calculate the City \nof Chicago’s Byrne JAG grant as if the challenged conditions were \nCity of Chi.\nuniversally inapplicable to all grantees.”  , 961 F.3d \nat 931–32. The Seventh Circuit gave this directive while discussing \nId.\nits intent to provide “complete relief to Chicago itself.”   at \n929. This is a “limitation” that the Seventh Circuit felt the \ninjunction “should reflect . . . [as] the narrowest relief that \nId.\nwill  redress  the  injury.”    at  929–30.  Thus,  the  Seventh \nCircuit’s instruction to modify the injunction was expressly given \nId. \n“[t]o clarify that focus.”  at 930. The Court revisits the scope \nof the injunction under the lens of this instruction.  \n  The “scope of injunctive relief is dictated by the extent of \nCalifano v. Yamasaki\nthe violation established. . . .”  , 442 U.S. \n682, 702 (1979). Injunctive relief should be “no more burdensome \nto the defendant than necessary to provide complete relief to the \nId.\nplaintiffs.”    A  court  “may  impose  the  equitable  relief \nnecessary to render complete relief to the plaintiff, even if that \nCity of Chi\nrelief extends incidentally to non-parties.”  ., 961 \n \n- 17 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 126 Filed: 01/13/21 Page 18 of 22 PageID #:3551\nF.3d at 920–21. “When the court believes the underlying right to \nbe highly significant, it may write injunctive relief as broad as \nZamecnik v. Indian Prairie Sch. Dist. No. 204\nthe right itself.”  , \nLaw of \n636 F.3d 874, 879 (7th Cir. 2011) (citing 1 Dan B. Dobbs, \nRemedies\n § 2.4(6) (2d ed. 1993)).  \n  The Seventh Circuit found that once it “concluded that the \nAttorney General is without the authority to impose the challenged \nconditions,  the  court’s  role  should  be  to  ensure  that  Chicago \nreceives  the  grant  it  would  have  been  entitled  to  absent  the \nCity of Chi.\nunlawful conditions.”  , 961 F.3d at 922. It continued, \n“[t]hat can only be assured if the Byrne JAG awards as a whole are \nId. \ncalculated absent the imposition of the unlawful conditions.” \nTrautman’s  explanation  of  the  Byrne  JAG  statutory  formula  and \ncalculation process clarifies certain ambiguities, some flagged by \nSee id.\nJudge Manion in his concurrence.   at 929 (“At oral argument, \nthe  Attorney  General  again  declared  only  that  it  is  ‘unclear’ \nwhether  funds  from  another  applicant  could  increase  Chicago’s \naward if the conditions rendered that applicant unable to retain \nsee also id.\nor obtain a Byrne JAG award . . .”);   at 934–36 (Manion, \nJ., concurring in the judgment) (explaining the Byrne JAG statute). \nEven as clarified, the imposition of the unlawful conditions on \nother jurisdictions can impact Chicago’s grant award in future \nyears.  Thus,  while  the  Attorney  General  initially  calculates \nChicago’s  Byrne  JAG  grant  award  as  if  the  conditions  were \n \n- 18 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 126 Filed: 01/13/21 Page 19 of 22 PageID #:3552\nuniversally inapplicable, the conditions still impact the overall \naward calculation for Chicago. \n  The Attorney General acknowledges that Chicago’s Byrne JAG \naward is impacted if any locality, within Illinois or in another \nstate, declines or is denied funds because the DOJ can use those \n“declined  funds  to  augment  the  total  amount  of  JAG  funding \navailable nationwide in a future fiscal year.” (Gov. Br. at 6.) \nThis  means  that  imposing  the  unlawful  conditions  on  other \nlocalities could result in a larger award for Chicago in future \ngrant years. Whether the unlawful conditions could result in an \nincrease or decrease to Chicago’s award, the Seventh Circuit made \nSee City of Chi.\nclear that any impact is unacceptable.  , 961 F.3d \nat 922. Therefore, as the Court previously concluded, the only way \nto provide complete relief to Chicago is by enjoining the unlawful \nconditions program-wide.  \n  The Attorney General’s proposed alternative injunction is an \nunacceptable  alternative  because  it  is  both  underinclusive  and \noverinclusive. The Attorney General proposes the Court “(1) limit \nthe injunction to Chicago and, at most, Illinois and other units \nof  local  government  within  Chicago’s  disparate  group  of \njurisdictions, and (2) if necessary, limit OJP’s discretion to \nreallocate toward a future year of Byrne JAG funding any funds \ndeclined  by  a  locality  because  of  the  immigration-related \nconditions.” (Gov. Br. at 8.) As to the first part of the proposal, \n \n- 19 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 126 Filed: 01/13/21 Page 20 of 22 PageID #:3553\nlimiting the injunction to Chicago alone fails to account for the \ninarguable  effect  that  decisions  of  other  localities  within \nChicago’s disparate group and Illinois have on Chicago’s Byrne JAG \naward. Nor can the Court cannot feasibly limit the injunction to \nIllinois because, as explained by Trautman and acknowledged by the \nAttorney General, decisions made by localities outside of Illinois \ncan impact Chicago’s Byrne JAG award. These proposed limitations \nare underinclusive and would not provide Chicago with complete \nrelief. \n  In  the  second  part  of  his  proposal,  the  Attorney  General \nattempts to account for the acknowledged impact of the unlawful \nconditions. The Attorney General asks the Court to replace the \nexisting  nationwide  injunction  with  one  that  enjoins  the \naugmentation of the overall pool of Byrne JAG funds available in \nfuture grant years with funds declined by localities. This proposal \nis overinclusive. The effect of the proposal reaches beyond the \nByrne  JAG  program  into  the  decision-making  processes  of  this \nadministration  and  future  administrations.  It  does  not \nspecifically target the unlawful conditions nor is it more narrowly \ntailored than the existing nationwide injunction. Further, this \noverly broad proposed injunction is only necessary if the unlawful \nconditions are still imposed on jurisdictions other than Chicago. \nEnjoining the conditions program-wide eliminates the need for this \nalternative. \n \n- 20 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 126 Filed: 01/13/21 Page 21 of 22 PageID #:3554\n  The Court does not, and did not previously, issue a nationwide \ninjunction lightly. It is aware, as was the Seventh Circuit, of \nNew York v. Department of Justice\nthe Second Circuit’s decision in  , \nSee City of Chi.\n951 F.3d 84, 90–91 (2d Cir. 2020).  , 961 F.3d at \n887. Nevertheless, a nationwide injunction is necessary and proper \nSee City of Chi.\nto protect Chicago.  , 961 F.3d at 929 (“Courts \nproper id.\nhave an obligation to award   relief.);   (finding “program-\nwide application is necessary to provide complete relief to Chicago \nsee  also  City  of  Chi.\nitself”);  ,  405  F.  Supp.  3d  at  767–71 \nCity \n(explaining the need for a permanent nationwide injunction); \nof  Chi.\n,  321  F.  Supp.  3d  at  876–82  (same).  Because  the  Court \nrefuses to adopt the Attorney General’s proposal based on equitable \nprinciples, it need not reach Chicago’s APA argument.  \n  The  Seventh  Circuit  instructed  the  Court  to  modify  the \ninjunction so that it reflects “the narrowest relief that will \nCity  of  Chi.\nredress  the  injury.”  ,  961  F.3d  at  929–30. \nSpecifically, “[a]ny impact on other grantees in that context is \nincidental, rather than direct, and the injunction does not provide \nId. \nthose  grantees  with  independently-enforceable  rights.” \nTherefore, the parties are instructed to propose modifications to \nthe injunction that clarify this focus and the intent to provide \nChicago “with complete relief, while keeping the injunction as \nId. \nnarrow as possible.”  As directed, such modifications should \nrequire the Attorney General to calculate Chicago’s Byrne JAG grant \n \n- 21 - \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 126 Filed: 01/13/21 Page 22 of 22 PageID #:3555\nas if the challenged conditions were universally inapplicable to \nall grantees. \nII.  CONCLUSION \n  For  the  reasons  stated  herein,  the  Court  withdraws  its \ndeclaration that 8 U.S.C. §§ 1373 and 1644 are unconstitutional \nand  declines  the  Attorney  General’s  proposal  to  modify  the \nnationwide  scope  of  the  injunction  against  the  compliance \nconditions.  Considering  this  opinion  and  the  Seventh  Circuit’s \nApril 29, 2020 opinion, as amended on June 4, 2020, the parties \nshall submit either an agreed amended final judgment and order or \ncompeting final judgment and orders for the Court to consider on \nor before February 2, 2021. \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                           \n              Harry D.

Leinenweber \nMONTY WILKINSON, Acting Attorney \nGeneral of the United States, \nDefendant. \n \nAMENDED FINAL JUDGMENT AND ORDER \nNow, this 5th day of February 2021, for the reasons set forth in the Court’s Memorandum \nOpinions of September 19, 2019 (Dkt. 80) and January 13, 2021 (Dkt. 126), and the Court of \nAppeals’ June 4, 2020 Amended Opinion, see City of Chicago v. Barr, 961 F.3d 882 (7th Cir. \n2020), it is hereby ORDERED that judgment be entered in favor of Plaintiff, the City of Chicago \n(the “City” or “Chicago”), and against Defendant, Monty Wilkinson, in his official capacity as \nActing Attorney General of the United States.  Consistent with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n65, the Court grants the City declaratory and injunctive relief as set forth below. \nThrough this lawsuit, the City challenges the Attorney General’s decision to attach six \nconditions to the FY 2018 Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (“Byrne JAG”), \nspecifically: \n1.  The “Notice Condition” requires that Byrne JAG recipients “provide—as early \nas practicable … —advance notice to [the Department of Homeland Security \n(DHS)] of the scheduled release date and time for a particular alien, if a State or \nlocal government (or government-contracted) correctional facility receives from \nDHS a formal written request pursuant to the INA that seeks such advance notice.” \n2.  The “Access Condition” requires that Byrne JAG recipients permit federal \ngovernment agents “access to any State or local government (or government-\ncontracted) correctional facility by such agents for the purpose” of “interrogat[ing] \n1 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 128 Filed: 02/05/21 Page 2 of 4 PageID #:3563\n \nany alien or person believed to be an alien as to his [or her] right to be or to remain \nin the United States.” \n3.  The “Section 1373 Compliance Condition” requires that Byrne JAG recipients \ncertify compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373. \n4.  The “Section 1644 Compliance Condition” requires that Byrne JAG recipients \ncertify compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1644. \n5.  The “Harboring Condition” prohibits Byrne JAG recipients from making any \n“public disclosure … of any federal law enforcement information in a direct or \nindirect attempt to conceal, harbor, or shield from detection any fugitive from \njustice under 18 U.S.C. ch. 49, or any alien who has come to, entered, or remains \nin the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. ch. 12—without regard to whether such \ndisclosure would constitute (or could form a predicate for) a violation of 18 U.S.C. \n1071 or 1072 or of 8 U.S.C. 1324(a).” \n6.  The “Additional Certification Requirement” requires the recipient jurisdiction \nto submit “Certifications and Assurances by the Chief Executive of the Applicant \nGovernment.” The condition incorporates a requirement that the City’s Chief Legal \nofficer certify that “neither the jurisdiction nor any entity, agency, or official of the \njurisdiction has in effect … any law, rule, policy, or practice that would apply to \nthe ‘program or activity’ to be funded … that would or does—(a) impede the \nexercise by federal officers of authority under 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a); or (b) impede \nthe exercise by federal officers of authority relating to 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a) or (c), 8 \nU.S.C. § 1231(a), or 8 U.S.C. § 1366(1) or (3).” \nThese conditions are referred to herein as the “Challenged Conditions.” \nI.  DECLARATORY RELIEF \nFor the reasons stated in the aforementioned Opinions of this Court and the Court of \nAppeals, the Court declares that the Attorney General exceeded the authority delegated by \nCongress in the Byrne JAG statute (34 U.S.C. § 10151 et seq.) and in 34 U.S.C. § 10102(a), in \nattaching the Challenged Conditions to the FY 2018 Byrne JAG grant. \nThe Court further declares that the Attorney General’s decision to attach the Challenged \nConditions to the FY 2018 Byrne JAG grant violated the constitutional principle of separation of \npowers. \n2 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 128 Filed: 02/05/21 Page 3 of 4 PageID #:3564\n \nII.  PERMANENT INJUNCTION \nFor the reasons stated in the aforementioned Opinions of this Court and the Court of \nAppeals, it is hereby ORDERED that the Attorney General’s decision to attach the Challenged \nConditions to the FY 2018 Byrne JAG grant is set aside and shall have no legal effect.  The \nAttorney General is enjoined from denying or delaying issuance of any FY 2018 Byrne JAG award \ninsofar as that denial or delay is based on the Challenged Conditions.  The Attorney General is \nfurther enjoined from denying or delaying issuance of the Byrne JAG award in FY 2019 or any \nother future program year insofar as that denial or delay is based on the Challenged Conditions or \nmaterially identical conditions.  Prohibited conduct includes: using the Challenged Conditions, or \nmaterially identical conditions, in any Byrne JAG award document; delaying the processing or \napproval of a recipient’s requests to draw upon Byrne JAG funds based on the Challenged \nConditions or materially identical conditions; and enforcing the Conditions or materially identical \nconditions against Byrne JAG recipients, regardless of whether those conditions appeared in Byrne \nJAG award documents.  No recipient’s acceptance of its Byrne JAG award may be construed as \nacceptance of the Challenged Conditions or materially identical conditions.  For purposes of this \ninjunction, “delay” means the failure or refusal to take an action that the Attorney General has \ntaken for any other Byrne JAG recipient, if that failure or refusal is based in any way on (1) an \napplicant’s compliance or lack of compliance with the Challenged Conditions or materially \nidentical conditions or (2) litigation involving the Challenged Conditions or materially identical \nconditions, including if such failure or refusal is based on the Attorney General’s seeking to \npreserve the ability to impose or enforce the Challenged Conditions or materially identical \nconditions in the future.  The Attorney General is further enjoined from requiring that Byrne JAG \ngrantees certify compliance, pursuant to 34 U.S.C. § 10153(a)(5)(D), with Federal laws that do not \nexpressly apply to federal grants or grant recipients, such as 8 U.S.C. §§ 1373 and 1644. \n3 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 128 Filed: 02/05/21 Page 4 of 4 PageID #:3565\n \nThis Order applies to the Attorney General’s imposition of the Challenged Conditions and \nany materially identical conditions on the Byrne JAG grant program in FY 2018 and all future \ngrant years.  Its effects run to the benefit of all Byrne JAG applicants and recipients and are not \nlimited to the City of Chicago and its sub-grantees.  \nIII.  FINAL JUDGMENT \nThere are two remaining Counts in this case: Count IV and Count VI.    \nIn light of the Court of Appeals’ holding that §§ 1373 and 1644 are not “applicable Federal \nlaws” because they do not “apply by their terms to the award itself,” City of Chicago v. Barr, 961 \nat 899, the Court withdraws its prior declaration that §§ 1373 and 1644 are unconstitutional and \ndismisses Count IV as moot, without prejudice. \nThe parties have agreed to dismiss Count VI without prejudice, and the Court accordingly \ndismisses Count VI without prejudice.  \nThere being no Counts remaining to be decided on the merits, the Court now enters final \njudgment in this case.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 58. \nIV.  ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS \nPlaintiff may still seek reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs in this matter. 28 U.S.C. § 2412. \nDefendants are entitled to object to or oppose any attempt by Plaintiff to recover the same. Any \nmotion regarding attorneys’ fees and costs shall be made in accordance with the procedures and \nschedule set forth in Local Rule 54.3 \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n/s/           \nHarry D.

      "text": "Case: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 86 Filed: 10/10/19 Page 1 of 5 PageID #:2982\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS \nEASTERN DIVISION \n \nTHE CITY OF CHICAGO,   \n   \nPlaintiff,   \n  Case No. 18 CV 06859 \nv.   \n  Judge Harry D. Leinenweber \nWILLIAM P. BARR, Attorney   \nGeneral of the United States, \n \nDefendant. \n \n \nFINAL JUDGMENT AND ORDER \n \n  Now, this 10th day of October 2019, for the reasons set forth in the Court’s \nMemorandum Opinion of September 19, 2019 (Dkt. 80), it is hereby ORDERED that \njudgment be entered in favor of Plaintiff, the City of Chicago (the “City” or “Chicago”), \nand against Defendant, William P. Barr, in his official capacity as Attorney General \nof the United States. Consistent with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 and 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706, the Court grants the City declaratory and injunctive relief as set forth below. \n  Through this lawsuit, the City challenges the Attorney General’s decision to \nattach six conditions to the FY 2018 Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance \nGrant (“Byrne JAG”), specifically:  \n1. The “Notice Condition” requires that Byrne JAG recipients “provide—\nas  early  as  practicable…  —advance  notice  to  [the  Department  of \nHomeland Security (DHS)] of the scheduled release date and time for a \nparticular  alien,  if  a  State  or  local  government  (or  government-\ncontracted) correctional facility receives from DHS a formal written \nrequest pursuant to the INA that seeks such advance notice.”  \n \n1 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 86 Filed: 10/10/19 Page 2 of 5 PageID #:2982\n2. The “Access Condition” requires that Byrne JAG recipients permit \nfederal government agents “access to any State or local government (or \ngovernment-contracted)  correctional  facility  by  such  agents  for  the \npurpose” of “interrogat[ing] any alien or person believed to be an alien \nas to his [or her] right to be or to remain in the United States.”  \n \n3. The “Section 1373 Compliance Condition” requires that Byrne JAG \nrecipients certify compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373.  \n \n4. The “Section 1644 Compliance Condition” requires that Byrne JAG \nrecipients certify compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1644.  \n \n5.  The  “Harboring  Condition”  prohibits  Byrne  JAG  recipients  from \nmaking  any  “public  disclosure…  of  any  federal  law  enforcement \ninformation in a direct or indirect attempt to conceal, harbor, or shield \nfrom detection any fugitive from justice under 18 U.S.C. ch. 49, or any \nalien who has come to, entered, or remains in the United States in \nviolation of 8 U.S.C. ch. 12—without regard to whether such disclosure \nwould constitute (or could form a predicate for) a violation of 18 U.S.C. \n1071 or 1072 or of 8 U.S.C. 1324(a).”  \n \n6. The “Additional Certification Requirement” requires the recipient \njurisdiction  to  submit  “Certifications  and  Assurances  by  the  Chief \nExecutive of the Applicant Government.” The condition incorporates a \nrequirement that the City’s Chief Legal officer certify that “neither the \njurisdiction nor any entity, agency, or official of the jurisdiction has in \neffect  …  any  law,  rule,  policy,  or  practice  that  would  apply  to  the \n‘program or activity’ to be funded … that would or does—(a) impede the \nexercise by federal officers of authority under 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a); or (b) \nimpede the exercise by federal officers of authority relating to 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1226(a) or (c), 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a), or 8 U.S.C. § 1366(1) or (3).”  \n \nThese conditions are referred to herein as the “Challenged Conditions.”  \n \nI. DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n  For the reasons stated in the Court’s aforementioned Memorandum Opinion, \nthe Court declares that 8 U.S.C. §§ 1373 and 1644 violate the Tenth Amendment’s \nanticommandeering principles and are therefore facially unconstitutional.  \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 86 Filed: 10/10/19 Page 3 of 5 PageID #:2982\n  The Court further declares that the Attorney General exceeded the authority \ndelegated by Congress in the Byrne JAG statute (34 U.S.C. § 10151 et seq.) and in 34 \nU.S.C. § 10102(a), in attaching the Challenged Conditions to the FY 2018 Byrne JAG \ngrant.  \n  Finally, the Court declares that the Attorney General’s decision to attach the \nChallenged Conditions to the FY 2018 Byrne JAG grant violated the constitutional \nprinciple of separation of powers.  \nII. PERMANENT INJUNCTION \n \n  For the reasons stated above and in the Court’s Memorandum Opinion, it is \nhereby ORDERED that the Attorney General’s decision to attach the Challenged \nConditions to the FY 2018 Byrne JAG grant is set aside and shall have no legal effect. \nThe Attorney General is enjoined from denying or delaying issuance of any FY 2018 \nByrne  JAG  award  insofar  as  that  denial  or  delay  is  based  on  the  Challenged \nConditions.  The  Attorney  General  is  further  enjoined  from  denying  or  delaying \nissuance of the Byrne JAG award in FY 2019 or any other future program year insofar \nas that denial or delay is based on the Challenged Conditions or materially identical \nconditions.  Prohibited  conduct  includes:  using  the  Challenged  Conditions,  or \nmaterially identical conditions, in any Byrne JAG award document; delaying the \nprocessing or approval of a recipient’s requests to draw upon Byrne JAG funds based \non the Challenged Conditions or materially identical conditions; and enforcing the \nConditions  or  materially  identical  conditions  against  Byrne  JAG  recipients, \nregardless of whether those conditions appeared in Byrne JAG award documents. No \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 86 Filed: 10/10/19 Page 4 of 5 PageID #:2982\nrecipient’s acceptance of its Byrne JAG award may be construed as acceptance of the \nChallenged  Conditions  or  materially  identical  conditions.  For  purposes  of  this \ninjunction, “delay” means the failure or refusal to take an action that the Attorney \nGeneral has taken for any other Byrne JAG recipient, if that failure or refusal is \nbased in any way on (1) an applicant’s compliance or lack of compliance with the \nChallenged Conditions or materially identical conditions or (2) litigation involving \nthe Challenged Conditions or materially identical conditions, including if such failure \nor refusal is based on the Attorney General’s seeking to preserve the ability to impose \nor enforce the Challenged Conditions or materially identical conditions in the future. \n  This Order applies to the Attorney General’s imposition of the Challenged \nConditions and any materially identical conditions on the Byrne JAG grant program \nin FY 2018 and all future grant years. Its effects run to the benefit of all Byrne JAG \napplicants and recipients are not limited to the City of Chicago and its sub-grantees. \nHowever, for the reasons set forth in Court’s Memorandum Opinion, the Court enters \na stay of the injunction as to all Byrne JAG grantees other than the City of Chicago \nand its sub-grantees. The stay shall terminate automatically if the Seventh Circuit \nissues a final ruling in City of Chicago v. William Barr, No. 18-2885 (7th Cir.) that \naffirms the nationwide application of the FY 2017 injunction.  \nIII. FINAL JUDGMENT \n \n  The only remaining Count in this case is Count VI. The parties have agreed to \ndismiss that Count without prejudice, and the Court accordingly dismisses Count VI \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 86 Filed: 10/10/19 Page 5 of 5 PageID #:2982\nwithout prejudice. There being no Counts remaining to be decided on the merits, the \nCourt now enters final judgment in this case. Fed. R. Civ. P. 58.  \nIV. ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS \n \n  Plaintiff may still seek reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs in this matter. 28 \nU.S.C. § 2412. Defendants are entitled to object to or oppose any attempt by Plaintiff \nto recover the same. Any motion regarding attorneys’ fees and costs shall be made in \naccordance with the procedures and schedule set forth in Local Rule 54.3.  \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                           \n              Harry D.

Harry D. Leinenweber \nMERRICK B. GARLAND, in his official capacity   \nas Attorney General of the United States,    \n \n    Defendant. \n \n \nAMENDED FINAL JUDGMENT AND ORDER \n \nNow, this 8th day of March 2022, for the reasons set forth in the Court’s \nMemorandum Opinions of September 19, 2019 (Dkt. 80) and January 13, 2021 (Dkt. 126), \nand the Court of Appeals’ June 4, 2020 Amended Opinion, see City of Chicago v. Barr, 961 F.3d \n882 (7th Cir. 2020), it is hereby ORDERED that judgment be entered in favor of Plaintiff, \nthe City of Chicago (the “City” or “Chicago”), and against Defendant, Attorney General of \nthe United States. Consistent with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65, the Court grants the \nCity declaratory and injunctive relief as set forth below.  \nThrough this lawsuit, the City challenges the Attorney General’s decision to attach \nsix conditions to the FY 2018 Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (“Byrne \nJAG”), specifically: \n1. The “Notice Condition” requires that Byrne JAG recipients “provide—as early as \npracticable … —advance notice to [the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)] of the \nscheduled release date and time for a particular alien, if a State or local government (or \ngovernment-contracted) correctional facility receives from DHS a formal written request \npursuant to the INA that seeks such advance notice.”  \n2. The “Access Condition” requires that Byrne JAG recipients permit federal \ngovernment agents “access to any State or local government (or government-contracted) \ncorrectional facility by such agents for the purpose” of “interrogat[ing] any alien or person \nbelieved to be an alien as to his [or her] right to be or to remain in the United States.”  \n3. The “Section 1373 Compliance Condition” requires that Byrne JAG recipients \ncertify compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373.  \n4. The “Section 1644 Compliance Condition” requires that Byrne JAG recipients \ncertify compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1644.  \n5. The “Harboring Condition” prohibits Byrne JAG recipients from making any \n“public disclosure … of any federal law enforcement information in a direct or indirect \nattempt to conceal, harbor, or shield from detection any fugitive from justice under 18 \nU.S.C. ch. 49, or any alien who has come to, entered, or remains in the United States in \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 183 Filed: 03/08/22 Page 2 of 3 PageID #:4042\nviolation of 8 U.S.C. ch. 12—without regard to whether such disclosure would constitute (or \ncould form a predicate for) a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1071 or 1072 or of 8 U.S.C. 1324(a).”  \n6. The “Additional Certification Requirement” requires the recipient jurisdiction to \nsubmit “Certifications and Assurances by the Chief Executive of the Applicant \nGovernment.” The condition incorporates a requirement that the City’s Chief Legal officer \ncertify that “neither the jurisdiction nor any entity, agency, or official of the jurisdiction has \nin effect … any law, rule, policy, or practice that would apply to the ‘program or activity’ to \nbe funded … that would or does—(a) impede the exercise by federal officers of authority \nunder 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a); or (b) impede the exercise by federal officers of authority relating \nto 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a) or (c), 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a), or 8 U.S.C. § 1366(1) or (3).”  \nThese conditions are referred to herein as the “Challenged Conditions.” \n \nI.  DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \nFor the reasons stated in the aforementioned Opinions of this Court and the Court \nof Appeals, the Court declares that the Attorney General, who is limited by longstanding \nprinciples of separation of powers to act only in accordance with congressional directives, \nexceeded the authority delegated by Congress in the Byrne JAG statute, 34 U.S.C. § 10151 et \nseq., and in 34 U.S.C. § 10102, in attaching the Conditions to the Byrne JAG grants. Nothing \nin this amended judgment order changes or affects the Court’s basis for awarding permanent \ninjunctive relief, or the scope of that relief, as set forth more fully above and in the Court’s \nopinions. \n \nII. PERMANENT INJUNCTION \n \nFor the reasons stated in the aforementioned Opinions of this Court and the Court \nof Appeals, it is hereby ORDERED that the Attorney General’s decision to attach the \nChallenged Conditions to the FY 2018 Byrne JAG grant is set aside and shall have no legal \neffect. The Attorney General is enjoined from denying or delaying issuance of any FY 2018 \nByrne JAG award insofar as that denial or delay is based on the Challenged Conditions. The \nAttorney General is further enjoined from denying or delaying issuance of the Byrne JAG \naward in FY 2019 or any other future program year insofar as that denial or delay is based on \nthe Challenged Conditions or materially identical conditions. Prohibited conduct includes: \nusing the Challenged Conditions, or materially identical conditions, in any Byrne JAG award \ndocument; delaying the processing or approval of a recipient’s requests to draw upon Byrne \nJAG funds based on the Challenged Conditions or materially identical conditions; and \nenforcing the Conditions or materially identical conditions against Byrne JAG recipients, \nregardless of whether those conditions appeared in Byrne JAG award documents. No \nrecipient’s acceptance of its Byrne JAG award may be construed as acceptance of the \nChallenged Conditions or materially identical conditions. For purposes of this injunction, \n“delay” means the failure or refusal to take an action that the Attorney General has taken for \nany other Byrne JAG recipient, if that failure or refusal is based in any way on (1) an \napplicant’s compliance or lack of compliance with the Challenged Conditions or materially \nidentical conditions or (2) litigation involving the Challenged Conditions or materially \nidentical conditions, including if such failure or refusal is based on the Attorney General’s \nseeking to preserve the ability to impose or enforce the Challenged Conditions or materially \nidentical conditions in the future. The Attorney General is further enjoined from requiring \nthat Byrne JAG grantees certify compliance, pursuant to 34 U.S.C. § 10153(a)(5)(D), with \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-06859 Document #: 183 Filed: 03/08/22 Page 3 of 3 PageID #:4043\nFederal laws that do not expressly apply to federal grants or grant recipients, such as 8 U.S.C. \n§§ 1373 and 1644. \nThis Order applies to the Attorney General’s imposition of the Challenged \nConditions and any materially identical conditions on the Byrne JAG grant program in FY \n2018 and all future grant years. Its effects run to the benefit of all Byrne JAG applicants and \nrecipients and are not limited to the City of Chicago and its sub-grantees. \nNothing in this injunction shall preclude the Attorney General from requiring \napplicants to provide a general certification that they will comply with applicable federal law, \nsee 34 U.S.C. § 10153(a)(5)(D), nor shall this injunction be construed as conferring \nindependent authority on a recipient of grant funds to use them in a manner that violates \nfederal law. Pursuant to the opinions of this Court and the Seventh Circuit, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1373 \nand 1644 shall not be considered applicable federal laws for purposes of such a general \ncertification. Nor shall such a general certification of compliance with applicable federal laws \nbe read to impose any new obligations that would not apply to grant recipients independent \nof the certification or of acceptance of Byrne JAG funding. Finally, such a certification shall \napply only to the use of award funds under the Byrne JAG grant formula program and shall \nnot reach the use of other funds within the funded program or activity or elsewhere. \n \nIII. FINAL JUDGMENT \n \nThere are two remaining Counts in this case: Count IV and Count VI.  \nIn light of the Court of Appeals’ holding that §§ 1373 and 1644 are not “applicable \nFederal laws” because they do not “apply by their terms to the award itself,” City of Chicago v. \nBarr, 961 at 899, the Court withdraws its prior declaration that §§ 1373 and 1644 are \nunconstitutional and dismisses Count IV as moot, without prejudice.  \nThe parties have agreed to dismiss Count VI without prejudice, and the Court \naccordingly dismisses Count VI without prejudice.  \nThere being no Counts remaining to be decided on the merits, the Court now enters \nfinal judgment in this case. Fed. R. Civ. P. 58. \n \nIV. ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS \n \nPlaintiff may still seek reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs in this matter. 28 U.S.C. \n§ 2412. Defendants are entitled to object to or oppose any attempt by Plaintiff to recover the \nsame. Any motion regarding attorneys’ fees and costs shall be made in accordance with the \nprocedures and schedule set forth in Local Rule 54.3. \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n \n \n              ____________________ \n              Harry D.
