    "summary": "<p>On November 1, 2018, a group of citizens from Honduras who had been traveling with their children to the United States to seek asylum filed this putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, on behalf of themselves and their children. The case was assigned to Judge Christopher R. Cooper. The plaintiffs, represented by Nexus Derechos Humanos Attorneys and private counsel, sued President Trump and all federal agencies associated with immigration under the Declaratory Judgment Act and the Administrative Procedure Act. The Plaintiffs sought class certification as “All persons (1) who are Mexican, Central American, or South American citizens (2) who are traveling to the United States or have attempted entry into the United States, whether at a designated port of entry or not, since October 31, 2018, and (3) who are seeking asylum or intending to seek asylum within the United States.” </p><p>The Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgement that the Defendants had violated the Plaintiffs’ Fifth Amendment Due Process rights and that the Defendants had violated the Administrative Procedure Act by disregarding federal law, federal directives, and the <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/flores_settlement_final_plus_extension_of_settlement011797.pdf\">Flores Settlement Agreement</a>, as well as injunctive relief to prevent enforcement of Trump’s immigration policy. While asserting without evidence that the migrant caravan contained “many criminals” and “many gang members” and labeling the caravan “an invasion of our Country,” President Trump implemented a policy that would permanently detain the thousands of caravaners planning to seek asylum in the United States. </p><p>Generally there are three possible designation for an aliens in the United States:</p><p><blockquote>1. “You are an arriving alien” upon entering the United States.</p><p>2. “You are an alien present in the United States who has not been admitted or paroled.”</p><p>3. “You have been admitted to the United States, but are removable for the reasons stated below.” </blockquote>Under the second and third designations, asylum seekers may be released on bond. While an immigrant designated as an \"arriving alien\" may be detained without a bond hearing; each of these designated persons may challenge his or her designation and seek to be re-categorized. The complaint alleged that under Trump’s policy, every immigrant arriving with the caravan would be designated as an \"arriving alien,\" subject mandatory detention, and unable to challenge his or her designation. These immigrants would be detained and housed in tents and tent cities, with no promises by the President that such facilities would comply with laws intended to protect immigrant alien children. All immigrants would be detained indefinitely until they were sent back to Central America. </p><p>The Plaintiffs argued that this “no release” policy was being used to deter asylum seekers, and that the use of detention as a deterrent to asylum seekers violated their Due Process rights. Furthermore, the Plaintiffs argued that denying immigrants any opportunity to challenge their inclusion in an immigrant category that prohibits them from seeking bond and release from detention violated their Due Process rights. Lastly, the Plaintiffs claimed that Trump and the federal agencies violated the Administrative Procedures Act by disregarding several laws and an agreement related to immigration, including the following:</p><p><blockquote>1. 8 U.S.C. § 1225, which requires that applicants applying for asylum must be referred for a “credible fear interview,” and will likely be granted asylum if an asylum officer determines that the asylum seeker has a “credible fear of persecution”</p><p>2. 8 U.S.C. § 1182, which gives discretion to the Attorney General to provide bond and release asylum seekers temporarily, and ICE Directive No. 11002.1, which requires that “[e]ach alien’s eligibility for parole should be considered and analyzed on its own merits and based on the facts of the individual aliens case.”</p><p>3. The Flores Settlement Agreement, which requires that minors must be held in facilities run by licensed programs that are “safe and sanitary and are consistent with [Defendants’] concern for the particular vulnerability of minors” and must “provide access to toilets and sinks, drinking water … adequate temperature control and ventilation, adequate supervision to protect minors from others, and contact with family.”</blockquote></p><p>On January 16, 2019, the parties jointly requested that the Court stay proceedings because the appropriations act that had been funding the Department of Justice expired and the required appropriations lapsed. Absent an appropriation, the Department attorneys, including the Assistant United States Attorney assigned to this case, were prohibited from working on substantive matters. The lapse occurred because of a government shutdown that lasted from December 22, 2018-January 25, 2019. The Court granted the motion on January 17, 2019 and gave the Defendants an extension to file their answer. </p><p>On February 7, 2019, the Plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntarily dismissal without prejudice. The case is closed. Although the notice does not give a reason for Plaintiffs' voluntary dismissal, it was likely because on January 25, 2019, the Department of Homeland Security issued a memorandum indicating that it would begin a process of implementing Section 235(b)(2)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. In this process, all non-Mexican nationals who arrive on land seeking to enter the United States from Mexico illegally or without proper documentation would be returned to Mexico for the duration of their Section 240 removal proceedings and could only return to the United States as necessary and appropriate to attend their immigration court proceedings. (see the resource titled \"Policy Guidance for Implementation of the Migrant Protection Protocols\")</p>",

Plaintiff consents to this motion.     \nAt the end of the day on December 21, 2018, the appropriations act that had been funding \nthe Department of Justice (Department) expired and the required appropriations lapsed.  The \nsame is true for multiple additional executive agencies.  Undersigned counsel does not know \nwhen funding will be restored by Congress.   \nAbsent an appropriation, Department attorneys, including the Assistant United States \nAttorney assigned to this matter, are prohibited from working on substantive matters, even on a \nvoluntary basis, except in very limited circumstances, including “emergencies involving the \nsafety of human life or the protection of property.”  31 U.S.C. § 1342.   \nAccordingly, Defendants, through undersigned counsel, request a stay of this civil action, \nas well as an extension of time commensurate with the calendar day duration of the lapse in \nappropriations, until Congress has restored appropriations to the Department. \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02534-CRC   Document 5   Filed 01/16/19   Page 2 of 2\nIf this motion is granted, the parties will notify the Court within fourteen days once \nappropriations for the Department have been restored and at that time will file a joint status \nreport proposing revised deadlines for any applicable matters, including a response to the \nComplaint.  Defendant’s answer was due Monday, January 14, 2019, when the Court was closed \ndue to inclement weather, so the deadline rolled over to January 15.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a)(3) \n(when clerk’s office is closed, deadlines are extended to next business day).  However, signatory \ncounsel himself (who is acting this week as Assistant U.S. Attorney Simon’s supervisor) had \nbeen furloughed until Friday, January 11, 2019, and due to the snow-related office closure on \nMonday, signatory counsel did not timely move for a stay and extension in this case amid the \nflurry of other matters that he was newly getting up to speed on and moving for stays in \nyesterday, January 15, 2019.  Signatory counsel regrets the oversight. \n  Therefore, although undersigned counsel greatly regrets any disruption caused to the \nCourt and the parties, Defendants hereby move for a stay of this case and for the extension of all \npending deadlines as set forth above.

R. Civ. P. In support thereof, Plaintiffs state that: \nINTRODUCTION \n1. \nTrump’s professed and enacted policy towards thousands of caravanners \nseeking asylum in the United States is shockingly unconstitutional. President \nTrump continues to abuse the law, including constitutional rights, to deter \nCentral Americans from exercising their lawful right to seek asylum in the \nUnited States, and the fact that innocent children are involved matters none to \nPresident Trump. For example, the Flores Agreement, a legally binding \nagreement designed to ensure the safety of immigrant alien children, as they \nenter this country for a variety of reasons, states that minors must be held in \nfacilities run by licensed programs that are “safe and sanitary and are consistent \nwith [Defendants’] concern for the particular vulnerability of minors.” (See Ex. 1, \n¶¶ 12.A, 14, Flores Agreement.) These facilities must “provide access to toilets \nand sinks, drinking water … adequate temperature control and ventilation, \nadequate supervision to protect minors from others, and contact with family.” \n(See Ex. 1) \n   \n4 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02534   Document 1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 5 of 32\n2. \nDespite the Flores Agreement’s lawfully binding mandates, President \nTrump’s policy position/initiative is to put these very children in tents, touting \nthat “when they find out this happens, [held in tents for years in the desert] \nyou’re going to have far fewer people come up.” Clearly President Trump cannot \nbelieve that his tents are facilities run by licensed programs as required by the \nFlores Agreements. And President Trump clearly is not talking about adequate \ntemperature controlled and ventilated tents with toilets and sinks and drinking \nwater, for Plaintiffs’ children, noting that Trump has condoned tent \nencampments as recent as 8 months ago. Id. Moreover, the issue of detaining \npeople in tents indefinitely brings about more unconstitutional conduct by our \nPresident. \n3. \nThe only way President Trump can mandate permanent detention without \neven a bond hearing is for those persons to be designated as “you are an arriving \nalien” upon entering the United States. See Garza-Garcia v. Moore, 539 F. Supp. \n2d 899, 906 (S.D. Tex. 2007). There are two other designation: (2) “You are an \nalien present in the United States who has not been admitted or paroled.”; or (3) \n“You have been admitted to the United States, but are removable for the reasons \nstated below.” See United States v. Castaneda-Barajas, No. CR-11-2069-RMP, \n5 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02534   Document 1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 6 of 32\n2011 WL 3626786, at *6 (E.D. Wash. Aug. 16, 2011). These two designations, \nhowever, permit asylum seekers to have a bond hearing. So, taking President \nTrump at his word—that his policy position/initiative is to detain people in tents \nuntil they have to go back to central America—President Trump must be \ndirecting officials to designate all Caravanners as “you are an arriving alien.” Id. \nThe problem with this designation however is that the law requires Defendants \nto permit all such designated persons to challenge their designations; consequently, \nTrump’s policy of keeping all persons detained until they must leave the country \nnecessarily violates due process rights. See Garza-Garcia, 539 F. Supp. 2d 899. \n4. \nOn top of the above, Trump has repeatedly professed that the caravan \npeople will not get into this county, and just as significant, Trump has taken \nmeaningful steps to ensure the world that this is his policy position/initiative, \nmeaningful steps such as deploying thousands of active military troops to the \nborder, waiting on caravan persons to arrive. The legal problem with Trump’s \nplan to stop caravan persons from entering this country is that Plaintiffs are \nseeking asylum, and Trump simply cannot stop them from legally doing so by \nusing military, or anyone.  \n   \n6 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02534   Document 1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 7 of 32\n5. \nThis Court should also note that President Trump has begun hysterically \nasserting without any evidence that “many criminals” and “many gang \nmembers” are in this “onslaught” of migration. In an effort to create fear and \nhysteria, Trump has gone so far as to call this “an invasion of our Country.” \nDespite these statements and actions, Trump has been unable to produce any \nevidence of criminals and gang members within the caravan, which has largely \nproceeded peacefully on its journey. Plaintiffs now request that this Court \ndeclare Trump’s policy positions/initiatives outlined in this Complaint \nunconstitutional, to end this case and controversy. \nJURISDICTION \n6. \nThis case arises under the Fifth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution, the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), and the Declaratory \nJudgment Act, inter alia. The court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1331. \n7. \nPersonal Jurisdiction is proper because Defendants transact business in \nthis District and thus are subject to personal jurisdiction in this Court. \n   \n7 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02534   Document 1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 8 of 32\nVENUE \n8. \nVenue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because at least one of the \nDefendants is subject to personal jurisdiction in this district with regards to this \naction. \nPARTIES \n9. \n  Plaintiff Maria Doris Pineda is a citizen of Honduras travelling by foot to \nthe United States to seek asylum.

That \n11 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02534   Document 1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 12 of 32\nagreement applies to all minors, including those who are taken into custody with \ntheir parents. Flores v. Lynch, 828 F.3d 898 (9th Cir. 2016). That agreement \nprovides that minors must be held in facilities run by licensed programs and that \nare “safe and sanitary and are consistent with [Defendants’] concern for the \nparticular vulnerability of minors.” Ex. 1, ¶¶ 12.A, 14. These facilities must \n“provide access to toilets and sinks, drinking water … adequate temperature \ncontrol and ventilation, adequate supervision to protect minors from others, and \ncontact with family.” Id. \n27. \nAny immigrant present in the U.S., irrespective of whether they \nimmigrated through a designated port of arrival, must be considered an \napplicant for admission into the country:  \nAn alien present in the United States who has not been admitted or \nwho arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port \nof arrival and including an alien who is brought to the United States \nafter  having  been  interdicted  in  international  or  United  States \nwaters) shall be deemed for purposes of this chapter an applicant for \nadmission. \n \n8 U.S.C. § 1225 (a)(1). \n28. \nImmigrants who indicate an intention to apply for asylum or indicates a \nfear of persecution must be referred for a “credible fear interview”:  \n12 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02534   Document 1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 13 of 32\nIf an immigration officer determines that an alien (other than an \nalien described in subparagraph (F)) who is arriving in the United \nStates or is described in clause (iii) is inadmissible under section \n1182(a)(6)(C) or 1182(a)(7) of this title and the alien indicates either \nan intention to apply for asylum under section 1158 of this title or a \nfear of persecution, the officer shall refer the alien for an interview \nby an asylum officer under subparagraph (B). \n \n8 U.S.C. § 1225 (b)(1)(A)(ii). \n29. \nFollowing a credible fear interview, if an asylum officer determines that an \nasylum seeker has a “credible fear of persecution,” then there is a significant \npossibility that the asylum seeker will be granted asylum: \nFor  purposes  of  this  subparagraph,  the  term  “credible  fear  of \npersecution” means that there is a significant possibility, taking into \naccount  the  credibility  of  the  statements  made  by  the  alien  in \nsupport of the alien’s claim and such other facts as are known to the \nofficer, that  the alien could  establish eligibility for asylum  under \nsection 1158 of this title.  \n \n8 U.S.C. § 1225 (b)(1)(B)(v). \nRELEVANT FACTS \na.  Facts Relevant to Tent City  \n30. \nThe Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador \nare undergoing a well-documented human rights crisis.1 As a result, thousands \n                                                            \n1 See, e.g., Diego Zavala, Fleeing for Our Lives: Central American Migrant Crisis, \nAMNESTY USA (Apr. 1, 2016, 12:12 PM), \n13 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02534   Document 1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 14 of 32\nof immigrants have begun a journey to the United States, many children and \nfamilies, in order to seek asylum. \n31. \nIn an interview with Laura Ingraham, Trump addressed the question of \nthose immigrants in this group seeking asylum. Specifically stating “we are \ngoing to hold them until such time as their trial takes place.”  \n32. \nIn that interview, Trump further stated that “we’re going to put up, we’re \ngoing to build tent cities, we’re going to put tents up all over the place” to house \ncaravanners. \n33. \nThere is no evidence that Trump’s policy position/initiative of placing \npeople in tents and tent cities is in compliance with the requirement that alien \nchildren such as those at issue in this case are being placed in facilities run by \nlicensed programs that provide adequate temperature control and ventilation, \naccess to drinking water, and supervision as required by the Flores Agreement. \nEx. 1. \n                                                                                                                                                                                                \nhttp://blog.amnestyusa.org/americas/fleeing-for-our-lives-central-american-\nmigrant-crisis/; Lily Folkerts, A Look at the Northern Triangle of Central \nAmerica in 2016: Sustained Violence and Displacement, LATIN AMERICA \nWORKING GROUP (Aug. 15, 2016) http://www.lawg.org/action-center/lawg-\nblog/69-general/1709-a-look-at-thenorthern-triangle-of-central-america-in-2016-\nsustained-violence-and-displacement. \n14 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02534   Document 1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 15 of 32\n34. \nTrump followed this up with “we’re going to take the people and they’re \ngoing to wait … when they find out this happens, you’re going to have far fewer \npeople come up.” This demonstrates that Trump is compounding violations of \nthe Flores Agreement by again attempting to use immigration detention as a \ndeterrent to migration, again flouting this Court’s ruling that this is unlawful. \nR.I.L-R v. Johnson, 80 F.Supp.3d 164, 188 (D.D.C. 2015) (citing Kansas v. Crane, \n534 U.S. 407, 412, 122 S.Ct. 867, 151 L.E.2d 856 (2002)). \nb.  Facts Related to Denial of Access to Asylum \n35. \nAt the same time that Trump is stating that he is going to detain all Central \nAmerican asylum seekers, he is saying it doesn’t matter, “those in the Caravan, \nturnaround, we are not letting people into the United States illegally. Go back to \nyour Country.”  \n36. \nAs stated by Defendant Nielsen (Secretary of DHS), “This caravan cannot \ncome to the United States. They will not be allowed in. They will not be allowed \nto stay.” “If you do not have a legal right to come to this country and you come \nas part of this caravan, you come in our country, you will be returned home.” Id. \n   \n15 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02534   Document 1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 16 of 32\n37. \nTo further enact Trump’s policy position/initiative of stopping \ncaravanners, including asylum seekers, from entering the United States, \nDefendants are sending more than 5,000 active duty troops to the Southern \nBorder to join Customs and Border Patrol and the National Guard already \npresent there. At least some number of these troops will be armed.  \n38. \nDefendant Nielsen has already admitted that these troops, and CBP \nagents, cannot enter Mexico to prevent the immigrants from entering the U.S. to \nseek asylum.  \n39. \n  Any immigrant, even one deemed inadmissible under §§ 1182(a)(6)(C) or \n1182(a)(7), who indicates an intention to apply for asylum or a fear of \npersecution, shall be referred to an asylum officer. 8 U.S.C. § 1225 (b)(1)(A)(ii). \nThus, the Defendants are attempting to deprive these migrants of their statutory \nright to seek asylum, and utilizing the U.S. military against desperate, unarmed, \nwomen and children to do it. Id. \n   \n16 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02534   Document 1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 17 of 32\n40. \n  As late as October 31, 2018, Mr. Trump has re-stated his policy position, \nstating he is now prepared to deploy as many as 15,000 troops, stating “[w]e’re \ngoing to be prepared. They are not coming into our country.”    \nc.  Relevant Facts to the Denial of Due Process \n41. \nThe Defendants have stated that their policy is to detain all migrants and \ncaravanners, including asylum seekers indefinitely, without any bond hearing.  \n42. \nAll immigrants in the custody of the Defendants are issued a notice to \nappear by the CBP officer initially reviewing their case. Garza-Garcia v. Moore, \n539 F.Supp.2d 899, 907 (S.D. Tex. 2007). In issuing this document, the officer \nselects from three categories, the first of which is “arriving alien” that subjects \nthe immigrant to mandatory detention. Id.  \n43. \nUpon information and belief, it is by use of this designation that the \nDefendants intend to enforce this mandatory detention. Specifically, upon \ninformation and belief, the Defendants have issued an informal directive to all \nCBP officers to select “arriving alien” for all of the Plaintiffs to subject them to \nmandatory detention. In Kim, the Supreme Court acknowledged that § 1226 \n17 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02534   Document 1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 18 of 32\nincludes the right to a hearing to determine if the immigrant is properly included \nin the mandatory detention category, which provides the individual review \nsufficient to satisfy constitutional requirements. Denmore v. Kim, 538 U.S. 510, \n514, 123 S.Ct. 708, 155 L.Ed.2d 724. This determination has been interpreted as \ngiving all detainees the right to review their inclusion in the class of immigrants \nsubject to mandatory detention. Moore, 539F.Supp.3d at 907-08.  \n44. \n  Further, asylum-seekers can be provided bond and released into the \nUnited States temporarily at the discretion of the Attorney General. 8 U.S.C. § \n1182(d)(5)(A). ICE has issued a directive setting forth the procedures that must \nbe utilized when evaluating parole requests. ICE Directive No. 11002.1: Parole of \nArriving Aliens Found to Have a Credible Fear of Persecution or Torture (Dec. 8, \n2009). This directive requires that ‘[e]ach alien’s eligibility for parole should be \nconsidered and analyzed on its own merits and based on the facts of the \nindividual aliens case.” Id. at ¶ 6.2. Further, when such immigrants who \nestablish they are not a flight risk or danger to the community, “DRO should … \nparole the alien on the basis that his or her continued detention is not in the \npublic interest.” Id. \n   \n18 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02534   Document 1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 19 of 32\n45. \n  Trump’s policy position/initiative of detaining caravanners, including \nAsylum seekers, until they are deported back to Central America prohibits those \nseeking Asylum from challenging their inclusion within the category of aliens \nthat must be mandatorily detained as described in the immediate two above \nparagraphs. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n46. \nPlaintiffs bring this suit as a class action on behalf of themselves and all \nothers similarly-situated (the “Class”) pursuant to Rules 23(a), 23(b)(2), and \n23(b)(3). \ni.  Class Definition \n47. \nPlaintiffs seek to represent the following class: \nAll persons (1) who are Mexican, Central American, or South American \ncitizens (2) who are travelling to the United States or have attempted \nentry into the United States, whether at a designated port of entry or \nnot, since October 31, 2018, and (3) who are seeking asylum or \nintending to seek asylum within the United States. \n \n48. \nPlaintiffs reserve the right to amend the class definition if further \ninvestigation and discovery demonstrates that the class definition should be \n19 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02534   Document 1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 20 of 32\nnarrowed, expanded, or otherwise modified. Excluded from the Class are \ngovernmental entities, Defendants, any entity in which Defendants have a \ncontrolling interest, and Defendants’ officers, directors, affiliates, legal \nrepresentatives, employees, co-conspirators, successors, subsidiaries, and \nassigns. Also excluded from the Class is any judge, justice, or judicial officer \npresiding over this matter and the members of their immediate families and \njudicial staff. \n49. \nAs a result of Defendants’ stated policies and actions taken to support \nthem, Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief under Rule 23(b)(2) under \npre-enforcement standing, to prevent the catastrophic and damaging effects of \nDefendants’ illegal and unconstitutional actions, policies, and practices. \nii.  Rule 23(a) requirements are met for the proposed Class \n50. \nThe requirements of Rule 23(a) are satisfied by this class action. \na. Numerosity \n51. \nThe information as to the size of the Class and the identity of Class \nMembers is in the control of the Defendants. On information and belief, the class \nencompasses at least 3,600 migrant individuals and families from Honduras and \n20 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02534   Document 1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 21 of 32\nGuatemala who are currently traveling through Mexico for the United States \nintending to seek asylum. The number of persons who are members of the Class \ndescribed above are so numerous that joinder of all members in one action is \nimpracticable. \nb. Commonality \n52. \nQuestions of law and fact that are common to the entire Class predominate \nover individual questions because the actions of Defendants complained of \nherein were generally applicable to the entire Class. The common answers that \nPlaintiffs seek are simple and will result in a common resolution for the Class. \nThese legal and factual questions include, but are not limited to: \n1.  Whether housing asylum seekers, including children and families, in \ntent cities for the duration of their asylum case is permissible under \nthe Flores Agreement; \n2.  Whether Defendants’ decision to deny asylum seekers the ability to \neven pursue asylum claims is constitutional; \n3.  Whether depriving asylum seekers of the opportunity to challenge \ntheir inclusion in the category of aliens subject to mandatory \ndetention is constitutional; \n4.  Whether using long term detention of asylum seekers, including \n21 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02534   Document 1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 22 of 32\nchildren and families, in order to deter migration is constitutional or \nlawful; and \n5.  Whether denying asylum seekers who pass their credible fear exam \nan individualized review of their parole decision is constitutional and \nlawful. \nc. Typicality \n53. \nPlaintiffs’ claims are typical of the members of the Class because Plaintiffs \nand all Class members are migrants crossing the southern U.S. border seeking \nasylum who are or will be denied the opportunity to seek asylum, who are or \nwill be subject to mandatory immigration detention as a deterrent to migration, \nwho are or will be denied opportunity to seek individualized review of their \nbond determination and inclusion in the class of aliens subject to mandatory \ndetention, and who are or will be housed in tent cities until their asylum claims \nare ruled on. Plaintiffs’ claims arise from the same practices and course of \nconduct that give rise to the claims of the Class members and are based on the \nsame legal theories. \nd. Adequacy \n54. \nPlaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class. \n22 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02534   Document 1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 23 of 32\nPlaintiffs have no interests that are contrary to or in conflict with those of the \nClass they seek to represent. \n55. \nPlaintiffs have retained competent counsel in both civil rights and class \naction litigation. Plaintiffs’ counsel has significant recent experience in \nsubstantially similar litigation against substantially similar defendants. \n56. \nPlaintiffs’ suit is financially supported by considerable philanthropic \nfunding. \niii.  Rule 23(b)(2) requirements are met for the proposed Class \n57. \nThe requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) are satisfied by this class action. \n58. \nRelief concerning Plaintiffs’ rights under the laws herein alleged and with \nrespect to the Class would be proper. Based on the anterior facts preceding this \nparagraph, Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally \napplicable to the Class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or \ncorresponding declaratory relief with regard to Class members as a whole and \ncertification of the Class under Rule 23(b)(2) proper. \n   \n23 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02534   Document 1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 24 of 32\niv.  Rule 23(b)(3) requirements are met for the proposed Class \n59. \nThe requirements of Rule 23(b)(3) are satisfied by this class action. \n60. \nQuestions of law or fact common to Class members predominate over any \nquestions affecting only individual members because, inter alia, (i) each member \nof the proposed Class was injured by the same Defendants under the same \nsubject policies, (ii) each member of the proposed Class was or will be denied \nopportunity to seek asylum, (iii) each member of the proposed Class was or will \nbe determined to be an ‘arriving alien’ subject to mandatory detention without a \nhearing to challenge that inclusion, (iv) each member of the proposed Class was \nor will be denied an individualized review of their bond application pending \ntheir asylum claims, (v) each member of the proposed Class was or will be \ndetained in tents in an effort to deter migration, and (vi) and each member of the \nproposed class will be detained in tent cities in violation of the Flores Agreement. \n61. \nA class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and \nefficiently adjudicating the controversy because the certification of the Class will \nachieve economies of time, effort, and expense, and promote uniformity of \ndecision as to persons similarly injured, without sacrificing procedural fairness \n24 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02534   Document 1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 25 of 32\nor bringing about other undesirable results, making certification of the Class \nunder Rule 23(b)(3) proper. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT I \nClaim for Declaratory Relief  \nunder the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201  \ndue to violating Due Process Clause \n5th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution  \n(Claim for Declaratory relief against all Defendants in their official capacities) \n \n62.  \nPlaintiffs hereby incorporate the preceding factual paragraphs 1 through \n61, and any other paragraph this Court deems relevant, as repeated and \nrealleged as though fully set forth herein to support this Count. \n63. \nThe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment applies to all “persons” \non United States soil and thus applies to Plaintiffs when seeking admission at the \nSouthern United States Border. \n64. \nPlaintiffs have a liberty interest under the Due Process Clause in being free \nfrom unwarranted government detention.  \n65. \nAlthough the U.S. Supreme Court acknowledges the “broad” latitude due \nthe Executive in the realm of immigration, Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67, 79–80, \n25 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02534   Document 1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 26 of 32\n96 S.Ct. 1883, 48 L.Ed.2d 478 (1976), it cannot “abdicat[e]” its “legal responsibility \nto review the lawfulness” of detention. Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 700, 121 S.Ct. 2491. \nThe government's power over immigration, while considerable, “is subject to \nimportant constitutional limitations.” Id. at 695, 121 S.Ct. 2491.  \n66. \nPrevious attempts by the federal government to use a policy of “no \nrelease” to deter asylum seekers have been found to violate due process. In R.I.L. \nv. Johnson, the federal government argued that “in determining whether an \nindividual claiming asylum should be released, ICE can consider the effect of \nrelease on others not present in the United States. Put another way, it \nmaintain[ed] that one particular individual may be civilly detained for the sake \nof sending a message of deterrence to other Central American individuals who \nmay be considering immigration.” R.I.L-R v. Johnson, 80 F. Supp. 3d 164, 188–89 \n(D.D.C. 2015). The Johnson court found that the government’s consideration of \nthe deterrence effect on whether to release asylum-seekers was “out of line with \nanalogous Supreme Court decisions,” noting that in discussing civil commitment \nmore broadly, the Court has declared such “general deterrence” justifications \nimpermissible. Id. (citing Kansas v. Crane, 534 U.S. 407, 412, 122 S.Ct. 867, 151 \nL.Ed.2d 856 (2002) (warning that civil detention may not “become a ‘mechanism \nfor retribution or general deterrence’—functions properly those of criminal law, \n26 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02534   Document 1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 27 of 32\nnot civil commitment”) (quoting Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346, 372–74, 117 \nS.Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed.2d 501 (1997) (Kennedy, J., concurring); see id. at 373, 117 \nS.Ct. 2072 (“[W]hile incapacitation is a goal common to both the criminal and \ncivil systems of confinement, retribution and general deterrence are reserved for \nthe criminal system alone.”)). The Johnson court further found that “a general-\ndeterrence rationale seems less applicable where—unlike pedophiles, see \nHendricks, 521 U.S. at 354–55, 362, 117 S.Ct. 2072, or other violent sexual \noffenders, see Crane, 534 U.S. at 409–11, 122 S.Ct. at 869—neither those being \ndetained nor those being deterred are certain wrongdoers, but rather individuals \nwho may have legitimate claims to asylum in this country.” R.I.L-R v. Johnson, \n80 F. Supp. 3d 164, 189 (D.D.C. 2015) (emphasis added). \n67. \nBased on the incorporated facts to support this count, the policy \nposition/initiative of detaining Plaintiffs in tents until they are deported without \npermitting Plaintiffs to challenge their categorization in a class of aliens subject to \nmandatory detention violates their substantive due process rights. Moreover, \nviolating their substantive due process rights for the purpose of deterring \nmigration is also unconstitutional.  \n   \n27 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02534   Document 1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 28 of 32\n68. \nBased on the incorporated facts to support this count, furthermore, the \npolicy position/initiative of entirely denying all class members access to the \nasylum process by stating you are not allowing any class member from even \nentering the United States, violates their due process rights.  \n69. \nBased on the incorporated facts to support this count, the policy \nposition/initiative of detaining children and families in tents in direct violation \nof the Flores Agreement, violates the substantive due process rights of the \nPlaintiffs and their minor children, for whom they are acting on behalf of.  \nCOUNT II \nClaim for Declaratory Relief  \nunder the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201  \nfor violation of Procedural Due Process Clause \n5th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution  \n(Claim for Declaratory relief against all Defendants in their official capacities) \n \n70. \nPlaintiffs hereby incorporate the preceding factual paragraphs 1 through \n34, and any other paragraph this Court deems relevant, as repeated and \nrealleged as though fully set forth herein to support this Count. \n   \n28 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02534   Document 1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 29 of 32\n71. \nThe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment applies to all “persons” \non United States soil and thus applies to Plaintiffs when seeking admission at the \nSouthern United States Border. \n72. \nPlaintiffs have a liberty interest under the Due Process Clause in remaining \nfree from unwarranted government detention.  \n73. \nBased on the incorporated facts to support this count, the policy \nposition/initiative that mandates the detention of Plaintiffs in tents until they \nmust leave the country violates procedural due process because the policy \nposition/initiative denies Plaintiffs their lawful right to challenge Plaintiffs’ \ninclusion in a category that prohibits them from seeking bond and release from \ndetention. This denial deprives the Plaintiffs of their procedural protections of \nthe individualized determination of their bond eligibility. \n   \n29 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02534   Document 1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 30 of 32\nCOUNT III \nClaim for Declaratory Relief  \nfor violation of the Administrative Procedures Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § \n706(2)(C), by disregarding the requirements of, inter alia,  \n8 U.S.C. § 1225; 8 U.S.C. § 1182; 8 CFR § 1201 \nICE Directive No. 11002.1; and the Flores Agreement \n(Claim for Declaratory relief against Defendants Sessions, Nielsen, and McAleenan in \ntheir official capacities) \n \n74. \nPlaintiffs hereby incorporate the preceding factual paragraphs 1 through \n34, and any other paragraph this Court deems relevant, as repeated and \nrealleged as though fully set forth herein to support this Count. \n75. \nBased on all the incorporated facts that support this count, the final agency \naction mandating the permanent detention of all asylum seekers in tents (or \nanywhere) until they are deported is an arbitrary and capricious abuse of the \nimplementation of specific statutes that entitle Plaintiffs to challenge their \ncategorization within a class of aliens that are not permitted bond. Further, this \npolicy position/initiative is an arbitrary and capricious abuse of the \nimplementation of the specific statutes permitting aliens to seek asylum. Further, \nthe Defendants’ policy position/initiative of detaining minor alien children in \ntents, a schematic that clearly does not meet the licensed program and other \nrequirements of the Flores Agreement; and the tent city policy is unlawful under \nthe APA. \n30 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02534   Document 1   Filed 11/01/18   Page 31 of 32\nCOUNT IX \nAttorney’s Fees \n \nBased on the foregoing, Plaintiffs are entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees \nunder all applicable laws, including the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. § \n2412.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nPlaintiffs request that the Court enter a judgment against Defendants and \naward the following relief: \nA.  Enter judgment and declaratory judgment in favor of Plaintiffs;  \nB.  Declare all acts argued as unconstitutional within this Complaint as \nunconstitutional; \nC.  Declare all acts argued as violative of the APA as violative of the \nAPA; \nD.  Award costs and attorneys’ fees to Plaintiffs; and \nE.  Order all other relief that is just and proper. \nRespectfully submitted this 1st day of November 2018.  \n/s/John M. Shoreman \nJohn M.
