    "summary": "<p>This case is a response to efforts by the Trump administration to strip law enforcement funding from โsanctuaryโ cities and states. </p><p>The State of Oregon and the City of Portland filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon on November 9, 2018. Represented by the Oregon Attorney General and the Portland City Attorneyโs Office, they sued President Trump and the U.S. Attorney General under the United States Constitution and the Declaratory Judgment Act. They claimed that immigration-related conditions on federal funding for law enforcement violated the Spending Clause and the Tenth Amendment. They sought declaratory relief, a writ of mandamus, and an injunction, prohibiting the federal government from imposing immigration-related conditions on the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (Byrne JAG) program, which provides support for local law enforcement. The case was assigned to Judge Michael McShane.</p><p>The plaintiffs stated that they were unlawfully deprived of more than $2 million of federal funding for fiscal year 2017 due to their non-acquiescence in the immigration conditions imposed on the Byrne JAG program. They expected to be similarly deprived in FY 2018. They alleged that the federal government had imposed three unlawful conditions on FY 2017 Byrne JAG funds, requiring grant recipients to: <ol><li>comply with 8 U.S.C. ยง 1373 (which requires local governments to allow their employees to share their citizenship and immigration status information with federal authorities); <li>give the federal government 48 hoursโ notice prior to releasing arrestees; and <li>permit federal immigration officials to access any correctional or detention facility to meet with suspected undocumented immigrants.</ol>The plaintiffs further alleged that the Trump administration had imposed similar but more intrusive conditions on FY 2018 funding: local governments were additionally required to comply with 8 U.S.C. ยง 1644; were required to answer questions regarding their compliance with the two statutes; and were required to certify that they would not violate 8 U.S.C. ยง 1324(a), which forbids the harboring or concealment of undocumented immigrants.</p><p>The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on Nov. 21, 2018, adding information related to another sanctuary city case that Oregon was involved in. As a result of a preliminary injunction in that case (<a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16691\"><i>City of Evanston et al. v. Sessions</i></a>), Oregon was provided with an award notice for FY 2017โs Byrne JAG program. However, the plaintiffs pointed out in the amended complaint that the federal government had yet to process that award or disburse any funds, and the plaintiffs still believed that they would be deprived of FY 2018 funds.</p><p>On March 5, 2019, the Trump administration filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and for lack of jurisdiction; the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment on April 8, 2019. On August 7, the court denied the federal governmentโs motion to dismiss, and partly granted the plaintiffsโ motion for summary judgment. It held that Sections 1373 and 1644 violated the Tenth Amendment, such that the federal government could not withhold funds based on those statutes. The plaintiffs were โtherefore entitled to a writ of mandamus compelling distribution of their FY 2017 and FY 2018 funds.โ 406 F. Supp. 3d 940. The writ of mandamus and accompanying injunction were issued on August 29, 2019. The court also awarded costs to the plaintiffs, in the amount of $420, on October 24, 2019.</p><p>On October 4, 2019, the federal government appealed the case (Ninth Circuit docket number 19-35843). The Ninth Circuit ordered mediation and stayed the appeal in October 2019. As of December 2020, the appeal is still stayed and mediation continues. </p>",

In the First Amended Complaint (ECF No. 3), Plaintiffs challenge five \nrequirements for fiscal year (โFYโ) 2017 and seven requirements for FY 2018 Edward Byrne \nMemorial Justice Assistance Grants (โByrne JAGโ), herein referred to as the โImmigration \nPage 1 -  JUDGMENT AND ORDER DENYING DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO DISMISS; \nGRANTING PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN PART, AND \nISSUING INJUNCTIONS AND MANDAMUS \n   \n   \n \n\nCase 6:18-cv-01959-MC    Document 38    Filed 08/29/19    Page 2 of 5\n \nEnforcement Requirements.โ The Immigration Enforcement Requirements at issue are found in \nparagraphs 52, 53, 54, 55, and 56 of Exhibit C to the Request for Judicial Notice filed by \nDefendants as ECF No. 15 at pages 62-66, in paragraphs 52, 53, 54, 55, and 56 of Exhibit D to \nECF No. 15 at pages 91-95, and in paragraphs 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, and 47 of Exhibit E of ECF \nNo. 15 at pages 116-122. \n  2.  On March 5, 2019, Defendantsโ filed Defendantsโ Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. \n14) and Defendantsโ Request for Judicial Notice (ECF No. 15) (collectively, โDefendantsโ \nMotionโ). \n  3.  On April 8, 2019, Plaintiffs filed Plaintiffsโ Combined Motion for Summary \nJudgment and Response to Defendantsโ Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 21) and supporting \ndeclarations and exhibits (ECF Nos. 22-25) (collectively, โPlaintiffsโ Motionโ). \n  4.  On July 26, 2019, the Court held a hearing on Defendantsโ Motion and Plaintiffsโ \nMotion and heard the arguments by counsel. \n  5.  On August 8, 2019, the Court issued its Opinion and Order (ECF No. 36) denying \nDefendantsโ Motion and granting Plaintiffsโ Motion in part. The Court concluded that Plaintiffs \nhave standing to pursue their claims and that Plaintiffsโ claims are ripe for judicial review. The \nCourt further concluded that Defendants lack the delegated authority to impose the Immigration \nEnforcement Requirements and that by doing so, Defendants infringed upon the authority \nreserved to Congress under the Spending Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Finally, the Court \nfound that 8 U.S.C. ยงยง 1373 and 1644 violate the Tenth Amendment. \n  Based on its findings and conclusions, and pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n58, the Court hereby ENTERS judgment in favor of Plaintiffs and against Defendants, and grants \nthe following relief as set forth below: \n \n \nPage 2 -  JUDGMENT AND ORDER DENYING DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO DISMISS; \nGRANTING PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN PART, AND \nISSUING INJUNCTIONS AND MANDAMUS \n   \n   \n \n\nCase 6:18-cv-01959-MC    Document 38    Filed 08/29/19    Page 3 of 5\n \nDECLARATION \n  The Court concludes that declaratory relief under 28 U.S.C. ยง 2201 is appropriate in this \ncase. It is hereby DECLARED that: \n  1.  The Immigration Enforcement Requirements are unconstitutional and unlawful \nbecause they exceed the congressional authority conferred on the Executive Branch and are ultra \nvires on their face. \n  2.  8 U.S.C. ยงยง 1373 and 1644 are unconstitutional on their face under the Tenth \nAmendment of the United States Constitution. \nPERMANENT INJUNCTION \n  The Court also concludes that each of the necessary elements for issuing a permanent \ninjunction is met. In particular, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have succeeded on the merits \nof their claims and that absent an injunction, Plaintiffs would suffer irreparable injury; the \nbalance of equities favor Plaintiffs; and the requested relief is in the public interest.  \n  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65, it is now ORDERED that Defendants \nARE HEREBY RESTRAINED AND ENJOINED from directly or indirectly committing or \nperforming the following acts: \n  1.  Using the Immigration Enforcement Requirements as conditions for Byrne JAG \nfunding for any Oregon state entity, the City of Portland, or any Oregon political subdivision. \n  2.  Withholding, terminating, or clawing back Byrne JAG funding from, or \ndisbarring or making ineligible for Byrne JAG, any Oregon state entity, the City of Portland, or \nany Oregon political subdivision on the basis of the Immigration Enforcement Requirements. \n  3.  Withholding, terminating, or clawing back Byrne JAG funding from, or \ndisbarring or making ineligible for Byrne JAG, any Oregon state entity, the City of Portland, or \nany Oregon political subdivision on account of any grant condition challenged in this lawsuit and \nbased on ORS 181A.820, ORS 180.805, or Portland Police Bureau Directive 810.10. \nPage 3 -  JUDGMENT AND ORDER DENYING DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO DISMISS; \nGRANTING PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN PART, AND \nISSUING INJUNCTIONS AND MANDAMUS \n   \n   \n \n\nCase 6:18-cv-01959-MC    Document 38    Filed 08/29/19    Page 4 of 5\n \n  4.

Nothing in this Order shall impair, affect, \nor relieve the jurisdictions or any other Byrne JAG award recipient within the District of Oregon \nfrom the obligation to certify and comply with any and all other grant conditions apart from the \nImmigration Enforcement Requirements, nor shall it impair Defendantsโ ability to enforce the \nconditions in the awards other than the Immigration Enforcement Requirements.  \n  Acceptance of the FY 2017 and/or FY 2018 awards by the Oregon Criminal Justice \nCommission, the City of Portland, and/or any Oregon political subdivision shall not be construed \nas acceptance of the enjoined conditions.  \n  After the jurisdiction or entity accepts the FY 2017 and/or FY 2018 awards, Defendants \nare further ORDERED to process and approve the jurisdictionโs requests for drawdowns of the \njurisdictionโs FY 2017 and/or FY 2018 Byrne JAG funds as it would in the ordinary course, and \nPage 4 -  JUDGMENT AND ORDER DENYING DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO DISMISS; \nGRANTING PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN PART, AND \nISSUING INJUNCTIONS AND MANDAMUS \n   \n   \n \n\nCase 6:18-cv-01959-MC    Document 38    Filed 08/29/19    Page 5 of 5\n \nwithout regard to the enjoined conditions, compliance with 8 U.S.C. ยงยง 1373 and 1644, or \nwhether the jurisdiction spent its own money on the program or activity funded.  \nCOSTS \n  Plaintiffs are awarded their reasonable costs and expenses pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1920 \nand 2412.

Defendants  have  implemented  this \nnational  requirement  by  imposing  sweeping  new  conditions  on  an  established  and \ncongressionally  appropriated  federal  grant  program  โ  the  Edward  Byrne  Memorial  Justice \nAssistance  Grant  (โByrne  JAGโ)  โ that  has  for  years  provided  crucial  support  for  law \nenforcement  in  Oregon.  Essentially,  Defendants  have  โused  the  sword  of federal  funding  to \nconscript  state  and  local  authorities  to  aid  in  federal  civil  immigration  enforcement.โ  City  of \nChicago  v.  Sessions,  888  F.3d  272,  277  (7th  Cir.  2018).  In  support  of this  effort,  Defendants  rely \non  two  immigration  statutes  โ  8  U.S.C.  ยงยง  1373  and  1644  โ  that  violate  the  Tenth  Amendment \nto  the  U.S.  Constitution. \n3. \nIn  response,  the  State  of Oregon  and  the  City  now  seek  to  protect  their jurisdictions  and \ntheir  residents  from  Defendantsโ  unconstitutional  attempt  to  compel  the  State  of Oregon  and  the \nCity  to  enforce  federal  immigration  policies  in  a  manner  contrary  to  their  best  interests. \n4. \nIn  their  effort  to  impermissibly  commandeer  the  resources  of the  State  of Oregon  and  the \nCity,  Defendants  have  withheld  Byrne  JAG  funds  because  the  State  of Oregon  and  the  City  have \nPage2-  FIRST  AMENDED  COMPLAINT  FOR  DECLARATORY,  INJUNCTIVE,  AND \nMANDAMUS  RELIEF \nJustice #9293999 v3 \nOregon Department of Justice \n1162 Court Street NE \nSalem, OR 97301 \n(503) 947-4700 / Fax: (503) 947-4791\n  \nCoO amsoeny   F6:L ATTR -oOOv, -G-  \nALAS  Se  he wt  Le  * \nnot  acquiesced  to  Defendantsโ  immigration  enforcement  demands.  As  a  result,  the  State  of \nOregon  has  been  unlawfully  deprived  of  $2,034,945  in  federal  funds  for  fiscal  year  (โFYโ)  2017 \nand  expects  to  be  deprived  of $2,092,704  for  FY  2018. \n5. \nSimilarly,  the  City  has  been  deprived  of  $391,515  for  FY  2018.  In  addition,  while \nDefendants  recently  provided  the  City  with  an  award  notice  in  the  amount  of  $385,515  for  FY \n2017  pursuant  to  a  preliminary  injunction  won  by  the  United  States  Conference  of Mayors,  of \nwhich  the  City  is  a  member,  see  City  of Evanston  et  al.  v.  Sessions,  No.  18  c  4853,  Dkt.  No.  23 \n(N.D.  Ill.  Aug.  9,  2018)  (stay  lifted  in  United States  Conference  of Mayors  v.  Sessions,  No.  18- \n2734,  Dkt.  No.  13  (7th  Cir.  Aug.  29,  2018)),  Defendants  still  have  not  processed  that  award  or \ndisbursed  any  of those  funds.  Moreover,  Defendants  have  stated  that,  while  they  will  not  enforce \ntheir  immigration  enforcement  demands  against  the  Cityโs  FY  2017  award  while  Defendantsโ \naction  against  the  United  States  Conference  of Mayors  in  the  Seventh  Circuit  is  pending,  they \nmay  do  so  or  seek  reimbursement  from  the  City  if Defendants  eventually  prevail  that  action. \n6. \nIn  effect,  Defendants  seek  to  use  the  Byrne  JAG  program  as  a  tool  to  further  their \nimmigration  enforcement  agenda.  Defendants  appear  to  have  targeted  the  State  of Oregon  and \nthe  City  for  denial  of Byrne  JAG  funds  based  on  their  interpretation  of two  Oregon  laws  โ \nORS  181A.820  and  ORS  180.805.  Defendants  have  implied  in  correspondence  with  Oregon \nofficials  that  these  statutes  violate  federal  law  by  preventing  cooperation  between  law \nenforcement  and  immigration  authorities.  But  in  the  statutes  requiring  Defendants  to  distribute \nByrne  JAG  funds  to  states  and  localities,  Congress  did  not  impose  any  condition  requiring  states \nto  have  laws  that  aid  Defendantsโ  implementation  of federal  immigration  policy.  For  that  reason, \nthe  Seventh  Circuit  recently  concluded  that  Defendantsโ  actions  are  unlawful.  Chicago  v. \nSessions,  888  F.3d  at  287.

Because  Defendants  have  not  paid  the  Byrne  JAG  funds  for \nFY  2017,  the  State  of  Oregon  expects  that  Defendants  will  also  withhold  the  Byrne  JAG  funds \nfor  FY  2018.

For  FY \n2017,  the  City  was  entitled  to  an  allocation  of  $385,515.  This  allocation  was  unlawfully  withheld \nfor  over  a  year,  and  an  award  notice  was  only  recently  provided  pursuant  to  a  preliminary \ninjunction.  City  of Evanston  et  al.  v.

The  City  has  now  applied  for  Byrne \nJAG  funds  for  FY  2018  and  expects  to  be  entitled  to  $391,684  for  FY  2018.  In  the  FY  2018 \nByrne  JAG  solicitation,  the  Department  of Justice  specifically  noted  that  it  would  issue  awards \nby  September  30,  2018.  In  early  October  2018,  USDOJ  began  releasing  FY  2018  Byrne  JAG \naward  letters.  To  date,  USDOJ  has  issued  752  FY  2018  local  awards,  totaling  almost  $59 \nmillion.  Despite  the  release  of a  substantial  portion  of FY  2018  funding,  USDOJ  has  not  yet \nissued  the  Cityโs  award.  Absent  injunctive  relief,  the  City  will  face  significant  funding  shortfalls \nfor  critical  law  enforcement  initiatives  funded  by  Byrne  JAG. \n21. \nDefendantsโ  actions  threaten  the  physical  and  economic  health  and  well-being  of Oregon \nresidents,  including  those  assisted  by  Oregon  law  enforcement  entities  entitled  to  receive  Byrne \nJAG  funds.  Oregon  has  a  legitimate  interest  in  preventing  present  and  future  harm  to  its \nresidents.  Governor  Brown  and  Attorney  General  Rosenblum  therefore  have  authority  to \ncommence  this  legal  action  under  the  doctrine  of parens patriae. \n22. \nThe  Oregon  Attorney  General,  as  the  State  of Oregonโs  chief law  officer,  is  uniquely \nsituated  to  seek  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief that  protects  the  rights  of law  enforcement \nentities  and  state  and  local  government  entities  across  Oregon.

Defendants  have \nspecifically  and  impermissibly  required  the  City  Attorney  to  certify  the  Cityโs  compliance  with \nunconstitutional  federal  requirements. \n24. \nIn  addition  to  requiring  the  Oregon  Attorney  General  and  the  City  Attorney  to  certify  that \nthe  State  and  the  City,  respectively,  comply  with  unconstitutional  statutes,  Defendants  are \npurporting  to  require  certification  that  subgrantees  comply  with  those  unconstitutional \nprovisions.  The  State  of Oregon  has  numerous  subgrantees,  many  of them  counties  and  cities  that \nexercise  a  significant  degree  of political  independence  pursuant  to  Oregonโs  constitution  and \nlaws.  The  City,  meanwhile,  also  has  county  and  city  subgrantees  that  are  politically  independent \nof the  City.  Ascertaining  subgrantee  compliance  with  unconstitutional  statues  is  an  unjustified \nburden.  And  it  is  exacerbated  by  the  inexplicably  broad  interpretation  of the  relevant  statutes \nthat  Defendants  have  endorsed.  Defendants  have  stated  in  other  legal  proceedings  that \nโinformation  regarding  citizenship  or  immigration  statusโ  under  8  U.S.C.  ยง  1373  encompasses \nany  โinformation  critical  in  applying  the  โimmigration  laws,โโ  including  information  helpful  to \nDefendants  in  effectuating  the  โremoval  of aliens.โ \n25. \nEarlier  this  year,  United  States  Secretary  for  Homeland  Security  Kirstjen  Nielsen  stated \nthat,  at  her  departmentโs  request,  the  USDOJ  was  exploring  commencing  criminal  prosecutions \nunder  8  U.S.C.  ยง  1324  against  state  and  local  elected  officials  of jurisdictions  that  do  not  actively \nassist  federal  immigration  enforcement.

The  federal  statutes  at  issue,  8  U.S.C.  ยงยง  1373  and  1644,  require  the  State  of Oregon  and \nthe  City  to  exercise  their  police  power  in  a  manner  contrary  to  the  best  interests  of Oregon  and \nCity  residents. \nFACTUAL  AND  LEGAL  BACKGROUND \n27. \nThis  case  presents  a  conflict  between  federal  immigration  enforcement  policies  and  the \nState  of Oregonโs  and  the  Cityโs  exercise  of their broad  police  powers  under  the  Tenth \nAmendment. \n28. \nโImmigration  policy  shapes  the  destiny  of the  Nation.โ  Arizona  v.  United States, \n567  U.S.  387,  415  (2012).

NCAA,  138  S.  Ct.  1461,  1475  (2018). \n31. \nA  core  aspect  of  state  sovereignty  is  the  notion  that  Congress  cannot  issue  legislative \ndirectives  to  states  in  their  role  as  states.  โConspicuously  absent  from  the  list  of powers  given  to \nCongress  is  the  power  to  issue  direct  orders  to  the  governments  of the  States.โ  Murphy  v.

It  states: \nNotwithstanding  any  other provision  of Federal,  State,  or  local  law,  no  State  or  local \ngovernment  entity  may  be  prohibited,  or  in  any  way  restricted,  from  sending  to  or \nreceiving  from  the  Immigration  and  Naturalization  Service  information  regarding  the \nimmigration  status,  lawful  or  unlawful,  of an  alien  in  the  United  States. \n8  U.S.C.  ยง  1644. \n35. \nBoth  of these  statutes  specifically  regulate  conduct  by  states  (and  political  subdivisions  of \nstates)  in  their  sovereign  capacities.

In  1987,  Oregon  enacted \nORS  181A.820,  which  bars  Oregon  law  enforcement  agencies  from  expending  money  for  the \npurpose  of detecting  or  apprehending  persons  whose  only  violation  of law  is  that  they  are \npersons  of foreign  citizenship  present  in  the  United  States  in  violation  of federal  immigration \nlaws. \n37. \nIn  2017,  the  Oregon  Legislature  enacted  ORS  180.805,  which  the  legislature  drafted \nspecifically  to  comply  with  Section  1373.  The  statute,  in  pertinent  part,  provides  as  follows: \n(1)  Except  as  required  by  state  or  federal  law,  a  public  body  may  not  disclose,  for \nthe  purpose  of enforcement  of federal  immigration  laws,  the  following \ninformation  concerning  any  person,  whether  current  or  otherwise: \n(a)  The  personโs  address; \n(b)  The  personโs  workplace  or  hours  of work; \n(c)  The  personโs  school  or  school  hours; \n(d)  The  personโs  contact  information,  including  telephone  number, \nelectronic  mail  address  or  social  media  account  information; \n(e)  The  identity  of known  associates  or  relatives  of the  person; \n(f)  The  date,  time  or  location  of the  personโs  hearings,  proceedings  or \nappointments  with  the  public  body  that  are  not  matters  of public  record;  or \n(ยข)  Information  described in  paragraphs  (a)  through  (f)  of this  subsection \nwith  respect  to  known  relatives  or  associates  of the  person. \nok ok ok \n(3)(a)  If a  public  body  collects  information  concerning  a  personโs  citizenship  or \nimmigration  status,  the  public  body  may  decline  to  disclose  the  information  unless \ndisclosure is  required  by: \n(A)  State  or  federal  law; \n(B)  A  court  order;  or \n(C)  A  warrant  authorized  by  a  court. \nok oko k \nPage  12  -  FIRST  AMENDED  COMPLAINT  FOR  DECLARATORY,  INJUNCTIVE,  AND \nMANDAMUS  RELIEF \nJustice #9293999 v3 \nOregon Department of Justice \n1162 Court Street NE \nSalem, OR 97301 \n(503) 947-4700 / Fax: (503) 947-4791\n(5)  Nothing  in  this  section  prohibits  any  public  body  from  complying  with  a \nfederal  immigration  authority  as  required  by  federal  law. \nok ok ok \n38. \nOregonโs  state  and  local  officials  are  responsible  for  policing,  protecting,  and  serving  all \nresidents,  including  more  than  389,000  foreign-born  individuals,  who  live  in  the  State.  To \nachieve  those  goals,  the  State  of Oregon  enacted  the  foregoing  statutes  as  an  exercise  of the \nStateโs  police  power  to  regulate  the  health,  welfare,  and  public  safety  of its  residents.  Those \nlaws  are  instrumental  to  building  the  trust  necessary  to  ensuring  that  victims  report  crimes  to  law \nenforcement  so  that  perpetrators  are  apprehended  before  harming  others.  Building  that  trust  has \nhistorically  been  difficult  in  immigrant  communities,  where  residents  often  fearโregardless  of \nimmigration  statusโthat  engaging  with  law  enforcement  could  result  in  deportation.  When  local \nand  state  officials  engage  in  immigration  enforcement,  as  Defendants  contemplate,  vulnerable \nvictims  and  witnesses  are  less  likely  to  come  forward  to  report  crimes,  creating  a  danger  to  all \nOregon  residents. \n39, \nMoreover,  those  laws  ensure  that  state  and  local  resources  are  devoted  to  fulfilling  state \nand  local  policing  responsibilities.  State  and  local  law  enforcement  agencies  are  not  required  to \nexpend  their  limited  resources  on  enforcing  immigration  policies  that  are  a  federal  responsibility. \n40. \nOregon  is  not  alone  in  adopting  this  approach.  Across  the  country,  many  other  state  and \nlocal jurisdictions  have  enacted  laws  to  limit  state  and  local  law  enforcement  of federal \nimmigration  policy.  See  e.g.  City  of Chicago  v.  Sessions,  888  F.3d  at  281;  City  of Philadelphia  v. \nSessions,  280  F.  Supp.  3d  579,  591,  602  (E.D.  Pa.  2017).  Significantly,  Oregon  law  does  not \ninterfere  with  Defendantsโ  lawful  pursuit  of its  civil  immigration  activities  in  Oregon.  See  City  of \nChicago  v.  Sessions,  888  F.3d  at  281  (โThe  federal  government  can  and  does  freely  operate  in \nโsanctuaryโ  localities.โโ). \nPage  13  -  FIRST  AMENDED  COMPLAINT  FOR  DECLARATORY,  INJUNCTIVE,  AND \nMANDAMUS  RELIEF \nJustice #9293999 v3 \nOregon Department of Justice \n1162 Court Street NE \nSalem, OR 97301 \n(503) 947-4700 / Fax: (503) 947-4791\nThe  City  of Portland  and  its  Police  Bureau  Policies \nAl. \nIn  accordance  with  ORS  181A.820,  the  Portland  Police  Bureau  does  not  enforce  federal \nimmigration  laws.

Although  the  Bureau \nsupports  the  DHS  mission  as  it  relates  to  confronting  these  security  and  human  rights  threats,  the \nBureau  is  steadfast  in  its  commitment  to  contributing  to  the  Cityโs  efforts  to  create  a  welcoming \nenvironment  that  encourages  diversity  and  inclusivity.โ \n44. \nPortland  Police  Bureau  Policy  810.10  further  states:  โTo  the  extent  that  the  mission  of \nDHS,  as  communicated  to  the  Bureau,  is  enforcement  of immigration  laws,  the  Bureau  will \nfollow  the  direction  of the  state  statutory  law  and  City  ordinances  by  not  enforcing  or  assisting  in \nthe  enforcement  of federal  immigration  laws,  as  that  is  a  federal  function.

See  34  U.S.C.  ยงยง  10151-10158. \n48. \nThe  Byrne  JAG  program  is  a  mandatory  formula  grant:  it  requires  awarding  grant  funds \nbased  on  a  statutorily-defined  formula,  and  the  federal  government  must  disburse  funds  in  the \namount  dictated  by  that  formula  if an  applicant  meets  the  requirements  set  forth  in  the \nauthorizing  statutes.  34  U.S.C.  ยง  10156. \nPage  15  -  FIRST  AMENDED  COMPLAINT  FOR  DECLARATORY,  INJUNCTIVE,  AND \nMANDAMUS  RELIEF \nJustice #9293999 v3 \nOregon Department of Justice \n1162 Court Street NE \nSalem, OR 97301 \n(503) 947-4700 / Fax: (503) 947-4791\n49. \nByrne  JAG  awards  are  provided  to  each  state,  as  well  as  to  certain  local jurisdictions \nwithin  each  state.  Under  the  governing  statute,  defendants  โโshallโ  allocate  all  congressionally- \nappropriated  funds  to  each  state  and  qualifying  unit  of local  government  according  to  a \nprescribed  methodology.  34  U.S.C.  ยง  10156(a),  (b),  (c),  (d). \n50. \nThe  Byrne  JAG  program  supports  state  and  local  law  enforcement  efforts  by  providing  an \nadditional  source  of funding  for  personnel,  equipment,  training,  and  other  criminal justice \nneeds.  34  U.S.C  ยง  10152.  The  purposes  of the  grant  include:  supporting  law  enforcement \nprograms,  reducing  recidivism,  conducting  crime  prevention  and  education  programs  for  at-risk \nyouth,  and  supporting  programs  for  crime  victims  and  witnesses. \n51. \nThe  Byrne  JAG  program  merges  two  earlier programs:  the  Edward  Byrne  Memorial  State \nand  Local  Law  Enforcement  Assistance  Program  grants;  and  Local  Law  Enforcement  Block \nGrants.  See  Pub.  L.  No.  109-162,  119  Stat.  2960,  3094  (2006).  In  merging  those  two  programs, \nCongress  identified  eight  types  of programs  that  the  grant  was  intended  to  fund:  (1)  law \nenforcement  programs;  (2)  prosecution  and  court  programs;  (3)  prevention  and  education \nprograms;  (4)  corrections  and  community  corrections  programs;  (5)  drug  treatment  and \nenforcement  programs;  (6)  planning,  evaluation,  and  technology  improvement  programs;  (7) \ncrime  victim  and  witness  programs;  and  (8)  mental  health  programs  and  related  law  enforcement \nand  corrections  programs.  34  U.S.C.  ยง  10152(a)(1)(A)-(H). \n52. \nFor  FY  2017,  Congress  has  appropriated  $396  million  for  the  Byrne  JAG  program. \nConsolidated  Appropriations  Act  of 2017,  Pub.

The  State  of Oregon  may  retain  some  of these  funds  for \nitself,  see  id.  ยง  10156(c)(1),  and  must  disburse  the  rest  to  its  local  governments,  see  id. \nยง  10156(c)(2). \n54. \nThe  State  of Oregon  has  received  Byrne  JAG  funds  every  year  since  the  programโs \ncreation  in  2005.  The  State  of Oregon  has  used  Byrne  JAG  funds  to  support  drug  treatment  and \nenforcement  programs,  mental  health  programs,  and  technology  improvement  programs  among \nother  efforts.  With  respect  to  the  FY  2017  Byrne  JAG  award,  the  State  of Oregon  planned  to  use \nthe  grants  to  support  specialty  courts  designed  to  address  root  causes  of criminal  activity  and  to \nprovide  statewide  assistance  to  local  crime  victims.  For  FY  2018,  the  State  of Oregon  plans  to \nuse  Byrne  JAG  funds  to  support  specialty  court  programs  that  target  non-violent  felony  offenders \nin  an  integrated,  systemic  approach  to  reduce  drug  use  and  recidivism  while  increasing  public \nsafety. \n55. \nTo  date,  the  State  of Oregon  has  not  received  the  FY  2017  grant  totaling  $2,034,945  that \nCongress  has  appropriated  in  law  enforcement  funding  to  the  State  of Oregon  and  its  political \nsubdivisions  pursuant  to  the  Byrne  JAG  program. \n56. \nFor  FY  2018,  the  State  of Oregon  anticipates  receiving  $2,092,704,  but  the  State \nanticipates  that  Defendants  will  also  withhold  the  FY  2018  funds. \nPage  17  -  FIRST  AMENDED  COMPLAINT  FOR  DECLARATORY,  INJUNCTIVE,  AND \nMANDAMUS  RELIEF \nJustice #9293999 v3 \nOregon Department of Justice \n1162 Court Street NE \nSalem, OR 97301 \n(503) 947-4700 / Fax: (503) 947-4791\n  \n57. \nThe  City  has  also  received  Byrne  JAG  funds  every  year  since  the  programโs  creation  in \n2005.  The  City  has  used  Byrne  JAG  funds,  among  other  things,  to  purchase  bulletproof vests  and \nspecial-threat  plates,  tactical  medical  kits,  GPS  systems,  and  to  fund  a  victimsโ  advocate  in  the \nSex  Crimes  Unit.  In  addition,  the  City,  as  authorized  by  the  Byrne  JAG  statute,  has  passed  on \nfunds  to  subrecipients  Multnomah  County  and  the  City  of Gresham,  who  have  used  those  Byrne \nJAG  funds  to  support,  among  other  things,  a  Neighborhood  Deputy  District  Attorney,  police \nequipment,  and  a  parole  and  probation  officer. \n58. \nThe  City  has  now  been  awarded,  but  has  not  yet  received,  the  FY  2017  JAG  award \ntotaling  $385,515  that  Congress  has  appropriated  in  law-enforcement  funding  for  the  City  and  its \nsubgrantees  pursuant  to  the  Byrne  JAG  program.  Moreover,  Defendants  have  indicated  that  they \nmay  seek  to  enforce  immigration  enforcement  requirements  against  the  City  or  seek \nreimbursement  of  any  disbursed  FY  2017  funds  from  the  City  if Defendants  prevail  in  their \nseparate  action  against  the  United  States  Conference  of Mayors. \n59. \nFor  FY  2018,  the  City  anticipates  receiving  $391,694  in  Byrne  JAG  funds.  Of those  FY \n2018  funds,  $189,585  are  to  be  retained  by  the  City  for  its  Police  Bureau,  $148,960  are  to  be \npassed  on  to  subgrantee  Multnomah  County  for  its  district  attorneyโs  office,  and  $53,149  are  to \nbe  passed  on  to  subgrantee  City  of  Gresham  for  its  police  bureau.  The  City  anticipates  that \nDefendants  will  withhold  the  FY  2018  funds. \nDefendants  Impose  Three  Unlawful  Conditions  on  Byrne  JAG  Funds \n60. \nThe  Byrne  JAG  authorizing  statute,  34  U.S.C.  ยง  10153(a)(5)(D),  requires  that \njurisdictions  comply  with  โapplicable  Federal  laws.โ \nPage  18  -  FIRST  AMENDED  COMPLAINT  FOR  DECLARATORY,  INJUNCTIVE,  AND \nMANDAMUS  RELIEF \nJustice #9293999 v3 \nOregon Department of Justice \n1162 Court Street NE \nSalem, OR 97301 \n(503) 947-4700 / Fax: (503) 947-4791\n  \n61. \nOn  July  25,  2017,  Defendants  announced  they  were  seeking  state  and  municipal \napplications  for  FY  2017  Byrne  JAG  funds.

Nor  does  the  City  of Portland  allege  or  concede  that  its  Police \nBureau  policies  are  inconsistent  with  those  conditions.  Plaintiffsโ  compliance  or  noncompliance \nis  ultimately  immaterial  to  the  question  whether  Defendants  have  authority  to  impose  the \nconditions.

Defendants  have  also  expanded  the  Compliance  condition  to  incorporate \n8  U.S.C.  ยง  1644  in  addition  to  ยง  1373.  Given  the  substantive  similarities  between  the  two  federal \nstatutes,  this  addition  does  not  appear  to  meaningfully  change  the  nature  of the  Compliance \nCondition. \n77. \nIn  addition  to  the  certification  required  with  regard  to  the  Compliance  Condition,  the \n2018  application  requires  applicants  to  respond  to  questions  related  to  the  Compliance \nCondition: \n(1)  Does  your jurisdiction  have  any  laws,  policies,  or  practices  related  to \nwhether,  when,  or  how  employees  may  communicate  with  DHS  or  ICE? \nPage  23  -  FIRST  AMENDED  COMPLAINT  FOR  DECLARATORY,  INJUNCTIVE,  AND \nMANDAMUS  RELIEF \nJustice #9293999 v3 \nOregon Department of Justice \n1162 Court Street NE \nSalem, OR 97301 \n(503) 947-4700 / Fax: (503) 947-4791\n  \n(2)  Is  your jurisdiction  subject  to  any  laws  from  a  superior  political  entity \n(e.g.,  a  State  law  that  binds  a  city)  that  meet  the  description  in  question  |? \nAnswers,  and  potentially  additional  material,  โmust  be  provided  by  the  applicant  as  part  of the \nJAG  application,โ  as  a  condition  of receiving  Byrne  JAG  funds. \n78. \nThe  FY  2018  Byrne  JAG  application  also  states  that  the  โreasonable  costsโ  of complying \nwith  the  Notice  and  Access  Conditions,  including  the  costs  of  โhonoring  any  duly  authorized \nrequests  from  DHS  that  is  encompassed  by  these  conditions,  will  be  allowable  costs  under  the \naward.โ  That  provision  further  demonstrates  Defendantsโ  usurpation  of the  Congressional \nspending  power.  Byrne  JAG  funds,  which  Congress  explicitly  directed  to  support  local  criminal- \njustice  efforts,  will  instead  be  used  to  unlawfully  fund  federal  immigration  enforcement. \n79. \nThe  FY  2018  Byrne  JAG  applications  also  purport  to  condition  awards  on  the \njurisdictionโs  chief legal  officer  (the  Attorney  General  for  the  State  of Oregon,  and  the  City \nAttorney  for  the  City  of Portland)  certifying  that  the jurisdiction  will  not  โviolate,  or  aid  or  abet \nany  violation  of,  8  U.S.C.  ยง1324(a)  (forbidding  any  โperson,โ  in  โknowing  or  in  reckless \ndisregard  of the  fact  that  an  alien  has  come  to,  entered,  or  remains  in  the  United  States  in \nviolation  of law,โ  to  โconceal,  harbor,  or  shield  from  detection,  or  attempt  to  conceal,  harbor,  or \nshield  from  detection,  such  alien  in  any  place,  including  any  building  or  any  means  to  aid  or  abet \nin  the  commission  of the  preceding  actsโ).โ \nDefendants  Lack  Authority  to  Impose  the  Compliance  Condition \n80. \nBecause  8  U.S.C.  ยงยง  1373  and  1644  violate  the  Tenth  Amendment,  Defendants  may  not \nrely  on  the  Compliance  Condition  to  withhold  Plaintiffsโ  FY  2017  Byrne  JAG  funds,  or  to  reject \nPlaintiffsโ  FY  2018  Byrne  JAG  applications.

This  constitutional  anti-commandeering  principle  โis  one  of the  Constitutionโs \nstructural  protections  of liberty.โ  Printz  v.  United  States,  521  U.S.  898,  921  (1997).  Among \nother benefits,  the  anti-ccommandeering  principle  ensures  that  the  sovereign  states  are  free  to \nlegislate  as  they  see  fit  to  promote  the  safety  and  welfare  of their  residents. \n81. \nThe  Supreme  Court  recently  affirmed  that  the  anti-commandeering  principle  prevents \nCongress  from  issuing  direct  orders  to  state  legislatures.  Murphy  v.  NCAA,  138  S.  Ct.  at  1478. \nThis  is  precisely  what  8  U.S.C.  ยง  1373(a)  and  (b)  and  ยง  1644  do.  These  provisions  dictate  to \nstates  like  Oregon  that  they  may  not  promulgate  laws  or  regulations  that  prohibit  state  or  local \nofficials  from  sharing  immigration-status  information  with  federal  officials,  even  if  sharing  that \ninformation  would  directly  undermine  state  or  local  programs.  โA  more  direct  affront  to  state \nsovereignty  is  not  easy  to  imagine.โ  /d.  Sections  1373(a)-(b)  and  1644  regulate  only  state \nactors,  and  regulate  them  only  in  their  capacity  as  state  actors.  Thus  neither  is  a  preemptive \nfederal  law.  Murphy  v.  NCAA,  138  S.  Ct.  at  1481.  8  U.S.C.  ยง  1373(a)-(b)  and  ยง  1644  are \nunconstitutional. \n82. \nDefendants  may  not  condition  Oregonโs  or  the  Cityโs  Byrne  JAG  funds  on  their \ncompliance  with  an  unconstitutional  statute.  City  of Chicago  v.

The  creation  of these  conditions  by  the \nexecutive  branch  to  impede  congressionally-appropriated  funding  of state  and  local  law \nenforcement  violates  the  doctrine  of  separation  of powers  by  invading  Congressโs  spending \nauthority.  โโThe  power  of the  purse  does  not  belong  to  the  Executive  Branch.  It  rests  in  the \nLegislative  Branch.โ  City  of Chicago  v.  Sessions,  888  F.3d  at  283.  Defendants,  as  executive \nbranch  officials,  have  no  authority  to  impose  additional  conditions  on  the  receipt  of funds \nappropriated  by  the  legislative  branch  for  the  Byrne  JAG  program;  the  authority  to  condition  the \nreceipt  of federal  funds  lies  exclusively  with  Congress.  As  the  Seventh  Circuit  held  in  City  of \nChicago  v.  Sessions,  888  F.3d  at  283-87,  the  Byrne  JAG  statute  does  not  contain  a  single \nprovision  that  could  authorize  Defendants  to  impose  the  Access  and  Notice  Conditions  on  any \nstate  or  local jurisdiction.  Nor  does  any  other  statute  grant  Defendants  such  authority. \n84. \nFinally,  nothing  in  the  Byrne  JAG  statutes  empowers  Defendants  to  simply  decline  to \nissue  an  award  letter  to  any jurisdiction  that,  in  Defendantsโ  estimation,  does  not  share  the \nDepartmentโs  commitment  to  enforcing  federal  immigration  policy.  As  noted  above,  the  Byrne \nJAG  is  a  formula  grant  administered  by  Defendants,  who  โshallโ  allocate  all  congressionally- \nappropriated  funds  to  each  state  and  qualifying  unit  of local  government  according  to  a \nprescribed  methodology.  34  U.S.C.  ยงยง  10156(a),  (b),  (c),  (d).

This  anti-commandeering  principle  also  forbids  Congress  from  unequivocally \ndictating  what  a  state  legislature  may  and  may  not  do. \n87. \nSections  1373  and  1644  on  their  face  violate  the  Tenth  Amendment  because  they  require \nstate  and  local  governments  to  govern  according  to  Congressโs  instructions. \n88. \nIn  addition,  Sections  1373  and  1644  on  their  face  violate  the  Tenth  Amendment  because \nthey  commandeer  state  and  local  officials  to  administer  or  enforce  a  federal  regulatory  program. \n89. \nBecause  Sections  1373  and  1644  violate  the  Tenth  Amendment,  Defendants  cannot \nrequire  the  State  of Oregon  and  the  City  to  certify  compliance  with  these  unconstitutional \nstatutes. \n90. \nAn  actual  controversy  exists  because  Defendants  are  requiring  the  State  of  Oregon  and \nthe  City  to  certify  compliance  with  Sections  1373  and  1644  in  order  to  obtain  congressionally \nPage  27  -  FIRST  AMENDED  COMPLAINT  FOR  DECLARATORY,  INJUNCTIVE,  AND \nMANDAMUS  RELIEF \nJustice #9293999 v3 \nOregon Department of Justice \n1162 Court Street NE \nSalem, OR 97301 \n(503) 947-4700 / Fax: (503) 947-4791\nappropriated  federal  funds  even  though  the  two  statutes  violate  the  Tenth  Amendment. \n91. \nPursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  ยง  2201,  Plaintiffs  are  entitled  to  a  declaration  that  Sections  1373 \nand  1644  violate  the  Tenth  Amendment  and  are  unconstitutional. \n92. \nPlaintiffs  are  also  entitled  to  a  declaration  that  Defendants  cannot  rely  on  these  statutes, \nor  on  any  reporting  or  certification  requirements  related  to  these  statutes,  to  withhold  the  Byrne \nJAG  funds  under  the  Compliance  Condition. \n93. \nPlaintiffs  are  also  entitled  to  injunctive  relief prohibiting  Defendants  from  withholding \nFY  2017  Byrne  JAG  funds  due  to  them. \n94. \nPlaintiffs  are  also  entitled  to  injunctive  relief prohibiting  Defendants  from  declining  to \naccept  and  process  Plaintiffsโ  FY  2018  Byrne  JAG  applications,  and  from  withholding  FY  2018 \nByrne  JAG  funds  due  to  State  of Oregon  and  the  City. \nSECOND  CLAIM  FOR  RELIEF \nVIOLATION  OF  CONGRESSIONAL  SPENDING  AUTHORITY  AND  SEPARATION \nOF  POWERS \nDECLARATORY  AND  INJUNCTIVE  RELIEF \n(Ultra  Vires  as  to  the  Access  and  Notice  Conditions) \n95. \nPlaintiffs  repeat  and  re-allege  Paragraphs  |  through  94  as  if fully  set  forth  herein. \n96. \nArticle  I,  Section  I  of the  United  States  Constitution  vests  Congress  with  legislative \npowers,  and  Article  I,  Section  VIII  of the  United  States  Constitution  vests  exclusively  in \nCongress  the  spending  power  to  โprovide  for  *  *  *  the  General  Welfare  of the  United  States.โ \nPage  28  -  FIRST  AMENDED  COMPLAINT  FOR  DECLARATORY,  INJUNCTIVE,  AND \nMANDAMUS  RELIEF \nJustice #9293999 v3 \nOregon Department of Justice \n1162 Court Street NE \nSalem, OR 97301 \n(503) 947-4700 / Fax: (503) 947-4791\nAbsent  a  statutory  provision  or  express  delegation,  only  Congress  is  empowered  to  attach \nconditions  to  federal  funds. \n97. \nDefendants  are  officials  of the  Executive  Branch.

Oregon, Eugene Division. \nSigned August 7, 2019. \n950*950 Marc Abrams, Oregon Department of Justice, Tracy Pool Reeve, Denis M. Vannier, \nNaomi Sheffield, Portland City Attorney's Office, Portland, OR, Justin E. Kidd, Peenesh H. \nShah, Timothy Daly Smith, Oregon Department of Justice, Salem, OR, for Plaintiffs. \nDaniel D. Mauler, U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Division, W. Scott Simpson, US \nDepartment of Justice, Washington, DC, for Defendants. \nOPINION AND ORDER \nMichael J. McShane, United States District Judge. \nThe present dispute touches upon many of the same principles and tensions which have \nanimated our Republic's legal and political discourse since its founding. The President of \nthe United States and his Attorney General seek to advance their policy priorities by \npressuring states and localities to comply with two immigration-related laws and by \nwithholding federal funds from jurisdictions which refuse to assist immigration authorities. \nThe laws at issue, 8 U.S.C. ยงยง 1373 and 1644, prohibit states and localities from enacting \nrules which prevent their employees from sharing a person's immigration status with federal \nofficials. The State of Oregon and the City of Portland, both of which have been targeted, \nbelieve that Sections 1373 and 1644 are unconstitutional intrusions upon their legislative \nindependence. They also believe that the funding conditions imposed by the Attorney \nGeneral are contrary to the intent of Congress. The case comes before the Court on \nDefendants' Motion to Dismiss and Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment. Because \nSections 1373 and 1644 violate the Tenth Amendment, and Defendants otherwise lack the \nauthority to withhold the disputed funds, Plaintiffs' motion is GRANTED in part. \nBACKGROUND \n\n \n \nI. The Byrne JAG Program \nThe present conflict centers on the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant \nProgram (\"Byrne JAG Program\"). See Pub. L. No. 109-162, ยง 1111, 1119 Stat. 2960, 3094 \n(2006) (codified as amended at 34 U.S.C. ยงยง 10151-10158). The Byrne JAG Program is a \nfederal grant program administered by the Office of Justice Programs, a subdivision of the \nUnited States Department of Justice. See 34 U.S.C. ยงยง 10101-10102, 10141, 10151. The \npurpose of the Byrne JAG Program is to support state and local criminal justice efforts by \nproviding an additional source of funding for personnel, equipment, training, and other \nneeds. Id. ยง 10152(a)(1). States and localities may use Byrne JAG funds to support criminal \njustice initiatives in several different areas, including law enforcement, prosecution, crime \nprevention, corrections, drug treatment, technology, mental health, and victim and witness \nservices. See id. ยงยง 10152(a)(1), 10153(a). \nUnder the Byrne JAG Program, grants are distributed directly to states and localities \naccording to a formula, the variables of which are derived from a jurisdiction's population \nand violent crime statistics. 34 U.S.C. ยง 10156. To receive and draw upon 951*951 a Byrne \nJAG award, a jurisdiction must apply to the Attorney General in the form and manner \nprescribed by statute, see id. ยงยง 10153, 10155, and comply with all lawful conditions \noutlined in the grant solicitation and award documents, see, e.g., Schmidt Decl. Exs. 1, 11, \nECF No. 22; Defs.' Req. for Judicial Notice in Supp. Mot. Dismiss (\"RJN\") Exs. E, F, ECF \nNo. 15. A jurisdiction, once awarded its statutory share of funds, may also make subawards \nto local governments and community organizations. 34 U.S.C. ยง 10152(b). Although funds \nappropriated by Congress for the Byrne JAG Program must be allocated according to the \nstatutory formula, the Attorney General retains some discretion to reserve and redistribute \ncertain funds. See id. ยงยง 10156(f), 101057. \nII. History of Participation \nThe State of Oregon had, until 2017, received Byrne JAG funds every year since the \nprogram's creation in 2005. Schmidt Decl. ยถ 6; Nordeen Decl. ยถ 2, ECF No. 25; see \nalso RJN Ex. A. During that time, the State of Oregon used its more than $26 million in \nByrne JAG funds to support, among other things, programs for mental health treatment, \ntechnology improvement, and drug treatment and enforcement. Schmidt Decl. ยถ 9. With \nrespect to the contested FY 2017 award, the State of Oregon plans to use its funds to \nsupport specialty courts designed to address root causes of criminal activity and provide \nstatewide assistance to local crime victims. Schmidt Decl. ยถยถ 12, 15, Ex. 4 at 2, 7-8, 16-17. \nWith respect to the contested FY 2018 award, the State of Oregon plans to use its funds to \nsupport specialty court programs which target non-violent felony offenders in an integrated, \nsystemic approach to reduce drug use and recidivism while increasing public safety. \nSchmidt Decl. ยถ 22, Ex. 12 at 1-2, 8-14, 20-21. \nSimilarly, the City of Portland had, until 2017, received Byrne JAG funds every year since \nthe program's creation in 2005. Nordeen Decl. ยถ 2; see also RJN, Ex. B. During that time, \nthe City of Portland used its Byrne JAG funds to, among other things, purchase bulletproof \n\n \n \nvests and special-threat plates, acquire tactical medical kits, install Global Positioning \nSystems, and add two Victim Advocates to the Portland Police Bureau's Sex Crimes Unit. \nNordeen Decl. ยถ 3. In addition, the City of Portland has historically distributed funds to \nsubrecipients Multnomah County and the City of Gresham, which have used those funds to, \namong other things, support a Neighborhood Deputy District Attorney, purchase police \nequipment, and add a full-time Parole and Probation Officer. Nordeen Decl. ยถ 4. The City of \nPortland plans to support similar initiatives with the contested FY 2017 and FY 2018 funds. \nNordeen Decl. Exs. 2, 5. \nIII. FY 2017 and FY 2018 Funding Conditions \nStarting in 2017, the Attorney General imposed three new immigration-related conditions on \nthe receipt of Byrne JAG funds. See generally Schmidt Decl. Exs. 1-3; Nordeen Decl. Ex. 1; \nRJN Ex. D. The conditions are included in the FY 2017 state and local solicitations \npromulgated by the Department of Justice and, more importantly, the award agreements \nadopted by grantees. See, e.g., Schmidt Decl. Ex. 1; Nordeen Decl. Ex. 1; RJN Ex. D. As \nrelevant here, a jurisdiction must formally agree to each condition prior to drawing upon an \naward of FY 2017 Byrne JAG funds. See, e.g., RJN Ex. D ยถ 1. The FY 2017 conditions can \nbe summarized as follows: \nโข Notice Condition: A grantee must provide 48 hours' \"advance notice\"โor as much \nadvance notice as is \"practicable\"โof the \"scheduled release date and time\" of any alien in \nthe jurisdiction's custody if the jurisdiction 952*952 receives a \"formal written request\" from \nthe United States Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"). RJN Ex. D ยถ 55; see \nalso Schmidt Decl. ยถยถ 13-15, Exs. 1-3; Nordeen Decl. Exs. 1, 4. \nโข Access Condition: A grantee must allow DHS personnel to \"access\" any detention facility \nwhich it maintains and \"meet with individuals who are (or are believed ... to be) aliens\" and \n\"inquire as to their right to be or remain in the United States.\" RJN Ex. D ยถ 55; see \nalso Schmidt Decl. ยถยถ 13-15, Exs. 1-3; Nordeen Decl. Exs. 1, 4. \nโข Compliance Condition: A grantee must certify that it complies with 8 U.S.C. ยง 1373. RJN \nEx. D ยถ 54; see also Schmidt Decl. ยถยถ 13-15, Exs. 1-3; Nordeen Decl. Exs. 1, 4. Section \n1373 provides that no \"State[] or local government entity or official may ... prohibit, or in any \nway restrict, any government entity or official from sending to, or receiving from, the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service information regarding the citizenship or immigration \nstatus... of any individual.\" 8 U.S.C. ยง 1373(a). \nIn 2018, the Attorney General again imposed immigration-related conditions on the receipt \nof Byrne JAG funds. See generally Schmidt Decl. Ex. 11; Nordeen Decl. Ex. 4; RJN Exs. E, \nF. Two of those conditions are substantively indistinguishable from the Notice and Access \nConditions described above. RJN Ex. E ยถยถ 45-46; see also Schmidt Decl. ยถ 22, Ex. 11 at 1, \n35-37, 42-43; Nordeen Decl. Ex. 4 at 36-37, 42-43. A third condition merely expands the \nCompliance Condition to include 8 U.S.C. ยง 1644โa statute which is functionally equivalent \nto Section 1373โand to require that jurisdictions describe any \"laws, policies, or practices \nrelated to whether, when, or how employees may communicate with DHS or [Immigration \nand Customs Enforcement].\" Schmidt Decl. Ex. 11 at 27-28, 52; see also Nordeen Decl. Ex. \n\n \n \n4 at 52; RJN Ex. E ยถ 47. But a fourth and final FY 2018 condition imposes a new restriction \non grantees' conduct: \nโข Disclosure Condition: A grantee must not publicly disclose \"federal law enforcement \ninformation in a direct or indirect attempt to conceal, harbor, or shield from detection any \nfugitive from justice\" or any \"alien who has come to, entered, or remains in the United \nStates\" in violation of federal law. RJN Ex. E ยถ 44.  \n[1]\nAs with FY 2017 Byrne JAG awards, grantees must formally agree to each of the \nimmigration-related conditions prior to drawing upon their FY 2018 funds. See, e.g., RJN \nExs. E, F. Thus, even if a jurisdiction receives a notice of award from the Department of \nJustice, it may not draw upon those funds until it agrees to the conditions listed in the award \ndocument. 953*953 See RJN Ex. E ยถ 1 (\"Failure to comply with any one or more of these \naward requirements... may result in the Office of Justice Programs ... withhold[ing] award \nfunds, disallow[ing] costs, or suspend[ing] or terminat[ing] the award.\"); see also Schmidt \nDecl. Ex. 11 at 1; Nordeen Decl. Ex. 4 at 1. \nIV. FY 2017 and FY 2018 Awards \nPlaintiffs applied in August 2017 for a FY 2017 Byrne JAG award and in August 2018 for a \nFY 2018 Byrne JAG award. See Schmidt Decl. ยถยถ 15, 22, Exs. 4, 11; Nordeen Decl. ยถยถ 6, \n12, Exs. 2, 5. Based on the statutory formula, the State of Oregon expected to receive \n$2,034,945 for FY 2017 and $2,092,704 for FY 2018, Schmidt Decl. Ex. 13 at 1, Ex. 14 at 1, \nwhile the City of Portland expected to receive $385,515 for FY 2017 and $391,694 for FY \n2018, see Nordeen Decl. ยถ 11, Ex. 2. Defendants anticipated issuing Byrne JAG award \nnotifications by September 30, 2017 for FY 2017 grantees and September 30, 2018 for FY \n2018 grantees. See Schmidt Decl. Ex. 1 at 31, Ex. 11 at 35; Nordeen Decl. Ex. 1 at 29, Ex. \n4 at 35 \nAs represented at oral argument, however, the State of Oregon did not receive notice of its \nFY 2017 or FY 2018 Byrne JAG awards until July 2019. That delay was the result of \nconcerns within the Department of Justice that at least one Oregon law, Or. Rev. Stat. ยง \n181A.820, prevents the State of Oregon from satisfying the Notice, Access, and \nCompliance Conditions. See Schmidt Decl. ยถยถ 17-18, Exs. 6-9. Section 181A.820 provides \nin relevant part that \"[n]o law enforcement agency of the State of Oregon or any political \nsubdivision of the state\" may use \"agency moneys, equipment, or personnel\" to \"detect[] or \napprehend[]\" persons whose only transgression is the violation of \"federal immigration \nlaws.\"  Although the State of Oregon recently received its FY 2017 and FY 2018 awards, \n[2]\nthe Department of Justice's view of Section 181A.820 is seemingly unchanged. The State of \nOregon, as such, cannot accept or draw upon the funds without risking penalties. See, \ne.g., Schmidt Decl. Ex. 3 (stating that the Department of Justice will, among other actions, \n\"claw back\" funds from jurisdictions which violate the challenged conditions). \nThe City of Portland is in a similar position. Although the City of Portland received its FY \n2017 Byrne JAG award on October 10, 2018, Defendants only issued the award pursuant to \n\n \n \na preliminary injunction in City of Evanston v. Sessions, No. 18-cv-4853 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 9, \n2018). Defendants have yet to issue the City of Portland its FY 2018 Byrne JAG award. \nNordeen Decl. ยถ 14. Despite multiple inquiries from the City of Portland, the Department of \nJustice has offered no explanation for the ten-month delay. Nordeen Decl. Exs. 6-7. As a \npolitical subdivision of the State of Oregon, however, the City of Portland is subject to \nSection 181A.820. Its Police Bureau is also bound by an internal rule, Directive 810.10, \nwhich mirrors Section 181A.820 and prohibits personnel from \"enforcing or assisting in the \nenforcement of federal immigration laws.\" RJN Ex. G at 2; see also Nordeen Decl. ยถ 17. \nThus, even if Defendants were to issue a FY 2018 award to the City of Portland, it would be \nunable to accept or draw upon those funds without risking penalties for 954*954 perceived \nviolations of the Notice, Access, and Compliance Conditions. \nV. Conflicting Policy Priorities \nDefendants maintain that the contested conditions and statutesโand, by implication, the \npressure on Plaintiffs to repeal their allegedly incompatible laws and policiesโare essential \nto a properly functioning system of federal immigration laws. See Defs.' Mot. Dismiss 1, \nECF No. 14. They point in particular to the extensive intergovernmental coordination and \ncooperation contemplated by the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), 8 U.S.C. ยงยง 1101-\n1537. See Defs.' Mot. Dismiss 6-9. As relevant here, that cooperation and coordination \nincludes, among other things, the decision to allow state and local governments to \nprosecute and punish illegal aliens who commit crimes before allowing the federal \ngovernment to take immigration measures against those same persons. See 8 U.S.C. ยง \n1231; see also id. ยง 1226(c)(1) (mandating that immigration detention for removal \nproceedings begin only \"when the alien is released\" from state or local criminal detention). \nDefendants believe that this and other features of the INA are only practicable if state and \nlocal governments provide information and access to immigration authorities. \nPlaintiffs, however, believe that the health, welfare, and public safety of their residents is \nbest served by refraining from the enforcement and administration of federal immigration \nlaws. See Shah Decl. Exs. 1-4; Nordeen Decl. ยถยถ 16-17, Ex. 8. That determination, they \nexplain, is reflected in the laws and policies targeted by Defendants. See Shah Decl. Exs. 1-\n4; Nordeen Decl. ยถยถ 16-17, Ex. 8. According to Plaintiffs, those laws and policies are \ninstrumental to ensuring that all members of their communities feel safe cooperating with \nand obtaining the assistance of law enforcement agencies. See Shah Decl. ยถยถ Exs. 1-4; \nNordeen Decl. ยถยถ 16-17, Ex. 8. In particular, Plaintiffs believe that, when state and local \nofficials are associated with federal immigration enforcement, vulnerable victims and \nwitnesses are less likely to come forward and report crimes, creating a danger to all \nmembers of their communities. See Shah Decl. Exs. 1-4; Nordeen Decl. ยถยถ 16-17, Ex. 8. \nPlaintiffs have, as such, declined to change their laws and policies in the face of funding \npressures from the President and his Attorney General. \nVI. Procedural History of the Lawsuit \n\n \n \nThe State of Oregon initiated the present action on November 9, 2018. Shortly thereafter, \nthe City of Portland joined in the suit and, together, the State of Oregon and the City of \nPortland submitted an amended complaint on November 21, 2018. In their First Amended \nComplaint (\"FAC\"), ECF No. 3, Plaintiffs challenge Defendants' authority to impose the \nNotice, Access, and Disclosure Conditions. They also bring a facial constitutional challenge \nto Sections 1373 and 1644, the statutes on which the Compliance Condition is based. To \nremedy their injuries, Plaintiffs seek declaratory, injunctive, and mandamus relief. On March \n5, 2019, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss. In response, on April 8, Plaintiffs filed a \nMotion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 21. After briefing and oral argument, both motions \nare now before the Court. \nSTANDARDS \nI. Motion to Dismiss Under Rule 12(b)(1) \nA motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) tests the subject matter jurisdiction of a \nfederal court. Under the U.S. Constitution, this Court is without jurisdiction to resolve any \nclaim which is not ripe for review, Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric. Prods. Co., 473 U.S. \n568, 579, 955*955 105 S.Ct. 3325, 87 L.Ed.2d 409 (1985), or which a plaintiff lacks standing \nto assert, Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d \n351 (1992). At a constitutional minimum, standing requires a plaintiff to show that she has \n\"suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the \ndefendant, and that the injury can be traced to the challenged action and is likely to be \nredressed by a favorable decision.\" Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Ams. United for \nSeparation of Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 472, 102 S.Ct. 752, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 \n(1982) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Similarly, a claim is ripe within the \nmeaning of Article III if it presents \"concrete legal issues\" in the context of \"actual cases, not \nabstractions.\" United Pub. Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 89, 67 S.Ct. 556, 91 L.Ed. 754 \n(1947) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The party invoking federal \njurisdiction bears the burden of establishing both requirements. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561, 112 \nS.Ct. 2130. \nII. Motion to Dismiss Under Rule 12(b)(6) \nTo survive a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), a complaint must contain \nfactual allegations sufficient to \"state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\" Bell \nAtlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). A \nclaim is plausible on its face when the factual allegations allow a court to infer the \ndefendant's liability based on the alleged conduct. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 663, 129 \nS.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). The factual allegations must present more than \"the \nmere possibility of misconduct.\" Id. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937. When considering a motion to \ndismiss, a court must accept all allegations of material fact as true and construe those facts \nin the light most favorable to the non-moving party, Burgert v. Lokelani Bernice Pauahi \nBishop Trust, 200 F.3d 661, 663 (9th Cir. 2000), but it is \"not bound to accept as true a legal \n\n \n \nconclusion couched as a factual allegation,\" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955. If a \ncomplaint is dismissed, the court must grant the plaintiff leave to amend unless it \n\"determines that the pleading could not possibly be cured by the allegation of other \nfacts.\" Doe v. United States, 58 F.3d 494, 497 (9th Cir. 1995). \nIII. Motion for Summary Judgment Under Rule 56(a) \nA district court must award summary judgment \"if the movant shows that there is no \ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of \nlaw.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A fact is \"material\" if it could affect the outcome of the case and \nan issue is \"genuine\" if a reasonable jury could find in favor of the non-moving party. Rivera \nv. Phillip Morris, Inc., 395 F.3d 1142, 1146 (9th Cir. 2005) (citation omitted). When ruling on \na motion for summary judgment, the court must view the evidence in the light most \nfavorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences in her \nfavor. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 \n(1986). If the movant carries her burden, then the non-moving party must present \"specific \nfacts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\" Matsushita Elec. Indus. v. Zenith Radio \nCorp., 475 U.S. 574, 586-87, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (internal quotation marks \nomitted) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)). The \"mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in \nsupport of the plaintiff's position [is] insufficient\" to avoid summary judgment. Liberty Lobby, \nInc., 477 U.S. at 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505. \n DISCUSSION \n956*956\nPlaintiffs challenge the Notice, Access, Compliance, and Disclosure Conditions on three \nmain grounds. First, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants are without constitutional or statutory \nauthority to impose the Notice, Access, and Disclosure Conditions upon recipients of Byrne \nJAG funds and that the promulgation of those conditions therefore infringes on the power \nvested in Congress under the Spending Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Second, Plaintiffs \ncontend that, insofar as the Compliance Condition is premised on a valid congressional \ndelegation of condition-making authority, that authority cannot include the conditioning of \nfunds on compliance with statutes which violate the Tenth Amendment. Finally, Plaintiffs \nargue that, even if they possess the statutory authority to impose all four of the challenged \nconditions, Defendants run afoul of limitations inherent in the Spending Clause. Defendants \ncontest each of Plaintiffs' legal arguments and move to dismiss the FAC on standing and \nripeness grounds. Because the standing and ripeness requirements of Article III are \njurisdictional, the Court addresses them first. \nI. Justiciability: Standing and Ripeness \nDefendants argue that the Court is without jurisdiction to resolve the present \ndispute. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). They contend both that Plaintiffs lack standing to \nbring their claims and that their claims are not ripe for judicial review. With respect to each \ntheory, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have yet to suffer a concrete injury as a result of \n\n \n \nDefendants' challenged conduct and that any otherwise cognizable injuries are contingent \nupon future events. Defendants also take issue with Plaintiffs' prayer for an injunction \nagainst all future immigration-related conditions on Byrne JAG fundsโincluding those not \npresently before the Courtโand argue that Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate an actual or \nimminent injury from conditions which do not yet exist. In response, Plaintiffs argue that they \nare suffering from an ongoing financial and budgetary injury as a result of Defendants' \nrefusal to disburse Byrne JAG funds without the challenged conditions. Alternatively, they \nargue that, by imposing the conditions and moving to enforce Sections 1373 and 1644, \nDefendants are presently attempting to interfere with both the exercise of Plaintiffs' \nsovereign police powers and their rights under federal law.  \n[3]\nUnder Article III of the U.S. Constitution, the \"judicial Power\" of federal courts is limited to \n\"Cases\" and \"Controversies.\" U.S. Const. art. III, ยงยง 1-2. One component of this \nconstitutional limitation is that a federal court may not \"decide the merits of [a] dispute\" \nunless the plaintiff demonstrates that she has \"standing\" as to each of her claims and \nrequested forms of relief. Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d \n343 (1975); see also City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 105, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 \nL.Ed.2d 675 (1983). To have Article III standing, a plaintiff must show that (1) she has \nsuffered an \"injury-in-fact,\" (2) her injury is \"fairly traceable\" to the actions of the defendant, \nand (3) her injury is likely to be \"redressed by a favorable decision.\" Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560-\n61, 957*957 112 S.Ct. 2130 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). An injury-in-fact \nis one which stems from a \"legally protected interest\" and is both \"(a) concrete and \nparticularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\" Id. at 560, 112 \nS.Ct. 2130. A threat of \"future injury\" may satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement if the \n\"threatened injury is certainly impending\" or there is a \"substantial risk that the harm will \noccur.\" Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 158, 134 S.Ct. 2334, 189 L.Ed.2d \n246 (2014). As the Ninth Circuit recently reiterated, a plaintiff \"need only show a slight injury \nfor standing.\" City of Los Angeles v. Barr, 929 F.3d 1163, 1173-74 (9th Cir. 2019) (citation \nomitted). \nThe \"Case\" or \"Controversy\" limitation of Article III also mandates that a plaintiff's claim be \n\"ripe\" for judicial review. Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric. Prods. Co., 473 U.S. 568, 579, \n105 S.Ct. 3325, 87 L.Ed.2d 409 (1985). The ripeness inquiry aims to ensure that any \"harm \nasserted has matured sufficiently to warrant judicial intervention.\" Warth, 422 U.S. at 499 \nn.10, 95 S.Ct. 2197 (citations omitted). A claim is ripe within the meaning of Article III if it \npresents \"concrete legal issues\" in the context of \"actual cases, not abstractions.\" United \nPub. Workers, 330 U.S. at 89, 67 S.Ct. 556 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \nIn evaluating ripeness, the core Article III inquiry is whether a claim \"involves uncertain or \ncontingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at \nall.\" Texas v. United States, 523 U.S. 296, 300, 118 S.Ct. 1257, 140 L.Ed.2d 406 \n(1998) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). To that end, the \"constitutional \ncomponent of the ripeness inquiry is often treated under the rubric of standing and, in many \ncases, ripeness coincides squarely with standing's injury in fact prong.\" Thomas v. \nAnchorage Equal Rights Comm'n, 220 F.3d 1134, 1138 (9th Cir. 2000); see also Skull \nValley Band of Goshute Indians v. Nielson, 376 F.3d 1223, 1234 (10th Cir. 2004) (\"Standing \n\n \n \nand ripeness are closely related in that each focuses on whether the harm asserted has \nmatured sufficiently to warrant judicial intervention.\"). \nHere, the Court agrees with Plaintiffs, as well as every other court to have examined similar \nstanding and ripeness challenges, that Plaintiffs have standing to pursue their claims and \nthat those claims are ripe for judicial review. See City & Cty. of San Francisco v. \nSessions, 349 F. Supp. 3d 924, 966 (N.D. Cal. 2018) (finding that the plaintiffs had \n\"demonstrated Article III standing to challenge the conditions\" and that their claims were \n\"ripe for review\"); State ex rel. Becerra v. Sessions, 284 F. Supp. 3d 1015, 1026-31 (N.D. \nCal. 2018) (finding the same but addressing only the Compliance Condition); City & Cty. of \nSan Francisco v. Sessions, No. 17-cv-04642-WHO, 2018 WL 6267848, at *1 (N.D. Cal. \nMar. 5, 2018) (same); City of Philadelphia v. Sessions, 309 F. Supp. 3d 271, 279-80 (E.D. \nPa. 2018) (addressing ripeness but not expressly reaching the issue of standing); City of \nChicago v. Sessions, 321 F. Supp. 3d 855, 865-66 (N.D. Ill. 2018) (same); cf. also City & \nCty. of San Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1235-38 (9th Cir. 2018) (rejecting the \ndefendants' ripeness and standing arguments in pre-enforcement challenge to an executive \norder which conditioned federal funds on compliance with Section 1373); Cty. of Santa \nClara v. Trump, 275 F. Supp. 3d 1196, 1208-11 (N.D. Cal. 2017) (same); City of Seattle v. \nTrump, No. 17-497-RAJ, 2017 WL 4700144, at *5-7 (W.D. Wash. Oct. 19, 2017) (same). \nWith respect to standing, Plaintiffs identify at least two injuries-in-fact. The first injury is \nfinancial in nature. Defendants continue to withhold the award 958*958 and/or release of \nPlaintiffs' FY 2017 and FY 2018 Byrne JAG funds based on the challenged conditions. \nPlaintiffs have operated without these funds for nearly two years. They are actively faced \nwith the choice of either self-funding their proposed initiatives, forgoing those initiatives, or \n\"chang[ing] their policies.\" City & Cty. of San Francisco, 897 F.3d at 1236. This interruption \nin the flow of promised federal funds is a cognizable injury-in-fact. Organized Vill. of Kake v. \nUnited States Dep't of Agric., 795 F.3d 956, 965 (9th Cir. 2015) (en banc) (\"[A] loss of funds \npromised under federal law ... satisfies Article III's standing requirement.\"); cf. also E. Bay \nSanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 909 F.3d 1219, 1243 (9th Cir. 2018) (holding that \"even a \nsmall reduction\" in government funds to a private organization is a cognizable injury). \nAlthough Defendants contend that Plaintiffs' injuries \"rest[] upon contingent future events\" \nbecause Defendants have yet to withhold or claw back any specific funds, the Ninth Circuit \nhas made clear that standing is available even for states and localities with policies which \n\"arguably would qualify for grant withdrawal\" under contested federal directives. City & Cty. \nof San Francisco, 897 F.3d at 1236. And rightly so: Plaintiffs' funding shortfalls and \nbudgetary uncertainty are neither speculative nor hypothetical; they are real and ongoing \nharms. \nPlaintiffs' second injury stems from infringements upon their sovereign interests.  A state or \n[4]\nlocality has standing to challenge interference with its operational and governance \ndecisions. See, e.g., New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 187-88, 112 S.Ct. 2408, 120 \nL.Ed.2d 120 (1992) (exercising jurisdiction based on sovereign injury from federal \ncommandeering); Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, 458 U.S. 592, 601, 102 S.Ct. \n3260, 73 L.Ed.2d 995 (1982) (noting that states have standing to challenge federal laws \nwhich hinder their \"sovereign power\" to \"create and enforce a legal code\"); see also Bowen \n\n \n \nv. Pub. Agencies Opposed to Soc. Sec. Entrapment, 477 U.S. 41, 50 n.17, 106 S.Ct. 2390, \n91 L.Ed.2d 35 (1986) (finding \"no question\" that a state's sovereignty is \"diminished\" and \nstanding therefore exists when federal law alters the state's ability to \"structure its \nrelationship with its employees\"). The challenged statutes and conditions not only appear to \nconflict with Plaintiffs' laws and policies but aim to force or pressure Plaintiffs to change the \nsame. Plaintiffs, to that end, challenge Defendants' conduct based not on the derivative \ninterests of their citizens or an abstract interest in the rule of law; rather, they bring the \npresent action to vindicate their own sovereign powers and rights as accorded by Congress \nand the Tenth Amendment. Because the challenged statutes and conditions are presently \nundermining Plaintiffs' \"exercise of ... sovereign power to create and enforce a legal code,\" \nas well as interfering with at least one aspect of relations with their employees, Plaintiffs \nhave standing. \nThe same facts support the ripeness of Plaintiffs' claims. As noted above, the instant \ndispute \"presents concrete legal issues\"โnot \"abstractions\"โframed within the context of \nan \"actual case[].\" Colwell v. Dep't of Health & Human Servs., 558 F.3d 1112, 1123 (9th Cir. \n2009) (internal quotation marks and citations 959*959 omitted). Plaintiffs challenge a final \nagency determination that FY 2017 and FY 2018 Byrne JAG funds are subject to the \nchallenged conditions. See City of Chicago, 321 F. Supp. 3d at 865 (\"Chicago ... does not \nchallenge the Attorney general's not-yet-finalized decision whether to award the funds, but \nrather the decision to attach the [c]onditions to the grant in the first instance.\"); City of \nPhiladelphia, 309 F. Supp. 3d at 280 (same). Those conditions, as well as Sections 1373 \nand 1644, are presently causing budgetary shortfalls and actively impinging upon Plaintiffs' \nsovereign prerogatives and federal rights. Plaintiffs must \"choose between accepting the \naward with the [c]onditions or forgoing the award in favor of maintaining [their] policy \npreferences.\" City of Chicago, 321 F. Supp. 3d at 855. The requested relief is directed at \nthese ongoing harms and does not require the Court to speculate as to \"uncertain or \ncontingent future events that may not occur as anticipated.\" The Ninth Circuit easily found \nas much in a case challenging a presidential directive merely threatening to withhold future \nByrne JAG awards. See City & Cty. of San Francisco, 897 F.3d at 1236-39.  \n[5]\nNevertheless, the Court agrees with Defendants that Plaintiffs lack standing to seek an \ninjunction against all future \"conditions relating to federal immigration laws and policy.\" FAC \nat 32. Plaintiffs cannot show any injuries from conditions which do not yet exist. As the \nSupreme Court has made clear, speculation or \"subjective apprehension\" about future harm \nis insufficient to support standing. Friends of the Earth v. Laidlaw Envtl. Serv., Inc., 528 U.S. \n167, 184, 120 S.Ct. 693, 145 L.Ed.2d 610 (2000) (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted). Instead, \"[o]nce a plaintiff has been wronged, he is entitled to [seek] injunctive \nrelief only if he can show that he faces a real or immediate threat that he will again be \nwronged in a similar way.\" Mayfield v. United States, 599 F.3d 964, 970 (9th Cir. \n2010) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also Susan B. Anthony List, 573 \nU.S. at 158, 134 S.Ct. 2334 (\"An allegation of future injury may suffice if ... there is a \nsubstantial risk that the harm will occur.\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). \nPlaintiffs are entitled to seek prospective relief from the existing conditions because their \ninjuries are ongoing and there is a substantial risk that Defendants will continue to renew \nthe same or similar conditions. It is pure speculation, however, that Defendants will impose \n\n \n \ndifferent conditions in the future and that Plaintiffs' laws or policies would conflict with them. \nUntil such conditions are imposed, or at least threatened, Plaintiffs lack standing to seek \ndeclaratory or injunctive relief from the same. \nII. Conditioning of Byrne JAG Funds \nMoving to the merits, Plaintiffs challenge each of the FY 2017 and FY 2018 conditions \nimposed on the receipt of Byrne JAG funds. They argue that Defendants are without \nstatutory or constitutional authority to impose the Notice, Access, and 960*960 Disclosure \nConditions and that Sections 1373 and 1644โthe statutes on which the Compliance \nCondition is basedโviolate the Tenth Amendment and therefore cannot form the basis for \nany funding condition. In assessing Plaintiffs' claims, the Court first addresses the level of \ndeference, if any, owed to Defendants' statutory interpretations under Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. \nv. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). The \nCourt next examines Defendants' claimed statutory authority to impose the Notice, Access, \nand Disclosure Conditions. Since Defendants rely upon different statutory provisions to \njustify their promulgation of the Disclosure Condition and the Notice and Access Conditions, \nthe Court addresses the Disclosure Condition separately. Finally, the Court assesses \nwhether Sections 1373 and 1644 violate the Tenth Amendment and render the Compliance \nCondition invalid.  \n[6]\nA. Deference to Defendants' Statutory Interpretations \nPrior to examining the parties' dueling statutory interpretations, the Court first considers \nwhether Defendants' interpretations are entitled to any level of deference. Typically, a \nreviewing court must give effect to an agency's reasonable interpretation of any statute \nwhich it is tasked with administering. Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842-45, 104 S.Ct. 2778. That \ngeneral rule, however, is subject to an important limitation: an agency's interpretation is \nentitled to no deference if Congress has clearly spoken to the question at issue. Id. at 842, \n104 S.Ct. 2778. Instead, when a statute is unambiguous as to a specific matter, such that \n\"the intent of Congress is clear,\" a court must \"give effect to the unambiguously expressed \nintent of Congress.\" Id. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778. When reviewing an agency's \ninterpretation, a court must therefore first employ the \"traditional tools of statutory \nconstruction\" to determine whether \"Congress had an intention on the precise question at \nissue.\" Id. at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778 n.9. If it did, then \"that is the end of the matter\" and no \ndeference is owed to the agency. Id. at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778. \nInterestingly, Defendants make no attempt to persuade the Court that their interpretations \nare entitled to deference under Chevron. Whether an agency may forfeit Chevron deference \nis the subject of some debate. See generally Note, Waiving Chevron Deference, 132 Harv. \nL. Rev. 1520 (2019). The weight of authority suggests that an agency may forfeit or waive \nits right to any deference available under Chevron. See, e.g., Neustar, Inc. v. FCC, 857 \nF.3d 886, 893-94 (D.C. Cir. 2017); Commodity Futures Trading Comm'n v. Erskine, 512 \nF.3d 309, 314 (6th Cir. 2008); cf. also Humane Soc'y of the U.S. v. Locke, 626 F.3d 1040, \n1054 n.8 (9th Cir. 2010) (assuming without deciding that Chevron deference applied based \n\n \n \non a stipulation of the parties). The Supreme Court has also hinted in dicta \nthat Chevron deference may be waived. See Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 \nU.S. 469, 480, 112 S.Ct. 2589, 120 L.Ed.2d 379 (1992) (\"[I]t would be quite inappropriate to \ndefer to an interpretation which has been abandoned by the policymaking agency \nitself.\"); cf. also United States v. Montero-Camargo, 208 F.3d 1122, 1132 n.17 (9th Cir. \n2000) (explaining that Supreme Court dicta has \"a weight that is greater than ordinary \njudicial dicta\"). \nThe issue is more than academic here. Article I of the Constitution 961*961 \"exclusively \ngrants the power of the purse to Congress.\" City & Cty. of San Francisco, 897 F.3d at \n1231 (citing U.S. Const. art. I, ยง 9, cl. 7; U.S. Const. art. I, ยง 8, cl. 1). That power includes \n\"condition[ing] the receipt of funds, by states and others, on compliance with federal \ndirectives.\" Nevada v. Skinner, 884 F.2d 445, 447 (9th Cir. 1989). As the Ninth Circuit \nrecently reaffirmed, the Executive Branch \"does not have unilateral authority\" to \"thwart \ncongressional will by canceling appropriations passed by Congress.\" City & Cty. of San \nFrancisco, 897 F.3d at 1232 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); Clinton v. City \nof New York, 524 U.S. 417, 438, 118 S.Ct. 2091, 141 L.Ed.2d 393 (1998) (\"[N]o provision in \nthe Constitution ... authorizes the President to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes.\"). To \nthat end, the Executive Branch is without inherent power to \"condition the payment of... \nfederal funds on adherence to its political priorities.\" City of Chicago, 888 F.3d at 283. If the \nExecutive Branch wishes to condition the receipt of federal funds, it may only do so \npursuant to a specific delegation of spending authority by Congress. City & Cty. of San \nFrancisco, 897 F.3d at 1233-34. \nAs a result, much of the present dispute turns upon the interpretation of statutory provisions \nwhich Defendants believe embody broad delegations of spending authority. Although \nseveral other courts have examined the same or similar claims, each has thus far been \nsilent on the issue of deference. The most likely explanation is that the courtsโevery one of \nwhich has rejected the interpretations offered by Defendantsโemployed the \"traditional \ntools of statutory construction\" and determined that Congress had a clear intent not to \ndelegate the condition-making authority claimed by Defendants. Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843 \nn.9, 104 S.Ct. 2778. Indeed, several courts have hinted at this rationale in passing. See, \ne.g., City of Philadelphia v. Attorney Gen. of the United States, 916 F.3d 276, 286 (3d Cir. \n2019) (examining whether any of the statutory language is \"ambiguous\" and concluding that \n\"it is not\"); City & Cty. of San Francisco, 349 F. Supp. 3d at 945 (starting its inquiry with \nwhether \"Congress ha[d] directly spoken to the precise question at issue\" \n(quoting Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842, 104 S.Ct. 2778)); cf. also City of Chicago, 888 F.3d at \n284-85 (holding that the clear \"intent\" of Congress was \"alone sufficient to end the inquiry\"). \nAs discussed below, the Court agrees that Congress was, indeed, clear in its intent to \nwithhold the condition-making authority claimed by Defendants. There is no ambiguity in the \ncontested provisions. It therefore follows that Defendants' interpretations are not entitled to \ndeference under Chevron. \nThe same conclusion follows for a second reason. An agency's interpretation is entitled to \n\"Chevron-style deference\" only if it carries the \"force of law.\" Christensen v. Harris Cty., 529 \nU.S. 576, 587, 120 S.Ct. 1655, 146 L.Ed.2d 621 (2000) (citations omitted). To carry the \n\n \n \nforce of a law, not only must Congress have delegated rulemaking authority to an agency, \nthe agency must have exercised that authority when interpreting an ambiguous \nstatute. United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 226-27, 121 S.Ct. 2164, 150 L.Ed.2d \n292 (2001). An agency interpretation may carry the force of law if it is reached through a \n\"means less formal than `notice and comment' rulemaking,\" Barnhart v. Walton, 535 U.S. \n212, 221, 122 S.Ct. 1265, 152 L.Ed.2d 330 (2002), but such instances are generally limited \nto resolving \"interstitial\" ambiguities and accompanied by a \"thorough[ ]\" explanation, Fox v. \nClinton, 684 F.3d 67, 78 (D.C. Cir. 2012). Here, although the Byrne JAG statute allows the \nAttorney General to \"issue rules,\" Defendants do not suggest that he exercised that \nauthority. The challenged conditions, 962*962 moreover would fundamentally alter the Byrne \nJAG Program and appear only in solicitations, press releases, and award letters which \n\"offer[ ] little more than uncited, conclusory assertions of law.\" Fox, 684 F.3d at 78. Thus, \neven if the contested provisions were ambiguousโwhich they are notโthe agency's \ninterpretations would be entitled to respect only insofar as they have \"the power to \npersuade.\" Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944). \nSince, as discussed below, Defendants' interpretations are unpersuasive and contrary to \nthe clear intent of Congress, they are entitled to no deference.  \n[7]\nB. Statutory Authorization for the Notice and Access \nConditions \nPlaintiffs challenge the Notice and Access Conditions as an unauthorized exercise of the \ncongressional spending power. They argue that, because Congress has never delegated to \nDefendants a broad discretionary authority to condition the receipt of Byrne JAG funds, \nDefendants' efforts to impose the Notice and Access Conditions usurp the powers granted \nto Congress under the Spending Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Defendants respond that \nPlaintiffs' separation of powers concerns are inapposite because Congress has delegated \nto them virtually unbounded authority to condition the award of Byrne JAG funds. That \npower necessarily includes the ability to impose the Notice and Access Conditions. \nDefendants maintain that this delegated authority can be found either in two provisions of \nthe Byrne JAG statute itself, see 34 U.S.C. ยง 10153(a)(4)-(5), or in an external provision \noutlining the duties and functions of the Assistant 963*963 Attorney General for the Office of \nJustice Programs, see 34 U.S.C. ยง 10102(a)(6). \nThe Court agrees with Plaintiffs, as well as every other court to have examined the issue, \nthat Defendants lack the delegated authority to impose the Notice and Access \nConditions. See City of Philadelphia v. Attorney Gen. of the United States, 916 F.3d 276, \n284-91 (3d Cir. 2019) (\"Congress has not empowered the Attorney General to enact the \nChallenged Conditions.\"); City of Chicago v. Sessions, 888 F.3d 272, 283-87 (7th Cir. \n2018) (\"[T]he Attorney General lacked the authority to impose the notice and access \nconditions on receipt of the Byrne JAG grants.\"); City & Cty. of San Francisco, 349 F. Supp. \n3d at 945-49 (finding that the Attorney General is without authority to \"impose the notice \nand access conditions\"); City of Chicago v. Sessions, 321 F. Supp. 3d at 873-74 (\"[N]either \nByrne JAG nor any other statute grants the Attorney General the authority to impose [the] \nconditions ....\"); New York v. United States Dep't of Justice, 343 F. Supp. 3d 213, 227-31 \n\n \n \n(S.D.N.Y. 2018) (holding that 34 U.S.C. ยง 10102(a)(6) \"does not provide authority for \nimposing any of the challenged conditions\"); City of Philadelphia, 309 F. Supp. 3d at 280-\n81 (same); City of Philadelphia v. Sessions, 280 F. Supp. 3d 579, 615-17 (E.D. Pa. \n2017) (same). \nAs an initial matter, the Court notes, and Defendants do not contest, that the Byrne JAG \nProgram is a formula grant program. See 34 U.S.C. ยง 10156 (detailing the Byrne JAG grant-\ndistribution formula); see also City of Chicago, 888 F.3d at 285 (\"[T]he Byrne JAG grant ... \nis a formula grant rather than a discretionary grant.\"); City of Philadelphia, 916 F.3d at \n290 (same); City & Cty. of San Francisco, 349 F. Supp. 3d at 945 (same). This means that \nCongress has already \"determine[d] who the [grant] recipients are and how much money \neach shall receive.\" City of Los Angeles v. McLaughlin, 865 F.2d 1084, 1088 (9th Cir. \n1989). Importantly, formula grants are generally \"not awarded at the discretion of a state or \nfederal agency\" but rather in accordance with the \"statutory formula.\" Id. at 1088; see \nalso City of Chicago, 888 F.3d at 285 (\"[A] formula grant ... is structured so that the funds \nare allocated based on a carefully defined calculation ....\"); City of Philadelphia, 916 F.3d at \n280 (explaining that funds for formula grants are \"distributed among all grantees based on a \nstatutorily fixed formula\"). Although the label Congress has chosen for the Byrne JAG \nProgram is not dispositiveโCongress may still have expressly delegated to Defendants the \npower to condition fundsโit helps to frame and contextualize Defendants' \narguments. See Kenneth J. Allen, Federal Grant Practice ยงยง 16:3 to 16:5 (2019). \nThe text and structure of the Byrne JAG statute, as well as its place within the broader \nstatutory scheme governing Justice System Improvement, make clear that Congress did not \nintend to delegate the authority claimed by Defendants. See Negusie v. Holder, 555 U.S. \n511, 542, 129 S.Ct. 1159, 173 L.Ed.2d 20 (2009) (\"[We] must begin with the plain meaning \nof the statute.\"); K Mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 486 U.S. 281, 291, 108 S.Ct. 1811, 100 \nL.Ed.2d 313 (1988) (\"In ascertaining the plain meaning of [a] statute, the court must look to \nthe particular statutory language at issue, as well as the language and design of the statute \nas a whole.\"). As the Third Circuit recently observed, Defendants only halfheartedly \nadvance the argument that authorization for the Notice and Access Conditions can be found \nin the text of the Byrne JAG statute itself. City of Philadelphia, 916 F.3d at 284. That is \nbecause, on its face, the statute indisputably does not authorize the Attorney General to \nplace conditions on the recipients of 964*964 Byrne JAG funds or withhold funds allocated \nunder the statutory formula. See generally 34 U.S.C. ยงยง 10151-10158; see also City of \nPhiladelphia, 916 F.3d at 284 (\"Such authorization is nowhere to be found in the text of the \nstatute.\"); City of Chicago, 888 F.3d at 284 (\"[No] provision in the Byrne JAG statute \nauthorizes the imposition of the conditions.\"). Defendants do not suggest otherwise. \nDefendants instead contend that, given the lack of an express delegation, Section 10153(a) \nshould be construed as impliedly delegating the claimed authority. Section 10153(a) \nrequires Byrne JAG applications to include both \"[a]n assurance that ... the applicant shall \nmaintain and report such data, records, and information (programmatic and financial) as the \nAttorney General may reasonably require\" and \"[a] certification that ... there has been \nappropriate coordination with affected agencies.\" 34 U.S.C. ยง 10153(a)(4), (5)(C). \nDefendants maintain that the \"reporting\" requirement authorizes the Notice Condition and \n\n \n \nthat the \"coordination\" requirement authorizes the Access Condition. The Court \ndisagrees. See Util. Air Regulatory Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 324, 134 S.Ct. 2427, 189 \nL.Ed.2d 372 (2014) (\"We expect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an \nagency decisions of vast economic and political significance.\" (citation omitted)); United \nStates v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 349, 92 S.Ct. 515, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971) (\"[U]nless \nCongress conveys its purpose clearly, it will not be deemed to have significantly changed \nthe federal-state balance\"); Solid Waste Agency of N. Cook Cty. v. U.S. Army Corps of \nEng'rs, 531 U.S. 159, 174, 121 S.Ct. 675, 148 L.Ed.2d 576 (2001) (same). \nDefendants' interpretation would do violence to the plain meaning of both provisions. By its \nterms, the reporting requirement applies only to \"programmatic and financial\" information. \n34 U.S.C. ยง 10153(a)(4). These are limiting terms which only encompass \"information \nregarding the handling of federal funds and the programs to which those funds are \ndirected.\" City of Philadelphia, 916 F.3d at 285. The provision is not, as Defendants \nsuggest, a general information-sharing requirement and its terms are not broad enough to \ncover information unrelated to programs funded by the grant. Similarly, the coordination \nrequirement only makes sense if it applies to a jurisdiction's coordination with agencies who \nwill participate in a granted-funded program. After all, the provision is part of a grant scheme \nwhich encourages, and sometimes requires, states to pass funds through to local \ngovernments, with whom coordination would be necessary. See, e.g., 34 U.S.C. ยง \n10156(c)(2), (d), (f); see also id. ยง 10153(a)(6)(A) (requiring states to submit a \"Statewide \nplan ... which shall be designed in consultation with local governments\" (emphasis added)). \nThat reading is corroborated by the provision's use of the past tenseโthere must \"ha[ve] \nbeen\" coordination with \"affected agencies,\" not ongoing coordination with federal agencies \non matters unrelated to the use of Byrne JAG funds. Id. ยง 10153(a)(5)(C) (emphasis \nadded). \nThe unbounded authority claimed by Defendants also stands in stark contrast to the narrow \ngrants of ministerial and supervisory authority expressly provided for in the statute. See City \nof Chicago, 888 F.3d at 283-84 (detailing the Attorney General's express grants of authority \nand concluding that none approach the purported authority to \"impose conditions that \nrequire states or local governments to assist in immigration enforcement\"); City of \nPhiladelphia, 916 F.3d at 285 (same). The provisions cited by Defendants, for instance, are \nnested under a principle clause which permits the Attorney General to 965*965 control the \n\"form\" of applications. 34 U.S.C. ยง 10153(a). The neighboring clauses, like the provisions \nrelied upon by Defendants, principally relate to applicants' coordination with localities, 34 \nU.S.C. ยง 10153(a)(2)-(3), (6)(A)-(B), data on applicants' program outcomes, id. ยง \n10153(a)(6)(C)-(E), applicants' compliance with other applicable laws, id. ยง 10153(a)(5)(D), \nand the truthfulness of applicants' representations, id. ยง 10153(a)(5). As a formula-driven \nprogram, these pro forma certification and evaluation requirements are not criteria on which \nthe Attorney General may make sweeping decisions about funding levels. To the contrary, \nthe Attorney General is only authorized to issue awards \"in accordance with the \nformula established under section 10156 of this title.\" Id. ยง 10152(a)(1) (emphasis added). \nThe instances where the Attorney General may depart from that presumption and \"withhold \nor re-allocate\" funds were carefully delineated by Congress. City of Philadelphia, 916 F.3d \n\n \n \nat 287. The Attorney General may, for example, re-allocate funds to \"address ... precipitous \nor extraordinary increases in crime\" or \"mitigate significant programmatic harm resulting \nfrom operation of the formula.\" 34 U.S.C. ยง 10157(b). This discretion is extremely limited: \nany re-allocation is not to exceed \"5 percent\" of the \"total amount made available\" by \nCongress. Id. Similarly, the Attorney General may withhold up to four percent of a grantee's \nByrne JAG funds for failing to participate in the National Instant Criminal Background Check \nSystem, see id. ยง 40914(b)(1), or \"not more than ... 10-percent\" of those funds for failing to \nreport the number of persons who die in state and local custody, id. ยง 60105(c)(2). As the \nThird Circuit noted, \"[a]ll other delegations of this sort are similarly circumscribed.\" City of \nPhiladelphia, 916 F.3d at 286 (citing 34 U.S.C. ยง 20927(a) (mandating ten-percent penalty \nfor a grantee's failure to comply with the Sex Offender Registration and Notification \nAct); id. ยง 30307(e)(2) (mandating five-percent penalty for a grantee's failure to comply with \nthe Prison Rape Elimination Act)). \nThe apparent reluctance of Congress to delegate greater discretion makes sense given the \ndetailed formula it provided. See 34 U.S.C. ยง 10156. It would be \"anomalous\" for Congress \nto have painstakingly detailed the funding scheme for Byrne JAG grants, narrowly defined \nthe role and authority of the Attorney General, and then delegated by implication an \nunbounded authority which would trump all of the other provisions. Gonzales v. \nOregon, 546 U.S. 243, 262, 126 S.Ct. 904, 163 L.Ed.2d 748 (2006) (\"It would be anomalous \nfor Congress to have so painstakingly described the Attorney General's limited authority..., \nbut to have given him, just by implication, [an even broader] authority.\"); see also Jama v. \nImmigration & Customs Enforcement, 543 U.S. 335, 341, 125 S.Ct. 694, 160 L.Ed.2d 708 \n(2005) (\"We do not lightly assume that Congress has omitted from its adopted text \nrequirements that it nonetheless intends to apply, and our reluctance is even greater when \nCongress has shown elsewhere in the same statute that it knows how to make such a \nrequirement manifest.\"); City of Philadelphia, 916 F.3d at 286 (\"If Congress had already \ngiven the Attorney General this sweeping authority to withhold all funds for any reason, it \nwould have no need to delineate numerous, specific circumstances under which [he or she] \nmay withhold limited amounts of funds.\"). \nPerhaps recognizing the shortcomings of their Section 10153 argument, Defendants direct \nthe Court to Section 10102โa provision outside of the Byrne JAG statute. Section 10102, \nlocated in a separate subchapter, 34 U.S.C. ยงยง 10101-10111, lays out the \"Duties and \nFunctions\" of the Assistant 966*966 Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs. As \nrelevant here, Section 10102 provides that the Assistant Attorney General \"shall ... exercise \nsuch powers and functions as may be vested in the Assistant Attorney General pursuant to \nthis chapter or by delegation of the Attorney General, including placing special conditions on \nall grants, and determining priority purposes for formula grants.\" 34 U.S.C. ยง 10102(a) \n(emphasis added). Defendants contend that the italicized language is a stand-alone \ndelegation of authority which allows the Assistant Attorney General to impose virtually any \ncondition on Byrne JAG funds. \nDefendants' interpretation of the provision is once again at odds with the plain meaning of \nits text. The syntax of the textโnamely its use of a subordinate clause preceded by the \nword \"including\"โis dispositive. \"In both legal and common usage, the word `including' is \n\n \n \nordinarily defined as a term of illustration, signifying that what follows is an example of \npreceding principle.\" Arizona State Bd. for Charter Schools v. United States Dept. of \nEduc., 464 F.3d 1003, 1008 (9th Cir. 2006) (citations omitted). Here, the independent \nclause modified by \"including\" lists the two sources from which the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral \"shall\" derive his or her power: authorities expressly described elsewhere in the \nchapter and delegations from the Attorney General. See 34 U.S.C. ยง 10102(a)(6). This \nmeans that the Assistant Attorney General \"has the power to place special conditions on \ngrants only to the extent such power has been vested in him or her\" elsewhere in the \nchapter or by delegation of the Attorney General. City of Philadelphia, 916 F.3d at 287. \nBecause the Court already determined that the authority claimed by Defendants is not \nincluded as part of either the Byrne JAG statute or any other part of the United States Code, \nDefendants' position is \"untenable.\" City of Chicago, 888 F.3d at 285. \nTwo additional aspects of the provision's text and structure evidence that Congress never \nintended Section 10102 to be a carte blanche delegation of authority. First, as several \ncourts have noted, \"special conditions\" is a term of art referring to high-risk grantees. See, \ne.g., City of Philadelphia, 280 F. Supp. 3d at 617; see also Kenneth J. Allen, Federal Grant \nPractice ยงยง 25:1 to 25:13 (2019). Indeed, when Congress enacted the current version of \nSection 10102(a)(6), the Department of Justice's own regulations described \"special \nconditions\" as those intended for \"high-risk grantees\" who might struggle to meet existing \ngrant requirements. 28 C.F.R. ยง 66.12(a) (2006). Defendants therefore ask too much of the \n\"special conditions\" language. Second, moving to the structure of the provision, each of the \nfive subsections preceding Section 10102(a)(6) deals exclusively with the Assistant \nAttorney General's reporting and coordination duties. See 34 U.S.C. ยง 10102(a)(1)-(5). \"The \nprinciple of noscitur a sociisโ`a word is known by the company it keeps'โis helpful \nhere.\" City of Philadelphia, 916 F.3d at 288 (citing Yates v. United States, 574 U.S. 528, \n135 S. Ct. 1074, 1085, 191 L.Ed.2d 64 (2015)). A final catch-all provision in a list of \nministerial powers would be a strange place indeed for Congress to hide the broad authority \nclaimed by Defendants. Congress, as the Supreme Court has made clear, \"does not alter \nthe fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague or ancillary provisionsโit does not, \none might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.\" Whitman v. Am. Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 \nU.S. 457, 468, 121 S.Ct. 903, 149 L.Ed.2d 1 (2001). \nDefendants nevertheless argue that the Court's reading would render the \"special \nconditions\" and \"priority purposes\" language surplusage. They maintain that, because the \nlanguage was added to the first 967*967 clause as part of an amendment, Congress must \nhave intended to confer \"distinctive and meaningful power.\" The Court disagrees. Although \nthe clause does little work, it still functions as an exemplification of the types of power the \nAssistant Attorney General may possess by delegationโpotentially useful given the breadth \nof justice improvement programs over which the Attorney General has authority. See 34 \nU.S.C. ยงยง 10101-10726. More to the point, Defendants' suggested reading would render \nentire swaths of the Byrne JAG statuteโthe actual statute at issue hereโunnecessary \nsurplusage. See Marx v. Gen. Revenue Corp., 568 U.S. 371, 133 S. Ct. 1166, 1178, 185 \nL.Ed.2d 242 (2013) (\"The canon against surplusage is strongest when an interpretation \nwould render superfluous another part of the same statutory scheme.\"). As discussed \nabove, \"[i]f Congress had already given the Attorney General th[e] sweeping authority to \n\n \n \nwithhold all funds for any reasons, it would have no need to delineate numerous, specific \ncircumstances under which the Attorney General may withhold limited amounts of \nfunds.\" City of Philadelphia, 916 F.3d at 286. \nLastly, Congress knew how to provide for condition-making authority over grant funds and \ndid so in a neighboring subchapter. See 34 U.S.C. ยง 10446(e)(3) (\"In disbursing grants [to \ncombat violence against women] under this subchapter, the Attorney General may impose \nreasonable conditions on grant awards ....\"). It also knew how to create discretionary and \ncompetitive grant programs and, once again, did so in neighboring parts and \nsubchapters. See, e.g., id. ยงยง 10171-10191 (establishing \"discretionary grant[ ]\" programs \nfor the Bureau of Justice Assistance); id. ยงยง 10381-10389 (establishing a competitive grant \nprogram for community policing funds). It would defy reason for the Court to find that the \nByrne JAG statute does implicitly what other analogous statutes do explicitly. That \nconclusion is further supported by the fact that, on at least two occasions, Congress has \nrejected legislation which would have imposed immigration-related conditions on Byrne JAG \nfunds. See Stop Sanctuary Cities Act, S. 1814, 114th Cong. ยง 2(b)(2) (2015); Enforce the \nLaw for Sanctuary Cities Act, H.R. 3009, 114th Cong. ยง 3(b) (2015). Although the Ninth \nCircuit generally cautions against relying upon failed legislation, FTC v. AT & T Mobility \nLLC, 883 F.3d 848, 857 (2018), it recently found such evidence persuasive in the context of \nanother conditional-funding dispute, see City & Cty. of San Francisco, 897 F.3d at 1234.  \n[8]\nIn sum, the Court finds that Defendants are without the delegated authority to impose the \nNotice and Access Conditions and that, by doing so, Defendants infringed upon the \nauthority reserved to Congress under the Spending Clause of the U.S. Constitution. \nC. Statutory Authorization for the Disclosure \nCondition \nPlaintiffs likewise challenge the Disclosure Condition as an unauthorized exercise 968*968 of \nthe congressional spending authority. Their argument is substantially the same as that \nraised with respect to the Notice and Access Conditions. In response, Defendants reassert \ntheir view that Section 10102(a)(6) includes a delegation of virtually unchecked condition-\nmaking authority over Byrne JAG funds. That argument is foreclosed by the Court's prior \nanalysis. Defendants, however, point to an additional statutory provision as delegating the \nnecessary authority to impose the Disclosure Condition. That provision, 34 U.S.C. ยง \n10102(a)(2), warrants separate attention. Defendants also raise a distinct procedural \nargument: that Plaintiffs failed to challenge the Disclosure Condition in their FAC and thus \ncannot raise it on summary judgment. Specifically, they argue that Plaintiffs made only \n\"passing references\" to the Disclosure Condition and omitted any mention of the \nsubstantive basis for their challenge in the three \"claims for relief.\" \nWith respect to the procedural issue, Defendants' argument misconstrues contemporary \npleading standards. The \"[f]ederal pleading rules call for a `short and plain statement of the \nclaim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief'; they do not countenance dismissal of a \ncomplaint for imperfect statement of the legal theory supporting the claim \n\n \n \nasserted.\" Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10, 135 S. Ct. 346, 346, 190 L.Ed.2d 309 \n(2014) (emphasis added) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Indeed, contrary to Defendants' \nimplicit suggestion, notice pleading does not require a plaintiff to set forth \"causes of action, \nstatutes, or legal theories.\" Alvarez v. Hill, 518 F.3d 1152, 1157 (9th Cir. 2008). Plaintiffs in \nthe present case alleged adequate facts to put Defendants on notice that they intended to \nchallenge the Disclosure Condition as one of several unauthorized funding \nrequirements. See FAC ยถยถ 75-79. To that end, they specifically outlined the terms of the \nDisclosure Condition and asked that the Court \"[e]njoin Defendants\" from conditioning \nByrne JAG funds on compliance with \"any ... conditions relating to federal immigration laws \nor policy.\" FAC at 32 (emphasis added). That request, at the very least, encompassed all \nextant conditions named in the FAC. Defendants do not contend that Plaintiffs have failed to \nput forward evidence in support of their allegations or that the issues on summary judgment \ngo beyond pure disputes of law.  \n[9]\nDefendants' substantive arguments fare no better. Section 10102(a)(2), 969*969 which \nneighbors the already-discussed Section 10102(a)(6), provides that the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral \"shall ... maintain liaison with the executive and judicial branches of the Federal \nand State governments in matters relating to criminal justice.\" 8 U.S.C. ยง 10102(a)(2). \nDefendantsโnow scraping the bottom of the proverbial barrelโargue that, because the \nAssistant Attorney General's duty to \"maintain liaison\" would require him to form a \"close \nconnection\" with state officials, that same duty necessarily includes the power to wholly \ncondition Byrne JAG funds on the confidentiality of shared information because doing so \nensures that everyone can work \"safely and effectively together.\" In other words, \nDefendants believe that completely withholding funds from grantees who do not promise to \nprotect immigration-related information is an implicit corollary to the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral's undefined duty to ensure that everyone works well together. \nThere are several problems with that interpretation. The first is that it is unsupported by the \ntext of the provision itself. Defendants hang their hat entirely on the dictionary definition of \n\"liaison.\" See Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (10th ed. 1998) (defining \"liaison\" as \na \"close bond or connection\" or \"a person who establishes and maintains communication \nfor mutual understanding and cooperation\"). There is, however, no portion of that definition \nwhich even hints at a punitive aspect to the act of liaising, let alone a discretionary authority \nto completely dissolve relations when one side does not abide by the wishes of the other. In \nfact, based on the definition offered by Defendants, that would seem to be antithetical to the \nrelation-building function of a liaison. The remainder of the text is also silent as to any \nspecific powers the Assistant Attorney General might wield in carrying out his liaison duties \nand Defendants cite no authority to suggest that \"liaison[s]\" are generally understood to \nhave implied powers. In the end, Defendants once again ask too much of a pedestrian \nfragment of textโthere is simply no portion of Section 10102(a)(2) which explicitly or \nimplicitly provides the claimed authority.  \n[10]\nThe structure of Section 10102 also weighs against Defendants' interpretation. As already \ndiscussed, each of the other provisions in Section 10102 deal exclusively with the Assistant \nAttorney General's reporting and coordination duties. See 34 U.S.C. ยง 10102(a)-(b); see \nalso City of Chicago, 888 F.3d at 285 (characterizing Section 101012 in the same way); City \n\n \n \nof Philadelphia, 916 F.3d at 288 (same). These are glorified ministerial responsibilities. The \nchallenged condition, by contrast, requires Plaintiffs to guard against all disclosures which \ncould \"indirect[ly]\" impact immigration enforcement and makes the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral \"the sole arbiter\" of whether conduct violates that requirement. City & Cty. of San \nFrancisco v. Sessions, 372 F. Supp. 3d 928, 944 (N.D. Cal. 2019) (emphasis added). That \ntype of authority is neither contemplated by the text nor implied by the structure of Section \n10102. Indeed, Section 10102(a)(2)โan otherwise unremarkable provision nested within a \nlarger list of mundane responsibilitiesโwould 970*970 again be an odd location for \nCongress to house such an authority. See Yates, 135 S. Ct. at 1085 (holding that courts \nshould \"avoid ascribing to one word a meaning so broad that it is inconsistent with its \naccompanying words\" (citation omitted)); see also Whitman, 531 U.S. at 468, 121 S.Ct. \n903 (\"Congress does not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague or \nancillary provisions....\"). \nFinally, the condition-making power claimed by Defendants is at odds with the Byrne JAG \nstatute and its relation to other portions of the chapter. As already discussed, instances \nwhen the Attorney General may \"withhold or re-allocate\" Byrne JAG funds were carefully \ndelineated by Congress. City of Philadelphia, 916 F.3d at 287. When Congress wanted \ngrantees to engage in or refrain from certain types of conductโeven information sharingโit \nprovided for specific and measured penalties. See, e.g., 34 U.S.C. ยง 40914(b)(1) (imposing \nup to a four-percent penalty if a grantee abstains from the National Instant Criminal \nBackground Check System); id. ยง 60105(c)(2) (imposing up to a ten-percent penalty if a \ngrantee fails to report the number of persons who die in state and local custody). If \nCongress had shared the same concerns about grantees disclosing immigration-related \ninformation, it could have enacted analogous penalties. But it did not. See also 34 U.S.C. ยง \n10228(a) (\"Nothing in this chapter ... shall be construed to authorize any ... employee of the \nUnited States to exercise any direction, supervision, or control over any police force or ... \ncriminal justice agency of any State or any political subdivision thereof.\"). \nAs with the Notice and Access Conditions, the Court finds that Defendants are without the \ndelegated authority to impose the Disclosure Condition and that, by doing so, they infringed \nupon the authority reserved to Congress under the Spending Clause of the U.S. \nConstitution. \nD. Tenth Amendment and the Compliance Condition \nFinally, Plaintiffs challenge two federal statutes, 8 U.S.C. ยงยง 1373 and 1644, pursuant to the \nTenth Amendment. Plaintiffs argue that, because Congress directly restricted the legislative \nfreedom of their respective policymaking bodies, both provisions are facially invalid under \nthe anti-commandeering doctrine. The result, they contend, is that Defendants lack the \nstatutory authority to impose the Compliance Condition because, even if Defendants could \ncondition funds on compliance with \"other applicable Federal laws,\" 34 U.S.C. ยง 10105(6), \nunconstitutional laws cannot be \"applicable\" laws. Defendants respond that the anti-\ncommandeering doctrine does not apply to voluntary grant programs like the one at issue \nhere. In the alternative, they argue that Sections 1373 and 1644 are constitutional because \n\n \n \nthey are laws of general applicability (i.e., they evenhandedly regulate both states and \nprivate parties) and, even if they were not, because they fall within a purported information-\ngathering exception to the anti-commandeering doctrine.  \n[11]\n971*971 The Tenth Amendment provides that \"[t]he powers not delegated to the United \nStates by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States \nrespectively, or to the people.\" U.S. Const. amend. X. This \"truism,\" United States v. \nDarby, 312 U.S. 100, 124, 61 S.Ct. 451, 85 L.Ed. 609 (1941), merely confirms that the \nenumerated powers of Congress are not without limits and that \"all other legislative power is \nreserved for the States,\" Murphy v. NCAA, ___ U.S. ___, 138 S. Ct. 1461, 1476, 200 \nL.Ed.2d 854 (2018). A corollary to this confirmation of \"dual sovereignty,\" Printz v. United \nStates, 521 U.S. 898, 919, 117 S.Ct. 2365, 138 L.Ed.2d 914 (1997), is the anti-\ncommandeering doctrineโthe principle that Congress may not \"require the States to \ngovern according to [its] instructions,\" New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 162, 112 \nS.Ct. 2408, 120 L.Ed.2d 120 (1992). The doctrine \"represents the recognition\" that \nCongress lacks \"the power to issue direct orders to governments of the \nStates.\" Murphy, 138 S. Ct. at 1476. As the Supreme Court recently confirmed, the anti-\ncommandeering doctrine applies with equal force to federal statutes which tell states to \n\"enact\" certain types of laws and federal statutes which tell states to \"refrain\" from enacting \ncertain types of laws. Id. at 1478 (emphasis added). \nHere, the Court agrees with Plaintiffs, as well as every other court to have considered the \nissue after Murphy, that Sections 1373 and 1644 violate the Tenth Amendment. See City & \nCty. of San Francisco, 349 F. Supp. 3d at 949-53 (\"I find that Section 1373 is \nunconstitutional.\"); City of Chicago, 321 F. Supp. 3d at 866-73 (\"Section 1373 is \nunconstitutional and cannot stand.\"); New York, 343 F. Supp. 3d at 232-38 (\"[Section] 1373[ \n], in so far as it applies to states and localities, is facially unconstitutional under the \nanticommandeering doctrine of the Tenth Amendment.\"); see also City of Philadelphia, 309 \nF. Supp. 3d at 286-88 (denying the defendants' motion to dismiss an as-applied Tenth \nAmendment challenge to Section 1373); City of Philadelphia, 280 F. Supp. 3d at \n651 (declining to base a preliminary injunction on the Tenth Amendment, but observing \n\"that the effect of Section 1373 compliance may be to thwart policymakers' ability to \nextricate their state or municipality from involvement in a federal program\" (citation \nomitted)). \nAs an initial matter, the voluntary nature of the Byrne JAG Program cannot save Sections \n1373 and 1644 from Tenth Amendment scrutiny. Defendants are correct to note that the \nSpending Clause allows Congress and, when authorized, the Executive Branch to impose \nconditions on the receipt of federal funds. Nat'l Fed'n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. \n519, 576, 132 S.Ct. 2566, 183 L.Ed.2d 450 (2012). That authority permits the federal \ngovernment to reward states and localities who decide to voluntarily act or refrain from \nacting in ways which the government could not directly compel. Id. Although Defendants \nargue that they are merely asking Plaintiffs to accept conditions which mirror the terms of \nSections 1373 and 1644, they are in fact asking Plaintiffs to directly comply with those \nstatutes because any authority to condition Byrne JAG funds is limited to enforcing other \n\"applicable\" laws. See 34 U.S.C. ยง 10153(a)(5)(D). In turn, Plaintiffs challenge Sections \n\n \n \n1373 and 1644 to both show that the provisions cannot be \"applicable\" laws under the \nByrne JAG statute and, separately, to halt the provisions' continued 972*972 intrusion upon \ntheir sovereign powers. Indeed, both statutes \"are extant federal law[s]\" with which Plaintiffs \n\"must comply, completely irrespective of whether or not [they] accept[ ] Byrne JAG \nfunding.\" City of Chicago, 321 F. Supp. 3d at 867. The statutes therefore cannot escape \nscrutiny under the anti-commandeering doctrine. \nSections 1373 and 1644, in turn, fail under a straightforward application of anti-\ncommandeering principles. As discussed above, both provisions provide that states and \nlocalities \"may not\" enact rules which \"in any way restrict[]\" their officials from sharing a \nperson's citizenship or immigration status with federal authorities. 8 U.S.C. ยงยง 1373(a)-(b), \n1644. In doing so, Sections 1373 and 1644 \"issue direct orders to state \nlegislatures.\" Murphy, 138 S. Ct. at 1478. That is, each provision \"dictates what a state \nlegislature may and may not do.\" Id. Although Defendants suggest that the provisions \nshould survive constitutional scrutiny because they direct Plaintiffs to \"refrain from enacting\" \ncertain types of legislation, the Supreme Court has made clear that any distinction between \naction and inaction is \"empty\" and fails to recognize that the same \"basic principle ... applies \nin either event.\" Id. (emphasis added). Because Sections 1373 and 1644 \"require the states \nto govern according to [the] instructions\" of Congress, it necessarily follows that they violate \nthe Tenth Amendment. New York, 505 U.S. at 162, 112 S.Ct. 2408. \nDefendants attempt to avoid that conclusion by characterizing Sections 1373 and 1644 as \n\"valid preemption provision[s],\" but they are \"no such thing.\" Murphy, 138 S. Ct. at 1479. \nUnder the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, \"federal law is supreme in the case \nof conflict with state law.\" Id. That \"rule of decision,\" however, only holds true if the federal \nprovision at issue \"imposes restrictions or confers rights on private actors.\" Id. at 1479-80 \n(emphasis added) (citation omitted). Although some valid preemption provisions may be \nphrased as limitations on the enactment of state and local legislation, a preemption \nprovision may never \"operate directly on the States.\" Id. Instead, the essential characteristic \nof a valid preemption provisionโ\"regardless of the language sometimes used by \nCongress\"โis always that it \"regulates the conduct of private actors, not the States.\" Id. at \n1480-81. Here, Sections 1373 and 1644 are not only drafted as directives to states and \nlocalities, they also \"operate\" as tools of federal control over state and local legislative \nbodies. Id. In particular, the provisions create no rights or restrictions applicable \nto private actors; rather, by their terms, Sections 1373 and 1644 affect only state and local \ngovernment \"entit[ies]\" and \"official[s].\" 8 U.S.C. ยงยง 1373, 1644. \"Thus, there is simply no \nway to understand the provision[s] ... as anything other than ... direct command[s] to the \nStates.\" Murphy, 138 S. Ct. at 1481. \nDefendants attempt to distinguish the present case by arguing that Plaintiffs are actively \nthwarting the enforcement of federal immigration laws. That argument \"is a red \nherring.\" City of Chicago, 888 F.3d at 282. \"[N]othing in this case involves any \naffirmative interference with federal law enforcement at all, nor is there any interference \nwhatsoever with federal immigration authorities.\" Id. (emphasis in original). Instead, \"[t]he \nonly conduct at issue here is the refusal of local law enforcement to aid in civil immigration \nenforcement.\" Id. Although a state or locality's decision to refrain from assisting in federal \n\n \n \nenforcement may frustrate the efforts of immigration authorities, \"[s]tanding aside does not \nequate to standing in the way.\" United States v. California, 314 F. Supp. 3d 1077, 1105 \n(E.D. Cal. 2018). States and localities have \"the right, pursuant to the anticommandeering \nrule, to 973*973 refrain from assisting with federal [enforcement] efforts.\" United States v. \nCalifornia, 921 F.3d 865, 891 (9th Cir. 2019). It makes no difference, as Defendants \nmaintain, that Sections 1373 and 1644 pertain to restrictions a state or local government \nmay affirmatively place on its officials. A government may only operate through its officials \nand any statute permitting federal intervention into a state or local government's control \nover its officials would obliterate the ability of state and local governments to abstain from \nfederal programs. That is precisely the type of affront to state sovereignty which the Tenth \nAmendment forbids. \nFinally, Defendants argue that Sections 1373 and 1644 fall within an information-sharing \ncarveout to the anti-commandeering doctrine. But there is no such carveout. The authority \nrelied upon by Defendants is based entirely on dicta from Printz and does not encompass \nthe type of statute at issue here. See Printz, 521 U.S. at 917-18, 117 S.Ct. 2365 (noting that \nsome federal laws \"require only the provision of information,\" but emphasizing that they \"are \nnot before us\"). Unlike the statutes described in Printz, Sections 1373 and 1644 are \"more \nthan just ... information-sharing provision[s],\" New York, 343 F. Supp. 3d at 236, which \nrequire local officials to engage in \"purely ministerial reporting,\" Printz, 521 U.S. at 936, 117 \nS.Ct. 2365 (O'Connor, J., concurring). They instead \"prevent state and local policymakers \nfrom enacting a wide range of information-governance rules,\" New York, 343 F. Supp. 3d at \n236, and force them \"to stand aside and allow the federal government to conscript the time \nand cooperation of local employees,\" City of Chicago, 321 F. Supp. 3d at 873. As the \nSupreme Court emphasized in Murphy, the anti-commandeering doctrine applies \"not only \nto state officers with policymaking responsibility but also to those assigned more mundane \ntasks.\" 138 S. Ct. at 1477. Sections 1373 and 1644 therefore violate the Tenth Amendment. \nAs unconstitutional laws, Sections 1373 and 1644 \"automatically drop[ ]\" from the pool of \n\"applicable\" laws on which funding conditions may be based. City of Chicago, 321 F. Supp. \n3d at 875; cf. also Branch v. Smith, 538 U.S. 254, 281-81, 123 S.Ct. 1429, 155 L.Ed.2d 407 \n(2003) (finding that the phrase \"as state law requires\" does not include unconstitutional \nstate laws because such laws are a \"legal nullity\"). This means that the Compliance \nCondition fails for the same reason as the Notice, Access, and Disclosure Conditions; its \npromulgation is an unauthorized exercise of the congressional spending power. See City of \nChicago, 321 F. Supp. 3d at 876 (explaining that the Compliance Condition \"does not fail\" \nbecause it violates the anti-commandeering doctrine; rather, it fails \"because the authority \non which it depends... has been stripped away\"). Defendants, moreover, cannot remedy this \ninfirmity simply by transferring the substance of Sections 1373 and 1644 into stand-alone \nfunding conditions because, as discussed above, there are presently no open-ended \ndelegations of spending authority which could independently support such conditions. Thus, \nnot only are both provisions facially unconstitutional and unenforceable against Plaintiffs, \nthe Compliance Condition itself is invalid under separation of powers principles.  \n[12]\n III. Appropriate Relief \n974*974\n\n \n \nPlaintiffs seek declaratory, injunctive, and mandamus relief. Defendants contest only the \nnationwide scope of the requested injunction and the propriety of mandamus relief. They do \nnot object to Plaintiffs' request for a declaration as it relates to the FY 2017 and FY 2018 \nconditions. As such, Plaintiffs may rely upon the Court's analysis in Part II as satisfaction of \nits request for a declaration or, in the alternative, include a more concise restatement of the \nCourt's conclusions in a proposed form of order. The parties' remaining arguments are \naddressed below. \nA. Permanent Injunction \nPlaintiffs argue that they are entitled to a permanent injunction with nationwide effect. \nDefendants do not contest that Plaintiffs are entitled to permanent injunctive relief but argue \nthat any such relief should be limited to the parties in the case. A plaintiff seeking a \npermanent injunction must show: \"(1) that it has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that \nremedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for \nthat injury; (3) that, considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and \ndefendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest would not be \ndisserved by a permanent injunction.\" Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms, 561 U.S. \n139, 156, 130 S.Ct. 2743, 177 L.Ed.2d 461 (2010). Plaintiffs satisfy each element. \nAs to the first two elements, Plaintiffs have demonstrated irreparable constitutional injuries \nwhich cannot adequately be remedied with monetary damages. See Nelson v. NASA, 530 \nF.3d 865, 882 (9th Cir. 2008) (\"Unlike monetary injuries, constitutional violations cannot be \nadequately remedied through damages and therefore generally constitute irreparable \nharm.\"), rev'd on other grounds, 562 U.S. 134, 131 S.Ct. 746, 178 L.Ed.2d 667 \n(2011); Monterey Mech. Co. v. Wilson, 125 F.3d 702, 715 (9th Cir. 1997) (\"We have stated \nthat an alleged constitutional infringement will often alone constitute irreparable harm.\" \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). In the absence of an injunction, Plaintiffs \nwould not only face the continued operation of unconstitutional statutes and funding \nconditions, they would be forced to either change their policies, forgo critical law \nenforcement funds, or risk federal sanctions. See, e.g., City of Philadelphia v. Sessions, 309 \nF. Supp. 3d 289, 340-41 (E.D.Pa. 2018) (discussing irreparable harm). Plaintiffs would, \nunder any of these circumstances, risk public safety by eroding trust with immigrant \ncommunities or abandoning critical law enforcement initiatives funded by the Byrne JAG \nProgram. See, e.g., City of Chicago, 321 F. Supp. 3d at 877-78 (\"Trust once lost is not \neasily restored, and as such, is an irreparable harm for which there is no adequate remedy \nat law.\"). \nAs to the third element, Defendants do \"not even attempt[ ] to argue that 975*975 the \ninjunction causes [them] any burden at all.\" City & Cty. of San Francisco, 897 F.3d at 1244. \nIndeed, unlike the Hobson's choice faced by Plaintiffs, Defendants are free to continue \nenforcing federal immigration laws and must \"simply pay money that Congress has already \nappropriated.\" City of Philadelphia, 309 F. Supp. 3d at 341. Finally, as the to the fourth \nelement, an injunction would serve the public interest by thwarting Defendants' \nencroachment upon powers constitutionally reserved to Congress and the states. See New \n\n \n \nYork, 343 F. Supp. 3d at 244; see also Gordon v. Holder, 721 F.3d 638, 653 (D.C. Cir. \n2013) (\"[E]nforcement of an unconstitutional law is always contrary to the public interest.\"). \nAn injunction would also \"bring[ ] clarity to all parties and to citizens dependent on public \nservices,\" a result which \"cannot\" disserve the public interest. City & Cty. of San \nFrancisco, 349 F. Supp. 3d at 970; see also City of Philadelphia, 309 F. Supp. 3d at 341-\n42 (finding that the public interest is \"better served\" if grantees are not forced to choose \nbetween Byrne JAG funding and \"losing hard-fought goodwill amongst the immigrant \ncommunity\" (citation omitted)). Plaintiffs and their political subdivisions are therefore entitled \nto a permanent injunction against the challenged statutes and funding conditions.  \n[13]\nThat injunction, however, must be limited to Plaintiffs and their political subdivisions. It is \nhornbook law that \"injunctive relief should be no more burdensome to the defendant than \nnecessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.\" Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, \n702, 99 S.Ct. 2545, 61 L.Ed.2d 176 (1979). \"Where relief can be structured on an individual \nbasis, it must be narrowly tailored to remedy the specific harm shown.\" City & Cty. of San \nFrancisco, 897 F.3d at 1244 (citation omitted). Here, Plaintiffs will receive complete relief \nfrom an injunction limited to the boundaries of this District. As already discussed at length, \nthe award and size of Byrne JAG grants is non-discretionary and based on a detailed \nformula. See 34 U.S.C. ยง 10156. Plaintiffs are at no disadvantage if other jurisdictions \nconsent to the challenged conditions; to the contrary, the value of their grants may actually \nincrease if other states refuse funds. Id. ยง 10156(f). There is simply no evidence linking \nPlaintiffs' injuries to the nationwide operation of the offending statutes and \nconditions.[14] See City & Cty. of San Francisco, 897 F.3d at 1244. As such, 976*976 based \non the record presently before it, the Court finds that a nationwide injunction is unnecessary \nto remedy Plaintiffs' specific harms and accord them complete relief. See New York, 343 F. \nSupp. 3d at 245. \nB. Writ of Mandamus \nFinally, Plaintiffs argue that they are entitled to a writ of mandamus compelling Defendants \nto disburse their Byrne JAG funds without the challenged conditions. In response, \nDefendants contend that mandamus relief would be inappropriate because ordering the \ndisbursement of funds would interfere with their lawful discretion under the Byrne JAG \nstatute and because Plaintiffs' injuries are adequately remedied by the permanent \ninjunction. A federal court may \"compel an officer or employee of the United States or any \nagency therefor to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.\" 28 U.S.C. ยง 1361. This is an \n\"extraordinary remedy\" and only available if: \"(1) the individual's claim is clear and certain; \n(2) the official's duty is nondiscretionary, ministerial, and so plainly described as to be free \nfrom doubt[;] and (3) no other adequate remedy is available.\" Kildare v. Saenz, 325 F.3d \n1078, 1084 (9th Cir. 2003). Plaintiffs satisfy each element. \nFirst, Plaintiffs' claims are clear and certain. Sections 1373 and 1644 plainly violate the \nTenth Amendment and there is no colorable argument that Defendants have the delegated \nauthority to impose the challenged conditions. Second, as previously described at length, \nthe award and size of Byrne JAG grants is nondiscretionary. Although the Attorney General \n\n \n \nis empowered to dictate the \"form\" of an application and enforce the Byrne JAG statutes \nunambiguous reporting, coordination, and programmatic requirements, see 34 U.S.C. ยงยง \n10153-10154, he may not withhold funds if an applicant or grantee satisfies those objective \ncriteria. There is, moreover, no evidence to suggest that Plaintiffs fail to meet any of the \ncriteria. Finally, no other adequate remedy is available to Plaintiffs. See In re A Community \nVoice, 878 F.3d 779, 786 (9th Cir. 2017) (citation omitted). Defendants maintain that there \nis no deadline by which they must award and disburse Byrne JAG funds. On that view, they \nare under no obligation to award or disburse Plaintiffs' funds even if Plaintiffs otherwise \nsatisfy the statutory criteria. Defendants may simply sit on the funds without taking any final \naction. An injunction barring reliance on the challenged conditions would not protect against \nsuch conduct. And yet, as described in Part I, Plaintiffs' budgetary and programmatic \ninjuries grow with each passing day. Plaintiffs are therefore entitled to a writ of mandamus \ncompelling distribution of their FY 2017 and FY 2018 funds. \nCONCLUSION \nBased on the foregoing, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 14, is DENIED and \nPlaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 21, is GRANTED in part. Within 14 days, \nthe parties shall confer on a proposed form of judgment and a proposed form of order with \nspecific language for a permanent injunction, writ of mandamus, and, if desired, a \ndeclaration. The proposed form of order and proposed form of judgment shall be submitted \nwithin 21 days of this Opinion and Order. If the parties cannot agree on proposed language \nfor either document, each shall submit its own version, with Defendants' proposed language \nshown in redline. The parties shall also submit a joint statement of no more than 10 pages \nexplaining any disagreements.  \n[15]\nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n[1] When Defendants issued the FY 2018 solicitations, they originally indicated that grantees might, as a condition of \nDefendants disbursing awarded funds, be required to first certify compliance with 8 U.S.C. ยง 1324(a). See Schmidt \nDecl. Ex. 11 at 37 (\"Although the specific terms of ... [any] conditions [included in FY 2018 awards made pursuant to \nthis solicitation] are what will govern the awards, included among such conditions will be some that, generally \nspeaking, will require the recipient (and any subrecipient) that accepts the award to do some or all of the following.\"); \nNordeen Decl. Ex. 4 at 36 (same). The certification could occur at some point between submission of an application \nand acceptance of any awarded funds. See Schmidt Decl. Ex. 11 at 1, 35-36; Nordeen Decl. Ex. 4 at 1, 35. The \nlanguage regarding compliance with Section 1324, however, was dropped in FY 2018 award documents and \nreplaced with the current wording of the Disclosure Condition. See, e.g., RJN Ex. E ยถ 44. That is the operative \ncondition. \n[2] Defendants also raised concerns about Or. Rev. Stat. ยง 180.805. See Schmidt Decl. ยถยถ 17-18, Exs. 6-9. Section \n180.805, which is similar to Section 181A.820, prohibits any \"public body\" from disclosing a person's address, \nworkplace, telephone number, or other information \"for the purpose of enforcement of federal immigration laws.\" Or. \nRev. Stat. ยง 180.805(1). Unlike Section 181A.820, however, Section 180.805 expressly provides that its terms only \napply insofar as they are consistent with the requirements of federal law. Id. \n[3] In their FAC, Plaintiffs further suggest that they have standing under the parens patriae doctrine and based on \nDefendants' public threats of prosecution against state and local officials who refuse to actively assist federal \nimmigrations authorities in their efforts to enforce federal immigration laws. FAC ยถยถ 21, 25. Since Plaintiffs satisfy the \nstanding requirement based on the theories outlined above, and because Plaintiffs do not discuss their alternative \ntheories in the briefs, the Court declines to reach the other potential bases for Article III standing. \n\n \n \n[4] The City of Portland's sovereign interests derive from the State of Oregon's decision to vest the city with a portion \nof its own sovereign police powers. See, e.g., Jacobson v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 25, 25 \nS.Ct. 358, 49 L.Ed. 643 (1905) (\"[T]he state may invest local bodies called into existence for the purposes of local \nadministration with the authority in some appropriate way to safeguard the public health and the public safety.\"). \nDefendants do not differentiate between the City and State in their briefs. \n[5] Although Defendants issued an award notification to the City of Portland pursuant to a preliminary injunction \nin City of Evanston v. Sessions, No. 18-cv-4853, slip op. at 11 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 9, 2018), stay lifted by United States \nConference of Mayors v. Sessions, No. 18-2734, slip op. at 2 (7th Cir. Aug. 29, 2018), they continue to fight the \nissuance of a permanent injunction in City of Evanston and have indicated to the City of Portland that they may \nenforce the challenged conditions if the preliminary injunction in City of Evanston is dissolved or reversed on appeal. \nThe City of Portland's challenge to the FY 2017 conditions is therefore not moot. See Vitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480, \n486-87, 100 S.Ct. 1254, 63 L.Ed.2d 552 (1980) (holding that a defendant's voluntary cessation of challenged conduct \ndoes not render a claim moot if cessation results from the issuance of an injunction). \n[6] Because the Court finds that Defendants lack the delegated authority to impose the Notice, Access, Compliance, \nand Disclosure Conditions, it need not reach Plaintiffs' alternative Spending Clause argument. \n[7] The availability of Chevron deference is what distinguishes the present case from the Ninth Circuit's recent \ndecision in City of Los Angeles v. Barr. Under the statute challenged in Barr, 34 U.S.C. ยงยง 10381-10389, Congress \nhad created a competitive grant program and delegated \"broad authority\" for the Attorney General to \"fill gaps\" in the \nstatute, Barr, 929 F.3d at 1177. At issue was simply whether, in the exercise of this inherent and undisputed \nauthority, the Attorney General had permissibly interpreted the types of factors which he could consider in assigning \npoints to an application. Barr, 929 F.3d at 1173-74, 1177-82. That view of the grant program made sense: when there \nare more applicants than appropriated funds for grants, the Attorney Generalโabsent specific instructions from \nCongressโmust somehow distinguish between applicants. The parties in Barr were, as such, only arguing about \nwhether the term \"community policing\" evidenced a clear congressional intent to prevent the Attorney General from \nusing immigration as one of many scoring factors and, if it did not, whether doing so was based on a reasonable \ninterpretation of the term under Chevron. Id. at 1177-82. \nThe Byrne JAG statute, by contrast, does not create a competitive grant programโCongress appropriates money \nwhich must be divided, if not necessarily distributed, among all of the states according to a formulaโand the powers \nof the Attorney General to administer the program and withhold funds is carefully circumscribed. See 34 U.S.C. ยงยง \n10151-10158. Accordingly, at issue in the present case is not whether the Attorney General permissibly interpreted a \npiece of his undisputed discretionary authority to choose among grant applicants; rather, it is whether he possesses \nthe unbounded discretion to not award or disburse Byrne JAG funds in the first instance. More so than with a single \nnon-dispositive factor used as part of a larger scoring scheme for a competitive grant program, the authority to \ncompletely withhold a grant to which each state is statutorily assigned a shareโregardless of whether it applies for \nthe grantโis an authority of substantial economic and political significance. The Supreme Court, however, \"expect[s] \nCongress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast economic and political \nsignificance.\" Util. Air Regulatory Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 324, 134 S.Ct. 2427, 189 L.Ed.2d 372 (2014) (citation \nomitted). As discussed below, Congress did not do so in the Byrne JAG statute and, to the contrary, clearly intended \nto withhold such authority as evidenced by the text and structure of the statute and its surrounding provisions. \n[8] Defendants also argue that they have an historical practice of attaching conditions to Byrne JAG funds. There are \ntwo problems with that argument. First, unlike those challenged here, none of the conditions cited by Defendants are \n\"blanket requirements with which the grantee must comply under all circumstances; rather their applicability is \nconditioned on whether federal funds are used in a particular area.\" City of Philadelphia, 916 F.3d at 290 (citation \nomitted). Second, even if the conditions previously imposed by the Attorney General were analogous to those \npresently in dispute, \"an agency may not bootstrap itself into an area in which it has no jurisdiction by repeatedly \nviolating its statutory mandate.\" SEC v. Sloan, 436 U.S. 103, 119, 98 S.Ct. 1702, 56 L.Ed.2d 148 (1978) (citation \nomitted). \n[9] In any event, even if the FAC were deficient as to the Disclosure Condition, Defendants were clearly aware of the \nclaim because they raised it sua sponte in their response to Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment and \nacknowledged that Plaintiffs had previously made \"passing references\" to the Disclosure Condition. Defendants, in \nfact, submitted documents reflecting the Disclosure Condition, see RJN Ex. E ยถ 44, Ex. F ยถ 44, and knew that \n\n \n \nPlaintiffs intended to challenge as broad a swath of immigration-related conditions as constitutionally permissible \nunder Article III, see Defs.' Mot. Dismiss 15-17. When, as here, the evidentiary record is fully developed on summary \njudgment, the defendant was at least constructively aware of the plaintiff's intent to challenge a particular action, the \nissue is purely one of law, and the parties are able to fully present their legal arguments, requiring an amended \npleading would provide no benefit to the parties or the Court. See, e.g., Cummings v. City of Akron, 418 F.3d 676, \n681 (6th Cir. 2005) (\"Here, regardless of the fact that [Plaintiff] failed to raise unlawful entry in his complaint, \nDefendants were clearly on notice of [his] unlawful entry claim.\"); Renkel v. United States, 456 F.3d 640, 642 n.2 (6th \nCir. 2006) (allowing a claim which was first raised in opposition to a motion to dismiss because the issue was \"purely \none of law\"); Carter v. Ford Motor Co., 561 F.3d 562, 568 (6th Cir. 2009) (\"Sometimes, as we have recognized, a \nclaim raised in response to a summary judgment motion provides sufficient notice to the opposing party.\" (citations \nomitted)); Moore v. City of Harriman, 272 F.3d 769, 774 (6th Cir. 2001) (en banc) (\"Subsequent filings in a case may \nrectify deficiencies in the initial pleadings.\"); cf. also Johnson v. Hanada, No. 06-cv-1206-BR, 2009 WL 73867, at *3-5 \n(D. Or. Jan. 8, 2009) (applying the \"course-of-proceedings\" test to an action under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983). \n[10] On Defendants' strained reasoning, it seems that virtually any conditionโincluding the Notice and Access \nConditions, as well as any other information sharing requirementโcould be justified by the Attorney General's need \nto foster inter-governmental \"cooperation\" and \"trust\" as part of his duty to \"maintain liaison\" with grantees. \n[11] Plaintiffs seemingly accept Defendants' view that the \"applicable Federal laws\" language encompasses every \nfederal law applicable to a state or locality rather than only those laws which expressly apply to federal `grants. The \nCourt therefore assumes without deciding that Defendants' interpretation is correct. Since Plaintiffs bring an \nindependent constitutional challenge to Sections 1373 and 1644 in addition to their derivative challenge based on the \nCompliance Condition, the Court need not consider whether it could avoid the constitutional issue by construing the \n\"applicable Federal laws\" language more narrowly. See, e.g., City & Cty. of San Francisco, 349 F. Supp. 3d at 953-\n55 (finding that, although it was a \"close call,\" the term \"applicable\" is intended to refer only to \"laws related to grant \napplications\" (citation omitted)); New York, 343 F. Supp. 3d at 230-31 (same). \n[12] Defendants also argue that the Attorney General's power to dictate the \"form\" of an application necessarily \nincludes the power to ask applicants and grantees if they have laws or policies which could prevent their employees \nfrom communicating with federal immigration authorities. 34 U.S.C. ยง 10153(a). The authority to dictate the \"form\" of \nan application, however, does not include an ability to dictate its \"substance.\" New York, 343 F. Supp. 3d at \n230 (citation omitted); see also Form, Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"form\" as \"[t]he outer shape, \nstructure, or configuration of something, as distinguished from its substance or matter\"). As already discussed, the \nAttorney General is empowered to require that Byrne JAG applicants submit \"programmatic and financial\" \ninformation, but neither of those terms encompass information about laws unrelated to an applicant or grantee's \nhandling of federal funds or the programs to which those funds are directed. 34 U.S.C. ยง 10153(a)(4). It would make \nlittle sense for Congress to have described the types of information which the Attorney General may require if the \nAttorney General was already empoweredโa few lines earlier within the same subsectionโto condition Byrne JAG \nfunds on the submission of virtually any information. See Marx, 133 S. Ct. at 1178 (\"The canon against surplusage is \nstrongest when an interpretation would render superfluous another part of the same statutory scheme.\"). \n[13] At oral argument, Plaintiffs requested that any injunction, even one without nationwide effect, also run to the \nbenefit of political subdivisions of the State of Oregon. Under the Byrne JAG statute, a political subdivision may be a \ndirect grantee or a subgrantee of Byrne JAG funds. 34 U.S.C. ยง 10156(c)-(d). Those funds, whether by direct grant or \nsubgrant from the State of Oregon, come with the same conditions attached. In turn, \"[t]he political subdivisions \nexperience the same injuries described earlier, which necessarily flow to the [State of Oregon] by virtue of the \nsubdivisions' position within [its] geographic boundaries and political systems.\" New York, 343 F. Supp. 3d at 245 \nn.28. That injury is only \"compounded insofar as the [state] must ... monitor compliance\" with any subgrants it makes \nto political subdivisions within its borders. Id. As such, to accord Plaintiffs complete relief, the permanent injunction \napplies both to the State of Oregon and the political subdivisions within its borders. See id.; California ex. rel. Becerra \nv. Sessions, No. 17-cv-04701-WHO, 2018 WL 6069940, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 20, 2018) (extending permanent \ninjunction of challenged conditions to \"any California state entity\" and \"any California political subdivision). \n[14] On this point, the Court respectfully disagrees with the Seventh Circuit. See City of Chicago, 888 F.3d at 292-\n93 (\"[T]he structure of the Byrne JAG program itself supports the district court's determination to impose a nationwide \ninjunction because the recipients of the grant are interconnected.\"). \n\n \n \n[15] Defendants also submitted a request for judicial notice. See Defs.' Req. for Judicial Notice in Supp. Mot. Dismiss, \nECF No. 15. Plaintiffs filed no opposition to that request. Since the exhibits are matters of public record and not \nsubject to reasonable dispute, Defendants' request is GRANTED. See Fed. R. Evid. 201(b). \n ",

TRUMP,  President  of the  United \nStates,  in  his  official  capacity,  MATTHEW  G. \nWHITAKER,  Acting  Attorney  General  of the \nUnited  States,  in  his  official  capacity;  and  the \nUNITED  STATES  OF  AMERICA, \nDefendants. \nINTRODUCTION \n1. \nThe  State  of Oregon  acting  by  and  through  its  Governor  Kate  Brown  and  its  Attorney \nGeneral  Ellen  Rosenblum  (together  the  โState  of  Oregonโ)  brings  this  complaint  to  enforce  the \nboundaries  between  the  broad  constitutional  police  powers  of the  State  of Oregon  under  the \nTenth  Amendment  and  the  federal  governmentโs  power  over  the  subject  of immigration  and  the \nstatus  of undocumented  residents. \nPage  |  -  COMPLAINT  FOR  DECLARATORY,  INJUNCTIVE,  AND  MANDAMUS  RELIEF \nJustice #9262736 v2 \nOregon Department of Justice \n1162 Court Street NE \nSalem, OR 97301 \n(503) 947-4700 / Fax: (503) 947-4791\n2. \nDefendants  seek  to  create  a  national  requirement  that  state  and  local  law  enforcement \nassist  in  the  federal  governmentโs  immigration  enforcement.  Defendants  have  implemented  this \nnational  requirement  by  imposing  sweeping  new  conditions  on  an  established  and \ncongressionally  appropriated  federal  grant  program  โ  the  Edward  Byrne  Memorial  Justice \nAssistance  Grant  (โByrne  JAGโ)  โ that  has  for  years  provided  crucial  support  for  law \nenforcement  in  Oregon.  Essentially,  Defendants  have  โused  the  sword  of federal  funding  to \nconscript  state  and  local  authorities  to  aid  in  federal  civil  immigration  enforcement.โ  City  of \nChicago  v.  Sessions,  888  F.3d  272,  277  (7\"  Cir.  2018).  In  support  of this  effort,  Defendants  rely \non  two  immigration  statutes  โ  8  U.S.C.  ยงยง  1373  and  1644  โ  that  violate  the  Tenth  Amendment \nto  the  U.S.  Constitution. \n3. \nIn  response,  the  State  of Oregon  now  seeks  to  protect  its jurisdiction  and  its  residents \nfrom  Defendantsโ  unconstitutional  attempt  to  compel  the  State  of Oregon  to  enforce  federal \nimmigration  policies  in  a  manner  contrary  to  the  Stateโs  best  interests. \n4. \nIn  their  effort  to  impermissibly  commandeer  the  resources  of the  State  of Oregon, \nDefendants  have  withheld  Byrne  JAG  funds  because  the  State  of Oregon  has  not  acquiesced  to \nDefendantsโ  immigration  enforcement  demands.  As  a  result,  the  State  of Oregon  has  been \nunlawfully  deprived  of  $2,034,945  in  federal  funds  for  fiscal  year  (โFYโ)  2017  and  expects  to  be \ndeprived  of $2,092,704  for  FY  2018. \n5. \nIn  effect,  Defendants  seek  to  use  the  Byrne  JAG  program  as  a  tool  to  further  their \nimmigration  enforcement  agenda.  Defendants  appear  to  have  targeted  the  State  of Oregon  for \ndenial  of Byrne  JAG  funds  based  on  their  interpretation  of two  Oregon  laws  โ  ORS  181A.820 \nand  ORS  180.805.  Defendants  have  implied  in  correspondence  with  Oregon  officials  that  these \nPage  2-  COMPLAINT  FOR  DECLARATORY,  INJUNCTIVE,  AND  MANDAMUS  RELIEF \nJustice #9262736 v2 \nOregon Department of Justice \n1162 Court Street NE \nSalem, OR 97301 \n(503) 947-4700 / Fax: (503) 947-4791\nstatutes  violate  federal  law  by  preventing  cooperation  between  law  enforcement  and  immigration \nauthorities.  But  in  the  statutes  requiring  Defendants  to  distribute  Byrne  JAG  funds  to  states  and \nlocalities,  Congress  did  not  impose  any  condition  requiring  states  to  have  laws  that  aid \nDefendantsโ  implementation  of federal  immigration  policy.  For  that  reason,  the  Seventh  Circuit \nrecently  concluded  that  Defendantsโ  actions  are  unlawful.  Chicago  v.  Sessions,  888  F.3d  at  287. \nDefendantsโ  decision  to  withhold  this  federally-mandated  funding  for  law  enforcement  is \ncontrary  to  law,  good  policing,  and  common  sense. \n6. \nThe  State  of Oregon  seeks  declaratory,  injunctive,  and  mandamus  relief to  address \nDefendantsโ  violations  of federal  statutes  and  the  Constitution  of the  United  States.  Most \nimportantly,  the  State  of  Oregon  seeks  a  declaration  that  8  U.S.C.  ยงยง  1373  and  1644,  which  are \nthe  ultimate  source  of this  conflict,  are  unconstitutional. \nPARTIES \n7. \nPlaintiff State  of Oregon  is  a  sovereign  state  in  the  United  States  of America  existing \nunder  the  constitution  of the  State  of Oregon.

He  is  sued  in  his \nofficial  capacity  pursuant  to  5  U.S.C.  ยง  702. \nJURISDICTION  AND  VENUE \n13. \nJurisdiction  is  proper  in  this  Court  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  ยง  1331  because  this  case \ninvolves  a  civil  action  arising  under  the  U.S.  Constitution  and  the  laws  of the  United  States.  The \nCourt  also  has jurisdiction  under  28  U.S.C.  ยง  1346  because  this  is  a  civil  action  against  the \nfederal  government  founded  upon  the  U.S.  Constitution  and  an  Act  of Congress.

This  Court  can  provide  the  State  of Oregon  with  meaningful \nredress. \n17. \nDefendantsโ  unlawful  actions  threaten  the  State  of Oregonโs  proprietary  interests  in \nmillions  of dollars  appropriated  by  Congress  for  the  direct  benefit  of Oregon,  its  law \nenforcement  agencies,  and  its  residents.  Defendants  are  required  by  statute  to  distribute  Byrne \nJAG  funds  to  the  State  of Oregon  pursuant  to  a  strict  formula.  See  34  U.S.C.  ยง  10156(a).  The \nState  of Oregon  is  entitled  to  an  allocation  of over  $2,034,945  in  Byrne  JAG  funds  for  FY  2017. \nTo  date  Defendants  have  withheld  the  State  of Oregonโs  FY  2017  Byrne  JAG  funds.  The  State \nof Oregon  has  now  applied  for  Byrne  JAG  funds  for  FY  2018,  and  expects  to  be  entitled  to \nreceive  $2,092,704  for  FY  2018.  Because  Defendants  have  not  paid  the  Byrne  JAG  funds  for \nFY  2017,  the  State  of  Oregon  expects  that  Defendants  will  also  withhold  the  Byrne  JAG  funds \nfor  FY  2018.  Absent  injunctive  relief,  the  State  of Oregon  will  face  significant  funding  shortfalls \nfor  critical  law  enforcement  initiatives  funded  by  Byrne  JAG. \n18. \nDefendantsโ  actions  threaten  the  physical  and  economic  health  and  well-being  of Oregon \nresidents,  including  those  assisted  by  Oregon  law  enforcement  entities  entitled  to  receive  Byrne \nPage  5-  COMPLAINT  FOR  DECLARATORY,  INJUNCTIVE,  AND  MANDAMUS  RELIEF \nJustice #9262736 v2 \nOregon Department of Justice \n1162 Court Street NE \nSalem, OR 97301 \n(503) 947-4700 / Fax: (503) 947-4791\nJAG  funds.  Oregon  has  a  legitimate  interest  in  preventing  present  and  future  harm  to  its \nresidents.  Governor  Brown  and  Attorney  General  Rosenblum  therefore  have  authority  to \ncommence  this  legal  action  under  the  doctrine  of parens patriae. \n19. \nThe  Oregon  Attorney  General,  as  the  State  of Oregonโs  chief law  officer,  is  uniquely \nsituated  to  seek  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief that  protects  the  rights  of law  enforcement \nentities  and  state  and  local  government  entities  across  Oregon.  In  addition,  Defendants  have \nspecifically  and  impermissibly  required  the  Oregon  Attorney  General  to  certify  the  State  of \nOregonโs  compliance  with  unconstitutional  federal  requirements. \n20. \nIn  addition  to  requiring  the  Oregon  Attorney  General  to  certify  that  the  State  complies \nwith  unconstitutional  statutes,  Defendants  are  purporting  to  require  certification  that  subgrantees \ncomply  with  those  unconstitutional  provisions.  The  State  of Oregon  has  numerous  subgrantees, \nmany  of them  counties  and  cities  that  exercise  a  significant  degree  of political  independence \npursuant  to  Oregonโs  constitution  and  laws.  Ascertaining  subgrantee  compliance  with \nunconstitutional  statues  is  an  unjustified  burden.  And  it  is  exacerbated  by  the  inexplicably  broad \ninterpretation  of the  relevant  statutes  that  Defendants  have  endorsed.  Defendants  have  stated  in \nother  legal  proceedings  that  โinformation  regarding  citizenship  or  immigration  statusโ  under \n8  U.S.C.  ยง  1373  encompasses  any  โinformation  critical  in  applying  the  โimmigration  laws,โโโ \nincluding  information  helpful  to  Defendants  in  effectuating  the  โremoval  of  aliens.โ \n21. \nEarlier  this  year,  United  States  Secretary  for  Homeland  Security  Kirstjen  Nielsen  stated \nthat,  at  her  departmentโs  request,  the  USDOJ  was  exploring  commencing  criminal  prosecutions \nunder  8  U.S.C.  ยง  1324  against  state  and  local  elected  officials  of jurisdictions  that  do  not  actively \nassist  federal  immigration  enforcement.  In  January,  then-acting  Director  of the  U.S.  Immigration \nand  Customs  Enforcement  (โICEโโ),Tom  Homan,  similarly  stated,  โwe  gotta  start  charging  some \nPage6-  COMPLAINT  FOR  DECLARATORY,  INJUNCTIVE,  AND  MANDAMUS  RELIEF \nJustice #9262736 v2 \nOregon Department of Justice \n1162 Court Street NE \nSalem, OR 97301 \n(503) 947-4700 / Fax: (503) 947-4791\nof these  politicians  with  crimesโ  and  โhold  back  their  funding.โ  The  certifications  that \nDefendants  are  requiring  grant  recipients  to  submit  echo  these  public  comments,  threatening \nโcriminal  prosecutionโ  of  state  and  local  officials  and  โholding  back  fundingโ  from jurisdictions \nthat  do  not  actively  assist  Defendantsโ  immigration  enforcement  efforts. \n22. \nFinally,  Defendantsโ  actions  directly  injure  the  sovereignty  of the  State  of  Oregon.  The \nfederal  statutes  at  issue,  8  U.S.C.  ยงยง  1373  and  1644,  require  the  State  of Oregon  to  exercise  its \npolice  power  in  a  manner  contrary  to  the  best  interests  of Oregon  residents. \nFACTUAL  AND  LEGAL  BACKGROUND \n23. \nThis  case  presents  a  conflict  between  federal  immigration  enforcement  policies  and  the \nState  of Oregonโs  exercise  of its  broad  police  powers  under  the  Tenth  Amendment. \n24. \nโImmigration  policy  shapes  the  destiny  of the  Nation.โ  Arizona  v.  United States, \n567  U.S.  387,  415  (2012).  Plaintiff does  not  dispute  that  the  United  States  has  significant  power \nover  the  subject  of immigration  and  the  status  of undocumented  residents.  /d.  at  394.  โThe \nfederal  power  to  determine  immigration  policy  is  well  settled.

United States,  567  U.S.  387,  416. \nThat  responsibility  also  requires  ensuring  that  the  federal  immigration  laws  do  not  encroach  on \nPage  7-  COMPLAINT  FOR  DECLARATORY,  INJUNCTIVE,  AND  MANDAMUS  RELIEF \nJustice #9262736 v2 \nOregon Department of Justice \n1162 Court Street NE \nSalem, OR 97301 \n(503) 947-4700 / Fax: (503) 947-4791\nPfonA QhfTaSe   rBn.a ne -  &oy   ot  o4s6e  \n:  Po tA  YT  CaANLA N.  ts  Asi  ake \nthe  statesโ  sovereign  authority  to  exercise  their  broad  police  powers  according  to  their  own \npolitical  will. \n26. \nThe  authority  of the  federal  government  with  regard  to  immigration  does  not  diminish  the \nseparate  sovereignty  of the  states: \nWhen  the  original  States  declared  their  independence,  they  claimed  the  powers \ninherent  in  sovereigntyโin  the  words  of the  Declaration  of Independence,  the \nauthority  โto  do  all  *  *  *  Acts  and  Things  which  Independent  States  may  of right \ndo.โ  The  Constitution  limited  but  did  not  abolish  the  sovereign  powers  of the \nStates,  which  retained  โa  residuary  and  inviolable  sovereignty.โ  The  Federalist \nNo.  39,  p.  245  (C.  Rossiter  ed.  1961).  Thus,  both  the  Federal  Government  and  the \nStates  wield  sovereign  powers,  and  that  is  why  our  system  of government  is  said \nto  be  one  of  โdual  sovereignty.โ \nMurphy  v.  NCAA,  138  S.  Ct.  1461,  1475  (2018). \n27. \nA  core  aspect  of  state  sovereignty  is  the  notion  that  Congress  cannot  issue  legislative \ndirectives  to  states  in  their  role  as  states.  โConspicuously  absent  from  the  list  of powers  given  to \nCongress  is  the  power  to  issue  direct  orders  to  the  governments  of the  States.โ  Murphy  v.

It  states  in  relevant  part: \n(a)  In  General.

It  states: \nNotwithstanding  any  other provision  of Federal,  State,  or  local  law,  no  State  or  local \ngovernment  entity  may  be  prohibited,  or  in  any  way  restricted,  from  sending  to  or \nreceiving  from  the  Immigration  and  Naturalization  Service  information  regarding  the \nimmigration  status,  lawful  or  unlawful,  of an  alien  in  the  United  States. \n8  U.S.C.  ยง  1644. \n31. \nBoth  of these  statutes  specifically  regulate  conduct  by  states  (and  political  subdivisions  of \nstates)  in  their  sovereign  capacities.  Specifically,  the  statutes  purport  to  prohibit  state  and  local \ngovernments  from  enacting  laws  (or  adopting  other  policies)  that  govern  the  official  conduct  of \npublic  officers  and  employees. \nOregonโs  Immigration  Enforcement  Statutes \n32. \nThe  State  of Oregon  has  enacted  laws  regarding  the  participation  of local  and  state  law \nenforcement  agencies  in  federal  immigration  enforcement.  In  1987,  Oregon  enacted \nPage9-  COMPLAINT  FOR  DECLARATORY,  INJUNCTIVE,  AND  MANDAMUS  RELIEF \nJustice #9262736 v2 \nOregon Department of Justice \n1162 Court Street NE \nSalem, OR 97301 \n(503) 947-4700 / Fax: (503) 947-4791\nORS  181A.820,  which  bars  Oregon  law  enforcement  agencies  from  expending  money  for  the \npurpose  of detecting  or  apprehending  persons  whose  only  violation  of law  is  that  they  are \npersons  of foreign  citizenship  present  in  the  United  States  in  violation  of federal  immigration \nlaws. \n33. \nIn  2017,  the  Oregon  Legislature  enacted  ORS  180.805,  which  the  legislature  drafted  to \nspecifically  to  comply  with  Section  1373.  The  statute,  in  pertinent  part,  provides  as  follows: \n(1)  Except  as  required  by  state  or  federal  law,  a  public  body  may  not  disclose,  for \nthe  purpose  of enforcement  of federal  immigration  laws,  the  following \ninformation  concerning  any  person,  whether  current  or  otherwise: \n(a)  The  personโs  address; \n(b)  The  personโs  workplace  or  hours  of work; \n(c)  The  personโs  school  or  school  hours; \n(d)  The  personโs  contact  information,  including  telephone  number, \nelectronic  mail  address  or  social  media  account  information; \n(e)  The  identity  of known  associates  or  relatives  of the  person; \n(f)  The  date,  time  or  location  of the  personโs  hearings,  proceedings  or \nappointments  with  the  public  body  that  are  not  matters  of public  record;  or \n(ยข)  Information  described in  paragraphs  (a)  through  (f)  of this  subsection \nwith  respect  to  known  relatives  or  associates  of the  person. \nok ok ok \n(3)(a)  If a  public  body  collects  information  concerning  a  personโs  citizenship  or \nimmigration  status,  the  public  body  may  decline  to  disclose  the  information  unless \ndisclosure is  required  by: \n(A)  State  or  federal  law; \n(B)  A  court  order;  or \n(C)  A  warrant  authorized  by  a  court. \nok oko k \n(5)  Nothing  in  this  section  prohibits  any  public  body  from  complying  with  a \nfederal  immigration  authority  as  required  by  federal  law. \nok ok ok \n34. \nOregonโs  state  and  local  officials  are  responsible  for  policing,  protecting,  and  serving  all \nresidents,  including  more  than  389,000  foreign-born  individuals,  who  live  in  the  State.  To \nachieve  those  goals,  the  State  of Oregon  enacted  the  foregoing  statutes  as  an  exercise  of the \nStateโs  police  power  to  regulate  the  health,  welfare,  and  public  safety  of its  residents.  Those \nPage  10  -  COMPLAINT  FOR  DECLARATORY,  INJUNCTIVE,  AND  MANDAMUS  RELIEF \nJustice #9262736 v2 \nOregon Department of Justice \n1162 Court Street NE \nSalem, OR 97301 \n(503) 947-4700 / Fax: (503) 947-4791\nlaws  are  instrumental  to  building  the  trust  necessary  to  ensuring  that  victims  report  crimes  to  law \nenforcement  so  that  perpetrators  are  apprehended  before  harming  others.  Building  that  trust  has \nhistorically  been  difficult  in  immigrant  communities,  where  residents  often  fearโregardless  of \nimmigration  statusโthat  engaging  with  law  enforcement  could  result  in  deportation.  When  local \nand  state  officials  engage  in  immigration  enforcement,  as  Defendants  contemplate,  vulnerable \nvictims  and  witnesses  are  less  likely  to  come  forward  to  report  crimes,  creating  a  danger  to  all \nOregon  residents. \n35. \nMoreover,  those  laws  ensure  that  state  and  local  resources  are  devoted  to  fulfilling  state \nand  local  policing  responsibilities.  State  and  local  law  enforcement  agencies  are  not  required  to \nexpend  their  limited  resources  on  enforcing  immigration  policies  that  are  a  federal  responsibility. \n36. \nOregon  is  not  alone  in  adopting  this  approach.  Across  the  country,  many  other  state  and \nlocal jurisdictions  have  enacted  laws  to  limit  state  and  local  law  enforcement  of federal \nimmigration  policy.  See  e.g.  City  of Chicago  v.  Sessions,  888  F.3d  at  281;  City  of Philadelphia  v. \nSessions,  280  F.  Supp.  3d  579,  591,  602  (E.D.  Pa.  2017).  Significantly,  Oregon  law  does  not \ninterfere  with  Defendantsโ  lawful  pursuit  of its  civil  immigration  activities  in  Oregon.  See  City  of \nChicago  v.  Sessions,  888  F.3d  at  281  (โThe  federal  government  can  and  does  freely  operate  in \nโsanctuaryโ  localities.โโ). \nThe  Byrne  JAG  Program \n37. \nThe  USDOJ,  overseen  by  Defendant  Whitaker  and  acting  through  the  OJP,  administers \nthe  Byrne  JAG  program.  See  34  U.S.C.  ยงยง  10151-10158. \n38. \nThe  Byrne  JAG  program  is  a  mandatory  formula  grant:  it  requires  awarding  grant  funds \nbased  on  a  statutorily-defined  formula,  and  the  federal  government  must  disburse  funds  in  the \nPage  11  -  COMPLAINT  FOR  DECLARATORY,  INJUNCTIVE,  AND  MANDAMUS  RELIEF \nJustice #9262736 v2 \nOregon Department of Justice \n1162 Court Street NE \nSalem, OR 97301 \n(503) 947-4700 / Fax: (503) 947-4791\namount  dictated  by  that  formula  if an  applicant  meets  the  requirements  set  forth  in  the \nauthorizing  statutes.  34  U.S.C  ยง  10156. \n39, \nByrne  JAG  awards  are  provided  to  each  state,  as  well  as  to  certain  local jurisdictions \nwithin  each  state.

In  merging  those  two  programs, \nCongress  identified  eight  types  of programs  that  the  grant  was  intended  to  fund:  (1)  law \nenforcement  programs;  (2)  prosecution  and  court  programs;  (3)  prevention  and  education \nprograms;  (4)  corrections  and  community  corrections  programs;  (5)  drug  treatment  and \nenforcement  programs;  (6)  planning,  evaluation,  and  technology  improvement  programs;  (7) \ncrime  victim  and  witness  programs;  and  (8)  mental  health  programs  and  related  law  enforcement \nand  corrections  programs.  34  U.S.C.  ยง  10152(a)(1)(A)-(H). \n42. \nFor  FY  2017,  Congress  has  appropriated  $396  million  for  the  Byrne  JAG  program. \nConsolidated  Appropriations  Act  of 2017,  Pub.

See \nid.  ยง  10152(a)(1).  The  State  of Oregon  may  retain  some  of these  funds  for  itself,  see  id. \nยง  10156(c)(1),  and  must  disburse  the  rest  to  its  local  governments,  see  id.  ยง  10156(c)(2). \n44. \nThe  State  of Oregon  has  received  Byrne  JAG  funds  every  year  since  the  programโs \ncreation  in  2005.  The  State  of Oregon  has  used  Byrne  JAG  funds  to  support  drug  treatment  and \nenforcement  programs,  mental  health  programs,  and  technology  improvement  programs  among \nother  efforts.  With  respect  to  the  FY  2017  Byrne  JAG  award,  the  State  of Oregon  planned  to  use \nthe  grants  to  support  specialty  courts  designed  to  address  root  causes  of criminal  activity  and  to \nprovide  statewide  assistance  to  local  crime  victims.  For  FY  2018,  the  State  of Oregon  plans  to \nuse  Byrne  JAG  funds  to  support  specialty  court  programs  that  target  non-violent  felony  offenders \nin  an  integrated,  systemic  approach  to  reduce  drug  use  and  recidivism  while  increasing  public \nsafety. \n45. \nTo  date,  the  State  of Oregon  has  not  received  the  FY  2017  grant  totaling  $2,034,945  that \nCongress  has  appropriated  in  law  enforcement  funding  to  the  State  of Oregon  and  its  political \nsubdivisions  pursuant  to  the  Byrne  JAG  program. \n46. \nFor  FY  2018,  the  State  of Oregon  anticipates  receiving  $2,092,704,  but  the  State \nanticipates  that  Defendants  will  also  withhold  the  FY  2018  funds. \nDefendants  Impose  Three  Unlawful  Conditions  on  Byrne  JAG  Funds \n47. \nThe  Byrne  JAG  authorizing  statute,  34  U.S.C.  ยง  10153(a)(5)(D),  requires  that \njurisdictions  comply  with  โapplicable  Federal  laws.โ \nPage  13  -  COMPLAINT  FOR  DECLARATORY,  INJUNCTIVE,  AND  MANDAMUS  RELIEF \nJustice #9262736 v2 \nOregon Department of Justice \n1162 Court Street NE \nSalem, OR 97301 \n(503) 947-4700 / Fax: (503) 947-4791\n48. \nOn  July  25,  2017,  Defendants  announced  they  were  seeking  state  and  municipal \napplications  for  FY  2017  Byrne  JAG  funds.  In  this  solicitation,  Defendants  announced  new \nrequirements  for  every  state  and  municipality  receiving  FY  2017  Byrne  JAG  funds,  including  the \nthree  unlawful,  immigration-related  conditions  that  are  the  subject  of this  action.  This  complaint \nrefers  to  those  conditions  as  the  โCompliance  Condition,โ  the  โAccess  Conditionโ,  and  the \nโNotice  Condition.โ \n49. \nFor  the  purposes  of this  lawsuit,  and  consistent  with  its  correspondence  with  OJP,  the \nState  of Oregon  does  not  allege  or  concede  that  it  is  out  of compliance  with  the  Compliance, \nAccess  or  Notice  Conditions.  State  of Oregonโs  compliance  or  noncompliance  is  ultimately \nimmaterial  to  the  question  whether  Defendants  have  authority  to  impose  the  conditions.  Under \nthe  governing  statutes,  State  of Oregon  is  entitled  to  Byrne  JAG  funds  and  cannot  be  required  to \nmeet  these  additional,  unconstitutional,  conditions. \nA.  Compliance  Condition. \n50. \nIn  the  FY  2017  Byrne  JAG  solicitation,  Defendants  announced  that,  โin  order  to  validly \nto  accept  an  FY  2017  [Byrne]  JAG  award,  the  chief legal  officer  of the  applicant  State  must \nproperly  execute,  and  the  State  must  submit,  the  specific  certification  regarding  compliance  with \n8  U.S.C.  ยง  1373  attached  to  this  solicitation  as  Appendix  II.โ  Similarly,  Defendants  announced \nthat,  โin  order  validly  to  accept  a  Fiscal  Year  (FY)  2017  JAG  award,  the  chief legal  officer  of the \napplicant  unit  of local  government  must  properly  execute,  and  the  unit  of local  government  must \nsubmit,  the  specific  certification  regarding  compliance  with  8  U.S.C.  ยง  1373  attached  to  this \nsolicitation  as  Appendix  II.โ  The  Attorney  General  of Oregon  is  the  Stateโs  chief legal  officer, \nAs  aresult,  the  Attorney  General  must  execute  and  submit  certification  regarding  the  State  of \nOregonโs  compliance  with  8  U.S.C.  ยง  1373. \nPage  14-  COMPLAINT  FOR  DECLARATORY,  INJUNCTIVE,  AND  MANDAMUS  RELIEF \nJustice #9262736 v2 \nOregon Department of Justice \n1162 Court Street NE \nSalem, OR 97301 \n(503) 947-4700 / Fax: (503) 947-4791\n51. \nDefendantsโ  FY  2018  Byrne  JAG  solicitation  added  additional  language  requiring  the \njurisdictionsโ  chief legal  officer  to  certify  compliance  with  8  U.S.C.  ยง  1644.

As  a  result,  for  the  FY  2018  Byrne  JAG, \nthe  Attorney  General  must  execute  and  submit  certification  regarding  the  State  of Oregonโs \nrespective  compliance  with  8  U.S.C.  ยงยง  1373  and  1644. \nB.  The  Access  and  Notice  Conditions. \n52. \nDefendantsโ  FY  2017  state  and  local  government  solicitations  also  announced  the \napplication  of two  additional  โexpress  conditionsโ  relating  to  immigration  enforcement  โ  the \nAccess  Condition  and  the  Notice  Condition. \n53. \nPursuant  to  the  Access  Condition,  Defendants  require  recipients  of Byrne \nJAG  funds  to  โpermit  personnel  of the  U.S.  Department  of Homeland  Security  (โDHSโ)  to \naccess  any  correctional  or  detention  facility  in  order  to  meet  with  an  alien  (or  an  individual \nbelieved  to  be  an  alien)  and  inquire  as  to  his  or  her  right  to  be  or  remain  in  the  United  States.โ \n54. \nPursuant  to  the  Notice  Condition,  Defendants  require  recipients  of Byrne  JAG  funds  to \nโprovide  at  least  48  hoursโ  advance  notice  to  DHS  regarding  the  scheduled  release  date  and  time \nof an  alien  in  the jurisdictionโs  custody  when  DHS  requests  such  notice  in  order  to  take  custody \nof the  alien  pursuant  to  the  Immigration  and  Nationality  Act.โ \nDefendants  Withhold  the  FY  2017  Byrne  JAG  Award \n55. \nThe  Oregon  Criminal  Justice  Commission  (โOCJCโโ)  is  the  Oregon  state  agency  that \nreceives  and  administers  Byrne  JAG  funds  on  behalf of Oregon.  OCJC  responded  to \nPage  15  -  COMPLAINT  FOR  DECLARATORY,  INJUNCTIVE,  AND  MANDAMUS  RELIEF \nJustice #9262736 v2 \nOregon Department of Justice \n1162 Court Street NE \nSalem, OR 97301 \n(503) 947-4700 / Fax: (503) 947-4791\nDefendantsโ  solicitation  by  the  deadline  of August  25,  2017.  OCJCโs  application  proposed  to \nuse  Byrne  JAG  funds  to  achieve  the  criminal justice  goals  articulated  in  the  authorizing  statute, \nsee  34  U.S.C.  ยง  10152(a)C1),  and  OCJCโs  approach  satisfied  all  other  lawfully  imposed \nrequirements. \n56. \nAccording  to  the  FY  2017  Byrne  JAG  solicitation,  Defendants  anticipated  issuing  Byrne \nJAG  award  notifications  by  September  30,  2017.  To  date,  however,  Defendants  have  not  issued \nan  award  notification  or  otherwise  contacted  OCJC  or  any  other  state  entity  regarding  an \nacceptance  of Oregonโs  FY  2017  Byrne  JAG  applications. \n57. \nInstead  of responding  directly  to  Oregonโs  Byrne  JAG  application,  Defendants  responded \nin  a  letter  to  the  State  dated  November  15,  2017,  claiming  that  ORS  181A.820  and  ORS  180.805 \nappear  to  conflict  with  8  U.S.C.  ยง  1373.  OJPโs  letter  did  not  explain  OJPโs  view  that  ORS \n181A.820  and  ORS  180.805  conflict  with  8  U.S.C.  ยง  1373(a).  Instead  it  requested  a  narrative \ndetailing  any  Oregon  โlaws,  policies,  or practices  that  violate  section  1373,โ  including \nORS  181A.820  and  ORS  180.805.  OCJC  replied  with  a  detailed  explanation  that  the  laws  do  not \nconflict  with  federal  law. \n58. \nOn  April  17,  2018,  the  OJP  sent  an  email  to  OCJC  in  which  it  explained  that  โThe \nBureau  of Justice  Assistance  (BJA)  has  not  awarded  its  FY  2017  Byrne  JAG  grants  due  to  the \nissuance  of a  nationwide  injunction  by  a  U.S.  District  Court  on  September  15,  2017,โ  but  that  in \nthe  meantime  โstate  and  local  applicants  for  Byrne  JAG  grants  under  the  FY  2017  program  may \nobligate  and  expend  their  own  funds  on  allowable  JAG  projects  after  the  start  date  of \nOctober  1,  2016.  Once  the  grants  are  awarded,  FY  2017  Byrne  JAG  funds  received,  if any,  may \nbe  used  for  reimbursement  of those  expenditures.โ \nPage  16  -  COMPLAINT  FOR  DECLARATORY,  INJUNCTIVE,  AND  MANDAMUS  RELIEF \nJustice #9262736 v2 \nOregon Department of Justice \n1162 Court Street NE \nSalem, OR 97301 \n(503) 947-4700 / Fax: (503) 947-4791\n59. \nDefendantsโ  imposition  of immigration-related  conditions  on  FY  2017  Byrne  JAG \nfunding  has  been  litigated  in  several  courts,  including  the  Seventh  Circuit,  which  concluded  in \nApril  2018  that  the  USDOJ  lacked  authority  to  impose  the  Access  and  Notice  Conditions.  City \nof Chicago  v.  Sessions,  888  F.3d  at  277;  see  also  City  of Chicago  v.  Sessions,  No.  17CV5720, \n2018  WL  3608564,  at  *11-*12  (N.D.  Ill.  July  27,  2018).  Two  district  courts  have  also  held  that \nSection  1373  violates  the  Tenth  Amendment  and  that  as  a  result,  Defendants  may  not  condition \nthe  receipt  of Byrne  JAG  funds  on  compliance  with  an  unconstitutional  statute.  City  of Chicago \nv.  Sessions,  2018  WL  3608564,  at  *5-*11  (โSection  1373  is  this  unconstitutional  on  its  face.โโ); \nCity  of Philadelphia  v.  Sessions,  309  F.  Supp.  3d  289,  328-31  (E.D.  Pa.  2018)  (holding  Section \n1373  unconstitutional  under  the  anti-commandeering  doctrine). \n60. \nDespite  these  rulings,  Defendants  continue  to  withhold  State  of Oregonโs  FY  2017  Byrne \nJAG  funds.  Defendantsโ  correspondence  with  the  State  of Oregon  regarding  Oregonโs  2017 \nByrne  JAG  application  indicates  that  Defendants  seek  to  override  Oregon  policy  designed  to \nencourage  all  residents  to  interact  with  state  and  local  law  enforcement,  and  with  government \nagencies. \nDefendants  Impose  Further  Conditions  on  FY  2018  Byrne  JAG  Funds \n61. \nOn  July  20,  2018,  Defendants  announced  that  they  would  impose  a  number  of \nimmigration-related  conditions  on jurisdictions  seeking  FY  2018  Byrne  JAG  funding. \n62. \nTwo  of those  conditions  are  materially  identical  to  the  Access  and  Notice  Conditions \ndiscussed  above.  Defendants  have  also  expanded  the  Compliance  condition  to  incorporate \n8  U.S.C.  ยง  1644  in  addition  to  ยง  1373.  Given  the  substantive  similarities  between  the  two  federal \nPage  17  -  COMPLAINT  FOR  DECLARATORY,  INJUNCTIVE,  AND  MANDAMUS  RELIEF \nJustice #9262736 v2 \nOregon Department of Justice \n1162 Court Street NE \nSalem, OR 97301 \n(503) 947-4700 / Fax: (503) 947-4791\nta  PR  Af  VS \neeAtRuAeLs   obSes   gASbT   2s \nstatutes,  this  addition  does  not  appear  to  meaningfully  change  the  nature  of the  Compliance \nCondition. \n63. \nIn  addition  to  the  certification  required  with  regard  to  the  Compliance  Condition,  the \n2018  application  requires  applicants  to  respond  to  questions  related  to  the  Compliance \nCondition: \n(1)  Does  your jurisdiction  have  any  laws,  policies,  or  practices  related  to \nwhether,  when,  or  how  employees  may  communicate  with  DHS  or  ICE? \n(2)  Is  your jurisdiction  subject  to  any  laws  from  a  superior  political  entity \n(e.g.,  a  State  law  that  binds  a  city)  that  meet  the  description  in  question  |? \nAnswers,  and  potentially  additional  material,  โmust  be  provided  by  the  applicant  as  part  of the \nJAG  application,โ  as  a  condition  of receiving  Byrne  JAG  funds. \n64. \nThe  FY  2018  Byrne  JAG  application  also  states  that  the  โreasonable  costsโ  of complying \nwith  the  Notice  and  Access  Conditions,  including  the  costs  of  โhonoring  any  duly  authorized \nrequests  from  DHS  that  is  encompassed  by  these  conditions,  will  be  allowable  costs  under  the \naward.โ  That  provision  further  demonstrates  Defendantsโ  usurpation  of the  Congressional \nspending  power.  Byrne  JAG  funds,  which  Congress  explicitly  directed  to  support  local  criminal- \njustice  efforts,  will  instead  be  used  to  unlawfully  fund  federal  immigration  enforcement. \n65. \nThe  FY  2018  Byrne  JAG  applications  also  purports  to  condition  awards  on  the \njurisdictionโs  chief legal  officer  (the  Attorney  General)  certifying  that  the jurisdiction  will  not \nโviolate,  or  aid  or  abet  any  violation  of,  8  U.S.C.  ยง1324(a)  (forbidding  any  โperson,โ  in  โknowing \nor  in  reckless  disregard  of the  fact  that  an  alien  has  come  to,  entered,  or  remains  in  the  United \nStates  in  violation  of law,โ  to  โconceal,  harbor,  or  shield  from  detection,  or  attempt  to  conceal, \nharbor,  or  shield  from  detection,  such  alien  in  any  place,  including  any  building  or  any  means  to \naid  or  abet  in  the  commission  of the  preceding  actsโ).โ \nPage  18  -  COMPLAINT  FOR  DECLARATORY,  INJUNCTIVE,  AND  MANDAMUS  RELIEF \nJustice #9262736 v2 \nOregon Department of Justice \n1162 Court Street NE \nSalem, OR 97301 \n(503) 947-4700 / Fax: (503) 947-4791\nDefendants  Lack  Authority  to  Impose  the  Compliance  Condition \n66. \nBecause  8  U.S.C.  ยงยง  1373  and  1644  violate  the  Tenth  Amendment,  Defendants  may  not \nrely  on  the  Compliance  Condition  to  withhold  Plaintiffsโ  FY  2017  Byrne  JAG  funds,  or  to  reject \nPlaintiff's  FY  2018  Byrne  JAG  applications.  The  Tenth  Amendment  limits  Congressโs \nlegislative  authority  to  those  powers  enumerated  in  the  Constitution.  Congress  may  not  directly \ncompel  states  and  their  political  subdivisions  to  enact  a  regulation  or  enforce  a  federal  regulatory \nprogram,  may  not  conscript  state  officers  for  such  purpose,  and  may  not  prohibit  a  state  from \nenacting  laws.  This  constitutional  anti-commandeering  principle  โis  one  of the  Constitutionโs \nstructural  protections  of liberty.โ  Printz  v.  United  States,  521  U.S.  898,  921  (1997).  Among \nother benefits,  the  anti-ccommandeering  principle  ensures  that  the  sovereign  states  are  free  to \nlegislate  as  they  see  fit  to  promote  the  safety  and  welfare  of their  residents. \n67. \nThe  Supreme  Court  recently  affirmed  that  the  anti-commandeering  principle  prevents \nCongress  from  issuing  direct  orders  to  state  legislatures.  Murphy  v.  NCAA,  138  S.  Ct.  at  1478. \nThis  is  precisely  what  8  U.S.C.  ยง  1373(a)  and  (b)  and  ยง  1644  do.  These  provisions  dictate  to \nstates  like  Oregon  that  they  may  not  promulgate  laws  or  regulations  that  prohibit  state  or  local \nofficials  from  sharing  immigration-status  information  with  federal  officials,  even  if  sharing  that \ninformation  would  directly  undermine  state  or  local  programs.  โA  more  direct  affront  to  state \nsovereignty  is  not  easy  to  imagine.โ  /d.  Sections  1373(a)-(b)  and  1644  regulate  only  state \nactors,  and  regulate  them  only  in  their  capacity  as  state  actors.  Thus  neither  is  a  preemptive \nfederal  law.  Murphy  v.  NCAA,  138  S.  Ct.  at  1481.  8  U.S.C.  ยง  1373(a)-(b)  and  ยง  1644  are \nunconstitutional. \n68. \nDefendants  may  not  condition  Oregonโs  Byrne  JAG  funds  on  the  Stateโs  compliance  with \nan  unconstitutional  statute.

The  creation  of these  conditions  by  the \nexecutive  branch  to  impede  congressionally-appropriated  funding  of state  and  local  law \nenforcement  violates  the  doctrine  of  separation  of powers  by  invading  Congressโs  spending \nauthority.  โโThe  power  of the  purse  does  not  belong  to  the  Executive  Branch.

Defendants,  as  executive \nbranch  officials,  have  no  authority  to  impose  additional  conditions  on  the  receipt  of funds \nappropriated  by  the  legislative  branch  for  the  Byrne  JAG  program;  the  authority  to  condition  the \nreceipt  of federal  funds  lies  exclusively  with  Congress.  As  the  Seventh  Circuit  held  in  City  of \nChicago  v.

This  anti-commandeering  principle  also  forbids  Congress  from  unequivocally \ndictating  what  a  state  legislature  may  and  may  not  do. \n73. \nSections  1373  and  1644  on  their  face  violate  the  Tenth  Amendment  because  they  require \nstate  and  local  governments  to  govern  according  to  Congressโs  instructions. \n74. \nIn  addition,  Sections  1373  and  1644  on  their  face  violate  the  Tenth  Amendment  because \nthey  commandeer  state  and  local  officials  to  administer  or  enforce  a  federal  regulatory  program. \n75. \nBecause  Sections  1373  and  1644  violate  the  Tenth  Amendment,  Defendants  cannot \nrequire  the  State  of Oregon  to  certify  compliance  with  these  unconstitutional  statutes. \nPage  21  -  COMPLAINT  FOR  DECLARATORY,  INJUNCTIVE,  AND  MANDAMUS  RELIEF \nJustice #9262736 v2 \nOregon Department of Justice \n1162 Court Street NE \nSalem, OR 97301 \n(503) 947-4700 / Fax: (503) 947-4791\n70. \nAn  actual  controversy  exists  because  Defendants  are  requiring  the  State  of  Oregon  to \ncertify  compliance  with  Sections  1373  and  1644  in  order  to  obtain  congressionally  appropriated \nfederal  funds  even  though  the  two  statutes  violate  the  Tenth  Amendment. \n77. \nPursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  ยง  2201,  State  of Oregon  is  entitled  to  a  declaration  that  Sections \n1373  and  1644  violate  the  Tenth  Amendment  and  are  unconstitutional. \n78. \nPlaintiffs  are  also  entitled  to  a  declaration  that  Defendants  cannot  rely  on  these  statutes, \nor  on  any  reporting  or  certification  requirements  related  to  these  statutes,  to  withhold  the  Byrne \nJAG  funds  under  the  Compliance  Condition. \n79. \nState  of Oregon  is  also  entitled  to  injunctive  relief prohibiting  Defendants  from \nwithholding  FY  2017  Byrne  JAG  funds  due  to  State  of Oregon. \n80. \nState  of Oregon  is  also  entitled  to  injunctive  relief prohibiting  Defendants  from  declining \nto  accept  and  process  State  of Oregonโs  FY  2018  Byrne  JAG  applications,  and  from  withholding \nFY  2018  Byrne  JAG  funds  due  to  State  of Oregon. \nSECOND  CLAIM  FOR  RELIEF \nVIOLATION  OF  CONGRESSIONAL  SPENDING  AUTHORITY  AND  SEPARATION \nOF  POWERS \nDECLARATORY  AND  INJUNCTIVE  RELIEF \n(Ultra  Vires  as  to  the  Access  and  Notice  Conditions) \n81. \nPlaintiff repeats  and  re-alleges  Paragraphs  |  through  79  as  if fully  set  forth  herein. \nPage  22  -  COMPLAINT  FOR  DECLARATORY,  INJUNCTIVE,  AND  MANDAMUS  RELIEF \nJustice #9262736 v2 \nOregon Department of Justice \n1162 Court Street NE \nSalem, OR 97301 \n(503) 947-4700 / Fax: (503) 947-4791\n82. \nArticle  I,  Section  I  of the  United  States  Constitution  vests  Congress  with  legislative \npowers,  and  Article  I,  Section  VII  of the  United  States  Constitution  vests  exclusively  in \nCongress  the  spending  power  to  โprovide  for  *  *  *  the  General  Welfare  of the  United  States.โ \nAbsent  a  statutory  provision  or  express  delegation,  only  Congress  is  empowered  to  attach \nconditions  to  federal  funds. \n83. \nDefendants  are  officials  of the  Executive  Branch.  The  executive  does  not  have  unilateral \nauthority  to  refuse  to  spend  funds  that  have  already  been  appropriated  by  Congress  for  a \nparticular project  or program.  Imposing  a  new  condition  on  a  federal  grant  program  amounts  to \nrefusing  to  spend  money  appropriated  by  Congress. \n84. \nCongress  has  not  enacted  the  Access  and  Notice  Conditions  as  part  of any  statutory \nscheme. \n85. \nCongress  has  not  enacted  the  Access  and  Notice  Conditions  as  applicable  to  Byrne  JAG \nfunds. \n86. \nCongress  has  not  delegated  to  Defendants  the  authority  to  impose  the  Access  and  Notice \nConditions  on  the  acceptance  of an  application  for  Byrne  JAG  funds,  the  processing  of  such  an \napplication,  or  on  the  issuance  of Byrne  JAG  funds. \n87. \nDefendantsโ  imposition  of the  Notice  and  Access  Conditions,  and  of all  related  reporting \nand  certification  requirements,  unconstitutionally  intrudes  upon  and  usurps  powers  that  belong  to \nCongress,  violating  the  principle  of  separation  of powers  generally  and  the  Spending  Clause \nspecifically. \nPage  23  -  COMPLAINT  FOR  DECLARATORY,  INJUNCTIVE,  AND  MANDAMUS  RELIEF \nJustice #9262736 v2 \nOregon Department of Justice \n1162 Court Street NE \nSalem, OR 97301 \n(503) 947-4700 / Fax: (503) 947-4791\n88. \nPursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  ยง  2201,  State  of Oregon  is  entitled  to  a  declaration  that  the  Access \nand  Notice  Conditions  are  ultra  vires  and  unconstitutional;  that  these  conditions  do  not  provide  a \nbasis  for  withholding  or  terminating  any  of the  Stateโs  federal  funding;  that  Defendants  may  not \nimpose  these  conditions  or  any  related  reporting  or  certification  requirements  to  withhold  the \nStateโs  FY  2017  Byrne  JAG  funds;  that  Defendants  may  not  impose  these  conditions  or  any \nrelated  reporting  or  certification  requirements  to  decline  to  accept  and  process  State  of Oregonโs \nFY  2018  Byrne  JAG  applications,  or  to  deny  State  of Oregonโs  FY  2018  Byrne  JAG  funds;  and \nthat  these  conditions  and  any  related  reporting  or  certification  requirements  should  be  set  aside. \n89. \nState  of Oregon  is  also  entitled  to  injunctive  relief prohibiting  Defendants  from \nwithholding  FY  2017  Byrne  JAG  funds  due  to  State  of Oregon. \n90. \nState  of Oregon  is  also  entitled  to  injunctive  relief prohibiting  Defendants  from  declining \nto  accept  and  process  State  of Oregonโs  FY  2018  Byrne  JAG  applications,  and  from  withholding \nFY  2018  Byrne  JAG  funds  due  to  State  of Oregon. \nTHIRD  CLAIM  FOR  RELIEF \n(Mandamus) \n91. \nState  of Oregon  repeats  and  re-alleges  Paragraphs  |  through  89  as  if fully  set  forth  herein. \n92. \nPursuant  to  Part  A,  Subchapter  V,  Chapter  101,  Subtitle  1,  of Title  34  of the  United  States \nCode,  34  U.S.C.  ยงยง  10151-10158,  Plaintiff has  a  clear  right  to  receive  from  Defendants  โ  and \nDefendants  have  a  nondiscretionary  duty  to  provide  to  State  of Oregon  โ  Byrne  JAG  award \nnotifications  for  the  full  amount  of funds  to  which  it  is  entitled  that  do  not  contain  any \nPage  24  -  COMPLAINT  FOR  DECLARATORY,  INJUNCTIVE,  AND  MANDAMUS  RELIEF \nJustice #9262736 v2 \nOregon Department of Justice \n1162 Court Street NE \nSalem, OR 97301 \n(503) 947-4700 / Fax: (503) 947-4791\nunconstitutional  or  unlawful  conditions.

Declare  that  because  8  U.S.C.  ยงยง  1373  and  1644  violate  the  Tenth  Amendment, \nthe  Compliance  Condition  does  not  provide  a  basis  for  withholding  or  terminating  any  of  State  of \nOregonโs  congressionally  appropriated  Byrne  JAG  funding. \n3.
