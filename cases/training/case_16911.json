    "summary": "<p>On November 14, 2018, Migrant Justice, Inc. and four individual members of the organization filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Vermont. The plaintiffs sued the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Vermont Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), and the United States under 42 U.S.C. §1983 and Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908). The plaintiffs, represented by the various public interest organizations including the ACLU of Vermont, Center for Constitutional Rights, the National Immigration Law Center, as well as private counsel, sought injunctive, monetary, and declaratory relief, claiming violations of the First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause, as well as federal tort claims, including Invasion of Privacy, Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, and False Imprisonment. </p><p>The plaintiffs, organizers and advocates for immigrant farmworkers, alleged that ICE has retaliated against them in response to their advocacy and public criticism, thereby chilling their speech and interfering with their freedom of association. As a result, Migrant Justice claimed that it had to take extensive and costly precautions, limiting its overall reach to the community. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that ICE has infiltrated their meetings; targeted, surveilled, and engaged in disinformation campaigns to sow distrust among their members; and arrested and/or detained twenty active Migrant Justice members pursuant to an unlawful retaliatory policy. The plaintiffs further alleged that DMV employees consistently share personally identifying information about plaintiffs with ICE in a manner that disproportionately targets and impacts non-white and Latinx residents. </p><p>The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on February 7, 2019, removing one member of the organization as a plaintiff. There were no other substantive changes made to the complaint.</p><p>On January 21, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice as to Wanda Minoli, the Commissioner of the Vermont DMV after entering into a settlement. The DMV agreed to not share immigration or citizenship information with ICE, DHS, and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and to implement new protocols to protect against such disclosures, including training for its law enforcement employees, counter staff, and managers. The settlement also included improvements to the DMV's language access services. The DMV agreed to 18 months of auditing and $100,000 in attorneys' fees: $20,000 would go to the plaintiffs and $80,000 would be set aside for the DMV's costs in complying with the settlement.</p><p>On October 28, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice after entering into a settlement with the remaining defendants. The U.S. agreed to pay $100,000 in damages. ICE granted the plaintiffs deferred action for five years (stopping their potential deportations), and said it would not use any information gathered during this lawsuit, deferred action requests, or employment authorization applications against the plaintiffs in any future immigration proceedings. ICE also promised to tell its agents that immigrants, regardless of immigration status, are protected by the First Amendment and have the right to freedom of speech and assembly. This included sending a memo to its Vermont employees to explain that they must act in accordance with the First Amendment, including its commitment to not profile, target on account of, or discriminate against any individual or group for exercising First Amendment rights.\"</p><p>The case is ongoing.</p>",

Plaintiffs alleged that the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) implemented retaliatory policies in response to their activism on behalf of immigrant farm workers, including extensive surveillance and false imprisonment, in violation of their First Amendment Rights and that the Vermont Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) aided these practices by consistently and intentionally sharing personally identifying information about the plaintiffs with ICE in a manner that violated their Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection rights. On January 21, 2020, the plaintiffs and the DMV settled, and the DMV agreed to implement new protocols to protect against disclosing immigration and citizenship information with ICE. The plaintiffs then settled with the remaining defendants on October 28, 2020. The settlement agreement included $100,000 in damages, deferred action for the plaintiffs so they would not be deported, and ICE informing its employees that all immigrants are protected by the First Amendment.",

McAleenan \nActing Secretary \nSUBJECT:  Information Regarding First Amendment Protected Activities \n1 am proud of the work you do every day to protect our Homeland.  You serve as America's \nFrontline and your commitment to the highest ethical and moral principles is a testament to each \nof you, the founding values of our Department, and our nation.  It is in this spirit that I write to \nyou today to emphasize- as you all know-that the privilege of administering and enforcing \nfederal laws carries with it the responsibility for upholding the principles of professionalism, \nimpartiality. courtesy, and respect for civil rights and civil liberties. \nDHS does not profile. target, or discriminate against any individual for exercising his or her First \nAmendment rights. 1 Under the Privacy Act of 1974, all DHS personne12 are prohibited from \nmaintaining records that describe how a U.S. citizen (USC) or alien lawfully admitted for \npermanent residence (LPR?  exercises his or her First Amendment rights, ··unless expressly \nauthorized by statute or by the individual about whom the record is maintained or unless pertinent \nto and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity.''4 \nInf01mation, in any form, regarding how an individual exercises First Amendment rights shall \ninclude (among other things): \n1.  Information about an individual's religious beliefs and practices; \n2.  Information about an individual's political or personal beliefs or associations, academic or \nscientific inquiries, or the expressions thereof; \n1 The First Amendment provides that \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or \nprohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech. or of the press; or the right of the people \npeaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.''  U.S. Canst. amend. I. \n2 For purposes of this memorandum, ''DHS personnel'' includes all DHS employees, including those who are law \nenforcement agents and officers and those in the intelligence community, as well as those performing work on behalf \nof DHS employees, such as contractors. \n3 To the extent that a person's status is unknown or UJlclear, for tJ1e purposes of this policy thal pc::r:son shall be treatc::d \nas an ''individual\" covered by the Privacy Act. 5 U.S.C. § 552a(a)(2). \n4 5 U.S.C. § 552a(e)(7). \nFOR OFFICIAL USE Ol'*:Y \nwww.dhs.gov \n\n3.  Information about an individual's (including journalists, attorneys, academics, \nrepresentatives of non-governmental organizations, etc.) reporting activities and \ndocwnentation: or. \n4.  Information about an individual's associations with others for lawful purposes, including \nparticipation in protests or other non-violent demonstrations against government policy or \nactions. \nIndividuals· First Amendment rights are protected regardless of the medium of their \ncommunications.  These principles apply to communications such as oral or written speech (both \nin paper and electronic form); non-verbal communications such as art works~ and, in some \ninstances. to commercial speech and gestures (such as physical rituals associated with prayer). \nWith those First Amendment rights in mind. I direct that DHS personnel shall not collect. maintain \nin DHS systems, or use information protected by the First Amendment u11less (a) an individual \nbas expressly granted their consent for DHS to collect, maintain, and use that information; (b) \nmaintaining the record is expressly authorized by a federal statute: or (c) that information is \nrelevant to a criminal, civil, or administrative activity relating to a law DHS enforces or \nadministers. In addition, DRS personnel should not pursue by questioning, research or other \nmeans. information relating to how an individual exercises his or her First Amendment rights \nunless one or more of the same conditions applies. \nExpress Statutory Authorization \nDHS agencies may collect and maintain records regarding First Amendment activity when doing \nso is expressly authorized by statute.  As explained in longstanding guidance from the Office of \nManagement and Budget (OMB), a statute need not specifically address the maintenance of \nrecords of First Amendment activities if it references activities that are relevant to a determination \nconcerning an individual. 5 Thus, for example, DHS personnel may collect information on First \nAmendment protected activity when that activity is relevant to the granting or denial of a pending \napplication. \nConsent of the Individual \nRecords on First Amendment activity may be maintained if the individual voluntarily provides it, \nthereby con enting to its use by DHS.  For example, ·'if an individual volunteers information on \ncivic or religious activities in order to enhance his chances of receiving a benefit, such as \n5 Privacy Act Lmplementation, Guidelines and Responsibilities. 40 Fed. Reg. 28,948.28,965 (July 9, 1975) \n(hereinafter OMB Guidelines).  The Guidelines specifically cite to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) as an \nexample: \"[S]ince the Immigration and Nationality Act makes the possibility of religious or political persecution \nrelevant to a stay of deportation, the infonnation on rhese subjects may be admitted in evidence, and therefore would \nnot be prohibited by [subsection (e)(7).\" OMB Guidelines, at 28,965.  Many other INA provisions potentially involve \nconsideration of First Amendment activity.  E.g., 8 U.S.C. II 01 (a)( 43) (deftnition of refugee, for purpose of refugee \nand asylum eligibilitydetenninations, includes persecution based on membership in social group, religion, or political \nopinion); 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B) (inadmissibility of any alien who, inter alia, ''endorses or espouses terrorist activity \nor persuades others to endorse or espouse terrorist activity or support a terrorist organization\"); 8 U.S.C. \n1l82(a)(3)(D) (ground of inadmissibility for membership or affiliation with lhe Communist or other totalitarian \nparty); 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(F) (ground of inadmissibility for association with terrorist organizations); 8 U.S.C. \n1227(a)(4)(8) (deportability of aliens admitted to the United States if described in terrorism-related grounds of \ninadmissibility); 8 U.S.C. 1424 (prohibition upon the naturalization of persons opposed to government or law, or who \nfavor totalitarian fonns of government). \n\nexecutive clemency, the agency may consider information thus volunteered.\"6 As applied to DHS, \nindividuals may voluntarily provide consent in submitting their associations and beliefs when \napplying for naturalization pursuant to filing USC IS Form N-4007 or may proactively provide \ninformation in written materials, including correspondence, or during an inspection or encounter. \nRelevant to Law Enforcement Activity \nIf the use of information regarding First Amendment protected activities is not otherwise covered \nby one or both of the exceptions discussed above (explicit statutory authority and consent), DHS \npersonnel may include such information in DHS systems if the information is pertinent to and \nwithin the scope of an authorized criminaL civil, or administrative law enforcement activity.8 \nFor example, information about First Amendment protected activities is pertinent to and within the \nscope ofDHS's administration or enforcement of a statute, regulation. or executive order when all \nDHS personnel: \n1.  Document questions and responses relating to an individual's occupation, purpose for \ninternational travel, or any merchandise the individual seeks to bring across the border; \n2.  Document questions, responses. or other information to validate information supplied \nby an individual or determine whether potential criminal. civil, or administrative \nviolations exist relating to the laws that DHS enforces or administers; \n3.  Document journalistic or scientific research, academic inquiry. and/or analysis or \nquestions and responses relating to information regarding an individual indicating a \npotential violation of a law DHS enforces or administers, or a threat to border security, \nnational security, officer safety, or public safety; \n4.  Document research and/or analysis relating to activities protected by the First \nAmendment to the extent that it may facilitate an individual's travel by, for example, \nverifying information provided by the individual-(e.g., validating a visa based on a \nreligious purpose); or, \n5.  Take into account information regarding religion in order to identify whether a \nreasonable accommodation for an individual's religious beliefs would be appropriate. \nThis may include subsequent documentation of relevant information in DHS records \nregarding the action (for example, noting that a certain action was undertaken as an \naccommodation or noting that an accommodation was requested or deemed \nappropriate). \nEach of us is called to do an extraordinarily important job for our nation.  In executing this \nmission, it is my job to ensure that you are empowered to do so in accordance with our highest \nmoral, ethical. and legal obligations.  To this end, 1 have tasked the DHS Office for Civil Rights \nand Civil Liberties and the DHS Privacy Office to review existing guidance and develop new \n6OMB Guidelines, al 28965. \n7 It must be noted that DHSIUSCIS may also collect this information pursuant to its statutory authority in determining \nwhether the applicant comes under section 313 of the INA's (8 U.S.C. 1424) prohibition upon the naturalization of \npersons opposed to government or law, or who favor totalitarian forms of government Thus. collecting and \nmaintaining this information is lawful both because of express statutory authorization as described above, and because \nthe applicant consented to providing it by signing and filing the application. \n8 DHS may still maintain records consistent with 552a(e)(7) even if there is no ongoing or current law enforcement \ninvestigation. \n\nguidance. where appropriate, to assist the operational components in implementing this \nmemorandum. 9 \nAs you execute your mission each day, our Privacy and Civil Rights and Civil Liberties colleagues \nstand by to assist with any further questions or concerns you may have on this topic.  Please \ncontact Jonathan R. Cantor, Acting Chief Privacy Officer and Peter Mina, CRCL Deputy Officer \nfor Programs and Compliance, and their staffs with those questions.  Please contact your \nComponent Counsel Offices with any legal questions. \n9 Nothing in this policy memorandum or tasking otherwise impairs the statutory or delegated authorities and \nresponsibilities of the Privacy Office or the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, including the authority to \n\"investigate complaints and information indicating possible abuses of civil rights or civil liberties\" under 6 U.S.C. § \n345 or investigate noncompliance DHS privacy policies under 6 U.S.C. § 142.

Migrant Justice organizes and advocates for Vermont's immigrant farmworkers-a \n18 \ncommunity of approximately 1,500 people who labor long hours under grueling and often dangerous \n19 \nconditions.  The organization has achieved remarkable success in organizing workers to assemble, \n20 \npublicly protest, march, and assert their perspectives in the larger marketplace of commerce and \n21 \nideas.  Migrant Justice's members have identified four core areas of organizational focus: dignified \n22 \nwork and quality housing, freedom of movement and access to transportation, freedom from \n23 \ndiscrimination, and access to healthcare. \n24 \n2.  In the course of its advocacy, Migrant Justice has loudly and publicly criticized U.S. \n25 \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE'\").  ICE has retaliated, and continues to retaliate, by \n26 \ndisrupting Plaintiffs' advocacy and infringing upon their First Amendment rights. \n27 \n3.  ICE has infiltrated Migrant Justice's private meetings; targeted, surveilled, and \n28 \nengaged in disinformation campaigns to sow distrust among its members; and arrested and/or \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 2 of 41\ndetained no fewer than twenty active Migrant Justice members, including the Individual Plaintiffs \n2  each of whom played and continues to play a critical role in Migrant Justice's advocacy. \n3  4.  ICE takes these actions because Plaintiffs are engaged in First Amendment activities \n4  and to deter them and others from engaging in similar activity. \n5  5.  ICE advances its retaliatory agenda with the assistance of the Vermont Department of \n6  Motor Vehicles (\"DMV\").  Motivated by racial and xenophobic animus, DMV employees give ICE \n7  private driver information, including the personal information and location, of non-white, \n8  predominately Latino, individuals. \n9  6.  ICE's actions have chilled and continue to chill Migrant Justice's ability to organize \nIO  and advocate for migrant workers.  Fewer members attend community assemblies, events, protests, \n11  and rallies.  Migrant Justice finds it more difficult to enlist members to speak at public events.  ICE \n12  has also frustrated Migrant Justice's ability to advocate for fair labor practices and economic justice. \n13  Time and money once dedicated to this mission are now used to advance funds towards immigration \n14  bonds and attorneys' fees and to fight detentions of members. \n15  7.  As for the Individual Plaintiffs, not only has ICE chilled their speech and interfered \n16  with their association, but ICE's surveillance, harassment, arrest, and detention of them has caused \n17   and continues to cause them significant emotional distress. \n18  8.  Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief to end Defendants' unlawful and \n19  discriminatory practices, as well as monetary damages against the United States. \n20  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n21  9.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 (federal \n22  question), 1343 (civil rights), and 1346 (United States as Defendant), and 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  The \n23  Court has authority to grant declaratory relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2201. \n24  10.  Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) because a substantial part \n25  of the events giving rise to Plaintiffs' claims occurred in this district, under 28 U.S.C. § l 39l(b)(l) \n26  because the DMV is located in the district, and also under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because Defendants \n27  Nielsen, Vitiello, and Albence are officers and employees of the United States or its agencies \n28 \n2 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 3 of 41\n1  operating under color oflaw, and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the \n2  claims have occurred and are occurring in this judicial district. \n3  PARTIES \n4 \nA.  Plaintiffs \n5  11.  Plaintiff Migrant Justice, Inc. is a non-profit, non-partisan organization that was \n6  established in 2009.  Migrant Justice's mission is \"to build the voice, capacity, and power of the \n7  farmworker community and engage community partners to organize for economic justice and human \n8  rights.  [Migrant Justice] gathers the farmworker community to discuss and analyze shared problems \n9  and to envision collective solutions.  Through this ongoing investment in leadership development, \n10  members deepen their skills in community education and organizing for long-term systemic change.'' \n11  More than 90 percent of Migrant Justice members are Latino.  Migrant Justice brings this lawsuit on \n12  its own behalf, as well as on behalf of its members. \n13  12.  Plaintiff Jose Victor Garcia Diaz has been an active and visible Migrant Justice \n14  member since 2013.  He is a dairy worker in Vermont and a nationally-recognized human rights \n15  leader.  Plaintiff Garcia Diaz contacted Migrant Justice after enduring years of inhumane conditions \n16  on a Vermont dairy fann.  He became a leader in an effort by farmworkers and allies to march on the \n17  Ferrisburgh farm that employed him and as a result won nearly $2,000 in back wages for dairy \n18  workers.  As a member of Migrant Justice's Farmworker Coordinating Committee, Plaintiff Garcia \n19  Diaz helped build the Milk with Dignity Program, which seeks to establish fundamental labor \n20  protections for the Vermont dairy worker community.  To this end, Plaintiff Garcia Diaz represented \n21  his community in meetings and negotiations with Ben & Jerry's, a prominent Vermont, national, and \n22  international purchaser of dairy products, during the process of the company committing to join the \n23  Milk with Dignity Program.  He resides and has resided in Vermont during the events relevant to this \n24  Complaint and is Latino. \n25  13.  Plaintiff Miguel Alcudia Gamas has been an active and visible Migrant Justice \n26  member since 2014.  He is a member of Migrant Justice's Farmworker Coordinating Committee, a \n27  former dairy worker, and a public spokesperson for Migrant Justice's Milk with Dignity Program. \n28  He participated in the successful campaign to secure a commitment from Ben & Jerry's to join the \n3 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 4 of 41\nMilk with Dignity Program.  Plaintiff Alcudia Gamas plays a crucial role as a farmworker \n2  spokesperson on Migrant Justice's education team, educating other workers about their rights and \n3  raising the awareness of the public at large about the plight of immigrant workers.  He has also \n4  participated in region wide efforts to build connections between immigrant rights and racial justice \n5  movements.  He resides and has resided in Vermont during the events relevant to this Complaint and \n6  is Latino. \n7  14.  Plaintiff Jose Enrique \"Kike\" Balcazar Sanchez has been an active and visible \n8  Migrant Justice member since 2011.  He is a leader with Migrant Justice and a former dairy worker. \n9  He continues to be one of Migrant Justice's primary spokespeople.  He was a lead spokesperson in its \n10  campaign to expand access to driving privileges and for a fair and impartial policing policy to limit \n11  law enforcement collaboration with ICE.  Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez was also one of the primary \n12  architects of the Milk with Dignity Program.  He helped lead the campaign that resulted in Ben & \n13  Jerry's committing to join the Milk with Dignity Program in 2015, and he was central to securing \n14  finalization of Ben & Jerry's commitment in 2017.  He has appeared routinely in local and national \n15  press coverage for several years.  Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez serves on the Vermont Attorney \n16  General's Immigration Task Force, representing immigrant farmworkers, helping to craft a guidance \n17  manual for Vermont cities and towns regarding their role in immigration law enforcement, and \n18  advocating for policies to provide stronger protections for Vermont's immigrant communities.  He \n19  resides and has resided in Vermont during the events relevant to this Complaint and is Latino. \n20  15.  Plaintiff Zully Palacios Rodriguez has been an active and visible Migrant Justice \n21  member since 2016.  She was a vocal leader in Migrant Justice's women's group, which organizes \n22  groups of women who are immigrant farmworkers.  She became involved with Migrant Justice in \n23  2016, aiding in a successful campaign to free then-detained Migrant Justice leader and co-Plaintiff \n24  Garcia Diaz.  She participated in the successful campaign to secure a commitment from Ben & \n25  Jerry's to join the Milk with Dignity Program.  Plaintiff Palacios Rodriguez is involved in the \n26  national movement for immigrant rights and food justice, representing Migrant Justice in gatherings \n27  of the Food Chain Workers Alliance and the Cosecha Movement.  She resides and has resided in \n28  Vermont during the events relevant to this Complaint and is Latina. \n4 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 5 of 41\nB.  Defendants \n2  Federal Defendants \n3  16.  Defendant Kirstjen Nielsen is Secretary of the United States Department of \n4  Homeland Security (''OHS\"').  In this capacity, she is charged with enforcing and administering U.S. \n5  immigration laws.  She is sued in her official capacity. \n6  17.  Defendant Ronald Vitiello is the Deputy Director and Senior Official Performing the \n7  Duties of Director for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  In this capacity, he is charged \n8  with administering the enforcement of United States immigration law.  He is sued in his official \n9  capacity. \n10  18.

Defendant United States of America is sued for Plaintiffs' injuries caused by the \n17  wrongful acts or omissions of its employees.  Those employees were acting within the scope of their \n18  employment under circumstances in which the United States, if a private person, would be liable to \n19  Plaintiffs according to the laws of Vennont. \n20  Vermont DMV Defendant \n21  21.  Defendant Wanda Mino Ii is the Commissioner of the Vermont Department of Motor \n22  Vehicles.  In this capacity, she is charged with enforcing and administering the regulations governing \n23  the DMV, the governmental agency responsible for registering and inspecting automobiles and other \n24  motor vehicles as well as licensing drivers in Vermont.  At all relevant times, Defendant Minoli was \n25  acting under color oflaw, as an agent, employee, and/or representative of Vermont.  She is sued in \n26  her official capacity. \n27  22.  Federal and DMV Defendants are collectively referred to herein as \"Defendants.'· \n28 \n5 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 6 of 41\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n2 \nA.  Migrant Justice and Its Members Engage in Protected Speech, Win Changes that \nImprove the Lives of Migrants, and Criticize ICE and the DMV. \n3 \n23.  Migrant Justice fights for the rights of the approximately 1,500 migrant farm workers \n4 \nin Vermont.  These workers typically work sixty to eighty hours per week, endure extreme isolation, \n5 \nand are systemically excluded from many worker and housing rights protections. \n6 \n24.  Within the past decade, Migrant Justice's organizing and advocacy has focused on \n7 \nimproving working conditions at dairy farms across the state; partnering with the Vermont Workers' \n8 \nCenter to include undocumented people in Vermont's 2011 groundbreaking universal healthcare \n9 \nlegislation; winning tens of thousands of dollars in back wages through Migrant Justice's Workers' \n10 \nRights Hotline; and advocating for the Vermont Department of Labor to change employment law \n11 \nrelated to collection of unpaid wages, among other activities. \n12 \n1.  Migrant Justice Improves Working Conditions Through the Milk with \n13 \nDignity Program. \n14 \n25.  One example of Migrant Justice's visible, groundbreaking advocacy is its high-profile \n15 \nMilk with Dignity Program, a farmworker-driven initiative to improve conditions in dairy supply \n16  chains.  The Program rests on a participatory model in which workers, farmers, consumers, and retail \n17 \ncorporations align values and work together to build a fair food system. \n18 \n26.  Starting in 2014, Migrant Justice focused its campaign for the Milk with Dignity \n19  Program on ice cream manufacturer Ben & Jerry's, an influential company headquartered within \n20 \nVermont that purchases vast amounts of milk from the local dairy-farming community. \n21 \n27.  In June 2015, after persistent public advocacy by Migrant Justice, Ben & Jerry's \n22 \nsigned a written commitment to negotiate an agreement with Migrant Justice to join the Milk with \n23 \nDignity Program.  The New York Times heralded the commitment as an \"innovative movement[] ... \n24 \nto improve wages and working conditions.''  The Christian Science Monitor called the June 2015 \n25 \nagreement \"an important agreement with Ben & Jerry's to recognize the fundamental human rights of \n26 \nmigrant workers in dairy supply chains.'' \n27 \n28.  After signing the commitment, however, Ben & Jerry's delayed in signing a formal \n28 \nagreement to join the Program.  Migrant Justice and its members then engaged in more than two \n6 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 7 of 41\nyears of advocacy, community organizing, and escalating public protest to win allies and increase \n2  pressure on Ben & Jerry's.  Finally, on October 3, 2017, Ben & Jerry's signed a formal agreement to \n3  join Milk with Dignity. \n4  2.  Migrant Justice's First Amendment Activity Frustrates ICE's Agenda by \nProtecting Migrant Workers from Deportation. \n5 \n29.  In 2011, Migrant Justice launched one of its first campaigns against an ICE policy. \n6 \nMigrant Justice opposed ICE's Secure Communities Program, under which local law enforcement \n7 \nshared fingerprints with ICE. \n8 \n30.  On August 18, 2011, Migrant Justice member Danilo Lopez hand-delivered a petition \n9 \nsigned by more than 70 farmworkers to then-Governor Peter Shumlin.  The petition asked Governor \n10 \nShumlin to publicly ··say no\" to Secure Communities because it ''threatens our security,\" \"promotes \n11 \nracial discrimination,\" and lacks transparency. \n12 \n31.  Three weeks later, Vermont state police stopped a car for speeding in which Lopez \n13 \nwas a passenger.  Although he was not the driver and state police are not responsible for enforcing \n14 \nimmigration law, state police handed Lopez over to U.S. Border Patrol. \n15 \n32.  In response to Lopez's arrest, on September 13, 2011, Migrant Justice organized its \n16 \nfirst protest against ICE for a member's detention.  Migrant Justice alleged that the incident violated \n17 \nthe state police's existing bias-free policing policy and pushed the state government to adopt an \n18 \nexpanded bias-free policing policy.  Governor Shumlin and the Vermont Human Rights Commission \n19 \nopened separate investigations into Lopez's arrest. \n20 \n33.  Migrant Justice continued campaigning to prevent Lopez's deportation, urging ICE to \n21 \ngrant a stay ofremoval.  Migrant Justice enlisted support from Vermont's entire Congressional \n22 \ndelegation-Senior United States Senator Patrick Leahy and Junior United States Senator Bernard \n23 \nSanders and United States Representative Peter Welch-as well as Governor Shumlin and Burlington \n24 \nMayor Miro Weinberger, all of whom wrote letters urging ICE to exercise its prosecutorial discretion \n25 \nin Lopez's favor.  ICE granted Lopez a stay ofremoval. \n26 \n34.  In November 2011, Governor Shumlin announced that the Vermont State Police had \n27 \nadopted an expanded bias-free policing policy aimed at preventing discrimination on the basis of \n28 \n7 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 8 of 41\n1  race, ethnicity, or immigration status.  The expanded policy limited state involvement in federal \n2  immigration enforcement by restricting when officers could inquire about immigration status. \n3  35.  Migrant Justice continued to campaign for improved bias-free policing policies.  In \n4  2012, the Vermont legislature enacted a new law requiring all law enforcement agencies in Vermont \n5  to adopt bias-free policing policies.  2012 Acts & Resolves No. 134, § 2 (codified at 20 V.S.A. \n6  § 2366 (2012)). \n7  36.  In 2014, Vermont passed Act I 93, a law mandating collection of roadside stop data \n8  and establishing a process and timeline for the Vermont Criminal Justice Training Council to adopt a \n9  model Fair and Impartial Policing policy.  2014 Vt. Acts & Resolves No. 193, § 3 (codified at 20 \nIO  V.S.A. § 2366 (2014)).  The legislation explicitly directed the Criminal Justice Training Council to \n11  \"\"consult[] with stakeholders, including the Vermont League of Cities and Towns, the Vermont \n12  Human Rights Commission, and Migrant Justice.\" \n13  37.  In February 2015, Migrant Justice assisted a member, Lorenzo Alcudia Gamas, to file \n14  a complaint with the Vermont Human Rights Commission against the Grand Isle County Sheriffs \n15  Department.  A deputy had stopped a car driven by a Migrant Justice volunteer in which Alcudia \n16  Gamas rode in the passenger seat, on his way to a community meeting as a representative of Migrant \n17  Justice. \n18  38.  The deputy issued the Caucasian driver a warning for speeding but turned Alcudia \n19  Gamas over to U.S. Border Patrol.  The Vermont Human Rights Commission concluded that there \n20  were reasonable grounds to believe that the Sheriff's Department had discriminated against Alcudia \n21  Gamas on the basis of his national origin and race.  In April 2016, the Sheriff's Department settled \n22  with Alcudia Gamas and the Human Rights Commission for nearly $30,000. \n23  39.  In 2016, Vermont passed Act 147, a law establishing deadlines for the completion of \n24  fair and impartial policing training and in-service training.  2016 Vt. Acts & Resolves No. 147, § 26 \n25  (codified at 20 V.S.A. 2366 (2016)).  Migrant Justice had advocated for the passage of this law. \n26  40.  Migrant Justice continues advocating and organizing to promote fair and impartial \n27  policing policies to this day. \n28 \n8 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 9 of 41\n41.  Migrant Justice also actively campaigns to prevent the deportation of members \n2  arrested by federal immigration authorities, by organizing public support to lobby immigration \n3  officials and submit support letters in immigration court, engaging in social media campaigns, and \n4  serving as a resource to connect community members to legal help.  Migrant Justice has publicly \n5  campaigned to stop the deportation of eleven members. \n6  3.  Migrant Justice's Activism Around Driver Privilege Cards Placed and \nContinues to Place ICE and the Vermont OMV in the Public Spotlight. \n7 \n42.  Beginning in 2012, Migrant Justice and its members embarked on a long and \n8 \nultimately successful legislative campaign to create the Vermont \"Driver Privilege Card\" (\"DPC\"), \n9 \nwhich permits Vermont residents to drive within the state, regardless of immigration status.  Plaintiff \nIO \nBalcazar Sanchez and Migrant Justice member Danilo Lopez, described by the statewide news \n11 \nwebsite VTDigger as a '·frequent presence\" at the Vermont Statehouse, led the campaign. \n12 \n43.  In 2013, after more than a year of campaigning, lobbying, and organizing by Migrant \n13 \nJustice members, the Vermont legislature passed the DPC legislation.  It became effective on January \n14 \n1, 2014.  2013 Acts & Resolves No. 74 (codified at 23 V.S.A. § 603). \n15 \n44.  The DPC provided a solution for migrant workers who did not have the documentation \n16 \nrequired by the federal REAL ID act to obtain driver's licenses, yet who needed to drive in order to \n17 \nwork and meet basic needs within a rural state.  The DPC also proved popular for many other \n18 \nVermont residents who needed to drive within the state but did not want or could not obtain a REAL \n19 \nID-compliant driver's license. \n20 \n45.  More than 40,000 Vermont residents obtained a DPC in a little over a year. \n21 \n46.  In early 2014, the OMV began sending personally identifying information obtained \n22 \nfrom DPC applications to ICE and scheduling appointments to facilitate ICE arrests. \n23 \n4 7.  As one of the only community organizations in the State working with Latinos, \n24 \nMigrant Justice quickly became the point-organization to assist individuals struggling to access \n25 \nDPCs.  Migrant Justice advocated in the press, with elected officials, and with the agency itself to \n26 \ninvestigate and reform practices, and publicly questioned the DMV's actions, particularly with regard \n27 \nto state-federal law enforcement cooperation. \n28 \n9 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 10 of 41\n48.  From 2016 through 2018, the ACLU of Vermont, in coordination with Migrant \n2  Justice, filed a series of public records requests seeking information about the implementation of the \n3  DPC program.  The Vermont press reported extensively on the information obtained and in April \n4  2017, the Vermont Senate held hearings about the DMV's information-sharing with ICE.  Migrant \n5  Justice became well known to OMV and ICE officials because of its public role.  Migrant Justice's \n6  advocacy relating to DPCs continues to the present day. \n7 \nB.  ICE Surveils, Infiltrates, Engages in Disinformation, Arrests, and Detains \nPlaintiffs and Others to Retaliate and Chill Their First Amendment Rights. \n8 \n49.  Beginning in at least 2014, ICE has targeted, surveilled, and spread disinformation \n9 \nabout Migrant Justice, its staff, and its leaders.  ICE has also arrested and detained no fewer than \n10 \ntwenty active Migrant Justice members and leaders. \n11 \n50.  The majority of these arrests did not fit within ICE's internal priorities for \n12 \nenforcement.  Rather, they occurred contemporaneously with and in response to the increasing \n13 \nvisibility and activism of Migrant Justice in challenging misconduct by the Vermont DMV and \n14 \nabusive ICE practices in Latino and worker communities. \n15 \n51.  While these Migrant Justice members were detained, ICE interrogated them without \n16 \ncounsel; interrogated them about circumstances clearly beyond ICE's jurisdiction; ridiculed them; \n17 \nand threatened them with indefinite detention. \n18 \n1.  ICE Arrests Plaintiff Jose Victor Garcia Diaz and Specifically Notes His \n19 \nAffiliation with Migrant Justice on His Arrest Documents. \n20 \n52.  On April 18, 2016, a DHS/ICE Deportation Officer requested Plaintiff Jose Victor \n21 \nGarcia Diaz's photograph and DPC application from the Vermont OMV.  A DMV Enforcement \n22 \nDivision Administrative Supervisor complied on April 19, 2016. \n23 \n53.  On April 20, 2016, Plaintiff Garcia Diaz returned to Vermont from Los Angeles where \n24 \nhe had represented Migrant Justice at a well-publicized conference for the Food Chain Workers \n25 \nAlliance, a national coalition oflabor rights organizations.  Plaintiff Garcia Diaz posted on Facebook \n26 \nabout his traveling to the conference and his anticipated participation in a cultural event the next day. \n27 \n28 \n10 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 11 of 41\n54.  On April 21, 2016, ICE agents arrested Plaintiff Garcia Diaz in a parking lot outside of \n2  the cultural event in Stowe, Vermont.  Plaintiff Garcia Diaz was with Plaintiffs Palacios Rodriguez \n3  and Balcazar Sanchez at the time of his arrest. \n4  55.  In paperwork documenting the arrest, the ·'Report of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien,., \n5  known as the Form I-213, ICE Agent Brady Goff noted that Plaintiff Garcia Diaz was a ''member and \n6  associate of Migrant Justice.\"  An internal ICE report issued on April 21, 2016 noted that Plaintiff \n7  Garcia Diaz is a \"prominent and public member of the immigrant advocacy group Migrant Justice.\" \n8  56.  During his interrogation, ICE asked Plaintiff Garcia Diaz about an identification card \n9  he possessed from the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, a prominent activist farmworker group in \n10  Florida.  ICE seized the card.  The ICE agents knew of the Coalition ofimmokalee Workers and \n11  commented on the organization in front of Plaintiff Garcia Diaz.  ICE also seized his DPC.  ICE has \n12  not returned either piece of documentation. \n13  57.  After Plaintiff Garcia Diaz's arrest, Migrant Justice launched a series of rallies to \n14  support him.  On April 22, 2016, Migrant Justice members assembled in Senator Leahy's office in \n15  Burlington, Vermont to protest ICE' s conduct.  On May 1, 2016, Migrant Justice organized a rally in \n16  Montpelier attended by hundreds of individuals.  As a result of Migrant Justice's petitioning, Senator \n17  Leahy' s office stated its intent to intervene on Plaintiff Garcia Diaz's behalf and lobbied against ICE \n18  practices in Washington, D.C.  Senator Sanders followed shortly thereafter and also submitted a letter \n19  to ICE supporting Plaintiff Garcia Diaz. \n20  2.  ICE Arrests Migrant Justice Member Alberto Sanchez Perez and Spreads \nDisinformation about Migrant Justice Staff to Sow Distrust. \n21 \n58.  On August 24, 2016, ICE arrested Migrant Justice member Alberto Sanchez Perez. \n22 \nSanchez Perez has no criminal record and did not qualify as a OHS enforcement priority under the \n23 \nNovember 20, 2014 guidelines.  ICE officers targeted Sanchez Perez and falsely claimed that they \n24 \nneeded to investigate the causes of a car accident in which he was a passenger.  Although they had no \n25 \njurisdiction over the car accident, the ICE officers interrogated Sanchez Perez for several hours, held \n26 \nhim overnight, prevented him from contacting an attorney, and made multiple references to his \n27 \nperceived sexual orientation. \n28 \n11 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 12 of 41\n59.  ICE officers told Sanchez Perez that they had been discussing the accident with \n2  Migrant Justice leader Marita Canedo and had asked Canedo to bring Sanchez Perez to the ICE \n3  office, and that they would not have arrested Sanchez Perez if Canedo had given him a message that \n4  they wanted to speak with him. \n5  3.  ICE Arrests Plaintiff Miguel Alcudia Gamas and Warns Him that \"Kike\" \nIs \"Next.\" \n6 \n60.  ICE next arrested and detained Migrant Justice leader Plaintiff Miguel Alcudia \n7 \nGamas.  Plaintiff Alcudia Gamas has no criminal record and did not qualify as a DHS enforcement \n8 \npriority under the November 20, 2014 guidelines. \n9 \n61.  Plaintiff Alcudia Gamas is the cousin of Lorenzo Alcudia Gamas, whose involvement \n10 \nin Migrant Justice's advocacy for bias-free policing is discussed above. \n11 \n62.  On September 16, 2016, a DHS/ICE Deportation Officer requested from the Vermont \n12 \nDMV Plaintiff Alcudia Gamas's photograph, his DPC application, and a list of vehicles registered in \n13 \nhis name. \n14 \n63.  A DMV employee complied, volunteered that Plaintiff Alcudia Gamas's license plate \n15 \n··was recently issued,'' and asked if the DHS/ICE Deportation Officer ''want[e d] the paperwork for \n16 \nthat.'' \n17 \n64.  An ICE Important Federal Interest Memorandum (\"IFI Memo\") dated September 19, \n18 \n2016, states that \"continued prosecution of [Plaintiff Alcudia Gamas] would serve an important \n19 \nfederal interest\" even though. according to the cover email accompanying the IFI Memo, Plaintiff \n20 \nAlcudia Gamas was \"not currently an ICE Enforcement Priority.''  The IFI Memo does not specify \n21 \nthe reasons for this determination. which was made as a matter of \"prosecutorial discretion.'' \n22 \n65.  ICE surveilled Plaintiff Alcudia Gamas and arrested him on September 22, 2016.  ICE \n23 \nidentified Plaintiff Alcudia Gamas by his license plate and DPC.  During the arrest, an ICE agent \n24 \nasked Plaintiff Alcudia Gamas if he was related to Lorenzo Alcudia Gamas.  Plaintiff Alcudia Gamas \n25 \nreplied that they were cousins. \n26 \n66.  The ICE agent also asked Plaintiff Alcudia Gamas if he knew Migrant Justice leader-\n27 \nmember ''Kike.'' referring to Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez by his nickname.  When Plaintiff Alcudia \n28 \nGamas replied that he did, the ICE agent stated that Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez was \"next.'' Plaintiff \n12 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 13 of 41\nAlcudia Gamas took this to mean that Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez would be the next Migrant Justice \n2  leader to be arrested and detained. \n3  67.  Under the section titled ·'Recommendation/Disposition\" on Plaintiff Alcudia Gamas's \n4  Form 1-213, an ICE officer noted that a ''representative of the advocacy group Migrant Justice\" called \n5  the ICE ERO office on September 22, 2016. \n6  68.  On September 22, 2016, Mi!:,rrant Justice organized a protest at the ICE facility at St. \n7  Albans, Vermont in response to Plaintiff Alcudia Gamas's arrest.  Migrant Justice also secured a \n8  letter from Senator Sanders to support Plaintiff Alcudia Gamas's release from detention on bond. \n9  Internal ICE documents reflect that ICE employees expended significant effort responding to \n10  Congressional and media inquiries generated by Migrant Justice's advocacy efforts. \n1 1  4.  ICE Targets Additional Migrant Justice Members. \n12  69.  On February 2, 2017, ICE arrested Migrant Justice member Arturo Ruiz Rodriguez \n13  outside of his home.  Ruiz Rodriguez has no criminal record and did not qualify as a OHS \n14  enforcement priority under prevailing enforcement guidelines. \n15  70.  During the arrest, Ruiz Rodriguez informed ICE that his minor son, a seven-year-old \n16  U.S. citizen, was inside.  Ruiz Rodriguez asked ICE if he could make arrangements for child care \n17  while he was detained.  An ICE agent refused this request and added that if Ruiz Rodriguez entered \n18  his home, ICE would arrest and detain his seven-year-old son as well. \n19  71.  The ICE agent falsely informed Ruiz-Rodriguez that he had received his name and \n20  address from Migrant Justice leader Will Lambek. \n21  72.  On March 15, 2017, ICE arrested Migrant Justice member Cesar Alexis Carrillo \n22  Sanchez.  Carrillo Sanchez's 1-213 notes that ICE relied for the arrest upon information obtained \n23  from his \"Vermont DMV license application.'' \n24  5.  ICE Enlists an Informant to Surveil and Target Plaintiffs Zully Palacios \nRodriguez and Jose Enrique Balcazar Sanchez. \n25 \n73.  By February and March 2017, ICE had already begun a full-scale campaign to \n26 \ninfiltrate and debilitate Migrant Justice, employing means far exceeding legitimate immigration \n27 \nenforcement practice. \n28 \n13 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 14 of 41\n74.  ICE enlisted at least one civilian informant to infiltrate Migrant Justice, which it used \n2  to effect the arrests of two prominent Migrant Justice member-leaders, Plaintiffs Palacios Rodriguez \n3  and Balcazar Sanchez, just days after the arrest of Migrant Justice member Carrillo Sanchez. \n4  75.  Neither Plaintiff Palacio Rodriguez nor Balcazar Sanchez have criminal records, nor \n5  did they qualify as OHS enforcement priorities.  Internal documents confirm that ICE was aware it \n6  had no apparent legitimate law enforcement reason to arrest and detain Plaintiffs Palacios Rodriguez \n7  and Balcazar Sanchez. \n8  76.  According to text messages sent between ICE Agent John Trantum and the informant, \n9  ICE used the informant to obtain private information to arrest, detain, and retaliate against Plaintiffs \n10  and their colleagues because of their activism.  Messages sent between the informant and her trusted \n11  acquaintance, Jane Doe, 1 also a civilian, confirm this relationship.  According to the informant, \n12  ·'anytime [Agent Trantum] makes an arrest he asks me [for information about the subject.]\" \n13  77.  Jane Doe told Migrant Justice leaders that ICE knew that to \"strike a blow\" against \n14  Migrant Justice they needed to target Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez because he was \"very outspoken.'\" \n15  78.  The informant's text messages reveal that she further ingratiated herself with the \n16  organization in order to establish membership and gain access to non-public meetings and private \n17  conversations.  For instance, the informant attended a number of Migrant Justice events, including \n18  but not limited to a February 25, 2017 Fannworker Assembly that was not open to the public.  The \n19  informant's presence intruded upon Plaintiffs' privacy. \n20  79.  On March 1, 2017, ICE Agent Tran tum asked the civilian informant to target a \n21  specific Migrant Justice member.  The informant sent Jane Doe a photograph of at least seven \n22  individuals wearing Migrant Justice T-shirts and asked her. \"Hey you know this guy at all?\"  Internal \n23  ICE emails also confirm that ICE surveilled targets based on photographs of individuals \"wearing [] \n24  Migrant Justice Tee-shirt[s] [sic].'' \n25  80.  In another message on March 4, 201 7, the informant discussed with Jane Doe ICE' s \n26  plan to apprehend Plaintiff Palacios Rodriguez.  The informant confided in Jane Doe that ICE had \n27 \n28 \n1  \"Jane Doe'' is used to protect confidentiality. \n14 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 15 of 41\n1  been surveilling Plaintiff Palacios Rodriguez's house for many weeks and had even seen Migrant \n2  Justice leader Marita Canedo's car at her residence. \n3  81.  According to Plain ti ff Palacios Rodriguez's Form I-213 documenting her arrest, an \n4  ICE officer-for no stated reason-ran a search for her biographical information in October 2016. \n5  According to a separate internal memorandum, the investigating ICE officer noted that he was \n6  conducting a Facebook search.  The Form 1-213 states that ICE received information •'from a \n7  concerned citizen,\" whom Plaintiffs believe to be the informant. \n8  82.  Internal ICE emails between Homeland Security Investigations (\"HSI\") Burlington \n9  and Enforcement and Removal Operations (\"ERO\") Boston reflect that Plaintiff Palacios Rodriguez \n10  was a target of a planned arrest in March 201 7. \n11  83.  Although Plaintiff Palacios Rodriguez was the ostensible target, ICE's surveillance led \n12  ICE agents to believe they could arrest Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez, too.  On March 13, 2017, ICE \n13  drafted a \"Field Operations Worksheet\" regarding Plaintiff Palacios Rodriguez.  Under an entry for \n14  \"Spouse/Children,,. the operations worksheet states that Plaintiff Palacios Rodriguez's \"Boyfriend Is \n15  Enrique Balcazar.''  Internal ICE documents note that \"BALCAZAR will most likely be with \n16  [Palacios] at the time of arrest as they are together most of the time.,. \n17  84.  On March 8, 2017, a OHS/ICE Deportation Officer emailed the OMV to request \n18  Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez's license plate information.  A DMV employee complied the next day. \n19  85.  On March 13, 2017, in response to a request for an \"Agency Assist,'' a DMV official \n20  transmitted Balcazar Sanchez's application for a Driver Privilege Card to ICE Agent Goff.  In the \n21  margins of the application, a OMV official handwrote the words \"UNDOCUMENTED'' and \n22  \"'PRIVILEGE CARD.'\"  Balcazar Sanchez's I-213 states that ICE obtained a number of documents \n23  from the OMV: in addition to the standard OMV document requested, the DMV sent a \"biographic \n24  page'\" and copies of identity documents.  An internal DHS and ICE \"Field Operations Worksheet\" \n25  reflects that the OMV also sent Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez's license plate number and car model. \n26  86.  On March 17, 2017, at about 1: 15 a.m., Plaintiff Palacios Rodriguez received a \n27  notification from Microsoft that an unauthorized individual had attempted to gain access to her email \n28 \n15 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 16 of 41\n1  account.  Plaintiff Palacios Rodriguez was not aware of her account previously being hacked and this \n2  was the first time that she received this type of notification. \n3  87.  Later that day, after driving from a meeting at Migrant Justice with Plaintiff Palacios \n4  Rodriguez in the front passenger seat, Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez observed a white car following \n5  them from the meeting.  According to an internal document, the arresting ICE officer recognized him \n6  from Plaintiff Garcia Diaz's arrest and was able to identify him even though he was driving directly \n7  behind him. \n8  88.  Three unmarked cars boxed in Plaintiffs Palacios Rodriquez and Balcazar Sanchez in \n9  a very busy intersection of Route 7 and Flynn A venue.  Plainclothes officers exited their vehicles, did \n10  not identify themselves, and ordered Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez to put the car in park, put his hands \n11  on the wheel, and get out of the car.  Agent Goff, with his hand on his gun, seized Plaintiff Palacios \n12  Rodriguez's phone from out of her hand, unbuckled her seatbelt, and physically removed her from \n13  the vehicle.  The officers screamed at Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez, humiliated him, and caused a \n14  demeaning public spectacle.  Bystanders, including children, observed the spectacle, and several \n15  individuals inquired about the nature of the arrest. \n16  89.  Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez asked the officers to identify themselves, why they were \n17  detaining them, and if they had an arrest warrant.  The officers did not respond.  Though ICE officers \n18  handcuffed him by the wrists and later by the ankles, ICE never told Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez that \n19  he was under arrest, or why. \n20  90.  Agent Goff referred to Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez repeatedly by his nickname, \"Kike,'· \n21  and other ICE agents referred to Plaintiff Palacios Rodriguez as \"Vicki,'' a nickname for her middle \n22  name that she uses on Facebook. \n23  91.  ICE agents made repeated references to Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez's and Plaintiff \n24  Palacios Rodriguez's affiliation with Migrant Justice.  ICE explicitly forbade Plaintiff Balcazar \n25  Sanchez from contacting Migrant Justice during his processing and detention.  ICE agents threatened \n26  him that if he did call Migrant Justice, \"it will be worse for you.\" \n27 \n28 \n16 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 17 of 41\n92.  Agent Goff forbade Plaintiff Palacios Rodriguez from calling Migrant Justice leaders \n2  Will Lambek or Brendan O'Neill (referring to them by name) and forbade her from disclosing her \n3  location. \n4  93.  Later, when Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez arrived at a detention facility in Swanton, \n5  Vermont, Jeff Curtis, ICE Supervising Deportation and Detention Officer, told the facility that he had \n6  brought them \"a famous person,\" in reference to Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez's activism. \n7  94.  An ICE officer also attempted to coax Plaintiff Palacios Rodriguez into signing an \n8  order of voluntary departure by threatening falsely that she would be detained for two months without \n9  bond. \n10  95.  ICE considered Plaintiffs Balcazar Sanchez and Palacios Rodriguez \"high-profile \n11  cases.\"  On March 21, 201 7, four days after Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez's and Palacios Rodriguez's \n12  arrests, in response to a newspaper article about Migrant Justice, an ICE employee asked Timothy \n13  Robbins, Deputy Assistant Director of ICE/ERO, Daniel Ragsdale, then ICE Deputy Director, and \n14  Defendant Matthew Albence, Executive Associate Director of ICE/ERO, for \"executive summaries'\" \n15  on Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez, Migrant Justice member Alex Carrillo, and Migrant Justice leader Will \n16  Lambek. \n17  96.  ICE had no basis to target Plaintiffs Balcazar Sanchez or Palacios Rodriguez to protect \n18  public safety or comply with ICE's stated priorities.  An internal email thread on March 30, 2017, \n19  reflects ICE's desired priority to ''push forward on subjects with a criminal/public safety nexus.'' \n20  Neither Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez nor Plaintiff Palacios Rodriguez had criminal records, as reflected \n21  in both of their Form I-2 l 3s.  A separate OHS document lists Plaintiff Palacios Rodriguez's \"risk to \n22  public safety'' as \"low.'' \n23  97.  Just a few weeks prior to Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez's arrest, Vermont Attorney \n24  General T.J. Donovan had appointed him to his Immigration Task Force. \n25  98.  In late March and April 201 7, in response to the arrests of Plaintiffs Balcazar Sanchez \n26  and Palacios Rodriguez, Migrant Justice organized protests to advocate for their release.  Dozens \n27  picketed around the St. Albans ICE office; hundreds of allies gathered in downtown Burlington, \n28 \n17 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 18 of 41\nMontpelier, and Brattleboro; and a petition to release the individuals gathered thousands of \n2  signatures. \n3  99.  The protests generated significant media coverage.  Vermont United States Senators \n4  Leahy and Sanders, Congressman Welch, and Vermont Senator Pro Tempore Tim Ashe voiced their \n5  concern about ICE tactics and policies. \n6  l 00.  On March 27, 2017, the date of Plaintiffs Balcazar Sanchez and Palacios Rodriguez's \n7  bond hearing, Migrant Justice members organized a protest attended by hundreds of individuals \n8  outside of the Boston Immigration Court. \n9  101.  Internal ICE documents reflect that ICE knew of the locations and times of the \n10  protests before they occurred.  ICE employees shared with one another a number of Migrant Justice \n11  Facebook photos publicizing the event. \n12  102.  Senator Sanders had also submitted letters to the Immigration Court with 10,000 \n13  signatures of support, noting that it was \"unclear why these two individuals would possibly be \n14  considered enforcement priorities[.]\" \n15  6.  ICE Continues to Hold and Prosecute Two Migrant Justice Members \nAfter Learning About Their Affiliation with Migrant Justice. \n16 \n103.  On June 17, 2017, Customs and Border Protection (\"CBP\") pulled over and arrested \n17 \nMigrant Justice members Esau Peche Ventura and Yesenia Hernandez Ramos.  The arrest occurred \n18 \non the same day that Peche Ventura and Hernandez Ramos had marched thirteen miles to show their \n19 \nsupport for the rights of workers in Migrant Justice's march from Montpelier to the Ben & Jerry's \n20 \nfactory in Waterbury, Vermont, in support of the campaign for the Milk with Dignity Program. \n21 \n104.  CBP agents pulled over Peche Ventura and Hernandez Ramos's vehicle without \n22 \nexplicit or evident cause.  CBP arrested Peche Ventura and Hernandez Ramos and searched their \n23 \nvehicle.  CBP transferred Peche Ventura and Hernandez Ramos to ICE custody.  ICE held them for \n24 \nseveral days. \n25 \n105.  By the morning of June 19, 2017, internal ICE documents reveal that ICE understood \n26 \nthat it lacked sufficient cause to continue detaining Peche Ventura and Hernandez Ramos, stating in \n27 \nan internal email. \"I have asked [redacted] to reach out to BP to see if there is anything they can do to \n28 \ngive us legally sufficient cases so we can move forward.\"  Even though ICE knew that it lacked a \n18 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 19 of 41\nlegally sufficient reason to continue to hold them, ICE did not release them but instead requested the \n2  DMV records of Peche Ventura and CBP visited their place of employment in search of evidence to \n3  support their continued detention. \n4  106.  Over the course of the day on June 19, 2017, the DMV provided ICE with Peche \n5  Ventura's DPC application along with identifying vehicular information. \n6  107.  Also on June 19, 2017, a delegation of Migrant Justice members and allies protested at \n7  the ICE office in St. Albans, Vermont.  Migrant Justice members demanded that ICE explain why it \n8  had arrested individuals with no criminal records. \n9  108.  During the protest, ICE agents recognized and identified several members by name. \n10  One ICE agent specifically pointed to and threatened some of the Individual Plaintiffs with detention. \n11  The agent called out Plaintiffs by name-''Kike [Balcazar], Zully [Palacios], [and] Victor \n12  [Garcia], \"-and stated \"you are putting your bond at risk.\"  This statement was intended to chill \n13  Plaintiffs' speech. \n14  109.  ICE officers also accessed Migrant Justice social media pages to track and monitor \n15  advocacy campaigns on Peche Ventura's and Hernandez Ramos's behalf.  ICE identified Migrant \nI 6  Justice's protest in St. Albans as an \"ICE Significant Incident.\" \n17  7.  ICE Selectively Revealed that It Was Surveilling Migrant Justice in Order \nto Intimidate and Chill Its Activities. \n18 \n110.  In addition to the arrests, ICE selectively revealed information that it was surveilling \n19 \nMigrant Justice in order to intimidate and chill Plaintiffs' protected activities. \n20 \n111.  For example, Migrant Justice assemblies are not open to the general public.  The \n21 \norganization shares the locations, dates, and times of its meetings only with members and known \n22 \nsupporters.  However, in February 2017, a Migrant Justice supporter and community leader called the \n23 \nICE St. Albans office to ask questions about ICE's policies and practices relating to the detention of \n24 \nchildren.  Instead of answering her questions, the ICE Supervising Deportation and Detention Officer \n25 \nasked the Migrant Justice ally whether she was asking the questions in preparation for the Migrant \n26 \nJustice meeting, which he referenced by date and stated the exact location of the assembly-neither \n27 \nof which had been made public. \n28 \n19 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 20 of 41\n112.  ICE arrests of Migrant Justice members continue, and ICE's surveillance of Migrant \n2  Justice also likely continues. \n3  113.  As recently as October 25, 2018, CBP arrested Migrant Justice member Eli Calvo \n4  Cruz.  ICE then ordered Calvo Cruz detained on a $14,000 bond, even though an immigration judge \n5  in an earlier proceeding had set Calvo Cruz's bond at $4,500 and had administratively closed his \n6  immigration case. \n7  114.  Migrant Justice organized a public campaign in support of Calvo Cruz's bond hearing, \n8  collecting nearly 1,300 signatures and writing letters of support.  On November 9, 2018, an \n9  immigration judge released Calvo Cruz on $1,500 bond. \n10  8.  Defendants Have Significantly Chilled the Speech of Plaintiffs, Caused \nLasting Harm, and Forced Migrant Justice to Divert Resources. \n11 \n115.  Migrant Justice's members-Plaintiff and non-Plaintiff members alike-have an \n12 \nimmediate fear of reprisal and share a ubiquitous sentiment of being watched.  Migrant Justice is \n13 \nconcerned that, as certain private meetings have been surveilled, public protests and marches in the \n14 \nfuture will be as well.  Migrant Justice has had to modify and limit certain programming.  Migrant \n15 \nJustice has forgone certain opportunities to advocate on behalf of its members and to advocate for \n16 \neconomic and workplace rights.  Defendants' conduct has hampered Migrant Justice's ability to reach \n17 \na broad and vulnerable audience and has caused a significant chill of free speech. \n18 \n116.  Defendants' unlawful conduct has taken a significant toll on Migrant Justice and its \n19 \nmembership.  The effects of Defendants' conduct manifest in four primary ways:  (1) Plaintiffs and \n20 \nother non-Plaintiff members are fearful of further retaliation and now proceed more cautiously, \n21 \nincluding forgoing certain speaking opportunities for fear of reprisal; (2) as a result, Migrant Justice \n22 \nis less effective, and is able to draw fewer attendees, less support, and lower enthusiasm; (3) Migrant \n23 \nJustice has been forced to shift its efforts from advocacy focused on advancing workplace rights to \n24 \nadvocacy focused on defending against retaliatory immigration enforcement; and (4) Defendants \n25 \nhave forced Migrant Justice to outlay significant time, resources, and finances as a result. \n26 \n1 17 .  Defendants' unlawful conduct continues to exert a substantial chilling effect upon the \n27 \norganization and its members and continues to undennine Migrant Justice's advocacy.  Given ICE's \n28 \nextensive surveillance and infiltration, Plaintiffs expect ongoing harassment and targeting of their \n20 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 21 of 41\nFirst Amendment activities.  As a result, Migrant Justice has had to take extensive and costly \n2  precautions, limiting its overall reach to the community.  For example, when the organization hosts \n3  meetings, it must implement a watch system around the state to prevent ICE from following and \n4  surveilling members' vehicles. \n5  118.  Migrant Justice leader Marita Canedo has limited her interaction with other members \n6  since she learned that ICE was surveilling her car, discussed infra Jr 129: she no longer provides \n7  members transportation, which significantly hinders her ability to connect with workers; she fears \n8  that ICE will target any member with whom she associates and avoids major roads when driving. \n9  119.  Migrant Justice believes that the infonnant is still infiltrating its membership to this \n10  very day.  In the weeks before this complaint was filed, the informant attended a Migrant Justice \n1 1  event and began recording video while she was there, despite explicit requests to attendees not to \n12  record video or post to social media.  Moreover, internal documents from the OMV and ICE indicate \n13  that the OMV is still sending ICE sensitive information to facilitate ICE's enforcement of civil \n14  immigration law. \n15  120.  Each Plaintiff expresses concern and fear of further retaliation, including surveillance, \n16  harassment, and summary arrest and detention.  Each Plaintiff asserts that though he or she remains a \n17  member of Migrant Justice and continues to engage in political speech, he or she proceeds more \n18  anxiously and fearfully than before Defendants' unlawful conduct and that his or her speech has been \n19  chilled. \n20  121.  This too is true of many non-Plaintiff Migrant Justice members.  Additionally, many \n21  migrant workers express hesitation to join Migrant Justice-initiated protests, rallies, or marches \n22  because they fear they will be detained for organizing and associating with the organization. \n23  122.  As a result of Defendants' unlawful surveillance, harassment, arrest, and detention, \n24  Plaintiff Garcia Diaz suffers from significant anxiety, sadness, and difficulty concentrating.  He \n25  believes that Defendants continue to track his movements and surveil him during meetings, protests, \n26  and community events.  He worries every time he participates in Migrant Justice activities.  His \n27  speech and associational rights have been chilled. \n28 \n21 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 22 of 41\n123.  As a result of Defendants· unlawful surveillance, harassment, arrest, and detention. \n2  Plaintiff Alcudia Gamas suffers from significant anxiety, sleeplessness, and frequent headaches.  He \n3  believes that Defendants continue to track his movements and surveil him during meetings, protests, \n4  and community events.  His speech and associational rights have been chilled. \n5  124.  As a result of Defendants' unlawful surveillance, harassment, arrest, and detention, \n6  Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez suffers from significant anxiety, difficulty sleeping and concentrating, and \n7  a sense of dread and paranoia that causes him to alert his friends and family as to his whereabouts at \n8  all times because of fear.  He believes that Defendants continue to track his movements and surveil \n9  him during meetings, protests, and community events.  He also believes ICE is monitoring his social \n10  media profiles.  His speech and associational rights have been chilled. \n11  125.  As a result of Defendants' unlawful surveillance, harassment, arrest, and detention, \n12  Plaintiff Palacios Rodriguez lives in a constant state of fear that ICE will arrest her and send her to \n13  jail at any moment.  She suffers from significant anxiety, lack of sleep, lack of appetite, nightmares, \n14  and a sense of despair and sadness that causes her to burst into tears without provocation.  She \n15  believes that Defendants continue to track her movements and surveil her during meetings, protests, \n16  and community events.  She also believes Defendants may be monitoring her private electronic \n17  communications, as well as her social media profiles.  Her speech and associational rights have been \n18  chilled. \n19  126.  By decreasing willingness of Vermont residents to risk association with the \n20  organization's viewpoints and advocacy efforts, Migrant Justice's ability to effectuate its labor \n21  organizing efforts has been diminished. \n22  127.  Defendants' conduct has significantly deterred members' participation and attendance \n23  at Migrant Justice events.  On average, assembly participation has dropped by approximately one-\n24  half.  Members have reported fearing retaliation by Defendants and citing the ongoing ICE actions \n25  against Plaintiffs specifically. \n26  128.  The closer in time to a recent arrest or detention an assembly or event was planned, the \n27  lower the attendance.  For example, only ten Migrant Justice members attended the March 23, 2017, \n28  assembly in Morrisville, Vermont, held six days after Plaintiffs Balcazar Sanchez's and Palacios \n22 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 23 of 41\nRodriguez's arrests, although approximately twenty-five had originally stated they intended to \n2  participate.  At least seven Migrant Justice members called to cancel their attendance at the assembly \n3  in the days following the arrests.  Additional members expected to participate did not attend, and \n4  many community organizers and advocates were notably absent.  Likewise, Defendants' conduct \n5  hampered Migrant Justice's ability to recruit new employees and gamer community support. \n6  129.  Migrant Justice's Women's Group met monthly in 2015 and 2016, but stopped \n7  meeting for two years due to members' fears about ICE and law enforcement activity, specifically the \n8  arrests of Plaintiffs Garcia Diaz and Alcudia Gamas.  Migrant Justice members widely understood \n9  that ICE was surveilling Women's Group leader Marita Canedo, which referenced her \"red car\" on a \n10  number of occasions, a fact confinned by the informant. \n11  130.  Defendants' conduct has caused a number of Vermont-based farm owners to \n12  discourage their employees from participating in Migrant Justice activities for fear that their workers \n13  would be detained.  Further, fearing that advocacy would draw unwarranted attention from federal \n14  authorities and many of their employees would be arrested, many farm owners are reluctant to \n15  participate in the Milk with Dignity Program.  This reluctance has protracted negotiations with \n16  companies such as Ben & Jerry's and continues to hinder the operation of the program and its \n17   expansion to cover more farmworkers. \n18  131.  As a result of Defendants' speech suppression, Migrant Justice has had to divert away \n19  from priorities such as Milk with Dignity and redirect them towards combatting unconstitutional \n20  immigration practices.  ICE's activities have forced Migrant Justice to devote significant time and \n21  resources to activities such as advocating for bond reductions for its indigent members and taking \n22  other measures to mitigate the harmful impact of the chilling of individual members' willingness to \n23  continue to associate with the organization. \n24  132.  Migrant Justice has had to divert a significant portion of their time to immigration-\n25  defense related work, specifically combatting the DMV's discriminatory treatment against \n26  immigrants, addressing ICE-based retaliatory arrests and surveillance practices, creating national \n27  organizing and advocacy campaigns for their aggrieved members, and countless others.  A significant \n28 \n23 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 24 of 41\nportion of staff time has been diverted away from labor-based advocacy to immigration-related work \n2  due to Defendants' conduct. \n3  133.  Members have also been forced to spend significant time training and protecting \n4  members and leaders from ICE targeting and retaliation.  These measures include preventative \n5  measures, ranging from drafting, developing, and implementing emergency plans, to know-your-\n6  rights trainings, among others. \n7  134.  In addition, Defendants' unlawful retaliation and suppression of free speech has \n8  caused Migrant Justice financial losses.  Migrant Justice regularly serves as obligor for its members' \n9  bond payments while they are in immigration detention.  For instance, Migrant Justice advanced \n10  funds to post bond of $6,000.00 each for members Peche Ventura and Hernandez Ramos.  Migrant \n11  Justice also posts funds into detained members' commissary funds to allow them to purchase \n12  sufficient food while detained and provide transportation for detained individuals once released. \n13  13 5.  The costs attendant to combating and mitigating Defendants' unconstitutional conduct \n14  extend beyond bond payments.  As the immigration judge overseeing Plaintiffs Balcazar Sanchez's \n15  and Palacios Rodriguez's cases observed, advocacy in support of detained members was a strong \n16  factor supporting their release.  Thus, to allow its members the opportunity to post bail, Migrant \n17  Justice has to organize rallies, protests, and marches in support of its detained members.  Costs \n18  associated with these efforts include-but are not limited to-significant staff time, printing costs, \n19  and travel to and from protests which often are located outside of the Boston Immigration Court, \n20  including costs associated with rental cars, charter buses, gas, and mileage reimbursement. \n21  136.  As a result of Defendants' unlawful conduct, Migrant Justice has been forced to \n22  expend significant financial resources, affecting the organization's operating budget, impairing its \n23  ability to function effectively, and creating tangible and articulable damages. \n24  9.  ICE Targets Activists Around the Country for Speaking Out. \n25  137.  ICE's efforts to undern1ine Migrant Justice are part of a pattern of ICE expending \n26  significant resources to target, surveil, arrest, and detain immigrant activists and leaders across the \n27  country in response to their protected political speech and activity. \n28 \n24 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 25 of 41\n13 8.  Since 2016, ICE has arrested no fewer than twenty high-profile immigrant activist \n2  leaders for their political activism and public speech, including the following individuals: \n3 \n•  On March 2, 2017, ICE arrested Daniela Vargas of Mississippi, Deferred Action \n4 \nfor Childhood Arrivals (\"DACA\") recipient, after she spoke publicly about ICE \nraiding her family's home and arresting her brother and father. \n5 \n6  •  On May 18, 2017, CBP arrested Claudia Rueda of California, an immigrant rights \nactivist and college student, after she spoke out publicly about her mother's arrest. \n7 \n•  In November 27, 2017, ICE arrested Baltazar Aburto Gutierrez of Washington \n8 \nafter he spoke to a local journalist.  During the arrest, an ICE agent told him '•you \nare the one from the newspaper.\" \n9 \n10  •  On December 20, 2017, ICE arrested Maru Mora Villalpando of Washington, a \nlongtime activist and founder of the Northwest Detention Center Resistance. \n11  \n•  On January 3, 2018, ICE arrested Jean Montrevil ofNew York, a longstanding \n12 \nactivist with the New Sanctuary Coalition.  He was deported less than two weeks \nlater, on January 16, 2018. \n13 \n14  •  On January 11, 2018, ICE arrested Ravi Ragbir of New York, a longstanding \nactivist with and Executive Director of the New Sanctuary Coalition.  Ragbir has \n15 \nsince won a stay of removal from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals while his \ncase is appealed. \n16 \n17  •  On January 11, 2018, ICE arrested Eliseo Jurado of Colorado, the husband of \nIngrid Encalada Latorre, a leader in Colorado's sanctuary movement who gained \n18  media attention after she sought sanctuary from detention in a local church. \n19 \n•  On March 7, 2018, ICE arrested Alejandra Pablos of Virginia, a permanent \nresident, after she helped lead a protest in Virginia outside of a DHS office. \n20 \nPablos is a longstanding immigrant activist and field coordinator for the National \n21  Latina Institute for Reproductive Health. \n22  •  In early April 2018, ICE detained Manuel Duran, a Memphis, Tennessee-based \njournalist at the Memphis Noticias newspaper, who has a long history of \n23 \npublicizing reports critical of federal immigration practices. \n24 \n•  On July 24, 2018, in Racine Wisconsin, ICE arrested community leader Ricardo \n25  Fierro, the Council President of the local League of United Latin American \nCitizens (\"LULAC\"). \n26 \n139.  On January 26, 2018, thirty-one members of Congress sent a letter to ICE and OHS \n27 \nexpressing concern about the agencies' targeting of activists, which they explained \"may create a \n28 \nbroader chilling effect within the community, dissuading some immigrants from invoking their legal \n25 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 26 of 41\nrights for fear that doing so will result in retaliation by ICE.\"  On March 22, 2018, four members of \n2  Congress sent a letter to ICE expressing concern about retaliation against activists, stating that ''the \n3  use oflaw enforcement resources to retaliate against critics and political opponents of the President is \n4  contrary to our most basic democratic norms.\" \n5  140.  These arrests reflect an even broader expressed antipathy toward individuals, entities, \n6  and states who choose to challenge the administration's aggressive and intentionally intimidating \n7  enforcement practices.  Retaliatory arrests actively continue around the United States. \n8 \nC.  The DMV Has a Policy, Pattern, or Practice of Sharing Information with ICE, \nMotivated by Animus Against Latinos and Other Non-White People. \n9 \n141.  OMV has had a long-standing policy, pattern, and practice of permitting its staff to \n10 \n11  routinely and regularly share information with ICE and Border Patrol and to actively seek to facilitate \n12  the immigration enforcement activities of those two agencies. \n13 \n142.  This information-sharing has included passing along information about individuals \n14 \nthat OMV staff believed to be in the country unlawfully and responding to informal ICE requests for \n15 \ninformation about individuals, such as their Driver's Privilege Card application and supporting \n16 \ndocumentation or vehicle registration. \n17 \n143.  Beyond providing information, OMV also cooperated by scheduling appointments and \n18 \n19  driver's tests around ICE's availability, requiring drivers to come to the DMV office unnecessarily. \n20 \nor imposing criminal charges for the purpose of exposing an individual to greater risk of immigration \n21 \nenforcement. \n22 \n144.  Many of these fonns of cooperation were instrumental in the arrests and detention of \n23 \nthe individual Plaintiffs. \n24 \n145.  OMV staff specifically targeted Latinos for these practices: DPC applicants and \n25 \n26  holders with Latino surnames were far more likely to have their information shared with ICE than \n27  those with non-Latino surnames, despite there being more than.four times as many OPC holders and \n28 \napplicants than there are Latinos in Vermont. \n26 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 27 of 41\n146.  The policy, pattern, and practice exhibited by DMV staff and permitted by the DMV \n2 \nrepresented a long-standing and deep-seated animus toward Latinos and non-white individuals, and \n3 \nare therefore perceived by DMV staff as ·'foreign,\" due to their physical appearance, surname, or \n4 \naccent. \n5 \n147.  For example, DMV employees frequently highlighted the race of individuals whom \n6 \nthey intended to investigate or referred to them as •'immigrants\" and \"illegals.\" For instance, in a \n7 \n8  December 2, 2014 email to a supervisor, DMV Investigator Jonathan Purdy recounted how he \n9  noticed people who \"appeared (illegal)\" and '·three people loitering outside (who appeared Mexican)\" \n10 \nat the DMV and called ICE agents' attention to these individuals to investigate.  In the same email, a \n11 \nDMV Investigator gratuitously noted that another DMV employee told him '·she had a Mexican at \n12 \nher window who wanted to schedule a permit test.\" \n13 \n148.  In another example, a DMV communication made light of the discrimination: in a \n14 \nNovember 7, 2014 email, a DMV employee sarcastically remarked to a DMV Investigator:  \"I don't \n15 \n16  want to discriminate, I don't dare!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'' (fifty-three \n17 \nexclamation points in original). \n18 \n149.  That DMV knew of and permitted the discriminatory conduct is without question. \n19 \nDMV employees' disproportionate focus on race and perceived ethnicity was evident across a broad \n20 \nswath of communications received or viewed by supervisors.  As early as October 2014, one DMV \n21 \nofficer included ICE contact regarding \"another possible illegal'' in a \"Weekly Report'' he wrote as a \n22 \n23  member of the DMV Investigation Division. \n24  150.  DMV supervisors also frequently received direct emails evidencing the animus and \n25 \ndiscriminatory intent.  For example, on October 30, 2014, and many times thereafter, OMV Officer \n26 \nPurdy emailed OMV Supervisor Mclntyre--a DMV supervisor-about forwarding information to \n27 \nICE officers.  He emailed her again on November 7, 2014 to express frustration with the DPC \n28 \n27 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 28 of 41\nprogram and to infonn her that he forwarded ''a rather large list to ICE,\" writing that he understood \n2 \nthe purpose of the DPC program was to ·'accommodate illegal farm workers,\" but that \"it doesn't \n3 \nappear to me these are farm workers!\"  In that same email, Purdy asked McIntyre why the state is \n4 \n·'turning a blind eye toward illegals.\"  And McIntyre received Purdy's email referring to people at the \n5 \nDMV who \"'appeared illegal\" and '\"appeared Mexican.\" \n6 \n151.  Additional emails from this time period demonstrate DMV' s association of ethnicity \n7 \n8  and race with immigration status, and fixation on the perceived immigration status of DPC \n9  applicants.  For example, on December 4, 2014, a DMV employee wrote to a colleague in response to \n10 \nan exchange about compiling a list of addresses and residents, ''Holy crap is right, we are being over \n11 \nrun [sic] by immigrants.\"  Another DMV employee noted that mail from one of the investigated \n12 \naddresses was \"all [a ddressed to] 'South of the Border' names.\" \n13 \n152.  DMV staff would also regularly and routinely open investigations-including \n14 \ncontacting ICE-for no apparent reason other than the fact that the applicant presented a document \n15 \n16  from a Latin American country as identification or otherwise appeared \"foreign\" because they were \n17 \nnon-white.  In one case in July 2016, a DMV employee admitted that \"We don't have a violation of \n18 \nthe DPC law,'\" but sent the driver's information to ICE anyway.  In another instance, in February \n19 \n2016, a DMV employee sent a name to an ICE Agent and asked ICE \"to check the guy for federal \n20 \nwarrants. deportation orders, etc.,'' despite there being no appearance of a violation.  When ICE \n21 \nresponded that the applicant had lawful immigration status, the DMV employee then facilitated \n22 \n23  checking the applicant's brother. \n24  153.  On September 23, 2016, a DMV investigator emailed to his supervisors a list of his \n25 \ninvestigations broken down by race.  The suspects of his investigations were disproportionately \n26 \nLatino.  Of 11 \"Total Persons Encountered\" between April 1 and September 23, 2016, the list notes \n27 \n\"10 Hispanic, 1 Caucasian,'' and a similar ratio of \"8 Hispanic, 1 Caucasian\" for investigations that \n28 \n28 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 29 of 41\nresulted in ''Suspend/Cancel,\" meaning the DPCs issued to the persons investigated were either \n2 \nsuspended or their issuance canceled.  That breakdown, though anecdotal, stands in sharp contrast to \n3 \nthe breakdown of Vermont's population.  Only about 10,900 Vermonters identify as ''Hispanic or \n4 \nLatino (of any race),\" while 585,154 people-93.4% of the total Vermont population-identify as \n5 \n''White alone, not Hispanic or Latino.\" \n6 \n154.  DMV's conduct motivated by prejudice against non-white individuals particularly \n7 \n8  Latinos, was so pervasive that, in an Investigative Report dated November 10, 2015, the Vermont \n9  Human Rights Commission found reasonable cause to believe that OMV engaged in discriminatory \n10 \npractices.  These practices included falsifying information on an individual's OPC application by \n11 \nchecking a box for \"proof of legal status\" which the individual had left blank and then investigating \n12 \nhim for purportedly providing that false information.  The OMV applied its investigatory and referral \n13 \npolicy-which the Report characterized as ··vague\"-in a discriminatory fashion. \n14 \n155.  The Human Rights Commission found that the DMV had worked to entrap the same \n15 \n16  individual and facilitate his arrest into ICE custody.  The report noted specifically that the DMV's \n17 \nconduct-routing a DPC applicant into ICE custody because of their suspected immigration status \n18 \nwas \"at odds with the very intent of the [Driver Privilege Card] law,'\" thereby engaging in \"exactly \n19 \nthe thing that the DPC law was designed to prevent.'' (emphasis in original).  The Commission \n20 \nconcluded that \"no white citizen [Driver Privilege Card] applicants have ever been referred [to \n21 \nimmigration officials] for investigation,\" while many non-white individuals had been, and that the \n22 \n23  DMV was \"markedly hostile and objectively unreasonable'' to the claimant \"because of [his] status \n24  as a non-white [] person [of Middle Eastern ethnicity].'' \n25 \n156.  On July 11, 2016, responding to the Human Rights Commission's investigations, \n26 \nNancy Prescott, OMV Branch Operations Manager, instructed OMV employees by email that they \n27 \n\"shouldn't be contacting homeland/ice at any point without being advised.\" [sic] \n28 \n29 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 30 of 41\n1  157.  On August 25, 2016, the OMV entered a settlement agreement to resolve the \n2 \ninvestigation concerning the pervasive anti-immigrant bias (''Settlement Agreement\"). \n3 \n158.  The Settlement Agreement, inter alia, sharply restricted the DMV's ability to transmit \n4 \na DPC applicant's information to ICE.  For instance, Section 2 of the Settlement Agreement provides: \n5 \n·'That subject to the provisions of the Drivers' Privacy Protection Act, absent subpoena or a criminal \n6 \nwarrant, OPC information contained on Applications shall be confidential including but not limited to \n7 \n8  information related to legal presence, or national origin.\" \n9  159.  The Drivers' Privacy Protection Act does not require the DMV to share confidential \n10 \ninformation with ICE for immigration enforcement purposes. \n11 \n160.  The prohibition extends beyond immigration status to other aspects of the application, \n12 \nsuch as the form itself and information accompanying the form, such as photos and vehicle \n13 \nregistration information.  The settlement agreement also required DMV \"to adopt the essential \n14 \nelements of the Model Fair & Impartial Policing ('FIP') policy as adopted by the Vermont Criminal \n15 \n16  Justice Training Council [ ] as well as all of the non-essential elements [n  ot listed here].''  The FIP \n17 \npolicy that OMV was required to adopt included the following provisions: \n18 \n•  \"Federal law does not grant local and state agencies authority to enforce civil immigration \n19 \nlaw.  Similarly, state law does not grant local and state agencies authority to enforce \n20 \nimmigration laws .... The DMV shall not dedicate time or resources to the enforcement \n21 \no_ffederal immigration law where the only violation oflaw is presence in the United States \n22 \n23  without authorization or documentation.'' (emphasis added). \n24 \n•  Similarly, DMV officials \"shall not facilitate the detention of undocumented individuals \n25 \nor individuals suspected of being undocumented by federal immigration authorities for \n26 \nsuspected civil immigration violations.'' \n27 \n28 \n30 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 31 of 41\n1  161.  In a memorandum dated January 31, 2017, Michael A. Smith, DMV Director of \n2 \nOperations, relayed the terms of the settlement to all DMV staff statewide.  The memo directed: ·'DO \n3 \nNOT run [immigration status] checks on undocumented applicants,\" regardless of the documentation \n4 \nsubmitted. \n5 \n162.  Yet, notwithstanding entering into the Settlement Agreement and issuing this \n6 \nguidance, DMV staff still engage in a policy, pattern, and practice of anti-immigrant animus and \n7 \n8  DMV leadership does not ensure that staff refrain from discriminatory conduct. \n9  163.  For example, staff continue to share information and otherwise cooperate with ICE \n10 \neven when such cooperation is contrary to agency policy.  In April 2017, a DMV investigator told \n11 \nSeven Days, a Vermont news publication, that the settlement and FIP policy ''doesn't make any \n12 \ndifference\" for his work. He also stated: \"I'm not familiar with the settlement because, really, I don't \n13 \nhave any interest with the settlement.'' \n14 \n164.  Further, in 2017, DMV staff shared information with immigration enforcement \n15 \n16  agencies about the following Individual Plaintiffs and Migrant Justice members: \n17 \n•  On March 9, 2017, a DMV employee sent the license plate information for Plaintiff \nBalcazar Sanchez to an ICE Officer. \n18 \n19  •  On March 13, 2017, a DMV employee transmitted Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez's DPC \napplication to an ICE Officer.  In the margins of the application, a DMV employee had \n20  written the words \"UNDOCUMENTED'' and \"PRIVILEGE CARD.'' The DMV also \n,r \nprovided other personally identifying documents.  See supra,  85. \n21 \n22  •  On March 15, 2017, ICE arrested Migrant Justice member Carrillo Sanchez.  The 1-\n213 that ICE wrote for Carrillo Sanchez notes that ICE determined his alienage \n23  through his Vermont DMV DPC application, including a copy of his Mexican \npassport and his Mexican birth certificate. The DMV would have transmitted this \n24  ,r \ninformation to ICE on or about March 2017.  See supra,  72. \n25 \n•  On June 19, 2017, a DMV employee provided information about Migrant Justice \nmember Peche Ventura's DPC application and vehicular information to ICE officials. \n26 \n,r \nSee supra,  I 06. \n27 \n28 \n31 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 32 of 41\n165.  Recent public records requests confirm that DMV staff continues a pattern and \n2 \npractice of sharing information with ICE and Border Patrol motivated by a dislike of non-white \n3 \nindividuals, and Latinos in particular. \n4 \n166.  Records obtained via a public records request in 2018 show that DMV continued to \n5 \nrespond to ICE inquiries, voluntarily providing ICE with confidential information including photos, \n6 \ncar registration information, and copies of applications.  The routine nature of these communications \n7 \n8  suggests a regular, ongoing practice. \n9  167.  Furthermore, after the publication of emails between ICE and OMV in October 2016, \n10 \nwhich painted the OMV in a critical light, OMV employees have chosen to limit their electronic mail \n11 \ncommunications and have undertaken to communicate with ICE via telephone. For example, after the \n12 \nSettlement Agreement, in a December 1, 2016 email, a OMV investigator forwarded his emails with \n13 \nICE in response to a public records request, noting that \"[m]ost of my interactions [with ICE] have \n14 \nbeen via phone.'' \n15 \n16  168.  This ongoing cooperation between the OMV, ICE, and CBP is enabled by OMV \n17 \nsupervisors who tum a blind eye to the discriminatory conduct of their staff.  There are only four \n18 \nCriminal Investigators in the OMV Investigations Unit, overseen by two Criminal Unit Supervisors \n19 \nand a Chief Inspector.  Given the pattern of information-sharing by OMV officers, as well as OMV \n20 \nofficers' documented animus against Latinos and other non-white individuals-in some instances \n21 \ndocumented in emails to OMV supervisors-OMV supervisors know of or should know of the \n22 \n23  ongoing constitutional violations. \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n32 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 33 of 41\nCOUNT ONE \nVIOLATION OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT \n2 \nOF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION \n(INTERFERENCE WITH FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION) \n3 \n(All Plaintiffs against OHS Defendants) \n4 \n5 \n169.  The right to expressive association •'is implicit in the right to engage in activities \n6 \nprotected by the First Amendment.\"  Roberts v. Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 622 (1984).

Dale, 530 U.S. 640,648 (2000). \n9 \n1 70.  Plaintiffs have engaged and continue to engage in protected speech and conduct. \n10 \nIndividual Plaintiffs, through their membership in Migrant Justice, have engaged and continue to \n11  \nengage in political activism and advocacy against discriminatory government practices. A key part of \n12 \ntheir activism is meeting with other migrant workers to discuss and analyze shared problems and to \n13 \nenvision collective solutions.  Plaintiff Migrant Justice continues its efforts to encourage greater \n14 \nnumbers of migrant workers in Vermont to join the organization and advocate for their rights. \n15 \n171.  By targeting, surveilling, infiltrating, and engaging in disinformation towards Migrant \n16 \nJustice members, Defendants directly and substantially interfere with Individual Plaintiffs' ability to \n17 \nassociate with Migrant Justice and with Migrant Justice and its members' ability to join together. \n18 \nDefendants have caused a significant chill oflndividual Plaintiffs' and Migrant Justice's members' \n19 \nrights to associate.  Defendants' comments that associate immigration enforcement with Migrant \n20 \nJustice activity and their ongoing surveillance and infiltration, have instilled in Plaintiffs and other \n21 \nmembers and potential members ongoing fear of reprisal that has limited Plaintiffs' ability to \n22 \nassociate freely. \n23 \n172.  Plaintiffs-Migrant Justice on its own behalf and on behalf of its membership, as well \n24 \nas all Individual Plaintiffs-wish to continue engaging in their First Amendment-protected activities \n25 \nto the fullest extent possible, but, as a result of Defendants' past, present, and likely future conduct, \n26 \nare deterred from doing so. \n27 \n28 \n33 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 34 of 41\n173.  Defendants' targeting, infiltration. disinformation campaign, and surveillance of \n2  Migrant Justice serves no compelling governmental interest.  Nor does it reflect the least restrictive \n3  means of engaging in immigration enforcement activities. \n4  174.  Defendants' actions cause Plaintiffs significant harm, including chilling Plaintiffs' \n5  speech, frustrating Migrant Justice's mission, causing Migrant Justice to divert significant resources, \n6  as well as financial harm. \n7  175.  Individual Plaintiffs have reason to fear that ICE may take continued action that \n8  infringes on their associational rights, for example by revoking their bond for participation in Migrant \n9  Justice activities. \nCOUNT TWO \n10 \nVIOLATION OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT \nOF THE UNITED ST A TES CONSTITUTION \n11 \n(FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND FREEDOM TO PETITION) \n12  (All Plaintiffs against DHS Defendants) \n176.

Plaintiffs have engaged and continue to engage in protected speech and conduct. \n19  Individual Plaintiffs, through their membership in Migrant Justice, Inc., have engaged and continue to \n20  engage in protected speech including, but not limited to, Migrant Justice's continuous political \n21  activism and advocacy to safeguard the right to freedom of movement and access to transportation, to \n22  freedom from discrimination, and to improved living and working conditions.  Plaintiffs' activism \n23  has included petitioning elected officials to intervene and government agencies to provide relief \n24  against discriminatory government practices. \n25  178.  Defendants are engaged in a campaign of targeting, surveilling, infiltrating, providing \n26  disinfonnation, arresting, and detaining Migrant Justice and its members, including Individual \n27  Plaintiffs, that goes beyond legitimate law enforcement and surveillance activities. \n28 \n34 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 35 of 41\n179.  Defendants engagement in these activities undermines Migrant Justice's efforts and \n2  abridges Migrant Justice and its members' ability to engage in protected speech and petition \n3  activities. \n4  180.  Defendants actions inhibit reasonable migrant workers from fully exercising their \n5  rights to engage in speech and to petition the government. \n6  181.  Defendants actions have significantly affected Plaintiffs' ability to advocate their \n7  viewpoints and have caused a significant chill of Plaintiffs' rights to speak freely and petition the \n8  government under the First Amendment.  Defendants' targeting, surveillance, and harassment, \n9  actions would not have occurred but for Plaintiffs' protected speech. \n10  182.  Plaintiffs-Migrant Justice on its own behalf and on behalf of its membership, as well \n11  as all the Individual Plaintiffs-wish to continue engaging in their First Amendment-protected \n12  activities to the fullest extent possible, but, as a result of Defendants' past, present, and likely future \n13  conduct, are deterred from doing so. \n14  183.  Defendants cause Plaintiffs significant harm, including chilling Plaintiffs' speech, \n15  frustrating Migrant Justice's mission, causing Migrant Justice to divert significant resources, as well \n16  as financial harm. \nCOUNT THREE \n17 \nVIOLATION OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT \nOF THE UNITED ST A TES CONSTITUTION \n18 \n(RETALIATION) \n19  (Migrant Justice against all OHS Defendants) \n20  184.  To prevail on a First Amendment retaliation claim, a plaintiff must show \"( 1) that the \n21  speech or conduct at issue was protected, (2) that the defendant took adverse action against the \n22  plaintiff, and (3) that there was a causal connection between the protected speech and the adverse \n23  action.''

Migrant Justice has engaged and continues to engage in protected speech and conduct. \n25  Its members have engaged and continue to engage in political activism and advocacy against \n26  discriminatory government practices. \n27 \n28 \n35 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 36 of 41\n186.  By targeting, surveilling, infiltrating, and spreading disinformation to Migrant Justice \n2  members, Defendants significantly affect the organization's ability to advocate its viewpoints and \n3  hinder Migrant Justice's ability to advocate for economic protections for migrant farmworkers. \n4  187.  Defendants' prior retaliatory conduct, including but not limited to surveillance and \n5  infiltration, have instilled in Migrant Justice's members an ongoing fear ofreprisal that has limited \n6  the ability of its members to speak and associate freely and has therefore chilled the organization's \n7  speech as a whole.  Migrant Justice's First Amendment-protected activity motivates Defendants' \n8  targeting, surveillance, infiltration, and disinformation activities, which would not occur but for the \n9  organization's protected speech. \n10  188.  Migrant Justice wishes to continue engaging in its First Amendment-protected \n11  activities to the fullest extent possible, but, as a result of Defendants' past, present, and likely future \n12  conduct, the organization has been deterred from being able to do so. \n13  189.

This information-sharing disproportionately targets and impacts non-white and Latino \n23 \nresidents, and arises out of pervasive animus within the Vermont OMV against such individuals. \n24 \n192.  By sharing personally identifying information in this way and with this motivation, \n25 \n26  Defendants deny Plaintiffs equal protection of the laws. U.S. Const., Amend. XIV,§ 1. \n27  193.  The OMV were motivated by animus against non-white and Latino individuals. \n28 \n36 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 37 of 41\n1  COUNT FIVE \nVIOLATION OF THE FEDERAL TORT CLAIMS ACT 28 U.S.C. § 2671 \n2 \n(INVASION OF PRIVACY:  INTRUSION ON SECLUSION) \n(All Plaintiffs against Defendant United States) \n3 \n194.  Plaintiff Migrant Justice asserts this claim on behalf of its membership. \n4 \n195.  Plaintiffs adequately exhausted their administrative remedies as required under 28 \n5 \nU.S.C. § 2675 by filing federal tort claims against OHS on the basis of the incidents alleged.  OHS \n6 \ndenied all claims by letters dated June 11, 2018. \n7 \n196.  By committing the above-described acts, including but not limited to enlisting an \n8 \ninformant to surveil Plaintiffs at non-public meetings and in private spaces, eavesdropping on private \n9 \nconversations and engaging in physical surveillance and harassment, Defendants committed a \n10 \nsubstantial and highly offensive interference within Plaintiffs' solitude. \n11 \n197.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's breaches of duties, Plaintiffs have \n12 \nsuffered and continue to suffer damages. \n13 \n198.  Plaintiffs are entitled to damages against the United States for invasion of privacy to \n14 \nthe full extent allowed under Vermont law and the FTCA, in an amount to be determined by the trier \n15 \nof fact. \n16 \n199.  Under the Federal Tort Claims Act, defendant United States of America is liable for \n17 \nthese actions. \n18 \nCOUNT SIX \n19  VIOLATION OF THE FEDERAL TORT CLAIMS ACT 28 U.S.C. § 2671 \n(INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS) \n20  (All Plaintiffs against Defendant United States) \n21  200.  Plaintiffs adequately exhausted their administrative remedies as required under 28 \n22  U.S.C. § 2675 by filing federal tort claims against OHS on the basis of the incidents alleged.  OHS \n23  denied all claims by letters dated June 11, 2018. \n24  20 I.  By committing the above-described acts, including but not limited to ongoing \n25  surveillance and harassment, the knowledge obtained from which was used to intimidate Plaintiffs, as \n26  well as arrests conducted in a public and unnecessarily aggressive manner, Defendants, engaging in \n27  intentional extreme and outrageous conduct, caused Plaintiffs to suffer extreme emotional distress. \n28 \n37 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 38 of 41\n202.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's breaches of duties, Plaintiffs have \n2  suffered and continue to suffer damages. \n3  203.  Plaintiffs are entitled to damages against the United States for intentional infliction of \n4  emotional distress to the full extent allowed under Vermont law and the FTCA, in an amount to be \n5  determined by the trier of fact. \n6  204.

Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez adequately exhausted his administrative remedies as \n11 \nrequired under 28 U.S.C. § 2675 by filing a federal tort claim against DHS on the basis of his March \n12 \n17, 2017 arrest.  DHS denied Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez's claim on June 11, 2018. \n13 \n206.  Here, Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez shows that a person intentionally confined him \n14 \nwithout the privilege to do so, and that person was conscious of the confinement. \n15 \n207.  By arresting and detaining Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez pursuant to a retaliatory official \n16 \npolicy related to his First Amendment-protected activity, Defendants confined him without the \n17 \nprivilege to do so.  Regardless of whether there was probable cause for an arrest, law enforcement \n18 \nofficials lack the privilege to arrest an individual pursuant to a retaliatory policy.  The confinement \n19 \ncaused Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez injury. \n20 \n208.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants' breaches of duties, Plaintiff Balcazar \n21 \nSanchez has suffered and continues to suffer damages. \n22 \n209.  Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez is entitled to damages against the United States for false \n23 \nimprisonment to the full extent allowed under Vermont law and the FTCA, in an amount to be \n24 \ndetermined by the trier of fact. \n25 \n210.  Under the Federal Tort Claims Act, defendant United States of America is liable for \n26 \nthese actions. \n27 \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n28 \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court: \n38 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 1   Filed 11/14/18   Page 39 of 41\nA.

Migrant Justice organizes and advocates for Vermont's immigrant farmworkers-a \n19  community of approximately 1,500 people who labor long hours under grueling and often dangerous \n20  conditions.  The organization has achieved remarkable success in organizing workers to assemble, \n21  publicly protest, march, and assert their perspectives in the larger marketplace of commerce and \n22  ideas.  Migrant Justice's members have identified four core areas of organizational focus: dignified \n23  work and quality housing, freedom of movement and access to transportation, freedom from \n24  discrimination, and access to healthcare. \n25  2.  In the course of its advocacy, Migrant Justice has loudly and publicly criticized U.S. \n26  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\").  ICE has retaliated, and continues to retaliate, by \n27  disrupting Plaintiffs' advocacy and infringing upon their First Amendment rights. \n28 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 2 of 42\n1  3.  ICE has infiltrated Migrant Justice's private meetings; targeted, surveilled, and \n2  engaged in disinformation campaigns to sow distrust among its members; and arrested and/or \n3  detained no fewer than twenty active Migrant Justice members, including the Individual Plaintiffs \n4  each of whom played and continues to play a critical role in Migrant Justice's advocacy. \n5  4.  ICE takes these actions because Plaintiffs are engaged in First Amendment activities \n6  and to deter them and others from engaging in similar activity. \n7  5.  ICE advances its retaliatory agenda with the assistance of the Vermont Department of \n8  Motor Vehicles (\"DMV\").  Motivated by racial and xenophobic animus, DMV employees give ICE \n9  private driver information, including the personal information and location, of non-white, \n10  predominately Latino, individuals. \n11  6.  ICE's actions have chilled and continue to chill Migrant Justice's ability to organize \n12  and advocate for migrant workers.  Fewer members attend community assemblies, events, protests, \n13  and rallies.  Migrant Justice finds it more difficult to enlist members to speak at public events.  ICE \n14  has also frustrated Migrant Justice's ability to advocate for fair labor practices and economic justice. \n15  Time and money once dedicated to this mission are now used to advance funds towards immigration \n16  bonds and attorneys' fees and to fight detentions of members. \n17  7.  As for the Individual Plaintiffs, not only has ICE chilled their speech and interfered \n18  with their association, but ICE's surveillance, harassment, arrest, and detention of them has caused \n19  and continues to cause them significant emotional distress. \n20  8.  Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief to end Defendants' unlawful and \n21  discriminatory practices, as well as monetary damages against the United States. \n22  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n23  9.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 (federal \n24  question), 1343 (civil rights), and 1346 (United States as Defendant), and 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  The \n25  Court has authority to grant declaratory relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2201. \n26  10.  Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 139l(b)(2) because a substantial part \n27  of the events giving rise to Plaintiffs' claims occurred in this district, under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(l) \n28  because the DMV is located in the district, and also under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because Defendants \n2 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 3 of 42\n1  Nielsen, Vitiello, and Albence are officers and employees of the United States or its agencies \n2  operating under color of law, and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the \n3  claims have occurred and are occurring in this judicial district. \n4  PARTIES \n5 \nA.  Plaintiffs \n6  11.  Plaintiff Migrant Justice, Inc. is a non-profit, non-partisan organization that was \n7  established in 2009.  Migrant Justice's mission is \"to build the voice, capacity, and power of the \n8  farmworker community and engage community partners to organize for economic justice and human \n9  rights.  [Migrant Justice] gathers the farmworker community to discuss and analyze shared problems \n10  and to envision collective solutions.  Through this ongoing investment in leadership development, \n11  members deepen their skills in community education and organizing for long-term systemic change.\" \n12  More than 90 percent of Migrant Justice members are Latino.  Migrant Justice brings this lawsuit on \n13  its own behalf, as well as on behalf of its members. \n14  12.  Plaintiff Jose Victor Garcia Diaz has been an active and visible Migrant Justice \n15  member since 2013.  He is a dairy worker in Vermont and a nationally-recognized human rights \n16  leader.  Plaintiff Garcia Diaz contacted Migrant Justice after enduring years of inhumane conditions \n17  on a Vermont dairy farm.  He became a leader in an effort by farmworkers and allies to march on the \n18  Ferrisburgh farm that employed him and as a result won nearly $2,000 in back wages for dairy \n19  workers.  As a member of Migrant Justice's Farmworker Coordinating Committee, Plaintiff Garcia \n20  Diaz helped build the Milk with Dignity Program, which seeks to establish fundamental labor \n21  protections for the Vermont dairy worker community.  To this end, Plaintiff Garcia Diaz represented \n22  his community in meetings and negotiations with Ben & Jerry's, a prominent Vermont, national, and \n23  international purchaser of dairy products, during the process of the company committing to join the \n24  Milk with Dignity Program.  He resides and has resided in Vermont during the events relevant to this \n25  Complaint and is Latino. \n26  13.  Plaintiff Jose Enrique \"Kike\" Balcazar Sanchez has been an active and visible \n27  Migrant Justice member since 2011.  He is a leader with Migrant Justice and a former dairy worker. \n28  He continues to be one of Migrant Justice's primary spokespeople.  He was a lead spokesperson in its \n3 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 4 of 42\n1  campaign to expand access to driving privileges and for a fair and impartial policing policy to limit \n2  law enforcement collaboration with ICE.  Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez was also one of the primary \n3  architects of the Milk with Dignity Program.  He helped lead the campaign that resulted in Ben & \n4  Jerry's committing to join the Milk with Dignity Program in 2015, and he was central to securing \n5  finalization of Ben & Jerry's commitment in 2017.  He has appeared routinely in local and national \n6  press coverage for several years.  Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez serves on the Vermont Attorney \n7  General's Immigration Task Force, representing immigrant farmworkers, helping to craft a guidance \n8  manual for Vermont cities and towns regarding their role in immigration law enforcement, and \n9  advocating for policies to provide stronger protections for Vermont's immigrant communities.  He \n10  resides and has resided in Vermont during the events relevant to this Complaint and is Latino. \n11  14.  Plaintiff Zolly Palacios Rodriguez has been an active and visible Migrant Justice \n12  member since 2016.  She was a vocal leader in Migrant Justice's women's group, which organizes \n13  groups of women who are immigrant farmworkers.  She became involved with Migrant Justice in \n14  2016, aiding in a successful campaign to free then-detained Migrant Justice leader and co-Plaintiff \n15  Garcia Diaz.  She participated in the successful campaign to secure a commitment from Ben & \n16  Jerry's to join the Milk with Dignity Program.  Plaintiff Palacios Rodriguez is involved in the \n17  national movement for immigrant rights and food justice, representing Migrant Justice in gatherings \n18  of the Food Chain Workers Alliance and the Co sec ha Movement.  She resides and has resided in \n19  Vermont during the events relevant to this Complaint and is Latina. \n20 \nB.  Defendants \n21  Federal Defendants \n22  15.  Defendant Kirstjen Nielsen is Secretary of the United States Department of \n23  Homeland Security (\"OHS\").  In this capacity, she is charged with enforcing and administering U.S. \n24  immigration laws.  She is sued in her official capacity. \n25  16.  Defendant Ronald Vitiello is the Deputy Director and Senior Official Performing the \n26  Duties of Director for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  In this capacity, he is charged \n27  with administering the enforcement of United States immigration law.  He is sued in his official \n28  capacity. \n4 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 5 of 42\n1  17.  Defendant Matthew Albence is the Executive Associate Director ofICE's \n2  Enforcement and Removal Operations (\"ERO\") and Senior Official Performing the Duties of Deputy \n3  Director.  He is sued in his official capacity. \n4  18.  Defendants Nielsen, Vitiello, and Albence are collectively referred to herein as \"DHS \n5  Defendants.\" At all relevant times, DHS Defendants were acting under color of law, as agents, \n6  employees, and/or representatives of the United States. \n7  19.  Defendant United States of America is sued for Plaintiffs' injuries caused by the \n8  wrongful acts or omissions of its employees.  Those employees were acting within the scope of their \n9  employment under circumstances in which the United States, if a private person, would be liable to \n10  Plaintiffs according to the laws of Vermont. \n11  Vermont DMV Defendant \n12  20.  Defendant Wanda Minoli is the Commissioner of the Vermont Department of Motor \n13  Vehicles.  In this capacity, she is charged with enforcing and administering the regulations governing \n14  the DMV, the governmental agency responsible for registering and inspecting automobiles and other \n15  motor vehicles as well as licensing drivers in Vermont.  At all relevant times, Defendant Minoli was \n16  acting under color oflaw, as an agent, employee, and/or representative of Vermont.  She is sued in \n17  her official capacity. \n18  21.  Federal and DMV Defendants are collectively referred to herein as \"Defendants.\" \n19  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n20 \nA.  Migrant Justice and Its Members Engage in Protected Speech, Win Changes that \nImprove the Lives of Migrants, and Criticize ICE and the DMV. \n21 \n22.  Migrant Justice fights for the rights of the approximately 1,500 migrant farm workers \n22 \nin Vermont.  These workers typically work sixty to eighty hours per week, endure extreme isolation, \n23 \nand are systemically excluded from many worker and housing rights protections. \n24 \n23.  Within the past decade, Migrant Justice's organizing and advocacy has focused on \n25 \nimproving working conditions at dairy farms across the state; partnering with the Vermont Workers' \n26 \nCenter to include undocumented people in Vermont's 2011 groundbreaking universal healthcare \n27 \nlegislation; winning tens of thousands of dollars in back wages through Migrant Justice's Workers' \n28 \n5 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 6 of 42\n1  Rights Hotline; and advocating for the Vermont Department of Labor to change employment law \n2  related to collection of unpaid wages, among other activities. \n3  1.  Migrant Justice Improves Working Conditions Through the Milk with \nDignity Program. \n4 \n24.  One example of Migrant Justice's visible, groundbreaking advocacy is its high-profile \n5 \nMilk with Dignity Program, a farmworker-driven initiative to improve conditions in dairy supply \n6 \nchains.  The Program rests on a participatory model in which workers, farmers, consumers, and retail \n7 \ncorporations align values and work together to build a fair food system. \n8 \n25.  Starting in 2014, Migrant Justice focused its campaign for the Milk with Dignity \n9 \nProgram on ice cream manufacturer Ben & Jerry's, an influential company headquartered within \n10 \nVermont that purchases vast amounts of milk from the local dairy-farming community. \n11 \n26.  In June 2015, after persistent public advocacy by Migrant Justice, Ben & Jerry's \n12 \nsigned a written commitment to negotiate an agreement with Migrant Justice to join the Milk with \n13 \nDignity Program.  The New York Times heralded the commitment as an \"innovative movement[] ... \n14 \nto improve wages and working conditions.\"  The Christian Science Monitor_ called the June 2015 \n15 \nagreement \"an important agreement with Ben & Jerry's to recognize the fundamental human rights of \n16 \nmigrant workers in dairy supply chains.\" \n17 \n27.  After signing the commitment, however, Ben & Jerry's delayed in signing a formal \n18 \nagreement to join the Program. Migrant Justice and its members then engaged in more than two \n19 \nyears of advocacy, community organizing, and escalating public protest to win allies and increase \n20 \npressure on Ben & Jerry's.  Finally, on October 3, 2017, Ben & Jerry's signed a formal agreement to \n21 \njoin Milk with Dignity. \n22 \n2.  Migrant Justice's First Amendment Activity Frustrates ICE's Agenda by \n23 \nProtecting Migrant Workers from Deportation. \n24  28.  In 2011, Migrant Justice launched one of its first campaigns against an ICE policy. \n25  Migrant Justice opposed ICE's Secure Communities Program, under which local law enforcement \n26  shared fingerprints with ICE. \n27  29.  On August 18, 2011, Migrant Justice member Danilo Lopez hand-delivered a petition \n28  signed by more than 70 farmworkers to then-Governor Peter Shumlin.  The petition asked Governor \n6 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 7 of 42\n1  Shumlin to publicly \"say no\" to Secure Communities because it \"threatens our security,\" \"promotes \n2  racial discrimination,\" and lacks transparency. \n3  30.  Three weeks later, Vermont state police stopped a car for speeding in which Lopez \n4  was a passenger.  Although he was not the driver and state police are not responsible for enforcing \n5  immigration law, state police handed Lopez over to U.S. Border Patrol. \n6  31.  In response to Lopez's arrest, on September 13, 2011, Migrant Justice organized its \n7  first protest against ICE for a member's detention.  Migrant Justice alleged that the incident violated \n8  the state police's existing bias-free policing policy and pushed the state government to adopt an \n9  expanded bias-free policing policy.  Governor Shumlin and the Vermont Human Rights Commission \n10  opened separate investigations into Lopez's arrest. \n11  32.  Migrant Justice continued campaigning to prevent Lopez's deportation, urging ICE to \n12  grant a stay of removal.  Migrant Justice enlisted support from Vermont's entire Congressional \n13  delegation-Senior United States Senator Patrick Leahy and Junior United States Senator Bernard \n14  Sanders and United States Representative Peter Welch-as well as Governor Shumlin and Burlington \n15  Mayor Miro Weinberger, all of whom wrote letters urging ICE to exercise its prosecutorial discretion \n16  in Lopez's favor.  ICE granted Lopez a stay of removal. \n17  33.  In November 2011, Governor Shumlin announced that the Vermont State Police had \n18  adopted an expanded bias-free policing policy aimed at preventing discrimination on the basis of \n19  race, ethnicity, or immigration status.  The expanded policy limited state involvement in federal \n20  immigration enforcement by restricting when officers could inquire about immigration status. \n21  34.  Migrant Justice continued to campaign for improved bias-free policing policies.  In \n22  2012, the Vermont legislature enacted a new law requiring all law enforcement agencies in Vermont \n23  to adopt bias-free policing policies.  2012 Acts & Resolves No. 134, § 2 (codified at 20 V.S.A. \n24  § 2366 (2012)). \n25  35.  In 2014, Vermont passed Act 193, a law mandating collection of roadside stop data \n26  and establishing a process and timeline for the Vermont Criminal Justice Training Council to adopt a \n27  model Fair and Impartial Policing policy.  2014 Vt. Acts & Resolves No. 193, § 3 ( codified at 20 \n28  V.S.A. § 2366 (2014)).  The legislation explicitly directed the Criminal Justice Training Council to \n7 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 8 of 42\nI  \"consult[] with stakeholders, including the Vermont League of Cities and Towns, the Vermont \n2  Human Rights Commission, and Migrant Justice.\" \n3  36.  In February 2015, Migrant Justice assisted a member, Lorenzo Alcudia Gamas, to file \n4  a complaint with the Vermont Human Rights Commission against the Grand Isle County Sheriffs \n5  Department.  A deputy had stopped a car driven by a Migrant Justice volunteer in which Alcudia \n6  Gamas rode in the passenger seat, on his way to a community meeting as a representative of Migrant \n7  Justice. \n8  37.  The deputy issued the Caucasian driver a warning for speeding but turned Alcudia \n9  Gamas over to U.S. Border Patrol.  The Vermont Human Rights Commission concluded that there \n10  were reasonable grounds to believe that the Sheriffs Department had discriminated against Alcudia \n11  Gamas on the basis of his national origin and race.  In April 2016, the Sheriffs Department settled \n12  with Alcudia Gamas and the Human Rights Commission for nearly $30,000. \n13  38.  In 2016, Vermont passed Act 14 7, a law establishing deadlines for the completion of \n14  fair and impartial policing training and in-service training.  2016 Vt. Acts & Resolves No. 147, § 26 \n15  (codified at 20 V.S.A. 2366 (2016)).  Migrant Justice had advocated for the passage of this law. \n16  39.  Migrant Justice continues advocating and organizing to promote fair and impartial \n17  policing policies to this day. \n18  40.  Migrant Justice also actively campaigns to prevent the deportation of members \n19  arrested by federal immigration authorities, by organizing public support to lobby immigration \n20  officials and submit support letters in immigration court, engaging in social media campaigns, and \n21  serving as a resource to connect community members to legal help.  Migrant Justice has publicly \n22  campaigned to stop the deportation of eleven members. \n23  3.  Migrant Justice's Activism Around Driver Privilege Cards Placed and \nContinues to Place ICE and the Vermont DMV in the Public Spotlight. \n24 \n41.  Beginning in 2012, Migrant Justice and its members embarked on a long and \n25 \nultimately successful legislative campaign to create the Vermont \"Driver Privilege Card\" (\"DPC\"), \n26 \nwhich permits Vermont residents to drive within the state, regardless of immigration status.  Plaintiff \n27 \nBalcazar Sanchez and Migrant Justice member Danilo Lopez, described by the statewide news \n28 \nwebsite VTDigger as a \"frequent presence\" at the Vermont Statehouse, led the campaign. \n8 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 9 of 42\n1  42.  In 2013, after more than a year of campaigning, lobbying, and organizing by Migrant \n2  Justice members, the Vermont legislature passed the DPC legislation.  It became effective on January \n3  1, 2014.  2013 Acts & Resolves No. 74 (codified at 23 V.S.A. § 603). \n4  43.  The DPC provided a solution for migrant workers who did not have the documentation \n5  required by the federal REAL ID act to obtain driver's licenses, yet who needed to drive in order to \n6  work and meet basic needs within a rural state.  The DPC also proved popular for many other \n7  Vermont residents who needed to drive within the state but did not want or could not obtain a REAL \n8  ID-compliant driver's license. \n9  44.  More than 40,000 Vermont residents obtained a DPC in a little over a year. \n10  45.  In early 2014, the DMV began sending personally identifying information obtained \n11  from DPC applications to ICE and scheduling appointments to facilitate ICE arrests. \n12  46.  As one of the only community organizations in the State working with Latinos, \n13  Migrant Justice quickly became the point-organization to assist individuals struggling to access \n14  DPCs.  Migrant Justice advocated in the press, with elected officials, and with the agency itself to \n15  investigate and reform practices, and publicly questioned the DMV's actions, particularly with regard \n16  to state-federal law enforcement cooperation. \n17  47.  From 2016 through 2018, the ACLU of Vermont, in coordination with Migrant \n18  Justice, filed a series of public records requests seeking information about the implementation of the \n19  DPC program.  The Vermont press reported extensively on the information obtained and in April \n20  2017, the Vermont Senate held hearings about the DMV's information-sharing with ICE.  Migrant \n21  Justice became well known to DMV and ICE officials because of its public role.  Migrant Justice's \n22  advocacy relating to DPCs continues to the present day. \n23  B.  ICE Surveils, Infiltrates, Engages in Disinformation, Arrests, and Detains \nPlaintiffs and Others to Retaliate and Chill Their First Amendment Rights. \n24 \n48.  Beginning in at least 2014, ICE has targeted, surveilled, and spread disinformation \n25 \nabout Migrant Justice, its staff, and its leaders.  ICE has also arrested and detained no fewer than \n26 \ntwenty active Migrant Justice members and leaders. \n27 \n28 \n9 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 10 of 42\n1  49.  The majority of these arrests did not fit within ICE's internal priorities for \n2  enforcement.  Rather, they occurred contemporaneously with and in response to the increasing \n3  visibility and activism of Migrant Justice in challenging misconduct by the Vermont OMV and \n4  abusive ICE practices in Latino and worker communities. \n5  50.  While these Migrant Justice members were detained, ICE interrogated them without \n6  counsel; interrogated them about circumstances clearly beyond ICE's jurisdiction; ridiculed them; \n7  and threatened them with indefinite detention. \n8  1.  ICE Arrests Plaintiff Jose Victor Garcia Diaz and Specifically Notes His \nAffiliation with Migrant Justice on His Arrest Documents. \n9 \n51.  On April 18, 2016, a OHS/ICE Deportation Officer requested Plaintiff Jose Victor \n10 \nGarcia Diaz's photograph and DPC application from the Vermont OMV.  A OMV Enforcement \n11 \nDivision Administrative Supervisor complied on April 19, 2016. \n12 \n52.  On April 20, 2016, Plaintiff Garcia Diaz returned to Vermont from Los Angeles where \n13 \nhe had represented Migrant Justice at a well-publicized conference for the Food Chain Workers \n14 \nAlliance, a national coalition of labor rights organizations.  Plaintiff Garcia Diaz posted on Facebook \n15 \nabout his traveling to the conference and his anticipated participation in a cultural event the next day. \n16 \n53.  On April 21, 2016, ICE agents arrested Plaintiff Garcia Diaz in a parking lot outside of \n17 \nthe cultural event in Stowe, Vermont.  Plaintiff Garcia Diaz was with Plaintiffs Palacios Rodriguez \n18 \nand Balcazar Sanchez at the time of his arrest. \n19 \n54.  In paperwork documenting the arrest, the \"Report of Deportable/lnadmissible Alien,\" \n20 \nknown as the Form 1-213, ICE Agent Brady Goff noted that Plaintiff Garcia Diaz was a \"member and \n21 \nassociate of Migrant Justice.\"  An internal ICE report issued on April 21, 2016 noted that Plaintiff \n22 \nGarcia Diaz is a \"well known and prominent member of Migrant Justice.\"  ICE described Migrant \n23 \nJustice as \"a non-governmental organization in Vermont that advocates for the rights of migrant \n24 \nfarmworkers and other aliens.  The organization was instrumental in the VT legislature's passing of \n25 \nthe law that grants driving privileges to undocumented aliens.  Migrant Justice is vocal and public in \n26 \ntheir opposition to immigration enforcement.\" \n27 \n55.  During his interrogation, ICE asked Plaintiff Garcia Diaz about an identification card \n28 \nhe possessed from the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, a prominent activist farmworker group in \n10 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 11 of 42\n1  Florida.  ICE seized the card.  The ICE agents knew of the Coalition oflmmokalee Workers and \n2  commented on the organization in front of Plaintiff Garcia Diaz.  ICE also seized his DPC.  ICE has \n3  not returned either piece of documentation. \n4  56.  After Plaintiff Garcia Diaz's arrest, Migrant Justice launched a series ofrallies to \n5  support him.  On April 22, 2016, Migrant Justice members assembled in Senator Leahy's office in \n6  Burlington, Vermont, to protest ICE's conduct.  On May 1, 2016, Migrant Justice organized a rally in \n7  Montpelier attended by hundreds of individuals.  As a result of Migrant Justice's petitioning, Senator \n8  Leahy' s office stated its intent to intervene on Plaintiff Garcia Diaz's behalf and lobbied against ICE \n9  practices in Washington, D.C.  Senator Sanders followed shortly thereafter and also submitted a letter \n10  to ICE supporting Plaintiff Garcia Diaz. \n11  2.  ICE Arrests Migrant Justice Member Alberto Sanchez Perez and Spreads \nDisinformation about Migrant Justice Staff to Sow Distrust. \n12 \n57.  On August 24, 2016, ICE arrested Migrant Justice member Alberto Sanchez Perez. \n13 \nSanchez Perez had no criminal record and did not qualify as a DHS enforcement priority under the \n14 \nNovember 20, 2014 guidelines.  ICE officers targeted Sanchez Perez and falsely claimed that they \n15 \nneeded to investigate the causes of a car accident in which he was a passenger.  Although they had no \n16 \njurisdiction over the car accident, the ICE officers interrogated Sanchez Perez for several hours, held \n17 \nhim overnight, prevented him from contacting an attorney, and made multiple references to his \n18 \nperceived sexual orientation. \n19 \n58.  ICE officers told Sanchez Perez that they had been discussing the accident with \n20 \nMigrant Justice leader Marita Canedo and had asked Canedo to bring Sanchez Perez to the ICE \n21 \noffice, and that they would not have arrested Sanchez Perez if Canedo had given him a message that \n22 \nthey wanted to speak with him. \n23 \n3.  ICE Arrests Migrant Justice Member Miguel Alcudia Gamas and Warns \n24  Him that \"Kike\" Is \"Next.\" \n25  59.  ICE next arrested and detained Migrant Justice member Miguel Alcudia Gamas. \n26  Alcudia Gamas has no criminal record and did not qualify as a OHS enforcement priority under the \n27  November 20, 2014 guidelines. \n28 \n11 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 12 of 42\n1  60.  Alcudia Gamas is the cousin of Lorenzo Alcudia Gamas, whose involvement in \n2  Migrant Justice's advocacy for bias-free policing is discussed above. \n3  61.  On September 16, 2016, a DHS/ICE Deportation Officer requested from the Vermont \n4  DMV Alcudia Gamas's photograph, his DPC application, and a list of vehicles registered in his \n5  name. \n6  62.  A DMV employee complied, volunteered that Alcudia Gamas's license plate \"was \n7  recently issued,\" and asked if the DHS/ICE Deportation Officer \"want[ed] the paperwork for that.\" \n8  63.  An ICE Important Federal Interest Memorandum (\"IFI Memo\") dated September 19, \n9  2016, states that \"continued prosecution of [Alcudia Gamas] would serve an important federal \n10  interest\" even though, according to the cover email accompanying the IFI Memo, Alcudia Gamas \n11  was \"not currently an ICE Enforcement Priority.\"  The IFI Memo does not specify the reasons for \n12  this determination, which was made as a matter of \"prosecutorial discretion.\" \n13  64.  ICE surveilled Alcudia Gamas and arrested him on September 22, 2016.  ICE \n14  identified Alcudia Gamas by his license plate and DPC.  During the arrest, an ICE agent asked \n15  Alcudia Gamas if he was related to Lorenzo Alcudia Gamas.  Alcudia Gamas replied that they were \n16  cousins. \n17  65.  The ICE agent also asked Alcudia Gamas ifhe knew Migrant Justice leader-member \n18  \"Kike,\" referring to Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez by his nickname.  When Alcudia Gamas replied that \n19  he did, the ICE agent stated that Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez was \"next.\" Alcudia Gamas took this to \n20  mean that Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez would be the next Migrant Justice leader to be arrested and \n21  detained. \n22  66.  Under the section titled \"Recommendation/Disposition\" on Alcudia Gamas's Form 1-\n23  213, an ICE officer noted that a \"representative of the advocacy group Migrant Justice\" called the \n24  ICE ERO office on September 22, 2016. \n25  67.  On September 22, 2016, Migrant Justice organized a protest at the ICE facility at St. \n26  Albans, Vermont in response to Alcudia Gamas's arrest.  Migrant Justice also secured a letter from \n27  Senator Sanders to support Alcudia Gamas's release from detention on bond.  Internal ICE \n28 \n12 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 13 of 42\n1  documents reflect that ICE employees expended significant effort responding to Congressional and \n2  media inquiries generated by Migrant Justice's advocacy efforts. \n3 \n4.  ICE Targets Additional Migrant Justice Members. \n4  68.  On February 2, 2017, ICE arrested Migrant Justice member Arturo Ruiz Rodriguez \n5  outside of his home.  Ruiz Rodriguez has no criminal record and did not qualify as a DHS \n6  enforcement priority under prevailing enforcement guidelines. \n7  69.  During the arrest, Ruiz Rodriguez informed ICE that his minor son, a seven-year-old \n8  U.S. citizen, was inside.  Ruiz Rodriguez asked ICE if he could make arrangements for child care \n9  while he was detained.  An ICE agent refused this request and added that if Ruiz Rodriguez entered \nIO  his home, ICE would arrest and detain his seven-year-old son as well. \n11  70.  The ICE agent falsely informed Ruiz Rodriguez that he had received his name and \n12  address from Migrant Justice leader Will Lambek. \n13  71.  On March 15, 2017, ICE arrested Migrant Justice member Cesar Alexis Carrillo \n14  Sanchez.  Carrillo Sanchez's I-213 notes that ICE relied for the arrest upon information obtained \n15  from his \"Vermont DMV license application.\" \n16 \n5.  ICE Enlists an Informant to Surveil and Target Plaintiffs Zolly Palacios \nRodriguez and Jose Enrique Balcazar Sanchez. \n17 \n72.  By February and March 2017, ICE had already begun a full-scale campaign to \n18 \ninfiltrate and debilitate Migrant Justice, employing means far exceeding legitimate immigration \n19 \nenforcement practice. \n20 \n73.  ICE enlisted at least one civilian informant to infiltrate Migrant Justice, which it used \n21 \nto effect the arrests of two prominent Migrant Justice member-leaders, Plaintiffs Palacios Rodriguez \n22 \nand Balcazar Sanchez, just days after the arrest of Migrant Justice member Carrillo Sanchez. \n23 \n74.  Neither Plaintiff Palacio Rodriguez nor Balcazar Sanchez have criminal records, nor \n24 \ndid they qualify as DHS enforcement priorities.  Internal documents confirm that ICE was aware it \n25 \nhad no apparent legitimate law enforcement reason to arrest and detain Plaintiffs Palacios Rodriguez \n26 \nand Balcazar Sanchez. \n27 \n75.  According to text messages sent between ICE Agent John Trantum and the informant, \n28 \nICE used the informant to obtain private information to arrest, detain, and retaliate against Plaintiffs \n13 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 14 of 42\n1  and their colleagues because of their activism.  Messages sent between the informant and her trusted \n2  acquaintance, Jane Doe, 1 also a civilian, confirm this relationship.  According to the informant, \n3  \"anytime [Agent Trantum] makes an arrest he asks me [for information about the subject.]\" \n4  76.  Jane Doe told Migrant Justice leaders that ICE knew that to \"strike a blow\" against \n5  Migrant Justice they needed to target Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez because he was \"very outspoken.\" \n6  77.  The informant's text messages reveal that she further ingratiated herself with the \n7  organization in order to establish membership and gain access to non-public meetings and private \n8  conversations.  For instance, the informant attended a number of Migrant Justice events, including \n9  but not limited to a February 25, 2017 Farmworker Assembly that was not open to the public.  The \n10  informant's presence intruded upon Plaintiffs' privacy. \n11  78.  On March 1, 2017, ICE Agent Trantum asked the civilian informant to target a \n12  specific Migrant Justice member.  The informant sent Jane Doe a photograph of at least seven \n13  individuals wearing Migrant Justice T-shirts and asked her, \"Hey you know this guy at all?\"  Internal \n14  ICE emails also confirm that ICE surveilled targets based on photographs of individuals \"wearing [ ] \n15  Migrant Justice Tee-shirt[s] [sic].\" \n16  79.  In another message on March 4, 2017, the informant discussed with Jane Doe ICE's \n17  plan to apprehend Plaintiff Palacios Rodriguez.  The informant confided in Jane Doe that ICE had \n18  been surveilling Plaintiff Palacios Rodriguez's house for many weeks and had even seen Migrant \n19  Justice leader Marita Canedo's car at her residence. \n20  80.  According to Plaintiff Palacios Rodriguez's Form 1-213 documenting her arrest, an \n21  ICE officer-for no stated reason-ran a search for her biographical information in October 2016. \n22  According to a separate internal memorandum, the investigating ICE officer noted that he was \n23  conducting a Facebook search.  The Form 1-213 states that ICE received information \"from a \n24  concerned citizen,\" whom Plaintiffs believe to be the informant. \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n1  \"Jane Doe\" is used to protect confidentiality. \n14 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 15 of 42\n81.  Internal ICE emails between Homeland Security Investigations (\"HSI\") Burlington \n2  and Enforcement and Removal Operations (\"ERO\") Boston reflect that Plaintiff Palacios Rodriguez \n3  was a target of a planned arrest in March 2017. \n4  82.  Although Plaintiff Palacios Rodriguez was the ostensible target, ICE's surveillance led \n5  ICE agents to believe they could arrest Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez, too.  On March 13, 2017, ICE \n6  drafted a \"Field Operations Worksheet\" regarding Plaintiff Palacios Rodriguez.  Under an entry for \n7  \"Spouse/Children,\" the operations worksheet states that Plaintiff Palacios Rodriguez's \"Boyfriend Is \n8  Enrique Balcazar.\"  Internal ICE documents note that \"BALCAZAR will most likely be with \n9  [Palacios] at the time of arrest as they are together most of the time.\" \n10  83.  On March 8, 2017, a DHS/ICE Deportation Officer emailed the DMV to request \n11  Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez's license plate information.  A DMV employee complied the next day. \n12  84.  On March 13, 2017, in response to a request for an \"Agency Assist,\" a DMV official \n13  transmitted Balcazar Sanchez's application for a Driver Privilege Card to ICE Agent Goff.  In the \n14  margins of the application, a DMV official handwrote the words \"UNDOCUMENTED\" and \n15  \"PRIVILEGE CARD.\"  Balcazar Sanchez's 1-213 states that ICE obtained a number of documents \n16  from the DMV: in addition to the standard DMV document requested, the DMV sent a \"biographic \n17  page\" and copies of identity documents.  An internal DHS and ICE \"Field Operations Worksheet\" \n18  reflects that the DMV also sent Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez's license plate number and car model. \n19  85.  On March 17, 2017, at about 1: 15 a.m., Plaintiff Palacios Rodriguez received a \n20  notification from Microsoft that an unauthorized individual had attempted to gain access to her email \n21  account.  Plaintiff Palacios Rodriguez was not aware of her account previously being hacked and this \n22  was the first time that she received this type of notification. \n23  86.  Later that day, after driving from a meeting at Migrant Justice with Plaintiff Palacios \n24  Rodriguez in the front passenger seat, Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez observed a white car following \n25  them from the meeting.  According to an internal document, the arresting ICE officer recognized him \n26  from Plaintiff Garcia Diaz's arrest, and was able to identify him even though he was driving directly \n27  behind him. \n28 \n15 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 16 of 42\n1  87.  Three unmarked cars boxed in Plaintiffs Palacios Rodriquez and Balcazar Sanchez in \n2  a very busy intersection of Route 7 and Flynn A venue.  Plainclothes officers exited their vehicles, did \n3  not identify themselves, and ordered Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez to put the car in park, put his hands \n4  on the wheel, and get out of the car.  Agent Goff, with his hand on his gun, seized Plaintiff Palacios \n5  Rodriguez's phone from out of her hand, unbuckled her seatbelt, and physically removed her from \n6  the vehicle.  The officers screamed at Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez, humiliated him, and caused a \n7  demeaning public spectacle.  Bystanders, including children, observed the spectacle, and several \n8  individuals inquired about the nature of the arrest. \n9  88.  Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez asked the officers to identify themselves, why they were \n10  detaining them, and if they had an arrest warrant.  The officers did not respond.  Though ICE officers \n11  handcuffed him by the wrists and later by the ankles, ICE never told Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez that \n12  he was under arrest, or why. \n13  89.  Agent Goff referred to Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez repeatedly by his nickname, \"Kike,\" \n14  and other ICE agents referred to Plaintiff Palacios Rodriguez as \"Vicki,\" a nickname for her middle \n15  name that she uses on Facebook. \n16  90.  ICE agents made repeated references to Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez's and Plaintiff \n17  Palacios Rodriguez's affiliation with Migrant Justice.  ICE explicitly forbade Plaintiff Balcazar \n18  Sanchez from contacting Migrant Justice during his processing and detention.  ICE agents threatened \n19  him that if he did call Migrant Justice, \"it will be worse for you.\" \n20  91.  Agent Goff forbade Plaintiff Palacios Rodriguez from calling Migrant Justice leaders \n21  Will Lambek or Brendan O'Neill (referring to them by name) and forbade her from disclosing her \n22  location. \n23  92.  Later, when Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez arrived at a detention facility in Swanton, \n24  Vermont, Jeff Curtis, ICE Supervising Deportation and Detention Officer, told the facility that he had \n25  brought them \"a famous person,\" in reference to Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez's activism. \n26  93.  An ICE officer also attempted to coax Plaintiff Palacios Rodriguez into signing an \n27  order of voluntary departure by threatening falsely that she would be detained for two months without \n28  bond. \n16 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 17 of 42\n94.  ICE considered Plaintiffs Balcazar Sanchez and Palacios Rodriguez \"high-profile \n2  cases.\"  On March 21, 2017, four days after Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez's and Palacios Rodriguez's \n3  arrests, in response to a newspaper article about Migrant Justice, an ICE employee asked Timothy \n4  Robbins, Deputy Assistant Director of ICE/ERO, Daniel Ragsdale, then ICE Deputy Director, and \n5  Defendant Matthew Albence, Executive Associate Director of ICE/ERO, for \"executive summaries\" \n6  on Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez, Migrant Justice member Alex Carrillo, and Migrant Justice leader Will \n7  Lambek. \n8  95.  ICE had no basis to target Plaintiffs Balcazar Sanchez or Palacios Rodriguez to protect \n9  public safety or comply with ICE's stated priorities.  An internal email thread on March 30, 2017, \n10  reflects ICE's desired priority to \"push forward on subjects with a criminal/public safety nexus.\" \n11  Neither Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez nor Plaintiff Palacios Rodriguez had criminal records, as reflected \n12  in both of their Form I-213s.  A separate OHS document lists Plaintiff Palacios Rodriguez's \"risk to \n13  public safety\" as \"low.\" \n14  96.  Just a few weeks prior to Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez's arrest, Vermont Attorney \n15  General T.J. Donovan had appointed him to his Immigration Task Force. \n16  97.  In late March and April 2017, in response to the arrests of Plaintiffs Balcazar Sanchez \n17  and Palacios Rodriguez, Migrant Justice organized protests to advocate for their release.  Dozens \n18  picketed around the St. Albans ICE office; hundreds of allies gathered in downtown Burlington, \n19  Montpelier, and Brattleboro; and a petition to release the individuals gathered thousands of \n20  signatures. \n21  98.  The protests generated significant media coverage.  Vermont United States Senators \n22  Leahy and Sanders, Congressman Welch, and Vermont Senator Pro Tempore Tim Ashe voiced their \n23  concern about ICE tactics and policies. \n24  99.  On March 27, 2017, the date of Plaintiffs Balcazar Sanchez and Palacios Rodriguez's \n25  bond hearing, Migrant Justice members organized a protest attended by hundreds of individuals \n26  outside of the Boston Immigration Court. \n27 \n28 \n17 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 18 of 42\n1  100.  Internal ICE documents reflect that ICE knew of the locations and times of the \n2  protests before they occurred.  ICE employees shared with one another a number of Migrant Justice \n3  Facebook photos publicizing the event. \n4  101.  Senator Sanders had also submitted letters to the Immigration Court with 10,000 \n5  signatures of support, noting that it was \"unclear why these two individuals would possibly be \n6  considered enforcement priorities[.]\" \n7  6.  ICE Continues to Hold and Prosecute Two Migrant Justice Members \nAfter Learning About Their Affiliation with Migrant Justice. \n8 \n102.  On June 17, 2017, Customs and Border Protection (\"CBP\") pulled over and arrested \n9 \nMigrant Justice members Esau Peche Ventura and Yesenia Hernandez Ramos.  The arrest occurred \n10 \non the same day that Peche Ventura and Hernandez Ramos had marched thirteen miles to show their \n11 \nsupport for the rights of workers in Migrant Justice's march from Montpelier to the Ben & Jerry's \n12 \nfactory in Waterbury, Vermont, in support of the campaign for the Milk with Dignity Program. \n13 \n103.  CBP agents pulled over Peche Ventura and Hernandez Ramos's vehicle without \n14 \nexplicit or evident cause.  CBP arrested Peche Ventura and Hernandez Ramos and searched their \n15 \nvehicle.  CBP transferred Peche Ventura and Hernandez Ramos to ICE custody.  ICE held them for \n16 \nseveral days. \n17 \n104.  By the morning of June 19, 2017, internal ICE documents reveal that ICE understood \n18 \nthat it lacked sufficient cause to continue detaining Peche Ventura and Hernandez Ramos, stating in \n19 \nan internal email, \"I have asked [r edacted] to reach out to BP to see if there is anything they can do to \n20 \ngive us legally sufficient cases so we can move forward.\"  Even though ICE knew that it lacked a \n21 \nlegally sufficient reason to continue to hold them, lCE did not release them but instead requested the \n22 \nDMV records of Peche Ventura and CBP visited their place of employment in search of evidence to \n23 \nsupport their continued detention. \n24 \n105.  Over the course of the day on June 19, 2017, the OMV provided ICE with Peche \n25 \nVentura's DPC application along with identifying vehicular information. \n26 \n106.  Also on June 19, 2017, a delegation of Migrant Justice members and allies protested at \n27 \nthe ICE office in St. Albans, Vermont.  Migrant Justice members demanded that ICE explain why it \n28 \nhad arrested individuals with no criminal records. \n18 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 19 of 42\n107.  During the protest, ICE agents recognized and identified several members by name. \n2  One ICE agent specifically pointed to and threatened some of the Individual Plaintiffs with detention. \n3  The agent called out Plaintiffs by name-\"Kike [Balcazar], Zully [Palacios], [and] Victor \n4  [Garcia],\"-and stated \"you are putting your bond at risk.\"  This statement was intended to chill \n5  Plaintiffs' speech. \n6  108.  ICE officers also accessed Migrant Justice social media pages to track and monitor \n7  advocacy campaigns on Peche Ventura's and Hernandez Ramos's behalf.  ICE identified Migrant \n8  Justice's protest in St. Albans as an \"ICE Significant Incident.\" \n9  7.  ICE Targets Another Migrant Justice Member, Making Explicit Note of \nHis Affiliation with Migrant Justice as well as Migrant Justice's Activities \n10 \n109.  On October 23, 2017, ICE arrested Migrant Justice leader and long-time member Jose \n11 \nCruz Balcazar Ventura in Addison County, Vermont. \n12 \n110.  Although ICE did not arrest Balcazar Ventura until October 2017 and claimed that he \n13 \ncame to their attention after a state criminal charge in the Fall of 2017, ICE had been targeting \n14 \nBalcazar Ventura and knew of his involvement with Migrant Justice for more than 17 months.  For \n15 \nexample, on May 20, 2016, an ICE deportation officer circulated a Federal Interest Memo for \n16 \nBalcazar Ventura seeking approval to target him for arrest.  In that same email, the deportation \n17 \nofficer directs, \"Please let [redacted] know that, if approved, we will proceed as we did before, \n18 \nfollowing all policies and procedures to the letter.  We will also stay away from any 'cultural events' \n19 \nthis time,\" a clear reference to Plaintiff Garcia Diaz's arrest at a Mexican cultural event on April 21, \n20 \n2016. \n21 \n111.  ICE continued to reference Balcazar Ventura's affiliation with Migrant Justice in its \n22 \nsubsequent tracking and enforcement activities against him.  On July 19, 2016, acknowledging that \n23 \nBalcazar Ventura had no known criminal history and that the date and manner of his entry to the U.S. \n24 \nwas \"[u]nknown,\" ICE decided nonetheless to deem him a 2(c) enforcement priority as a \"recent \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n19 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 20 of 42\n2 \n1  entrant.\" On an email exchange dated August 23, 2017, an ICE agent, in referencing his \n2  apprehension, noted that \"BALCAZAR-Ventura ... is associated with Migrant Justice.\" \n3  8.  ICE Selectively Revealed that It Was Surveilling Migrant Justice in Order \nto Intimidate and Chill Its Activities. \n4 \n112.  In addition to the arrests, ICE selectively revealed information that it was surveilling \n5 \nMigrant Justice in order to intimidate and chill Plaintiffs' protected activities. \n6 \n113.  For example, Migrant Justice assemblies are not open to the general public.  The \n7 \norganization shares the locations, dates, and times of its meetings only with members and known \n8 \nsupporters.  However, in February 2017, a Migrant Justice supporter and community leader called the \n9 \nICE St. Albans office to ask questions about ICE's policies and practices relating to the detention of \n10 \nchildren.  Instead of answering her questions, the ICE Supervising Deportation and Detention Officer \n11 \nasked the Migrant Justice ally whether she was asking the questions in preparation for the Migrant \n12 \nJustice meeting, which he referenced by date and stated the exact location of the assembly-neither \n13 \nof which had been made public. \n14 \n114.  ICE arrests of Migrant Justice members continue, and ICE's surveillance of Migrant \n15 \nJustice also likely continues. \n16 \n115.  As recently as October 25, 2018, CBP arrested Migrant Justice member Eli Calvo \n17 \nCruz.  ICE then ordered Calvo Cruz detained on a $14,000 bond, even though an immigration judge \n18 \nin an earlier proceeding had set Calvo Cruz's bond at $4,500 and had administratively closed his \n19 \nimmigration case. \n20 \n116.  Migrant Justice organized a public campaign in support of Calvo Cruz's bond hearing, \n21 \ncollecting nearly 1,300 signatures and writing letters of support.  On November 9, 2018, an \n22 \nimmigration judge released Calvo Cruz on $1,500 bond. \n23 \n24 \n25  2 Priority 2(c) comes from the Priorities Memo released by DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson on Nov. 20, \n2014. See Memorandum from Secretary of DHS Jeh Johnson, Policies for the Apprehension, \n26  Detention and Removal of Undocumented Immigrants (Nov. 24, 2014), available at \nhttps:// www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/14_  1120_  memo_ prosecutorial_d iscretion.pdf \n27  . Priority 2(c) refers to: \"aliens apprehended anywhere in the United States after unlawfully \nentering or re-entering the United States and who cannot establish to the satisfaction of an \n28  immigration officer that they have been physically present in the United States continuously since \nJanuary 1, 2014.\" \n20 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 21 of 42\n1  9.  Defendants Have Significantly Chilled the Speech of Plaintiffs, Caused \nLasting Harm, and Forced Migrant Justice to Divert Resources. \n2 \n117.  Migrant Justice's members-Plaintiff and non-Plaintiff members alike-have an \n3 \nimmediate fear of reprisal and share a ubiquitous sentiment of being watched.  Migrant Justice is \n4 \nconcerned that, as certain private meetings have been surveilled, public protests and marches in the \n5 \nfuture will be as well.  Migrant Justice has had to modify and limit certain programming.  Migrant \n6 \nJustice has forgone certain opportunities to advocate on behalf of its members and to advocate for \n7 \neconomic and workplace rights.  Defendants' conduct has hampered Migrant Justice's ability to reach \n8 \na broad and vulnerable audience and has caused a significant chill of free speech. \n9 \n118.  Defendants' unlawful conduct has taken a significant toll on Migrant Justice and its \n10 \nmembership.  The effects of Defendants' conduct manifest in four primary ways:  (1) Plaintiffs and \n11 \nother non-Plaintiff members are fearful of further retaliation and now proceed more cautiously, \n12 \nincluding forgoing certain speaking opportunities for fear ofreprisal; (2) as a result, Migrant Justice \n13 \nis less effective, and is able to draw fewer attendees, less support, and lower enthusiasm; (3) Migrant \n14 \nJustice has been forced to shift its efforts from advocacy focused on advancing workplace rights to \n15 \nadvocacy focused on defending against retaliatory immigration enforcement; and ( 4) Defendants \n16 \nhave forced Migrant Justice to outlay significant time, resources, and finances as a result. \n17 \n119.  Defendants' unlawful conduct continues to exert a substantial chilling effect upon the \n18 \norganization and its members and continues to undermine Migrant Justice's advocacy.  Given ICE's \n19 \nextensive surveillance and infiltration, Plaintiffs expect ongoing harassment and targeting of their \n20 \nFirst Amendment activities.  As a result, Migrant Justice has had to take extensive and costly \n21 \nprecautions, limiting its overall reach to the community.  For example, when the organization hosts \n22 \nmeetings, it must implement a watch system around the state to prevent ICE from following and \n23 \nsurveilling members' vehicles. \n24 \n120.  Migrant Justice leader Marita Canedo has limited her interaction with other members \n25 \nsince she learned that ICE was surveilling her car, discussed hifra Jr 130: she no longer provides \n26 \nmembers transportation, which significantly hinders her ability to connect with workers; she fears \n27 \nthat ICE will target any member with whom she associates and avoids major roads when driving. \n28 \n21 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 22 of 42\n1  121.  Migrant Justice believes that the informant is still infiltrating its membership to this \n2  very day.  In the weeks before this complaint was filed, the informant attended a Migrant Justice \n3  event and began recording video while she was there, despite explicit requests to attendees not to \n4  record video or post to social media.  Moreover, internal documents from the DMV and ICE indicate \n5  that the DMV is still sending ICE sensitive information to facilitate ICE's enforcement of civil \n6  immigration law. \n7  122.  Each Plaintiff expresses concern and fear of further retaliation, including surveillance, \n8  harassment, and summary arrest and detention. Each Plaintiff asserts that though he or she remains a \n9  member of Migrant Justice and continues to engage in political speech, he or she proceeds more \n10  anxiously and fearfully than before Defendants' unlawful conduct and that his or her speech has been \n11  chilled. \n12  123.  This too is true of many non-Plaintiff Migrant Justice members.  Additionally, many \n13  migrant workers express hesitation to join Migrant Justice-initiated protests, rallies, or marches \n14  because they fear they will be detained for organizing and associating with the organization. \n15  124.  As a result of Defendants' unlawful surveillance, harassment, arrest, and detention, \n16  Plaintiff Garcia Diaz suffers from significant anxiety, sadness, and difficulty concentrating.  He \n17  believes that Defendants continue to track his movements and surveil him during meetings, protests, \n18  and community events.  He worries every time he participates in Migrant Justice activities.  His \n19  speech and associational rights have been chilled. \n20  125.  As a result of Defendants' unlawful surveillance, harassment, arrest, and detention, \n21  Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez suffers from significant anxiety, difficulty sleeping and concentrating, and \n22  a sense of dread and paranoia that causes him to alert his friends and family as to his whereabouts at \n23  all times because of fear.  He believes that Defendants continue to track his movements and surveil \n24  him during meetings, protests, and community events.  He also believes ICE is monitoring his social \n25  media profiles.  His speech and associational rights have been chilled. \n26  126.  As a result of Defendants' unlawful surveillance, harassment, arrest, and detention, \n27  Plaintiff Palacios Rodriguez lives in a constant state of fear that ICE will arrest her and send her to \n28  jail at any moment.  She suffers from significant anxiety, lack of sleep, lack of appetite, nightmares, \n22 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 23 of 42\n1  and a sense of despair and sadness that causes her to burst into tears without provocation.  She \n2  believes that Defendants continue to track her movements and surveil her during meetings, protests, \n3  and community events.  She also believes Defendants may be monitoring her private electronic \n4  communications, as well as her social media profiles.  Her speech and associational rights have been \n5  chilled. \n6  127.  By decreasing willingness of Vermont residents to risk association with the \n7  organization's viewpoints and advocacy efforts, Migrant Justice's ability to effectuate its labor \n8  organizing efforts has been diminished. \n9  128.  Defendants' conduct has significantly deterred members' participation and attendance \n10  at Migrant Justice events.  On average, assembly participation has dropped by approximately one-\n11  half.  Members have reported fearing retaliation by Defendants and citing the ongoing ICE actions \n12  against Plaintiffs specifically. \n13  129.  The closer in time to a recent arrest or detention an assembly or event was planned, the \n14  lower the attendance.  For example, only ten Migrant Justice members attended the March 23, 2017, \n15  assembly in Morrisville, Vermont, held six days after Plaintiffs Balcazar Sanchez's and Palacios \n16  Rodriguez's arrests, although approximately twenty-five had originally stated they intended to \n17  participate.  At least seven Migrant Justice members called to cancel their attendance at the assembly \n18  in the days following the arrests.  Additional members expected to participate did not attend, and \n19  many community organizers and advocates were notably absent.  Likewise, Defendants' conduct \n20  hampered Migrant Justice's ability to recruit new employees and gamer community support. \n21  130.  Migrant Justice's Women's Group met monthly in 2015 and 2016, but stopped \n22  meeting for two years due to members' fears about ICE and law enforcement activity, specifically the \n23  arrests of Plaintiff Garcia Diaz and other members.  Migrant Justice members widely understood that \n24  ICE was surveilling Women's Group leader Marita Canedo, which referenced her \"red car\" on a \n25  number of occasions, a fact confirmed by the informant. \n26  131.  Defendants' conduct has caused a number of Vermont-based farm owners to \n27  discourage their employees from participating in Migrant Justice activities for fear that their workers \n28  would be detained.  Further, fearing that advocacy would draw unwarranted attention from federal \n23 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 24 of 42\n1  authorities and many of their employees would be arrested, many farm owners are reluctant to \n2  participate in the Milk with Dignity Program.  This reluctance has protracted negotiations with \n3  companies such as Ben & Jerry's and continues to hinder the operation of the program and its \n4  expansion to cover more farmworkers. \n5  132.  As a result of Defendants' speech suppression, Migrant Justice has had to divert away \n6  from priorities such as Milk with Dignity and redirect them towards combatting unconstitutional \n7  immigration practices.  ICE's activities have forced Migrant Justice to devote significant time and \n8  resources to activities such as advocating for bond reductions for its indigent members and taking \n9  other measures to mitigate the harmful impact of the chilling of individual members' willingness to \n10  continue to associate with the organization. \n11  133.  Migrant Justice has had to divert a significant portion of their time to immigration-\n12  defense related work, specifically combatting the DMV's discriminatory treatment against \n13  immigrants, addressing ICE-based retaliatory arrests and surveillance practices, creating national \n14  organizing and advocacy campaigns for their aggrieved members, and countless others.  A significant \n15  portion of staff time has been diverted away from labor-based advocacy to immigration-related work \n16  due to Defendants' conduct. \n17  134.  Members have also been forced to spend significant time training and protecting \n18  members and leaders from ICE targeting and retaliation.  These measures include preventative \n19  measures, ranging from drafting, developing, and implementing emergency plans, to know-your-\n20  rights trainings, among others. \n21  135.  In addition, Defendants' unlawful retaliation and suppression of free speech has \n22  caused Migrant Justice financial losses.  Migrant Justice regularly serves as obligor for its members' \n23  bond payments while they are in immigration detention.  For instance, Migrant Justice advanced \n24  funds to post bond of $6,000.00 each for members Peche Ventura and Hernandez Ramos.  Migrant \n25  Justice also posts funds into detained members' commissary funds to allow them to purchase \n26  sufficient food while detained and provide transportation for detained individuals once released. \n27  136.  The costs attendant to combating and mitigating Defendants' unconstitutional conduct \n28  extend beyond bond payments.  As the immigration judge overseeing Plaintiffs Balcazar Sanchez's \n24 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 25 of 42\n1  and Palacios Rodriguez's cases observed, advocacy in support of detained members was a strong \n2  factor supporting their release.  Thus, to allow its members the opportunity to post bail, Migrant \n3  Justice has to organize rallies, protests, and marches in support of its detained members.  Costs \n4  associated with these efforts include-but are not limited tc:r-significant staff time, printing costs, \n5  and travel to and from protests which often are located outside of the Boston Immigration Court, \n6  including costs associated with rental cars, charter buses, gas, and mileage reimbursement. \n7  137.  As a result of Defendants' unlawful conduct, Migrant Justice has been forced to \n8  expend significant financial resources, affecting the organization's operating budget, impairing its \n9  ability to function effectively, and creating tangible and articulable damages. \nIO \n10.  ICE Targets Activists Around the Country for Speaking Out. \n11  138.  ICE's efforts to undermine Migrant Justice are part of a pattern of ICE expending \n12  significant resources to target, surveil, arrest, and detain immigrant activists and leaders across the \n13  country in response to their protected political speech and activity. \n14  139.  Since 2016, ICE has taken enforcement against no fewer than twenty high-profile \n15  immigrant activist leaders for their political activism and public speech, including the following \n16  individuals: \n17 \n•  On March 2, 2017, ICE arrested Daniela Vargas of Mississippi, Deferred Action \n18 \nfor Childhood Arrivals (\"DACA\") recipient, after she spoke publicly about ICE \nraiding her family's home and arresting her brother and father. \n19 \n20  •  On May 18, 2017, CBP arrested Claudia Rueda of California, an immigrant rights \nactivist and college student, after she spoke out publicly about her mother's arrest. \n21 \n•  In November 27, 2017, ICE arrested Baltazar Aburto Gutierrez of Washington \n22 \nafter he spoke to a local journalist.  During the arrest, an ICE agent told him \"you \n23  are the one from the newspaper.\" \n24  •  On December 20, 2017, ICE issued a Notice to Appear to and initiated an \nenforcement action against Mam Mora Villalpando of Washington, a longtime \n25 \nactivist and founder of the Northwest Detention Center Resistance. \n26 \n•  On January 3, 2018, ICE arrested Jean Montrevil of New York, a longstanding \n27  activist with the New Sanctuary Coalition.  He was deported less than two weeks \nlater, on January 16, 2018. \n28 \n25 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 26 of 42\n1  •  On January 11, 2018, ICE arrested Ravi Ragbir of New York, a longstanding \nactivist with and Executive Director of the New Sanctuary Coalition.  Ragbir has \n2 \nsince won a stay of removal from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals while his \ncase is appealed. \n3 \n4  •  On January 11, 2018, ICE arrested Eliseo Jurado of Colorado, the husband of \nIngrid Encalada Latorre, a leader in Colorado's sanctuary movement who gained \n5  media attention after she sought sanctuary from detention in a local church. \n6 \n•  On March 7, 2018, ICE arrested Alejandra Pablos of Virginia, a permanent \nresident, after she helped lead a protest in Virginia outside of a DHS office. \n7 \nPablos is a longstanding immigrant activist and field coordinator for the National \n8  Latina Institute for Reproductive Health. \n9  •  In early April 2018, ICE detained Manuel Duran, a Memphis, Tennessee-based \njournalist at the Memphis Noticias newspaper, who has a long history of \n10 \npublicizing reports critical of federal immigration practices. \n11 \n•  On July 24, 2018, in Racine Wisconsin, ICE arrested community leader Ricardo \n12  Fierro, the Council President of the local League of United Latin American \nCitizens (\"LULAC\"). \n13 \n•  In October 2018, ICE detained Eduardo Samaniego of Massachusetts, an \n14 \nimmigrant rights leader and activist, who regularly spoke out against state laws \nthat bar undocumented immigrants from attending higher education.  Samaniego \n15 \nwas denied bond and upon accepting a voluntary departure on January 29, 2018, \n16  must leave the U.S. within 30 days. \n17  140.  On January 26, 2018, thirty-one members of Congress sent a letter to ICE and DHS \n18  expressing concern about the agencies' targeting of activists, which they explained \"may create a \n19  broader chilling effect within the community, dissuading some immigrants from invoking their legal \n20  rights for fear that doing so will result in retaliation by ICE.\"  On March 22, 2018, four members of \n21  Congress sent a letter to ICE expressing concern about retaliation against activists, stating that \"the \n22  use of law enforcement resources to retaliate against critics and political opponents of the President is \n23  contrary to our most basic democratic norms.\" \n24  141.  These arrests reflect an even broader expressed antipathy toward individuals, entities, \n25  and states who choose to challenge the administration's aggressive and intentionally intimidating \n26  enforcement practices.  Retaliatory arrests actively continue around the United States. \n27  C.  The DMV Has a Policy, Pattern, or Practice of Sharing Information with ICE, \nMotivated by Animus Against Latinos and Other Non-White People. \n28 \n26 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 27 of 42\nI  142.  DMV has had a long-standing policy, pattern, and practice of permitting its staff to \n2 \nroutinely and regularly share information with ICE and Border Patrol and to actively seek to facilitate \n3 \nthe immigration enforcement activities of those two agencies. \n4 \n143.  This information-sharing has included passing along information about individuals \n5 \nthat DMV staff believed to be in the country unlawfully and responding to informal ICE requests for \n6 \ninformation about individuals, such as their Driver's Privilege Card application and supporting \n7 \n8  documentation or vehicle registration.  The DMV and ICE worked so closely together that in one \n9 \nOctober 2014 email, ICE Agent Goff emailed DMV Detective Jonathan Purdy thanking him for \nIO \ninformation and commenting, \"We're going to have to make you an honorary ICE officer!\" \n11 \n144.  Beyond providing information, DMV also cooperated by scheduling appointments and \n12 \ndriver's tests around ICE's availability, requiring drivers to come to the DMV office unnecessarily, \n13 \nor imposing criminal charges for the purpose of exposing an individual to greater risk of immigration \n14 \n15  enforcement. \n16  145.  Many of these forms of cooperation were instrumental in the arrests and detention of \n17  the individual Plaintiffs. \n18 \n146.  DMV staff specifically targeted Latinos for these practices: DPC applicants and \n19 \nholders with Latino surnames were far more likely to have their information shared with ICE than \n20 \nthose with non-Latino surnames, despite there being more than four times as many DPC holders and \n21 \napplicants than there are Latinos in Vermont. \n22 \n23  14 7.  The policy, pattern, and practice exhibited by DMV staff and permitted by the DMV \n24  represented a long-standing and deep-seated animus toward Latinos and non-white individuals, and \n25 \nare therefore perceived by DMV staff as \"foreign,\" due to their physical appearance, surname, or \n26 \naccent. \n27 \n28 \n27 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 28 of 42\n1  148.  For example, DMV employees frequently highlighted the race of individuals whom \n2 \nthey intended to investigate or referred to them as \"immigrants\" and \"illegals.\" For instance, in a \n3 \nDecember 2, 2014 email to a supervisor, DMV Investigator Jonathan Purdy recounted how he \n4 \nnoticed people who \"appeared (illegal)\" and \"three people loitering outside (who appeared Mexican)\" \n5 \nat the OMV and called ICE agents' attention to these individuals to investigate.  In the same email, a \n6 \nDMV Investigator gratuitously noted that another DMV employee told him \"she had a Mexican at \n7 \n8  her window who wanted to schedule a permit test.\" \n9 \n149.  In another example, a DMV communication made light of the discrimination: in a \n10 \nNovember 7, 2014 email, a DMV employee sarcastically remarked to a DMV Investigator:  \"I don't \n11 \nwant to discriminate, I don't dare!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" (fifty-three \n12 \nexclamation points in original). \n13 \n150.  That DMV knew of and permitted the discriminatory conduct is without question. \n14 \n15  DMV employees' disproportionate focus on race and perceived ethnicity was evident across a broad \n16  swath of communications received or viewed by supervisors.  As early as October 2014, one DMV \n17 \nofficer included ICE contact regarding \"another possible illegal\" in a \"Weekly Report\" he wrote as a \n18 \nmember of the DMV Investigation Division. \n19 \n151.  DMV supervisors also frequently received direct emails evidencing the animus and \n20 \ndiscriminatory intent.  For example, on October 30, 2014, and many times thereafter, DMV Officer \n21 \nPurdy emailed DMV Supervisor McIntyre-a DMV supervisor-about forwarding information to \n22 \n23  ICE officers.  He emailed her again on November 7, 2014 to express frustration with the DPC \n24  program and to inform her that he forwarded \"a rather large list to ICE,\" writing that he understood \n25 \nthe purpose of the DPC program was to \"accommodate illegal farm workers,\" but that \"it doesn't \n26 \nappear to me these are farm workers!\"  In that same email, Purdy asked McIntyre why the state is \n27 \n28 \n28 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 29 of 42\n1  \"turning a blind eye toward illegals.\"  And McIntyre received Purdy's email referring to people at the \n2 \nOMV who \"appeared illegal\" and \"appeared Mexican.\" \n3 \n152.  Additional emails from this time period demonstrate DMV's association of ethnicity \n4 \nand race with immigration status, and fixation on the perceived immigration status of DPC \n5 \napplicants.  For example, on December 4, 2014, a OMV employee wrote to a colleague in response to \n6 \nan exchange about compiling a list of addresses and residents, \"Holy crap is right, we are being over \n7 \n8  run [sic] by immigrants.\"  Another OMV employee noted that mail from one of the investigated \n9  addresses was \"all [addressed to] 'South of the Border' names.\" \n10 \n153.  OMV staff would also regularly and routinely open investigations-including \n11 \ncontacting ICE-for no apparent reason other than the fact that the applicant presented a document \n12 \nfrom a Latin American country as identification or otherwise appeared \"foreign\" because they were \n13 \nnon-white.  In one case in July 2016, a OMV employee admitted that \"We don't have a violation of \n14 \nthe DPC law,\" but sent the driver's information to ICE anyway.  In another instance, in February \n15 \n16  2016, a OMV employee sent a name to an ICE Agent and asked ICE \"to check the guy for federal \n17 \nwarrants, deportation orders, etc.,\" despite there being no appearance of a violation.  When ICE \n18 \nresponded that the applicant had lawful immigration status, the OMV employee then facilitated \n19 \nchecking the applicant's brother. \n20 \n154.  On September 23, 2016, a OMV investigator emailed to his supervisors a list of his \n21 \ninvestigations broken down by race.  The suspects of his investigations were disproportionately \n22 \n23  Latino.  Of 11 \"Total Persons Encountered\" between April 1 and September 23, 2016, the list notes \n24  \"IO Hispanic, I Caucasian,\" and a similar ratio of \"8 Hispanic, l Caucasian\" for investigations that \n25 \nresulted in \"Suspend/Cancel,\" meaning the DPCs issued to the persons investigated were either \n26 \nsuspended or their issuance canceled.  That breakdown, though anecdotal, stands in sharp contrast to \n27 \nthe breakdown of Vermont's population.  Only about 10,900 Vermonters identify as \"Hispanic or \n28 \n29 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 30 of 42\n1  Latino (of any race),\" while 585,154 people-93.4% of the total Vermont population-identify as \n2 \n\"White alone, not Hispanic or Latino.\" \n3 \n155.  DMV's conduct motivated by prejudice against non-white individuals particularly \n4 \nLatinos, was so pervasive that, in an Investigative Report dated November 10, 2015, the Vermont \n5 \nHuman Rights Commission found reasonable cause to believe that DMV engaged in discriminatory \n6 \npractices.  These practices included falsifying information on an individual's DPC application by \n7 \n8  checking a box for \"proof of legal status\" which the individual had left blank and then investigating \n9  him for purportedly providing that false information.  The DMV applied its investigatory and referral \n10 \npolicy-which the Report characterized as \"vague\"-in a discriminatory fashion. \n11 \n156.  The Human Rights Commission found that the DMV had worked to entrap the same \n12 \nindividual and facilitate his arrest into ICE custody.  The report noted specifically that the DMV's \n13 \nconduct-routing a DPC applicant into ICE custody because of their suspected immigration status \n14 \n15  was \"at odds with the very intent of the [Driver Privilege Card] law,\" thereby engaging in \"exactly \n16  the thing that the DPC law was designed to prevent.\" ( emphasis in original).  The Commission \n17 \nconcluded that \"no white citizen [Driver Privilege Card] applicants have ever been referred [to \n18 \nimmigration officials] for investigation,\" while many non-white individuals had been, and that the \n19 \nDMV was \"markedly hostile and objectively unreasonable\" to the claimant \"because of' [his] status \n20 \nas a non-white [] person [of Middle Eastern ethnicity].\" \n21 \n157.  On July 11, 2016, responding to the Human Rights Commission's investigations, \n22 \n23  Nancy Prescott, DMV Branch Operations Manager, instructed DMV employees by email that they \n24  \"shouldn't be contacting homeland/ice at any point without being advised.\" [sic] \n25 \n158.  On August 25, 2016, the DMV entered a settlement agreement to resolve the \n26 \ninvestigation concerning the pervasive anti-immigrant bias (\"Settlement Agreement\"). \n27 \n28 \n30 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 31 of 42\n1  159.  The Settlement Agreement, inter alia, sharply restricted the DMV's ability to transmit \n2 \na DPC applicant's information to ICE.  For instance, Section 2 of the Settlement Agreement provides: \n3 \n\"That subject to the provisions of the Drivers' Privacy Protection Act, absent subpoena or a criminal \n4 \nwarrant, DPC information contained on Applications shall be confidential including but not limited to \n5 \ninformation related to legal presence, or national origin.\" \n6 \n160.  The Drivers' Privacy Protection Act does not require the DMV to share confidential \n7 \n8  information with ICE for immigration enforcement purposes. \n9  161.  The prohibition extends beyond immigration status to other aspects of the application, \n10 \nsuch as the form itself and information accompanying the form, such as photos and vehicle \n11 \nregistration information.  The settlement agreement also required DMV \"to adopt the essential \n12 \nelements of the Model Fair & Impartial Policing ('FIP') policy as adopted by the Vermont Criminal \n13 \nJustice Training Council [] as well as all of the non-essential elements [not listed here].\"  The FIP \n14 \n15  policy that OMV was required to adopt included the following provisions: \n16  •  \"Federal law does not grant local and state agencies authority to enforce civil immigration \n17 \nlaw.  Similarly, state law does not grant local and state agencies authority to enforce \n18 \nimmigration laws.  [The DMVJ shall not dedicate [DMVJ time or resources to the \n19 \nenforcement off ederal immigration law where the only violation of law is presence in the \n20 \nUnited States without authorization or documentation.\" (emphasis added). \n21 \n22  •  Similarly, OMV officials \"shall not facilitate the detention of undocumented individuals \n23  or individuals suspected of being undocumented by federal immigration authorities for \n24 \nsuspected civil immigration violations.\" \n25 \n162.  In a memorandum dated January 31, 2017, Michael A. Smith, OMV Director of \n26 \nOperations, relayed the terms of the settlement to all OMV staff statewide.  The memo directed: \"DO \n27 \n28 \n31 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 32 of 42\n1  NOT run [immigration status] checks on undocumented applicants,\" regardless of the documentation \n2 \nsubmitted. \n3 \n163.  Yet, notwithstanding entering into the Settlement Agreement and issuing this \n4 \nguidance, OMV staff still engage in a policy, pattern, and practice of anti-immigrant animus and \n5 \nOMV leadership does not ensure that staff refrain from discriminatory conduct. \n6 \n164.  For example, staff continue to share information and otherwise cooperate with ICE \n7 \n8  even when such cooperation is contrary to agency policy.  In April 2017, a DMV investigator told \n9  Seven Days, a Vermont news publication, that the settlement and FIP policy \"doesn't make any \n10 \ndifference\" for his work. He also stated: \"I'm not familiar with the settlement because, really, I don't \n11 \nhave any interest with the settlement.\" \n12 \n165.  Further, in 2017, OMV staff shared information with immigration enforcement \n13 \nagencies about the following Individual Plaintiffs and Migrant Justice members: \n14 \n15  •  On March 9, 2017, a OMV employee sent the license plate information for Plaintiff \nBalcazar Sanchez to an ICE Officer. \n16 \n•  On March 13, 2017, a OMV employee transmitted Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez's OPC \n17 \napplication to an ICE Officer.  In the margins of the application, a DMV employee had \nwritten the words \"UNDOCUMENTED\" and \"PRNILEGE CARD.\" The OMV also \n18 \nprovided other personally identifying documents.  See supra, ,i 84. \n19 \n•  On March 15, 2017, I CE arrested Migrant Justice member Carrillo Sanchez.  The 1-\n20 \n213 that ICE wrote for Carrillo Sanchez notes that ICE determined his alienage \nthrough his Vermont OMV OPC application, including a copy of his Mexican \n21 \npassport and his Mexican birth certificate. The DMV would have transmitted this \n22  information to ICE on or about March 2017.  See supra, ,i 71. \n23  •  On June 19, 2017, a OMV employee provided information about Migrant Justice \nmember Peche Ventura's OPC application and vehicular information to ICE officials. \n24  See supra, ,i 105. \n25 \n166.  Recent public records requests confirm that OMV staff continues a pattern and \n26 \npractice of sharing information with ICE and Border Patrol motivated by a dislike of non-white \n27 \nindividuals, and Latinos in particular. \n28 \n32 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 33 of 42\n1  167.  Records obtained via a public records request in 2018 show that DMV continued to \n2 \nrespond to ICE inquiries, voluntarily providing ICE with confidential information including photos, \n3 \ncar registration information, and copies of applications.  The routine nature of these communications \n4 \nsuggests a regular, ongoing practice. \n5 \n168.  Furthermore, after the publication of emails between ICE and DMV in October 2016, \n6 \nwhich painted the DMV in a critical light, DMV employees have chosen to limit their electronic mail \n7 \n8  communications and have undertaken to communicate with ICE via telephone. For example, after the \n9  Settlement Agreement, in a December 1, 2016 email, a DMV investigator forwarded his emails with \n10 \nICE in response to a public records request, noting that \"[m]ost of my interactions [with ICE] have \n11 \nbeen via phone.\" \n12 \n169.  This ongoing cooperation between the DMV, ICE, and CBP is enabled by DMV \n13 \nsupervisors who tum a blind eye to the discriminatory conduct of their staff.  There are only four \n14 \n15  Criminal Investigators in the DMV Investigations Unit, overseen by two Criminal Unit Supervisors \n16  and a Chief Inspector.  Given the pattern of information-sharing by DMV officers, as well as DMV \n17 \nofficers' documented animus against Latinos and other non-white individuals-in some instances \n18 \ndocumented in emails to DMV supervisors-OMV supervisors know of or should know of the \n19 \nongoing constitutional violations. \n20 \n21 \nCOUNT ONE \n22 \nVIOLATION OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT \nOF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION \n23 \n(INTERFERENCE WITH FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION) \n24  (All Plaintiffs against DHS Defendants) \n25 \n170.  The right to expressive association \"is implicit in the right to engage in activities \n26 \n27  protected by the First Amendment.\" Roberts v. Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609,622 (1984).  To have a \n28 \n33 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 34 of 42\n1  protectable right of expressive association, \"a group must engage in some form of expression, \n2  whether it is public or private.\"  Boy Scouts ofA merica v. Dale, 530 U.S. 640, 648 (2000). \n3  171.  Plaintiffs have engaged and continue to engage in protected speech and conduct. \n4  Individual Plaintiffs, through their membership in Migrant Justice, have engaged and continue to \n5  engage in political activism and advocacy against discriminatory government practices. A key part of \n6  their activism is meeting with other migrant workers to discuss and analyze shared problems and to \n7  envision collective solutions.  Plaintiff Migrant Justice continues its efforts to encourage greater \n8  numbers of migrant workers in Vermont to join the organization and advocate for their rights. \n9  172.  By targeting, surveilling, infiltrating, and engaging in disinformation towards Migrant \n10  Justice members, Defendants directly and substantially interfere with Individual Plaintiffs' ability to \n11  associate with Migrant Justice and with Migrant Justice and its members' ability to join together. \n12  Defendants have caused a significant chill oflndividual Plaintiffs' and Migrant Justice's members' \n13  rights to associate.  Defendants' comments that associate immigration enforcement with Migrant \n14  Justice activity and their ongoing surveillance and infiltration, have instilled in Plaintiffs and other \n15  members and potential members ongoing fear of reprisal that has limited Plaintiffs' ability to \n16  associate freely. \n17  173.  Plaintiffs-Migrant Justice on its own behalf and on behalf of its membership, as well \n18  as all Individual Plaintiffs-wish to continue engaging in their First Amendment-protected activities \n19  to the fullest extent possible, but, as a result of Defendants' past, present, and likely future conduct, \n20  are deterred from doing so. \n21  174.  Defendants' targeting, infiltration, disinformation campaign, and surveillance of \n22  Migrant Justice serves no compelling governmental interest.  Nor does it reflect the least restrictive \n23  means of engaging in immigration enforcement activities. \n24  175.  Defendants' actions cause Plaintiffs significant harm, including chilling Plaintiffs' \n25  speech, frustrating Migrant Justice's mission, causing Migrant Justice to divert significant resources, \n26  as well as financial harm. \n27 \n28 \n34 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 35 of 42\n1  176.  Individual Plaintiffs have reason to fear that ICE may take continued action that \n2  infringes on their associational rights, for example by revoking their bond for participation in Migrant \n3  Justice activities. \nCOUNT TWO \n4 \nVIOLATION OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT \nOF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION \n5 \n(FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND FREEDOM TO PETITION) \n6  (All Plaintiffs against DHS Defendants) \n177.  \"The rights to complain to public officials and to seek administrative and judicial \n7 \n8  relief are protected by the First Amendment.\"  Gagliardi v.  Vil!. ofP  awling, 18 F.3d. 188, 194 (2d \n9  Cir. 1994).  \"[T]o petition for a redress of grievances is among the most precious of liberties \n1o    safeguarded by the Bill of Rights\" and is \"intimately connected ... with other First Amendment \n11  rights of free speech and free press.\"  Id. at 195 (internal alterations and quotation marks omitted). \n12  178.  Plaintiffs have engaged and continue to engage in protected speech and conduct. \n13  Individual Plaintiffs, through their membership in Migrant Justice, Inc., have engaged and continue to \n14  engage in protected speech including, but not limited to, Migrant Justice's continuous political \n15  activism and advocacy to safeguard the right to freedom of movement and access to transportation, to \n16  freedom from discrimination, and to improved living and working conditions.  Plaintiffs' activism \n17  has included petitioning elected officials to intervene and government agencies to provide relief \n18  against discriminatory government practices. \n19  179.  Defendants are engaged in a campaign of targeting, surveilling, infiltrating, providing \n20  disinformation, arresting, and detaining Migrant Justice and its members, including Individual \n21  Plaintiffs, that goes beyond legitimate law enforcement and surveillance activities. \n22  180.  Defendants engagement in these activities undermines Migrant Justice's efforts and \n23  abridges Migrant Justice and its members' ability to engage in protected speech and petition \n24  activities. \n25  181.  Defendants actions inhibit reasonable migrant workers from fully exercising their \n26  rights to engage in speech and to petition the government. \n27  182.  Defendants actions have significantly affected Plaintiffs' ability to advocate their \n28  viewpoints and have caused a significant chill of Plaintiffs' rights to speak freely and petition the \n35 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 36 of 42\n1  government under the First Amendment.  Defendants' targeting, surveillance, and harassment, \n2  actions would not have occurred but for Plaintiffs' protected speech. \n3  183.  Plaintiffs-Migrant Justice on its own behalf and on behalf of its membership, as well \n4  as all the Individual Plaintiffs-wish to continue engaging in their First Amendment-protected \n5  activities to the fullest extent possible, but, as a result of Defendants' past, present, and likely future \n6  conduct, are deterred from doing so. \n7  184.  Defendants cause Plaintiffs significant harm, including chilling Plaintiffs' speech, \n8  frustrating Migrant Justice's mission, causing Migrant Justice to divert significant resources, as well \n9  as financial harm. \nCOUNT THREE \n10 \nVIOLATION OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT \nOF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION \n11 \n(RETALIATION) \n12  (Migrant Justice against all DHS Defendants) \n13  185.  To prevail on a First Amendment retaliation claim, a plaintiff must show \"(I) that the \n14  speech or conduct at issue was protected, (2) that the defendant took adverse action against the \n15  plaintiff, and (3) that there was a causal connection between the protected speech and the adverse \n16  action.\" Gonzalez v. Hasty, 802 F.3d 212,222 (2d Cir. 2015) (quotation marks omitted). \n17  186.  Migrant Justice has engaged and continues to engage in protected speech and conduct. \n18  Its members have engaged and continue to engage in political activism and advocacy against \n19  discriminatory government practices. \n20  187.  By targeting, surveilling, infiltrating, and spreading disinformation to Migrant Justice \n21  members, Defendants significantly affect the organization's ability to advocate its viewpoints and \n22  hinder Migrant Justice's ability to advocate for economic protections for migrant farmworkers. \n23  188.  Defendants' prior retaliatory conduct, including but not limited to surveillance and \n24  infiltration, have instilled in Migrant Justice's members an ongoing fear of reprisal that has limited \n25  the ability of its members to speak and associate freely and has therefore chilled the organization's \n26  speech as a whole.  Migrant Justice's First Amendment-protected activity motivates Defendants' \n27  targeting, surveillance, infiltration, and disinformation activities, which would not occur but for the \n28  organization's protected speech. \n36 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 37 of 42\n1  189.  Migrant Justice wishes to continue engaging in its First Amendment-protected \n2  activities to the fullest extent possible, but, as a result of Defendants' past, present, and likely future \n3  conduct, the organization has been deterred from being able to do so. \n4  190.  Defendants' actions cause Migrant Justice significant harm, including chilling \n5  members' speech, frustrating Migrant Justice's mission, causing Migrant Justice to divert significant \n6  resources, as well as financial harm. \n7 \nCOUNT FOUR \n8 \nVIOLATION OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT OF THE U.S. CONSTITUTION \n(EQUAL PROTECTION) \n9 \n(Plaintiff Migrant Justice, on behalf of its Members, against Defendant Minoli) \n10 \n11  191.  Plaintiffs bring this claim against Defendant Minoli in her official capacity under 42 \n12  U.S.C. § 1983 and Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908). \n13 \n192.  DMV employees consistently share personally identifying information about Plaintiffs \n14 \nwith ICE.  This information-sharing disproportionately targets and impacts non-white and Latino \n15 \nresidents, and arises out of pervasive animus within the Vermont DMV against such individuals. \n16 \n193.  By sharing personally identifying information in this way and with this motivation, \n17 \n18  Defendants deny Plaintiffs equal protection of the laws. U.S. Const., Amend. XIV,§ 1. \n19  194.  The DMV were motivated by animus against non-white and Latino individuals. \n20 \nCOUNT FIVE \nVIOLATION OF THE FEDERAL TORT CLAIMS ACT 28 U.S.C. § 2671 \n21 \n(INVASION OF PRIVACY:  INTRUSION ON SECLUSION) \n22  (All Plaintiffs against Defendant United States) \n195.  Plaintiff Migrant Justice asserts this claim on behalf of its membership. \n23 \n196.  Plaintiffs adequately exhausted their administrative remedies as required under 28 \n24 \n25  U.S.C. § 2675 by filing federal tort claims against DHS on the basis of the incidents alleged.  DHS \ndenied all claims by letters dated June 11, 2018. \n26 \n197.  By committing the above-described acts, including but not limited to enlisting an \n27 \ninformant to surveil Plaintiffs at non-public meetings and in private spaces, eavesdropping on private \n28 \n37 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 38 of 42\n1  conversations and engaging in physical surveillance and harassment, Defendants committed a \n2  substantial and highly offensive interference within Plaintiffs' solitude. \n3  198.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's breaches of duties, Plaintiffs have \n4  suffered and continue to suffer damages. \n5  199.  Plaintiffs are entitled to damages against the United States for invasion of privacy to \n6  the full extent allowed under Vermont law and the FTCA, in an amount to be determined by the trier \n7  of fact. \n8  200.  Under the Federal Tort Claims Act, defendant United States of America is liable for \n9  these actions. \nCOUNT SIX \n10 \nVIOLATION OF THE FEDERAL TORT CLAIMS ACT 28 U.S.C. § 2671 \n(INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS) \n11 \n(All Plaintiffs against Defendant United States) \n12 \n201.  Plaintiffs adequately exhausted their administrative remedies as required under 28 \n13 \nU.S.C. § 2675 by filing federal tort claims against DHS on the basis of the incidents alleged.  DHS \n14 \ndenied all claims by letters dated June 11, 2018. \n15 \n202.  By committing the above-described acts, including but not limited to ongoing \n16 \nsurveillance and harassment, the knowledge obtained from which was used to intimidate Plaintiffs, as \n17 \nwell as arrests conducted in a public and unnecessarily aggressive manner, Defendants, engaging in \n18 \nintentional extreme and outrageous conduct, caused Plaintiffs to suffer extreme emotional distress. \n19 \n203.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's breaches of duties, Plaintiffs have \n20 \nsuffered and continue to suffer damages. \n21 \n204.  Plaintiffs are entitled to damages against the United States for intentional infliction of \n22 \nemotional distress to the full extent allowed under Vermont law and the FTCA, in an amount to be \n23 \ndetermined by the trier of fact. \n24 \n205.  Under the Federal Tort Claims Act, defendant United States of America is liable for \n25 \nthese actions. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n38 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 39 of 42\n1  COUNT SEVEN \nVIOLATION OF THE FEDERAL TORT CLAIMS ACT 28 U.S.C. § 2671 \n2 \n(FALSE IMPRISONMENT) \nPlaintiff Balcazar Sanchez against Defendant United States) \n3 \n206.  Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez adequately exhausted his administrative remedies as \n4 \nrequired under 28 U.S.C. § 2675 by filing a federal tort claim against DHS on the basis of his March \n5 \n17, 2017 arrest.  OHS denied Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez's claim on June 11, 2018. \n6 \n207.  Here, Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez shows that a person intentionally confined him \n7 \nwithout the privilege to do so, and that person was conscious of the confinement. \n8 \n208.  By arresting and detaining Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez pursuant to a retaliatory official \n9 \npolicy related to his First Amendment-protected activity, Defendants confined him without the \n10 \nprivilege to do so.  Regardless of whether there was probable cause for an arrest, law enforcement \n11 \nofficials lack the privilege to arrest an individual pursuant to a retaliatory policy.  The confinement \n12 \ncaused Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez injury. \n13 \n209.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants' breaches of duties, Plaintiff Balcazar \n14 \nSanchez has suffered and continues to suffer damages. \n15 \n210.  Plaintiff Balcazar Sanchez is entitled to damages against the United States for false \n16 \nimprisonment to the full extent allowed under Vermont law and the FTCA, in an amount to be \n17 \ndetermined by the trier of fact. \n18 \n211.  Under the Federal Tort Claims Act, defendant United States of America is liable for \n19 \nthese actions. \n20 \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n21 \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court: \n22 \nA.  Declare that OHS Defendants' actions violate Plaintiffs' First Amendment rights by (1) \n23 \ninfringing on their right to free association without a compelling governmental interest or \n24 \nusing narrowly tailored means; (2) unlawfully targeting, surveilling, infiltrating, spreading \n25 \ndisinformation, and harassing individuals to interfere with their ability to exercise their rights \n26 \nto free speech and to petition the government; and (3) unlawfully targeting, surveilling, \n27 \ninfiltrating, spreading disinformation, and harassing individuals as retaliation for their prior \n28 \n39 \n\nCase 5:18-cv-00192-gwc   Document 22   Filed 02/07/19   Page 40 of 42\n1  exercise of the right to free speech and free association and the right to petition the \n2  government; \n3  B.  Enjoin the DHS Defendants and any of their officers, agents, successors, employees, \n4  representatives and any and all persons acting in concert with them, prohibiting them from: \n5  I.

Surveilling, infiltrating, spreading disinformation, arresting, and detaining Migrant Justice \n8  members to inhibit the exercise of their rights to speech, association, and petition; \n9  3.  Surveilling, infiltrating, spreading disinformation, arresting, and detaining Migrant Justice \n10  members in retaliation for their prior exercise of their rights to speech, association, and \n11  petition; \n12  4.  Using a confidential informant to complete any of the above; \n13  C.  Declare that the DMV's actions violate Plaintiffs' Equal Protection rights by sharing \n14  information with ICE in a manner that is motivated by animus against Latinos and other non \n15  white individuals; \n16  D.  Grant injunctive relief against Defendant Minoli and any of her officers, agents, successors, \n17  employees, representatives and any and all persons acting in concert with her: \n18  1.
