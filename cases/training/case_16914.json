          "description": "OPINION AND ORDER: This Court does not reject the Proposed Consent Decree lightly. The rejection of this decree will likely delay sorely needed relief for NYCHA tenants while the parties decide whether to re−negotiate, seek administrative remedies, litigate, or appeal, and a courts refusal to accept a proposed consent decree may have practical consequences for the governments ability to negotiate future settlements. Microsoft Corp., 56 F.3d at 1456. But as it stands, the proposed decree suffers from fatal procedural flaws, including its formless injunctive relief and enforcement mechanisms. The proposed decree also raises serious concerns implicating the separation of powers and the delegation of equitable judicial power, which appear attributable at least in part to the parties sidestepping of the existing statutory scheme to address public housing failures. And on a more basic level, the nature of the claims asserted by the Government raises questions as to the scope and applicability of Citigroup. Any judicial decree entered in this action will have a direct, tangible, and long−lasting impact not only on the parties, but most importantly on NYCHAs tenants. Because the Proposed Consent Decree is not fair and reasonable, and because its entry would disserve the public interest, the Governments motion for approval is denied. The parties are directed to submit a joint status report by December 14, 2018 detailing their respective positions on how they wish to proceed. That status report should also advise this Court regarding NYCHAs compliance to date with its obligations under paragraphs 67−70 of the Proposed Consent Decree. The Clerk of Court is directed to terminate the motion pending at ECF No. 43. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge William H. Pauley, III on 11/14/2018) (jca) (Entered: 11/14/2018)"

The rejection of this decree will likely delay sorely needed relief for NYCHA tenants while the parties decide whether to re-negotiate, seek administrative remedies, litigate, or appeal, and a courts refusal to accept a proposed consent decree may have practical consequences for the governments ability to negotiate future settlements. Microsoft Corp., 56 F.3d at 1456. But as it stands, the proposed decree suffers from fatal procedural flaws, including its formless injunctive relief and enforcement mechanisms. The proposed decree also raises serious concerns implicating the separation of powers and the delegation of equitable judicial power, which appear attributable at least in part to the parties sidestepping of the existing statutory scheme to address public housing failures. And on a more basic level, the nature of the claims asserted by the Government raises questions as to the scope and applicability of Citigroup. Any judicial decree entered in this action will have a direct, tangible, and long-lasting impact not only on the parties, but most importantly on NYCHAs tenants. Because the Proposed Consent Decree is not fair and reasonable, and because its entry would disserve the public interest, the Governments motion for approval is denied. The parties are directed to submit a joint status report by December 14, 2018 detailing their respective positions on how they wish to proceed. That status report should also advise this Court regarding NYCHAs compliance to date with its obligations under paragraphs 67-70 of the Proposed Consent Decree. The Clerk of Court is directed to terminate the motion pending at ECF No. 43. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge William H. Pauley, III on 11/14/2018) (jca) (Entered: 11/14/2018)"

    "summary": "<p>On June 11, 2018, the U.S. Government filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York. The plaintiff sued the New York City Housing Authority (\"NYCHA\") under the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. § 1437d(j)(3)), the federal Anti-Fraud Injunction Act (18 U.S.C. § 1345), and the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. § 2616(a)(1)). The government sought injunctive relief, appointment of a monitor, and equitable relief. The plaintiff claimed that NYCHA violated the basic health and safety regulations of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and repeatedly engaged in deceptive practices. Specifically, they claimed that NYCHA failed to protect the residents from lead paint, failed to provide \"decent, safe, and sanitary\" housing per HUD's regulations, falsely said that they comply with HUD's regulations by disguising the true conditions of its properties, provided inadequate heat to the homes, and did not fix leaks, peeling paint, and other deteriorations. The plaintiff also claimed that NYCHA's typical response to external inquiries is to cover up or minimize problems that it knows to exist and make false statements to HUD and the public. The case was assigned to Judge William H. Pauley III. </p><p>In addition to filing the complaint on June 11, 2018, the plaintiff also submitted a proposed consent decree calling for a non-judicial monitor, and among other injunctive and monetary agreements: </p><p><blockquote></p><p>(1) a requirement that NYCHA comply with federal, state, and local lead paint statutes and regulations; </p><p>(2) a requirement that NYCHA comply with federal regulations requiring HUD housing to be decent, safe, sanitary, and in good repair;</p><p>(3) injunctive relief requiring NYCHA to establish a Compliance Department, Environmental Health and Safety Department, and Quality Assurance Unit in consultation with the monitor; and</p><p>(4) injunctive relief requiring NYCHA to comply with federal regulations and rules relating to lead-safe work practices, lead abatement, lead paint disclosure and notification, and prioritization of lead paint hazards.</p><p></blockquote></p><p>On November 14, 2018, Judge Pauley III denied the consent decree for not being fair, reasonable, or consistent with the public interest. He also claimed that it had fatal procedural flaws, including unrealistic enforcement mechanisms. 347 F.Supp.3d 182.</p><p>On January 31, 2019 the parties signed an agreement that called for the appointment of a non-judicial monitor. The agreement provided that within 14 days of appointment of the monitor, the plaintiff would voluntary dismiss the claims without prejudice. The parties also filed a joint motion to stay the proceedings for forty-five days in order to allow them to obtain a monitor to satisfy the condition precedent to dismissal under the parties’ agreement. On February 1, 2019, Judge Pauley III approved this motion.</p><p>On March 14, 2019 the plaintiff filed a notice of voluntary dismissal without prejudice, and the court ordered the case be dismissed without prejudice on March 15, 2019 because the parties had appointed a monitor on February 28, 2019 and finalized a settlement agreement. The defendant agreed to remedy the deficient conditions in NYCHA properties, comply with all obligations under federal law, reform its management structure, and coordinate with HUD and the City. </p><p>The settlement required installing a monitor to oversee development, issuing quarterly reports, convening with a community engagement committee, and changing the leadership (CEO) for NYCHA. Additionally, NYCHA was required to meet specified compliance requirements for lead paint and other health and safety issues, establish a compliance department, environmental health and safety department, a quality insurance unit, submit to inspections, and update all systems related to heat, elevators, trash, pests, and other disruptions. The monitor, HUD, EPA, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office all held certain oversight roles under the agreement. </p><p>At any time five years from the effective settlement date (March 15, 2019), either party can move to terminate the agreement and it will be terminated if the defendants have satisfied the specified criteria, which includes with compliance with obligations outlined in settlement for the twelve months prior to requesting termination and complying with all applicable laws. Regarding costs, the settlement required the City to bear the costs of the monitor, consultant, and all updates necessary. The City agreed to commit at least $2.2 billion in funding in the next 10 years to address issues with the NYCHA buildings. If the defendant fails to comply with the agreement, HUD, EPA, or the United States may enforce the agreement by seeking injunctive relief or an order of specific performance. The court agreed to retain jurisdiction over the settlement until termination of the agreement.  As of May 29, 2020, there was no additional activity on this case. The settlement agreement is ongoing.</p>",

The rejection of this decree will likely delay sorely needed relief for NYCHA\ntenants while the parties decide whether to re−negotiate, seek administrative remedies,\nlitigate, or appeal, and a courts refusal to accept a proposed consent decree may have\npractical consequences for the governments ability to negotiate future settlements.\nMicrosoft Corp., 56 F.3d at 1456. But as it stands, the proposed decree suffers from\nfatal procedural flaws, including its formless injunctive relief and enforcement\nmechanisms. The proposed decree also raises serious concerns implicating the\nseparation of powers and the delegation of equitable judicial power, which appear\nattributable at least in part to the parties sidestepping of the existing statutory scheme\nto address public housing failures. And on a more basic level, the nature of the claims\nasserted by the Government raises questions as to the scope and applicability of\nCitigroup. Any judicial decree entered in this action will have a direct, tangible, and\nlong−lasting impact not only on the parties, but most importantly on NYCHAs tenants.\nBecause the Proposed Consent Decree is not fair and reasonable, and because its entry\nwould disserve the public interest, the Governments motion for approval is denied.\nThe parties are directed to submit a joint status report by December 14, 2018 detailing\ntheir respective positions on how they wish to proceed. That status report should also\nadvise this Court regarding NYCHAs compliance to date with its obligations under\nparagraphs 67−70 of the Proposed Consent Decree. The Clerk of Court is directed to\nterminate the motion pending at ECF No. 43. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nWilliam H.

The New York City Housing Authority (“NYCHA”) violates basic health and \nsafety regulations of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”).  These \nregulations require NYCHA to protect children from the lead paint that is present within \napartments in roughly thirty percent of NYCHA developments and, more generally, to provide \nresidents decent, safe, and sanitary housing.  NYCHA has repeatedly made false statements to \nHUD and the public regarding these issues, and has deceived HUD inspectors.   \n2.  The people who suffer as a result of NYCHA’s misconduct are its residents, \nincluding lead-poisoned children; elderly residents without heat in winter; asthma sufferers whose \ncondition is worsened by moldy and pest-infested apartments; and disabled residents without \nfunctioning elevators.   \n3.  Lead is toxic, and there is no safe level of exposure; in children, lead can have \ndevastating effects.  The most common cause of lead poisoning in children is exposure to \ndeteriorated lead paint.  NYCHA knows that there is lead paint within apartment units in roughly \nthirty percent of its developments, but has failed—and continues to fail—to protect its residents \nfrom that paint when it peels and crumbles.  NYCHA has for years failed to follow key HUD lead \npaint safety regulations including, among other things, by failing to find and remediate peeling \nlead paint in its developments and failing to ensure that NYCHA’s workers use lead-safe work \npractices to avoid disturbing lead paint that might injure residents.  Since at least 2011, NYCHA \nsenior managers have known that NYCHA was violating HUD lead paint requirements.  Beyond \nHUD’s requirements, NYCHA has also violated lead paint safety regulations promulgated by the \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). \n4.  Children have been harmed as a result of NYCHA’s failures.  Between 2010 and \n2016 at least 19 lead-poisoned children were found to have been exposed to deteriorated lead \n2 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 3 of 80\npaint in their NYCHA apartments.  These 19 children are at risk of lifelong neurological \nproblems.  But the 19 cases understate the true extent of lead poisoning likely to have been caused \nby crumbling lead paint at NYCHA.  Many hundreds of additional children living at NYCHA \nhave been reported to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (“NYC \nDOH”) as having tested at or above the Centers for Disease Control’s “reference level”—the level \nat which public health actions should be initiated.  But NYC DOH is only able to investigate a \nfraction of the cases reported to it to determine whether the children’s apartments contain peeling \nlead paint.  Moreover, NYC DOH’s information is incomplete because it is based solely on \nreports from medical professionals who have tested children for lead, and does not include the \nmany children living at NYCHA who have not been tested but nonetheless may have lead \npoisoning.  There is every reason to believe the true number of children with lead poisoning is \nmaterially higher.    \n5.  Beyond lead paint, HUD regulations also require NYCHA to provide “decent, \nsafe, and sanitary” housing.  This “decent, safe, and sanitary” regulation requires not only that \nNYCHA comply with lead paint safety rules but also that it provide an environment free of mold \nand pest infestations and with adequate heat and functional elevators.  Every year, NYCHA \ncertifies that it is in fact complying with HUD’s regulations, and HUD has paid NYCHA billions \nof dollars to operate in compliance with them.   \n6.  To enable HUD to determine whether public housing meets this basic standard, \nHUD created an inspection regime—the Public Housing Assessment System—to allow HUD to \ndetermine whether a housing agency is providing decent, safe, and sanitary housing.  NYCHA has \nundermined HUD’s inspections by disguising the true condition of its properties.  This deception \nincluded turning off water to developments to prevent HUD inspectors from observing leaks; \n3 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 4 of 80\nposting “danger” signs to keep inspectors away from troubled areas; and temporarily hiding \nimproperly stored hazardous materials.  NYCHA management even included a document with \nsuggestions for deceiving inspectors in NYCHA’s official training materials.  This cover-up \n“how-to” guide was only removed in Summer 2017, after this Office called its existence to the \nattention of NYCHA’s outside lawyers. \n7.  NYCHA’s conduct undermined HUD’s inspection regime and HUD’s ability to \nuse that regime to determine whether NYCHA complies with the “decent, safe, and sanitary” \nrequirement.  In fact, living conditions at NYCHA are far from “decent, safe, and sanitary.”  Mold \ngrows unchecked at many NYCHA developments, often on a large scale.  Across the city, \nresidents are provided inadequate heat in winter, leading to frigid apartment temperatures.  Pests \nand vermin infestations are common, and as senior New York City officials have acknowledged, \nNYCHA “has no idea how to handle rats.”  Elevators often fail, leaving elderly or disabled \nresidents trapped in their apartments or sleeping in building lobbies because they cannot return to \ntheir homes.  Leaks, peeling paint, and other deterioration are commonplace, but go unaddressed.   \n8.  NYCHA is well aware that disclosing its failure to protect residents from lead \npaint and its failure to provide decent, safe and sanitary housing would lead to unwanted \nregulatory scrutiny—including potential limitations on future HUD funding.  To avoid this, \nNYCHA hid conditions from inspectors and repeatedly made false statements to HUD and the \npublic to cover up what can be covered up and minimize what cannot.  NYCHA’s false \nstatements have occurred both in formal submissions to HUD and in letters, emails, and press \nreleases directed at HUD and the public.   \n9.  Numerous false statements are detailed in this complaint.  But some important \nexamples are the following: \n4 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 5 of 80\n•  Every year from 2011 until well after this Office’s investigation began, NYCHA \nfalsely certified to HUD that NYCHA will comply with HUD’s lead paint safety \nregulations and also complies with other applicable regulations, including those \nrequiring “decent, safe, and sanitary” housing.  NYCHA made these false \ncertifications as part of its applications to obtain billions of dollars in funding from \nHUD.  But during this entire period, NYCHA was substantially out of compliance \nwith these important regulations.  \n \n•  In 2015 and 2016, NYCHA made false statements to HUD and the public \nregarding its lead paint compliance.  Press reports in 2015 told the story of a child \nwith dangerously high levels of lead in her blood, and articles in 2016 reported on \nthis Office’s investigation.  To deflect the resulting scrutiny, NYCHA falsely told \nHUD and the public that NYCHA “complies with Federal, State, and City \nregulations concerning lead.”  But during this entire period, NYCHA was \nsubstantially out of compliance with important lead paint regulations. \n \n•  In 2012 and 2013, NYCHA made false statements to HUD and the public about its \nmaintenance work order backlog.  To fend off concerns by HUD, the media, and \nlocal politicians that NYCHA’s large backlog of maintenance work was \nthreatening living conditions at NYCHA, NYCHA began reporting reductions in \nits backlog, falsely claiming that the reductions resulted from “improved \nefficiency.”  But in fact much of this reduction resulted not from improved \nefficiency but from NYCHA’s manipulation of the work order process so that it no \nlonger reflected the work that NYCHA knew needed to be done. \n   \nWhen these false statements were made, senior NYCHA officials knew the true facts—directly \ncontrary to the false statements. \n10.  These examples illustrate the culture at NYCHA.  NYCHA’s response to external \ninquiries is frequently to cover up or minimize problems that it knows to exist; and executives \nspeaking for the agency (at best) fail to conduct basic diligence before providing HUD and the \npublic false assurances of compliance.  The problems at NYCHA reflect management dysfunction \nand organizational failure, including a culture where spin is often rewarded and accountability \noften does not exist.  As NYCHA’s former Chair and CEO (the “Chair”) put it when confronted \nwith an instance of NYCHA’s maintenance failures, “This is more than there isn’t any \nmoney. . . .”  \n5 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 6 of 80\n11.  To ensure NYCHA’s compliance with these critical regulations, to prevent further \ndeceptive practices and to mitigate the ongoing effects of NYCHA’s past misconduct, the United \nStates brings this action for injunctive relief and appointment of a monitor, pursuant to Section \n6(j)(3) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (“U.S. Housing Act”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 1437d(j)(3), and the \nfederal Anti-Fraud Injunction Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1345, and for equitable relief pursuant to the \nToxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”), 15 U.S.C. § 2616(a)(1). \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n12.  This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1345, 15 U.S.C. § 2616, and 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(j)(3). \n13.  Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1) and (2), because the \ndefendant resides in this district and because a substantial part of the events giving rise to the \nclaims in this action occurred in this district. \nPARTIES \n14.  Plaintiff is the United States of America. \n15.  Defendant NYCHA is a municipal housing agency created under Section 401 of \nNew York State’s Public Housing Law.  NYCHA is run by a chairperson and six other members \nof a board, all appointed by the Mayor of the City of New York.   \nBACKGROUND \nA.  Public Housing \n16.  Since 1937, the United States has provided funding to assist states and localities in \nmaking decent, safe, and sanitary public housing available for low-income families.  See U.S. \nHousing Act, Pub. Law 75-412, § 1.   \n6 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 7 of 80\n17.  Today, approximately 1.2 million families live in public housing managed by \nroughly 2,900 housing agencies nationwide.  HUD will provide approximately $7.3 billion to \nfund public housing across the country during Fiscal Year 2018. \nB.  The New York City Housing Authority \n18.  NYCHA is by far the largest public housing agency in the United States, larger \nthan the next eleven public housing agencies combined.  NYCHA operates 326 developments, \nconsisting of 2,462 residential buildings with approximately 175,000 apartments, located \nthroughout New York City.  NYCHA’s operating budget for public housing is about $2.3 billion, \nroughly $900 million of which are public housing funds provided by HUD.  HUD also provides \nNYCHA more than $300 million per year in capital funding.  \n19.  NYCHA public housing is home to nearly 400,000 low- and moderate-income \nresidents.   \n20.  Approximately 27% of NYCHA’s residents are children.  Nearly 20% of residents \nare age 62 or older, and more than 37,000 NYCHA residents over 62 live alone.  \nC.  Senior NYCHA Operations Management \n21.  NYCHA’s Operations Department (“Operations”) is in charge of building \nmaintenance and repair at NYCHA developments and therefore has a key role in ensuring \nNYCHA’s compliance with lead paint safety regulations and the “decent, safe, and sanitary” \nrequirement. \n22.  The head of Operations from 2010 to early 2014 was an Executive Vice President \nfor Operations, at times called a “Deputy General Manager” (the “EVP for Operations”).  The \nEVP for Operations reported to NYCHA’s then-General Manager.  Between early 2014 and 2018, \nNYCHA did not have an EVP for Operations. \n7 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 8 of 80\n23.  Two principal operations executives reported to the EVP for Operations when that \nposition was filled.  These individuals, originally serving as Vice-Presidents for Operations and \nsubsequently given the titles Senior Vice-President for Operations (“SVP for Operations”) and \nSenior Vice-President for Support Services (“SVP for Support Services”), were effectively in \ncharge of most of the Operations Department from the departure of the EVP for Operations in \n2014 until late 2017.1   \n24.  In recent years, the SVP for Operations was responsible for overseeing the day-to-\nday operations at many of NYCHA’s developments. The SVP for Support Services was \nresponsible for specialized groups such as the lead detection and abatement unit, heating \noperations unit, and elevators unit.  A third senior operations executive, with various titles \nincluding “Senior Vice President for NextGeneration Operations,” joined the senior operations \nstaff in late 2015 and departed voluntarily in mid-2017.  She oversaw certain operations at a \nsubset of developments. \n25.  Operations executives would regularly discuss information on operations matters \namong themselves, with the General Manager and Chair, and with other NYCHA executives.   \n26.  Among other things, every week, the SVP for Operations would meet with other \nsenior NYCHA Operations executives, including the Borough Directors who supervise the \ndevelopments, to discuss operations issues, including such matters as PHAS inspections, mold, \nleaks, and apartment inspections.  The SVP for Support Services would attend these meetings \nwhen agenda items related to his group. \n                                                 \n1 The same individuals held other titles at NYCHA between 2010 and 2017, although always \nretaining significant management responsibility over issues relevant to this Complaint.  For \nexample, the SVP for Operations previously had titles including “Vice President of Operations \nfor Support Services” and “Vice President for Operations.”  The SVP for Support Services \npreviously had titles including “Senior Director of Technical Services.”   \n8 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 9 of 80\n27.  Additionally, the General Manager would meet twice a week with the SVP for \nOperations, the SVP for Support Services and other senior executives to discuss operations issues.  \nUntil 2014, the SVP for Operations and SVP for Support Services would meet every week with \nthe EVP for Operations to discuss similar issues.  \n28.  The NYCHA Chair also would regularly discuss operations issues with the \nGeneral Manager, the SVP for Operations, and the SVP for Support Services.  The Chair \ncommunicated regularly with the General Manager on operations issues, including at a weekly \nmeeting.  The Chair also would routinely discuss operations-related problems directly with the \nSVP for Operations and SVP for Support Services as they arose, including at regularly scheduled \nmeetings with them every other week.  The agendas for meetings with the Chair included issues \nregarding lead-based paint, heating, elevator maintenance, mold remediation, work order \nreporting, and general development management. \n29.  Other than the Chair, the General Manager, the EVP for Operations (when the \nposition was filled), the SVP for Operations and the SVP for Support Services, other senior \nmanagers have played a significant role in monitoring and addressing living conditions, \nmaintenance work orders, and regulatory compliance at HUD’s developments, including the \nDirector of Technical Services (“Director of Technical Services”), who was in charge of many \naspects of NYCHA’s lead paint program and reported to the SVP for Support Services until \nNovember 2017.2   \n                                                 \n2 The same individual held other titles at NYCHA between 2010 and 2017, all relevant to \nNYCHA’s lead paint compliance.   \n9 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 10 of 80\nNYCHA HAS LONG VIOLATED KEY LEAD PAINT SAFETY REGULATIONS  \nAND MADE FALSE STATEMENTS TO COVER UP ITS NONCOMPLIANCE \n30.  Since at least 2010, NYCHA has failed to comply with core lead paint safety \nregulations.  Senior NYCHA officials have known of these violations, yet NYCHA executives \nhave repeatedly, and falsely, reassured HUD and the public of NYCHA’s compliance. \nA.  Lead Poisoning and the Lead Paint Safety Regulations \n31.  Lead is toxic.  \n32.  Lead poisoning in children has particularly devastating consequences.  Studies \nshow that even very low levels of lead exposure can cause irreversible neurological problems, \nincluding learning disabilities, reduced attention spans, and behavioral problems.  No level of lead \nexposure is safe.  Even for adults, ingestion of small amounts of lead can cause or exacerbate \nserious health conditions, including cancer, hypertension, and kidney failure.  \n33.  Lead poisoning is entirely preventable.  The key is stopping children from coming \ninto contact with lead.   \n34.  The most common source of lead exposure is deteriorating lead paint in old \nhousing.3  Children are easily poisoned when they put peeling lead paint flakes in their mouths or \ningest lead paint dust, leading to neurological injuries that cannot be corrected. \n35.  In 1992, Congress enacted the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act \nto, among other things, “reduce the threat of childhood lead poisoning in housing . . . assisted by \nthe Federal Government.”  42 U.S.C. § 4851a(6).  Pursuant to this statute, HUD in turn \npromulgated the “Lead-Safe Housing Rule.”  24 C.F.R. part 35, subparts B-R (Lead-Safe Housing \n                                                 \n3 The terms “lead paint” and “lead paint hazards” as used in this Complaint shall have the same \nmeaning as the terms “lead-based paint” and “lead-based paint hazards,” respectively, as defined \nin section 35.110 of the Lead Safe Housing Rule, 24 C.F.R. § 35.110. \n10 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 11 of 80\nRule).  The Lead-Safe Housing Rule “establish[es] procedures to eliminate as far as practicable \nlead-based paint hazards” in federally funded housing, including public housing such as NYCHA.  \n24 C.F.R. § 35.1100.   \n36.  In 2008, pursuant to the Toxic Substances Control Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2616(a)(1), \nEPA promulgated the Renovation, Repair, and Painting Rule (“RRP Rule”) to reduce the risk of \nlead exposure in the course of certain renovations. 40 C.F.R. part 745, subpart E.  \n37.  EPA has also promulgated regulations regarding “Lead-Based Paint Activities” \nincluding the abatement of lead paint (the “Abatement Rule”).  See 40 C.F.R. part 745, subpart L.   \n38.  Additionally, HUD and EPA also promulgated substantively identical versions of a \n“Lead Disclosure Rule,” which requires landlords like NYCHA to inform most tenants in housing \nbuilt prior to 1978 of known lead paint and lead paint hazards, and to disclose related reports and \ninformation.  24 C.F.R. part 35, subpart A (HUD’s Lead Disclosure Rule); 40 C.F.R. part 745, \nsubpart F (EPA’s Lead Disclosure Rule). \n39.  As applied to public housing, these rules set forth a comprehensive regime \nintended to protect public housing residents from lead poisoning.   \n1.  The Lead-Safe Housing Rule \n40.  Under the Lead-Safe Housing Rule, housing agencies like NYCHA must conduct \nlead paint inspections to determine whether and where lead paint exists in their developments.  24 \nC.F.R. § 35.1115(a).  In certain circumstances, HUD permits housing agencies to use a sampling \nmethod that allows them to inspect a subset of apartments and extrapolate the results to the \nremaining apartments. \n41.  To the extent that lead paint is found in these inspections, the housing agency must \nultimately abate it.  24 C.F.R. § 35.1120(a).  Until such time as abatement occurs, the housing \n11 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 12 of 80\nagency must put in place “interim controls” designed to prevent deterioration of lead paint and \nprotect residents from lead poisoning.  24 C.F.R. § 35.1120. \n42.  The process of ensuring that interim controls are in place includes performance of \na “risk assessment” to identify lead paint hazards.  24 C.F.R. § 35.1115(b).  A lead paint hazard is \n“any condition that causes exposure to lead from dust-lead hazards, soil-lead hazards, or lead-\nbased paint that is deteriorated or present in chewable surfaces, friction surfaces, or impact \nsurfaces, and that would result in adverse human health effects.”  24 C.F.R. § 35.110.  Thus, for \nexample, peeling lead paint is a lead paint hazard because a child could ingest loose flakes of \npaint.  Similarly, lead paint on a portion of a window that is subject to abrasion or friction from \nrepeated opening and closing is a lead paint hazard because it is likely to produce lead dust that a \nchild may ingest.   \n43.  Once lead paint hazards are identified, “interim controls” must be put in place.  \nInterim controls are measures that temporarily reduce the risk of exposure to lead paint, such as \npainting over lead paint or rehanging doors to minimize friction.  24 C.F.R. § 35.1330.  Interim \ncontrols must be put in place by specially trained employees, using safe work practices and taking \nsteps to protect residents.  24 C.F.R. § 35.1330(a)-(e).   \n44.  Because interim controls are inherently temporary and do not eliminate the risk of \nlead exposure, a housing agency must monitor and maintain those controls and respond to any \nbreakdown.  The regulations include four core requirements: \n45.  First, the housing agency must conduct risk assessment reevaluations every two \nyears to identify any new or reappearing lead paint hazards in developments with lead paint, \nunless two consecutive reevaluations separated by at least two years demonstrate the absence of \nsuch hazards.  24 C.F.R. § 35.1355(b)(4).   \n12 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 13 of 80\n46.  Second, the housing agency must also conduct a visual assessment of every \napartment with lead paint every year, as well as at unit turnover, to look for visual evidence of \n“deteriorated paint . . . and the failure of any hazard reduction measures.”  24 C.F.R. \n§ 35.1355(a)(2). \n47.  Third, the housing agency must respond urgently when a child under six living in \nthe building is reported to have a blood lead level that is greater than or equal to the \n“Environmental Intervention Blood Lead Level” or “EIBLL.”  See 24 C.F.R. §§ 35.110, 1130 \n(prior to amendment by 82 Fed. Reg. 4151 (Jan. 13, 2017)).4  In response, the housing agency \nmust not only contain hazards in the child’s apartment, but also perform a new risk assessment of \nthe entire building if the building had previously been determined to be free of lead paint or lead \npaint hazards.  24 C.F.R. § 35.1130(f) (prior to amendment by 82 Fed. Reg. 4151 (Jan. 13, \n2017)).5  The housing agency is also required to notify HUD that a child living at NYCHA has \nbeen found to have an EIBLL.  24 C.F.R. § 35.1130(e)(2). \n48.  Fourth, the housing agency must make sure its workers do not themselves create \nlead paint hazards when working in apartments, by requiring workers to use safe work practices \n                                                 \n4 The relevant regulations have recently been modified to lower the blood lead level that requires \nthe actions described in this paragraph, as well as to change certain terminology and modify the \nactions to be taken.  For most of the period relevant to this complaint, the blood lead level \nrequiring NYCHA’s immediate response was defined as 20 micrograms per deciliter, or 15-19 \nmicrograms per deciliter in two tests taken at least three months apart, and was known as the \n“Environmental Intervention Blood Lead Level.”  24 C.F.R. §§ 35.110, 1130 (prior to \namendment by 82 Fed. Reg. 4151 (Jan. 13, 2017)).  Beginning in July 2017, a standard of 5 \nmicrograms per deciliter has applied.  Under the new standard, the terminology for the urgent \naction level is “Elevated Blood Lead Level.”  82 Fed. Reg. 4151 (Jan. 13, 2017).  For the \npurpose of consistency in this Complaint, the Government will use only the term EIBLL, but in \ndoing so should be understood to refer to the applicable blood lead level requiring such actions at \na given point in time. \n5 Subsequent to the recent amendments, the regulations instead require a new risk assessment for \nall apartments containing or expected to contain children under six years old.  24 C.F.R. \n§ 35.1130(f)(1).   \n13 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 14 of 80\nwhen performing any maintenance or renovation work that may disturb lead paint beyond a two \nsquare foot de minimis level.  24 C.F.R. §§ 35.1345, 35.1350, 35.1355(a)(4).  These lead-safe \nwork practices requirements include warning residents about work to be performed and ensuring \nthat they are not present in the worksite; preparing the worksite to prevent the release of lead dust \nand contain lead paint dust and other debris; and using safe paint removal and worksite cleaning \nmethods.   Id. §§ 35.1345, 35.1350.  Employees performing this work must be specifically trained \nin the use of lead-safe work practices. \n2.  The RRP Rule \n49.  EPA’s RRP Rule is a second regulation requiring that NYCHA employ lead-safe \nwork practices when conducting work that disturbs lead paint.  The RRP Rule governs residential \n“renovations,” defined broadly to mean “modification of any existing structure, or portion thereof, \nthat results in the disturbance of painted surfaces,” provided that (i) the work disturbs more than \nsix square feet per room of interior painted surfaces, more than twenty square feet of exterior \npainted surfaces, or (regardless of size) involves performing window replacements or demolition \nof painted surface areas, 40 C.F.R. § 745.83; (ii) the work is “for compensation,” 40 C.F.R. \n§§ 745.80; and (iii) the building is “target housing,” which generally means housing built prior to \n1978 where the surface in question has not been tested and found lead-based paint free, 15 U.S.C. \n§ 2681(17); 40 C.F.R. § 745.82.  Work by NYCHA employees is “for compensation” in that \nNYCHA charges rent to residents and pays wages to its employees.   \n50.  The substantive requirements of the RRP Rule are similar to the safe work \npractices elements of HUD’s Lead-Safe Housing Rule.  As an entity performing “renovations,” \nNYCHA must, among other things, have (i) have at least one trained “Certified Renovator” \nperforming or directing the work, 40 C.F.R. §§ 745.81(a)(3), 745.89(d)(2), & 745.90(a); (ii) \nensure that other workers are trained in lead-safe work practices, 40 C.F.R. §§ 745.81(a)(3) & \n14 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 15 of 80\n745.89(d)(1); (iii) follow safe work-practice requirements before, during, after the renovation, 40 \nC.F.R. §§ 745.85, 745.89(d)(3); (iv) provide notice to individuals in the vicinity of the work area, \n40 C.F.R. §§ 745.84(a) 745.85(a)(1), 745.89(d)(3), 745.89(d)(4); and (v) document compliance \nwith the safe work practice requirements, 40 C.F.R. §§ 745.86(b)(6), 745.89(d)(5). \n3.  EPA’s Abatement Rule \n51.  The Abatement Rule requires that anyone engaged in the abatement of lead paint is \nappropriately trained by an EPA accredited program and certified in carrying out the specific \nabatement activities.  40 C.F.R. part 745, subpart L.  The Abatement Rule also establishes work \npractice standards for abatement activities.  Id.  EPA’s abatement work practice standards  \nrequire, among other things, that the entity performing lead abatement (i) notify EPA before any \nabatement activities are conducted; (ii) develop an occupant protection describing all measures \nand management procedures to be taken to protect building occupants from exposure to any lead-\nbased paint hazards; and (iii) follow post-abatement clearance procedures, including random \nsampling of other residential units in a multi-family dwelling and the preparation of a final \nabatement report..  See 40 C.F.R. §§ 745.227(e)(1), (5)(i), (8), (9), (10).  The Abatement Rule \nfurther identifies practices and methodologies appropriate for use in the course of abatement, \nwhich provide instructions for notifying and warning residents, containing lead dust and debris, \nand cleaning the site after abatement.  See 40 C.F.R. § 745.227(a)(3) (incorporating, among other \nstandards, those of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Guidelines for the \nEvaluation and Control of Lead-Based Paint Hazards in Housing, Ch. 12, available at \nhttps://www.hud.gov/sites/documents/ch12_abatement_121212.pdf). \n4.  The Lead Disclosure Rule \n52.  The Lead Disclosure Rule requires landlords—including public housing \nagencies—to provide tenants information about the presence of lead paint or lead paint hazards in \n15 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 16 of 80\ntheir apartments when they sign a new (or, in some cases, renewal) lease in most housing built \nprior to 1978.  24 C.F.R. part 35, subpart A; 40 C.F.R. part 745, subpart F.  The information that \nmust be provided includes “any . . . information available concerning the known lead-based paint \nand/or lead-based paint hazards, such as the basis for the determination that lead-based paint \nand/or lead-based paint hazards exist, the location of the lead-based paint and/or lead-based paint \nhazards, and the condition of the painted surfaces.”  24 C.F.R. § 35.88(a)(2); 40 C.F.R. \n§ 745.107(a)(2).  It also requires landlords to provide tenants all records or reports regarding lead \npaint, including building-wide evaluations.  24 C.F.R. § 35.88(a)(4); 40 C.F.R. § 745.107(a).   \nB.  For Years, NYCHA Has Failed to Comply With Key Lead Paint Safety Regulations \n53.  NYCHA has repeatedly violated these key lead paint safety regulations. \n54.  Although NYCHA has said publicly that lead paint was “not widely applied in \nNYCHA” or that “the vast majority of NYCHA developments do not have lead paint,” this is \nsimply untrue.  NYCHA’s own documents show that, in fact, more than half of NYCHA’s \ndevelopments have lead paint somewhere, and at least 92 developments have lead paint in \napartment units.  NYCHA has found lead paint on walls, floors, ceilings, windows, doors, \nradiators, pipes, and other locations within apartments.   \n55.  In the early 2000s, NYCHA conducted lead paint inspections throughout the many \ndevelopments built before lead paint was banned in 1978.  For each such development, NYCHA \nselected a random sample of apartment units to inspect and applied those results to other \napartments in the development.  Based on this sampling method, NYCHA claimed that \napproximately 76,000 apartments in certain developments contained lead-based paint, and that \nothers were lead-based paint free.  NYCHA further claims to have reduced the number of \napartments containing lead paint from 76,000 to approximately 48,000 through inspections and \nabatements.   \n16 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 17 of 80\n56.  However, there is ample reason to question NYCHA’s determinations as to the \nnumber of units with lead paint.  Eight of the 19 children found by NYC DOH inspectors to have \nbeen exposed to lead paint hazards in NYCHA apartments between 2010 and 2016 lived in \ndevelopments NYCHA had deemed to be lead free.  More recently, New York State health \ninspectors have found lead paint in at least three other developments NYCHA has deemed to be \nlead free.  And New York City’s Department of Housing Preservation and Development has \ncalled into question NYCHA’s claim that it confirmed the absence of lead paint in at least 4,000 \nNYCHA apartments.   \n57.  Even accepting NYCHA’s numbers means that lead paint has been determined to \nexist, today, in approximately 51,000 apartments in at least 1,200 buildings in at least 92 NYCHA \ndevelopments.6  Approximately 173,000 residents—including approximately 11,500 children \nunder six years old—live in these developments. \n58.  Peeling paint is pervasive in NYCHA developments.  NYCHA’s data shows that in \n2016 alone, residents logged more than 38,000 complaints related to paint and plaster issues at \ndevelopments containing lead paint.   \n59.  In light of these facts, one would expect a heightened attention to lead paint safety \nat NYCHA.  But, to the contrary, NYCHA broadly fails to follow lead paint safety regulations. \n60.  Risk Assessment Reevaluations:  Since at least 2010, NYCHA has violated HUD’s \nrequirement that it perform periodic risk assessment reevaluations of apartment units and \ncommon areas in developments containing lead paint.  24 C.F.R. § 35.1355(b)(4).  Under this \nrequirement, NYCHA must have licensed or certified risk assessors inspect developments for lead \npaint hazards every two years and propose methods of containing or abating those hazards.  Id.  \n                                                 \n6 The developments are listed in the attached Exhibit A.  \n17 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 18 of 80\nThe two-year cycle continues until a particular development is determined to be lead-based paint \nfree or has two reevaluations in a row showing no lead paint hazards.  As a result of this two-year \ncycle, from 2010 to 2017, NYCHA would be expected to have conducted at least four risk \nassessment reevaluations in each of the at least 92 developments that NYCHA concedes contain \nlead paint in apartments, for a total of at least 368 risk assessment reevaluations.  But NYCHA \nconducted less than 25% of the required reevaluations in those eight years.  At 50 developments \nknown to contain lead paint in apartment units, NYCHA conducted zero risk assessment \nreevaluations from 2010 to 2017.   \n61.  NYCHA’s failure to conduct regular risk assessment reevaluations undermines the \nentire structure of HUD’s lead paint safety regulations:  If a public housing agency does not \nimmediately abate all of its lead paint and chooses instead to use temporary methods to prevent \nexposure, the public housing agency must closely monitor the lead paint to head off exposure \nrisks.  NYCHA, however, ignores the risks and exposes its residents to lead paint. \n62.  Visual Assessments:  Since at least 2010, NYCHA has also violated the regulations \nrequiring it to have trained inspectors conduct annual visual assessments of every apartment unit \nand common area determined to contain lead paint to identify deteriorated paint, unusual amounts \nof dust, and paint-related debris on or around lead paint surfaces, as well as structural problems \nthat may be causing those conditions.   \n63.  As with risk assessment reevaluations, visual assessments are critical to identifying \nand addressing lead paint hazards before a resident or employee is exposed.  And yet NYCHA \ndeliberately disregarded this obligation year after year, putting residents at risk. \n18 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 19 of 80\n64.  Prior to 2012, NYCHA claims that it conducted visual assessments as part of its \nannual inspections of apartments.  However, those inspections did not include proper visual \nassessments for lead paint hazards as required by HUD regulations and related local laws.  \n65.  NYCHA concedes that it stopped performing even these annual inspections in \n2012 and has yet to come into compliance with the visual assessment requirement.   \n66.  It was not until May 2016—half a year after this Office first sought information \nfrom NYCHA about its compliance with HUD’s lead paint safety regulations—that NYCHA \nbegan conducting the visual assessments required by HUD’s regulations.  Even then, NYCHA \nlimited these visual assessments to approximately 4,200 apartment units where children under six \nyears old lived, rather than inspecting all apartments determined to have lead paint, as required by \nHUD’s regulations.  And NYCHA has since acknowledged that even this small number of visual \nassessments were conducted by NYCHA employees who were not trained to perform the \ninspections.   \n67.  Nonetheless, the results of NYCHA’s partial 2016 effort at visual assessments \ndemonstrate its overall failure to properly protect children from lead poisoning:  The 4,000 visual \nassessments in apartments NYCHA has determined to contain lead paint generated approximately \n3,900 work orders for repairs of failing interim controls in approximately 1,500 apartments \ninhabited by children under the age of six.  Approximately 2,200 of these work orders described \nsurfaces that had “peeling, flaking, chalking, alligatored, [and] chipping [paint] or appeared to \nhave been chewed on.”  And roughly 600 of them were for “[d]oors and windows including \nframes molding and jambs” that were “sticking or rubbing together or have markings such as \ndenting or chipping[,] indicating damage by repeated sudden force.”   \n19 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 20 of 80\n68.  In 2017, NYCHA performed visual assessments in almost 9,000 additional \napartments.  More than 80% of these apartments were found to have potential lead paint hazards.  \n69.  Lead-Safe Work Practices:  Since at least 2010, NYCHA has violated HUD’s and \nEPA’s lead-safe work practice requirements, including requirements that NYCHA prevent \nresidents from going into the work area; seal doors, windows, and vents with protective sheeting; \nand thoroughly clean the work area after the work has been completed.  24 C.F.R. §§ 35.1330, \n35.1345(a), & 35.1350; 40 C.F.R. part 745, subpart E.   \n70.  NYCHA fails to comply with these requirements.  Instead, NYCHA sends workers \ninto developments containing lead paint to demolish walls, scrape paint, clean mold, or perform \nother work that will disturb paint without even checking whether those surfaces contain lead.  \nNYCHA does not consider whether those surfaces have lead paint before sending the workers; \nand it does not tell the workers about the surfaces that do have lead paint.  \n71.  Moreover, even if NYCHA gave its workers information about lead paint surfaces, \nthe vast majority of workers could not make use of that information because they are not trained \nto use lead-safe work practices.  24 C.F.R. §§ 35.1330(a)(4) & 35.1350(d) (requiring trained \nworkers or supervisors); 40 C.F.R. § 745.89(d)(1), 745.89(d)(2), 745.90(b)(2) (requiring certified \nrenovators and trained workers).  NYCHA has no system in place to ensure that only trained \nworkers are assigned to jobs requiring lead-safe work practices.  And until August 2017, NYCHA \nhad last trained its workers on lead-safe work practices in 2008.  \n72.  As a result, maintenance work is routinely performed in developments with lead \npaint by NYCHA employees who do not know where the lead paint is.  Beyond that, even if they \nlearned that a particular job involved a lead paint surface, few of them have been trained to handle \nthe work safely.  At the Williamsburg Houses in Brooklyn, for example, where NYCHA’s own \n20 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 21 of 80\ntesting showed that 91 percent of all apartments tested have lead paint, there were 1,800 paint and \nplaster-related jobs in 2016 alone.  Yet only six percent of the workers performing this work were \ntrained in lead-safe work practices.  Similarly, at the Bronx River Houses, where 98 percent of \napartments tested have lead paint, there were nearly 1,900 paint and plaster-related jobs in 2016, \nonly twelve percent of which were performed by trained workers.  Similarly, at Harlem River \nHouses in Manhattan, where NYCHA itself concedes that there was “systematic application” of \nlead paint on walls and other surfaces, there were more than 700 paint and plaster-related jobs in \n2016, only eleven percent of which were performed by trained workers.  \n73.  NYCHA’s records show repeated violations of these regulations.  For example, at \nthe Williamsburg Houses, which were built in the 1930s and where NYCHA believes that it is \n“likely” that apartment ceilings and walls (and other locations) contain lead paint, NYCHA sent a \nworker to paint a peeling kitchen ceiling in December 2016.  This worker was not trained in lead-\nsafe work practices.     \n74.  And in Harlem River Houses, which were also built in the 1930s, NYCHA sends \nemployees untrained in lead safe work practices to perform work on surfaces that NYCHA itself \nhas acknowledged had “systematic application” of lead paint.  For example:  \n•  In January 2016, NYCHA completed a work order that indicated that the entire \nbathroom required “demo[lition]” and painting in a Harlem River \napartment.  NYCHA failed to use trained workers to perform the demolition and \npainting work on surfaces that NYCHA believes had “systematic application” of \nlead paint.   \n \n•  In October 2015, NYCHA performed work in a Harlem River apartment that, \naccording to NYCHA’s work order database, required “demoli[tion]” and \n“paint[ing]” for plumbing repairs.  NYCHA did not use trained workers to \nperform any of the work, even though NYCHA’s own testing shows that the \nwalls demolished and repaired “likely” contained lead paint. \n \n21 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 22 of 80\n•  In April 2015, NYCHA sent workers to a Harlem River apartment to repair a \n“badly damaged” bedroom wall that “likely” contained lead paint.  None of the \nworkers sent to repair the damaged wall were trained to perform the work.   \n \n75.  NYCHA fails to comply with lead-safe work practices under the Lead-Safe \nHousing Rule and the RRP Rule in performing this work.  As a result, on these and numerous \nother occasions, workers will have performed work without providing the necessary warnings to \nresidents, preparing the worksite to protect residents against exposure, or performing safe work \npractices and necessary clearance procedures, and without having the appropriate training or (in \nthe case of work covered by the RRP Rule) assigning a certified renovator to direct the work. \n76.  EIBLL Reporting:  NYCHA also violates the requirement that it “report each \nknown case of a child under [the] age of six with an environmental intervention blood lead level” \nto HUD.  24 C.F.R. § 35.1130(e)(2).  From at least 2010 until 2016, NYCHA failed to provide \nHUD any information regarding children living at NYCHA with EIBLLs, despite the existence of \nnumerous such cases.   \n77.  From 2010 until 2015, NYC DOH informed NYCHA of at least 68 children living \nin NYCHA with elevated blood lead levels.  Because NYC DOH’s age and blood lead level \ncriteria for reporting lead poisonings differ from HUD’s reporting criteria, the fact that NYC \nDOH reported these 68 cases to NYCHA does not automatically mean that NYCHA was \nobligated to report them all to HUD.  But NYCHA could have sought additional information from \nits own files or from NYC DOH to ascertain which of the 68 cases of lead poisoning NYCHA \nwas required to report to HUD.  NYCHA did not take that approach, nor did it attempt to \ndetermine whether it needed to report these poisoned children to HUD.  Rather, NYCHA did not \nreport these cases to HUD until after this Office’s investigation began.   \n22 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 23 of 80\n78.  EIBLL Risk Assessments:  NYCHA has also violated HUD’s (pre-July 2017) \nrequirement to conduct a risk assessment of a development that was previously assumed to be \nlead-based paint free if a child with an EIBLL is found in an apartment in the development with \nlead paint hazards.  24 C.F.R. § 35.1130(f).  The reason for this requirement is obvious:  the lead \npoisoning of a child and identification of lead paint hazards in that child’s apartment demonstrate \nthat the development does, in fact, have lead paint and lead paint hazards.   \n79.  Of the children with EIBLLs between 2010 and 2015, at least four lived in \ndevelopments that NYCHA has determined to be lead-free.7  None of these developments has had \na subsequent risk assessment performed.  Thus, NYCHA has continued to treat these four \ndevelopments as if they are lead paint free and lead paint hazard free, when the evidence shows \nthey are not. \n80.  Lead Abatement:  NYCHA also fails to comply with the Abatement Rule, \nincluding by failing to employ lead safe work practices in the course of abatement work.  On \nmultiple occasions, NYC DOH inspectors have observed “[abatement] work being done \nunsafely,” and uncontained “visible construction dust or debris” at NYCHA.  And on one \noccasion, a NYC DOH inspector noted NYCHA’s failure to follow lead abatement practices, even \nwhen NYCHA workers refused to allow access to the apartment.  In March 2015, a NYC DOH \ninspector visited an apartment undergoing abatement in the Sumner Houses, a development that \ncontains lead paint inside apartments, including on walls.  The inspector noticed ongoing \nconstruction work, but NYCHA workers “wouldn’t allow her in, even after she identified herself \nand showed her badge and [identification].”  Still, the NYC DOH inspector was able to “observe[] \nno safety rules being followed,” including “no warning signs posted” and “no proper . . . \n                                                 \n7 These developments are listed in the attached Exhibit B. \n23 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 24 of 80\nenclosure[s].”  She also observed “stripped paint shavings on the floor which had no plastic \ncovering.”  When NYC DOH followed up with a senior NYCHA manager, the manager \nsuggested that the inspector may have been denied access because the inspector did not have her \nown safety equipment.  But the inspector did not accept that explanation: “I highly doubt myself \nthat it was a safety issue, as the workers made no mention of it.  I just think they (NYCHA) had \nenough time to think about it and come back with a plausible rebuttal.  It’s all a learning \nexperience!!!!!!” \n81.  Disclosure of Lead Information:  Although NYCHA developments do make some \nof the disclosures required by the Lead Disclosure Rule, NYCHA management knows that they \ndo not consistently comply fully with the regulation.  24 C.F.R. part 35, subpart A; 40 C.F.R. part \n745, subpart F.  For example, before one HUD inspection, NYCHA managers discovered an \nentire development without the required documents.   NYCHA management has also found that \nthe developments generally fail to maintain and disclose risk assessment reevaluations reports as \nrequired.   \n82.  Public Health Consequences of NYCHA’s Violations.  NYCHA’s violations have \nserious public health consequences.  At least 19 children had elevated blood lead levels while \nliving in NYCHA apartments found to have lead paint hazards.  But this number understates the \ntrue extent of the harm likely caused by NYCHA’s violations. \n83.  NYC DOH’s data shows that many hundreds of additional children living in \nNYCHA housing have been found to have blood lead levels of 5 micrograms per deciliter or \nmore.  Studies have found that blood lead levels of even 5 micrograms per deciliter in children are \nassociated with brain function deficits, including learning disabilities and behavioral problems.  \nIndeed, 5 micrograms per deciliter is the current reference level at which the Centers for Disease \n24 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 25 of 80\nControl and Prevention recommends public health actions be initiated.  However, NYC DOH \ngenerally has not conducted environmental investigations for blood lead levels below 10 or 15 \nmicrograms per deciliter (depending on the child’s age), nor has it reported such cases to \nNYCHA; as a result, neither NYCHA nor NYC DOH has investigated whether the vast majority \nof children with elevated blood lead levels were exposed to lead paint in their NYCHA \napartments. \n84.  Between 2010 and 2015, NYC DOH identified 202 children living in NYCHA \nwith elevated blood lead levels of 10 micrograms per deciliter or more.  NYC DOH inspected the \nhomes of 121 of these children, and did not inspect the homes of 81 of these children.   \n85.  Of the 121 children with elevated blood lead levels whose homes were inspected, \nNYC DOH found peeling lead paint in the homes of 68 children, and issued corresponding orders \nto NYCHA to abate the lead paint.  But it is NYCHA policy to contest each and every NYC DOH \norder to abate lead paint.  NYCHA’s process for contesting the lead paint finding is to send its \nown employees to retrieve a sample of the paint that NYC DOH identified to be positive for lead, \nand send that sample to a third-party laboratory to test for lead.  As a result of this contestation \nprocess, NYC DOH retracted its findings of lead paint in the NYCHA homes of 50 children, \nleaving 18 confirmed cases.  In 2016, NYC DOH confirmed one more case.      \n86.  Success in the contestation process does not answer the question whether the child \nwas poisoned by lead paint in the home.  For example, one lead poisoned child lives in Red Hook \nHouses in Brooklyn.  In July 2013, the child was found to have a blood lead level of 12 \nmicrograms per deciliter at the age of four.  When NYC DOH inspected the child’s NYCHA \napartment, it found four wall surfaces with disturbed paint that tested positive for lead.  NYC \nDOH also “observed a huge hole on wall #4 of the apt foyer and wall #2 of the kitchen with \n25 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 26 of 80\nsevere chipping paint resulting in gross dust from the paint.”  NYC DOH noted that the “holes in \nthe walls and severe chipping paints [were] the result of a burst pipe in the wall,” which “was \nfixed but not the holes.”  (During the same inspection, NYC DOH observed “an infestation of \nroaches in every room of the apartment.”)  Approximately a week later, NYC DOH issued an \norder requiring NYCHA to abate the lead paint.   \n87.  However, consistent with NYCHA’s policy to contest every NYC DOH order to \nabate lead paint, NYCHA immediately contested NYC DOH’s testing results.  NYCHA \nconducted its own testing, which showed results contradicting NYC DOH’s.  Ultimately, NYC \nDOH agreed to withdraw its order to abate.  But in a follow-up inspection, NYC DOH again \nfound that the child’s apartment contained lead “exceeding allowable limits,” this time as revealed \nby dust wipes.  NYCHA was ordered to “immediately remove such nuisance” by cleaning the \ndust off the surfaces.  One week later, NYCHA complied. \n88.  For yet another reason, these numbers likely understate the number of affected \nchildren at NYCHA.  NYC DOH’s information comes from doctor reported blood lead test \nresults.  And according to NYC DOH’s data, only fifty-one percent of children in New York City \nreceive lead testing at the recommended ages of one and two.  Even those tests would not identify \na child exposed to lead paint for the first time at three years old, when exposure can still cause \nirreversible brain damage.   \n89.  Whether the total is 19 poisoned children or a larger number, it is critical that \nNYCHA comply with applicable lead paint regulations to protect the public health, a fact well \nknown to NYCHA’s management.  As a NYCHA executive explained in an email expressing \nconcern about delay in commencing NYCHA’s visual assessments: \n26 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 27 of 80\n[A]ny delay to make safe an [apartment] that has a child under 6 and we have \nidentified a potential hazard leaves us open to possibly extend an exposure period \nthat we can remediate relatively simply.   \n \n90.  He added, recognizing not just the potential health consequences but also how the \npublic would view the moral gravity of the situation:  \nIf [the press] show up and the resident shows a surface with defective paint, that we \nhave already identified as such, then shows a disclosure stating that the failed \ncoating is presumed to contain lead but we are waiting before we remediate to do \nfurther testing knowing a child resides in the apt, we are toast. \n \nC.  NYCHA Has Repeatedly Made False Statements to Cover Up Its Failure to Follow \nLead Paint Safety Regulations \n91.  NYCHA has repeatedly made false statements to HUD and the public about its \nfailure to comply with federal law mandating lead paint safety.   \n92.  Every year since at least 2010 through 2016, NYCHA has submitted certifications \nto HUD stating that NYCHA will comply with HUD’s lead paint safety regulations.  Moreover, in \nthe same certifications and other filings with HUD, NYCHA asserts its compliance with all \napplicable HUD regulations, including both the lead paint safety regulations and the “decent, safe, \nand sanitary” regulation that incorporates the lead paint requirements.  In addition, every year, \nNYCHA submits a statement to New York City for inclusion in New York City’s Consolidated \nPlan to HUD, falsely stating that “NYCHA complies with Federal, State, and City regulations \nconcerning lead and executes HUD directives regarding lead-based paint (LBP).”  It has made \nsimilar statements in response to outreach from HUD. \n93.  But NYCHA has been in violation of the regulations all along, and NYCHA \nmanagers knew it. \n27 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 28 of 80\n1.  NYCHA’s Senior Operations Managers Were Aware That NYCHA Violates \nHUD’s Lead Paint Safety Regulations \n94.  High-level NYCHA officials were aware that NYCHA was not in compliance with \nHUD’s lead paint safety regulations.   \n95.  Risk Assessment Reevaluations.  NYCHA senior Operations managers have known \nfor many years that NYCHA is in violation of the risk assessment reevaluation requirement:  In \n2011, an email between two senior Operations managers explained that although risk assessment \nreevaluations are “supposed to take about 2 years between cycles, with staffing and contractor \nissues that has historically not been possible.”  At that time, one of these individuals relayed the \ninformation to a more senior NYCHA executive.  Approximately, one year later two NYCHA \nsenior Operations officials again discussed NYCHA’s failure to conduct required risk assessment \nreevaluations.  In 2016, a NYCHA executive raised the issue again with another senior executive, \ntelling him that NYCHA was not conducting risk assessment reevaluations as required, and \nrequesting funding to conduct additional reevaluations.  But the funding request was denied, \nallowing matters to get worse.   \n96.  Visual Assessments.  NYCHA senior Operations managers have also been aware \nthat NYCHA was failing to conduct visual assessments for lead paint, which in many cases are \nrequired under both HUD regulations and City law.  A NYCHA executive has acknowledged that \nhe was aware as early as 2013 that NYCHA was failing to conduct required visual assessments, \nand that he raised the problem with the senior executive to whom he then reported.  Separately, \ninternal NYCHA emails from 2015 show that NYCHA considered—but rejected—conducting \nvisual assessments in a pilot inspection program.  In July 2015, an email was sent to NYCHA \nOperations executives and senior managers by a NYCHA manager with the subject line \n“Apartment Inspections – Need to incorporate Lead.”  The email “remind[ed] everyone” that \n28 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 29 of 80\n“while we agreed” that “we would not concern ourselves” with lead inspections required by City \nlaw in connection with rolling out a pilot program of Operations Department inspections at that \ntime, “we said . . . when we build out the [inspections] program, we would incorporate this need.”   \n97.  Approximately nine months later, the NYCHA Chair learned that NYCHA had \nfailed to perform the visual assessments required under local law, and thereafter learned that \nNYCHA’s failure violated federal law.   \n98.  NYCHA did not begin conducting visual assessments in apartments determined to \ncontain lead paint until May 2016, and still has failed to conduct even one visual assessment at \ntens of thousands of covered apartments. \n99.  Lead-Safe Work Practices.  NYCHA managers were also aware that NYCHA was \nin violation of HUD’s lead-safe work practices requirement.  Senior NYCHA officials knew that \nNYCHA never had—and still does not have—a system to notify maintenance workers when their \nwork would impact lead paint surfaces, triggering the need for lead-safe work practices.  In 2015, \nfor example, at least two NYCHA officials considered sending lead paint information to those \ndevelopments with widespread lead paint, but did not do so.  Additionally, on at least two \nseparate occasions, senior NYCHA personnel discussed the possibility of integrating information \nabout the location of lead paint into NYCHA’s maintenance work order systems, but this was not \ndone.   \n100.  Beyond that, NYCHA management knew that even if it notified workers about the \npresence of lead paint, few workers had been trained on lead-safe work practices.  Before this \nOffice’s investigation began, the last time NYCHA had trained a significant number of workers to \nfollow lead-safe work practices was in 2008.  At least two senior Operations officials knew that \nthis shortfall of trained workers grew more extreme with the passage of time.  Indeed, in a May \n29 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 30 of 80\n2016 email, one senior NYCHA manager overseeing properties in Brooklyn advised a NYCHA \nsenior Operations executive that “there [were] only 33 paint[ers]/paint supervisors trained in lead \nsafe practices” working in Brooklyn developments—developments in which NYCHA had \ndetermined that at least 12,000 apartments could contain lead paint.     \n101.  Children with Environmental Intervention Blood-Lead Levels.  Senior NYCHA \nmanagers also knew that NYCHA was required to report children with environmental \nintervention blood lead levels to HUD and that it was not doing so.  Between 2010 and 2013, \nNYCHA received at least 54 violation notices from NYC DOH informing NYCHA that children \nliving in NYCHA apartments with deteriorated lead paint tested positive for high concentrations \nof lead.  Though there are technical differences between NYC DOH’s and HUD’s thresholds for \nreportable lead levels, NYCHA took no steps to determine which of these children met HUD’s \nreporting thresholds.  NYCHA failed to report any to HUD.  Further, when HUD asked NYCHA \nin 2013 to provide the number of children with environmental intervention blood lead levels \nliving in NYCHA housing, NYCHA failed to provide any information.  In fact, NYCHA did not \nsend HUD any information about children with elevated blood lead levels until after this Office’s \ninvestigation began.  In addition, a NYCHA senior Operations manager admitted in a 2017 \ninterview that he knew that, under the regulations, NYCHA was required to conduct a new risk \nassessment reevaluation in developments thought to be lead-free if a child with an environmental \nintervention blood lead level was exposed to a lead paint hazard in that development.  NYCHA \nshould have conducted risk assessment reevaluations in at least three NYCHA developments \nwhere children with environmental intervention blood lead levels lived.  To date, it has failed to \ndo so. \n30 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 31 of 80\n102.  Disclosure of Lead.  Senior NYCHA managers also knew that NYCHA was \ndeficient in complying with the Lead Disclosure Rule.  When HUD asked to visit a development \nto check its “lead disclosure documents” in 2010, NYCHA Operations staff decided they should \n“pick a small development . . . managed well.”  They picked the Straus Houses, and a senior \nOperations manager asked that someone “reach out to [the development’s] Manager and have a \nstaff member go over the documents they should have on hand and in the residents folders,” \nemphasizing that “everything as far as lead must be on point.”  But it was not.  Another senior \nOperations manager reported that “none of the resident folders had [lead paint] acknowledgement \nforms or any other [lead paint] info within.”  Similarly, in 2013, in preparation for another HUD \ninspection, a NYCHA manager requested that NYCHA’s Lead Paint Program Unit provide the \ndevelopments with copies of the latest risk assessment reevaluation report, even though the \ndevelopments should have had such documents on site and made them available for review in \nconnection with disclosures.  As a senior Operations manager explained, “[u]nfortunately, nobody \never keeps [the risk assessment reevaluation reports] like [they are] supposed to.” \n2.  NYCHA Repeatedly Made False Statements About Lead Paint \n103.  With full knowledge of NYCHA’s violations of HUD’s lead paint safety \nregulations, NYCHA has repeatedly made false statements to HUD and the public. \n104.  Every year, since at least 2010 and through 2016, NYCHA has submitted \ncertifications to HUD falsely representing that NYCHA “will comply with [federal lead paint \nsafety regulations].” \n105.  In 2015 and 2016, NYCHA found itself under intense scrutiny, after public reports \nof a young girl living in NYCHA housing with dangerously high levels of lead in her blood \nstream, the crisis in Flint, Michigan, regarding the presence of lead in the water, and this Office’s \n31 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 32 of 80\ninvestigation of lead paint issues at NYCHA.  Instead of putting systems in place to protect \nresidents from lead exposure, NYCHA opted to falsely reassure HUD and the public. \n106.  For example, on April 17, 2015, in response to news articles about a lead-poisoned \ntoddler living in NYCHA housing, NYCHA managers drafted a letter on behalf of NYCHA’s \nChair to elected officials in New York City, falsely stating that “NYCHA pays close attention to \nlead paint risks” and that NYCHA “complies with Federal, State, and City regulations concerning \nlead.”  This same letter was sent to resident leaders in NYCHA developments.  At that time, at \nleast two of the senior Operations managers involved in drafting the letter to elected officials and \nresidents knew that NYCHA had long failed to conduct mandatory visual assessments of \napartments presumed to contain lead paint.  \n107.  The following month, NYCHA and NYC DOH held meetings with residents and \nNYCHA employees.  The NYCHA presentation, drafted by high-level NYCHA officials, told \nresidents and NYCHA employees that the “vast majority of NYCHA developments” do not have \nlead paint and that NYCHA takes “extra safeguards” in the developments that do.  At that time, at \nleast two senior NYCHA managers involved in drafting the presentation knew that more than half \nof NYCHA developments had been confirmed to have at least some lead paint on the premises, \nand roughly thirty percent of those NYCHA developments had been confirmed to have lead paint \nin apartments.  The senior NYCHA managers also knew that NYCHA had failed to perform \nannual visual assessments and risk assessment reevaluations for years. \n108.  On August 31, 2015, NYCHA submitted to HUD, via New York City’s 2014 \nConsolidated Plan, a statement drafted by senior NYCHA officials that “NYCHA complies with \nFederal, State, and City regulations concerning lead and executes HUD directives regarding lead-\nbased paint (LBP).”  At that time, the senior NYCHA officials who drafted NYCHA’s statement \n32 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 33 of 80\nof compliance knew not only about the lack of visual assessments and risk assessment \nreevaluations, but also that NYCHA was assigning untrained maintenance workers to disturb lead \npaint surfaces without telling them that there was lead paint or that they were required to use lead-\nsafe work practices.   \n109.  On October 12, 2015, NYCHA submitted to HUD its certification falsely \nrepresenting that NYCHA “will comply with [federal lead paint regulations]” and currently is in \ncompliance with applicable regulations.  At that time, senior NYCHA officials knew not only \nabout the noncompliance with respect to visual assessments and risk assessment reevaluations and \nlead-safe work practice requirements, but also that NYCHA often failed to provide residents with \nrequired disclosures regarding the existence of lead in their developments. \n110.  In a February 2016 email, NYCHA management responded to lead-related \nquestions posed by HUD, again falsely assuring HUD that NYCHA “complies with Federal, \nState, and City regulations concerning lead paint hazards and executes HUD directives regarding \nlead-based paint.” \n111.  On March 28, 2016, after this Office’s investigation of lead paint issues at \nNYCHA became public, the NYCHA Chair testified before the New York City Council that \nNYCHA regularly conducted inspections of apartments with lead paint as required by New York \nCity law.  At the time of these statements, at least two NYCHA executives knew that, for many \nyears, NYCHA had failed to conduct visual assessments (as required by HUD or by local law) or \nrisk assessment reevaluations as required by HUD’s regulations.  \n112.  On June 12, 2016, NYCHA and NYC DOH issued a joint press release titled \n“Lead-Based Paint and New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA): Facts.”  This press release \nfalsely stated that NYCHA has done “rigorous work” to “remediate any lead-based paint \n33 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 34 of 80\nwhenever [NYCHA] find[s] it.”  It further stated that NYCHA “performs annual inspections of \nunits for lead-based paint,” without disclosing that those inspections had just started the month \nbefore.  In addition to these false and misleading statements, NYC DOH added its own “fact”: \n“Prevention and abatement efforts at NYCHA properties are an unqualified success.”  At that \ntime, senior NYCHA officials knew that NYCHA had failed to conduct mandatory visual \nassessments under federal and local law.  In addition, senior NYCHA officials knew that \nNYCHA’s prevention efforts were far from “success[ful].”   \n113.  In September 2016, NYCHA made a presentation to senior HUD management \naddressing lead paint at NYCHA.  During that presentation, NYCHA finally admitted that it had \nfailed to conduct annual visual assessments of NYCHA apartments with lead paint.  However, \nNYCHA failed to disclose its other violations of HUD’s lead paint safety regulations.  Instead, \nNYCHA continued minimizing the problems, falsely telling HUD that “[o]nly two developments \n(less than .0001% of sample) have lead-based paint on the walls,” when NYCHA’s own data \nreveals that more than 25 developments have tested positive for lead paint on walls.   \n114.  On October 12, 2016, NYCHA again falsely certified to HUD that NYCHA “will \ncomply with [federal lead paint safety regulations].” \n115.  And on December 16, 2016, NYCHA again submitted a statement to HUD in a \nNew York City Consolidated Plan that falsely stated that “NYCHA complies with Federal, State, \nand City regulations concerning lead and executes HUD directives regarding lead-based paint \n(LBP).”  \n116.  All of these statements by NYCHA were false:  Lead paint exists at hundreds of \nNYCHA developments; NYCHA does not have the procedures in place to monitor lead paint \nhazards; NYCHA has failed to disclose important information to HUD, its residents, and the \n34 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 35 of 80\npublic about lead paint hazards at the developments; and NYCHA was violating core provisions \nof federal lead paint regulations even as it was making the false statements.   \n117.  NYCHA’s repeated false statements about its lead compliance allowed NYCHA to \navoid HUD scrutiny and remain noncompliant for years. \nNYCHA COVERS UP ITS FAILURE TO PROVIDE THE  \nDECENT, SAFE, AND SANITARY HOUSING REQUIRED BY LAW \n118.  NYCHA’s failure to comply with lead paint safety regulations is just one element \nof the environmental health crisis at NYCHA.  More broadly, NYCHA fails to provide “decent, \nsafe, and sanitary” housing because of systemic lead-paint violations, pervasive mold, widespread \nlack of heat in winter, infestations of rats, mice, and roaches, and chronic elevator outages in \nhigh-rise buildings.  And NYCHA has concealed these conditions from HUD, by undermining \nHUD inspections and thereby rendering the inspection results unreliable. \nA.  Decent, Safe, and Sanitary Regulations \n119.  Public housing’s central purpose is to provide decent, safe, and sanitary housing to \nlower-income families.  Therefore, Congress directed HUD, in the U.S. Housing Act, as \namended, to promulgate “housing quality standards . . . that ensure that public housing dwelling \nunits are safe and habitable.”  42 U.S.C. § 1437d(f)(2).  HUD in turn imposed a core regulatory \nrequirement that all public housing “be decent, safe, sanitary, and in good repair.”  24 C.F.R. \n§ 5.703 (the “decent, safe, and sanitary” regulations); see also 24 C.F.R. Part 902.  This \nrequirement is also reflected in the Annual Contributions Contract that governs certain HUD \npayments to NYCHA. \n120.  HUD regulations not only set an overarching mandate for “decent, safe, and \nsanitary” housing, but also impose specific requirements designed to protect the public health.  \nAmong other things, housing agencies must: \n35 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 36 of 80\n•  Comply with HUD’s lead paint safety regulations.  24 C.F.R. § 5.703(f).  \n \n•  Ensure that “dwelling units and common areas . . . have proper ventilation and be free \nof mold.”  24 C.F.R. § 5.703(f). \n \n•  Prevent “infestation by rats, mice, or other vermin.”  24 C.F.R. § 5.703(f).   \n \n•  Maintain heating and elevator systems that are “functionally adequate, operable, and \nin good repair.”  24 C.F.R. § 5.703(c). \n \n121.  HUD conducts annual Public Housing Assessment System (“PHAS”) inspections \nto assess physical conditions (and certain other matters) at housing agencies.  See generally 24 \nC.F.R. Part 902.  At large housing agencies, HUD inspects a randomly generated subset of \napartments at each development, plus building common areas, and scores the housing agency \nbased on its findings.  Excessive deficiencies can lead to adverse consequences ranging from \nmore frequent inspections to the appointment of a receiver to take over the housing agency.  24 \nC.F.R. §§ 902.13, 902.73, 902.75, 902.83.   \nB.  NYCHA Deceives HUD’s Inspection Program \n122.  NYCHA is keenly aware that HUD is the principal agency funding NYCHA and \nmay impose limitations on HUD funding if NYCHA fails to comply with applicable regulations.  \nMoreover, HUD has the authority to appoint a receiver to replace NYCHA management.  \nNYCHA’s 2015 “NextGeneration” plan—a reform plan that nonetheless has failed to address \ncore deficiencies in operations and environmental health—expressly acknowledges the potential \nfor a federal receivership.    \n123.  In order to ward off consequences for failing to maintain proper living conditions, \nNYCHA management has repeatedly misled both HUD and the public regarding the true living \nconditions at NYCHA.   \n36 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 37 of 80\n124.  A key way that NYCHA has deflected HUD scrutiny of its living conditions, since \nbefore 2010, has been to hide conditions from HUD inspectors. \n1.  HUD’s Public Housing Inspections \n125.  Every year, HUD assesses living conditions at NYCHA through PHAS \ninspections.  HUD uses PHAS inspections as an important means to evaluate NYCHA’s \nperformance.  See generally 24 C.F.R. Part 902.   \n126.  PHAS inspections evaluate four components: NYCHA’s physical conditions, \nfinancial condition, management, and capital funding.  The result of a PHAS inspection is a \n“PHAS score” of up to 100 points.  24 C.F.R. § 902.9.   \n127.  A housing agency’s overall “PHAS score” is based on its separate scores for the \nfour components of the PHAS inspection.  A housing agency’s overall PHAS score, taken in \ncombination with the housing agency’s scores on the four separate components of the PHAS \ninspection, determines whether the housing agency will be designated as a “high performer,” a \n“standard performer,” a “substandard performer,” or a “troubled performer.”  24 C.F.R. §§ 902.9, \n902.11.   \n128.  HUD gives the most weight to the physical conditions component of PHAS \ninspections.  24 C.F.R. § 902.9.  “The objective of the physical condition [assessment] is to \ndetermine whether a [public housing agency] is meeting the standard of decent, safe, sanitary \nhousing in good repair.”  24 C.F.R. § 902.20(a).  To achieve this, HUD inspects common areas \nand a sample of apartments at each NYCHA development or group of developments, generally \nevery year.  24 C.F.R. § 902.22. \n129.  A passing score on the physical conditions component is 60 percent, although \nhigher scores can result in additional, positive consequences for NYCHA.  24 C.F.R. §§ 902.11, \n37 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 38 of 80\n902.25.  For example, low scores can result in HUD-imposed corrective action plans, whereas \nhigh scores can lead to relief from certain reporting requirements.  24 C.F.R. § 902.11.   \n130.  Each development has its own incentive to score as many points as possible.  If a \nproperty receives a physical condition score of less than 80 points, HUD will inspect the property \nagain the following year.  But if a property scores between 80 and 90 points, HUD will inspect \nthe property every two years.  And if a property scores 90 points or more, the property will skip \ntwo years of HUD inspections in a row.  24 C.F.R. § 902.13.   \n131.  NYCHA staff know that if they can find ways to earn extra PHAS points, then \nthey can ward off further HUD scrutiny.  In one case, after a development passed its PHAS \ninspection, a Deputy Director emailed staff to congratulate them on a passing score.  Nonetheless, \nhe instructed that they should look for any and all ways that the development might appeal to \nHUD to get back any points that were deducted during the inspection.  He added with emphasis: \n“[W]e only need two points back to get a year off [from inspection].”  Any extra points are also \nimportant to NYCHA as a whole, even if those points do not make the difference for the \nindividual development, because each property’s score will affect NYCHA’s score overall, and \nmay therefore affect whether NYCHA is classified as a high, standard, substandard, or troubled \nperformer.  24 C.F.R. § 902.25.  \n132.  But HUD can only rely on the physical condition assessment process if housing \nagencies participate in good faith.  Thus, although NYCHA has been scored a “standard” \nperformer since 2010, its score is not reliable because NYCHA has systematically deceived \nHUD’s inspectors by concealing the true condition of NYCHA housing during those years. \n2.  NYCHA’s Pre-PHAS “Magic” \n133.  Just before a PHAS inspection, NYCHA management and staff focus on \nmaximizing PHAS scores.  Management circulates dossiers on individual inspectors to enable \n38 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 39 of 80\nstaff to target the conditions for which each inspector is known to deduct points.  NYCHA diverts \n“quality assurance” staff—typically responsible for verifying work after it is performed by \nNYCHA maintenance workers—to scout for problems to be corrected at the to-be-inspected \ndevelopments.  And it shifts staff and resources from developments not scheduled for inspection \nto perform emergency efforts to make the inspected developments “PHAS ready.”   \n134.  In its PHAS preparation, NYCHA goes to great lengths to mask problems that \notherwise exist year-round.  The contrast is not lost on NYCHA residents.  In December 2015, \none NYCHA residents association complained to NYCHA after being told that it would take four \nmonths to repair a broken door that the residents believed to be a fire hazard: \nLet’s treat it like Phas and get a magic carpenter up there to change the door \nlike we’ve been seeing since last week to fake for the inspector.  These actions \nshow that management doesn’t care about their residents unless it is an \ninspection, a special visit from downtown or a tragedy. \n \n135.  Or, as a resident in Pomonok Houses put it in 2015, in an email forwarded to \nNYCHA’s senior management: “PHAS came and . . . just like children Pomonok hid[] all the \ntrash under the bed.” \n3.  NYCHA Hides Housing Conditions from Inspectors \n136.  NYCHA’s PHAS preparations include hiding conditions from inspectors.   \n137.  Some of the starkest misconduct occurs around leaks, a major PHAS point \ndeduction as well as a cause of mold, pests, and other conditions. \n138.  For example, former NYCHA Directors in Brooklyn and the Bronx have \nconfirmed that development staff would shut off a building’s water supply just before the PHAS \ninspector arrived to inspect common areas in order to temporarily stop ongoing leaks that would \notherwise be visible.  Once the PHAS inspector left the building, the water supply would be \nrestored.  Deputy Directors at NYCHA knew of this practice. \n39 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 40 of 80\n139.  NYCHA uses other techniques to hide leaks as well.  When a standpipe began \nleaking two days before a 2013 PHAS inspection at the Frederick Douglass Houses, a NYCHA \nsenior manager, copying a NYCHA administrator, pressed others at NYCHA on whether there \nwas a “clamp or something we can put on this to cover up the leak.”  Because the shape of the \npipe would not permit a clamp, the NYCHA administrator suggested attaching a piece of \ninsulation on the morning of the inspection to absorb the leaking water.  They ultimately decided \nto cover the pipe with material from an oil spill kit for the inspection.     \n140.  According to one former maintenance worker, the management at NYCHA \ndevelopments would instruct workers to put tape over holes in pipes before the PHAS inspections, \nto prevent HUD from seeing the holes.   \n141.  During a 2013 PHAS inspection at a development in Brooklyn, a boiler room leak \nled to a 10-point deduction and a failing score.  A NYCHA manager in Brooklyn explained that \nthe point deduction was just “[b]ad timing,” because there was not much his staff “could have \ndone to stop or hide it.”  A senior Operations manager then forwarded this email to an Operations \nexecutive explaining: “FYI - Big hit that literally happened as the inspector was walking in.  Must \nhave cleaned what was holding it together off.”   \n142.  What is true of leaks is also true of ventilation:   NYCHA has made efforts to hide \nits ventilation problems from HUD inspectors, leading to better PHAS scores and depriving HUD \nof important knowledge relevant to mold and other living conditions. \n143.  In 2014, when HUD was scheduled to inspect the Bronxchester development, \nmanagers focused on the fact that two roof fans were out of order.  To cover this up for the \ninspection, a senior manager proposed—in an email copied to a senior executive—that NYCHA \n“swap out 2 fans from [another development] for this Inspection.”   \n40 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 41 of 80\n144.  A former NYCHA Deputy Director explained a trick he personally used to make a \nbroken-down roof fan appear to be functioning for a PHAS inspection:  He put a refrigerator \nmotor inside the inoperative roof fan.  In this way, he fooled the PHAS inspector into thinking \nthat the roof fan had a functioning motor.   \n145.  Beyond leaks and ventilation, NYCHA often covers up holes in walls and ceilings, \nwhich (in addition to being point deductions) are hiding places for cockroaches and other pests in \napartments.  According to a former manager, it was a common practice to stuff holes in the walls \nwith newspaper and cork and then paint over the holes, to conceal them from PHAS inspectors.  \nA former NYCHA manager from Manhattan directed maintenance workers, in advance of PHAS \ninspections, to use a foam spray to disguise holes in the wall that needed plastering. \n146.  NYCHA property managers often direct maintenance workers to literally cover up \nbroken doors in common areas for PHAS inspections, according to one former property manager.  \nThat is, instead of fixing the door, the maintenance workers will remove it, cover the area with \nplywood, and paint over it, so that the inspector will not know that there is a broken door at all. \n147.  In the same vein, a former NYCHA caretaker has explained how her \nsuperintendent would instruct staff before PHAS inspections to lock the doors of basement rooms \nwith dangerous or unsanitary conditions and post a sign reading “Danger: Do Not Enter,” to keep \nthe inspectors out.  After the inspections were completed, the signs would be removed and staff \nwould continue to use those rooms in carrying out their daily responsibilities.  Another former \nmaintenance worker reported that NYCHA staff would build false walls out of a single layer of \nplywood to conceal dilapidated rooms from PHAS inspectors. \n148.  Certain NYCHA staff openly discussed hiding conditions from PHAS inspectors.  \nIn 2013, a NYCHA superintendent emailed a group of NYCHA staff to say, “We’re hiding four \n41 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 42 of 80\nbig pails of oil behind your containers for our PHAS inspection today. We’ll get them after it’s \nover.”  The superintendent then forwarded his email to a NYCHA senior manager, to request \nassistance in eventually disposing of the oil.  \n4.  NYCHA Trains Its Staff to Undermine the PHAS Program \n149.  The intentional nature of NYCHA’s misconduct with respect to the PHAS \ninspection program is illustrated by the fact that NYCHA actually trained its staff on how to \ndeceive HUD inspectors.  NYCHA’s internal guidelines on PHAS inspections expressly \nencourage staff to use subterfuge of this kind.  For a decade, NYCHA provided its staff with a list \nof “Quick Fix Tips” that served as a how-to manual for misleading inspectors. \n150.  Many of NYCHA’s “Quick Fix Tips” revolve around using paint and plywood (or \na 2x4 or cardboard) to cover over the problematic condition during the inspection.  Thus, the \nQuick Fix Tips include the following (all emphases added): \n•  Ceiling Tiles: Tiles, including those in community facilities, that are \ndamaged or stained need to be replaced or painted.  Painted cardboard \ncan be used instead. \n \n•  Drain Covers: Ensure all drains and cleanout covers are in place. \nPlywood cut and painted can be a good substitute.  Drill holes for \ndrainage. \n \n•  Fencing: Missing fence sections are not deficiencies if there are no means \nto attach additional sections.  Remove brackets and any sign of \nattachment. A piece of 2x4 can be attached to the end and painted black if \nnecessary. \n \n•  Mailboxes: If any doors are missing, replace.  If parts are an issue, \ntemporarily cover them up for the day. \n.  \n•  Improperly Stored Flammables: Flammable aerosol cans should be \nplaced out of sight.  On the day of inspection, remove all gasoline \npowered equipment to an outside area. \n \n42 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 43 of 80\n151.  These “Quick Fix” materials were standard NYCHA guidance to staff for over a \ndecade.  These techniques were included in annual trainings instructing NYCHA staff how to \nprepare for PHAS inspections.  Borough-level management circulated a link to these tips widely \nto development leadership in “Round Robin” emails.  Senior Operations managers were often \ncopied on emails circulating information on the Quick Fix Tips.  Just before this investigation \nbegan, in 2015, a NYCHA borough director emailed the Quick Fix Tips to a senior Opreations \nexecutive and notified him that these tips would be sent to developments to “remind staff on how \nto correct/abate deficiencies.” \n152.  Indeed, NYCHA’s “Quick Fix Tips” were long maintained on NYCHA’s intranet \nas reference material for staff.  It was only removed in 2017, after this Office questioned senior \nNYCHA executives about the document in front of NYCHA’s attorneys. \n5.  NYCHA Front-Runs Inspectors \n153.  In addition to concealing defects from HUD, NYCHA undermines the integrity of \nPHAS inspections by improperly sending personnel ahead of inspectors to repair deficiencies \nduring inspections. \n154.  For example, NYCHA sends teams of elevator mechanics to stay one step ahead of \nPHAS inspectors.  In a September 2013 email, an elevator supervisor confirmed to NYCHA’s \nelevator chief that a “team [of elevator mechanics] ha[d] been instructed to stay one building \nahead of the PHAS inspector, during the inspections.”  The next year, a senior manager emailed a \ndozen NYCHA employees, including a senior Operations executive, that “the site team [of \nelevator mechanics] or assigned staff will lead the PHAS inspection team by 2 buildings to ensure \nno[-]service conditions are abated,” to ensure no points were lost for elevators.  He went further, \nadvising that “Mandated DOB [Department of Building] inspections will be rescheduled as not to \nimpact scoring.”  In 2015, two NYCHA managers, copying two other NYCHA executives, \n43 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 44 of 80\nreiterated that a “team of elevator mechanics should be on site for any unforeseen elevator \noutages” during PHAS inspections. \n155.  Maintenance staff take the same approach.  One maintenance worker employed by \nNYCHA through 2016 explained that a maintenance worker would be given a single electric \npanel cover and tasked with running ahead of the inspector to fit that single cover on each \nuncovered electrical box before the inspector arrived.   \n156.  More broadly, NYCHA creates a culture in which staff feel compelled to obtain \nhigh PHAS scores, no matter the cost.  A senior NYCHA executive would monitor each \ndevelopment’s PHAS scores and how scores change over time.  Managers and staff know that \nthey are expected to address or cover up problems before the PHAS inspector arrives.  As one \nBorough Director instructed her borough’s property managers and supervisors, in an email \nattaching the Quick Fix Tips:  “[Y]ou must take ownership in this process and understand that \nyou are the development supervisors and are responsible for the outcome of these inspections.” \nC.  NYCHA Fails to Provide Decent, Safe, and Sanitary Housing \n157.  By subverting the PHAS inspection process, NYCHA has concealed from HUD its \nfailure to meet the decent, safe, and sanitary requirement of 24 C.F.R. § 5.703 and other related \nrequirements.  E.g., Annual Contribution Contract § 5 (requiring NYCHA to develop and \noperating housing “in compliance with . . . all applicable . . . regulations”).   \n158.  At NYCHA, lead paint safety rules are often violated.  Leaks are common and \npeeling paint frequently goes unaddressed.  NYCHA’s own maintenance procedures often are not \nfollowed.  Many categories of repairs that should be quickly addressed instead take weeks or \nmonths. \n159.  Serious public health problems abound, above and beyond those relating to lead \npaint:  Recurring mold growth infects thousands of apartments because of leaks and poor \n44 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 45 of 80\nventilation, a particular health risk for residents with asthma.  NYCHA often fails to provide \nsufficient heat in winter, leading to frigid indoor temperatures that threaten residents’ health.  Pest \ninfestations are common, fostered by NYCHA’s failure to fix leaks and provide basic sanitation, \nagain affecting tenants with asthma.  Elevators frequently fail to work, stranding elderly and \ndisabled tenants. \n160.  NYCHA’s failures have lead residents to unsafe self-help:  Residents scrape large \nmold patches from their bathroom ceilings; use potentially dangerous pesticides; and heat \napartments with ovens or stoves.  They climb unlit, hazardous stairwells when the elevators do \nnot work. \n161.  And NYCHA’s problems with lead, mold, heat, elevators, and pests are not the \nwhole story.  In recent years, the New York City Department of Investigation has found that \nNYCHA fails to properly conduct key safety checks of items like smoke and carbon monoxide \ndetectors in its apartments, and the New York City Comptroller has found that the majority of \nNYCHA’s playgrounds have “substandard and visibly hazardous conditions.”  A March 2018 \nreport by the New York State Department of Health found that 83% of inspected NYCHA units \ncontained a condition that could pose a health hazard to tenants.  All told, NYCHA does not \nprovide its residents with housing that is decent, safe, and sanitary.   \n1.  NYCHA Fails to Comply with Lead Paint Requirements \n162.  As described above, NYCHA has systematically failed to comply with HUD’s lead \npaint safety rules, notwithstanding the “decent, safe, and sanitary” regulation requiring that \n“housing must comply with all requirements related to the evaluation and reduction of lead-based \npaint hazards.”  24 C.F.R. § 5.703(f). \n45 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 46 of 80\n2.  NYCHA Has Widespread, Recurring Mold \n163.  Mold often grows unchecked at NYCHA, notwithstanding HUD’s requirement \nthat public housing “be free of mold.”  24 C.F.R. § 5.703(f). \n164.  Mold at NYCHA is widespread.  From 2013 to 2016, NYCHA residents made \nbetween 18,000 and 28,000 complaints about mold growth every year, and that number has been \ngenerally increasing. Nearly 28,000 mold complaints were made in 2016 alone. And the mold \ngrowth in NYCHA units is substantial, according to NYCHA’s own data.  Of the mold \ncomplaints between 2014 and 2016 for which size data is available, 60% involve mold growth \ncovering 10 or more square feet, as confirmed by NYCHA’s maintenance staff.  Nearly 300 mold \ncomplaints have involved mold growth covering more than 100 square feet, again, according to \nNYCHA employees. \n165.  Mold threatens residents’ health.  When mold grows in a home, it can release \ntoxins and allergens linked to significant respiratory problems, including asthma attacks.  Asthma \nis also a significant public health problem for adults in NYCHA housing.  According to data from \nNYC DOH, between 2012 and 2014, the rate of asthma hospitalizations for NYCHA residents \naged 20 and above was four times higher than for the rest of New York City. \n166.  Mold grows where there is sustained moisture, which is endemic at NYCHA as a \nresult of leaks, flooding, and poor ventilation.  From 2013 to 2016, NYCHA residents complained \nabout flooding or leaks from ceilings, walls, and pipes between 117,000 and 146,000 times each \nyear, and again, those numbers have been increasing. Ventilation at NYCHA is often broken, \nshut off, or too weak to be effective, leaving interior rooms unable to vent moisture.  According to \nNYCHA’s own records, where such data is available, roughly 3 out of every 5 mold complaints \nare caused by leaks and poor building ventilation.   \n46 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 47 of 80\n167.  One example of how mold and leaks affect residents is the case of a tenant from \nthe Sheepshead Bay Houses.  This resident, who has three children—two of whom have been \ndiagnosed with “persistent asthma”—had complained to NYCHA about mold and leaks numerous \ntimes between June 2013 and February 2015.  Yet NYCHA had denied the resident’s request that \nher family be transferred to a new apartment as a reasonable accommodation based on her \nchildren’s asthma.  A NYCHA staff member visited this resident’s apartment in February 2015 \nand confirmed the presence of “mold and mildew throughout her apartment.”    \n168.  In another instance, a family in the Long Island Baptist Houses experienced \nrepeated leaks and mold, with over a dozen mold growths from 2013 to 2017.  The family \nrepeatedly complained to NYCHA, which recorded numerous work orders with descriptions like \n“flooding” and “constant leaking,” including one from November 2016 for “roof leaking above.”  \nBut the problem was not addressed, and in 2017, the ceiling in the bathroom collapsed, the result \nof years of water damage.  \n169.  No one should have to live with mold like what NYCHA maintenance workers \nrecorded in this apartment: \n47 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 48 of 80\n \n170.  Nor the mold recorded in this NYCHA unit: \n \n48 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 49 of 80\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n171.  Worse, NYCHA has often proven unable to eliminate mold in response to \nresidents’ complaints.  Although NYCHA eventually cleans the mold from the walls, the mold \ngrows back in many cases because NYCHA does not successfully address its root causes.  More \nthan 30% of the time, mold growth returns after NYCHA claims to have addressed it.  \n49 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 50 of 80\n172.  Because of NYCHA’s failure to adequately address persistent mold in NYCHA \napartments, NYCHA residents are forced to try to fix even serious mold problems themselves.  \nFor example, one resident in the Baruch Houses reports that, for years, he has cleaned large \npatches of mold off his grandmother’s bathroom ceiling every six months, but the mold always \nreappears. \n173.  NYCHA’s failures persist despite a 2014 settlement of a federal class action \nlawsuit brought by NYCHA residents with asthma, Baez v. NYCHA, No. 13 Civ. 8916 (WHP) \n(S.D.N.Y.).  As a term of this settlement, NYCHA committed to taking several steps intended to \nremediate the mold problem in NYCHA housing, including a promise that NYCHA would \nremediate mold growth within specified timeframes.  NYCHA touted its new mold efforts and \nclaimed to be complying with the new mandated timeframes.  But in fact, NYCHA was just using \nmisleading metrics to make it appear that NYCHA was in compliance.  Instead of reporting how \nlong it took for NYCHA to remediate a mold problem, NYCHA broke up its remediation efforts \ninto multiple subtasks, and then reported how long it took NYCHA, on average, to complete each \nsubtask.  Since each mold remediation effort could require several subtasks, NYCHA’s reporting \nmade it appear that NYCHA was fixing residents’ mold problems far quicker than it actually was.  \n174.   NYCHA failed to “compl[y] with the Consent Decree from the day it was \nentered,” as the federal judge hearing the case subsequently found.  As he put it, “the attitude of \nNYCHA officials” toward its obligations under the Consent Decree “appear[ed] to be one of \nindifference.”   \n175.  This attitude of indifference is apparent in NYCHA’s handling of mold.  Residents \nreport that NYCHA often closes mold work orders without ever addressing the mold problem.  \nAccording to former NYCHA maintenance workers, NYCHA regularly fails to repair broken roof \n50 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 51 of 80\nventilation fans or turns off roof ventilation fans to save money.  And former maintenance \nworkers report that NYCHA staff fail to address leak complaints where the leak is not apparent \nbecause, for example, it is no longer raining.    \n176.   NYCHA’s top management knows that, despite the Baez consent decree, NYCHA \nis still failing to successfully control its mold and leak problems.  NYCHA concedes that mold \nreturns in more than 30% of the apartments where NYCHA has responded to complaints.  In late \n2015, NYCHA learned that a resident’s bathroom ceiling had collapsed after months of persistent \nleaks.  A representative of City Hall asked by email, “How is this kind of thing still happening?”  \nNYCHA’s Chair agreed: “Ridiculous.”  \n3.  NYCHA Fails to Provide Necessary Heat in Winter \n177.  Apartment heating is essential in cold New York winters.   \n178.  HUD’s “decent, safe, and sanitary” regulations require a public housing agency to \nprovide a heating system that is “functionally adequate, operable, and in good repair,” 24 C.F.R. \n§ 5.703(c), (d)(1), and to comply with city building and maintenance codes related to heat, 24 \nC.F.R. § 5.703(g).  New York City long mandated that during winter, when outside temperatures \nfall below 55º during the day or 40º at night, NYCHA must maintain an indoor temperature of at \nleast 68º during the day and 55º at night.  N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 27-2029(a).  Since October \n2017, the standard has become even stricter overnight, requiring an indoor temperature of 62º at \nall times, regardless of outdoor temperatures.  N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 27-2029(a).   \n179.  NYCHA frequently fails to meet these standards.  At most NYCHA developments, \nthe only record of apartment temperatures is created when NYCHA staff visit the apartment:  \nThey are required to manually record temperatures for each apartment they visit.  Although they \nmostly fail to do this, these employees have nonetheless recorded tens of thousands of heating \nviolations between Winter 2011-2012 and Winter 2016-2017.  In fact, for nearly every day when \n51 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 52 of 80\noutside temperatures fell below 55º during the day, NYCHA employees recorded apartment \ntemperatures below—and often five or ten degrees below—the legal minimum. \n180.  At a handful of developments, NYCHA has collected more precise data, which \nconfirms these violations.  At these developments, NYCHA has installed devices that \nelectronically record temperatures every 15 minutes.  The resulting record is clear:  Of the \napproximately 2,800 apartments for which NYCHA provided comprehensive data for the winter \nof 2015-2016, at least 75% of apartments fell below legal limits at some point in the winter, and \non average the apartments with violations fell below the legal limit on at least 21 separate days.   \n181.  Residents called in roughly 825,000 complaints of insufficient heat between 2011 \nand 2016.  In Winter 2015-2016 alone, nearly 43,000 residents called in more than 155,000 \ncomplaints of insufficient heat, with 25,000 residents having to call in a lack of heat at least twice. \n182.  During the frigid weather between December 29, 2017, and January 8, 2018, \nthirty-two NYCHA developments had recurring heat outages.  More than 20,000 work orders for \nheating repair were generated by NYCHA during that ten-day period, with approximately one in \nfour still unresolved as of January 8.  Many thousands of residents were impacted by NYCHA’s \ninability to maintain this basic service when it was needed most. \n183.  More than 323,000 residents—80% of the entire NYCHA population—suffered \nheat outages between October 1, 2017, and January 22, 2018, alone.  According to NYCHA, the \naverage duration of these outages was 48 hours, a significant increase over the prior year. \n184.  Lack of heat drives residents to unsafe self-help, including relying on ovens or \nstoves for heat.  For example, residents at 51 Manhattan Ave reported to NYCHA through their \nattorney that they were “sleeping with their gas ovens on for heat.”  Another resident, at the \nMarlboro Houses, reports that her heat regularly does not turn on, even when the outside \n52 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 53 of 80\ntemperature is freezing, and she routinely uses her stove to heat up her apartment.  Yet another \nresident at the Patterson Houses reports that she has many times left her oven on or boiled water \nfor steam to heat her apartment. \n185.  NYCHA’s heat problems persist despite a 2015 lawsuit by New York City’s \nPublic Advocate challenging NYCHA’s heating policies.  NYCHA settled the lawsuit in March \n2016, offering some accommodations to the handful of residents who joined the Public Advocate \nin the suit, and otherwise falsely declaring that NYCHA’s “heating policy at all times has \ncomplied with applicable law” and that “its procedures and practices for implementing the policy \nmaintain or exceed the minimum temperatures the law requires.”  As described above, NYCHA’s \nown data show that these statements are false.   \n186.  Given this data, and residents’ hundreds of thousands of complaints, NYCHA’s \ntop management is aware of NYCHA’s persistent heating failures.  Moreover, NYCHA’s heating \ndepartment is beset by management and personnel problems.  In February 2017, NYCHA \nreported to this office that its Heating Service and Operation Department had to send disciplinary \nmemos to more than 10% of its heating technicians over the preceding year, and during the same \nperiod it had demoted two heating managers and counseled another seven.     \n4.  NYCHA Fails to Provide Functional and Adequate Elevators \n187.  In NYCHA’s tall buildings, functioning elevators are essential; HUD’s decent, \nsafe and sanitary regulation requires them to be “functionally adequate, operable, and in good \nrepair.”  24 C.F.R. § 5.703(c).  But elevators at NYCHA are out of service far too often and far \ntoo long.   \n53 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 54 of 80\n188.  Based on available outage data, NYCHA experienced an average of 94 outages per \nelevator between 2011 and 2016.8  More than one in eight of these outages lasted for more than \n10 hours.   \n189.  In 2016, NYCHA elevators experienced an average of more than 13 outages per \nelevator.  Almost 40% of NYCHA residents live in buildings where an elevator was out of service \nmore than 20 times in 2016.  The worst 20% of NYCHA elevators had 32 outages on average that \nyear.  And the outage times are getting worse:  Over 20% of outages in 2016 lasted for more than \n10 hours.   \n190.  Often, these outages take out of service the only elevator in the building, or all \nelevators in a building with multiple elevators.  In 2016, nearly 70% of NYCHA buildings with at \nleast one elevator suffered through an outage during which all of the building’s elevators were \nout.  \n191.  Not only are NYCHA’s elevators often broken, but these breakdowns frequently \noccur when residents are in the elevators.  NYCHA work order data reflect that, in 2016, \napproximately 1,900 elevator outages involved a passenger who was stuck in the elevator during \nthe outage.  It took NYCHA an average of two hours to resolve these situations, suggesting that \nmany NYCHA passengers are stuck in elevators for significant periods of time. \n192.  NYCHA management is aware of the disruption to residents’ lives caused by the \nfailure of its elevators.  For example, in 2016, a former resident of Holmes Towers whose family \nstill resides there reached out to senior NYCHA management about “severe elevator issues” in \nthat development.  The former resident reported that NYCHA had been “updating” its elevators in \n                                                 \n8 Because NYCHA’s workorder data does not appear to clearly label all preventive maintenance \nfor its elevators, and thus does not reflect all outages due to preventive maintenance, it is likely \nthat the number of outages is even higher. \n54 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 55 of 80\nthe building for several months, and the one elevator in service regularly broke down, forcing \nresidents to choose between waiting “for hours in a lobby with no fan or air conditioning” or \nclimbing the stairs.   \n193.  NYCHA’s elevator failures are bad enough for any resident, but they are an \nextreme hardship for disabled and elderly residents.  For example, the president of a residents’ \nassociation emailed NYCHA Operations executives and managers in 2013 reporting that a \nwheelchair-using senior resident at the Melrose Houses “was forced to sleep downstairs in her \nwheelchair [and] couldn’t get home till Tuesday morning at 5:35 a.m.”  This situation resulted \nfrom “a double header”—NYCHA’s terminology for having all elevators in a multiple-elevator \nbuilding down at once.   \n194.  In 2014, the residents’ association president reported the same problem having hit \nhis own family:  Copying senior NYCHA management, he wrote: “I think this is horrible that my \nfamily had to carry my little brother up 15 floors in a wheelchair” because of another double \nheader.   \n195.  In 2015, a resident at the Carver Houses describes providing a fellow resident with \nwater and a cool rag as they climbed the stairs to the fifteenth floor.  Three days later, the \nelevators were out of service again, leaving three elderly and one disabled resident stranded in the \nlobby.  In an email that reached a senior NYCHA Operations manager, the resident pleads, “[i]s \nthere ever going to be any relief to this situation here once and for all”?  When the resident was \nfinally informed that the elevators were restored, she wrote back that “some one higher up should \nsee a bigger issue than just to send out repair men for what will become a TEMPORARY repair” \nand that “when shortcuts [are] taken [they] become dangerous to innocent people.”  She pleaded \n55 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 56 of 80\nthat NYCHA investigate the cause of the outages “and solve it once and for all” to ensure the \nsafety of herself and her family.  This email, too, made its way to senior NYCHA management. \n196.  Even when NYCHA tries to upgrade its elevators, it subjects residents to \nprolonged service outages.  For example, in 2017, the sole elevator in a building in the Betances \ndevelopment in the Bronx was taken out of service for a lengthy period of modernization.  During \nthat period, a fifth-floor resident of that building, who has difficulty using the stairs, had to call \nNYCHA each time she needed to leave or come back to her apartment so that NYCHA could \nprovide her with a stair climber to help her up and down the stairs.  As a result, this resident was \nonly able to leave her apartment for pre-scheduled medical appointments.  \n197.  NYCHA’s elevator maintenance problems have consequences.  In December 2015, \nan 84-year-old resident of the Boston Road Plaza senior building was killed by a NYCHA \nelevator malfunction.  Due to a breakdown of basic communication, NYCHA senior management \ndid not even learn of the incident and investigate it until four days after it had occurred.  A New \nYork City Department of Investigation Report found that the death resulted from, among other \nthings, poor maintenance and a failure to respond adequately to a resident’s report of the problem.   \n198.  Despite significant public pressure on these issues, including a September 2012 \nsettlement of a lawsuit (Brito v. NYCHA, No. 09 Civ. 1621) in which NYCHA agreed to institute \na series of changes designed to improve elevator maintenance and performance, NYCHA has not \ncorrected its failure to provide reliable and safe elevator service to its tenants.   \n5.  NYCHA Fails to Address Rats, Mice, and Other Vermin \n199.  NYCHA has been unable to prevent “infestation by rats, mice, or other vermin.”  \n24 C.F.R. § 5.703(f).   \n200.  According to NYCHA’s work order data, NYCHA residents reported more than \n280,000 roach complaints from 2010-2016, more than 130,000 mouse complaints, and nearly \n56 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 57 of 80\n15,000 rat complaints.  An average of more than 19,000 apartments reported roach problems \nevery year, and an average of nearly 10,000 reported mice.  NYCHA residents in more than 1,900 \nbuildings complained about rat problems in that same period.   \n201.  The problem at NYCHA is significantly worse than normal pest problems present \nin other rental housing in New York City.  According to the Census Department’s 2014 Housing \nand Vacancy Survey, residents in 14% of NYCHA units reported seeing 20 or more cockroaches \na day.  That is more than three times the percentage for all renter-occupied New York City \nhousing.  The same study showed that more than a quarter of NYCHA units reported a rodent \ninfestation in their building. \n202.  The problem is getting worse.  NYCHA’s internal data shows that resident roach \ncomplaints more than doubled between 2010 and 2016.  NYCHA’s work order data also indicates \nthat the number of apartments reporting mice and rat complaints have been increasing since \n2013.  \n203.  Pests harm residents’ health.  Roach saliva and droppings exacerbate asthma; as \ndescribed above, asthma is widespread at NYCHA.  Mice and rats directly transmit diseases, and \ntheir droppings can contaminate food and water supplies. \n204.  NYCHA’s pest problems stem from poor sanitation and waste management \n(providing food for the pests); widespread leaks (providing water); and a failure to address holes \nin apartment walls (providing access and safe havens).  NYC DOH has brought these issues to \nNYCHA’s attention.  For example, in March 2016, NYC DOH notified NYCHA of “very active \nrat conditions” its inspector found at the Wise Towers in Manhattan.  The NYC DOH inspector \nreported finding “rubbish,” “debris,” and “[m]any bags of garbage” contributing to a rat problem \nevidenced by “rat droppings” and at least 29 “rat burrows” on the property. \n57 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 58 of 80\n205.  Modern pest management methods, known as “Integrated Pest Management” (or \n“IPM”), take these causes into account.  As a study co-authored by a NYCHA executive put it, \nIPM is “an approach that primarily involves improving sanitary and structural conditions to deny \npests food, water, harborage, and movement.”  These techniques have been shown to reduce \npests, including in a major study performed in NYCHA buildings.  Yet NYCHA fails to apply \nIPM in a meaningful way.  Instead, trash is widespread; leaks are common; and holes in walls are \nfrequently unaddressed.   \n206.  In an April 2015 e-mail, a NYC DOH inspector explained the consequences of \nNYCHA’s failure to use pest management methods like IPM.  On of one of his field visits to a \nNYCHA development, the inspector found “newly installed cabinets” that “quickly became a \nbeautiful rat condo” because the installation “left gaps and harborage for roaches.”  As the \ninspector noted, the installation of the cabinets “was not preceded by a pest management visit” to \naddress the roach infestation in the apartment, therefore “[t]he existing roach population had no \ntrouble moving in.” \n207.  When extermination is required, NYCHA also often fails.  According to one \nformer NYCHA employee who worked in NYCHA’s extermination services group and ultimately \nran that group, NYCHA’s exterminators work in an environment of “chaos”:  At times, they lack \nthe appropriate pesticides to do their work because NYCHA fails to pay its suppliers and \nadequately stock necessary supplies; they fail to follow a systematic and efficient procedure for \nscheduling extermination appointments; and they are asked by senior management to deviate \nfrom set policies and procedures.   \n208.  For many developments, the presence of pests morphs into full-blown infestations.  \nIn 2016, the basement of the Patterson Houses was discovered to have a labyrinth of rat burrows \n58 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 59 of 80\nand dozens of rats beneath it.  Unfortunately, these issues are not confined to basements and \npublic spaces.  A 2012 work order described the residents of an apartment in the Randolph \nHouses as “overcome by rats.”  Another work order from 2016 included a quote from a resident \nin the Marcy Houses: “Too many mice. They climb on my baby crib and I have an asthmatic child \nand it affects him.” \n209.  Moreover, around 2012, NYCHA abandoned routine extermination services.  Once \nthe routine exterminations stopped, only tenants who called to complain about pest issues were \nprovided with extermination services; however, tenants were never informed that the routine \nexterminations had been stopped and that they needed to call and complain to get extermination \nservices.  Pest infestations “exploded” as a result.  Despite the frequency of infestations, routine \nexterminations were not resumed until at least 2016. \n210.  Another former NYCHA exterminator, described a culture where exterminators \nwere directed to “fake it.”  This meant that exterminators would sometimes spray water instead of \npesticides when the necessary pesticides were in short supply.  Exterminators would also close \nout work orders as “tenant not home” without confirming that was the case when they were given \ntoo many orders in one day.  These practices were known, sanctioned, and encouraged by the \nexterminator’s supervisor. \n211.  In the absence of reasonable pest management by NYCHA, residents are often \nforced to resort to pesticides and insecticides that they purchase on their own.  For example, a \n2016 work order from a resident in Marlboro Houses reflects that the resident was buying \n“poison” to address bedbugs and roaches and repeatedly sprayed the ventilation units himself.  \nWhen residents are forced to purchase and use their own pesticides, there is a significant risk that \n59 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 60 of 80\nthese potentially dangerous chemicals will not be used properly or that illegal pesticides will be \nused.  \n212.  The core of the problem lies with the failure of NYCHA’s management.  For \nexample, in 2015, the Manhattan Borough President accurately summarized the rat problem at a \npress conference, saying that NYCHA “has no idea how to handle rats.”  In a subsequent email \nbetween NYC DOH and City Hall, the NYC DOH Commissioner explained that the Borough \nPresident “may be right.”  She emphasized that NYCHA has “challenges in waste management,” \nand that “it is not easy to get [NYCHA’s] ‘rat reservoirs’ under control.”   \n213.  Indeed, NYCHA senior management know that NYCHA residents live with pests \nas a part of their daily life, those officials and managers often fail to take action, except in \nresponse to public criticism.  One apartment in particular caught the eye of senior NYCHA \nmanagement after an inquiry by the Mayor’s office and a State Senator’s office due to a rodent \ninfestation in the apartment.  The resident had requested a transfer to another apartment, which \nwas rejected by NYCHA.  A few weeks later, during an apartment inspection, the resident’s son \nshowed the inspector a video of a rat in the apartment’s bathtub, despite previous efforts at \nextermination.  The issue was ultimately elevated to a senior NYCHA executive, among others, \nbecause of prior “significant media coverage.” \n214.  Similarly, in February 2016, a senior NYCHA executive was made aware by email \nof a resident who had been living with a water bug infestation for two years.  The resident had \n“put in tickets just to have them route to another trade just to be told that they don’t plaster pipes.”  \nThe resident was reportedly forced to “discard furniture[,] food[,] and clothing because these \nwater bugs are nesting in everything.”  In response, the NYCHA executive forwarded the email to \nsenior Operations executives, noting her concern that “Greg got the same email”—presumably \n60 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 61 of 80\nGreg Smith, a New York Daily News reporter—before asking for an investigation into the \ncomplaint.   \nNYCHA MADE FALSE STATEMENTS TO HUD AND THE PUBLIC TO AVOID \nSCRUTINY OF MAINTENANCE WORK ORDER BACKLOGS \n215.  NYCHA also misled HUD and the public about its efforts to reduce its massive \nwork order backlog.   \n216.  From 2010 through 2012, NYCHA faced sharp public criticism for its failure to \nperform needed repairs in residents’ apartments.  Newspapers published articles describing \n“[i]nterminable delays for repairs,” which had “become the rule for NYCHA’s 400,000 \nresidents,” as the result of a “backlog of . . . repairs [that] is staggering.”9  One article recounted \nthe story of a “gaping hole in [a] 7-year-old[’]s . . . bedroom wall,” which NYCHA created in \nMay 2010 to address a leak but then left open while it attempted to schedule an appointment for a \nplasterer to close the hole.  Because of NYCHA’s “three-year backlog,” the first available date for \na plasterer was fifteen months later, in August 2011.10  In the meantime, the child’s mother \n“worrie[d] every night about the stench of mold coming from the hole . . . [and] the danger of rats \ngetting in . . . .”11   \n                                                 \n9 Juan Gonzalez, Gonzalez: NYCHA’s new fix system is years behind, N.Y.

NYCHA’s work order backlog—roughly 400,000 work orders on its books at the \nend of each year—was identified in the press as a cause of these living conditions.  Reporting on \nNYCHA’s “staggering volume of open requests for repairs,” the press described “housing \ndevelopments [that] are overrun by rodents,” “mold-riddled apartments” that caused NYCHA’s \nchildren to suffer asthma at “nearly three times [the rate of children] in private family houses,” \nand elevators that were inoperable “[e]very other day.”12   \n218.  Public criticism intensified in the summer of 2012.  On August 1, 2012, the cover \nof the New York Daily News read “SACK THEM ALL,” below photographs of NYCHA’s then-\nChair and three other board members.13  Politicians, including the New York City Council \nSpeaker and a Congresswoman, joined the fray, calling for NYCHA to release a report it had \ncommissioned that found a backlog of hundreds of thousands of work orders.14  \n219.  HUD, too, began pressuring NYCHA, insisting that NYCHA come up with a plan \nto address these problems. \n220.  In the face of this public and regulatory pressure, NYCHA promised HUD and the \npublic that it would make efficiency and productivity improvements to eliminate the backlog, and \nultimately claimed to have done so.  Instead, a significant portion of NYCHA’s backlog reduction \ninvolved simply moving needed work off the books—principally by unlawfully suspending all \n                                                 \n12 Greg B.

NYCHA Indefinitely Suspended Annual Inspections to Avoid Generating New Work \nOrders \n221.  Annual apartment inspections, by design, generate new work orders for repairs that \nthe inspectors identify as necessary.  At NYCHA, approximately 170,000 work orders had been \ngenerated by annual inspections in 2011.  As of August 2012, NYCHA was on pace to generate \neven more work orders through inspections in 2012.  \n222.  To artificially reduce backlog numbers, in late August 2012 NYCHA executives \nindefinitely suspended all annual apartment inspections.  NYCHA specifically intended the \nsuspension of inspections to avoid the creation of large numbers of new work orders, as well as to \nfree up personnel to work on backlog reduction projects.  As a top NYCHA executive \nacknowledged  when this suspension of inspections was disclosed to HUD in 2016, the reason for \nthe suspension was “putting too much focus on work order numbers.” \n223.  This indefinite suspension of inspections was unlawful.  The U.S. Housing Act \nrequires that all public housing agencies “make an annual inspection of each public housing \nproject to determine whether units in the project are maintained in accordance with” the \nrequirement that apartments be decent, safe, sanitary and in good repair.  42 U.S.C. § 1437d(f)(3); \nsee also 24 C.F.R. § 5.703.  This statutory requirement allows housing agencies some flexibility \non how to implement apartment inspections—for example, they may choose to inspect a \nrepresentative sample rather than every unit.  But it does not allow housing agencies simply to \nsuspend all annual apartment inspections.   \n224.  HUD had issued guidance and reviewed these requirements with NYCHA just \nmonths prior to NYCHA’s suspension of inspections, and—well aware of the requirements—one \n63 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 64 of 80\nNYCHA executive voiced concerns to others at NYCHA about the proposal to suspend annual \ninspections.  He advised NYCHA officials that any suspension longer than a few months would \nviolate HUD’s requirements.   \n225.  The suspension of annual inspections in fact lasted two years, until the summer of \n2014.  As time passed, the NYCHA executive reiterated to higher NYCHA management his \nconcern that NYCHA was in violation of the annual inspection requirement.  He was ignored. \n226.  Through this decision to suspend annual inspections, between August 2012 and the \nend of December 2013—when NYCHA declared that its backlog reduction efforts had been \nsuccessful—NYCHA in fact moved an estimated 200,000 work orders off its books based on its \nprior rate of generating work orders from inspections.  It did not disclose this fact to HUD or the \npublic. \n227.  Suspending inspections did not eliminate the need for the work that the inspections \nwould have found.  Rather, it just allowed NYCHA to avoid documenting needed work in its \nwork order system—until some later date when a resident complained about conditions or \ninspections resumed.  During that time, problems would get worse, become more costly to fix, or \n(as in the case of leaks and pests) spread into additional apartments.   \n228.  When NYCHA resumed apartment inspections in 2014, its backlog promptly \nbegan to rise again.   \nB.  October 2012 and March 2013: NYCHA Misled HUD at Backlog Meetings \n229.  In 2012, the then-Secretary of HUD directed NYCHA’s senior executives to travel \nto Washington to explain NYCHA’s efforts to solve the backlog problem.  At the resulting \nmeetings, NYCHA misled HUD as to its plans. \n230.  On October 18, 2012, NYCHA presented its backlog reduction plan to HUD.  \nNYCHA walked through its backlog reduction plan, showing slides setting out how NYCHA \n64 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 65 of 80\nplanned to eliminate its backlog through “Productivity Improvement.”  NYCHA listed six areas in \nwhich it would improve its capacity to complete work or increase its efficiency: materials, \nplanning and scheduling, process improvements, staffing, communication, and performance \nmanagement.  All of the “Productivity Improvement Drivers” listed involved increasing \nNYCHA’s capacity to complete work or the efficiency with which it did so.  At no point did \nNYCHA advise HUD that NYCHA had indefinitely suspended apartment inspections, let alone \nthat NYCHA had done so expressly to reduce the backlog by keeping needed work off the books \nor that this would be a major driver of its backlog reduction. \n231.  In February 2013, NYCHA met with HUD’s regional office to discuss its recently \nannounced Work Order Backlog Reduction Initiative.  NYCHA described this Initiative in a press \nrelease as intended to “eliminat[e] the entire backlog of outstanding repair requests by the end of \n2013” “[b]y [h]iring [m]ore [w]orkers and [i]mproving [e]fficiencies.”  During its meeting with \nHUD, NYCHA explained that the Initiative was the same plan that NYCHA presented to HUD in \nOctober 2012.  Again, NYCHA did not disclose the suspension of annual inspections.   \n232.  In March 2013, during a telephonic meeting with HUD during which NYCHA \ntouted its progress in reducing its backlog, NYCHA again failed to disclose the suspension of \ninspections. \nC.  NYCHA Changed its Rules to Close Work Orders Without Work \n233.  Beyond suspending apartment inspections, in February 2013 NYCHA restored a \nprior policy that allowed NYCHA staff to close work orders by reporting that the resident was not \nhome when the worker arrived to perform the maintenance work.  This action was taken on the \nrecommendation of a NYCHA executive who explained in an email that the change was being \nmade specifically to reduce backlog numbers. \n65 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 66 of 80\n234.  This change allowed NYCHA to close nearly 200,000 work orders in 2013 \nbecause staff reported that the resident was not home.  If not for the new policy, those work \norders would have remained in NYCHA’s system until NYCHA actually addressed the \nunderlying problems, resulting in backlog numbers higher than those reported by NYCHA. \n235.  NYCHA did not disclose this change in methodology to HUD when claiming \nsuccess in backlog reduction. \nD.  NYCHA Claimed to Have Achieved Meaningful Backlog Reduction  \n236.  Each month from March 2013 through November 2013, NYCHA issued press \nreleases trumpeting its backlog reduction efforts and claiming that these efforts resulted from \nefficiency improvements at NYCHA.  For instance, in its first release, on March 11, 2013, \nNYCHA reported that it had “reduced the number of open work orders from a peak of over \n420,000 to less than 350,000” and claimed that this “reduction is a result of NYCHA’s Action \nPlan to improve its efficiency in responding to maintenance and repair work orders.”   \n237.  Similarly, throughout 2013, NYCHA’s senior management met with HUD to \ndiscuss its backlog reduction plans and progress, and provided HUD updates.  Through these \nupdates, NYCHA reported to HUD the monthly reductions in its backlog numbers.  In these \nmeetings, NYCHA did not disclose its efforts to artificially reduce its backlog numbers. \n238.  On January 2, 2014, after years of criticism from the public and HUD, NYCHA \nannounced that it had “successfully reduced its backlog” from 423,000 open maintenance work \norders to only 106,000 work orders.  NYCHA claimed that this reduction “has positively \nimpacted the conditions in which our residents live.”   \n239.  NYCHA also made statements to HUD in its 2014 and 2015 Annual Plans, linking \nits backlog reduction to efficiency improvements. \n66 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 67 of 80\n240.  In none of these statements did NYCHA disclose the suspension of inspections \nthat had led to a significant portion of the claimed reduction, nor did it disclose the other devices \nit used to make its numbers artificially look better than they were. \nNYCHA MADE FALSE STATEMENTS ABOUT LEAD PAINT COMPLIANCE AND \nHOUSING CONDITIONS IN CERTIFICATIONS, CONTRACT AMENDMENTS, AND \nFUNDING DRAWDOWNS \n241.  NYCHA made false statements to HUD multiple times each year when it falsely \ncertified its compliance with HUD requirements. \nA.  False Certifications  \n242.  At least twelve times between 2010 and 2016, NYCHA submitted false \ncertifications to HUD concerning housing conditions.  \n243.  Each certification was submitted as a mandatory part of a Five-Year Plan or \nAnnual Plan package, which in turn are required submissions for all public housing agencies \nseeking HUD funding, or as part of an Amended Annual Plan package.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1437c-1; \n24 C.F.R. Part 903, Subpart B.   \n244.  These false certifications, contained in Form HUD-50077, include certifications \ndated October 14, 2010; October 14, 2011; October 15, 2012; October 11, 2013; July 24, 2014; \nOctober 16, 2014; and May 1, 2015; October 12, 2015 (two certifications); May 13, 2016; and \nOctober 12, 2016.   \n245.  Each of these certifications was false for multiple reasons. \n246.  First, in each Form HUD-50077, NYCHA certified that NYCHA “will comply \nwith the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act, the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard \nReduction Act of 1992, and 24 C.F.R. part 35”—that is, HUD’s lead paint safety regulations. \n67 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 68 of 80\n247.  This statement was false.  As described above, at all times since at least 2010, \nNYCHA has been out of compliance with nearly all of these regulations and statutes, and would \nnot be in compliance going forward.   \n248.  That NYCHA was out of compliance with lead paint regulations was known to \nsenior NYCHA management at the relevant times, as detailed above.   \n249.  Second, in each Form HUD-50077, NYCHA certified that NYCHA “is in \ncompliance with all applicable Federal statutory and regulatory requirements.”  This incorporates \nHUD’s core “decent, safe, and sanitary” regulation.  24 C.F.R. § 5.703. \n250.  This statement was false.  As described above, at all times since at least 2010, \nNYCHA has been in violation of its obligation to provide “decent, safe, and sanitary” housing, \nincluding because of non-compliance with lead paint requirements; pervasive leaks and \nunchecked mold; inadequate heat in winter; widespread pest infestations; and failed elevator \nservice.  24 C.F.R. § 5.703.   \n251.  This non-compliance was known to senior NYCHA management, who also knew \nthat the non-compliance was being covered up through, among other things, misrepresentations \nrelating to NYCHA’s maintenance backlog reduction and PHAS inspections.   \n252.  Third, two of the certifications, dated October 11, 2013, and July 24, 2014, are \nfalse for the additional reason that NYCHA had stopped performing the annual inspections of its \ndevelopments required by the U.S. Housing Act.  42 U.S.C. § 1437d(f)(3).  As discussed above, \nNYCHA intentionally suspended compliance with this statutory requirement in order to generate \nartificial reductions in its maintenance work order backlog.   \nB.  False Annual Amendments to the Annual Contributions Contract \n253.  Each year, in order to obtain funding from HUD’s Capital Fund Program, NYCHA \nenters into an amendment to its “Annual Contributions Contract” with HUD. \n68 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 69 of 80\n254.  The Annual Contributions Contract, or ACC, is a contract between NYCHA and \nthe United States, acting on behalf of HUD.  The current version of NYCHA’s ACC was entered \ninto on April 12, 2005.  In the ACC, in exchange for HUD subsidies, NYCHA agrees to “develop \nand operate” its developments in compliance with all provisions of the ACC, as well as “all \napplicable statutes, executive orders, and regulations issued by HUD,” specifically including the \nprovisions of Title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations. \n255.  NYCHA regularly enters into amendments to its ACC to obtain Capital Fund \nProgram grants.  These amendments are a critical step in requesting and receiving such grants. \n256.  Between July 2010 and March 2016, NYCHA entered into approximately twenty \nsuch amendments to the ACC.  Pursuant to these amendments, over $2 billion in Capital Fund \nProgram grants were paid to NYCHA.  NYCHA continued to enter into such amendments after \nMarch 2016, and will do so in the future.   \n257.  In each amendment, NYCHA represents that it will “continue to operate each \ndevelopment”—or in some of the amendments, synonymously, “continue to operate each public \nhousing project”—as low-income housing “in compliance with” the ACC.  The ACC requires \ncompliance with regulations, including Title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations.  This, in turn, \nincorporates HUD’s lead paint safety regulations and core “decent, safe, and sanitary” \nregulations.  24 C.F.R. § 5.703. \n258.  In each amendment, NYCHA’s representation is false.  As described above, at all \ntimes since at least 2010, NYCHA has been in violation of the lead paint safety regulations and its \nobligation to provide “decent, safe, and sanitary” housing.  Additionally, the ACC amendments \nbetween about August 2012 and summer of 2014 were false because NYCHA had stopped \n69 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 70 of 80\nperforming the annual inspections of its developments as required by the U.S. Housing Act.  42 \nU.S.C. § 1437d(f)(3).   \n259.  As discussed above, NYCHA senior management, and others, knew about \nNYCHA’s non-compliance.  \nC.  False Representations Through Drawdown of Operating Funds \n260.  HUD issues periodic Obligation Letters to NYCHA, which notify NYCHA that it \ncan draw down the Operating Fund subsidies HUD has made available to NYCHA for that \nfunding period.   \n261.  Each Obligation Letter states that “[a]ll funds must be used in accordance with the \nAnnual Contributions Contract and associated laws and regulations,” which, as described above, \nincludes Title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations.  Each letter also notifies NYCHA that “[b]y \ndrawing down the funds obligated in this letter, [NYCHA is] confirming agreement and \ncompliance with . . . all terms and conditions of the Operating Fund program,” which includes, \nbut is not limited to, the requirements of the U.S. Housing Act and the ACC. \n262.  Each year, HUD issues multiple such Obligation Letters to NYCHA, pursuant to \nwhich NYCHA draws down Operating Fund subsidies.  In 2016 alone, HUD issued to NYCHA \nnine Obligation Letters that obligated to NYCHA over $7.3 million in funds.  NYCHA will \ncontinue to draw down funds pursuant to such Operating Fund Obligation letters in the future.   \n263.  Each time NYCHA drew down Operating Funds pursuant to these Obligation \nLetters, NYCHA falsely confirmed its compliance with the ACC and the U.S. Housing Act.  As \ndescribed above, at all times since at least 2010, NYCHA has been in violation of the lead paint \nsafety regulations and its obligation to provide “decent, safe, and sanitary” housing.  Additionally, \nNYCHA’s confirmations of compliance when it drew down funds between about August 2012 \n70 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 71 of 80\nand summer of 2014 were false because NYCHA had stopped performing the annual inspections \nof its developments as required by the U.S. Housing Act.  42 U.S.C. § 1437d(f)(3).   \n264.  As discussed above, NYCHA senior management and others knew about \nNYCHA’s non-compliance.  \nNYCHA CAUSED NEW YORK CITY TO MAKE FALSE STATEMENTS  \nABOUT LEAD PAINT COMPLIANCE IN ITS ANNUAL  \n“CONSOLIDATED PLANS” SUBMITTED TO HUD \n265.  Every year, New York City must submit a “Consolidated Plan” to HUD.  The \nConsolidated Plan “serves as [New York City’s] comprehensive housing affordability strategy, \ncommunity development plan, and submissions for funding” under certain HUD grant programs.  \n24 C.F.R. § 91.5.   \n266.  Every year from at least 2011 through 2016, NYCHA has submitted the following \nfalse statement to New York City, which New York City then incorporated into its Consolidated \nPlan and submitted it to HUD: \nNYCHA complies with Federal, State, and City regulations concerning lead \npaint hazards and executes HUD directives regarding lead-based paint (LBP). \nNYCHA identifies hazards posed by paint, dust and soil, and implements \nprograms designed to control or mitigate such hazards safely and efficiently. \n267.  These statements were submitted to New York City by or at the direction of \nNYCHA officials, who knew at the time of their submission that the statements were untrue.  \nCLAIM FOR RELIEF  \nCOUNT ONE: SUBSTANTIAL DEFAULT \n268.  The United States repeats and realleges the allegations in paragraphs 1 through \n267.  \n269.  As described above, NYCHA has violated HUD regulations including the Lead-\nSafe Housing Rule, 24 C.F.R. Part 35, Subparts (B-R), and its obligation to provide “decent, safe, \n71 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 72 of 80\nand sanitary” housing, 24 C.F.R. § 5.703; has engaged in deceptive conduct with respect to PHAS \ninspections; and has violated applicable terms of NYCHA’s Annual Contributions Contract. \n270.  These violations of federal law and the Annual Contributions Contract constitute a \nsubstantial default by NYCHA with respect to the covenants or conditions to which NYCHA is \nsubject.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(j)(3)(A). \n271.  Accordingly, the United States is entitled to an order providing for injunctive relief \nand appointment of a monitor under 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(j)(3), to remedy NYCHA’s substantial \ndefault with respect to covenants or conditions to which NYCHA is subject. \nCOUNT TWO: ANTI-FRAUD INJUNCTION ACT \n272.  The United States repeats and realleges the allegations in paragraphs 1 through \n271. \n273.  The Anti-Fraud Injunction Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1345, authorizes the United States to \ncommence a civil action to enjoin any ongoing or impending violation of certain specified \npredicate offenses and for related relief.  These predicate offenses include 18 U.S.C. § 1001.  See \n18 U.S.C. § 1345(a)(1)(A). \n274.  NYCHA has unlawfully, willfully, knowingly, or acting with deliberate ignorance \nand/or with reckless disregard of the truth, in matters within the jurisdiction of HUD, falsified, \nconcealed, or covered up by tricks, schemes, and devices a material fact; made materially false, \nfictitious, or fraudulent statements and representations; and made and used false writings or \ndocuments knowing the same to contain materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or \nentries, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001.  Specifically, from at least 2010, NYCHA has \nunlawfully, willfully, knowingly, or acting with deliberate ignorance and/or with reckless \ndisregard of the truth, (i) repeatedly made false statements (including through material omissions) \nto HUD regarding conditions at NYCHA and NYCHA’s compliance with the U.S. Housing Act \n72 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 73 of 80\nand HUD regulations, (ii) repeatedly concealed and covered up conditions and NYCHA’s \nnoncompliance with the U.S. Housing Act and HUD regulations, and (iii) repeatedly made and \nused knowingly false writings and documents to deceive HUD regarding conditions at NYCHA \nand NYCHA’s noncompliance with the U.S. Housing Act and HUD regulations. \n275.  Without injunctive relief, NYCHA’s deceptive conduct and its ongoing effects will \ncontinue. \n276.  Accordingly, the United States is entitled to an order providing for injunctive relief \nand appointment of a monitor under 18 U.S.C. § 1345, to prevent NYCHA, its employees, and all \nthose in concert with them from committing further violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1001 and to require \nNYCHA to mitigate the effects of prior violations. \nCOUNT THREE: VIOLATIONS OF TSCA AND THE RRP RULE \n277.  The United States on behalf of EPA repeats and realleges the allegations in \nparagraphs 1 through 276. \n278.  NYCHA is a “firm” that performs “renovations” within the meaning of the RRP \nRule. \n279.  NYCHA has failed to comply with the requirements of the RRP Rule in \nperforming such renovations, including but not limited to failing to ensure that a certified \nrenovator is assigned to each such renovation and that its employees other than certified \nrenovators are properly trained on safe work practices, in violation of 40  C.F.R. §§ 745.81(a)(3),  \n745.89(d)(1), and 745.89(d)(2); failing to follow safe work-practice requirements before, during, \nafter the renovation, in violation of 40 C.F.R. §§ 745.85 and 745.89(d)(3); and failing to provide \nresidents with required information and warnings, in violation of 40 C.F.R. §§ 745.84(a), \n745.85(a)(1), 745.89(d)(3), and 745.89(d)(4). \n280.  Violations of the RRP Rule are “prohibited acts” under TSCA.  15 U.S.C. § 2689. \n73 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 74 of 80\n281.  Without injunctive relief, NYCHA will continue to fail to comply with the RRP \nRule and TSCA when performing work covered by the Rule. \n282.  Accordingly, pursuant to sections 17 and 409 of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. §§ 2616 and \n2689, the United States is entitled to an order enjoining NYCHA to comply with the RRP Rule \nand TSCA, and mitigate the effects of past violations. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, the United States respectfully requests that the Court: \n \n(i)  Order injunctive relief and appointment of a monitor under 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1437d(j)(3), to remedy NYCHA’s substantial default with respect to \ncovenants or conditions to which NYCHA is subject; \n \n(ii)  Order injunctive relief and appointment of a monitor under 18 U.S.C. \n§ 1345, to prevent NYCHA, its employees, and all those in concert with \nthem from committing further violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1001 and to \nrequire NYCHA to mitigate the effects of prior violations. \n  \n(iii)  Order NYCHA to comply with the RRP Rule and TSCA, and to mitigate \nthe effects of past violations; and  \n \n(iv)  Order such further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.  \n \n74 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213   Document 1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 75 of 80\nDated: June 11, 2018          \nNew York, New York       GEOFFREY S.

RECITALS \n1.  WHEREAS, plaintiff the United States of America commenced this action \nagainst the defendant New York City Housing Authority (“NYCHA”) for appointment of a \nmonitor and injunctive and other relief pursuant to the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (“Housing \nAct”), 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(j)(3), the Anti-Fraud Injunction Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1345, the Residential \nLead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, 42 U.S.C. § 4852d(b)(1), and the Toxic \nSubstances Control Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2616(a)(1); \n2.  WHEREAS, the United States alleges that NYCHA violated and continues to \nviolate lead paint safety regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, see 24 C.F.R. part 35; 40 C.F.R. \npart 745, as well as other HUD regulations, including those requiring public housing agencies to \nprovide housing that is “decent, safe, sanitary and in good repair,” 24 C.F.R. § 5.703; \n3.  WHEREAS, the City of New York (the “City”) agrees to the funding \ncommitment in paragraphs 54 to 62 of this Consent Decree; \n4.  WHEREAS, the Parties agree that settlement of this case is in the public interest \nand that entry of this Consent Decree is an appropriate means of resolving the claims asserted by \nthe United States in its Complaint; and \n5.  WHEREAS, the Court finds that this Consent Decree is fair, reasonable, and \nconsistent with the public interest;  \n6.  NOW, THEREFORE, with the consent of the Parties, it is hereby ORDERED, \nADJUDGED and DECREED as follows: \nII.  ADMISSIONS \n7.  NYCHA admits, acknowledges, and accepts responsibility for the following \nconduct: \nStatements to HUD \na.  At least once a year, beginning no later than 2010 and extending through 2016, \nNYCHA’s certifications to HUD contained untrue representations that NYCHA \n“will comply with” HUD’s federal lead paint safety regulations. \nb.  At least once a year, beginning no later than 2010 and extending through 2016, \nNYCHA’s certifications to HUD contained untrue representations that NYCHA \nwas “in compliance with all applicable Federal statutory and regulatory \nrequirements.”    \nc.  Every year, since at least 2011 and through 2016, NYCHA submitted to HUD, via \nNew York City’s Consolidated Plans, untrue statements that “NYCHA complies \nwith Federal, State, and City regulations concerning lead and executes HUD \ndirectives regarding lead-based paint (LBP).” \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 5-1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 4 of 29\n \nLead Paint \n \nd.  In more than half of NYCHA’s developments, NYCHA’s inspections (including \nstatistical sampling) have confirmed the presence of lead paint somewhere on the \npremises, and in at least 92 developments, the inspections (including statistical \nsampling) have confirmed the presence of lead paint inside apartment units.   \ne.  Since at least 2010, NYCHA has not performed most of the biennial lead paint \nrisk assessment reevaluations required by regulation for developments containing \nlead paint.  In a 2011 email, a NYCHA director advised a NYCHA executive that \nNYCHA was not conducting required risk assessment reevaluations.   \nf.  From at least 2012 to 2016, NYCHA failed to perform visual assessments of \napartments for lead paint hazards as required by regulation.  In 2016, NYCHA \nbegan performing visual assessments in units where children under six reside, but \nNYCHA has not yet performed visual assessments in the majority of apartments \nthat may contain lead paint.   \ng.  Since at least 2010, NYCHA has not ensured that staff use lead-safe work \npractices when performing work on surfaces that may contain lead paint.  \nNYCHA’s policies and procedures do not ensure that maintenance workers are \ninformed that the surfaces they work on contain lead paint.  Less than one-third of \nthe maintenance workers assigned to NYCHA developments with lead paint are \ntrained in lead-safe work practices.  In May 2016 email, a NYCHA executive \nadvised that “there [were] only 33 paint[ers]/paint supervisors trained in lead safe \npractices” working in Brooklyn developments.  NYCHA has determined that at \nleast 12,000 apartments in Brooklyn developments may contain lead paint.    \nh.  From at least 2010 until 2015, NYCHA did not provide HUD with any \ninformation regarding children living at NYCHA who had been found to have an \nenvironmental intervention blood lead level (“EIBLL”). \nMold Growth \ni.  Between 2011 and present, NYCHA residents have made many thousands of \ncomplaints about mold growth every year.  \nj.  In many cases, NYCHA staff verified that the mold growth covered 10 or more \nsquare feet.  In nearly 300 cases between 2014 and 2016, the verified mold \ngrowth covered more than 100 square feet. \nk.  Currently, after NYCHA has removed mold from apartments, the mold returns at \nleast 30% of the time.   \nAdequate Heating \nl.  Residents called in roughly 825,000 complaints of insufficient heat between 2011 \nand 2016.   \n2 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 5-1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 5 of 29\n \nm.  In Winter 2017-2018 alone, more than 320,000 residents, 80% of the public \nhousing population, lost heat. \nFunctional Elevators \nn.  In 2016 alone, NYCHA experienced an average of more than 13 outages per \nelevator.  The majority of NYCHA elevator buildings had at least one period with \nno functioning elevator service in 2016.    \no.  Although NYCHA provides stair climbers to elderly or disabled residents in \ncertain circumstances, NYCHA elevator outages can leave residents, including \nelderly and disabled residents, stranded in the lobby of their building.   \nPest Infestations \np.  NYCHA’s data reflects more than 260,000 work orders for roaches between 2013 \nand 2016.  For the same period, there were more than 90,000 mouse work orders \nand nearly 36,000 rat work orders.   \nq.  The number of work orders created for roaches nearly doubled between 2013 and \n2016, and the number of apartments reporting mice and rat complaints has been \nincreasing since 2013.  \nBacklog  \nr.  From 2012 to 2013, NYCHA reported to HUD significant progress in reducing its \nbacklog of work orders.  During the same period, NYCHA suspended annual \ninspections, resulting in the creation of substantially fewer work orders.  NYCHA \nreported its progress to HUD without mentioning its suspension of annual \ninspections. \nHUD Inspections \ns.  Every year, HUD assesses living conditions at NYCHA through Public Housing \nAssessment System (“PHAS”) inspections.   \nt.  For a decade, NYCHA provided its staff with a list of “Quick Fix Tips” to \nimprove inspection scores.  These Quick Fix Tips included replacing damaged \nceiling tiles with “painted cardboard,” covering broken fences with 2x4s painted \nblack, and placing “improperly stored flammables” “out of sight” on the day of an \ninspection.   \nu.  In one 2013 email, a NYCHA superintendent wrote to staff members, “We’re \nhiding four big pails of oil behind your containers for our PHAS inspection today. \nWe’ll get them after it’s over.”  The superintendent then forwarded his email to a \nNYCHA director, to request assistance in eventually disposing of the oil. \n \n3 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 5-1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 6 of 29\n \nIII.

NYCHA and the \nMonitor shall consider public health and safety, cost, and other factors deemed relevant by the \nMonitor in developing Action Plans.  Each proposed Action Plan shall set forth specific actions \nnecessary to bring NYCHA into sustained compliance with these requirements, shall require \nNYCHA to satisfy these requirements by a date certain, and shall include interim milestones \nwith specific completion dates.  \n28.   As soon as practicable after the Monitor’s appointment, NYCHA in consultation \nwith the Monitor shall develop an operational plan (“Operational Plan”) clearly delineating the \nroles, responsibilities, authorities, and reporting lines of NYCHA’s Chair, General Manager, and \nBoard, to enable NYCHA to expeditiously fulfill the purposes of the Consent Decree and submit \nsuch Operational Plan to the Monitor for review.

If NYCHA and the Monitor are unable to agree \non an Organizational Plan, then the Monitor shall develop his or her own Organizational Plan \npursuant to paragraph 31. \n30.  Proposed Action Plans, the proposed Operational Plan, and the proposed \nOrganizational Plan (collectively, “Plans”) developed pursuant to paragraphs 27, 28, and 29 shall \nbe submitted to the City for comment and to the United States for approval.  If approved by the \nUnited States, such Plans shall be filed on the Court’s public docket, shall be binding on \nNYCHA as of the date of filing on the docket, and shall be enforceable by the Court upon \napplication by the Monitor or the United States.   \n31.  If the Monitor and NYCHA are unable to agree on a Plan, or the United States \ndoes not approve a Plan submitted to it, the Monitor may instead develop his or her own Plan \nand submit it directly to the Court for approval.  Within 30 days thereafter, the United States and \nNYCHA shall have an opportunity to submit any objections to, or arguments in support of, such \nPlan.  The Monitor’s Plan shall be modified or set aside by the Court only if found to be arbitrary \nand capricious.

Such proposed modified Plan is subject to the approval process and other terms described \nin paragraphs 30 through 31, including the ability of the Monitor to submit his or her own \nmodification to the Court in the absence of agreement. \n33.  In an Action Plan addressing the requirements in paragraph 18(a), the Monitor \nmay propose to modify paragraph 18(a)(8) to permit abatement of specific NYCHA \ndevelopments by methods that are authorized by federal regulations other than removal, upon a \nfinding by the Monitor that NYCHA will be able to comply with the ongoing maintenance and \nother obligations associated with using such alternate methods and that permitting such alternate \nmeasures will further the purposes of this Consent Decree.  Upon approval of such Action Plan \npursuant to paragraphs 30 and 31, paragraph 18(a)(8) shall be deemed modified for purposes of \nthis Consent Decree. \n \n34.  An Action Plan may include, among other things, policies, procedures, systems, \npersonnel and management structures to be adopted by NYCHA in order to come into \ncompliance with, and maintain compliance with, federal law and NYCHA’s obligations \ncontained in paragraph 18 and otherwise as set forth in this Consent Decree. \n35.

The Parties agree that receipt of \nthe $550 million in emergency state resources and the procurement flexibility afforded by \nprovisions of the Executive Order relating to rules of procurement and contracting and \ndesign/build authority are important to the success of this Consent Decree. \n10 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 5-1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 13 of 29\n \n39.  The Monitor shall coordinate with any other court-appointed officers addressing \nmatters covered by this Consent Decree, including the Special Master appointed in Baez v. \nNYCHA, No. 13 Civ. 8915, as well as any relevant federal, state or local agencies or inspectors.  \nIn the event that the action or failure to take action of another court-appointed officer interferes \nwith achieving the purposes of this Consent Decree, the Monitor, with the consent of the United \nStates, may seek relief from the Court. \nJudicial Supervision \n40.  The Monitor, as an officer of the Court, shall be supervised by the Court. \nReporting \n41.

If the Parties agree that there exists \nundue financial hardship on the part of the City, then NYCHA or the Monitor may seek a \nmodification of applicable Action Plans pursuant to paragraph 32.   \n62.  The Monitor, the United States, and NYCHA may object to the City’s \ncertification, in which case the Court will decide whether, because of undue financial hardship, \nthe City is financially unable to provide the funding as required by this Consent Decree.  If the \nCourt finds that the undue financial hardship did not occur, or that the City has the financial \nability to pay some or all of the funding owed under this Consent Decree, the Court shall enter an \n14 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 5-1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 17 of 29\n \nappropriate order requiring payment.  If no objection is filed to the certification, or if the Court \nrejects any objection that is filed, the City shall make the Unpaid Amount available for payment \nto NYCHA pursuant to paragraph 54 on before the Future Availability Date.  If the Court finds \nundue financial hardship, the Monitor and/or NYCHA may apply to the Court for modification \nof applicable Action Plans pursuant to paragraph 32.  \nX.

This Consent Decree does not limit in \nany way SDNY’s prerogative to criminally investigate and/or criminally charge and prosecute \nany individual. \n73.  The United States reserves all legal and equitable remedies available to enforce \nthe provisions of this Consent Decree. \n74.  The United States reserves the right to seek further injunctive or equitable relief \nunder its Complaint to supplement this Consent Decree if the Monitorship fails to achieve its \npurposes. \n75.  Except as to the claims described in paragraphs 71 and 72, this Consent Decree \nshall not be construed to limit the rights of the United States to seek relief under the Housing \nAct, Anti-Fraud Injunction Act, TSCA, or under other federal laws or regulations.  The United \nStates further reserves all legal and equitable remedies to address any potential imminent and \nsubstantial endangerment to the public health or welfare or the environment arising at, or posed \nby, NYCHA’s conduct, whether related to the claims described in paragraphs 71 and 72 or \notherwise. \n76.  In any subsequent administrative or judicial proceeding initiated by the United \nStates for injunctive relief, civil penalties, or other appropriate relief against NYCHA, NYCHA \nshall not assert, and may not maintain, any defense or claim based upon the principles of waiver, \n17 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 5-1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 20 of 29\n \nres judicata, collateral estoppel, issue preclusion, claim preclusion, claim-splitting, or other \ndefenses based upon any contention that the claims raised by the United States in the subsequent \nproceeding were or should have been brought in this case, except with respect to claims that have \nbeen specifically resolved pursuant to paragraphs 71 and 72. \n77.  This Consent Decree is not a permit, or a modification of any permit, under any \nfederal, state, or local laws or regulations.  NYCHA is responsible for achieving and maintaining \ncomplete compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and permits, \nand NYCHA’s compliance with this Consent Decree shall be no defense to any action \ncommenced pursuant to any such laws, regulations, or permits, except as set forth herein.  The \nUnited States does not, by its consent to the entry of this Consent Decree, warrant or aver in any \nmanner that NYCHA’s compliance with any aspect of this Consent Decree will result in \ncompliance with any provisions of federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or permits. \n78.  This Consent Decree does not limit or affect the rights of the United States \nagainst any third parties not party to this Consent Decree (including any present or former \nemployees, officers, or board members), nor does it limit the rights of third parties, not party to \nthis Consent Decree, against NYCHA, except as otherwise provided by law. \n79.  This Consent Decree shall not be construed to create rights in, or grant any cause \nof action to, anyone not a Party to this Consent Decree. \n80.

HUD specifically reserves the right to appoint, or to seek judicial appointment \nof, a receiver for substantial default, as well as all other administrative remedies. \nXIII.  FORCE MAJEURE \n82.  “Force Majeure,” for purposes of this Consent Decree, is defined as any event \narising from causes beyond the control of NYCHA that delays or prevents the performance of \nany obligation under this Consent Decree despite NYCHA’s best efforts to fulfill the obligation.  \nThe requirement that NYCHA exercise “best efforts to fulfill the obligation” includes using best \nefforts to anticipate any potential Force Majeure event and best efforts to address the effects of \nany potential Force Majeure event (a) as it is occurring and (b) following the potential Force \nMajeure, such that the delay and any adverse effects of the delay are minimized.  “Force \nMajeure” does not include NYCHA’s financial inability to perform any obligation under this \nConsent Decree. \n83.  If the United States agrees, or the Court determines, that a delay or anticipated \ndelay is attributable to a Force Majeure event, the time for performance of the obligations under \nthis Consent Decree that are affected by the Force Majeure event will be extended for such time \nas is necessary to complete those obligations in light of the Force Majeure event.  An extension \nof the time for performance of the obligations affected by the Force Majeure event shall not, of \nitself, extend the time for performance of any other obligation.    \n18 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 5-1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 21 of 29\n \nXIV.  DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND COMPELLING PERFORMANCE \n84.  The Court shall retain jurisdiction over this case until termination of this Consent \nDecree, for the purpose of resolving disputes arising under this Consent Decree, entering orders \nmodifying this Consent Decree, or effectuating or enforcing compliance with the terms of this \nDecree. \n85.  Should any dispute about the implementation of this Consent Decree arise, the \nParties and the Monitor will endeavor in good faith to resolve it.  If they cannot do so, they shall \nraise the dispute with this Court, which shall resolve it. \n86.  Except as otherwise provided in this Consent Decree, in any dispute before the \nCourt NYCHA shall bear the burden of demonstrating that its position is consistent with the \nobligations and objectives of the Consent Decree and that accepting its position would better \nfurther the objectives of the Consent Decree than accepting any opposing position. \nXV.  INFORMATION COLLECTION AND RETENTION \n87.  The United States and its representatives, including attorneys, contractors, and \nconsultants, will have continued access to NYCHA data and personnel to the extent necessary (in \nthe United States’ unreviewable discretion) for oversight of implementation of the Consent \nDecree. \n88.  Until one year after the termination of this Consent Decree, NYCHA shall retain, \nand shall instruct its contractors and agents to preserve, all non-identical copies of all documents, \nrecords, or other information (including documents, records, or other information in electronic \nform) that relate in any manner to NYCHA’s performance of its obligations under this Consent \nDecree.   \n89.  At the conclusion of the information-retention period provided in the preceding \nparagraph, NYCHA shall notify the United States at least 90 days prior to the destruction of any \ndocuments, records, or other information subject to the requirements of the preceding paragraph \nand, upon request by the United States, NYCHA shall deliver any such documents, records, or \nother information to the United States.   \n90.  This Consent Decree in no way limits or affects any right of entry and \ninspection, or any right to obtain information, held by the United States (including HUD and \nEPA) pursuant to applicable federal laws, regulations, or permits, nor does it limit or affect any \nduty or obligation of NYCHA to maintain documents, records, or other information imposed by \napplicable federal or state laws, regulations, or permits. \n91.  NYCHA agrees that the United States may retain and use documents and \ninformation produced to it by NYCHA pursuant to Civil Investigative Demand or otherwise in \nthe course of the United States’ investigation of this matter, and in particular waives any \nlimitation on the retention or use of such documents and information contained in 28 U.S.C. \n§ 3733. \n19 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 5-1   Filed 06/11/18   Page 22 of 29\n \nXVI.

PAULEY III, Senior United States District Judge:  \nThe United States of America (the “Government”) moves for approval of a \nproposed consent decree touted by the parties to bring organizational reform to the New York \nCity Housing Authority (“NYCHA”) and correct its systemic violations of federal health and \nsafety regulations.  On September 26, 2018, scores of NYCHA tenants, elected officials, and \nrepresentatives of community organizations appeared for a fairness hearing to assist this Court in \nassessing the proposed decree.  One after another, they rendered harrowing accounts of the \nsqualid conditions in their apartments and the indifference of NYCHA management, called for \nthe firing or prosecution of NYCHA officials, and urged greater tenant participation in the \nnegotiation and enforcement of the proposed consent decree.  Two of these community \norganizations, the City-Wide Council of Presidents and At-Risk Community Services (the \n“Intervenors”), also filed formal opposition briefs.  \nThis human dimension cannot be ignored despite the parties’ attempts to limit the \nCourt to a perfunctory review of the validity and form of the settlement.  For decades, Congress \nhas addressed the importance of ensuring that public housing residents live in decent, safe, and \n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 2 of 52\nsanitary conditions.  Congress vested the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development \n(“HUD”) with broad authority and responsibility to monitor the performance of public housing \nagencies receiving federal funds and to aggressively reform those agencies that misuse them.  \nBut the parties’ proposed decree sidelines HUD and displaces the congressional framework for \nremedying public housing failures with a parallel framework to be managed by the judiciary.  \nAnd aside from general directives to comply with applicable statutes and regulations, the \nproposed decree does not offer any specificity as to NYCHA’s required or enjoined conduct.\nRather, it contemplates the future elaboration of the terms of the injunction through the \ndevelopment of performance requirements and plans.  These performance requirements and \nplans are not subject to this Court’s approval, but will be developed by a monitor, approved by \nthe Government, and subject to judicial review only under an arbitrary and capricious standard. \nBecause the record reveals a substantial basis to conclude that this proposed \ndecree is not fair, reasonable, or consistent with the public interest, the Government’s motion to \napprove the consent decree is denied.\nBACKGROUND \nThis case is about the disastrous human toll resulting from a complete \nbureaucratic breakdown of the largest public housing agency in the United States.  NYCHA’s \nstated mission is to provide safe, decent, and affordable housing for the 400,000 or more low- \nand moderate-income New Yorkers who live in approximately 175,000 apartments in 326 \nhousing developments.  NYCHA’s reported population alone places it within the fifty most \npopulous cities in the Nation.  But NYCHA’s size is paralleled by its organizational disarray in \nproviding any semblance of adequate housing for some of the most vulnerable members of \n2\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 3 of 52\nsociety and its systemic cover-up of a host of fundamental health and safety issues.1  More than \ntwo years ago, the Government began investigating NYCHA’s violations of federal health and \nsafety requirements and its deception of federal regulators as to its compliance with those \nrequirements.  The breathtaking scope of NYCHA’s deficiencies came into public focus through \nthe accretion of media scrutiny, the high-profile departures of some of NYCHA’s top leadership, \nand federal and state court class actions by NYCHA’s own tenants to remedy some of the same \nhousing conditions at issue in this action.   \nOn June 11, 2018, the Government’s investigation culminated in the filing of a \ncomplaint and proposed settlement (the “Complaint” and “Proposed Consent Decree”).  The \nComplaint, which seeks the appointment of a monitor and other injunctive relief, asserts three \nclaims against NYCHA.  First, the Government claims that NYCHA substantially defaulted on \nits covenants and obligations under its “Annual Contributions Contract” with HUD, which \nincorporates federal lead-paint safety regulations and NYCHA’s obligation under 24 C.F.R. \n§ 5.703 to provide “decent, safe, and sanitary housing.”  (Compl., ECF No. 11, ¶¶ 268-271 \n(citing 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(j)(3)).)  Second, it asserts a claim under the federal Anti-Fraud \nInjunction Act to enjoin NYCHA’s ongoing or imminent false statements to federal regulators \nabout its housing conditions and its compliance with federal law in violation of 18 U.S.C. \n§ 1001.  (Compl. ¶¶ 272-276 (citing 18 U.S.C. § 1345).)  Finally, the Government brings a claim \nunder the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 to restrain NYCHA’s failure to comply with \nfederal lead-based paint regulations.  (Compl. ¶¶ 277-282.)   \n                                                           \n1   The plight of one tenant typifies NYCHA’s beadledom.  At the September 26, 2018 hearing, she described \nthe trauma and heartbreak that overwhelmed her every day when she entered and exited the apartment building \nwhere her 16-year-old son was murdered in November 2017.  (See Sept. 26, 2018 Hr’g Tr. at 92-94.)  For more than \nten months, she sought to be transferred to another building without success.  In a personal note postmarked October \n22, 2018, the tenant informed this Court that NYCHA moved her to a new apartment.  (See ECF No. 63.)  While this \nCourt commends NYCHA for acting expediently after the hearing, it should not take a public admonishment from a \nfederal judge to spur NYCHA to perform an act of basic human decency. \n3\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 4 of 52\nBecause the determination of whether the Proposed Consent Decree should be \napproved requires an examination of the terms of the settlement and the claims brought in this \naction, a brief overview is warranted. \nI. The Complaint \nThis action may present the rare instance in which the allegations in the complaint \nare understated.  As the Complaint alleges, and as numerous tenants testified from first-hand \nknowledge, NYCHA’s apartments and buildings are literally falling apart—and NYCHA knows \nit.  In March 2018, the New York State Department of Public Health found that 83% of inspected \nunits contained some condition that could pose a health hazard to tenants.  (Compl. ¶ 161.)  \nSomewhat reminiscent of the biblical plagues of Egypt, these conditions include toxic lead paint, \nasthma-inducing mold, lack of heat, frequent elevator outages, and vermin infestations.   \nA. Lead Paint \nContrary to NYCHA’s public assurances that lead paint was not widely used in \nNYCHA and that the vast majority of its developments did not have lead paint, the Government \nalleges that NYCHA’s own documents reveal that more than half of NYCHA’s developments \ncontain lead paint somewhere.  (Compl. ¶¶ 54-56.)  At minimum, NYCHA’s assertions indicate \nthat roughly 51,000 apartments in at least 1,200 buildings in at least 92 developments have lead \npaint on their walls, floors, ceilings, windows, doors, radiators, or pipes.2  (Compl. ¶¶ 54, 57.)  \nApproximately 173,000 residents, of which 11,500 are children under 6, live in these 92 \ndevelopments.  (Compl. ¶ 57.)  But these numbers are only the tip of the iceberg—City and New \nYork State health inspections have identified lead paint in developments that NYCHA previously \n                                                           \n2   As of October 30, 2018, NYCHA’s estimate of apartments to be inspected for lead paint increased to \n140,000 of its 175,000 apartments, as reported by the media.  See Greg B. Smith, Oops! NYCHA suddenly \ndiscovers 10,000 more lead-paint apartments it needs to inspect, N.Y. Daily News (Oct. 30, 2018), \nhttp://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-metro-nycha-lead-paint-more-apartments-20181030-story.html.  \n4\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 5 of 52\ndeclared to be lead free.  (Compl. ¶ 56.) \nDespite the prevalence of lead paint in NYCHA’s apartments, NYCHA \ninexplicably failed to conduct required inspections and evaluations for years.  For instance, \nNYCHA conducted less than 25% of the biennial risk assessment evaluations it should have \nconducted in the 92 developments with lead paint between 2010 and 2017.  (Compl. ¶ 60.)  For \n50 of these 92 developments, NYCHA failed to conduct a single evaluation during that period.\n(Compl. ¶ 60.)  NYCHA’s senior management knew that these evaluations were not being \nconducted as early as 2011.  (Compl. ¶ 95.)  Even where NYCHA found a child with elevated \nblood lead levels who lived in a development previously determined to be lead free, it still—in \ndefiance of all common sense—did not conduct risk assessments of that development.  (Compl. \n¶¶ 78-79.)  Further, NYCHA simply stopped performing legally required annual visual \nassessments for lead paint hazards in 2012.  (Compl. ¶¶ 64-67.)   NYCHA’s senior management \nallegedly knew that these assessments were not being conducted as early as 2013.  (Compl. \n¶ 96.)  Although NYCHA partially restarted inspections in May 2016, the 4,000 visual \nassessments it conducted generated 3,900 work orders to abate lead paint hazards.  (Compl. \n¶¶ 66-67.)  When extrapolated, this rate of work orders underscores the prevalence of lead paint \nhazards in NYCHA housing.  (See Compl. ¶ 68 (alleging that more than 80% of the 9,000 \napartments inspected in 2017 contained potential lead paint hazards).)  And when NYCHA did \nperform maintenance work, the majority of that work was performed by employees who did not \nhave proper training in lead-safe work practices and did not safely abate lead paint hazards.  \n(Compl. ¶¶ 70-75, 80.)  This, too, was known to NYCHA’s management.  (Compl. ¶¶ 99-100.) \nImportantly, these statistics underscore the tangible impact of NYCHA’s apathy \non residents.  Lead is toxic to all humans.  (Compl. ¶¶ 31-32.)  Even small amounts of lead may \n5\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 6 of 52\nlead to cancer, hypertension, kidney failure, and other serious health conditions.  (Compl. ¶ 32.)  \nYoung children who unwittingly ingest even small amounts of lead paint flakes and lead dust \nmay suffer irreversible neurological problems.3  (Compl. ¶ 32.)  The Government alleges that \nbetween 2010 and 2016, the City’s Department of Health confirmed that at least 19 children had \nelevated blood lead levels while living in lead-riddled apartments.  (Compl. ¶¶ 82-85.)  Despite \nsenior management’s knowledge, NYCHA refused to provide any information or report these \ncases to HUD.  (Compl. ¶¶ 76-77, 101.)  Moreover, as the Complaint alleges, this number \nmassively understates the actual number of children afflicted with elevated blood lead levels for \nat least two reasons.4  (See Compl. ¶ 82.)  First, NYCHA employed an obstructionist and \ncounterintuitive policy of immediately contesting every order by the Department of Health to \nabate lead paint following an inspection.  (Compl. ¶ 85.)  These challenges often resulted in the \nDepartment of Health’s retraction of findings of lead paint and withdrawal of abatement orders, \nrendering under-counting all but certain.  (Compl. ¶¶ 84-87.)  Second, only a subset of children \nfor whom exposure to lead paint could cause deleterious health effects were tested for elevated \nblood lead levels.  (Compl. ¶ 88.)  As a NYCHA spokesperson intimated in a July 29, 2017 press \nrelease, even one child with elevated lead levels is one too many.   \nB. Mold, Heat, Elevators, and Vermin \nEndemic mold, insufficient heat during the wintertime, broken elevators, and \n                                                           \n3   A recent policy statement published by the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Council on Environmental \nHealth confirms that there is no safe level of lead in blood and that even blood lead concentrations below 5 μg/dL \n(50 ppb) are “a causal risk factor for diminished intellectual and academic abilities, higher rates of neurobehavioral \ndisorders,” and lower birth weight in children.  The authors also note that no effective treatments exist to \n“ameliorate the permanent developmental effects of lead toxicity.”  Bruce Perrin Lanphear, et al., Prevention of \nChildhood Lead Toxicity, 138 Pediatrics, no. 1, 2016, at 1.   \n4   The City later revealed that since 2012, a total of 1,160 children under the age of 18 living in NYCHA \nhousing had elevated blood lead levels.  See Luis Ferré-Sadurní, Little Decline in Number of Children in Public \nHousing With High Lead Levels, Report Says, N.Y. Times (Aug. 30, 2018), https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/ \nnyregion/nyc-public-housing-lead.html.  \n6\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 7 of 52\ninfestations of rats, mice, and cockroaches are also a part of daily life for NYCHA tenants.5\n(Compl. ¶¶ 159-160.)  Between 2013 and 2016, for example, NYCHA tenants made between \n18,000 and 28,000 complaints about mold growth every year.  (Compl. ¶ 164.)  During that same \nperiod, tenants lodged between 117,000 and 146,000 complaints each year about flooding and \nleaks, which contribute to mold growth.  (Compl. ¶ 166.)  These annual numbers of complaints \nare increasing.  (Compl. ¶¶ 164, 166.)  And even where NYCHA claims to have addressed mold, \nit reoccurs 30% of the time.6  (Compl. ¶¶ 171, 176.)  Similarly, the 825,000 heating complaints \nthat NYCHA’s tenants made between 2011 and 2016 bear testament to its widespread and \npersistent inability to provide sufficient heat during frigid New York winters.  (Compl. ¶¶ 177-\n186.)  For example, during the winter of 2015-2016, roughly 43,000 residents made over \n155,000 complaints of insufficient heat.  (Compl. ¶ 181.)  Two years later, more than 323,000 \nresidents—or over 80% of NYCHA’s population—suffered heating outages lasting an average of \n48 hours.7  (Compl. ¶ 183.)   \nAs for NYCHA’s elevators, the Government alleges that NYCHA experienced an \naverage of 94 outages per elevator between 2011 and 2016.  (Compl. ¶ 188.)  In 2016, nearly \n                                                           \n5   These conditions do not tell the whole story.  For instance, the Complaint also alleges that NYCHA failed \nto inspect smoke and carbon monoxide detectors in its apartments and that the majority of NYCHA’s playgrounds \nwere found to contain hazardous conditions.  (Compl. ¶ 161.)  At the September 26, 2018 hearing, a representative \nof the New York Environmental Law & Justice Project described how arsenic from the City Department of Health’s \nrat-control efforts, along with lead, contaminates the soil around NYCHA buildings at the Governor Alfred E. Smith \nHouses just one block from the Daniel Patrick Moynihan U.S. Courthouse.  He testified that the children were \nmoved to an adjacent playground in which the City’s Department of Parks & Recreation was observed using Round-\nUp to kill weeds, which itself becomes more toxic when combined with heavy metals.  (Sept. 26, 2018 Hr’g Tr. at \n118-19.) \n6   Many of these issues are the subject of a 2013 class action brought by NYCHA tenants suffering from \nasthma as a result of mold and excessive moisture in their apartments.  See Baez v. N.Y.C. Hous. Auth., 2015 WL \n9809872 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 15, 2015). \n7   Media outlets recently reported that 35,475 tenants have already endured insufficient heat or hot water \nsince October 18, 2018—and winter has not yet arrived.  See, e.g., Yoav Gonen & Georgett Roberts, Over 35K \nNYCHA residents are suffering without heat, hot water, N.Y. Post (Oct. 24, 2018), https://nypost.com/2018/10/24/ \nover-35k-nycha-residents-are-suffering-without-heat-hot-water.   \n7\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 8 of 52\n70% of buildings with at least one elevator had no working elevators at some time—an \noccurrence apparently so common that NYCHA refers to it by the colloquialism “double-\nheader.”  (Compl. ¶¶ 190, 193.)  Finally, cockroaches, mice, and rats are legion in NYCHA \nhousing.  Between 2010 and 2016, NYCHA tenants lodged over 280,000 complaints about \ncockroaches, more than 130,000 complaints about mice, and almost 15,000 complaints about \nrats—numbers that are also increasing.  (Compl. ¶¶ 200, 202.)   \nThese statistics, while helpful in understanding the scope of NYCHA’s failures, \nare given meaning by the toll that these physical conditions take on NYCHA residents.  Mold \nmay release toxins and allergens correlated with respiratory problems, contributing to NYCHA \nresidents’ disproportionate rate of asthma hospitalizations and forcing tenants to remove sheets \nof mold themselves.  (Compl. ¶¶ 165, 172.)  Frigid apartments give tenants no choice but to \nleave their stoves and ovens on all night for heat.  (Compl. ¶ 184.)  Broken elevators trap \nresidents for hours, put the elderly and disabled to the dilemma of waiting in lobbies or \nclambering up flights of stairs, and tragically, sometimes kill NYCHA residents.  (Compl. \n¶¶ 191-197.)  And plainly, pests can carry disease, exacerbate respiratory conditions, and \ncontaminate food and water.  (Compl. ¶ 203.)  While aware of these conditions, NYCHA ignored \ntenant complaints or only nominally addressed them because of incompetence or apathy.  (See \nCompl. ¶¶ 166-168, 175-176 (describing NYCHA’s closing of mold work orders without \nremediation); Compl. ¶ 186 (alleging NYCHA management’s awareness of insufficient heat); \nCompl. ¶¶ 192-195 (alleging NYCHA’s management’s awareness of broken elevators); Compl. \n¶¶ 204-210, 212-214 (detailing NYCHA’s practices of arbitrarily closing out work orders or \nfaking exterminations by spraying water).)   \n8\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 9 of 52\nC. NYCHA’s Deception \nThe Complaint alleges more than NYCHA’s callous indifference to the well-\nbeing of its tenants, but that it whitewashed these deficiencies for years.  According to the \nGovernment, NYCHA’s deception was entrenched within its culture, from top-level management \ndownward.  In March 2016, for example, NYCHA’s Chair testified before the New York City \nCouncil that NYCHA regularly performed visual assessments of lead paint as legally required.  \n(Compl. ¶ 111.)  Despite learning in April 2016 that NYCHA did not perform these visual \nassessments, NYCHA’s Chair did nothing.  (Compl. ¶ 97.)  The false testimony by NYCHA’s \nChair is emblematic of NYCHA’s pattern of deceiving anyone who it needed to falsely assure, \nwhether it be elected officials, NYCHA’s tenants, the general public, or HUD.  (See Compl. \n¶¶ 103-117.)  Indeed, between 2010 and 2016, NYCHA falsely certified its compliance with \nHUD’s lead-paint safety regulations and its obligation to provide “decent, safe, and sanitary” \nhousing in certifications submitted to HUD, amendments to its Annual Contributions Contract \nwith HUD, and in drawing down operating funds provided by HUD.  (Compl. ¶¶ 92, 241-264.)    \nNYCHA also lied to HUD and the public to allay concerns over a work order \nbacklog spinning out of control.  Between 2010 and 2012, NYCHA faced mounting pressure \nfrom HUD and criticism from the media to address its backlog of 400,000 work orders, which \nthe media blamed as the source of NYCHA’s decaying apartments.  (Compl. ¶¶ 215-220.)  As of \nAugust 2012, NYCHA was on pace to exceed the 170,000 work orders that its 2011 inspections \nhad generated.  (Compl. ¶ 221.)  Thus, it sought to engineer a backlog reduction.  First, it \nsuspended annual inspections between August 2012 and the summer of 2014.  (Compl. ¶¶ 221-\n228.)  Even though some of its executives expressed misgivings that a lengthy moratorium on \ninspections would run afoul of its obligations under the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, those \n9\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 10 of 52\nconcerns went unaddressed.  (Compl. ¶ 225.)  This scheme allowed NYCHA to move 200,000 \nwork orders off its books during the suspension.  (Compl. ¶ 226.)  Second, in February 2013, \nNYCHA revived a policy allowing staff to close work orders by reporting that the tenant was not \nhome.  (Compl. ¶¶ 233-235.)  NYCHA’s executives explicitly made this change to reduce the \nnumber of open work orders, which allowed them to close another 200,000 work orders in 2013.\n(Compl. ¶¶ 233-234.)  Nonetheless, NYCHA triumphantly—but falsely—claimed to HUD and \nthe public that it reduced its backlog based on initiatives to improve efficiency and productivity.\n(Compl. ¶¶ 229-232, 236-240.) \nFinally, NYCHA sought to game HUD’s public housing inspection system in \norder to avoid the additional scrutiny that came with low inspection scores, including more \nfrequent inspections, corrective action plans, and the potential of a federal receivership.  (See \nCompl. ¶¶ 121-132.)  These inspections evaluate four “indicators” of a public housing agency’s \nperformance—physical conditions, financial condition, management, and capital funding.  See \n24 C.F.R. part 902 subpart A.  A public housing agency receives an overall score, as well as \nseparate scores for each indicator.  24 C.F.R. §§ 902.9, 902.11.  In stark contrast to its lethargic \nattitude when it came to the health and safety of its tenants, NYCHA approached its inflation of \nHUD inspection scores with tactical precision and a take-no-prisoners approach.  (See Compl. \n¶ 156.)\nOn the eve of inspections, NYCHA transformed its developments into veritable \nPotemkin villages.  The Complaint alleges that NYCHA’s management circulated dossiers on \nindividual inspectors so that its staff could identify and patch over specific conditions that certain \ninspectors were known to scrutinize.  (Compl. ¶¶ 133-135.)  And during inspections, NYCHA \nstaff raced ahead of inspectors to address any unforeseen deficiencies.  (Compl. ¶¶ 153-155.)  \n10\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 11 of 52\nNYCHA also employed a panoply of stratagems designed to temporarily conceal the crumbling \nphysical conditions of its housing.  These practices, which NYCHA’s management knew about \nor actively directed, included (1) temporarily shutting off a building’s water supply to hide water \nleaks; (2) plugging holes in walls and ceilings with newspaper and cork before painting over the \nhole; (3) building fake walls to conceal broken doors and dilapidated rooms; (4) locking doors \nand posting “danger” signs to keep inspectors away from rooms with dangerous or unsanitary \nconditions; and (5) hiding improperly stored hazardous materials.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 137-148.)  \nRemarkably, NYCHA indoctrinated its staff in these deceptive tactics through internal \nguidelines, including the decade-long distribution of a “Quick Fix Tips” guide on how to conceal \nproblematic conditions from HUD inspectors.  (Compl. ¶¶ 149-152.)     \nII. The Proposed Consent Decree \nThe Proposed Consent Decree is the product of months of negotiations among the \nGovernment, NYCHA, and the City of New York,8 all of whom are signatories to the agreement.  \nIn broad strokes, the proposed decree contains factual admissions by NYCHA, provisions \nregarding the selection of a monitor and the monitor’s powers and responsibilities, provisions for \nfunding by the City, and provisions for injunctive relief. \nA. Factual Admissions \nUnder the Proposed Consent Decree, NYCHA admits that between 2010 and \n2016, it falsely certified its compliance with federal statutory and regulatory requirements— \nincluding those relating to lead paint safety—to HUD.  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶ 7(a)-(c).)\nNYCHA also admits that its inspections revealed that lead paint exists on the premises of more \nthan half of its developments, including in the apartments of 92 developments.  (Proposed \n                                                           \n8   While the City is a signatory to the Proposed Consent Decree, the Government did not name it as a \ndefendant in the action. \n11\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 12 of 52\nConsent Decree ¶ 7(d).)  These admissions also indicate that in the first half of this decade, \nNYCHA failed to conduct legally required lead paint risk assessment evaluations or visual \nassessments, failed to ensure that its staff use lead-safe work practices, and failed to provide \nHUD with any information regarding children living in NYCHA developments found to have \nelevated blood lead levels.  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶ 7(e)-(h).) \nSimilarly, NYCHA makes admissions regarding many of the appalling conditions \nof its apartments.  These include 300 cases between 2014 and 2016 in which NYCHA staff \nverified mold growth covering more than 100 square feet and a mold reoccurrence rate \nexceeding 30%; 825,000 complaints of insufficient heat between 2011 and 2016; the loss of heat \nfor 80% of NYCHA’s residents during the winter of 2017-2018; the majority of NYCHA \nelevator buildings experiencing at least one period with no functioning elevators in 2016; and \nmore than 260,000 work orders for roaches, more than 90,000 work orders for mice, and nearly \n36,000 work orders for rats between 2013 and 2016.  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶ 7(i)-(q).)  And \ndespite these conditions, NYCHA admits that it reported to HUD between 2012 and 2013 that it \nhad made significant progress in reducing its work order backlog, while obscuring the fact that it \ngenerated substantially fewer work orders by suspending annual inspections.  (Proposed Consent \nDecree ¶ 7(r).)  Finally, the Proposed Consent Decree contains admissions that NYCHA \nartificially inflated its HUD inspection scores, including through its distribution of a list of \n“Quick Fix Tips” to deceive HUD inspectors.  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶ 7(s)-(u).)\nB. Monitor Provisions \nThe Government characterizes the monitorship as the “centerpiece” of the \nProposed Consent Decree.  Even though the Government suggests that the direction NYCHA’s \nobligations may take will depend on who the monitor is, it still—more than five months after \n12\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 13 of 52\nfiling the proposed decree—has not identified any candidate who it might nominate to be the \nmonitor.  (See July 10, 2018 Hr’g Tr. at 8 (statement by Government counsel that applicants for \nmonitor may “have different ideas and structures for what they would bring to that process”).)\nThus, this Court’s evaluation of whether the Proposed Consent Decree should be approved must \nnecessarily occur with incomplete knowledge of its key monitorship component.9\nIn any event, the monitor will be proposed by the Government in consultation \nwith the City and NYCHA and—at the Government’s discretion—with stakeholders such as \nNew York State, the New York City Council, the City-Wide Council of Presidents, and other \ntenant groups.  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶ 15.)  The monitor is subject to this Court’s \nsupervision as an officer of the court.  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶ 40.)  NYCHA bears the \nburden of paying “all reasonable fees and costs” of the monitor.  (Proposed Consent Decree \n¶ 53.)  The proposed decree provides no cap on the costs of the proposed monitorship, and the \nGovernment could not offer any estimate, recognizing only that “it will be a substantial amount \nof money” that “is hard to estimate until the monitor is in place.”  (See July 10, 2018 Hr’g Tr. at \n8-9.)\nUltimately, the monitor’s purpose is to “ensure that NYCHA (1) complies with all \nLead Paint Laws, (2) provides housing that is decent, safe, sanitary, and in good repair, . . . (3) \ndoes not make false or misleading statements to the United States, and (4) implements the terms \nof the Consent Decree.”  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶ 14.)  To that end, the Proposed Consent \nDecree requires the monitor to ensure that NYCHA complies with federal, state, and local lead \n                                                           \n9   The same day that this Court issued an order scheduling a status conference for July 10, 2018, the U.S. \nAttorney’s Office announced its NYCHA monitor application process and fixed July 11, 2018 as the deadline for \nmonitor applications to be received.  At the July 10, 2018 conference, this Court scheduled a fairness hearing for \nSeptember 26, 2018.  The following day, the Government extended the monitor application deadline to September \n12, 2018.  On September 12, 2018, the Government again extended the time to submit a monitor application—this \ntime, to the date this Court approves the Proposed Consent Decree.     \n13\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 14 of 52\npaint laws, including EPA and HUD regulations relating to lead-paint inspections, work \npractices, and disclosures.  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶ 18(a).)  Similarly, the monitor must \nensure that NYCHA complies with HUD health and safety standards relating to mold, heating, \nelevators, and pests.  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶ 18(b)-(e).)  To address NYCHA’s false or \nmisleading statements to federal regulators, the Proposed Consent Decree requires NYCHA to \nconsult with the monitor to create a Compliance Department, a Quality Assurance Department, \nand an Environmental Health and Safety Department.  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶¶ 18(g), 63-\n65.)\nThe Proposed Consent Decree contemplates the future development and \nimplementation of frameworks to assist NYCHA in achieving compliance with the requirements \nset forth in paragraph 18(b)-(f).  Performance Requirements are “objective quantitative \nbenchmarks” to be developed by the monitor, in consultation with NYCHA and the City, and \napproved by the Government.  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶¶ 13(p), 23.)  After a Performance \nRequirement becomes effective, NYCHA and the monitor must prepare an Action Plan that \nincludes “specific actions” to bring NYCHA into compliance with the Performance Requirement \nand paragraph 18’s mandates, “a date certain” to satisfy those requirements, and “interim \nmilestones with specific completion dates.”  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶ 27.)  Action Plans may \nalso provide for policies, procedures, systems, or structures for NYCHA to adopt to comply with \nthe decree.  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶ 34.)  Apart from Action Plans, NYCHA must also work \nwith the monitor to develop an Operational Plan that “clearly delineat[es]” the respective spheres \nof NYCHA’s Chair, General Manager, and Board, as well as an Organizational Plan directed \ntoward implementing changes to NYCHA’s structure.  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶¶ 28, 29.)   \nTo assist in achieving the goals of the monitorship, the Proposed Consent Decree \n14\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 15 of 52\npermits the monitor full access to NYCHA’s documents, data, and other information.  (Proposed \nConsent Decree ¶ 19.)  The decree also grants the monitor full access to NYCHA’s services, \nprograms, facilities, and premises.  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶ 19.)  Additionally, the monitor \nmay communicate with NYCHA’s personnel without any prior notice to or permission by \nNYCHA.  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶ 20.)  The monitor may also engage any third parties at its \ndiscretion to assist in performing its responsibilities.  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶ 17.)  Finally, \nthe monitor may seek “extraordinary relief” from this Court, “including the authority to enter \ninto contracts on NYCHA’s behalf,” upon a showing of “compelling evidence” that NYCHA’s \ninability to comply with an Action Plan frustrates the purpose of the proposed decree.  (Proposed \nConsent Decree ¶ 37.)   \nEvaluation of the monitor and NYCHA’s progress occurs through reporting and \nfeedback mechanisms.  The monitor must submit a quarterly report to the Government, NYCHA, \nand this Court setting forth the work performed by the monitor and NYCHA’s progress and \ncompliance.  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶¶ 41-44.)  After the Proposed Consent Decree has been \nin place for five years, these periodic reports must also assess whether NYCHA meets the \nrequirements for termination of the decree.  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶¶ 43, 97.)  Separately, \nNYCHA community leaders and representatives may provide feedback through a Community \nAdvisory Committee that meets at least twice a year to discuss the achievement of the \nmonitorship’s purposes and to advise the monitor on the prioritization of projects.  (Proposed \nConsent Decree ¶ 21.)  Outside of the Community Advisory Committee, the monitor must also \nformulate procedures through which residents and other NYCHA stakeholders may provide \ninput.  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶ 22.)\n15\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 16 of 52\nC. Funding\nTo assist NYCHA in complying with the Proposed Consent Decree and the to-be-\ndetermined Performance Requirements and plans, the City commits to providing almost $3 \nbillion in previously budgeted capital and expense funding, as well as an additional $1 billion in \ncapital funding over the next four years and $200 million in capital funding each subsequent \nyear.10  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶ 54.)  If the City fails to furnish the capital funds during the \nperiod prescribed in paragraph 54, those funding obligations will be carried over to the next \nfiscal year.  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶ 57.)  Similarly, capital funds that NYCHA fails to \nspend will be “carried over and added to each subsequent fiscal year until spent.”  (Proposed \nConsent Decree ¶ 57.)  Unbelievably, despite NYCHA’s $31.8 billion capital needs deficit and \nits widely publicized heating crisis last winter,11 the Government attests that NYCHA already \nleft unspent roughly $377 million of the $483 million in capital funding provided by the City for \nfiscal year 2018, which will be carried over into fiscal year 2019.  (Declaration of Monica P. \nFolch in Support of the United States’ Motion to Enter the Proposed Consent Decree, ECF No. \n45 (“Folch Decl.”), ¶ 3.)\nThese funding provisions are somewhat malleable.  With respect to the City’s \nfunding obligations, the City retains the option to authorize additional capital or expense \n                                                           \n10   While these sums are not insignificant, they pale in comparison to NYCHA’s estimated $31.8 billion in \nunmet capital needs.  To put such a lofty figure in more understandable terms, NYCHA’s capital needs amount to an \nexpenditure of over $180,000 per apartment.  But even assuming that the proposed decree lasts through fiscal year \n2027 (the final year for which the City had previously allocated capital funding), the City’s funding would only \ncover roughly $23,000 of each apartment’s unmet capital needs.  At the rate of the City’s funding obligation—which \nis the only committed source of capital funds in the Proposed Consent Decree—NYCHA’s current capital needs \nwould not be met until the year 2166.  This estimate also assumes that NYCHA’s housing stock will not deteriorate \nfurther over the next 148 years.    \n11   On October 18, 2018, the Mayor announced that boilers in twelve NYCHA developments had been \nreplaced since last winter and that NYCHA was ready to deploy five mobile boilers for heating emergencies.  This \nCourt wonders how many other boilers could have been replaced if NYCHA had committed some of the $377 \nmillion it left on the table. \n16\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 17 of 52\nspending to NYCHA, although the City’s counsel confirmed that the City had no plans to \nallocate additional funding at present.  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶ 60; Sept. 26, 2018 Hr’g Tr. \nat 188.)  However, the Proposed Consent Decree also sets forth procedures for the City to delay \nor be relieved by this Court of its funding obligations in the event of undue financial hardship \nthat renders it unable to pay some or all of the amounts prescribed in paragraph 54.  (Proposed \nConsent Decree ¶¶ 61-62.)  Moreover, the proposed decree notes that $550 million in state \nresources “may be available,”12 in addition to ongoing operating and capital funds from HUD, \nwhich will not be offset by the amount that NYCHA is slated to receive from the City.13\n(Proposed Consent Decree ¶¶ 38, 52; see Compl. ¶ 18 (alleging that roughly $900 million of \nNYCHA’s operating budget comes from HUD and that HUD provides over $300 million per \nyear in capital funding).)\nD. Injunctive Relief \nThe Proposed Consent Decree requires NYCHA to take certain specified actions \nwithout waiting for the effective date of the proposed decree, the appointment of a monitor, or \nthe issuance of an Action Plan.  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶ 66.)  For instance, NYCHA must \ncomply with HUD and EPA regulations relating to lead-safe work practices and abatement.  \n(Proposed Consent Decree ¶ 67.)  Under the Proposed Consent Decree, NYCHA must also take \nsteps to notify residents of lead paint to which they may be exposed.  In particular, NYCHA \nmust notify residents if their apartments or common areas in their buildings have been identified \n                                                           \n12   Of course, this observation says nothing about whether these funds will in fact be released, and the State of \nNew York is not a signatory bound by the proposed decree.  The parties’ agreement that the $550 million in state \nresources “are important to the success of [the Proposed Consent Decree]” is similarly aspirational.  (Proposed \nConsent Decree ¶ 38.)      \n13   The City expressed concern that HUD might reduce its capital funding contribution to NYCHA if HUD \nincluded the City’s funding under the Proposed Consent Decree in its funding formula.  This “very technical” \nprovision was included to ensure that HUD could not do so.  (Sept. 26, 2018 Hr’g Tr. at 200-01.) \n17\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 18 of 52\nas containing lead paint no later than November 8, 2018—or if a child under 6 resides in such an \napartment, no later than September 9, 2018.  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶ 68.)  Finally, NYCHA \nmust keep at each development’s management office physical copies of all materials required to \nbe disclosed by HUD and EPA’s lead-disclosure regulations.  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶ 69.)\nThose materials must be present and available for inspection no later than October 9, 2018 and \nmust be sent to each resident no later than December 8, 2018.  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶ 69.)  \nTo date, this Court has not received any update from the parties as to whether NYCHA has \ncomplied with the obligations for which the proposed decree sets a specific deadline. \nDISCUSSION \nThe Second Circuit recognizes a “strong federal policy favoring the approval and \nenforcement of consent decrees.”  SEC v. Citigroup Glob. Mkts., Inc., 752 F.3d 285, 292 (2d Cir. \n2014) (citation and quotation marks omitted).  A district court only “has the power to enter or \nreject such a judgment, not to alter it.”  SEC v. Petro-Suisse Ltd., 2013 WL 5348595, at *3 \n(S.D.N.Y. Sept. 25, 2013).  Although a district court is not merely a “rubber stamp” for a \ngovernment agency seeking the entry of a consent decree, see Citigroup, 752 F.3d at 293, its \nreview of a proposed consent decree is—for better or worse—more deferential in the context of a \ngovernment enforcement action, see SEC v. Caledonian Bank Ltd., 317 F.R.D. 358, 374 n.15 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2016) (citing SEC v. Citigroup Glob. Mkts. Inc., 34 F. Supp. 3d 379, 380-81 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2014)). \nThe “proper standard for reviewing a proposed consent judgment involving an \nenforcement agency requires that the district court determine whether the proposed consent \ndecree is fair and reasonable, with the additional requirement that the ‘public interest would not \nbe disserved,’ in the event that the consent decree includes injunctive relief.”  Citigroup, 752 \n18\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 19 of 52\nF.3d at 294 (internal citations omitted).  Absent a “substantial basis in the record” to conclude \nthat the consent decree is not fair and reasonable or that the public interest would be disserved, \n“the district court is required to enter the order,” irrespective of the adequacy of the consent \ndecree.  Citigroup, 752 F.3d at 294.  While this deferential standard arose in the context of an \nSEC enforcement action, courts in this circuit have since extended it to other government \nenforcement contexts.  See, e.g., U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v. Deutsche Bank \nAG, 2016 WL 6135664, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 20, 2016); United States v. Int’l Bus. Machs. \nCorp., 2014 WL 3057960, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. July 7, 2014).\nBut two aspects of this action cast doubt over whether Citigroup ought to apply \nhere.  The first aspect relates to the nature of the claims asserted by the Government.  Certainly, \nan action on behalf of the EPA to address violations of the Toxic Substances Control Act falls \nwithin the Government’s enforcement purview.  See, e.g., United States v. Accolade Constr. \nGrp., Inc., 2017 WL 2271462, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. May 23, 2017) (citing 15 U.S.C. § 2601 et seq.).  \nBut whether actions brought under the Anti-Fraud Injunction Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1345 or the U.S. \nHousing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(j) are properly characterized as government enforcement \nactions within Citigroup’s ambit is a thornier question.14  In particular, 18 U.S.C. § 1345 simply \nprovides a procedural vehicle for the Government to enjoin substantive violations of enumerated \nfederal fraud statutes or restrain the fruits of such violations during the pendency of a criminal \nprosecution.  See 18 U.S.C. § 1345.  The legislative history corroborates the procedural nature of \n§ 1345 as allowing “the Attorney General to put a speedy end to a fraud scheme by seeking an \n                                                           \n14   This action also raises the issue of Citigroup’s applicability to a proposed consent decree that purports to \nresolve an action that asserts prototypical government enforcement claims and other claims that do not fit the typical \ngovernment enforcement model.  Nonetheless, this Court need not wade into these uncertain waters because its \ndecision is binary—it only has the power to enter or reject the Proposed Consent Decree.  See Petro-Suisse Ltd., \n2013 WL 5348595, at *3. \n19\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 20 of 52\ninjunction in federal district court” based on Congress’ concern that “innocent people” may \ncontinue to be victimized during the pendency of an investigation of a fraudulent scheme before \nthe case is ready for prosecution, which “often takes months, if not years.”  See S. Rep. No. 98-\n225, at 401-02 (1984), as reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3539-40.\nLikewise, the Government’s “claim” under § 1437d(j)(3) arguably falls outside \nthe archetypical government enforcement framework.  In that paradigm, a statutory regime (such \nas the Toxic Substances Control Act or the federal securities laws) proscribes certain conduct \nand prescribes penalties and remedies to punish and address statutory violations.  Cf. Nat’l Res. \nDef. Council, Inc. v. FDA, 760 F.3d 51, 168 (2d Cir. 2014) (describing the “traditional model of \nadministrative or judicial enforcement” as featuring “an investigation by executive or \nadministrative personnel, followed by the issuance of a case-initiating document that sets forth \nthe conclusions or charges reached by the prosecuting authority,” followed by an administrative \nhearing or lawsuit that results in an adjudication by the agency or a court that leads to the \nimposition of remedies and penalties).  By contrast, § 1437d(j) merely enumerates various \nadministrative remedies that HUD may employ to remedy a public housing agency’s “substantial \ndefault.”  See 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(j)(3).  Put differently, 18 U.S.C. § 1345 and 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1437d(j) do not directly govern the conduct of the enforced party, but set forth procedures \naddressed to the enforcing authority.\nThe second aspect relates to the broader nature of this action.  In particular, \nCitigroup’s focus on judicial deference to a government agency’s consent decree is somewhat in \ntension with a court’s quasi-managerial role in implementing a consent decree to reform a state \nor local institution. See Thompson v. U.S. Dep’t of Housing & Urban Dev., 404 F.3d 821, 827 \n(4th Cir. 2005) (citing Navarro-Ayala v. Hernandez-Colon, 951 F.2d 1325, 1338 (1st Cir. 1991)) \n20\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 21 of 52\n(observing that “[i]n overseeing broad institutional reform litigation, the district court becomes in \nmany ways more like a manager or policy planner than a judge”); Angela R. ex rel. Hesselbein v. \nClinton, 999 F.2d 320, 326 (8th Cir. 1993) (recognizing that the entry of such a consent decree \n“is often only the beginning of extended judicial involvement”).  The role of the court in these \nso-called “institutional reform” cases typically entails ordering broad relief to remedy the legal \nviolations of an institution, which unavoidably requires a court to grapple with policy \nconsiderations.  By contrast, a court’s role in the Citigroup context is constrained to ensuring the \nlegal and procedural propriety of the proposed decree in deference to the government agency’s \nexercise of discretion—such as the SEC’s decision to settle with a private party for a certain sum \nof money.  Nonetheless, because neither the parties nor Intervenors disputes Citigroup’s \napplicability or articulates another standard that should apply, this Court assumes that Citigroup \ngoverns.\nI. Fairness and Reasonableness\nIn reviewing a government agency’s consent decree for fairness and \nreasonableness, a court should at minimum “assess (1) the basic legality of the decree; (2) \nwhether the terms of the decree, including its enforcement mechanism, are clear; (3) whether the \nconsent decree reflects a resolution of the actual claims in the complaint; and (4) whether the \nconsent decree is tainted by improper collusion or corruption of some kind.”  Citigroup, 752 F.3d \nat 294-95 (internal citations omitted).  Though the Second Circuit recognized without providing \nfurther guidance that a district court “may need to make additional inquiry to ensure that the \nconsent decree is fair and reasonable” depending on the decree, the “primary focus of the inquiry \n. . . should be on ensuring the consent decree is procedurally proper, using objective measures \nsimilar to the factors set out above, taking care not to infringe on the [agency’s] discretionary \n21\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 22 of 52\nauthority to settle on a particular set of terms.”  Citigroup, 752 F.3d at 295.  \nA. Basic Legality\nA proposed consent decree is legal “so long as it is within the Court’s authority to \nenter the decree and within the Plaintiff’s authority to enforce it.”  Caledonian Bank, 317 F.R.D. \nat 370 (quotation marks omitted).  For instance, a proposed consent decree may not satisfy the \nbasic legality requirement if a statute prohibits its entry in the absence of statutorily required \nfindings.  See Citigroup, 752 F.3d at 294-95 (citing Benjamin v. Jacobsen, 172 F.3d 144, 158 (2d \nCir. 1999) (en banc) (discussing the Prison Litigation Reform Act’s need-narrowness-\nintrusiveness requirement for prospective relief)).  Indeed, courts in this circuit analyzing this \nfactor have looked to whether the relevant statutes under which the action was brought permit \nthe relief requested in the consent decree. E.g., Caledonian Bank, 317 F.R.D. at 370 (examining \nwhether the proposed decree’s injunctive relief and disgorgement provisions fell within the \nSEC’s authority under the federal securities laws); Int’l Bus. Machs., 2014 WL 3057960, at *2 \n(determining whether the provisions for IBM’s reimbursement of “response costs” incurred by \nthe EPA and IBM’s agreement to take future remedial action comported with CERCLA).   \nHere, the Government’s legality argument posits that while the statutes under \nwhich this action was brought do not explicitly authorize a monitor, a court may do so in its \nbroad equitable discretion because those statutes authorize equitable relief.  But such a labored \nargument is unnecessary.  Certainly, “[t]he power of the federal courts to appoint special masters \nto monitor compliance with their remedial orders is well established.”  City of N.Y. v. Mickalis \nPawn Shop, LLC, 645 F.3d 114, 145 (2d Cir. 2011) (citation omitted); see, e.g., United States v. \nApple, 992 F. Supp. 2d 963, 280 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (collecting cases). This uncontroversial \nprecept is beside the point, however, because the relief is not the monitor in the first instance, but \n22\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 23 of 52\nthe remedial action that this Court requires NYCHA—the enjoined defendant—to take. \nWhile not entirely clear, a generous read of the Proposed Consent Decree \nsuggests the following essential provisions: (1) a requirement that NYCHA comply with federal, \nstate, and local lead paint statutes and regulations, (Proposed Consent Decree ¶ 18(a)); (2) a \nrequirement that NYCHA comply with federal regulations requiring HUD housing to be decent, \nsafe, sanitary, and in good repair, (Proposed Consent Decree ¶ 18(b)-(f)); (3) injunctive relief \nrequiring NYCHA to establish a Compliance Department, Environmental Health and Safety \nDepartment, and Quality Assurance Unit in consultation with the monitor, (Proposed Consent \nDecree ¶¶ 63-65); and (4) injunctive relief requiring NYCHA to comply with federal regulations \nand rules relating to lead-safe work practices, lead abatement, lead paint disclosure and \nnotification, and prioritization of lead paint hazards, (Proposed Consent Decree ¶¶ 66-70).  As an \ninitial matter, the Toxic Substances Control Act expressly confers upon district courts the \nauthority to restrain any violation of certain prohibited acts, including the failure to comply with \nthe federal lead-based paint rules promulgated by the EPA in 40 C.F.R. part 745.  See 15 U.S.C. \n§§ 2616, 2689.  And even to the extent that the proposed decree’s injunctive relief is not \nexpressly contemplated by the relevant provisions on which this action is premised, federal \ncourts undoubtedly possess the authority to order relief for state and local officials and agencies’ \nfailure to comply with federal law.  Cf. New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 179 (1992).\nNothing in those statutes—i.e., the U.S. Housing Act, the federal Anti-Fraud Injunction Act, and \nthe Toxic Substances Control Act—precludes the exercise of such authority.\nIn their opposition papers, Intervenors deploy the same arguments they asserted in \nseeking intervention—namely, that certain federal statutes and regulations confer participation \nand economic rights on NYCHA tenants.  See United States v. N.Y.C. Housing Auth., 326 \n23\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 24 of 52\nF.R.D. 411, 415 (S.D.N.Y. 2018).  This time, however, Intervenors repackage them in support of \ntheir contention that to pass Citigroup’s basic legality test, a consent decree that implicates \nNYCHA’s management must explicitly provide participation and economic opportunities for \ntenants.  As an initial matter, Intervenors’ contentions rest on the faulty premise that the \nProposed Consent Decree—merely by omission—encroaches upon the tenant opportunities \ncontemplated by 24 C.F.R. § 964.135, 42 U.S.C. § 1437c-1, and 12 U.S.C. § 1701u.  But more to \nthe point, Intervenors’ arguments reveal a fundamental misunderstanding of Citigroup’s “basic \nlegality” factor, which focuses on this Court’s authority to enter the Proposed Consent Decree \nand the Government’s authority to enforce it.  Whatever the nature of NYCHA tenants’ statutory \nor regulatory rights or interests in managerial or economic opportunities,15 the statutes and \nregulations that Intervenors cite simply have no bearing on the legality of the proposed decree. \nB. Clarity of the Proposed Decree \nThe Proposed Consent Decree’s indefiniteness as to NYCHA’s obligations and \nthe enforcement mechanism forecloses approval of the settlement at this juncture.  Cf. Int’l Bus. \nMachs., 2014 WL 3057960, at *3 (finding consent decree sufficiently clear where the decree \ndetailed “specific enforcement mechanisms” and detailed “Defendants’ responsibilities under the \ndecree”).  The case that Citigroup cites for this factor illustrates why.  Citigroup, 752 F.3d at 295 \n(citing Angela R. ex rel. Hesselbein v. Clinton, 999 F.2d 320 (8th Cir. 1993)).  In Clinton, which \ninvolved a “comprehensive revision of the child welfare system in Arkansas,” the Eighth Circuit \nfound that the district court abused its discretion in entering a consent decree that did not \nproperly define its enforcement mechanisms.  Clinton, 999 F.2d at 322, 325 (describing \nambiguities in which parties could enforce which provisions of the consent decree).  The Eighth \n                                                           \n15   NYCHA’s records indicate that 2,537 out of 11,182 NYCHA employees are NYCHA residents, as of \nOctober 1, 2018.  (ECF No. 213, Baez v. N.Y.C. Hous. Auth., 13cv8916 (S.D.N.Y.).)\n24\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 25 of 52\nCircuit explained that “[u]nless [the enforcement] mechanism is clearly defined—in terms of \nwho may bring an enforcement action, for what kinds of violations, and so forth—it is \nimpossible to determine,” as relevant here, “the burden that approval of the decree will impose \nupon the federal judiciary.”  Clinton, 999 F.2d at 325 (citing Schmidt v. Lessard, 414 U.S. 473 \n(1974)) (referencing the specificity requirements of Rule 65(d)); cf. United States v. Microsoft \nCorp., 56 F.3d 1448, 1461-62 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (“[T]he district judge who must preside over the \nimplementation of the decree is certainly entitled to insist on that degree of precision concerning \nthe resolution of known issues as to make his task, in resolving subsequent disputes, reasonably \nmanageable.”).   \nThe concerns over vague enforcement mechanisms are fully animated in this case.  \nIn relevant part, the Government reserves “all legal and equitable remedies available to enforce \nthe provisions of [the] Consent Decree,” which expressly provides for this Court’s continuing \njurisdiction in “effectuating or enforcing compliance with [its] terms.”  (Proposed Consent \nDecree ¶¶ 73, 84.)  At the other end of the spectrum, the Proposed Consent Decree provides that \nit “shall not be construed to . . . grant any cause of action to[] anyone not a Party to [the] Consent \nDecree.”  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶ 78.)  But these broad contours merely memorialize the \nGovernment’s non-waiver of its enforcement authority and the uncontroversial proposition that a \ncourt possesses the authority to ensure compliance with its orders, including consent decrees.\nSee Handschu v. Special Servs. Div., 2007 WL 1711775, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. June 13, 2007) (citing \nBerger v. Heckler, 771 F.2d 1556, 1568 (2d Cir. 1985)).  Put differently, they offer scant \nprecision on the provisions or obligations (to the extent that they are defined) that are \nenforceable, the types of violations that may be enforced, or the mechanisms by which \nnoncompliance with the Proposed Consent Decree may be addressed.  \n25\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 26 of 52\nTo be sure, the indeterminacy of the enforcement provisions goes hand in hand \nwith the indeterminacy of NYCHA’s obligations under the proposed decree generally.  For \ninstance, the injunctive relief includes a requirement that NYCHA “comply in all respects with \nthe lead-safe work practices” required by HUD and EPA regulations “and with the Abatement \nRule, 40 C.F.R. part 745, subpart L.”  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶ 67.)  This requirement, \nhowever, is not “specific and definite enough to apprise [NYCHA] of the conduct that is being \nproscribed.”  Ronnie Van Zant, Inc. v. Cleopatra Records, Inc., 906 F.3d 253, 258 (2d Cir. \n2018); see also Schmidt, 414 U.S. at 476 (observing that “[s]ince an injunctive order prohibits \nconduct under threat of judicial punishment, basic fairness requires that those enjoined receive \nexplicit notice of precisely what conduct is outlawed”).  Stated differently, even though the \nsubstantive legal requirements with which NYCHA must comply may be identifiable, whether \nits obligations are sufficiently determinate is a separate analytical issue.  Accord Sterling Drug, \nInc. v. Bayer AG, 14 F.3d 733, 748 (2d Cir. 1994) (rejecting injunctive provisions as \ninsufficiently specific even where they had identified the “particular laws and contracts upon \nwhich [plaintiff] had based its action” that defendant was enjoined from violating). \nThe parties’ own papers illustrate the formlessness of NYCHA’s obligations.  In \nreiterating the urgent need for a monitor, the Government claims that NYCHA has already \nviolated paragraph 67 of the Proposed Consent Decree by failing to “immediately” comply with \nits obligations regarding lead-safe work practices even before the approval of the proposed \ndecree.   (See Memorandum of Law in Support of the United States’ Motion to Enter the \nProposed Consent Decree, ECF No. 44 (“Gov’t Brief”), at 13-16; Folch Decl. ¶¶ 4-8.)\nUnsurprisingly, NYCHA disputes that it violated paragraph 67, explaining that it has been \nmaking efforts to comply that involve many complex and interrelated steps, which take time to \n26\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 27 of 52\nimplement.  (See NYCHA’s Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion to Enter the Consent \nDecree, ECF No. 46 (“NYCHA Brief”), at 4 n.11; Folch Decl., Ex. C.)  Whatever the merits of \nthe parties’ positions, NYCHA’s evident—and facially reasonable—belief that it is not in breach \nof the Proposed Consent Decree suggest that its terms are not sufficiently clear.\nMoreover, even assuming that the obligations the Proposed Consent Decree \nimposes on NYCHA to comply with various health and safety regulations may fairly be \nconstrued as injunctive relief—which, as noted below, may not be entirely clear—those terms \nare similarly amorphous.  In relevant part, the agreement provides that NYCHA shall comply \nwith (1) federal, state, and local lead paint safety statutes and regulations; and (2) federal \nregulations requiring HUD housing to be decent, safe, sanitary, and in good repair with respect to \nmold, heating, elevators, and pests.  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶ 18(a)-(f).)  These provisions \nalso require NYCHA to (1) make its housing free of lead paint “within an accelerated \ntimeframe”; (2) “remedy the conditions described in the Complaint” related to mold, heating, \nelevators, and pests “and prevent recurrence of those conditions”; and (3) “attempt to avoid and \npromptly address any other health and safety issue that arises.”  (Proposed Consent Decree \n¶ 18(a)-(f).)  Finally, the Proposed Consent Decree requires NYCHA to, “[a]s soon as practicable \nafter the Monitor’s appointment,” create certain plans “collaboratively” or “in consultation with” \nthe monitor “for the achievement of” or “to achieve sustained compliance with” subdivisions (a)-\n(g) of paragraph 18.  (See generally Proposed Consent Decree ¶¶ 27-34.)\nAt the outset, the body of statutes and regulations with which NYCHA must \ncomply is not entirely defined.  In relevant part, paragraph 18 requires NYCHA to “comply in all \nrespects with Lead Paint Laws,” (Proposed Consent Decree ¶ 18(a)(7)), which is defined to mean \n“federal, state or local lead paint safety statutes and regulations,” (Proposed Consent Decree \n27\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 28 of 52\n¶ 13(l)).  While the proposed decree lists several federal statutes and regulations that are included \nwithin this definition, it does not indicate which state or local statutes and regulations would \nform the basis for NYCHA’s obligations.  And even though paragraph 18 requires more than a \nnaked directive to comply with the laws it does identify, its instructions to remedy and prevent \nrecurrence of various health and safety conditions described in the Complaint as well as those \nthat may arise still fail to specify “the ways in which [NYCHA] must alter [its] behavior.”  See \nMickalis Pawn Shop, 645 F.3d at 144 (finding insufficient for Rule 65(d) an obligation to “act \n‘in full conformity with applicable laws pertaining to firearms,’ and to ‘adopt[] appropriate \nprophylactic measures to prevent violation’ of those laws, without specifying which laws are \n‘applicable’ or identifying the ways in which the defendants must alter their behavior to comply \nwith those laws”); accord Perez v. Danbury Hosp., 347 F.3d 419, 424 (2d Cir. 2003) (reiterating \nthe “well-established principle that the language of a consent decree must dictate what a party is \nrequired to do and what it must refrain from doing”). \nAdditionally, the Proposed Consent Decree’s definition of NYCHA’s obligations \nby reference to the Complaint “is expressly prohibited by Rule 65(d), which provides that \n‘[e]very order granting an injunction’ must ‘describe in reasonable detail—and not by referring \nto the complaint or other document—the act or acts restrained or required.’”  Mickalis Pawn \nShop, 645 F.3d at 146 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d)(1)(C)) (emphasis in original).  These are \nnot simply “technical requirements,” but are meant to “prevent uncertainty and confusion on the \npart of those faced with injunctive orders, and to avoid the possible founding of a contempt \ncitation on a decree too vague to be understood.”  Schmidt, 414 U.S. at 476.  While the \ntemptation to define NYCHA’s remedial obligation by reference to the Complaint is certainly \nunderstandable given the breadth of the wrongdoing alleged in the pleading, the risk of \n28\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 29 of 52\nuncertainty and confusion is magnified precisely for that reason. \nNor are these deficiencies cured by the Proposed Consent Decree’s extensive \nprovisions setting forth the powers and responsibilities of the monitor in developing and \nimplementing the plans and performance requirements that NYCHA must follow.  (See Proposed \nConsent Decree ¶¶ 18-37.)  As the Second Circuit has explained, a consent decree’s “sweeping \ndelegations of power to the Special Master violate[s] Rule 65(d)” because “[a] court is required \nto frame its orders so that those who must obey them will know what the court intends to \nforbid.”16  Mickalis Pawn Shop, 645 F.3d at 145-46 (citing Diapulse Corp. of Am. v. Carba, Ltd., \n626 F.2d 1108, 1111 (2d Cir. 1980)) (emphasis in original); accord United States v. Armour & \nCo., 402 U.S. 673, 682 (1971).  To be fair, the directive that NYCHA must formulate plans to \nachieve and sustain compliance with federal health and safety regulations offers more clarity \nthan other previously described provisions.  Still, its ambiguity as to when those plans must be \ndeveloped or how much cooperation with the monitor is necessary does not allow this Court to \nmeaningfully determine when those provisions have been violated.  Accord King v. Allied \nVision, Ltd., 65 F.3d 1051, 1058 (2d Cir. 1995) (explaining that to issue a contempt order, a \nmovant must establish that the order “leaves ‘no uncertainty in the minds of those to whom it is \naddressed,’ who ‘must be able to ascertain from the four corners of the order precisely what acts \nare forbidden’” (internal citations omitted)). \nUltimately, many of NYCHA’s obligations relating to the health and safety \nconditions at the core of this litigation are too indeterminate for this Court to approve the \nProposed Consent Decree.  And in this Court’s view, the lack of clarity is compounded by the \n                                                           \n16   Likewise, the Government and the monitor’s ability to enforce these plans and performance requirements is \na step removed from the ability to enforce the provisions of the Proposed Consent Decree itself and thus adds no \nadditional clarity to the decree’s enforcement mechanisms.  (See Proposed Consent Decree ¶¶ 24, 30.)   \n29\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 30 of 52\nmore basic question of whether subsections (a)-(f) of paragraph 18 of the proposed decree \naffirmatively enjoin NYCHA or merely set forth the monitor’s duty to ensure that NYCHA \ncomplies with federal health and safety standards—a distinction implied by the parties’ briefs.  \n(Compare Gov’t Brief, at 21-22 (framing the decree’s relief in terms of the monitor provisions), \nwith NYCHA Brief, at 4 (framing the decree’s requirements in terms of NYCHA’s obligations).)  \nWithout additional concreteness, NYCHA cannot possibly know the acts that are restrained or \nrequired, and this Court cannot fulfill its duty to enforce compliance with its orders.\nThis is not to say that the Proposed Consent Decree must painstakingly detail \nevery act that NYCHA must take or forbear from taking.  Indeed, such an attempt would almost \ncertainly be a fool’s errand in the context of institutional reform litigation, for which injunctions \n“are not so much peremptory commands to be obeyed in terms[] as they are future-oriented plans \ndesigned to achieve broader public policy objectives in a complex, ongoing fact situation.”  N.Y. \nState Ass’n for Retarded Children Inc. v. Carey, 706 F.2d 956, 970 n.17 (2d Cir. 1993) (quoting \nAbram Chayes, Public Law Litigation and the Burger Court, 96 Harv. L. Rev. 4, 56 (1982)).  But \nCitigroup fairly suggests that even consent decrees that implement broad institutional reform—\nsuch as the comprehensive revision of Arkansas’ child welfare system—require some threshold \nof clarity.  Citigroup, 752 F.3d at 295 (citing Clinton, 999 F.3d at 325).  Whether that threshold \nought to be higher based on the lasting nature of injunctive relief in institutional reform \nlitigation, or lower to account for more dynamic factual circumstances, need not be resolved on \nthis motion.  The current failure of the Proposed Consent Decree to sufficiently define its \ninjunctive relief and enforcement mechanism precludes its approval.     \nC. Resolution of Actual Claims  \nA consent decree that settles a government enforcement action must also reflect a \n30\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 31 of 52\nresolution of the “actual claims in the complaint.”  Citigroup, 752 F.3d at 295.  Few post-\nCitigroup cases in this circuit have examined when a consent decree would or would not reflect a \nresolution of the actual claims asserted.  This sparseness of case authority may in part be \nattributable to decrees that order relief that plainly resolves the asserted claims.  For instance, \nanother judge in this district found that a consent decree requiring the defendant “to reimburse \nEPA for past-response costs and to take certain remedial actions” in the decree “directly\nresolve[d]” two claims “seeking reimbursement for Plaintiff’s past-response costs pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 9607(a), and . . . seeking remedial actions from Defendant pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \n§ 9606(a).”  Int’l Bus. Machs., 2014 WL 30357960, at *3; see 42 U.S.C. § 9606(a) (authorizing \n“such relief as may be necessary to abate” an “imminent and substantial endangerment to the \npublic health or welfare or the environment because of an actual or threatened release of a \nhazardous substance from a facility” and “such relief as the public interest and the equities of the \ncase may require”). \nCertainly, a consent decree that orders relief authorized by the statutory regime \nunder which a claim is brought satisfies this factor, even if that relief is less than that which \ncould have been obtained after trial.  It should be uncontroversial, for example, that a proposed \nconsent decree in an SEC enforcement case that grants disgorgement and enjoins a defendant \nfrom violating the federal securities laws clearly reflects a resolution of claims brought under the \nanti-fraud provisions of those statutes.  E.g., Caledonian Bank, 317 F.R.D. at 369-70; see \ngenerally SEC v. Subaye, Inc., 2014 WL 4652578 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 28, 2014); SEC v. CR \nIntrinsic Inv’rs, LLC, 26 F. Supp. 3d 260 (S.D.N.Y. 2014).  Likewise, the Proposed Consent \nDecree’s injunctive relief requiring NYCHA to comply with its lead-safe work practices, lead \nabatement, and lead disclosure obligations under 40 C.F.R. part 745, subparts E, F, and L clearly \n31\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 32 of 52\nresolves the Government’s Toxic Substances Control Act claim.   \nThe Government’s other claims raise the question of whether a consent decree \nthat does not provide for any statutorily authorized relief, but separate injunctive relief that \npurports to address the underlying conduct, can be fairly said to reflect a “resolution of the actual \nclaims in the complaint.”  Citigroup, 752 F.3d at 295.  In particular, the Complaint asserts a \nclaim for substantial default pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(j)(3) and a claim to enjoin NYCHA’s \nongoing or impending false statements pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1345.  Section 1437d(j)(3) \nauthorizes the HUD Secretary to take a broad panoply of remedial actions if a public housing \nagency substantially defaults on its covenants or conditions under an annual contributions \ncontract, or if a public housing agency designated by HUD as “troubled” substantially defaults \non an agreement with HUD to improve its management performance.  See 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1437d(j)(3); see also 24 C.F.R. § 907.3 (enumerating bases for substantial default, including \nthe violation of a federal statute or regulation).  These remedies do not require the public housing \nagency’s consent or contemplate judicial involvement, except that the HUD Secretary may \npetition a court for the appointment of a receiver, see 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(j)(3)(A)(ii), which the \ncourt “shall appoint” to conduct the public housing agency’s affairs “upon a determination that a \nsubstantial default has occurred and without regard to the availability of alternative remedies,” \nsee 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(j)(3)(F).  Separately, the Anti-Fraud Injunction Act authorizes the \nAttorney General to bring a federal civil action to enjoin ongoing or impending violations of \nenumerated federal criminal statutes, including 18 U.S.C. § 1001.  See 18 U.S.C. § 1345(a)(1).\nIt bears underscoring that the Proposed Consent Decree does not seek the judicial \nappointment of a receiver or any of the other remedies set forth in 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(j)(3) or 24 \nC.F.R. § 907.7.  In fact, HUD specifically reserves its right to “appoint, or to seek judicial \n32\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 33 of 52\nappointment of, a receiver for substantial default, as well as all other administrative remedies.”  \n(Proposed Consent Decree ¶ 81.)  Moreover, the Proposed Consent Decree expressly disclaims \nthe monitor’s “responsib[ility] for NYCHA’s day-to-day operations.”  (Proposed Consent Decree \n¶ 35.)  Instead, the Proposed Consent Decree purports to address NYCHA’s violations of HUD’s \nlead-paint safety regulations and its obligation under 24 C.F.R. § 5.703 to provide “decent, safe, \nand sanitary housing” by restating NYCHA’s obligation to comply with those regulations and \nthen providing a monitor to oversee and enforce compliance.  The decree’s relief as to NYCHA’s \nalleged false statements to federal regulators is similarly oblique.  Rather than seeking to directly \nenjoin such violations, the Proposed Consent Decree requires NYCHA to “ensure the integrity of \n[public housing inspections]” and to establish a Compliance Department charged with \n“[e]nsuring the accuracy of external reporting and statements by NYCHA” and the integrity of \npublic housing inspections. (Proposed Consent Decree ¶¶ 18(g), 63(b) & (e).) \nThis Court nevertheless concludes that the Proposed Consent Decree reflects a \nresolution of the Government’s “actual claims” under 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(j)(3) and 18 U.S.C. \n§ 1345 because it addresses the conduct underlying those claims, despite providing for relief \noutside those statutory regimes.  Admittedly, Citigroup’s formulation of what a court must \nconsider in evaluating the fairness and reasonableness of a government consent decree differs \nfrom prior circuit precedent reiterating the “standards controlling a court’s authority to enter a \nconsent decree” set forth by the Supreme Court.  Kozlowski v. Coughlin, 871 F.2d 241, 244 (2d \nCir. 1989) (citing Local No. 93, Int’l Ass’n of Firefighters v. City of Cleveland (“Firefighters”), \n478 U.S. 501, 525 (1986)).  Absent further clarification by the Second Circuit, however, this \nCourt discerns no meaningful difference between Citigroup’s requirement that a proposed decree \nreflect a resolution of the actual claims in the complaint and Firefighters’ requirement that a \n33\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 34 of 52\nconsent decree “spring from and serve to resolve a dispute within the court’s subject matter-\njurisdiction” and “come within the general scope of the case made by the pleadings.”  See \nFirefighters, 478 U.S. at 525 (citations omitted).   \nOf course, a proposed consent decree cannot be untethered from the conduct \ncomplained of because “a federal court is more than a recorder of contracts from whom parties \ncan purchase injunctions; it is an organ of government constituted to make judicial decisions.”  \nFirefighters, 478 U.S. at 525 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); accord Citigroup, \n752 F.3d at 295 (requiring the reviewing court to still “establish that a factual basis exists for the \nproposed decree”).  But it is ultimately “the agreement of the parties, rather than the force of the \nlaw upon which the complaint was originally based, that creates the obligations embodied in a \nconsent decree.”  Firefighters, 478 U.S. at 522.  In other words, a consent decree necessarily \nreflects a voluntary surrender of claims in exchange for certain bargained-for obligations.  Cf. \nCitigroup, 752 F.3d at 295 (“‘[C]onsent decrees are normally compromises in which the parties \ngive up something they might have won in litigation and waive their rights to litigation.’  Thus, a \nconsent decree ‘must be construed . . . as written, and not as it might have been written had the \nplaintiff established his factual claims and legal theories in litigation.’” (internal citations \nomitted) (alterations in original)).  Accordingly, these principles indicate that a consent decree \nthat addresses the conduct underlying the dispute between the parties may reflect a resolution of \nthe asserted claims even if its remedies are not contemplated by the statutory regime under which \nthe claims are brought.  Cf. Firefighters, 478 U.S. at 525 (observing that the remedies provided \nby a consent decree may be broader than that which a court may grant after trial). \nD. Improper Collusion or Corruption \nIn examining whether a proposed consent decree is “tainted by improper collusion \n34\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 35 of 52\nor corruption of some kind,” post-Citigroup cases have considered whether the settlement \nresulted from arm’s-length negotiation, the sophistication of the parties and competence of \ncounsel, and the extent to which the proposed decree reflects adversarial negotiations.  E.g., \nCaledonian Bank, 317 F.R.D. at 373; Int’l Bus. Machs., 2014 WL 6057960, at *3.  Here, the \nparties represent that the Proposed Consent Decree resulted from months of intense negotiations \namong the Government, NYCHA, and the City.  (See Gov’t Brief, at 22; NYCHA Brief, at 5; \naccord July 10, 2018 Hr’g Tr. at 9 (statement by Government counsel that initial negotiations \nbegan in August 2017 and intensified that winter).)  The parties also warrant—and the record \nreveals no basis to disagree—that the United States Attorney’s Office, NYCHA’s retained \ncounsel, and the City’s Corporation Counsel are highly competent and experienced.   \nII. Whether the Public Interest Is Disserved \nWhere, as here, a proposed consent decree contains injunctive relief, a “district \ncourt must assure itself the ‘public interest would not be disserved by the issuance of a \npermanent injunction.”  Citigroup, 752 F.3d at 296 (citing eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C., \n547 U.S. 388, 391 (2006)).  In other words, this inquiry turns on “whether the public interest \nwould be disserved by entry of the consent decree.”  Citigroup, 752 F.3d at 296.  The Second \nCircuit instructs, however, that the Government’s decision as to “whether the proposed . . . \nconsent decree best serves the public interest . . . rests squarely with the [Government], and its \ndecision merits significant deference.”  Citigroup, 752 F.3d at 296.   \nAside from two markers, Citigroup offers sparse guidance on the circumstances in \nwhich the entry of a government consent decree would disserve the public interest.  On one hand, \na consent decree that “bar[s] private litigants from pursuing their own claims independent of the \nrelief obtained under the consent decree” may disserve the public interest.  Citigroup, 752 F.3d at \n35\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 36 of 52\n297.  In that regard, this factor appears to reach further than whether a proposed decree’s \ninjunctive provisions directly disserve a substantive policy goal.  On the other hand, a court may \nnot find that a consent decree disserves the public interest “based on its disagreement with the \n[Government’s] decision on discretionary matters of policy,” such as a decision to “bring the \nproper charges” or “settle without requiring an admission of liability.”  Citigroup, 752 F.3d at \n297.  Whatever the field of appropriate public interest considerations may be, the Second Circuit \ninstructs that the inquiry must focus on the effect of the decree itself.  See Citigroup, 752 F.3d at \n297 (citing Microsoft, 56 F.3d at 1459).\nThis Court concludes that entry of the Proposed Consent Decree would disserve \nthe public interest.  At heart, the proposed decree would bring about an unwarranted—and as far \nas this Court is aware, unprecedented—judicial usurpation of responsibilities that Congress has \nexpressly entrusted to HUD, a Cabinet-level department of the Executive.  See Hedges v. \nObama, 2012 WL 1721124, at *28 (S.D.N.Y. May 16, 2012) (recognizing the “strong public \ninterest in . . . maintaining the appropriate separation of powers”).  The Proposed Consent \nDecree also enables a judicial intrusion into the legislative and regulatory functions of the \npolitical branches by effectuating the purposes of the U.S. Housing Act in a way that operates in \nthe shadows of the statutory scheme.  In doing so, the parties’ proposed framework effectively \nrewrites the law.  Specifically, Section 6 of the U.S. Housing Act and the regulations \npromulgated thereunder set forth detailed procedures for HUD to evaluate the quality of public \nhousing, see 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(f); 24 C.F.R. part 902 subpart B; 24 C.F.R. § 5.703; for HUD to \nevaluate a public housing agency’s management performance, see 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(j)(1); 24 \nC.F.R. part 902 subpart D; for HUD to identify and assist public housing agencies whose \nperformance is deficient, see 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(j)(2); 24 C.F.R. part 902 subparts A & G; and \n36\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 37 of 52\nfor HUD to take action if a public housing agency is deemed to be in substantial default, see 42 \nU.S.C. § 1437d(j)(3); 24 C.F.R. part 907. \nConsistent with HUD’s primary regulatory responsibility, Congress endowed \nHUD with a robust arsenal of remedies to address a public housing agency’s management and \noperational failures.  For a public housing agency in substantial default—as the Government \nalleges here—HUD has the authority to (1) solicit proposals from other public housing agencies \nand private housing management agents to manage the public housing agency’s housing or \nprograms; (2) solicit proposals from other public housing agencies and private entities to oversee \nimplementation of funds to assist the public housing agency with capital and management \nactivities; (3) take possession of the public housing agency and, in certain circumstances, appoint \nan administrative receiver; or (4) require the public housing agency to make other arrangements \nfor managing the public housing agency “acceptable to the Secretary and in the best interests of \nthe public housing residents and families.”  42 U.S.C. § 1437d(j)(3)(A), (j)(3)(B)(ii)(III)(bb).  In \naddition to these remedies, HUD may also provide “technical assistance for existing [public \nhousing agency] management staff” or “assistance deemed necessary, in the discretion of HUD, \nto remedy emergency conditions.”  24 C.F.R. § 907.7(a).\nWhile these statutory and regulatory remedies do not require the public housing \nagency’s consent or contemplate judicial involvement, HUD may seek the judicial appointment \nof a receiver with broad remedial powers to correct the substantial default, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1437d(j)(3)(A)(ii), which a court must appoint upon a determination of substantial default, 42 \nU.S.C. § 1437d(j)(3)(F).  The receiver may abrogate the public housing agency’s contracts, \ndemolish and dispose of the public housing agency’s assets, establish new public housing \nagencies, consolidate the public housing agency into other public housing agencies, circumvent \n37\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 38 of 52\ncertain state and local requirements relating to procurement or financial controls, and exercise \nadditional powers granted by the court.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(j)(3)(C).  Moreover, the HUD \nSecretary may make available to the receiver “such assistance as the Secretary determines in the \ndiscretion of the Secretary is necessary and available to remedy the substantial deterioration of \nliving conditions in individual public housing projects or other related emergencies that endanger \nthe health, safety, and welfare” of public housing residents.  42 U.S.C. § 1437d(j)(3)(E).  These \ndrastic remedies have been deployed successfully to reform other public housing agencies, \nincluding HUD’s takeover of the Chicago Housing Authority in the 1990s and the judicial \nappointment of receivers to oversee the Boston Housing Authority in the 1980s and the District \nof Columbia Housing Authority in the 1990s. \nThe legislative history for 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(j) also corroborates HUD’s primary \nresponsibility to reform failing public housing.  Cf. Digital Realty Tr., Inc. v. Somers, 138 S. Ct. \n767, 782 (2018) (Sotomayor, J., concurring) (arguing that even if “a statute’s meaning can \nclearly be discerned from its text, consulting reliable legislative history can still be useful” in \nallowing a court to “corroborate and fortify [its] understanding of the text”).  In relevant part, the \nCranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 overhauled Section 6(j) of the U.S. \nHousing Act to include substantially the same remedies set forth in the current version of \n§ 1437d(j).  See Pub. L. No. 101-625, § 502(a), 104 Stat. 4079 (1990).  The conference \ncommittee report confirms Congress’ intent for HUD to use its authority under § 1437d(j)(3) “to \nmove aggressively to improve living conditions for tenants in severely troubled public housing,” \nH.R. Rep. No. 101-943 (1990) (Conf. Rep.), as reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6070, 6119-20; \naccord S. Rep. No. 101-316 (1990), as reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5763, 5939-40 \n(explaining that these provisions were designed to enhance HUD’s authority to reform public \n38\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 39 of 52\nhousing management).   \nSubsequent amendments to 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(j)(3) that expand HUD’s powers \nand mandates reaffirm HUD’s affirmative responsibility to actually exercise its authority.  See \nHousing and Community Development Act of 1992, Pub. L. No. 102-550, § 113, 106 Stat. 3672 \n(1992).  The Senate committee report recognized that then-existing law “provide[d] HUD with a \nstrong set of powers” that “if properly implemented, would go a long way towards reforming the \nmanagement of troubled [public housing agencies] and improving the living conditions of \ntenants who reside in housing administered by these agencies.”  S. Rep. No. 102-332, at 46 \n(1992).  But as Senate Report 332 explained, Section 6(j) needed to be bolstered because HUD \n“has rarely exercised these powers . . . .”  S. Rep. No. 102-332, at 46.  It reaffirmed HUD’s role \nas follows:  \nThe Committee believes strongly that the federal government has an affirmative \nresponsibility—to the residents of public housing, to the federal taxpayers—to use \nits resources to remedy the management deficiencies in those few local agencies \nthat  are  troubled.    HUD  cannot  “shift  the  blame”  to  local  malfeasance  or \nincompetence; it ultimately has the responsibility to monitor the performance of \nrecipients of federal aid and to act aggressively when such aid is being misused. \nS. Rep. No. 102-332, at 46.  These passages do not suggest that Congress intended HUD to sit \nidly by and allow a district court to reform a public housing agency in the first instance.\nAgainst this legislative backdrop, HUD’s comparative abdication of its remedial \nresponsibilities and powers under 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(j)(3) and 24 C.F.R. part 907 is particularly \nstriking, especially given all of the Government’s allegations regarding the deplorable conditions \nof NYCHA housing and NYCHA’s deliberate attempts to pull the wool over HUD’s eyes.  \nIndeed, the Proposed Consent Decree relegates HUD to a narrow, auxiliary role in relaxing its \nown regulatory constraints to allow NYCHA to comply with the decree, lifting its earlier “zero \nthreshold” sanction requiring NYCHA to obtain HUD approval before drawing any federal \n39\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 40 of 52\nfunds, agreeing not to offset federal funding by the amount of the City’s funding obligation, and \nmeeting with the monitor and NYCHA to “discuss strategies to improve NYCHA’s ability to \ncomply with its obligations under [the decree].”  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶¶ 48-52.)  The \ninversion of roles contemplated by the Proposed Consent Decree is illustrated by the Corporation \nCounsel’s statement at the July 10, 2018 conference regarding the alignment of the Government, \nNYCHA, and the City.  Specifically, he shared the City’s expectation that “because we are allied \nin interests that we will have in the Government, in the U.S. Attorney’s Office, an effective \nadvocate for NYCHA with Washington, and specifically with HUD.”  (July 10, 2018 Hr’g Tr. at \n46.)  But any role that functionally cabins HUD to getting out of the way of the monitor and \nNYCHA contravenes the central role that Congress envisioned for HUD in enacting the very \nstatutory provisions that the Complaint and the Proposed Consent Decree seek to enforce.\nInstead, to address NYCHA’s management and operational deficiencies, the \nproposed decree establishes an elaborate monitorship to bring about organizational reform under \nthe auspices of this Court and appropriates funding to assist in achieving the monitorship’s \npurposes.  In particular, the Proposed Consent Decree obligates the monitor to develop \nPerformance Requirements directed toward addressing the health and safety conditions \nreferenced in paragraph 18.  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶¶ 23-26.)  Likewise, the Proposed \nConsent Decree requires NYCHA, together with the monitor, to develop Action Plans, an \nOperational Plan, and an Organizational Plan to remedy NYCHA’s violations of the U.S. \nHousing Act and HUD regulations.  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶¶ 27-29.)   \nBut such an arrangement implicates the fundamental separation of powers among \nthe branches of the Federal Government by commandeering a court’s equitable powers to \nfashion a comprehensive injunctive remedy parallel to—yet entirely unmoored from—the \n40\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 41 of 52\nexisting statutory and regulatory framework.  See New York, 505 U.S. at 182 (explaining that \n“[t]he Constitution’s division of power among the three branches is violated where one branch \ninvades the territory of another, whether or not the encroached-upon branch approves the \nencroachment”).  To be clear, this case does not implicate the Executive’s exercise of \nenforcement discretion, see Citigroup, 752 F.3d at 297, such as the SEC’s determination of what \ncharges to bring, against whom to bring them, and what penalty to seek,17 cf. Massachusetts v. \nEPA, 549 U.S. 497, 527-28 (2007); In re Aiken Cty., 725 F.3d 255, 266 (D.C. Cir. 2013) \n(opinion of Kavanaugh, J.) (distinguishing prosecutorial discretion in “whether to initiate charges \nfor legal wrongdoing and to seek punishment, penalties, or sanctions against individuals or \nentities who violate federal law” from “the discretion not to follow a law imposing a mandate or \nprohibition on the Executive Branch”).\nStated differently, the text, structure, and legislative history of the U.S. Housing \nAct do not indicate that HUD has discretion to select which deficient public housing agencies it \nchooses to assist.  To the contrary, 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(j) reflects an affirmative legislative \nmandate for HUD to oversee all public housing agencies that receive federal funds.  The \nProposed Consent Decree upsets Congress’ balancing of priorities and its reasoned judgment \nabout how to remedy a public housing agency’s institutional failure and who bears responsibility \nfor that undertaking.  Accord Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham, 436 U.S. 618, 625 (1978) \n(stating that where Congress “does speak directly to a question, the courts are not free to \n‘supplement’ Congress’ answer so thoroughly that the Act becomes meaningless”).  HUD’s \napparent acquiescence to a judicial encroachment upon legislative territory—and by extension, \n                                                           \n17   In Citigroup, the Second Circuit found that the district judge abused his discretion by second-guessing the \nSEC’s judgment in bringing certain claims and settling them on a particular set of terms.  See Citigroup, 752 F.3d at \n295-97.  A court’s substitution of its own judgment for that of a regulator is a raw exercise of judicial power.  By \ncontrast, this Court’s rejection of the Proposed Consent Decree does not animate those concerns.   \n41\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 42 of 52\nHUD’s congressionally conferred responsibilities—does not make it any less of an invasion. \nEven aside from these unanswered separation-of-powers questions, the extent to \nwhich the Proposed Consent Decree vests the monitor with “discretion to determine the terms of \nthe injunctions themselves” also raises substantial public concern.  Mickalis Pawn Shop, 645 \nF.3d at 145.  Here, absent objection by NYCHA or the Government, Performance Requirements \n“shall become binding” when the Government files them on the docket after its approval.  \n(Proposed Consent Decree ¶ 24.)  If NYCHA or the Government objects, the Performance \nRequirement may be modified or set aside, but only if found by this Court to be arbitrary or \ncapricious—a highly deferential standard of review.  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶¶ 24-25.)\nSimilarly, for Action Plans, the Operational Plan, and the Organizational Plan that NYCHA must \nfollow, the proposed decree for all intents and purposes removes this Court from the \ndetermination of what acts are required or prohibited.  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶¶ 27-29.)  In \nparticular, a plan that NYCHA and the monitor agree upon and which the Government approves \n“shall be binding on NYCHA” on the date that the Government files the plan on the docket.\n(Proposed Consent Decree ¶ 30.)  And if NYCHA, the monitor, or the Government disagree with \nor disapprove of a plan, the Proposed Consent Decree vests the monitor with the authority to \nunilaterally develop a plan to be approved by this Court—but also only under an arbitrary and \ncapricious standard.  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶ 31.) \nThe Supreme Court has “warned that ‘[t]he use of masters is to aid judges in the \nperformance of specific judicial duties, as they may arise in the progress of a cause, and not to \ndisplace the court.’”  Mickalis Pawn Shop, 645 F.3d at 145 (citing La Buy v. Howes Leather Co., \n352 U.S. 249, 256 (1957)) (emphases added).  At bottom, the proposed decree outsources the \nformulation of NYCHA’s obligations—the violation of which is ostensibly subject to this \n42\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 43 of 52\nCourt’s contempt powers—to the monitor and the parties without any meaningful judicial \nreview.  In this regard, the Proposed Consent Decree’s delegation of this Court’s ultimate \nauthority to determine the terms of the injunctive relief is closer to a displacement of judicial \nauthority than a decree in which a monitor aids the court by developing reforms to be approved \nby the court.  E.g., Floyd v. City of N.Y., 959 F. Supp. 2d 668, 677-78 (S.D.N.Y. 2013). \nOne additional observation is warranted.  A government agency’s eschewing of \nadministrative remedies in favor of a consent decree and a federal court injunction is not always \nimproper.  Cf. Citigroup, 752 F.3d at 297 (noting that if the SEC does not wish to involve the \ncourts, it may simply employ its own arsenal of remedies).  The Government represented that it \nhad considered a receivership but believed that a monitor “made the most sense” given \nNYCHA’s size and “the need for buy in and support from community residents, from tenants to \nemployees, from all the people who make NYCHA run.”  (July 10, 2018 Hr’g Tr. at 7.)  It \nsubsequently asserted that it opted for a monitor instead of a receiver because the latter would \nnot have the benefit of the City’s funding commitment under the proposed decree.  (Sept. 26, \n2018 Hr’g Tr. at 201-02; accord Sept. 26, 2018 Hr’g Tr. at 184 (statement by NYCHA’s \ncounsel).)  The Government’s initial reason—buy in from tenants—is arguably inconsistent on \nits face with public comments opposing the proposed decree.  The parties also do not explain \nwhy the City may only commit to provide funding if this Court installs a monitor, as opposed to \nsome other solution.  To be certain, the “province of the court is . . . not to enquire how the \nexecutive, or executive officers, perform duties in which they have a discretion.”  Marbury v. \nMadison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 170 (1803).  But now having “call[ed] upon the power of the \ncourts in ordering a consent decree and issuing an injunction,” the Government must demonstrate \nthat it is fair and reasonable and that it does not disserve the public interest.  Citigroup, 752 F.3d \n43\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 44 of 52\nat 297.  For the reasons set forth above, the Proposed Consent Decree fails to satisfy the \nCitigroup standard. \nPRUDENTIAL CONCERNS \nThis Court would be remiss if it did not share additional concerns that the \nProposed Consent Decree tests the limits of judicial legitimacy and capacity.  As our Founding \nFathers recognized, the judiciary “may truly be said to have neither force nor will but merely \njudgment,” and a court “disposed to exercise will instead of judgment” consequently substitutes \n“[its] pleasure for that of the legislative body.”  The Federalist No. 78 (A. Hamilton).  The \nSecond Circuit notes that “several commentators have discussed generally potential dangers of \nresolving by consent decree class actions and so-called ‘public interest’ or ‘institutional reform’ \nlitigation.”  Barcia v. Sitkin, 367 F.3d 87, 105 n.23 (2d Cir. 2004).  These scholarly criticisms of \nbroad injunctive relief in consent decrees as a policymaking tool include the debatable \nlegitimacy and authority of such judicial exercises of public power and the specter of \ncircumventing the political process.  Barcia, 367 F.3d at 105 n.23 (collecting authorities).\nTo be clear, this case differs fundamentally from institutional reform litigation \nthat seeks to remedy the constitutional or civil rights violations of a local school board, e.g., \nBrown v. Bd. of Educ. of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), a state human services agency, e.g., \nAngela R. ex rel. Hesselbein v. Clinton, 999 F.2d 320 (8th Cir. 1993), or a municipal police \ndepartment, e.g., Floyd v. City of N.Y., 959 F. Supp. 2d 668 (S.D.N.Y. 2013).  As a general \nmatter, the enforcement and protection of constitutional rights is indisputably within the \nauthority of a federal court.  See Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228, 242 (1979); accord United \nStates v. Ghailani, 686 F. Supp. 2d 279, 290 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (citing Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 \nU.S. 731, 783 (1982)) (“Determining whether a person’s constitutional rights have been violated \n44\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 45 of 52\nand fashioning appropriate relief is a core, traditional function of American courts.”).  And upon \nfinding a constitutional violation, a federal court may exercise its equitable remedial powers “to \nrestructure the operation of local and state governmental entities,” so long as the court “tailor[s] \n‘the scope of the remedy’ to fit ‘the nature and extent of the constitutional violation.’”  Hills v. \nGautreaux, 425 U.S. 284, 293-94 (1976) (citations omitted).   \nAside from this basic limitation on a federal court’s equitable powers, however, \nthe Supreme Court has long recognized a federal judge’s broad authority to create sweeping \nrelief to remedy a constitutional violation.  See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., \n402 U.S. 1, 15 (1971) (“Once a right and a violation have been shown, the scope of the district \ncourt’s equitable powers to remedy past wrongs is broad, for breadth and flexibility are inherent \nin equitable remedies.”); accord Hills, 425 U.S. at 297 (citations omitted) (reiterating that “in the \nevent of a constitutional violation ‘all reasonable methods be available to formulate an effective \nremedy,’ and that every effort should be made by a federal court to employ those methods ‘to \nachieve the greatest possible degree of [relief], taking into account the practicalities of the \nsituation’” (alteration in original)).  Of course, institutional reform litigation that seeks to address \nconstitutional violations requires some degree of flexibility in formulating equitable relief as a \npractical matter because the Constitution “does not ‘partake of the prolixity of a legal code,’” but \n“speaks instead with a majestic simplicity.”  Davis, 442 U.S. at 241 (quoting McCulloch v. \nMaryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 407 (1819)). \nBut this is not an institutional reform case that seeks to remedy constitutional \nviolations; nor is it one in which Congress has bestowed broad authority upon the courts to \nremedy violations of civil rights statutes.  See, e.g., Local 28 Sheet Metal Workers’ Int’l Ass’n v. \nEEOC, 478 U.S. 421, 465 (1986) (“Congress deliberately gave the district courts broad authority \n45\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 46 of 52\nunder Title VII to fashion the most complete relief possible.”).  To the contrary, Congress has \ncommitted to HUD the authority and responsibility to reform public housing agencies that \nreceive federal funding.  And to that end, it has established extensive remedies for HUD to \naggressively address deficiencies in a public housing agency’s management or the conditions of \nits housing.  This Court has already discussed the concerns that the Proposed Consent Decree \nraises with respect to separation of powers and the delegation of equitable judicial authority.  But \nthe incongruity between the Complaint and the Proposed Consent Decree also raises doubts as to \nthe legitimacy of any judicial imprimatur on the proposed decree.  In particular, the Complaint \nasserts a “claim” under Section 6(j) of the U.S. Housing Act based on NYCHA’s violations of its \nobligations under its Annual Contributions Contract, which incorporates federal lead-paint safety \nregulations and its obligation under 24 C.F.R. § 5.703 to provide decent, safe, and sanitary \nhousing.  While the Proposed Consent Decree in some general sense requires NYCHA to comply \nwith these regulations, the Government has made clear that the focus of the proposed decree is a \nmonitorship structured entirely by the parties.  Cf. Firefighters, 478 U.S. at 536, 540 (Rehnquist, \nJ., dissenting) (questioning whether a consent decree “may be structured almost entirely by the \nparties, even though the statute which the decree enforces may not authorize any such relief . . .” \nand expressing the view that the scope of a consent decree is “properly restrain[ed] . . . to that of \nimplementation of the federal statute pursuant to which the decree is entered”).   \nQuestions of judicial legitimacy aside, the adversarial positions the parties have \nstaked after signing the proposed decree and during the pendency of the motion for approval also \nportend this Court’s de facto conscription into superintending NYCHA indefinitely—a role that \njudges are ill-equipped to assume.  See Clinton, 999 F.2d at 326 (noting that “[f]ederal courts \noperate according to institutional rules and procedures that are poorly suited to the management \n46\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 47 of 52\nof state agencies”).  In particular, the Government’s moving papers claim that NYCHA has \nalready defaulted on its obligations to comply immediately with lead-safe work practices under \nparagraph 67 of the Proposed Consent Decree.  (Gov’t Brief, at 13-16.) NYCHA disputes that it \nviolated the proposed decree, claiming that its efforts to comply had preceded the signing of the \nproposed decree and accelerated after that.  (NYCHA Brief, at 4 n.11; Folch Decl. Ex. C.)  In a \nsimilar vein, the Government has criticized NYCHA’s unilateral appointment of a NYCHA \ninsider who never previously worked in a compliance department as Chief Compliance Officer \nwithout consulting the Government.  (Gov’t Brief, at 17.)  Though not outside the letter of the \nProposed Consent Decree—which only requires that the Chief Compliance Officer be appointed \nin consultation with the monitor—NYCHA’s counsel conceded that this appointment was not in \nthe spirit of the parties’ agreement.  (Sept. 26, 2018 Hr’g Tr. at 176.)  When pressed at oral \nargument, NYCHA’s counsel contended that the proposed decree had not yet been approved and \nthat NYCHA believed that compliance work needed to continue.18  (Sept. 26, 2018 Hr’g Tr. at \n175-77.)\nFurther, the parties’ divergent characterizations of the Proposed Consent Decree’s \nkey provisions—the monitorship, according to the Government, and NYCHA’s obligations to \nfollow the law, according to NYCHA—betray a disagreement over the monitor’s role that \nevokes shades of the “Peerless” case familiar to first-year law students.  See Raffles v. \nWichelhaus, 159 Eng. Rep. 375 (Ex. 1864).  In addition to setting forth the general monitorship \nframework, the Proposed Consent Decree clarifies that the monitor “shall not be responsible for \n                                                           \n18   NYCHA’s Interim Chair reportedly offered a more pointed response, stating “We are not in violation of the \nconsent decree.  There is no way on this earth that I was going to wait for the monitor’s arrival to put a compliance \nofficer in place.”  See Greg B. Smith, Pol rips de Blasio appointment of political insider to monitor NYCHA safety \ncompliance, N.Y. Daily News (Aug. 21, 2018), http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-metro-nycha-\ncompliance-violation-20180820-story.html.  Of course, whatever urgency NYCHA’s Interim Chair perceived, the \nunilateral nature of NYCHA’s action undercuts the collaborative atmosphere the parties say they are cultivating. \n47\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 48 of 52\nNYCHA’s day-to-day operations.”  (Proposed Consent Decree ¶ 35.)  Aside from this limitation, \nthere is much room for disagreement as to the monitor’s role.  (Cf. July 10, 2018 Hr’g Tr. at 8 \n(statement by Government counsel noting the uncertainty in the degree to which the monitor’s \noperations will be integrated with NYCHA’s current infrastructure and acknowledging that “as \npeople apply or suggest that they should be monitor, they have different ideas and structures for \nwhat they would bring to that process”).)  In sum, the parties’ statements on the record and \nsubsequent public sniping tell a tale of two monitors. \nThe Government has consistently described the monitorship as the “centerpiece” \nof the proposed decree whose role is not simply to monitor compliance with the decree, but to \n“direct NYCHA to make overarching organizational and work force changes and to take \nspecified steps to achieve health and safety improvements,” including directing NYCHA to \nperform work through independent contractors, entering into contracts on NYCHA’s behalf, and \ncreating Performance Requirements and various organizational and operational plans.  (Gov’t \nBrief, at 1; see, e.g., Sept. 26, 2018 Hr’g Tr. at 151-52 (representing that the monitor will “help \nNYCHA fix its problems and, where necessary, step in to fix them”); July 10, 2018 Hr’g Tr. at 6 \n(describing the monitor as “not your ordinary monitor in some significant respects” and that the \nmonitor has “its own authority laying out plans for improving NYCHA and for reorganizing the \norganization”).)  While NYCHA’s papers say little about how it envisions the monitor’s role, its \ncounsel’s statements at the fairness hearing suggest a constrained view of the monitor as merely \nfacilitating collaboration and providing increased accountability.  (See Sept. 26, 2018 Hr’g Tr. at \n177, 180-81.)  Given NYCHA’s active deceit of federal regulators, however, whether such a \npassive role can assure any meaningful accountability is doubtful. \nThe public skirmishing between NYCHA’s Interim Chair and the U.S. Attorney \n48\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 49 of 52\nreveals the wide chasm between the parties’ expectations for the monitor.  Only two weeks after \nNYCHA’s tenants testified at length about the need for greater oversight, NYCHA’s Interim \nChair—who was nowhere to be found during the public testimony by tenants—expressed his \nconcerns “about what could be a creeping monitorship that’s more in the operational mode, as \nopposed to a monitor who monitors.”  Janaki Chadha, Brezenoff raises doubts about NYCHA \nmonitor under federal consent decree, Politico (Oct. 10, 2018), https://www.politico.com/states/ \nnew-york/city-hall/story/2018/10/10/brezenoff-raises-doubts-about-nycha-monitor-under-\nfederal-consent-decree-642333.  He also criticized the proposed monitorship “because it’s much \nmore actively constructed, where there’s more of a management role, at least in vision,” calling it \n“a prescription for difficulty, if not disaster.” He lamented that when he signed the proposed \ndecree, he “saw it as more of a monitorship, and in some of the interactions that are going on, \n[he] see[s] the possibility that others might have a different view.”  One of these “others” is the \nU.S. Attorney, who retorted that NYCHA’s Interim Chair “should be getting on board with the \nmonitorship he signed off on” and that NYCHA’s belated resistance to anything more than a \nmilquetoast monitor was “not a smart move.”  See Nolan Hicks, Feds blast top NYCHA \nmanagement as a ‘real disaster’, N.Y. Post (Oct. 30, 2018), https://nypost.com/2018/10/30/feds-\nblast-top-nycha-management-as-a-real-disaster. \nIn the end, NYCHA may be correct that whatever sluggishness the Government \nperceives in NYCHA’s efforts to comply with the lead-safe work practices requirement does not \nfall outside the letter of the Proposed Consent Decree.  And it may be that NYCHA’s haste to \nappoint a compliance officer does not logically violate a decree that has yet to be judicially \napproved.  Such actions, however, evince a troubling propensity for NYCHA to do what it \nwants, when it wants.  The point is that NYCHA’s unilateral actions and statements decrying the \n49\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 50 of 52\nmonitor’s role while this Court considers whether to approve the proposed decree—a time in \nwhich one would expect NYCHA to be on its best behavior—unearth fissures in the parties’ \ncollaborative front and foreshadow the beginning of prolonged judicial management of NYCHA \nthrough a monitorship whose costs may be limitless.   \nUltimately, whether the parties choose to address this public emergency through a \njudicially managed consent decree, a receivership under the U.S. Housing Act, or in some other \nway, it appears that half-measures that merely maintain the status quo while shielding the \npowers-that-be from politically unpalatable solutions are doomed to fail.  As discussed, HUD is \nnot blameless.  The City’s equivocal role in this settlement also bears mention.  It is a non-party \nclaiming to be bound only by its funding obligations while also maintaining that it has no legal \nobligation to provide any funds at all.  At the same time, the City’s Corporation Counsel extolled \nthe “unprecedented” nature of the proposed decree’s “item by item” negotiation that personally \ninvolved Corporation Counsel, the U.S. Attorney, and the Mayor of the City.  (July 10, 2018 \nHr’g Tr. at 44.)  Indeed, New York law puts the City much closer to the center of the action in \ngranting the Mayor the power to control NYCHA by appointing its chairperson and board, who \nserve at his pleasure.  Paige v. N.Y.C. Hous. Auth., 2018 WL 3863451, at *13 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. \n14, 2018) (citing N.Y. Pub. Hous. Law § 402(3)).  Finally, the State of New York lurks in the \nwings with $550 million that may help fund NYCHA’s capital needs.  The Governor—having \npreviously overhauled the Chicago Housing Authority during his tenure as HUD Secretary—\nmay well understand better than others what is at stake.\nTo be sure, this Court shares the parties’ doubts that any solution will offer an \nimmediate panacea, in large part due to NYCHA’s crippling $31.8 billion capital deficit and its \ninexplicable dysfunction in leaving untouched hundreds of millions of dollars allocated to it by \n50\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 51 of 52\nthe City.  But desperate times call for desperate—and sometimes politically unpopular—\nmeasures, whether that be exploring public-private housing partnerships, infill development, or \nthe sale of air rights.  Other measures may be necessary and even less palatable, such as \nreplacing NYCHA’s management or abrogating collective-bargaining agreements and vendor \ncontracts.  Any of these measures requires political will at all levels, from the HUD Secretary, to \nthe Governor, to the Mayor, and to NYCHA’s Interim Chair.  The well-being of more than \n400,000 New Yorkers depends on it. \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court does not reject the Proposed Consent Decree lightly.  The rejection of \nthis decree will likely delay sorely needed relief for NYCHA tenants while the parties decide \nwhether to re-negotiate, seek administrative remedies, litigate, or appeal, and a court’s refusal to \naccept a proposed consent decree may have “practical consequences for the government’s ability \nto negotiate future settlements.”  Microsoft Corp., 56 F.3d at 1456.  But as it stands, the proposed \ndecree suffers from fatal procedural flaws, including its formless injunctive relief and \nenforcement mechanisms.  The proposed decree also raises serious concerns implicating the \nseparation of powers and the delegation of equitable judicial power, which appear attributable at \nleast in part to the parties’ sidestepping of the existing statutory scheme to address public \nhousing failures.  And on a more basic level, the nature of the claims asserted by the Government \nraises questions as to the scope and applicability of Citigroup. \nAny judicial decree entered in this action will have a direct, tangible, and long-\nlasting impact not only on the parties, but most importantly on NYCHA’s tenants.  Because the \nProposed Consent Decree is not fair and reasonable, and because its entry would disserve the \npublic interest, the Government’s motion for approval is denied.  The parties are directed to \n51\n\nCase 1:18-cv-05213-WHP   Document 64   Filed 11/14/18   Page 52 of 52\nsubmit a joint status report by December 14, 2018 detailing their respective positions on how \nthey wish to proceed.
