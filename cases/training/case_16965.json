    "summary": "<p>On November 14, 2016, five prisoners in the Santa Clara County Jail system with mobility disabilities filed this class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs sued the County of Santa Clara under the American with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and state law. The plaintiffs, represented by Disability Rights Advocates and Rosen Bien Galvan & Grunfeld, sought declaratory relief that the County had violated their rights and injunctive relief prohibiting further violations. The plaintiffs claimed that the Santa Clara County Jail system did not provide adequate facilities for people with mobility disabilities. Specifically, the plaintiffs asserted that they were kept in restrictive medical units which prevented them from using jail facilities and common areas, were denied access to educational, religious, and rehabilitative programming due to their disabilities, were often denied access to devices intended to increase their mobility (including wheelchairs and canes), and did not have access to a functional grievance system to report any of these circumstances.</p><p>On April 13, 2017, the case was referred to mediation. From August 17, 2017 to May 31, 2018, Magistrate Judge Nathaniel M. Cousins presided over nine settlement conferences. </p><p>The parties' joint motion for class certification was approved by Judge Lucy H. Koh on February 6, 2018. The class of plaintiffs was defined as “[a]ll individuals with mobility disabilities who are now, or will be in the future, incarcerated in the Santa Clara County Jails, which consist of three facilities: (1) the Santa Clara County Main Jail Complex (“Main Jail”), consisting of Main Jail North and Main Jail South, in San Jose, California; (2) facilities for male inmates at the Elmwood Correctional Complex in Milpitas, California (“Elmwood”); and (3) the Elmwood Complex Women’s Facility in Milpitas, California.”</p><p>Following class certification, the parties jointly moved for a preliminary class settlement on November 13, 2018, which was approved by Judge Koh. The parties jointly moved for approval of a final settlement on January 14, 2019, and the court granted approval on March 21, 2019. The settlement consisted of a consent decree that required Santa Clara County to physically and administratively improve jail system so that the jails would be accessible to inmates with mobility disabilities. The consent decree required defendants to establish an electronic ADA grievance system, as well as a full-time ADA Coordinator to oversee all future issues related to inmates with mobility disabilities. Moreover, the decree provided for a fixed award of $3.2 million for plaintiff attorneys' fees.</p><p>The consent decree further directed Santa Clara County to incorporate accessibility features into a new jail, then slated for completion in 2023. The decree lasts until one year after the new jail goes into use.</p><p>In October 2020, amid public protests against police brutality, Santa Clara County tabled its plans for the new jail. County officials alternatively proposed creation of a mental health facility. However, a January 2021 report about inhumane prison conditions reportedly led county officials to resume plans for the new jail. See https://sanjosespotlight.com/santa-clara-county-wobbles-on-replacing-new-jail-with-mental-health-center. </p><p>As of November 2021, there has been no further activity on the docket. Because the new jail is presumably still under construction, this case is ongoing.</p>",

Plaintiffs bring this case to remedy the inaccessibility of the Santa Clara County \n10  Jail system (“County Jails,” “Jails,” or “Jail”) for inmates with mobility disabilities.  The Jail \n11  system is the fifth largest jail system in the State of California.  Due to the lack of accessible \n12  cells, showers, and living units in the County Jails, many individuals with mobility disabilities \nATES  LOOR1204  13   ar e  segregated in restrictive medical units despite the fact they do not require ongoing medical \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  care, a nd/or are held in higher security and more restrictive settings than they otherwise would be \nYRIGHTSA  S,FR TREET OCALIFORNIA  510)665-864   1156     breu  hta   fboi rl itt haeti ivr ed ipsraobgirliatmiess .d  uTeh etoy  pahrey sfiucrathl earn dd epnrioegdr aamccmesast itco  beadruriceartsi,o annadl,  crealnigniootu esv, eann du se the toilet \nTTE,Y (  \nDISABILI2001C ENBERKELE 1178   aarn ed  nsohto pwreorv isdaefedl yw dituhe a t om ae tlhaocdk  foofr a rcecqeusessibtilneg f ereaatusroensa. b Ilne mmaotdesif aicraet inoonts i ntofo promliecdi eosf  atnhde ipr rraigcthitcse, s, \n \n19  and are denied access to a functioning and meaningful grievance system.    \n20  2.  There are approximately 4,000 people incarcerated in the Jails at any given time \n21  and over 65,000 individuals are booked into the Jails every year.  The Jails include facilities at \n22  the Santa Clara County Main Jail Complex (“Main Jail”), consisting of Main Jail North and \n23  Main Jail South, in San Jose, California; facilities for male inmates at the Elmwood Correctional \n24  Complex in Milpitas, California (“Elmwood”); and the Elmwood Complex Women’s Facility in \n25  Milpitas, California (“Elmwood Women’s Facility”).  \n26  3.  In the entire County Jail system, there is not a single housing unit that is fully \n27  accessible in compliance with state and federal disability laws.  As a result, inmates with \n28  mobility disabilities cannot use the toilet safely and independently, take a shower safely and \n \n \n \n3041703-29  CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF  1 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 1   Filed 11/14/16   Page 3 of 58\n \n1  independently, or otherwise have equal or meaningful access to programs and services offered at \n2  the Jails. Further, this lack of accessible housing puts the physical safety of inmates with \n3  mobility disabilities at risk.  \n4  4.  Additionally, there is no functioning system of screening inmates upon intake to \n5  ensure inmates with mobility disabilities are identified and accommodated.  To the extent \n6  Defendants are able to identify individuals with mobility disabilities, the County Jails lack a \n7  system to track the location and needs of inmates identified as having a mobility disability, \n8  causing Jail staff to fail to accommodate the inmates’ disability needs..  \n9  5.  Inmates with mobility disabilities regularly are housed in a medical setting and/or \n10  a higher custody level than warranted based solely on their disability.  Inmates in the Main Jail \n11  with mobility disabilities who need a wheelchair are required to be housed in “special housing \n12  units” including the Main Jail Infirmary, Unit 2C (“Main Jail Infirmary”) and Main Jail Special \nATES  LOOR1204  13   H ou sing, Unit 2B (“Main Jail Special Housing”).  Additionally, medium security inmates with \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  mobil ity disabilities who need a wheelchair and who would otherwise be eligible for housing at \nYRIGHTSA  S,FR TREET OCALIFORNIA  510)665-864   1156     tihn  est el  easd s.   r e s trictive Elmwood facility are housed at in these special housing units at the Main Jail \nTTE,Y (  \nDISABILI2001C ENBERKELE 1178   fa cilitie6s .t hat arTeh, eo nM inaifno rJmaial tIinofni ramndar bye alinedf ,M thaei no nJlayil h Sopuesciniagl  aHt otuhsei nMga uinn iJtas ial rteh aeta cohff e3r0 a-bneyd  \n \n19  accessible features, such as grab bars, although these units are still not fully accessible.  \n20  Individuals housed in these units are generally held in their cells for 23 or more hours per day \n21  and are sometimes not let out at all.  These units do not provide access to programs, activities, \n22  and services, including educational, vocational, and rehabilitative programs available in other \n23  areas of the Main Jail or at Elmwood.  Similarly, minimum security level inmates with mobility \n24  disabilities who use a wheelchair are required to be housed in the Elmwood Minimum Security \n25  Camp Special Housing Unit (“Elmwood Special Housing”), which also is not fully accessible. \n26  7.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief against Defendants as a remedy \n27  for their systemic discrimination against inmates with mobility disabilities. Defendants \n28  discriminate in two predominant ways.  First, Defendants deny inmates with disabilities access to \n \n \n \n3041703-29  CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF  2 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 1   Filed 11/14/16   Page 4 of 58\n \n1  the County Jails’ programs, services and activities.  They do so at the Main Jail by segregating \n2  inmates who use wheelchairs, including inmates who would otherwise be eligible to be housed at \n3  the lower-security Elmwood, in the highly restrictive special housing units and by maintaining a \n4  physically inaccessible facility, the combination of which prevents inmates with mobility \n5  disabilities from participating in programs, services and activities at the Main Jail.  At Elmwood, \n6  the denial of access to the programs, services and activities offered is due mostly to the \n7  physically inaccessible campus, which is particularly troubling given the far greater amount of \n8  programming available at Elmwood.   \n9  8.  Second, Defendants discriminate by failing to modify their policies and \n10  procedures.  Defendants fail to identify and/or track inmates with mobility disabilities, making it \n11  virtually impossible to properly accommodate them.  Defendants have assistive device policies \n12  and procedures that result in inmates with mobility disabilities rarely, and certainly not in a \nATES  LOOR1204  13   ti me ly manner, receiving the assistive devices that they need.  Jail staff also lack the adequate \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  disabi lity-accommodation training, which only exacerbates Defendants’ failure to provide legally \nYRIGHTSA  S,FR TREET OCALIFORNIA  510)665-864   1156     rdei  qsau  biri elidt y a-cr ecloamtemd ogdriaetvioannsc.e  sD, reefnendderainntgs  tahlseo g lraiecvka cnlceea rs gysriteevma naclme poostl iucsieesle asns din p aroccheiedvuirnegs  afonry  sort \nTTE,Y (  \nDISABILI2001C ENBERKELE 1178   doef  nreiemde edqyu. a lA asn ad  rmeseualnt ionfg tfhuel saec caecstiso tnos  Danedfe onmdainsstsio’ npsr,o ignrmamatse,s s werivthic meso, bainldit ya cdtiisvaibtiielist,i eins calrued ing \n \n19  educational programs, vocational programs, health care services, mental health services, \n20  exercise, showers, recreational programs and religious services.     \n21  9.  Moreover, Defendants’ failure to modify its policies and procedures makes \n22  inmates with disabilities susceptible to exploitation and violence by other non-disabled inmates \n23  and increases the risk of serious injury or even death for inmates with disabilities.  \n24  10.  Defendants’ acts and omissions have resulted in the unequal treatment of, and \n25  severe harm to, individuals with mobility disabilities housed at the County Jails.  Such \n26  discrimination violates Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), Section 504 of \n27  the Rehabilitation Act (“Rehabilitation Act” or “Section 504”),  and California Government \n28  Code § 11153, et seq. \n   \n \n \n3041703-29  CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF  3 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 1   Filed 11/14/16   Page 5 of 58\n \n1  JURISDICTION \n2  11.

PLAINTIFF DAVID COLE \n20  15.  Plaintiff DAVID COLE has diabetes and Charcot neuropathy, or “Charcot foot,” \n21  a permanent condition caused by nerve damage related to diabetes.  As a result, Plaintiff COLE \n22  does not have sensation in his feet, and something as minor as a blister can lead to a serious \n23  infection in a matter of days.  It is extremely difficult for Plaintiff COLE to bear any weight on \n24  his feet as this can accelerate and exacerbate damage to his foot.  As a result of these conditions, \n25  which substantially limit Plaintiff COLE’s ability to walk and stand, Plaintiff COLE uses a \n26  wheelchair to move about.  Plaintiff COLE is a person with a disability as defined in 42 U.S.C. § \n27  12102, 29 U.S.C. § 705(9)(B), and California Government Code § 12926(1). \n28  16.  Plaintiff COLE has been detained at the County Jails since November 14, 2012.  \n \n \n \n3041703-29  CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF  4 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 1   Filed 11/14/16   Page 6 of 58\n \n1  During this time he was housed at the Main Jail Infirmary, Main Jail Special Housing, and \n2  Elmwood Special Housing.  Since approximately July 6, 2016, he has been housed in an early \n3  release residential treatment center.   \n4  17.  During his time in the County Jails, Plaintiff COLE has required reasonable \n5  modifications to policies and procedures necessary to ensure disability-related accommodations, \n6  including but not limited to a wheelchair, wheelchair-accessible facilities, wheelchair-accessible \n7  transportation, a shower chair, diabetic socks, Epsom salt foot soaks, insulin shots four times \n8  daily, and a diabetic diet.  As a result of Defendants’ failure to make reasonable modifications to \n9  policies and procedures, Plaintiff COLE has experienced substantial delays and other problems \n10  obtaining each of these required accommodations, and in some cases, as a result of Defendants’ \n11  failure to make reasonable modifications to policies and procedures, he has been denied \n12  necessary accommodations.   \nATES  LOOR1204  13      18.  For example, at Elmwood, in order to get his insulin shots, Plaintiff COLE had to \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  travel  to Elmwood’s pill call area at least four times daily over an inaccessible path of travel.

Contributing to the problem is that the wheelchair pushers have \n22  other jobs and, thus other obligations that prevent them from being available when needed.  As \n23  such, when no designated wheelchair pusher is available, Plaintiff COLE has had to rely on other \n24  inmates in Elmwood Special Housing, many of whom also had disabilities, to assist him, which \n25  put those inmates at risk of physical injury as well. \n26  19.  Plaintiff COLE also requires wheelchair-accessible vans when he is being \n27  transported to court, medical appointments, or other services outside of the Jail, but has not been \n28  consistently provided with accessible transportation.  For example, Jail staff failed to provide \n \n \n \n3041703-29  CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF  5 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 1   Filed 11/14/16   Page 7 of 58\n \n1  him with a wheelchair accessible van to transport him to a medical appointment.  Instead, Jail \n2  staff suggested that he use a non-accessible van that required him to step in and out of the van \n3  and go without his wheelchair to stabilize him.  He refused this arrangement because he feared \n4  for his physical safety and had to miss his medical appointment.    \n5  20.  When Plaintiff COLE was at the Main Jail, even after he had his wheelchair \n6  issued to him, Jail staff sometimes took it away from him.  As a result, Plaintiff COLE was left \n7  with no way to get around and without his wheelchair.  Consequently, Plaintiff COLE was \n8  excluded from many Jail programs, services, and activities, including Narcotics Anonymous and \n9  Alcoholics Anonymous.    \n10  21.  Plaintiff COLE was transferred to an early release program in July of 2016 to \n11  complete the rest of his jail sentence.  However, at any time, Plaintiff COLE may be removed \n12  from the program and returned to Elmwood or to the Main Jail, including for such minor \nATES  LOOR1204  13   of fe nses as arguing or violating dress code.  He can also be remanded for failing a routine drug \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  test.  P laintiff COLE has been in and out of the County Jails many times since 1989 for drug and \nYRIGHTSA  S,FR TREET OCALIFORNIA  510)665-864   1156     tthh  eef C  t co hua nrtgy e Jsa. i lAs.s    s u ch, he is qualified to participate in the programs, services and activities of \nTTE,Y (  \nDISABILI2001C ENBERKELE 1178     B22. .

As a result of these conditions, Plaintiff \n21  BENJAMIN, has, at various times, used a power wheelchair, walker, and cane for mobility \n22  assistance.  Plaintiff BENJAMIN also has sleep apnea, which substantially limits his ability to \n23  breathe and sleep, and so requires the use of a continuous positive airway pressure (“CPAP”) \n24  machine, which he used prior to coming to the Jails.  Plaintiff BENJAMIN currently uses a \n25  wheelchair for mobility and a cane to assist him with moving about in his cell.  Plaintiff \n26  BENJAMIN is a person with a disability as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 12102, 29 U.S.C. § \n27  705(9)(B), and California Government Code § 12926(1). \n28  23.

Plaintiff BENJAMIN repeatedly has been housed in cells without accessible \n9  features, such as grab bars, to allow him to use the toilet safely and independently.  For example, \n10  when he was housed in Main Jail South, he was placed in a cell with no grab bars to allow him to \n11  use the toilet safely.  Additionally, his current cell in Main Jail Special Housing only has a grab \n12  bar located directly behind the toilet and no side grab bar to allow him to safely lift himself on \nATES  LOOR1204  13   an d  off the toilet.  As a result, he is at risk of falling and injuring himself every time he uses the \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  toilet  and is forced to use his cane to try to stabilize himself.   \nYRIGHTSA  S,FR TREET OCALIFORNIA  510)665-864   1156     w  hi  ch  h2 a5s.   forceHde h himas  taol sgoo,  awt ivthaoriuotu ssh toimweerss,  boer etno  dpeunt iheidm asceclfe sast  trois akc ocfe sinsijbulrey  sdhuoew teor  tfhaec illaictike so,f  \nTTE,Y (  \nDISABILI2001C ENBERKELE 1178   gBr EabN JbAarMs aINnd f oirtsht earr rfievaetudr aets  tthhea tJ awilosu, lhde a wlloasw h hoiumse tdo  ibna Mthea isna fJealiyl .S  oFuotrh e fxoarm applper,o wxihmenat ePllya itnwtiof f \n \n19  weeks without access to a shower with accessible features such as grab bars.  \n20  26.

While housed in Unit 5B, Plaintiff FLORES was not only \n2  deprived use of a cane but was held in an inaccessible cell without features such as grab bars and \n3  without access to an accessible shower.  In Unit 5B, Plaintiff FLORES constantly was afraid of \n4  falling and injuring himself and came close to falling multiple times due to the lack of grab bars \n5  and his cane.  While housed in Elmwood, Plaintiff FLORES was also held in an inaccessible cell \n6  and was at risk of injuring himself due to the lack of grab bars in his cell.  Plaintiff FLORES’ \n7  current cell in Main Jail Special Housing is also not accessible because the only grab bar is \n8  located directly behind the toilet and there is no side grab bar to allow him to safely lift himself \n9  on and off the toilet.  As a result, he is at risk of falling and injuring himself every time he uses \n10  the toilet.   \n11  33.

As a result \n20  of this condition, which substantially limits his ability to walk and stand, Plaintiff WILLIAMS \n21  uses a wheelchair for mobility and is a person with a disability as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 12102, \n22  29 U.S.C. § 705(9)(B), and California Government Code § 12926(1). \n23  36.  Plaintiff WILLIAMS has been detained at the County Jails since August 12, 2016 \n24  and until approximately October 13, 2016 was housed in the Main Jail Infirmary despite the fact \n25  he did not require any ongoing medical care.  While housed in the Main Jail Infirmary, Plaintiff \n26  WILLIAMS was denied access to programs and services available to non-disabled inmates due \n27  solely to his disabilities including, but not limited to, day room and yard time, educational \n28  programs, and vocational programs.

Despite having been medically cleared prior to \n2  submitting his request for transfer and having been approved for transfer to Elmwood, he was not \n3  actually transferred for nearly a month.  Plaintiff WILLIAMS filed a grievance on this issue on \n4  October 7, 2016 which was denied on October 10, 2016 on the basis that he could not go to \n5  Elmwood because he is an un-sentenced felon and because he had not been medically cleared, \n6  which was inaccurate because he was medically cleared prior to submitting his grievance.  \n7  However, despite this response, Plaintiff WILLIAMS was nonetheless moved to Elmwood on \n8  approximately October 13, 2016.  Plaintiff WILLIAMS is currently housed in the Elmwood \n9  Special Housing unit where he continues to face barriers due to lack of clearance space for him \n10  to safely navigate his unit, cracked and broken pavement, a lack of accessible exercise \n11  equipment, and a lack of accessible yard space.   \n12  37.

PLAINTIFF ROBERT PHILLIPS \n21  39.  Plaintiff ROBERT PHILLIPS has slipped discs in his back and suffered multiple \n22  injuries in 2015, including nerve damage caused by a surgery on his neck, which cause him to \n23  drag his right foot when he walks.  He suffered additional physical injuries in 2015 to his legs \n24  and back as a result of two separate car accidents.  As a result of these conditions, which \n25  substantially limit his ability to walk, Plaintiff PHILLIPS uses a cane for mobility and is a person \n26  with a disability as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 12102, 29 U.S.C. § 705(9)(B), and California \n27  Government Code § 12926(1). \n28  40.  Plaintiff PHILLIPS has been detained at the Main Jail since July 25, 2016.

Without his cane it is difficult for Plaintiff PHILLIPS to keep his balance when he \n3  walks and he is at risk of falling and injuring himself.  When Plaintiff PHILLIPS initially arrived \n4  at the Jail, he was housed at the Main Jail in Unit 4C and was not assessed to determine whether \n5  he needed a cane.  Plaintiff PHILLIPS was initially housed in an inaccessible cell located on the \n6  upper tier, which required the use of stairs.  Jail staff also shackled Plaintiff PHILLIPS’ legs, \n7  which, in combination with his lack of cane and dragging foot, made it dangerous for him to \n8  walk and to navigate stairs.  As a result, Plaintiff PHILLIPS fell down the stairs and suffered \n9  injuries. Despite repeated requests, Plaintiff PHILLIPS was not issued a cane for nearly three \n10  months after being booked into the County Jails.  Once he was finally issued a cane, it was only \n11  on a temporary basis, and he has not been approved to use the cane permanently to date.  The Jail \n12  has also refused to give him the necessary medical documentation, known as a “chrono,” to \nATES  LOOR1204  13   en su re he is housed in a lower bunk and on a lower tier.   \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14   41.

This \n20  makes it incredibly dangerous for him to move about because his right foot drags when he walks \n21  which, combined with the shackles on his feet, can cause him to lose his balance.  Since July 25, \n22  2016, Plaintiff PHILLIPS has fallen multiple times due to the shackles and his lack of a cane for \n23  support.  He is unable to brace himself for a fall due to the shackles and, each time he has fallen, \n24  he was knocked unconscious by the force. \n25  42.  At any time, Plaintiff PHILLIPS may be transferred from the Main Jail to \n26  Elmwood or vice versa.

Defendants Discriminate Against Inmates with Mobility Disabilities \n2 \n1.  At Main Jail Facilities, Defendants’ Unnecessary Segregation of Inmates \nwith Disabilities Combined with the Facility’s Physical Inaccessibility \n3 \nDenies Inmates with Disabilities Access to Programs, Services and \nActivities. \n4 \n5  58.  Inmates with mobility disabilities are unnecessarily segregated due to (1) \n6  Defendants’ practice of prohibiting the use of wheelchairs at the Main Jail outside of the Main \n7  Jail Infirmary and Main Jail Special Housing; and (2) the physical inaccessibility of the Main Jail \n8  facilities.  Because of this segregation, inmates with mobility disabilities are denied access to \n9  Defendants’ programs, services and activities. \n10  Defendants’ Limits on Assistive Devices \n11  59.  Inmates with mobility disabilities who require assistive devices are regularly \n12  housed in a medical setting and in a higher level of custody due solely to their disability and need \nATES  LOOR1204  13   fo r  an assistive device such as a wheelchair.  \nDVOCFURTH 94704-4  14     60.

Upon information and belief, in practice \n20  inmates who rely on certain assistive devices, such walkers, canes, crutches and prostheses, are \n21  now being allowed to  retain these devices when housed outside of the Special Housing units.  \n22  However, inmates who rely on wheelchairs continue to be restricted to the Special Housing units. \n23  61.  Rather, at the Main Jail, inmates who use wheelchairs for mobility are typically \n24  housed in either the Main Jail Infirmary or Main Jail Special Housing, both of which are \n25  segregated units for inmates with disabilities.  Inmates in the Main Jail Infirmary and Main Jail \n26  Special Housing units are extremely isolated and often locked in their cells for 23 or more hours \n27  per day and sometimes not allowed out at all. \n28  62.

As such they are denied access to the additional programs, services, and activities \n3  offered at Elmwood, which are not available at Main Jail.  \n4  63.  These special housing units are not the most integrated settings appropriate to the \n5  needs of inmates with mobility disabilities.  Defendants’ policy of placing inmates who use \n6  wheelchairs in these units has resulted in Plaintiffs and many other inmates with mobility \n7  disabilities being unnecessarily segregated into highly restrictive special housing units in the \n8  Main Jail and places many more such inmates at serious risk of unnecessary segregation.  \n9  Physical Inaccessibility of Defendants’ Main Jail Facilities \n10  64.  The County Jails’ facilities were assessed in 2015 by experts at Sabot Consulting \n11  to identify barriers at the Jails related to mobility disabilities (“Report”).    \n12  65.  Main Jail North is not physically accessible to inmates with mobility disabilities.  \nATES  LOOR1204  13   A cc ording to the Report, typical physical barriers observed in Main Jail North include: (1) doors, \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  includ ing cell doors and doors to visiting areas, that are too narrow for wheelchairs; (2) \nYRIGHTSA  S,FR TREET OCALIFORNIA  510)665-864   1156     min  aanc  cnee srs  tihba let  ftaoiillse ttso  apnrdo vlaidvea taodreieqsu dautee  ctloe aar laanccke  offo rg raa pbe brsaorsn,  wimitphr oap mero pboilsitiyti odnisinabg iolift yt,o ialnedts  ginra ab  \nTTE,Y (  \nDISABILI2001C ENBERKELE 1178   b(4a )r ss haonwd elarsv athtoarti easre w inhaicchc easrsei bnloet  dpureo vtoid ceudr bats  tohre  lciposr,r elacct kh eoifg ghrt;a b(3 b) arrasm, lpasc kw oitfh s ehxocwesesr isveea stslo, panesd;  \n \n19  lack of spray hose; (5) tables in day rooms and in the chapel that are inaccessible due to a lack of \n20  knee space; (6) inaccessible visiting areas that are not usable by wheelchair users due to the \n21  presence of a fixed stool; (7) call buttons and telephones that are placed too high for a wheelchair \n22  user to reach; (8) lack of clearance in the law library; (9) lack of accessible routes; and (10) lips \n23  at thresholds that present a barrier to wheelchair users and a tripping hazard to persons using \n24  canes, walkers, or other mobility assistive devices.  \n25  66.  Main Jail South is also not physically accessible.  According to the Report, typical \n26  physical barriers observed in Main Jail South include: (1) cell doors that are too narrow for \n27  wheelchairs; (2) inaccessible toilets and lavatories due to a lack of grab bars and improper \n28  positioning of toilets in a manner that fails to provide adequate clearance for a person with a \n \n \n \n3041703-29  CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF  17 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 1   Filed 11/14/16   Page 19 of 58\n \n1  mobility disability; (3) ramps with excessive slopes; (4) showers that are inaccessible due to \n2  curbs or lips, lack of grab bars, lack of shower seats, and lack of spray hose; (5) tables in day \n3  rooms and in the chapel that are inaccessible due to a lack of knee space; and (6) inaccessible \n4  visiting areas that are not usable by wheelchair users due to the presence of a fixed stool.  \n5  67.  Inmates who are medium security and higher and who require wheelchairs are \n6  housed in either the Main Jail Infirmary or Main Jail Special Housing.  These are the only \n7  housing units in the Main Jail facilities that contain cells and showers with some accessible \n8  features, such as grab bars.  However, these units still contain physical barriers for inmates with \n9  mobility disabilities and are not fully accessible.  For example, both Plaintiff BENJAMIN and \n10  Plaintiff FLORES are housed Main Jail Special Housing in cells where the toilet is missing a \n11  side grab bar to allow them to safely lift themselves on and off the toilet.  Instead, the only grab \n12  bar is located directly behind the toilet, which is of no practical use.  As a result, Plaintiff \nATES  LOOR1204  13   B EN JAMIN and FLORES, who both use wheelchairs, are at risk of falling and injuring \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  thems elves every time they use the toilet. \nYRIGHTSA  S,FR TREET OCALIFORNIA  510)665-864   1156     as   a   ca n6 e8, . m  ay Ibned hivoiudsueadls o autt sthidee M ofa itnh eJ aMila winh Joa uils Ien afsirsmisatirvye o dre Mviaciens  Jbaeisli Sdepse cai awl hHeoeulcshinaigr.,   such \nTTE,Y (  \nDISABILI2001C ENBERKELE 1178   Hsh oowweevres ra, nthde tsoei luentsi ttso a arlel onwot i ancmcaetsessib wlei ttho  minombailtietys  wdiistahb diliistaiebsi ltioti ebsa athned  alnacdk g gor taob  tbhaer sb ainth trhoeo m \n \n19  safely.  For example, Plaintiff PHILLIPS uses a cane due to his mobility disability and is \n20  currently housed in Unit 5A in a cell without grab bars and without an accessible shower.  \n21  Plaintiff PHILLIPS was previously held in Unit 4C in a cell that also lacked grab bars and where \n22  he did not have access to an accessible shower.  Another inmate who uses a cane due to a \n23  mobility disability has been held in Main Jail South on the seventh floor and in Units 4B and 4C \n24  at the Main Jail; in all of these locations, this inmate was housed in cells without an accessible \n25  toilet with grab bars and without access to an accessible shower. \n26  69.  Upon information and belief, Defendants did not conduct a full and \n27  comprehensive Self-Evaluation of the Main Jail and/or a Transition Plan for the Main Jail in \n28  compliance with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and/or Section 504 of the \n \n \n \n3041703-29  CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF  18 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 1   Filed 11/14/16   Page 20 of 58\n \n1  Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and/or California Government Code § 11135.   \n2  Denial of Programs, Services and Activities Due to Segregation \n3  70.  Inmates with disabilities segregated in these restrictive units – due either to the \n4  policy prohibiting wheelchairs or due to physical inaccessibility – are excluded from the range of \n5  programs available to inmates housed in the general population units.  Because these inmates are \n6  sometimes locked in their cell for the entire day, they are denied access to even basic services \n7  and activities, including showers, phone calls, and recreation.  At the Main Jail, few programs \n8  are made available to inmates with mobility disabilities who are housed in the segregated, highly \n9  restrictive units due to their need for wheelchairs. \n10  71.  In particular, inmates with mobility disabilities housed in the Main Jail Infirmary \n11  and Main Jail Special Housing Unit are not provided with equal, and in some cases any, access \n12  to: (1) the recreational library or law library; (2) religious programming; (3) commissary; (4) \nATES  LOOR1204  13   vi si ting, including attorney visiting; (5) recreational activities, including yard, dayroom, \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  teleph ones, and recreational reading; and (6) inmate programs and work assignments.  \nYRIGHTSA  S,FR TREET OCALIFORNIA  510)665-864   1156     M  ai  n  Ja7 il2 .S  peciTahl eH oonulsyi nfgo romr athl ep rMogarianm Jsa iol fIfnefriermd taor yi nadriev liidmuiatlesd w toit hs edlfis-satbuidliyti ewso hrokubsoeodk sin t hthaet  do \nTTE,Y (  \nDISABILI2001C ENBERKELE 1178   no t invo7l3v.e  leavFionrg e oxnaem’sp lcee, lPl.l  a intiff BENJAMIN is housed in Main Jail Special Housing and is \n \n19  currently denied access to the full spectrum of rehabilitative and educational programs offered at \n20  the Jail that would allow him to earn certificates of completion.

Inmates who are housed in the Main Jail Infirmary and in Main Jail Special \n3  Housing due to their need for wheelchairs are also denied access to the less formal services \n4  offered in the Jails because they are housed in units where they are let out of their cells for an \n5  hour or less per day and sometimes not at all.   \n6  75.  For example, because of their disabilities and the physical inaccessibility of the \n7  showers, inmates with mobility disabilities often need additional time to shower.  Because \n8  inmates who use wheelchairs are housed in restrictive, segregated units at the Jails and therefore \n9  generally have an hour or less out of their cells, these individuals are frequently forced to choose \n10  between calling loved ones or their attorneys, socializing with other inmates and taking care of \n11  basic needs such as showering.

Plaintiff BENJAMIN has been held in Main Jail Special Housing in a cell by \n27  himself for at least 23 hours per day.

Individuals who use wheelchairs and are medium security, and who would \n5  otherwise be eligible to be housed at Elmwood, are instead held above their custody level at \n6  Main Jail in the highly restrictive special housing units discussed above due solely to their \n7  disability. As such these medium-security inmates with disabilities are denied access to the many \n8  additional programs, services, and activities offered at Elmwood.   \n9  84.  Minimum security inmates who use wheelchairs, however, are housed at \n10  Elmwood, but are restricted to Elmwood Special Housing.  Elmwood Special Housing is not \n11  fully accessible and contains physical barriers for inmates with mobility disabilities.  Elmwood \n12  Special Housing consists of 16 beds and shared restroom facilities.

For example, Plaintiff COLE experienced barriers when housed in Elmwood \n20  Special Housing because the bunks are arranged too close together, thus limiting or even \n21  precluding physical access to the bunks for people who use wheelchairs, walkers, or other \n22  mobility aids.  Plaintiff WILLIAMS has also experienced barriers related to the lack of sufficient \n23  clearance for wheelchair users. \n24  86.  Individuals at Elmwood who do not need wheelchairs are typically held in the \n25  minimum security camp barracks and medium security units, but these units and barracks are not \n26  fully accessible to inmates with mobility disabilities, including lacking grab bars in showers and \n27  toilets as described above.   Nonetheless, inmates who have mobility disabilities requiring \n28  accessible features have been housed in these inaccessible units and barracks.   \n \n \n \n3041703-29  CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF  22 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 1   Filed 11/14/16   Page 24 of 58\n \n1  87.  Elmwood’s recreational facilities are also inaccessible for inmates with mobility \n2  disabilities.  For example, Plaintiff COLE could not wheel himself to Elmwood’s large yard \n3  because the path of travel was too uneven and the pavement was broken in places, requiring him \n4  to ask a fellow inmate to push him.  The yard itself was not accessible to him because it is one \n5  big grassy area with bumpy and uneven dirt paths.  Additionally, a curb leading to the yard and \n6  the absence of ramps prevented safe access to the yard.  The inmate helping him tried to back \n7  Plaintiff COLE’s wheelchair over the curb into the grass and dirt, causing Plaintiff COLE to \n8  nearly fall out of his wheelchair.  Ultimately, Plaintiff COLE had to stay in his wheelchair on the \n9  grass.  Plaintiff WILLIAMS has experienced similar barriers.  Plaintiff WILLIAMS has also \n10  experienced barriers accessing the special housing unit yard due to lack of an accessible path of \n11  travel and lack of accessible exercise equipment. \n12  88.

Traveling to the classroom areas or medical facilities is even more \n21  inaccessible in the rain, as pushing a wheelchair with wet wheels on an already barrier-ridden \n22  path can become dangerous and impossible.  Also, when Elmwood does not clean up debris – \n23  such as tree limbs – after a storm, it makes it even more difficult for inmates with mobility \n24  disabilities to travel. \n25  89.  Due to the fact that these programs are not offered in a location or manner that is \n26  accessible to inmates who need assistive devices, inmates with disabilities are unable to work to \n27  reduce their sentences in the same manner as their nondisabled peers and may also be unable to \n28  comply with court-ordered requirements to participate in certain programs.  For example, \n \n \n \n3041703-29  CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF  23 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 1   Filed 11/14/16   Page 25 of 58\n \n1  Plaintiffs COLE and WILLIAMS have both been housed in Elmwood Special Housing due to \n2  their need for a wheelchair.  Both Plaintiffs COLE and WILLIAMS have been forced to travel \n3  along an inaccessible path in order to get to pill call to get necessary medications, or to get to \n4  classrooms to participate in other programs.  As a result, Plaintiff COLE had to use all his energy \n5  to wheel himself to pill call and did not have energy remaining to wheel himself to classes.  After \n6  repeated requests to access programs, Jail staff recently arranged for an inmate to push Plaintiff \n7  COLE’s wheelchair to classes for the Regimented Correctional Program (“RCP Program”) and \n8  to pill call.  Plaintiff WILLIAMS has recently also been provided with a wheelchair pusher to get \n9  him to medical appointments, pill call, and classes.  This proposed solution of a wheelchair \n10  pusher does not allow for Plaintiffs COLE and WILLIAMS to independently access classrooms \n11  and services; instead, they must rely on other inmates, thereby increasing their risk of being \n12  exploited by those inmates.  Wheelchair pushers are not always available to assist inmates who \nATES  LOOR1204  13   us e  wheelchairs and the wheelchair pusher program does nothing to obviate the obstacles \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  presen ted to a person who uses a cane, walker, or other assistive device for mobility.  \nYRIGHTSA  S,FR TREET OCALIFORNIA  510)665-864   1156     Adu  ded   tioti  othn ea l clyra, cthkee dw ahnede lucnheavire np upsahveerm perongt.r a Fmo rd eoxeas mnoptl ep, rtehvee fnrto dnat mwahgeee lt oo fa nP lianimntaiftfe ’Ws wILhLeIeAlcMhaSir’  \nTTE,Y (  \nDISABILI2001C ENBERKELE 1178   wpu hseheeldch ianitro w anas a dreaam wagitehd c wrahciklee dh ep awvaesm beenint gan pdu hshise dw thoe eal  mweadsi cbaeln at pfrpoomin tcmolelnidt iwngh ewni thhe  twhea s \n \n19  uneven section.  \n20  90.

Defendants have no comprehensive system for identifying and tracking \n21  individuals with mobility disabilities and the accommodations and modifications they require.  \n22  As such, Defendants fail to provide the assistive devices needed and/or take away such assistive \n23  devices without warning, and fail to provide appropriate housing for inmates with mobility \n24  disabilities. \n25  95.  During the intake process, staff are supposed to identify inmates with disabilities \n26  using the Medical Authorization Form.  However, the form does not allow staff to identify all \n27  potential needed accommodations.  Additionally, Jail staff have not been properly trained on \n28  how to identify people with disabilities, or how to use these forms, and therefore frequently fail \n \n \n \n3041703-29  CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF  25 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 1   Filed 11/14/16   Page 27 of 58\n \n1  to identify inmates with disabilities and/or the reasonable modifications they need to access Jail \n2  programs and services.  The current screening process is also not confidential and deters inmates \n3  with mobility disabilities from self-reporting disabilities.  For instance, Jail staff have, upon \n4  information and belief, persistently failed to identify several older individuals who have great \n5  difficulty walking as needing a cane or other mobility aid, despite the fact at least one of them \n6  had been allowed to use a cane for six years while in state prison.  Finally, the screening area \n7  itself is physically inaccessible. \n8  96.  There is also no centralized electronic repository for approved Medical \n9  Authorization Forms, which document disability information.  Instead, only the inmate and the \n10  housing unit deputy/officer have copies of these forms. To the extent that Defendants maintain \n11  information about an inmate’s disabilities in any form, custody, medical, and clerical staff are \n12  not provided with access to the information in a manner that would timely and effectively inform \nATES  LOOR1204  13   th em  of an inmate’s disabilities and required reasonable modifications.

Defendants’ Policies Relating to Assistive Devices Must Be \nModified In Order to Avoid Discriminating Against Persons with \n24  Mobility Disabilities.  \n25  98.  Defendants have failed to modify their practice of prohibiting the use of \n26  wheelchairs at the Main Jail outside of the highly restrictive Main Jail Infirmary and Main Jail \n27  Special Housing units.  Defendants have also failed to modify their policy requiring medium \n28  security inmates who use wheelchairs to be housed at the Main Jail even where such inmates \n \n \n \n3041703-29  CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF  26 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 1   Filed 11/14/16   Page 28 of 58\n \n1  would otherwise be eligible for housing at Elmwood. \n2  99.  Additionally, Defendants have failed to consistently provide inmates with needed \n3  assistive devices, even after Defendants have identified the person as having a disability and as \n4  needing a particular assistive device.     \n5  100.  Multiple inmates with mobility disabilities housed at the Main Jail have been \n6  denied access to needed assistive devices, including canes and walkers.  As detailed in the \n7  Report, an inmate with partially amputated feet has had his cane taken from him at booking and \n8  was not promptly issued a replacement.  Another inmate at Main Jail South with Myasthenia \n9  Gravis, a muscular disease, had his cane taken away from him at booking and was not promptly \n10  issued a replacement.  Another inmate was denied access to a cane for nearly a year and a half \n11  while housed in Main Jail South and on the fourth and seventh floors of the Main Jail despite the \n12  fact that he lacks muscle in his legs due to injuries that left him partially paralyzed.  Plaintiff \nATES  LOOR1204  13   P HI LLIPS was denied access to his cane for nearly three months despite repeated requests while \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  house d in the Main Jail in Unit 5C.

Stump socks are \n20  critical to ensuring that the prosthetic limb does not damage the skin of the edge of the body \n21  which attaches to the prosthetic limb.  If a person with a prosthetic leg does not have stump \n22  socks, the prosthetic limb can wear on the remaining skin, causing ulcers and infections that can \n23  become serious enough so as to require amputation.  For his first four months in Main Jail \n24  Special Housing, this inmate had to ask family members to mail him stump socks because Jail \n25  staff would not provide them to him. \n26  102.  Upon information and belief, Defendants did not initially identify an individual \n27  with an amputated foot as needing reasonable modifications to policies and procedures necessary \n28  to ensure disability-related accommodations.  Jail staff took away his prosthetic leg and the \n \n \n \n3041703-29  CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF  27 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 1   Filed 11/14/16   Page 29 of 58\n \n1  special shoe for his prosthetic when he entered the Jail, making it extremely difficult for this \n2  individual to walk.  While he eventually got his prosthesis back, his leg had become infected and \n3  too inflamed for him to use it.  As a result, he was not able to ambulate to the library to attend \n4  classes. \n5  103.  Where the Jails do provide an inmate with an assistive device, Defendants often \n6  unjustifiably and abruptly take these devices away from inmates.  For example, staff in the Main \n7  Jail Infirmary suddenly took away Plaintiff COLE’s wheelchair, thus leaving him no means of \n8  getting around.  Jail staff returned it to him only when a family member called the Jail to \n9  advocate on his behalf.  \n10  104.  Upon entering the Main Jail, Defendants identified Plaintiff BENJAMIN as an \n11  inmate with a disability and as needing a wheelchair.  However, he was initially housed in Main \n12  Jail South and was not provided with a wheelchair or other assistive device when he was there \nATES  LOOR1204  13   ex c ept for when he had to go to court or other appointments outside of Main Jail South.

Lastly, staff confiscated Plaintiff BENJAMIN’s wheelchair when he was housed in \n21  the mental health unit, Unit 8A, on two separate occasions, forcing him to crawl on the ground to \n22  transport himself. \n23  105.  Staff in Main Jail Special Housing suddenly took away another prisoner’s cane \n24  for periods of up to several weeks, despite knowing that he could barely move without it and \n25  despite the fact that Defendants had previously approved his use of the cane.  Jail staff also took \n26  away a different inmate’s wheelchair.  Jail staff then rehoused both of the men in the Main Jail, \n27  where both men were effectively bedridden without their assistive devices and consequently \n28  were denied access to showers, phones, programs and recreation time.   \n \n \n \n3041703-29  CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF  28 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 1   Filed 11/14/16   Page 30 of 58\n \n1  106.  Similarly, Defendants have on multiple occasions taken away another inmate’s \n2  brace and sling and moved him out of his lower bunk into an upper bunk, despite being aware \n3  that he needed these reasonable modifications to policies and procedures necessary to ensure \n4  disability-related accommodations.  Staff in Main Jail Special Housing suddenly, and without \n5  explanation, ripped off that inmate’ velcro arm brace and sent him to the Main Jail general \n6  population, where he suffered increased pain and decreased strength in his broken arm with no \n7  brace or support for it.  That inmate was also given a top tier bunk, meaning that he frequently \n8  had to climb a set of stairs to reach his bunk – a dangerous situation given his epilepsy and \n9  inability to hold on to the rail due to his injured arm.  Both while in the Main Jail and at \n10  Elmwood, he was denied a bottom bunk.  In both places, due to his disabilities, he fell from his \n11  top bunk onto the hard floor below.   \n12  107.  Another individual, who was approved for corrective shoes due to the fact that his \nATES  LOOR1204  13   le gs  are not the same length, was only briefly allowed to use the shoes before Defendants took \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  them  away without explanation.

Defendants have also taken away the specialized shoe of an individual with a \n22  prosthetic leg even though he required this shoe to keep the foot of his prosthesis in working \n23  order.  Defendants withheld the shoe for two weeks, and during that time, the individual \n24  struggled to walk, and the foot of his prosthesis developed deep scrapes and tears.  Eventually \n25  the Jail staff returned his shoe, but by then, his prosthetic foot was destroyed to the point that he \n26  had to replace his expensive prosthesis.   \n27  109.  Defendants fail to consider inmates’ specific needs and abilities in assigning \n28  assistive devices, to the detriment of those inmates’ overall health and safety.  For example, \n \n \n \n3041703-29  CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF  29 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 1   Filed 11/14/16   Page 31 of 58\n \n1  when Plaintiff COLE entered Elmwood, he was given a boot for Charcot foot, even though he \n2  asked for and needed a wheelchair.  As a result, he had to walk on his affected foot, which \n3  rapidly deteriorated until Plaintiff COLE needed a wheelchair and additional medical attention \n4  soon thereafter.  When another inmate with a mobility disability first arrived at Main Jail Special \n5  Housing, he was allowed to use his wheelchair, until Jail staff took it away from him after \n6  approximately five months and gave him a cane to use instead.  Jail staff told him his ankle \n7  would gain strength if he walked on it, but walking with a cane exacerbated this individual’s \n8  ankle injury and caused it to swell.  Although he could walk short distances with the cane, he \n9  needed a wheelchair to travel long distances, which the Jail refused to provide.  Another inmate \n10  was provided with a cane after nearly a year and a half at the Jail but was then told he could only \n11  use it to travel long distances and was not allowed to use it on his unit.  Without his cane he is at \n12  risk of losing balance due to a lack of muscle in his legs as a result of injuries that partially \nATES  LOOR1204  13   pa ra lyzed him. \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14   110.

Plaintiff COLE was eventually given a functioning wheelchair, though it was too \n20  small for his size and weight and was, therefore, physically uncomfortable. \n21  111.  Additionally, for two weeks while housed in Main Jail South, Plaintiff \n22  BENJAMIN was being denied access to a wheelchair or any other assistive device on his \n23  housing unit.  Instead he was provided with a hospital wheelchair intended to be pushed by a \n24  caregiver or a person that aids the user in order to go to and from court and other medical \n25  appointments.  This type of wheelchair has only four tiny wheels, which made it nearly \n26  impossible for Plaintiff BENJAMIN to propel himself on his own.  In order to move without \n27  assistance, therefore, Plaintiff BENJAMIN had to use his feet to scuttle forward and back on his \n28 \n \n \n \n3041703-29  CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF  30 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 1   Filed 11/14/16   Page 32 of 58\n \n1  own, which was very painful.  In comparison, a wheelchair with two large back wheels is \n2  designed to allow the user to propel himself with his arms without assistance. \n3  112.  Another individual at the Main Jail who relied on the use of a wheelchair was \n4  given one that lacked a footrest, which he needed, and that was generally in very poor condition.    \n5  The lack of a footrest made it difficult for him to use the wheelchair to move about and keep his \n6  feet safe. \n7  113.  The Jail has also failed to consistently provide accessible transportation to \n8  inmates with mobility disabilities.  Plaintiff COLE requires a wheelchair-accessible van with a \n9  ramp or lift and proper securement for his wheelchair, but the Jail failed to provide him with one \n10  to transport him to a medical appointment.  As a result, Plaintiff COLE had to miss his medical \n11  appointment or else face potential physical injury.  Plaintiff WILLIAMS was physically injured \n12  while being transported to court due to the failure of Jail staff to properly secure his wheelchair.  \nATES  LOOR1204  13   B ec ause he was improperly secured inside the van, his wheelchair flipped over during transport \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  with h im in it and he missed his court hearing because he had to go to the hospital instead.   \nYRIGHTSA  S,FR TREET OCALIFORNIA  510)665-864   1156     eq  ua  l  ac1 c1e4 s.s , inBmeactaeuss we iotfh  Ddiesfaebnidliatnietss ’a fraei lsuursec etop tmiboled itfoy  eixtsp plooiltiactiieosn a bnyd  optrhoecre idnumreast etso.  e Inns ure \nTTE,Y (  \nDISABILI2001C ENBERKELE 1178   einx mchaatensg ew fiothr  dhieslapb gileittiteinsg h taov eth bee teoni,l efto, rs hinoswtaenrc, eo,r r meqeuailrse,d o tro c poamym outhneicr aitnimnga twesit.h  prison staff, \n \n19  115.  To the extent the Jail has disability-related policies and procedures in place, the \n20  County fails to adequately train Jail staff regarding such policies and procedures.  The lack of \n21  proper training is evident in the failure of staff to provide legally required accommodations.  For \n22  example, staff at the Main Jail do not consistently allow assistive devices outside of the Main Jail \n23  Infirmary and Main Jail Special Housing.  One inmate with a mobility disability housed in the \n24  Main Jail on the fourth floor was not allowed to have his cane for over a year.  When he was \n25  finally provided with his cane, Jail staff would not permit him to use it in his housing unit it.  He \n26  is still only allowed to use it when he leaves his housing unit, and he is required to check it in \n27  and out with custody officers when he returns to and leaves his unit to go elsewhere in the \n28  facility.

Jail staff are also not adequately trained regarding how to properly secure \n4  a wheelchair user for transportation, as discussed above.    \n5 \nc.  Defendants Lack an Effective Grievance Procedure for Inmates \n6  to Request Reasonable Modification. \n7  116.  Defendants do not provide an effective or functional grievance system for inmates \n8  with disabilities and do not have a disability-specific grievance process or any way for an inmate \n9  to mark their grievance as disability-related.  There is no expedited process for disability-related \n10  grievances that are emergent in nature and there is no process for provision of interim \n11  accommodations for inmates during the time that the disability-related grievance is being \n12  processed and considered.  \nATES  LOOR1204  13      117.

Inmates are directed to \n22  request grievance forms from the Housing Unit Officer and to deliver completed grievances to \n23  any officer on their unit.  If the grievance is denied, inmates are told they may appeal the \n24  decision by “writing a letter to the Facility Captain.”  The Rulebook does not specify what \n25  should be in this letter or provide an address for the Facility Captain, and inmates are not \n26  provided with envelopes or stamps to allow them to mail their appeals.  Jail staff are not \n27  adequately trained or informed about this procedure and so are unable to assist inmates with the \n28  logistics of any appeals.  As a result of these deficiencies the appeals process is functionally \n \n \n \n3041703-29  CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF  32 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 1   Filed 11/14/16   Page 34 of 58\n \n1  unavailable to inmates.  \n2  118.  The Inmate Orientation and Rulebook does not contain any information regarding \n3  what process inmates with mobility disabilities should use to request disability-related \n4  accommodations except for a statement that inmates with hearing impairments may request \n5  accommodations such as assistive listening devices and interpreters.  No other information \n6  regarding inmates’ rights under the ADA is provided.  Because inmates are not made aware of \n7  the process, they make requests for accommodations using whatever means are available to \n8  them, including verbally, through medical request forms known as white cards, and through the \n9  grievance process detailed above. Until recently, inmates were charged three dollars to obtain \n10  and submit a “white card” and it is not clear if the County Jails intend to reinstitute such an \n11  illegal charge. \n12  119.  For example, Plaintiff PHILLIPS was not provided with any information at \nATES  LOOR1204  13   or ie ntation regarding how to request assistive devices.  In order to obtain his cane, Plaintiff \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  PHILL IPS filed multiple requests using medical request forms and grievances.

Another inmate requested an ADA Accommodations Form so that he \n20  could get his cane back and in response a nurse told him that the Jail did not have any such form, \n21  leaving him without a means to officially make his request.  Without a consistent and effective \n22  method to request reasonable accommodations or modifications, these inmates are denied timely, \n23  equal, and meaningful access to Defendants’ programs, services, and activities. \n24  121.  In addition, Defendants routinely deny inmates with mobility disabilities access to \n25  grievance forms that these inmates need to request reasonable modifications to policies and \n26  procedures.  Such modifications are necessary to ensure that the inmates receive the disability-\n27  related accommodations to which they are entitled.  In order to obtain grievance forms at the \n28  County Jails, inmates either have to ask a custody officer in their unit for one, or hope that the \n \n \n \n3041703-29  CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF  33 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 1   Filed 11/14/16   Page 35 of 58\n \n1  forms will be available in the common areas of their housing unit, which is rare.  This sporadic \n2  availability means inmates cannot reliably access grievance forms, particularly during times \n3  when they are not let out of their cells into the common areas.  For example, one inmate went \n4  days without being let out of his cell, and when he has asked Jail staff for grievance forms, they \n5  did not provide them.  \n6  122.  Even when inmates are able to submit grievances with regard to disability \n7  discrimination, Defendants frequently do not provide any response or the response is so delayed \n8  that it is not meaningful.  For instance an inmate who uses a specialized shoe that fits his \n9  prosthetic leg filed a grievance after his specialized shoe was taken away.  While he waited for a \n10  response to this grievance, his prosthetic leg was damaged to the point of having to be \n11  completely replaced.  Plaintiff BENJAMIN submitted grievances only to have responses to those \n12  grievances returned to a different inmate on his unit. \nATES  LOOR1204  13      123.

This is a real concern because \n20  guards control access to the grievance forms and completed forms must be turned in to custody \n21  staff, even if it is the same staff member about whom the inmate is filing a grievance.  \n22  Grievances are in no way kept confidential and may be read by any staff member on the unit.  \n23  Female inmates with mobility disabilities have had guards take their belongings or ransack their \n24  rooms in response to receiving grievances.  Other inmates with mobility disabilities are afraid \n25  they will lose the little access to programs they have if they file grievances.   \n26  125.  Plaintiff PHILLIPS suffered retaliation after filing a grievance related to \n27  accessibility issues.  After Plaintiff PHILLIPS turned in his grievance to the deputy on his unit, \n28  the deputy slammed his cell door on him while he was standing in the door way, which caused \n \n \n \n3041703-29  CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF  34 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 1   Filed 11/14/16   Page 36 of 58\n \n1  Plaintiff PHILLIPS to fall and injure his back.  A few days later, a deputy grabbed Plaintiff \n2  PHILLIPS from behind while he was cutting his own hair with hair clippers and his head was \n3  down, which caused him to cut himself.  When Plaintiff PHILLIPS asked to see a doctor and to \n4  report the use of force, the deputy refused to let him do so and then locked down the unit, which \n5  requires all inmates to return to their cells and stops all programming.  The deputies then \n6  announced to the other inmates that the lockdown was caused by Plaintiff PHILLIPS and \n7  proceeded to allow Plaintiff PHILLIPS and approximately half of the other inmates out of their \n8  cells.  Due to the deputies’ announcement, the other inmates were angry at Plaintiff PHILLIPS \n9  and he felt his safety was at serious risk.  Following the filing of his grievance, County Jail staff \n10  also confiscated all of Plaintiff PHILLPS’ personal property and documents from his cell, \n11  including his legal documents, past grievances, and medical records including documentation of \n12  his disability and disability-related needs.

All Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf and, pursuant to Rule 23(a), \n25  (b)(1), and (b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, on behalf of a class of all individuals \n26  with mobility disabilities who are substantially limited in the major life activities of walking, \n27  standing, lifting, and/or ambulating who are now, or will be in the future, incarcerated in the \n28  County Jails (the “Class”).   \n   \n \n \n3041703-29  CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF  35 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 1   Filed 11/14/16   Page 37 of 58\n \n1  Numerosity:  Fed.

The exact number of members of the \n4  Class is unknown.  However, according to data from the United States Census conducted in \n5  2010, more than 3.7 million Californians and more than 155,000 Santa Clara County residents \n6  identify as having a physical disability.  According to the 2010 Census, approximately 10% of \n7  Americans have some mobility impairment.  Based on available census data, approximately 10% \n8  of the inmates in the Jail, which averages 4,000 inmates per day, are qualified individuals with \n9  mobility disabilities as that term is defined in 42 U.S.C. § 12102, 29 U.S.C. § 705(20), and \n10  California Government Code § 12926(j) and (m). \n11  130.

Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in the \n26  foregoing paragraphs as if specifically alleged herein.   \n27  139.

The term “disability” includes physical and mental impairments that substantially \n4  limit one or more major life activities.  42 U.S.C. § 12102(2).  The named Plaintiffs and the \n5  Plaintiff Class represent people who have mobility disabilities that substantially limit the major \n6  life activities of walking, standing, lifting, and/or ambulating.  Additionally, Plaintiffs and the \n7  Plaintiff Class, as inmates in the County Jails, are all qualified – with or without reasonable \n8  modifications – to participate in the programs, services, and activities that the County Jails \n9  offered.  Thus, members of the Plaintiff Class are, and Plaintiffs represent, qualified individuals \n10  with disabilities within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 12102, 42 U.S.C. § 12131, and 28 C.F.R. § \n11  35.104.    \n12  141.

Congress directed the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) to write \n22  regulations implementing Title II’s prohibition against discrimination.  42 U.S.C. § 12134.  \n23  Pursuant to this mandate, the DOJ has issued regulations defining the forms of discrimination \n24  prohibited by Title II of the ADA.  28 C.F.R. § 35.101 et seq. These regulations include \n25  regulations specific to adult detention and correctional facilities.  28 C.F.R. § 35.152. \n26  143.

Instead, these inmates are \n22  housed in the more restrictive Main Jail Infirmary and Main Jail Special Housing units.  As such \n23  they are denied access to the more expansive programs offered at Elmwood. \n24  151.  A public entity may not (1) “impose or apply eligibility criteria that screen out or \n25  tend to screen out an individual with a disability or any class of individuals with disabilities from \n26  fully and equally enjoying any service, program, or activity, unless such criteria can be shown to \n27  be necessary[,]” 28 C.F.R.§ 35.130(b)(8); or (2) “utilize criteria or methods of administration . . . \n28  that have the effect of subjecting qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the \n \n \n \n3041703-29  CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF  40 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 1   Filed 11/14/16   Page 42 of 58\n \n1  basis of disability . . . or the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing \n2  accomplishment of the objectives of the public entity’s program with respect to individuals with \n3  disabilities[.]”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3)(i)(ii). \n4  152.  By requiring that inmates at the Main Jail must reside outside of the Main Jail \n5  Infirmary and Main Jail Special Housing to be allowed to fully and equally enjoy the educational \n6  and rehabilitative programs and basic services offered, Defendants have imposed eligibility \n7  criteria that screens out individuals with disabilities.

Moreover, Defendants “solution” to the inaccessibility at Elmwood – the wheelchair \n25  pushers – also violates the law since it provides an aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective \n26  in affording equal opportunity as that provided to others because inmates with mobility \n27  disabilities must rely on wheelchair pushers.  Such reliance deprives them of independence that \n28  other non-disabled inmates have.

Additionally, upon information and belief, \n3  multiple educational and vocational programs offered at Elmwood are not accessible to inmates \n4  with mobility disabilities due to physical barriers at the program facilities such as stairs or \n5  inadequate clearance space. \n6  158.  In addition, public entities responsible for the operation or management of adult \n7  detention and correctional facilities “shall ensure that qualified inmates or detainees with \n8  disabilities shall not, because a facility is inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with \n9  disabilities, be excluded from participation in, or be denied the benefits of, the services, \n10  programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any public entity.” \n11  28 C.F.R. § 35.152(b)(1). \n12  159.  Because of the inaccessibility of the Main Jail, inmates with mobility disabilities \nATES  LOOR1204  13   ar e  denied the benefits of Defendants’ programs, services and activities in two ways.

Similarly, in Elmwood Special Housing, educational or rehabilitative programs \n22  are denied because of the presence of physical barriers.  In order to access such programs, which \n23  are available to their nondisabled peers, inmates with disabilities at Elmwood must travel \n24  outdoors for at least 100 yards to the classroom area of Elmwood.  The path of travel to the \n25  classroom area is not accessible due to barriers such as broken pavement, steep curb cuts and \n26  heavy doors.  This path of travel is even more inaccessible in the rain, as pushing a wheelchair \n27  with wet wheels on an already barrier-ridden path can become dangerous and impossible.  Also, \n28  when Elmwood does not clean up debris – such as tree limbs – after a storm, it makes it even \n \n \n \n3041703-29  CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF  43 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 1   Filed 11/14/16   Page 45 of 58\n \n1  more difficult for inmates with mobility disabilities to travel.  While Defendants have recently \n2  provided wheelchair pushers, wheelchair pushers are not always available such that inmates \n3  traveling along the path to the classroom may become stranded due to heavy doors that they are \n4  unable to open due to their disability.  In addition, there is no guarantee that a wheelchair pusher \n5  will be able to safely traverse the inaccessible pathway and thus, the dangers of an inaccessible \n6  path remain.  The denial of physical access to the educational and rehabilitative programs at \n7  Elmwood is by reason of disability because these architectural barriers affect only inmates with \n8  disabilities. \n9  161.  A public entity “shall make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or \n10  procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of \n11  disability[.]”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7). \n12  162.

Defendants’ failure to modify Defendants’ policies and practices \n4  disproportionately burdens Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class by reason of their disabilities.  But \n5  for the fact that Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class have disabilities, they would not require these \n6  reasonable modifications which they are being denied.    \n7  165.  The regulations implementing Title II of the ADA also require public entities to \n8  prepare and implement a Self-Evaluation and Transition Plan to evaluate and improve the \n9  accessibility of their facilities.  A Self-Evaluation must “evaluate current services, policies and \n10  practices, and the effects thereof, that do not or may not meet the requirement of this part and, to \n11  the extent modification of any such services, policies, and practices is required, the public entity \n12  shall proceed to make the necessary modifications.”  23 C.F.R. § 35.105(a).

Upon information and belief, Defendants have failed to conduct a full and \n22  comprehensive Self Evaluation and Transition Plan with a complete and up-to-date schedule for \n23  providing physical and program access in the County Jails.  Upon information and belief, \n24  Defendants have also failed to make a copy of their Transition Plan available for public \n25  inspection, in violation of 28 C.F.R. § 35.150(d)(1). \n26  167.  Pursuant to 28 C.F.R. § 35.149 “[n]o qualified individual with a disability shall, \n27  because a public entity’s facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with disabilities, \n28  be excluded from participation in, or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or \n \n \n \n3041703-29  CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF  45 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 1   Filed 11/14/16   Page 47 of 58\n \n1  activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any public entity.”  Additionally, \n2  pursuant to 28 C.F.R. § 35.150(a), Defendants must “operate each service, program, or activity \n3  so that the service, program, or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and \n4  usable by individuals with disabilities.” \n5  168.

The regulations implementing Title II of the ADA also require that alterations that \n4  commence on or after September 15, 2010 to jails, prisons, and other detention and correctional \n5  facilities may comply with the DOJ’s 2010 Standards.  28 C.F.R. § 35.151(c)(2).  Alterations \n6  that commence on or after March 15, 2012 must comply with the DOJ’s 2010 standards.  28 \n7  CFR § 35.151(c)(3).  The 2010 Standards are defined to include the requirements set forth in \n8  appendices B and D to 36 CFR part 1191 (2009) (known as the “2004 ADAAG”) and the \n9  requirements contained in 28 CFR § 35.151.  28 CFR § 35.104.   Specifically, pursuant to 28 \n10  U.S.C. § 35.151(k)(2), altered cells with mobility features shall be provided in each classification \n11  level, although public entities may satisfy this obligation by providing the required mobility \n12  features in cells other than those where alterations were originally planned.

Upon information and belief, the County Jails have altered cells after the \n23 \napplicable dates without installing the required mobility features in compliance with 28 U.S.C. § \n24 \n35.151(k). \n25 \n176.  With respect to medical and long-term care facilities in jails, prisons, and other \n26 \ndetention and correctional facilities, public entities are required to apply the 2010 Standards \n27 \ntechnical and scoping requirements for those facilities, irrespective of whether those facilities are \n28 \nlicensed, for alterations and construction occurring after the applicable dates.  28 U.S.C. § \n \n \n \n3041703-29  CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF  47 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 1   Filed 11/14/16   Page 49 of 58\n \n1  35.151(k)(3).

Reasonable modifications would include but are not limited to: (1) \n10  modifying policies and practices that do not allow inmates who use wheelchairs and housed in \n11  segregated units to participate in rehabilitative and educational programs; (2) modifying housing \n12  policies and practices so that assistive devices, including wheelchairs, are allowed in all units, (3) \nATES  LOOR1204  13   m od ifying assistive device policies and practices to allow the use of wheelchairs in all units such \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  that th e use of wheelchairs would not limit housing options; (4) implementing an \nYRIGHTSA  S,FR TREET OCALIFORNIA  510)665-864   1156     iads  esni  sttiif vice a dti eovni/cteras cpkoinligc iseys sstoem th faot rs urecahs odnevabiclees m woidlli fbicea ptiroonvsid iend t haen dC nooutn rtyem Jaoivlse;d ( 5w)h meno ddiefeyminegd  \nTTE,Y (  \nDISABILI2001C ENBERKELE 1178   nfoe re dineddi vinid aulal lasr aeraes  iodfe tnhteif iJeadil ;a n(6d)  ipmropvleimdienngt esdta fpfr otrpaeinrliyn;g a tnod e (n7s)u mrea tkhiantg r ethaes ognraiebvlea nmceo dsiyfsicteamtio ns \n \n19  effective for inmates with disabilities including by adding a method for grievances to be marked \n20  as disability-related.   \n21  193.  Defendants’ failure to modify Defendants’ policies and practices \n22  disproportionately burdens Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class by reason of their disabilities.   \n23  194.  Because Defendants’ discriminatory conduct is ongoing, declaratory relief and \n24  injunctive relief are appropriate remedies.  Further, as a direct result of Defendants’ actions, \n25  Plaintiffs and members of the Plaintiff Class are suffering irreparable harm, including lost \n26  educational and rehabilitative opportunities.  Therefore, speedy and immediate relief is \n27  appropriate.    \n28  195.

California Government Code section 11135 sets forth a nondiscrimination policy \n9  for state programs.  It provides, in pertinent part, that: \n10  [n]o person in the State of California shall, on the basis of race, \nnational  origin,  ethnic  group  identification,  religion,  age,  sex, \n11  sexual  orientation,  color,  genetic  information  or  disability,  be \nunlawfully denied full and equal access to the benefits of, or be \n12 \nunlawfully  subjected  to  discrimination  under,  any  program  or \nATES  LOOR1204  13      abcyt iavnityy s tthaatet  iasg ceonncyd,u icst efdu,n odpeder datieredc, tolyr  badym thine issttaetree,d o br yr etcheei vsteast ea noyr  \nDVOCFURTH 94704-4  14      financial assistance from the state.

Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class were, at all times relevant to this action, and are \n20  currently “persons in the State of California” within the meaning of California Government Code \n21  section 11135.  Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class all have disabilities as defined by California \n22  Government Code section 12926, and they were and/or are all residents of the County Jails \n23  qualified to participate in the programs, services and activities of the County Jails. \n24  200.  Defendants have violated the rights of Plaintiffs and members of the Plaintiff \n25  Class secured by Section 11135 et seq. and the regulations promulgated thereunder, 22 Cal. Code \n26  Regs. § 98100, et seq. \n27  201.  It is a “discriminatory practice” for a recipient of state financial assistance, “in \n28  carrying out any program or activity,” on the basis of disability, “(a) to deny a person the \n \n \n \n3041703-29  CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF  52 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 1   Filed 11/14/16   Page 54 of 58\n \n1  opportunity to participate in, or benefit from an aid, benefit or service; (b) to afford a person the \n2  opportunity to participate in or benefit from an aid, benefit or service that is not equal to that \n3  afforded others; (c) to provide a person with an aid, benefit or service that is not as effective in \n4  affording an equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the \n5  same level of achievement as that provided to others . . . [or] (g) to otherwise limit a person in \n6  the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage or opportunity enjoyed by others receiving any \n7  aid, benefit or service resulting from the program or activity.”  22 Cal. Code Regs. § 98101 (a), \n8  (b), (c), (g). \n9  202.  When Plaintiffs and members of the Plaintiff Class are placed in Main Jail Special \n10  Housing, Main Jail Infirmary, and/or Elmwood Special Housing, Defendants exclude them from \n11  participating in and deny them the benefits of Defendants’ educational and rehabilitative \n12  programs, services, and activities solely by reason of their disabilities.  Inmates who use \nATES  LOOR1204  13   w he elchairs segregated in the Main Jail Infirmary and Main Jail Special Housing are housed in \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14  highly  restrictive units, where they are routinely locked in their cells for 23 hours per day, due \nYRIGHTSA  S,FR TREET OCALIFORNIA  510)665-864   1156     smo  eled  liyu  mto   steh ceuirr idtyis aabreil nitoyt.  a Ablded tioti obnea hlloyu, siendm aatt eEsl mwwhoo oudse e wvehne eifl cthhaeiyr sw aonudl da roet hcelarswsiisfiee bde a es ligible \nTTE,Y (  \nDISABILI2001C ENBERKELE 1178   aDn edf eanrde atnhtuss’  dacetniioends  aacncde sosm tois tshioen asd ddeitnioyn Palla pinrotigffrsa mansd a tnhde  aPcltaiivnittiifefs  Cavlaasisla tbhlee  oapt pEolmrtuwnoitoyd t.o   \n \n19  participate in services, programs or activities that are not separate and different from those \n20  offered to their nondisabled peers.   \n21  203.  Defendants also deny inmates with mobility disabilities access to programs and \n22  activities due to the physical inaccessibility of the Main Jail and Elmwood. Due to physical \n23  barriers at the Main Jail inmates with mobility disabilities are frequently housed in inaccessible \n24  cells and without access to accessible showers.  Inmates with mobility disabilities at Elmwood \n25  are denied access to programs and activities due to barriers in the path of travel throughout \n26  Elmwood and due to physical barriers including steps and insufficient clearance space in some \n27  classrooms and other facilities where programs are offered.  \n28  204.  It is also a “discriminatory practice” for a recipient of state financial assistance “to \n \n \n \n3041703-29  CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF  53 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 1   Filed 11/14/16   Page 55 of 58\n \n1  utilize criteria or methods of administration that: (1) have the purpose or effect of subjecting a \n2  person to discrimination on the basis of disability; (2) have the purpose or effect of defeating or \n3  substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the recipient’s program with \n4  respect to a person with a disability.”  22 Cal. Code Regs. § 98101(i). \n5  205.  By denying individuals with disabilities access to wheelchairs and other needed \n6  modifications to Defendants’ policies and procedures outside of the Main Jail Infirmary and \n7  Main Jail Special Housing units, Defendants deny inmates with mobility disabilities who require \n8  wheelchairs access to programs and services and lock them in a cell for 23 or more hours per \n9  day.  As such, Defendants utilize methods of administration that have the effect of subjecting \n10  Plaintiffs and members of the Plaintiff Class to discrimination by reason of their disabilities.  .  \n11  These methods of administration also have the purpose and effect of defeating or substantially \n12  impairing accomplishments of the objectives of Defendants’ educational and rehabilitative \nATES  LOOR1204  13   pr og rams, services, and activities with respect to Plaintiffs and members of the Plaintiff Class. \nOCFH 04-  \nDVURT9474  14   206.

Defendants have further violated California Government Code § 11135 by failing \n22  to prepare and maintain a compliant Self-Evaluation and a compliant Transition Plan pursuant to \n23  the requirements of Cal. Code Regs. Tit. 22 §§ 98251 and 98258. \n24  208.  Defendants  have also discriminated on the basis of disability in violation of  \n25  Government  Code § 11135 by constructing, altering, or repairing parts of the Jail in a manner \n26  that violates the accessibility requirements of Title 24 of the California Building Standards Code \n27  and California Government Code § 4450. \n28  209.

Because Defendants’ discriminatory and wrongful conduct is ongoing, \n6  declaratory and injunctive relief are appropriate remedies.  Further, as a direct result of \n7  Defendants’ actions, Plaintiffs and members of the Plaintiff Class are suffering irreparable harm, \n8  including lost education and rehabilitative opportunities.  Therefore, speedy and immediate relief \n9  is appropriate.   \n10  211.

The parties also submitted a proposed Notice \n21  to the class, attached as Exhibit B to the Consent Decree.  \n22  On December 6, 2018, this Court held a Preliminary Approval hearing in the above-\n23  captioned action. See ECF No. 70. During the hearing, the Court ordered the parties to (1) file a \n24  declaration affirming that Defendant complied with the notice requirements of the Class Action \n25  Fairness Act (“CAFA”) of 2005; (2) file a corrected Consent Decree that fixed a typographical \n26  error that resulted in the Consent Decree § VIII citing to 28 U.S.C. § 3626 instead of 18 U.S.C. § \n27 \n1 \n28  Case No. 16-CV-06594-LHK    \nORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF CLASS SETTLEMENT AND NOTICE TO \nTHE CLASS \n\n \n1  3626; and (3) file a revised Notice that provided that objectors must also include their name, \n2  address, and signature in any objections. In addition, the parties stated that they wished to add \n3  language from the Northern District of California’s Procedural Guidance for Class Action \n4  Settlements that the Court could only approve or reject the settlement and could not change the \n5  terms of the settlement.  \n6  On December 6, 2018, Defendant filed a declaration affirming that it provided the requisite \n7  CAFA notice on December 6, 2018. ECF No. 71. On December 7, 2018, Plaintiff filed a \n8  declaration that attached as Exhibit 1 a corrected version of the Consent Decree that fixed the \n9  typographical error (referred to below as the “corrected Consent Decree”). ECF No. 72, Ex. 1 \n10  (“corrected Consent Decree”). Additionally, the corrected Consent Decree included as Exhibit B \n11  the revised Notice that updated the original proposed Notice to require that objectors include their \n12  name, address, and signature in any objections and added language that the Court may only \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  approve or deny the Consent Decree and cannot change the terms of the Consent Decree (referred \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  to below as the “revised Notice”).

This action is determined to be properly maintained as a class action pursuant to \n20  Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Court has already certified a class \n21  defined as “All individuals with mobility disabilities who are now, or will be in the future, \n22  incarcerated in the Santa Clara County Jails, which consist of three facilities: (1) the Santa Clara \n23  County Main Jail Complex (“Main Jail”), consisting of Main Jail North and Main Jail South, in \n24  San Jose, California; (2) facilities for male inmates at the Elmwood Correctional Complex in \n25  Milpitas, California (“Elmwood”); and (3) the Elmwood Complex Women’s Facility in Milpitas, \n26  California.” ECF No. 38. \n27 \n2 \n28  Case No. 16-CV-06594-LHK    \nORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF CLASS SETTLEMENT AND NOTICE TO \nTHE CLASS \n\n \n1  2.  The corrected Consent Decree, ECF No. 72, Ex. 1, falls within the range of \n2  possible approval and is sufficiently fair to warrant the dissemination of notice to the class \n3  members apprising them of the settlement. \n4  3.  The corrected Consent Decree, ECF No. 72, Ex. 1, is the product of arm’s-length, \n5  serious, informed and non-collusive negotiations between experienced and knowledgeable counsel \n6  who have actively prosecuted and defended this litigation. \n7  4.

Budgetary allocation of over $100 million dollars to ADA jail \nimprovements (not including the planned New Jail facility, which \nthe County plans to build on the current Main Jail South location); \n                                              \n1 Defendant here was erroneously sued as Defendant County of Santa Clara, the Santa \nClara County Department of Correction, and the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office. \n   1   \n[3269262.19] Cole v.

Defendant shall permit Plaintiffs’ Counsel reasonable access \nto tour the jail facilities, interview staff and inmates, and \nobserve practices related to Defendant’s compliance with the \nprovisions of this Consent Decree.  Plaintiffs’ Counsel shall \nhave reasonable access to interviews of staff and inmates to \nensure a full evaluation.  Interviews with inmates shall be \nconducted confidentially.

Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s tours will not exceed more than three (3) \ntours annually. \nc.  Each tour shall last no more than two (2) days and be \nconducted by no more than one (1) Plaintiffs’ attorney or, \nalternatively, one (1) staff member.

Plaintiffs’ \nCounsel will provide Defendant’s counsel with 7 days \nadvance notice of tour. \n2.  Requests for Documents and Individual Advocacy \na.  Defendant shall provide Plaintiffs’ Counsel with access to \nrecords, reports, and documents that the Parties agree and \nidentify are necessary to evaluate Defendant’s ongoing \ncompliance with the Remedial Plan.  If the Parties cannot \nagree on the necessary documents, the Parties will meet and \nconfer to address any disagreements.  The Parties shall \ncooperate so that such access is provided without unduly \nburdening Defendant.  Defendant shall provide Plaintiffs’ \nCounsel with such information within 14 days of the request, \nunless a longer period of time is necessary. \n   8   \n[3269262.19] Cole v. County of Santa Clara Consent Decree\n\n \nb.  Where Plaintiffs’ Counsel has a good faith basis for doing so, \nPlaintiffs’ Counsel may bring individual inmates’ disability \naccommodation concerns to the attention of the County in \nwriting, who shall respond in writing within 14 days.  This \nprocess is not meant to replace or circumvent the existing \nprocesses for submitting grievances or ADA requests to jail \nstaff.

Defendant will provide Plaintiffs’ Counsel with the following \nreports:  (a) a monthly report from the ADA Tracking \nSystem, identifying all inmates with Mobility Disabilities and \nthe accommodations received, where the inmates are housed, \nand to which programs the inmates are assigned; (b) on a \ntriannual basis, copies of all ADA-related inmate grievances \nand the written responses to the inmate grievances; and (c) on \na triannual basis, copies of all ADA-related Inmate Request \nForms and the written responses to these requests. \nb.  Production of the reports identified in subpart (a) of this \nprovision is derived from the current ADA Tracking System, \nand the Parties acknowledge that the current ADA Tracking \nSystem is not integrated with the electronic medical record or \nother custody-based electronic systems and, thus, there are \ninformation sharing challenges that will not be cured until \nDefendant implements the planned electronic jail \nmanagement software. \nc.  Within 30 days of the Effective Date of the Consent Decree, \nthe Parties shall meet and confer to determine a list of any \nadditional documents necessary for Plaintiffs’ Counsel to \nevaluate Defendant’s compliance with the Remedial Plan that \nwill be produced on a periodic basis as well as the frequency \nfor such productions. \nB.  Monitoring by Operational Monitor \n1.  Within three months of the execution date, the Parties shall jointly \nagree upon a Monitor (“Operational Monitor”) who will monitor \nDefendant’s compliance with the operational aspects of the \nRemedial Plan for the Term of this Consent Decree. \n   9   \n[3269262.19] Cole v. County of Santa Clara Consent Decree\n\n \n2.  If, for any reason, the Operational Monitor can no longer serve or \nthe Parties jointly wish to engage a different monitor, the Parties \nshall attempt to agree on who shall be appointed to serve as the \nreplacement monitor. \n3.  If the Parties are unable to agree on the replacement monitor, the \nParties shall each submit a list of two (2) proposed new Operational \nMonitor candidates, all of whom will have already agreed to be \nsubject to, and comply with, the Defendant’s contracting \nrequirements, to the Honorable Magistrate Judge Nathaneal Cousins.  \nPrior to submitting their respective lists to Judge Cousins, the Parties \nagree to meet and confer to ensure that each proffered candidate is \neligible to be considered.  If a proposed candidate is found to be \nineligible due to his or her inability or unwillingness to comply with \nthe County’s contractual requirements or due to a conflict of interest, \nthe Party who proposed that candidate will be given an opportunity \nto propose an alternative candidate for consideration.  The Parties \nwill submit written suggestions to Judge Cousins as to who to select \nfrom the lists.  Judge Cousins shall then select the new Operational \nMonitor from the lists. \n4.  Once the Operational Monitor is selected, the Operational Monitor \nwill conduct two tours within the first year of the Execution Date of \nthe Consent Decree and thereafter conduct biannual tours and \nprogram reviews.  Plaintiffs’ Counsel shall have the right to attend \nthe tours.  The Parties may jointly agree in writing to conduct \noperational monitoring on a less frequent basis if the Parties agree \nsuch reduction is appropriate based on the current circumstances. \n5.  Prior to the Operational Monitor’s visit, Defendant shall advise the \nOperational Monitor which subjects are Unratable-In Progress and \nprovide a brief reason why the subject(s) is not ready for evaluation \nof Substantial Compliance/Non-Compliance.  The Operational \nMonitor shall still have the right to review the status of subjects \nDefendant has declared to be Unratable-In Progress. \n6.  The Operational Monitor will prepare a written report within 45 days \nafter monitoring that will evaluate the extent to which Defendant has \nsuccessfully implemented substantive provisions of the Remedial \nPlan and any plans to effectuate its terms, and recommend specific \nactions the Operational Monitor believes Defendant must make to \nachieve Substantial Compliance with the Remedial Plan.  The \nOperational Monitor shall report on whether, as to each material \n   10   \n[3269262.19] Cole v. County of Santa Clara Consent Decree\n\n \nprovision, the County is in Substantial Compliance, Unratable-In \nProgress, or Non-Compliance as those terms are defined herein. \n7.  The Parties will have twenty-one (21) days to make written \ncomments or objections to the Operational Monitor report.  The \nOperational Monitor shall have twenty-one (21) days to respond to \nthe Parties’ comments or objections by issuing a final report. \n8.  The Operational Monitor will conduct three tours of the New Jail \nunless the Parties agree that a third tour is unnecessary.  The \nOperational Monitor will conduct the first tour of the New Jail \nwithin thirty (30) days after the County begins occupancy of the \nNew Jail.  The Operational Monitor will conduct the second tour of \nthe New Jail as soon as he or she determines that there are sufficient \nnumbers of inmates housed at the Jail to allow a meaningful \nevaluation of the New Jail’s compliance with this Consent Decree, to \nthe extent that has not occurred at the time of the first tour.  The \nOperational Monitor will conduct a third tour unless the Parties \nagree that a third tour is unnecessary.  The Operational Monitor will \nprepare a written report within thirty (30) days after each tour that \nwill evaluate the extent to which Defendant has successfully \nimplemented substantive provisions of the Remedial Plan in the New \nJail and any plans to effectuate its terms, and recommend specific \nactions that the Operational Monitor believes Defendant may need to \nmake, if any, to achieve Substantial Compliance with the Remedial \nPlan.  The Operational Monitor shall report on whether, as to each \nmaterial provision, the County is in Substantial Compliance, \nUnratable-In Progress, or Non-Compliance, as those terms are \ndefined herein.  The Parties will have fourteen (14) days to make \nwritten comments or objections to this report.  The Operational \nMonitor shall have fourteen (14) days to respond to the Parties’ \ncomments or objections by issuing a final report. \nC.  Monitoring of Physical Alterations to Current Jails \n1.  Within three months of the Execution Date, the Parties shall jointly \nagree upon a Monitor with architectural accessibility expertise \n(“Architectural Monitor”) who will monitor Defendant’s compliance \nwith the physical access portion of the Remedial Plan in the context \nof construction and/or alterations to the Jails for the duration of the \nTerm of this Consent Decree. \n2.  If, for any reason, the Architectural Monitor can no longer serve or \nthe Parties jointly wish to engage a different monitor, the Parties \n   11   \n[3269262.19] Cole v. County of Santa Clara Consent Decree\n\n \nshall attempt to agree on who shall be appointed to serve as the \nreplacement monitor. \n3.  If the Parties are unable to agree on the replacement monitor, the \nParties shall each submit a list of two (2) proposed new Architectural \nMonitor candidates, all of whom will have already agreed to be \nsubject to, and comply with, the Defendant’s contracting \nrequirements, to the Honorable Magistrate Judge Nathaneal Cousins.  \nPrior to submitting their respective lists to Judge Cousins, the Parties \nagree to meet and confer to ensure that each proffered candidate is \neligible to be considered.  If a proposed candidate is found to be \nineligible due to his or her inability or unwillingness to comply with \nthe County’s contractual requirements or due to a conflict of interest, \nthe Party who proposed that candidate will be given an opportunity \nto propose an alternative candidate for consideration.  The Parties \nwill submit written suggestions to Judge Cousins as to who to select \nfrom the lists.  Judge Cousins shall then select the new Architectural \nMonitor from the lists. \n4.  Defendant has provided and continues to provide the Architectural \nMonitor with copies of architectural drawings (“plans”) for \nconstruction and/or physical alterations within the Jails covered by \nthe Remedial Plan. \n5.  Defendant may consult directly with the Architectural Monitor \nregarding the plans and/or alterations for the Jails.  If Defendant and \nthe Architectural Monitor have a dispute regarding the plans and/or \nalterations for the Jails, or reach a determination that technical \ninfeasibility exists, Defendant shall advise Plaintiffs of these \ncommunications. \n6.  The Parties may agree to exclude specific projects from the plan \nreview requirements. \n7.  Defendant anticipates that the planned construction will be \ncompleted in January 2022 at the earliest.  The planned construction \nis highly dependent on third-party contractors, and this time estimate \nis not binding. \n8.  Defendant will request that the Architectural Monitor conduct \nperiodic site visits to review completed work as major projects or \ngroups of projects are completed.  Plaintiffs’ Counsel may \naccompany the Architectural Monitor on these visits.  The \nArchitectural Monitor shall confirm in a written report, provided to \n   12   \n[3269262.19] Cole v. County of Santa Clara Consent Decree\n\n \nthe Parties within 45 days, whether each part of the completed work \nis ADA Accessible. \n9.  The Parties will have twenty-one (21) days to provide written \ncomments or objections to the Architectural Monitor’s report.  The \nArchitectural Monitor shall have twenty-one (21) days to respond to \nthe Parties’ comments or objections by issuing a final report. \n10.  Once the physical alteration projects are complete, the Architectural \nMonitor determines compliance, and the Dispute Resolution Process, \nif applicable, is complete, Defendant is no longer subject to \nmonitoring for physical alterations. \nD.  Monitoring of Construction of the New Jail \n1.  Defendant anticipates that the New Jail will be completed in 2023.  \nConstruction of the New Jail is highly dependent on third-party \ncontractors, and this time estimate is not binding. \n2.  After construction of the New Jail, the Architectural Monitor will \nconduct a site visit within thirty (30) days of completion of \nconstruction on the New Jail, and prepare a written report provided \nto the Parties within forty-five (45) days, evaluating whether each \npart of the completed work is ADA Accessible as required under the \nRemedial Plan.  Plaintiffs’ Counsel may accompany the \nArchitectural Monitor on this site visit. \n3.  The Parties will have twenty-one (21) days to provide written \ncomments or objections to the Architectural Monitor reports.  The \nArchitectural Monitor shall have twenty-one (21) days to respond to \nthe Parties’ comments or objections by issuing a final report. \nVI.  Attorney’s Fees and Costs \nA.  No later than ninety (90) days after the Effective Date, the County agrees to \npay Plaintiffs’ Counsel the fixed sum of $1 million to cover and fully \nresolve any and all of Plaintiffs’ and Plaintiffs’ Counsels’ claims against \nthe County for attorney’s fees and costs incurred or attributable to any and \nall work from any time prior to the filing of this Action (including any \nclaims from the structured negotiations phase), up through and including \nthe Effective Date of this Consent Decree (hereinafter, “past fees”). \nB.  No later than ninety (90) days after the Effective Date, the County shall pay \nthe fixed sum of $2.2 million to cover and fully resolve any and all of \nPlaintiffs’ and Plaintiffs’ Counsels’ claims against the County for \n   13   \n[3269262.19] Cole v. County of Santa Clara Consent Decree\n\n \nattorney’s fees and costs incurred or attributable to any and all work \nperformed by anyone from the Effective Date of this Consent Decree up \nthrough and including the end of the Term, as Term is defined in Section \nVIII (hereinafter, “future fees”).  These future fees shall be paid, using wire \ninstructions stated at Section VI.B.1, into the Cole Jail Monitoring \nQualified Settlement Fund (“QSF”), established by or on behalf of \nPlaintiffs’ Counsel.  Plaintiffs’ Counsel warrants and represents to the \nCounty that the QSF is a duly constructed and authorized Internal Revenue \nCode Section 468B Qualified Settlement Fund, as defined by Internal \nRevenue Code Section 468-B and the associated Treasury Reg. 1.468B-1 of \nthe Internal Revenue Code, and is qualified to receive this settlement \npayment for future fees.  Plaintiffs’ Counsel shall defend and indemnify the \nCounty, and hold the County harmless, with respect to any claims, \ndemands, causes of action, suits, debts, liabilities, fees, taxes, charges, \nlosses, or costs, of any nature whatsoever, relating to or arising from the \nformation, administration, or existence of the QSF or the payment by the \nCounty into the QSF. \n1.  The following, in combination with the complete account number \nwhich shall be provided by Plaintiffs’ Counsel to the County, \nconstitute the wire instructions for the QSF: \n  Account Name:  EPTC Custodial Trust Settlement Trust \nContribution Account \n  Account Number:  X8544 \n  Bank:  Union First Market Bank \n  Routing Number:  051403164 \n  Further Credit Instructions:  EPTC FBO – Cole Jail Monitoring \nQualified Settlement Fund \n2.  The only exceptions to this fixed sum for future fees that are not \nincluded in the $2.2 million sum, above, are comprised of the \nfollowing two scenarios; and these are the only situations in which \nPlaintiffs’ Counsel or anyone else may file a motion with the court \nseeking an award of additional reasonable attorney’s fees and costs: \na.  The County brings an unsuccessful motion under the Consent \nDecree against Plaintiffs or Plaintiffs’ Counsel (“County’s \nMotion”) (Scenario 1); or \nb.  The Court has found the County to be in violation of \nprovisions of the Consent Decree, and based on that violation, \nhas ordered to County to comply with the Consent Decree \n   14   \n[3269262.19] Cole v. County of Santa Clara Consent Decree\n\n \n(“order to comply”); and then, the County refuses to follow \nthat order to comply (Scenario 2). \nc.  Under Scenario 1, Plaintiffs’ Counsel may only be awarded \nthose reasonable attorney’s fees and costs for work performed \nthat both a) arises after the filing of the County’s Motion and \nb) directly pertains to Plaintiffs’ Counsel preparing their filed \nresponse and attending the hearing, if any, on the County’s \nMotion. \nd.  Under Scenario 2, if the County refuses to follow the order to \ncomply, Plaintiffs’ Counsel may file a motion to find the \nCounty in contempt of court.  If Plaintiffs’ motion is \nsuccessful, Plaintiffs’ Counsel may then only be awarded \nthose reasonable attorney’s fees and costs for their work \ndrafting and arguing the successful new contempt motion that \nis performed after both a) the Court enters the order to \ncomply, and then b) the County fails to abide by that order to \ncomply. \nC.  With the exception of the scenarios set forth in Section VI.B.2, no other \nattorney’s fees or costs award or payment of any sort is permitted to anyone \nunder this Consent Decree. \nVII.  Dispute Resolution \nA.  If either Party seeks to engage in the Dispute Resolution Process, as defined \nherein, that Party shall give notice to the other Party of the grounds for the \ndispute.  The Party receiving the demand to engage in the Dispute \nResolution Process will provide a written response within fourteen (14) \ndays.  The Parties shall then engage in good-faith negotiations to attempt to \nresolve the dispute for a minimum of thirty (30) days from the date of the \nresponse.  Plaintiffs shall be permitted to bring their own expert into the \nJails, at a time, scope, and for a duration mutually agreed upon by the \nParties, as part of this thirty (30) day negotiation period in order to assist in \nresolving the dispute.  The County agrees to not unduly delay Plaintiffs’ \nexpert’s access to the Jails under these circumstances. \nB.  If after meeting and conferring for at least thirty (30) days, the dispute has \nnot been resolved, either Party may request that the Parties bring the \ndispute before Judge Cousins, or another mutually agreed upon neutral, for \npurposes of mediation.  If Judge Cousins is not available within forty-five \ndays (45), the Parties will utilize the services of the Northern District of \nCalifornia’s Alternative Dispute Resolution program or request that the \n   15   \n[3269262.19] Cole v. County of Santa Clara Consent Decree\n\n \nCourt appoint another Magistrate Judge.  If this mediation is unsuccessful, \neither Party may apply to the Court for relief that is bounded by and subject \nto the limitations and terms of this Consent Decree.  The Parties agree to \nwork in good faith to avoid such applications wherever possible.  Any \ndisputes that cannot be resolved through the Dispute Resolution Process \noutlined above may be submitted to Judge Cousins, in his capacity as a \nMagistrate Judge rather than as a mediator as delineated in Section IX.B. \nbelow, for a resolution that is bounded by and subject to the limitations and \nterms of this Consent Decree. \nC.  During the last nine (9) months of the Term of this Consent Decree, either \nParty may choose to immediately submit any disputes to Judge Cousins \nfollowing completion of the thirty-day meet and confer process, in his \ncapacity as a Magistrate Judge, for a resolution that is bounded by and \nsubject to the limitations and terms of this Consent Decree. \nIn the case of an emergency that poses an immediate and significant threat \nto the health and safety of inmates, and as such, the nature of the \nemergency makes completion of the Dispute Resolution Process \nimpracticable, a Party may seek relief from the Court that is bounded by \nand subject to the limitations and terms of this Consent Decree, with the \nexception of not having to complete the Dispute Resolution Process, \nprovided that the moving Party has notified the nonmoving party of the \nissue at least seventy-two (72) hours before seeking such relief from the \nCourt. \nVIII.  Duration of the Consent Decree \nA.  The Parties agree that this Consent Decree, and all of its terms, will expire, \nand will no longer be enforced or enforceable in any court, twelve (12) \nmonths after the certificate of occupancy for the New Jail has been issued \nand the County has begun placement of inmates in the New Jail (the \n“Term”).  This Term is among the most material terms of this Consent \nDecree, such that absent this Term, the Parties would not have executed this \nConsent Decree.  To effectuate this Term, the Parties further agree to waive \ntheir rights under 28 U.S.C. §§ 3626 (b), (e), and (f), including as set forth \nin paragraphs VIII.B and C, below. \nB.  Defendant agrees not to seek, support, or assent to termination of the \nConsent Decree before the completion of the Term, under any \ncircumstances, except as set forth in paragraph VIII.C, below; and Plaintiffs \nagree not to seek, support, or assent to any extension of the Term, under \nany circumstances, except as set forth in paragraph VIII.C, below. \n   16   \n[3269262.19] Cole v. County of Santa Clara Consent Decree\n\n \nC.  The only circumstance by which the Term of this Consent Decree may be \nextended is that the Parties jointly agree that the Term should be extended \nbecause they perceive that ongoing violations remain at the end of the Term \nand the Parties jointly agree that extension of the Term is the most efficient \nmeans to address such violations.  In that circumstance, the Parties will \njointly move, and can only jointly move, the Court to extend the Term.  If \nPlaintiffs contend, and Defendant disputes, that ongoing violations exist at \nthe end of the Term, and/or if Defendants do not agree that the Term should \nbe extended, Plaintiffs’ sole remedy shall be to file a new lawsuit after the \nend of the Term of this Consent Decree. \nIX.  Reservation of Jurisdiction and Enforcement \nA.  The District Court of the Northern District of California shall retain \njurisdiction to enforce, but under no circumstances expand or alter, the \nterms of this Consent Decree and shall retain jurisdiction to resolve any \ndispute regarding compliance with this Consent Decree and that such \nresolution is bounded by and subject to the limitations and terms of this \nConsent Decree, including that in Section VIII, above, regarding the Term \nof this Consent Decree.  The Court shall have the power to enforce the \nConsent Decree through specific performance and all other remedies \npermitted by law and equity throughout the Term of this Consent Decree \nand that such enforcement is bounded by and subject to the limitations and \nterms of this Consent Decree, including that in Section VIII, above, \nregarding the Term of this Consent Decree. \nB.  The Parties consent to having all disputes between the Parties arising out of \nthis Consent Decree, including those regarding compliance with this \nConsent Decree, heard and decided by Judge Nathanael Cousins, subject to \nthe provisions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72, and that any relief \nfrom such disputes is bounded by and subject to the limitations and terms \nof this Consent Decree.  Should Judge Cousins no longer be available to \nserve in this capacity for any reason, only this provision, IX.B, will be \ndeemed to be severable from the remainder of this Consent Decree, unless \nthe Parties jointly agree on a new decision-maker. \nX.  Release \nSubject to the entry of Judgment by the Court and in consideration of the relief set forth \nherein, Plaintiffs, for themselves, the Class, and their successors and assigns, hereby fully \nand finally release and discharge Defendant and its successors, assigns, officers, \ndirectors, and past and present agents and employees (“Released Parties”) from any and \nall claims for declaratory or injunctive relief raised in the Action, or that could have been \nraised in the Action, relating to inmates with Mobility Disabilities (“Released Claims”).  \n   17   \n[3269262.19] Cole v. County of Santa Clara Consent Decree\n\n \nThe Released Claims do not include any claims to enforce the terms of this Consent \nDecree.  Nothing in this Consent Decree releases any damages claims to which Plaintiffs \nor other individual members of the Plaintiff Class may be entitled. \nXI.  Miscellaneous \nA.  This Consent Decree, which incorporates by reference the Remedial Plan \n(Exhibit A) and the draft Notice to the Class (Exhibit B), contains the \nentire agreement between the Parties.  This Consent Decree expresses the \ncomplete and final understanding with respect to the subject matter of this \nConsent Decree.  The Parties hereto understand and agree that the terms of \nthis Consent Decree supersede any prior discussions, understandings, or \nagreements between them related to the subject matter hereof. \nB.  The Parties each acknowledge that they are entering into this Consent \nDecree freely, knowingly, voluntarily, and with a full understanding of its \nterms.  The Parties acknowledge that they have consulted with counsel of \ntheir own choosing concerning this Consent Decree and that they were \ngiven reasonable time to review and consider the terms of this Consent \nDecree. \nC.  This Consent Decree shall be binding on all successors, assignees, \nemployees, agents, and all others working for or on behalf of Defendant \nand Plaintiffs. \nD.  The language of this Consent Decree shall be construed as a whole \naccording to its fair meaning, and not strictly for or against any of the \nParties.  The terms of this Consent Decree are the product of joint \nnegotiations and shall not be construed as having been authored by one \nparty rather than another.  Any ambiguity shall not be construed against any \nParty.  Where required by context, the plural includes the singular and the \nsingular includes the plural.  The headings in this Consent Decree are solely \nfor convenience and will not be considered in its interpretation. \nE.  If any provision or provisions of this Consent Decree, other than the Term, \nshall be held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the validity, legality, and/or \nenforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected \nor impaired thereby. \nF.  This Consent Decree may be executed in counterparts, each of which will \nbe considered an original, but all of which, when taken together, will \nconstitute one and the same instrument. \n   18   \n[3269262.19] Cole v. County of Santa Clara Consent Decree\n\n \nG.  This Consent Decree shall be governed by and construed in accordance \nwith the laws of the State of California. \nH.  To the extent any documents are required to be executed by any of the \nParties to effectuate this Consent Decree, each party hereto agrees to \nexecute and deliver such and further documents as may be required to carry \nout the terms of this Consent Decree. \nI.  Each signatory to this Consent Decree certifies that it, he, or she is fully \nauthorized by the party it, he, or she represents to enter into the Consent \nDecree, to execute it on behalf of the party represented, and to legally bind \nthat party thereto. \nUnless otherwise indicated in the Consent Decree, all notices or \ncommunications required by this Consent Decree shall be in writing by \nemail addressed as stated below.  Should any Party’s contact information \nchange from what is listed below, that Party shall promptly provide written \nnotice of the updated contact information to the other Parties. \nTo Named Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs’ Counsel, or the Settlement Class: \nLisa Ells \nRosen Bien Galvan & Grunfeld LLP \n101 Mission Street, Sixth Floor \nSan Francisco, CA  94105-1738 \nlells@rbgg.com \nMichelle Iorio \nDisability Rights Advocates \n2001 Center Street, Fourth Floor \nBerkeley, CA 94704 \nmiorio@dralegal.org \n/ / / \n/ / / \n/ / / \n/ / / \n/ / / \n/ / / \n   19   \n[3269262.19] Cole v.

County of  Clara Consent \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT A \n\n \nSanta Clara County Mobility Disability Remedial Plan \nI.  TERMINOLOGY AND DEFINITIONS \nThe terms and definitions set forth in the Consent Decree, to which this Remedial Plan is \nattached and into which this Remedial Plan is incorporated by reference, also control the \nterms and definitions set forth in this Remedial Plan. \nII.  INTAKE PROCESS \nA.  In a reasonably confidential setting, the County shall inquire during intake \nwhether an inmate has a Mobility Disability using an agreed-upon \nscreening tool. \nB.  The intake screening shall be conducted by a licensed registered nurse or, at \nthe County’s discretion, a Medical Provider. \nC.  During the intake screening, the County shall begin the verification process \nof whether an inmate has a Mobility Disability, as outlined in Section III, \nif: \n1.  The inmate self-reports a Mobility Disability; \n2.  The inmate’s Healthlink or ADA Tracking System record contains \ndocumentation of a Mobility Disability; or \n3.  The screening tool indicates that the inmate might have a Mobility \nDisability. \nD.  If the intake process outlined in Section II.C, above, indicates that an \ninmate might have a Mobility Disability, the County shall utilize the \nagreed-upon screening tool to determine what type of reasonable \nmodifications are necessary and available (e.g., changes to housing, lower \nbunk/lower tier) and shall provide such reasonable modifications while the \ninmate awaits verification pursuant to Section III. \nE.  Issuance and Retention of Mobility Devices at Intake \n1.  The County will issue a Standard Mobility Device promptly, but in \nany case no later than the timelines contained in Section IV, to any \ninmate who is determined to possibly need a Mobility Device \npursuant to Section II.D, subject to later verification pursuant to \nSection III, unless a Captain or Watch Commander determines and \ndocuments, based on a Safety-Security Assessment, that an inmate’s \npossession of a Mobility Device constitutes an immediate risk of \nSanta Clara County ADA Remedial Plan Page 1 \n \n\n \nbodily harm to inmates or staff, or threatens the security of the \nfacility.  If providing an alternative Mobility Device would mitigate \nthe risk, the Captain or Watch Commander shall direct that the \ninmate be provided with the designated alternative. \n2.  The County acknowledges its obligations to comply with California \nPenal Code section 2656 pertaining to retention of orthopedic and \nprosthetic appliances. \n3.  Subject to Sections II.E.1 & II.E.2, inmates will be permitted to keep \ntheir Personal Mobility Device(s) during the intake process until the \nCounty issues a Standard or Generic (if available) Mobility Device, \nunless a Captain or Watch Commander determines and documents, \nbased on a Safety-Security Assessment, that the Mobility Device \nconstitutes an immediate risk of bodily harm to inmates or staff, or \nthreatens the security of the facility.  If providing an alternative \nMobility Device would mitigate the risk, the Captain or Watch \nCommander shall direct that the inmate be provided with the \ndesignated alternative. \nF.  If an inmate arrives at the Jail with a Personal Mobility Device that is \nexchanged for a County-owned Mobility Device, the County shall store the \nPersonal Mobility Device at the Jail at no cost to the inmate for return upon \nrelease and/or transfer from the Jail to another facility.  Alternatively, the \ninmate may arrange for pick-up of the Mobility Device.  The County will \nnot store a Personal Mobility Device for more than ninety (90) days after an \ninmate has been released or transferred. \nG.  The County shall advise inmates of the results of the intake screening and \nnotify the inmate of the right to request a physical examination by a \nMedical Provider to the extent the inmate disagrees with the results and/or \nreasonable modifications provided.  The County shall further notify inmates \nof the right to request use of a Personal Mobility Device consistent with \nSection IV below. \nH.  The results of the intake screening shall be documented and promptly \ninputted into the County’s ADA Tracking System. \nI.  As part of the intake process, all inmates shall be informed of the process \nby which they can request a reasonable modification while in custody, \nincluding the types of issues that can be reviewed by the County Jails’ \nADA Unit on an expedited basis. \nSanta Clara County ADA Remedial Plan Page 2 \n \n\n \nIII.  VERIFICATION OF AN INMATE’S MOBILITY DISABILITY AND NEED \nFOR REASONABLE MODIFICATIONS \nA.  The County’s policy is to issue County owned Mobility Devices in all \ninstances unless:  (a) an inmate’s Personal Mobility Device is the only \nreasonable modification for the inmate’s Mobility Disability; or (b) the \nnature of the inmate’s Personal Mobility Device would pose particular \ndifficulty and/or harm to the inmate to remove, and/or removal is otherwise \nunnecessary due to the origin or nature of the device (i.e., a hospital-issued \nsling or brace). \nB.  An inmate may make a request to the ADA Unit to be able to continue to \nuse his/her Personal Mobility Device.  The ADA Unit and/or Medical \nProvider (where necessary) will evaluate the request based on an \nindividualized assessment as outlined in Sections III.D and III.E. \nC.  An inmate’s Personal Mobility Device may be retained by the County for a \nshort period of time sufficient to inspect the device for contraband.  In most \ncases the inspection should occur promptly, but in rare cases the inspection \nmay take longer, in which case it shall be completed within 14 days. \nD.  ADA Unit’s Responsibilities \n1.  The County’s ADA Unit shall review whether an inmate has a \nMobility Disability and/or what reasonable modification(s) are \nnecessary for the inmate within 7 calendar days under the following \ncircumstances: \na.  An inmate is designated during the intake screening as \npossibly having a Mobility Disability and/or the need for a \nreasonable modification; \nb.  An inmate makes a request to the ADA Unit, including \nthrough an ADA Request or ADA-related grievance as \noutlined in Section XIII, for evaluation of a Mobility \nDisability and/or the need for a reasonable modification; or \nc.  The inmate is referred by staff to the ADA Unit for evaluation \nof a Mobility Disability and/or the need for a reasonable \nmodification. \n2.  The ADA Unit shall document a Mobility Disability and/or what \nreasonable modification(s) are necessary in the ADA Tracking \nSystem. \nSanta Clara County ADA Remedial Plan Page 3 \n \n\n \na.  If the ADA Unit determines that an inmate requires a \nMobility Device, the County shall issue it consistent with \nSection IV.D.1, and the ADA Unit will issue to the inmate \nappropriate documentation authorizing possession of a \nMobility Device. \nb.  If the ADA Unit determines that an inmate requires a \nreasonable modification related to their housing assignment \n(e.g., ADA Accessible cell, grab bars, dining areas, showers, \npath of travel, lower bunk, lower tier and/or a housing \nreassignment in order to access work, educational or other \nprograms), the inmate shall receive the reasonable \nmodification within 24 hours. \n3.  If the ADA Unit determines that an inmate’s Mobility Disability \nrequires evaluation from a Medical Provider, the ADA Unit shall \noffer an inmate a reasonable modification on a temporary basis \npending a medical appointment, which shall occur within 30 days. \n4.  The Parties agree that not all Mobility Disabilities and/or reasonable \nmodifications will require an appointment with a Medical Provider \nto verify the Mobility Disability and/or the need for a reasonable \nmodification.  Further, an inmate’s Mobility Disability and/or need \nfor a reasonable modification could change over time and will be \naddressed based on an inmate’s current status. \nE.  Medical Provider’s Responsibilities \n1.  If the ADA Unit refers an inmate for evaluation pursuant to Section \nIII.D.3, or if an inmate or Medical Provider first identifies a Mobility \nDisability at a medical encounter where the Medical Provider is able \nto assess the Mobility Disability, the Medical Provider shall verify \nwhether the inmate has a Mobility Disability and/or determine what \nreasonable modification(s) are necessary for the inmate unless such a \ndetermination requires a specialist-medical appointment. \na.  If the Medical Provider determines that an inmate requires a \nMobility Device, the County shall issue it consistent with \nSection IV.D.1, and the County will issue to the inmate \nappropriate documentation authorizing possession of a \nMobility Device \nb.  If the Medical Provider determines that an inmate requires a \nreasonable modification related to their housing assignment \nSanta Clara County ADA Remedial Plan Page 4 \n \n\n \n(e.g., ADA Accessible cell, grab bars, dining areas, showers, \npath of travel, lower bunk, lower tier and/or a housing \nreassignment in order to access work, educational or other \nprograms), the inmate shall receive the reasonable \nmodification within 24 hours. \nc.  The County shall document the Medical Provider’s \ndetermination in the ADA Tracking system and refer the \ninmate to the ADA Unit for follow-up. \nd.  If the Medical Provider determines that an inmate requires a \nspecialist-medical appointment, the Medical Provider shall \npromptly request that appointment, and shall consult with the \nADA Unit in order to provide a reasonable modification, such \nas a Mobility Device and/or a housing change in accordance \nwith Sections III.E.1.a and III.E.1.b on a temporary basis \npending the outcome of the specialist-medical appointment. \n2.  If an inmate or Medical Provider first identifies a Mobility Disability \nat a medical or mental health appointment where the Medical \nProvider cannot assess the Mobility Disability (e.g., because the \nappointment is not conducted by the appropriate Medical Provider \nand/or is scheduled for a different purpose), the Medical Provider \nshall refer the inmate to the ADA Unit, and the County shall \ndocument the referral in the ADA Tracking System.  The ADA Unit \nshall then conduct a review consistent with Section III. \n3.  Medical Providers evaluating an inmate’s Mobility Disability and/or \nthe need for a reasonable modification(s) may determine at an in-\nperson evaluation that the inmate does not have a Mobility Disability \nand/or the inmate does not require a reasonable modification.  If \nsuch a determination is made, the County shall document the \nrationale for the Medical Provider’s finding in the ADA Tracking \nsystem. \nIV.  ISSUANCE, RETENTION, MAINTENANCE, AND DENIAL OF \nMOBILITY DEVICE(S) \nA.  The County’s policies and procedures for the ordering, retention, \nmaintenance, and denial/confiscation of Mobility Devices shall be reviewed \nand amended or drafted, as necessary to be consistent with this Remedial \nPlan. \nB.  Supply and Maintenance of Standard Mobility Devices \nSanta Clara County ADA Remedial Plan Page 5 \n \n\n \n1.  The County shall maintain a reasonable supply of Standard \nwheelchairs, walkers, canes, and crutches. \n2.  The County shall inspect its supply of Standard Mobility Devices on \na quarterly basis to ensure sufficient operational quantities are \navailable. \nC.  Motorized Mobility Devices \n1.  Motorized Mobility Devices are generally not permitted in the Jails. \n2.   The ADA Unit and Medical Provider(s), in coordination with the \nAssistant Sheriff, shall determine the most appropriate manner to \naccommodate an inmate who requires a motorized Mobility Device \nin the exceptional circumstance where a Medical Provider or the \nADA Unit have determined, as outlined in Section III, that a \nmotorized Mobility Device is the only reasonable modification that \nwould meet the needs of the inmate with a Mobility Disability. \n3.  The County shall consult with Plaintiffs’ Counsel if the County \ndetermines that it will accommodate the inmate in need of motorized \nMobility Device in some other manner than permitting the inmate to \nutilize the motorized Mobility Device in the Jail. \nD.  Timing for Issuance of Mobility Devices \n1.  An inmate with a Mobility Disability in need of a Standard Mobility \nDevice shall be issued a Standard Mobility Device within four (4) \nhours, absent extenuating circumstances, following the ADA Unit or \nthe Medical Provider’s determination that an inmate needs a \nMobility Device. \n2.  Generic or Customized Mobility Devices may take time to order or \ndesign.  If the required Generic Mobility Device is available on site, \nit shall be issued within four (4) hours, absent extenuating \ncircumstances, following the ADA Unit or the Medical Provider’s \ndetermination that an inmate needs a Mobility Device.  For \nCustomized Mobility Devices and Generic Mobility Devices not \nkept on site, Adult Custody Health Services shall either obtain the \ndevice or, if the device requires a special order, place the order for \nsaid device within three (3) business days of identification of need.  \nThe County shall inform the inmate of an estimated time that the \nGeneric and/or Customized Mobility Device shall be provided.  The \nCounty shall check on the status of the Generic or Customized \nSanta Clara County ADA Remedial Plan Page 6 \n \n\n \nMobility Devices every 30 days and shall provide the inmate with a \ntemporary reasonable modification to the extent necessary. \nE.  Maintenance of Mobility Devices \n1.  If an inmate’s Mobility Device is operable but in need of \nmaintenance or repair, and the inmate notifies the ADA Unit, the \nADA Unit shall assess and address the maintenance or repair need \nwithin seven (7) days. \n2.  If an inmate’s Standard Mobility Device becomes inoperable and the \ninmate reports the problem to custody staff, the County shall provide \na replacement within twenty-four (24) hours. \n3.  If an inmate advises the ADA Unit and/or a Medical Provider that a \nGeneric or Customized Mobility Device is in need of maintenance, \nrepair, or replacement, the County shall coordinate maintenance, \nrepair, or replacement as necessary.  In the interim, the ADA Unit \nshall replace the Generic Mobility Device if such device is kept in \nstock on site or provide the inmate with a Standard Mobility Device \non a temporary basis and evaluate the provision of other interim \nreasonable modification(s). \nF.  Safety-Security Assessments After Intake \n1.  The County shall permit an inmate to keep a Mobility Device unless \na Captain or Watch Commander determines and documents, based \non a Safety-Security Assessment, that a Mobility Device constitutes \nan immediate risk of bodily harm to inmates or staff, or threatens the \nsecurity of the facility. \n2.  If the Captain or Watch Commander makes such a determination, \nthey shall document the decision, and reasons for it, as well as the \ndate of decision, in writing, and shall promptly consult with a \nMedical Provider and the ADA Coordinator to determine if an \nappropriate alternative reasonable modification can be provided, in \nwhich case an alternative reasonable modification shall be provided.  \nThe Captain, Watch Commander, Medical Provider, or ADA \nCoordinator shall document the nature of any alternative reasonable \nmodification(s) provided in the ADA Tracking System. \nSanta Clara County ADA Remedial Plan Page 7 \n \n\n \n3.  If the County removes an inmate’s Mobility Device following a \nSafety-Security Assessment, the County shall reevaluate the Safety-\nSecurity Assessment as follows: \na.  The inmate must be reevaluated by the ADA Unit to \ndetermine if he or she can safely possess the Mobility Device \na minimum of every seven (7) days if the device is removed \nduring the intake process. \nb.  The inmate must be reevaluated by the ADA Unit to \ndetermine if he or she can safely possess the Mobility Device \na minimum of every fourteen (14) days if the device is \nremoved at any other time. \nc.  For each evaluation pursuant to Section IV.F.3.a and \nIV.F.3.b, the ADA Unit shall make a recommendation to the \nCaptain of the facility or his or her superiors regarding \nwhether the Mobility Device should continue to be removed \nfrom the inmate and shall document the rationale in the ADA \nTracking System. \n4.  Notwithstanding the provisions above, the County acknowledges its \nobligations to comply with California Penal Code section 2656 \npertaining to retention of orthopedic and prosthetic appliances. \nV.  CLASSIFICATION AND HOUSING OF INMATES WITH MOBILITY-\nDISABILITIES \nA.  The County shall review its Classification Policies and Procedures and \nrevise, as necessary, to be consistent with this Remedial Plan. \nB.  An inmate’s need for a Mobility Device in a housing unit shall not be a \nbasis for assignment to the infirmary, a medical unit, or a mental health \nhousing unit. \nC.  That an inmate has a Mobility Disability and/or requires reasonable \nmodifications for that disability (including the provision of Mobility \nDevices) shall not be a factor in determining an inmate’s security \nclassification. \nD.  Inmates identified as having a Mobility Disability shall be placed in \nhousing that is consistent with their security classification and their \naccessibility needs.  Not all inmates with a Mobility Disability require an \nADA Accessible cell or unit, but may require reasonable modifications \nSanta Clara County ADA Remedial Plan Page 8 \n \n\n \nrelated to housing such as, but not limited to, a lower bunk/lower tier \nassignment, or access to ADA Accessible shower facilities. \nE.  This Remedial Plan recognizes that, while additional ADA Accessible \nhousing is constructed pursuant to the Construction Remedial Plan (Section \nXI), ADA Accessible housing may not be immediately available for every \ninmate needing such housing consistent with their classification.  As ADA \nAccessible housing is completed and brought online under the Construction \nRemedial Plan, inmates in need of ADA Accessible housing shall be \nhoused consistent with their needs.  In the interim, the Parties agree that \ninmates with Mobility Disabilities who require ADA Accessible housing \nshall be housed as follows: \n1.  Male Inmates \na.  Inmates determined to be a Level 1 classification shall be \nhoused in Barracks 3 at the Elmwood Minimum Camp unless \nBarracks 3 is closed for repairs, construction, or other \nextenuating circumstances, in which case these inmates shall \nbe housed in Special Housing. \nb.  Inmates who use wheelchairs, and who are determined to be \nLevel 2, 3, or 4 security level inmates, shall be housed in \nMain Jail Unit 2B and/or Elmwood Unit M3. \nc.  Inmates who use Mobility Devices other than wheelchairs \nand who are determined to be Level 2, 3, or 4 security level \ninmates, shall be assessed on an individualized basis and \nhoused as appropriate. \n2.  Female Inmates \na.  Inmates who can be appropriately housed in a dorm setting \nbased on their security level shall be housed in W2.  The \nADA Unit will promptly conduct an individualized \nassessment to determine if additional reasonable \nmodification(s) are necessary and develop a plan to address \nthose needs. \nb.  Inmates who require cell-style housing based on their security \nlevel shall be housed in W4.  The ADA Unit shall promptly \nconduct an individualized assessment to determine if \nadditional reasonable modification(s) are necessary and \ndevelop a plan to address those needs.  The County shall \nSanta Clara County ADA Remedial Plan Page 9 \n \n\n \npromptly consult with Plaintiffs’ Counsel regarding the \nCounty’s planned reasonable modifications for an inmate \nrequiring cell-style housing who, the County has determined \nas outlined in Section III, requires full-time use of a \nwheelchair. \nF.  If the housing units listed in Sections V.E.1 and/or V.E.2 are closed for \nrepairs, construction, or other extenuating circumstances, the County shall \npromptly (1) notify Plaintiffs’ Counsel of the closure(s), and (2) provide \nPlaintiffs’ Counsel with a list of where inmates with Mobility Disabilities \nwill be housed for the duration of the closure(s).  During such closure(s), \nthe ADA Unit shall promptly conduct an individualized assessment to \ndetermine if additional reasonable modifications are necessary for the \naffected inmates with Mobility Disabilities and develop a plan to address \nthose needs. \nVI.  TRACKING INMATES WITH MOBILITY DISABILITIES (“ADA \nTRACKING SYSTEM”) \nA.  The County shall use an ADA Tracking System to document and share \ninternally information regarding inmates with Mobility Disabilities. \nB.  The ADA Tracking System shall identify and track all inmates with a \nMobility Disability. \nC.  The ADA Tracking System shall have the following functional capabilities: \n1.  Code the type of Mobility Disability and the reasonable \nmodifications an inmate requires for the Mobility Disability (e.g., \nMobility Devices, lower bunks, ground floor housing). \n2.  Track all programs, services, and reasonable modifications offered \nto an inmate with a Mobility Disability throughout his/her \nincarceration. \nD.  The County shall designate staff that shall be responsible for using the \nADA Tracking System.  Designated Staff shall include Classification Staff, \nthe ADA Coordinator and his or her staff, the Facility Watch Commander, \nDivision Commander, Administrative Sergeant, Program Managers, and \nstaff from Adult Custody Health Services (“Designated Staff”). \nE.  Designated Staff, both during the intake and booking process and during \nclinical encounters, shall be responsible for adding or modifying \nSanta Clara County ADA Remedial Plan Page 10 \n \n\n \ninformation regarding the nature of an inmate’s Mobility Disability and \nnecessary reasonable modifications for that Mobility Disability. \nF.  Designated Staff shall be able and expected to view information in the \nsystem to ensure that the County provides reasonable modifications to \ninmates with Mobility Disabilities. \nG.  Designated Staff shall also be responsible for updating the system with \ninformation regarding the reasonable modifications provided during the \ninmate’s incarceration and any subsequent returns to custody. \nH.  Housing unit, education, and program office staff shall be provided with a \nreport listing all inmates with a Mobility Disability in the relevant unit or \nprogram, as well as those inmates’ needing reasonable modifications for a \nMobility Disability.  The report shall be updated and provided in written \nform to such staff at least once per week.  Additionally, information from \nthe report shall be communicated in writing to staff whenever an inmate \nwith a Mobility Disability is assigned to the unit or program. \nI.  All Designated Staff shall be trained to properly use the ADA Tracking \nSystem.  The training shall occur on site over the course of six months after \nimplementation begins. \nJ.  The County shall develop and maintain appropriate policies outlining who \ncan access and modify information in the ADA Tracking System. \nVII.  PROGRAMS AND SERVICES \nA.  The County’s policies and procedures pertaining to programs and services \nshall be reviewed and amended or drafted, as necessary, to be consistent \nwith this Remedial Plan. \nB.  The County shall ensure that an inmate with a Mobility Disability has equal \naccess to all inmate programs and services for which an inmate would be \neligible but for that Mobility Disability—including, but not limited to \neducational, vocational, work, recreational, visiting, medical, mental health, \nsubstance abuse, self-improvement, and religious programs, as well as early \nrelease programs such as the Custody Alternative Supervision Program \n(CASP)—on a space available basis, consistent with the inmate’s security \nclassification. \nC.  If an inmate’s Mobility Disability interferes with his or her ability to \nparticipate in a program or service for which he or she is otherwise eligible, \nthe ADA Coordinator shall first determine whether the individual inmate \nSanta Clara County ADA Remedial Plan Page 11 \n \n\n \ncan participate in the program or service if the County provided a \nreasonable modification.  If a non-structural reasonable modification will \nallow an inmate with a Mobility Disability to participate in a program, the \nCounty shall provide the non-structural reasonable modification and shall \nallow the inmate to participate in the program. \nD.  If a non-structural reasonable modification would result in a fundamental \nalteration of the program, the County must take actions that would not \nresult in such an alteration but would nevertheless ensure that the inmate \nwith a Mobility Disability receives the benefits or services offered by the \nCounty’s program. \nE.  The County can refuse to provide a reasonable modification to an inmate \nwith a Mobility Disability who is otherwise qualified for a program or \nservice if:  (1) the inmate’s participation in the program would pose a direct \nthreat to the health or safety of others, or (2) there is a reason for doing so \nthat is reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest(s), as \ndetermined by the ADA Unit in coordination with the Assistant Sheriff.  \nRefusal to provide a reasonable modification pursuant to either of the \npreceding exceptions shall be based on a Safety-Security Assessment.  If \nproviding an alternative Mobility Device would mitigate the risk, the \nCounty shall provide the inmate with the designated alternative as \nexpeditiously as possible. \nF.  If the County relies upon any of the above exceptions to deny an inmate \nwith a Mobility Disability the opportunity to participate in a program or \nservice, the ADA Unit must document the basis for the determination in the \nADA Tracking System. \nG.  Location of Programs and Services \n1.  The Parties have designated structural changes in the Construction \nRemedial Plan outlined in Section XI in order to provide program \naccessibility to inmates with Mobility Disabilities. \n2.  In order to address program accessibility, the County agrees to \nprovide programming and services in the areas designated in the \nConstruction Plan (Section XI) as the portions of the Construction \nPlan providing accessibility to programs and services are completed. \n3.  As an alternative to providing programming and services in areas \ndesignated in the Construction Plan, the County may continue to \nutilize nonstructural methods to provide accessibility to programs \nand services, including but not limited to acquisition or redesign of \nSanta Clara County ADA Remedial Plan Page 12 \n \n\n \nequipment, assignment of aides to inmates with Mobility Disabilities \nor, at the County’s election, the provision of services at alternate \naccessible sites. \n4.  While the County is undertaking the construction described in \nSection XI of this Remedial Plan, the Parties agree that the County \nshall take the following interim measures to provide accessibility to \nprograms and service for inmates with Mobility Disabilities: \na.  The County may use inmates or Custody Staff to push \ninmates in wheelchairs to a program or service along paths of \ntravel agreed upon by the Parties.  Pending completion of \nphysical modifications to the paths of travel, wheelchair \npushers may be used as an interim measure.  Wheelchair \npushers used on an interim basis are subject to the training \nrequirements and other provisions outlined in Section \nVII.G.7. \nb.  Assignment of aides to inmates with Mobility Disabilities. \n5.  Where the County cannot provide programs or services at the \nlocations designated in the Construction Plan and cannot find \nnonstructural measures to provide accessibility to programs and \nservices, the County may refuse to provide the program or service to \nan inmate with a Mobility Disability only upon a showing that doing \nso would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the \nprogram, service, or activity, or would result in undue financial and \nadministrative burdens. \n6.  The County shall maintain ADA Accessible facilities in operable \nworking condition.  Isolated or temporary interruptions in access to \nthese facilities due to maintenance or repairs are not prohibited if the \nCounty is exercising reasonable diligence in addressing the \nmaintenance or repairs. \n7.  Once paths of travel are made compliant with this Remedial Plan, \nwheelchair pushers may continue to be used for inmates who need \nassistance traveling long distances, unless otherwise requested by the \ninmates.  Appropriately screened inmates and/or Custody Staff \nchosen to assist inmates who use wheelchairs shall receive initial \nand periodic training as to their job duties and performance criteria.  \nThe training shall cover how to safely and properly assist inmates \nwith Mobility Disabilities.  The ADA Unit shall evaluate wheelchair \nSanta Clara County ADA Remedial Plan Page 13 \n \n\n \npushers which shall include feedback from the inmates with \nMobility Disabilities.  Inmates with Mobility Disabilities have the \nright to refuse a wheelchair pusher, and in that circumstance, the \nADA Unit shall determine an appropriate alternative reasonable \nmodification. \nH.  If an inmate with a Mobility Disability requires transportation in a \nvehicle—e.g., to court or to a medical appointment at an outside facility—\nthe vehicle used to transport the inmate must be ADA Accessible.  \nSpecifically, inmates who use wheelchairs on permanent bases and/or \ninmates who have difficulty navigating steps without assistance must be \ntransported in vehicles equipped with a wheelchair lift and other safety \nequipment mandated by the Department of Motor Vehicles and the \nDepartment of Transportation.  If the Department of Motor Vehicles and \nDepartment of Transportation standards conflict, the applicable standard \nthat provides greater protections to individuals with a Mobility Disability \nshall govern. \nVIII.  POLICY REVIEW AND REVISION \nA.  The County is reviewing and revising, as needed, all policies, procedures, \nPost Orders, and forms, including those for Adult Custody Health Services, \nand the Inmate Orientation book, to be consistent with the provisions in this \nRemedial Plan.  Plaintiffs’ Counsel shall be provided the opportunity to \ncomment on these documents. \nB.  Policy Revision Process \n1.  Within 30 days of the execution of the Consent Decree, the Parties \nshall meet and confer to designate the policies that require revision \nto address key portions of this Remedial Plan \n2.  The County shall provide Plaintiffs’ Counsel with draft proposed \nrevisions to the agreed upon policies within 120 days of the \nexecution of the Consent Decree unless a longer timeframe is \nmutually agreed upon by the Parties. \n3.  The designated policies shall be finalized with one year of the \nexecution of the Consent Decree unless the Parties agree to a longer \ntime frame. \nC.  The County shall train relevant Staff on new or revised policies and \nprocedures as detailed in Section X. \nSanta Clara County ADA Remedial Plan Page 14 \n \n\n \nIX.  ADA COORDINATOR \nA.  The County has appointed a full-time ADA Coordinator, a lieutenant who \nreports directly to the Assistant Sheriff.  The ADA Coordinator shall \noversee all issues related to inmates with Mobility Disabilities, including, \nbut not limited to, classification; housing; inspection, maintenance, \nprovision, and removal of Mobility Devices; and responding to Mobility \nDisability-related requests and inmate grievances pursuant to County \npolicy. \nB.  The County shall not modify the job description of the ADA Coordinator \nwithout consultation with Plaintiffs’ Counsel. \nC.  As soon as practical, but under no circumstances more than ninety (90) \ndays after an inmate has been identified as having a Mobility Disability, the \nADA Coordinator and/or her or his staff shall personally meet with each \nnew inmate housed in the Jail who is identified as having a Mobility \nDisability.  The meeting with the ADA Coordinator shall be for the purpose \nof ensuring that the inmate is housed in a cell and unit that accommodates \nhis or her Mobility Disability; has the appropriate Mobility Device(s) \nand/or other reasonable modifications; ensuring the inmate has equal access \nto Jail programs for which she or he is eligible but for his or her Mobility \nDisability; ensuring the inmate has access to grievance forms to raise \ndisability-related issues; and to advise the inmate of personnel who can \nassist her or him with reasonable modification needs.  For an inmate \nidentified as having a Mobility Disability who remains in the Jails for more \nthan six (6) months, the ADA Coordinator and/or her/his staff shall meet \nwith the inmate at least once every six (6) months until the inmate is \nreleased from the Jail. \nD.  The ADA Coordinator is charged with facilitating ADA Mobility-Disability \nrelated training to Custody Staff and Adult Custody Health Services Staff, \nand with monitoring programs and work assignments to ensure meaningful \naccess for all inmates with Mobility Disabilities.  The ADA Coordinator \nshall have sufficient staffing (the “ADA Unit”) to assist him or her \nregarding Mobility-Disability issues. \nE.  During any period where the ADA Coordinator is unavailable for more \nthan thirty (30) days, a sergeant or higher-ranked individual shall fulfill the \nduties of the ADA Coordinator position until the ADA Coordinator \nbecomes available or a replacement is appointed to the position. \nSanta Clara County ADA Remedial Plan Page 15 \n \n\n \nF.  The ADA Coordinator shall attend and complete a certificate-course \ndesigned for ADA coordinators and obtain a certification and maintain said \ncertification with updates and continuing education courses.  Any \nreplacement ADA Coordinator or interim ADA Coordinator shall obtain his \nor her ADA certification within twelve (12) months of starting in the \nposition. \nX.  TRAINING \nA.  The County provided eight (8) hours of mutually agreed upon ADA \ntraining to all DOC Academy Cadets, Custody Staff, and Adult Custody \nHealth Services Staff members in 2015 and 2016. \nB.  Training on New Policies and Procedures \n1.  Within six (6) months of the finalization of the revised policies and \nprocedures (see Section VIII), the Parties shall select a mutually \nagreed upon trainer to train on the revised policies and procedures.  \nWithin the same six (6) month period, the selected trainer shall \ndevelop a curriculum for training Custody and Adult Custody Health \nServices Staff on the revised policies and procedures.  The trainer \nshall then train Custody and Adult Custody Health Services Staff as \noutlined in Sections X.C.2 and X.D.2. \n2.  Within nine (9) months of the trainer’s preparedness to conduct the \ntraining, the trainer shall train 90 percent of Custody and Adult \nCustody Health Services Staff, and make reasonable efforts to train \nall Custody and Adult Custody Health Services Staff, on new \npolicies and procedures or revised policies and procedures adopted \npursuant to relevant topics in this Agreement.  Critical Staff, such as \nthe ADA Coordinator, ADA Unit, Intake Staff, and Medical \nProviders shall be prioritized for training during the first three \nmonths. \nC.  On-Going Training to Custody and Adult Custody Health Services Staff \n1.  The County shall provide eight hours of ADA training to all DOC \nAcademy classes. \n2.  After completion of the training in Section X.B, the County shall \nprovide a biennial training by a mutually agreed upon trainer to train \nCustody and Adult Custody Health Services Staff. \nSanta Clara County ADA Remedial Plan Page 16 \n \n\n \nD.  The County may engage a consultant to provide one 24-hour Train the \nTrainer (T4T) ADA training to prepare the County to take over the \nresponsibility of providing ongoing ADA training and the responsibility of \nproviding biennial refresher training. \nE.  The appropriate length, format, and method of the training for Staff, \nincluding different types of Staff, will be developed in consultation with \nPlaintiffs’ counsel.  Plaintiffs’ Counsel shall have the right to comment on \nall of the above-listed training modules in advance of their roll-out and to \nobserve any of the aforementioned trainings upon request. \nXI.  FACILITY MODIFICATIONS AND ADJUSTMENTS \nA.  Facilities \n1.  The County currently has two jail facilities: \na.  Main Jail (presently, Main Jail North and South). \nb.  Elmwood (presently, Elmwood Correctional Center for Men \nand Correctional Center for Women). \n2.  The County intends to build a new jail (“New Jail”).  However, if the \nCounty determines it will not build the New Jail, the parties will \nmeet and confer within thirty (30) days of such determination to \ndiscuss any additional construction that may be necessary at the Jails \nto meet the needs of inmates with Mobility Disabilities. \n3.  The County shall not house inmates with Mobility Disabilities at \nMain Jail South or Elmwood W1. \n4.  The County shall maintain ADA Accessible features required by this \nAgreement in operable working condition.  This requirement does \nnot prohibit isolated or temporary interruptions in service or access \ndue to maintenance or repairs. \nB.  New Jail \n1.  The New Jail shall be constructed in accordance with all applicable \nconstruction requirements under the Americans with Disabilities Act \n(“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq.; Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794; and California Government \nCode Section 11135 (“Section 11135”). \nSanta Clara County ADA Remedial Plan Page 17 \n \n\n \n2.  The New Jail shall include at least three percent ADA Accessible \ncells or 20 ADA Accessible cells, whichever is greater.

County of Santa \nClara, N.D. Cal. No. 5:16-cv-06594-LHK.  The Cole case is a federal \nclass action lawsuit challenging access to programs, services, and \nactivities at the Santa Clara County Jails on behalf of inmates with \nmobility disabilities.  You are a member of this class if you have a \nmobility disability and are incarcerated in the County Jails. \nThe Court has preliminarily approved the settlement of this matter.  This \nnotice explains the proposed settlement, how you can see it, and how \nyou can tell the Court whether you think it is fair. \nThis action does not seek money damages and none will be awarded.  \nNor does the proposed Consent Decree release any claims for monetary \ndamages class members may have. \nThe terms of the settlement are described in a document called the \nConsent Decree.  The Consent Decree implements a document called the \n“Remedial Plan,” which outlines specific conditions in the jails that the \nCounty has agreed to remedy. \nUnder the Consent Decree, the County will be required to develop \nimplementation plans to reform certain policies, procedures, and \npractices for providing accommodations to inmates with mobility \ndisabilities in the Jails, including in the areas of the County’s:  (1) intake \nprocess; (2) verification of mobility disability process; (3) issuance, \nretention, and denial of mobility device(s); (4) classification and housing \nof inmates with mobility disabilities; (5) tracking of inmates with \nmobility disabilities and disability-related needs; (6) provision of \nprograms and services; (7) ADA Coordinator; (8) training of custody \nand custody health staff; and (9) ADA-related grievance and request \nsystems. \nThe Consent Decree also requires that the County undertake significant \nconstruction to remedy physical barriers at the County Jails including \nincreasing the number of ADA-accessible cells, removing barriers in the \nCounty’s booking area, medical areas, dining areas, education and \n  \n[3303182.5]\n\n \nprogram areas, yards, and along paths of travel.  The County has already \nbegun these efforts and has allocated over $100 million dollars to ADA \njail improvements.  Finally, the Consent Decree requires the County to \nretain experts to monitor the County’s implementation of, and \ncompliance with, the Consent Decree.  The Consent Decree further \nprovides for plaintiffs’ counsel to also monitor the County’s compliance. \nYou can read about these changes in the Consent Decree.  The Consent \nDecree and Remedial Plan will be available in a binder in  each housing \nunit or, alternatively, you can read the Consent Decree and Remedial \nPlan by completing an Inmate Request Form and asking to see a copy.  \nCustody Staff will provide you a copy within three (3) days of your \nrequest. \nYou can also access the precise terms and conditions of the Consent \nDecree online at www.dralegal.org or www.rbgg.com, by contacting \nclass counsel at the addresses listed below, by accessing the Court \ndocket in this case through the Court’s Public Access to Court Electronic \nRecords (PACER) system at https://ecf.cand.uscourts.gov, or by visiting \nthe office of the Clerk of the Court for the United States District Court \nfor the Northern District of California at 280 South 1st Street, \nRoom 2112, San Jose, CA 95113. \nMichelle Iorio \nDisability Rights Advocates \n2001 Center Street, 4th Floor \nBerkeley, CA 94704 \nTelephone:  (510) 665-8644 \nKara Janssen \nRosen Bien Galvan & Grunfeld LLP \n101 Mission Street, Sixth Floor \nSan Francisco, CA  94105-1738 \nTelephone:  (415) 433-6830 \nPLEASE DO NOT TELEPHONE THE COURT OR THE COURT \nCLERK’S OFFICE TO INQUIRE ABOUT THE CONSENT DECREE. \nThe Court will keep jurisdiction to enforce the requirements of this \nsettlement.  The Court will hold a hearing on the fairness of this \n  \n[3303182.5]\n\n \nsettlement at [TIME] a.m. on [DATE], before the Honorable Lucy H. \nKoh at the United States District Court, Northern District of California, \nSan Jose Courthouse, Courtroom 8 - 4th Floor, 280 South 1st Street, San \nJose, CA 95113. \nThe attorneys who brought the class action will ask the Court to have \nDefendants pay for their attorneys’ fees and expenses for the work they \nhave performed and will perform in the future to monitor the County’s \ncompliance.  The Consent Decree limits the attorneys’ fees and expenses \nto $1 million for the work done so far and to $2.2 million for work that \nwill be necessary in the future to implement the Consent Decree and for \nplaintiffs’ counsel to monitor compliance in order to protect the rights of \nclass members. \nYou may object to the proposed Consent Decree in writing.  The County \nwill provide inmates with a cost-free mechanism for writing to the \nCourt.  You may also appear at the Final Approval Hearing, either in \nperson or through your attorney.  If you appear through your own \nattorney you are responsible for paying that attorney.  All written \nobjections and supporting papers must include the case name (Cole v. \nCounty of Santa Clara) and case number (No. 5:16-cv-06594-LHK).  \nObjections must be postmarked no later than [DATE], and sent to the \nfollowing address: \nClerk of the Court \nUnited States District Court \nNorthern District of California \n280 South 1st Street \nSan Jose, CA 95113 \nComments may also be submitted by filing them in person at any \nlocation of the United States District Court for the Northern District of \nCalifornia. \n  \n[3303182.5]",

Nos. 74, 75 \ntatsiD 16  Defendants. \nS d nr\neteh 17       \nintr\nUo\nN 18  WHEREAS, Plaintiffs David Cole, Leroy Benjamin, Erasmo Flores, Jr., Robert Phillips, \n19  and Brandon Williams (“Plaintiffs”) and Defendant County of Santa Clara (“Defendant” \n20  erroneously sued herein as County of Santa Clara Department of Correction, and the County of \n21  Santa Clara Office of the Sheriff) (collectively, “the Parties”) have advised the Court that they \n22  have settled the above-captioned litigation (hereafter, “Litigation”) and have memorialized the \n23  terms of their settlement in a settlement agreement (“Consent Decree”), which is attached to the \n24  Declaration of Lisa Ells in Support of the Joint Motion for Final Approval of Class Settlement as \n25  Exhibit 1, ECF No. 75-1; \n26  WHEREAS, the Court granted preliminary approval of the parties’ Consent Decree on \n27  December 7, 2018, finding that it “falls within the range of possible approval” and “is the product \n28  1 \nCase No. 16-CV-06594-LHK    \nORDER GRANTING FINAL APPROVAL OF CLASS SETTLEMENT AND MOTION FOR ATTORNEYS’ FEES \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 86   Filed 03/21/19   Page 2 of 6\n \n1  of arm’s-length, serious, informed and non-collusive negotiations between experienced and \n2  knowledgeable counsel who have actively prosecuted and defended this litigation,” ECF No. 73; \n3  WHEREAS, the Parties submitted their Joint Motion for Final Approval of Class \n4  Settlement on January 14, 2019 and jointly requested an order (1) finding the proposed Consent \n5  Decree’s terms and conditions are fair, adequate, and reasonable; and (2) approving the Consent \n6  Decree, ECF No. 74;  \n7  WHEREAS, Plaintiff submitted their Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs on January 14, \n8  2019, and attached the declarations of Lisa Ells, Stuart Seaborn, and Richard Pearl, ECF No. 75; \n9  WHEREAS, the Court requested supplemental information regarding Plaintiffs’ counsel’s \n10  billing records and resumes on March 18, 2019 and March 19, 2019, ECF Nos. 81 & 82; \n11  WHEREAS Plaintiff filed supplemental declarations of Lisa Ells and Stuart Seaborn in \n12  response to the Court’s request for supplemental information on March 19, 2019, ECF Nos. 83 & \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  84; \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  WHEREAS, the Joint Motion for Final Approval of Class Settlement and the Motion for \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Attorneys’ Fees and Costs came on for hearing before this Court on March 21, 2019; and \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  WHEREAS, the Court has considered the Joint Motion for Final Approval of Class \nS d nr\nee 17  Settlement, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs, the proposed Consent Decree, and \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  the arguments of counsel at the March 21, 2019 hearing;  \n19  NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED: \n20  1.  The Court finds that the Consent Decree is fair, adequate, reasonable, and free from \n21  collusion. Lane v. Facebook, Inc., 696 F.3d 811, 819 (9th Cir. 2012) (noting district court’s role in \n22  reviewing the substance of the settlement is solely to ensure that it is “fair, adequate, and free from \n23  collusion.” (quoting Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1027 (9th Cir. 1998)). It further \n24  appears that extensive evaluation of the merits has been conducted such that the attorneys for the \n25  Parties are able to reasonably evaluate their respective positions. It also appears to the Court that \n26  settlement at this time will avoid substantial additional costs to all Parties, as well as avoid the \n27  delay and the risks presented by further litigation regarding the issues addressed by the Consent \n28  2 \nCase No. 16-CV-06594-LHK    \nORDER GRANTING FINAL APPROVAL OF CLASS SETTLEMENT AND MOTION FOR ATTORNEYS’ FEES \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 86   Filed 03/21/19   Page 3 of 6\n \n1  Decree. It further appears that the Consent Decree has been reached as the result of intensive, \n2  prolonged, serious, and non-collusive arms-length negotiations, including multiple in-person and \n3  telephonic settlement sessions. The Court therefore finds that all the relevant Hanlon factors weigh \n4  in favor of granting final approval in this case. See Hanlon, 150 F.3d 1011 at 1026.   \n5  2.  The Court finds that the distribution of notice by all Parties was done in a manner \n6  and form consistent with the Court’s December 7, 2018 Order and the Court’s January 30, 2019 \n7  Order extending the objection deadline, ECF Nos. 73 & 79, and meets the requirements of both \n8  due process and Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n9  3.  The Court finds that the Consent Decree satisfies the requirements of 18 U.S.C. § \n10  3626(a)(1)(A) in that it is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the \n11  violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of \n12  the Federal rights of Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class.  \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  4.  The Parties’ Consent Decree is granted final approval pursuant to Rule 23(e) of the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, is incorporated by reference, and has the full force and effect of \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  an order of this Court. Pursuant to Section IX of the Consent Decree, the Court retains jurisdiction \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  to enforce the terms of the Consent Decree and to resolve disputes regarding compliance with the \nS d nr\nee 17  Consent Decree, subject to the limitations contained within the Consent Decree. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  5.  This is a class action certified pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) \n19  and the Court may award attorneys’ fees and costs to class counsel pursuant to Federal Rule of \n20  Civil Procedure 23(h). \n21  6.  Plaintiffs are “prevailing parties” under the federal fee shifting statutes 42 U.S.C § \n22  1983, 42 U.S.C. § 12205, and 29 U.S.C. § 794a(b). Plaintiffs are also successful litigants under \n23  California’s private attorney general statute, Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 1021.5. An award of attorney \n24  fees is appropriate under both Section 1021.5 and the separate fee-shifting statutes. \n25  7.  Plaintiffs are represented by counsel at Rosen Bien Galvan & Grunfeld LLP \n26  (“RBGG”) and Disability Rights Advocates (“DRA”). The requested 2018 rates for Plaintiffs’ \n27  counsel – $650 per hour for RBGG Partner Lisa Ells, $525 per hour for RBGG Associate Kara \n28  3 \nCase No. 16-CV-06594-LHK    \nORDER GRANTING FINAL APPROVAL OF CLASS SETTLEMENT AND MOTION FOR ATTORNEYS’ FEES \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 86   Filed 03/21/19   Page 4 of 6\n \n1  Janssen, $375 per hour for RBGG Associate Marc Shinn-Krantz, $340 per hour for RBGG Senior \n2  Paralegal Karen Stilber, $225 per hour for RBGG Paralegal Hanna Wallace and former RBGG \n3  Paralegal Sara Long, $775 per hour for DRA Managing Director of Litigation Stuart Seaborn, \n4  $655 for DRA’s Former Director of Litigation Mary-Lee Smith, $425 for DRA Staff Attorney \n5  Michelle Iorio, and $230 for DRA Paralegals Carly Schaaf, Jaqueline U, and Jessica Flores – are \n6  reasonable and appropriate for their work in this litigation. The rates sought here are in line with \n7  the market rates prevailing in the San Francisco Bay Area for work of similar complexity by \n8  lawyers of similar skills and experience. Plaintiffs’ counsel possess a significant amount of \n9  experience and expertise in disability rights, prisoners’ rights, and complex class actions, which \n10  they utilized in this case to secure exceptional results. \n11  8.  The time Plaintiffs’ counsel expended on this case was appropriate given the \n12  length, intensity, and nature of the litigation. Plaintiffs’ counsel effectively and efficiently litigated \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  this case. Legal work was allocated between and among Plaintiffs’ counsel to ensure work was \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  performed effectively and efficiently utilizing the expertise of each organization. In calculating \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  their lodestar, Plaintiffs have written off a total of approximately 10% of billable hours to date. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  The Court finds these billing judgment reductions to be reasonable and appropriate, in that they \nS d nr\nee 17  assure that Plaintiffs’ counsel have accounted for any undue duplication of effort or inefficiency. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  9.  From July 1, 2016 through March 18, 2019, DRA worked 1259.8 hours total and \n19  RBGG worked 1737.3 hours total. DRA wrote off 82.1 hours to claim 1177.7 hours, and RBGG \n20  wrote off 233.8 hours to claim 1503.5 hours. Therefore, the total hours claimed by Plaintiffs’ \n21  counsel are 2681.2 hours.  \n22  10.  After reasonable billing judgment reductions, Plaintiffs’ lodestar for work \n23  performed from July 1, 2016 through March 18, 2019 is $1,477,123.50, representing \n24  compensation for 2681.2 hours of work invested in this case.  \n25  11.  Plaintiffs’ counsel is entitled to recover the costs advanced to prosecute this \n26  litigation on behalf of the class. Plaintiffs have incurred costs of $14,860.53. \n27  12.  Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs’ counsel’s total lodestar plus expenses \n28  4 \nCase No. 16-CV-06594-LHK    \nORDER GRANTING FINAL APPROVAL OF CLASS SETTLEMENT AND MOTION FOR ATTORNEYS’ FEES \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 86   Filed 03/21/19   Page 5 of 6\n \n1  from July 1, 2016 through March 18, 2019 of $1,477,123.50 is reasonable and appropriate under \n2  federal and state law for the work performed and the success achieved for the class. This amount \n3  far exceeds the negotiated amount of $1 million provided for attorneys’ fees and costs through the \n4  effective date of the Consent Decree pursuant to Section VI(A) of the Consent Decree. The \n5  Consent Decree’s effective date is the date this Court grants final approval of this class action \n6  settlement.  \n7  13.  Defendant is ordered to pay Plaintiffs $1 million for reasonable attorneys’ fees and \n8  costs. Payment shall be made in a manner consistent with the parties’ negotiated language in \n9  Section VI of the Consent Decree.  \n10  14.  Attorneys are entitled to recover fees for time spent monitoring and enforcing \n11  compliance with settlement agreements in civil rights lawsuits. Monitoring work is compensable \n12  even if it does not result in additional judicial relief. Accordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  attorneys’ fees and costs for implementation and monitoring of the Consent Decree.   \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  15.  The agreed-upon monitoring process for this case is appropriate and necessarily \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  robust. The Consent Decree details extensive monitoring work to be performed by Plaintiffs’ \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  counsel, including work required to implement policies required by the Consent Decree. The \nS d nr\nee 17  parties have negotiated that such work, plus any enforcement work that proves necessary subject \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  to the narrow exceptions specified at Section VI(B)(2) of the Consent Decree, will be fully \n19  compensated by a fixed payment of $2.2 million for attorneys’ fees and costs incurred or \n20  attributable to any and all work performed from the effective date of the Consent Decree up \n21  through the term as defined in Section VIII of the Consent Decree. \n22  16.  Defendant is ordered to pay Plaintiffs $2.2 million for reasonable attorneys’ fees \n23  and costs for work performed from the effective date of the Consent Decree up through the term as \n24  defined in Section VIII of the Consent Decree. The Consent Decree Term is twelve months after \n25  the certificate of occupancy for the new jail has been issued and the Country has begun placement \n26  of inmates in the new jail. The new jail is expected to be constructed by mid-2023, which is four-\n27  and-a-half years from today. With likely delays in construction, the parties anticipate that the $2.2 \n28  5 \nCase No. 16-CV-06594-LHK    \nORDER GRANTING FINAL APPROVAL OF CLASS SETTLEMENT AND MOTION FOR ATTORNEYS’ FEES \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 86   Filed 03/21/19   Page 6 of 6\n \n1  million will cover Plaintiffs’ counsel’s reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs for worked performed \n2  over the next five-and-a-half years. Payment shall be made in a manner consistent with the parties’ \n3  negotiated language in Section VI of the Consent Decree. Specifically, the $2.2 million shall be \n4  paid into the Cole Jail Monitoring Qualified Settlement Fund (“QSF”). Plaintiffs’ counsel may not \n5  seek payment out of the QSF until monitoring and enforcement work is actually performed and \n6  must substantiate any request for disbursement from the QSF with records detailing the fees and \n7  costs incurred for which compensation is being sought.   \n8  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n9   \n10  Dated: March 21, 2019 \n11  ______________________________________ \nLUCY H.

Recitals \n9  A.  WHEREAS, after a series of arms-length settlement discussions, including \n10  significant exchanges of information and multiple proposals and \n11  counterproposals, as well as consideration of the risks, possible delays, and \n12  expense likely to result from prolonged litigation, the Parties have reached \n13  agreement on the terms of a proposed class settlement. \n14  B.  WHEREAS, this Consent Decree resolves the lawsuit filed on November 14, \n15  2016, entitled, Cole v. County of Santa Clara, United States District Court, \n16  Northern District of California, Case Number 3:16-cv-06594 LHK \n17  (hereinafter, “Action”) alleging that Defendant has discriminated against \n18  individuals with mobility disabilities incarcerated in Santa Clara County's \n19  (“the County”) Main Jail North, Main Jail South, and Elmwood Correctional \n20  Facility (collectively, “the Jails”) in violation of the Americans with \n21  Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq.; Section 504 of the \n22  Rehabilitation Act (“Rehabilitation Act”); 29 U.S.C. § 794; and California \n23  Government Code Section 11135 (“Section 11135”) (collectively, “State and \n24  Federal Disability Laws”).  Defendant denies all of the allegations against it. \n25 \n26 \n                                              \n1 Defendant here was erroneously sued as Defendant County of Santa Clara, the Santa \n27 \nClara County Department of Correction, and the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office. \n28 \n    1  Case No. 5:16-cv-06594-LHK \n  [PROPOSED] CONSENT DECREE \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 6 of 64\n \n1  C.

Budgetary allocation of over $100 million dollars to ADA jail \n5  improvements (not including the planned New Jail facility, which the \n6  County plans to build on the current Main Jail South location); \n7  2.  The completion of a number of other ADA improvements, including: \n8  a.  Construction of a number of ADA-accessible cells, housing \n9  units, restrooms, showers, and countertops, among other \n10  improvements; \n11  b.  Modification of the booking area and process to better \n12  accommodate ADA inmates; \n13  c.  The use of a screening tool to identify and assess inmates’ \n14  Mobility Disabilities upon intake; \n15  3.  The County’s ongoing review and revision, as needed, of all Jail \n16  policies, procedures, Post Orders, and forms to address ADA \n17  compliance issues; \n18  4.  Establishment of an ADA Coordinator and ADA Unit at an ongoing \n19  annual cost of $1,083,000; \n20  5.  Procurement of an ADA electronic tracking system costing $283,000; \n21  6.  Establishment of an electronic ADA Grievance System. \n22  Plaintiffs have not confirmed these representations and maintain that \n23  Defendant is not currently in compliance with the relevant disability access \n24  laws. \n25  D.  WHEREAS, through this Consent Decree, Defendant agrees to implement \n26  the measures set forth in the Remedial Plan (Exhibit A), subject to \n27  monitoring and, if necessary, enforcement by this Court as set forth in this \n28  Consent Decree. \n    2  Case No. 5:16-cv-06594-LHK \n  [PROPOSED] CONSENT DECREE \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 7 of 64\n \n1  E.  WHEREAS, by entry into this Consent Decree, the Parties intend to, and \n2  hereby do, resolve all claims that were actually, or could have been, raised in \n3  the Action by Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class.  The Parties believe this \n4  Consent Decree is fair, reasonable, and adequate to protect the interests of all \n5  Parties. \n6  F.  WHEREAS, the Parties stipulate that this Consent Decree complies in all \n7  respects with the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a).  The Parties further \n8  stipulate and agree, and the Court finds, that the prospective relief in this \n9  Consent Decree is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to \n10  correct the violations of federal rights agreed to by the parties, is the least \n11  intrusive means necessary to correct those violations, and will not have an \n12  adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system. \n13  II.  Definitions \n14  The following definitions will apply to the terms of this Consent Decree and the \n15  Remedial Plan (Exhibit A). The following definitions are intended to be interpreted \n16  consistent with State and Federal Disability Laws.  Unless explicitly stated to the contrary, \n17  any term not expressly defined in this Section or elsewhere in this Consent Decree or \n18  Remedial Plan that has an expressly defined meaning under State and Federal Disability \n19  Laws, shall have the meaning ascribed to it by current statute. \n20  This Remedial Plan uses the phrase, “Reasonable Modifications,” pursuant to 28 \n21  C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7), the Department of Justice regulations implementing Title II of the \n22  ADA; while the phrase, “reasonable accommodation,” is primarily in Title I of the ADA, \n23  see 42 U.S.C § 12111.  The terms are frequently used interchangeably by the courts. \n24  All other terms shall be interpreted according to their plain and ordinary meaning: \n25  A.  “ADA Accessible” means and refers to a facility, or any portion thereof, \n26  which meets the following standards:  the current edition, as of the \n27  commencement of physical construction or alterations, of the California \n28  Building Code, Title 24, Part 3 of the California Code of Regulations; or, the \n    3  Case No. 5:16-cv-06594-LHK \n  [PROPOSED] CONSENT DECREE \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 8 of 64\n \n1  2010 Americans with Disabilities Act Standards for Accessible Design \n2  (“2010 ADA Standards”), which consist of the Title II regulations at 28 \n3  C.F.R. part 35.151 and the 2004 ADA Accessibility Guidelines (“ADAAG”) \n4  at 36 C.F.R. part 1191, appendices B and D (hereinafter collectively, \n5  “Accessibility Standards”).  In the event of conflict between the standards, \n6  Defendant will use the standard which provides the greater level of access. \n7  B.  “ADA Tracking System” means a computerized, networked, real-time \n8  tracking system to enable Defendant to document and internally share \n9  information regarding inmates with a Mobility Disability. \n10  C.  “Jails or Jail” means the jails operated by the Santa Clara County \n11  Department of Correction/Sheriff’s Office Custody Division during the Term \n12  of the Consent Decree; and shall include the Main Jail Facility (consisting of \n13  Main Jail North and Main Jail South, collectively, “Main Jail”); and the \n14  Elmwood Correctional Facility, which includes the Correctional Center for \n15  Women or CCW (collectively, “Elmwood”); and the proposed New Jail. \n16  D.  “The County” means Santa Clara County, the Santa Clara County \n17  Department of Correction, and the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office, and \n18  the agents and employees of the Department of Correction, the Sheriff’s \n19  Office, and the County agents and employees who provide health care to \n20  inmates. \n21  E.  The following terms govern monitoring: \n22  1.  “Substantial Compliance” shall be interpreted to be consistent with \n23  Ninth Circuit law defining “substantial compliance” in the context of \n24  implementing consent decrees and similar court-supervised \n25  settlements; as such, substantial compliance will mean compliance \n26  with the essential requirements of the Remedial Plan that satisfies the \n27  Remedial Plan’s overall purposes and objectives and adherence to the \n28  provisions of the Remedial Plan in all material respects, recognizing \n    4  Case No. 5:16-cv-06594-LHK \n  [PROPOSED] CONSENT DECREE \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 9 of 64\n \n1  that perfection is not required.  Under Ninth Circuit law, non-systemic \n2  or unintentional deviations that are so minor or trivial as to not \n3  substantially defeat the object of the Remedial Plan shall not prevent a \n4  finding of substantial compliance. \n5  2.  “Unratable-In Progress” shall mean that Defendant has identified, and \n6  the applicable monitor agrees, that remediation efforts concerning \n7  certain material provisions of the Remedial Plan are not yet complete. \n8  3.  “Non-Compliance” shall mean that Defendant has not met most of the \n9  material components of the relevant provision of the Remedial Plan. \n10  F.  “Adult Custody Health Services Staff” includes all County employees who \n11  work in the Jails for Adult Custody Health Services and who have more than \n12  incidental contact with inmates. \n13  G.  “Custody Staff” includes all County employees who work in the Jails for the \n14  Custody Bureau, including correctional officers/deputies, who have more \n15  than incidental contact with inmates.  This does not include County \n16  employees whose duties relate solely to facility maintenance (i.e., \n17  electricians, janitors, food service staff). \n18  H.  “Days” refers to calendar days unless otherwise specified. \n19  I.  “Describe” means to provide a clear and detailed description of something \n20  done, experienced, seen, or heard. \n21  J.  “Document,” when used in this Consent Decree as a verb, means completing \n22  a record of information either in hard copy or electronic format. \n23  K.  “Effective Date” means the date the Court grants approval of this Consent \n24  Decree. \n25  L.  “Execution Date” means the date the Parties execute this Consent Decree. \n26  M.

The County assigns inmates \n8  security levels 1-4.  Level 1 is the lowest level of security and Level 4 is the \n9  highest.  The County may adopt a high, medium, minimum security \n10  classification model.  In the event this occurs, the Parties agree that Level 4 \n11  is high; Level 3 and Level 2 are medium, and Level 1 is minimum. \n12  P.  “Medical Provider”  means a County medical doctor, doctor of osteopathy, \n13  physician assistant, or nurse practitioner. \n14  Q.  “Mobility Device” means any non-motorized device designed for use by \n15  inmates with Mobility Disabilities such as wheelchairs, crutches, walkers, \n16  canes, braces, or other similar devices.  The limited circumstances for \n17  issuance of a motorized wheelchair are addressed in Section IV(B)(2), \n18  below.  There are three types of Mobility Devices referenced throughout the \n19  Remedial Plan:  (a) “Standard,” which refers to wheelchairs, walkers, \n20  crutches, and canes that are owned and maintained by the County; \n21  (b) “Generic,” which refers to Mobility Devices, excluding the devices listed \n22  in subsection (a), that the County may have readily available or that can be \n23  easily procured as an off-the-shelf generic durable medical good (including, \n24  but not limited to, a splint, boot, brace, sling, and/or wedge support); and (c) \n25  “Customized,” which refers to a Mobility Device that requires custom \n26  specifications to meet the needs of an inmate (including, but not limited to,  \n27  prosthetics, certain orthotics, and some wheelchairs).  “Personal” Mobility \n28 \n    6  Case No. 5:16-cv-06594-LHK \n  [PROPOSED] CONSENT DECREE \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 11 of 64\n \n1  Devices refers to a Mobility Device brought into the Jails by an inmate.  All \n2  other devices referred to herein are owned and issued by the County. \n3  R.  “Mobility Disability” and “Mobility Disabilities” means an impairment that \n4  affects an inmate’s ability to move physically and which substantially limits \n5  the inmate’s ability to perform one or more major life activities, including \n6  but not limited to standing, lifting, stooping, and/or ambulating. \n7  S.  “Plaintiffs” and “Plaintiff Class” mean all individuals with a Mobility \n8  Disability who are now, or will be in the future, for the Term of this Consent \n9  Decree incarcerated in the County Jails. \n10  T.  “Plaintiffs’ Counsel” means Disability Right Advocates (“DRA”) and Rosen \n11  Bien Galvan & Grunfeld, LLP (“RBGG”). \n12  U.  “Inmate(s)” shall be construed broadly to refer to one or more individuals \n13  incarcerated at, detained at, or otherwise housed, held, in the custody of, or \n14  confined at the Jails, including transportation. \n15  V.  “Safety-Security Assessment” means an individualized safety-security \n16  assessment that shall be based on reasonable judgment that relies on the best \n17  available objective evidence, to ascertain (1) the nature, duration, and \n18  severity of any risk, (2) the probability of potential injury, and (3) whether \n19  providing an alternative Mobility Device and/or reasonable modification \n20  would mitigate the risk.  In no case shall a Mobility Device be removed \n21  based solely on the nature of the inmate’s criminal charges or convictions. \n22  W.  “Staff” includes all full-time, coded employees who are employed by the \n23  County of Santa Clara and work in the Jails. \n24  X.  “Train” means to instruct in the skills addressed to a level at which the \n25  trainee has the demonstrated competency to implement those skills as, and \n26  when called for, in the training.  “Trained” means a demonstration of staff \n27  competency. \n28  NOW, THEREFORE, FOR AND IN CONSIDERATION OF the mutual covenants \n    7  Case No. 5:16-cv-06594-LHK \n  [PROPOSED] CONSENT DECREE \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 12 of 64\n \n1  and conditions set forth herein, the Parties hereto agree as follows: \n2  III.  Injunctive Relief \n3  The Parties’  Remedial Plan outlining the injunctive provisions is attached hereto as \n4  Exhibit A and fully incorporated by reference herein. \n5  IV.  Settlement Approval Process \n6  A.  The Parties will agree on a joint motion and will jointly move the Court, by \n7  November 13, 2018, for an Order granting Preliminary Approval of this \n8  Consent Decree and setting a hearing for Final Approval of this Consent \n9  Decree. \n10  B.  The Parties will negotiate and draft a proposed notice to the Class, which \n11  shall include the terms of this Consent Decree and their right to object \n12  thereto.  The Parties will make any edits or modifications to the draft notice \n13  should such edits or modifications be directed by the Court.  The proposed \n14  notice shall be attached to and incorporated into this Consent Decree as \n15  Exhibit B. \n16  C.  The Parties shall develop a plan for posting the notice.  At a minimum, the \n17  notice plan shall include the following:  (1) posting notice in all intake, \n18  housing, and programming units of the Jails; (2) posting notice on Plaintiffs’ \n19  Counsels’ websites; and (3) posting notice on the television-notification \n20  system inside the Jails.  All postings will be in accessible formats.  The \n21  Parties will provide alternate format copies of the notice upon request.  \n22  Notice will be posted/distributed by the Parties within twenty-one (21) days \n23  of the date of the Court’s Order granting preliminary approval, and shall \n24  remain posted for no less than thirty (30) days.  The Parties will submit \n25  declarations to the Court as part of the motion for final approval confirming \n26  that notice has been issued according to this paragraph. \n27  D.  Defendant shall provide notice as required by the Class Action Fairness Act \n28  (28 U.S.C. §§ 1711-1715) to appropriate officials as required by that Act. \n    8  Case No. 5:16-cv-06594-LHK \n  [PROPOSED] CONSENT DECREE \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 13 of 64\n \n1  E.  The Parties will take all procedural steps regarding the fairness hearings as \n2  may be requested by the Court and will otherwise use their respective best \n3  efforts to consummate the agreement set forth in this Consent Decree, and to \n4  obtain final Court approval of this Consent Decree and entry of Judgment. \n5  F.  If, for any reason, the Court does not approve this Consent Decree, the \n6  executed Consent Decree shall be null and void. \n7  G.  Upon final approval by the Court, this Consent Decree will be binding upon \n8  the Defendant, Plaintiffs, and all Class members and will constitute the final \n9  and complete resolution of all issues addressed herein. \n10  V.  Roles of Monitor and Plaintiffs’ Counsel \n11  A.  Role of Plaintiffs’ Counsel \n12  1.  Jail Facility Tours \n13  a.  Defendant shall permit Plaintiffs’ Counsel reasonable access to \n14  tour the jail facilities, interview staff and inmates, and observe \n15  practices related to Defendant’s compliance with the provisions \n16  of this Consent Decree.  Plaintiffs’ Counsel shall have \n17  reasonable access to interviews of staff and inmates to ensure a \n18  full evaluation.  Interviews with inmates shall be conducted \n19  confidentially.  Interviews with staff shall be conducted outside \n20  the presence of other jail staff or supervisors.  However, \n21  County Counsel shall be present during staff interviews and \n22  staff may decline to participate in any interview conducted by \n23  Plaintiffs’ Counsel. \n24  b.  Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s tours will not exceed more than three (3) \n25  tours annually. \n26  c.  Each tour shall last no more than two (2) days and be \n27  conducted by no more than one (1) Plaintiffs’ attorney or, \n28  alternatively, one (1) staff member.  Plaintiffs’ representative \n    9  Case No. 5:16-cv-06594-LHK \n  [PROPOSED] CONSENT DECREE \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 14 of 64\n \n1  shall debrief with County Counsel at the end of each tour.  \n2  Plaintiffs’ Counsel shall also write a report after each tour, to \n3  which Defendant may respond within 21 days.  Plaintiffs’ \n4  Counsel will provide Defendant’s counsel with 7 days advance \n5  notice of tour. \n6  2.  Requests for Documents and Individual Advocacy \n7  a.  Defendant shall provide Plaintiffs’ Counsel with access to \n8  records, reports, and documents that the Parties agree and \n9  identify are necessary to evaluate Defendant’s ongoing \n10  compliance with the Remedial Plan.  If the Parties cannot agree \n11  on the necessary documents, the Parties will meet and confer to \n12  address any disagreements.  The Parties shall cooperate so that \n13  such access is provided without unduly burdening Defendant.  \n14  Defendant shall provide Plaintiffs’ Counsel with such \n15  information within 14 days of the request, unless a longer \n16  period of time is necessary. \n17  b.  Where Plaintiffs’ Counsel has a good faith basis for doing so, \n18  Plaintiffs’ Counsel may bring individual inmates’ disability \n19  accommodation concerns to the attention of the County in \n20  writing, who shall respond in writing within 14 days.  This \n21  process is not meant to replace or circumvent the existing \n22  processes for submitting grievances or ADA requests to jail \n23  staff.  Plaintiffs’ Counsel will encourage inmates to make use \n24  of those existing processes except where exigent circumstances \n25  or failures of those processes have occurred. \n26  3.  Periodic Reporting \n27  a.  Defendant will provide Plaintiffs’ Counsel with the following \n28  reports:  (a) a monthly report from the ADA Tracking System, \n    10  Case No. 5:16-cv-06594-LHK \n  [PROPOSED] CONSENT DECREE \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 15 of 64\n \n1  identifying all inmates with Mobility Disabilities and the \n2  accommodations received, where the inmates are housed, and \n3  to which programs the inmates are assigned; (b) on a triannual \n4  basis, copies of all ADA-related inmate grievances and the \n5  written responses to the inmate grievances; and (c) on a \n6  triannual basis, copies of all ADA-related Inmate Request \n7  Forms and the written responses to these requests. \n8  b.  Production of the reports identified in subpart (a) of this \n9  provision is derived from the current ADA Tracking System, \n10  and the Parties acknowledge that the current ADA Tracking \n11  System is not integrated with the electronic medical record or \n12  other custody-based electronic systems and, thus, there are \n13  information sharing challenges that will not be cured until \n14  Defendant implements the planned electronic jail management \n15  software. \n16  c.  Within 30 days of the Effective Date of the Consent Decree, \n17  the Parties shall meet and confer to determine a list of any \n18  additional documents necessary for Plaintiffs’ Counsel to \n19  evaluate Defendant’s compliance with the Remedial Plan that \n20  will be produced on a periodic basis as well as the frequency \n21  for such productions. \n22  B.  Monitoring by Operational Monitor \n23  1.  Within three months of the execution date, the Parties shall jointly \n24  agree upon a Monitor (“Operational Monitor”) who will monitor \n25  Defendant’s compliance with the operational aspects of the Remedial \n26  Plan for the Term of this Consent Decree. \n27  2.  If, for any reason, the Operational Monitor can no longer serve or the \n28  Parties jointly wish to engage a different monitor, the Parties shall \n    11  Case No. 5:16-cv-06594-LHK \n  [PROPOSED] CONSENT DECREE \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 16 of 64\n \n1  attempt to agree on who shall be appointed to serve as the \n2  replacement monitor. \n3  3.  If the Parties are unable to agree on the replacement monitor, the \n4  Parties shall each submit a list of two (2) proposed new Operational \n5  Monitor candidates, all of whom will have already agreed to be \n6  subject to, and comply with, the Defendant’s contracting \n7  requirements, to the Honorable Magistrate Judge Nathaneal Cousins.  \n8  Prior to submitting their respective lists to Judge Cousins, the Parties \n9  agree to meet and confer to ensure that each proffered candidate is \n10  eligible to be considered.  If a proposed candidate is found to be \n11  ineligible due to his or her inability or unwillingness to comply with \n12  the County’s contractual requirements or due to a conflict of interest, \n13  the Party who proposed that candidate will be given an opportunity to \n14  propose an alternative candidate for consideration.  The Parties will \n15  submit written suggestions to Judge Cousins as to who to select from \n16  the lists.  Judge Cousins shall then select the new Operational Monitor \n17  from the lists. \n18  4.  Once the Operational Monitor is selected, the Operational Monitor \n19  will conduct two tours within the first year of the Execution Date of \n20  the Consent Decree and thereafter conduct biannual tours and \n21  program reviews.  Plaintiffs’ Counsel shall have the right to attend the \n22  tours.  The Parties may jointly agree in writing to conduct operational \n23  monitoring on a less frequent basis if the Parties agree such reduction \n24  is appropriate based on the current circumstances. \n25  5.  Prior to the Operational Monitor’s visit, Defendant shall advise the \n26  Operational Monitor which subjects are Unratable-In Progress and \n27  provide a brief reason why the subject(s) is not ready for evaluation of \n28  Substantial Compliance/Non-Compliance.  The Operational Monitor \n    12  Case No. 5:16-cv-06594-LHK \n  [PROPOSED] CONSENT DECREE \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 17 of 64\n \n1  shall still have the right to review the status of subjects Defendant has \n2  declared to be Unratable-In Progress. \n3  6.  The Operational Monitor will prepare a written report within 45 days \n4  after monitoring that will evaluate the extent to which Defendant has \n5  successfully implemented substantive provisions of the Remedial Plan \n6  and any plans to effectuate its terms, and recommend specific actions \n7  the Operational Monitor believes Defendant must make to achieve \n8  Substantial Compliance with the Remedial Plan.  The Operational \n9  Monitor shall report on whether, as to each material provision, the \n10  County is in Substantial Compliance, Unratable-In Progress, or Non-\n11  Compliance as those terms are defined herein. \n12  7.  The Parties will have twenty-one (21) days to make written comments \n13  or objections to the Operational Monitor report.  The Operational \n14  Monitor shall have twenty-one (21) days to respond to the Parties’ \n15  comments or objections by issuing a final report. \n16  8.  The Operational Monitor will conduct three tours of the New Jail \n17  unless the Parties agree that a third tour is unnecessary.  The \n18  Operational Monitor will conduct the first tour of the New Jail within \n19  thirty (30) days after the County begins occupancy of the New Jail.  \n20  The Operational Monitor will conduct the second tour of the New Jail \n21  as soon as he or she determines that there are sufficient numbers of \n22  inmates housed at the Jail to allow a meaningful evaluation of the \n23  New Jail’s compliance with this Consent Decree, to the extent that has \n24  not occurred at the time of the first tour.  The Operational Monitor \n25  will conduct a third tour unless the Parties agree that a third tour is \n26  unnecessary.  The Operational Monitor will prepare a written report \n27  within thirty (30) days after each tour that will evaluate the extent to \n28  which Defendant has successfully implemented substantive provisions \n    13  Case No. 5:16-cv-06594-LHK \n  [PROPOSED] CONSENT DECREE \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 18 of 64\n \n1  of the Remedial Plan in the New Jail and any plans to effectuate its \n2  terms, and recommend specific actions that the Operational Monitor \n3  believes Defendant may need to make, if any, to achieve Substantial \n4  Compliance with the Remedial Plan.  The Operational Monitor shall \n5  report on whether, as to each material provision, the County is in \n6  Substantial Compliance, Unratable-In Progress, or Non-Compliance, \n7  as those terms are defined herein.  The Parties will have fourteen (14) \n8  days to make written comments or objections to this report.  The \n9  Operational Monitor shall have fourteen (14) days to respond to the \n10  Parties’ comments or objections by issuing a final report. \n11  C.  Monitoring of Physical Alterations to Current Jails \n12  1.  Within three months of the Execution Date, the Parties shall jointly \n13  agree upon a Monitor with architectural accessibility expertise \n14  (“Architectural Monitor”) who will monitor Defendant’s compliance \n15  with the physical access portion of the Remedial Plan in the context of \n16  construction and/or alterations to the Jails for the duration of the Term \n17  of this Consent Decree. \n18  2.  If, for any reason, the Architectural Monitor can no longer serve or \n19  the Parties jointly wish to engage a different monitor, the Parties shall \n20  attempt to agree on who shall be appointed to serve as the \n21  replacement monitor. \n22  3.  If the Parties are unable to agree on the replacement monitor, the \n23  Parties shall each submit a list of two (2) proposed new Architectural \n24  Monitor candidates, all of whom will have already agreed to be \n25  subject to, and comply with, the Defendant’s contracting \n26  requirements, to the Honorable Magistrate Judge Nathaneal Cousins.  \n27  Prior to submitting their respective lists to Judge Cousins, the Parties \n28  agree to meet and confer to ensure that each proffered candidate is \n    14  Case No. 5:16-cv-06594-LHK \n  [PROPOSED] CONSENT DECREE \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 19 of 64\n \n1  eligible to be considered.  If a proposed candidate is found to be \n2  ineligible due to his or her inability or unwillingness to comply with \n3  the County’s contractual requirements or due to a conflict of interest, \n4  the Party who proposed that candidate will be given an opportunity to \n5  propose an alternative candidate for consideration.  The Parties will \n6  submit written suggestions to Judge Cousins as to who to select from \n7  the lists.  Judge Cousins shall then select the new Architectural \n8  Monitor from the lists. \n9  4.  Defendant has provided and continues to provide the Architectural \n10  Monitor with copies of architectural drawings (“plans”) for \n11  construction and/or physical alterations within the Jails covered by the \n12  Remedial Plan. \n13  5.  Defendant may consult directly with the Architectural Monitor \n14  regarding the plans and/or alterations for the Jails.  If Defendant and \n15  the Architectural Monitor have a dispute regarding the plans and/or \n16  alterations for the Jails, or reach a determination that technical \n17  infeasibility exists, Defendant shall advise Plaintiffs of these \n18  communications. \n19  6.  The Parties may agree to exclude specific projects from the plan \n20  review requirements. \n21  7.  Defendant anticipates that the planned construction will be completed \n22  in January 2022 at the earliest.  The planned construction is highly \n23  dependent on third-party contractors, and this time estimate is not \n24  binding. \n25  8.  Defendant will request that the Architectural Monitor conduct \n26  periodic site visits to review completed work as major projects or \n27  groups of projects are completed.  Plaintiffs’ Counsel may accompany \n28  the Architectural Monitor on these visits.  The Architectural Monitor \n    15  Case No. 5:16-cv-06594-LHK \n  [PROPOSED] CONSENT DECREE \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 20 of 64\n \n1  shall confirm in a written report, provided to the Parties within 45 \n2  days, whether each part of the completed work is ADA Accessible. \n3  9.  The Parties will have twenty-one (21) days to provide written \n4  comments or objections to the Architectural Monitor’s report.  The \n5  Architectural Monitor shall have twenty-one (21) days to respond to \n6  the Parties’ comments or objections by issuing a final report. \n7  10.  Once the physical alteration projects are complete, the Architectural \n8  Monitor determines compliance, and the Dispute Resolution Process, \n9  if applicable, is complete, Defendant is no longer subject to \n10  monitoring for physical alterations. \n11  D.  Monitoring of Construction of the New Jail \n12  1.  Defendant anticipates that the New Jail will be completed in 2023.  \n13  Construction of the New Jail is highly dependent on third-party \n14  contractors, and this time estimate is not binding. \n15  2.  After construction of the New Jail, the Architectural Monitor will \n16  conduct a site visit within thirty (30) days of completion of \n17  construction on the New Jail, and prepare a written report provided to \n18  the Parties within forty-five (45) days, evaluating whether each part of \n19  the completed work is ADA Accessible as required under the \n20  Remedial Plan.  Plaintiffs’ Counsel may accompany the Architectural \n21  Monitor on this site visit. \n22  3.  The Parties will have twenty-one (21) days to provide written \n23  comments or objections to the Architectural Monitor reports.  The \n24  Architectural Monitor shall have twenty-one (21) days to respond to \n25  the Parties’ comments or objections by issuing a final report. \n26  VI.  Attorney’s Fees and Costs \n27  A.  No later than ninety (90) days after the Effective Date, the County agrees to \n28  pay Plaintiffs’ Counsel the fixed sum of $1 million to cover and fully resolve \n    16  Case No. 5:16-cv-06594-LHK \n  [PROPOSED] CONSENT DECREE \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 21 of 64\n \n1  any and all of Plaintiffs’ and Plaintiffs’ Counsels’ claims against the County \n2  for attorney’s fees and costs incurred or attributable to any and all work from \n3  any time prior to the filing of this Action (including any claims from the \n4  structured negotiations phase), up through and including the Effective Date \n5  of this Consent Decree (hereinafter, “past fees”). \n6  B.  No later than ninety (90) days after the Effective Date, the County shall pay \n7  the fixed sum of $2.2 million to cover and fully resolve any and all of \n8  Plaintiffs’ and Plaintiffs’ Counsels’ claims against the County for attorney’s \n9  fees and costs incurred or attributable to any and all work performed by \n10  anyone from the Effective Date of this Consent Decree up through and \n11  including the end of the Term, as Term is defined in Section VIII \n12  (hereinafter, “future fees”).  These future fees shall be paid, using wire \n13  instructions stated at Section VI.B.1, into the Cole Jail Monitoring Qualified \n14  Settlement Fund (“QSF”), established by or on behalf of Plaintiffs’ Counsel.  \n15  Plaintiffs’ Counsel warrants and represents to the County that the QSF is a \n16  duly constructed and authorized Internal Revenue Code Section 468B \n17  Qualified Settlement Fund, as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section \n18  468-B and the associated Treasury Reg. 1.468B-1 of the Internal Revenue \n19  Code, and is qualified to receive this settlement payment for future fees.  \n20  Plaintiffs’ Counsel shall defend and indemnify the County, and hold the \n21  County harmless, with respect to any claims, demands, causes of action, \n22  suits, debts, liabilities, fees, taxes, charges, losses, or costs, of any nature \n23  whatsoever, relating to or arising from the formation, administration, or \n24  existence of the QSF or the payment by the County into the QSF. \n25  1.  The following, in combination with the complete account number \n26  which shall be provided by Plaintiffs’ Counsel to the County, \n27  constitute the wire instructions for the QSF: \n28 \n    17  Case No. 5:16-cv-06594-LHK \n  [PROPOSED] CONSENT DECREE \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 22 of 64\n \n1    Account Name:  EPTC Custodial Trust Settlement Trust \n2  Contribution Account \n3    Account Number:  X8544 \n4    Bank:  Union First Market Bank \n5    Routing Number:  051403164 \n6    Further Credit Instructions:  EPTC FBO – Cole Jail Monitoring \n7  Qualified Settlement Fund \n8  2.  The only exceptions to this fixed sum for future fees that are not \n9  included in the $2.2 million sum, above, are comprised of the \n10  following two scenarios; and these are the only situations in which \n11  Plaintiffs’ Counsel or anyone else may file a motion with the court \n12  seeking an award of additional reasonable attorney’s fees and costs: \n13  a.  The County brings an unsuccessful motion under the Consent \n14  Decree against Plaintiffs or Plaintiffs’ Counsel (“County’s \n15  Motion”) (Scenario 1); or \n16  b.  The Court has found the County to be in violation of provisions \n17  of the Consent Decree, and based on that violation, has ordered \n18  to County to comply with the Consent Decree (“order to \n19  comply”); and then, the County refuses to follow that order to \n20  comply (Scenario 2). \n21  c.  Under Scenario 1, Plaintiffs’ Counsel may only be awarded \n22  those reasonable attorney’s fees and costs for work performed \n23  that both a) arises after the filing of the County’s Motion and \n24  b) directly pertains to Plaintiffs’ Counsel preparing their filed \n25  response and attending the hearing, if any, on the County’s \n26  Motion. \n27  d.  Under Scenario 2, if the County refuses to follow the order to \n28  comply, Plaintiffs’ Counsel may file a motion to find the \n    18  Case No. 5:16-cv-06594-LHK \n  [PROPOSED] CONSENT DECREE \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 23 of 64\n \n1  County in contempt of court.  If Plaintiffs’ motion is \n2  successful, Plaintiffs’ Counsel may then only be awarded those \n3  reasonable attorney’s fees and costs for their work drafting and \n4  arguing the successful new contempt motion that is performed \n5  after both a) the Court enters the order to comply, and then b) \n6  the County fails to abide by that order to comply. \n7  C.  With the exception of the scenarios set forth in Section VI.B.2, no other \n8  attorney’s fees or costs award or payment of any sort is permitted to anyone \n9  under this Consent Decree. \n10  VII.  Dispute Resolution \n11  A.  If either Party seeks to engage in the Dispute Resolution Process, as defined \n12  herein, that Party shall give notice to the other Party of the grounds for the \n13  dispute.  The Party receiving the demand to engage in the Dispute Resolution \n14  Process will provide a written response within fourteen (14) days.  The \n15  Parties shall then engage in good-faith negotiations to attempt to resolve the \n16  dispute for a minimum of thirty (30) days from the date of the response.  \n17  Plaintiffs shall be permitted to bring their own expert into the Jails, at a time, \n18  scope, and for a duration mutually agreed upon by the Parties, as part of this \n19  thirty (30) day negotiation period in order to assist in resolving the dispute.  \n20  The County agrees to not unduly delay Plaintiffs’ expert’s access to the Jails \n21  under these circumstances. \n22  B.  If after meeting and conferring for at least thirty (30) days, the dispute has \n23  not been resolved, either Party may request that the Parties bring the dispute \n24  before Judge Cousins, or another mutually agreed upon neutral, for purposes \n25  of mediation.  If Judge Cousins is not available within forty-five days (45), \n26  the Parties will utilize the services of the Northern District of California’s \n27  Alternative Dispute Resolution program or request that the Court appoint \n28  another Magistrate Judge.  If this mediation is unsuccessful, either Party may \n    19  Case No. 5:16-cv-06594-LHK \n  [PROPOSED] CONSENT DECREE \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 24 of 64\n \n1  apply to the Court for relief that is bounded by and subject to the limitations \n2  and terms of this Consent Decree.  The Parties agree to work in good faith to \n3  avoid such applications wherever possible.  Any disputes that cannot be \n4  resolved through the Dispute Resolution Process outlined above may be \n5  submitted to Judge Cousins, in his capacity as a Magistrate Judge rather than \n6  as a mediator as delineated in Section IX.B. below, for a resolution that is \n7  bounded by and subject to the limitations and terms of this Consent Decree. \n8  C.  During the last nine (9) months of the Term of this Consent Decree, either \n9  Party may choose to immediately submit any disputes to Judge Cousins \n10  following completion of the thirty-day meet and confer process, in his \n11  capacity as a Magistrate Judge, for a resolution that is bounded by and \n12  subject to the limitations and terms of this Consent Decree. \n13  In the case of an emergency that poses an immediate and significant threat to \n14  the health and safety of inmates, and as such, the nature of the emergency \n15  makes completion of the Dispute Resolution Process impracticable, a Party \n16  may seek relief from the Court that is bounded by and subject to the \n17  limitations and terms of this Consent Decree, with the exception of not \n18  having to complete the Dispute Resolution Process, provided that the moving \n19  Party has notified the nonmoving party of the issue at least seventy-two (72) \n20  hours before seeking such relief from the Court. \n21  VIII.  Duration of the Consent Decree \n22  A.  The Parties agree that this Consent Decree, and all of its terms, will expire, \n23  and will no longer be enforced or enforceable in any court, twelve (12) \n24  months after the certificate of occupancy for the New Jail has been issued \n25  and the County has begun placement of inmates in the New Jail (the \n26  “Term”).  This Term is among the most material terms of this Consent \n27  Decree, such that absent this Term, the Parties would not have executed this \n28  Consent Decree.  To effectuate this Term, the Parties further agree to waive \n    20  Case No. 5:16-cv-06594-LHK \n  [PROPOSED] CONSENT DECREE \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 25 of 64\n \n1  their rights under 18 U.S.C. §§ 3626 (b), (e), and (f), including as set forth in \n2  paragraphs VIII.B and C, below. \n3  B.  Defendant agrees not to seek, support, or assent to termination of the \n4  Consent Decree before the completion of the Term, under any circumstances, \n5  except as set forth in paragraph VIII.C, below; and Plaintiffs agree not to \n6  seek, support, or assent to any extension of the Term, under any \n7  circumstances, except as set forth in paragraph VIII.C, below. \n8  C.  The only circumstance by which the Term of this Consent Decree may be \n9  extended is that the Parties jointly agree that the Term should be extended \n10  because they perceive that ongoing violations remain at the end of the Term \n11  and the Parties jointly agree that extension of the Term is the most efficient \n12  means to address such violations.  In that circumstance, the Parties will \n13  jointly move, and can only jointly move, the Court to extend the Term.  If \n14  Plaintiffs contend, and Defendant disputes, that ongoing violations exist at \n15  the end of the Term, and/or if Defendants do not agree that the Term should \n16  be extended, Plaintiffs’ sole remedy shall be to file a new lawsuit after the \n17  end of the Term of this Consent Decree. \n18  IX.  Reservation of Jurisdiction and Enforcement \n19  A.  The District Court of the Northern District of California shall retain \n20  jurisdiction to enforce, but under no circumstances expand or alter, the terms \n21  of this Consent Decree and shall retain jurisdiction to resolve any dispute \n22  regarding compliance with this Consent Decree and that such resolution is \n23  bounded by and subject to the limitations and terms of this Consent Decree, \n24  including that in Section VIII, above, regarding the Term of this Consent \n25  Decree.  The Court shall have the power to enforce the Consent Decree \n26  through specific performance and all other remedies permitted by law and \n27  equity throughout the Term of this Consent Decree and that such \n28  enforcement is bounded by and subject to the limitations and terms of this \n    21  Case No. 5:16-cv-06594-LHK \n  [PROPOSED] CONSENT DECREE \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 26 of 64\n \n1  Consent Decree, including that in Section VIII, above, regarding the Term of \n2  this Consent Decree. \n3  B.  The Parties consent to having all disputes between the Parties arising out of \n4  this Consent Decree, including those regarding compliance with this Consent \n5  Decree, heard and decided by Judge Nathanael Cousins, subject to the \n6  provisions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72, and that any relief from \n7  such disputes is bounded by and subject to the limitations and terms of this \n8  Consent Decree.  Should Judge Cousins no longer be available to serve in \n9  this capacity for any reason, only this provision, IX.B, will be deemed to be \n10  severable from the remainder of this Consent Decree, unless the Parties \n11  jointly agree on a new decision-maker. \n12  X.  Release \n13  Subject to the entry of Judgment by the Court and in consideration of the relief set \n14  forth herein, Plaintiffs, for themselves, the Class, and their successors and assigns, hereby \n15  fully and finally release and discharge Defendant and its successors, assigns, officers, \n16  directors, and past and present agents and employees (“Released Parties”) from any and all \n17  claims for declaratory or injunctive relief raised in the Action, or that could have been \n18  raised in the Action, relating to inmates with Mobility Disabilities (“Released Claims”).  \n19  The Released Claims do not include any claims to enforce the terms of this Consent \n20  Decree.  Nothing in this Consent Decree releases any damages claims to which Plaintiffs \n21  or other individual members of the Plaintiff Class may be entitled. \n22  XI.  Miscellaneous \n23  A.  This Consent Decree, which incorporates by reference the Remedial Plan \n24  (Exhibit A) and the draft Notice to the Class (Exhibit B), contains the entire \n25  agreement between the Parties.  This Consent Decree expresses the complete \n26  and final understanding with respect to the subject matter of this Consent \n27  Decree.  The Parties hereto understand and agree that the terms of this \n28 \n    22  Case No. 5:16-cv-06594-LHK \n  [PROPOSED] CONSENT DECREE \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 27 of 64\n \n1  Consent Decree supersede any prior discussions, understandings, or \n2  agreements between them related to the subject matter hereof. \n3  B.  The Parties each acknowledge that they are entering into this Consent Decree \n4  freely, knowingly, voluntarily, and with a full understanding of its terms.  \n5  The Parties acknowledge that they have consulted with counsel of their own \n6  choosing concerning this Consent Decree and that they were given \n7  reasonable time to review and consider the terms of this Consent Decree. \n8  C.  This Consent Decree shall be binding on all successors, assignees, \n9  employees, agents, and all others working for or on behalf of Defendant and \n10  Plaintiffs. \n11  D.  The language of this Consent Decree shall be construed as a whole according \n12  to its fair meaning, and not strictly for or against any of the Parties.  The \n13  terms of this Consent Decree are the product of joint negotiations and shall \n14  not be construed as having been authored by one party rather than another.  \n15  Any ambiguity shall not be construed against any Party.  Where required by \n16  context, the plural includes the singular and the singular includes the plural.  \n17  The headings in this Consent Decree are solely for convenience and will not \n18  be considered in its interpretation. \n19  E.  If any provision or provisions of this Consent Decree, other than the Term, \n20  shall be held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the validity, legality, and/or \n21  enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or \n22  impaired thereby. \n23  F.  This Consent Decree may be executed in counterparts, each of which will be \n24  considered an original, but all of which, when taken together, will constitute \n25  one and the same instrument. \n26  G.  This Consent Decree shall be governed by and construed in accordance with \n27  the laws of the State of California. \n28 \n    23  Case No. 5:16-cv-06594-LHK \n  [PROPOSED] CONSENT DECREE \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 28 of 64\n \n1  H.  To the extent any documents are required to be executed by any of the \n2  Parties to effectuate this Consent Decree, each party hereto agrees to execute \n3  and deliver such and further documents as may be required to carry out the \n4  terms of this Consent Decree. \n5  I.  Each signatory to this Consent Decree certifies that it, he, or she is fully \n6  authorized by the party it, he, or she represents to enter into the Consent \n7  Decree, to execute it on behalf of the party represented, and to legally bind \n8  that party thereto. \n9  Unless otherwise indicated in the Consent Decree, all notices or \n10  communications required by this Consent Decree shall be in writing by email \n11  addressed as stated below.

TERMINOLOGY AND DEFINITIONS \nThe terms and definitions set forth in the Consent Decree, to which this Remedial Plan is \nattached and into which this Remedial Plan is incorporated by reference, also control the \nterms and definitions set forth in this Remedial Plan. \nII.  INTAKE PROCESS \nA.  In a reasonably confidential setting, the County shall inquire during intake \nwhether an inmate has a Mobility Disability using an agreed-upon \nscreening tool. \nB.  The intake screening shall be conducted by a licensed registered nurse or, at \nthe County’s discretion, a Medical Provider. \nC.  During the intake screening, the County shall begin the verification process \nof whether an inmate has a Mobility Disability, as outlined in Section III, \nif: \n1.  The inmate self-reports a Mobility Disability; \n2.  The inmate’s Healthlink or ADA Tracking System record contains \ndocumentation of a Mobility Disability; or \n3.  The screening tool indicates that the inmate might have a Mobility \nDisability. \nD.  If the intake process outlined in Section II.C, above, indicates that an \ninmate might have a Mobility Disability, the County shall utilize the \nagreed-upon screening tool to determine what type of reasonable \nmodifications are necessary and available (e.g., changes to housing, lower \nbunk/lower tier) and shall provide such reasonable modifications while the \ninmate awaits verification pursuant to Section III. \nE.  Issuance and Retention of Mobility Devices at Intake \n1.  The County will issue a Standard Mobility Device promptly, but in \nany case no later than the timelines contained in Section IV, to any \ninmate who is determined to possibly need a Mobility Device \npursuant to Section II.D, subject to later verification pursuant to \nSection III, unless a Captain or Watch Commander determines and \ndocuments, based on a Safety-Security Assessment, that an inmate’s \npossession of a Mobility Device constitutes an immediate risk of \nSanta Clara County ADA Remedial Plan Page 1 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 32 of 64\n \nbodily harm to inmates or staff, or threatens the security of the \nfacility.  If providing an alternative Mobility Device would mitigate \nthe risk, the Captain or Watch Commander shall direct that the \ninmate be provided with the designated alternative. \n2.  The County acknowledges its obligations to comply with California \nPenal Code section 2656 pertaining to retention of orthopedic and \nprosthetic appliances. \n3.  Subject to Sections II.E.1 & II.E.2, inmates will be permitted to keep \ntheir Personal Mobility Device(s) during the intake process until the \nCounty issues a Standard or Generic (if available) Mobility Device, \nunless a Captain or Watch Commander determines and documents, \nbased on a Safety-Security Assessment, that the Mobility Device \nconstitutes an immediate risk of bodily harm to inmates or staff, or \nthreatens the security of the facility.  If providing an alternative \nMobility Device would mitigate the risk, the Captain or Watch \nCommander shall direct that the inmate be provided with the \ndesignated alternative. \nF.  If an inmate arrives at the Jail with a Personal Mobility Device that is \nexchanged for a County-owned Mobility Device, the County shall store the \nPersonal Mobility Device at the Jail at no cost to the inmate for return upon \nrelease and/or transfer from the Jail to another facility.  Alternatively, the \ninmate may arrange for pick-up of the Mobility Device.  The County will \nnot store a Personal Mobility Device for more than ninety (90) days after an \ninmate has been released or transferred. \nG.  The County shall advise inmates of the results of the intake screening and \nnotify the inmate of the right to request a physical examination by a \nMedical Provider to the extent the inmate disagrees with the results and/or \nreasonable modifications provided.  The County shall further notify inmates \nof the right to request use of a Personal Mobility Device consistent with \nSection IV below. \nH.  The results of the intake screening shall be documented and promptly \ninputted into the County’s ADA Tracking System. \nI.  As part of the intake process, all inmates shall be informed of the process \nby which they can request a reasonable modification while in custody, \nincluding the types of issues that can be reviewed by the County Jails’ \nADA Unit on an expedited basis. \nSanta Clara County ADA Remedial Plan Page 2 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 33 of 64\n \nIII.  VERIFICATION OF AN INMATE’S MOBILITY DISABILITY AND NEED \nFOR REASONABLE MODIFICATIONS \nA.  The County’s policy is to issue County owned Mobility Devices in all \ninstances unless:  (a) an inmate’s Personal Mobility Device is the only \nreasonable modification for the inmate’s Mobility Disability; or (b) the \nnature of the inmate’s Personal Mobility Device would pose particular \ndifficulty and/or harm to the inmate to remove, and/or removal is otherwise \nunnecessary due to the origin or nature of the device (i.e., a hospital-issued \nsling or brace). \nB.  An inmate may make a request to the ADA Unit to be able to continue to \nuse his/her Personal Mobility Device.  The ADA Unit and/or Medical \nProvider (where necessary) will evaluate the request based on an \nindividualized assessment as outlined in Sections III.D and III.E. \nC.  An inmate’s Personal Mobility Device may be retained by the County for a \nshort period of time sufficient to inspect the device for contraband.  In most \ncases the inspection should occur promptly, but in rare cases the inspection \nmay take longer, in which case it shall be completed within 14 days. \nD.  ADA Unit’s Responsibilities \n1.  The County’s ADA Unit shall review whether an inmate has a \nMobility Disability and/or what reasonable modification(s) are \nnecessary for the inmate within 7 calendar days under the following \ncircumstances: \na.  An inmate is designated during the intake screening as \npossibly having a Mobility Disability and/or the need for a \nreasonable modification; \nb.  An inmate makes a request to the ADA Unit, including \nthrough an ADA Request or ADA-related grievance as \noutlined in Section XIII, for evaluation of a Mobility \nDisability and/or the need for a reasonable modification; or \nc.  The inmate is referred by staff to the ADA Unit for evaluation \nof a Mobility Disability and/or the need for a reasonable \nmodification. \n2.  The ADA Unit shall document a Mobility Disability and/or what \nreasonable modification(s) are necessary in the ADA Tracking \nSystem. \nSanta Clara County ADA Remedial Plan Page 3 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 34 of 64\n \na.  If the ADA Unit determines that an inmate requires a \nMobility Device, the County shall issue it consistent with \nSection IV.D.1, and the ADA Unit will issue to the inmate \nappropriate documentation authorizing possession of a \nMobility Device. \nb.  If the ADA Unit determines that an inmate requires a \nreasonable modification related to their housing assignment \n(e.g., ADA Accessible cell, grab bars, dining areas, showers, \npath of travel, lower bunk, lower tier and/or a housing \nreassignment in order to access work, educational or other \nprograms), the inmate shall receive the reasonable \nmodification within 24 hours. \n3.  If the ADA Unit determines that an inmate’s Mobility Disability \nrequires evaluation from a Medical Provider, the ADA Unit shall \noffer an inmate a reasonable modification on a temporary basis \npending a medical appointment, which shall occur within 30 days. \n4.  The Parties agree that not all Mobility Disabilities and/or reasonable \nmodifications will require an appointment with a Medical Provider \nto verify the Mobility Disability and/or the need for a reasonable \nmodification.  Further, an inmate’s Mobility Disability and/or need \nfor a reasonable modification could change over time and will be \naddressed based on an inmate’s current status. \nE.  Medical Provider’s Responsibilities \n1.  If the ADA Unit refers an inmate for evaluation pursuant to Section \nIII.D.3, or if an inmate or Medical Provider first identifies a Mobility \nDisability at a medical encounter where the Medical Provider is able \nto assess the Mobility Disability, the Medical Provider shall verify \nwhether the inmate has a Mobility Disability and/or determine what \nreasonable modification(s) are necessary for the inmate unless such a \ndetermination requires a specialist-medical appointment. \na.  If the Medical Provider determines that an inmate requires a \nMobility Device, the County shall issue it consistent with \nSection IV.D.1, and the County will issue to the inmate \nappropriate documentation authorizing possession of a \nMobility Device \nb.  If the Medical Provider determines that an inmate requires a \nreasonable modification related to their housing assignment \nSanta Clara County ADA Remedial Plan Page 4 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 35 of 64\n \n(e.g., ADA Accessible cell, grab bars, dining areas, showers, \npath of travel, lower bunk, lower tier and/or a housing \nreassignment in order to access work, educational or other \nprograms), the inmate shall receive the reasonable \nmodification within 24 hours. \nc.  The County shall document the Medical Provider’s \ndetermination in the ADA Tracking system and refer the \ninmate to the ADA Unit for follow-up. \nd.  If the Medical Provider determines that an inmate requires a \nspecialist-medical appointment, the Medical Provider shall \npromptly request that appointment, and shall consult with the \nADA Unit in order to provide a reasonable modification, such \nas a Mobility Device and/or a housing change in accordance \nwith Sections III.E.1.a and III.E.1.b on a temporary basis \npending the outcome of the specialist-medical appointment. \n2.  If an inmate or Medical Provider first identifies a Mobility Disability \nat a medical or mental health appointment where the Medical \nProvider cannot assess the Mobility Disability (e.g., because the \nappointment is not conducted by the appropriate Medical Provider \nand/or is scheduled for a different purpose), the Medical Provider \nshall refer the inmate to the ADA Unit, and the County shall \ndocument the referral in the ADA Tracking System.  The ADA Unit \nshall then conduct a review consistent with Section III. \n3.  Medical Providers evaluating an inmate’s Mobility Disability and/or \nthe need for a reasonable modification(s) may determine at an in-\nperson evaluation that the inmate does not have a Mobility Disability \nand/or the inmate does not require a reasonable modification.  If \nsuch a determination is made, the County shall document the \nrationale for the Medical Provider’s finding in the ADA Tracking \nsystem. \nIV.  ISSUANCE, RETENTION, MAINTENANCE, AND DENIAL OF \nMOBILITY DEVICE(S) \nA.  The County’s policies and procedures for the ordering, retention, \nmaintenance, and denial/confiscation of Mobility Devices shall be reviewed \nand amended or drafted, as necessary to be consistent with this Remedial \nPlan. \nB.  Supply and Maintenance of Standard Mobility Devices \nSanta Clara County ADA Remedial Plan Page 5 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 36 of 64\n \n1.  The County shall maintain a reasonable supply of Standard \nwheelchairs, walkers, canes, and crutches. \n2.  The County shall inspect its supply of Standard Mobility Devices on \na quarterly basis to ensure sufficient operational quantities are \navailable. \nC.  Motorized Mobility Devices \n1.  Motorized Mobility Devices are generally not permitted in the Jails. \n2.   The ADA Unit and Medical Provider(s), in coordination with the \nAssistant Sheriff, shall determine the most appropriate manner to \naccommodate an inmate who requires a motorized Mobility Device \nin the exceptional circumstance where a Medical Provider or the \nADA Unit have determined, as outlined in Section III, that a \nmotorized Mobility Device is the only reasonable modification that \nwould meet the needs of the inmate with a Mobility Disability. \n3.  The County shall consult with Plaintiffs’ Counsel if the County \ndetermines that it will accommodate the inmate in need of motorized \nMobility Device in some other manner than permitting the inmate to \nutilize the motorized Mobility Device in the Jail. \nD.  Timing for Issuance of Mobility Devices \n1.  An inmate with a Mobility Disability in need of a Standard Mobility \nDevice shall be issued a Standard Mobility Device within four (4) \nhours, absent extenuating circumstances, following the ADA Unit or \nthe Medical Provider’s determination that an inmate needs a \nMobility Device. \n2.  Generic or Customized Mobility Devices may take time to order or \ndesign.  If the required Generic Mobility Device is available on site, \nit shall be issued within four (4) hours, absent extenuating \ncircumstances, following the ADA Unit or the Medical Provider’s \ndetermination that an inmate needs a Mobility Device.  For \nCustomized Mobility Devices and Generic Mobility Devices not \nkept on site, Adult Custody Health Services shall either obtain the \ndevice or, if the device requires a special order, place the order for \nsaid device within three (3) business days of identification of need.  \nThe County shall inform the inmate of an estimated time that the \nGeneric and/or Customized Mobility Device shall be provided.  The \nCounty shall check on the status of the Generic or Customized \nSanta Clara County ADA Remedial Plan Page 6 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 37 of 64\n \nMobility Devices every 30 days and shall provide the inmate with a \ntemporary reasonable modification to the extent necessary. \nE.  Maintenance of Mobility Devices \n1.  If an inmate’s Mobility Device is operable but in need of \nmaintenance or repair, and the inmate notifies the ADA Unit, the \nADA Unit shall assess and address the maintenance or repair need \nwithin seven (7) days. \n2.  If an inmate’s Standard Mobility Device becomes inoperable and the \ninmate reports the problem to custody staff, the County shall provide \na replacement within twenty-four (24) hours. \n3.  If an inmate advises the ADA Unit and/or a Medical Provider that a \nGeneric or Customized Mobility Device is in need of maintenance, \nrepair, or replacement, the County shall coordinate maintenance, \nrepair, or replacement as necessary.  In the interim, the ADA Unit \nshall replace the Generic Mobility Device if such device is kept in \nstock on site or provide the inmate with a Standard Mobility Device \non a temporary basis and evaluate the provision of other interim \nreasonable modification(s). \nF.  Safety-Security Assessments After Intake \n1.  The County shall permit an inmate to keep a Mobility Device unless \na Captain or Watch Commander determines and documents, based \non a Safety-Security Assessment, that a Mobility Device constitutes \nan immediate risk of bodily harm to inmates or staff, or threatens the \nsecurity of the facility. \n2.  If the Captain or Watch Commander makes such a determination, \nthey shall document the decision, and reasons for it, as well as the \ndate of decision, in writing, and shall promptly consult with a \nMedical Provider and the ADA Coordinator to determine if an \nappropriate alternative reasonable modification can be provided, in \nwhich case an alternative reasonable modification shall be provided.  \nThe Captain, Watch Commander, Medical Provider, or ADA \nCoordinator shall document the nature of any alternative reasonable \nmodification(s) provided in the ADA Tracking System. \nSanta Clara County ADA Remedial Plan Page 7 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 38 of 64\n \n3.  If the County removes an inmate’s Mobility Device following a \nSafety-Security Assessment, the County shall reevaluate the Safety-\nSecurity Assessment as follows: \na.  The inmate must be reevaluated by the ADA Unit to \ndetermine if he or she can safely possess the Mobility Device \na minimum of every seven (7) days if the device is removed \nduring the intake process. \nb.  The inmate must be reevaluated by the ADA Unit to \ndetermine if he or she can safely possess the Mobility Device \na minimum of every fourteen (14) days if the device is \nremoved at any other time. \nc.  For each evaluation pursuant to Section IV.F.3.a and \nIV.F.3.b, the ADA Unit shall make a recommendation to the \nCaptain of the facility or his or her superiors regarding \nwhether the Mobility Device should continue to be removed \nfrom the inmate and shall document the rationale in the ADA \nTracking System. \n4.  Notwithstanding the provisions above, the County acknowledges its \nobligations to comply with California Penal Code section 2656 \npertaining to retention of orthopedic and prosthetic appliances. \nV.  CLASSIFICATION AND HOUSING OF INMATES WITH MOBILITY-\nDISABILITIES \nA.  The County shall review its Classification Policies and Procedures and \nrevise, as necessary, to be consistent with this Remedial Plan. \nB.  An inmate’s need for a Mobility Device in a housing unit shall not be a \nbasis for assignment to the infirmary, a medical unit, or a mental health \nhousing unit. \nC.  That an inmate has a Mobility Disability and/or requires reasonable \nmodifications for that disability (including the provision of Mobility \nDevices) shall not be a factor in determining an inmate’s security \nclassification. \nD.  Inmates identified as having a Mobility Disability shall be placed in \nhousing that is consistent with their security classification and their \naccessibility needs.  Not all inmates with a Mobility Disability require an \nADA Accessible cell or unit, but may require reasonable modifications \nSanta Clara County ADA Remedial Plan Page 8 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 39 of 64\n \nrelated to housing such as, but not limited to, a lower bunk/lower tier \nassignment, or access to ADA Accessible shower facilities. \nE.  This Remedial Plan recognizes that, while additional ADA Accessible \nhousing is constructed pursuant to the Construction Remedial Plan (Section \nXI), ADA Accessible housing may not be immediately available for every \ninmate needing such housing consistent with their classification.  As ADA \nAccessible housing is completed and brought online under the Construction \nRemedial Plan, inmates in need of ADA Accessible housing shall be \nhoused consistent with their needs.  In the interim, the Parties agree that \ninmates with Mobility Disabilities who require ADA Accessible housing \nshall be housed as follows: \n1.  Male Inmates \na.  Inmates determined to be a Level 1 classification shall be \nhoused in Barracks 3 at the Elmwood Minimum Camp unless \nBarracks 3 is closed for repairs, construction, or other \nextenuating circumstances, in which case these inmates shall \nbe housed in Special Housing. \nb.  Inmates who use wheelchairs, and who are determined to be \nLevel 2, 3, or 4 security level inmates, shall be housed in \nMain Jail Unit 2B and/or Elmwood Unit M3. \nc.  Inmates who use Mobility Devices other than wheelchairs \nand who are determined to be Level 2, 3, or 4 security level \ninmates, shall be assessed on an individualized basis and \nhoused as appropriate. \n2.  Female Inmates \na.  Inmates who can be appropriately housed in a dorm setting \nbased on their security level shall be housed in W2.  The \nADA Unit will promptly conduct an individualized \nassessment to determine if additional reasonable \nmodification(s) are necessary and develop a plan to address \nthose needs. \nb.  Inmates who require cell-style housing based on their security \nlevel shall be housed in W4.  The ADA Unit shall promptly \nconduct an individualized assessment to determine if \nadditional reasonable modification(s) are necessary and \ndevelop a plan to address those needs.  The County shall \nSanta Clara County ADA Remedial Plan Page 9 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 40 of 64\n \npromptly consult with Plaintiffs’ Counsel regarding the \nCounty’s planned reasonable modifications for an inmate \nrequiring cell-style housing who, the County has determined \nas outlined in Section III, requires full-time use of a \nwheelchair. \nF.  If the housing units listed in Sections V.E.1 and/or V.E.2 are closed for \nrepairs, construction, or other extenuating circumstances, the County shall \npromptly (1) notify Plaintiffs’ Counsel of the closure(s), and (2) provide \nPlaintiffs’ Counsel with a list of where inmates with Mobility Disabilities \nwill be housed for the duration of the closure(s).  During such closure(s), \nthe ADA Unit shall promptly conduct an individualized assessment to \ndetermine if additional reasonable modifications are necessary for the \naffected inmates with Mobility Disabilities and develop a plan to address \nthose needs. \nVI.  TRACKING INMATES WITH MOBILITY DISABILITIES (“ADA \nTRACKING SYSTEM”) \nA.  The County shall use an ADA Tracking System to document and share \ninternally information regarding inmates with Mobility Disabilities. \nB.  The ADA Tracking System shall identify and track all inmates with a \nMobility Disability. \nC.  The ADA Tracking System shall have the following functional capabilities: \n1.  Code the type of Mobility Disability and the reasonable \nmodifications an inmate requires for the Mobility Disability (e.g., \nMobility Devices, lower bunks, ground floor housing). \n2.  Track all programs, services, and reasonable modifications offered \nto an inmate with a Mobility Disability throughout his/her \nincarceration. \nD.  The County shall designate staff that shall be responsible for using the \nADA Tracking System.  Designated Staff shall include Classification Staff, \nthe ADA Coordinator and his or her staff, the Facility Watch Commander, \nDivision Commander, Administrative Sergeant, Program Managers, and \nstaff from Adult Custody Health Services (“Designated Staff”). \nE.  Designated Staff, both during the intake and booking process and during \nclinical encounters, shall be responsible for adding or modifying \nSanta Clara County ADA Remedial Plan Page 10 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 41 of 64\n \ninformation regarding the nature of an inmate’s Mobility Disability and \nnecessary reasonable modifications for that Mobility Disability. \nF.  Designated Staff shall be able and expected to view information in the \nsystem to ensure that the County provides reasonable modifications to \ninmates with Mobility Disabilities. \nG.  Designated Staff shall also be responsible for updating the system with \ninformation regarding the reasonable modifications provided during the \ninmate’s incarceration and any subsequent returns to custody. \nH.  Housing unit, education, and program office staff shall be provided with a \nreport listing all inmates with a Mobility Disability in the relevant unit or \nprogram, as well as those inmates’ needing reasonable modifications for a \nMobility Disability.  The report shall be updated and provided in written \nform to such staff at least once per week.  Additionally, information from \nthe report shall be communicated in writing to staff whenever an inmate \nwith a Mobility Disability is assigned to the unit or program. \nI.  All Designated Staff shall be trained to properly use the ADA Tracking \nSystem.  The training shall occur on site over the course of six months after \nimplementation begins. \nJ.  The County shall develop and maintain appropriate policies outlining who \ncan access and modify information in the ADA Tracking System. \nVII.  PROGRAMS AND SERVICES \nA.  The County’s policies and procedures pertaining to programs and services \nshall be reviewed and amended or drafted, as necessary, to be consistent \nwith this Remedial Plan. \nB.  The County shall ensure that an inmate with a Mobility Disability has equal \naccess to all inmate programs and services for which an inmate would be \neligible but for that Mobility Disability—including, but not limited to \neducational, vocational, work, recreational, visiting, medical, mental health, \nsubstance abuse, self-improvement, and religious programs, as well as early \nrelease programs such as the Custody Alternative Supervision Program \n(CASP)—on a space available basis, consistent with the inmate’s security \nclassification. \nC.  If an inmate’s Mobility Disability interferes with his or her ability to \nparticipate in a program or service for which he or she is otherwise eligible, \nthe ADA Coordinator shall first determine whether the individual inmate \nSanta Clara County ADA Remedial Plan Page 11 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 42 of 64\n \ncan participate in the program or service if the County provided a \nreasonable modification.  If a non-structural reasonable modification will \nallow an inmate with a Mobility Disability to participate in a program, the \nCounty shall provide the non-structural reasonable modification and shall \nallow the inmate to participate in the program. \nD.  If a non-structural reasonable modification would result in a fundamental \nalteration of the program, the County must take actions that would not \nresult in such an alteration but would nevertheless ensure that the inmate \nwith a Mobility Disability receives the benefits or services offered by the \nCounty’s program. \nE.  The County can refuse to provide a reasonable modification to an inmate \nwith a Mobility Disability who is otherwise qualified for a program or \nservice if:  (1) the inmate’s participation in the program would pose a direct \nthreat to the health or safety of others, or (2) there is a reason for doing so \nthat is reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest(s), as \ndetermined by the ADA Unit in coordination with the Assistant Sheriff.  \nRefusal to provide a reasonable modification pursuant to either of the \npreceding exceptions shall be based on a Safety-Security Assessment.  If \nproviding an alternative Mobility Device would mitigate the risk, the \nCounty shall provide the inmate with the designated alternative as \nexpeditiously as possible. \nF.  If the County relies upon any of the above exceptions to deny an inmate \nwith a Mobility Disability the opportunity to participate in a program or \nservice, the ADA Unit must document the basis for the determination in the \nADA Tracking System. \nG.  Location of Programs and Services \n1.  The Parties have designated structural changes in the Construction \nRemedial Plan outlined in Section XI in order to provide program \naccessibility to inmates with Mobility Disabilities. \n2.  In order to address program accessibility, the County agrees to \nprovide programming and services in the areas designated in the \nConstruction Plan (Section XI) as the portions of the Construction \nPlan providing accessibility to programs and services are completed. \n3.  As an alternative to providing programming and services in areas \ndesignated in the Construction Plan, the County may continue to \nutilize nonstructural methods to provide accessibility to programs \nand services, including but not limited to acquisition or redesign of \nSanta Clara County ADA Remedial Plan Page 12 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 43 of 64\n \nequipment, assignment of aides to inmates with Mobility Disabilities \nor, at the County’s election, the provision of services at alternate \naccessible sites. \n4.  While the County is undertaking the construction described in \nSection XI of this Remedial Plan, the Parties agree that the County \nshall take the following interim measures to provide accessibility to \nprograms and service for inmates with Mobility Disabilities: \na.  The County may use inmates or Custody Staff to push \ninmates in wheelchairs to a program or service along paths of \ntravel agreed upon by the Parties.  Pending completion of \nphysical modifications to the paths of travel, wheelchair \npushers may be used as an interim measure.  Wheelchair \npushers used on an interim basis are subject to the training \nrequirements and other provisions outlined in Section \nVII.G.7. \nb.  Assignment of aides to inmates with Mobility Disabilities. \n5.  Where the County cannot provide programs or services at the \nlocations designated in the Construction Plan and cannot find \nnonstructural measures to provide accessibility to programs and \nservices, the County may refuse to provide the program or service to \nan inmate with a Mobility Disability only upon a showing that doing \nso would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the \nprogram, service, or activity, or would result in undue financial and \nadministrative burdens. \n6.  The County shall maintain ADA Accessible facilities in operable \nworking condition.  Isolated or temporary interruptions in access to \nthese facilities due to maintenance or repairs are not prohibited if the \nCounty is exercising reasonable diligence in addressing the \nmaintenance or repairs. \n7.  Once paths of travel are made compliant with this Remedial Plan, \nwheelchair pushers may continue to be used for inmates who need \nassistance traveling long distances, unless otherwise requested by the \ninmates.  Appropriately screened inmates and/or Custody Staff \nchosen to assist inmates who use wheelchairs shall receive initial \nand periodic training as to their job duties and performance criteria.  \nThe training shall cover how to safely and properly assist inmates \nwith Mobility Disabilities.  The ADA Unit shall evaluate wheelchair \nSanta Clara County ADA Remedial Plan Page 13 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 44 of 64\n \npushers which shall include feedback from the inmates with \nMobility Disabilities.  Inmates with Mobility Disabilities have the \nright to refuse a wheelchair pusher, and in that circumstance, the \nADA Unit shall determine an appropriate alternative reasonable \nmodification. \nH.  If an inmate with a Mobility Disability requires transportation in a \nvehicle—e.g., to court or to a medical appointment at an outside facility—\nthe vehicle used to transport the inmate must be ADA Accessible.  \nSpecifically, inmates who use wheelchairs on permanent bases and/or \ninmates who have difficulty navigating steps without assistance must be \ntransported in vehicles equipped with a wheelchair lift and other safety \nequipment mandated by the Department of Motor Vehicles and the \nDepartment of Transportation.  If the Department of Motor Vehicles and \nDepartment of Transportation standards conflict, the applicable standard \nthat provides greater protections to individuals with a Mobility Disability \nshall govern. \nVIII.  POLICY REVIEW AND REVISION \nA.  The County is reviewing and revising, as needed, all policies, procedures, \nPost Orders, and forms, including those for Adult Custody Health Services, \nand the Inmate Orientation book, to be consistent with the provisions in this \nRemedial Plan.  Plaintiffs’ Counsel shall be provided the opportunity to \ncomment on these documents. \nB.  Policy Revision Process \n1.  Within 30 days of the execution of the Consent Decree, the Parties \nshall meet and confer to designate the policies that require revision \nto address key portions of this Remedial Plan \n2.  The County shall provide Plaintiffs’ Counsel with draft proposed \nrevisions to the agreed upon policies within 120 days of the \nexecution of the Consent Decree unless a longer timeframe is \nmutually agreed upon by the Parties. \n3.  The designated policies shall be finalized with one year of the \nexecution of the Consent Decree unless the Parties agree to a longer \ntime frame. \nC.  The County shall train relevant Staff on new or revised policies and \nprocedures as detailed in Section X. \nSanta Clara County ADA Remedial Plan Page 14 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 45 of 64\n \nIX.  ADA COORDINATOR \nA.  The County has appointed a full-time ADA Coordinator, a lieutenant who \nreports directly to the Assistant Sheriff.  The ADA Coordinator shall \noversee all issues related to inmates with Mobility Disabilities, including, \nbut not limited to, classification; housing; inspection, maintenance, \nprovision, and removal of Mobility Devices; and responding to Mobility \nDisability-related requests and inmate grievances pursuant to County \npolicy. \nB.  The County shall not modify the job description of the ADA Coordinator \nwithout consultation with Plaintiffs’ Counsel. \nC.  As soon as practical, but under no circumstances more than ninety (90) \ndays after an inmate has been identified as having a Mobility Disability, the \nADA Coordinator and/or her or his staff shall personally meet with each \nnew inmate housed in the Jail who is identified as having a Mobility \nDisability.  The meeting with the ADA Coordinator shall be for the purpose \nof ensuring that the inmate is housed in a cell and unit that accommodates \nhis or her Mobility Disability; has the appropriate Mobility Device(s) \nand/or other reasonable modifications; ensuring the inmate has equal access \nto Jail programs for which she or he is eligible but for his or her Mobility \nDisability; ensuring the inmate has access to grievance forms to raise \ndisability-related issues; and to advise the inmate of personnel who can \nassist her or him with reasonable modification needs.  For an inmate \nidentified as having a Mobility Disability who remains in the Jails for more \nthan six (6) months, the ADA Coordinator and/or her/his staff shall meet \nwith the inmate at least once every six (6) months until the inmate is \nreleased from the Jail. \nD.  The ADA Coordinator is charged with facilitating ADA Mobility-Disability \nrelated training to Custody Staff and Adult Custody Health Services Staff, \nand with monitoring programs and work assignments to ensure meaningful \naccess for all inmates with Mobility Disabilities.  The ADA Coordinator \nshall have sufficient staffing (the “ADA Unit”) to assist him or her \nregarding Mobility-Disability issues. \nE.  During any period where the ADA Coordinator is unavailable for more \nthan thirty (30) days, a sergeant or higher-ranked individual shall fulfill the \nduties of the ADA Coordinator position until the ADA Coordinator \nbecomes available or a replacement is appointed to the position. \nSanta Clara County ADA Remedial Plan Page 15 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 46 of 64\n \nF.  The ADA Coordinator shall attend and complete a certificate-course \ndesigned for ADA coordinators and obtain a certification and maintain said \ncertification with updates and continuing education courses.  Any \nreplacement ADA Coordinator or interim ADA Coordinator shall obtain his \nor her ADA certification within twelve (12) months of starting in the \nposition. \nX.  TRAINING \nA.  The County provided eight (8) hours of mutually agreed upon ADA \ntraining to all DOC Academy Cadets, Custody Staff, and Adult Custody \nHealth Services Staff members in 2015 and 2016. \nB.  Training on New Policies and Procedures \n1.  Within six (6) months of the finalization of the revised policies and \nprocedures (see Section VIII), the Parties shall select a mutually \nagreed upon trainer to train on the revised policies and procedures.  \nWithin the same six (6) month period, the selected trainer shall \ndevelop a curriculum for training Custody and Adult Custody Health \nServices Staff on the revised policies and procedures.  The trainer \nshall then train Custody and Adult Custody Health Services Staff as \noutlined in Sections X.C.2 and X.D.2. \n2.  Within nine (9) months of the trainer’s preparedness to conduct the \ntraining, the trainer shall train 90 percent of Custody and Adult \nCustody Health Services Staff, and make reasonable efforts to train \nall Custody and Adult Custody Health Services Staff, on new \npolicies and procedures or revised policies and procedures adopted \npursuant to relevant topics in this Agreement.  Critical Staff, such as \nthe ADA Coordinator, ADA Unit, Intake Staff, and Medical \nProviders shall be prioritized for training during the first three \nmonths. \nC.  On-Going Training to Custody and Adult Custody Health Services Staff \n1.  The County shall provide eight hours of ADA training to all DOC \nAcademy classes. \n2.  After completion of the training in Section X.B, the County shall \nprovide a biennial training by a mutually agreed upon trainer to train \nCustody and Adult Custody Health Services Staff. \nSanta Clara County ADA Remedial Plan Page 16 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-06594-LHK   Document 72   Filed 12/07/18   Page 47 of 64\n \nD.  The County may engage a consultant to provide one 24-hour Train the \nTrainer (T4T) ADA training to prepare the County to take over the \nresponsibility of providing ongoing ADA training and the responsibility of \nproviding biennial refresher training. \nE.  The appropriate length, format, and method of the training for Staff, \nincluding different types of Staff, will be developed in consultation with \nPlaintiffs’ counsel.  Plaintiffs’ Counsel shall have the right to comment on \nall of the above-listed training modules in advance of their roll-out and to \nobserve any of the aforementioned trainings upon request. \nXI.  FACILITY MODIFICATIONS AND ADJUSTMENTS \nA.  Facilities \n1.  The County currently has two jail facilities: \na.  Main Jail (presently, Main Jail North and South). \nb.  Elmwood (presently, Elmwood Correctional Center for Men \nand Correctional Center for Women). \n2.  The County intends to build a new jail (“New Jail”).  However, if the \nCounty determines it will not build the New Jail, the parties will \nmeet and confer within thirty (30) days of such determination to \ndiscuss any additional construction that may be necessary at the Jails \nto meet the needs of inmates with Mobility Disabilities. \n3.  The County shall not house inmates with Mobility Disabilities at \nMain Jail South or Elmwood W1. \n4.  The County shall maintain ADA Accessible features required by this \nAgreement in operable working condition.  This requirement does \nnot prohibit isolated or temporary interruptions in service or access \ndue to maintenance or repairs. \nB.  New Jail \n1.
