No. 34, and (2) Defendants Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, Doc. No. 36. The parties previously requested an extension of the briefing deadlines and the hearing, which the court granted in part by extending the deadline to file Oppositions to January 3, 2014. Doc. No. 41. Despite this extension, Defendants failed to file an Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment, and the court therefore deemed the briefing closed on these Motions. See Doc. No. 46. Defendants have now filed a Motion for Reconsideration, seeking leave to file an Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment. Defendants assert that this action was close to settlement, and Defendants' lead counsel is off island from January 4-17, 2014, he was very busy with other actions prior to his departure, and he did not see the court's Order regarding the briefing deadlines. The court DENIES the Motion for Reconsideration. Defendants apparently assumed that the court would grant their request for extension, and such assumption was at their own peril. Further, it is Defendants' own fault that counsel does \"not recall\" seeing the court's order granting only a limited extension. Indeed, counsel's complaint that \"I currently handle several federal cases and frequently receive up to 50 emails per day\" is no excuse for allowing the opposition deadline to pass. The Motion for Reconsideration does, however, suggest that the parties were close to settlement. If all parties concur that meeting with Judge Seabright would be helpful in reaching settlement before both the parties and this court spends additional resources on this action, they may contact the court's acting courtroom manager, Theresa Lam, at 808-541-3577, to schedule a settlement conference.

    "summary": "<p>On August 12, 2012, the Hawaii Defense Foundation and two of its members filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii. The plaintiffs sued the City and County of Honolulu, an employee of the Honolulu Police Department (HPD), and ten anonymous administrators of the Honolulu Police Department Facebook page under 42 U.S.C ยง1983. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, sought injunctive and declaratory relief, claiming violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendmentโs Due Process Clause. The plaintiffs alleged that the Honolulu Police Department banned members of the public from participating in the public forum of their Facebook page. Specifically, the named plaintiffs in this case had their comments and posts criticizing the HPD deleted from the Official Honolulu Police Department Facebook Page and were subsequently banned from the Facebook page.</p><p>The plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to restore their own posts, allow them to continue posting, and prohibit defendants from banning people or removing political posts. Following several status conferences, defendants agreed to work with the American Civil Liberties Union alongside the plaintiffs to develop a policy governing public posting on the Official Hawaii Police Department Facebook page. The court subsequently deemed the motions for the Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction moot. </p><p>Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on October 23, 2013 after settlement negotiations failed due to disagreements over the forms of dismissal and attorneysโ fees. Defendants filed for Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings on claims against the employee of the Hawaii Police Department. The parties then reached a settlement on all issues except attorneysโ fees on January 16, 2014 and the pending motions were terminated. Although the private settlement is not available, the stipulation for dismissal states that the plaintiffs had their posting privileges restored, and the HPD changed their policies and procedures regarding the administration of their Facebook page.  </p><p>Plaintiffs sought attorneysโ fees of $64,690.29. On April 12, 2014 Magistrate Judge Richard L. Puglisi recommended attorneysโ fees of $22,064.39, believing that the requested hourly rates were not based on Hawaiian market rates, the attorneys billed for excessive time and duplicative work, and that a reduction of 25% was appropriate to offset the attorneysโ practice of billing in half-hour increments. 2014 WL 2804445.</p><p>Plaintiffs filed an objection to the reductions. On June 19, 2014, Judge J. Michael Seabright adopted in part and modified in part the recommended fees. He affirmed that the hourly rate was not in line with Hawaiian market rates, that the billed hours were excessive and duplicative, and that the magistrate judgeโs recommendation was within a reasonable fee range but recommended an upward adjustment on hourly fees to ensure lawyers continue to represent novel civil rights cases. Judge Seabright awarded $31,610.56 in attorneysโ fees. 2014 WL 2804448. The case is now closed. </p><p></p>",

See ECF No. 56.  Plaintiffs request an award of\n$64,690.29 for attorneysโ fees as the โprevailing partyโ pursuant\nto 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988(b).  Defendants City and County of Honolulu\n(the โCityโ) and Andrew Lum (collectively โDefendantsโ) filed\ntheir memorandum in opposition to Plaintiffsโ Motion on February\n1  Within fourteen (14) days after a party is served with a\ncopy of the Findings and Recommendation, that party may, pursuant\nto 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1)(B), file written objections in the\nUnited States District Court.  A party must file any objections\nwithin the fourteen-day period allowed if that party wants to\nhave appellate review of the Findings and Recommendation.  If no\nobjections are filed, no appellate review will be allowed.\n\n18, 2014, and Plaintiffs filed their reply on February 25, 2014. \nSee ECF Nos. 62, 63.\nThe Court finds this matter suitable for disposition\nwithout a hearing pursuant to LR 54.3(f) of the Local Rules of\nPractice for the United States District Court for the District of\nHawaii.  Based on the following, and after careful consideration\nof the Motion, the supporting and opposing memoranda,\ndeclarations, and exhibits attached thereto, and the record\nestablished in this action, the Court FINDS AND RECOMMENDS that\nPlaintiffsโ Motion be GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.  The\nCourt RECOMMENDS that the District Judge AWARD Plaintiffs\n$22,064.39 in attorneysโ fees.\nBACKGROUND\nThis action arises from the Honolulu Police\nDepartmentโs (โHPDโ) policies and practices regarding its\nโofficialโ social media page at the website Facebook.com. \nPlaintiffs contend that, although HPDโs Facebook page was created\nto be โa forum open to the public,โ their comments and posts were\nremoved in violation of their free speech rights.  Plaintiffs\nclaim that their posts were targeted because they were critical\nof HPD and/or did not express a viewpoint aligned with the\ndepartment.  Plaintiffs also allege that, for a period of time,\nthey were banned from posting to HPDโs Facebook page.  Plaintiffs\nallegedly received no explanation for this ban or for the removal\n2\n\nof their posts and state that no notice or opportunity to be\nheard was provided to them.  \nOn August 21, 2012, Plaintiffs filed their Complaint,\nalleging violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.  See ECF No. 1.  That same day,\nPlaintiffs also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order\n(โTROโ), as well as a motion for preliminary injunction, which\nsought an order compelling Defendants to restore Plaintiffsโ\ndeleted posts, permitting Plaintiffs to participate in HPDโs\nFacebook page, and prohibiting Defendants from banning persons or\nremoving posts based on political content.  See ECF Nos. 6, 7. \nOn August 22, August 24, and September 5, 2012, the Court held\nstatus conferences with the parties, which resulted in\nDefendantsโ decision to not remove any posts until a policy\ngoverning the removal of speech from HPDโs Facebook page could be\nnegotiated between Defendants and the American Civil Liberties\nUnion (โACLUโ), Plaintiffsโ designated proxy.  See ECF Nos. 10,\n16, 17.  In light of Defendantsโ new position, the Court deemed\nPlaintiffsโ TRO and preliminary injunction motions moot.  See id. \nOn October 9, 2012, the Court held another status\nconference with the parties.  See ECF No. 21.  The parties were\ninstructed to notify the Court regarding the status of their\nsettlement negotiations, and, if settlement had been reached on\nall issued except attorneysโ fees, Plaintiffs were permitted to\nfile the appropriate motion.  See id.  After a lengthy\n3\n\nnegotiation, the parties reached a mutually agreeable policy\nregarding HPDโs Facebook page in January 2013.  See Pls.โ Mot.\nEx. 1.  Although an agreement in principle had been reached, the\npartiesโ settlement negotiations stalled with respect to the form\nof the dismissal documents and Defendantsโ payment of Plaintiffsโ\ncosts.  See Pls.โ Mem. Supp. Mot. 5-7; Defs.โ Mem. Opp. Mot. 4-5.\nOn January 21, 2014, the Court approved the partiesโ\nStipulation for Dismissal With Prejudice (โStipulationโ).  See\nECF No. 55.  The Stipulation stated that โthe policies developed\nas a result of extended negotiations between the Plaintiffs and\nDefendants are still in place.โ  Id. at 2.  All claims were\ndismissed with prejudice, but โthe parties acknowledge that\nPlaintiffs may bring a subsequent motion . . . seeking attorneysโ\nfeesโ and Defendants โmay contest Plaintiffsโ entitlement to an\naward of attorneysโ fees and the amount of fees sought.โ  Id. at\n3.  The instant Motion followed.  \nANALYSIS\nA. Entitlement to Attorneysโ Fees and Costs \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1988(b) permits the Court to award\nreasonable attorneysโ fees to the โprevailing partyโ in certain\ncivil rights actions, including those brought under 42 U.S.C. ยง\n1983.  See 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988(b).  A plaintiff โprevailsโ for the\npurposes of ยง 1988 โwhen actual relief on the merits of his claim\nmaterially alters the legal relationship between the parties by\nmodifying the defendantโs behavior in a way that directly\n4\n\nbenefits the plaintiff.โ  Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 111-12\n(1992).  Relief โon the meritsโ occurs when the material\nalteration of the partiesโ legal relationship is accompanied by\nโjudicial imprimatur on the change.โ  Buckhannon Bd. & Care Home,\nInc. v. W. Va. Depโt of Health & Human Res., 532 U.S. 598, 605\n(2001).  Judicial imprimatur can come in the form of an\nenforceable judgment on the merits or a court-ordered consent\ndecree, such as in Buckhannon, but โ[o]ther court-approved\nactions will suffice, provided they entail a judicial\ndetermination that the claims on which the plaintiff obtains\nrelief are potentially meritorious.โ  Higher Taste, Inc. v. City\nof Tacoma, 717 F.3d 712, 715 (9th Cir. 2013).  \nHere, Defendants do not dispute that Plaintiffs are\nentitled to an award of reasonable attorneysโ fees.  First,\nPlaintiffs obtained actual relief on the merits of their claims. \nA material alteration of the partiesโ legal relationship occurs\nwhen โthe plaintiff can force the defendant to do something that\nhe otherwise would not have to do.โ  Higher Taste, 717 F.3d at\n716 (quoting Fischer v. SJB-P.D. Inc., 214 F.3d 1115, 1118 (9th\nCir. 2000)).  In this case, Plaintiffsโ Complaint and the\nsubsequent status conferences with the Court resulted in\nDefendantsโ consenting to a temporary moratorium on removal of\nposts from HPDโs Facebook page and ultimately adopting a mutually\nagreeable policy for removal of speech on the page.  This policy,\nwhich is still in place, directly benefitted Plaintiffs and was a\n5\n\nsufficiently enduring change in the partiesโ legal relationship. \nSee id. at 717.  \nSecond, the record shows that the parties agreed that\nthe Court would retain jurisdiction to decide the issue of\nPlaintiffsโ attorneysโ fees.  See Stipulation, ECF No. 55, at 3. \nA legally enforceable settlement agreement that provides that the\ncourt retains jurisdiction over the issue of attorneysโ fees is\nsufficient to convey โjudicial imprimaturโ over the settlement. \nSee Richard S. v. Depโt of Developmental Servs. of Cal., 317 F.3d\n1080, 1087 (9th Cir. 2003) (โ[t]hrough [the partiesโ] legally\nenforceable settlement agreement and the district courtโs\nretention of jurisdiction [to resolve the issue of fees and\ncosts], plaintiffs obtained a judicial imprimatur that alters the\nlegal relationship of the partiesโ) (internal quotation marks\nomitted); Barrios v. Cal. Interscholastic Fedโn, 277 F.3d 1128,\n1134 n.5 (9th Cir. 2002) (finding that โthe parties, in their\nsettlement, agreed that the district court would retain\njurisdiction over the issue of attorneysโ fees, thus providing\nsufficient judicial oversight to justify an award of attorneysโ\nfees and costsโ); Justin R. ex rel. Jennifer R. v. Matayoshi, No.\n12-16048, 2014 WL 905817, at *1 (9th Cir. Mar. 10, 2014) (finding\nthat settlement agreement stating that the district court shall\nretain jurisdiction to determine that issue of Plaintiffsโ\nentitlement to reasonable attorneysโ fees and costs provided\n6\n\nsufficient judicial imprimatur).2  C.f. P.N. v. Seattle Sch.\nDist. No. 1, 474 F.3d 1165, 1173 (9th Cir. 2007) (finding that\nthere was no โjudicial imprimaturโ of the settlement agreement at\nissue where the agreement did not contemplate any judicial\nenforcement and the matter of attorneysโ fees and costs โwas not\nreferred to any court.โ).  Accordingly, based on the partiesโ\nsettlement and agreement that this Court retain jurisdiction to\ndecide the issue of fees, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs are\nthe prevailing party and are entitled to an award of reasonable\nattorneysโ fees  pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988(b).  \nB. Calculation of Attorneysโ Fees \nIn calculating an award of reasonable attorneysโ fees,\ndistrict courts use the lodestar calculation set forth in Hensley\nv. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983).  A court must determine a\nreasonable fee by multiplying โthe number of hours reasonably\nexpended on the litigationโ by โa reasonable hourly rate.โ \nHensley, 461 U.S. at 433.  \nOnce calculated, the lodestar amount is presumptively\nreasonable.  See Pennsylvania v. Del. Valley Citizensโ Council\nfor Clean Air, 483 U.S. 711, 728 (1987); Fischer v. SJB-P.D.\nInc., 214 F.3d 1115, 1119 n.4 (9th Cir. 2000) (stating that โa\nโstrong presumptionโ exists that the lodestar figure represents a\n2  The Court cites Justin R. for its persuasive, not\nprecedential, value pursuant to Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.  \n7\n\nโreasonable feeโโ).  However, in โrare and exceptional\ncircumstances,โ a court may decide to adjust the lodestar figure\nbased on an evaluation of the factors articulated in Kerr v.\nScreen Extras Guild, Inc., 526 F.2d 67, 70 (9th Cir. 1975), which\nhave not been subsumed in the lodestar calculation.3  See\nFischer, 214 F.3d at 1119 n.4.  The factors the Ninth Circuit\nidentified in Kerr are: \n(1)  the  time  and  labor  required,  (2)  the\nnovelty  and  difficulty  of  the  questions\ninvolved, (3) the skill requisite to perform\nthe legal service properly, (4) the preclusion\nof  other  employment  by  the  attorney  due\nacceptance of the case, (5) the customary fee,\n(6) whether the fee is fixed or contingent,\n(7) time limitations imposed by the client or\nthe circumstances, (8) the amount involved and\nthe  results  obtained,  (9)  the  experience,\nreputation, and ability of the attorneys, (10)\nthe  โundesirabilityโ  of  the  case,  (11)  the\nnature  and  length  of  the  professional\nrelationship with the client, and (12) awards\nin similar cases. \n3  The following factors are subsumed within the lodestar\ndetermination: โ(1) the novelty and complexity of the issues, (2)\nthe special skill and experience of counsel, (3) the quality of\nrepresentation, . . . (4) the results obtained, and (5) the\ncontingent nature of the fee agreement.โ  Morales v. City of San\nRafael, 96 F.3d 359, 364 n.9 (9th Cir. 1996) (stating that\nโ[a]djusting the lodestar on the basis of subsumed reasonableness\nfactors after the lodestar has been calculated, instead of\nadjusting the reasonable hours or reasonable hourly rate at the\nfirst step . . . is a disfavored procedureโ) (citations and\nquotations omitted).  The Ninth Circuit, however, extending City\nof Burlington v. Dague, 505 U.S. 557, 567 (1992), has held that\nwhether the fee is fixed or contingent may not be considered in\nthe lodestar calculation.  See Davis v. City & Cnty. of S.F., 967\nF.2d 1536, 1549 (9th Cir. 1992), vacated in part on other\ngrounds, 984 F.2d 345 (9th Cir. 1993).  \n8\n\nKerr, 526 F.2d at 70. \nPlaintiffs request the following lodestar amount for\nwork performed by its counsel in this case: \nATTORNEY HOURS RATE TOTAL\nRichard Holcomb 75.10 $355.00 $26,660.50\nBrian Brazier 45.75 $325.00 $14,868.75\nAlan Beck 81.00 $250.00 $20,250.00\nSUBTOTAL 201.85 $61,779.25\nOahu GET of 4.712% $2,911.04\nTOTAL $64,690.29\nSee Pls.โ Mot. ยถ 7.  \n1. Reasonable Hourly Rate\nThe โprevailing market rates in the relevant communityโ\nset the reasonable hourly rate for lodestar purposes under ยง\n1988.  Gonzalez v. City of Maywood, 729 F.3d 1196, 1205 (9th Cir.\n2013).  โGenerally, when determining a reasonable hourly rate,\nthe relevant community is the forum in which the district court\nsits.โ  Prison Legal News v. Schwarzenegger, 608 F.3d 446, 454\n(9th Cir. 2010) (quoting Camacho v. Bridgeport Fin., Inc., 523\nF.3d 973, 979 (9th Cir. 2008)).  Within this geographic\ncommunity, โthe district court should be guided by the rate\nprevailing in the community for similar work performed by\nattorneys of comparable skill, experience, and reputation.โ  Webb\nv. Ada County, 285 F.3d 829, 840 (9th Cir. 2002) (citing Chalmers\nv. City of L.A., 796 F.2d 1205, 1210-11 (9th Cir. 1986)); see\n9\n\nalso Gates v. Deukmejian, 987 F.2d 1392, 1405 (9th Cir. 1992)\n(noting that the rate awarded should reflect โthe rates of\nattorneys practicing in the forum districtโ).  In addition to\ntheir own statements, attorneys are required to submit additional\nevidence that the rate charged is reasonable.  Jordan v.\nMultnomah Cnty., 815 F.2d 1258, 1263 (9th Cir. 1987).  \nRather than applying Hawaii rates, Plaintiffs claim\nthat the so-called โLaffey Matrix,โ see Pls.โ Mot. Ex. 4, should\nbe used to establish the appropriate hourly rates for their\nattorneys.  โApproved originally in Laffey v. Nw. Airlines, Inc.,\n573 F. Supp. 354 (D.D.C. 1983), affโd in part, revโd in part on\nother grounds, 746 F.2d 4 (D.C. Cir. 1984), the Laffey matrix is\nan inflation-adjusted grid of hourly rates for lawyers of varying\nlevels of experience in Washington, D.C.โ  Prison Legal News, 608\nF.3d at 454.  The Ninth Circuit has questioned whether the Laffey\nMatrix is a reliable measure of rates for attorneys practicing\noutside the Washington, D.C. area.  See id. (โBut just because\nthe Laffey matrix has been accepted in the District of Columbia\ndoes not mean that it is a sound basis for determining rates\nelsewhere, let alone in a legal market 3,000 miles away.โ).  In\nthis case, although two of Plaintiffs three attorneys are located\nin Honolulu, Hawaii, and the other is in San Diego, California,\nPlaintiffs assert that Laffey matrix rates should be applied for\nall counsel.  In support, Plaintiffs rely on their counselโs\n10\n\nindependent โsurveyโ of this Courtโs attorney fee awards, the\nโprevailing cost of livingโ in Hawaii, and the novelty of this\nlitigation.  See Holcomb Decl. ยถ 18.  \nThe Court finds that the Laffey matrix should not be\napplied and that Plaintiffsโ counsel should be awarded prevailing\nlocal rates.  First, this Court is well aware of this districtโs\nprevious attorney fee awards, as well as the prevailing rates in\nthe community for similar services performed by attorneys of\ncomparable experience, skill, and reputation.  Plaintiffsโ\ncounselโs โsurvey,โ which essentially consists of a 10-page-long\nstring cite of this districtโs fee awards, only confirms that (1)\nthis Court has consistently applied the correct standard of\nawarding attorneysโ fees at the prevailing market rates in this\ndistrict and (2) this Court has never recognized hourly rates as\nhigh as those requested by Plaintiffsโ counsel for attorneys with\ncomparable experience, skill, and reputation.  \nIndeed, although Plaintiffs insinuate that this Court\nimproperly relied upon its own knowledge of prevailing Hawaii\nrates in its prior decisions, see Pls.โ Mem. Supp. Mot. 15, the\nNinth Circuit has held that judges are justified in relying on\ntheir own knowledge of customary rates and their own experience\nconcerning reasonable attorneysโ fees.  See Ingram v. Oroudjian,\n647 F.3d 925, 928 (9th Cir. 2011).  Moreover, unlike in Moreno v.\nCity of Sacramento, 534 F.3d 1106, 1115 (9th Cir. 2008), where\n11\n\nthe district court had applied a de facto policy of awarding a\nrate of $250 per hour to civil rights cases for the previous ten\nyears, it is evident that this Court makes an individualized\ndetermination, for each fee request, of the reasonable rate that\nshould be awarded to each particular attorney given his or her\nexperience and the circumstances of the specific case.  See Sam\nK. ex rel. Diane C. v. Depโt of Educ., Haw., Civ. No. 12-00355\nACK-BMK, 2013 WL 3071317, at *3 (D. Haw. June 17, 2013)\n(magistrate judge did not โhold the lineโ at a certain level of\nfees where judge based his conclusion on recent fee awards to\nattorneys involved in similar lawsuits, skill of counsel, and\nresult obtained). \nSecond, Plaintiffsโ reliance on Hawaiiโs high cost of\nliving as a factor in measuring hourly rates is misplaced. \nAccording to the Ninth Circuit, โThe best way [to strike a\nbalance between granting sufficient fees to attract qualified\ncounsel to civil rights cases and avoiding a windfall to counsel]\nis to compensate counsel at the prevailing rate in the community\nfor similar work; no more, no less.โ  Moreno, 534 F.3d at 1111\n(citations omitted, emphasis added).  See also Blum v. Stenson,\n465 U.S. 886, 895 (1984) (โreasonable feesโ are โto be calculated\naccording to the prevailing market rates in the relevant\ncommunityโ) (emphasis added). \n12\n\nDespite its high cost of living, it is a well-known\nfact that Hawaiiโs market simply does not permit Honolulu-based\nattorneys to charge nearly as much as their mainland\ncounterparts.  According to Gary Slovin, who at the time was the\nmanaging partner at one of Honoluluโs largest law firms, Goodsill\nAnderson Quinn & Stifel, \nThe billable hour rates in the major Mainland\ncities have been dramatically higher than the\nbillable  rates  that  are  charged  by  Hawaii\nattorneys.    Itโs  just  the  function  of  a\nsmaller  marketplace.    Compensation  for\nattorneys is tied to what clients are charged\nand  Hawaiiโs  business  market  just  doesnโt\nsustain those kinds of rates. \nLinda Chiem, Mainland-Hawaii Salary Gap Grows, Pacific Business\nNews (Sept. 20, 2009),\nhttp://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/stories/2009/09/21/story1.html\n?page=all.  As a result, law partners on the mainland charge\nbetween $300 and $1,000 an hour, while most of the bigger firms\nin Hawaii charge closer to $250.  Id.  This has been accepted as\nthe โprice of paradise.โ  Id.  \nFor this reason, where local counsel is available, this\nCourt has repeatedly rejected requests that attorneys be awarded\nmainland rates.  See, e.g., Frankl v. HGH Corp., Civ. No. 10-\n00014 JMS-RLP, 2012 WL 1755423, at *6 (D. Haw. Apr. 23, 2012)\n(refusing to apply Laffey Matrix to determine rates of out-of-\ndistrict attorneys); Harris v. Trash Man, LLC, 12-00169 HG-KSC,\n2013 WL 1932715, at *2 (D. Haw. Apr. 16, 2013) (declining to\n13\n\naward mainland rates to government attorneys based in California\neven where no staff attorney was located in Hawaii); BMW of N.\nAm., LLC v. Mini Coupe Haw., LLC, 2013 WL 1568546, at *1-2 (D.\nHaw. Mar. 21, 2013) (denying mainland counselโs request to be\nawarded mainland hourly rates where case did not require\nspecialized knowledge of mainland attorneys); HRPT Props. Trust\nv. Lingle, 775 F. Supp. 2d 1225, 1239 (D. Haw. 2011) (reducing\nhourly rates requested by mainland counsel to match local rates).\nFinally, the novelty of this case does not justify\nLaffey matrix rates.  Novelty does not equal difficulty or\ncomplexity.  This case was not complex and did not require\nspecialized knowledge or skill.  It was not particularly\ncontentious.  Instead, this was a relatively simple matter of\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief where Plaintiffsโ TRO and\npreliminary injunction motions were deemed moot within two weeks\nof the Complaint being filed and a settlement as to the merits of\nthe claim was reached within six months.  Plaintiffsโ comparison\nto rates the City might pay its attorneys for work related to a\n$5.2 billion rail transit project, which has already faced\nmultiple federal and state legal challenges, see Pls.โ Mot. Ex.\n3, is completely inapt.  \nTherefore, based on this Courtโs knowledge of the\ncommunityโs prevailing rates, the hourly rates generally granted\nby the Court, the Courtโs familiarity with this case, and\n14\n\nPlaintiffsโ counselโs submissions, this Court finds that the\nrequested hourly rates are excessive.  The proper measure of\nreasonableness is whether the requested hourly rate is consistent\nwith those in this district.  There is no basis for deviating\nfrom this rule here.  This case was not complex and did not\nrequire the involvement of a mainland attorney.  It is only in\ncases requiring the specialized knowledge of a mainland attorney\nor law firm that this Court might consider awarding an hourly\nrate commensurate with the rates in the mainland attorneyโs\ndistrict or community.  Plaintiffs are certainly entitled to\ncounsel of their choice, and have the right to retain mainland\ncounsel.  However, in this case, they are not entitled to\nreimbursement at Washington, D.C. rates.  See BMW of N. Am., 2013\nWL 1568546, at *1. \nNevertheless, the Court will award Plaintiffsโ counsel\ntheir current market rates.  Here, Defendants contend that\nPlaintiffsโ counsel should be compensated based on their legal\nexperience when they began working on this case in 2012. \nDistrict courts have discretion to apply the rates in effect at\nthe time the work was performed, but may also award rates at\ncurrent rates where appropriate to compensate for counselโs delay\nin receiving payment.  Bell v. Clackamas Cnty., 341 F.3d 858, 868\n(9th Cir. 2003) (quoting Missouri v. Jenkins by Agyei, 491 U.S.\n274, 284 (1989)).  The Court finds that current market rates are\n15\n\nappropriate to compensate for the two-year delay here.  In\naddition, the Court declines to strike Plaintiffsโ memorandum in\nsupport of their Motion for violating the page-length\nrequirements of Local Rule 7.5.  Instead, the Court will\nattribute this violation as reflecting Plaintiffsโ counselโs lack\nof skill and experience and will factor it into the Courtโs\ndetermination of appropriate hourly rates.  \nIn view of the foregoing, the Court reduces the\nrequested Laffey matrix hourly rates and concludes that the\nfollowing hourly rates are reasonable for Plaintiffsโ counsel:\n(1) Mr. Holcomb (9 years experience) - $185; (2) Mr. Brazier (7.5\nyears experience) - $175; and Mr. Beck (4.5 years experience) -\n$150.  See id. at *2 (awarding attorney with 7.5 years of\nexperience $175 per hour); Seven Signatures Gen. Pโship v.\nIrongate Azrep BW LLC, 871 F. Supp. 2d 1040, 1054 (D. Haw. 2012)\n(awarding attorney with 5 years of experience $150 per hour).  \n2. Hours Reasonably Expended \nBeyond establishing a reasonable hourly rate, the fee\napplicant bears the burden of documenting the appropriate hours\nexpended in the litigation and must submit evidence in support of\nthose hours worked.  Hensley, 461 U.S. at 437; Gates, 987 F.2d at\n1397.  Counsel for a fee applicant should exclude from a request\ntime that is โexcessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary.โ\nId. (quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433-34).  The opposing party\n16\n\nthen has the burden of rebuttal that requires submission of\nevidence challenging the accuracy and reasonableness of the hours\ncharged or the facts asserted by the fee applicant in its\naffidavits.  Id. at 1397-98. \nIn making an award, the court is required to explain\nhow it made its determination in a comprehensible, but not\nelaborate, fashion.  Id.; see also Hensley, 461 U.S. at 437\n(stating that the courtโs explanation may be โconcise,โ but must\nalso be โclearโ).  The court need not set forth an hour-by-hour\nanalysis of the fee request but may instead make across-the-board\npercentage cuts to the number of hours claimed as a โpractical\nmeans of trimming the fatโ from a fee application.  Gates, 987\nF.2d at 1399.  Indeed, the court has the authority to impose โa\nsmall reduction, no greater than ten percent -- a โhaircutโ --\nbased on its exercise of discretion and without a more specific\nexplanation.โ  Moreno, 534 F.3d at 1111.\na. Excessive Hours Billed \nDefendants contend that the number of hours Plaintiffsโ\ncounsel spent working certain tasks were excessive.  In\nparticular, Defendants object to Plaintiffsโ counselโs billings\nfor working on the Complaint (39.5 hours total), motion for\npreliminary injunction (55.5 hours), motion for summary judgment\nand concise statement of facts (24.75 hours), and the instant\nmotion for attorneysโ fees (20.0 hours).  \n17\n\nA district courtโs reasonableness inquiry must be\nlimited to determining whether the fees requested are justified\nfor the particular work performed and the results achieved in the\ncase.  Moreno, 534 F.3d at 1115.  โBy and large, the court should\ndefer to the winning lawyerโs professional judgment as to how\nmuch time he was required to spend on a case; after all, he won,\nand might not have, had he been more of a slacker.โ  Id. at 1112.\nHere, the Court elects to defer to Plaintiffsโ\ncounselโs judgment as to how much time was needed to successfully\nlitigate this case, with the exception of the time entries\nregarding the Complaint and motion for summary judgment and\nconcise statement of facts.  The Complaint asserted two causes of\naction for First and Fourteenth Amendment violations and was 14\npages long.  It should not have taken 39.5 hours to complete. \nTherefore, the Court will deduct 19.5 hours from Mr. Beckโs time\nfor work spent on the Complaint.  Furthermore, at the time the\nmotion for summary judgment was filed, on October 23, 2013,\nsee ECF Nos. 35, 36, the parties had already reached an agreement\nin principle to settle the merits of the case regarding HPDโs\nFacebook policy, so the motion could have been avoided. \nMoreover, large portions of the motion for summary judgment were\ntaken verbatim from the motion for preliminary injunction. \nAccordingly, the Court will deduct 7.0 hours from Mr. Brazierโs\ntime and 6.0 hours from Mr. Beckโs time for work spent on the\n18\n\nmotion for summary judgment and concise statement of facts as\nexcessive.  \nb. Clerical Work \nClerical or ministerial tasks are not compensable\nbecause such tasks are part of an attorneyโs overhead and are\nreflected in the charged hourly rate.  HRPT Props., 775 F. Supp.\n2d at 1241.  Examples of clerical work include: filing court\ndocuments or confirming that court documents have been filed;\norganizing and maintaining files and binders for intra-office\nuse; delivering or transmitting documents; preparing memoranda\nfor office files; bates stamping or other labeling of documents;\norganizing documents for production; coordinating service of\ndocuments; and formatting or printing documents; reviewing court-\ngenerated notices; notifying clients of court hearings;\ncommunications with court staff; scheduling; and corresponding\nregarding deadlines.  See id.; Ko Olina Dev., LLC v. Centex\nHomes, Civ. No. 09-00272 DAE-LEK, 2011 WL 1235548, at *12 (D.\nHaw. Mar. 29, 2011).  \nDefendants assert that several of Plaintiffsโ counselโs\ntime entries are for clerical work.  After review of these\nentries, however, the Court finds that only two entries, for\ncoordinating status conferences, are actually clerical in nature. \nTherefore, the Court will deduct 0.5 hours from Mr. Holcombโs\n19\n\ntime and 0.5 hours from Mr. Beckโs time as non-compensable\nclerical work.\nc. Duplicative Time\nThe Court does not permit more than one attorney to\nbill for attending: (1) a meeting between co-counsel; (2) a\nclient meeting; or (3) a meeting with opposing counsel.  Seven\nSignatures, 871 F. Supp. 2d at 1055.  See also HRPT Props., 775\nF. Supp. 2d at 1240 (โduplicative time spent by multiple\nattorneys is non-compensableโ).  In such a situation, the time\nspent by the lowest-billing attorney(s) is deducted.  Id.  As a\ngeneral rule, the Court allows two attorneys to bill for their\nappearances at court proceedings when it is reasonable and\nnecessary for a โsecond chairโ to appear with lead counsel. \nSheehan v. Centex Homes, 853 F. Supp. 2d 1031, 1044 (D. Haw.\n2011).  After review of Plaintiffsโ counselโs timesheets and\nDefendantsโ objections thereto, the Court finds that 2.5 hours\nfrom Mr. Brazierโs time and 2.0 hours from Mr. Beckโs time should\nbe deducted as duplicative.\nd. Block Billing\nโDistrict courts have the authority to reduce hours\nthat are billed in block format because such a billing style\nmakes it difficult for courts to ascertain how much time counsel\nspent on specified tasks.โ  HRPT Props., 775 F. Supp. 2d at 1240\n(citing Welch v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 480 F.3d 942, 948 (9th\n20\n\nCir. 2007)).  See also Hensley, 461 U.S. at 437 (holding that fee\napplicant should โmaintain billing time records in a manner that\nwill enable a reviewing court to identify distinct claimsโ); LR\n54.3(d) (requiring a โdescription of the work performed by each\nattorney and paralegal broken down by hours or fractions thereof\nexpended on each taskโ).  Here, Plaintiffsโ counselโs time logs\ncontain some instances of block billing, but the majority of\nentries are for discrete tasks.  Viewing Plaintiffsโ counselโs\nrequest as a whole, the limited instances of block billing do not\nprevent the Court from evaluating the reasonableness of the hours\nexpended.  See Ko Olina, 2011 WL 1235548, at *11.  The Court\ntherefore declines to apply a specific reduction for block\nbilling. \ne. Inadequate Description of Time\nLocal Rule 54.3(d)(2) requires that the party seeking\nan award of fees โdescribe adequately the services rendered, so\nthat the reasonableness of the requested fees can be evaluated,โ\nand provides that โ[i]f the time descriptions are incomplete, or\nsuch descriptions fail to describe adequately the services\nrendered, the court may reduce the award accordingly.โ  LR\n54.3(d)(2).  In this case, Plaintiffsโ counselโs time logs\ncontain some entries in which descriptions of services are\nincomplete, e.g., entries that fail to identify the reason for a\ntelephone conference or client meeting.  However, the Court was\n21\n\nable to evaluate the reasonableness of the requested fees from\ncontext clues within the time entries immediately before and\nafter the questionable entries.  Thus, the Court declines to\nreduce Plaintiffsโ counselโs time for inadequate descriptions of\nthe services rendered.  \nf. Quarter-Hour Increments\nFinally, the Court has concerns about Plaintiffsโ\ncounselโs practice of billing in primarily half-hour increments. \nThis Court routinely reduces hours when attorneys bill in\nquarter-hour increments because the tasks reflected in the time\nentries likely took a fraction of the time billed and the\npractice of billing in such large fractional increments typically\nresults in requests for excessive hours.  See, e.g., Robinson v.\nPlourde, 717 F. Supp. 2d 1092, 1100-01 (D. Haw. 2010) (20%\nreduction for quarter-hour billing); World Triathlon Corp. v.\nDunbar, 539 F. Supp. 2d 1270, 1286 (D. Haw. 2008) (10% reduction\nfor quarter-hour billing).  See also Welch, 480 F.3d at 949\n(affirming district courtโs 20% across-the-board reduction for\nquarter-hour billing).\nHere, out of dozens of time entries, Plaintiffsโ\ncounsel billed only once in a tenth-hour increment and only seven\ntimes in quarter-hour increments.  The vast majority of time\nentries are for half-hour and full-hour increments, and in many\ninstances, purport to be for six or more hours of work in a\n22\n\nsingle entry.  In one glaring example, Mr. Holcomb billed a\nsingle entry for work on the instant Motion which supposedly\nspanned five days and amounted to 16.0 hours.  To offset the\nexcessive hours that resulted from Plaintiffsโ counselโs\nprimarily half-hour billing practice, the Court will impose an\nacross-the-board reduction of 25% on their remaining hours, i.e.,\nthose that were not reduced in accordance with the discussion\nabove.    \n3. Total Lodestar Award\nBased on the foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiff\nhas established the appropriateness of an award of attorneysโ\nfees as follows:\nATTORNEY HOURS RATE TOTAL\nRichard Holcomb 55.954 $185.00 $10,350.75\nBrian Brazier 27.195 $175.00 $4,758.25\nAlan Beck 39.756 $150.00 $5,962.50\nSUBTOTAL 122.89 $21,071.50\nOahu GET of 4.712% $992.89\n4  75.10 hours - 0.5 clerical hours = 74.60 hours x 25%\nquarter-hour billing reduction = 55.95 total hours. \n5  45.75 hours - 7.0 excessive hours - 2.5 duplicative hours\n= 36.25 hours x 25% quarter-hour billing reduction = 27.19 total\nhours.  \n6  81.00 hours - 25.5 excessive hours - 0.5 clerical hours -\n2.0 duplicative hours = 53.00 hours x 25% quarter-hour billing\nreduction = 39.75 total hours. \n23\n\nTOTAL $22,064.39\nTherefore, the Court recommends that the District Judge award\nPlaintiff $22,064.39 in attorneysโ fees.  \nCONCLUSION\nIn accordance with the foregoing, the Court FINDS and\nRECOMMENDS that Plaintiffsโ Motion for Attorneysโ Fees, filed on\nFebruary 4, 2014, be GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.  The\nCourt RECOMMENDS that the District Judge AWARD Plaintiff\n$22,064.39 in attorneysโ fees. \nIT IS SO FOUND AND RECOMMENDED.\nDATED: HONOLULU, HAWAII, APRIL 22, 2014.\n_____________________________\nRichard L.

No. 34, and (2) Defendants Motion for Judgment on the\nPleadings, Doc. No. 36. The parties previously requested an extension of the briefing\ndeadlines and the hearing, which the court granted in part by extending the deadline to\nfile Oppositions to January 3, 2014. Doc. No. 41. Despite this extension, Defendants\nfailed to file an Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment, and the court\ntherefore deemed the briefing closed on these Motions. See Doc. No. 46.\nDefendants have now filed a Motion for Reconsideration, seeking leave to file an\nOpposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment. Defendants assert that this\naction was close to settlement, and Defendants' lead counsel is off island from January\n4โ17, 2014, he was very busy with other actions prior to his departure, and he did not\nsee the court's Order regarding the briefing deadlines.\nThe court DENIES the Motion for Reconsideration. Defendants apparently assumed\nthat the court would grant their request for extension, and such assumption was at their\nown peril. Further, it is Defendants' own fault that counsel does \"not recall\" seeing the\ncourt's order granting only a limited extension. Indeed, counsel's complaint that \"I\ncurrently handle several federal cases and frequently receive up to 50 emails per day\"\nis no excuse for allowing the opposition deadline to pass. The Motion for\nReconsideration does, however, suggest that the parties were close to settlement.

The Honolulu Police Department \"HPD\" operates an official social media \npage at the website Facebook.com.  This page clearly purports to be the \"official \nFacebook page of the Honolulu Police Department.\"  Additionally, the fan page \nplainly states that it was created to be \"a forum open to the public.\" \n2.  Despite  affmnatively  opening  this  page  for  discourse  and  commentary, \nPlaintiffs  have  had  their  comments  removed  in  violation  of their  freedoms  of \nspeech.  Moreover, in this specific instance, because Plaintiffs were critical of the \nHPD  in  their  comments  and/or  did  not  express  a  viewpoint  aligned  with  the \ndepartment,  the  HPD  has  banned  Plaintiffs  from  participating  in  the  \"public \nforum.\" \n3.  Plaintiffs have received no explanation for this ban or the censorship of their \ncomments.  No notice or opportunity to be heard was ever provided to Plaintiffs. \n1 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00469-JMS-RLP   Document 1   Filed 08/21/12   Page 3 of 15     PageID #: 3\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n4.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and \n28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331, 1343, 2201, and 2202. \n5.  This  Court has  personal jurisdiction over Defendant City  and  County of \nHonolulu as  it is  a government entity, more specifically a municipal corporation \nincorporated under the laws of the State ofHawai'i, located in Hawai'i. \n6.  This  Court  also  has  personal  jurisdiction  over  each  of the  Defendants \nbecause they, inter alia,  acted under the color of laws, policies,  customs,  and/or \npractices  of the  City  and  County  of Honolulu  and/or  within  the  geographic \nconfmes ofthe State ofHawai'i. \n7.  Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391. \nPARTIES \n8.  Plaintiff Hawaii Defense Foundation is  a 50l.c (3) non-profit membership \norganization incorporated under the  laws  of the  State  of Hawai'i,  and hosts  its \nprincipal place of business in Honolulu, Hawai 'i. \n9.  Hawaii Defense Foundation promotes education and legal action, as well as \nresearch, publishing, and advocacy, in support of civil liberties. \n10.  Plaintiff Christopher Baker is  a natural person and a citizen of the United \nStates, who at all material times herein did reside in Honolulu, Hawai'i. He is a \n2 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00469-JMS-RLP   Document 1   Filed 08/21/12   Page 4 of 15     PageID #: 4\nmember and the President of the Hawaii Defense Foundation.  Mr. Baker continues \nto reside in Honolulu, Hawai'i. \n11.  Plaintiff Derek Scammon is  a natural person and  a citizen of the United \nStates, who at all material times herein did reside in Honolulu, Hawai'i. He is a \nmember and Assistant Director of the Hawaii Defense Foundation. Mr.  Scammon \ncontinues to reside in Honolulu, Hawai'i. \n12.  Defendant Andrew Lum is an employee of the HPD and is responsible for \nmanaging, administering, and maintaining the website.  These duties are believed \nto include the removal of posts and banning of users.  Mr. Lum is sued in both his \npersonal and official capacity. \n13.  Defendants  John  Doe  1-10  are  sued  in  both  their  personal  and  official \ncapacity  as  administrators  of the  HPD's  Facebook  page.  John Doe  1-10  are \nresponsible for executing, maintaining and administering the HPD Facebook page \nand may be participants in the unconstitutional acts and practices discussed within \nthis complaint. \n14.  Defendants  John  Doe  1-10,  because  of their  enforcement  actions,  are \naccordingly liable to Plaintiffs for  damages  and other relief as  set forth  in this \nComplaint. \n15.  Plaintiffs have reviewed all documents available to them and have made a \ndiligent and good faith effort to ascertain said persons' full names and identities; \n3 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00469-JMS-RLP   Document 1   Filed 08/21/12   Page 5 of 15     PageID #: 5\nhowever, Plaintiff has been unable to  ascertain the identities of said Defendants. \nThe names, capacities, and relationships of defendants named as Doe Defendants \nwill be alleged by amendment to this Complaint when they are revealed and thus \nproperly identified. \n16.  Plaintiffs reserve the right to amend this Complaint to add such parties as \nhis true identities and capacities are ascertained through discovery or otherwise. \n17.  Defendant City is a municipal corporation incorporated under the laws of the \nState  of Hawai'i.  The  City  is  authorized  by  law  to  control  and  maintain  the \nHonolulu Police Department, an agency of the city, who acts on the City's behalf \nin the area of law enforcement.  The City is therefore ultimately responsible for \nHPD  and  their  actions,  and  therefore,  must  assume  the  risks  incidental  to  the \nmaintenance of HPD and its employees. \n18.  Employees of the HPD have enforced the policies complained in this action \nagainst Plaintiffs. \nUnlawful Administration of the Official Faceb  ook Page \n19.  Plaintiff Christopher Baker has communicated, on numerous occasions and \nfor the purpose of political commentary and/or public information, on the \"wall\" of \nthe HPD Facebook fan page.  And, without his consent or authorization and with \nno explanation, he has had numerous comments and posts deleted including posts \nMr. Baker submitted on January 18, 25, 26, 27,  and 31  of 2012.  Plaintiffs have \n4 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00469-JMS-RLP   Document 1   Filed 08/21/12   Page 6 of 15     PageID #: 6\nattached printed images of the postings made on the HPD face book page hereto as \nExhibit  One.  Exhibit  One  is  specifically  incorporated  herein  as  is  restated \nverbatim herein. \n20.  Shortly after his posts were deleted, Mr.  Baker discovered he was banned \nfrom participating in the discussion on the Official Honolulu Police Department \nFacebook site. \n21.  Plaintiff Derek Scammon has  communicated,  on numerous  occasions  and \nfor the purpose of political commentary and/or public information, on the \"wall\" of \nthe HPD Facebook fan page.  And, without his consent or authorization and with \nno explanation, he has had numerous comments and posts deleted including posts \nsubmitted  on January  27,  28  and  29  of 2012.  Plaintiffs  have  attached printed \nimages of the postings made on the HPD facebook page hereto as Exhibit Two. \nExhibit Two is specifically incorporated herein as is restated verbatim herein. \n22.  Shortly after his posts were deleted, Mr.  Scammon also discovered he was \nbanned  from  participating  in  the  discussion  on  the  Official  Honolulu  Police \nDepartment Facebook site. \nCounty Policies and Actions have Violated the First and Fourteenth \nAmendment Rights of Hawaii Defense Foundation and its Members. \n23.  Hawaii  Defense  Foundation  is  a  501.c  (3)  non-profit  membership \norganization  that  has  members  and  supporters  throughout  the  United  States, \nincluding  members  and  supporters  who  live  in  both  the  City  and  County  of \n5 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00469-JMS-RLP   Document 1   Filed 08/21/12   Page 7 of 15     PageID #: 7\nHonolulu and  State of Hawai'i,  as  well  as  members  and  supporters  who  travel \nthrough the City and State. \n24.  One of the core purposes of Hawaii Defense Foundation is to vindicate the \nlegal rights of individuals who are unable to act on their own behalf in light of the \ncosts  and time  commitments  involved in litigation.  Hawaii Defense Foundation \nbrings this action on behalf of both itself and its members. \n25.  HDF' s members have therefore had their speech and expressive  conduct \nsuppressed  and  their  civil  rights  infringed.  Defendants  have  deleted  posts  and \nbanned  individual  members,  and  most  notably  three  directors,  of the  Hawaii \nDefense Foundation.  Furthermore, they have also removed and deleted posts that \nwere made by the Foundation on the Police Department's fan page.  Individual \nmembers  and  supporters  of Hawaii  Defense  Foundation  continue  to  face  an \nongoing threat that their posts or commentary will be arbitrarily deleted and/or that \nthey may be banned from the page. \n26.  The  members  and supporters  of Hawaii Defense Foundation also  include \nindividuals who would otherwise post on HPD's Facebook page,  but in fear  of \nHPD' s policy of deleting posts and banning users whose speech they do not like, \nthey refrain from doing so. \n6 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00469-JMS-RLP   Document 1   Filed 08/21/12   Page 8 of 15     PageID #: 8\nThe First Amendment Applies To Online Speech, Including Facebook. \n27.  The First Amendment of the United States protects the \"freedom of speech.\" \nU.S. Const. amend. I. \n28.  Those protections undoubtedly apply to the States.  See Gitlow v. New York, \n268 U.S. 652 (1925). \n29.  Social media, in our current age, is a very common activity that the people \nengage in to communicate with others, share ideas, protest, lobby, and generally \nexpress their views on topics to others.  In fact,  845 million people actively used \nFacebook for purposes such as these in December 2011.1 \n30.  \"Our Constitution is  designed to  maximize individual  freedoms  within a \nframework  of  ordered  liberty.  Statutory  limitations  on  those  freedoms  are \nexamined  for  substantive  authority  and  content  as  well  as  for  definiteness  or \ncertainty of expression.\" Kolender v.  Lawson, 461  U.S.  352, 357 (1983).  Here, \nCity agents  are  acting  arbitrarily with no  statutory limitations,  and minimizing, \nrather  than  maximizing,  individual  freedoms  by  suppressing  one  of the  most \ncommon and modern forms of free speech and, specifically, speech that is critical \nof the government. \n1 \nIn 2011,  Facebook reported  845  million  monthly  active  users  at  the  end  of \nDecember 2011; approximately 165 million of those users live within the United \nStates.  Facebook,  Statistics,  Facebook  (Apr.  2,  2012,  11:32  p.m.), \nhttp://newsroom.fb.com/content/default.aspx?NewsAreald=22. \n7 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00469-JMS-RLP   Document 1   Filed 08/21/12   Page 9 of 15     PageID #: 9\n31.  In some  instances,  government entities  may  determine  the  type  of forum \nthey want to create.  Here, the HPD, using the social media site facebook.com, has \nexpressly created a \"forum open to the public.\"  HPD only prohibited speech that \nwas  obscene,  sexually explicit,  racially  derogatory,  defamatory,  solicits or is  an \nadvertisement, and that suggests or encourages illegal activities.  The HPD rules \ngoverning the facebook posts is attached as Exhibit Three and is incorporated as if \nrestated verbatim herein. \n32.  Thus, the HPD facebook page is an open forum.  In an open public forum, \nrestrictions that apply to certain viewpoints but not others face the highest level of \nscrutiny.  Legal Services Corp.  v.  Velazquez, 531 U.S. 535 (2001).  Alternatively, \neven if HPD didn't intend to create a traditional public forum,  their policies and \nprocedures would still fail under the rules and tests promulgated for non-traditional \npublic forums; the HPD allows some comments, but not others, even when they are \nwithin the scope of the initial topic presented by the agency themselves. \n33.  Although  the  internet  is  not  a  park  in  the  physical  sense,  the  First \nAmendment  has  been  designed  to  protect  more  than  just  newspapers  and \nmagazines.  Moreover,  a  forum  need not be  a physical  place.  Rosenberger v. \nRector and Visitors ofthe University of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819 (1995). \n8 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00469-JMS-RLP   Document 1   Filed 08/21/12   Page 10 of 15     PageID #: 10\n34.  Defendants  Lum and/or  one  or  more  John Does  1-10  violated Plaintiffs' \nFirst Amendment rights  in removing the  facebook posts  and  banning Plaintiffs \nfrom further participation in the forum. \n35.  Defendants Lum and/or one or more John Does  1-10 committed these acts \npursuant to  Defendant City's policy,  practice,  or  customs,  which  constitute the \nstandard operating procedure. \n36.  Alternatively,  Defendant  City's  policy,  practice,  or  customs,  which \nconstitute  the  standard  operating  procedure  caused  the  violative  acts  and/or \nPlaintiffs' damages because Defendant City's practice or custom is to fail, neglect, \nor decline to oversee its employees or offer guidelines or policies to any or all of \nits  employees  in  regards  to  administration,  operation,  or  maintenance  of the \nfacebook. com site - guidelines or policies which could easily be implemented to \nensure that the rights of Plaintiffs or any other citizen would not be violated. \n37.  Alternatively, Defendant Lum and/or one or more ofDefendant(s) John Doe \n1-10 were or are officials with fmal policy-making authority and/or the removal of \nthe  Plaintiffs'  posts  and/or  banning  Plaintiffs  from  participation  in  the  forum \nconstitutes an act of official governmental policy. \n38.  Alternatively, Defendant Lum and/or one or more Defendant(s) John Doe 1-\n10, employed by the HPD and/or the City, have fmal policy-making authority and \nratified a subordinate's unconstitutional decision to remove Plaintiffs' posts and/or \n9 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00469-JMS-RLP   Document 1   Filed 08/21/12   Page 11 of 15     PageID #: 11\nto  ban Plaintiffs  from  further  participation  in the  forum  and the  basis  for  that \ndecision.  The  subordinate is  also named as  one or more of the John Doe  1-1 0 \nDefendants. \nThe United States Constitution Requires Procedural Due Process \n39.  The Fourteenth Amendment provides in pertinent part:  \"No State shall ... \ndeprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law[.]\" U.S. \nConst. amend. XIV, ยง 1. \n40.  Fundamental civil rights  are protected against discretionary treatment.  In \norder to ensure the fair,  equal, and non-discretionary governance of these rights, \ngovernment actions that affect a fundamental right, such as the freedom of speech, \nrequire procedural due process.  Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976). \n41.  Defendant City,  in response to an Information Practices Act request,  have \nadmitted that there are no  governing policies in regard to the administration or \nmanagement  of their  facebook  page.  Instead  posts  are  removed  at  the  sole \ndiscretion  of the  Defendants  or  their  agents.  The  actions  in  this  case  violate \nessentially everything that our civil rights are supposed to be protected from. \n10 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00469-JMS-RLP   Document 1   Filed 08/21/12   Page 12 of 15     PageID #: 12\nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of First and Fourteenth Amendments \n42.  Paragraphs 1 through 35 are incorporated as though fully stated herein. \n43.  Just as the First Amendment has been held to protect television, radio, and \nother developments in technology, online speech, including those comments posted \nand shared through Facebook, must be protected from  Government infringement \nunder the First Amendment. \n44.  Defendant's actions in arbitrarily deleting comments and banning users from \nparticipating on the HPD's official Facebook fan page, which was designed and is \ndesignated  as  an  open public forum,  is  a violation of the First and  Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United States  Constitution and the current cause of action is \nwithin this Court's jurisdiction pursuant to 42 U.S. C. ยง 1983. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nDue Process Violation \n45.  Paragraphs 1 through 35 are incorporated as though fully stated herein. \n46.  Plaintiffs comments were deleted and their participation banned without any \nexplanation. \n47.  Plaintiffs have no means to appeal the deletion and/or ban or seek relief from \na higher authority. \n11 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00469-JMS-RLP   Document 1   Filed 08/21/12   Page 13 of 15     PageID #: 13\n48.  No policies or procedures have been developed or promulgated to help guide \nthe decisions and actions of the HPD's Facebook fan page administrators. \n49.  The actions described herein amount to a clear and present danger to civil \nliberties;  and  importantly,  Defendants  have  failed  to  establish  and  provide  the \nnecessary  safeguards  of due  process  required  when  dealing  with  fundamental \nrights.  The actions complained herein infringe upon the civil rights guaranteed by \nthe First and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and must be \nfound  unconstitutional  and  the  current  cause  of action  is  within  this  Court's \njurisdiction pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.-\nPRAY  ER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for the following relief: \n1.  That a jury be empaneled to decide contested factual issues in this matter. \n2.  Declaratory judgment that Defendant's administration of their Facebook fan \npage and the policies governing its use violate the First Amendment of the United \nStates Constitution. \n3.  Declaratory  judgment  affirming  that  Defendants'  administration  of the \nFacebook  fan  page  and  the  policies,  customs  and/or  practices  governing  this \nadministration  violate  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  of  the  United  States \nConstitution. \n12 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-00469-JMS-RLP   Document 1   Filed 08/21/12   Page 14 of 15     PageID #: 14\n4.

NO. 64\nI.  INTRODUCTION\nCurrently before the court is Plaintiffs Hawaii Defense Foundation,\nChristopher Baker, and Derek Scammonโs (collectively, โPlaintiffsโ) May 5, 2014\nObjections to Magistrate Judge Richard L. Puglisiโs April 22, 2014 Findings and\nRecommendation to Grant in Part and Deny in Part Plaintiffsโ Motion for\nAttorneysโ Fees (โF&Rโ).  The F&R recommends that Plaintiffsโ request for\nattorneysโ fees of $64,690.29 be reduced to $22,064.39.  See Doc. No. 64, F&R at\n2.  Based on the following, the court ADOPTS in part and MODIFIES in part the\nF&R.\n\nCase 1:12-cv-00469-JMS-RLP   Document 71   Filed 06/19/14   Page 2 of 22     PageID #:\n 1742\nII.  BACKGROUND\nOn August 21, 2012, Plaintiffs filed this action against Defendants\nCity and County of Honolulu (the โCityโ) and Andrew Lum (collectively,\nโDefendantsโ) alleging violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments when\nPlaintiffsโ posts to the Honolulu Police Departmentโs social media page on\nFacebook.com were removed and Plaintiffs were blocked from making further\nposts.  Doc. No. 1, Compl. at 1, 11-13.  That same day, Plaintiffs also filed a\nMotion for Temporary Restraining Order and a Motion for Preliminary Injunction,\nwhich sought to restore Plaintiffsโ deleted posts, permit Plaintiffs to post to the\nHPDโs page, and prohibit Defendants from banning people or removing posts\nbased on political content.  Doc. Nos. 6 & 7.   \nFollowing several status conferences, Defendants agreed to develop a\npolicy, through negotiations with Plaintiffsโ proxy, the American Civil Liberties\nUnion, governing public posting on HPDโs Facebook page.  See Doc. Nos. 10, 16,\n17, Minutes.  Accordingly, the court deemed the Motions for Temporary\nRestraining Order and Preliminary Injunction moot.  See Doc. Nos. 10, 17,\nMinutes.  Thereafter, the parties engaged in settlement negotiations, reaching an\nagreement in principle by January 2013, but failing to resolve the form of dismissal\ndocuments and issues regarding payment of Plaintiffsโ attorneysโ fees and costs. \n2\n\nCase 1:12-cv-00469-JMS-RLP   Document 71   Filed 06/19/14   Page 3 of 22     PageID #:\n 1743\nOn October 23, 2013, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, Doc. No.\n34, and Defendants filed a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings as to claims\nagainst Defendant Andrew Lum.  Doc. No. 36.  On January 16, 2014, the parties\nreached a settlement on all issues except payment of Plaintiffsโ attorneysโ fees, see\nDoc. No. 52, Minutes, and the pending motions were terminated.  See Doc. No. 53,\nEntering Order.  \nOn January 21, 2014, the parties filed a Stipulation dismissing all\nclaims, but acknowledging Plaintiffsโ right to file a subsequent motion for\nattorneysโ fees.  Doc. No. 55.  The underlying Motion for Attorneysโ Fees\nfollowed, in which Plaintiffs sought an award of $64,690.29.  Doc. No. 56.  After\nthe F&R recommended that Plaintiffs be awarded attorneysโ fees of $22,064.39,\nDoc. No. 64, Plaintiffs filed their Objections on May 5, 2014, Doc. No. 65, and an\nErrata on May 6, 2014.  Doc. No. 66.  Defendants filed a Response on May 21,\n2014, Doc. No. 69, and Plaintiffs filed a Reply on May 27, 2014.  Doc. No. 70. \nPursuant to Local Rule 7.2(d), the court finds this matter suitable for disposition\nwithout a hearing.\nIII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\nWhen a party objects to a magistrate judgeโs findings or\nrecommendations, the district court must review de novo those portions to which\n3\n\nCase 1:12-cv-00469-JMS-RLP   Document 71   Filed 06/19/14   Page 4 of 22     PageID #:\n 1744\nthe objections are made and โmay accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the\nfindings or recommendations made by the magistrate judge.โ  28 U.S.C.\nยง 636(b)(1); see also United States v. Raddatz, 447 U.S. 667, 673 (1980); United\nStates v. Reyna-Tapia, 328 F.3d 1114, 1121 (9th Cir. 2003) (en banc) (โ[T]he\ndistrict judge must review the magistrate judgeโs findings and recommendations de\nnovo if objection is made, but not otherwise.โ).  \nUnder a de novo standard, this court reviews โthe matter anew, the\nsame as if it had not been heard before, and as if no decision previously had been\nrendered.โ  Freeman v. DirecTV, Inc., 457 F.3d 1001, 1004 (9th Cir. 2006); United\nStates v. Silverman, 861 F.2d 571, 576 (9th Cir. 1988).  The district court need not\nhold a de novo hearing; however, it is the courtโs obligation to arrive at its own\nindependent conclusion about those portions of the magistrate judgeโs findings or\nrecommendation to which a party objects.  United States v. Remsing, 874 F.2d 614,\n618 (9th Cir. 1989). \nIV.  DISCUSSION\nIn recommending that Plaintiffsโ request for $64,690.29 in attorneysโ\nfees be reduced to $22,064.39, the F&R determined, among other things, that \n(1) counselsโ hourly rates were not based on the applicable Hawaii market rates;\n(2) time spent on certain tasks was excessive; (3) time spent on tasks by multiple\n4\n\nCase 1:12-cv-00469-JMS-RLP   Document 71   Filed 06/19/14   Page 5 of 22     PageID #:\n 1745\nattorneys was duplicative; and (4) an across-the-board reduction of 25% on the\nremaining hours was necessary to offset counselsโ billing in primarily half-hour\nincrements.  Doc. No. 64, F&R at 9.  Plaintiffs object to these reductions,1 and the\ncourt addresses each objection in turn.\nA. Hourly Rate\nPlaintiffs object to the F&Rโs determination that counselsโ requested\nhourly rates were well out of line with the prevailing rates in Hawaii and should be\nreduced from (1) $355.00 to $185.00 for Mr. Richard Holcomb; (2) $325.00 to\n$175.00 for Mr. Brian Brazier; and (3) $250.00 to $150.00 for Mr. Alan Beck.  See\nDoc. No. 64, F&R at 9, 16.  Based on a de novo review, the court agrees with the\nF&R that the requested rates do not reflect the prevailing rates in this district. \nA reasonable hourly rate should reflect the โprevailing market rates in\nthe relevant community,โ Gonzalez v. City of Maywood, 729 F.3d 1196, 1205 (9th\nCir. 2013), which generally โis the forum in which the district court sits.โ  Prison\nLegal News v. Schwarzenegger, 608 F.3d 446, 454 (9th Cir. 2010).  In determining\nthe reasonableness of an hourly rate, the experience, skill, and reputation of the\nattorney requesting fees are taken into account.  Id. at 455; see also Webb v. Ada\n1  The parties agree, however, that Plaintiffs are entitled to an award of reasonable\nattorneysโ fees and that the lodestar method of calculation applies.  See Doc. No. 64, F&R at 5,\n7. \n5\n\nCase 1:12-cv-00469-JMS-RLP   Document 71   Filed 06/19/14   Page 6 of 22     PageID #:\n 1746\nCnty., 285 F.3d 829, 840 & n.6 (9th Cir. 2002).  โImportantly, the fee applicant has\nthe burden of producing โsatisfactory evidenceโ that the rates he requests meet\nthese standards.โ  Gonzalez, 729 F.3d at 1206 (citing Dang v. Cross, 422 F.3d 800,\n814 (9th Cir. 2005)); see also S.E.C. v. Gemstar-TV Guide Intโl, Inc., 401 F.3d\n1031, 1056 n.8 (9th Cir. 2005) (โ[I]t is โthe fee applicant [that] has the burden of\nproducing satisfactory evidence, in addition to the affidavits of its counsel, that the\nrequested rates are in line with those prevailing in the community for similar\nservices of lawyers of reasonably comparable skill and reputation.โ (quoting\nJordan v. Multnomah Cnty., 815 F.2d 1258, 1263 (9th Cir. 1987))).  \nIn a somewhat rambling fashion, Plaintiffs appear to argue that the\ncourt should ignore this well-entrenched standard.  In particular, Plaintiffs argue\nthat the court should determine a reasonable hourly rate based on the Laffey\nmatrix, Doc. Nos. 56-9, 56-10, Pls.โ Exs. 4, 5, which is a grid of inflation-adjusted\nhourly rates for lawyers with varying levels of experience in the Washington, D.C.\narea, and which was approved in Laffey v. Nw. Airlines, Inc., 572 F. Supp. 354\n(D.D.C. 1983), affโd in part, revโd in part on other grounds, 746 F.2d 4 (D.C. Cir.\n1984).  Plaintiffs contend that the court should apply the Laffey matrix โas\nevidence of a baseline standard that would reflect the true market value of legal\nservices,โ because courts in this district โnotoriously award[] fees far below any\n6\n\nCase 1:12-cv-00469-JMS-RLP   Document 71   Filed 06/19/14   Page 7 of 22     PageID #:\n 1747\nreasonable rate on the mainland and/or Hawaii.โ  Doc. No. 65, Pls.โ Objs. at 3; see\nalso Doc. No. 56-1, Mot. at 14-24 (citing fee awards in this district to argue that\nthis districtโs practice is to reject evidence of prevailing rates and instead rely on\nthe courtโs purported unsupported โknowledgeโ of prevailing rates).  Plaintiffs\nargue that this practice is โparticularly troublingโ in light of Honoluluโs high cost\nof living and the salary gap between Hawaii and certain locations on the mainland. \nSee also Doc. No. 56-7, Pls.โ Ex. 2 (United States Census Bureau Cost of Living\nIndex); Doc. No. 65-3, Pls.โ Ex. 2 (news articles on Hawaiiโs high cost of living\nand salary gap compared to certain locations on the mainland).    \nThe Laffey matrix and evidence regarding the cost of living in Hawaii\ndo not address the applicable standard for determining a reasonable hourly rate --\ni.e., they are not evidence of the prevailing rates in the District of Hawaii.  See\nPrison Legal News, 608 F.3d at 454 (โ[J]ust because the Laffey matrix has been\naccepted in the District of Columbia does not mean that it is a sound basis for\ndetermining rates elsewhere, let alone in a legal market 3,000 miles away.โ); J & J\nSports Prods., Inc. v. Arvizu, 2014 WL 2135996, at *2 (D. Ariz. May 22, 2014)\n(rejecting Laffey matrix as applicable to determining hourly rates in Arizona);\nLema v. Comfort Inn Merced, 2014 WL 1577042, at *4 (E.D. Cal. Apr. 17, 2014)\n(โThe Laffey Matrix is inapplicable to the determination of market rates in both the\n7\n\nCase 1:12-cv-00469-JMS-RLP   Document 71   Filed 06/19/14   Page 8 of 22     PageID #:\n 1748\nNinth Circuit and the Eastern District.โ); Project Vote/Voting for Am., Inc. v. Long,\n887 F. Supp. 2d 704, 712 (E.D. Va. 2012) (โ[T]he Laffey matrix is insufficient as a\nreliable indicator of reasonable rates for a case proceeding outside of Washington,\nD.C.โ); JJCO, Inc. v. Isuzu Motors Am., Inc., 2010 WL 3001924, at *5 (D. Haw.\nJuly 30, 2010) report and recommendation adopted as modified, 2010 WL\n4272980 (D. Haw. Oct. 21, 2010) (rejecting Laffey matrix as evidence of\nprevailing market rates in Hawaii).  Indeed, it is irrelevant that attorneys in other\ndistricts may receive higher hourly rates or that Hawaii has a higher cost of living\nand lower salary ranges.  Rather, the court must determine a reasonable hourly rate\nin this market, based on the hourly rate, the experience, skill, and reputation of the\nattorneys requesting the fees.  \nSetting aside Plaintiffsโ argument to ignore the applicable standard, as\nto the market rates in this district Plaintiffs present (1) declarations of Plaintiffsโ\ncounsel detailing their experience, and the novelty and undesirability of this case;\n(2) a Pacific Business News article indicating that the City recently paid outside\ncounsel hourly rates between $295.00 and $495.00 for work in connection with\nHonoluluโs $5.2 billion rail transit project, see Doc. No. 58-1, Errata, Pls.โ Ex. 1;\nand (3) citations to numerous attorneysโ fees orders in this district.  Doc. Nos. 56-2\n- 56-4, Decls. of Holcomb, Brazier, and Beck.  Although counselsโ experience\n8\n\nCase 1:12-cv-00469-JMS-RLP   Document 71   Filed 06/19/14   Page 9 of 22     PageID #:\n 1749\njustifies a much lower hourly rate than requested based on the prevailing rates\ngranted in other District of Hawaii cases, Plaintiffs argue that they should be\nawarded their requested rates because (1) Mr. Holcomb has his own practice and\nhas had โa number of significant legal victories and publications,โ see Doc. No. 65,\nPls.โ Obj. at 8-9; (2) the orders in this district show that courts simply apply the\nsame hourly rates based on an unsupported assertion that the court is aware of the\nprevailing rates; and (3) the Pacific Business News article suggests that the\nprevailing hourly rates are higher than the rates awarded in these cases.  The court\nrejects Plaintiffsโ argument. \nAs an initial matter, the court finds the Pacific Business News article\nunhelpful in determining the prevailing market rates in Hawaii for similar services. \nThe hourly rates listed in this article are not tied in any way to the particular\nattorneys charging such rates -- there is no information indicating the experience,\nskill, and reputation of counsel.  And comparing this relatively simple First\nAmendment case to the complex rail transit litigation provides no meaningful\nguidance to the court.  The scope and complexity of work on the rail transit project,\nwhich has faced multiple federal and state legal challenges and has several moving\nparts, is not at all comparable to the work required in this single case, which was\n9\n\nCase 1:12-cv-00469-JMS-RLP   Document 71   Filed 06/19/14   Page 10 of 22     PageID #:\n 1750\nfar less contentious and was largely resolved through a negotiated settlement.2 \nSimply put, such a comparison is off the track.  \nNor do the declarations of Plaintiffsโ counsel and arguments for a\nhigher rate based on experience support Plaintiffsโ requested hourly rates.  The\ndeclarations of counsel describe only their experience, and fail to explain how\ncounselsโ experience compares to any reasonable rate in this district.  See Jordan,\n815 F.2d at 1263 (โThe fee applicant has the burden of producing satisfactory\nevidence, in addition to the affidavits of its counsel . . . [of] prevailing [rates] in the\ncommunity for similar services of lawyers of reasonably comparable skill and\nreputation.โ) (emphasis added).  Further, the mere fact that Mr. Holcomb started\nhis own firm does not suggest that counsel is entitled to the hourly rates awarded\nattorneys with many more years experience -- reasonable hourly rates are\ndetermined by experience, skill, and reputation, not title.  And although Plaintiffsโ\ncounsel has had some successes in civil rights litigation, the court is well aware of\nthe experience and skill of counsel,3 and finds that an hourly rate commensurate\n2  In arguing that the rail transit litigation is not unduly complex, Plaintiffs cite to\nKaleikini v. Yoshioka, 129 Haw. 454, 304 P.3d 252 (2013).  Plaintiffs ignore, however, that\nKaleikini, applying the same test as in this case, reduced the requested hourly rate of the\nprevailing attorneys, awarding $300 per hour for an attorney with 20 years experience, and $160\nan hour for an attorney with 3 years experience.  Id. at 473, 304 P.3d at 271.  The courtโs hourly\nrates awarded below are in line with Kaleikini.  \n3  Beyond this action, Plaintiffsโ counsel has appeared before this court in an unrelated\n(continued...)\n10\n\nCase 1:12-cv-00469-JMS-RLP   Document 71   Filed 06/19/14   Page 11 of 22     PageID #:\n 1751\nwith their years of experience is appropriate.  \nIn determining the reasonable hourly rates for attorneys with\ncounselsโ years of experience, the court is left with little evidence from Plaintiffs \n-- as described above, the Laffey matrix and the Pacific Business News article are\nunhelpful, and Plaintiffs do not provide declarations from other attorneys or even\nstate what their usual billing rates are for paying clients.4  That is, counsel failed to\n3(...continued)\ncase, De-Occupy Honolulu et al. v. City & County of Honolulu et al., Civ. No. 12-00668 JMS-\nKSC.  In De-Occupy Honolulu, the court struck counselsโ motion for summary judgment\nbecause, among other reasons, they failed to authenticate their evidence.  Id. at Doc. No. 188.  In\ntheir Reply in support of attorneysโ fees in this action, Plaintiffs suggest the court improperly\nstruck their De-Occupy motion because authentication was unnecessary where the exhibits were\nauthenticated by operation of law when the defendants failed to timely file responses to Requests\nfor Admissions.  Doc. No. 70, Pls.โ Reply at 7.  Plaintiffs are mistaken -- regardless of whether\nDefendants could have disputed exhibits presented in a summary judgment motion, Plaintiffs\nmust still authenticate what they present to the court.  In other words, Plaintiffs must provide a\ndeclaration identifying each exhibit.  \nCounselโs submissions in this case are no different -- they attach exhibits to their Motion\nand Objections without ever providing a declaration identifying and authenticating those exhibits\nto the court.  Such sloppiness does nothing to support counselsโ claim of experience and skill.   \n4  Although not entirely clear, it appears that Plaintiffs argue that the court should\nconsider the declarations and articles referred to in the numerous District of Hawaii cases which\nPlaintiffs cite -- i.e., that the court should go to each individual docket of the cases Plaintiffs cite\nand review the declarations and evidence submitted by attorneys in those cases.  See Doc. No.\n65, Pls.โ Objs. at 4, n.6 (โDefendants completely ignored the various Declarations and Pacific\nBusiness News articles presented in the prior cases cited in and attached to Plaintiffsโ brief. \nThese past decisions discussing the evidence presented in those [cases] . . . are proper\nevidence.โ); see also id. at 5-6 (contending that the magistrate judge ignored their evidence of\nprevailing market rates consisting of โpast requests, Declarations, and evidence fromโ these cited\ncases).  If this was Plaintiffsโ intent, they again misunderstand how to present evidence. \nDeclarations and other evidence referred to in Plaintiffsโ cited cases were not submitted in this\naction for the courtโs consideration.  Mere citation to prior cases discussing specific evidence\nfrom those cases neither compels judicial notice of nor provides proper authentication of the\nunderlying evidence for use in this case.  See Ungureanu v. A. Teichert & Son, 2011 WL\n(continued...)\n11\n\nCase 1:12-cv-00469-JMS-RLP   Document 71   Filed 06/19/14   Page 12 of 22     PageID #:\n 1752\npresent โsatisfactory evidenceโ to support the rates requested.  See Gonzalez, 729\nF.3d at 1206.  The court must therefore rely on its knowledge of the communityโs\nprevailing rates, the hourly rates generally granted by this court, the courtโs\nfamiliarity with this case, and Plaintiffsโ counselโs submissions detailing their\nexperience.  See Ingram v. Oroudjian, 647 F.3d 925, 928 (9th Cir. 2011).5 \n  And in making this determination, the court finds helpful -- despite\nPlaintiffsโ argument to the contrary -- the numerous cases in this district discussing\nthe prevailing hourly rates in this district.6  Although Plaintiffs argue that the rates\n4(...continued)\n4862425, at *2 (E.D. Cal. 2011) (โ[F]acts contained in a declaration . . . found in another case . .\n. could not normally be judicially noticed.); see also Forest v. Equitable Life Assurance Socโy of\nthe U.S., 2001 WL 1338809, at *3 (N.D. Cal. June 12, 2001) (rejecting deposition taken and\nexhibits acquired in another case because they were not properly authenticated in this case).  \n5  Ingram provides that the court may rely, at least โin part, on its own knowledge and\nexperienceโ in determining the prevailing market rate.  647 F.3d at 928; see also Family PAC v.\nFerguson, --- Fed. Appx. ----, 2014 WL 1047658, at *1 (9th Cir. Mar. 19, 2014) (โIn\ndetermining prevailing market rates, the court properly relied on a declaration from an attorney\nin the relevant market and its own knowledge of the legal market.โ).  In an apparent\ncontradiction, Gonzalez v. City of Maywood, 729 F.3d 1196, 1206 (9th Cir. 2013), provides that\nโno Ninth Circuit case law supports the district courtโs apparent position that it could determine\nthe hourly rates for the members of Plaintiffsโ legal team, without relying on evidence of\nprevailing market rates.โ  Reading Gonzalez literally to require evidence of prevailing market\nrates even where a plaintiff fails to carry his burden and presents no evidence of the prevailing\nmarket rates would leave this court in a bind in determining reasonably attorneysโ fees.  Rather,\nthe court believes that Gonzalez and Ingram permit he court to consider other cases in this\nDistrict awarding attorneysโ fees -- these cases determined the prevailing market rates based on\nthe evidence presented, and these evidence-based determinations help this court to determine the\nprevailing market rate in this District.    \n6  These cases include, for example, Tylor v. Smart Enter., 2013 WL 6843056, at *7 (D.\nHaw. Dec. 26, 2013) (finding $150 a reasonable hourly rate for attorney admitted to Hawaii bar\n(continued...)\n12\n\nCase 1:12-cv-00469-JMS-RLP   Document 71   Filed 06/19/14   Page 13 of 22     PageID #:\n 1753\nin these orders must be below the prevailing market rate given that they rarely\naward the hourly rates requested by attorneys, such fact just as easily suggests that\nattorneys seek higher rates from the court than they may charge a paying client. \nIndeed, Plaintiffs assert that Messrs. Brazier and Holcomb share a case that is\nbilled hourly by a paying client at $250 an hour, see Doc. No. 65, Objs. at 10, yet\nthey both seek an hourly rate much higher than what this single client pays them.7 \nThus, Plaintiffs have failed to convince the court that the hourly rates awarded in\n6(...continued)\nsince 2010); Trendex Fabrics, Ltd. v.

Apr. 26, 2010) (finding manifestly reasonable a $174 hourly\nrate for a government attorney with 2 years of federal clerkship experience and approximately\n9.5 years of experience as a trial attorney with the Department of Justice, Tax Division).\n7  Needless to say, what Messrs. Brazier and Holcomb are able to charge a single client\ndoes not suggest they command this rate as to all their clients and/or are entitled to such rate as a\nreasonable hourly rate. \n13\n\nCase 1:12-cv-00469-JMS-RLP   Document 71   Filed 06/19/14   Page 14 of 22     PageID #:\n 1754\nattorneysโ fees orders in this district do not reflect the prevailing rates.  Rather,\ngiven the courtโs knowledge of this case and counselsโ experience, the court finds\nthose rates appropriate in this case.     \nAlthough the rates recommended by the F&R are within the range of\nreasonable rates for counselsโ experience, the court finds that a small upward\nadjustment to place counsel at the higher end of reasonable rates is necessary given\nthe nature of this case and to ensure representation in civil rights cases.  The court\ntherefore ADOPTS the hourly rate for Mr. Beck, but MODIFIES the hourly rates\nfor Mr. Holcomb, who has practiced for nine years, and Mr. Brazier, who has\npracticed for 7.5 years, to $200.00 and $185.00 respectively. \nB. Reduction for Billing in Hour and Half-Hour Increments\nPlaintiffs argue that the F&Rโs 25% across-the-board reduction for\ncounselsโ billing in mostly hour and half-hour increments is unwarranted where\ncounsel asserted that their submitted hours had already been reduced and Mr.\nHolcombโs submitted time sheet shows that he did not charge for several tasks. \nSee Doc. No. 65, Pls.โ Obj. at 23-25.  The court agrees with Plaintiffs in part.  \nCourts in this district have generally applied a percent reduction for\nbilling in quarter-hour increments.  See Harris v. Trash Man, LLC, 2013 WL\n1932715, at *4 (D. Haw. Apr. 16, 2013) (reducing award by 10% for quarter-hour\n14\n\nCase 1:12-cv-00469-JMS-RLP   Document 71   Filed 06/19/14   Page 15 of 22     PageID #:\n 1755\nbilling); Robinson v. Plourde, 717 F. Supp. 2d 1092, 1100-01 (D. Haw. 2010)\n(applying a 20% reduction for billing in quarter-hour increments); World Triathlon\nCorp. v. Dunbar, 539 F. Supp. 2d 1270, 1286 (D. Haw. 2008) (affirming 10%\nreduction for quarter-hour billing).  The rationale for such reduction is that where\ncounsel bills in larger time increments (such as quarter-hour, half-hour, and hour\nincrements in this case), tasks more likely than not took only a portion of the time\nbilled, resulting in requests for excessive hours.  See World Triathalon Corp., 539\nF. Supp. 2d at 1286.  \nCounselsโ time sheets indicate that they largely billed in hour or half\nhour increments, which suggests that the hours billed are excessive.  Indeed, the\nbulk of counselsโ time sheets are comprised of entries billed in half-hour and full\nhour increments, with many entries spanning multiple hours, and with the\ndescription for each entry lacking in any amount of specificity.  For example, one\nof Mr. Brazierโs entries states, โDraft memo re MSJโ for six hours, Doc. No. 56-3,\nBrazier Decl. Ex. A, but certainly Mr. Brazier did not sit at his desk for six hours\nstraight drafting a summary judgment motion, and he certainly could have\ndescribed his work for this six-hour period with more specificity (e.g., Were there\nparticular portions of the motion he worked on during this time?  Did his work\nduring this time period involve research?).  And although each counsel includes the\n15\n\nCase 1:12-cv-00469-JMS-RLP   Document 71   Filed 06/19/14   Page 16 of 22     PageID #:\n 1756\nboiler-plate statement in each of their declarations that โ[i]n certain instances, I\nhave exercised billing judgment to omit hours reasonably related to the case but\nwhich I did not deem sufficiently relevant to the results to warrant inclusion in a\nmotion for attorneysโ fees,โ Doc. No. 56-2, Holcomb Decl. at 8; Doc. No. 59-1,\nBrazier Decl. at 6; Doc. No. 60, Beck Decl. at 4, this bare statement, in the face of\ntheir block billing and vague descriptions, offers no insight into what time was\nreduced or omitted.  Absent some specificity, the court cannot determine whether\nadequate billing judgment was exercised or if counsel merely incorporated\nboilerplate language.  See Gilster v. Primebank, 884 F. Supp. 2d 811, 877 (N.D.\nIowa 2012) (finding that absent an indication of which fees counsel excluded from\nfee requests, the court had โno way of knowing whether this is simply boilerplate\nfee affidavit language, or whether some billing judgment was actually exercisedโ). \nWith that said, however, the court does recognize that Mr. Holcombโs  time sheet\nlists some tasks for which he did not charge (although there is little indication as to\nhow long most of these tasks took Mr. Holcomb, and some tasks appear de\nminimis (i.e., โrequested continuance/settlement conferenceโ)).  These inclusions\nin his time sheet provide some details suggesting that some billing judgment was in\nfact exercised (despite the block billing and generalized descriptions of work).  The\ncourt therefore MODIFIES the F&R by imposing a 15% reduction as to counselsโ\n16\n\nCase 1:12-cv-00469-JMS-RLP   Document 71   Filed 06/19/14   Page 17 of 22     PageID #:\n 1757\ntime.  \nThe court further finds that this 15% reduction does not apply to\ncounselsโ time spent on the Objections to the F&R.  Unlike their earlier time\nsheets, Mr. Holcomb billed his time on the Objections in proper tenth-of-an-hour\nincrements, and he provided more detail in describing time spent.  \nC. Hours Billed for Specific Tasks\nThe F&R deducted 19.5 hours out of the total 39.5 hours requested for\nMr. Beckโs work on the Complaint.  Doc. No. 64, F&R at 17-18.  And of the 24.75\nhours billed for work on the Motion for Summary Judgment and Concise\nStatement of Facts, the F&R deducted 7 hours from Mr. Brazier and 6 hours from\nMr. Beck.  Id. at 17-19. \nAfter de novo review, the court agrees that work on the Complaint\nwas excessive and ADOPTS the 19.5 hour reduction of Mr. Beckโs time.  The two\ncauses of action asserted in the Complaint did not involve complicated facts, and\nalthough there were no cases directly on point addressing a public entityโs use of\nsocial media as a public forum, the legal framework is well-defined.  See, e.g.,\nWright v. Incline Vill. Gen. Improvement Dist., 665 F.3d 1128, 1134 (9th Cir.\n2011) (describing four categories of government property); Pleasant Grove City v.\nSummum, 555 U.S. 460, 469 (2009) (describing forums for free speech).  The court\n17\n\nCase 1:12-cv-00469-JMS-RLP   Document 71   Filed 06/19/14   Page 18 of 22     PageID #:\n 1758\ntherefore finds that the Complaint warranted no more than 20 hours to complete.  \nThe court further agrees that some work on the Motion for Summary\nJudgment was excessive -- largely because sections were lifted verbatim from the\nMotion for Preliminary Injunction.  The court disagrees, however, with the F&Rโs\ndetermination that further reductions are necessary because the motion for\nsummary judgment could have been avoided.  Doc. No. 64, F&R at 18.  Based on\nthe courtโs involvement in settlement negotiations just prior to the scheduled\nhearing on the Motion for Summary Judgment, the court finds that it was\nreasonable for Plaintiffs to file the Motion for Summary Judgment -- a binding\nsettlement had not been reached and a favorable determination on the motion for\nsummary judgment would cement Plaintiffsโ entitlement to attorneysโ fees. \nAccordingly, the court will reduce only 2.0 hours from the requested fees for the\nMotion for Summary Judgment from Mr. Brazier and 3.0 hours from Mr. Beck. \nTotal deductions from Plaintiffsโ requested fees for excessive hours are as follows: \n2.0 hours from Mr. Brazier, and 22.5 hours from Mr. Beck.\nD.  Duplicative Time\nPlaintiffs object to the deduction of 2.5 hours from Mr. Brazier and\n2.0 hours from Mr. Beck as duplicative for time spent in meetings/discussions with\nco-counsel.  Doc. No. 65, Pls.โ Objs. at 27.  \n18\n\nCase 1:12-cv-00469-JMS-RLP   Document 71   Filed 06/19/14   Page 19 of 22     PageID #:\n 1759\nThe court certainly recognizes that litigation often requires the\nparticipation of multiple attorneys, see Davis v. City & Cnty. of San Francisco, 976\nF.2d 1536, 1544 (9th Cir. 1992), vacated in part on other grounds, 984 F.2d 345\n(9th Cir. 1993), but โoverstaffing cases inefficiently is common, and district courts\nare therefore encouraged to scrutinize fee petitions for duplicative billing when\nmultiple lawyers seek fees.โ  Schlacher v. Law Offices of Phillip J. Rotche &\nAssocs., 574 F.3d 852, 858 (7th Cir. 2009); see also Lipsett v. Blanco, 975 F.2d\n934, 938 (1st Cir. 1992) (โA trial court should ordinarily greet a claim that several\nlawyers were required to perform a single set of tasks with healthy skepticism.โ).\nThus, as a general rule, the court does not permit more than one attorney to bill for\nattending: (1) a meeting between co-counsel; (2) a client meeting; or (3) a meeting\nwith opposing counsel.  See Seven Signatures Gen. Pโship, 871 F. Supp. 2d at 1055\n(internal citations omitted).  โIn such a situation, the court typically deducts the\ntime spent by the lowest-billing attorney.โ  Id. \nUpon de novo review, the court finds that Mr. Holcomb billed for nine\nhours of meetings/discussions/exchange of emails with co-counsel.  Doc. No. 56-2,\nHolcomb Decl., Ex. A.  He did not charge for additional specified meetings, but he\nalso did not indicate how much time was deducted for those additional meetings. \nId.  Of Mr. Holcombโs billed hours, Mr. Brazier billed 2.5 hours, during which he\n19\n\nCase 1:12-cv-00469-JMS-RLP   Document 71   Filed 06/19/14   Page 20 of 22     PageID #:\n 1760\nspent 1.5 hours discussing the status of filings and one hour discussing exhibits and\nfilings.  Doc. No. 59-1, Brazier Decl., Ex. A.  Mr. Beck billed 2 hours for two\nseparate one-hour discussions on the status of filings.  Doc. No. 60, Beck Decl.,\nEx. A.  Although the court commends counsel for voluntarily deducting much of\nthe time spent by Mr. Beck and Mr. Brazier in conference with co-counsel, the\ntime spent discussing the status of filings is redundant.  The court therefore\nADOPTS the F&R with regard to reductions for duplicative time of Mr. Brazier\n(2.5 hours) and Mr. Beck (2 hours).   \nE. Fees for Objections\nPlaintiffs seek additional fees for 22.4 hours spent by Mr. Holcomb on\nthe instant Objections.  Defendants did not oppose these additional hours in their\nResponse.  Nevertheless, the court finds the over six hours spent on additional\nresearch regarding the reasonable hourly rate to be excessive.  Significant research\non this issue was already done in connection with the Motion and therefore, the\ncourt deducts three hours.  Plaintiffs are therefore awarded an additional 19.4 hours\nfor work on the instant Objections.  \nF. Summary of Fees\nBased on the foregoing and those portions of the F&R that are\nadopted, the court finds that Plaintiffs are entitled to the following lodestar:\n20\n\nCase 1:12-cv-00469-JMS-RLP   Document 71   Filed 06/19/14   Page 21 of 22     PageID #:\n 1761\nAttorney Hours Rate Total\nRichard Holcomb 82.818 $200.00 $16,562.00\nBrian Brazier 35.069 $185.00 $6,486.10\nAlan Beck 47.610 $150.00 $7,140.00\nSubtotal 165.47 $30,188.10\nGET of 4.712% $1,422.46\nTOTAL $31,610.56\nV.  CONCLUSION\nAfter carefully reviewing the F&R de novo, having considered all\nwritten argument, and having fully analyzed the record, the court ADOPTS the\nF&R in part and MODIFIES the F&R in part as follows:  (1) awarding reasonable\nhourly rates for Mr. Holcomb in the amount of $200.00, and for Mr. Brazier in the\namount of $185.00; (2) applying a 15% reduction on the hours remaining after\nother reductions are taken for work excluding the Objections; and (3) deducting\nonly 2.0 hours from Mr. Brazier, and 3.0 hours from Mr. Beck, for work on the\n8  75.10 total hours requested (Doc. No. 56-2) - 0.5 clerical hours (deducted by F&R and\nnot objected to, Doc. No. 64 at 19) = 74.60 hours x 15% reduction (for quarter-hour billing) =\n63.41 hours + 19.4 hours for Objections = 82.81 total hours.  \n9  45.75 hours total hours requested (Doc. No. 56-3) - 2.0 excessive hours for Summary\nJudgment Motion (above at ยง IV(C)) - 2.5 duplicative hours (above at ยง IV(D)) = 41.25 hours x\n15% reduction = 35.06 total hours.\n10  81.0 hours total requested (Doc. No. 56-4) - 22.5 excessive hours (above at ยง IV(C)) -\n0.5 clerical hours (deducted by F&R and not objected to, Doc. No. 64 at 19) - 2.0 duplicative\nhours (above at ยง IV(D)) = 56.0 hours x 15% reduction = 47.6 total hours.\n21\n\nCase 1:12-cv-00469-JMS-RLP   Document 71   Filed 06/19/14   Page 22 of 22     PageID #:\n 1762\nMotion for Summary Judgment and Concise Statement of Facts.  In addition, the\ncourt awards Plaintiffs an additional 19.4 hours for Mr. Holcombโs work on the\nObjections, which is not subject to the 15% reduction.  Plaintiffs are awarded total\nattorneysโ fees in the amount of $31,610.56.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\nDATED:  Honolulu, Hawaii, June 19, 2014.\n /s/ J. Michael Seabright         \nJ.
