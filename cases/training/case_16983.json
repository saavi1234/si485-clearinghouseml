    "summary": "<p>In February 2006, over 150 prisoners who had been injured during a 2004 riot at Crowley County Correctional Facility (Crowley) filed this lawsuit in the Colorado District Court for the County of Crowley. They sued the Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), a private prison company that owned and operated Crowley (which incarcerates Colorado and other state prisoners), for negligence, outrageous conduct, and civil conspiracy. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought compensatory and punitive damages. They claimed that CCA’s mismanagement of Crowley caused their injuries by sparking the riot. The plainitffs also claimed that CCA’s employees carelessly injured them while trying to stop the riot. </p><p>The plaintiffs pointed to numerous deficiencies in CCA's operations at Crowley that they say caused the riot. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that CCA had provided inadequate food, used excessive force on prisoners, and failed to address prisoners’ grievances before the riot. Some prisoners did not get along well with new arrivals from Washington state. And the plaintiffs claimed that even prison officials knew violence was imminent. </p><p>The events underlying the lawsuit took place on July 20, 2004; some of the prisoners from Washington attacked reputed informants, set fires, and vandalized prison property. Guards fled, and it took several hours for CCA’s Special Operations Response Team to re-establish control. Many prisoners were injured during the riot or as CCA forces retook the prison. The plaintiffs claimed that they were shot, beaten, gassed, dragged through broken glass, or ordered to lie facedown in water containing blood and feces by CCA’s response team. They also alleged that after the riot they were denied water, clean clothing, access to restrooms, or adequate food; some also said they were forced to shower in front of female officers. </p><p>The plaintiffs faced several obstacles. First, they could not sue under 42 U.S.C. §1983 because they had not complied with the Prison Litigation Reform Act’s grievace requirements. Second, Colorado had abandoned joint and several liability, which allowed CCA to argue that any damage award should be reduced based on the rioters’ responsibility. Third, the plaintiffs feared that class certification would be difficult or impossible, so each individual prisoner had to be included as a named plaintiff. Finally, the plaintiffs’ potential recovery was limited because most did not have viable claims for lost wages or medical expenses. </p><p>The court consolidated this case with <i>Adams v. Correctional Corporation of America</i>, a similar lawsuit, but the litigation soon bogged down. CCA argued that the case should be dismissed because the prisoners did not exhaust administrative remedies before suing, failed to allege any compensable injuries, and prematurely claimed punitive damages. On March 6, 2007, Judge Michael Schiferl granted the defendants’ motion because the plaintiffs had not exhausted their administrative remedies and “the legislature wanted to provide for all administrative remedies to be exhausted for any claim based on prison conditions.” 2007 WL 5210192. The Colorado Court of Appeals reversed in a May 29, 2008, opinion by Judge JoAnn Vogt. Judge Vogt found that the plaintiffs need not exhaust remedies before bringing common law claims because the exhaustion requirement only applied to cases brought “under any statute or constitutional provision.” 187 P.3d 1190. The Colorado Supreme Court refused to hear CCA’s appeal over one dissent. 2008 WL 4958918. </p><p>After CCA’s motion to dismiss was denied, the parties tried to settle the case. CCA offered $250 to each prisoner, conditioned on a confidentiality agreement. The plaintiffs rejected the offer, and the case proceeded to discovery. </p><p>Another dispute arose in discovery. Approximately 170 plaintiffs who had been or were going to be deposed claimed that they could not afford copies of their deposition transcripts to review for errors. They asked the court to force CCA to provide them with electronic copies of their depositions that CCA was buying from the court reporter. The trial court denied the plaintiffs’ request, explaining “this is clearly a money issue and this Court will not take the work product from the reporter.” The plaintiffs appealed, but the Court of Appeals determined that the question of law at issue was not controlling and thus an interlocutory appeal was inappropriate. 264 P.3d 640. </p><p>Discovery continued, and the case was set for trial in March 2013. But as the trial date approached, the trial court issued rulings that pushed both parties back to the settlement table. The court bolstered the plaintiffs’ case by dismissing CCA’s counterclaims and affirmative defenses. But it also denied the plaintiffs’ motion for separate trials, and the Court of Appeals declined to intervene. Worse for the plaintiffs, the court ruled that each plaintiff who was not still in prison would have to testify in person. That presented logistical problems because by 2013, the plaintiffs lived in many states. And even some of the plaintiffs who were still in prison would have had to appear in person because their prisons refused them access to telephones or video conference equipment with which to testify remotely. Moreover, the plaintiffs worried that the jury would have difficulty remembering each of them well enough to make informed damages claims during a trial estimated to last 25 weeks. </p><p>On April 24, 2013, the parties announced that they had reached a $600,000 settlement. Each of the plaintiffs received between $1,500 and $17,000 depending on their individual injuries. Somewhat unusually, the settlement agreement was not confidential. </p><p>Bill Trine, the lead plaintiffs’ attorney, was disappointed in the amount; he described feeling “like a pregnant elephant that has just given birth to a mouse.” Some plaintiffs were happy with their recovery; others noted that the amount was “pennies on the dollar” for CCA and said “[not] much has changed” at Crowley since the riot. </p><p>The Clearinghouse was unable to locate copies of individual settlement agreements, but the case is presumably now closed. </p><p></p>",

In July, 2004, CCA owned and operated the\nCrowley County Correctional Facility (hereinafter “CCCF”) located in Crowley County,\nColorado.\n2. In order to increase its profits from housing prisoners, CCA has a national\npolicy and practice of cutting costs by building prisons in remote rural areas to take\nadvantage of cheapnon-unionlabor,then understaffingandprovidinginadequatetraining\nto its guards. It also increases profits by accepting inmates from other states in order to\nkeep its prisons filled. At all times material hereto, CCA’s national policies, practices\nandprocedures wereutilizedinits operationofCCCF.\n3. At all times material hereto, the individually named Defendants were\nemployees and/or agents of CCA acting under the direction and control of CCA and\nacting within the course and scope of their employment and/or agency. All tortious\nconduct of individual Defendants hereinafter alleged is imputed to CCA as a matter of\nlaw.\n4. At all times material hereto, and on July 20 and 21, 2004, the Plaintiffs\nwere inmates incarcerated at CCCF, a designated Level III or medium custody security\nfacilitywith an offender capacityof 1,144 disbursed through six cell houses.

On July 20, 2004, at approximately 7:00 p.m., inmates at CCCF were\nreleased to the recreation yards and at approximately7:05 p.m., a group of inmates in the\nWest Recreation Yard requested to speak to the Warden about complaints and grievances\nthat the inmates had, and the Shift Commander, Captain Garcia, accompanied by other\ncorrectional officers (hereinafter “CO’s”), denied the request and immediately retreated\nfrom the yard. The Shift Commander then directed that a public address system\nannouncement be made ordering all inmates in the yard to return to their living units.\nThe inmates who had requested to speak to the Warden became hostile and refused to\nreturn to their living units. An order was then given for the living units to lock their\ndoors andfortheprison stafftoprepareto evacuatetheirposts.\n9. CCCF did not have an adequate number of staff on duty and the staff\npresent was not adequatelytrainedto dispel adisturbance. Therefore,no effort was made\nby Captain Garcia and the CO’s to control the disturbance, and, instead, Captain Garcia\norderedthestafftopreparefor anemergencyevacuation.\n4\n\n10. The unruly group of inmates in the West Yard, upon observing the CO’s\nevacuate the yards, began usingfree weights and exercise equipment to break windows in\nHousingUnits 1and2.\n11. Plaintiffs who were in the West Yard when the disturbance occurred\nattempted to comply with the public address system announcement to return to their\nliving units, but the CO in the control room did not initially open the entrance to the\nHousing Units. The rioters broke into Housing Units 1 and 2, the CO’s fled and\nabandoned the Housing Units, and the rioters, knowing that all of the CO’s had fled,\nbegan engaging in more flagrant, violent misconduct. Fires were started in the Units and\nat the doors to the Units, the management offices were broken into, rioting inmates rifled\nthrough case management records and files looking for information on other inmates\nconsidered to be police informants (snitches) and sex offenders, who were then targeted\nforassault.\n12. Plaintiffs who were in the West Yard when the riot began and who were\nhoused in Unit 6 were never allowed into their unit, and they were trapped in the West\nYardthroughout the riot. Whiletrappedinthe West Yard, theywere forcedtoinhaletear\ngas and smoke,and they were shot or shot at by guards even though they were obviously\nnot participatingintheriot bysitting,lyingprone and/orholdingtheirhands intheair.\n13. Plaintiffs who were able to escape the West Yard and return to their Units\nwere forced to breathe the smoke created by fires because it filled the Units and the cells\nthrough the ventilation system and flowed under the cell doors. The rioters broke water\npipes, sinks and toilets, along with damage to water lines and sprinkler systems, causing\ncells to flood with water contaminated by feces, blood and broken glass. Plaintiffs who\nhad locked down in their cells had both water and smoke flowing into their cells under\nthe cell doors. These Plaintiffs were in fear for their lives, knowing that the guards had\nfled leaving them to the mercy of the rioters, and knowing that fires were filling their\ncells withtoxicsmoke,andthat theirlives were indanger from fire,smoke inhalationand\nriotinginmates. Manyof these Plaintiffs wrapped their faces with wet towels, attempting\nto protect themselves from toxic smoke inhalation. Many of these Plaintiffs also stuffed\nclothing or towels in the crack under their cell doors to reduce smoke inhalation. When\nthe SORT team entered, they injected tear gas into the ventilation system, forcing\nPlaintiffs who were in their cells to breathe and become covered with the toxic chemical\nfor an extended period of time within an enclosed space from which no escape was\npossible.\n14. When the riot began in the East Yard, Plaintiffs became trapped in the\nEast Yard units, which were also flooding with water contaminated by feces, blood and\nbroken glass. These Plaintiffs were also in fear for their lives, knowing that the guards\nhad fled leaving them to the mercyof therioters, and knowing that fires were filling their\ncells withtoxicsmoke,andthat theirlives were indanger from fire,smoke inhalationand\nrioting inmates. Plaintiffs in the East Yard units were also exposed to tear gas within\ntheir cells and units within an enclosed space for an extended period of time with no\nescapepossible.\n5\n\n15. Plaintiffs who were initially locked down in their cells when the riot\nstarted, but who asked other inmates to open their cell doors so that theycould escape the\nfires and smoke, observed CO’s using live ammunition, buckshot, birdseed, and rubber\npellets to shoot inmates leaving the units. These Plaintiffs had the choice of remaining in\nburningbuildings, sufferingsmoke inhalation or possible assault byrioters, or leavingthe\nbuildingandbeingshot. Most ofthem thereforestayedinthehousingunits.\n16. Some Plaintiffs were locked in their cells, the library, or the medical unit\nthroughout the riot. Plaintiffs locked in the library protected the librarian who was locked\nin with them. When the SORT teams finally came in, they brutalized these Plaintiffs in\nbasically the same manner as other Plaintiffs who were forced to escape their cells or\nunits in order to breathe or who were locked out of their unit and trapped in the West\nYard.\n17. Upon fleeing the recreation yards and Housing Units, the prison CO’s\nrequested assistance from the CCCF Special Operations Response Teams (“SORT”), and\nfrom the Colorado Department of Corrections (“DOC”), SORT and EmergencyResponse\nTeams (“ERT”), from the Colorado State Patrol, the Crowley County, Otero County and\nPueblo Sheriff’s Offices, and SORT team members from the Kit Carson and Bent County\nprivateprisons,whicharealso operatedbyCCA.\n18. The rioting continued unabated and spread to the East Recreation Yard\nand other Units. By 9:00 p.m., seven CCCF SORT members arrived and Unit 6, A Pod,\nwas locked down and CCCF Chief Selman gave the order to fire rubber bullets and\nbirdshot at inmates.\n19. In the next few hours, as CCCF SORT teams and SORT teams borrowed\nfrom other facilities took control of the prison, Plaintiffs who had been trapped in the\nRecreation Yard and who did not participate in the riot were ordered to lie facedown on\nthe ground, were ordered not to speak or move under threat of being shot, and their arms\nwere pulled to their backs where they were handcuffed at the wrists by plastic ratcheted\ntie cuffs that were pulled so tight that the cuffs cut into the skin and caused inmates’\nhands to become numb. The inmates were then further punished by SORT team\nmembers, many dressed in black with black masks and no nametags, who pulled inmates\nby the arms and cuffs to their feet. If an inmate complained of pain from the tight cuffs,\nthe cuffs, which had ratchets, would be used to pull the inmate to his feet, causing further\ncufftightening.\n20. After being cuffed, the inmates were walked to sections of the Yard being\nused to round up inmates where they were thrown to the ground and ordered not to move\nunderthreat ofbeingshot.\n21. Before SORT teams removed inmates from their cells in buildings filled\nwith smoke, theyshot teargas and sometimes pepper sprayinto the building and pods. As\n6\n\npepper spray and teargas entered the exhaust system of Units, inmates trapped in their\ncells sufferedfrom bothsmokeinhalationandtheteargas andpepperspray.\n22. When SORT teams entered cells on the floors that were flooded, inmates,\nincludingthe Plaintiffs whowereinthosecells, were orderedto liefacedowninthe water\ncontaining feces, blood, and broken glass, under threat or being shot if they refused to do\nso. The inmates, including Plaintiffs, were then dragged from their cells by their ankles\nthrough the contaminated water and glass. When removed from the cell, a SORT team\nmember would place a knee on the inmate’s neck while other SORT team members\nviolently pulled the inmate’s arms behind his back and placed ratcheted plastic tie cuffs\non the inmate’s wrists. The inmate was then walked by lifting thearms in the air behind\nthe inmate’s back, causing great pain to the wrists and shoulders, and was deposited\noutsidethebuildingwhereotherinmates from insidethebuildingwerebeingplaced.\n23. All of the Plaintiffs, as well as other inmates, werehandcuffed and treated\nas above-described and placed in the Yard where they remained throughout the night and\nmorningofthe followingday,July21,2004.\n24. Those inmates who were dragged from their cells by their ankles through\nwater were forced to lie facedown on the ground, in the dirt, which became mud. Being\ndrug through water or being soaked by the sprinkler system intensified the effects of tear\ngas and/or pepperspray. Plaintiffs werenot allowedtoremovethetear gas and/orpepper\nsprayfrom theirskin,eyes, mouthandclothing.\n25. Throughout the night and early morning, the Plaintiffs and other inmates\ncomplained to CO’s of wrist and shoulder pain, numbness of hands, and bleeding or\nswollen wrists and hands, asking that the handcuffs be loosened and all such requests\nweredenied,often withthestatement that,“this is what youdeservefor rioting.”\n26. All of the inmates, including the Plaintiffs, began requesting water as they\nbecame thirsty and as the sun came up and it became hot the following day, and all such\nrequests were denied until late morning, July 21, 2004. SORT team members drank\nwaterinfront ofthethirstyinmates, laughing.\n27. As it became necessary for each of the Plaintiffs to urinate or defecate,\nrequests tostand up to go urinate or use a restroom were denied and most of the Plaintiffs\nwere forced to urinate in their clothing while cramped close together in the yard and\nsome had to defecate in their pants. When asked to use the restroom, SORT team\nmembers or CO’s told them to “pee in your pants,” indicating this was further\npunishment fortheriot.\n28. During the morning of July 21, 2004, the handcuffs were removed from\nthe backs of many Plaintiffs and new cuffs placed on their wrists in front so that they\ncould eat bologna sandwiches provided duringthe day. Some Plaintiffs either did not get\nthe handcuffs removed from their backs to their fronts so that they could eat, or were not\ngivenfoodwhenotherPlaintiffs werefed.\n7\n\n29. Bythelate afternoonofJuly21,2004,thePlaintiffs wereplacedincells in\nother pods that had not been damaged by the riot, but which were already occupied by\ninmates. Some were placed in cells in a building still under construction, which had no\nmattresses or bedding, and some were returned to cells still containing smoke and the\nremnants of gas or pepper spray, but with no mattresses or bedding. All mattresses and\nbeddingwere removed from Plaintiffs’cells beforetheyreturned.\n30. As further punishment, Plaintiffs were not provided clean clothing or a\nchange in clothing and were not allowed to take showers. All of the Plaintiffs and other\ninmates were placed in “lockdown” and could not leave their cells. Box lunch bologna\nsandwiches were kicked into their cells daily and their diet consisted of bologna\nsandwiches forthefirst monthfollowingtheriot.\n31. After the first three days, CO’s began taking Plaintiffs and other inmates\nto showers where all shower curtains had been removed and they were forced to strip\ndown, often in front of female CO’s, and were paraded naked into the showers. This\nactivity was often videotaped. Some Plaintiffs did not receive a shower until the fourth\nor fifth day following the riot, and some had to wait seven or ten days. With all personal\nproperty removed from cells, none of the Plaintiffs had clothing they could change into\nandremovetheirfilthyclothingcontainingurine andtear gas.\n32. All of the Plaintiffs, together with other inmates, were in lockdown for at\nleast thirty days after the riot with no hot meals, no special dietary food for those with\nmedical conditions which required special diets, with no access to telephones, no visitors\npermitted, and no access to the legal system. Plaintiffs who received medications were\ndenied their prescription medications, and most Plaintiffs were denied medical care for\ntheirinjuries.\nFIRST CLAIM FORRELIEF\n(Common Law Negligencein CausingRiot)\n33. CCA, through its officers, agents and employees, was negligent, which\nnegligence was a substantial cause of the riot which occurred on July 20, 2004, and\nwhichnegligenceconsisted,inter alia, inthefollowing:\na. Inequalityof Treatment\n(1) Duringthedays priortotheriot,198inmates from theState\nof Washington were moved to CCCF. They, along with 116 inmates from\nWyoming and 807 Colorado inmates, brought the facility’s total\npopulation to 1,130. CCA knew or reasonably should have known that\naccepting large numbers of inmates from Washington would result in\nresentment and anger over the inequities arising from disparate treatment\nthat each groupofinmates received.\n8\n\n(2) CCA knew before receiving inmates from Washington and\nWyoming that the amount of inmate wages paid by each state per month\nfor similar inmate work assignments is different, ranging from $60 paid to\nWashington and Wyoming inmates while Colorado pays $18.60 per\nmonth.\n(3) CCA knew that, in separating Washington inmates from\ntheir families in Washington who could no longer visit, that the lack of\nvisitation and connection with family would result in severe distress,\ndepression and anxiety among many Washington inmates, and would\nresult inunrest that could leadtoorcontributetoa disturbance.\n(4) CCA did not provide inmates with supplies and items\nnecessary for hygiene, and CCA was aware of inmate complaints of not\nearningenoughmoneyto purchaseneededitems from thecanteen.\nb. Food Service.\n(1) CCA failed to be responsible for ensuring that the food\nserved adhered to CDOC mandated menu items in violation of C.R.S. §\n17-1-202(1)(f),whichviolationconstitutes negligence per se.\n(2) Inmates’ complaints about food quality and quantity were\nignored by CCA, as were inmate complaints of treatment disparity\nbetween Colorado inmates and Washington inmates regarding food\nportions.\n(3) Inmate complaints of improper preparation of medical and\nreligious diets bythefoodservicestaffwereignoredbyCCA.\nc. Misuseof Force.\n(1) CCA staff improperly used excessive force on inmates\nprior to the riot, which angered many inmates who became aware of the\nuseofexcessiveforce.\n(2) CCA negligently trained and monitored its employees,\nwhichresultedinemployees’useofexcessiveand improperforce.\nd. Failureto Address InmateGrievances and Issues.\n(1) On July 20, 2004, some inmates in the West Recreation\nYard requested to speak to the warden about their grievances and\ncomplaints, whichrequest was deniedbyCCA’s shift commander.\n9\n\ne. CCAIgnored PriorWarnings of Potential Riot.\n(1) CCA was warned by members of its staff and by some\ninmates that inmates were unhappy and could riot if the issues and\ngrievances were not addressed. CCA negligently ignored these warnings\nandtooknoremedial action.\nf. KnowledgeofPriorRiot.\n(1) CCA knew or reasonably should have known of a prior riot\nat CCCF in 1999, resulting from a massive move of Washington inmates\nfrom Washington to CCCF, yet CCA negligently permitted another mass\nremoval ofWashingtonprisoners toCCCFinearlyJuly2004,which again\nresultedinariot created bythe conditions heretoforeset forth.\ng. Failureto ProvideServices and Programs\n(1) CCA failed to be responsible for providing licensed\nmedical and psychological services, education and work programs at least\nequal to those provided at comparable state correctional facilities, which\nviolation constitutes negligence per se under C.R.S. § 17-1-202(1)(f) and\nC.R.S.§25-3-101.\nh. FailureTo ProvideOr Follow AdequateSecurityMeasures.\n(1) CCA failed to limit incarceration of inmates to those\nclassified as medium custody and below, and then failed to provide or\nconsistentlyfollowadequatesecuritymeasures.\ni. LengthyCountTimes\n(1) CCA failed to adequately staff the prison and properlytrain\nprison staff, which resulted in lengthy and inaccurate body counts of\ninmates several times a day while inmates were in lockdown for body\ncounts. The delayed body counts, while in lockdown, deprived inmates of\ntime scheduled for programs and recreation. The problem was aggravated\nuponarrival oflargenumbers ofWashingtoninmates.\n34. Although Plaintiffs did not participate in the riot, CCA’s negligence,\nwhich was a cause of the riot, resulted in Plaintiffs being physically and mentally abused\nas set forth in Paragraphs 12 through 32 of this Complaint. As a result, each of the\nPlaintiffs was injuredanddamagedinthefollowingparticulars:\na.

The facility is \nlocated approximately forty miles east of Pueblo on Highway 96, near the \ncommunity of Olney Springs.  CCCF is designated a Level III, or medium \ncustody security correctional institution with an offender capacity of 1,144 \ndispersed throughout six cell houses (Cellhouse 5 construction incomplete at \nthe time of the riot), including the recent completion of an additional 312-bed \nunit. There are no towers, although an observation deck is located over the \ngymnasium; observation cameras are located throughout. The facility is \nowned and operated by Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), \nNashville, Tennessee.   \n \nAt approximately 7:30 P.M., the facility’s inmate population, many of \nwhom were located in the recreational yard, began to disregard staff orders to \nclear the yard and openly displayed non-compliant behavior.  A disturbance \nquickly escalated to the level of a riot, which included inmates destroying \nproperty, setting fires, seriously assaulting other inmates and, over the period \nof the next several hours, causing damage to the facility’s physical plant and \nsecurity systems.  Additional costs were incurred for emergency medical \nassistance, staff overtime, rehabilitation of buildings and grounds, as well as \ncosts associated with the activation of emergency response teams, \ninvestigators, K-9 units and the Emergency Mobile Command Center, all \ndeployed to assist with the uprising.  \n \nDuring the days and weeks after the riot, over 1,400 investigative \ninterviews were conducted by the Office of Inspector General, Colorado \nDepartment of Corrections.  Colorado Bureau of Investigations agents were \nutilized to assist, as well as a Washington State Department of Corrections \ninvestigator, Crowley County Sheriff’s Office and the CCCF investigator.  \nInformation resulting from these interviews is found throughout the report. \nExtensive staff time by a number of other CDOC employees has resulted in \nthe accumulation and compilation of critical details related to the incident. \n \n This document is being presented for the benefit of state government \nofficials, the media, members of the general public and others for the purpose \n6  \n \n\n \nof analyzing the facts and circumstances related to the incident. During the \npreparation of this report, a simultaneous criminal investigation was ongoing \nand being conducted by the Office of the Inspector General, Colorado \nDepartment of Corrections.  Therefore, certain sensitive data which might be \nutilized during legal proceedings is referred to in this document in general \nterms only, so as not to compromise the process. \n \nRiots and disturbances in correctional institutions are complex and varied \nand often cannot be attributed to any single cause or groups of causes.  \nWhether public or private, the correctional setting is, by its very nature, an \nunusual living environment, which may contribute to the emotional stress of \nthose incarcerated.  There are limited personal freedoms, monotony, \nregimentation, frustration, hopelessness, anxiety about family and friends and \nracial or other conflicts. However, correctional organizations are accustomed \nto utilizing management strategies which strive for fairness and parity with \nregard to conditions of confinement, treatment, education, training and \nnecessary community reentry opportunities, while, at the same time, carrying \nout the orders of the court. \n \n  For all involved, prison riots are fundamentally a threat to life and safety, \nwhich can turn a stressful environment into a tragedy.  In the case of the \nCrowley riot, every attempt has been made to identify those elements that may \nhave contributed to the incident, knowing full well that the propensity for any \nunrest can rarely be attributed to a single point of origin.   \n \nAmong the goals of this report, therefore, are conclusions and \nrecommendations.  Corrections professionals, whether working in publicly-\noperated or private correctional facility environments, can often discover \nuseful strategies from lessons learned, and, if acted on appropriately, may \nprevent riots of this magnitude in the future.   \n \n \nHistory of Prison Privitization in Colorado \n \nIn recent years, virtually every state in the Union has experienced rapid \ngrowth of their prison populations.  In fact, Colorado’s inmate population \nexceeded CDOC’s physical capacity beginning in 1988.  On September 2, \n1988 the Colorado Department of Corrections moved 105 inmates to an \nempty, state owned facility in Washington.  At that time, the Department's \ncapacity for male inmates in other than community corrections beds was \n7  \n \n\n \n4,547.  Records show the on-grounds count was 4,517 with and additional 151 \ninmates off-grounds (out to court or in hospitals).  Additionally, the county \njails were holding 374 inmates that had been sentenced to the Department but \nwere being held due to the lack of bed space.  During the ten (10) year \nexperience of housing inmates in out of state placement, the highest number \nwas 1,684 in October, 1997 and the low was 13 in December, 1990.  County \njails became over crowded and lawsuits against the state were initiated in an \neffort to remove CDOC inmates.  Court orders were issued and subsequent \ncontempt citations filed to compel removal of state prisoners from county \njails.  No state beds were available, however, and a process of prioritization \nensued, virtually pitting counties against each other.  Early parole was not a \nviable option.  The American Civil Liberties Union began to threaten \nlitigation against Denver and Arapahoe Counties, forcing them to build new \njail space.  In all, the CDOC went to the Colorado Supreme Court three times \nseeking resolution. \n \n Consequently, county, state and private beds were contracted for in the \nstates of Missouri, Minnesota, Washington, Wyoming and Texas.  Offenders \nclassified as medium custody and below were selected for out of state moves. \nDuring this period, a number of lawsuits were filed; however, the courts \nunanimously upheld CDOC’s position regarding these placements.  \nEventually, beds became available with the construction of additional state \nand privately funded facilities, so that, by December, 1998, all inmates had \nbeen returned to Colorado.  \n \nLike most states, Colorado’s budget has been challenged for the past \nseveral years, virtually eliminating the availability of capital construction \nfunding for additional, state-owned prison bed space.  Therefore, partnerships \nhave been further enhanced with the governmental entities where private \nprisons are constructed, in order to manage inmates and meet the state’s \npublic safety mission. Today, approximately 2,797 Colorado offenders are \nhoused in these facilities. Of that number, 121 are located in Tallahatchie \nCounty, Mississippi.   \n \nThe merits of privatization are often discussed with regard to \ndifferential costs, liability, level of oversight, staffing and quality of physical \nplant construction.  The private prison industry is driven by a need created \nwhen the number of inmates exceeds the number of state owned beds.  \nSimply, the public expects to be protected; if no state funds are available for \nprison construction, a market for private prisons exists, based upon the need \nfor bed space at any given time.  Arguments can be made for and against the \n8  \n \n\n \nconcept of private prisons. However, as of this date, due to the lack of \nsufficient public beds, the choice is stark; approximately 2,797 Colorado \nfelons can either be placed in private facilities, in out of state facilities or on \nthe street.   \n \nFor the most part, private prison operators are exempted from many \ngovernmental requirements with regard to purchasing and personnel \nmanagement. While constructing and activating private correctional facilities \ncan benefit local communities and provide positive economic impact, \nconversely, accessing and hiring sufficient numbers of employees to staff such \ninstitutions can be challenging.   \n \n  Contractual arrangements are made between the Colorado Department \nof Corrections and cities or counties where the facilities have been sited. A \ndaily per diem rate, approved by the Colorado State Legislature each year, is \npaid to these local governments; they, in turn, create subcontracts with private \nprison operators.  At present, a rate of $49.56 is being paid per inmate, per day \nin Colorado.  $51.00 is being paid to Tallahatchie County in Mississippi for \nColorado inmates being housed there. This fee does not cover case \nmanagement oversight, transportation or non-routine medical care for TCCF.  \nThe arrangement is often known as the “Customer Model” whereby a level of \nservices is defined, in keeping with standards imposed by the American \nCorrectional Association, CDOC regulations, state and federal law.  \n   \n  Which offenders are best placed in privately owned beds?  Bed \nmanagement for CDOC’s offender population is driven by a number of \nfactors:  trends in population growth, average length of stay, new criminal \nlaws and sentences, parole populations, community corrections, rate of \nrevocation, medical and mental health needs, other special program needs, as \nwell as an inmate’s ability to progress to a less secure environment.  Further, \nthe department’s classification system characterizes levels of risk, which \nultimately influences facility placement. With this is mind, the Colorado \nDepartment of Corrections houses the most difficult to manage inmates, with  \nbehavior and custody issues, as well as those with advanced medical and \nmental health conditions, while the private facilities provide only moderate  \nmedical care to relatively healthy inmates classified at medium custody and \nbelow.  Prior to release for parole or discharge, offenders are returned to \nCDOC facilities for out-processing. \n \n \n \n9  \n \n\n \nStatutory Authority \n \n  The Colorado Revised Statutes governing authorization of CDOC to \nplace offenders in private prisons, expectations regarding performance and \noversight are found in Title 17.  Private facilities are expected to follow \nCDOC Administrative Regulations where specified, as defined in the \ncontracts.  Waivers may be requested and granted for those regulations that do \nnot apply. \n \n \nOrganizational Work Force \n \nObservable differences exist between the private and public prison \nworkforce, and the two can be compared in several ways.  In both the private \nand public sectors, program opportunities have been developed, providing \ninmates with treatment, education, work and leisure time activities.  Specially-\ntrained and credentialed staff are responsible for implementing and managing \nsuch programs. Operational support from food service, clinical services and \ncase management are provided by employees trained in correctional security \nand other fields germane to their duties and responsibilities.  However, unlike \nemployees at private prisons, alignment of the Colorado Department of \nCorrections’ staff is designed and structured with positions defined by the \nclassification system of Department of Personnel and Administration.  Private \nprison staff are generally “at-will”, hourly employees, and company policies \ndictate operational decision-making nation-wide.   \n \n  While searching, screening and hiring qualified staff is challenging in \nboth the private and public sectors, the staff attrition rate at CCA in Colorado \nis double that of staff employed by the Colorado Department of Corrections, \nthus making it more difficult to establish long held traditions or utilize the \nbenefit of experienced staff.  For example, years of policy development, \npractice and understanding the changing dynamics of a prison’s population \nhave created a culture where the mission is readily understood in publicly-\noperated institutions.  To that end, it is not unusual for CDOC staff to spend \nyears serving in volunteer capacities with specialized response units; i.e., \nEscape Teams, Tracking, Emergency Response Teams (ERT) and Special \nOperations Response Teams (SORT).  Regularly scheduled training affords \nthese groups with the confidence needed to mobilize swiftly and perform as \nneeded. Over time, a sense of “community” has evolved, statewide, where \nprofessional relationships have developed regarding all matters of offender \n1 0 \n \n\n \nmanagement.  For their part, offenders know that attempts to defeat security \nwill be summarily thwarted by a confident and experienced staff. However, \nthis sense of preparedness is more difficult to achieve among private prisons.   \n \n \nColorado Private Prison Operators \n \nAt present, Corrections Corporation of America operates four facilities \nin Colorado:  Crowley County Correctional Facility, Bent County \nCorrectional Facility, Kit Carson Correctional Center and Huerfano County \nCorrectional Center.  In addition, GRW Corporation owns and operates an \nadult female facility at Brush.  Besides housing Colorado inmates, the states \nof Washington, Wyoming and Hawaii have contracted for bed space in some \nof these facilities.   \n \n \nHousing Out of State Inmates in Colorado’s  \nPrivate Prisons \n \nPrivate prison operators assume a substantial investment when the \ndecision is made to site a facility in Colorado. Costs associated with \nconstruction, utility plant upgrades, and other infrastructure improvements are \nsizable, but are intended to be recovered when daily bed capacity is attained. \nKeeping beds filled is essential to realizing the full return on investment.  \nTherefore, when other states reach their own capacity and seek bed space \nelsewhere, it is not uncommon for CDOC offenders being housed in private \ncorrections institutions to share facility space with other states’ inmates.  \nThrough the authority of CDOC’s Executive Director (CRS 17.1.104.5), the \nPrivate Prisons Monitoring Unit reviews inmate files for suitability and \nappropriateness of placement, prior to inmates’ being transferred to Colorado.  \nIndividual states vary with regard to the daily rate being paid to the private \noperator or other conditions established in their contracts. \n \n \nPrivate Prisons Monitoring Unit (PPMU) \n \nPer CRS 17-1-202(1) (a) (III) (g):  The Executive Director of the \nColorado Department of Corrections shall monitor the contracted private \ncorrectional facilities.   Until the passage of HB04-1419, all operating \nexpenses and personal services to monitor the private facilities were \n1 1 \n \n\n \nreimbursed quarterly by the contracted entities.  Today, however, the PPMU \nis General Funded and the daily rate to counties and cities has been reduced \naccordingly.  The purpose of the PPMU is to monitor and provide oversight of \nprivate facilities and their operations.  Per CRS 17-1-202 (1) (a) (III) (f):  The \ncontractor shall be responsible for a range of services and programs at least \nequal to those services and programs provided by the CDOC at comparable \nstate correctional facilities.  Site visits are conducted on a regular basis to \nmonitor consistency with CDOC in such areas as the following: \n \n•  Facility and Contract Oversight \n•  Selective Training for Private Prison Staff \n•  Security Audits \n•  Case Management Oversight \n•  Mental Health Treatment Program Reviews \n•  Medical and Dental Oversight \n•  Security Threat Group Monitoring \n•  Drug Interdiction \n•  Food Service Monitoring \n•  Program Reviews for Education and Treatment \n•  Inmate Banking \n•  Background Checks for Visitors \n \nThe PPMU recognizes that tracking and follow-up to these areas are \nessential in order to manage small issues before they develop into larger, \nsecurity-related problems.  Therefore, monitor-observed deficiencies are \ndocumented, brought to the attention of the institution’s management, and, \nwhere appropriate, to the contractor. Ideally, a cooperative remedy is \ndiscussed and agreed upon. The relationship between the Colorado \nDepartment of Corrections and the private prisons is mutually beneficial only \nwhen the latter fulfill the terms and conditions of the contract.  When contract \ndeficiencies are noted, however, and the private prison delays in the \nimplementation of needed corrections, PPMU staff are obligated to document \nand report to the CDOC Executive Staff.   \n \nThe practice of monitoring and evaluating conditions of confinement \nfor CDOC inmates housed in private facilities is critical for the ongoing \ncontractual relationship to be successful.  This relationship has been impeded \nby lack of responsiveness by private prison operators to issues identified for \nimprovement by PPMU staff.  For example, failure of private prison staff to \ndemonstrate a fundamental knowledge of appropriate policy and procedures is \n1 2 \n \n\n \none of the most frustrating issues.  Attention to physical plant repairs, kitchen \ncleanliness, menu and food portions, medical staffing and services, as well as \nbasic security practices are of such importance that, when ignored, these \nconcerns can quickly escalate and eventually impact the safety and security of \nthe entire facility.  At present, there are few mechanisms in place for holding \nprivate operators or contractors accountable when deficiencies are delayed or \nnever corrected.     \n \n \nth\nPart II:  Events Prior to the July 20  Incident \n \nReports From Staff and Inmates \n \nIn any prison riot, it can be difficult to distinguish valid warning signs \nfrom false ones.  In this case, some factors have emerged, linking conditions \nfor the time period prior to the incident with the actual disturbance.  During \nthe days prior to July 20, 2004, 198 inmates from the state of Washington \nwere moved to the Crowley Facility.  They, along with 116 inmates from \nWyoming and 807 Colorado inmates, brought the facility’s total population to \n1,130.  The investigation conducted by the CDOC Office of Inspector \nGeneral, indicates that the inmates were angry over real or perceived inequity \nof treatment.  For example, the amount of inmate wages paid by each state per \nmonth for similar inmate work assignments is different, ranging from $60.00 \npaid to Washington and Wyoming inmates, while Colorado pays $18.60 per \nmonth.  Colorado requires it’s inmates to contribute each month to \ncourt/victims’ restitution owed, child support and medical appointment co-\npayments.  Buying power is strongest, therefore, among Washington and \nWyoming inmates.  The CDOC Inspector General concluded that resentment \ndeveloped over this difference.   \n   \nOther complaints have become known as a result of the ongoing \ninvestigation:   \n \n•  Several inmates alleged that two instances of misuse of force by \nCrowley County Correctional (CCCF) staff occurred.  \n•  Inmates’ complaints and criticisms about food quality and quantity \nwere allegedly ignored by the food service manager. \n•  Inmates’ perception that an alleged conflict of interest exists between \ncanteen operations and food service operations as Canteen Corporation \nowns and operates both. \n1 3 \n \n\n \n•  Inmates’ allegations of treatment disparity between Colorado inmates \nand Washington inmates regarding allowable property and food \nportions. \n•  Inmates’ allegations that administration failed to listen or acknowledge \ninmate complaints. \n•  Inmates’ allegations that on the day of the riot, facility administration \nignored requests to discuss issues and grievances. \n•  CCCF staff’s and inmates’ perception that facility administration had \nprior warnings or knowledge of a potential riot; information may have \nbeen provided in staff reports and inmate letters and memos from \ninmates to staff.  \n•  CCCF staff’s and inmates’ perception that too many new, untrained \nfacility staff were assigned to key posts. \n•  CCCF staff’s perception that there were too few resources to manage \nthe riot. \n•  CCCF staff’s perception that the facility was understaffed on the night \nof the riot. \n \nThese complaints, leading to continued and progressive frustrations among \nthe population, were reportedly aired to line staff and administration in the \ndays prior to the actual riot.  \n \nIn addition to complaints, the investigation has revealed that three CCCF \nstaff members submitted reports to CCCF Supervisory Staff noting possible \ntrouble forthcoming from inmates.  The first report, dated May 15, 2004, \nindicated that a Wyoming inmate made veiled threats during an altercation \nwith staff saying that he would “make his point on July 5.”  (July 5, 2004 was \nthe designated time frame for a second group of Washington inmates to arrive \nat CCCF) \n \n  The second report is dated July 5, 2004.  An inmate, who asked not to \nbe identified, communicated to staff that Washington inmates planned to take \nan officer hostage. The third report submitted from staff (no date) indicated \nthat the reporting officer had overheard inmates talk about “getting even” with \nthe people who hurt another inmate on the East Yard basketball court.  \nAccording to the staff member, inmates said they would “fight it out” in Unit \nC.   \n \nIt is unknown what action was taken by CCA to follow-up on any of these \nreports.  \n1 4 \n \n\n \nRecent PPMU Visits \n \nSite visit reports for the six month period prior to the disturbance \nindicate that monitors noted and communicated a number of concerns to \nfacility management.  The following is a partial list of issues:   \n \n•  Food quality and quantity \n•  Inconsistency in completing required forms for reportable incidents \n•  Training for food service staff in the preparation of medical and \nreligious diets \n•  Emergency plans compliance \n•  Emergency Response Teams staffing and training \n•  Use of ambulance and emergency room services for routine medical \ncare \n•  Pharmaceutical management \n•  Mental health and medical treatment staff ratios \n•  Tracking Security Threat Group intelligence \n•  Timeliness of gang activity report filings   \n•  Staff termination reports \n•  Investigations and Code of Penal Discipline Reports  \n•  Accuracy of Quarterly Reports \n•  Canteen pricing structure and items sold \n•  Inmate telephone services contract  \n•  Case manager attrition since January, 2004 \n•  Escape team training  \n•  Facility organization charts  \n•  Inmate grievance process  \n•  Inmate banking account activity and records \n•  Inmate access to computers in food service area  \n•  Other recent audits include:   \n \n(cid:190)  June 30, 2004  Monthly security inspection \n(cid:190)  March 30, 2004  Quarterly key inventory/inspection \n(cid:190)  April 4, 2004  Quarterly tool inventory \n \n \n1 5 \n \n\n \n(cid:190)  January 12, 2004  Evaluation of communications equipment \n(cid:190)  July 23, 2003  Crowley County Commissioners approved                             \n                                    CCCF’s Emergency Plan \n \nOn July 9, 2004, a CDOC monitor visited the Crowley facility.  The \nreport, filed, July 13, noted that offender morale appeared to be “low” with \nregard to food quality, and inmates complained of not earning enough money \nto purchase needed canteen items. \n \n \nCrowley’s Level of Emergency Preparedness \n \nBesides reports analyzed from staff, inmates and monitors, regarding \nthe Crowley riot, a review of recent security systems inspections, staffing \nmatters and frequency of emergency activation drills is also important.  While \nthese areas of concern may not have directly impacted the start of the \ndisturbance, the ability to gain control of the situation may have been \nhampered by the breakdown of any or all of these essential operational \nelements of the institution.  The following information is known about the \nstatus of the facility’s emergency preparedness, prior to July 20, 2004. \n \nStaffing Complement:   Not fully staffed; new employees on the job for two \ndays or less when riot erupted. \nEmergency Plan:  Failed to achieve contract compliance in the area of \ndeveloping an emergency plan consistent with \nCDOC Administrative Regulation 300-30RD, \nmaking mutual response more complicated. \nEmergency Response    Failed to maintain a recommended percentage of  \nTeams:  emergency response team members (5% of offender \npopulation) \nArmory Practices:  Failed to gain compliance in the area of armory \nmanagement and practices.   \nBarber Tool Control:  The facility recently moved the Barber Shops into \nthe Living Units.  (This practice contributed to the \nloss of Class A tools during the riot.) \nEmergency Activation  Rarely conducted.   \nDrills  For example, on one occasion, an inmate was \nutilized to participate in an emergency drill, causing \na staff member, unaware the exercise was in \nprogress, to draw a weapon on him. \n1 6 \n \n\n \nTraining:  Training was provided for 7 staff members on the \ntopic of munitions and crowd control on April 29, \n2004.  On May 27, 2004, 6 staff received other \nspecialized training, and on June 3, 2004, 11 staff \ncompleted firearms requalifications. \n    \n \nPart III:  Incident Summary \n \nChronological Order and Narration of Events \n   \nNote Physical Plant Layout:  The physical plant layout of the Crowley \nCounty Correctional Facility runs from east to west with the main entry and \nAdministration Offices (Building A) being in the center of the facility on the \nnorth side perimeter.  Living Units 1 and 2 are located on the west side of the \nbaseball field with access to the programs areas located on the south side of \nthe facility.  A security fence separates the west side from the east and \nincludes Living Units 3 and 4.  The east side also includes a large exercise \nyard, basketball court and weight pile.  Living Unit 6, located on the west side \nwas recently constructed, and, at the time of the riot was occupied by \nWashington inmates. Unit 6 lies outside the main complex on the southwest \nside, separated by security fences from the main facility compound.

This response occurred as a \nresult of a reported inmate uprising/riot at CCCF.  Initial reports indicated that \nthe facility was at risk of being overrun by rioting inmates.  Per CRS 17-\n103.8, the Office of the Inspector General is the appropriate law enforcement \nauthority to investigate criminal matters, use of force and any contributing \nfactors that may have caused such a disturbance.  This authority extends not \nonly to CDOC facilities, but also to privately owned and operated correctional \ninstitutions that house CDOC inmates. \n \n  At approximately 9:30 P.M., investigators arrived at CCCF and \nconfirmed that the facility’s external perimeter was being secured by the \nCrowley County Sheriff’s Office, Pueblo County Sheriff’s Office, Colorado \nState Patrol and other local law enforcement agencies.  After a briefing from \nBrent Crouse, CCCF Warden, and PPMU staff on site, investigators \ndetermined that the entire facility was at risk of being overrun by rioting \ninmates. Living units, with the exception of Unit 6, had been taken over by \ninmates and institutional property destroyed and burned.  Inmates were in \n5 8 \n \n\n \ncontrol of yards and had access to program areas.  They destroyed and burned \nthe Greenhouse and were threatening G-Building, a trades program area.  \nSeveral other fires burned outside living units, and the Administration \nBuilding was at risk.  It was reported that no inmates had breached the \nexternal security fences. \n \n \nStaff Accountability \n \nInvestigators were advised by CCCF administration that all staff had \nbeen previously accounted for between 8:30-9:00 P.M, and that all staff had \nbeen evacuated from the yards and living units.  It was later determined, \nhowever, when two CCCF officers in Unit 2 were rescued by CCCF’s SORT \nteam members, that the staff accountability reports were incorrect.   When the \ndisturbance began, the two officers fled to an empty segregation cell and \nlocked themselves in.  Further, during the early morning hours of July 21, a \nstaff librarian was discovered, along with 37 inmates, in the facility’s library, \nand she was subsequently escorted to safety.  The whereabouts of these staff \nmembers was never communicated to investigators, since the facility’s \nadministration believed all staff had been accounted for.   \n \n \nThe Onset of the Riot \n \n  The investigation has revealed the incident began at approximately 7:30 \nP.M., after a group of inmates in the West Yard demanded an audience with \nthe warden concerning their complaints.  Inmates making the demands were \nconfronted by the Shift Commander, a captain who denied their demands to \ntalk with the warden, but reportedly attempted to engage the group’s leader in \ndiscussion of the demands.  It was reported that the Shift Commander was \nunsuccessful in attempts to find a spokesman for the group, and the group \nbecame threatening towards the Shift Commander and other officers present.  \nStaff retreated from the yard for their own safety.  At the Shift Commander’s \ndirection, a public address system announcement was made, giving an order to \nall inmates in the yard to disperse and return to their living units, and that the \nyard was closed.  The inmates became unruly, started to become hostile and \nrefused to comply with directives.  At that time, the order was given for living \nunits to lock their doors, and staff were told to prepare for an emergency \nevacuation of their posts.  Inmates became bolder, began to damage property, \nincited other inmates to riot and threatened to breach living units’ security \ndoors.  Staff were then ordered to abandon their posts in the interest of safety. \n5 9 \n \n\n \nOnce officers evacuated yards and living units, inmates realized their conduct \nwas going unchecked, and  there was no officer presence to prevent them \nfrom engaging in more criminal misconduct.  They became more belligerent \nand aggressive. \n \n  The CDOC investigation has concluded that Washington inmates \nplayed a major role in instigating and initiating the riot.  Reports indicate they \nbecame disruptive in retaliation for a use of force on a Washington inmate by \nCCCF staff earlier in the day. The investigation has further revealed that \nWashington inmates were the first to remove weight equipment and start \nutilizing dumbbells and 45 pound weight bars to damage property.  A video \ntape observation indicates that a Washington inmate, identified as the leader \nof other Washington inmates, was the first to start breaking windows and \npounding on the door of Living Unit 2.  He instructed other inmates to break \ninto the Segregation Unit and release the inmate earlier involved in the use of \nforce incident.  This was accomplished with weight bars being passed through \nthe cell door’s broken window, allowing the inmate the use of the weight bar \nto defeat the door from within.  Using this method, inmates were able to \ndestroy additional doors and locking mechanisms in not only the segregation \nareas of the facilities, but throughout. \n \n  Colorado and Wyoming inmates became principals in the riot when \nthey took immediate advantage of the situation and aggressively began \nparticipating.  They also destroyed equipment, furnishings and used weight \nequipment to break through cell doors and locks.  Case Management offices \nwere broken into and inmate files rifled, in order to identify files belonging to \nsex offenders and informants.  These inmates were targeted in later assaults \nthe same night.   \n \n  At this writing, there is no clear indication that the riot involved a \ndispute among Security Threat Groups (STG).  If anything, it has become \nevident from inmate interviews and an analysis of posted STG graffiti written \non walls during the riot that STG groups banded together and acted in concert \nwith each other.  The only indications of STG related incidents were the \nassaults on two inmates, with evidence that two Security Threat groups \ncarried out those assaults.   \n \n \nDamage \n \n6 0 \n \n\n \n  Eventually, inmates caused extensive damage to Living Units 1 and 2 \nwith some damage to Units 3 and 4.  Case management offices were \ncompromised and inmate files accessed.  Windows were broken and living \nunit Control Centers were breached.  Inmates destroyed porcelain toilets and \nsinks, as well as sprinkler systems.  Consequently, water lines were broken \nand flooding occurred.  Toilet flush valves were tied down to cause continual \nflushing.  Day Hall televisions were destroyed, as well as vending machines, \nclothes washers, dryers and microwave ovens.  Most of these items were \ndragged outside, stuffed with flammable materials and set on fire. \n \n  Ultimately, inmates were able to defeat Control Centers in every Living \nUnit.  Locking mechanisms were destroyed, windows broken and electronic \ncontrol panels were smashed.  As Control Center staff realized that inmate \naccess was imminent, they escaped by way of an overhead hatch.  However, \naccording to witness statements, staff were unable to secure the hatch locks \nbehind them, thus permitting inmates to follow, gaining access to the roof.  \nThe subsequent investigation indicates that no chemicals or munitions were \navailable to staff to defend the Control Centers against the advancing inmates.  \n \n  The Greenhouse was vandalized and completely burned after inmates \nbreached a security fence behind Living Unit 1.  Inmates also reached the \nprograms building area, Building B, but were not successful in breaching the \nbuilding.  They did access Building G, housing the furniture shop and Habitat \nfor Humanity, but did little damage to these structures, other than possibly \nremoving tools.  They did attempt to ignite a fire in this area, however, it was \nstarted under the sprinkling system and was quickly extinguished.   \n \n \nTelephones \n \n  From the start of the riot, until approximately 10:00 P.M., inmates used \nthe telephones to call friends, families and members of the media.  \nConsequently, taped recordings of phone calls have led to the identification of \nat least 40-60 criminal suspects and riot participants.  During these calls, \ninmates admitted to their own participation in the uprising and implicated \nothers.  Media began calling facility administration to confirm the inmates’ \nreports of the riot. \n \n \nInmate Assaults \n \n6 1 \n \n\n \nDuring the destruction of Living Units 1 and 2, inmates rifled through \ncase manager records, looking for files of other inmates considered to be \npolice informants or those identified as sex offenders.  Those inmates \nidentified by the rioters as either informants or sex offenders were targeted for \nassault.  Two known assaults were perpetrated by bands of roving inmates \nwithin Living Units 1 and 2.   \n \nThe first and most serious assault occurred when an inmate in Unit 1 \nwas attacked by a group of inmates.  The inmate was secured in his cell; \nhowever, other inmates rammed his door with weight bars and set the wooden \ndoor on fire.  Once the door had been defeated, perpetrators stabbed the \ninmate, struck him with weight bars, beat him and threw him off the second \ntier of the living unit.  Inmates accosted the severely injured inmate again \nwhile he lay on the first floor and struck him on the head with a microwave \noven, leaving him for dead.  Later, the severely injured inmate was discovered \nby response team members while retaking control of Living Unit 1.  He was \nlater airlifted to Pueblo for hospital treatment. \n \nThe second serious assault occurred in Unit 2.  Rioting inmates broke \nthrough a segregation cell, occupied by this inmate.  He was dragged from the \ncell and beaten.  Attacking inmates attempted to stab him repeatedly until the \nblade of the weapon was bent.  The inmate was later rescued and treated by a \nCCCF physicians’ assistant.  However, his name was omitted from the list of \ninjured inmates who had been victims of assault, and he was subsequently \nmoved the following day to the Park County Jail.  This injured inmate \nreported the assault to Park County staff.   \n \nDuring additional interviews conducted by investigators, inmates \ncomplained of injuries received from birdshot and rubber bullets, fired by \nofficers attempting to regain control of the facility.   \n \n \nResponse to the Riot \n \nIt became apparent to responding CDOC Investigators and the CDOC \nSORT Commander arriving on scene that a quicker and stronger response by \nthe facility security staff at the initial onset of the riot would have limited the \nextent of the riot.  Investigators believe that the lack of response was due to \nindecisive command level decision making or inadequate staffing and \nresources, or both.  The facility’s command staff either could not or would not \ndeal with the situation at its inception.  Further, reports indicate that the \n6 2 \n \n\n \nfacility’s SORT team was told to “stand down” until Colorado’s Department \nof Corrections’ SORT team arrived.  The facility’s emergency response team \nhad been disbanded and was only recently reinstated, thus indicating lack of \ntraining for response to an incident of this magnitude.   \n \n  Once notified, CDOC staff and units responded to the site and provided \nassistance in a variety of ways: \n1.  The Emergency Support Center was activated at the CDOC \nHeadquarters Building, Colorado Springs.  Personnel provided \nassistance and developed a plan to move inmates from CCCF. \n2.  The Emergency Mobile Command Center was deployed from Canon \nCity and remained onsite, utilized as a communications hub; staff \ncontrolled access and egress to the riot scene. \n3.  Escape Team personnel and K-9 Units conducted a sweep of the \nperimeter to ensure no inmates had escaped.  K-9’s were used for \nadditional crowd control. \n4.  Training Academy staff transported multiple sets of hard restraints, 2 \nshields and 22 cases of less lethal ammunition to CCCF. \n5.  The Public Information Officer established a staging area for news \nmedia outside the facility and released updated status reports over the \nnext twenty-four hours.  The PIO also arranged for a late morning press \nconference/briefing by the CDOC Executive Director, July 21.  \nPreparations were coordinated for an on-site tour and press conference \nby Governor Bill Owens, scheduled for 2:00 P.M. the same day. \n6.  The Legislative Liaison provided facility escort for arriving CDOC \nmedical staff to the triage area, communicated with the Mobile \nCommand Center, assisted with yard supervision and responded to \nincoming legislative inquiries. \n7.  Staff from Business Technologies maintained digital radio \ncommunications equipment and provided ongoing assistance with \ntelephones, computers, internet and satellite connections and were at \nCDOC Headquarters for Web page updates. \n8.  The Executive Director, Director of Prisons, Director of Administration \nand Finance assisted prior to arrival on site and provided direction \nregarding use of chemical agents and other strategies to quell the riot.  \nFurther, they provided command management regarding building \nsweeps, detainment and control of inmates, yard supervision and \nemergency food service operations. Coordination and planning with the \nSORT Commander was ongoing over the next 24 hours. \n9.  Facility Emergency Response Teams from Arkansas Valley, Fort Lyon, \nSan Carlos and Trinidad Correctional Facilities reported to the SORT \n6 3 \n \n\n \nCommander, along with staff from the Youthful Offender System \n(YOS) and Pueblo Minimum Center and some off-duty staff who reside \nin the Colorado Springs area. These teams were instrumental in \nproviding assistance during the riot and regaining control of the facility. \n10. YOS management team developed a plan to receive inmates from \nCCCF and provide appropriate services. \n11. Central Transport Unit was alerted that inmates would be moved to \navailable beds throughout the state. \n12. The Inspector General and staff provided assistance during and after the \nriot, identified potential crime scenes, began to conduct investigations \nand have since assimilated over 1,400 interview documents related to \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this incident. \n \nAt approximately 1:00 A.M., on July 21, 2004, the riot was brought under \ncontrol and the process of restoring order began.  Inmates were restrained and \nstaged in exercise yards.  A process for medical triage was and treatment was \nestablished.   \n \n \nCriminal Charges \n \nAt this writing, there is an ongoing investigation to determine the filing \nof criminal cases.  Conservatively, over 100 inmates have been identified as \nengaging in criminal activity, and 100 or more Disciplinary or Administrative \nactions may be pursued against inmate suspects.  The Office of the Inspector \nGeneral reports that additional criminal related incidents may include the \nfollowing: \n1.  Attempted Homicide of at least one inmate. \n2.  Inmates inciting and engaging in large scale riot activity. \n3.  Large scale Criminal Mischief with major property damage. \n4.  Assaults on inmates by inmates. \n5.  Assaults or attempted assaults on staff by inmates.  \n6.  Burglary of Case Management offices and destruction of records and \nfiles. \n7.  Burglary of Living Unit Control Centers and destruction therein. \n8.  Arson and attempted burning of Living Units. \n9.  Arson of the Greenhouse. \n10. Burglary of Programs Area, Building G. \n11. Accosting and robbing two civilian electrical contractors of their tool \nbelts containing screw drivers and wire cutters, instruments which \ncould aid in a potential escape. \n6 4 \n \n\n \n \n \nPart IV:  Conclusions and Recommendations \n \nConclusions \n \n  After any prison disturbance, hindsight is useful for drawing \nconclusions about missed operational opportunities.  Every attempt should be \nmade to analyze the causes of the riot, its human and financial impact and \naddress steps needed to make appropriate improvements.   \n \n  After a comprehensive review of the July 20 inmate riot, the Colorado \nDepartment of Corrections concludes the following:  \n \n•  CCCF management has failed to comply in a timely manner with \nPPMU-noted deficiencies/recommendations.   \n•  High staff attrition rate and inexperience has contributed to lack of \nability to appropriately respond to emergencies. At this writing, 37 \nCCCF staff members have resigned or been terminated since the \nincident. \n•  Responsiveness to inmates’ food service complaints has been delayed. \nThere has been a failure to adhere to CDOC mandated menu items.  \n•  Fundamental security measures have not been consistently followed. \n•  Facility emergency plan has not been effective. \n•  Inmate living unit construction materials have proven to be easily \ndestroyed.  \n•  CCCF’s initial response to the incident was indecisive.   \n•  The riot and subsequent damage to CCCF has caused a disruption of \ndaily inmate intake into the Reception and Diagnostic Center resulting \nin an increase in jail backlog.  The impact of the incident to normal \noperations of population management has been enormous.  Inmate \nmovement back into CCCF by CDOC has ceased to date.  \n \n \nRecommendations \n   \n  The following recommendations are being made as a result of this \nreport:  \n  \n6 5 \n \n\n \n•  Update facility emergency procedures and schedule training drills on a \nfrequent basis, utilizing corporate resources; conduct necessary out \nbriefings and implement corrections.   \n•  Ensure command structure is well-defined with clear lines of authority \nand responsibility and organizational chart updated. \n•  CCA should consider granting more authority to CCCF’s on site \ncommand staff in emergency situations. \n•  Conduct frequent staff and inmate accountability exercises with and \nwithout observation from PPMU staff.  Conduct needed out briefings \nand implement corrections. \n•  Increase the level and frequency of communications with corporate \nofficials when corrective measures, indicated by PPMU, are not \nimplemented in a timely manner at the local level. \n•  Increase notification and level of accountability among county \ncommissioners and city administrators to the Department of Corrections \nfor private prison operational deficiencies, when noted by PPMU. \n•  Increase the level of oversight by County Commissioners and city \nadministrators for private prison operations. \n•  Review and update memorandums of understanding with county and \ncity officials and local law enforcement. \n•  Practice mobilization of emergency command center at various times, \nduring all shifts. \n•  Review CCCF’s staffing complements for emergency response teams \nand inventory equipment and supplies; ensure use of force training \nrecords are current and updated as needed. \n•  Conduct tool and key control audits to CDOC specification. \n•  Respond to inmate complaints in a timely manner. \n•  Consider a change in the food service contractor; ensure food service \nstaff are trained in the preparation of medical and religious diets. \n•  Provide CCCF staff with use of force and tactical training. \n•  Provide CCCF staff with hazardous materials and blood spill cleanup \ntraining \n•  Review security procedures regarding recreational use of weights. \n•  Replace current wooden doors and porcelain plumbing fixtures and \nlocking mechanisms. \n•  Implement a method for improved security of inmate files.  \n•  Create mechanism to address issues of CCCF staff morale. \n•  Conduct regularly scheduled inspections of living unit control center \nescape hatch. \n6 6 \n \n\n \n•  Ensure only trained and credentialed armorer is authorized to issue \nweapons and munitions. \n•  Maintain a list of contingent contract providers should additional or \nalternate bed space needs arise.  \n•  Request the Colorado Legislature for additional full time employees for \nthe CDOC Private Prisons Monitoring Unit.  \n•  Request the Colorado Legislature to authorize the CDOC Executive \nDirector to take command and compel compliance with recommended \npolicy and procedure in non-emergency situations. \n•  Report to PPMU all instances of shift staffing shortages. \n•  Conduct appropriate investigations, prior to inmate COPD hearings \ntaking place. \n  \n \nAbout Emergency Preparedness \n \nUnexpected occurrences, acts of God, and a variety of other anomalies \ncan disturb a correctional facility at any time and pose a threat to security.  \nContingency plans must be developed, training conducted and plans \nimplemented when needed.  Inmate disturbances are one of the most serious \nof these unplanned events.  Appropriately responding to such emergencies and \ntaking control of a potentially volatile situation comes with practice.  In all \ncases, inmates far outnumber staff; therefore, strategies should be developed \nto mobilize the work force in such a way as to firmly and aggressively take \ncontrol of a situation using the least amount of force necessary.  Confidence \nabout what to do and how to execute an emergency plan is possible only after \ntraining, an updated review of procedures and re-training.  An arsenal of \nspecialized equipment and other supplies should be pre-positioned.  \nCommunication systems must be tested and utilized, and leadership during \nsuch an emergency well established.  All the preparation in the world, \nhowever, means nothing if the plan is not implemented, or when employees \nfail to execute their roles, accordingly.   \n \nIn either state or privately operated prisons, complacency is the enemy. \nInmates capitalize on their observation of staff taking shortcuts and exploit \nweaknesses whenever possible.  Failure to recognize or report unusual inmate \nbehaviors may ultimately lead to a disruption within the institution.  Often, \nstaff place little importance on individual observations; and, while it is true \nthat separately some reports lack significance, collectively, they may be of \ngreat use.  When patterns emerge and are investigated, disturbances may be \n6 7 \n \n\n \nprevented.  The ability to respond to emergencies is often hindered, therefore, \nnot by a desire to perform, but due to inexperience and lack of practice. In \nshort, proactive planning and reactive problem-solving are essential.   \n \nA thorough after action review of any facility emergency is important \nin order to recognize systems that functioned well and those that need \nimprovement.  This review process has provided CDOC with the opportunity \nto examine internal Private Prisons Monitoring Unit practices, and the Unit \nlooks forward to identifying ways to increase effectiveness.  For example, it \nhas become evident that the PPMU needs to involve and communicate with \nthe contracting city and county officials to obtain compliance and correct \ndeficiencies noted when they are conducting inspections.  While not every \nemergency can be prepared for, common procedures for responding to any \nemergency, can, never the less, be practiced.  Since staff from all operational \nand program areas will likely be utilized during an actual riot, such as \ndescribed in this report, frequent rehearsal is necessary with everyone in the \nfacility participating.  Correctional agencies should also account for staff \nattrition and retrain in emergency procedures as needed. \n \nOn the night of the incident, there were many CCCF staff who \nresponded appropriately and performed well.  Local fire protection units, \npolice and sheriff’s officers, state patrol and others were quick to initiate \nmeasures to ensure the public’s safety was never compromised.  After the \nfacility’s order was restored, countless hours have been spent in reviewing the \nlevels of response and discussing ways to improve processes in the future.  \n \nThe prison riot of July 20, 2004, at the Crowley County Correctional \nFacility began with a disturbance which, in retrospect, was not responded to \nas quickly and effectively as possible, thus developing into a riot.  Some \ndynamics among the inmate population, perception that inmate complaints \nwere not being heard and use of force by CCCF staff likely all contributed to \nthe onset of the incident.  This report was an attempt to summarize the events \nand provide recommendations for improvement in order to mitigate such \noccurrences in the future.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6 8 \n \n\n \nAppendices  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6 9 \n \n\nAppendices:                Page: \n \n  Photos:                  70 – 89 \n   \nIntergovernmental Contract – State of Colorado      90– 176 \nand the Colorado Department of Corrections and \nCrowley County and Exhibits            \n   \nCrowley County Correctional Facility Riot Response    177 \nExpenses to be Reimbursed \n \nGlossary                   178 \n \n                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \nUnit I:  Inmates set fires to wooden cell doors. \n \n7 0 \n \n\n \n \nDebris resulting from fires set to washing machines, vending machines, \nclothing and files. \n \n \nHousing Unit Control Center:  Inmates used weights to break windows \nand destroy locking mechanisms to access control centers and electronic \npanels.\n \n7 1 \n \n\n \n \nUnit 1:  Inmates damaged air handling units after accessing roof \nthrough escape hatch, above control center. \n \n \nUnit 1:  Fire damage \n7 2 \n \n\n \n \nUnit 1:  Fire Damage \n \n \nHousing Unit 1:  Roof and fire damage   \n7 3 \n \n\n \n \nHousing Unit:  Day Hall flooding and debris \n \n \nUnit 3:  Debris at housing unit’s entrance \n7 4 \n \n\n \n \nLocking mechanism destroyed by weight bar \n \n \nHousing Unit 4:  Burned debris \n7 5 \n \n\n \n \nHousing Unit:  Inmates moved and destroyed institution property, files \nand clothing to outside entrance of cell house. \n \n \nDefeated locking mechanism \n7 6 \n \n\n \n \nHousing Unit:  Damage to sheetrock and flooding \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7 7 \n \n\n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7 8 \n \n\n \n \nHousing Unit:  Flooding of Day Hall area near entrance \n \n \nHousing Unit Control Center:  Inmates gained access and damaged \nsprinkler systems, control panel and windows overlooking unit. \n \n7 9 \n \n\n \n \nHousing Unit:  Shattered windows overlooking cells \n \n \nHousing Unit Control Center:  Electronic panel destroyed \n \n8 0 \n \n\n \n \nHousing Unit:  Destruction of porcelain fixtures \n \n \nHousing Unit Day Hall Area:  Washer and dryer removed  \n \n8 1 \n \n\n \n \nHousing Unit:  Case Managers’ file cabinets and inmate records \ndestroyed \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8 2 \n \n\n \n \nHousing Unit:  Inmates used weight bars and clothing irons to destroy \nsheetrock \n \n \nHousing Unit Control Center:  Windows broken by inmates throwing \nprojectiles \n \n8 3 \n \n\n \n \nSegregation Unit:  Cell damage and flooding \n \n8 4 \n \n\n \n \nSegregation Housing Unit:  Door damage, day room and cell flooding \n \n \nSegregation Unit:  Cell door compromised, porcelain fixtures destroyed;

      "text": "Abrahamson v. Corrections Corp. of America, 2007 WL 5210192 (2007)   \n \n \n \n \n2007 WL 5210192 (Colo.Dist.Ct.) (Trial Order) \nDistrict Court of Colorado. \nCrowley County \nJason M. ABRAHAMSON, et. al., Plaintiffs, \nv. \nCORRECTIONS CORPORATION OF AMERICA, et. al., Defendants. \nNo. 2006 CV 8. \nMarch 6, 2007. \nDiv.: B \nOrder \nMichael Schiferl, Judge. \nThis matter is before the Court upon a motion of the Defendants to dismiss the Plaintiff’s complaint. The Defendants urge \ndismissal as a result of three arguments: 1.) Failure to exhaust remedies (C.R.S. 13-17.5-102.3); 2.) Failure to allege any \nactual or compensatory injury; and 3.) Premature allegation of punitive damages (C.R.S. 13-21-102(1.5)(a)). \n  \nThe Plaintiffs have responded to this motion and the Court orders as follows: FAILURE TO EXHAUST REMEDIES \n  \nThe center of this issue is an interpretation of C.R.S. 13-17.5-103.3. That statute states in part the following: \n(1) No inmate shall bring a civil action based upon prison conditions under any statute or constitutional \nprovision until all available administrative remedies have been exhausted in a timely fashion by the entity \noperating the detaining facility and inmate. For purposes of this subsection (1), an inmate shall be \nconsidered to have exhausted all available administrative remedies when the inmate has completed the \nlast step in the inmate grievance process as set forth in the regulations promulgated by the entity \noperating the detaining facility. Failure to allege in the civil action that all available administrative \nremedies have been exhausted in accordance with this subsection (1) shall result in dismissal of the civil \naction. \n  \n  \nThere is only one appellate court case that has touched upon interpretation of this statute and that is Glover v. State, 129 P.3d \n1083 (Colo.App.2005). In that case the Colorado Court of Appeals had an inmate who was suing the State of Colorado \nbecause he alleged that they had hooked him on cigarettes and he wanted damages as well as injunctive relief. \n  \nThe Court of Appeals held the following: \nWhen administrative remedies are provided by statute or ordinance, in order for a court to allow relief, \nthe  procedure  outlined  must  be  followed  if  the  contested  matter  is  within  the  jurisdiction  of  the \nadministrative authority. Horrell v. Dep’t of Admin., 861 P.2d 1194, 1197 (Colo.1993). This requirement \nallows the agency with expertise in a particular subject matter to develop the necessary factual record on \nwhich the agency and reviewing courts may base their decisions. City & County of Denver v. United Air \nLines, Inc., 8 P.3d 1206 (Colo.2000). It also promotes efficiency by preventing the interruption and \nfragmentation of the administrative process and conserves judicial resources by ensuring that courts \nintervene only if the administrative process fails to provide adequate remedies. City & County of Denver \n  1 \n\nAbrahamson v. Corrections Corp. of America, 2007 WL 5210192 (2007)   \n \n \nv. United Air Lines, Inc., supra. Nevertheless, exhaustion is not necessary when (1) further administrative \nreview by the agency would be futile because the agency will not provide the relief requested, or (2) the \nagency lacks the authority or capacity to determine the matters in controversy. State v. Golden’s Concrete \nCo., 962 P.2d 919, 923 (Colo.1998). \n  \n  \nIn this case, the Defendants ask the Court to dismiss the complaint because of a failure to exhaust the available administrative \nremedy provided by Colorado Department of Corrections Regulation Administrative Regulation AR 850-04. \n  \nThe Plaintiffs have responded that they feel that C.R.S. 13-17.5-102.3 does not apply to this case because of the language \n“under any statute or constitutional provision”. Instead their claim is that the claims of the Plaintiffs arise under the common \nlaw and not any statute o constitutional provision. \n  \nFurther they state that the Colorado Court of Appeals in Grover v. State, 129 P.3d 1083 (Colo.App.2005), did not hear this \nargument and therefore did not decide this specific issue. \n  \nIn Martin v. People, 27 P.3d 846 (Colo.2001)the Colorado Supreme Court gave the trial Courts some guidelines in \ninterpreting a statute: They held: \nOur fundamental responsibility in interpreting a statute is to give effect to the General Assembly’s purpose or intent in \nenacting the statute. Reg’l Transp. Dist. v. Lopez, 916 P.2d 1187, 1192 (Colo.1996); Lakeview Assocs. v. Maes, 907 P.2d \n580, 584 (Colo.1995). Our interpretive efforts begin with the language of the statute itself. Lopez, 916 P.2d at 1192; Maes, \n907 P.2d at 584. If the statutory language unambiguously sets forth the legislative purpose, we need not apply additional rules \nof statutory construction to determine the statute’s meaning. Lopez, 916 P.2d at 1192; Maes, 907 P.2d at 584. Conversely, if \nthe statutory language does not unambiguously establish the General Assembly’s purpose in enacting the statute, or if the \nstatute appears to conflict with other provisions, then we may rely on other factors, such as legislative history, prior law, the \nconsequences of a given construction of the statute, and the end to be achieved by the statute, to determine the meaning of a \nstatute. § 2-4-203, 1 C.R.S. (1999); Schubert v. People, 698 P.2d 788, 793-94 (Colo.1985). Our analysis of a statute is \nfounded on the assumption that the General Assembly intended that the entire statute be effective. § 2-4-201(1)(b), 1 C.R.S. \n(1999). We “must read and consider the statutory scheme as a whole to give consistent, harmonious and sensible effect to all \nits parts.” Charnes v. Boom, 766 P.2d 665, 667 (Colo.1988); see also Bynum v. Kautzky, 784 P.2d 735, 738 (Colo.1989)(“If \npossible, we must try to reconcile statutes governing the same subject.”). In interpreting a comprehensive legislative scheme, \nwe must construe each provision to further the overall legislative intent behind the statutes. A.B. Hirschfeld Press, Inc. v. \nCity & County of Denver, 806 P.2d 917, 920 (Colo.1991). \n  \n  \nThe Court went on to hold the following: \nWhen the language is clear and unambiguous, the statute must be construed as written, without resort to \ninterpretive rules of statutory construction. People v. Zapotocky, 869 P.2d 1234 (Colo.1994). However, if \nthe statutory language lends itself to alternative constructions, and its intended scope is unclear, a court \nmay  apply  other  rules  of  statutory  construction  to  determine  which  alternative  construction  is  in \naccordance with the objectives sought to be achieved by the legislation. People v. Terry, 791 P.2d 374 \n(Colo.1990). If the statutory language does not unambiguously establish the General Assembly’s intent, \nwe may also consider the consequences of a given construction of the statute and the end to be achieved \nby the statute. Martin v. People, 27 P.3d 846 (Colo.2001). In addition, we must read and consider the \nstatutory scheme as a whole to give consistent, harmonious, and sensible effect to all its parts. People v. \nCooper, 27 P.3d 348 (Colo.2001). \n  \n  \nIn applying these general rules of statutory construction to CR.S. 13 17.5-102.3 this Court is struck by the fact that the words \n“under any statute or constitutional provision” do not directly carve out an exception that is based upon the common law. In \n  2 \n\nAbrahamson v. Corrections Corp. of America, 2007 WL 5210192 (2007)   \n \n \nfact the legislative history cited by the Plaintiffs makes no mention to common law causes of action. \n  \nA reading of the statute makes it clear that the legislature wanted to provide for all administrative remedies to be exhausted \nfor any claim based on prison conditions. \n  \nThe Court agrees that this complaint should be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. FAILURE TO \nALLEGE ANY ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY INJURY \n  \nA plain reading of the complaint shows that the Plaintiff, in light of the notice pleading requirements, has alleged sufficient \ninjury. PREMATURE ALLEGATION OF PUNITATIVE DAMAGES \n  \nC.R.S. 13-21-102(1.5)(A) requires that any allegation of punitive damages be dismissed at this time. \n  \nTHEREFORE the complaint is dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies and any allegation of punitive \ndamages is dismissed. \n  \nDone this 6th Day of March 2007. \n  \nBy the Court \n  \n<<signature>> \n  \nMichael Schiferl, Judge \n  \nCC: Plaintiff \n  \nDefendants \n  \n \n \n  3 ",

Trine and Deborah L. Taussig of Trine & Metcalf, P.C., and allege and complain as \nfollows:   \n \nPRELIMINARY ALLEGATIONS  \n \n  1.  At all times material hereto, the Defendant, Corrections Corporation of \nAmerica (hereinafter “CCA”), was and is a Tennessee corporation in the business of \nowning and operating private prisons, for profit, in the United States, including four \nprivate prisons in the State of Colorado.  In July, 2004, CCA owned and operated the \nCrowley County Correctional Facility (hereinafter “CCCF”) located in Crowley County, \nColorado.   \n \n  2.  In order to increase its profits from housing prisoners, CCA has a national \npolicy and practice of cutting costs by building prisons in remote rural areas to take \nadvantage of cheap non-union labor, then understaffing and providing inadequate training \nto its guards.  It also increases profits by accepting inmates from other states in order to \nkeep its prisons filled.  At all times material hereto, CCA’s national policies, practices \nand procedures were utilized in its operation of CCCF.   \n \n  3.  At  all  times  material  hereto,  the  individually  named  Defendants  were \nemployees and/or agents of CCA acting under the direction and control of CCA and \nacting within the course and scope of their employment and/or agency.   All tortious \nconduct of individual Defendants hereinafter alleged is imputed to CCA as a matter of \nlaw.   \n \n  4.  At all times material hereto, and on July 20 and 21, 2004, the Plaintiffs \nwere inmates incarcerated at CCCF, a designated Level III or medium custody security \nfacility with an offender capacity of 1,144 disbursed through six cell houses.  Cellhouse 5 \nconstruction was incomplete at the time of the riot.   \n \n  5.  Each of the Plaintiffs seeks damages for physical and mental injuries \nsustained as the result of a riot which occurred at CCCF on July 20 and 21, 2004.  \nPlaintiffs’ claims are based on State common law torts.  Plaintiffs’ claims are not based \nupon prison conditions under any statute or constitutional provision.    \n \n  6.  None of the Plaintiffs were actively involved in the riot, which was the \nresult of Defendants’ negligence and the conduct of other inmates.   \n \n7.  The below-named Plaintiffs are not presently incarcerated at CCCF: \n \n  3\n\nJason M. Abrahamson, Jared Adam, William A. Albillar, Rudy Alvarado, Lonnie \nLee Anderson, Justin Andreae, John C.

On July 20, 2004, at approximately 7:00 p.m., inmates at CCCF were \nreleased to the recreation yards and at approximately 7:05 p.m., a group of inmates in the \nWest Recreation Yard requested to speak to the Warden about complaints and grievances \nthat the inmates had, and the Shift Commander, Captain Garcia, accompanied by other \ncorrectional officers (hereinafter “CO’s”), denied the request and immediately retreated \nfrom  the  yard.    The  Shift  Commander  then  directed  that  a  public  address  system \nannouncement be made ordering all inmates in the yard to return to their living units.  \nThe inmates who had requested to speak to the Warden became hostile and refused to \nreturn to their living units.  An order was then given for the living units to lock their \ndoors and for the prison staff to prepare to evacuate their posts.   \n \n  9.  CCCF did not have an adequate number of staff on duty and the staff \npresent was not adequately trained to dispel a disturbance.  Therefore, no effort was made \nby Captain Garcia and the CO’s to control the disturbance, and, instead, Captain Garcia \nordered the staff to prepare for an emergency evacuation.   \n \n  4\n\n  10.  The unruly group of inmates in the West Yard, upon observing the CO’s \nevacuate the yards, began using free weights and exercise equipment to break windows in \nHousing Units 1 and 2.   \n \n  11.    Plaintiffs who were in the West Yard when the disturbance occurred \nattempted to comply with the public address system announcement to return to their \nliving units, but the CO in the control room did not initially open the entrance to the \nHousing  Units.  The  rioters  broke  into  Housing  Units  1  and  2,  the  CO’s  fled  and \nabandoned the Housing Units, and the rioters, knowing that all of the CO’s had fled, \nbegan engaging in more flagrant, violent misconduct.  Fires were started in the Units and \nat the doors to the Units, the management offices were broken into, rioting inmates rifled \nthrough case management records and files looking for information on other inmates \nconsidered to be police informants (snitches) and sex offenders, who were then targeted \nfor assault.  \n \n  12.      Plaintiffs who were in the West Yard when the riot began and who were \nhoused in Unit 6 were never allowed into their unit, and they were trapped in the West \nYard throughout the riot.  While trapped in the West Yard, they were forced to inhale tear \ngas and smoke, and they were shot or shot at by guards even though they were obviously \nnot participating in the riot by sitting, lying prone and/or holding their hands in the air. \n \n  13.  Plaintiffs who were able to escape the West Yard and return to their Units \nwere forced to breathe the smoke created by fires because it filled the Units and the cells \nthrough the ventilation system and flowed under the cell doors.  The rioters broke water \npipes, sinks and toilets, along with damage to water lines and sprinkler systems, causing \ncells to flood with water contaminated by feces, blood and broken glass. Plaintiffs who \nhad locked down in their cells had both water and smoke flowing into their cells under \nthe cell doors. These Plaintiffs were in fear for their lives, knowing that the guards had \nfled leaving them to the mercy of the rioters, and knowing that fires were filling their \ncells with toxic smoke, and that their lives were in danger from fire, smoke inhalation and \nrioting inmates.  Many of these Plaintiffs wrapped their faces with wet towels, attempting \nto protect themselves from toxic smoke inhalation.  Many of these Plaintiffs also stuffed \nclothing or towels in the crack under their cell doors to reduce smoke inhalation.  When \nthe  SORT  team  entered,  they  injected  tear  gas  into  the  ventilation  system,  forcing \nPlaintiffs who were in their cells to breathe and become covered with the toxic chemical \nfor an extended period of time within an enclosed space from which no escape was \npossible. \n \n  14.  When the riot began in the East Yard, Plaintiffs became trapped in the \nEast Yard units, which were also flooding with water contaminated by feces, blood and \nbroken glass.  These Plaintiffs were also in fear for their lives, knowing that the guards \nhad fled leaving them to the mercy of the rioters, and knowing that fires were filling their \ncells with toxic smoke, and that their lives were in danger from fire, smoke inhalation and \nrioting inmates.  Plaintiffs in the East Yard units were also exposed to tear gas within \ntheir cells and units within an enclosed space for an extended period of time with no \nescape possible.  \n  5\n\n \n  15.  Plaintiffs who were initially locked down in their cells when the riot \nstarted, but who asked other inmates to open their cell doors so that they could escape the \nfires and smoke, observed CO’s using live ammunition, buckshot, birdseed, and rubber \npellets to shoot inmates leaving the units.  These Plaintiffs had the choice of remaining in \nburning buildings, suffering smoke inhalation or possible assault by rioters, or leaving the \nbuilding and being shot.  Most of them therefore stayed in the housing units.   \n \n  16.  Some Plaintiffs were locked in their cells, the library, or the medical unit \nthroughout the riot. Plaintiffs locked in the library protected the librarian who was locked \nin with them.  When the SORT teams finally came in, they brutalized these Plaintiffs in \nbasically the same manner as other Plaintiffs who were forced to escape their cells or \nunits in order to breathe or who were locked out of their unit and trapped in the West \nYard.  \n \n  17.  Upon fleeing the recreation yards and Housing Units, the prison CO’s \nrequested assistance from the CCCF Special Operations Response Teams (“SORT”), and \nfrom the Colorado Department of Corrections (“DOC”), SORT and Emergency Response \nTeams (“ERT”), from the Colorado State Patrol, the Crowley County, Otero County and \nPueblo Sheriff’s Offices, and SORT team members from the Kit Carson and Bent County \nprivate prisons, which are also operated by CCA.   \n \n  18.  The rioting continued unabated and spread to the East Recreation Yard \nand other Units.  By 9:00 p.m., seven CCCF SORT members arrived and Unit 6, A Pod, \nwas locked down and CCCF Chief Selman gave the order to fire rubber bullets and \nbirdshot at inmates.   \n \n  19.  In the next few hours, as CCCF SORT teams and SORT teams borrowed \nfrom other facilities took control of the prison, Plaintiffs who had been trapped in the \nRecreation Yard and who did not participate in the riot were ordered to lie facedown on \nthe ground, were ordered not to speak or move under threat of being shot, and their arms \nwere pulled to their backs where they were handcuffed at the wrists by plastic ratcheted \ntie cuffs that were pulled so tight that the cuffs cut into the skin and caused inmates’ \nhands  to  become  numb.    The  inmates  were  then  further  punished  by  SORT  team \nmembers, many dressed in black with black masks and no nametags, who pulled inmates \nby the arms and cuffs to their feet.  If an inmate complained of pain from the tight cuffs, \nthe cuffs, which had ratchets, would be used to pull the inmate to his feet, causing further \ncuff tightening.   \n \n  20.  After being cuffed, the inmates were walked to sections of the Yard being \nused to round up inmates where they were thrown to the ground and ordered not to move \nunder threat of being shot.   \n \n  21.  Before SORT teams removed inmates from their cells in buildings filled \nwith smoke, they shot teargas and sometimes pepper spray into the building and pods. As \n  6\n\npepper spray and teargas entered the exhaust system of Units, inmates trapped in their \ncells suffered from both smoke inhalation and the teargas and pepper spray.   \n \n  22.  When SORT teams entered cells on the floors that were flooded, inmates, \nincluding the Plaintiffs who were in those cells, were ordered to lie facedown in the water \ncontaining feces, blood, and broken glass, under threat or being shot if they refused to do \nso.  The inmates, including Plaintiffs, were then dragged from their cells by their ankles \nthrough the contaminated water and glass.  When removed from the cell, a SORT team \nmember would place a knee on the inmate’s neck while other SORT team members \nviolently pulled the inmate’s arms behind his back and placed ratcheted plastic tie cuffs \non the inmate’s wrists.  The inmate was then walked by lifting the arms in the air behind \nthe inmate’s back, causing great pain to the wrists and shoulders, and was deposited \noutside the building where other inmates from inside the building were being placed.   \n \n  23.  All of the Plaintiffs, as well as other inmates, were handcuffed and treated \nas above-described and placed in the Yard where they remained throughout the night and \nmorning of the following day, July 21, 2004.   \n \n  24.  Those inmates who were dragged from their cells by their ankles through \nwater were forced to lie facedown on the ground, in the dirt, which became mud.  Being \ndrug through water or being soaked by the sprinkler system intensified the effects of tear \ngas and/or pepper spray.  Plaintiffs were not allowed to remove the tear gas and/or pepper \nspray from their skin, eyes, mouth and clothing. \n \n  25.  Throughout the night and early morning, the Plaintiffs and other inmates \ncomplained to CO’s of wrist and shoulder pain, numbness of hands, and bleeding or \nswollen wrists and hands, asking that the handcuffs be loosened and all such requests \nwere denied, often with the statement that, “this is what you deserve for rioting.”   \n \n  26.  All of the inmates, including the Plaintiffs, began requesting water as they \nbecame thirsty and as the sun came up and it became hot the following day, and all such \nrequests were denied until late morning, July 21, 2004.  SORT team members drank \nwater in front of the thirsty inmates, laughing.   \n \n  27.  As it became necessary for each of the Plaintiffs to urinate or defecate, \nrequests to stand up to go urinate or use a restroom were denied and most of the Plaintiffs \nwere forced to urinate in their clothing while cramped close together in the yard and \nsome had to defecate in their pants.  When asked to use the restroom, SORT team \nmembers  or  CO’s  told  them  to  “pee  in  your  pants,”  indicating  this  was  further \npunishment for the riot.   \n \n  28.  During the morning of July 21, 2004, the handcuffs were removed from \nthe backs of many Plaintiffs and new cuffs placed on their wrists in front so that they \ncould eat bologna sandwiches provided during the day.  Some Plaintiffs either did not get \nthe handcuffs removed from their backs to their fronts so that they could eat, or were not \ngiven food when other Plaintiffs were fed. \n  7\n\n \n  29.  By the late afternoon of July 21, 2004, the Plaintiffs were placed in cells in \nother pods that had not been damaged by the riot, but which were already occupied by \ninmates.  Some were placed in cells in a building still under construction, which had no \nmattresses or bedding, and some were returned to cells still containing smoke and the \nremnants of gas or pepper spray, but with no mattresses or bedding.  All mattresses and \nbedding were removed from Plaintiffs’ cells before they returned.     \n \n  30.  As further punishment, Plaintiffs were not provided clean clothing or a \nchange in clothing and were not allowed to take showers.  All of the Plaintiffs and other \ninmates were placed in “lockdown” and could not leave their cells.  Box lunch bologna \nsandwiches  were  kicked  into  their  cells  daily  and  their  diet  consisted  of  bologna \nsandwiches for the first month following the riot.   \n \n  31.  After the first three days, CO’s began taking Plaintiffs and other inmates \nto showers where all shower curtains had been removed and they were forced to strip \ndown, often in front of female CO’s, and were paraded naked into the showers.  This \nactivity was often videotaped.  Some Plaintiffs did not receive a shower until the fourth \nor fifth day following the riot, and some had to wait seven or ten days.  With all personal \nproperty removed from cells, none of the Plaintiffs had clothing they could change into \nand remove their filthy clothing containing urine and tear gas.   \n \n  32.  All of the Plaintiffs, together with other inmates, were in lockdown for at \nleast thirty days after the riot with no hot meals, no special dietary food for those with \nmedical conditions which required special diets, with no access to telephones, no visitors \npermitted, and no access to the legal system.  Plaintiffs who received medications were \ndenied their prescription medications, and most Plaintiffs were denied medical care for \ntheir injuries. \n \n \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \n(Common Law Negligence in Causing Riot)  \n \n  33.  CCA, through its officers, agents and employees, was negligent, which \nnegligence was a substantial cause of the riot which occurred on July 20, 2004, and \nwhich negligence consisted, inter alia, in the following:   \n \n  a.  Inequality of Treatment \n \n  (1)  During the days prior to the riot, 198 inmates from the State \nof Washington were moved to CCCF.  They, along with 116 inmates from \nWyoming  and  807  Colorado  inmates,  brought  the  facility’s  total \npopulation to 1,130.  CCA knew or reasonably should have known that \naccepting  large  numbers  of  inmates  from  Washington  would  result  in \nresentment and anger over the inequities arising from disparate treatment \nthat each group of inmates received.   \n  8\n\n \n  (2)  CCA knew before receiving inmates from Washington and \nWyoming that the amount of inmate wages paid by each state per month \nfor similar inmate work assignments is different, ranging from $60 paid to \nWashington  and  Wyoming  inmates  while  Colorado  pays  $18.60  per \nmonth.   \n \n  (3)  CCA knew that, in separating Washington inmates from \ntheir families in Washington who could no longer visit, that the lack of \nvisitation  and  connection  with  family  would  result  in  severe  distress, \ndepression  and  anxiety  among  many  Washington  inmates,  and  would \nresult in unrest that could lead to or contribute to a disturbance.   \n \n  (4)  CCA  did  not  provide  inmates  with  supplies  and  items \nnecessary for hygiene, and CCA was aware of inmate complaints of not \nearning enough money to purchase needed items from the canteen.   \n \n  b.  Food Service.   \n \n  (1)  CCA failed to be responsible for ensuring that the food \nserved adhered to CDOC mandated menu items in violation of C.R.S. § \n17-1-202(1)(f), which violation constitutes negligence per se.   \n \n  (2)  Inmates’ complaints about food quality and quantity were \nignored  by  CCA,  as  were  inmate  complaints  of  treatment  disparity \nbetween  Colorado  inmates  and  Washington  inmates  regarding  food \nportions.   \n \n  (3)  Inmate complaints of improper preparation of medical and \nreligious diets by the food service staff were ignored by CCA.   \n \nc.  Misuse of Force.   \n \n  (1)  CCA  staff  improperly  used  excessive  force  on  inmates \nprior to the riot, which angered many inmates who became aware of the \nuse of excessive force.   \n \n  (2)  CCA  negligently  trained  and  monitored  its  employees, \nwhich resulted in employees’ use of excessive and improper force.   \n \nd.  Failure to Address Inmate Grievances and Issues.   \n \n  (1)  On July 20, 2004, some inmates in the West Recreation \nYard  requested  to  speak  to  the  warden  about  their  grievances  and \ncomplaints, which request was denied by CCA’s shift commander.   \n \n  9\n\ne.  CCA Ignored Prior Warnings of Potential Riot.   \n \n  (1)  CCA was warned by members of its staff and by some \ninmates  that  inmates  were  unhappy  and  could  riot  if  the  issues  and \ngrievances were not addressed.  CCA negligently ignored these warnings \nand took no remedial action.   \n \nf.  Knowledge of Prior Riot.   \n \n  (1)  CCA knew or reasonably should have known of a prior riot \nat CCCF in 1999, resulting from a massive move of Washington inmates \nfrom Washington to CCCF, yet CCA negligently permitted another mass \nremoval of Washington prisoners to CCCF in early July 2004, which again \nresulted in a riot created by the conditions heretofore set forth.   \n \ng.   Failure to Provide Services and Programs \n   \n  (1)  CCA  failed  to  be  responsible  for  providing  licensed \nmedical and psychological services, education and work programs at least \nequal to those provided at comparable state correctional facilities, which \nviolation constitutes negligence per se under C.R.S. § 17-1-202(1)(f) and \nC.R.S. § 25-3-101. \n \nh.   Failure To Provide Or Follow Adequate Security Measures. \n \n  (1)  CCA  failed  to  limit  incarceration  of  inmates  to  those \nclassified as medium custody and below, and then failed to provide or \nconsistently follow adequate security measures.  \n \ni.  Lengthy Count Times  \n \n  (1)  CCA failed to adequately staff the prison and properly train \nprison  staff,  which  resulted  in  lengthy  and  inaccurate  body  counts  of \ninmates several times a day while inmates were in lockdown for body \ncounts.  The delayed body counts, while in lockdown, deprived inmates of \ntime scheduled for programs and recreation.  The problem was aggravated \nupon arrival of large numbers of Washington inmates.   \n \n  34.  Although  Plaintiffs  did  not  participate  in  the  riot,  CCA’s  negligence, \nwhich was a cause of the riot, resulted in Plaintiffs being physically and mentally abused \nas set forth in Paragraphs 12 through 32 of this Complaint.  As a result, each of the \nPlaintiffs was injured and damaged in the following particulars:   \n \na.   Forced to breathe smoke, toxic substances, and/or tear gas that \nwas launched into an enclosed environment or from which there was no \nescape,  causing  burning  skin  and  eyes,  choking,  vomiting,  headaches, \n  10\n\ndizziness,  asthma  attacks,  and/or  temporary  or  chronic  breathing  and \neyesight problems.

CCA, through its officers, agents and employees, and the above-captioned \nindividual Defendants, were negligent in failing to control and curtail the disturbance \nbefore it became a riot, which negligence consisted, inter alia, of the following:   \n \n  a.  CCA negligently failed to develop and implement a proper plan \nspecifying the procedures to be followed when a disturbance occurs, which could \nthreaten facility security.   \n \n  b.  CCA  failed  to  properly  train  its  CO  employees  and  security \npersonnel on the control of an inmate disturbance before the disturbance becomes \na riot, and failed to properly train its employees and personnel on the procedures \nto be used to control a riot without the use of excessive force.   \n \n  c.  It was CCA’s practice to hire inexperienced staff and pay low \nwages, which resulted in high employee turnover.  As a result, CCA did not have \nan adequate number of trained CO’s, ERT’s, and SORT’s on duty or available to \ndispel the disturbance before it degenerated into a riot.   \n \n  d.  The individual Defendant-employees of CCA negligently failed to \nrespond to the disturbance as quickly and effectively as possible to prevent the \ndisturbance from developing into a riot.   \n \n  19\n\n  e.  CCA negligently failed to guard and monitor the weight exercise \nequipment and secure the equipment so that it could not be used for destructive \npurposes in a riot.   \n \n  f.  CCA  violated  its  contract  with  the  Colorado  Department  of \nCorrections (“CDOC”) in failing to develop an emergency plan consistent with \nCDOC  Administrative  Regulation  300-30RD,  which  violation  constitutes \nnegligence per se.   \n \n  g.  The  negligence  of  CCA’s  officers,  agents  and  employees  as \nheretofore set forth is imputed to CCA as a matter of law.   \n \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Negligence in Quelling The Riot) \n \n  36.   CCA’s agents and employees shot Plaintiffs who it knew or should have \nknown were not participating in the riot because they were lying prone, sitting or walking \nwith their hands up, and used tear gas when Plaintiffs were unable to disperse because \nthey were lying prone at gunpoint waiting to be cuffed or were in their cells. \n \n  37.   CCA negligently allowed Plaintiffs to be injured by CCA’s agents and \nemployees as described in Paragraph 34 of this Complaint. \n \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \n(Outrageous Conduct)  \n \n  38.  The conduct of CCA’s agents and employees as described in Paragraphs \n12 through 34 of this Complaint constitutes the tort of extreme and outrageous conduct, \nwhich caused each of the Plaintiffs to suffer severe emotional distress.   \n \n  39.  The outrageous conduct of CCA’s agents and employees is imputed to \nCCA as a matter of law.   \n \n  40.  As a result of the outrageous conduct, each of the Plaintiffs was also \ninjured and damaged as described in Paragraph 34 of this Complaint.   \n \n  41.  The outrageous conduct by CCA’s agents and employees constitute willful \nand wanton conduct giving rise to punitive damages.   \n \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \n(Civil Conspiracy)  \n \n  42.  The  individual  Defendants  and  other  agents  and  employees  of  CCA, \ntogether with unnamed members of CDOC’s SORT and ERT teams, agreed, by words or \nconduct, to punish the Plaintiffs by use of excessive and unlawful force.   \n \n  20\n\n  43.  The excessive and unlawful force is described in Paragraphs 19 through \n25 of this Complaint.   \n \n  44.  The excessive and unlawful force was utilized for the unlawful purpose of \npunishing the Plaintiffs who did not participate in the riot.   \n \n  45.  The conduct described in Paragraphs 19 through 32 of this Complaint \nconstitutes a civil conspiracy and the conduct of all persons who participated in the \nconspiracy is imputed one to the other, giving rise to joint liability.   \n \n  WHEREFORE, each of the Plaintiffs prays that judgment be entered against the \nDefendants,  jointly  and  severally,  for  compensatory  damages  in  an  amount  to  be \ndetermined by a jury for all injuries and damages sustained as heretofore set forth, for all \nof the costs incurred by Plaintiffs in this litigation, for pre-judgment interest as allowed \nby law, and for such and further relief as the Court may deem appropriate.   \n \n  DATED this _______ day of February, 2006.   \n \n            TRINE & METCALF, P.C.  \n \n \n \n____________________________________ \nWilliam A.

See, e.g., Stone v. State Farm Mut. Auto.

The Court of Appeals which would have jurisdiction of an appeal of such action \nmay thereupon, in its discretion, permit an appeal to be taken from such order, if application is made to it within ten days after the \nentry of the order: Provided, however, That application for an appeal hereunder shall not stay proceedings in the district court \nunless the district judge or the Court of Appeals or a judge thereof shall so order.” \n \n2  Alabama, California, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Vermont, and \nVirginia are similar to Colorado in that they only allow discretionary interlocutory appeals if the ruling being appealed involves a \n \n“question of law.” See Ala. R.App. P. 5(a); Cal.Civ.Proc.Code § 166.1 (West 2011); D.C.Code § 11–721(d) (2011); Ill. S.Ct. R. \n308(a); Ind. R.App. P. 14(B)(c); Kan. Stat. Ann. § 60–2102(c) (2011); N.M. Stat. Ann. 39–3–4(A) (2011); Or.Rev.Stat. § 19.225 \n(2011); 42 Pa. Cons.Stat. § 702(b) (2011); Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. § 51.014(d) (West 2011); Vt. R.App. P. 5.1(a); \nVa.Code Ann. § 8.01–267.8(B) (2011). Some states, such as Colorado, require the question of law to be “controlling,” e.g., N.M. \nStat. Ann. 39–3–4(A) (2011), while others require it to be “substantial,” see Ind. R.App. P. 14(B)(c). Illinois, however, requires \nneither. See Ill. S.Ct. R. 308(a). \n \n3  Cases interpreting the federal statute uniformly hold that the decision to accept an interlocutory appeal rests in the sole discretion \nof the appellate court. See, e.g., OFS Fitel, LLC v. Epstein, Becker & Green, P.C., 549 F.3d 1344, 1358 (11th Cir.2008) (“§ \n \n1292(b) certification is wholly discretionary with both the district court and this Court.”); James v.

Nix, 43 F.3d 374, 377 (8th Cir.1994) (concluding \nthat interlocutory review under section 1292(b) was inappropriate because the “issue presented by appellants is merely whether the \n \ndistrict court abused its discretion in ordering production of the files”; “The discretionary nature of discovery issues has led at least \none court to conclude that discovery orders generally will never involve a controlling question of law.”); Simon v.

Despite looking to federal jurisprudence for guidance, see, e.g., Pearson \nv. Philip Morris, Inc., 208 Or.App. 501, 504, 145 P.3d 298 (Or.Ct.App.2006) (“Because ORS 19.225 is modeled on 28 U.S.C. \nsection 1292(b), we assume that the legislature intended to incorporate interpretations of that provision existing at the time that the \nOregon statute was enacted.”), some state courts have addressed purely discretionary issues on interlocutory appeal. E.g., Safeco \nIns. Co. of Am. v. Superior Court, 173 Cal.App.4th 814, 92 Cal.Rptr.3d 814, 822–23 (2009) (reviewing on interlocutory appeal \nwhether the district court abused its discretion in allowing pre-class certification discovery after addressing a related legal \nquestion). \n \n7  See, e.g., Cipollone v.
