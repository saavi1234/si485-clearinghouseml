The court finds exceptional circumstances warrant the use of a pseudonym for this plaintiff. The court has weighed the multi−factor balancing test, see Doe v. Megless, 654 F.3d 404, 408−09 (3d Cir. 2011), and finds that the balance of factors weighs heavily in favor of a pseudonym. However, as in Doe v. Trustees of Dartmouth Coll., No. 18−CV−040−LM, 2018 WL 2048385, at *7 (D.N.H. May 2, 2018), the court's order is limited to pretrial proceedings. Also, if, at any point during pretrial proceedings, Jane Doe's use of a pseudonym impacts whether she can act as a class representative, the court will reconsider this order. See In re Ashley Madison Customer Data Security Breach Litigation, MDL No. 2669, 2016 WL 1366616, at *4 (E.D. Mo. Apr. 6, 2016) (allowing anonymity for plaintiff as class member but not class representative). Accordingly, the parties shall use the pseudonym Jane Doe for this plaintiff and shall redact her true name from all documents in this case and refrain from revealing her true identity. The seal is at Level I. This protective order shall remain in effect until such time as a further order is issued. So Ordered by Chief Judge Landya B. McCafferty.(js) (Entered: 11/30/2018)"

Megless, 654 F.3d 404, 408-09 (3d Cir. 2011), and finds that the balance of factors weighs heavily in favor of a pseudonym. However, as in Doe v. Trustees of Dartmouth Coll., No. 18-CV-040-LM, 2018 WL 2048385, at *7 (D.N.H. May 2, 2018), the court's order is limited to pretrial proceedings. Also, if, at any point during pretrial proceedings, Jane Doe's use of a pseudonym impacts whether she can act as a class representative, the court will reconsider this order. See In re Ashley Madison Customer Data Security Breach Litigation, MDL No. 2669, 2016 WL 1366616, at *4 (E.D. Mo. Apr. 6, 2016) (allowing anonymity for plaintiff as class member but not class representative). Accordingly, the parties shall use the pseudonym Jane Doe for this plaintiff and shall redact her true name from all documents in this case and refrain from revealing her true identity. The seal is at Level I. This protective order shall remain in effect until such time as a further order is issued. So Ordered by Chief Judge Landya B. McCafferty.(js)"

    "summary": "<p>On November 15, 2018, seven female students in Dartmouth's Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences filed this putative class action suit against the Trustees of Dartmouth College under Title IX and New Hampshire common law in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire. The plaintiffs claimed a hostile educational environment, gender discrimination, quid pro quo sexual harassment, and retaliation in violation of Title IX. Additionally, the plaintiff class claimed that the Trustees of Dartmouth College breached their fiduciary duties and negligently supervised and retained professors in violation of New Hampshire common law. The plaintiff class, represented by private counsel, sought declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief.</p>\r\n<p>Specifically, the plaintiff class claimed that three professors in the Department of Psychology and Brain Sciences leered at, groped, \"sexted,\" intoxicated, and raped female students. The plaintiffs further alleged that though they had contacted Dartmouth&rsquo;s Title IX office in April 2017, Dartmouth failed to take action. Twenty days after the plaintiffs had contacted Dartmouth&rsquo;s Title IX office&mdash;after Dartmouth&rsquo;s inaction&mdash;one plaintiff was sexually assaulted. At least 27 complainants came forward to participate in the Title IX investigation. Finally, the plaintiffs claimed that when Dartmouth finally did take action by beginning an investigation, it was unilaterally stopped in July and the three professors in question were allowed to resign or retire.</p>\r\n<p>In the complaint, the plaintiffs defined the class as \"every current and former female graduate and undergraduate student who has matriculated or will matriculate at Dartmouth in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences between March 31, 2015 and the date of judgment.\"</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to District Judge Landya B. McCafferty.</p>\r\n<p>On May 1, 2019, the plaintiffs filed an amended class action complaint, adding two more Jane Does and their factual allegations to the record. The defendants contested these two additional Jane Does proceeding under pseudonyms, but Judge McCafferty approved the plaintiffs' motions to proceed under pseudonym on January 29, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>The parties quickly moved to settlement negotiations. On September 10, 2019, the parties jointly proposed a settlement agreement.</p>\r\n<p>The parties modified the definition of the class slightly in this settlement agreement. The class include any female undergraduate or graduate student at Dartmouth that satisfies any of the following criteria: were graduate advisors or research assistants of the three former professors in the complaint, were graduate assistants in the Psychological and Brain Sciences Department that co-authored at least one paper based on lab research they conducted with the professors or co-authored three papers with the professors without lab work, were graduate students in the Department that do not fall into these categories but can attest to emotional and psychological harm, or undergraduate student research assistants of the three professors.</p>\r\n<p>The parties did not include a specified monetary amount in the settlement agreement. Instead, they wrote that the defendant must pay a base amount of $1,000 for any class member that comes forward, that amount can increase based on an Independent Claim Expert's assessment of the severity of the claims, and that the defendant will pay the plaintiff's attorney fees.</p>\r\n<p>Judge McCafferty preliminarily approved this settlement agreement on September 25, 2019, and granted final approval on July 10, 2020.</p>",

MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS ............................................................................ 22 \n \ni \n\nThis Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement, dated as of September 10, 2019 (the \n“Agreement,” or “Settlement”), is made and entered into by and among (i) the Plaintiffs, on behalf \nof themselves and each Settlement Class Member, by and through their undersigned counsel, and \n(ii) the Defendant, by and through its undersigned representative; and is submitted pursuant to \nRule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \nThe Settlement is intended by the Parties to fully, finally, and forever compromise, settle, \nrelease, resolve, discharge, and dismiss with prejudice this Litigation (i.e., the above-captioned \naction, 1:18-cv-01070-LM, pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire), \nand all Released Claims, subject to the terms and conditions stated in this Agreement and subject \nto Final approval of the Court. \nWHEREAS: \nA.  In April 2017, certain of the named Plaintiffs, in conjunction with other students, \nbrought to the attention of the Dartmouth Administration conduct by three then-tenured professors \n(the “Three Former Professors”) which was antithetical to the mission of Dartmouth College. \nB.  The Three Former Professors were placed on leave, barred from campus during \nTitle  IX  investigations  and  subsequent  disciplinary  proceedings  initiated  to  revoke  tenure; \nthereafter banned permanently from campus; and resigned or retired before the tenure revocation \nprocess could be concluded. \nC.  On November 15, 2018, Plaintiffs Kristina Rapuano (“Dr. Rapuano”), Vassiki \nChauhan (“Ms. Chauhan”), Sasha Brietzke (“Ms. Brietzke”), Annemarie Brown (“Dr. Brown”), \nAndrea Courtney (“Dr. Courtney”), Marissa Evans (“Ms. Evans”), and Jane Doe (collectively, the \n“Original Plaintiffs”) commenced this action (the “Litigation”) by filing a putative class action \ncomplaint against the Trustees of Dartmouth College (the “Defendant”) in this Court asserting \n1 \n\nclaims under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq., and claims \nunder New Hampshire common law for breach of fiduciary duty and negligent  hiring and \nsupervision. \nD.  On  January  15,  2019,  Defendant  filed  its  Answer,  which  set  forth  not  only \nDartmouth’s legal positions and defenses, but also responded in detail to Plaintiffs’ factual \nallegations.  \nE.  On February 11, 2019, the Parties submitted the Parties’ Jointly Filed Proposed \nDiscovery Plan, which the Court adopted with modifications on February 12, 2019. \nF.  On April 15, 2019, the parties exchanged initial disclosures. \nG.  On May 1, 2019, the Original Plaintiffs and two new plaintiffs—Jane Doe 2 and \nJane Doe 3 (together, with the Original Plaintiffs, the “Plaintiffs”)—filed a First Amended \nComplaint (the “Amended Complaint”). The Amended Complaint asserted the same claims as the \noriginal complaint, but it added claims on behalf of Jane Doe 2 and Jane Doe 3. \nH.  Plaintiffs  and  Defendant  conducted  exhaustive  investigations  of  the  facts \nunderlying Plaintiffs’ allegations before and during this Litigation. \nI.  In 2017, Dartmouth retained an independent investigator. Over the course of 11 \nmonths, she interviewed dozens of witnesses, reviewed electronic messages, collected records and \nprepared written reports concerning the conduct of the Three Former Professors who were alleged \nto have discriminated against and/or harassed female students.  \nJ.  After being retained by the Original Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs’ Counsel conducted their \nown factual investigation. They had access to  many of the same materials as Dartmouth’s \ninvestigator, and received copies of her written reports. Plaintiffs also spoke with additional \nwitnesses who did not speak with Dartmouth’s investigator. \n2 \n\nK.  Defendant’s motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint was due on May 29, 2019. \nFive days before that deadline, the parties jointly asked the Court to stay all deadlines so that they \ncould participate in mediation. The Court granted the joint motion and stayed the case on May 28, \n2019. The stay was to remain in effect until the later of (i) three days after the parties’ mediation \nconcluded, or (ii) July 31, 2019. \nL.  The parties held three full days of mediation on July 24, 25, and 26. They were \nassisted on the first two days by the Honorable Robert Morrill (ret.) acting as mediator. \nM.  On July 26, 2019 the parties jointly sought an extension of the stay, so that they \ncould continue to focus on the negotiations. The Court granted the motion and extended the stay \nuntil August 5, 2019. \nN.  On  August  5,  2019,  after  additional  extensive  arm’s-length  negotiations  and \nexchange of multiple proposals, the parties  reached an agreement in  principle to settle the \nLitigation, and memorialized their agreement in principle in a Term Sheet. \nO.  Defendant has denied and continues to deny liability under the theories and causes \nof action alleged.  Defendant is entering into this Agreement to eliminate the burden, expense, \ninconvenience, uncertainty, distraction, and risk of further litigation, and to effectuate its desire to \nprovide voluntary recompense for the ultra vires conduct of the Three Former Professors.  \nNOW THEREFORE, it is hereby stipulated and agreed, by and among the Parties, \nthrough their respective attorneys and representatives, subject to approval of the Court pursuant \nto Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and other conditions set forth herein, in \nconsideration of the benefits flowing to the Parties from the Settlement, that the Litigation, and \nall Released Claims shall be fully, finally, and forever compromised, settled, released, resolved, \n3 \n\ndischarged, and dismissed with prejudice against the Released Parties, upon and subject to the \nfollowing terms and conditions: \nI.

Defendant will pay the Class Settlement Amount, by wire transfer or otherwise, within \ntwenty-eight (28) days after the Effective Date. \n12.  Other than the obligation of Defendant to pay or cause to be paid the Class \nSettlement Amount, neither Defendant nor any other of the Released Parties shall have any \nobligation to make any other payment pursuant to this Agreement.  \nB.  Prospective Commitment  \n13.  In addition to the monetary payment described above, in compromise of this lawsuit \nDefendant further agrees that it will undertake the programmatic steps set forth in Exhibit A hereto.  \nV.  ATTORNEYS’  FEES  AND  LITIGATION  EXPENSES,  SETTLEMENT \nADMINISTRATION COSTS, AND SERVICE PAYMENTS \n14.

Class Members who solely come within Paragraph \n(2)(a)(iv) of the Settlement Class definition will receive the base payment if they submit a Claim \nForm attesting that they experienced dignitary, emotional, educational and/or professional harm \nduring the class period as a result of the misconduct of one or more of the Three Former Professors.  \nB.  Supplemental Payment \n20.  Class Members who submit a Claim Form are eligible for a supplemental payment \nto be determined by an Independent Claims Expert designated by the parties. Within 100 days \nfollowing the Claim Forms submission deadline, the Independent Claims Expert will evaluate the \nClaim Forms to determine each Class Member’s proportional pro rata share of the remaining \n13 \n\nsettlement funds. The Independent Claims Expert shall base the allocation on the information \nprovided in each Claim Form—including all facts that pre- or post-date the class period—and all \nrelevant supporting documentation submitted by the Class Members. In arriving at the distribution, \nthe Independent Claims Expert shall consider the following factors: (a) the description of the \nseverity of the alleged hostile environment (including but not limited to sexual harassment, sexual \nassault, and/or retaliation) suffered by the Class Member; (b) the description of the duration of the \nalleged hostile environment (including but not limited to sexual harassment, sexual assault, and/or \nretaliation) suffered by the Class Member; (c) the severity and duration of emotional distress \nalleged by the Class Member as a result of the hostile environment; (d) the degree to which the \nClass Member alleges that she suffered physical illness as a result of the hostile environment; (e) \nthe degree to which the Class Member alleges she suffered functional impairment that impacted \nher studies, work and/or related activities as a result of the alleged hostile environment; (f) the \ndegree to which the Class Member alleges she suffered impairment to her personal life, including \nfamilial, social and romantic relationships, as a result of the alleged hostile environment; (g) the \ndegree to which the Class Member alleges that she suffered direct or indirect economic losses as \na  result  of  the  alleged  hostile  environment,  including  (without  limitation)  medical  and/or \ncounseling expenses; (h) the degree to which the Class Member alleges that she will require future \ntreatment as a result of the alleged hostile environment; and (i) the merits and overall likelihood \nof success of each Class Member’s claims under Title IX.  The weight of each factor shall be left \nto the discretion of the Independent Claims Expert. In addition, the Independent Claims Expert \nwill consider any documentation and/or evidence provided by the Class Member demonstrating \nthe harm caused by the alleged hostile environment. With respect to factors (c) and (d), the \nIndependent Claims Expert shall give greater weight to those Class Members who submit medical \n14 \n\nor mental health records supporting their allegations of emotional distress or physical illness \ncaused by the hostile environment. The Independent Claims Expert’s allocation decision shall be \ndiscretionary, binding, and final and shall not be subject to review.  \n21.  All  Claim  Forms  and  supporting  documentation  are  to  be  treated  as  strictly \nconfidential and shall not be disclosed to anyone except the Independent Claims Expert. Class \nMembers may request the guidance or assistance of Class Counsel or the Settlement Administrator \nin  compiling  and  completing  their  submissions.  Any  further  information  provided  to  the \nIndependent Claims Expert will also be kept strictly confidential. \nC.  Uncashed Checks and Unused Funds \n22.  Any uncashed settlement distributions or other residual funds shall be handled as \nfollows: If the total amount is $50,000 or greater, an additional distribution to Class Members will \nbe made in accordance with the pro rata allocation determined by the Independent Claims Expert. \nIf the total amount is less than $50,000, the Settlement Administrator shall make a distribution to \na cy pres recipient selected by the parties. The cy pres beneficiary shall be an organization \nsupporting and/or advocating for victims of sexual assault. \nVII.  OBJECTIONS \n23.  Any Settlement Class Member wishing to object to the Agreement may do so only \naccording to the process ordered by the Court. \n24.  The Parties agree not to file any objection to this Agreement and to oppose any \nobjection to this Agreement.  \nVIII.  EXCLUSIONS \n25.  Any Settlement Class Member wishing to exclude herself from the Settlement may \ndo so only according to the process ordered by the Court. A Settlement Class Member’s failure to \n15 \n\ncomplete a Claim Form shall not allow a Settlement Class Member to exclude herself from the \nSettlement if she does not otherwise follow the process ordered by the Court. \n26.  Unless otherwise ordered by the Court, any person who does not submit a timely \nrequest for exclusion as provided by the Court’s order shall be bound by this Agreement. The \ndeadline for submitting requests for exclusion shall be 7 calendar days prior to the Fairness \nHearing. \nIX.  REQUEST FOR APPROVAL FROM COURT \n27.  Plaintiffs’ Counsel shall seek preliminary approval of this Agreement from the \nCourt no later than September 25, 2019 (unless another date is stipulated to by the Parties or \nordered by the Court). In connection with the preliminary approval motion, Counsel shall move \nfor the Court’s approval of the Preliminary Approval Order, which shall be substantially in the \nform attached hereto as Exhibit B. The proposed Preliminary Approval Order, inter alia, sets the \ndate for a Fairness Hearing and prescribes the method for giving notice of the Settlement to the \nSettlement Class. \n28.  Not later than ten (10) days after the Settlement Agreement is filed in court in \nconnection with the preliminary approval motion, Defendant shall provide notice of the proposed \nclass action settlement to the appropriate state officials (i.e. each state attorney general) and the \nAttorney General of the United States pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1715, and the costs of such notice \nshall be paid from the Class Settlement Amount. \n29.  At an appropriate time, Plaintiffs, by and through counsel, shall move the Court to \nenter the Final Approval Order, which will be substantially in the form of Exhibit C.    \n30.  The Settlement is expressly conditioned upon, among other things, the entry of a \nJudgment substantially in the form attached as Exhibit D. Plaintiffs, by and through counsel, shall \nmove for entry of the Judgment, including, among other things, the releases described herein. \n16 \n\nX.  WAIVER OR TERMINATION \n31.  Plaintiffs or Defendant shall have the option to terminate the Settlement in its \nentirety by providing written notice of their election to do so (“Termination Notice”), through \ncounsel, to counsel for all other Parties hereto, within fourteen (14) calendar days of: (i) the Court’s \nrefusal to enter the Preliminary Approval Order in any material respect; (ii) the Court’s refusal to \nenter the Judgment in any material respect or an alternative judgment acceptable to the Parties with \nrespect to the Settlement; or (iii) the date upon which the Judgment or Alternative Judgment is \nvacated, modified, or reversed in any material respect by a final order of the United States Court \nof Appeals or the Supreme Court of the United States. Prior to final approval of the Settlement, \nDefendant shall have a further option, in its sole discretion, to terminate the Settlement in its \nentirety (in the same manner set forth above) if the number of Settlement Class Members who \nexclude themselves from the Class exceeds ten (10) percent of the total number of individuals who \nare provided notice. In the event the Settlement is terminated, the provisions of Section XII shall \nsurvive termination.  \n32.  Except as otherwise provided herein, in the event the Settlement is terminated in its \nentirety, the Settlement will be without prejudice, and none of its terms shall be effective or \nenforceable, except as specifically provided herein. Plaintiffs and Defendant shall be deemed to \nhave reverted to their respective status in the Litigation as of August 6, 2019, and, except as \notherwise expressly provided, the Parties shall proceed in all respects as if this Agreement and any \nrelated orders had not been entered. In such event, the fact and terms of the Term Sheet, this \nAgreement, or any aspect of the negotiations leading to this Agreement, shall not be admissible in \nthis or other litigation and shall not be used by Plaintiffs or Defendant in any court filings, \ndepositions, at trial, or otherwise. \n \n17 \n\nXI.  EFFECTIVE DATE OF SETTLEMENT \n33.  The Effective Date of the Settlement shall be the first date when all of the \nfollowing shall have occurred: \na.  entry of the Preliminary Approval Order; \nb.  entry of the Final Approval Order following notice to the Class and a \nhearing in accordance with Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; \nc.  entry of the Judgment, substantially in the form attached as Exhibit D, or \nentry of any Alternative Judgment; and \nd.  the Judgment or any Alternative Judgment has become Final. \n34.  No settlement funds will be distributed to Class Members prior to the Effective \nDate. Should the Agreement be terminated or if the Effective Date does not come to pass, any \nfunds distributed to the Settlement Administrator or Class Counsel prior to the Effective Date, \ntogether with any interest earnings or appreciation thereon, less any Taxes and Tax Expenses \npaid or due with respect to such income, and less Notice and Administration Expenses actually \nand reasonably incurred and paid or payable from the Class Settlement Amount, shall be returned \nto Defendant within fourteen (14) business days after written notification of such event in \naccordance with instructions provided by Defendant’s Counsel to Plaintiffs’ Counsel.  \nXII.  NO ADMISSION OF WRONGDOING \n35.  This Agreement does not, and is not intended to constitute, nor shall it be deemed \nto constitute, an admission by any party as to the merits, validity, or accuracy of any of the \nallegations, claims, or defenses of any other party in this case. By entering into this Agreement, \nDefendant does not admit or concede, expressly or impliedly, but rather expressly denies that it \nhas in any way violated any state or federal law, statute, ordinance, regulation, rule or executive \norder, or any obligation or duty at law or in equity. Neither the Court nor any other court has \n18 \n\nmade any findings or expressed any opinion concerning the merits, validity, or accuracy of any \nof the allegations, claims, or defenses in this case. \n36.  Nothing in this Agreement, nor any action taken in implementation thereof, nor \nany statements, discussions or communications, nor any materials prepared, exchanged, issued \nor used during the course of the mediation or negotiations leading to this Agreement, is intended \nby the Parties to, nor shall any of the foregoing, be introduced, be used, or be admissible in any \nway in this case or any other judicial, arbitral, administrative, investigative or other proceeding \nof whatsoever kind or nature as evidence that tends to prove the existence of any violation of \nstate, federal or local law.  \n37.  This Agreement does not constitute, and shall not be construed against any Parties \nor Released Parties, as an admission or concession that the consideration to be given hereunder \nrepresents the amount which could be or would have been recovered after trial.  \n38.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties, and their respective counsel, may file \nthis Settlement Agreement and the Judgment in any action that may be brought against them in \norder to support a defense or counterclaim based on principles of res judicata, collateral estoppel, \nrelease, statute of limitations, statute of repose, good-faith settlement, judgment bar or reduction, \nor any theory of claim preclusion or issue preclusion or similar defense or counterclaim, or to \neffectuate any liability protection granted them under any applicable insurance policy. The \nParties may file this Agreement and the Judgment in any action brought to enforce the terms of \nthis Agreement and the Judgment. \nXIII.  PUBLIC STATEMENTS \n39.  Plaintiffs  and  Defendant  previously  agreed  to,  and  have  issued,  a  mutually \nacceptable press release (the “Press Release”) reflecting that they have resolved the Litigation to \ntheir mutual satisfaction on terms set forth herein, subject to the Court’s approval.  \n19 \n\n40.  Plaintiffs and Defendant agree that neither they nor their counsel shall issue any \nother  written  or  electronic  press  release,  Internet  posting,  or  announcement  regarding  the \nresolution of the Litigation, including claims to be the prevailing party. To the extent that any of \nPlaintiffs, Defendant, or counsel wishes to write, speak, or post about the resolution of the \nLitigation or the underlying controversy giving rise to the Litigation, Plaintiffs and Defendant \nagree that she/he/it is free to do so as long as such statements are consistent with the Press Release \nand this Settlement Agreement, including  paragraph 41 (the “Non-Disparagement Provision”). \nThe Non-Disparagement Provision shall not extend to the Three Professors, and nothing in this \nAgreement is intended to, or shall, inhibit Plaintiffs’ rights to discuss the Three Former Professors. \nNothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent any party from making statements about \nconduct occurring after the execution of the Settlement Agreement or to prevent any party from \nmaking truthful statements to the Court in connection with the class approval process (provided, \nhowever, that Plaintiffs and Defendant agree to work cooperatively on their submissions to the \nCourt in connection with the approval process). Should either Plaintiffs or Defendant believe in \ngood faith that either has violated this provision or the Settlement Agreement including the non-\ndisparagement provision, such party shall first seek to work through the concerns with the \npurportedly offending party. In the event that a resolution cannot be reached, the aggrieved party \nmay seek enforcement by this Court and/or file suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of \nNew Hampshire seeking injunctive relief and/or monetary damages. The prevailing party, as \ndetermined by the Court, shall be entitled to its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs (to be \ndetermined by the court) jointly and severally from the offending party or parties. Plaintiffs and \nDefendant waive the right to trial by jury with regard to such a suit. Nothing in this paragraph shall \nbe construed to prevent any party from making written or oral public statements about the Three \n20 \n\nFormer Professors, who were not parties to the Litigation, are not parties to the Settlement \nAgreement, and are not covered by the Non-Disparagement Provision. \nXIV.  NON-DISPARAGEMENT \n41.  Plaintiffs and Defendant agree that each shall refrain from disparaging the others \nin any written or oral public statement or posting. For purposes of this provision, to “disparage” \nshall mean (a) to speak or write of another party in a negative or belittling way, (b) to accuse or \nplace blame upon another party for alleged conduct where the Court has made no finding of \nliability against such party, or (c) to publish or disseminate false and injurious statements that are \nderogatory of another party. To the extent that any statement is consistent with the Press Release, \nthis Settlement Agreement, or a Court order, it shall in no event be considered to violate this \nprovision. This provision is intended to protect each of Plaintiffs and Defendant and her or its \nemployees, administrators, trustees, agents, attorneys and representatives. This provision expressly \nis not intended to protect Three Professors. This provision does not prevent the Plaintiffs or \nDefendant  from  making  statements  in  the  context  of  treatment  to  therapists,  mental  health \nproviders, physicians or other health care providers; from cooperating with any law enforcement \nor regulatory investigation; from providing testimony to any court or public tribunal or from \nmaking statements based on conduct occurring after the execution of the Settlement Agreement. \nXV.  USE OF PSEUDONYMS \n42.  The Parties agree to file a joint motion requesting that the pseudonyms Jane Doe \nand Jane Doe 2 continue to be used in the public record of the Litigation, with their actual names \nfiled under permanent seal with the Court, which shall retain jurisdiction with regard to any \nissues  pertaining  thereto;  provided,  however,  that  any  putative  or  preliminarily  approved \nSettlement Class Member may seek confidential access by motion to the Court for good cause \nto the actual names of Jane Doe and/or Jane Doe 2 in order to determine whether to exclude \n21 \n\nherself from the Settlement or to object to the motion for approval of the Settlement. Any class \nmember to whom the identity of any Jane Doe Plaintiff is disclosed must affirm that she will not \ndisclose the identity of any Jane Doe Plaintiff to any other person. The Parties agree that Jane Doe \n3 will be permitted to proceed under the existing pseudonym.  \nXVI.  MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS \n43.  The Parties agree that no Party was or is a “prevailing party” in the Litigation. \n44.  All of the exhibits attached to this Agreement are material and integral parts \nhereof and are fully incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. Notwithstanding \nthe foregoing, in the event that there exists a conflict or inconsistency between the terms of this \nAgreement and the terms of any exhibit attached hereto, the terms of this Agreement shall \ngovern. \n45.  This Agreement may not be modified or amended, nor may any of its provisions \nbe waived, except by a writing signed by counsel or a representative for all of the Parties (or \ntheir  successors-in-interest)  materially  and  adversely  affected  by  any  such  modification, \namendment, or waiver. \n46.  The headings herein are used for the purpose of convenience only and are not \nmeant to have legal effect. \n47.  The Parties agree that the terms of the Settlement were negotiated at arm’s length, \nin good faith by the Parties, and reflect a settlement that was reached voluntarily based upon \nadequate information and after consultation with experienced legal counsel.  \n48.  The waiver by one Party of any breach of this Agreement by any other Party shall \nnot be deemed a waiver of any other prior or subsequent breach of this Agreement. \n49.  Any allocation of compensation to Jane Doe 3 shall be from the Class Settlement \nAmount in accordance with Paragraph 19. \n22 \n\n50.  This Agreement and its exhibits constitute the entire agreement among the Parties, \nand no representations, warranties, or inducements have been made to any Party concerning this \nAgreement or its exhibits, other than the representations, warranties, and covenants contained \nand memorialized in such documents. \n51.  This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, including by \nsignature transmitted via facsimile, or by a .pdf/.tif image of the signature page transmitted via \ne-mail. All executed counterparts and each of them shall be deemed to be one and the same \ninstrument. Signatures that are electronic, scanned, faxed, photographed, photocopied, and/or \nemailed shall be considered as valid as an original written signature. \n52.  By entering into the Settlement, Plaintiffs represent and warrant that they have \nnot assigned, hypothecated, conveyed, transferred, or otherwise granted or given any interest in \nthe Released Claims, or any of them, to any other Person except as described in the attached \nexhibits. \n53.  This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the successors \nand assigns of the Parties hereto. \n54.

Faculty  \no  Dartmouth appreciates the benefits of including a broad range of voices in \nconversations focused on building a safe and supportive environment for all.   \no  The Provost’s Diversity Recruitment Fund (part of Inclusive Excellence and \nC3I) is an incentive fund that supports the deans in hiring diverse candidates \nregardless of field of research. This fund is a cost-sharing mechanism whereby \nthe Provost provides resources that enable individual deans to accelerate the \nrate of hiring of talented faculty candidates at all levels, with a particular \nemphasis on junior faculty. \no  As a good faith effort to broaden Dartmouth’s scholarly base in this area, \nDartmouth will expand the use of this fund to include supporting the hiring of \ncandidates with expertise in gender and racial discrimination and violence at \nany level (i.e, junior or senior faculty).  Specifically,  Dartmouth will (a) \nprovide an additional $ 1M total to this fund to be drawn upon over the next \n10 years, and (b) expand the allowable use of the Provost’s Diversity \nRecruitment Fund to support the hiring of faculty with expertise in gender and \nracial discrimination and violence.   \no  Use of this funding, specifically data on hiring and retention of faculty \nscholars hired through this initiative, will be reported annually as part of C3I. \n2.  External Advisory Committee   \no  Dartmouth’s External Advisory Committee (EAC), established as part of the \nCampus Climate and Culture Initiative (C3I) that was launched in January \n2019, is intended to provide the independent external oversight of the progress \nof C3I, including by commenting on the adequacy of existing programmatic \nelements and the potential addition of others, and progress in hiring faculty, \nthat the plaintiffs rightly note is an important element in honestly assessing \nprogress and making programmatic changes as needed to ensure goals are \nultimately met. \no  Because of this mission, two current members of the EAC were appointed \nbecause of their professional expertise and specifically because they have no \nties to Dartmouth.  \no  In the spirit of providing additional independent oversight, Dartmouth will \nadd two additional members to the EAC, and will select individuals who have \nno connection, alumni or otherwise, to Dartmouth.   \no  Plaintiffs and Dartmouth will jointly propose nominees for these positions to \nthe EAC.  \no  The EAC, as part of its annual review of progress in the C3I initiative, will be \nasked to assess Dartmouth’s current policies and procedures, and recommend \n\nchanges as needed.  The EAC will also be asked to recommend whether other \nmechanisms to solicit input and feedback from the broadest cross-section of \nthe community are needed, and will be asked to recommend whether other \nadvisory structures (e.g, a separate internal-external Advisory Board) would \nbetter advance the goals of C3I. \no  Within the next six months, as part of an on-campus visit, the EAC shall \nparticipate in a meeting with the Plaintiffs, who may each choose whether to \nattend in person or remotely, and who may choose whether to submit a \nproposed agenda in advance.  The purpose of this meeting will be for the \nPlaintiffs to recommend strategies, resources, and/or sources of expertise, and \nto share any information in any format they believe might be relevant to C3I. \n  \no  In addition, the Provost shall schedule a meeting with the Plaintiffs, before \nand/or after their meeting with the EAC, to ensure continuing dialogue and \nfeedback on the implementation of these programmatic measures. \n3.  WISE Partnership \n•  C3I as announced in January 2019 commits to reviewing and expanding, as needed, \nDartmouth’s partnership with WISE.  As part of that partnership, and to marshal the \nbenefits of WISE and the College’s Title IX Office’s respective expertise and \nexperience, Dartmouth in conjunction with the EAC will review the WISE \npartnership and determine within one year of this settlement whether (a) adding \nadditional WISE staff on campus, or (b) as an alternative, providing $500 K (total) in \nsupport to WISE over a 5 year period, would be the preferable mechanism for \nadvocacy and support.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT B \n \n\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nDISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE \n \nKRISTINA RAPUANO, VASSIKI  )   \nCHAUHAN, SASHA BRIETZKE,  )   \nANNEMARIE BROWN, ANDREA  )   \nCOURTNEY, MARISSA EVANS, JANE  )   \nDOE, JANE DOE 2, AND JANE DOE 3,  )   \n  )   \nPlaintiffs,  )  Civil Action No. 1:18-cv-01070-LM \n  ) \nv.  ) \n  ) \nTRUSTEES OF DARTMOUTH  ) \nCOLLEGE,  ) \n  ) \nDefendant.  ) \n \n[PROPOSED] ORDER PRELIMINARILY APPROVING CLASS  \nSETTLEMENT AND PROVIDING FOR NOTICE \n \nWHEREAS: \nA.

The Court, having considered the Agreement, the Exhibits thereto, the Plaintiffs’ \nMotion for Preliminary Certification of Settlement Class and Preliminary Approval of Settlement, \nthe Plaintiffs’  proposed Notice of Pendency of Class Action and Proposed Settlement  (the \n“Notice”), and submissions made relating thereto, finds that substantial and sufficient grounds \nexist for entering this Order; and  \nC.  The Class Representatives seek entry of this Order, which Defendant does not \noppose. \nNOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, that: \n1.  The Court, for the purposes of this Order, adopts all the defined terms as set forth \nin the Agreement unless otherwise defined herein. \n2.  Pursuant to Rule 23(a) and (b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and for \nthe purposes of settlement only, the Action is hereby preliminarily certified as a class action \ncomposed of the following individuals: \na.  All current and former women graduate students at Dartmouth who meet \nany of the following criteria: \ni.    Between  April  1,  2012  and  August  31,  2017  were  graduate \nadvisees of one of more of Todd Heatherton, William Kelley, and/or Paul Whalen \n(collectively “the Three Professors”);  \nii.    Between April 1, 2012 and August 31, 2017 were teaching or \nresearch assistants for one or more of the Three Professors;  \niii.  Were graduate students in the Psychological and Brain Sciences \nDepartment who, between April 1, 2012 and August 31, 2017, (i) co-authored at \nleast one paper with one or more of the Three Former Professors based on research \n2 \n\n \nphysically conducted in the lab during that time period, or (ii) co-authored at least \nthree papers with one or more of the Three Former Professors; OR \niv.    Were graduate students in the Psychological and Brain Sciences \nDepartment between March 31, 2015 and August 31, 2017 who do not fit within \ncategories (i)-(iii), but who will attest that they experienced dignitary, emotional, \neducational  and/or  professional  harm  during  this  period  as  a  result  of  the \nmisconduct of one or more of the Three Professors. \nb.  All current and former women undergraduate students at Dartmouth who, \nbetween April 1, 2012 and August 31, 2017, worked as research assistants for one or more \nof the Three Former Professors. As used herein, “research assistants” includes individuals \nworking on an honors thesis or independent research study in one or more of the Three \nFormer Professors’ labs.  \n3.  This Court finds, preliminary and for purposes of settlement only, that as to the \nSettlement Class, the prerequisites for a class action under Rules 23(a) and (b)(3) of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure have been satisfied in that: (a) the number of Settlement Class Members \nis sufficiently numerous that joinder of all members of the Settlement Class is impracticable; (b) \nthere are questions of law and fact common to the Settlement Class; (c) the claims of the Class \nRepresentatives are typical of the claims of the Settlement Class they seek to represent; (d) the \nClass Representatives and Class Counsel fairly and adequately represent the interests of the \nSettlement Class; (e) questions of law and fact common to the Settlement Class predominate over \nany questions affecting only individual members of the Settlement Class; and (f) a class action, \nconsidered in the context of the Settlement, is superior to other available methods for the fair and \nefficient adjudication of the Litigation. \n3 \n\n \n4.  Pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, preliminarily and for \nthe purposes of settlement only, the Class Representatives are certified as the class representatives \non behalf of the Settlement Class and Class Counsel is hereby appointed as the class counsel for \nthe Settlement Class. \n5.  The Court finds that the Agreement was the product of good faith, arm’s-length \nnegotiations and that the Agreement is fair and reasonable to the Settlement Class Members such \nthat providing notice of the Settlement to Settlement Class Members and holding a Fairness \nHearing are warranted. \n6.  Accordingly, the Court preliminarily approves the Settlement on the terms set forth \nin the Agreement, subject to further consideration at the final approval hearing (the “Fairness \nHearing”) to be held before this Court on _____, 2019, at __:__ _.m., at the United States District \nCourt for the District of New Hampshire, 55 Pleasant Street, Concord, New Hampshire 03301, \nCourtroom __.  The purpose of the Fairness Hearing will be: \na.  to determine whether the proposed Agreement is fair, reasonable, and \nadequate and should be finally approved by the Court; \nb.  to determine whether the Judgment, substantially in the form attached as \nExhibit D to the Agreement, should be entered, dismissing the Litigation with prejudice, \nand forever releasing the Claims against the Released Parties as set forth in the Agreement; \nc.  to  determine  whether  the  proposed  Plan  of  Allocation  for  the  Class \nSettlement Amount is fair and reasonable and should be approved by the Court; \nd.  to determine whether the application by Class Counsel for an award of \nattorneys’ fees and reimbursement of litigation expenses incurred should be approved; and \ne.  to rule upon such other matters as the Court may deem appropriate \n4 \n\n \n7.  Pending further order of the Court, all litigation activity, except that contemplated \nherein, in the Agreement, or in the Notice, remains enjoined and stayed and all hearings, deadlines, \nand other proceedings in this Litigation, excepting the Fairness Hearing, are hereby taken off the \ncalendar.   \n8.  The Court approves the form, substance, and requirements of the Notice, and finds \nthat  the  procedures  established  for  publication,  mailing,  and  distribution  of  such  Notices \nsubstantially in the manner and form proposed by Class Counsel constitute the best notice \npracticable under the circumstances and are in full compliance with the notice requirements of due \nprocess and Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Under no circumstances shall any \nSettlement Class Member be relieved from the terms of the Agreement, including the release \nprovided for therein, based upon the contention or proof that such Settlement Class Member failed \nto receive adequate or actual notice. \n9.  Class Counsel shall cause the Notice, substantially in the form attached hereto as \nExhibit X, to be [insert mode of distribution] to all Settlement Class Members, on or before [ten \n(10)] business days after this Order is entered.  Defendant shall cooperate reasonably with Class \nCounsel in identifying Settlement Class Members.  The Notice shall also be posted on the Claims \nAdministrator’s website. \n10.  Class Counsel shall, at or before the Fairness hearing, file with the Court proof of \ndissemination by [mail/email/text] of the Notice. \n11.  The  Court  approves  the  selection  of  [insert]  by  Class  Counsel  as  Claims \nAdministrator.  The Court approves payment of the Claims’ Administrators’ reasonable fees and \nexpenses to be taxed against the Class Settlement Amount. \n5 \n\n \n12.  In compliance with the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, 28 U.S.C. §§ 1332(d), \n1453, and 1711-1715 (“CAFA”), the Defendant will serve any documents required by the CAFA \non the United States Attorney General and the Attorney Generals for the States where Settlement \nClass Members reside, unless such service is already completed at the time this Order is issued. \n13.  Class Counsel shall submit its papers in support of final approval of the Agreement, \nthe Plan of Allocation, and the application for attorneys’ fees and reimbursement of litigation \nexpenses and Class Representatives’ request for a compensatory award by no later than [X] \ncalendar days before the Fairness Hearing, and any reply papers in support thereof by no later than \n[X] calendar days before the Fairness hearing. \n14.  Settlement Class Members shall be bound by all determinations and the judgment \nin this Litigation, whether favorable or unfavorable, unless such Person requests exclusion from \nthe Settlement Class in a timely and proper manner.  A Settlement Class Member wishing to make \nsuch an exclusion request must do so in accordance with the procedures in the Class Notice and \nmust do so by ________, which is sixty (60) days after the Notice Deadline. Such request for \nexclusion shall clearly indicate the name, address, and telephone number of the Person seeking \nexclusion, state that the sender requests to be excluded from the Settlement Class in the Litigation, \nand must be signed by such Person.  The request for exclusion shall not be effective unless it \nprovides the required information and is made within the time stated above, or the exclusion is \notherwise accepted by the Court. \n15.  Any  Settlement  Class  Member  who  has  not  requested  exclusion  from  the \nSettlement Class may, no later than [X] days before the Fairness Hearing, serve by hand, U.S. \nmail, or by overnight delivery written objections setting forth the basis therefor, and copies of any \nsupporting papers and briefs upon the Settlement Administrator [insert address], and Defendant’s \n6 \n\n \nCounsel, Joan A. Lukey, Choate, Hall & Stewart LLP, Two International Place, Boston MA, \n02110.   Any Settlement Class Member who has submitted such a written objection in accordance \nwith these terms may appear at the Fairness Hearing to show cause why the Agreement should not \nbe approved as fair, reasonable, and adequate; why the Judgment should not be entered thereon; \nwhy the Plan of Allocation should not be approved as fair and reasonable; why Class Counsel’s \napplication for an award of attorneys’ fees and reimbursement of litigation expenses should not be \ngranted;  or  why  Class  Representatives’  application  for  service  award(s)  should  be  denied, \nprovided, however, that no Settlement Class Member shall be heard or entitled to contest the \napproval of the terms and conditions of the proposed Agreement, the Judgment to be entered \napproving the same, the Plan of Allocation, or the attorneys’ fees and reimbursement of litigation \nexpenses requested, unless she has submitted a written objection in accordance with the terms of \nthis Order.  \n16.  Any objection must include (a) the full name, address, email address if available, \nand phone number of the objecting Settlement Class Member, (b) a written statement of all grounds \nfor the objection accompanied by any legal support for the objection, (c) copies of any papers, \nbriefs, or other documents upon which the objection is based, (d) a list of all persons who will be \ncalled to testify in support of the objection, (e) a statement of whether the objector intends to appear \nat the Fairness Hearing, and (f) a list of any other objections that the Settlement Class Member or \nher lawyer has made to any class action settlements submitted to any court in the United States in \nthe previous five years.  Class Counsel will be responsible for promptly filing with the Court and \nserving on all parties any objections or comments received. \n17.  Any Settlement Class Member who does not object in the manner prescribed above \nshall be deemed to have waived such objection and shall forever be foreclosed from making any \n7 \n\n \nobjection to the fairness, adequacy, or reasonableness of the Agreement, the Judgment to be \nentered approving the Agreement, the fairness and reasonableness of the Plan of Allocation, or the \nattorneys’ fees and reimbursement of litigation expenses requested.  By objecting, or otherwise \nrequesting to be heard at the Fairness Hearing, a Person shall be deemed to have submitted to the \njurisdiction of the Court with respect to the Settlement. \n18.  The Court preliminarily approves the Plan of Allocation set forth in the Settlement. \nUnder this Plan, in the event the Agreement is effected in accordance with all the terms and \nconditions thereof, each Settlement Class Member will automatically receive a base award and \nwill be eligible for a supplementary award by submitting a Claim Form to  the Settlement \nAdministrator. Individuals who come within subsection (a)(iv) of the class definition are not \nmembers of the Class and will not receive an award unless they attest to experiencing harm by \nsubmitting a Claim Form or equivalent written document. \n19.  The administration of the proposed Agreement and the determination of all disputed \nquestions of law and fact with respect to the validity of any claim or right of any Person to \nparticipate in the distribution of the Class Settlement Amount shall be under the jurisdiction of this \nCourt. \n20.  The Court expressly reserves the right (a) to adjourn or continue the Fairness \nHearing without any further notice to Settlement Class Members other than an announcement at \nthe Fairness Hearing, and (b) to approve the Agreement and/or the Plan of Allocation with \nmodification without further notice to Settlement Class Members. \n21.  This Order should not be construed as, or deemed to be, evidence of a presumption, \nimplication, concession, or admission by Defendant concerning any alleged liability, fault, or \nwrongdoing, or the appropriateness of any measure of alleged loss or damages. \n8 \n\n \n22.  In  the  event  that  the  Agreement  and  Judgment  do  not  become  Final  or  the \nAgreement is terminated as provided in the Agreement, then this Preliminary Approval Order shall \nbe rendered null and void to the extent provided by and in accordance with the Agreement, and \nshall be vacated to the extent provided by the Agreement, and, in such event:  (a) all Orders entered \nand releases delivered in connection herewith shall be null and void to the extent provided by and \nin accordance with the Agreement; (b) the fact of the Agreement shall not be admissible in any \ntrial of the Action and the parties to the Agreement shall be deemed to have reverted nunc pro tunc \nto their respective status in the Action immediately before [date], except for purposes of enforcing \nthe relevant portions of the Agreement; and (c) within [X] days of entry of the Final order rendering \nthe Agreement and Judgment non-Final or notice of the Agreement being terminated, all monies \npreviously paid from the Class Settlement Amount, including interest but less any costs or \nexpenses  properly  incurred  and  approved  by  the  Court,  shall  be  immediately  returned  to \nDefendant.  Under those circumstances, Class Counsel shall undertake to return those amounts to \nDefendant by taking all steps reasonably necessary to cause the monies to be repaid. \n23.

(“Title IX”). \n2 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 3 of 72\nI.  INTRODUCTION  \n  Dartmouth College has knowingly permitted three of its prominent (and well-\nfunded) professors to turn a human behavior research department into a 21st Century Animal \nHouse. For well over a decade, female students in Dartmouth’s Department of Psychology and \nBrain Sciences (the “Department”) have been treated as sex objects by tenured professors Todd \nHeatherton,  William  Kelley,  and  Paul  Whalen.  These  professors  leered  at,  groped,  sexted, \nintoxicated, and even raped female students. \n  These professors ensured the young women in the Department were vulnerable to \nthis sexual harassment by conditioning faculty mentorship and support on students’ participation \nin the alcohol-saturated “party culture” they perpetuated. Among other things, these professors \nconducted professional lab meetings at bars, invited students to late-night “hot tub parties” in their \npersonal homes, and invited undergraduate students to use real cocaine during classes related to \naddiction as part of a “demonstration.” \n  Dartmouth has known about bad behavior by these professors for more than sixteen \nyears. Dartmouth’s supervisory faculty, administrators, officers, and employees (such agents, \nunless referred to by name or position, hereinafter referred to as “Dartmouth”) have received \ncomplaints  of  pervasive  sexual  harassment  and  gender-based  discrimination  perpetuated  by \nProfessors Heatherton, Kelley, and Whalen since at least 2002. But Dartmouth did nothing and \nignored these complaints, thereby ratifying the violent and criminal acts of its professors. \n  In early April 2017, a group of female graduate students, determined to end the \nintolerable  conditions  in  which  they  and  others  were  forced  to  work  and  study,  contacted \nDartmouth’s Title IX office and detailed instances of sexual assault and sexual harassment by these \nthree professors. \n3 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 4 of 72\n  Dartmouth did nothing. As a result, Professor Whalen sexually assaulted Plaintiff \nChauhan twenty days later. At Dartmouth’s suggestion, Plaintiffs and the other women in the \nDepartment continued working with or among the accused professors for nearly four months. The \nsexual harassment continued unabated. \n   Over several months, at least 27 complainants came forward to participate in the \nTitle IX investigation. In October 2017, Dartmouth was forced to publicly disclose the existence \nof the investigation for the very first time after the news was leaked to the media. Days later, on \nOctober 31, 2017, the New Hampshire Attorney General opened a criminal investigation into the \nallegations against the three professors. \n  Dartmouth  eventually  hired  an  outside  attorney  to  conduct  an  “independent \ninvestigation”  in  which  Plaintiffs  were  told  they  would  have  a  voice.  Instead,  Dartmouth \nunilaterally stopped the investigation and allowed the three professors to retire and/or resign in \nJuly 2018, more than fifteen months after Plaintiffs filed their initial complaints. \n  The seven Plaintiffs, each an exemplary female scientist at the start of her career, \ncame to Dartmouth to contribute to a crucial and burgeoning field of academic study. Plaintiffs \nwere instead sexually harassed and sexually assaulted by the Department’s tenured professors and \nexpected to tolerate increasing levels of sexual predation.  \n  Plaintiffs now turn to this Court for appropriate relief to remedy Dartmouth’s past \nwrongs and to force Dartmouth College to enact meaningful reforms that will permit women to \nengage in rigorous scientific study without fear of being sexually harassed and sexually assaulted. \nII.  PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE \n  PLAINTIFF KRISTINA RAPUANO is a natural person who, at all relevant \ntimes, was domiciled in Vermont. \n4 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 5 of 72\n  PLAINTIFF VASSIKI CHAUHAN is a natural person who, at all relevant times, \nwas domiciled in New Hampshire. \n  PLAINTIFF SASHA BRIETZKE is a natural person who, at all relevant times, \nwas domiciled in Vermont. \n  PLAINTIFF ANNEMARIE BROWN is a natural person who, at all relevant \ntimes, was domiciled in New Hampshire or Vermont. \n  PLAINTIFF ANDREA COURTNEY is a natural person who, at all relevant \ntimes, was domiciled in New Hampshire or Vermont. \n  PLAINTIFF MARISSA EVANS is a natural person who, at all relevant times, \nwas domiciled in New Hampshire. \n  PLAINTIFF JANE DOE is a natural person who, at all relevant times, was \ndomiciled in New Hampshire. \n  DEFENDANT DARTMOUTH COLLEGE is a non-profit corporation organized \nand existing under the laws of New Hampshire that maintains its principal place of business at 63 \nSouth Main Street, Suite 301 Hanover, NH 03755, in this District. \n  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ \n1331 and 1343, because Plaintiffs’ statutory claims under Title IX present a federal question over \nwhich this Court has jurisdiction. Plaintiffs also assert state-law claims over which this Court has \nsupplemental jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367. \n  This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendant pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n4(k)(1)(a) because Defendant is domiciled in and conducts business within this Judicial District. \n  This Court is the proper venue under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) and 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e-\n5(f) because Dartmouth is headquartered in this District and many of the unlawful practices \n5 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 6 of 72\ncomplained of herein occurred in this District, and the events or omissions giving rise to Plaintiffs’ \nclaims occurred in this District.  \nIII.  COMMON FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  The Department’s Predators’ Club  \n  Dartmouth College is an elite Ivy League private research university located in the \ntown of Hanover, New Hampshire. Dartmouth has an enrollment of 6,400 students and is one of \nthe nation’s most competitive colleges, with an undergraduate acceptance rate of 8.7%. \n  The  conduct  at  issue  involved  three  celebrated  Dartmouth  professors  in  the \nDepartment, which is considered a “powerhouse” for research and innovation at Dartmouth. The \nDepartment is housed in a state-of-the-art $27 million building and Dartmouth was the first liberal \narts school in the country to have its own fMRI scanner to conduct brain scans. \n  The most senior member and arguably the founder of the three-member “predatory \nclub” that harassed female students was Todd Heatherton. Heatherton was a prolific researcher \nwho received Dartmouth’s prestigious Champion International Professorship endowed chair and \nserved as the Department Chair from 2004 through 2005. Heatherton was instrumental in making \nthe Department a major power center on campus by, among other things, helping to attract what \nwas as of 2005 the largest grant in Dartmouth’s history—$21.8 million to establish a center for \ncognitive and educational neuroscience. \n  The predatory club was filled out by two younger brain science scholars who joined \nin Heatherton’s pattern of harassment of female students in the Department. William Kelley joined \nthe Department in 2000 and Paul Whalen joined in 2005. Both Whalen and Kelley received tenure \nthrough the Department, even as three promising female professors did not. All three female \n6 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 7 of 72\nprofessors  went  on  to  receive  tenure,  prestigious  awards  and  great  success—but  at  other \ninstitutions.  \n  Upon information and belief, Heatherton was instrumental in helping both Kelley \nand Whalen obtain tenure and, once that happened, the three men frequently socialized and \nregularly gathered with each other’s female graduate students at bars in Hanover. \nB.  Dartmouth Ignores Decades of Complaints \n  The  pervasive  sexual  harassment  and  gender-based  discrimination  in  the \nDepartment perpetuated by Heatherton, Kelley, and Whalen was well-known to Dartmouth’s \nsupervisory faculty and administrators since at least 2002. \n  At least two sexual harassment complaints were made against Heatherton in a 12-\nmonth span in 2002. In lieu of responding appropriately to either complaint, Dartmouth rewarded \nProfessor  Heatherton,  first  naming  him  Champion  International  Professor  (after  the  initial \ncomplaint)  and  subsequently  promoting  him  to  Chair  of  the  Department  (after  the  second \ncomplaint). \n  The first complaint arose from an incident that occurred during a public recruiting \nevent for the Department in February 2002. Heatherton grabbed a female graduate student’s \nbreasts and told her that she was “not doing very well” in her work in the lab. The incident was \nreported to Dartmouth’s administration, including then-Associate Dean Richard Wright.3 Not long \nafter the report, Dartmouth appointed Heatherton as Champion International Professor. \n  The second complaint stemmed from an incident that occurred in late 2002 or early \n2003, when Heatherton groped the buttocks of two graduate students, one male and one female, \n                                                      \n3 See Britta Greene, Former Professor: Dartmouth Aware of Misconduct Allegations For Years, SLATE (Nov. 16, \n2017),  available  at  http://www.nhpr.org/post/former-professor-dartmouth-aware-misconduct-allegations-\nyears#stream/0. \n \n7 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 8 of 72\nwhom he approached from behind at a bar. The female graduate student reported this incident to \nthen-Department Chair Howard Hughes (“former Chair Hughes”). In response, former Chair \nHughes encouraged the female graduate student not to “make a fuss” by pursuing the matter \nfurther. Dartmouth then promoted Heatherton to Chair of the Department. \n  Upon information and belief, a complaint relating to sexual harassment and sex \ndiscrimination was filed against Kelley and Heatherton in 2005. Upon information and belief, \nDartmouth failed to take disciplinary action against either professor. \n  Upon information and belief, Professor and Director of Graduate Studies Thalia \nWheatley  (“Director  Wheatley”),  Department  Chair  Dave  Bucci  (“Chair  Bucci”),  and \nadministrators with supervisory authority knew about discriminatory hiring practices within the \nDepartment. Heatherton, Kelley, and Whalen demonstrated an obvious bias toward hiring young, \nattractive female students to work in their labs. Kelley and Whalen treated this endeavor as a \ncompetition and openly debated who had “the hottest lab.” Female students in the Department \nwere pressured to appease the professors by flirting with them. Women ultimately felt that their \nlooks were significant in their being hired rather than their academic achievements. \n  Heatherton, Kelley, and Whalen tied female students’ academic success to the \nstudents’ willingness to tolerate unwanted sexual attention. All three professors favored students \nwho accompanied the men on their frequent drinking binges and engaged in sexual banter or \nsubmitted to unwanted touching and sexual contact. \n  Heatherton, Kelley, and Whalen compelled female students to be objectified and to \nobjectify their female classmates. All three men made inappropriate comments about the students’ \nphysical attractiveness, including explicit references to their breasts. Kelley went so far as to \npublicly “rank” women on  a “Papi” scale by which a “0” rating meant he “would never bang” \n8 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 9 of 72\nunder any circumstances, a “1” rating meant “hot enough that you would bang her if her personality \nwas excellent,” and a “2” rating meant “so hot you would bang her no matter what she was like.”   \n  Upon information and belief, Director Wheatley, Chair Bucci, and administrators \nwith  supervisory  authority  knew  that  Heatherton,  Kelley,  and  Whalen  routinely  injected \nthemselves into the sexual lives of their female students, such as taking “bets” on how long female \nstudents could make their relationships last and advising their female students to “just screw” other \nmembers of the lab. \n  Heatherton,  Kelley,  and  Whalen  mostly  ignored  personal  and  professional \nboundaries.  Kelley  regularly  accessed  students’  cell  phones  without  permission  and  sent \ninappropriate messages from the students’ phones to others. Whalen demanded that his highly \neducated students act as his personal masseuses and “walk on his back,” an activity which he \nclaimed his previous students did for him regularly. Whalen also went “shopping” with his female \nstudents, offering to purchase them dresses and shoes he selected for them. \n  Kelley  and  Whalen  openly  conducted  sexual  relationships  with  their  female \nstudents. Upon information and belief, Dartmouth administrators with supervisory authority knew \nKelley and Whalen were involved in these inappropriate relationships. \n  The Department’s faculty have described Dartmouth as “the capital of sexism” and \nlikened the Department to a fraternity house of which Kelley, Whalen, and Heatherton were self-\nappointed co-presidents.  \n  Numerous Dartmouth administrators, including Associate Dean Jay Hull (“Dean \nHull”), Chair Bucci, and current and former students described Whalen as being “touchy,” “a flirt,” \n“a hugger,” and “handsy.” Chair Bucci further acknowledged that he observed Whalen blurring \nprofessional boundaries, or to be “completely lacking” in them. Indeed, over the last decade, \n9 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 10 of 72\nformer faculty members informed Dartmouth’s administration that they were concerned about \nmisconduct by Kelley, Heatherton, and Whalen. \nC.  Dartmouth Fails to Stop the Predators’ Club from Pressuring Female Students into \n“Black Out” Binge Drinking and Unwanted Physical and Sexual Contact                               \n \n  On top of the sexual harassment women in the Department endured, they were also \nforced to reckon with the fact that Heatherton, Kelley, and Whalen conditioned faculty mentorship \nand support on student participation in the alcohol-saturated “party culture” they created. This \npractice was both well-known and blatantly ignored by Dartmouth administrators. \n  Examples of the Department’s “party culture” abound. Kelley bragged to his \nstudents that he snorted real cocaine in class during demonstrations related to addiction. Kelley, \nWhalen, and Heatherton openly took shots of alcohol with underage prospective students. When \nhiring undergraduates to work in his lab, Kelley sometimes scheduled the interviews to take place \nat bars and purchased drinks for the underage interviewees. Associate Dean Hull was specifically \naware of Kelley and Whalen’s “tradition” of taking prospective female students out drinking, \npurportedly to observe how the students “handled themselves” while drunk, but did nothing to \ninvestigate or stop it. \n  The three predatory professors pressured their young female graduate students to \naccompany them to local bars and other places to engage in binge drinking. All three professors \npurchased drinks for their female students and encouraged them to drink late into the night. The \nprofessors then regaled their lab members with tales of their alcohol-fueled exploits with other \nstudents, describing how those students got drunk, became ill, and made fools of themselves. \n  Kelley regularly hosted “hot tub parties” and other parties at his house, which has \na fully outfitted bar in the basement. These parties, for which Kelley coined the term “tubby time,” \noften took place late at night after drinking at bars. Not to be outdone, Whalen hosted numerous \n10 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 11 of 72\nparties at his residence centered around drinking excessively. Both Kelley and Whalen encouraged \ntheir female students to spend the night at their homes after long nights of drinking. \n  The lab environment was no less free from pressure to consume alcohol. Lab \nmeetings and one-on-one advising meetings often took place at bars. On the occasions when \nmeetings did take place in the labs, the professors often expected that alcohol be served. Students \nwere flown to conferences across the country and then urged to skip conference events to drink \nwith the professors in bars. Whalen rescheduled important qualifying exams and meetings because \nhe needed to “recover” from binge drinking over the weekend or “get laid.”  \n  Female students who were willing to partake in these activities were rewarded with \nacademic attention, while those who refrained were ignored and neglected academically. Kelley \npublicly labeled one female student “a bitch” for refusing to participate in drinking events. \n  Associate Dean Hull and Director Wheatley confirmed that they both received \nnumerous complaints from graduate students who felt pressured to drink alcohol and socialize with \nKelley and Whalen, and feared retaliation if they refrained from these activities. \n  Instead of acting on their knowledge, Dartmouth administrators emboldened the \npredators’ club to continue their harassment and abusive conduct toward female students without \nfear of punishment. This attitude was on full display when, during the 2010-2011 academic year, \nWhalen announced to his students that a woman in the Department had previously complained \nabout sexual harassment and that it had “backfired,” causing the complainant to “lose resources” \nand to “lose steam in her career.” According to Whalen, the complainant “got what was coming to \nher, of course; you don’t bite the hand that feeds you.” \n  In the three years preceding April 2017, sexual harassment and abuse of female \nstudents became intolerable and students’ complaints became louder. Within that timeframe, \n11 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 12 of 72\ngraduate students repeatedly spoke out about inappropriate student/advisor relationships during \nannual meetings attended by high-level administrators, including but not limited to Dean Hull, \nDirector Wheatley, and Chair Bucci. Upon information and belief, these administrators were \ninformed that multiple students were attending therapy because of their advisors. One graduate \nstudent explicitly told these administrators that this was a “life or death situation,” and someone \nwould commit suicide if Dartmouth refused to act.  \nD.  As Harassment Grows Intolerable, Female Students Band Together to End the \nHarassment and Abuse \n \n  On January 13, 2017, Ms. Rapuano contacted Provost Carolyn Dever (“Provost \nDever”) to report that she was experiencing sexual harassment at Dartmouth and had realized this \nwas  a  pervasive  issue.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Provost  Dever  failed  to  launch  any \ninvestigation of her own and took no steps to protect Ms. Rapuano or other students from sexual \nharassment. \n  In or about late March 2017, several female graduate students came together to \ndiscuss the harassment and abuse they were experiencing in the Department. With no assistance \nfrom Dartmouth, the students researched their legal options, sought support and guidance from \nadvocates and determined that filing a Title IX complaint against the three professors was the best \nfirst step. \n  On April 4, 2017, Ms. Rapuano, Ms. Courtney, and several other graduate students \nmet with Chair Bucci and Director Wheatley to report sexual harassment and sexual assault within \nthe Department. On April 7, 2017, the same group met with Dartmouth’s Title IX coordinator. The \nstudents outlined instances of sexual assault and sexual harassment so extreme as to constitute a \nsexually hostile educational environment and work place, inappropriate conduct, and retaliation \nby Kelley, Whalen, and Heatherton. \n12 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 13 of 72\n  Dartmouth took no immediate action to protect the students who complained. \nWhalen sexually assaulted Ms. Chauhan twenty days after the Title IX complaint was filed, and \nKelley continued to sexually harass Ms. Rapuano through June 2017. \n  Even after these serious complaints were lodged, Dartmouth actually encouraged \nthe victims to continue working with or among Heatherton, Kelley, and Whalen. Dartmouth \nwarned  the  victims  that  the  accused  professors  would  likely  retaliate  against  students  who \ndiscontinued working with them by disparaging them and revoking their academic support, actions \nwhich could result in the victims being expelled or placed on academic probation. Thus, at \nDartmouth’s suggestion, the victims continued working with their harassers for nearly four \nmonths. \n  Dartmouth  waited  nearly  four  months  before  notifying  Kelley,  Whalen,  and \nHeatherton of Plaintiffs’ complaints (on July 20, 2017) and placing them on administrative leave \n(on July 28, 2017). \n  Dartmouth released no information about the three professors’ status even after they \nwere  placed  on  leave.  Concerned  about  the  situation  and  the  College’s  lack  of  candor, \nundergraduate students posted flyers around campus on October 24, 2017, asking “Where is Prof. \nPaul Whalen?” and “Where is Prof. Bill Kelley?” The College newspaper, The Dartmouth, \nreported on the flyers, and a College spokesperson said only that the three professors were on paid \nleave and under “ongoing investigations into allegations of serious misconduct[.]” \n  On October 31, 2017, the New Hampshire Attorney General opened a criminal \ninvestigation into the allegations against the three professors. \n  In response to  the Title  IX Complaint, Dartmouth launched  an  “independent \ninvestigation” led by Jennifer Davis, Esquire (“Investigator Davis”), an attorney and self-described \n13 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 14 of 72\n“independent investigator.” Investigator Davis is on the “approved” list of Dartmouth’s insurer, \nUnited Educators Insurance, whose focus appears to be helping institutions manage risk and \nminimize  liability  stemming  from  wrongdoing  by  employees.4  Indeed,  Investigator  Davis \nseemingly made no effort to address Dartmouth’s prior knowledge of the professors’ conduct or \nto examine Dartmouth’s role in fostering the continuing harassment Plaintiffs experienced.  \n  Investigator Davis demanded extensive confidential information from Plaintiffs, \nincluding privileged mental health records, emails, texts, pictures, and other such information. In \nseveral instances, however, Investigator Davis showed these confidential records to Heatherton, \nWhalen, and Kelley, and their attorneys without Plaintiffs’ knowledge or consent. \n  Investigator Davis also conducted numerous lengthy interviews with Plaintiffs and \nothers without advising them of their rights or encouraging them to seek legal counsel. Without \nPlaintiffs’ knowledge or consent, she then shared portions of these interviews with the perpetrators \nand their attorneys. \n  Investigator Davis and Dartmouth’s Title IX office failed to protect Plaintiffs’ \nprivacy by erroneously including one reporting party’s confidential exhibits in a different reporting \nparty’s  folder.  On  several  occasions,  email  communications  from  the  Title  IX  office  were \naddressed to the wrong person, revealing the complainant’s identity and confidential information \nto others. \n  Dartmouth included Ms. Brown as a “Reporting Party” to the complaints into \nWhalen’s conduct without Ms. Brown’s knowledge or permission. Ms. Brown learned that she \nwas a Reporting Party for the first time when she unexpectedly received a copy of the investigation \nreport along with and, most concerning, a copy of Whalen’s rebuttal to her specific allegations. \n                                                      \n4 See JENN DAVIS LLC, https://www.jenndavisllc.com/ (last visited on Nov. 13, 2018). \n14 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 15 of 72\nMs. Brown was never informed that Whalen would be permitted to  review or dispute her \nallegations.  \n  Investigator  Davis  provided  Dartmouth  with  several  reports  concerning  her \n“findings” in March 2018, eleven months after the April 2017 Title IX complaint was filed. \nPlaintiffs were provided with heavily redacted versions of the sections of the reports that pertained \nto them and given a limited opportunity to correct inaccuracies in the reports. Based on the limited \ninformation Plaintiffs received, Investigator Davis purported to “find” numerous violations of \nDartmouth’s policies and procedures by Heatherton, Kelley and Whalen. \n  Disciplinary hearings regarding the “findings” were scheduled for July 2018, and \nPlaintiffs were promised an opportunity to be heard and confront their harassers. Dartmouth then \nunilaterally suspended the disciplinary process, permitting Heatherton to retire and accepting \nresignations  from  Kelley  and  Whalen.  Plaintiffs  were  not  consulted  prior  to  Dartmouth’s \ntermination of the Title IX process. \n  Dartmouth  declined  to  provide  Plaintiffs  with  accommodations,  support  or \nguidance, both immediately following their initial complaints to the Title IX office and throughout \nthe investigation. There were three separate Title IX Coordinators while Plaintiffs’ complaint was \npending. The first of these, Heather Lindkvist, implicitly discouraged Plaintiffs from coming \nforward. \n  Since it unilaterally terminated the Title IX process, Dartmouth has taken no action \nthat would demonstrate any intent to investigate how the abuse perpetrated upon Plaintiffs could \nhave happened and/or to make any changes that would prevent it from happening again. \n  Instead, Dartmouth has taken steps to silence the victims and discourage them from \npursuing legal action or demanding change within Dartmouth. On October 12, 2018, Plaintiffs’ \n15 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 16 of 72\ncounsel sent Dartmouth a letter detailing Plaintiffs’ claims and the basis for Dartmouth’s liability \nunder Title IX and other statutes. Days later, Chair Bucci and Director Wheatley convened a \nmeeting with all graduate students in the Department. When the students arrived, they saw that the \nTitle IX Coordinator, Kristi Clemens, was also present, and Chair Bucci and Director Wheatley \nhad called this meeting to, in their words, “dispel rumors” about the Title IX investigation.  \n  It became quickly apparent that the meeting was a public platform to disparage the \nvictims and discourage them from pursuing legal action. Chair Bucci accused the victims of \n“pulling the Department backwards rather than forward” by continuing to demand change at \nDartmouth.  Chair  Bucci  and  Director  Wheatley  criticized  the  victims  for  questioning  their \ninvolvement in the facts giving rise to the Title IX complaints and said that it was “very unfair” of \nthe students to discuss the prior complaints about Heatherton and implied that these complaints \nwere irrelevant. Finally, they took pains to dispute and justify several aspects of the investigation \nthat Plaintiffs’ attorneys explicitly criticized in their October 12, 2018 letter. \n  After the departure of Heatherton, Kelley, and Whalen, Dartmouth convened a \nsearch committee to hire their replacements. Upon information and belief, 158 applications were \nsubmitted for the three positions; from these, Dartmouth’s selection committee shortlisted 11 \ncandidates. Only two of the shortlisted candidates are women.   \nIV.  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  \nA.  Kristina Rapuano’s Factual Allegations \n  Ms. Rapuano graduated in the top two percent of her undergraduate class with a \nBachelor of Science in Psychology in 2010. She enrolled in graduate studies at Dartmouth College \nin 2012, where she worked as a Ph.D. student and teaching assistant. While at Dartmouth, Ms. \nRapuano won numerous awards, recognitions, and scholarships for her performance as a graduate \n16 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 17 of 72\nstudent and as a teaching assistant. She has a strong publication record and has routinely given \ntalks and poster presentations at academic conferences across the country.  \n  On approximately March 14, 2014, Ms. Rapuano met Whalen in his office to assist \nhim in grading final exams. She returned to her office after they finished grading the exams. Soon \nafter, she received a text message from Whalen summoning her back to his office. \n  When Ms. Rapuano entered Whalen’s office, he closed the door, turned the lights \noff, sat down next to her on the couch, and proceeded to try and touch her over her clothes. \n  When Ms. Rapuano stood and tried to leave, Whalen followed her and pinned her \nagainst the wall. He then repeatedly tried to put his hands into her pants over her objections and \ndemands that he stop touching her. \n  Whalen persisted until Ms. Rapuano forcefully removed his hands from her pants. \n  Not long after this incident, Whalen told Ms. Rapuano that he had altered the curve \nfor one of his courses (for which Ms. Rapuano was the teaching assistant) so that a young woman \nin his class would receive an “A-” in the course, despite the negative impact on the other students.  \n  Kelley largely ignored Ms. Rapuano when she first began working in his lab and \nabstained from socializing or drinking with him. Leading up to and during the 2014-2015 school \nyear, Ms. Rapuano finally succumbed to Kelley’s pressure to act as his “drinking buddy.”  She \nnoticed an increase in Kelley’s interest in working with her professionally and providing her with \nacademic support. \n  In March 2015, both Ms. Rapuano and Kelley attended the annual conference of \nthe Cognitive Neuroscience Society (“CNS”) in San Francisco, California. Ms. Rapuano booked \na flight to the CNS Conference leaving on Saturday, March 28, 2015 and reserved her own hotel \nroom. When Kelley learned of Ms. Rapuano’s travel plans, he changed her flight so that she would \n17 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 18 of 72\narrive in San Francisco a day earlier, claiming that it would be better if he and Ms. Rapuano had \nmore time together at the conference. Kelley then suggested that Ms. Rapuano stay in his hotel \nroom for the night, despite knowing—and failing to inform Ms. Rapuano—that his hotel room had \njust one bed in it. \n  Kelley instructed Ms. Rapuano to meet him at the hotel bar, even though she would \nnot arrive at the hotel until nearly 12:00 a.m. After drinking at the hotel bar, Kelley urged Ms. \nRapuano to accompany him to another bar, encouraging her to continue drinking until she became \nintoxicated.  \n  Earlier in the night, Ms. Rapuano sent Kelley a text message explicitly stating that \nshe wanted to have fun but “nothing else.” Once she became inebriated, however, Kelley chose to \nignore her message that sexual contact was unwelcome.  \n  Kelley sexually assaulted Ms. Rapuano in the early hours of March 28, 2015 by \nhaving  vaginal  intercourse  and  other  sexual  contact  with  her  when  he  knew  she  was  too \nincapacitated to consent.  \n  In the morning, Kelley told Ms. Rapuano that they had “had sex” two times, and \nthat Ms. Rapuano had “freaked out” at some point during the sexual interaction.  \n  Ms. Rapuano has no memory of engaging in sexual intercourse, nor does she recall \nleaving the bar or how they returned to the hotel. Based on her physical state the following day, \nshe has wondered whether Kelley drugged her.  \n  For his part, Kelley acknowledged on different occasions that he was well aware of \nMs. Rapuano’s level of intoxication and knew that she had no recollection of that night. \n  After sexually assaulting Ms. Rapuano in March 2015, Kelley began to pursue an \ninappropriate sexual relationship with her, using his position of power to exert control over her \n18 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 19 of 72\npersonal and professional life and threatening retribution when she rejected or did not sufficiently \nrespond to his advances. \n  On numerous occasions, Kelley summoned Ms. Rapuano to his office under the \nguise of academic advising and then aggressively initiated sexual activity with her. \n  Between March 2015 and July 2017, Kelley regularly sent Ms. Rapuano sexually \ngraphic text messages. For example, Kelley sent her photographs of penises—including his own—\nand asked Ms. Rapuano to “compare them.” Kelley also sent Ms. Rapuano pictures of sex toys, \nasked her what she was wearing, demanded that she send him sexually graphic photographs of \nherself, and urged her to talk about his sexual fantasies. \n  During the 2015-2016 school year, Ms. Rapuano expressed her discomfort with \nKelley’s sexual advances and attempted to reestablish a professional working relationship with \nhim. Kelley ignored each such attempt and continued to pressure her into sexual contact. \n  For example, Ms. Rapuano attempted to end their sexual relationship after learning \nthat Heatherton had heard “rumors” that Ms. Rapuano and Kelley were sexually involved. In \nresponse, Kelley told Ms. Rapuano he was “going to keep putting [his] tongue in [her] whenever \n[he] want[s].”  \n  Ms. Rapuano observed a direct correlation between Kelley’s willingness to support \nher as his graduate student and the degree to which she complied with his sexual demands. She \npointed this out to Kelley on numerous occasions, telling him that he was crippling her academic \nadvancement by pursuing a sexual relationship with her and was not providing her with the \nacademic support she needed as his graduate student. Kelley reacted to each such attempt with \nanger and hostility, cementing Ms. Rapuano’s fears of retaliation. \n19 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 20 of 72\n  When Ms. Rapuano rejected Kelley’s sexual advances or was not sufficiently \nresponsive to his lewd and suggestive text messages, he would deprive her of academic guidance \nand refuse to schedule meetings to discuss her research. \n  In November 2015, Kelley attempted to undermine Ms. Rapuano’s academic career \nby offering a data set she had been working on to other members of the lab.  \n  To escape Kelley’s harassment—at least for a short time—Ms. Rapuano applied to \nand was ultimately awarded a prestigious fellowship that allowed her to work abroad for part of \nthe 2016-2017 academic year beginning in July 2016. \n  When Kelley learned of Ms. Rapuano’s fellowship, his retaliation and attempts to \nsabotage her career escalated as punishment for her decision to leave Dartmouth. \n  In April 2016, a paper Ms. Rapuano co-authored with the professor with whom she \nwould be working with abroad was published in a well-respected journal. Rather than commending \nthe accomplishment, Kelley reacted violently, berating Ms. Rapuano for failing to inform him she \nwas working on a paper with a different professor and accusing her of acting “unprofessionally.”  \nKelley then threatened not to sign her annual progress report for her graduate fellowship. \n  On May 2, 2016, Ms. Rapuano objected to Kelley’s reaction, which she interpreted \nas stemming from feelings of jealousy and possessiveness. Ms. Rapuano told Kelley “allowing \nprofession[al] and personal lines to blur together” was negatively impacting her career, writing:  \n“I feel that you have been incredibly disrespectful and abrasive these past few days \nand  as  much  as  I  try  to  distance  myself  from  that,  and  re-establish \nprofessionalism, you seem to push back even harder in unprofessional ways. As \nmy advisor, I hope you can understand how toxic that hostile environment can \nbe and how unproductive it is for getting work done . . . I cannot handle the amount \nof emotional manipulation that you’ve incited, and would feel forced to seek out \npossible solutions elsewhere if this continues to be a problem.” \n20 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 21 of 72\n  In the months before Ms. Rapuano’s departure, Kelley became increasingly hostile \ntowards her. He texted Ms. Rapuano almost daily with unfounded criticisms and placed pressures \non her that were obviously motivated by his personal feelings. \n  On different occasions, Kelley told Ms. Rapuano that he was “letting her go” but \nhe was “not happy” about it. \n  Prior to her departure, Ms. Rapuano proposed a collaboration on a project with \nKelley and a post-doctoral fellow working in Heatherton and Kelley’s joint lab. Kelley initially \nagreed to and supported the collaboration. However, when Ms. Rapuano attempted to execute the \ncollaboration in July 2016, Kelley flatly refused and told Ms. Rapuano: “I will not be working \nwith you on this project or any other project going forward.”   \n  Kelley then demanded that Ms. Rapuano destroy the data she had brought abroad \nwith her to work on during her fellowship. \n  In July 2016, Kelley explicitly asked Ms. Rapuano if she was interested in a sexual \nrelationship with him. She answered that she was not. Nonetheless, on July 21, 2016, Kelley \nconfirmed that he was unwilling to separate his personal feelings for her from his professional \nobligations as her advisor. In an email to Ms. Rapuano, Kelley wrote:  \n“Professionally. I’m sad. And jealous. Maybe because of how I feel personally. \nProbably so. . . . I feel like I’m #1 personally, but #10 professionally, somewhere \nbehind other European names I can’t pronounce that have amazing tools my lab \nshould use. I need to feel #1 professionally to be a good advisor. . . . I need to be \nfirst in your eyes as an academic so that I can feel comfortable about sharing you \n. . .  Maybe that’s not a fair ask, but I need it. . . . I don’t know how to separate the \npersonal from the professional. I don’t know that it makes sense to do so.” \n \n  In response, Ms. Rapuano told Kelley that she was “terrified” that her academic \nsuccess had become contingent on personal relations with him.  \n21 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 22 of 72\n  Kelley’s inappropriate and retaliatory behavior grew so extreme that Ms. Rapuano \ncontacted Heatherton to voice her concerns. Ms. Rapuano told Heatherton that Kelley’s behavior \nhad put her in “a very difficult situation” that left her feeling “stuck,” and she feared Kelley would \nrefuse to allow her back into the lab upon completion of her fellowship.  \n  Heatherton later told Ms. Rapuano that he spoke with Kelley and acknowledged the \nobvious tension in the lab. Upon information and belief, Heatherton failed to take meaningful steps \nto remedy Kelley’s behavior, despite expressly acknowledging that a problem existed. \n  In August 2016, Ms. Rapuano briefly returned to the United States for a conference. \nWhile at Dartmouth, she encountered Kelley and his girlfriend at a departmental barbecue. Ms. \nRapuano tried to keep her distance and avoided interacting with him. This visibly enraged Kelley. \n  Kelley abruptly cancelled several professional advisor meetings he had scheduled \nwith Ms. Rapuano in retaliation for her failure to personally engage with him at the barbecue. \n  Kelley also sent Ms. Rapuano several threatening and offensive emails that he \ncharacterized as “professional advice.” His “professional advice” included verbally berating Ms. \nRapuano for not engaging with him at the barbeque and accusing her of being “unprofessional,” \n“childish,” and “playing dumb.” When Ms. Rapuano attempted to speak with Kelley about his \noutburst, he refused to meet with her. \n  After this encounter, Ms. Rapuano again attempted to establish a professional \nrelationship with Kelley and highlight his inappropriate behavior, writing to him: \n“The very fact that you are upset about a personal interaction is by definition \nunprofessional. The fact that you are willing to sacrifice professional meetings \nbecause of your personal feelings is unprofessional. The fact that I am terrified of \nyou right now and do not know how to interact with you in front of people, let alone \nyour girlfriend and daughter, is unprofessional.” \n \n22 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 23 of 72\n  Later that day, Ms. Rapuano met with Kelley and implored him to separate his \npersonal feelings from the professional aspects of their relationship. Kelley refused to engage in a \nconversation on this topic or respond to Ms. Rapuano’s concerns in any meaningful way. \n  In January 2017, Ms. Rapuano returned to Dartmouth and began to more forcefully \nreject Kelley’s advances and express her discomfort with his conduct. \n  During her first meeting with Kelley, Ms. Rapuano was driven to tears by his \ndemanding, cold, and angry demeanor. When Kelley observed Ms. Rapuano crying, he told her \nthat she “just had to be nice to him.” Ms. Rapuano interpreted his statement as indicating that her \nprofessional success was once again contingent on her willingness to fulfill Kelley’s sexual \ndemands. \n  On January 13, 2017, Ms. Rapuano contacted Provost Dever to report that she was \nexperiencing sexual harassment at Dartmouth and had realized this was a pervasive issue. Upon \ninformation and belief, Provost Dever failed to launch any investigation of her own and took no \nsteps to protect Ms. Rapuano from sexual harassment, which continued unabated. \n  Between February 2017 and March 2017, Kelley continued to send Ms. Rapuano \ndemeaning and sexually explicit text messages. On many occasions, Ms. Rapuano told Kelley to \nstop sending her sexual messages and told him that she did not feel right responding to his sexual \nquestions. But Kelley persisted. \n  When Ms. Rapuano rejected his advances, Kelley became increasingly hostile and \ndifficult to work with. He cancelled meetings and refused to review Ms. Rapuano’s work or \nprovide her with academic support. \n23 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 24 of 72\n  On one occasion, Kelley learned that the graduate students had planned a happy \nhour outing without consulting him. He accused the graduate students of being disloyal and rude \nand texted Ms. Rapuano, “fuck you all . . . It’s amazing how ignorant you can all be sometimes.” \n  In March 2017, Kelley and a group of graduate students, including Ms. Rapuano, \nattended the Social & Affective Neuroscience Society (“SANS”) Conference in Los Angeles, \nCalifornia. Kelley witnessed Ms. Rapuano speaking with her ex-boyfriend and flew into a jealous \nrage.  He  accused  Ms.  Rapuano  of  exhibiting  “complete  disrespect”  for  him  at  the  SANS \nConference and told her that he was losing interest in seeing or communicating with her. \n  Soon after, Ms. Rapuano again explicitly told Kelley that she had no interest in a \nsexual relationship with him. She further informed him that he had taken advantage of her at the \nMarch  2015  CNS  Conference  by  initiating  sexual  intercourse  with  her  when  she  was  too \nintoxicated to consent and after she had specifically told him she was not interested. She explained \nthat she felt her professional success depended on her reaction to his sexual advances, writing: “I \nfelt like if I stopped . . . the professional attention would stop. I felt like I had opened a door that \ncould not be closed[.]”   \n  In  response,  Kelley  told  Ms.  Rapuano  that  her  explanation  was  “incredibly \noffensive.” Kelley then attempted to revoke his agreement that Ms. Rapuano complete her Ph.D. \nin a sixth year at Dartmouth and attempted to coerce her into leaving early, suggesting that she \nabandon her plans and adhere to a shorter timeline so that she could get her degree as soon as \npossible and leave the school.  \n  Kelley told Ms. Rapuano that his professional advice would be to “change her \nsituation.” He made clear that his opinion was directly related to her disinterest in a sexual \nrelationship with him, writing: “You just wrote an essay about how I completely fucked you over \n24 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 25 of 72\nand you don't want to be here and do science . . . You're not getting anything done here and are \nreally bitter. Let's try to move you to a better place.” \n  Kelley continued to pressure Ms. Rapuano to leave Dartmouth and told her that he \nwould be happier when she was gone. \n  Kelley’s sexual involvement with students was well-known to administrators, \nfaculty,  and  students  at  Dartmouth,  especially  within  the  Department.  When  Ms.  Rapuano \nconfronted Kelley about these past relationships with students, he acknowledged, “I guess I have \na reputation.” \n  In late March or early April of 2017, Ms. Rapuano learned that other female \nstudents in the Department had experienced unwelcome sexual conduct from several professors. \nAfter hearing these stories—which were like her own—Ms. Rapuano realized there was a pattern \nof sexual misconduct within the Department. \n  Ms. Rapuano was one of the students who reported sexual misconduct by the three \nprofessors to Chair Bucci, Director Wheatley, and the Title IX office on April 4 and April 7, 2017.  \n  Because Dartmouth failed to act for months after that report, Ms. Rapuano was \nsubjected to continued sexual harassment as she continued to work in Kelley’s lab.  \n  Between April 2017 and July 2017, Kelley continued to send Ms. Rapuano sexually \nsuggestive text messages. When Ms. Rapuano ignored his advances, Kelley targeted her for \nridicule and criticism and became increasingly unavailable for meetings or academic-related \ndiscussions. \n  On April 26, 2017, Kelley refused to meet with Ms. Rapuano regarding her \ndissertation proposal, telling her that there was “no need” to meet because he was just going to tell \nthe Department that she “didn’t do it yet”—which would have resulted in Ms. Rapuano being \n25 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 26 of 72\nplaced on academic probation. Kelley then began to avoid Ms. Rapuano and refused to schedule \nmeetings with her. \n  After weeks of denying Ms. Rapuano academic guidance and subjecting her to \nunwarranted criticism and ridicule, Kelley contacted her on May 8, 2017, to ask that she come to \nhappy hour because he wanted to see her “smiling face.” When Ms. Rapuano refused to meet him, \nKelley returned to ignoring her academically. \n  During a retreat on June 12, 2017, Kelley refused to provide necessary feedback on \nMs. Rapuano’s academic presentation. After the retreat, however, Kelley summoned her to his \noffice. Ms. Rapuano, fearing retaliation and faced with Dartmouth’s inaction to date, reluctantly \nwent. When she arrived, Kelley initiated unwelcome sexual activity with her. \n  On May 31, 2017, Ms. Rapuano initiated plans to switch to a different professor’s \nlab. Dartmouth did not transfer her to a new lab until July 28, 2017. Prior to Ms. Rapuano’s self-\ninitiated request, Dartmouth offered her no academic accommodations and instead left her under \nthe supervision of the man who assaulted and harassed her. \n  After Ms. Rapuano reported sexual misconduct to Dartmouth in April 2017, she \nsought mental health treatment at the College’s student health clinic. When she explained that she \nwanted to discuss the trauma and emotional distress resulting from Kelley’s conduct and the Title \nIX investigation, she was turned away. Dartmouth advised her to seek mental health treatment \nelsewhere, even though Dartmouth’s health insurance would not cover these expenses. \n  Ms. Rapuano turned down multiple offers from other graduate programs to attend \nDartmouth, which she viewed as the dominant player in the social neuroscience field to which she \nhoped to contribute as a leader and scholar. Her ambitions were quickly crushed. Kelley initially \nignored her and made her feel incompetent. Only when she gave in to his pressure to join Kelley’s \n26 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 27 of 72\ndrinking club did this begin to change.  As Kelley’s personal interest in her increased, he rewarded \nher academically, causing her to doubt whether the increased opportunities were solely related to \nhis sexual interest in her. Indeed, Ms. Rapuano expressed concerns about the poster Kelley slated \nher to present at the California conference where he sexually assaulted her.   \n  As Kelley’s harassment escalated, Ms. Rapuano’s mental health deteriorated, and \nshe experienced extreme depression—requiring her to take psychotropic medication for the first \ntime in her adult life—in addition to having Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, suicidal thoughts, a \nsuicide attempt, and physical symptoms such as nausea, insomnia, weight loss, nightmares, and \nlack of focus and motivational issues. Combined, these effects have dramatically impacted Ms. \nRapuano’s life and career in nearly every way possible. \nB.  Vassiki Chauhan’s Factual Allegations \n  Ms. Chauhan is a fourth-year graduate student in the Department who worked as \nWhalen’s  teaching  assistant.  She  enrolled  in  Dartmouth’s  graduate  program  in  2015  after \ncompleting her master’s degree on a prestigious merit-based scholarship. Ms. Chauhan has a strong \nacademic and research record throughout her graduate studies, including poster presentations at \nconferences and authoring a peer reviewed paper. \n  On April 4, 2017 and April 7, 2017, several Plaintiffs and other graduate students \nreported Heatherton, Kelley, and Whalen for sexual misconduct. \n  Dartmouth took no action for months. Whalen sexually assaulted Ms. Chauhan on \nApril 24-25, 2017, weeks after the initial complaints were made. \n  On  April  24,  2017,  Whalen  pressured  Ms.  Chauhan  into  drinking  with  him, \nrepeatedly ordering and paying for her drinks. Whalen then suggested that she accompany him \nback to his home for another drink. \n27 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 28 of 72\n  When Whalen attempted to initiate sexual contact, Ms. Chauhan forcefully rejected \nhis advances and told him not to touch her. Ms. Chauhan tried to leave his house several times by \ngoing downstairs. Each time, Whalen followed her downstairs and prevented her from leaving.  \n  Whalen then forced her to engage in nonconsensual intercourse with him.  \n  When Ms. Chauhan told him to at least use protection, Whalen laughed and told \nher, “that is one thing I am not going to do.”  \n  The next day, Whalen pressured Ms. Chauhan into meeting him and asked her \nwhether she thought their encounter was consensual, demanding that she keep it private and tell \nno one. \n  Following her sexual assault, Ms. Chauhan was in physical pain. As a result, she \nvisited Dartmouth’s medical facility and sought medical attention. After examining Ms. Chauhan, \nthe medical practitioner asked if the sexual encounter had been forced. Whalen suggested that Ms. \nChauhan was merely being “paranoid” for seeking medical treatment. \n  In the weeks following the assault, Whalen continued to persistently text Ms. \nChauhan late at night to ask her to meet him at a bar, on one occasion suggesting that they should \nmeet for a drink to “celebrate” when her medical test results came back. \n  Ms. Chauhan suffered sexual harassment and a hostile environment at the hands of \nKelley and Whalen from the beginning of her time at Dartmouth. \n  Ms. Chauhan first became acquainted with Kelley when she was run over by his \ncar while she was walking on a street near campus. Kelley’s car hit her with enough force to knock \nher down and send her belongings flying across the street. Ms. Chauhan later learned that Kelley \nand his girlfriend, who was allegedly driving at the time, had been drinking earlier that day. Ms. \n28 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 29 of 72\nChauhan met Kelley for the very first time that day, when he stopped to apologize for hitting her \nwith his car. \n  A few months later, Kelley overheard Ms. Chauhan discussing potential Halloween \ncostumes and suggested that she dress as “roadkill.” He continued to call Ms. Chauhan by the \nnickname “roadkill” for the next two years. \n  Whalen initiated inappropriate sexual conversations with Ms. Chauhan, such as \ninquiring about her sexual history and the status of her relationship. \n  Ms. Chauhan was also present for multiple conversations in which Kelley openly \ndiscussed his plans to break up Ms. Rapuano and her boyfriend and advised other female graduate \nstudents to break up with their boyfriends.  \n  Kelley regularly accessed students’ cell phones without permission to send out \ninappropriate messages to others. For example, Kelley once accessed Ms. Chauhan’s Facebook \npage and changed her status to: “I am going to streak across the green on my birthday at midnight; \nbe there or be square.” This message was transmitted to Ms. Chauhan’s friends and family. Kelley \ndid this without Ms. Chauhan’s knowledge or permission. \n  Like the other Plaintiffs, Ms. Chauhan felt pressured to drink, socialize, and endure \ninappropriate behavior by the Department’s faculty members because this was the sole route to \nbuilding and maintaining necessary relationships with her faculty advisors. Ms. Chauhan observed \nthat Kelley and Whalen always seemed to be trying to get their graduate students drunk. \n  The first time Whalen witnessed Ms. Chauhan purchasing a drink at a bar, he came \nup to her and exclaimed, “I can’t believe you’re this much fun! I thought you were just a shy \nperson.” \n29 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 30 of 72\n  Ms. Chauhan contacted two Title IX Coordinators multiple times and requested to \ndeliver a victim impact statement during Whalen’s disciplinary hearing. Dartmouth scheduled \nWhalen’s hearing to take place on a day when it knew Ms. Chauhan was unavailable to attend and \nthen unilaterally terminated the process, thus depriving Ms. Chauhan of the opportunity to confront \nWhalen. \n  Ms. Chauhan attended the October 2018 meeting between Chair Bucci, Director \nWheatley, the Title IX Coordinator, and the Department’s graduate students. When Ms. Chauhan \ncriticized Chair Bucci for his statements, he responded by telling her that her anger at Dartmouth \nwas misplaced and she should, instead, be angry at the professors who hurt her. This all but \nconfirmed  Ms.  Chauhan  as  a  victim  in  front  of  the  Department’s  entire  graduate  student \npopulation. \n  Ms. Chauhan came to Dartmouth as an international student from a culture that \nvalued modesty and religion. Having studied at excellent institutions throughout the world, Ms. \nChauhan chose Dartmouth because she thought it would provide her with a solid foundation as a \nresearcher and scientist. After she was sexually assaulted on April 25, 2017, Ms. Chauhan sought \nprofessional counseling services at Dartmouth’s health center. During that session, Ms. Chauhan \ndetailed her most private thoughts and feelings about the assault. Shortly thereafter, Investigator \nDavis demanded that Ms. Chauhan provide her counseling records to her and assured her that they \nwould be treated as “confidential.” Ms. Chauhan was appalled to learn, in the Title IX report, that \nInvestigator Davis showed her private counseling records to the perpetrator and his attorneys to \nseek their “response.”  \n  Ms. Chauhan feels so betrayed by that action that she cannot trust therapists enough \nto seek the treatment she knows she needs. Combined, the assault, harassment and betrayal of her \n30 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 31 of 72\nmost private confidences have left Ms. Chauhan severely depressed, anxious and with difficulty \nfocusing  and  motivating  herself  to  complete  her  work.  Her  academic  achievements  and \nproductivity have suffered greatly due to her experiences at Dartmouth and her participation in the \nTitle IX investigation. These experiences have had lasting effects on Ms. Chauhan’s mental health \nand emotional state.  She is plagued with doubts about her future prospects in academia and has \nlost her optimism for her well-being in personal relationships. \nC.  Sasha Brietzke’s Factual Allegations \n  Ms. Brietzke is a current graduate student who began working in Kelley’s lab in \nthe fall of 2016. She is a promising researcher who has received positive evaluations from her \nadvisor and presented at professional academic conferences. \n  Heatherton sexually harassed and inappropriately touched Ms. Brietzke on two \nseparate occasions in March 2017 while attending the SANS Conference with a group of the \nDepartment’s students and professors. \n  Heatherton joined Ms. Brietzke and several other conference attendees at the Abbey \nNightclub, where he stood extremely close to Ms. Brietzke and placed his hand on her lower back \nin a way that made her uncomfortable.  \n  The  next  night,  Ms.  Brietzke  attended  a  karaoke  event  after  the  conference. \nHeatherton spotted Ms. Brietzke and continuously called for her to join him.  \n  Heatherton grabbed Ms. Brietzke and groped her buttocks. He then grabbed her \nwaist and pulled her into his lap and asked her what she was “going to be doing later that night.” \nShocked and terrified, Ms. Brietzke jumped from his lap and left the venue.  \n31 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 32 of 72\n  Kelley and Whalen  created a highly sexualized and hostile environment  that \nprevented Ms. Brietzke from availing herself of the benefits of her educational and professional \npursuits at Dartmouth. \n  Kelley,  Whalen,  and  Heatherton  all  prided  themselves  on  having  young  and \nattractive females in their labs. During a lab meeting, Heatherton announced that he found it \nsocially rewarding when women smiled at him. Kelley frequently discussed how Ms. Brietzke and \nthe other female students in his lab were “hot,” often bragging that he had “the hottest lab.”  On \none occasion, Kelley commented that his lab assistants were “hotter” than Whalen’s. \n  Ms. Brietzke felt objectified and treated as a “doll” by Kelley. Kelley often made \ninappropriate and objectifying comments about Ms. Brietzke’s physical appearance, such as \nregularly commenting on the size of her breasts, complimenting her make-up, and inquiring about \nher relationship status. Kelley also urged Ms. Brietzke to date his male friends, whom he instructed \nto flirt with Ms. Brietzke and give her hugs even after she expressed disinterest. When Ms. Brietzke \ndid not respond with enthusiasm to his comments, Kelley became inattentive towards her and her \nwork. \n  While playing a game called “Heads Up!” (a variation of Charades in which the \nplayers act out words and phrases for adult content) with Ms. Rapuano, Ms. Brietzke, and Ms. \nChauhan, Kelley referred to a push-up bra by yelling, “[Ms. Rapuano] would wear this but [Ms. \nBrietzke] wouldn’t.”  Kelley also referred to chaps by stating, “Assless! You wear these, assless \nones.” \n  Kelley also made sexual and demeaning comments about other women in Ms. \nBrietzke’s presence. For example, Kelley described another woman in the Department as “a bitch” \nand regularly told Ms. Brietzke that he found Ms. Courtney physically attractive. Ms. Brietzke was \n32 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 33 of 72\npresent for conversations in which Kelley asked Ms. Courtney about her sex life and the size of \nher partner’s penis. On one occasion, Kelley urged Ms. Brietzke to participate in an “intervention” \nhe staged to encourage another female graduate student to break up with her boyfriend. \n  Ms. Brietzke, like other women in the Department, felt that she had to drink and \nsocialize with Kelley and Whalen to receive academic attention. Indeed, Kelley once told Ms. \nBrietzke that another female graduate student was “a bitch” because she had not come drinking \nwith him that night. \n  Kelley pressured Ms. Brietzke, Ms. Rapuano, and Ms. Courtney to meet him at bars \nduring non-working hours on a moment’s notice, often texting them nonstop until they agreed to \nmeet with him socially. Whalen regularly bought Ms. Brietzke drinks at bars without asking her \nand without regard for Ms. Brietzke’s discomfort with accepting alcoholic beverages purchased \nfor her by a faculty member. He also purchased extravagant meals costing hundreds of dollars for \nMs. Brietzke and other female students. \n  On April 4, 2017, and April 7, 2017, Ms. Rapuano, Ms. Courtney, and several other \ngraduate students complained of sexual harassment, sexual assault, inappropriate conduct, and \nretaliation by Kelley, Whalen, and Heatherton to Chair Bucci, Director Wheatley, and Dartmouth’s \nTitle IX office. \n  Dartmouth took no action for months. As a result, the sexual harassment and hostile \nenvironment perpetuated by Kelley, Whalen, and Heatherton continued unabated. \n  After the April 2017 Title IX complaints, Whalen remarked that Ms. Brietzke \n“didn’t like him” and invited her to watch a movie in his home. When Ms. Brietzke declined, \nWhalen asked what he had to do to make her like him. \n33 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 34 of 72\n  Another female student involved in the Title IX reporting sought another advisor \nand did not attend a lab meeting with Kelley. When he asked where this student was, Ms. Brietzke \nfeigned ignorance and stated that she might be out of town or out of the country. Later that day, \nKelley saw Ms. Brietzke and the other female student walking in town. Kelley removed Ms. \nBrietzke from a large project she was working on and refused to attend meetings with her. In an \nemail to everyone working in his lab, Kelley wrote that the other female graduate student was \nconsidering other lab options and noted that “crafting cover-up stories to suggest that she is out of \nthe country is unnecessary … indeed … it’s kind of dumb given the size of Hanover and how often \nwe all see each other in town.”  \n  Ms. Brietzke attended the meeting between Chair Bucci, Director Wheatley, the \nTitle IX Coordinator, and all graduate students in the Department that was called days after \nDartmouth received the October 12, 2018 letter from Plaintiffs’ counsel detailing Plaintiffs’ claims \nand the basis for Dartmouth’s liability under Title IX and other statutes. After this attempt to \ndisparage the victims and discourage them from pursuing legal action, Ms. Brietzke felt as though \nshe was no longer safe nor welcome at Dartmouth.  \n  Ms.  Brietzke  came  to  Dartmouth  to  gain  experience  and  learn  new  research \nmethods in the Department, which was known for its prestigious and rigorous graduate program. \nInstead, she was discouraged from contacting professors to learn new research methods and found \nthat the Department’s professors had no interest in teaching her. The sexually hostile atmosphere \nand pressure to engage with the professors socially was apparent from Ms. Brietzke’s very first \nday in the Department, and over the course of her first year at Dartmouth, she came to feel that \nwomen in the Department, including herself, were objectified and expected to compromise \n34 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 35 of 72\nthemselves to succeed. These behaviors escalated when Heatherton sexually harassed and groped \nMs. Brietzke at a conference.  \n  Combined, the toxic sexual environment, harassment, and abuse she experienced \ntook a toll on Ms. Brietzke. Ms. Brietzke became depressed, socially withdrawn, and anxious. Ms. \nBrietzke felt unsafe working in the lab with Heatherton, whom she was forced to see on a regular \nbasis. As a result, her academic work suffered. Ms. Brietzke began to withdraw from friends and \nisolate herself. She began regularly seeing a therapist for the first time because of her experiences. \nThe harassment she experienced impacted every facet of her life—from her personal relationships \nto her academic success.   \nD.  Annemarie Brown’s Factual Allegations \n  Ms. Brown worked as a graduate student in Whalen’s lab from 2010 to 2015, and \nsuccessfully defended her Ph.D. in January 2016. She was hired by Dartmouth as an adjunct \nprofessor in September 2017. \n  During her first year working as Whalen’s graduate student, Whalen trumpeted the \nclaim that Dartmouth protects its male professors by discrediting women who dare to bring sexual \nharassment  claims  against  them.  Whalen  announced  to  his  students  that  a  woman  in  the \nDepartment had previously complained about sexual harassment and that it had “backfired,” \ncausing the complainant to “lose resources” and lose steam in her career. Whalen warned his \nfemale graduate students that the complainant “got what was coming to her, of course; you don’t \nbite the hand that feeds you.” \n  Ms. Brown observed that Whalen, Heatherton, and Kelley all rewarded young, \nattractive women who went to social gatherings and drank heavily with their advisors with \nadditional  academic  attention  and  advancement  opportunities.  This  “socializing”  was  often \n35 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 36 of 72\nprioritized over students’ academic pursuits. For example, Whalen’s students, including Ms. \nBrown, traveled to London to attend an International Society for Affective Disorders conference. \nUnbeknownst to the student participants, Whalen arranged a “drinking tour” with himself and his \nstudents that lasted the duration of the conference. Indeed, Ms. Brown and her female classmates \nvisited the conference only briefly to pick up their name tags. \n  Whalen openly rewarded graduate students who drank and socialized with him over \nthose who declined to do so. He pressured Ms. Brown and his other students to attend what he \ncalled “mandatory fun” events, such as pajama parties and “boozy lunches” in the middle of the \nworkday. When Ms. Brown refused to attend these events, Whalen called her a “goody two shoes” \nand a “7-year-old girl.” He then began ignoring Ms. Brown academically and subjecting her to \nundue criticism. \n  Whalen  and  Kelley  cultivated  a  hostile  environment  in  which  professional \nboundaries were virtually nonexistent. For example, after learning that Ms. Brown had just \ninterviewed for a position at Harvard, Whalen and Kelley pressured her to take a picture with their \narms around her and texted it to her potential Harvard supervisor with the caption “wish you were \nhere.” Days later, Harvard rejected Ms. Brown.  \n  Whalen once instructed his graduate students to design a series of experiments \nrelated to alcohol consumption. Women were required to take pregnancy tests prior to participating \nin these experiments. Whalen walked down the hall singing, “Who wants a pregnancy test!?” \n  Whalen sexually harassed and inappropriately touched Ms. Brown on numerous \noccasions throughout her tenure in his lab. \n36 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 37 of 72\n  Shortly after Ms.  Brown joined the lab, Whalen laid down on the floor and \ndemanded that she “walk on his back,” an activity he said his previous female graduate students \ndid for him “all the time.”   \n  When Ms. Brown was leaving a Super Bowl party at Whalen’s house, he squeezed \nher buttocks and winked at her while hugging her goodbye. His wife was standing right beside \nthem. \n  When Ms. Brown failed to respond to Whalen’s sexual advances, he retaliated by \nsubjecting her to unwarranted criticism and cancelling academic meetings. \n  As a result, Ms. Brown became fearful that she would be expelled from the \nprogram. She eventually voiced these concerns to Whalen. Whalen reminded her of his near total \ncontrol of her, telling her, “I’ll never let you go.” \n  Whalen then delayed Ms. Brown’s academic progress by rescheduling her first \nqualifying exam. The weekend before her exam was scheduled, Whalen organized a trip to his \nVermont property. After drinking the entire weekend, Whalen ignored Ms. Brown’s attempts to \ncontact him for the first two days of the week-long exam schedule before finally telling her that he \nneeded to delay her exam because he was recovering from the weekend. \n  Whalen also escalated his inappropriate sexual comments to Ms. Brown. For \nexample, he regularly commented on Ms. Brown’s physical appearance, telling her that she was \nan “8.5 out of 10” and warning her to “act accordingly” and “watch out” because she “should know \nshe is pretty.” At another time, Whalen, while openly staring at Ms. Brown’s chest, advised her \nthat it was important that she put a lot of sunscreen on her chest area. \n  Ms. Brown felt that her success at Dartmouth required Whalen’s “protection,” \nwhich he would only provide if she succumbed to his flirtations and sexual advances. \n37 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 38 of 72\n  While in a taxi at a professional conference, Whalen publicly shouted to Ms. Brown \nthat she should “just screw” the lab mate he assumed she had feelings for. Whalen made this \ncomment in the presence of many of Ms. Brown’s fellow graduate students as well as professional \ncolleagues in the same academic field with the potential to help Ms. Brown secure future \nemployment. \n  Another time, Whalen instructed Ms. Brown to retrieve something from his desk in \nthe lab on Dartmouth premises in a drawer he knew contained Playboy magazines.  \n  Ms. Brown was also present for several instances in which Whalen behaved in a \nsexually suggestive and inappropriate manner toward other women. For example, while at a lunch, \nWhalen remarked that he could see a waitress’s panty lines and told Ms. Brown that it was “never \ngood to see panty lines.” Whalen also regularly gave Ms. Brown and other female graduate \nstudents “bear hugs” while inebriated. \n  Kelley contributed to this hostile environment by spreading false rumors that Ms. \nBrown and Whalen were in a sexual relationship. \n  While with Ms. Brown and other female graduate students, Kelley frequently \ndiscussed the “Papi scale,” rating women according to whether he would want to “bang” them. \n  Whalen then rescheduled Ms. Brown’s second qualifying exam for nearly a full \nyear. This extreme delay forced Ms. Brown to go on academic probation, which Whalen told her \nwas a “character building exercise.” When Ms. Brown was finally scheduled to take this exam \nnearly a year later, Whalen again rescheduled it, further delaying her academic progress. \n  Ms. Brown immediately contacted now-Chair David Bucci to request a secondary \nadvisor after learning her qualifying exam had been further rescheduled. Chair Bucci told Ms. \nBrown that a secondary advisor was not an option. Even though Ms. Brown explicitly asked Bucci \n38 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 39 of 72\nto keep her request confidential and refrain from telling Whalen, Bucci informed Whalen that Ms. \nBrown had requested a secondary advisor.  \n  Thereafter, Whalen retaliated against Ms. Brown for rejecting his sexual advances \nand seeking a secondary advisor. He promptly removed Ms. Brown from Dartmouth’s centralized \nfunding and placed her on his individual grant, which allowed him to exercise complete control \nover her work. Over time, Whalen increasingly denied Ms. Brown access to resources vital to her \nwork and academic success at Dartmouth. During this time, Whalen also abruptly cancelled \nmeetings with Ms. Brown. After one such cancelled meeting, Whalen told her, “I’m sorry, but I \nhad to get laid. You understand, don’t you?” Finally, Whalen then rescheduled Ms. Brown’s \ndissertation defense on two separate occasions, delaying her academic progress by months more. \n  Ms. Brown was hired as an adjunct professor in September 2017. When she was \nhired, Bucci told her that Dartmouth would continue to employ her as an adjunct if everything \nwent well. \n  In approximately October 2017, Ms. Brown contacted the Title IX investigator to \nprovide information regarding Whalen’s sexual misconduct against her and other students. \n  In April 2018, Dartmouth released the teaching schedule for the following year. \nDespite receiving outstanding student evaluations, Ms. Brown was scheduled to teach no courses. \nOn April 9, 2018, Ms. Brown contacted Chair Bucci and requested a meeting to discuss her \nteaching schedule for the following semester. Chair Bucci told Ms. Brown that he had nothing to \nsay and refused to meet with her, claiming that they could not discuss her employment until the \ninvestigation had concluded.  \n  Chair Bucci did, however, give teaching assignments to a male adjunct with similar \ncredentials to Ms. Brown’s. Both Ms. Brown and this individual were graduate students working \n39 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 40 of 72\nin the Department and were subsequently hired as adjunct professors during approximately the \nsame period. The only difference between Ms. Brown and the male teacher, aside from gender, is \nthat the male did not participate in the Title IX investigation. \n  Dartmouth also denied Ms. Brown access to free counseling resources provided to \nher as an employee benefit. In December 2017, Ms. Brown contacted Dartmouth’s employee \nassistance program and scheduled an introductory session (during which she was to provide an \noverview of the issues she wished to discuss) and a follow-up appointment for the following week. \nDuring Ms. Brown’s introductory session, she explained that she wanted to discuss the Title IX \ninvestigation and its impact on her. The Dartmouth counselor cancelled Ms. Brown’s follow-up \nappointment just days in advance and did not respond to Ms. Brown’s efforts to reschedule. \n  When Ms. Brown received a copy of the final investigative report from Dartmouth, \nshe was shocked to learn, for the very first time, that she was listed as a “Reporting Party” to the \ncomplaint against Whalen. Neither Dartmouth nor Investigator Davis asked Ms. Brown for \npermission to list her as a Reporting Party or informed her that they intended to do so.  Ms. Brown \nwas unaware that Whalen would have the opportunity to review and dispute her specific report.  \nMs. Brown suffered from a panic attack when she unexpectedly received the report listing her as \na Reporting Party along with Whalen’s rebuttal to her story. \n  After a promising undergraduate career, Ms. Brown was pursued by prestigious \nschools such as Harvard. She ultimately chose Dartmouth because of its reputation and well-\nrespected professors in her desired field of science. Ms. Brown came to Dartmouth full of potential, \nwork ethic, and energy, but left Dartmouth demoralized with a shattered academic record and \ndiagnosed with anxiety, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and stress-induced onset of autoimmune \ndisease. Ms. Brown matriculated at Dartmouth with the expectation that her work would be \n40 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 41 of 72\nexamined and scrutinized by a team of well-known researchers whom she looked forward to \nengaging with at each step. Instead, she was thrust into an environment in which these esteemed \nresearchers were prone to flagrant sexual misconduct and cared little about her research or helping \nher improve her work. This environment quickly took its toll on Ms. Brown, who came from a \nsheltered background and was just 21 years old when she came to Dartmouth. Ms. Brown became \nand remains socially withdrawn, hopeless about her future, and severely disadvantaged in a \ncompetitive field. \nE.  Andrea Courtney’s Factual Allegations \n  Ms. Courtney enrolled at Dartmouth in 2012 and worked in Kelley’s lab as a \ndoctoral student. While at Dartmouth, Ms. Courtney won multiple awards and travel grants. She \nauthored and published numerous papers and gave poster presentations and talks at academic \nconferences.  \n  Kelley  regularly  initiated  inappropriate  and  sexual  conversations  with  Ms. \nCourtney concerning the sex lives and physical appearances of Ms. Courtney and other female \ngraduate students in the Department. \n  For example, Kelley questioned Ms. Courtney about her sex life with her partner, \nasking whether the sex “was good” and inquiring about the size of her partner’s penis. Kelley also \nopenly discussed the number of Ms. Courtney’s sexual partners and demanded to know whether \nMs. Courtney would have sex with male graduate students. When she started at Dartmouth, Kelley \ntook bets on how long Ms. Courtney’s and Ms. Rapuano’s long distance relationships with their \nboyfriends would last. \n41 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 42 of 72\n  On one occasion, Kelley demanded that Ms. Courtney refrain from talking to men \nin bars because they “didn’t know that [Ms. Courtney was] the prettiest girl in here and [they don’t] \nhave a shot.” \n  Kelley regularly discussed the physical attributes of female graduate students and \nwomen. For example, Kelley openly remarked on various female graduate students’ breast sizes \nand commented that Ms. Courtney “wouldn’t need a boob job.” Kelley noted his preference for \n“boobs that have a natural, ski jump shape.” \n  Ms. Courtney and Ms. Rapuano worked together in Kelley’s lab. Ms. Courtney \nobserved that Kelley had a manipulative and controlling relationship with Ms. Rapuano, who often \nseemed distressed and upset in the lab.  \n  Ms.  Courtney,  by  contrast,  was  utterly  neglected  academically  and  often \ncompletely ignored by Kelley in the lab. Kelley rarely expressed interest in Ms. Courtney’s work \nand often refused to answer her emails, took long periods of time to review her manuscripts, and \ndenied her academic opportunities.  \n  Whalen sexually harassed Ms. Courtney and repeatedly made unwelcome sexual \nadvances towards her. \n  Whalen once pulled Ms. Courtney away from a male lab mate, held her hand, and \nhugged her while saying, “you can’t do this to me. It makes me jealous when you touch other guys \nlike that.”   \n  On another occasion, Whalen grabbed Ms. Courtney’s face and told her, “you are \nthe prettiest girl in the room; you are the prettiest girl in any room you are in.” Another time, he \nfollowed her out of a bar, stating “in another life…” before taking her hand and walking with her \nfor a block. Whalen also told Ms. Courtney and other female graduate students that he loved them \n42 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 43 of 72\non multiple occasions. Whalen also inquired about Ms. Courtney’s relationship and asked her if \nshe was happy with her partner. \n  Ms. Courtney observed that Whalen liked to surround himself with young and \nattractive women and selected his teaching assistants based on their physical appearance. Whalen \ndirected extra attention to the female students in his lab whom he deemed the most physically \nattractive. \n  Ms. Courtney found the Department to be a toxic environment from the moment \nshe enrolled. Kelley and Whalen especially inhibited Ms. Courtney’s progress by prioritizing \ndrinking over acting as academic advisors, forcing her to dedicate most of her free time to \nsocializing with these professors to receive academic advising. \n  Kelley and Whalen regularly spoke about their alcohol-fueled exploits with other \nstudents, describing how those students got drunk, threw up, and made fools of themselves. \n  On one occasion, Ms. Courtney became extremely ill after Kelley and Whalen led \na drinking marathon that commenced at 3:00 p.m. on a week day. Whalen continuously bought \nMs. Courtney and the other graduate students pitchers of sangria, refilling Ms. Courtney’s glass \nwithout being asked. Ms. Courtney announced at one point that she needed to stop drinking. Ms. \nCourtney later learned that Whalen continued to refill her glass even after she expressed that she \nneeded to stop. Ms. Courtney was brought back to the lab and fell asleep in one of the rooms.  \n  Ms. Courtney was later told that Whalen attempted to enter the room to “take care \nof her,” but was thwarted by a male lab mate watching over her who angrily forced Whalen to \nleave. \n43 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 44 of 72\n  At a conference in San Diego, Whalen accompanied Ms. Courtney and two other \nfemale graduate students to a mall and attempted to help Ms. Courtney find a dress to wear at \ndinner, bringing various dresses to the dressing room for her to try on. \n  Whalen,  Kelley,  and  Heatherton  regularly  made  demeaning  and  sexualized \ncomments about Ms. Courtney or other women in her presence. For example, Kelley once \nremarked that all the graduate students were thin now and said that they “didn’t have anyone who \nwas fat.” After interviewing graduate students to work in the lab, Heatherton remarked that one \ninterviewee “was a jap (Jewish American Princess) and needed to eat a hamburger.” \n  Kelley repeatedly told the story of a “joke” he’d played on Whalen in the past in \nwhich Kelley told a young female student working in Whalen’s lab that Whalen had a “botched \npenis circumcision” that left him with a “halfie cap.” Kelley bragged that he told Whalen about \nthis joke immediately, remarking that it was “brilliant” because Whalen was left with the option \nof either allowing his student to believe he had a “botched” circumcision or correcting her \nhimself—which he did. \n  Kelley  also  initiated  sexualized  conversations  about  male  students  in  the \nDepartment in the presence of Ms. Courtney and other women. He publicly humiliated a religious \nmale graduate student for being a virgin and asked Ms. Courtney and other graduate students to \nbet on “how long [the male graduate student] would last” on his wedding night. Kelley also \nremarked that another male working in his lab had “a big penis.” \n  On April 4, 2017, and April 7, 2017, Ms. Courtney joined Ms. Rapuano and several \nother  graduate  students  in  complaining  of  sexual  harassment,  sexual  assault,  inappropriate \nconduct, and retaliation by Kelley, Whalen, and Heatherton to Chair Bucci, Director Wheatley, \nand Dartmouth’s Title IX office.  \n44 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 45 of 72\n  Following  these  complaints,  Dartmouth  encouraged  the  victims  to  continue \nworking with or among their harassers for several months. Dartmouth warned the victims that, if \nthey did not continue working with their harassers, there was a strong possibility that Heatherton, \nKelley, and Whalen would revoke their support and disparage the victims to the Department, \nwhich could result in the victims being placed on probation or asked to leave the program. Ms. \nCourtney thus continued to work in Kelley’s lab, forced to tolerate his abusive and manipulative \nbehavior, for nearly four months. \n  Ms. Courtney chose to attend Dartmouth with the expectation that she would be \ntrained by experts in the field to publish papers and conduct cutting-edge science using resources \npromised to graduate students. However, she soon learned that these professors prioritized a highly \nsexualized drinking culture over academic advising. Ms. Courtney was dissuaded from using the \nvery resources that brought her to Dartmouth in the first place and struggled to receive advising \nand feedback on her work. Because Heatherton, Kelley, and Whalen controlled most of Ms. \nCourtney’s resources, she felt forced to participate in their predatory “boys club” as a means to \nsucceed in the Department. The power these professors wielded over Ms. Courtney eventually \nmade her believe that her own worth as a scientist was directly dependent on their support. Faced \nwith unrelenting sexual harassment and academic neglect, Ms. Courtney’s academic advancement \nand productivity suffered greatly and limited her career prospects. She began to lose passion for \npursuing a career in the field, which she came to believe nurtured this predatory “boys club” \nculture. Because of Ms. Courtney’s experiences at Dartmouth, she began to question her religious \nfaith and developed anxiety and depression. \n \n \n \n \n45 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 46 of 72\nF.  Marissa Evans’s Factual Allegations \n  Ms. Evans was an undergraduate student at Dartmouth from 2014 until 2018.  She \nmajored in Neuroscience and worked in Kelley’s lab from Fall 2015 to Spring 2017. Ms. Evans \nbegan a post-baccalaureate premedical program at the University of Southern California in the Fall \nof 2018. \n  In the fall of 2015, when Ms. Evans was a sophomore, a male student broke into \nher dorm room and raped her.  Ms. Evans reported the assault to Dartmouth College Health Service \ncounselor Dr. Bryant Ford on November 10, 2015. When Ms. Evans relayed the assault, Dr. Ford \nreplied, “Was it a dream?” Then, at Ms. Evans’s direction, Dr. Ford reported the sexual assault to \nDartmouth’s Title IX coordinator and campus safety on her behalf on approximately November \n19, 2015. \n  Dartmouth’s response to Ms. Evans’s sexual assault report violates Title IX and \nnumerous other state and federal laws. First, Dartmouth failed to inform Ms. Evans of her right to \nobtain a no-cost Jane Doe forensic examination at the nearest qualified facility, to which law \nenforcement is legally required to transport her. Moreover, Dartmouth falsely informed Ms. Evans \nthat she would not be permitted to proceed anonymously to pursue a Title IX complaint. In \naddition, Dartmouth engaged in no investigation concerning the reported rape, refusing even to \ncheck the entry logs to see which students had entered her dorm during the relevant hours on the \nnight of her assault. Although Ms. Evans provided the approximate height, hair length and color, \nand build of the person who raped her, she is unaware of any steps that were taken to investigate \nher assault or identify the rapist. Thus, Dartmouth violated Title IX at least by: failing to prevent \nthe sexual assault; failing to have a workable process for reporting sexual assault; impeding a \ncriminal investigation by failing to take necessary steps to preserve evidence; failing to conduct \n46 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 47 of 72\nany investigation of the rape; failing to offer the victim any accommodations; and failing to take \nany measures to prevent against retaliation. \n  Kelley sexually harassed Ms. Evans throughout her tenure in his lab. From the \noutset, Kelley eschewed professional and personal boundaries. During the summer of 2015, Ms. \nEvans interviewed for a position in Kelley’s lab. Although she was just 19 years old, Kelley \ninsisted that her formal job interview take place at a bar. There, Kelley plied her with several \nglasses of wine before taking her bar-hopping and buying her whiskey, commenting several times \nthat Ms. Evans was underage and could not legally drink. \n  Kelley’s conduct escalated in the summer of 2016. For example, Kelley began \nsending Ms. Evans Snapchats of himself drinking and commented on his level of intoxication.  \nOver the 2016-2017 academic year, these messages escalated to inappropriate compliments, such \nas telling Ms. Evans that “a guy like me could never be with a girl like you” and calling her \n“beautiful” and “sexy.” In December 2016, Kelley arrived, uninvited, at one of Ms. Evans’s track \nmeets while intoxicated. \n  Ms. Evans did not submit to Kelley’s sexual advances or convey any romantic or \nsexual interest in him, often responding to his comments by saying, “no, you don’t mean that.” \nMs. Evans became anxious over Kelley’s level of interest in her and feared that rejecting him \nwould hurt her academically. Kelley warned Ms. Evans that his letter of recommendation would \nbe “crucial” for her future and once told her that, as a “favor,” he was giving her a better grade in \nhis course than she deserved. \n  Kelley repeatedly threatened to harm Ms. Evans academically after she refused to \nengage in his sexual banter. Each time, Kelley responded by telling Ms. Evans, “Someone’s honors \n47 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 48 of 72\nthesis just got harder.” Ms. Evans responded by telling Kelley not to bring her honors thesis into \nthe conversation. \n  In December 2016, Ms. Evans returned home due to a close childhood friend’s \ndeath. Kelley sought to exploit Ms. Evans’s vulnerable state—of which he was well-aware—by \ndramatically escalating his unwelcome sexual advances towards her. \n  Kelley began to send Ms. Evans sexually explicit images that were both unwelcome \nand unsolicited. These images displayed, among other things: \n•  Kelley’s fully naked body, including his erect penis; \n•  Kelley’s genitalia with sex toys, including a penis “cage” and a penis “hat”; and \n•  Kelley engaged in sexual encounters with two unidentified persons. \n \n  Kelley barraged Ms. Evans with unwelcome and offensive text messages of a \nsexual nature, including: \n•  Describing his personal use of sex toys, his past sexual encounters, and his sexual \npreferences in terms of dominant/submissive roles;  \n•  Asking Ms. Evans to describe her sexual practices and fantasies; \n•  Instructing Ms. Evans on how to perform oral sex on a woman; \n•  Seeking to assert sexual dominance by commanding Ms. Evans to masturbate \nand—likening her to a pet—calling her “good girl”; and \n•  Expressing his intention to have sexual intercourse with her when she returned to \nDartmouth in January 2017. \n \n  After receiving more than 10 explicit sexual photographs, Ms. Evans blocked \nKelley’s number so that he could not contact her. \n  Ms. Evans returned to Dartmouth in January 2017, after the holidays.  Because \nKelley had told her he intended to have sexual intercourse with her upon her return, Ms. Evans \nwas terrified that he was going to force her to have sex with him. \n48 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 49 of 72\n  As a result, Ms. Evans attempted to limit her interaction with Kelley and tried to \nwork directly with his senior graduate student, Ms. Rapuano, rather than working with Kelley \ndirectly. \n  Kelley eventually emailed Ms. Evans and demanded to know why she was not \nresponding to his text messages. Afraid to tell Kelley that she had blocked him, she instead said \nthat her phone was broken. In response, Kelley took it upon himself to make Ms. Evans an \nappointment at the Verizon store. Fearing retaliation if Kelley learned the truth, Ms. Evans went \nto the Verizon store and paid for a phone upgrade that she did not need. \n  To escape Kelley’s sexual harassment, Ms. Evans transferred to a different lab in \nthe spring of 2017. \n  After switching labs, Ms. Evans was at a local restaurant with a group of Dartmouth \nstudents when Kelley arrived to join the group. Ms. Evans switched to a different table so that she \nwould not be seated near him. Kelley continued to stare at her throughout the night and said her \nname loudly as if to draw her attention to him.  \n  Kelley’s conduct robbed Ms. Evans of her undergraduate educational experience \nand caused her to suffer severe emotional distress and disruptions to every area of her life. \n  Dartmouth  retaliated  against  Ms.  Evans  for  participating  in  the  Title  IX \ninvestigation. \n  On May 23, 2018, Ms. Evans easily passed the oral defense of her honors thesis. \nProfessors Bob Maue and Alan Green, the faculty judges, unanimously recommended that she pass \nwith honors. \n49 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 50 of 72\n  However, Professor Maue then, without explanation, refused to provide Ms. Evans \nwith his signature as required for Ms. Evans to turn in her honors thesis. Ms. Evans sent Professor \nMaue numerous emails requesting his signature.  He did not respond. \n  These circumstances delayed Ms. Evans’s submission of her honors thesis, forcing \nher to file it one day past its due date. Purportedly because of this “lateness,” Ms. Evans received \na failing grade on her thesis.  \n  Ms. Evans met with Chair Bucci, Assistant Dean of Undergraduate Students Anne \nHudak, and Professors Jeffrey Taube and Dave Kramer to explain the circumstances and request \nthat Dartmouth reverse its decision to fail her. They refused and, instead, presented Ms. Evans \nwith an untenable ultimatum: either accept an A- in an independent study without an honors thesis \nor receive her honors thesis but with a C grade for two semesters (which would drop her GPA \nbelow the threshold for medical school, the next professional step in her career). \n  Ms. Evans appealed this decision to President Hanlon. In her appeal, she voiced \nconcern about possible retaliation for her involvement in the Title IX investigation against Kelley, \nwriting: “I personally feel as though this decision is rooted in retaliation, as I am the only \nundergraduate student who was directly involved in the investigation of the three neuroscience \nprofessors this past year.” A petition was started on Ms. Evans’s behalf requesting that Dartmouth \nreverse its decision, accumulating approximately 200 signatures. \n  Still Dartmouth refused to reverse its decision. Ms. Evans was ultimately permitted \nto accept grades of B+ and A- for two semesters. \n  Ms. Evans is the only undergraduate student who participated in the Title IX \ninvestigation. She is also the only undergraduate student whose honors thesis Dartmouth failed. \n50 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 51 of 72\n  Ms. Evans was a top-ranked high school graduate when she was recruited by \nDartmouth to join its track and field team. Kelley took an immediate interest in her when she \nenrolled in several of his undergraduate courses. Ms. Evans, who was just 18 years old at the time, \nconstrued Kelley’s interest as recognition of academic potential in her, and subsequently applied \nto work in his lab with the expectation that he would assist in building her career and shaping her \nhonors thesis. Kelley’s harassment of Ms. Evans caused her to question her own intellect and \nacademic  capabilities,  doubts  which  permeated  every  aspect  of  her  academic  and  social \nrelationships. She became terrified that Kelley would force her to have sexual intercourse with him \n(after he stated his intention to do so) and was driven to severe depressive episodes and a suicide \nattempt. Ms. Evans’s experiences at Dartmouth have had a lasting effect on her professional career \nand mental health. Ms. Evans will only work in research labs run by women because of her deep \ndistrust of male employers. She was forced to withdraw from her first semester in a post-\nbaccalaureate  premedical  program  due  to  mental  health  reasons  resulting  from  her  time  at \nDartmouth. \nG.  Jane Doe’s Factual Allegations \n  Jane Doe received a master’s degree in experimental psychology and obtained a \nBachelor of Liberal Arts degree from a top college. Prior to matriculating at Dartmouth as a \ndoctoral student, she worked in a prestigious neuroimaging lab. \n  While at Dartmouth, Jane Doe received numerous external funding and conference \nawards,  co-authored  multiple  papers,  and  gave  talks  and  poster  presentations  at  academic \nconferences across the country. \n51 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 52 of 72\n  Jane Doe worked in Whalen’s lab during the 2016-2017 academic year. Whalen \nsexually harassed Jane Doe and subjected her to a hostile environment during her entire tenure in \nhis lab. \n  Jane Doe and other female graduate students in Whalen’s lab felt pressured to \nsubmit to his constant and inappropriate flirtation and dress in a manner he felt was “sexy” to get \nany of Whalen’s academic attention or support. Emblematically, Whalen once told Jane Doe that \nhe had been described as a “benevolent sexist,” which he told her he took as a compliment. \n  Whalen made numerous unwelcome sexual advances toward Jane Doe, such as \nputting his arm around Jane Doe’s waist and invading her personal space by, despite her obvious \ndiscomfort, putting his face just inches away from her face to speak to her. Additionally, Whalen \nonce observed his ex-girlfriend at a bar, sat down next to Jane Doe, and instructed her that they \nwere going to “make [his ex-girlfriend] jealous by making her think we are on a date.” \n  Whalen also made inappropriate comments about Jane Doe’s physical appearance. \nFor  example,  before  attending  a  dinner  at  an  academic  conference,  Whalen  expressed \ndisappointment in Jane Doe’s physical appearance and implied that he did not find her attractive \nin the outfit she was wearing by remarking that he had hoped she would “dress up.”  \n  While with Jane Doe and her female colleagues, Whalen and Kelley regularly rated \nthe “hotness” of female students in the Department, remarking on their physical attractiveness and \ntheir clothing choices.  \n  Within months of starting at Dartmouth, Jane Doe noticed that students were \nexpected to drink and socialize with the Department’s professors to build key relationships and \nreceive academic attention. Meetings often took place at bars and often involved heavy drinking. \n52 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 53 of 72\nOn the occasions when Jane Doe declined to attend these “meetings,” Whalen would disappear \nand ignore Jane Doe’s emails, leaving her with no advisory support. \n  Jane Doe realized that participating in this drinking culture was a prerequisite to \ngetting the advising, guidance, and academic support she needed from Whalen to complete her \nstudies at Dartmouth. \n  Whalen  prioritized  female  students  who  indulged  his  flirtations  and  sexual \nadvances and neglected those who did not. Most tellingly, Whalen lavished advising, academic \nattention and opportunities upon a female student in his lab with whom he was widely known to \nbe having a sexual relationship. By contrast, Whalen completely ignored and “froze out” Jane Doe, \nwho refused his sexual advances. \n  This  dynamic  impeded  Jane  Doe’s  academic  progress  at  Dartmouth.  While \nattempting to complete her work in the lab, Jane Doe felt pressured to leave Whalen and the \ngraduate student with whom he was having a sexual relationship alone. When they were in the lab \ntogether, Whalen often spoke only to the female graduate student with whom he was in a \nrelationship, ignoring Jane Doe.  \n  After Jane Doe participated in the Title IX process and investigation, Dartmouth \nretaliated against her by denying her reasonable accommodations, unilaterally transferring her into \na new lab that was inconsistent with her background and academic field of science, and ultimately \nexpelling her from the program after the school had set her up to fail. \n  After subjecting Jane Doe to a highly sexualized and hostile lab environment \nperpetuated by its tenured professors for years, Dartmouth forced Jane Doe to a different lab that \nwas  incompatible  with  her  background  and  field  of  science.  Dartmouth’s  actions  made  it \nimpossible for Jane Doe to realize the benefits of her education as a student at Dartmouth. \n53 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 54 of 72\n  In mid-July 2017, Jane Doe was abruptly informed that Whalen had been placed on \nadministrative leave and, effective immediately, she would be reassigned to a different professor’s \nlab that was inconsistent with her background and field of science. Dartmouth did not give Jane \nDoe the opportunity to object to her placement or seek a more suitable lab. \n  The next day, Jane Doe told Dartmouth that the new lab to which she had been \nassigned was incompatible with her academic background and interests.  \n  Immediately thereafter, Jane Doe became involved in the Title IX investigation. \n  Jane Doe continued to raise concerns with Dartmouth that her new lab was a poor \nfit.  She discussed this with the new professor to whom she was assigned, who agreed that she \nwould be better suited in a different lab.  \n  Thereafter, Jane Doe met with a different professor whose lab was more aligned \nwith her background and field of science. This professor offered to take Jane Doe into his lab, \npromising to communicate his offer to Dartmouth and advocate for the transfer during the annual \nfaculty meeting. With this professor’s support, Jane Doe initiated plans to transfer into his lab. \n  Director Wheatley and Chair Bucci initially seemed agreeable, but ultimately \nrefused to let Jane Doe switch labs.  \n  In June 2018, Dartmouth expelled Jane Doe from the program, without notice or a \nprobationary period. \n  Within 48 hours, Jane Doe met with both Chair Bucci and Director Wheatley \nseparately to discuss her expulsion.  \n  Chair Bucci advised Jane Doe not to appeal her evaluations, warning her that “this \nis a small field and you don’t want bad blood.” In this same meeting, Jane Doe told Chair Bucci \nthat the culture and harassment perpetuated by the Department’s professors and the poor fit with \n54 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 55 of 72\nthe lab she had been assigned had left her without a safe scientific home to complete her work. \nChair Bucci trivialized Jane Doe’s experiences of harassment and displacement by comparing \nthem with a time when he was inundated with administrative work, stating “I had a hellish year, \ntoo, but was able to do my work.”  \n  Director Wheatley claimed that she “had no  choice” but  to  expel  Jane Doe. \nReferencing an upcoming required presentation, Director Wheatley demanded to know: “What \nwould you even present on if you were to stay?” This presentation was not scheduled to take place \nfor nearly one year, and Jane Doe already had projects underway that she intended to present. \nNonetheless, Dartmouth stood by its decision to expel her. \n  Jane Doe chose to attend Dartmouth specifically to work with Whalen, whose \nresearch she had followed for many years. She came to Dartmouth with the expectation that \nWhalen, whose work heavily informed her interests and goals, would provide her with  the \nbackground and knowledge necessary to launch a career in the field of social neuroscience.  \nInstead,  Jane Doe found herself in  a place in  which a highly sexualized environment  was \nnormalized and women, including herself, were systematically gaslighted. The pressure to drink \nand stay out late to receive mentorship served as a devastating trigger to Jane Doe, who had \npreviously suffered from depression and had experienced trauma earlier in her life. Because of her \nexperiences at Dartmouth, she lost her motivation, excitement, and passion for her work and \nbecame extremely withdrawn, cutting off communication with her family and closest friends. \nV.  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n  Plaintiffs and Class Representatives re-allege and incorporate by reference each and \nevery allegation in the Complaint as though fully set forth herein. \n55 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 56 of 72\n  Plaintiffs and Class Representatives sue on behalf of themselves individually and \non behalf of three classes of similarly-situated individuals pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure 23(b)(2) and (b)(3). \n  Dartmouth tolerates and cultivates a gender discriminatory and sexually hostile \nenvironment for female students in the Department. Dartmouth has failed to respond adequately \nor appropriately to evidence and complaints of gender discrimination, sexual harassment, and \nhostile environment in the Department. The College has failed to create adequate procedures to \nensure its employees comply with anti-discrimination laws and has failed to adequately discipline \nits employees when they violate anti-discrimination laws. Dartmouth knew or should have known \nthat, because of its actions and inactions, female students have been subjected to a sexually hostile \nenvironment that has been sufficiently severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive to interfere \nwith their educational opportunities, undermining and detracting from their school experience. \nDartmouth’s  policies,  practices,  and  procedures  for  investigating  and  responding  to  student \ncomplaints of gender discrimination, sexual harassment and hostile environment have an ongoing \ndisparate impact on female students.  \nA.  Rule 23 Class Definition \n  Plaintiffs and Class Representatives seek to bring this action under Rule 23 on \nbehalf  of  every  current  and  former  female  graduate  and  undergraduate  student  who  has \nmatriculated or will matriculate at Dartmouth in the Department of Psychological and Brain \nSciences between March 31, 2015 and the date of judgment. \n  Plaintiffs reserve the right to modify this Class definition and Class period.  \n \n \n \n \n56 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 57 of 72\nB.  Efficiency of Class Prosecution of Class Claims \n  Certification of the proposed class is the most efficient and economical means of \nresolving the questions of law and fact that are common to the claims of the Plaintiffs and the \nClass. \n  Plaintiffs’ individual claims, as Class Representatives, require resolution of the \ncommon  questions  concerning  whether  Dartmouth  has  subjected  its  female  students  in  the \nDepartment to a sexually hostile environment that is sufficiently severe, pervasive, and objectively \noffensive to interfere with their educational opportunities, undermining and detracting from their \nschool experience. The Class Representatives seek remedies to eliminate the adverse effects of \nsuch discrimination in their own lives and working conditions, and the working conditions of the \nclass members, and to prevent Dartmouth’s continued gender discrimination. \n  The Class Representatives have standing to seek such relief because of the adverse \neffect that such discrimination has had on them individually and on female students in the \nDepartment generally. Dartmouth caused Plaintiffs’ injuries through its discriminatory practices, \npolicies, and procedures and failure to remedy or correct such discrimination. These injuries are \nredressable through systemic relief, such as equitable and injunctive relief and other remedies \nsought in this action. Plaintiffs have a personal interest in the policies, practices, and procedures \nimplemented at Dartmouth. \n  To obtain relief for themselves and the class members, the Class Representatives \nwill first establish the existence of systemic gender discrimination and hostile work environment \nas the premise for the relief they seek. Without class certification, the same evidence and issues \nwould be subject to re-litigation in a multitude of individual lawsuits with an attendant risk of \ninconsistent adjudications and conflicting obligations.  \n57 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 58 of 72\n  Certification of the proposed class is the most reasonable and efficient means of \npresenting  the  evidence  and  arguments  necessary  to  resolve  such  questions  for  the  Class \nRepresentatives and the class members. \nC.  Numerosity and Impracticability of Joinder  \n  The Class that the Class Representatives seek to represent is too numerous to make \njoinder practicable.  \n  Upon information and belief, the proposed class consists of more than 40 current \nand former female students during the liability period. The exact size of the Class and the identities \nof the individual members are ascertainable through records maintained by Dartmouth. \nD.  Common Questions of Law and Fact \n  Prosecuting  Class  Representatives’  claims  will  require  the  adjudication  of \nnumerous questions of law and fact common to their claims and those of the Class they seek to \nrepresent.  \n  Common questions of law and fact predominate, and include, but are not limited \nto, the following: (i) whether Dartmouth has engaged in unlawful, systemic sex discrimination and \nfacilitated a hostile educational environment that violates Title IX; (ii) whether Dartmouth has \nviolated the Title IX and other legal rights of its female students by failing to adequately prevent, \ninvestigate,  or  respond  with  appropriate  corrective  action  to  evidence  and  complaints  of \ndiscrimination in the educational environment; (iii) whether Dartmouth is liable for continuing \nsystemic violations of Title IX; (iv) whether the harassment permitted and facilitated by Dartmouth \ninterfered with the work or educational opportunities normally available to students; (v) whether \nan  “appropriate  person”  had  knowledge  of  the  sexual  harassment  and  hostile  environment, \nincluding such knowledge of facts that would reasonably indicate substantial risk to any female \n58 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 59 of 72\nstudents,  and  failed  to  adequately  respond;  (vi)  whether  Dartmouth  acted  with  deliberate \nindifferent to the notice of harassment; (vii) whether Dartmouth owed Plaintiffs and the proposed \nclass members a fiduciary duty; (viii) whether Dartmouth breached its fiduciary duty by tolerating, \ncondoning, ratifying, and/or engaging in the hostile environment, sexual harassment, gender \ndiscrimination, and/or retaliation, and failing to take remedial action; (ix) whether Dartmouth \nknew or should have known that its breach of fiduciary duty resulted in the sexual harassment and \nhostile environment to which Plaintiffs and members of the proposed class were subjected.  \nE.  Typicality of Claims and Relief Sought \n  Each Class Representative is a member of the Class she seeks to represent. The \nClass  Representatives’  claims  are  typical  of  the  claims  of  the  proposed  class.  The  Class \nRepresentatives possess and assert each of the claims they assert on behalf of the proposed class. \nThey pursue the same factual and legal theories and seek similar relief.  \n  Like members of the proposed class, the Class Representatives are current and \nformer  female  graduate  or  undergraduate  students  who  matriculated  in  the  Department  at \nDartmouth during the liability period. \n  The acts and omissions to which Defendants subjected the Class Representatives \nand the Class applied universally within the Class and were not unique to any Class Representative \nor Class Member.   \n  Dartmouth has failed to respond adequately or appropriately to evidence and \ncomplaints of sexual harassment and hostile environment in the Department. Dartmouth has failed \nto create adequate procedures to ensure its employees comply with anti-discrimination laws and \nhas failed to adequately discipline its employees when they violate anti-discrimination laws. The \nClass Representatives and proposed class members have been affected in the same or similar ways \n59 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 60 of 72\nby Dartmouth’s failure to implement adequate procedures to detect, monitor, and correct this \npattern and practice of discrimination and sexually hostile environment. \n  The relief necessary to remedy the claims of the Class Representatives is the same \nas that necessary to remedy the claims of the proposed class members. The Class Representatives \nseek the following relief for their individual claims and on behalf of the members of the proposed \nclass: (i) a declaratory judgment that Dartmouth’s policies, practices and/or procedures challenged \nherein are illegal and in violation of the rights of Class Representatives and class members under, \ninter alia, Title IX and the applicable New Hampshire state laws; (ii) a permanent injunction \nagainst  Dartmouth  and  its  partners,  officers,  owners,  agents,  successors,  employees  and/or \nrepresentatives, and any and all persons acting in concert with them, from engaging in any further \nunlawful practices, policies, customs, and usages as set forth herein; (iii) an Order requiring \nDefendants  to  initiate  and  implement  programs  and  policies  that  (a)  remedy  the  gender \ndiscrimination, sexual harassment, and hostile environment at Dartmouth; (b) ensure prompt \nremedial action regarding all claims of gender discrimination, sexual harassment and hostile \nenvironment;  and  (c)  eliminate  the  continuing  effects  of  the  discriminatory  and  retaliatory \npractices described herein; (iv) an award of damages to Plaintiffs and the Class under Title IX of \nthe Education Amendments of 1972 and common law, including compensatory damages and \nenhanced compensatory damages and/or punitive damages to deter Dartmouth from engaging in \nsimilar discriminatory practices in the future; and (v) an award of litigation costs and expenses, \nincluding reasonable attorneys’ fees. \nF.  Adequacy of Representation \n  The Class Representatives are adequate representatives of the proposed class. \n60 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 61 of 72\n  The Class Representatives’ interests are coextensive with those of the members of \nthe proposed class that they seek to represent in this case. The Class Representatives seek to \nremedy Dartmouth’s hostile environment so female students will not suffer differential treatment, \ndepriving them of educational opportunities and resources. \n  The Class Representatives are willing and able to represent the proposed class fairly \nand vigorously as they pursue their similar individual claims in this action. \n  The  Class  Representatives  have  retained  counsel  sufficiently  qualified, \nexperienced, and able to conduct this litigation and to meet the time and fiscal demands required \nto litigate a class action of this size and complexity. The combined interests, experience, and \nresources of the Class Representatives and their counsel to litigate competently the individual and \nclass claims at issue in this case clearly satisfy the adequacy of representation requirement of Rule \n23(a)(4). \nG.  Requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) \n  Dartmouth has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the Class \nRepresentatives  and  the  proposed  class  by  facilitating  a  hostile  environment  and  failing  to \nadequately prevent, investigate, or respond with appropriate corrective action to evidence and \ncomplaints  of  hostile  environment,  sexual  harassment,  and  retaliation  by  faculty  and \nadministrators. Dartmouth’s systemic discrimination and refusals to act on nondiscriminatory \ngrounds justify the requested injunctive and declaratory relief for the Class as a whole. \n  Injunctive, declaratory, and affirmative relief are a predominant form of relief \nsought in this case. Entitlement to declaratory, injunctive, and affirmative relief flows directly and \nautomatically from proof of the College’s systemic sex discrimination. In turn, entitlement to \ndeclaratory, injunctive, and affirmative relief forms the factual and legal predicate for recovery by \n61 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 62 of 72\nthe  Class  Representatives  and  class  members  of  monetary  and  non-monetary  remedies  for \nindividual losses caused by the systemic discrimination, as well as their recovery of compensatory \nand punitive damages. \nH.  Requirements of Rule 23(b)(3) \n  The  common  issues  of  fact  and  law  affecting  the  claims  of  the  Class \nRepresentatives and proposed class members—including, but not limited to, the common issues \nidentified above—predominate over any issues affecting only individual claims. The common \nissues include whether Dartmouth has engaged in sex discrimination against female students by \nfacilitating a hostile environment and failing to appropriately handle evidence and complaints of \nharassment. \n  A  class  action  is  superior  to  other  available  means  for  fairly  and  efficiently \nadjudicating the claims of the Class Representatives and members of the proposed class. The cost \nof  proving  Dartmouth’s  hostile  academic  environment  for  female  students  also  makes  it \nimpracticable for the Class Representatives and class members to pursue their claims individually. \n  The hostile academic environment at Dartmouth makes the Class Representatives \nand  class  members  eligible  for  monetary  remedies  for  losses  caused  by  this  systemic \ndiscrimination, including back pay, front pay, compensatory damages, and other relief. \n  Additionally,  or  in  the  alternative,  the  Court  may  grant  “partial”  or  “issue” \ncertification  under  Rule  23(c)(4).  Resolution  of  common  questions  of  fact  and  law  would \nmaterially advance the litigation for all class members.  \nVI.  COUNTS \nCOUNT ONE \n \nVIOLATION OF TITLE IX OF THE EDUCATION AMENDMENTS OF 1972,  \nAS AMENDED — \n62 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 63 of 72\nSEXUAL HARASSMENT – HOSTILE EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT \n(On Behalf of All Plaintiffs, Class Representatives and Class Members) \n \n  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation in each \nand every aforementioned paragraph as if fully set forth herein. \n  This Count is brought on behalf of the Plaintiffs and Class Representatives and all \nmembers of the proposed class. \n  Upon information and belief, at all times relevant to this action, Dartmouth has \nreceived, and continues to receive, federal financial assistance. \n  Dartmouth has subjected Plaintiffs, Class Representatives and the members of the \nproposed class to a sexually hostile educational environment in violation of Title IX.  \n  Dartmouth  has  discriminated  against  Plaintiffs,  Class  Representatives  and  all \nmembers of the proposed class by subjecting them to a sexually hostile environment that was \nsufficiently severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive to interfere with the Plaintiffs’ and the \nproposed class members’ educational opportunities, undermining and detracting from their school \nexperience. Because of Dartmouth’s failure to implement adequate procedures to detect, monitor, \nand correct this discrimination and hostile environment, Dartmouth has denied Plaintiffs and \nmembers of the proposed class their personal right to work and learn in an environment free of \nsexual harassment. \n  Dartmouth  was  on  actual  notice  of  the  sexual  harassment  committed  by  the \nDepartment’s professors and the hostile academic environment that the Plaintiffs and  class \nmembers endured at Dartmouth during the relevant timeframe. Dartmouth has demonstrated \ndeliberate indifference by tolerating, condoning, ratifying, and/or engaging in the hostile work and \neducational environment and failing to take remedial action.  \n63 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 64 of 72\n  Because  of  Dartmouth’s  unlawful  conduct,  Plaintiffs  and  the  proposed  class \nmembers have suffered and will continue to suffer harm, including but not limited to loss of future \neducational  and  employment  opportunities,  humiliation,  embarrassment,  reputational  harm, \nemotional and physical distress, mental anguish, and other economic damages and non-economic \ndamages. \n  By reason of the continuous nature of Dartmouth’s unlawful conduct, Plaintiffs and \nthe proposed class members are entitled to the application of the continuing violation doctrine to \nthe unlawful acts alleged herein.  \n  Plaintiffs and the proposed class members are entitled to all legal and equitable \nremedies available for violations of Title IX, including compensatory damages, injunctive relief, \nattorneys’ fees and costs, and other appropriate relief. \nCOUNT TWO \n \nVIOLATION OF TITLE IX OF THE EDUCATION AMENDMENTS OF 1972, AS \nAMENDED — \nGENDER DISCRIMINATION IN TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF EDUCATION U.S.C. \n§ 1681 et seq. \n(On Behalf of Plaintiffs, Class Representatives and Class Members) \n  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation in each \nand every aforementioned paragraph as if fully set forth herein. \n  This Count is brought on behalf of the Plaintiffs and Class Representatives and all \nmembers of the proposed class. \n  Upon information and belief, at all times relevant to this action, Dartmouth has \nreceived, and continues to receive, federal financial assistance. \n  Dartmouth  has  discriminated  against  Plaintiffs,  Class  Representatives  and  all \nmembers of the proposed class by subjecting them to different treatment on the basis of their \n64 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 65 of 72\ngender. Plaintiffs and members of the proposed class were treated differently and less favorably \nthan similar-situated male students. Dartmouth subjected Plaintiffs and members of the proposed \nclass to disparate terms and conditions of education in violation of Title IX. \n  Dartmouth’s differential treatment of Plaintiffs and members of the proposed class \nis a direct and proximate result of gender discrimination.  \n  Dartmouth  has  failed  to  prevent,  respond  to,  adequately  investigate,  and/or \nappropriately resolve instances of gender discrimination. \n  Dartmouth had actual notice of this discrimination and failed to adequately respond, \nboth before and after the discrimination against Plaintiffs and members of the proposed class \noccurred, amounting to deliberate indifference. \n  Because of the continuous nature of Dartmouth’s unlawful conduct, Plaintiffs and \nmembers of the proposed class have suffered and will continue to suffer harm, including but not \nlimited to loss of future educational and employment opportunities, humiliation, embarrassment, \nreputational harm, emotional and physical distress, mental anguish, and other economic damages \nand non-economic damages. \n  Because of the continuous nature of Dartmouth’s unlawful conduct, Plaintiffs and \nmembers of the proposed class are entitled to the application of the continuing violation doctrine \nto the unlawful acts alleged herein.  \n  Plaintiffs and the proposed class are entitled to all legal and equitable remedies \navailable for violations of Title IX, including compensatory damages, attorneys’ fees and costs, \nand other appropriate relief. \nCOUNT THREE \n \nBREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY UNDER NEW HAMPSHIRE LAW \n(On Behalf of All Plaintiffs, Class Representatives and Class Members) \n65 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 66 of 72\n  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation in each \nand every aforementioned paragraph as if fully set forth herein. \n  This Count is brought on behalf of the Plaintiffs and Class Representatives and all \nmembers of the proposed class. \n  Plaintiffs, Class Representative and the proposed class members  are  or were \nenrolled at Dartmouth as undergraduate and/or graduate students in the Department during the \nliability period. \n  Dartmouth,  a  New  Hampshire  post-secondary  educational  institution,  has  a \nfiduciary relationship with the Plaintiffs and the members of the proposed class. Plaintiffs and the \nproposed class were or are dependent on Dartmouth for their education, and Dartmouth owed them \na duty to act in good faith and with due regard for their interests. Dartmouth thus owed Plaintiffs \nand the proposed class a fiduciary duty to create an environment in which they could pursue their \neducation free from sexual harassment by faculty members. \n  Dartmouth breached the fiduciary duty it owed to Plaintiffs, Class Representatives \nand  the  proposed  class  by  tolerating,  condoning,  ratifying,  and/or  engaging  in  the  hostile \nenvironment, sexual harassment, gender discrimination, and/or retaliation, and failing to take \nremedial action. Dartmouth failed to adopt and enforce practices and grievance procedures to \neffectively respond to faculty misconduct that would minimize the danger Plaintiffs and the \nproposed class would be exposed to sexual harassment by faculty members. Dartmouth failed to \nact in good faith and with due regard for the interests of Plaintiffs and members of the proposed \nclass, who entrusted Dartmouth with their confidence.  \n  Dartmouth  knew  or  should  have  known  that  it  fostered  a  hostile  academic \nenvironment  that enabled Heatherton,  Kelley, and Whalen to sexually harass  Plaintiffs and \n66 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 67 of 72\nmembers of the proposed class. Dartmouth knew that Heatherton, Kelley, and Whalen had a \npropensity for sexually harassing female students. \n  The faculty and members of administration responsible for the sexual harassment \nand  hostile  environment  in  the  Department  were  or  are  employed  by  Dartmouth  and  had \nsupervisory authority over the Plaintiffs and proposed class members. \n  Dartmouth’s conduct was wanton, malicious, outrageous, and conducted with full \nknowledge of the law. Dartmouth exhibited reckless indifference to the foreseeable risks of harm. \n  Because  of  Dartmouth’s  breach  of  its  fiduciary  duty  owed  to  Plaintiffs  and \nmembers of the proposed class, Plaintiffs and members of the proposed class have suffered and \nwill continue to suffer harm, including but not limited to loss of future educational and employment \nopportunities, humiliation, embarrassment, reputational harm, emotional and physical distress, \nmental anguish, and other economic damages and non-economic damages. \n  Plaintiffs and members of the proposed class have suffered and continue to suffer \ndamages and injuries for which Dartmouth is liable under state law.  \nCOUNT FOUR \n \nNEGLIGENT SUPERVISION AND RETENTION UNDER NEW HAMPSHIRE LAW \n(On Behalf of Plaintiffs, Class Representatives and Class Members) \n  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation in each \nand every aforementioned paragraph as if fully set forth herein. \n  Dartmouth owed Plaintiffs, Class Representatives and members of the proposed \nclass a duty of care to protect them from sexual harassment, which was unwarranted, unwanted \nand improper.  \n67 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 68 of 72\n  Dartmouth breached its duty in its training, supervision and retention of Kelley, \nWhalen, and Heatherton, employees that Dartmouth knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care \nshould have known, were unfit to work with and supervise young, female students. \n  As a direct and proximate result of Dartmouth’s breach of its duty, Plaintiffs and \nmembers of the proposed class were subjected to sexual harassment by Kelley, Whalen, and \nHeatherton. \n  Plaintiffs, Class Representatives and members  of the proposed  class  suffered \ndamages and injuries for which Dartmouth is liable under state law.  \nCOUNT FIVE \nVIOLATION OF TITLE IX OF THE EDUCATION AMENDMENTS OF 1972, \nAS AMENDED — \nQUID PRO QUO SEXUAL HARASSMENT \n20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq. \n(On Behalf of All Plaintiffs) \n  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation in each \nand every aforementioned paragraph as if fully set forth herein. \n  This Count is brought on behalf of all Plaintiffs. \n  Upon information and belief, at all times relevant to this action, Dartmouth has \nreceived, and continues to receive, federal financial assistance. \n  Dartmouth  has  discriminated against Plaintiffs  by creating  and maintaining a \nhostile educational environment in violation of Title IX. The hostile environment endured by the \nPlaintiffs  was  sufficiently  severe,  pervasive,  and  objectively  offensive  to  interfere  with  the \nPlaintiffs’ educational opportunities, undermining and detracting from their school experience. \n  Plaintiffs were subjected to unwelcome quid pro quo sexual harassment based on \ntheir  sex.  They  were  subjected  to  unwelcome  sexual  conduct,  including  sexual  comments, \nunwanted sexual advances, and unwanted touching. Plaintiffs were expected to submit to this \n68 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 69 of 72\nunwelcome sexual conduct in exchange for favorable academic treatment, including mentoring \ntime, research assistance, grades, and other academic opportunities. \n  Dartmouth had actual notice of this conduct by Heatherton, Kelley, and Whalen, \nand was deliberately indifferent to this harassment, both before and after the harassment of \nPlaintiffs occurred. Such deliberate indifference places Plaintiffs and other students at risk of \nsexual harassment.  \n  By reason of the continuous nature of Dartmouth’s unlawful conduct, Plaintiffs \nhave suffered and will continue to suffer harm, including but not limited to loss of future \neducational  and  employment  opportunities,  humiliation,  embarrassment,  reputational  harm, \nemotional and physical distress, mental anguish, and other economic damages and non-economic \ndamages. \n  By reason of the continuous nature of Dartmouth’s unlawful conduct, Plaintiffs are \nentitled to the application of the continuing violation doctrine to the unlawful acts alleged herein.  \n  Plaintiffs are entitled to all legal and equitable remedies available for violations of \nTitle IX, including compensatory damages, attorneys’ fees and costs, and other appropriate relief. \nCOUNT SIX \n \nVIOLATION OF TITLE IX OF THE EDUCATION AMENDMENTS OF 1972, AS \nAMENDED — \nRETALIATION \n20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq. \n(On Behalf of Plaintiffs Chauhan, Brietzke, Brown, Evans, and Doe) \n  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation in each \nand every aforementioned paragraph as if fully set forth herein. \n  This Count is brought on behalf of Plaintiffs Chauhan, Brietzke, Brown, Evans, and \nDoe. \n69 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 70 of 72\n  Upon information and belief, at all times relevant to this action, Dartmouth has \nreceived, and continues to receive, federal financial assistance. \n  Plaintiffs Chauhan, Brietzke, Brown, Evans, and Doe engaged in protected activity \nby participating in the Title IX complaint and investigation. Dartmouth knew that these Plaintiffs \nengaged in this protected activity and subsequently undertook actions disadvantageous to them, \nincluding denying reasonable accommodations, expulsion, unwarranted grades of “fail,” and \nconvening a meeting of all students in the Department to publicly denounce the victims of the \ninvestigation. A retaliatory animus substantially motivated Dartmouth to take these adverse \nactions. \n  Dartmouth’s differential treatment of these Plaintiffs is a direct and proximate result \nof the protected activity they undertook.  \n  Because of the continuous nature of Dartmouth’s unlawful conduct, Plaintiffs have \nsuffered and will continue to suffer harm, including but not limited to loss of future educational \nand employment opportunities, humiliation, embarrassment, reputational harm, emotional and \nphysical distress, mental anguish, and other economic damages and non-economic damages. \n  Because of the continuous nature of Dartmouth’s unlawful conduct, Plaintiffs are \nentitled to the application of the continuing violation doctrine to the unlawful acts alleged herein.  \n  Plaintiffs are entitled to all legal and equitable remedies available for violations of \nTitle IX, including compensatory damages, attorneys’ fees and costs, and other appropriate relief. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF ON CLAIMS \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs and Class Representatives, on their own behalf and on behalf \nof the proposed class, pray that this Court grant the following relief: \n70 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070   Document 1   Filed 11/15/18   Page 71 of 72\nA.

(“Title IX”). \n1 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 2 of 85\nI.  INTRODUCTION  \n  Dartmouth College has knowingly permitted three of its prominent (and well-\nfunded) professors to turn a human behavior research department into a 21st Century Animal \nHouse. For well over a decade, female students in Dartmouth’s Department of Psychological and \nBrain Sciences (the “Department”) have been treated as sex objects by tenured professors Todd \nHeatherton,  William  Kelley,  and  Paul  Whalen.  These  professors  leered  at,  groped,  sexted, \nintoxicated, and even raped female students. \n  These professors ensured the young women in the Department were vulnerable to \nthis sexual harassment by conditioning faculty mentorship and support on students’ participation \nin the alcohol-saturated “party culture” they perpetuated. Among other things, these professors \nconducted professional lab meetings at bars, invited students to late-night “hot tub parties” in their \npersonal homes, and invited undergraduate students to use real cocaine during classes related to \naddiction as part of a “demonstration.” \n  Dartmouth has known about bad behavior by these professors for more than sixteen \nyears. Dartmouth’s supervisory faculty, administrators, officers, and employees (such agents, \nunless referred to by name or position, hereinafter referred to as “Dartmouth”) have received \ncomplaints  of  pervasive  sexual  harassment  and  gender-based  discrimination  perpetuated  by \nProfessors Heatherton, Kelley, and Whalen since at least 2002. But Dartmouth did nothing and \nignored these complaints, thereby ratifying the violent and criminal acts of its professors. \n  In early April 2017, a group of female graduate students, determined to end the \nintolerable  conditions  in  which  they  and  others  were  forced  to  work  and  study,  contacted \nDartmouth’s Title IX office and detailed instances of sexual assault and sexual harassment by these \nthree professors. \n2 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 3 of 85\n  Dartmouth did nothing. As a result, Professor Whalen sexually assaulted Plaintiff \nChauhan twenty days later. At Dartmouth’s suggestion, Plaintiffs and the other women in the \nDepartment continued working with or among the accused professors for nearly four months. The \nsexual harassment continued unabated. \n   Over several months, at least 27 complainants came forward to participate in the \nTitle IX investigation. In October 2017, Dartmouth was forced to publicly disclose the existence \nof the investigation for the very first time after the news was leaked to the media. Days later, on \nOctober 31, 2017, the New Hampshire Attorney General opened a criminal investigation into the \nallegations against the three professors. \n  Dartmouth  eventually  hired  an  outside  attorney  to  conduct  an  “independent \ninvestigation”  in  which  Plaintiffs  were  told  they  would  have  a  voice.  Instead,  Dartmouth \nunilaterally stopped the investigation and allowed the three professors to retire and/or resign in \nJuly 2018, more than fifteen months after Plaintiffs filed their initial complaints. \n  The seven Plaintiffs, each an exemplary female scientist at the start of her career, \ncame to Dartmouth to contribute to a crucial and burgeoning field of academic study. Plaintiffs \nwere instead sexually harassed and sexually assaulted by the Department’s tenured professors and \nexpected to tolerate increasing levels of sexual predation.  \n  Plaintiffs now turn to this Court for appropriate relief to remedy Dartmouth’s past \nwrongs and to force Dartmouth College to enact meaningful reforms that will permit women to \nengage in rigorous scientific study without fear of being sexually harassed and sexually assaulted. \nII.  PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE \n  PLAINTIFF KRISTINA RAPUANO is a natural person who, at all relevant \ntimes, was domiciled in Vermont. \n3 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 4 of 85\n  PLAINTIFF VASSIKI CHAUHAN is a natural person who, at all relevant times, \nwas domiciled in New Hampshire. \n  PLAINTIFF SASHA BRIETZKE is a natural person who, at all relevant times, \nwas domiciled in Vermont. \n  PLAINTIFF ANNEMARIE BROWN is a natural person who, at all relevant \ntimes, was domiciled in New Hampshire or Vermont. \n  PLAINTIFF ANDREA COURTNEY is a natural person who, at all relevant \ntimes, was domiciled in New Hampshire or Vermont. \n  PLAINTIFF MARISSA EVANS is a natural person who, at all relevant times, \nwas domiciled in New Hampshire. \n  PLAINTIFF JANE DOE is a natural person who, at all relevant times, was \ndomiciled in New Hampshire. \n  PLAINTIFF JANE DOE 2 is a natural person who, at all relevant times, was \ndomiciled in New Hampshire or Illinois. \n  PLAINTIFF JANE DOE 3 is a natural person who, at all relevant times, was \ndomiciled in New Hampshire or Rhode Island. \n  DEFENDANT DARTMOUTH COLLEGE is a non-profit corporation organized \nand existing under the laws of New Hampshire that maintains its principal place of business at 63 \nSouth Main Street, Suite 301, Hanover, NH 03755, in this District. \n  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ \n1331 and 1343, because Plaintiffs’ statutory claims under Title IX present a federal question over \nwhich this Court has jurisdiction. Plaintiffs also assert state-law claims over which this Court has \nsupplemental jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367. \n4 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 5 of 85\n  This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendant pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n4(k)(1)(a) because Defendant is domiciled in and conducts business within this Judicial District. \n  This Court is the proper venue under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) and 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n5(f) because Dartmouth is headquartered in this District and many of the unlawful practices \ncomplained of herein occurred in this District, and the events or omissions giving rise to Plaintiffs’ \nclaims occurred in this District. \nIII.  COMMON FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  The Department’s Predators’ Club  \n  Dartmouth College is an elite Ivy League private research university located in the \ntown of Hanover, New Hampshire. Dartmouth has an enrollment of 6,400 students and is one of \nthe nation’s most competitive colleges, with an undergraduate acceptance rate of 8.7%. \n  The  conduct  at  issue  involved  three  celebrated  Dartmouth  professors  in  the \nDepartment, which is considered a “powerhouse” for research and innovation at Dartmouth. The \nDepartment is housed in a state-of-the-art $27 million building and Dartmouth was the first liberal \narts school in the country to have its own fMRI scanner to conduct brain scans. \n  The most senior member and arguably the founder of the three-member “predatory \nclub” that harassed female students was Todd Heatherton. Heatherton was a prolific researcher \nwho received Dartmouth’s prestigious Champion International Professorship endowed chair and \nserved as the Department Chair from 2004 through 2005. Heatherton was instrumental in making \nthe Department a major power center on campus by, among other things, helping to attract what \nwas as of 2005 the largest grant in Dartmouth’s history—$21.8 million to establish a center for \ncognitive and educational neuroscience. \n5 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 6 of 85\n  The predatory club was filled out by two younger brain science scholars who joined \nin Heatherton’s pattern of harassment of female students in the Department. William Kelley joined \nthe Department in 2000 and Paul Whalen joined in 2005. Both Whalen and Kelley received tenure \nthrough the Department, even as three promising female professors did not. All three female \nprofessors  went  on  to  receive  tenure,  prestigious  awards  and  great  success—but  at  other \ninstitutions.  \n  Upon information and belief, Heatherton was instrumental in helping both Kelley \nand Whalen obtain tenure and, once that happened, the three men frequently socialized and \nregularly gathered with each other’s female graduate students at bars in Hanover. \nB.  Dartmouth Ignores Decades of Complaints \n  The  pervasive  sexual  harassment  and  gender-based  discrimination  in  the \nDepartment perpetuated by Heatherton, Kelley, and Whalen was well-known to Dartmouth’s \nsupervisory faculty and administrators since at least 2002. \n  At least two sexual harassment complaints were made against Heatherton in a 12-\nmonth span in 2002. In lieu of responding appropriately to either complaint, Dartmouth rewarded \nProfessor  Heatherton,  first  naming  him  Champion  International  Professor  (after  the  initial \ncomplaint)  and  subsequently  promoting  him  to  Chair  of  the  Department  (after  the  second \ncomplaint). \n  The first complaint arose from an incident that occurred during a public recruiting \nevent for the Department in February 2002. Heatherton grabbed a female graduate student’s \nbreasts and told her that she was “not doing very well” in her work in the lab. The incident was \n6 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 7 of 85\nreported to Dartmouth’s administration, including then-Associate Dean Richard Wright.3 Not long \nafter the report, Dartmouth appointed Heatherton as Champion International Professor. \n  The second complaint stemmed from an incident that occurred in late 2002 or early \n2003, when Heatherton groped the buttocks of two graduate students, one male and one female, \nwhom he approached from behind at a bar. The female graduate student reported this incident to \nthen-Department Chair Howard Hughes (“former Chair Hughes”). In response, former Chair \nHughes encouraged the female graduate student not to “make a fuss” by pursuing the matter \nfurther. Dartmouth then promoted Heatherton to Chair of the Department. \n  Dartmouth  also  received  multiple  complaints  about  an  inappropriate  sexual \nrelationship between Kelley and Jane Doe 3, a female graduate student working in his lab from \n2003 until 2008. In approximately 2004, a female graduate student contacted former Chair Hughes \nand reported that Kelley was having a sexual relationship with Jane Doe 3 that made her very \nuncomfortable. Upon  information  and  belief,  multiple  students  made  similar  complaints  to \nDartmouth between 2005 and 2007. \n  Upon information and belief, a complaint relating to sexual harassment and sex \ndiscrimination was filed against Kelley and Heatherton in 2005. Upon information and belief, \nDartmouth failed to take disciplinary action against either professor. \n  A female graduate student working in Whalen’s lab from 2006 to 2010 complained \nthat Whalen was depriving her of career opportunities that were instead given to another female \ngraduate student in the lab with whom Whalen flirted and favored. \n                                                        \n3 See Britta Greene, Former Professor: Dartmouth Aware of Misconduct Allegations For Years, SLATE (Nov. 16, \n2017), http://www.nhpr.org/post/former-professor-dartmouth-aware-misconduct-allegations-years#stream/0. \n \n7 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 8 of 85\n  Upon information and belief, Professor and Director of Graduate Studies Thalia \nWheatley  (“Director  Wheatley”),  Department  Chair  Dave  Bucci  (“Chair  Bucci”),  and \nadministrators with supervisory authority knew about discriminatory hiring practices within the \nDepartment. Heatherton, Kelley, and Whalen demonstrated an obvious bias toward hiring young, \nattractive female students to work in their labs. Kelley and Whalen treated this endeavor as a \ncompetition and openly debated who had “the hottest lab.” Female students in the Department \nwere pressured to appease the professors by flirting with them. Women ultimately felt that their \nlooks were significant in their being hired rather than their academic achievements. \n  Heatherton, Kelley, and Whalen tied female students’ academic success to the \nstudents’ willingness to tolerate unwanted sexual attention. All three professors favored students \nwho accompanied the men on their frequent drinking binges and engaged in sexual banter or \nsubmitted to unwanted touching and sexual contact. \n  Heatherton, Kelley, and Whalen compelled female students to be objectified and to \nobjectify their female classmates. All three men made inappropriate comments about the students’ \nphysical attractiveness, including explicit references to their breasts. Kelley went so far as to \npublicly “rank” women on a “Papi” scale by which a “0” rating meant he “would never bang” \nunder any circumstances, a “1” rating meant “hot enough that you would bang her if her personality \nwas excellent,” and a “2” rating meant “so hot you would bang her no matter what she was like.”   \n  Upon information and belief, Director Wheatley, Chair Bucci, and administrators \nwith  supervisory  authority  knew  that  Heatherton,  Kelley,  and  Whalen  routinely  injected \nthemselves into the sexual lives of their female students, such as taking “bets” on how long female \nstudents could make their relationships last and advising their female students to “just screw” other \nmembers of the lab. \n8 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 9 of 85\n  Heatherton,  Kelley,  and  Whalen  mostly  ignored  personal  and  professional \nboundaries.  Kelley  regularly  accessed  students’  cell  phones  without  permission  and  sent \ninappropriate messages from the students’ phones to others. Whalen demanded that his highly \neducated students act as his personal masseuses and “walk on his back,” an activity which he \nclaimed his previous students did for him regularly. Whalen also went “shopping” with his female \nstudents, offering to purchase them dresses and shoes he selected for them. \n  Kelley  and  Whalen  openly  conducted  sexual  relationships  with  their  female \nstudents. Upon information and belief, Dartmouth administrators with supervisory authority knew \nKelley and Whalen were involved in these inappropriate relationships. \n  The Department’s faculty have described Dartmouth as “the capital of sexism” and \nlikened the Department to a fraternity house of which Kelley, Whalen, and Heatherton were self-\nappointed co-presidents.  \n  Numerous Dartmouth administrators, including Associate Dean Jay Hull (“Dean \nHull”), Chair Bucci, and current and former students described Whalen as being “touchy,” “a flirt,” \n“a hugger,” and “handsy.” Chair Bucci further acknowledged that he observed Whalen blurring \nprofessional boundaries, or to be “completely lacking” in them. Indeed, over the last decade, \nformer faculty members informed Dartmouth’s administration that they were concerned about \nmisconduct by Kelley, Heatherton, and Whalen. \n  While at a conference in Boston, Director Wheatley witnessed Whalen attempting \nto kiss a woman working in his lab.  \nC.  Dartmouth Fails to Stop the Predators’ Club from Pressuring Female Students into \n“Black Out” Binge Drinking and Unwanted Physical and Sexual Contact                               \n \n  On top of the sexual harassment women in the Department endured, they were also \nforced to reckon with the fact that Heatherton, Kelley, and Whalen conditioned faculty mentorship \n9 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 10 of 85\nand support on student participation in the alcohol-saturated “party culture” they created. This \npractice was both well-known and blatantly ignored by Dartmouth administrators. \n  Examples of the  Department’s “party culture” abound. Kelley  bragged to  his \nstudents that he snorted real cocaine in class during demonstrations related to addiction. Kelley, \nWhalen, and Heatherton openly took shots of alcohol with underage prospective students. When \nhiring undergraduates to work in his lab, Kelley sometimes scheduled the interviews to take place \nat bars and purchased drinks for the underage interviewees. Associate Dean Hull was specifically \naware of Kelley and Whalen’s “tradition” of taking prospective female students out drinking, \npurportedly to observe how the students “handled themselves” while drunk, but did nothing to \ninvestigate or stop it. \n  The three predatory professors pressured their young female graduate students to \naccompany them to local bars and other places to engage in binge drinking. All three professors \npurchased drinks for their female students and encouraged them to drink late into the night. The \nprofessors then regaled their lab members with tales of their alcohol-fueled exploits with other \nstudents, describing how those students got drunk, became ill, and made fools of themselves. \n  On at least one occasion, Kelley encouraged his graduate students to go to a strip \nclub with him while at a conference. \n  Kelley regularly hosted “hot tub parties” and other parties at his house, which has \na fully outfitted bar in the basement. These parties, for which Kelley coined the term “tubby time,” \noften took place late at night after drinking at bars. Not to be outdone, Whalen hosted numerous \nparties at his residence centered around drinking excessively. Both Kelley and Whalen encouraged \ntheir female students to spend the night at their homes after long nights of drinking. \n10 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 11 of 85\n  The lab environment was no less free from pressure to consume alcohol. Lab \nmeetings and one-on-one advising meetings often took place at bars. On the occasions when \nmeetings did take place in the labs, the professors often expected that alcohol be served. Students \nwere flown to conferences across the country and then urged to skip conference events to drink \nwith the professors in bars. Whalen rescheduled important qualifying exams and meetings because \nhe needed to “recover” from binge drinking over the weekend or “get laid.”  \n  Female students who were willing to partake in these activities were rewarded with \nacademic attention, while those who refrained were ignored and neglected academically. Kelley \npublicly labeled one female student “a bitch” for refusing to participate in drinking events. \n  Associate Dean Hull and Director Wheatley confirmed that they both received \nnumerous complaints from graduate students who felt pressured to drink alcohol and socialize with \nKelley and Whalen, and feared retaliation if they refrained from these activities. \n  Instead of acting on their knowledge, Dartmouth administrators emboldened the \npredators’ club to continue their harassment and abusive conduct toward female students without \nfear of punishment. This attitude was on full display when, during the 2010-2011 academic year, \nWhalen announced to his students that a woman in the Department had previously complained \nabout sexual harassment and that it had “backfired,” causing the complainant to “lose resources” \nand to “lose steam in her career.” According to Whalen, the complainant “got what was coming to \nher, of course; you don’t bite the hand that feeds you.” \n  In the three years preceding April 2017, sexual harassment and abuse of female \nstudents became intolerable and students’ complaints became louder. Within that timeframe, \ngraduate students repeatedly spoke out about inappropriate student/advisor relationships during \nannual meetings attended by high-level administrators, including but not limited to Dean Hull, \n11 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 12 of 85\nDirector Wheatley, and Chair Bucci. Upon information and belief, these administrators were \ninformed that multiple students were attending therapy because of their advisors. One graduate \nstudent explicitly told these administrators that this was a “life or death situation,” and someone \nwould commit suicide if Dartmouth refused to act.  \nD.  As Harassment Grows Intolerable, Female Students Band Together to End the \nHarassment and Abuse \n \n  On January 13, 2017, Ms. Rapuano contacted Provost Carolyn Dever (“Provost \nDever”) to report that she was experiencing sexual harassment at Dartmouth and had realized this \nwas  a  pervasive  issue.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Provost  Dever  failed  to  launch  any \ninvestigation of her own and took no steps to protect Ms. Rapuano or other students from sexual \nharassment. \n  In or about late March 2017, several female graduate students came together to \ndiscuss the harassment and abuse they were experiencing in the Department. With no assistance \nfrom Dartmouth, the students researched their legal options, sought support and guidance from \nadvocates and determined that filing a Title IX complaint against the three professors was the best \nfirst step. \n  On April 4, 2017, Ms. Rapuano, Ms. Courtney, and several other graduate students \nmet with Chair Bucci and Director Wheatley to report sexual harassment and sexual assault within \nthe Department. On April 7, 2017, the same group met with Dartmouth’s Title IX coordinator. The \nstudents outlined instances of sexual assault and sexual harassment so extreme as to constitute a \nsexually hostile educational environment and work place, inappropriate conduct, and retaliation \nby Kelley, Whalen, and Heatherton. \n12 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 13 of 85\n  Dartmouth took no immediate action to protect the students who complained. \nWhalen sexually assaulted Ms. Chauhan twenty days after the Title IX complaint was filed, and \nKelley continued to sexually harass Ms. Rapuano through June 2017. \n  Even after these serious complaints were lodged, Dartmouth actually encouraged \nthe victims to continue working with or among Heatherton, Kelley, and Whalen. Dartmouth \nwarned  the  victims  that  the  accused  professors  would  likely  retaliate  against  students  who \ndiscontinued working with them by disparaging them and revoking their academic support, actions \nwhich could result in the victims being expelled or placed on academic probation. Thus, at \nDartmouth’s suggestion, the victims continued working with their  harassers  for nearly  four \nmonths. \n  Dartmouth  waited  nearly  four  months  before  notifying  Kelley,  Whalen,  and \nHeatherton of Plaintiffs’ complaints (on July 20, 2017) and placing them on administrative leave \n(on July 28, 2017). \n  Dartmouth released no information about the three professors’ status even after they \nwere  placed  on  leave.  Concerned  about  the  situation  and  the  College’s  lack  of  candor, \nundergraduate students posted flyers around campus on October 24, 2017, asking “Where is Prof. \nPaul Whalen?” and “Where is Prof. Bill Kelley?” The College newspaper,  The Dartmouth, \nreported on the flyers, and a College spokesperson said only that the three professors were on paid \nleave and under “ongoing investigations into allegations of serious misconduct[.]” \n  On October 31, 2017, the New Hampshire Attorney General opened a criminal \ninvestigation into the allegations against the three professors. \n  Heatherton was on sabbatical leave during the 2017-2018 academic year to work \nas a visiting scholar at New York University (“NYU”) while the Title IX investigation was \n13 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 14 of 85\nongoing. Upon information and belief, Dartmouth failed to disclose the Title IX Investigation or \nthe allegations against Heatherton to NYU, thus enabling him to continue working amongst \nstudents until October 2017. \n  In  response  to  the  Title  IX  Complaint,  Dartmouth  launched  an  “independent \ninvestigation” led by Jennifer Davis, Esquire (“Investigator Davis”), an attorney and self-described \n“independent investigator.” Investigator Davis is on the “approved” list of Dartmouth’s insurer, \nUnited Educators Insurance, whose focus appears to be helping institutions manage risk and \nminimize  liability  stemming  from  wrongdoing  by  employees.4  Indeed,  Investigator  Davis \nseemingly made no effort to address Dartmouth’s prior knowledge of the professors’ conduct or \nto examine Dartmouth’s role in fostering the continuing harassment Plaintiffs experienced.  \n  Investigator Davis demanded extensive confidential information from Plaintiffs, \nincluding privileged mental health records, emails, texts, pictures, and other such information. In \nseveral instances, however, Investigator Davis showed these confidential records to Heatherton, \nWhalen, Kelley, and their attorneys without Plaintiffs’ knowledge or consent. \n  Investigator Davis also conducted numerous lengthy interviews with Plaintiffs and \nothers without advising them of their rights or encouraging them to seek legal counsel. Without \nPlaintiffs’ knowledge or consent, she then shared portions of these interviews with the perpetrators \nand their attorneys. \n  Investigator Davis and Dartmouth’s Title IX office failed to protect Plaintiffs’ \nprivacy by erroneously including one reporting party’s confidential exhibits in a different reporting \nparty’s  folder.  On  several  occasions,  email  communications  from  the  Title  IX  office  were \n                                                        \n4 See JENN DAVIS LLC, https://www.jenndavisllc.com/ (last visited on Nov. 13, 2018). \n14 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 15 of 85\naddressed to the wrong person, revealing the complainant’s identity and confidential information \nto others. \n  Dartmouth included Ms. Brown as a “Reporting Party” to the complaints into \nWhalen’s conduct without Ms. Brown’s knowledge or permission. Ms. Brown learned that she \nwas a Reporting Party for the first time when she unexpectedly received a copy of the investigation \nreport along with, most concerningly, a copy of Whalen’s rebuttal to her specific allegations. Ms. \nBrown was never informed that Whalen would be permitted to review or dispute her allegations.  \n  Investigator  Davis  provided  Dartmouth  with  several  reports  concerning  her \n“findings” in March 2018, eleven months after the April 2017 Title IX complaint was filed. \nPlaintiffs were provided with heavily redacted versions of the sections of the reports that pertained \nto them and given a limited opportunity to correct inaccuracies in the reports. Based on the limited \ninformation Plaintiffs received, Investigator Davis purported to “find” numerous violations of \nDartmouth’s policies and procedures by Heatherton, Kelley, and Whalen. \n  Disciplinary hearings regarding the “findings” were scheduled for July 2018, and \nPlaintiffs were promised an opportunity to be heard and confront their harassers. Dartmouth then \nunilaterally suspended the disciplinary process, permitting Heatherton to retire and accepting \nresignations  from  Kelley  and  Whalen.  Plaintiffs  were  not  consulted  prior  to  Dartmouth’s \ntermination of the Title IX process. \n  Dartmouth  declined  to  provide  Plaintiffs  with  accommodations,  support  or \nguidance, both immediately following their initial complaints to the Title IX office and throughout \nthe investigation. There were three separate Title IX Coordinators while Plaintiffs’ complaint was \npending. The first of these, Heather Lindkvist, implicitly discouraged Plaintiffs from coming \nforward. \n15 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 16 of 85\n  Since it unilaterally terminated the Title IX process, Dartmouth has taken no action \nthat would demonstrate any intent to investigate how the abuse perpetrated upon Plaintiffs could \nhave happened and/or to make any changes that would prevent it from happening again. \n  Instead, Dartmouth has taken steps to silence the victims and discourage them from \npursuing legal action or demanding change within Dartmouth. On September 12, 2018, Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel sent Dartmouth a letter detailing Plaintiffs’ claims and the basis for Dartmouth’s liability \nunder Title IX and other statutes. Days later, Chair Bucci and Director Wheatley convened a \nmeeting with all graduate students in the Department. When the students arrived, they saw that the \nTitle IX Coordinator, Kristi Clemens, was also present, and Chair Bucci and Director Wheatley \nhad called this meeting to, in their words, “dispel rumors” about the Title IX investigation.  \n  It became quickly apparent that the meeting was a public platform to disparage the \nvictims and discourage them from pursuing legal action. Chair Bucci accused the victims of \n“pulling the Department backwards rather than forward” by continuing to demand change at \nDartmouth.  Chair  Bucci  and  Director  Wheatley  criticized  the  victims  for  questioning  their \ninvolvement in the facts giving rise to the Title IX complaints and said that it was “very unfair” of \nthe students to discuss the prior complaints about Heatherton and implied that these complaints \nwere irrelevant. Finally, they took pains to dispute and justify several aspects of the investigation \nthat Plaintiffs’ attorneys explicitly criticized in their September 12, 2018, letter. \n  After the departure of Heatherton, Kelley, and Whalen, Dartmouth convened a \nsearch committee to hire their replacements. Upon information and belief, 158 applications were \nsubmitted for the three positions; from these, Dartmouth’s selection committee shortlisted 11 \ncandidates. Only two of the shortlisted candidates are women.  \n16 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 17 of 85\n  After  Plaintiffs’  Complaint  was  filed  on  November  15,  2018,  a  number  of \nindividuals associated with the Department came forward and shared their own experiences with \nHeatherton,  Whalen,  and  Kelley.  Former  graduate  students  corroborated  the  environment \ndescribed by Plaintiffs. Individuals who declined employment offers from Dartmouth attributed \ntheir decision, in part, to the accused professors. Other professionals in the field claimed that \nrumors of sexual misconduct, a heavy drinking culture, poor student/faculty boundaries, and a \n“boys’ club” environment in the Department had circulated for years. \n  One former female graduate student published an article in which she explained \nthat “[t]he seeds of the current allegations were already sown 15 years ago while [she] was there” \nand wrote that the accused professors routinely “pushed [students’] boundaries” by initiating \nsexual conversations, joking about the details of students’ sex lives, and pressuring students to \ndrink excessive amounts of alcohol. Another former graduate student wrote that “[t]he victims of \nthis culture are much greater in number than 7” and stated that he witnessed first-hand the “sex-\ntalk,” the “party culture in the program that spiraled so out of control,” and a sexual relationship \nbetween a graduate student and faculty member. Yet another former graduate student claimed that \nsome of the actions described in the lawsuit were entirely normalized during her five years in the \nDepartment. A former Assistant Professor at Dartmouth wrote that she once attended a dinner with \nWhalen and Kelley in which they discussed women’s breasts. \n  Individuals who were offered faculty positions at Dartmouth explained that the \naccused professors’ inappropriate conduct factored into their decision to decline their employment \noffers. One such individual said that Whalen made inappropriate comments to his partner and \nshowed her photos of his graduate students while discussing how “hot” they were. Another \nindividual wrote: “I sought advice from at least 20 people and the supermajority of them mentioned \n17 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 18 of 85\nWhalen, Kelley, and Heatherton. This was not a few victims sharing their own stories—this \ninformation was widely known . . . the groping sounded rampant[.]” \n   On  December  6,  2018,  nearly  800  members  of  the  Dartmouth  community \n(including current and former undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty, and staff) signed \nan open letter5 to President Hanlon and the Board of Trustees condemning Dartmouth’s failure to \nprotect its students from sexual assault and harassment. The letter, issued by the Dartmouth \nCommunity Against Gender Harassment and Sexual Violence, stated, in part: “As members of the \nDartmouth community spanning several generations, we are acutely aware that these were not \nisolated incidents, but rather part of an institutional culture that minimizes and disregards sexual \nviolence and gender harassment . . . . We stand, outraged, in solidarity with the courageous \nindividuals who filed this lawsuit, and with the countless students, staff, and faculty who have \nendured sexual violence and gender harassment throughout Dartmouth’s history.” \nIV.  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  \nA.  Kristina Rapuano’s Factual Allegations \n  Ms. Rapuano graduated in the top two percent of her undergraduate class with a \nBachelor of Science in Psychology in 2010. She enrolled in graduate studies at Dartmouth College \nin 2012, where she worked as a Ph.D. student and teaching assistant. While at Dartmouth, Ms. \nRapuano won numerous awards, recognitions, and scholarships for her performance as a graduate \nstudent and as a teaching assistant. She has a strong publication record and has routinely given \ntalks and poster presentations at academic conferences across the country.  \n                                                        \n5 See https://www.nhpr.org/sites/nhpr/files/201812/statement_of_support-final.pdf (last visited May 01, 2019). \n18 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 19 of 85\n  On approximately March 14, 2014, Ms. Rapuano met Whalen in his office to assist \nhim in grading final exams. She returned to her office after they finished grading the exams. Soon \nafter, she received a text message from Whalen summoning her back to his office. \n  When Ms. Rapuano entered Whalen’s office, he closed the door, turned the lights \noff, sat down next to her on the couch, and proceeded to try and touch her over her clothes. \n  When Ms. Rapuano stood and tried to leave, Whalen followed her and pinned her \nagainst the wall. He then repeatedly tried to put his hands into her pants over her objections and \ndemands that he stop touching her. \n  Whalen persisted until Ms. Rapuano forcefully removed his hands from her pants. \n  Not long after this incident, Whalen told Ms. Rapuano that he had altered the curve \nfor one of his courses (for which Ms. Rapuano was the teaching assistant) so that a young woman \nin his class would receive an “A-” in the course, despite the negative impact on the other students.  \n  Kelley largely ignored Ms. Rapuano when she first began working in his lab and \nabstained from socializing or drinking with him. Leading up to and during the 2014-2015 school \nyear, Ms. Rapuano finally succumbed to Kelley’s pressure to act as his “drinking buddy.” She \nnoticed an increase in Kelley’s interest in working with her professionally and providing her with \nacademic support. \n  In March 2015, both Ms. Rapuano and Kelley attended the annual conference of \nthe Cognitive Neuroscience Society (“CNS”) in San Francisco, California. Ms. Rapuano booked \na flight to the CNS Conference leaving on Saturday, March 28, 2015, and reserved her own hotel \nroom. When Kelley learned of Ms. Rapuano’s travel plans, he changed her flight so that she would \narrive in San Francisco a day earlier, claiming that it would be better if he and Ms. Rapuano had \nmore time together at the conference. Kelley then suggested that Ms. Rapuano stay in his hotel \n19 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 20 of 85\nroom for the night, despite knowing—and failing to inform Ms. Rapuano—that his hotel room had \njust one bed in it. \n  Kelley instructed Ms. Rapuano to meet him at the hotel bar, even though she would \nnot arrive at the hotel until nearly 12:00 a.m. After drinking at the hotel bar, Kelley urged Ms. \nRapuano to accompany him to another bar, encouraging her to continue drinking until she became \nintoxicated.  \n  Earlier in the night, Ms. Rapuano sent Kelley a text message explicitly stating that \nshe wanted to have fun but “nothing else.” Once she became inebriated, however, Kelley chose to \nignore her message that sexual contact was unwelcome.  \n  Kelley sexually assaulted Ms. Rapuano in the early hours of March 28, 2015, by \nhaving  vaginal  intercourse  and  other  sexual  contact  with  her  when  he  knew  she  was  too \nincapacitated to consent.  \n  In the morning, Kelley told Ms. Rapuano that they had “had sex” two times, and \nthat Ms. Rapuano had “freaked out” at some point during the sexual interaction.  \n  Ms. Rapuano has no memory of engaging in sexual intercourse, nor does she recall \nleaving the bar or how they returned to the hotel. Based on her physical state the following day, \nshe has wondered whether Kelley drugged her.  \n  For his part, Kelley acknowledged on different occasions that he was well aware of \nMs. Rapuano’s level of intoxication and knew that she had no recollection of that night. \n  After sexually assaulting Ms. Rapuano in March 2015, Kelley began to pursue an \ninappropriate sexual relationship with her, using his position of power to exert control over her \npersonal and professional life and threatening retribution when she rejected or did not sufficiently \nrespond to his advances. \n20 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 21 of 85\n  On numerous occasions, Kelley summoned Ms. Rapuano to his office under the \nguise of academic advising and then aggressively initiated sexual activity with her. \n  Between March 2015 and July 2017, Kelley regularly sent Ms. Rapuano sexually \ngraphic text messages. For example, Kelley sent her photographs of penises—including his own—\nand asked Ms. Rapuano to “compare them.” Kelley also sent Ms. Rapuano pictures of sex toys, \nasked her what she was wearing, demanded that she send him sexually graphic photographs of \nherself, and urged her to talk about his sexual fantasies. \n  During the 2015-2016 school year, Ms. Rapuano expressed her discomfort with \nKelley’s sexual advances and attempted to reestablish a professional working relationship with \nhim. Kelley ignored each such attempt and continued to pressure her into sexual contact. \n  For example, Ms. Rapuano attempted to end their sexual relationship after learning \nthat Heatherton had heard “rumors” that Ms. Rapuano and Kelley were sexually involved. In \nresponse, Kelley told Ms. Rapuano he was “going to keep putting [his] tongue in [her] whenever \n[he] want[s].”  \n  Ms. Rapuano observed a direct correlation between Kelley’s willingness to support \nher as his graduate student and the degree to which she complied with his sexual demands. She \npointed this out to Kelley on numerous occasions, telling him that he was crippling her academic \nadvancement by pursuing a sexual relationship with her and was not providing her with the \nacademic support she needed as his graduate student. Kelley reacted to each such attempt with \nanger and hostility, cementing Ms. Rapuano’s fears of retaliation. \n  When Ms. Rapuano rejected Kelley’s sexual advances or was not sufficiently \nresponsive to his lewd and suggestive text messages, he would deprive her of academic guidance \nand refuse to schedule meetings to discuss her research. \n21 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 22 of 85\n  In November 2015, Kelley attempted to undermine Ms. Rapuano’s academic career \nby offering a data set she had been working on to other members of the lab.  \n  To escape Kelley’s harassment—at least for a short time—Ms. Rapuano applied to \nand was ultimately awarded a prestigious fellowship that allowed her to work abroad for part of \nthe 2016-2017 academic year beginning in July 2016. \n  When Kelley learned of Ms. Rapuano’s fellowship, his retaliation and attempts to \nsabotage her career escalated as punishment for her decision to leave Dartmouth. \n  In April 2016, a paper Ms. Rapuano co-authored with the professor with whom she \nwould be working with abroad was published in a well-respected journal. Rather than commending \nthe accomplishment, Kelley reacted violently, berating Ms. Rapuano for failing to inform him she \nwas working on a paper with a different professor and accusing her of acting “unprofessionally.”  \nKelley then threatened not to sign her annual progress report for her graduate fellowship. \n  On May 2, 2016, Ms. Rapuano objected to Kelley’s reaction, which she interpreted \nas stemming from feelings of jealousy and possessiveness. Ms. Rapuano told Kelley “allowing \nprofession[al] and personal lines to blur together” was negatively impacting her career, writing:  \n“I feel that you have been incredibly disrespectful and abrasive these past few days \nand  as  much  as  I  try  to  distance  myself  from  that,  and  re-establish \nprofessionalism, you seem to push back even harder in unprofessional ways. As \nmy advisor, I hope you can understand how toxic that hostile environment can \nbe and how unproductive it is for getting work done . . . I cannot handle the amount \nof emotional manipulation that you’ve incited, and would feel forced to seek out \npossible solutions elsewhere if this continues to be a problem.” \n  In the months before Ms. Rapuano’s departure, Kelley became increasingly hostile \ntowards her. He texted Ms. Rapuano almost daily with unfounded criticisms and placed pressures \non her that were obviously motivated by his personal feelings. \n  On different occasions, Kelley told Ms. Rapuano that he was “letting her go” but \nhe was “not happy” about it. \n22 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 23 of 85\n  Prior to her departure, Ms. Rapuano proposed a collaboration on a project with \nKelley and a post-doctoral fellow working in Heatherton and Kelley’s joint lab. Kelley initially \nagreed to and supported the collaboration. However, when Ms. Rapuano attempted to execute the \ncollaboration in July 2016, Kelley flatly refused and told Ms. Rapuano: “I will not be working \nwith you on this project or any other project going forward.”   \n  Kelley then demanded that Ms. Rapuano destroy the data she had brought abroad \nwith her to work on during her fellowship. \n  In July 2016, Kelley explicitly asked Ms. Rapuano if she was interested in a sexual \nrelationship with him. She answered that she was not. Nonetheless, on July 21, 2016, Kelley \nconfirmed that he was unwilling to separate his personal feelings for her from his professional \nobligations as her advisor. In an email to Ms. Rapuano, Kelley wrote:  \n“Professionally. I’m sad. And jealous. Maybe because of how I feel personally. \nProbably so. . . . I feel like I’m #1 personally, but #10 professionally, somewhere \nbehind other European names I can’t pronounce that have amazing tools my lab \nshould use. I need to feel #1 professionally to be a good advisor. . . . I need to be \nfirst in your eyes as an academic so that I can feel comfortable about sharing you \n. . . Maybe that’s not a fair ask, but I need it. . . . I don’t know how to separate the \npersonal from the professional. I don’t know that it makes sense to do so.” \n \n  In response, Ms. Rapuano told Kelley that she was “terrified” that her academic \nsuccess had become contingent on personal relations with him.  \n  Kelley’s inappropriate and retaliatory behavior grew so extreme that Ms. Rapuano \ncontacted Heatherton to voice her concerns. Ms. Rapuano told Heatherton that Kelley’s behavior \nhad put her in “a very difficult situation” that left her feeling “stuck,” and she feared Kelley would \nrefuse to allow her back into the lab upon completion of her fellowship.  \n23 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 24 of 85\n  Heatherton later told Ms. Rapuano that he spoke with Kelley and acknowledged the \nobvious tension in the lab. Upon information and belief, Heatherton failed to take meaningful steps \nto remedy Kelley’s behavior, despite expressly acknowledging that a problem existed. \n  In August 2016, Ms. Rapuano briefly returned to the United States for a conference. \nWhile at Dartmouth, she encountered Kelley and his girlfriend at a departmental barbecue. Ms. \nRapuano tried to keep her distance and avoided interacting with him. This visibly enraged Kelley. \n  Kelley abruptly cancelled several professional advisor meetings he had scheduled \nwith Ms. Rapuano in retaliation for her failure to personally engage with him at the barbecue. \n  Kelley also sent Ms. Rapuano several threatening and offensive emails that he \ncharacterized as “professional advice.” His “professional advice” included verbally berating Ms. \nRapuano for not engaging with him at the barbeque and accusing her of being “unprofessional,” \n“childish,” and “playing dumb.” When Ms. Rapuano attempted to speak with Kelley about his \noutburst, he refused to meet with her. \n  After this encounter, Ms. Rapuano again attempted to establish a professional \nrelationship with Kelley and highlight his inappropriate behavior, writing to him: \n“The very fact that you are upset about a personal interaction is by definition \nunprofessional. The fact that you are willing to sacrifice professional meetings \nbecause of your personal feelings is unprofessional. The fact that I am terrified of \nyou right now and do not know how to interact with you in front of people, let alone \nyour girlfriend and daughter, is unprofessional.” \n \n  Later that day, Ms. Rapuano met with Kelley and implored him to separate his \npersonal feelings from the professional aspects of their relationship. Kelley refused to engage in a \nconversation on this topic or respond to Ms. Rapuano’s concerns in any meaningful way. \n  In January 2017, Ms. Rapuano returned to Dartmouth and began to more forcefully \nreject Kelley’s advances and express her discomfort with his conduct. \n24 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 25 of 85\n  During her first meeting with Kelley, Ms. Rapuano was driven to tears by his \ndemanding, cold, and angry demeanor. When Kelley observed Ms. Rapuano crying, he told her \nthat she “just had to be nice to him.” Ms. Rapuano interpreted his statement as indicating that her \nprofessional success was once again contingent on her willingness to fulfill Kelley’s sexual \ndemands. \n  On January 13, 2017, Ms. Rapuano contacted Provost Dever to report that she was \nexperiencing sexual harassment at Dartmouth and had realized this was a pervasive issue. Upon \ninformation and belief, Provost Dever failed to launch any investigation of her own and took no \nsteps to protect Ms. Rapuano from sexual harassment, which continued unabated. \n  Between February 2017 and March 2017, Kelley continued to send Ms. Rapuano \ndemeaning and sexually explicit text messages. On many occasions, Ms. Rapuano told Kelley to \nstop sending her sexual messages and told him that she did not feel right responding to his sexual \nquestions. But Kelley persisted. \n  When Ms. Rapuano rejected his advances, Kelley became increasingly hostile and \ndifficult to work with. He cancelled meetings and refused to review Ms. Rapuano’s work or \nprovide her with academic support. \n  On one occasion, Kelley learned that the graduate students had planned a happy \nhour outing without consulting him. He accused the graduate students of being disloyal and rude \nand texted Ms. Rapuano, “fuck you all . . . It’s amazing how ignorant you can all be sometimes.” \n  In March 2017, Kelley and a group of graduate students, including Ms. Rapuano, \nattended the Social & Affective Neuroscience Society (“SANS”) Conference in Los Angeles, \nCalifornia. Kelley witnessed Ms. Rapuano speaking with her ex-boyfriend and flew into a jealous \n25 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 26 of 85\nrage.  He  accused  Ms.  Rapuano  of  exhibiting  “complete  disrespect”  for  him  at  the  SANS \nConference and told her that he was losing interest in seeing or communicating with her. \n  Soon after, Ms. Rapuano again explicitly told Kelley that she had no interest in a \nsexual relationship with him. She further informed him that he had taken advantage of her at the \nMarch  2015  CNS  Conference  by  initiating  sexual  intercourse  with  her  when  she  was  too \nintoxicated to consent and after she had specifically told him she was not interested. She explained \nthat she felt her professional success depended on her reaction to his sexual advances, writing: “I \nfelt like if I stopped . . . the professional attention would stop. I felt like I had opened a door that \ncould not be closed[.]”   \n  In  response,  Kelley  told  Ms.  Rapuano  that  her  explanation  was  “incredibly \noffensive.” Kelley then attempted to revoke his agreement that Ms. Rapuano complete her Ph.D. \nin a sixth year at Dartmouth and attempted to coerce her into leaving early, suggesting that she \nabandon her plans and adhere to a shorter timeline so that she could get her degree as soon as \npossible and leave the school.  \n  Kelley told Ms. Rapuano that his professional advice would be to “change her \nsituation.” He made clear that his opinion was directly related to her disinterest in a sexual \nrelationship with him, writing: “You just wrote an essay about how I completely fucked you over \nand you don't want to be here and do science . . . You're not getting anything done here and are \nreally bitter. Let's try to move you to a better place.” \n  Kelley continued to pressure Ms. Rapuano to leave Dartmouth and told her that he \nwould be happier when she was gone. \n  Kelley’s sexual  involvement with students was well-known to administrators, \nfaculty,  and  students  at  Dartmouth,  especially  within  the  Department.  When  Ms.  Rapuano \n26 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 27 of 85\nconfronted Kelley about these past relationships with students, he acknowledged, “I guess I have \na reputation.” \n  In late March or early April of 2017, Ms. Rapuano learned that other female \nstudents in the Department had experienced unwelcome sexual conduct from several professors. \nAfter hearing these stories—which were like her own—Ms. Rapuano realized there was a pattern \nof sexual misconduct within the Department. \n  Ms. Rapuano was one of the students who reported sexual misconduct by the three \nprofessors to Chair Bucci, Director Wheatley, and the Title IX office on April 4 and April 7, 2017.  \n  Because Dartmouth failed to act for months after that report, Ms. Rapuano was \nsubjected to continued sexual harassment as she continued to work in Kelley’s lab.  \n  Between April 2017 and July 2017, Kelley continued to send Ms. Rapuano sexually \nsuggestive text messages. When Ms. Rapuano ignored his advances, Kelley targeted her for \nridicule and criticism and became increasingly unavailable for meetings or academic-related \ndiscussions. \n  On  April 26, 2017, Kelley refused to meet with Ms. Rapuano regarding her \ndissertation proposal, telling her that there was “no need” to meet because he was just going to tell \nthe Department that she “didn’t do it yet”—which would have resulted in Ms. Rapuano being \nplaced on academic probation. Kelley then began to avoid Ms. Rapuano and refused to schedule \nmeetings with her. \n  After weeks of denying Ms. Rapuano academic guidance and subjecting her to \nunwarranted criticism and ridicule, Kelley contacted her on May 8, 2017, to ask that she come to \nhappy hour because he wanted to see her “smiling face.” When Ms. Rapuano refused to meet him, \nKelley returned to ignoring her academically. \n27 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 28 of 85\n  During a retreat on June 12, 2017, Kelley refused to provide necessary feedback on \nMs. Rapuano’s academic presentation. After the retreat, however, Kelley summoned her to his \noffice. Ms. Rapuano, fearing retaliation and faced with Dartmouth’s inaction to date, reluctantly \nwent. When she arrived, Kelley initiated unwelcome sexual activity with her. \n  On May 31, 2017, Ms. Rapuano initiated plans to switch to a different professor’s \nlab. Dartmouth did not transfer her to a new lab until July 28, 2017. Prior to Ms. Rapuano’s self-\ninitiated request, Dartmouth offered her no academic accommodations and instead left her under \nthe supervision of the man who assaulted and harassed her. \n  After Ms. Rapuano reported sexual misconduct to Dartmouth in April 2017, she \nsought mental health treatment at the College’s student health clinic. When she explained that she \nwanted to discuss the trauma and emotional distress resulting from Kelley’s conduct and the Title \nIX investigation, she was turned away. Dartmouth advised her to seek mental health treatment \nelsewhere, even though Dartmouth’s health insurance would not cover these expenses. \n  Ms. Rapuano turned down multiple offers from other graduate programs to attend \nDartmouth, which she viewed as the dominant player in the social neuroscience field to which she \nhoped to contribute as a leader and scholar. Her ambitions were quickly crushed. Kelley initially \nignored her and made her feel incompetent. Only when she gave in to Kelley’s pressure to join his \ndrinking club did this begin to change. As Kelley’s personal interest in her increased, he rewarded \nher academically, causing her to doubt whether the increased opportunities were solely related to \nhis sexual interest in her. Indeed, Ms. Rapuano expressed concerns about the poster Kelley slated \nher to present at the California conference where he sexually assaulted her.  \n  As Kelley’s harassment escalated, Ms. Rapuano’s mental health deteriorated, and \nshe experienced extreme depression—requiring her to take psychotropic medication for the first \n28 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 29 of 85\ntime in her adult life—in addition to having Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, suicidal thoughts, a \nsuicide attempt, and physical symptoms such as nausea, insomnia, weight loss, nightmares, and \nlack of focus and motivational issues. Combined, these effects have dramatically impacted Ms. \nRapuano’s life and career in nearly every way possible. \nB.  Vassiki Chauhan’s Factual Allegations \n  Ms. Chauhan is a fourth-year graduate student in the Department who worked as \nWhalen’s  teaching  assistant.  She  enrolled  in  Dartmouth’s  graduate  program  in  2015  after \ncompleting her master’s degree on a prestigious merit-based scholarship. Ms. Chauhan has a strong \nacademic and research record throughout her graduate studies, including poster presentations at \nconferences and authoring a peer reviewed paper. \n  On April 4, 2017 and April 7, 2017, several Plaintiffs and other graduate students \nreported Heatherton, Kelley, and Whalen for sexual misconduct. \n  Dartmouth took no action for months. Whalen sexually assaulted Ms. Chauhan on \nApril 24-25, 2017, weeks after the initial complaints were made. \n  On  April  24,  2017,  Whalen  pressured  Ms.  Chauhan  into  drinking  with  him, \nrepeatedly ordering and paying for her drinks. Whalen then suggested that she accompany him \nback to his home for another drink. \n  When Whalen attempted to initiate sexual contact, Ms. Chauhan forcefully rejected \nhis advances and told him not to touch her. Ms. Chauhan tried to leave his house several times by \ngoing downstairs. Each time, Whalen followed her downstairs and prevented her from leaving.  \n  Whalen then forced her to engage in nonconsensual intercourse with him.  \n  When Ms. Chauhan told him to at least use protection, Whalen laughed and told \nher, “that is one thing I am not going to do.”  \n29 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 30 of 85\n  The next day, Whalen pressured Ms. Chauhan into meeting him and asked her \nwhether she thought their encounter was consensual, demanding that she keep it private and tell \nno one. \n  Following her sexual assault, Ms. Chauhan was in physical pain. As a result, she \nvisited Dartmouth’s medical facility and sought medical attention. After examining Ms. Chauhan, \nthe medical practitioner asked if the sexual encounter had been forced. Whalen suggested that Ms. \nChauhan was merely being “paranoid” for seeking medical treatment. \n  In the weeks following the assault, Whalen continued to persistently text Ms. \nChauhan late at night to ask her to meet him at a bar, on one occasion suggesting that they should \nmeet for a drink to “celebrate” when her medical test results came back. \n  Ms. Chauhan suffered sexual harassment and a hostile environment at the hands of \nKelley and Whalen from the beginning of her time at Dartmouth. \n  Ms. Chauhan first became acquainted with Kelley when she was run over by his \ncar while she was walking on a street near campus. Kelley’s car hit her with enough force to knock \nher down and send her belongings flying across the street. Ms. Chauhan later learned that Kelley \nand his girlfriend, who was allegedly driving at the time, had been drinking earlier that day. Ms. \nChauhan met Kelley for the very first time that day, when he stopped to apologize for hitting her \nwith his car. \n  A few months later, Kelley overheard Ms. Chauhan discussing potential Halloween \ncostumes and suggested that she dress as “roadkill.” He continued to call Ms. Chauhan by the \nnickname “roadkill” for the next two years. \n  Whalen initiated inappropriate sexual conversations with Ms. Chauhan, such as \ninquiring about her sexual history and the status of her relationship. \n30 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 31 of 85\n  Ms. Chauhan was also present for multiple conversations in which Kelley openly \ndiscussed his plans to break up Ms. Rapuano and her boyfriend and advised other female graduate \nstudents to break up with their boyfriends.  \n  Kelley regularly accessed students’ cell phones without permission to send out \ninappropriate messages to others. For example, Kelley once accessed Ms. Chauhan’s Facebook \npage and changed her status to: “I am going to streak across the green on my birthday at midnight; \nbe there or be square.” This message was transmitted to Ms. Chauhan’s friends and family. Kelley \ndid this without Ms. Chauhan’s knowledge or permission. \n  Like the other Plaintiffs, Ms. Chauhan felt pressured to drink, socialize, and endure \ninappropriate behavior by the Department’s faculty members because this was the sole route to \nbuilding and maintaining necessary relationships with her faculty advisors. Ms. Chauhan observed \nthat Kelley and Whalen always seemed to be trying to get their graduate students drunk. \n  The first time Whalen witnessed Ms. Chauhan purchasing a drink at a bar, he came \nup to her and exclaimed, “I can’t believe you’re this much fun! I thought you were just a shy \nperson.” \n  Ms. Chauhan contacted two Title IX Coordinators multiple times and requested to \ndeliver a victim impact statement during Whalen’s disciplinary hearing. Dartmouth scheduled \nWhalen’s hearing to take place on a day when it knew Ms. Chauhan was unavailable to attend and \nthen unilaterally terminated the process, thus depriving Ms. Chauhan of the opportunity to confront \nWhalen. \n  Ms. Chauhan attended the October 2018 meeting between Chair Bucci, Director \nWheatley, the Title IX Coordinator, and the Department’s graduate students. When Ms. Chauhan \ncriticized Chair Bucci for his statements, he responded by telling her that her anger at Dartmouth \n31 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 32 of 85\nwas misplaced and she should, instead, be angry at the professors who hurt her. This all but \nconfirmed  Ms.  Chauhan  as  a  victim  in  front  of  the  Department’s  entire  graduate  student \npopulation. \n  Ms. Chauhan came to Dartmouth as an international student from a culture that \nvalued modesty and religion. Having studied at excellent institutions throughout the world, Ms. \nChauhan chose Dartmouth because she thought it would provide her with a solid foundation as a \nresearcher and scientist. After she was sexually assaulted on April 25, 2017, Ms. Chauhan sought \nprofessional counseling services at Dartmouth’s health center. During that session, Ms. Chauhan \ndetailed her most private thoughts and feelings about the assault. Shortly thereafter, Investigator \nDavis demanded that Ms. Chauhan provide her counseling records to her and assured her that they \nwould be treated as “confidential.” Ms. Chauhan was appalled to learn, in the Title IX report, that \nInvestigator Davis showed her private counseling records to the perpetrator and his attorneys to \nseek their “response.”  \n  Ms. Chauhan feels so betrayed by that action that she cannot trust therapists enough \nto seek the treatment she knows she needs. Combined, the assault, harassment and betrayal of her \nmost private confidences have left Ms. Chauhan severely depressed, anxious and with difficulty \nfocusing  and  motivating  herself  to  complete  her  work.  Her  academic  achievements  and \nproductivity have suffered greatly due to her experiences at Dartmouth and her participation in the \nTitle IX investigation. These experiences have had lasting effects on Ms. Chauhan’s mental health \nand emotional state. She is plagued with doubts about her future prospects in academia and has \nlost her optimism for her well-being in personal relationships. \n \n \n \n \n32 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 33 of 85\nC.  Sasha Brietzke’s Factual Allegations \n  Ms. Brietzke is a current graduate student who began working in Kelley’s lab in \nthe fall of 2016. She is a promising researcher who has received positive evaluations from her \nadvisor and presented at professional academic conferences. \n  Heatherton sexually harassed and inappropriately touched Ms. Brietzke on two \nseparate occasions in March 2017 while attending the SANS Conference with a group of the \nDepartment’s students and professors. \n  Heatherton joined Ms. Brietzke and several other conference attendees at the Abbey \nNightclub, where he stood extremely close to Ms. Brietzke and placed his hand on her lower back \nin a way that made her uncomfortable.  \n  The  next  night,  Ms.  Brietzke  attended  a  karaoke  event  after the  conference. \nHeatherton spotted Ms. Brietzke and continuously called for her to join him.  \n  Heatherton grabbed Ms. Brietzke and groped her buttocks. He then grabbed her \nwaist and pulled her into his lap and asked her what she was “going to be doing later that night.” \nShocked and terrified, Ms. Brietzke jumped from his lap and left the venue.  \n  Kelley  and  Whalen  created  a  highly  sexualized  and  hostile  environment that \nprevented Ms. Brietzke from availing herself of the benefits of her educational and professional \npursuits at Dartmouth. \n  Kelley,  Whalen,  and  Heatherton  all  prided  themselves  on  having  young  and \nattractive females in their labs. During a lab meeting, Heatherton announced that he found it \nsocially rewarding when women smiled at him. Kelley frequently discussed how Ms. Brietzke and \nthe other female students in his lab were “hot,” often bragging that he had “the hottest lab.” On \none occasion, Kelley commented that his lab assistants were “hotter” than Whalen’s. \n33 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 34 of 85\n  Ms. Brietzke felt objectified and treated as a “doll” by Kelley. Kelley often made \ninappropriate and objectifying comments about Ms. Brietzke’s physical appearance, such as \nregularly commenting on the size of her breasts, complimenting her make-up, and inquiring about \nher relationship status. Kelley also urged Ms. Brietzke to date his male friends, whom he instructed \nto flirt with Ms. Brietzke and give her hugs even after she expressed disinterest. When Ms. Brietzke \ndid not respond with enthusiasm to his comments, Kelley became inattentive towards her and her \nwork. \n  While playing a game called “Heads Up!” (a variation of Charades in which the \nplayers act out words and phrases for adult content) with Ms. Rapuano, Ms. Brietzke, and Ms. \nChauhan, Kelley referred to a push-up bra by yelling, “[Ms. Rapuano] would wear this but [Ms. \nBrietzke] wouldn’t.”  Kelley also referred to chaps by stating, “Assless! You wear these, assless \nones.” \n  Kelley also made sexual and demeaning comments about other women in Ms. \nBrietzke’s presence. For example, Kelley described another woman in the Department as “a bitch” \nand regularly told Ms. Brietzke that he found Ms. Courtney physically attractive. Ms. Brietzke was \npresent for conversations in which Kelley asked Ms. Courtney about her sex life and the size of \nher partner’s penis. On one occasion, Kelley urged Ms. Brietzke to participate in an “intervention” \nhe staged to encourage another female graduate student to break up with her boyfriend. \n  Ms. Brietzke, like other women in the Department, felt that she had to drink and \nsocialize with Kelley and Whalen to receive academic attention. Indeed, Kelley once told Ms. \nBrietzke that another female graduate student was “a bitch” because she had not come drinking \nwith him that night. \n34 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 35 of 85\n  Kelley pressured Ms. Brietzke, Ms. Rapuano, and Ms. Courtney to meet him at bars \nduring non-working hours on a moment’s notice, often texting them nonstop until they agreed to \nmeet with him socially. Whalen regularly bought Ms. Brietzke drinks at bars without asking her \nand without regard for Ms. Brietzke’s discomfort with accepting alcoholic beverages purchased \nfor her by a faculty member. He also purchased extravagant meals costing hundreds of dollars for \nMs. Brietzke and other female students. \n  On April 4, 2017, and April 7, 2017, Ms. Rapuano, Ms. Courtney, and several other \ngraduate students complained of sexual harassment, sexual assault, inappropriate conduct, and \nretaliation by Kelley, Whalen, and Heatherton to Chair Bucci, Director Wheatley, and Dartmouth’s \nTitle IX office. \n  Dartmouth took no action for months. As a result, the sexual harassment and hostile \nenvironment perpetuated by Kelley, Whalen, and Heatherton continued unabated. \n  After the April 2017 Title IX complaints, Whalen remarked that Ms. Brietzke \n“didn’t like him” and invited her to watch a movie in his home. When Ms. Brietzke declined, \nWhalen asked what he had to do to make her like him. \n  Another female student involved in the Title IX reporting sought another advisor \nand did not attend a lab meeting with Kelley. When he asked where this student was, Ms. Brietzke \nfeigned ignorance and stated that she might be out of town or out of the country. Later that day, \nKelley saw Ms. Brietzke and the other female student walking in town. Kelley removed Ms. \nBrietzke from a large project she was working on and refused to attend meetings with her. In an \nemail to everyone working in his lab, Kelley wrote that the other female graduate student was \nconsidering other lab options and noted that “crafting cover-up stories to suggest that she is out of \n35 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 36 of 85\nthe country is unnecessary … indeed … it’s kind of dumb given the size of Hanover and how often \nwe all see each other in town.”  \n  Ms. Brietzke attended the meeting between Chair Bucci, Director Wheatley, the \nTitle IX Coordinator, and all graduate students in the Department that was called days after \nDartmouth received the September 12, 2018, letter from Plaintiffs’ counsel detailing Plaintiffs’ \nclaims and the basis for Dartmouth’s liability under Title IX and other statutes. After this attempt \nto disparage the victims and discourage them from pursuing legal action, Ms. Brietzke felt as \nthough she was no longer safe nor welcome at Dartmouth.  \n  Ms.  Brietzke  came  to  Dartmouth  to  gain  experience  and  learn  new  research \nmethods in the Department, which was known for its prestigious and rigorous graduate program. \nInstead, she was discouraged from contacting professors to learn new research methods and found \nthat the Department’s professors had no interest in teaching her. The sexually hostile atmosphere \nand pressure to engage with the professors socially was apparent from Ms. Brietzke’s very first \nday in the Department, and over the course of her first year at Dartmouth, she came to feel that \nwomen  in the Department, including herself, were objectified and expected to  compromise \nthemselves to succeed. These behaviors escalated when Heatherton sexually harassed and groped \nMs. Brietzke at a conference.  \n  Combined, the toxic sexual environment, harassment, and abuse she experienced \ntook a toll on Ms. Brietzke. Ms. Brietzke became depressed, socially withdrawn, and anxious. Ms. \nBrietzke felt unsafe working in the lab with Heatherton, whom she was forced to see on a regular \nbasis. As a result, her academic work suffered. Ms. Brietzke began to withdraw from friends and \nisolate herself. She began regularly seeing a therapist for the first time because of her experiences. \n36 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 37 of 85\nThe harassment she experienced impacted every facet of her life—from her personal relationships \nto her academic success.  \nD.  Annemarie Brown’s Factual Allegations \n  Ms. Brown worked as a graduate student in Whalen’s lab from 2010 to 2015, and \nsuccessfully defended her Ph.D. in January 2016. She was hired by Dartmouth as an adjunct \nprofessor in September 2017. \n  During her first year working as Whalen’s graduate student, Whalen trumpeted the \nclaim that Dartmouth protects its male professors by discrediting women who dare to bring sexual \nharassment  claims  against  them.  Whalen  announced  to  his  students  that  a  woman  in  the \nDepartment had previously complained about sexual harassment and that it had “backfired,” \ncausing the complainant to “lose resources” and lose steam in her career. Whalen warned his \nfemale graduate students that the complainant “got what was coming to her, of course; you don’t \nbite the hand that feeds you.” \n  Ms. Brown observed that Whalen, Heatherton, and Kelley all rewarded young, \nattractive women who went to social gatherings and drank heavily with their advisors with \nadditional  academic  attention  and  advancement  opportunities.  This  “socializing”  was  often \nprioritized over students’ academic pursuits. For example, Whalen’s students, including Ms. \nBrown, traveled to London to attend an International Society for Affective Disorders conference. \nUnbeknownst to the student participants, Whalen arranged a “drinking tour” with himself and his \nstudents that lasted the duration of the conference. Indeed, Ms. Brown and her female classmates \nvisited the conference only briefly to pick up their name tags. \n  Whalen openly rewarded graduate students who drank and socialized with him over \nthose who declined to do so. He pressured Ms. Brown and his other students to attend what he \n37 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 38 of 85\ncalled “mandatory fun” events, such as pajama parties and “boozy lunches” in the middle of the \nworkday. When Ms. Brown refused to attend these events, Whalen called her a “goody two shoes” \nand a “7-year-old girl.” He then began ignoring Ms. Brown academically and subjecting her to \nundue criticism. \n  Whalen  and  Kelley  cultivated  a  hostile  environment  in  which  professional \nboundaries were virtually nonexistent. For example, after learning that Ms. Brown had just \ninterviewed for a position at Harvard, Whalen, and Kelley pressured her to take a picture with their \narms around her and texted it to her potential Harvard supervisor with the caption “wish you were \nhere.” Days later, Harvard rejected Ms. Brown.  \n  Whalen once instructed his graduate students to design a series of experiments \nrelated to alcohol consumption. Women were required to take pregnancy tests prior to participating \nin these experiments. Whalen walked down the hall singing, “Who wants a pregnancy test!?” \n  Whalen sexually harassed and inappropriately touched Ms. Brown on numerous \noccasions throughout her tenure in his lab. \n  Shortly after Ms. Brown  joined the lab, Whalen  laid down on the  floor and \ndemanded that she “walk on his back,” an activity he said his previous female graduate students \ndid for him “all the time.”   \n  When Ms. Brown was leaving a Super Bowl party at Whalen’s house, he squeezed \nher buttocks and winked at her while hugging her goodbye. His wife was standing right beside \nthem. \n  When Ms. Brown failed to respond to Whalen’s sexual advances, he retaliated by \nsubjecting her to unwarranted criticism and cancelling academic meetings. \n38 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 39 of 85\n  As a result, Ms. Brown became fearful that she would be expelled from the \nprogram. She eventually voiced these concerns to Whalen. Whalen reminded her of his near total \ncontrol of her, telling her, “I’ll never let you go.” \n  Whalen then delayed Ms. Brown’s academic progress by rescheduling her first \nqualifying exam. The weekend before her exam was scheduled, Whalen organized a trip to his \nVermont property. After drinking the entire weekend, Whalen ignored Ms. Brown’s attempts to \ncontact him for the first two days of the week-long exam schedule before finally telling her that he \nneeded to delay her exam because he was recovering from the weekend. \n  Whalen  also escalated his inappropriate sexual comments to Ms. Brown. For \nexample, he regularly commented on Ms. Brown’s physical appearance, telling her that she was \nan “8.5 out of 10” and warning her to “act accordingly” and “watch out” because she “should know \nshe is pretty.” At another time, Whalen, while openly staring at Ms. Brown’s chest, advised her \nthat it was important that she put a lot of sunscreen on her chest area. \n  Ms. Brown felt that her success at Dartmouth required Whalen’s “protection,” \nwhich he would only provide if she succumbed to his flirtations and sexual advances. \n  While in a taxi at a professional conference, Whalen publicly shouted to Ms. Brown \nthat she should “just screw” the lab mate he assumed she had feelings for. Whalen made this \ncomment in the presence of many of Ms. Brown’s fellow graduate students as well as professional \ncolleagues  in the  same academic  field with the potential to help Ms. Brown secure  future \nemployment. \n  Another time, Whalen instructed Ms. Brown to retrieve something from his desk in \nthe lab on Dartmouth premises in a drawer he knew contained Playboy magazines.  \n39 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 40 of 85\n  Ms. Brown was also present for several instances in which Whalen behaved in a \nsexually suggestive and inappropriate manner toward other women. For example, while at a lunch, \nWhalen remarked that he could see a waitress’s panty lines and told Ms. Brown that it was “never \ngood to see panty lines.” Whalen also regularly gave Ms. Brown and other female graduate \nstudents “bear hugs” while inebriated. \n  Kelley contributed to this hostile environment by spreading false rumors that Ms. \nBrown and Whalen were in a sexual relationship. \n  While with Ms. Brown and other female graduate students, Kelley frequently \ndiscussed the “Papi scale,” rating women according to whether he would want to “bang” them. \n  Whalen then rescheduled Ms. Brown’s second qualifying exam for nearly a full \nyear. This extreme delay forced Ms. Brown to go on academic probation, which Whalen told her \nwas a “character building exercise.” When Ms. Brown was finally scheduled to take this exam \nnearly a year later, Whalen again rescheduled it, further delaying her academic progress. \n  Ms. Brown immediately contacted now-Chair David Bucci to request a secondary \nadvisor after learning her qualifying exam had been further rescheduled. Chair Bucci told Ms. \nBrown that a secondary advisor was not an option. Even though Ms. Brown explicitly asked Bucci \nto keep her request confidential and refrain from telling Whalen, Bucci informed Whalen that Ms. \nBrown had requested a secondary advisor.  \n  Thereafter, Whalen retaliated against Ms. Brown for rejecting his sexual advances \nand seeking a secondary advisor. He promptly removed Ms. Brown from Dartmouth’s centralized \nfunding and placed her on his individual grant, which allowed him to exercise complete control \nover her work. Over time, Whalen increasingly denied Ms. Brown access to resources vital to her \nwork and academic success at Dartmouth. During this time, Whalen also abruptly cancelled \n40 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 41 of 85\nmeetings with Ms. Brown. After one such cancelled meeting, Whalen told her, “I’m sorry, but I \nhad to get laid. You understand, don’t you?” Finally, Whalen then rescheduled Ms. Brown’s \ndissertation defense on two separate occasions, delaying her academic progress by months more. \n  Ms. Brown was hired as an adjunct professor in September 2017. When she was \nhired, Bucci told her that Dartmouth would continue to employ her as an adjunct if everything \nwent well. \n  In approximately October 2017, Ms. Brown contacted the Title IX investigator to \nprovide information regarding Whalen’s sexual misconduct against her and other students. \n  In April 2018, Dartmouth released the teaching schedule for the following year. \nDespite receiving outstanding student evaluations, Ms. Brown was scheduled to teach no courses. \nOn April 9, 2018, Ms. Brown contacted Chair Bucci and requested a meeting to discuss her \nteaching schedule for the following semester. Chair Bucci told Ms. Brown that he had nothing to \nsay and refused to meet with her, claiming that they could not discuss her employment until the \ninvestigation had concluded.  \n  Chair Bucci did, however, give teaching assignments to a male adjunct with similar \ncredentials to Ms. Brown’s. Both Ms. Brown and this individual were graduate students working \nin the Department and were subsequently hired as adjunct professors during approximately the \nsame period. The only difference between Ms. Brown and the male teacher, aside from gender, is \nthat the male did not participate in the Title IX investigation. \n  Dartmouth also denied Ms. Brown access to free counseling resources provided to \nher as an employee benefit. In December 2017, Ms. Brown contacted Dartmouth’s employee \nassistance program and scheduled an introductory session (during which she was to provide an \noverview of the issues she wished to discuss) and a follow-up appointment for the following week. \n41 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 42 of 85\nDuring Ms. Brown’s introductory session, she explained that she wanted to discuss the Title IX \ninvestigation and its impact on her. The Dartmouth counselor cancelled Ms. Brown’s follow-up \nappointment just days in advance and did not respond to Ms. Brown’s efforts to reschedule. \n  When Ms. Brown received a copy of the final investigative report from Dartmouth, \nshe was shocked to learn, for the very first time, that she was listed as a “Reporting Party” to the \ncomplaint against Whalen. Neither Dartmouth nor Investigator Davis asked Ms. Brown for \npermission to list her as a Reporting Party or informed her that they intended to do so. Ms. Brown \nwas unaware that Whalen would have the opportunity to review and dispute her specific report. \nMs. Brown suffered from a panic attack when she unexpectedly received the report listing her as \na Reporting Party along with Whalen’s rebuttal to her story. \n  After a promising undergraduate career, Ms. Brown was pursued by prestigious \nschools such as Harvard. She ultimately chose Dartmouth because of its reputation and well-\nrespected professors in her desired field of science. Ms. Brown came to Dartmouth full of potential, \nwork ethic, and energy, but left Dartmouth demoralized with a shattered academic record and \ndiagnosed with anxiety, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and stress-induced onset of autoimmune \ndisease. Ms. Brown matriculated at Dartmouth with the expectation that her work would be \nexamined and scrutinized by a team of well-known researchers whom she looked forward to \nengaging with at each step. Instead, she was thrust into an environment in which these esteemed \nresearchers were prone to flagrant sexual misconduct and cared little about her research or helping \nher improve her work. This environment quickly took its toll on Ms. Brown, who came from a \nsheltered background and was just 21 years old when she came to Dartmouth. Ms. Brown became \nand remains socially withdrawn, hopeless about her future, and severely disadvantaged in a \ncompetitive field. \n42 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 43 of 85\nE.  Andrea Courtney’s Factual Allegations \n  Ms. Courtney enrolled at Dartmouth in 2012 and worked in Kelley’s lab as a \ndoctoral student. While at Dartmouth, Ms. Courtney won multiple awards and travel grants. She \nauthored and published numerous papers and gave poster presentations and talks at academic \nconferences.  \n  Kelley  regularly  initiated  inappropriate  and  sexual  conversations  with  Ms. \nCourtney concerning the sex lives and physical appearances of Ms. Courtney and other female \ngraduate students in the Department. \n  For example, Kelley questioned Ms. Courtney about her sex life with her partner, \nasking whether the sex “was good” and inquiring about the size of her partner’s penis. Kelley also \nopenly discussed the number of Ms. Courtney’s sexual partners and demanded to know whether \nMs. Courtney would have sex with male graduate students. When she started at Dartmouth, Kelley \ntook bets on how long Ms. Courtney’s and Ms. Rapuano’s long distance relationships with their \nboyfriends would last. \n  On one occasion, Kelley demanded that Ms. Courtney refrain from talking to men \nin bars because they “didn’t know that [Ms. Courtney was] the prettiest girl in here and [they don’t] \nhave a shot.” \n  Kelley regularly discussed the physical attributes of female graduate students and \nwomen. For example, Kelley openly remarked on various female graduate students’ breast sizes \nand commented that Ms. Courtney “wouldn’t need a boob job.” Kelley noted his preference for \n“boobs that have a natural, ski jump shape.” \n43 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 44 of 85\n  Ms. Courtney and Ms. Rapuano worked together in Kelley’s lab. Ms. Courtney \nobserved that Kelley had a manipulative and controlling relationship with Ms. Rapuano, who often \nseemed distressed and upset in the lab.  \n  Ms.  Courtney,  by  contrast,  was  utterly  neglected  academically  and  often \ncompletely ignored by Kelley in the lab. Kelley rarely expressed interest in Ms. Courtney’s work \nand often refused to answer her emails, took long periods of time to review her manuscripts, and \ndenied her academic opportunities.  \n  Whalen sexually harassed Ms. Courtney and repeatedly made unwelcome sexual \nadvances towards her. \n  Whalen once pulled Ms. Courtney away from a male lab mate, held her hand, and \nhugged her while saying, “you can’t do this to me. It makes me jealous when you touch other guys \nlike that.”   \n  On another occasion, Whalen grabbed Ms. Courtney’s face and told her, “you are \nthe prettiest girl in the room; you are the prettiest girl in any room you are in.” Another time, he \nfollowed her out of a bar, stating “in another life…” before taking her hand and walking with her \nfor a block. Whalen also told Ms. Courtney and other female graduate students that he loved them \non multiple occasions. Whalen also inquired about Ms. Courtney’s relationship and asked her if \nshe was happy with her partner. \n  Ms. Courtney observed that Whalen liked to surround himself with young and \nattractive women and selected his teaching assistants based on their physical appearance. Whalen \ndirected extra attention to the female students in his lab whom he deemed the most physically \nattractive. \n44 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 45 of 85\n  Ms. Courtney found the Department to be a toxic environment from the moment \nshe enrolled. Kelley and Whalen especially inhibited Ms. Courtney’s progress by prioritizing \ndrinking over acting as academic advisors, forcing her to dedicate most of her free time to \nsocializing with these professors to receive academic advising. \n  Kelley and Whalen regularly spoke about their alcohol-fueled exploits with other \nstudents, describing how those students got drunk, threw up, and made fools of themselves. \n  On one occasion, Ms. Courtney became extremely ill after Kelley and Whalen led \na drinking marathon that commenced at 3:00 p.m. on a week day. Whalen continuously bought \nMs. Courtney and the other graduate students pitchers of sangria, refilling Ms. Courtney’s glass \nwithout being asked. Ms. Courtney announced at one point that she needed to stop drinking. Ms. \nCourtney later learned that Whalen continued to refill her glass even after she expressed that she \nneeded to stop. Ms. Courtney was brought back to the lab and fell asleep in one of the rooms.  \n  Ms. Courtney was later told that Whalen attempted to enter the room to “take care \nof her,” but was thwarted by a male lab mate watching over her who angrily forced Whalen to \nleave. \n  At a conference in San Diego, Whalen accompanied Ms. Courtney and two other \nfemale graduate students to a mall and attempted to help Ms. Courtney find a dress to wear at \ndinner, bringing various dresses to the dressing room for her to try on. \n  Whalen,  Kelley,  and  Heatherton  regularly  made  demeaning  and  sexualized \ncomments about Ms. Courtney or other women in her presence. For example, Kelley once \nremarked that all the graduate students were thin now and said that they “didn’t have anyone who \nwas fat.” After interviewing graduate students to work in the lab, Heatherton remarked that one \ninterviewee “was a jap (Jewish American Princess) and needed to eat a hamburger.” \n45 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 46 of 85\n  Kelley repeatedly told the story of a “joke” he’d played on Whalen in the past in \nwhich Kelley told a young female student working in Whalen’s lab that Whalen had a “botched \npenis circumcision” that left him with a “halfie cap.” Kelley bragged that he told Whalen about \nthis joke immediately, remarking that it was “brilliant” because Whalen was left with the option \nof either allowing his student to believe he had a “botched” circumcision or correcting her \nhimself—which he did. \n  Kelley  also  initiated  sexualized  conversations  about  male  students  in  the \nDepartment in the presence of Ms. Courtney and other women. He publicly humiliated a religious \nmale graduate student for being a virgin and asked Ms. Courtney and other graduate students to \nbet on “how long [the male graduate student] would last” on his wedding night. Kelley also \nremarked that another male working in his lab had “a big penis.” \n  On April 4, 2017, and April 7, 2017, Ms. Courtney joined Ms. Rapuano and several \nother  graduate  students  in  complaining  of  sexual  harassment,  sexual  assault,  inappropriate \nconduct, and retaliation by Kelley, Whalen, and Heatherton to Chair Bucci, Director Wheatley, \nand Dartmouth’s Title IX office.  \n  Following  these  complaints,  Dartmouth  encouraged  the  victims  to  continue \nworking with or among their harassers for several months. Dartmouth warned the victims that, if \nthey did not continue working with their harassers, there was a strong possibility that Heatherton, \nKelley, and Whalen would revoke their support and disparage the victims to the Department, \nwhich could result in the victims being placed on probation or asked to leave the program. Ms. \nCourtney thus continued to work in Kelley’s lab, forced to tolerate his abusive and manipulative \nbehavior, for nearly four months. \n46 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 47 of 85\n  Ms. Courtney chose to attend Dartmouth with the expectation that she would be \ntrained by experts in the field to publish papers and conduct cutting-edge science using resources \npromised to graduate students. However, she soon learned that these professors prioritized a highly \nsexualized drinking culture over academic advising. Ms. Courtney was dissuaded from using the \nvery resources that brought her to Dartmouth in the first place and struggled to receive advising \nand feedback on her work. Because Heatherton, Kelley, and Whalen controlled most of Ms. \nCourtney’s resources, she felt forced to participate in their predatory “boys’ club” as a means to \nsucceed in the Department. The power these professors wielded over Ms. Courtney eventually \nmade her believe that her own worth as a scientist was directly dependent on their support. Faced \nwith unrelenting sexual harassment and academic neglect, Ms. Courtney’s academic advancement \nand productivity suffered greatly and limited her career prospects. She began to lose passion for \npursuing a career in the field, which she came to believe nurtured this predatory “boys’ club” \nculture. Because of Ms. Courtney’s experiences at Dartmouth, she began to question her religious \nfaith and developed anxiety and depression. \nF.  Marissa Evans’s Factual Allegations \n  Ms. Evans was an undergraduate student at Dartmouth from 2014 until 2018. She \nmajored in neuroscience and worked in Kelley’s lab from fall 2015 to spring 2017. Ms. Evans \nbegan a post-baccalaureate premedical program at the University of Southern California in the fall \nof 2018. \n  In the fall of 2015, when Ms. Evans was a sophomore, a male student broke into \nher dorm room and raped her. Ms. Evans reported the assault to Dartmouth College Health Service \ncounselor Dr. Bryant Ford on November 10, 2015. When Ms. Evans relayed the assault, Dr. Ford \nreplied, “Was it a dream?” Then, at Ms. Evans’s direction, Dr. Ford reported the sexual assault to \n47 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 48 of 85\nDartmouth’s Title IX coordinator and campus safety on her behalf on approximately November \n19, 2015. \n  Dartmouth’s response to Ms. Evans’s sexual assault report violates Title IX and \nnumerous other state and federal laws. First, Dartmouth failed to inform Ms. Evans of her right to \nobtain a no-cost Jane Doe forensic examination at the nearest qualified facility, to which law \nenforcement is legally required to transport her. Moreover, Dartmouth falsely informed Ms. Evans \nthat she would not be permitted to proceed anonymously to pursue a Title IX complaint. In \naddition, Dartmouth engaged in no investigation concerning the reported rape, refusing even to \ncheck the entry logs to see which students had entered her dorm during the relevant hours on the \nnight of her assault. Although Ms. Evans provided the approximate height, hair length and color, \nand build of the person who raped her, she is unaware of any steps that were taken to investigate \nher assault or identify the rapist. Thus, Dartmouth violated Title IX at least by: failing to prevent \nthe sexual assault; failing to have a workable process for reporting sexual assault; impeding a \ncriminal investigation by failing to take necessary steps to preserve evidence; failing to conduct \nany investigation of the rape; failing to offer the victim any accommodations; and failing to take \nany measures to prevent against retaliation. \n  Kelley sexually harassed Ms. Evans throughout her tenure in his lab. From the \noutset, Kelley eschewed professional and personal boundaries. During the summer of 2015, Ms. \nEvans interviewed for a position in Kelley’s lab. Although she was just 19 years old, Kelley \ninsisted that her formal job interview take place at a bar. There, Kelley plied her with several \nglasses of wine before taking her bar-hopping and buying her whiskey, commenting several times \nthat Ms. Evans was underage and could not legally drink. \n48 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 49 of 85\n  Kelley’s conduct escalated in the summer of 2016. For example, Kelley began \nsending Ms. Evans Snapchats of himself drinking and commenting on his level of intoxication. \nOver the 2016-2017 academic year, these messages escalated to inappropriate compliments, such \nas telling Ms. Evans that “a guy like me could never be with a girl like you” and calling her \n“beautiful” and “sexy.” In December 2016, Kelley arrived, uninvited, at one of Ms. Evans’s track \nmeets while intoxicated. \n  Ms. Evans did not submit to Kelley’s sexual advances or convey any romantic or \nsexual interest in him, often responding to his comments by saying, “no, you don’t mean that.” \nMs. Evans became anxious over Kelley’s level of interest in her and feared that rejecting him \nwould hurt her academically. Kelley warned Ms. Evans that his letter of recommendation would \nbe “crucial” for her future and once told her that, as a “favor,” he was giving her a better grade in \nhis course than she deserved. \n  Kelley repeatedly threatened to harm Ms. Evans academically after she refused to \nengage in his sexual banter. Each time, Kelley responded by telling Ms. Evans, “Someone’s honors \nthesis just got harder.” Ms. Evans responded by telling Kelley not to bring her honors thesis into \nthe conversation. \n  In December 2016, Ms. Evans returned home due to a close childhood friend’s \ndeath. Kelley sought to exploit Ms. Evans’s vulnerable state—of which he was well-aware—by \ndramatically escalating his unwelcome sexual advances towards her. \n  Kelley began to send Ms. Evans sexually explicit images that were both unwelcome \nand unsolicited. These images displayed, among other things: \n•  Kelley’s fully naked body, including his erect penis; \n•  Kelley’s genitalia with sex toys, including a penis “cage” and a penis “hat”; and \n•  Kelley engaged in sexual encounters with two unidentified persons. \n49 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 50 of 85\n \n  Kelley barraged Ms. Evans with unwelcome and offensive text messages of a \nsexual nature, including: \n•  Describing his personal use of sex toys, his past sexual encounters, and his sexual \npreferences in terms of dominant/submissive roles;  \n•  Asking Ms. Evans to describe her sexual practices and fantasies; \n•  Instructing Ms. Evans on how to perform oral sex on a woman; \n•  Seeking to assert sexual dominance by commanding Ms. Evans to masturbate \nand—likening her to a pet—calling her “good girl”; and \n•  Expressing his intention to have sexual intercourse with her when she returned to \nDartmouth in January 2017. \n \n  After receiving more than 10 explicit sexual photographs, Ms. Evans blocked \nKelley’s number so that he could not contact her. \n  Ms. Evans returned to Dartmouth in January 2017, after the holidays. Because \nKelley had told her he intended to have sexual intercourse with her upon her return, Ms. Evans \nwas terrified that he was going to force her to have sex with him. \n  As a result, Ms. Evans attempted to limit her interaction with Kelley and tried to \nwork directly with his senior graduate student, Ms. Rapuano, rather than working with Kelley \ndirectly. \n  Kelley eventually emailed Ms. Evans and demanded to know why she was not \nresponding to his text messages. Afraid to tell Kelley that she had blocked him, she instead said \nthat her phone was broken. In response, Kelley took it upon himself to make Ms. Evans an \nappointment at the Verizon store. Fearing retaliation if Kelley learned the truth, Ms. Evans went \nto the Verizon store and paid for a phone upgrade that she did not need. \n  To escape Kelley’s sexual harassment, Ms. Evans transferred to a different lab in \nthe spring of 2017. \n50 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 51 of 85\n  After switching labs, Ms. Evans was at a local restaurant with a group of Dartmouth \nstudents when Kelley arrived to join the group. Ms. Evans switched to a different table so that she \nwould not be seated near him. Kelley continued to stare at her throughout the night and said her \nname loudly as if to draw her attention to him.  \n  Kelley’s conduct robbed Ms. Evans of her undergraduate educational experience \nand caused her to suffer severe emotional distress and disruptions to every area of her life. \n  Dartmouth  retaliated  against  Ms.  Evans  for  participating  in  the  Title  IX \ninvestigation. \n  On May 23, 2018, Ms. Evans easily passed the oral defense of her honors thesis. \nProfessors Bob Maue and Alan Green, the faculty judges, unanimously recommended that she pass \nwith honors. \n  However, Professor Maue then, without explanation, refused to provide Ms. Evans \nwith his signature as required for Ms. Evans to turn in her honors thesis. Ms. Evans sent Professor \nMaue numerous emails requesting his signature. He did not respond. \n  These circumstances delayed Ms. Evans’s submission of her honors thesis, forcing \nher to file it one day past its due date. Purportedly because of this “lateness,” Ms. Evans received \na failing grade on her thesis.  \n  Ms. Evans met with Chair Bucci, Assistant Dean of Undergraduate Students Anne \nHudak, and Professors Jeffrey Taube and Catherine Cramer to explain the circumstances and \nrequest that Dartmouth reverse its decision to fail her. They refused and, instead, presented Ms. \nEvans with an untenable ultimatum: either accept an A- in an independent study without an honors \nthesis or receive her honors thesis but with a C grade for two semesters (which would drop her \nGPA below the threshold for medical school, the next professional step in her career). \n51 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 52 of 85\n  Ms. Evans appealed this decision to President Hanlon. In her appeal, she voiced \nconcern about possible retaliation for her involvement in the Title IX investigation against Kelley, \nwriting: “I personally feel as though this decision is rooted in retaliation, as I am the only \nundergraduate student who was directly involved in the investigation of the three neuroscience \nprofessors this past year.” A petition was started on Ms. Evans’s behalf requesting that Dartmouth \nreverse its decision, accumulating approximately 200 signatures. \n  Still Dartmouth refused to reverse its decision. Ms. Evans was ultimately permitted \nto accept grades of B+ and A- for two semesters. \n  Ms. Evans is the only undergraduate student who participated in the Title IX \ninvestigation. She is also the only undergraduate student whose honors thesis Dartmouth failed. \n  Ms. Evans was a top-ranked high school graduate when she was recruited by \nDartmouth to join its track and field team. Kelley took an immediate interest in her when she \nenrolled in several of his undergraduate courses. Ms. Evans, who was just 18 years old at the time, \nconstrued Kelley’s interest as recognition of academic potential in her, and subsequently applied \nto work in his lab with the expectation that he would assist in building her career and shaping her \nhonors thesis. Kelley’s harassment of Ms. Evans caused her to question her own intellect and \nacademic  capabilities,  doubts  which  permeated  every  aspect  of  her  academic  and  social \nrelationships. She became terrified that Kelley would force her to have sexual intercourse with him \n(after he stated his intention to do so) and was driven to severe depressive episodes and a suicide \nattempt. Ms. Evans’s experiences at Dartmouth have had a lasting effect on her professional career \nand mental health. Ms. Evans will only work in research labs run by women because of her deep \ndistrust of male employers. She was forced to withdraw from her first semester in a post-\n52 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 53 of 85\nbaccalaureate  premedical  program  due  to  mental  health  reasons  resulting  from  her  time  at \nDartmouth. \nG.  Jane Doe’s Factual Allegations \n  Jane Doe received a master’s degree in experimental psychology and obtained a \nBachelor of Liberal Arts degree from a top college. Prior to matriculating at Dartmouth as a \ndoctoral student, she worked in a prestigious neuroimaging lab. \n  While at Dartmouth, Jane Doe received numerous external funding and conference \nawards,  co-authored  multiple  papers,  and  gave  talks  and  poster  presentations  at  academic \nconferences across the country. \n  Jane Doe worked in Whalen’s lab during the 2016-2017 academic year. Whalen \nsexually harassed Jane Doe and subjected her to a hostile environment during her entire tenure in \nhis lab. \n  Jane Doe and other female graduate students in Whalen’s lab felt pressured to \nsubmit to his constant and inappropriate flirtation and dress in a manner he felt was “sexy” to get \nany of Whalen’s academic attention or support. Emblematically, Whalen once told Jane Doe that \nhe had been described as a “benevolent sexist,” which he told her he took as a compliment. \n  Whalen made numerous unwelcome sexual advances toward Jane Doe, such as \nputting his arm around Jane Doe’s waist and invading her personal space by, despite her obvious \ndiscomfort, putting his face just inches away from her face to speak to her. Additionally, Whalen \nonce observed his ex-girlfriend at a bar, sat down next to Jane Doe, and instructed her that they \nwere going to “make [his ex-girlfriend] jealous by making her think we are on a date.” \n  Whalen also made inappropriate comments about Jane Doe’s physical appearance. \nFor  example,  before  attending  a  dinner  at  an  academic  conference,  Whalen  expressed \n53 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 54 of 85\ndisappointment in Jane Doe’s physical appearance and implied that he did not find her attractive \nin the outfit she was wearing by remarking that he had hoped she would “dress up.”  \n  While with Jane Doe and her female colleagues, Whalen and Kelley regularly rated \nthe “hotness” of female students in the Department, remarking on their physical attractiveness and \ntheir clothing choices.  \n  Within months of starting at Dartmouth, Jane Doe noticed that students were \nexpected to drink and socialize with the Department’s professors to build key relationships and \nreceive academic attention. Meetings often took place at bars and often involved heavy drinking. \nOn the occasions when Jane Doe declined to attend these “meetings,” Whalen would disappear \nand ignore Jane Doe’s emails, leaving her with no advisory support. \n  Jane Doe realized that participating in this drinking culture was a prerequisite to \ngetting the advising, guidance, and academic support she needed from Whalen to complete her \nstudies at Dartmouth. \n  Whalen  prioritized  female  students  who  indulged  his  flirtations  and  sexual \nadvances and neglected those who did not. Most tellingly, Whalen lavished advising, academic \nattention and opportunities upon a female student in his lab with whom he was widely known to \nbe having a sexual relationship. By contrast, Whalen completely ignored and “froze out” Jane Doe, \nwho refused his sexual advances. \n  This  dynamic  impeded  Jane  Doe’s  academic  progress  at  Dartmouth.  While \nattempting to complete her work in the lab, Jane Doe felt pressured to leave Whalen and the \ngraduate student with whom he was having a sexual relationship alone. When they were in the lab \ntogether, Whalen often spoke only to the female graduate student with whom he was in a \nrelationship, ignoring Jane Doe.  \n54 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 55 of 85\n  After Jane Doe participated in the Title IX process and investigation, Dartmouth \nretaliated against her by denying her reasonable accommodations, unilaterally transferring her into \na new lab that was inconsistent with her background and academic field of science, and ultimately \nexpelling her from the program after the school had set her up to fail. \n  After subjecting Jane Doe to a highly sexualized and hostile lab environment \nperpetuated by its tenured professors for years, Dartmouth forced Jane Doe to a different lab that \nwas  incompatible  with  her  background  and  field  of  science.  Dartmouth’s  actions  made  it \nimpossible for Jane Doe to realize the benefits of her education as a student at Dartmouth. \n  In mid-July 2017, Jane Doe was abruptly informed that Whalen had been placed on \nadministrative leave and, effective immediately, she would be reassigned to a different professor’s \nlab that was inconsistent with her background and field of science. Dartmouth did not give Jane \nDoe the opportunity to object to her placement or seek a more suitable lab. \n  The next day, Jane Doe told Dartmouth that the new lab to which she had been \nassigned was incompatible with her academic background and interests.  \n  Immediately thereafter, Jane Doe became involved in the Title IX investigation. \n  Jane Doe continued to raise concerns with Dartmouth that her new lab was a poor \nfit. She discussed this with the new professor to whom she was assigned, who agreed that she \nwould be better suited in a different lab. Indeed, during a presentation of Jane Doe’s work on \nDecember 11, 2017, the professor to whom she was assigned made derogatory comments about \nthe type of science Jane Doe was studying and stated that he “regretted” taking over the grant for \nWhalen and that “the government should never fund this kind of science again.” \n  Thereafter, Jane Doe met with a different professor whose lab was more aligned \nwith her background and field of science. This professor offered to take Jane Doe into his lab, \n55 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 56 of 85\npromising to communicate his offer to Dartmouth and advocate for the transfer during the annual \nfaculty meeting. With this professor’s support, Jane Doe initiated plans to transfer into his lab. \n  Director Wheatley and Chair Bucci initially seemed agreeable, but ultimately \nrefused to let Jane Doe switch labs.  \n  In June 2018, Dartmouth expelled Jane Doe from the program, without notice or a \nprobationary period. \n  Within 48 hours, Jane Doe met with both Chair Bucci and Director Wheatley \nseparately to discuss her expulsion.  \n  Chair Bucci advised Jane Doe not to appeal her evaluations, warning her that “this \nis a small field and you don’t want bad blood.” In this same meeting, Jane Doe told Chair Bucci \nthat the culture and harassment perpetuated by the Department’s professors and the poor fit with \nthe lab she had been assigned had left her without a safe scientific home to complete her work. \nChair Bucci trivialized Jane Doe’s experiences of harassment and displacement by comparing \nthem with a time when he was inundated with administrative work, stating “I had a hellish year, \ntoo, but was able to do my work.”  \n  Director Wheatley claimed that she  “had  no choice”  but to expel  Jane Doe. \nReferencing an upcoming required presentation, Director Wheatley demanded to know: “What \nwould you even present on if you were to stay?” This presentation was not scheduled to take place \nfor nearly one year, and Jane Doe already had projects underway—including three completed \ndatasets,  one  of  which  she  won  an  award  for—that  she  intended  to  present.  Nonetheless, \nDartmouth stood by its decision to expel her. \n  Upon information and belief, Dartmouth violated its own policies in expelling Jane \nDoe. \n56 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 57 of 85\n  Jane Doe chose to attend Dartmouth specifically to work with Whalen, whose \nresearch she had followed for many years. She came to Dartmouth with the expectation that \nWhalen, whose work heavily informed her interests and goals, would provide her with the \nbackground and knowledge necessary to launch a career in the field of social neuroscience. Instead, \nJane Doe found herself in a place in which a highly sexualized environment was normalized and \nwomen, including herself, were systematically gaslighted. The pressure to drink and stay out late \nto receive mentorship served as a devastating trigger to Jane Doe, who had previously suffered \nfrom depression and had experienced trauma earlier in her life. Because of her experiences at \nDartmouth, she lost her motivation, excitement, and passion for her work and became extremely \nwithdrawn, cutting off communication with her family and closest friends. \nH.  Jane Doe 2’s Factual Allegations \n  Jane Doe 2 was an undergraduate student at Dartmouth from 2008 until 2012. She \nworked as an undergraduate research assistant in Heatherton’s lab for the majority of the Summer \n2010 through Spring 2012 terms. Heatherton and Whalen served as her honors thesis advisors from \nfall 2011 through spring 2012, and Whalen served as her neuroscience minor advisor. After \ngraduating, Jane Doe 2 worked as a Research Assistant in Heatherton’s lab from fall 2012 through \nspring 2013.  \n  Jane Doe 2 took a class with Whalen during her sophomore year of college in 2009. \nAs the class progressed, Whalen began to act flirtatiously towards Jane Doe 2. After Jane Doe 2 \ndecided to pursue a major in psychology and a minor in neuroscience, she approached Whalen \nabout doing research in the Department. In response, Whalen presented her with three possible \noptions:  she  could  work  with  him,  Heatherton,  or  Kelley.  Jane  Doe  2  began  working  in \nHeatherton’s lab as an undergraduate research assistant in the summer of 2010. \n57 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 58 of 85\n  As an undergraduate student, Jane Doe 2 experienced and observed an extreme \namount of pressure to participate in the Department’s drinking culture. Jane Doe 2 was frequently \nserved alcohol during lab functions both on and off Dartmouth premises. On Fridays, Heatherton \nand Kelley occasionally hosted a meeting dubbed “Bill and Todd’s Excellent Adventures” that \ninevitably revolved around drinking rather than research. \n  Kelley and Whalen frequently made sexual comments about Jane Doe 2 and other \nwomen. Whalen discussed Jane Doe 2’s body in a sexual manner, while Kelley asked Jane Doe 2 \npersonal and invasive questions about her romantic relationship. Both professors discussed their \nown sexual preferences in Jane Doe 2’s presence. \n  In  the  Spring  2012  term,  Dartmouth  organized  a  celebratory  dinner  for  the \nundergraduate students who had completed their honors thesis that year. After the dinner, the \nstudents were escorted to a bar by the Department’s faculty members in attendance. While at the \nbar, the students were encouraged to drink heavily, with Whalen buying several rounds of drinks \nfor Jane Doe 2. Upon information and belief, the Department paid for these drinks. \n  Once at the bar, surrounded by Dartmouth faculty members and students, Whalen \nheld Jane Doe 2’s hand and kissed her cheek, telling her that he loved her. Whalen told Jane Doe \n2 that he had big plans for the two of them and would strive to make sure his and Heatherton’s lab \nwere integrated in the upcoming year. Jane Doe 2 was uncomfortable with Whalen’s behavior \nbecause they were in plain view of Dartmouth faculty members. \n  In November 2012, Whalen sexually assaulted Jane Doe 2 and had nonconsensual \nsex with her. After drinking at a bar, Whalen accompanied Jane Doe 2 and several graduate \nstudents to a movie, where he supplied them with containers of whiskey. When the movie was \nover, they went to a different bar. Whalen then offered to drive Jane Doe 2 home to the apartment \n58 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 59 of 85\nwhere she was staying. By then, Jane Doe 2 was intoxicated to the point of losing her memory. \nJane Doe 2 regained consciousness to find Whalen kissing her in front of her apartment. Mortified \nand uncomfortable, Jane Doe 2 stopped Whalen and told him that she needed to go inside her \napartment.  \n  Whalen insisted on following Jane Doe 2 inside, ignoring her when she instructed \nhim to leave. Once inside the apartment, Whalen initiated sexual activity with her. Jane Doe 2 \nasked Whalen to leave her house, telling him that she was going to be sick from alcohol. Whalen \ndid not leave her apartment, claiming that he needed to “help her get into bed” and undressing her. \nAt one point, Whalen told her: “Don’t worry, we’re not going to have sex.” Jane Doe 2 replied, \n“of course not—I can’t even walk.” \n  Whalen nonetheless forced himself on Jane Doe 2 and engaged in nonconsensual \nintercourse with her. In the following months after sexually assaulting Jane Doe 2, Whalen \nrepeatedly demanded to  know if she had told anyone and warned her that  he would  “lose \neverything” if she told anyone. \n  During the 2012-2013 academic year, Jane Doe 2 worked as a graduate Research \nAssistant in Heatherton’s lab. Throughout this time, Whalen continued to initiate sexual activity \nwith Jane Doe 2 on several different occasions, often in an aggressive manner that made Jane Doe \n2 feel unsafe.  \n  On one occasion in approximately April 2013, Whalen initiated sexual activity with \nJane Doe 2 in his office on Dartmouth premises and choked her to the point that she feared for her \nsafety. A Dartmouth security guard walked in soon after. \n  Beginning after she was first sexually assaulted by Whalen and continuing through \nthe end of her employment, Whalen periodically interrogated Jane Doe 2 and demanded to know \n59 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 60 of 85\nif she had told anyone about their sexual encounters, reminding her that, if she told anyone, it \nwould “destroy” his family, his career, and his life.  \n  While at a conference in San Francisco in approximately April 2013, Whalen \ngroped Jane Doe 2 under the table in front of Heatherton, for whom she worked, and Ms. Courtney. \nAfter dinner, Heatherton accompanied Jane Doe 2 and the graduate students to a bar. While \nwalking with Jane Doe 2 to the bar, Heatherton alluded to an inappropriate relationship between \nher and Whalen. Jane Doe 2 told Heatherton that she felt Whalen was dangerous and should not \nbe trusted nor allowed around young women. In response, Heatherton expressed feelings of \njealousy regarding Whalen’s behavior. Later, Heatherton approached Jane Doe 2 in the bar and \nimplied that he was struggling with his own feelings towards her and wasn’t sure whether they \nwere paternal or something more. Jane Doe 2 had confided in Heatherton hoping that he would \nprotect her from Whalen; instead, Heatherton expressed jealousy over Whalen’s conduct and made \nsexual advances of his own towards Jane Doe 2. \n  Whalen invited Jane Doe 2 to a baseball game during her final week working in the \nlab. Near or on Jane Doe 2’s last day of work, Whalen told her, “you’re not going to tell anybody, \nright? We’re good, right?”  Whalen then promised to write Jane Doe 2 a glowing recommendation \nletter. Jane Doe 2 felt, as she had before, that Whalen was attempting to coerce her into silence. \n  Jane Doe 2 continued to experience pressure to drink and socialize while working \nas a graduate Research Assistant in Heatherton’s lab, often to the detriment of her own professional \nadvancement. For example, in April 2013, Jane Doe 2 traveled to San Francisco to attend a \nconference with Heatherton, Whalen, and several graduate students. Heatherton and Whalen both \nleft the event early to go drink at bars. Whalen encouraged the graduate students to join them at \nthe  bar  rather than  attending  the  conference.  On  another occasion,  Jane  Doe  2  became  so \n60 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 61 of 85\nintoxicated at a lab meeting followed by a bar outing that she called her boyfriend to come pick \nher up. When her boyfriend arrived, Kelley told him that Jane Doe 2 just needed a bit of “cocaine \nand red bull” and she would be fine. \n  In October 2017, Jane Doe 2 was contacted by Investigator Davis and asked if she \nwould provide information. Investigator Davis initially promised Jane Doe 2 that everything \ndiscussed would remain strictly confidential. However, when Jane Doe 2 asked if she would still \nbe guaranteed confidentiality if she revealed illegal behavior by any of the accused professors, \nInvestigator Davis  backtracked and told  Jane Doe 2 that it was possible any  incriminating \ninformation she provided may not remain confidential.  \n  Jane Doe 2 was left with the impression that Investigator Davis initially believed \nthat she would defend Heatherton, Whalen, and Kelley against the allegations. When Jane Doe 2 \nmade it clear that she would not, the tone of the conversation changed—as did Investigator Davis’s \npromises of confidentiality.  \n  Investigator Davis told Jane Doe 2 that Heatherton, Whalen, and Kelley had all \nbeen instructed that they were not to contact anyone involved in the investigation. \n  An interview with Investigator Davis was scheduled to take place on October 25, \n2017, but Jane Doe 2 contacted Investigator Davis the day before the interview and asked to \npostpone due to scheduling conflicts. Jane Doe 2’s interview was rescheduled for the following \nweek. \n  On October 27, 2017, Heatherton emailed Jane Doe 2 and asked whether he had \nthe most accessible email address for her. Because Jane Doe 2 had been assured that Heatherton \nhad been instructed not to contact anyone involved in the investigation, she was very disturbed to \nreceive his email. Moreover, the suspicious timing of Heatherton’s email—which she received \n61 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 62 of 85\ndays after postponing her Title IX interview—made Jane Doe 2 question the confidentiality of the \nTitle IX process. As a result, Jane Doe 2 declined to move forward with a Title IX interview. \n  Not until the Complaint (Dkt. 1) was first filed on November 15, 2018, did Jane \nDoe 2 become aware of Dartmouth’s knowledge, deliberate indifference, and pervasive failure to \nrespond to repeated instances of sexual misconduct in the Department. When Jane Doe 2 read the \nComplaint and ensuing media coverage, she was shocked to learn that Dartmouth had known about \nthese professors’ inappropriate conduct for over a decade—well before Jane Doe 2 was sexually \nassaulted—but allowed their behavior to continue unabated as they worked with young female \nstudents. Prior to the filing of this lawsuit on November 15, 2018, Dartmouth actively concealed \nits own misconduct, and as a result, Jane Doe 2 was unaware, nor with reasonable diligence could \nhave been aware, of Dartmouth’s causal connection to the sexual assault, sexual harassment, \ndiscrimination, and hostile environment to which she was subjected.  \n  For over a decade, Dartmouth held Heatherton, Whalen, and Kelley out as esteemed \nprofessors  in good standing and  ignored credible reports of their serial sexual  misconduct. \nDartmouth then concealed the existence of the Title IX investigation and did not release any \ninformation publicly nor to students in the Department. While Dartmouth continued cloaking its \nmisconduct, Jane Doe 2 had no reason to suspect that Dartmouth knowingly and deliberately failed \nto prevent the sexual misconduct inflicted by the professors. Investigator Davis seemingly made \nno effort to address Dartmouth’s prior knowledge of the professors’ conduct or its role in fostering \nthe continuing harassment. Even after the investigation was leaked to the media, Dartmouth did \nnot  release  any  details  about  the  allegations.  Because  Dartmouth  actively  concealed  this \ninformation from the general public, Jane Doe 2 could not, with reasonable diligence, have learned \n62 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 63 of 85\nthis information independently. She discovered this information only when the initial Complaint \nwas filed on November 15, 2018. \n  Attending Dartmouth was Jane Doe 2’s dream. Dartmouth’s prestigious reputation \nrepresented a path to professional success and an escape from poverty for Jane Doe 2. Combined, \nthe  sexual  assault,  discrimination,  and  toxic  environment  Jane  Doe  2  was  subjected  to  at \nDartmouth had a lasting effect on her mental and physical health. Jane Doe 2 experienced extreme \ndepression and was consumed by suicidal thoughts, prompting her to seek counseling. She became \nsocially isolated and withdrawn, distancing herself from her friends and family, and experienced \nphysical symptoms such as insomnia, loss of appetite, nausea, amenorrhea, and hypervigilance. \nAlthough Jane Doe 2 planned to study neuroscience or clinical psychology, her experiences at \nDartmouth caused her to leave the field altogether. \nI.  Jane Doe 3’s Factual Allegations \n  Jane Doe 3 attended Dartmouth from 2003 until 2009 as a graduate student and \npost-doctoral fellow. She worked in Heatherton’s and Kelley’s labs. While at Dartmouth, Jane Doe \n3 was an active member of numerous graduate committees, served as a teaching assistant and was \noften invited to guest lecture in other courses, and won awards and scholarships for her academic \nand work performance. She has a strong publication record and has routinely given talks and \npresentations at academic conferences across the country. \n  When Jane Doe 3 enrolled at Dartmouth, she was initially working in another \nprofessor’s lab. Almost immediately, Kelley began to display an inappropriate interest in Jane Doe \n3, acting flirtatiously and initiating sexual conversations with her. Kelley then began encouraging \nJane Doe 3 to switch into his lab and work under him. \n63 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 64 of 85\n  In November 2003, Kelley encouraged Jane Doe 3 to attend a conference with him \nand several other graduate students in New Orleans. Kelley ultimately paid for Jane Doe 3’s travel \nexpenses to attend the conference, even though she was not a member of his lab. At the conference, \nKelley invited the graduate students, including Jane Doe 3, to several bars and nightclubs. He \ncontinuously bought drinks for Jane Doe 3 until she was intoxicated to the point of slipping in and \nout of consciousness. He then began asking Jane Doe 3 intrusive sexual questions in front of the \ngraduate students, such as demanding to know who she would rather have sex with between \nvarious Dartmouth students and faculty members, proposing himself as a sexual partner. Kelley \nthen separated Jane Doe 3 from the group and led her back to his hotel and initiated sexual activity \nwith her for the first time. \n  Jane Doe 3’s transfer to Kelley’s lab was finalized approximately two weeks later. \nAfter Jane Doe 3 began officially working in Kelley’s lab, he coerced her into an ongoing sexual \nrelationship with him.  \n  From the outset, Kelley made it clear that he regarded her as a sexual object rather \nthan a scientist. Kelley told her that she was “too pretty to be smart” and was only at Dartmouth \nbecause of her good looks. He confided that he found it gratifying that he was the one who “got to \nhave” her when other faculty members in the Department sexually desired her. He encouraged her \nto outwardly flirt with other faculty members as well as the IT Department to secure additional \nresources for his lab. After Kelley “pranked” the undergraduate students by telling them that \nWhalen had suffered a “botched penis circumcision,” he encouraged Jane Doe 3 to confirm the \ntruth of the story by falsely telling undergraduate students that she had been sexually involved with \nWhalen.  \n64 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 65 of 85\n  Other faculty in the Department similarly objectified Jane Doe 3. Kelley told Jane \nDoe 3 that Heatherton had been fixated on her physical appearance during her interview and hoped \nthat her shirt buttons might open. As a result of Heatherton sharing this story, male faculty \nmembers in the Department referred to Jane Doe 3 by a demeaning and sexual nickname. \n  Kelley often showed little interest in Jane Doe 3’s work, neglecting her research \nand delaying her qualifying examinations because he did not want to “draw attention” to their \nrelationship. Yet when Jane Doe 3 pointed out the detrimental effect his behavior had on her career \nand attempted to maintain a professional relationship, Kelley claimed that she was receiving \ncertain special privileges by virtue of their sexual relationship that she would no longer be given. \n  Kelley, Whalen, and Heatherton all made demeaning and sexual comments about \nwomen in their labs. Whalen and Kelley competed over who had the “hottest” lab. Kelley rated \nthe sexual desirability of women in the Department—including graduate students, undergraduate \nstudents, and faculty—in front of Jane Doe 3 and other lab members. Whalen told Jane Doe 3 that \nhe was very attracted to undergraduate students in his lab. Kelley suggested that female students \nwho attended his office hours were sexually interested in him and remarked that he loved teaching \nin a particular lecture hall because he could easily look up students’ skirts or dresses during class. \n  Jane Doe 3, like other women in the Department, felt that her professional success \nwas contingent on her willingness to drink and socialize with Kelley, Whalen, and Heatherton. \nThe three professors bought and refilled Jane Doe 3’s drinks, often against her wishes. Kelley \npublicly ridiculed female students who did not partake in this drinking culture. When Jane Doe 3 \nneeded Kelley to review a paper or discuss a research matter, he would often condition his \nassistance on her meeting him at a bar to drink. \n65 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 66 of 85\n  On many occasions, Jane Doe 3 attempted to end the sexual aspects of their \nrelationship, as she felt it was detrimental to her career and her advancement as a scientist. Each \ntime, Kelley retaliated by refusing to provide her with academic support and neglecting her \nprofessionally. When Jane Doe 3 was able to permanently end her sexual relationship with Kelley \nin the summer of 2007, he responded by threatening her professional career. Kelley told her: “Good \nluck getting your Ph.D. now.”  \n  In order to complete her dissertation work, Jane Doe 3 continued working in \nKelley’s lab for an additional year after ending their sexual relationship. She was then required to \ninteract with Kelley on a regular basis when she worked as a post-doctoral fellow in Heatherton’s \nlab. Over the course of these two years, Kelley continued to act flirtatiously and make sexual \nadvances towards her. When she rejected his advances, he reacted negatively and ignored her \nwork. In retaliation for ending their sexual relationship, Kelley also gave data that she had collected \nto another student. He removed Jane Doe 3 from an ongoing research project and continued to \ndeny her access to data and research projects after she left Dartmouth in 2009. \n  Around the early fall of 2017, Kelley called Jane Doe 3 to inform her of the Title \nIX investigation and warn her that she may be contacted to provide information. Kelley asked Jane \nDoe 3 to tell Dartmouth that they had a consensual relationship that did not begin until she \ngraduated and was no longer working in his lab. When Jane Doe 3 told Kelley that she would not \nlie, he said that it would be “best” if she refused to speak with anyone from Dartmouth about the \ninvestigation.  \n  In October 2017, Chair Bucci contacted Jane Doe 3 and informed her of the Title \nIX investigation. Chair Bucci explained that he wanted to speak with Jane Doe 3 directly before \n66 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 67 of 85\nshe was contacted by the investigator. Chair Bucci also acknowledged that he had always been \naware of “rumors” concerning Jane Doe 3’s relationship with Kelley. \n  Investigator Davis contacted Jane Doe 3 shortly thereafter and asked to speak via \nvideoconference. Jane Doe 3 ultimately declined to provide information, fearing retaliation by the \nthree powerful professors who still controlled certain aspects of her career. \n  Not until the Complaint (Dkt. 1) was first filed on November 15, 2018, did Jane \nDoe 3 become aware of Dartmouth’s knowledge, deliberate indifference, and pervasive failure to \nrespond to repeated instances of sexual misconduct in the Department. When Jane Doe 3 read the \nComplaint and ensuing media coverage, she was shocked to learn that Dartmouth had known about \nKelley’s inappropriate conduct towards her and yet took no action to protect her or curb Kelley’s \nbehavior. Jane Doe 3 was likewise shocked to learn that Dartmouth had known about all three \nprofessors’  inappropriate conduct for over a decade but allowed their  behavior to continue \nunabated as they worked with young female students. Prior to the filing of this lawsuit on \nNovember 15, 2018, Dartmouth actively concealed its own misconduct, and as a result, Jane Doe \n3 was unaware, nor with reasonable diligence could have been aware, of Dartmouth’s causal \nconnection to the sexual assault, sexual harassment, discrimination, and hostile environment to \nwhich she was subjected.  \n  For over a decade, Dartmouth held Heatherton, Whalen, and Kelley out as esteemed \nprofessors  in good standing and  ignored credible reports of their serial sexual  misconduct. \nDartmouth then concealed the existence of the Title IX investigation and did not release any \ninformation publicly nor to students in the Department. While Dartmouth continued cloaking its \nmisconduct, Jane Doe 3 had no reason to suspect that Dartmouth knowingly and deliberately failed \nto prevent the sexual misconduct inflicted by the professors. Investigator Davis seemingly made \n67 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 68 of 85\nno effort to address Dartmouth’s prior knowledge of the professors’ conduct or its role in fostering \nthe continuing harassment. Even after the investigation was leaked to the media, Dartmouth did \nnot  release  any  details  about  the  allegations.  Because  Dartmouth  actively  concealed  this \ninformation from the general public, Jane Doe 3 could not, with reasonable diligence, have learned \nthis information independently. She discovered this information only when the initial Complaint \nwas filed on November 15, 2018. \n  Jane Doe 3 was drawn to Dartmouth because of its academic reputation and the \nprestige of the PBS Department. She came to Dartmouth as an enthusiastic and ambitious young \nscientist but was quickly demoralized by the environment and treatment she experienced. Jane Doe \n3 was made to feel as though she had little academic worth and was viewed only as a sexual object. \nAt Kelley’s behest, she withdrew from her family and friends and became socially isolated from \nher peers. As a result of the sexual harassment, discrimination, and toxic environment she was \nsubjected to, Jane Doe 3 became depressed, anxious, and demoralized. She ultimately transitioned \nto a different area of research to distance herself from Kelley, Heatherton, and Whalen. \nV.  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n  Plaintiffs and Class Representatives re-allege and incorporate by reference each and \nevery allegation in the Complaint as though fully set forth herein. \n  Plaintiffs and Class Representatives sue on behalf of themselves individually and \non behalf of three classes of similarly-situated individuals pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure 23(b)(2) and (b)(3). \n  Dartmouth tolerates and cultivates a gender discriminatory and sexually hostile \nenvironment for female students in the Department. Dartmouth has failed to respond adequately \nor appropriately to evidence and complaints of gender discrimination, sexual harassment, and \n68 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 69 of 85\nhostile environment in the Department. The College has failed to create adequate procedures to \nensure its employees comply with anti-discrimination laws and has failed to adequately discipline \nits employees when they violate anti-discrimination laws. Dartmouth knew or should have known \nthat, because of its actions and inactions, female students have been subjected to a sexually hostile \nenvironment that has been sufficiently severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive to interfere \nwith their educational opportunities, undermining and detracting from their school experience. \nDartmouth’s  policies,  practices,  and  procedures  for  investigating  and  responding  to  student \ncomplaints of gender discrimination, sexual harassment and hostile environment have an ongoing \ndisparate impact on female students.  \nA.  Rule 23 Class Definition \n  Plaintiffs and Class Representatives seek to bring this action under Rule 23 on \nbehalf  of  every  current  and  former  female  graduate  and  undergraduate  student  who  has \nmatriculated or will matriculate at Dartmouth in the Department of Psychological and Brain \nSciences between March 31, 2015, and the date of judgment. \n  Plaintiffs reserve the right to modify this Class definition and Class period.  \nB.  Efficiency of Class Prosecution of Class Claims \n  Certification of the proposed class is the most efficient and economical means of \nresolving the questions of law and fact that are common to the claims of the Plaintiffs and the \nClass. \n  Plaintiffs’ individual claims, as Class Representatives, require resolution of the \ncommon  questions  concerning  whether  Dartmouth  has  subjected  its  female  students  in  the \nDepartment to a sexually hostile environment that is sufficiently severe, pervasive, and objectively \noffensive to interfere with their educational opportunities, undermining and detracting from their \n69 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 70 of 85\nschool experience. The Class Representatives seek remedies to eliminate the adverse effects of \nsuch discrimination in their own lives and working conditions, and the working conditions of the \nclass members, and to prevent Dartmouth’s continued gender discrimination. \n  The Class Representatives have standing to seek such relief because of the adverse \neffect that such discrimination has  had on them individually and on female students in the \nDepartment generally. Dartmouth caused Plaintiffs’ injuries through its discriminatory practices, \npolicies, and procedures and failure to remedy or correct such discrimination. These injuries are \nredressable through systemic relief, such as equitable and injunctive relief and other remedies \nsought in this action. Plaintiffs have a personal interest in the policies, practices, and procedures \nimplemented at Dartmouth. \n  To obtain relief for themselves and the class members, the Class Representatives \nwill first establish the existence of systemic gender discrimination and hostile work environment \nas the premise for the relief they seek. Without class certification, the same evidence and issues \nwould be subject to re-litigation in a multitude of individual lawsuits with an attendant risk of \ninconsistent adjudications and conflicting obligations.  \n  Certification of the proposed class is the most reasonable and efficient means of \npresenting  the  evidence  and  arguments  necessary  to  resolve  such  questions  for  the  Class \nRepresentatives and the class members. \nC.  Numerosity and Impracticability of Joinder  \n  The Class that the Class Representatives seek to represent is too numerous to make \njoinder practicable.  \n70 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 71 of 85\n  Upon information and belief, the proposed class consists of more than 40 current \nand former female students during the liability period. The exact size of the Class and the identities \nof the individual members are ascertainable through records maintained by Dartmouth. \nD.  Common Questions of Law and Fact \n  Prosecuting  Class  Representatives’  claims  will  require  the  adjudication  of \nnumerous questions of law and fact common to their claims and those of the Class they seek to \nrepresent.  \n  Common questions of law and fact predominate, and include, but are not limited \nto, the following: (i) whether Dartmouth has engaged in unlawful, systemic sex discrimination and \nfacilitated a hostile educational environment that violates Title IX; (ii) whether Dartmouth has \nviolated the Title IX and other legal rights of its female students by failing to adequately prevent, \ninvestigate,  or  respond  with  appropriate  corrective  action  to  evidence  and  complaints  of \ndiscrimination in the educational environment; (iii) whether Dartmouth is liable for continuing \nsystemic violations of Title IX; (iv) whether the harassment permitted and facilitated by Dartmouth \ninterfered with the work or educational opportunities normally available to students; (v) whether \nan  “appropriate  person”  had  knowledge  of  the  sexual  harassment  and  hostile  environment, \nincluding such knowledge of facts that would reasonably indicate substantial risk to any female \nstudents,  and  failed  to  adequately  respond;  (vi)  whether  Dartmouth  acted  with  deliberate \nindifference to the notice of harassment; (vii) whether Dartmouth owed Plaintiffs and the proposed \nclass members a fiduciary duty; (viii) whether Dartmouth breached its fiduciary duty by tolerating, \ncondoning, ratifying, and/or engaging in the hostile environment, sexual harassment, gender \ndiscrimination, and/or retaliation, and failing to take remedial action; (ix) whether Dartmouth \n71 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 72 of 85\nknew or should have known that its breach of fiduciary duty resulted in the sexual harassment and \nhostile environment to which Plaintiffs and members of the proposed class were subjected.  \nE.  Typicality of Claims and Relief Sought \n  Each Class Representative is a member of the Class she seeks to represent. The \nClass  Representatives’  claims  are  typical  of  the  claims  of  the  proposed  class.  The  Class \nRepresentatives possess and assert each of the claims they assert on behalf of the proposed class. \nThey pursue the same factual and legal theories and seek similar relief.  \n  Like members of the proposed class, the Class Representatives are current and \nformer  female  graduate  or  undergraduate  students  who  matriculated  in  the  Department  at \nDartmouth during the liability period. \n  The acts and omissions to which Defendants subjected the Class Representatives \nand the Class applied universally within the Class and were not unique to any Class Representative \nor Class Member.  \n  Dartmouth has failed to respond adequately or appropriately to evidence and \ncomplaints of sexual harassment and hostile environment in the Department. Dartmouth has failed \nto create adequate procedures to ensure its employees comply with anti-discrimination laws and \nhas failed to adequately discipline its employees when they violate anti-discrimination laws. The \nClass Representatives and proposed class members have been affected in the same or similar ways \nby Dartmouth’s failure to implement adequate procedures to detect, monitor, and correct this \npattern and practice of discrimination and sexually hostile environment. \n  The relief necessary to remedy the claims of the Class Representatives is the same \nas that necessary to remedy the claims of the proposed class members. The Class Representatives \nseek the following relief for their individual claims and on behalf of the members of the proposed \n72 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 73 of 85\nclass: (i) a declaratory judgment that Dartmouth’s policies, practices and/or procedures challenged \nherein are illegal and in violation of the rights of Class Representatives and class members under, \ninter alia, Title IX and the applicable New Hampshire state laws; (ii) a permanent injunction \nagainst  Dartmouth  and  its  partners,  officers,  owners,  agents,  successors,  employees  and/or \nrepresentatives, and any and all persons acting in concert with them, from engaging in any further \nunlawful practices, policies, customs, and usages as set forth herein; (iii) an Order requiring \nDefendants  to  initiate  and  implement  programs  and  policies  that  (a)  remedy  the  gender \ndiscrimination, sexual harassment, and hostile environment at Dartmouth; (b) ensure prompt \nremedial action regarding all claims of gender discrimination, sexual harassment and hostile \nenvironment;  and  (c)  eliminate  the  continuing  effects  of  the  discriminatory  and  retaliatory \npractices described herein; (iv) an award of damages to Plaintiffs and the Class under Title IX of \nthe Education Amendments of 1972 and common law, including compensatory damages and \nenhanced compensatory damages and/or punitive damages to deter Dartmouth from engaging in \nsimilar discriminatory practices in the future; and (v) an award of litigation costs and expenses, \nincluding reasonable attorneys’ fees. \nF.  Adequacy of Representation \n  The Class Representatives are adequate representatives of the proposed class. \n  The Class Representatives’ interests are coextensive with those of the members of \nthe proposed class that they seek to represent in this case. The Class Representatives seek to \nremedy Dartmouth’s hostile environment so female students will not suffer differential treatment, \ndepriving them of educational opportunities and resources. \n  The Class Representatives are willing and able to represent the proposed class fairly \nand vigorously as they pursue their similar individual claims in this action. \n73 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 74 of 85\n  The  Class  Representatives  have  retained  counsel  sufficiently  qualified, \nexperienced, and able to conduct this litigation and to meet the time and fiscal demands required \nto litigate a class action of this size and complexity. The combined interests, experiences, and \nresources of the Class Representatives and their counsel to litigate competently the individual and \nclass claims at issue in this case clearly satisfy the adequacy of representation requirement of Rule \n23(a)(4). \nG.  Requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) \n  Dartmouth has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the Class \nRepresentatives  and  the  proposed  class  by  facilitating  a  hostile  environment  and  failing  to \nadequately prevent, investigate, or respond with appropriate corrective action to evidence and \ncomplaints  of  hostile  environment,  sexual  harassment,  and  retaliation  by  faculty  and \nadministrators. Dartmouth’s systemic discrimination and refusals to act on nondiscriminatory \ngrounds justify the requested injunctive and declaratory relief for the Class as a whole. \n  Injunctive, declaratory, and affirmative relief are a predominant form of relief \nsought in this case. Entitlement to declaratory, injunctive, and affirmative relief flows directly and \nautomatically from proof of the College’s systemic sex discrimination. In turn, entitlement to \ndeclaratory, injunctive, and affirmative relief forms the factual and legal predicate for recovery by \nthe  Class  Representatives  and  class  members  of  monetary  and  non-monetary  remedies  for \nindividual losses caused by the systemic discrimination, as well as their recovery of compensatory \nand punitive damages. \nH.  Requirements of Rule 23(b)(3) \n  The  common  issues  of  fact  and  law  affecting  the  claims  of  the  Class \nRepresentatives and proposed class members—including, but not limited to, the common issues \n74 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 75 of 85\nidentified above—predominate over any issues affecting only individual claims. The common \nissues include whether Dartmouth has engaged in sex discrimination against female students by \nfacilitating a hostile environment and failing to appropriately handle evidence and complaints of \nharassment. \n  A  class  action  is  superior to  other  available  means  for  fairly  and  efficiently \nadjudicating the claims of the Class Representatives and members of the proposed class. The cost \nof  proving  Dartmouth’s  hostile  academic  environment  for  female  students  also  makes  it \nimpracticable for the Class Representatives and class members to pursue their claims individually. \n  The hostile academic environment at Dartmouth makes the Class Representatives \nand  class  members  eligible  for  monetary  remedies  for  losses  caused  by  this  systemic \ndiscrimination, including back pay, front pay, compensatory damages, and other relief. \n  Additionally,  or  in  the  alternative,  the  Court  may  grant  “partial”  or  “issue” \ncertification  under  Rule  23(c)(4).  Resolution  of  common  questions  of  fact  and  law  would \nmaterially advance the litigation for all class members.  \nVI.  COUNTS \nCOUNT ONE \n \nVIOLATION OF TITLE IX OF THE EDUCATION AMENDMENTS OF 1972,  \nAS AMENDED — \nSEXUAL HARASSMENT – HOSTILE EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT \n(On Behalf of All Plaintiffs, Class Representatives and Class Members) \n \n  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation in each \nand every aforementioned paragraph as if fully set forth herein. \n  This Count is brought on behalf of the Plaintiffs and Class Representatives and all \nmembers of the proposed class. \n75 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 76 of 85\n  Upon information and belief, at all times relevant to this action, Dartmouth has \nreceived, and continues to receive, federal financial assistance. \n  Dartmouth has subjected Plaintiffs, Class Representatives and the members of the \nproposed class to a sexually hostile educational environment in violation of Title IX.  \n  Dartmouth  has  discriminated  against  Plaintiffs,  Class  Representatives  and  all \nmembers of the proposed class by subjecting them to a sexually hostile environment that was \nsufficiently severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive to interfere with the Plaintiffs’ and the \nproposed class members’ educational opportunities, undermining and detracting from their school \nexperience. Because of Dartmouth’s failure to implement adequate procedures to detect, monitor, \nand correct this discrimination and hostile environment, Dartmouth has denied Plaintiffs and \nmembers of the proposed class their personal right to work and learn in an environment free of \nsexual harassment. \n  Dartmouth  was  on  actual  notice  of  the  sexual  harassment  committed  by  the \nDepartment’s  professors  and the  hostile  academic  environment that  the  Plaintiffs  and  class \nmembers endured at Dartmouth during the relevant timeframe. Dartmouth has demonstrated \ndeliberate indifference by tolerating, condoning, ratifying, and/or engaging in the hostile work and \neducational environment and failing to take remedial action.  \n  Because  of  Dartmouth’s  unlawful  conduct,  Plaintiffs  and  the  proposed  class \nmembers have suffered and will continue to suffer harm, including but not limited to loss of future \neducational  and  employment  opportunities,  humiliation,  embarrassment,  reputational  harm, \nemotional and physical distress, mental anguish, and other economic damages and non-economic \ndamages. \n76 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 77 of 85\n  By reason of the continuous nature of Dartmouth’s unlawful conduct, Plaintiffs and \nthe proposed class members are entitled to the application of the continuing violation doctrine to \nthe unlawful acts alleged herein.  \n  Plaintiffs and the proposed class members are entitled to all legal and equitable \nremedies available for violations of Title IX, including compensatory damages, injunctive relief, \nattorneys’ fees and costs, and other appropriate relief. \nCOUNT TWO \n \nVIOLATION OF TITLE IX OF THE EDUCATION AMENDMENTS OF 1972, AS \nAMENDED — \nGENDER DISCRIMINATION IN TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF EDUCATION U.S.C. \n§ 1681 et seq. \n(On Behalf of Plaintiffs, Class Representatives and Class Members) \n  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation in each \nand every aforementioned paragraph as if fully set forth herein. \n  This Count is brought on behalf of the Plaintiffs and Class Representatives and all \nmembers of the proposed class. \n  Upon information and belief, at all times relevant to this action, Dartmouth has \nreceived, and continues to receive, federal financial assistance. \n  Dartmouth  has  discriminated  against  Plaintiffs,  Class  Representatives  and  all \nmembers of the proposed class by subjecting them to different treatment on the basis of their \ngender. Plaintiffs and members of the proposed class were treated differently and less favorably \nthan similar-situated male students. Dartmouth subjected Plaintiffs and members of the proposed \nclass to disparate terms and conditions of education in violation of Title IX. \n  Dartmouth’s differential treatment of Plaintiffs and members of the proposed class \nis a direct and proximate result of gender discrimination.  \n77 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 78 of 85\n  Dartmouth  has  failed  to  prevent,  respond  to,  adequately  investigate,  and/or \nappropriately resolve instances of gender discrimination. \n  Dartmouth had actual notice of this discrimination and failed to adequately respond, \nboth before and after the discrimination against Plaintiffs and members of the proposed class \noccurred, amounting to deliberate indifference. \n  Because of the continuous nature of Dartmouth’s unlawful conduct, Plaintiffs and \nmembers of the proposed class have suffered and will continue to suffer harm, including but not \nlimited to loss of future educational and employment opportunities, humiliation, embarrassment, \nreputational harm, emotional and physical distress, mental anguish, and other economic damages \nand non-economic damages. \n  Because of the continuous nature of Dartmouth’s unlawful conduct, Plaintiffs and \nmembers of the proposed class are entitled to the application of the continuing violation doctrine \nto the unlawful acts alleged herein.  \n  Plaintiffs and the proposed class are entitled to all legal and equitable remedies \navailable for violations of Title IX, including compensatory damages, attorneys’ fees and costs, \nand other appropriate relief. \nCOUNT THREE \n \nBREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY UNDER NEW HAMPSHIRE LAW \n(On Behalf of All Plaintiffs, Class Representatives and Class Members) \n  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation in each \nand every aforementioned paragraph as if fully set forth herein. \n  This Count is brought on behalf of the Plaintiffs and Class Representatives and all \nmembers of the proposed class. \n78 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 79 of 85\n  Plaintiffs, Class Representatives and the proposed class members are or were \nenrolled at Dartmouth as undergraduate and/or graduate students in the Department during the \nliability period. \n  Dartmouth,  a  New  Hampshire  post-secondary  educational  institution,  has  a \nfiduciary relationship with the Plaintiffs and the members of the proposed class. Plaintiffs and the \nproposed class were or are dependent on Dartmouth for their education, and Dartmouth owed them \na duty to act in good faith and with due regard for their interests. Dartmouth thus owed Plaintiffs \nand the proposed class a fiduciary duty to create an environment in which they could pursue their \neducation free from sexual harassment by faculty members. \n  Dartmouth breached the fiduciary duty it owed to Plaintiffs, Class Representatives \nand  the  proposed  class  by  tolerating,  condoning,  ratifying,  and/or  engaging  in  the  hostile \nenvironment, sexual harassment, gender discrimination, and/or retaliation, and failing to take \nremedial action. Dartmouth failed to adopt and enforce practices and grievance procedures to \neffectively respond to faculty misconduct that would minimize the danger Plaintiffs and the \nproposed class would be exposed to sexual harassment by faculty members. Dartmouth failed to \nact in good faith and with due regard for the interests of Plaintiffs and members of the proposed \nclass, who entrusted Dartmouth with their confidence.  \n  Dartmouth  knew  or  should  have  known  that  it  fostered  a  hostile  academic \nenvironment that enabled Heatherton, Kelley, and  Whalen to sexually  harass Plaintiffs and \nmembers of the proposed class. Dartmouth knew that Heatherton, Kelley, and Whalen had a \npropensity for sexually harassing female students. \n79 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 80 of 85\n  The faculty and members of administration responsible for the sexual harassment \nand  hostile  environment  in  the  Department  were  or  are  employed  by  Dartmouth  and  had \nsupervisory authority over the Plaintiffs and proposed class members. \n  Dartmouth’s conduct was wanton, malicious, outrageous, and conducted with full \nknowledge of the law. Dartmouth exhibited reckless indifference to the foreseeable risks of harm. \n  Because  of  Dartmouth’s  breach  of  its  fiduciary  duty  owed  to  Plaintiffs  and \nmembers of the proposed class, Plaintiffs and members of the proposed class have suffered and \nwill continue to suffer harm, including but not limited to loss of future educational and employment \nopportunities, humiliation, embarrassment, reputational harm, emotional and physical distress, \nmental anguish, and other economic damages and non-economic damages. \n  Plaintiffs and members of the proposed class have suffered and continue to suffer \ndamages and injuries for which Dartmouth is liable under state law.  \nCOUNT FOUR \n \nNEGLIGENT SUPERVISION AND RETENTION UNDER NEW HAMPSHIRE LAW \n(On Behalf of Plaintiffs, Class Representatives and Class Members) \n  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation in each \nand every aforementioned paragraph as if fully set forth herein. \n  Dartmouth owed Plaintiffs, Class Representatives and members of the proposed \nclass a duty of care to protect them from sexual harassment, which was unwarranted, unwanted \nand improper.  \n  Dartmouth breached its duty in its training, supervision and retention of Kelley, \nWhalen, and Heatherton, employees that Dartmouth knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care \nshould have known, were unfit to work with and supervise young, female students. \n80 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 81 of 85\n  As a direct and proximate result of Dartmouth’s breach of its duty, Plaintiffs and \nmembers of the proposed class were subjected to sexual harassment by Kelley, Whalen, and \nHeatherton. \n  Plaintiffs,  Class  Representatives  and  members  of  the  proposed  class  suffered \ndamages and injuries for which Dartmouth is liable under state law.  \nCOUNT FIVE \nVIOLATION OF TITLE IX OF THE EDUCATION AMENDMENTS OF 1972, \nAS AMENDED — \nQUID PRO QUO SEXUAL HARASSMENT \n20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq. \n(On Behalf of All Plaintiffs) \n  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation in each \nand every aforementioned paragraph as if fully set forth herein. \n  This Count is brought on behalf of all Plaintiffs. \n  Upon information and belief, at all times relevant to this action, Dartmouth has \nreceived, and continues to receive, federal financial assistance. \n  Dartmouth  has  discriminated  against  Plaintiffs  by  creating  and  maintaining  a \nhostile educational environment in violation of Title IX. The hostile environment endured by the \nPlaintiffs  was  sufficiently  severe,  pervasive,  and objectively  offensive  to  interfere  with  the \nPlaintiffs’ educational opportunities, undermining and detracting from their school experience. \n  Plaintiffs were subjected to unwelcome quid pro quo sexual harassment based on \ntheir  sex.  They  were  subjected  to  unwelcome  sexual  conduct,  including  sexual  comments, \nunwanted sexual advances, and unwanted touching. Plaintiffs were expected to submit to this \nunwelcome sexual conduct in exchange for favorable academic treatment, including mentoring \ntime, research assistance, grades, and other academic opportunities. \n81 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 82 of 85\n  Dartmouth had actual notice of this conduct by Heatherton, Kelley, and Whalen, \nand was deliberately indifferent to this harassment, both before and after the harassment of \nPlaintiffs occurred. Such deliberate indifference places Plaintiffs and other students at risk of \nsexual harassment.  \n  By reason of the continuous nature of Dartmouth’s unlawful conduct, Plaintiffs \nhave suffered and will continue to  suffer harm, including but not  limited to  loss of  future \neducational  and  employment  opportunities,  humiliation,  embarrassment,  reputational  harm, \nemotional and physical distress, mental anguish, and other economic damages and non-economic \ndamages. \n  By reason of the continuous nature of Dartmouth’s unlawful conduct, Plaintiffs are \nentitled to the application of the continuing violation doctrine to the unlawful acts alleged herein.  \n  Plaintiffs are entitled to all legal and equitable remedies available for violations of \nTitle IX, including compensatory damages, attorneys’ fees and costs, and other appropriate relief. \nCOUNT SIX \n \nVIOLATION OF TITLE IX OF THE EDUCATION AMENDMENTS OF 1972, AS \nAMENDED — \nRETALIATION \n20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq. \n(On Behalf of Plaintiffs Chauhan, Brietzke, Brown, Evans, and Doe) \n  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation in each \nand every aforementioned paragraph as if fully set forth herein. \n  This Count is brought on behalf of Plaintiffs Chauhan, Brietzke, Brown, Evans, and \nDoe. \n  Upon information and belief, at all times relevant to this action, Dartmouth has \nreceived, and continues to receive, federal financial assistance. \n82 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 83 of 85\n  Plaintiffs Chauhan, Brietzke, Brown, Evans, and Doe engaged in protected activity \nby participating in the Title IX complaint and investigation. Dartmouth knew that these Plaintiffs \nengaged in this protected activity and subsequently undertook actions disadvantageous to them, \nincluding denying reasonable accommodations, expulsion, unwarranted grades of “fail,” and \nconvening a meeting of all students in the Department to publicly denounce the victims of the \ninvestigation. A retaliatory animus substantially  motivated Dartmouth to take these adverse \nactions. \n  Dartmouth’s differential treatment of these Plaintiffs is a direct and proximate result \nof the protected activity they undertook.  \n  Because of the continuous nature of Dartmouth’s unlawful conduct, Plaintiffs have \nsuffered and will continue to suffer harm, including but not limited to loss of future educational \nand employment opportunities, humiliation, embarrassment, reputational harm, emotional and \nphysical distress, mental anguish, and other economic damages and non-economic damages. \n  Because of the continuous nature of Dartmouth’s unlawful conduct, Plaintiffs are \nentitled to the application of the continuing violation doctrine to the unlawful acts alleged herein.  \n  Plaintiffs are entitled to all legal and equitable remedies available for violations of \nTitle IX, including compensatory damages, attorneys’ fees and costs, and other appropriate relief. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF ON CLAIMS \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs and Class Representatives, on their own behalf and on behalf \nof the proposed class, pray that this Court grant the following relief: \nA.  Certification of this case as a class action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 \non behalf of the proposed Plaintiff Class, designation of the proposed Class Representatives as \nrepresentatives of this Class, and designation of Plaintiffs’ counsel of record as Class Counsel; \n83 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 28   Filed 05/01/19   Page 84 of 85\nB.  A declaratory judgment that Dartmouth’s policies, practices and/or procedures \nchallenged herein are illegal and in violation of the rights of Class Representatives and class \nmembers under, inter alia, Title IX and the applicable New Hampshire state laws; \nC.  A  permanent  injunction  against  Dartmouth  and  its  officers,  owners,  agents, \nsuccessors, employees and/or representatives, and any and all persons acting in concert with them, \nfrom engaging in any further unlawful practices, policies, customs, and usages as set forth herein; \nD.  An Order requiring Defendants to initiate and implement programs and policies \nthat  (i)  remedy  the  gender  discrimination,  sexual  harassment,  and  hostile  environment  at \nDartmouth; (ii) ensure prompt remedial action regarding all claims of gender discrimination, \nsexual harassment and hostile environment; and (iii) eliminate the continuing effects of the \ndiscriminatory and retaliatory practices described herein; \nE.  An award of damages to Plaintiffs and the Class under Title IX of the Education \nAmendments of 1972 and common law, including compensatory damages and punitive damages, \nin an amount not less than $70,000,000; \nF.  An award of litigation costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees to \nthe Plaintiffs;  \nG.  An award of pre-judgment interest and post-judgment interest available under law; \nand \nH.  Such additional and further relief as this Court may deem just and proper. \nVII.

The\ncourt has weighed the multi−factor balancing test, seeDoe v. Megless, 654 F.3d 404,\n408−09 (3d Cir. 2011), and finds that the balance of factors weighs heavily in favor\nof a pseudonym. However, as inDoe v. Trustees of Dartmouth Coll., No.\n18−CV−040−LM, 2018 WL 2048385, at *7 (D.N.H. May 2, 2018), the court's order\nis limited to pretrial proceedings. Also, if, at any point during pretrial proceedings,\nJane Doe's use of a pseudonym impacts whether she can act as a class\nrepresentative, the court will reconsider this order.SeeIn re Ashley Madison\nCustomer Data Security Breach Litigation, MDL No. 2669, 2016 WL 1366616, at *4\n(E.D. Mo. Apr. 6, 2016) (allowing anonymity for plaintiff as class member but not\nclass representative). Accordingly, the parties shall use the pseudonym Jane Doe for\nthis plaintiff and shall redact her true name from all documents in this case and\nrefrain from revealing her true identity.

On March 16, 2020, Defendant served a Supplemental CAFA \nNotice.  \nOn January 29, 2020, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Approval of  \nClass Action Settlement (the “Preliminary Approval Order”).  In that order, doc. no. 50, the Court \nconducted a rigorous and searching analysis of whether it would likely be able to certify the class \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 69   Filed 07/10/20   Page 2 of 7\nfor the purposes of settlement and find that the proposed settlement is fair, reasonable, and \nadequate.  \nOn February 12, 2020, Class Counsel and the Settlement Administrator sent the Notice of \nProposed Settlement of Class Action (the “Notice”) as ordered.  \nOn July 9, 2020, the Court held a fairness hearing regarding the parties’ class action \nsettlement.  The Court now finds and rules as follows.  \n1.  Having considered Plaintiffs’ motion for Final Approval of the Class Settlement \nand the statements made at the fairness hearing, the Court hereby grants final approval of the \nAgreement.  The Court has not reviewed or heard any information that would change the Court's \nview expressed in the Preliminary Approval Order that the class can be certified for settlement \npurposes and that the proposed settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate.  The Court grants \napproval of the Agreement for all the reasons stated in its Preliminary Approval Order, doc. no. \n50, and the reasons outlined in Plaintiffs’ final approval pleadings.  \n2.  Any term with initial capitalization that is not defined in this Order shall have the \nmeaning provided in the Agreement.  \n3.  The Court confirms that it has jurisdiction over this matter and the parties to it. \n4.  The Court hereby affirms its findings in its Preliminary Approval Order, that, for \npurposes of settlement only, the prerequisites for a class action under Rules 23(a) and (b)(3) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure have been satisfied in that:  (a) the number of Settlement Class \nMembers is so numerous that joinder thereof is impracticable; (b) there are questions of law and fact \ncommon to the Settlement Class; (c) the claims of the Class Representatives are typical of the claims \nof the Settlement Class Members; (d) the Class Representatives and Class Counsel have and will \nfairly and adequately represent the interests of the Settlement Class Members; (e) the questions of \nlaw and fact common to the Settlement Class Members predominate over any questions affectingly \n2  \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 69   Filed 07/10/20   Page 3 of 7\nonly individual Settlement Class Members; and (f) a class action is superior to other available \nmethods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.  \n5.  For purposes of settlement only, the Court further affirms its determinations in the \nPreliminary Approval Order and finally certifies, pursuant to Rule 23(a) and (b)(3) of the Federal  \nRules of Civil Procedure, the Action as a class action, composed of the following individuals:  \nA.  All current and former women graduate students at Dartmouth who meet any of the \nfollowing criteria: \n   i.  Between April 1, 2012 and August 31, 2017 were graduate advisees \nof one or more of Todd Heatherton, William Kelley, and/or Paul \nWhalen (collectively “the Three Professors”); \n  ii.  Between  April  1,  2012  and  August  31,  2017  were  teaching  or \nresearch assistants for one or more of the Three Professors; \niii.   Were graduate students in the Psychological and Brain Sciences \nDepartment and co-authored papers with one or more of the Three \nProfessors based on research conducted between April 1, 2012 and \nAugust 31, 2017; OR \niv.  Were graduate students in the Psychological and Brain Sciences \nDepartment between March 31, 2015 and August 31, 2017 who do \nnot  fit  within  categories  (i)-(iii),  but  who  attested  that  they \nexperienced dignitary, emotional, educational and/or professional \nharm during this period as a result of the misconduct of one or more \nof the Three Professors. \nB. All current and former women undergraduate students at Dartmouth who, between \nApril 1, 2012 and August 31, 2017, worked as research assistants for one or more of \nthe Three Former Professors. As used herein, “research assistants” includes individuals \n3  \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 69   Filed 07/10/20   Page 4 of 7\nworking on an honors thesis or independent research study in one or more of the Three \nFormer Professors’ labs. \n6. This Court finally approves the terms of the Agreement and the Plan of Allocation, the \nmaterial terms of which include, but are not limited to:  \nA.  Defendant will pay the Class Settlement Amount of $14,000,000 in the manner set \nforth in the Settlement Agreement; \nB.  Defendant will implement the programmatic relief described in Exhibit A to the \nAgreement; \nC.  Class Counsel will receive attorneys’ fees of $4,900,000 from the Class Settlement \nAmount; \nD.  Class Counsel’s litigation expenses ($125,756.42) will be deducted from the Class  \nSettlement Amount; \nE.  Settlement  administration  costs  incurred  by  the  Settlement  Administrator,  Rust \nConsulting, Inc. (in an amount not to exceed $24,217.00) and the Independent Claims \nExpert, Maria C. Walsh, Esq. (in an amount not to exceed $85,000) will be deducted \nfrom the Class Settlement Amount; \nF.  The Plaintiffs will each receive service awards of $75,000 for their contributions to the \nlitigation and their services to the Class, including incurring the risks and burdens of \nlitigation on behalf of the Class Members; \nG.  The remainder of the Class Settlement Amount will be distributed to the Plaintiffs and \nSettlement Class Members as detailed in the Plan of Allocation; \nH.  The Court finds that the distribution of residual monies to The New Hampshire \nCoalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, an organization supporting and/or \n4  \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 69   Filed 07/10/20   Page 5 of 7\nadvocating for victims of sexual assault, is an appropriate, fair, and reasonable cy pres \nremedy. Therefore, the Court approves of the cy pres distribution provided for in the  \nSettlement to The New Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual  \nViolence. \n \nI.  The Plaintiffs and Settlement Class Members who did not exclude themselves are \nbound by the terms of the Agreement, including all releases therein, and their claims \nare dismissed with prejudice. \n7.  The  Court  finds  that  the  Notice,  and  the  distribution  thereof,  satisfied  the \nrequirements of due process and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e), that it was the best \npracticable under the circumstances, and that it constitutes due and sufficient notice to all persons \nentitled to notice of the Agreement.  \n8.  The Court similarly finds that the Notice was adequate and gave all Settlement Class \nMembers sufficient information to enable them to make informed decisions as to the parties’ \nproposed settlement, and the right to object to, or opt-out of it.  \n9.  The Court also finds that the parties’ settlement, on the terms and conditions set \nforth in the Agreement, is in all respects fundamentally fair, reasonable, adequate, and in the best \ninterests of the Settlement Class Members.    \n10.  The Court further finds that the Settlement Class Members were given a fair and \nreasonable opportunity to object to the settlement.  Zero (0) Settlement Class Members objected to \nthe settlement.  Six (6) Settlement Class Members requested exclusion.  Those individuals are \nexcluded from the Settlement Class and are not bound by this order.  \n11.  This Order is binding on all Settlement Class Members, except those individuals \nwho validly and timely excluded themselves from the Settlement Class and the Agreement, or \nwhose late exclusion was agreed to by the parties.  \n5  \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 69   Filed 07/10/20   Page 6 of 7\n12.  This action is dismissed with prejudice as to all other issues and as to all parties and \nclaims.  \n13.  Upon the Effective Date, the Released Parties, as defined in the next paragraph, \nshall be released and forever discharged by Plaintiffs and all Settlement Class Members (except \nthose individuals who validly excluded themselves from the Settlement Class and the Agreement) \n(“Releasing Parties”) from any and all causes of action, judgments, liens, indebtedness, costs, \ndamages, penalties, expenses, obligations, attorneys’ fees, losses, claims, liabilities and demands \nof whatever kind or character (each a “Claim”), known or unknown, arising on or before the \nEffective Date, that are, were or could have been asserted against any of the Released Parties by \nreason of or arising out of the same factual predicate as the claims that were or could have been \nasserted in the Litigation (namely the alleged conduct of the Three Former Professors and \nDefendant’s alleged conduct and any related acts and omissions, including the 2017 Title IX \ninvestigation), whether any such Claim was or could have been asserted by any Releasing Party \non her own behalf or on behalf of other Persons.  \n14.  Released  Parties  means  Defendant,  and  expressly  includes  its  administrators, \ntrustees, employees, insurers, representatives, and assigns.  The Release does not extend to claims \nor potential claims that any Releasing Party may possess against the Three Professors, provided \nthat such claims may proceed only against the Three Professors personally, and any potential \nliability that the Released Parties may have had, or arguably had, individually or jointly and \nseverally, for such conduct is released.  \n15.  This Order does not, and is not intended to constitute, nor shall it be deemed to \nconstitute, an admission by any party as to the merits, validity, or accuracy of any of the allegations, \nclaims, or defenses of any other party in this case.  The Court has made no findings and expresses \nno opinion concerning the merits, validity, or accuracy of any of the allegations, claims, or defenses \nin this case.  \n6  \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01070-LM   Document 69   Filed 07/10/20   Page 7 of 7\n16.  Plaintiffs, including but not limited to the Class Representatives, and all Settlement \nClass Members, and anyone who acts or purports to act on their behalf, shall not bring, assert, or \nprosecute any claims, actions, or causes of action that assert any of the released Claims against \nany of the Released Parties.  \n17.  The Court grants Plaintiffs’ Motion for Attorneys’ Fees, Costs, and Service Awards, \ndoc. no. 55, for all the reasons stated in Plaintiffs’ memorandum in support of that motion. \n18.  The Court retains continuing and exclusive jurisdiction over the parties and the \nadministration of the Settlement Agreement only with respect to the distribution of the Class \nSettlement Amount.  \n \nIn conclusion, the Court grants Plaintiffs’ Motion for Final Approval of the Proposed Class \nSettlement (doc. no. 54) and Plaintiffs’ Motion for Attorneys’ Fees, Costs, and Service Awards \n(doc. no. 55).   \nSO ORDERED. \n          \n  _____________________________ \n   Landya B.
