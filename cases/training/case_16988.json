    "summary": "<p>On October 10, 2013, Prison Legal News (“PLN”) filed this lawsuit on behalf of itself and Sullivan County Jail prisoners in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee. The plaintiff sued Sullivan County under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiff, represented by both private and public interest legal counsel, sought declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief, claiming violations of the First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. The plaintiff claimed that Sullivan County and its sheriff implemented unconstitutional policies that censored prisoner’s access to PLN’s monthly publication and correspondence mailed to prisoners. The policy (Policy I), established in October 2011, required that all mail communication fit on a standard postcard. Any mail the Jail received that did not fit the permitted standard was returned to the sender. The plaintiff also argued that the jail’s current policies were a form of content-based discrimination because the defendants maintained and permitted other magazines inside the jail and prohibited the plaintiff’s materials. </p><p>On October 30, 2013, plaintiff filed a motion for preliminary injunction, enjoining the defendants from implementing their policy prohibiting non-postcard mail communication to prisoners as a violation of both sender and recipients’ First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment Due Process rights. District Judge J Ronnie Greer ordered for defendants to provide a response to plaintiff’s motion by November 22, 2013. On November 21, 2013, the defendants filed a motion requesting a time extension to submit their response to the plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction, claiming that it was unaware of the previously provided deadline. Judge Greer granted that request and the defendants filed their response on December  9, 2013. The defendants argued that the preliminary injunction request was inappropriate and unnecessary given jail safety concerns, permittance of plaintiff’s content to prisoners if properly addressed to an individual, and the October 24, 2013, policy that abandoned the previous postcard-only policy.  During 2014, both parties filed subsequent supplement briefs in support and opposition of the preliminary motion under local rule 7.1(d). </p><p>On March 26, 2015, Judge Greer submitted an order denying the plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction because the issue of due process was not properly before the Court. Judge Greer permitted the plaintiff’s ten days to amend its complaint and allege claims based on Sullivan County Jail’s new policy. The plaintiff filed a new motion for preliminary injunction on the same day. On March 27, 2015, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint, in compliance with the District Court’s order. Plaintiff argued that the new jail policy (Policy II) did not go into effect until November 4, 2013, after receiving the plaintiff’s first complaint. Further, the policy provided no clear procedure regarding magazines, the “mail rejection” section remained identical to Policy I and violated senders’ due process rights, and the “mail collection and delivery” section violates both sender and recipient due process rights. Defendants filed their answer and response to the motion for preliminary injunction on April 10, 2015. In the answer and response, the defendants argued that the new policy that went into effect on April 9, 2015 (Policy III), addressed the plaintiff’s remaining concerns and rendered the plaintiff’s argument moot. The plaintiff filed another response and supplemental brief on June 4, 2015. </p><p>The plaintiff renewed its motion for preliminary injunction on June 19, 2015. On June 24, 2015, the defendants filed a motion to strike, on grounds that the renewed preliminary injunction did not fairly comply with local rules and unfairly imposed on the time and resources of the defendants. Additionally, the defendants argued the plaintiff lacked standing to sue on behalf of prisoners.  On March 16, 2016, Judge Greer granted the defendant’s motion to strike and granted the plaintiff motion for preliminary injunction filed on March 26, 2015.  The Court determined that the plaintiff did have standing to sue on behalf of prisoners because they both shared common constitutional interests. A jury trial was set for August 15, 2017, however, both parties reached an agreement on July 18, 2016. Both parties agreed to settle the case on grounds that the defendants pay $50,000.00 in damages and attorney’s fees. On July 21, 2016, the Court Clerk filed an offer of judgment in favor of the plaintiff. On August 11, 2016, the plaintiff filed a satisfaction of judgment notice. The case is closed. </p><p></p>",

WAYNE ANDERSON, in his official and   ) \nindividual capacity,          ) \n              ) \n    Defendants.        ) \n \nORDER \n \n  The plaintiff, Prison Legal News (“PLN”), filed this section 1983 action and alleged \nviolations under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  It seeks damages and declaratory and \ninjunctive relief.  [Doc. 1].  PLN also filed its first Motion for Preliminary Injunction, [Doc. 4], \nand sought to enjoin the defendants from enforcing their October 14, 2011 postcards-only mail \npolicy and order them “to afford Plaintiff, prisoners, and correspondents due process notice and \nan opportunity to challenge Defendants’ censorship decisions.”  [Doc. 5 at 2].  The Court denied \nthis motion and held that the First Amendment issue regarding the postcards-only mail policy \nwas moot, [Doc. 24].  Because the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process issue was not properly \nbefore the Court, the Court gave the plaintiff ten days to amend its Complaint.  The Court further \nstated that once filed, the plaintiff could move for a preliminary injunction on the Fourteenth \nAmendment issue.  The plaintiff filed such motion, [Doc. 26], and a renewed motion, [Doc. 36].  \nCase 2:13-cv-00266-JRG-MCLC   Document 40   Filed 03/16/16   Page 1 of 9   PageID #: 536\n\nFor the reasons that follow, the motion, [Doc. 26], is GRANTED.  The Court will elaborate on \nthose reasons after addressing several preliminary issues. \nI.  BACKGROUND   \nThe facts of the case are set forth in this Court’s March 26, 2015 Order, [Doc. 24].  The \nadditional facts are as follows.  The Court decided in the prior Order (1) whether to enjoin the \npostcards-only portion of Policy I because it violates the First Amendment; and (2) whether to \nenjoin the jail to establish due process procedures regarding censorship because Policy I’s \nprocedures violate the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Court determined that the first issue was \nmoot for the defendants changed Policy I to Policy II prior to receiving a summons in the case, \neffectively  and  unambiguously  abandoning  the  postcards-only  policy  after  substantial \ndeliberation and sworn statements affirming there would be no return to the postcards-only \npolicy.  As to the second issue, the Court allowed the plaintiff ten days to amend its Complaint to \nproperly bring the Fourteenth Amendment issue of Policy II before the Court. \nOn March 26, 2016, the plaintiff filed a Motion to Amend the Complaint, [Doc. 25], and \nthe instant Motion for Preliminary Injunction, [Doc. 26].  The next day, the Court granted the \nMotion to Amend, [Doc. 28], and the Amended Complaint was filed, [Doc. 29].  The defendants \nfiled an Answer, [Doc. 30], and a Response to the Motion for Preliminary Injunction, [Doc. 31], \non April 10, 2015.  In the Answer and Response, the defendants gave notice that they had since \nchanged Policy II and implemented Policy III on April 9, 2015.  Policy III addressed the \nplaintiff’s remaining concerns.  The plaintiff filed a Reply on April 16, 2015, [Doc. 34], and a \nsupplemental brief on June 4, 2015, [Doc. 35].  Then, on June 19, 2015, the plaintiff filed a \n“Renewed Motion for Preliminary Injunction,” [Doc. 36].  The plaintiff moves for a preliminary \ninjunction as to Policy II essentially on the same grounds previously raised and does not claim \n2 \n \nCase 2:13-cv-00266-JRG-MCLC   Document 40   Filed 03/16/16   Page 2 of 9   PageID #: 537\n\nthat Policy III violates its constitutional rights.  The defendants responded and also moved to \nstrike this motion on June 24, 2015, [Doc. 38]. \nII.  Analysis \n  First, the plaintiff argues that the defendants’ response was filed too late.  The defendants \nrespond that the plaintiff’s motion was actually filed prematurely and, thus, their response was \non time.  It is true that the plaintiff filed the motion prior to the Court granting their request to \nfile the Amended Complaint.  It is also true that the defendants filed their response to the motion \non the 15th day instead of the 14th.  However, because of what is commonly referred to as the \nmailbox rule, the motion is not untimely. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(d). \n  Second, the defendants have moved to strike the “Renewed Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction,” [Doc. 36], for it does not comport to the Local Rules and unfairly imposes on the \ntime and resources of the defendants.  See E.D. Tenn. L.R. 7.1.  The plaintiff argues that it is \nproper because the defendants enacted Policy III, and the defendants have not satisfied their \nburden in moving to strike.  The Court agrees with the defendants.  The plaintiff already had the \nmotion properly before the Court.  To be sure, the renewed motion raises essentially the same \narguments; some sections of the memorandum in support contain exact language that was filed \npreviously.  It never argues that Policy III violates its constitutional rights.  Instead, it argues that \nPolicy II is not moot because of the filing of Policy III.  This issue was already before the Court.  \nThe Motion to Strike is GRANTED. \n  Third, the defendants argue that the plaintiff does not have standing to sue on behalf of \nprisoners. Similarly, the defendants argue that it is alleged that only two subscriber inmates \nfailed to receive publications to which they subscribed.  Thus, they argue that the Sixth Circuit \n3 \n \nCase 2:13-cv-00266-JRG-MCLC   Document 40   Filed 03/16/16   Page 3 of 9   PageID #: 538\n\nhas not found a constitutional right of a publisher to mail unsolicited publications to prison \ninmates.   \nThe Amended Complaint only names PLN as the plaintiff.  It does, however, give \nexamples  of  specific  inmates  and  alleges  that  the  specific  inmate  did  not  receive  certain \npublications.  Further, it alleges that the defendants did not provide the prisoners due process or \nan opportunity to appeal any alleged censorship decisions.  In addition, the plaintiff alleges in the \nAmended Complaint that the facts described in the Amended Complaint constitute violations of \nthe  plaintiff’s  rights,  the  rights  of  correspondents  who  have  attempted  or  who  intend  to \ncorrespond  with  prisoners,  and  the  rights  of  the  prisoners  under  the  First  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments.     \n  Standing is a threshold issue that must be determined before the Court may consider any \nsubstantive  issues.  Planned  Parenthood  Assoc.  v.  Cincinnati,  822  F.2d  1390,  1394  (6th \nCir.1987). Article III standing requires that (1) plaintiff suffered an “injury in fact, which is both \nconcrete and particularized, and actual or imminent;” (2) there is a causal connection between \nthe injury and complained of activity such that it is fairly traceable to the defendant’s actions; \nand (3) it is likely, not speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision. \nLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992). The party seeking to be heard in \nfederal  court  must  prove  each  element  of  standing  with  specificity. Coyne  ex  rel.  Ohio  v. \nAmerican Tobacco Co., 183 F.3d 488, 494 (6th Cir.1999). \nPublishers and inmates have a First Amendment interest in communicating with one \nanother subject to regulation that furthers legitimate penological interests. See Thornburgh v. \nAbbott,  490  U.S.  401,  407  (1987).  “The  interest  of  prisoners  and  their  correspondents  in \nuncensored communication by letter, grounded as it is in the First Amendment, is plainly a \n4 \n \nCase 2:13-cv-00266-JRG-MCLC   Document 40   Filed 03/16/16   Page 4 of 9   PageID #: 539\n\n‘liberty’ interest within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment even though qualified of \nnecessity by the circumstance of imprisonment.”  Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 418 \n(1974).  This liberty interest applies to both senders and receivers.  Id. at 408-08.  Moreover, the \nSixth Circuit has determined that prison officials must provide minimal procedural safeguards \nfor confiscation of inmate mail.  Martin v. Kelley, 803 F.2d 236, 241-42 (6th cir. 1986).  Finally, \n“[c]ommunication between inmates and non-inmates is protected regardless of who initiates the \ncommunication.”  Prison Legal News v. Bezott, No. 11-CV-13460, 2014 WL 1405214, at *3 \n(E.D. Mich. Apr. 11, 2014); see also Prison Legal News v. Livingston, 683 F.3d 201, 212–13 \n(5th Cir. 2012). \nPLN alleges that the defendants censored its attempted communications with the inmates \nin violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Based on the allegations contained in the \nAmended Complaint, this Court finds that PLN has carried its burden and concludes PLN has \nstanding.  See id.  \nFourth, the defendants argue that the Court should not issue a preliminary injunction on \nthis alleged Fourteenth Amendment violation issue because it is moot.  They claim that the filing \nof Policy III, which satisfies Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process, renders claims over \nPolicy II moot.  The plaintiff argues the issue is not moot because this situation fits within the \nvoluntary cessation exception to the mootness doctrine. \nAt the time a federal court decides a case, there must be a live case or controversy, Burke \nv. Barnes, 479 U.S. 361, 363 (1987); otherwise, the mootness doctrine applies.  Ky. Right to Life, \nInc. v. Terry, 108 F.3d 637, 644 (6th Cir. 1997).  “The mootness doctrine [is] a subset of the \nArticle III justiciability requirements.”  Id.  “Claims become moot when the issues presented are \nno longer ‘live’ or parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.” Brandywine, Inc. v. \n5 \n \nCase 2:13-cv-00266-JRG-MCLC   Document 40   Filed 03/16/16   Page 5 of 9   PageID #: 540\n\nCity of Richmond, Ky., 359 F.3d 830, 836 (6th Cir. 2004).  “The test for mootness is whether the \nrelief sought would, if granted, make a difference to the legal interests of the parties.”  Bowman \nv. Corrections Corp. of America, 350 F.3d 537, 549-550 (6th Cir. 2003) (quoting McPherson v. \nMichigan High Sch. Athletic Ass'n, Inc., 119 F.3d 453, 458 (6th Cir. 1997) (en banc)) (internal \nquotations  and  citations  omitted).    Moreover,  a  federal  court  “can  neither  declare \nunconstitutional  nor  enjoin  the  enforcement  of  a  provision  that  is  no  longer  in  effect.” \nBrandywine, 359 F.3d at 836 (plaintiffs’ claims for declaratory and injunctive relief mooted \nwhen city repealed allegedly unconstitutional provision of ordinance); Bench Billboard Co. v. \nCity of Cincinnati, 675 F.3d 974 (6th Cir. 2012) (plaintiff's claims for injunctive and declaratory \nrelief mooted by amended code sections to ordinance). \nUnder the voluntary cessation exception, a case may be mooted only “if subsequent \nevents made it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be \nexpected to recur,” Friends of the Earth Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, \n189 (2000) (quoting United States v. Concentrated Phosphate Export Ass'n, Inc., 393 U.S. 199, \n203 (1968)), and “interim relief or events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects \nof the alleged violation.” County of Los Angeles v. Davis, 440 U.S. 625, 631 (1979). The heavy \nburden of demonstrating mootness rests on the party claiming mootness. Friends of the Earth, \n528 U.S. at 189. However, “cessation of the allegedly illegal conduct by government officials \nhas been treated with more solicitude by the courts than similar action by private parties.” \nAmmex, Inc. v. Cox, 351 F.3d 697, 705 (6th Cir. 2003) (quoting Mosley v. Hairston, 920 F.2d \n409, 415 (6th Cir.1990) (internal quotation marks omitted)). \n  As this Court stated in its previous Order, a court considers three factors in determining \nwhether the defendants have carried their burden of mootness:  (1) unambiguous change, (2) \n6 \n \nCase 2:13-cv-00266-JRG-MCLC   Document 40   Filed 03/16/16   Page 6 of 9   PageID #: 541\n\nchange as a result of substantial deliberation, and (3) consistent application of new policy or \nadherence to new conduct.  See Prison Legal News v. Chapman, -- F.Supp.2d --, No. 3:12-CV-\n00125, 2014 WL 4247772, at *11 (M.D. Ga. Aug. 26, 2014) (citing Doe v. Wooten, 747 F.3d \n1317, 1322 (11th Cir. 2014).  The Court previously ruled that the defendants met this burden in \nrelation to the postcards-only portion of Policy II, rending that issue moot.  The facts on this \nissue, however, differ. \n  The defendants made an unambiguous change and brought their policy, Policy III, into \ncompliance with the principles set forth in Martin v. Kelley, 803 F.2d at 236, and the Due \nProcess Clause.  The plaintiff does not argue otherwise.  However, this change was made during \nthe heat of litigation.  This differs from the first change on the postcards-only policy which was \nmade prior to the defendants being served with the summons and Complaint. Here, unlike \nbefore, there is no evidence of substantial deliberation.  There are no affidavits from the jail \nadministrators affirming there is no intention of returning to the prior policy or one that does not \nadequately provide the minimum procedural safeguards.   \n  It is true that there have been no complaints that Policy III has not been consistently \napplied.  Nonetheless, the facts mentioned above, which differ from the facts surrounding this \nCourt’s  previous  decision,  do  not  satisfy  the  defendants’  heavy  burden  of  demonstrating \nmootness.  As such, the Court will address the merits of the plaintiff’s arguments.1 \n                                                 \n1 This Court notes the defendants’ arguments that neither the plaintiff nor any inmates have ever filed a complaint \nwith the jail for censorship or not receiving PLN’s publications.  It appears from the facts that PLN was aware of \nreturned mail from the defendants as early as February 2012.  The defendants argue that despite this knowledge, \nPLN never complained to the defendants to try to remedy the situation.  Instead, PLN resorted to filing this lawsuit \non October 10, 2013.  This Court further notes the defendants’ good faith efforts in amending its policies to address \nall of the plaintiff’s grievances.  This Court finds that the defendants’ did so in a timely manner, despite the \nplaintiff’s arguments to the contrary.   \n  To be sure, violations of constitutional rights are extremely serious.  Nonetheless, it appears to the Court \nthat this litigation could have been avoided entirely by communication between the two parties prior to filing any \nsuit.  This could have saved tremendous time and resources for both parties, especially considering the condition of \ncounty budgets in this day and time.  The inmates, whose interests PLN asserts it seeks to protect, may have been \n7 \n \nCase 2:13-cv-00266-JRG-MCLC   Document 40   Filed 03/16/16   Page 7 of 9   PageID #: 542\n\n  PLN moves the Court “to enter a preliminary injunction enjoining Defendants from \nfailing to provide Plaintiff and others corresponding with prisoners procedural safeguards that \ncomply with due process.”  [Doc. 26]. \nPolicy II states in pertinent part: \n. . . . \n \nB. A prisoner will be notified in writing if any mail is rejected. \n \nC. The inmate will have a chance to appeal this rejection; by filing \na grievance with the commissary officer. \n \nD. If the inmate is no longer in our custody the officer will mark \nout our address, mark \"not at this address\" and stamp \"return to \nsender\" and place back in the mail. \n \n[Doc. 15-3, pg. 2].  This Court previously concluded that this policy was facially deficient and \nstated that the defendants could choose to implement a new policy which complies with Martin.  \nThe defendants did so, and the plaintiff does not raise an issue with Policy III.  However, the \nfocus must be on Policy II. \n  The Court must consider four factors in determining whether to grant a preliminary \ninjunction: \n(1) whether the plaintiffs have a strong likelihood of success on the \nmerits; \n \n(2)  whether,  without  the  injunction,  the  plaintiffs  will  suffer \nirreparable harm; \n \n(3) whether issuance of the injunction will cause substantial harm \nto the defendant or others; and  \n \n                                                                                                                                                             \nbetter off if the resources of the County were spent on their care instead of spent on litigation expenses on a case \nwhich could have been avoided, considering the defendants’ efforts to comply with and remedy all of plaintiff’s \ngrievances.  That being said, this Court notes these arguments but, of course, confines its decision strictly to the \napplicable law.  Perhaps common sense, cooperation and communication prior to filing suit are practices of a by-\ngone era.   \n8 \n \nCase 2:13-cv-00266-JRG-MCLC   Document 40   Filed 03/16/16   Page 8 of 9   PageID #: 543\n\n(4) whether the public interest would be served by the issuance of a \npreliminary injunction. \n \nUnited Food and Commercial Workers Union v. Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority, 163 \nF.3d 341, 347 (6th Cir. 1998).  These factors are not prerequisites to the issuance of an injunction \nbut are factors to be balanced in considering whether to grant the injunction. Id.  The Court finds \nthat the factors weigh in favor of the plaintiff.  In so doing, the Court finds the reasoning in \nPrison Legal News v. County of San Diego, No. 3:14-cv-2417-L-NLS, (S.D. Cal. May 7, 2015), \nand Lane v. Lombardi, No. 2:12-cv-4219-NKL, 2012 WL 5873577, at * 2-6 (W.D. Mo. Nov. 15, \n2012), persuasive.   \n  For the reasons stated above, the motion to strike the renewed motion, [Doc. 36], is \nGRANTED.  In addition, the Motion for Preliminary Injunction, [Doc. 26], is GRANTED.  That \nbeing said, it appears that Policy III satisfies the requirements, and it has already been enacted \nand is being followed.  The parties shall file a Rule 26(f) report with this Court within 10 days \nfrom the entry of this Order, and then the matter will be set for trial. \n  ENTER: \n \n \n    s/J.

Plaintiff, Prison Legal News, a project of the Human Rights Defense Center, \nbrings this action to enjoin Defendants’ censorship of Prison Legal News’ monthly publication \nand correspondence mailed to prisoners who are held in custody at the Sullivan County Jail, in \nviolation of the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. \nDefendants have adopted and implemented written mail policies and practices that violate the \nFirst Amendment by unconstitutionally restricting correspondence to prisoners to postcards only, \nand that prohibit delivery of book catalogs and magazines to prisoners. Further, Defendants’ \npolicies and practices do not afford Prison Legal News due process, including notice and an \nopportunity to challenge the censorship, as required by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution.  \nPage 1 of 14 \n \nCase 2:13-cv-00266-JRG-MCLC   Document 1   Filed 10/10/13   Page 1 of 14   PageID #: 1\n\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n2.

On information and belief, Defendants censoreded and refused to deliver the \nPrison Legal News journals and the books that PLN sent to prisoner-addressees, and continues to \ncensor these monthly journals and books to this day. For example, on or about February 15, \n2012, PLN personally addressed and mailed a copy of the book Protecting Your Health & Safety  \nto prisoner Clovis Jones at the Sullivan County Jail. Mr. Jones was a prisoner at the Sullivan \nCounty Jail at the time that the Jail received the book from PLN.

On or about March 15, 2012, PLN mailed the March 2012 issue of the journal \nPrison Legal News addressed individually to prisoner Jeffery Gragg at the Sullivan County Jail. \nMr. Gragg was a prisoner at the Sullivan County Jail at the time that the Jail received the April \nPrison Legal News publication from PLN.

Each month from October  2012 to the present PLN has mailed approximately ten \ncopies of its monthly journal Prison Legal News individually addressed to approximately ten \nseparate prisoners at the Sullivan County Jail, each of whom was a prisoner of the Jail at the time \nthe Jail received the Prison Legal News publication from PLN.   On information and belief, none \nof these monthly journals were delivered to the intended recipients, but these journals were \ninstead censored by jail staff persons. \n22.  Additionally, PLN mailed 12 copies of the book Protecting Your Health & Safety \nto 12 separate prisoners at the Sullivan County Jail from on or about October 18, 2012 to the \npresent.

On or about October 22, 2012, PLN mailed its annual fundraiser letter to 14 \nseparate prisoners at the Sullivan County jail.  On information and belief, none of these 14 letters \nwere delivered to their intended recipients who were prisoners at the jail but were instead \ncensored by jail staff persons. \n25.  Defendants did not provide PLN notice or an opportunity to appeal any of the \naforementioned censorship decisions.  \n26.  Defendants did not provide the prisoner-addressees due process, including notice \nor an opportunity to appeal any of the aforementioned censorship decisions. \n27.  PLN intends to continue its mission to promote public safety through educational \nand journalistic avenues by sending its monthly journal, copies of books, and letters to prisoners \nat the Sullivan County Jail in the future. \nInformational Brochures, Subscription Order Forms, Book Catalogs \n28.

Collectively, the PLN Brochure, Book List, and Book Offer described above in \nparagraphs 29 through 31 are referred to as “Informational Brochure Packs” below.  \n33.  From on or about February 15, 2012 to May 15, 2013, Prison Legal News mailed \n46 individually addressed Informational Brochure Packs  to 46 separate prisoners at the Sullivan \nCounty Jail, each of whom was a prisoner in the Sullivan County Jail at the time the Jail received \nthe Informational Brochure Packs. \n34.  On information and belief, Defendants rejected each Informational Brochure Pack \nsent by PLN and did not deliver them to the prisoner-addressees. \nPage 8 of 14 \n \nCase 2:13-cv-00266-JRG-MCLC   Document 1   Filed 10/10/13   Page 8 of 14   PageID #: 8\n\n35.  For the Informational Brochure Packs that Defendants returned to Prison Legal \nNews, Defendants simply wrote “RTS” or sometimes “not here.”  \n36.  For example, PLN sent Ahmad Abdul-Khaaliq such a brochure pack in a \nstandard, white envelope on December 19, 2012, but Jail employees marked “not here” and \n“RTS” and caused the brochures to be returned to PLN. Mr. Abdul-Khaaliq never received his \nmail from PLN even though he was a prisoner at the Sullivan County Jail at the time that the \nmail arrived at the jail. \n37.  On or about February 16, 2012, PLN mailed an Informational Brochure Packet \naddressed to prisoner Donald Wilcox at the Sullivan County Jail. Mr. Wilcox was a prisoner at \nthe Sullivan County Jail at the time that the Jail received the packet from PLN. The Jail returned \nthe mail to PLN without separate notification. \n38.  Inmate Nicholas Hillis requested PLN’s materials in January 2013. PLN sent Mr. \nHillis an initial mailing including Protecting Your Health and Safety and other sample and \ninformational materials in April 2013. Mr. Hillis’s copy of Protecting Your Health and Safety \nnever reached him. \n39.  Inmate Ryan Davis requested materials from PLN on or about April 30, 2012. \n40.  PLN mailed an Informational Brochure Packet to Mr. Davis, along with a sample \ncopy of Prison Legal News, in June 2012. Mr. Davis received some materials, but he has not \nreceived his monthly gift subscription to Prison Legal News. \n41.  Defendants did not provide PLN due process notice or an opportunity to appeal \nthe censorship decisions for any of the censored mail described in this complaint. \n42.  Likewise, Defendants did not provide the prisoner-addressees notice or an \nopportunity to appeal the censorship decisions for any of the mail described in this complaint.  \nPage 9 of 14 \n \nCase 2:13-cv-00266-JRG-MCLC   Document 1   Filed 10/10/13   Page 9 of 14   PageID #: 9\n\n43.  The Defendants failed to provide due process, including notice and an opportunity \nto be heard, to PLN and the prisoner-addressees. \n44.  Prison Legal News intends to continue sending Informational Brochure Packs to \nprisoners at the Sullivan County Jail in the future. \nJAIL POLICIES \n45.  On October 14, 2011 the Sullivan County Jail, on the orders of Defendant J. \nWayne Anderson, promulgated and implemented a new policy governing mail to prisoners. A \ntrue copy of the policy is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit A. \n46.  The Jail’s Postcard-Only Mail Policy states, in pertinent part: \n    As a general rule, incoming mail shall be limited to the Following: \n    1. Standard postcard, of which the minimum size is 3.5 x 4.25, and maximum size  \n    8.5 x 11. \n2. Postcards must be white in color front and back. \n \n47.  The Postcard-Only Mail Policy also states, “If any items are received in the mail \nother than postcards, (ex. Stamps. envelopes) the mail will be returned to sender.” \n48.  Defendants have used their Postcard-Only Mail Policy to censor Plaintiff’s Prison \nLegal News journal, Informational Brochure Packs, Renewal Brochure Packs, Fundraising Packs, \nonline articles, and other correspondence. \n49.  Defendants’ Postcard-Only Mail Policy and their practice of enforcing this policy \nunconstitutionally burdens Plaintiff’s First Amendment rights, the First Amendment rights of \nother correspondents who send mail to prisoners confined at the Sullivan County Jail, the First \nAmendment rights of the intended recipients of outgoing mail from prisoners confined at the \nSullivan County Jail, and the First Amendment rights of prisoners at the Sullivan County Jail. \n50.  Additionally, Defendants maintain a policy and practice of permitting other \nmagazines into the Jail. \nPage 10 of 14 \n \nCase 2:13-cv-00266-JRG-MCLC   Document 1   Filed 10/10/13   Page 10 of 14   PageID #: 10\n\n51.  Specifically, Defendants allow inmates access to O Magazine, Men’s Journal, \nGlamour, Outdoor Life, Field & Stream, Hot Rod, Us, and Star magazines. (Exhibit A at 8). \n52.  Defendant Anderson and other agents of Sullivan County are responsible for or \npersonally participated in creating and implementing these unconstitutional policies, practices, \nand customs, and for training and supervising the mail staff members whose conduct also has \ninjured and continue to injure Plaintiff and others, or ratified or adopted the policies or actions \ndescribed herein. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \nVIOLATION OF THE FIRST AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS TO THE UNITED STATES \nCONSTITUTION \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n \n53.

The magazines accessible to inmates are on a range of entertainment, gossip, \nlifestyle, and sports topics. By permitting access to periodicals such as O Magazine, Field and \nStream, and Outdoor Life, while banning access to core political speech such as PLN’s monthly \nmagazine, Defendants engaged in unlawful discrimination based on content. \n64.

It seeks damages and \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief.  [Doc. 1].  PLN also filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction, \n[Doc. 4].  It seeks to enjoin the defendants from enforcing their October 14, 2011 postcards-only \nmail policy and order them “to afford Plaintiff, prisoners, and correspondents due process notice \nand  an  opportunity  to  challenge  Defendants’  censorship  decisions.”    [Doc.  5,  pg.2].    The \ndefendants have responded that the matter is moot.  [Doc. 13].  Several other replies and \nsupplements have since been filed, [Docs. 19, 21, 22, and 23].  The matter is ripe for review.  For \nthe reasons that follow, the motion is DENIED.   \nI.  Background \n  The Human Rights Defense Center, a nonprofit organization, publishes Prison Legal \nNews (“PLN”), a monthly magazine that provides information about legal news, prisoner rights, \nCase 2:13-cv-00266-JRG-MCLC   Document 24   Filed 03/26/15   Page 1 of 11   PageID #: 296\n\nand other prison-related issues.  PLN sends its subscribers these monthly issues.  It also sends \nsubscription renewal letters, informational brochures, book catalogs, and paperback books. PLN \ndistributes these publications and correspondence inside prisons to carry out its mission “to \npromote public safety through educational and journalistic avenues.” [Doc. 1, ¶ 27].   \n  Defendant Sullivan County, by and through the Sullivan County Sheriff’s Office and \nSheriff J. Wayne Anderson, (“defendants”) implemented a postcards-only mail policy (“Policy \nI”) for the Sullivan County Jail (the “jail”) on October 14, 2011.  [Doc. 15-1].  Section IV. of \nPolicy I addressed mail rejection.  Policy I is silent as to what specific magazines may be \ndelivered to or accessed by the inmates.  However, the jail’s commissary permits inmates to \naccess eight different pre-selected periodicals.  [Doc. 5-9].   \n  PLN alleges that under Policy I, the jail censored its mailings starting in February 2012.  \nIn so doing, the jail returned only some of them to PLS.  The mailings contained notations such \nas “RTS” or “Not Here.”  On some items that were returned, jail staff wrote “Post Cards Only! \nCan Not Have,” only to then mark it out and write “RTS” or “Not Here.”  For some of these \nreturned mailings, which noted “RTS” or “Not Here,” PLN had confirmed the inmate’s presence \nin the jail.  The jail allegedly stock-piled some undelivered copies of PLN’s mail in the jail \nmajor’s office.  [Doc. 5-2, ¶ 20].   \n  As a result of this “censorship,” PLN filed suit on October 10, 2013.  Specifically, PLN \nalleges the following:  (1) “violations of Plaintiff’s rights, the rights of other correspondents who \nhave attempted to or intend to correspond with prisoners at the Sullivan County Jail, and the \nrights of prisoners confined at the Sullivan County Jail, under the First Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution, through 42 U.S.C. § 1983,” [Doc. 1, ¶ 54]; (2) “violations of Plaintiff’s \nrights, and rights of other correspondents who have attempted to or intend to correspond with \n2 \n \nCase 2:13-cv-00266-JRG-MCLC   Document 24   Filed 03/26/15   Page 2 of 11   PageID #: 297\n\nprisoners at the Sullivan County Jail, and the rights of prisoners confined at the Sullivan County \nJail, under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution through 42 U.S.C. § \n1983,” [Doc. 1, ¶ 58]; and (3) violation of the First Amendment “by permitting access to \nperiodicals such as O Magazine, Field and Stream, and Outdoor Life, while banning access to \ncore  political  speech  such  as  PLN’s  monthly  magazine,  .  .  .  engag[ing]  in  unlawful \ndiscrimination based on content,” [Doc. 1, ¶ 63]. \n  On October 24 2013, the Tennessee Corrections Institute (“TCI”) inspected the jail and \nrecommended the jail abandon the postcards-only policy and return to regular mail.  [Doc. 15, \npg. 3, ¶ 13].  According to Corrections Major Greg Simcox, who is the overseer of the jail, he \nbegan the process to eliminate Policy I for incoming inmate mail.  [Doc. 15, pg. 3, ¶ 14].  This \nprocess began before the summons in this case was issued on October 29, 2013, [Doc. 3].  Jail \nstaff distributed a memo to the inmates, informing them of the planned return to regular mail.  \n[Doc. 15, pg. 3, ¶ 16; Doc. 15-2].   The new mail policy (“Policy II”) went into effect on \nNovember 4, 2013.  [Doc. 17, pg. 3, ¶ 16; Doc. 15-3].  It abandoned the postcards-only policy \nand returned to regular mail.  [Doc. 15-3].  Section IV. regarding “Mail Rejection” remained \nunchanged.  Policy II also remained silent as to magazines.  \nFinally, Major Simcox stated in his sworn affidavit that regardless of which policy was in \nplace, the jail never had a policy to intercept PLN’s mail and stop it from being delivered to the \ninmate to whom it was addressed.  [Doc. 15, pg. 4, ¶ 20].  Major Simcox also stated that the jail \nhas allowed, and continues to allow, delivery of all of PLN’s mailings to the inmate to whom it \nwas addressed.  [Doc. 15, pg. 4, ¶ 20]. \n  As stated above, PLN has moved for a preliminary injunction.  In the motion PLN \n“moves  this  honorable  Court  to  enter  a  preliminary  injunction  enjoining  Defendants  from \n3 \n \nCase 2:13-cv-00266-JRG-MCLC   Document 24   Filed 03/26/15   Page 3 of 11   PageID #: 298\n\nenforcing their post-cards only mail censoring Plaintiff’s publications.”  [Doc. 4, pg. 1].  PLN \nstates in its Memorandum , “Because [Policy I], violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments to \nthe United States Constitution, PLN respectfully moves this Court for an order preliminarily \nenjoining Defendants as follows: (1) from enforcing its unconstitutional jail mail policies to \nreject or otherwise censor news journals, subscription materials, book offers, book catalogs, and \nother  correspondence;  and  (2)  ordering  Defendants  to  afford  Plaintiff,  prisoners,  and  other \ncorrespondents  due  process  notice  and  an  opportunity  to  challenge  Defendants’  censorship \ndecisions.” [Doc. 5, pgs. 1-2].  It was somewhat difficult to discern PLN’s specific arguments \nbecause of inconsistencies between PLN’s Complaint [Doc. 1], the Motion, [Doc. 4], and the \nMemorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction, [Doc. 5].  To \nbe sure, however, the motion seeks a preliminary injunction on the postcards-only portion of \nPolicy I, and the Memorandum goes beyond that and seeks one regarding a due process issue.  \nTo complicate matters further, parts of the Memorandum and subsequent filings seem to seek a \npreliminary injunction to enjoin an unwritten policy regarding access to magazines because it \nviolates the First Amendment, see [Doc. 1, pg. 10, ¶ 50].  However, PLN did not clearly seek an \ninjunction as to this issue. \nThis Court concludes that the only issue properly before the Court is the postcards-only \nissue of Policy I.  Nonetheless, the Court will briefly address the due process issue but declines \nto address the unwritten magazine policy.  As such, the Court will specifically decide:  (1) \nwhether to enjoin the postcards-only portion of Policy I because it violates the First Amendment; \nand (2) whether to enjoin the jail to establish due process procedures regarding censorship \nbecause Policy I’s procedures violate the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Court will discuss each \nin turn. \n4 \n \nCase 2:13-cv-00266-JRG-MCLC   Document 24   Filed 03/26/15   Page 4 of 11   PageID #: 299\n\nII.  Postcards-Only Portion of Policy I \n  Again, PLN seeks to enjoin the postcards-only portion of Policy I because it violates the \nFirst Amendment.  However, the defendants abandoned the postcards-only policy and returned to \na regular-mail policy in Policy II.  Therefore, the defendants argue that this issue is moot.  Before \nreaching the merits of the preliminary injunction on this issue, this Court must decide if the \nmatter is moot.   \n  At the time a federal court decides a case, there must be a live case or controversy, Burke \nv. Barnes, 479 U.S. 361, 363 (1987); otherwise, the mootness doctrine applies.  Ky. Right to Life, \nInc. v. Terry, 108 F.3d 637, 644 (6th Cir. 1997).  “The mootness doctrine [is] a subset of the \nArticle III justiciability requirements.”  Id.  “Claims become moot when the issues presented are \nno longer ‘live’ or parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.” Brandywine, Inc. v. \nCity of Richmond, Ky., 359 F.3d 830, 836 (6th Cir. 2004).  “The test for mootness is whether the \nrelief sought would, if granted, make a difference to the legal interests of the parties.”  Bowman \nv. Corrections Corp. of America, 350 F.3d 537, 549-550 (6th Cir. 2003) (quoting McPherson v. \nMichigan High Sch. Athletic Ass'n, Inc., 119 F.3d 453, 458 (6th Cir. 1997) (en banc)) (internal \nquotations  and  citations  omitted).    Moreover,  a  federal  court  “can  neither  declare \nunconstitutional  nor  enjoin  the  enforcement  of  a  provision  that  is  no  longer  in  effect.” \nBrandywine, 359 F.3d at 836 (plaintiffs’ claims for declaratory and injunctive relief mooted \nwhen city repealed allegedly unconstitutional provision of ordinance); Bench Billboard Co. v. \nCity of Cincinnati, 675 F.3d 974 (6th Cir. 2012) (plaintiff's claims for injunctive and declaratory \nrelief mooted by amended code sections to ordinance). \n  PLN argues that the voluntary cessation exception to the mootness doctrine applies.  \nUnder this exception, a case may be mooted only “if subsequent events made it absolutely clear \n5 \n \nCase 2:13-cv-00266-JRG-MCLC   Document 24   Filed 03/26/15   Page 5 of 11   PageID #: 300\n\nthat the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur,” Friends of the \nEarth Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189 (2000) (quoting United States \nv. Concentrated Phosphate Export Ass'n, Inc., 393 U.S. 199, 203 (1968)), and “interim relief or \nevents have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation.” County of \nLos Angeles v. Davis, 440 U.S. 625, 631 (1979). The heavy burden of demonstrating mootness \nrests on the party claiming mootness. Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 189. However, “cessation \nof the allegedly illegal conduct by government officials has been treated with more solicitude by \nthe courts than similar action by private parties.” Ammex, Inc. v. Cox, 351 F.3d 697, 705 (6th Cir. \n2003) (quoting Mosley v. Hairston, 920 F.2d 409, 415 (6th Cir.1990) (internal quotation marks \nomitted)). \n  Here, there was an unambiguous change in Policy I.  See Prison Legal News v. Chapman, \n-- F.Supp.2d --, No. 3:12-CV-00125, 2014 WL 4247772, at *11 (M.D. Ga. Aug. 26, 2014) \n(citing Doe v. Wooten, 747 F.3d 1317, 1322 (11th Cir. 2014), which lists three factors a court \nconsiders in determining whether the government has carried its burden  of  mootness:    (1) \nunambiguous change, (2) change result of substantial deliberation, and (3) consistent application \nof new policy or adherence to new conduct) (Chapman II).  The postcards-only policy was \nclearly abandoned when Policy II was implemented.  This change seemed to be as a result of \nsubstantial deliberation, for Major Simcox, the jail overseer, discussed the policy with the TCI \nafter the TCI completed an inspection of the jail.  See id.  The policy was then changed after \nheeding TCI’s advice.  Major Simcox began implementing this change in the postcards-only \npolicy prior to this Court issuing the summons in this case.  Thus, it does not appear that the \nchange was made to merely avoid this Court’s jurisdiction.  See id. (asserting the timing of the \nchange is another consideration).  Moreover, there is no evidence in the record that the jail has \n6 \n \nCase 2:13-cv-00266-JRG-MCLC   Document 24   Filed 03/26/15   Page 6 of 11   PageID #: 301\n\nfailed to consistently apply this new policy or to adhere to this new course of conduct.  See id.  \nFinally, Major Simcox stated in his sworn affidavit that the jail had no intention of returning to \nthe postcards-only policy.  See Ammex, 351 F.3d at 705 (discussing Picrin-Peron v. Rison, 930 \nF.2d 773, 775-76 (9th Cir. 1991), where sworn statement of INS official regarding a change was \nsufficient for government to carry the burden of mootness).   \nTo  be  sure,  the  Court  has  considered  PLN’s  argument  regarding  changes  made  by \nlegislative bodies versus executive actors.  The argument is without merit.  The cases cited by \nPLN for support do not clearly support PLN’s position, although they do discuss the voluntary \ncessation exception in terms of the legislative action.   See [Doc. 23, pgs. 2-3].  Instead, this \nCourt relies upon the per curiam opinion in Northern Ohio Chapter of Associated Builders & \nContractors, Inc., v. Metrohealth System, 280 Fed. App’x 464, 466-67 (6th Cir. 2008).  In that \nopinion, the Sixth Circuit summarizes several cases dealing with the mootness issue after a \nvoluntary change in policies or laws.  Id.  Ultimately, the court found claims moot even though \nthe policy had been changed by the Board of Trustees of a public teaching hospital.  Id. at 467.  \nThus, the court applied the exception even though the change did not come from a legislative \nbody. \nAs  noted  above,  the  Court  has  considered  the  cases  cited  by  PLN  and  finds  these \nnonbinding  authorities  distinguishable.    PLN  relies  upon  Prison  Legal  News  v.  Columbia \nCounty, No. 3:12-CV-00071-SI, 2012 WL 1936108, at *6 (D. Oregon May 29, 2012).  In that \ncase, the court failed to find issues moot after the defendant changed the mail policy “because \nseveral areas of dispute remain unresolved [by the change and] . . . the postcard-only mail policy \n[which was being challenged] remains in effect.”  Id.  Likewise, the court in  Prison Legal News \nv.  Chapman,  No.  3:12-CV-00125,  2013  WL  1296367,  at  *3  (M.D.  Ga.  Aug.  26,  2014) \n7 \n \nCase 2:13-cv-00266-JRG-MCLC   Document 24   Filed 03/26/15   Page 7 of 11   PageID #: 302\n\n(Chapman  I),  declined  to  find  issues  moot  because  “several  areas  of  dispute  remain[ed] \nunresolved” despite changes to the mail policy.  Id. at *3.  Finally, in Prison Legal News v. \nCounty of Ventura, No. CV 14-773-GHK (Ex)., 2014 WL 2519402, at *9 (C.D. Cal. May 29, \n2014), the court found that the voluntary cessation exception applied because defendants failed \nto satisfy their burden that the conduct would not start up again.  The court stated that “[m]ere \npromises” were insufficient to meet the burden considering that defendant admitted that mail \nstaff had failed to comply with policy directives that were in place in the past.  Id.  There was \nevidence that, even after the change in policy, the new policy was not being followed.  Id.  \nFinally, there was little assurance the mail situation had been rectified in light of defendants’ \nadmission that staff had previously rejected mail for “random reasons.”  Id.   \nHere, the exact policy that was in effect is the one that was changed; the postcards-only \npolicy was changed to a regular-mail policy.  Thus, that portion of Policy I is not left unresolved \nin Policy II.  In addition, there are no allegations in this case that the mail staff was failing to \nadhere to the mail policy or mailings were being rejected for random reasons.  The allegation in \nthis case is that the postcards-only portion of Policy I, which mail staff was following, violates \nthe First Amendment.  There is no evidence in the record that the mail staff is failing to adhere to \nthe regular-mail policy of Policy II.  For these reasons, the instant case is distinguishable from \ncases cited by PLN. \nFor all of these reasons, the defendants have carried their burden in showing that the \nissues surrounding the postcards-only portion of Policy I are moot.  See Ultimate Smoke, LLC v. \nCity of Kingsport, Tenn., No. 2:12-CV-13, 2013 WL 6713513, at *2 (E.D. Tenn. Dec. 19, 2013) \n(finding issue moot where Tennessee legislature had subsequently changed the law and nothing \n8 \n \nCase 2:13-cv-00266-JRG-MCLC   Document 24   Filed 03/26/15   Page 8 of 11   PageID #: 303\n\nin record to indicate the prior offending city ordinances would be reenacted).  The request by \nPLN for a preliminary injunction regarding the postcards-only policy is denied as moot. \nIII.  Due Process Portion of Policy I \n  In PLN’s Memorandum, PLN seeks to enjoin the jail to establish due process procedures \nregarding censorship because Policy I’s procedures violate the Fourteenth Amendment.  This \nissue was not raised in the actual Motion.  However, the Court will address it briefly.   \nThe sections of Policy I and Policy II which deal with due process notice requirements \nare identical.  Those sections state in pertinent part: \n. . . . \n \nB. A prisoner will be notified in writing if any mail is rejected. \n \nC. The inmate will have a chance to appeal this rejection; by filing \na grievance with the commissary officer. \n \nD. If the inmate is no longer in our custody the officer will mark \nout our address, mark \"not at this address\" and stamp \"return to \nsender\" and place back in the mail. \n \n[Doc. 15-1, pg. 2 and Doc. 15-3, pg. 2].   \nIt is unclear whether the defendants claim that the Fourteenth Amendment due process \nissue is moot.  It is unclear because the defendants state, “In as much as Defendants have \nabandoned their post-card only policy, and in as much as Defendants’ post-card only policy is \nthe only action for which Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, this issue is no longer live and this \ncourt cannot affect the matter at issue.”  [Doc. 13, pgs. 5-6].   \nHowever, PLN moves for an injunction regarding the due process issue based on Policy I.  \nBecause Policy I is no longer in effect, this Court assumes that the defendants have raised the \nmootness issue.  The defendants did not voluntarily cease the alleged due process wrongs when \nthe jail implemented Policy II because these sections are identical.  Therefore, the voluntary \n9 \n \nCase 2:13-cv-00266-JRG-MCLC   Document 24   Filed 03/26/15   Page 9 of 11   PageID #: 304\n\ncessation exception to the mootness doctrine does not apply.  As such, the due process issue is \npotentially still a live controversy.   \nThis creates an odd practical problem in terms of an injunction, however.  PLN did not \noriginally move to enjoin the jail based on Policy II, although it argues in its Reply that Policy II \nstill violates the Fourteenth Amendment.  [Doc. 19, pgs. 4-7].  Nevertheless, PLN has neither \namended the Complaint to allege that Policy II violates the Fourteenth Amendment nor to seek \ninjunctive or declaratory relief in this regard.  Thus, how does the Court issue an injunction on a \npolicy that technically is no longer in place but still is in place for all practical purposes?  It \ncould be that this Court should have found that Policy I in its entirety is not moot.  However, \nbased on this Court’s review of the case law, and based on the facts of this case, the postcards-\nonly policy issue is moot.  Importantly, this Court cannot decide an issue that is no longer live. \nBased on the foregoing, the Court must resort to a practical solution.  On the current \nrecord, the Motion for Preliminary Injunction on this due process issue is DENIED, for the issue \nis not properly before the Court.  However, PLN shall have 10 days from the entry of this \nMemorandum Opinion and Order to move to amend its Complaint and allege violations based on \nPolicy II.  PLN is then free to file another Motion for Preliminary Injunction on this issue.  \nIn the meantime, the Defendants may choose to implement a new policy which fully \ncomplies with the principles set forth in Martin v. Kelley, 803 F.2d 236 (6th Cir. 1986).  Prison \nofficials must provide minimal procedural safeguards for confiscation of inmate mail.  Martin v. \nKelley, 803 F.2d 236 (6th Cir. 1986) (citing Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 417–19 (1974), \noverruled in part on other grounds by Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401 (1989)).  Specifically, \nthree things must be done.  They include:  “(1) notice be given to the inmate of the rejected \nletter; (2) a reasonable opportunity be given to the author of the letter to protest the rejection \n10 \n \nCase 2:13-cv-00266-JRG-MCLC   Document 24   Filed 03/26/15   Page 10 of 11   PageID #: 305\n\ndecisions; and (3) complaints concerning the rejection be reviewed by someone other than the \nindividual who originally rejected the letter.”  Martin, 803 F.2d at 241-42. \nHere, these minimal procedural safeguards do not appear to be satisfied by Policy II.  As \nsuch, PLN is likely to succeed on the merits that the defendants have violated its Fourteenth \nAmendment rights.  Regarding the remaining factors, they all weigh in favor of PLN.  PLN \nwould continue to suffer irreparable harm by the violation of its Fourteenth Amendment rights if \nno proper policy is implemented to provide the minimal procedural safeguards.  In addition, \ndrafting and implementing a new policy is not burdensome to the defendants.  Finally, the public \nhas an interest in the free flow of information and a system to appeal decisions of censorship is \nof vital importance. \nIV.  Conclusion \n  For the reasons stated above, the motion, [Doc. 4], is DENIED. \n  ENTER: \n \n \n  s/J.

Plaintiff Prison Legal News, a project of the Human Rights Defense Center, \nhereby amends its Complaint in compliance with the Court’s order denying preliminary \ninjunctive relief, (Doc. 24). \n2.  Plaintiff brings this action to enjoin Defendants’ censorship of Prison Legal \nNews’ monthly publication and correspondence mailed to prisoners who are held in custody at \nthe Sullivan County Jail, in violation of the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment’s \nDue Process Clause. Defendants have adopted and implemented written mail policies and \npractices that violate the First Amendment by unconstitutionally restricting correspondence to \nprisoners to postcards only, and that prohibit delivery of book catalogs and magazines to \nPage 1 of 17 \n \nCase 2:13-cv-00266-JRG-MCLC   Document 29   Filed 03/27/15   Page 1 of 17   PageID #: 350\n\nprisoners. Further, Defendants’ policies and practices do not afford Prison Legal News due \nprocess, including notice and an opportunity to challenge the censorship, as required by the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n3.  This action arises under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United \nStates Constitution. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331and \n1343, and additionally under 28 U.S.C. § 2201, and 2202. \n4.  Venue is proper in the Eastern District of Tennessee under 28 U.S.C. § 1391 \n(b)(2) because a substantial part of the events complained of occurred in this District, and \nbecause the Defendants reside in this District.  \nPARTIES \n5.  Plaintiff Prison Legal News (“PLN”) is a project of the Human Rights Defense \nCenter (“HRDC”), a Washington Non-Profit Corporation. The core of HRDC’s mission is public \neducation, prisoner education, advocacy, and outreach in support of the rights of prisoners and in \nfurtherance of basic human rights. PLN publishes and distributes a monthly journal of \ncorrections news and analysis and certain books about the criminal justice system and legal \nissues affecting prisoners to prisoners, lawyers, courts, libraries, and the public throughout the \nCountry. PLN also maintains a website (www.prisonlegalnews.org) and operates an email list. \nPrisoners of all types, family and friends of prisoners, and prisoner advocates are among the \nintended beneficiaries of PLN’s activities.  \n6.  Defendant Sullivan County is a municipality formed under the laws of the State of \nTennessee. The official jail prisoner mail policies at issue in this case were the moving force \nbehind the constitutional violations alleged herein. \nPage 2 of 17 \n \nCase 2:13-cv-00266-JRG-MCLC   Document 29   Filed 03/27/15   Page 2 of 17   PageID #: 351\n\n7.  The Sullivan County Sheriff’s Office is a department of Sullivan County and \noperates the Sullivan County Jail located in Blountville, Tennessee. The Sullivan County Jail \nfacility houses convicted prisoners and pretrial detainees.  \n8.  Defendant J. Wayne Anderson is the Sheriff of Sullivan County. Sheriff Anderson \nis employed by and is an agent of Sullivan County and the Sheriff’s Office. He is responsible for \nthe operations of the Sullivan County Jail, and the training and supervision of the Jail staff who \ninterpret and implement the Jail’s mail policy for prisoners. He is the policymaker for the Jail \npolicy governing mail for prisoners.  \n9.  Each of the acts and omissions of the persons alleged herein were taken under \ncolor of state law and within the scope of their official duties as employees and officers of \nSullivan County and the Sullivan County Sheriff’s Office.  \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nPRISON LEGAL NEWS \n10.  PLN publishes and distributes a soft-cover monthly journal and publishes and \ndistributes paperback books about the criminal justice system and legal issues affecting \nprisoners.  \n11.  Prison Legal News has thousands of subscribers in the United States and abroad, \nincluding prisoners, attorneys, journalists, public libraries, judges, and other members of the \npublic. PLN distributes its publication to prisoners and law libraries in approximately 2,200 \ncorrectional facilities across the United States, including the Federal Bureau of Prisons and the \nTennessee Department of Corrections.  \nPage 3 of 17 \n \nCase 2:13-cv-00266-JRG-MCLC   Document 29   Filed 03/27/15   Page 3 of 17   PageID #: 352\n\n12.  Prison Legal News engages in core protected speech and expressive conduct on \nmatters of public concern, such as operations of prison facilities, prison conditions, prisoner \nhealth and safety, and prisoners’ rights.  \nCENSORSHIP AND LACK OF DUE PROCESS \n13.  Defendants have rejected PLN’s monthly publications, books, book catalogs, \nbook offers, informational brochures, subscription forms, subscription renewal letters, \nfundraising letters, and online articles mailed to prisoners held in custody at the Sullivan County \nJail. The mail items rejected by Defendants include, but are not limited to, the items identified \nbelow.  \nMonthly Publications and Books \n14.  Beginning on or about February 15, 2012, Prison Legal News sent its monthly \njournal to certain prisoners at the Sullivan County Jail by U.S. Mail on or about the 15th day of \neach month. \n15.  PLN’s monthly journal is a 64-page publication titled Prison Legal News. It \ncontains various articles on corrections news and analysis, about prisoner rights, court rulings, \nmanagement of prison facilities and prison conditions. \n16.  Similarly, from February 2012 to May 2013, PLN mailed 46 copies of the book \nProtecting Your Health & Safety: A Litigation Guide for Inmates to 46 separate prisoners in \ncustody at the Sullivan County Jail by U.S. Mail. \n17.  On information and belief, Defendants have censored and refused to deliver the \nPrison Legal News journals and the books that PLN sent to prisoner-addressees. For example, on \nor about February 2012, PLN personally addressed and mailed a copy of the book Protecting \nYour Health & Safety to prisoner Clovis Jones at the Sullivan County Jail. Mr. Jones was a \nPage 4 of 17 \n \nCase 2:13-cv-00266-JRG-MCLC   Document 29   Filed 03/27/15   Page 4 of 17   PageID #: 353\n\nprisoner at the Sullivan County Jail at the time that the Jail received the book from PLN. The Jail \nrefused to deliver the book to Mr. Jones and returned the book to PLN. \n18.    On or about February 15, 2012, PLN mailed a sample copy of the monthly \njournal Prison Legal News addressed individually to prisoner Christopher Hooker at the Sullivan \nCounty Jail. Mr. Hooker was a prisoner at the Sullivan County Jail at the time that the Jail \nreceived the copy of Prison Legal News in the mail from PLN. The Jail refused to deliver the \njournal to Mr. Hooker and returned it to PLN. \n19.  On or about February 15, 2012, PLN mailed a sample copy of the journal Prison \nLegal News individually addressed to prisoner Constance Gilbert at the Sullivan County Jail. \nGilbert was a prisoner at the Sullivan County Jail at the time that the Jail received the sample \nPrison Legal News publication from PLN. The envelope was returned to PLN with the markings \n“Post cards only! Can not [sic] have.” The envelope arrived at PLN with those words struck \nthrough and replaced with writing that reads, “not here.” \n20.  On or about February 15, 2012, PLN mailed a sample copy of the journal Prison \nLegal News individually addressed to prisoner John Puckett at the Sullivan County Jail. Mr. \nPuckett was a prisoner at the Sullivan County Jail at the time that the Jail received the sample \nPrison Legal News magazine from PLN. On information and belief, Jail employees marked the \nenvelope “Can not [sic] have [sic] post cards only!” The envelope returned to PLN had those \nwords struck through and replaced with the words, “Not here!” \n21.  On or about March 15, 2012, PLN mailed the March 2012 Prison Legal News \npublication addressed to prisoner Jeffery Gragg at the Sullivan County Jail. Mr. Gragg was a \nprisoner at the Sullivan County Jail at the time that the Jail received the Prison Legal News \npublication from PLN. The Jail returned the publication to PLN. \nPage 5 of 17 \n \nCase 2:13-cv-00266-JRG-MCLC   Document 29   Filed 03/27/15   Page 5 of 17   PageID #: 354\n\n22.  Including the items listed above, from on or about February 15, 2012 through on \nor about September 15, 2012, PLN mailed approximately 200 individually addressed copies of \nits monthly journal, Prison Legal News, to 33 separate prisoners at the Sullivan County Jail. \nEach one of the 33 prisoners had also been mailed a copy of the book Protecting Your Health & \nSafety from PLN’s offices. \n23.  On October 10, 2012, former Sullivan County inmate Joseph Samples notified \nPlaintiff  that the Jail’s major had refused to deliver the vast majority of the books PLN sent to \nprisoners and that the major kept approximately thirty copies of Protecting Your Health & Safety \nand approximately ninety copies of Prison Legal News on his desk, undelivered to inmate-\naddressees. \n24.  Beginning in October 2012, PLN mailed approximately ten copies of its monthly \njournal Prison Legal News individually addressed to approximately ten separate prisoners at the \nSullivan County Jail, each of whom was a prisoner of the Jail at the time the Jail received the \nPrison Legal News publication from PLN. On information and belief, none of these monthly \njournals were delivered to the intended recipients under the “postcards-only” mail policy \n(“Policy I”), but these journals were instead censored by jail staff persons. \n25.  Additionally, PLN mailed 12 copies of the book Protecting Your Health & Safety \nto 12 separate prisoners at the Sullivan County Jail from on or about October 18, 2012. On \ninformation and belief, none of these books were delivered by Jail staff persons to the prisoners \nwho were the intended recipients of the same, but said mail was censored by jail staff under \nPolicy I. \n26.  PLN also mailed individually addressed letters from PLN Editor Paul Wright to \n14 separate prisoners at the Sullivan County Jail on or about October 18, 2012. On information \nPage 6 of 17 \n \nCase 2:13-cv-00266-JRG-MCLC   Document 29   Filed 03/27/15   Page 6 of 17   PageID #: 355\n\nand belief, none of the letters were delivered to the prisoners who were the intended recipients of \nthe same, but said mail was censored by jail staff. \n27.  On or about October 22, 2012, PLN mailed its annual fundraiser letter to 14 \nseparate prisoners at the Sullivan County Jail. On information and belief, none of these 14 letters \nwere delivered to their intended recipients who were prisoners at the jail but were instead \ncensored by jail staff persons. \n28.  Defendants did not provide PLN notice or an opportunity to appeal the censorship \ndecisions.  \n29.  Defendants did not provide the prisoner-addressees due process, including notice \nor an opportunity to appeal any of the aforementioned censorship decisions. \n30.  PLN intends to continue its mission to promote public safety through educational \nand journalistic avenues by sending its monthly journal, copies of books, and letters to prisoners \nat the Sullivan County Jail in the future. \nInformational Brochures, Subscription Order Forms, Book Catalogs \n31.  Prison Legal News sent informational brochures about PLN and subscription \norder forms, book catalogs, and book offers to prisoners at the Sullivan County Jail in white \nstandard #10 envelopes via first-class mail.  \n32.  Prison Legal News Brochure and Subscription Order Form: Prison Legal \nNews sent certain prisoners at the Sullivan County Jail an informational brochure about its \norganization and publications. The double-sided, single-page brochure includes: a description of \nthe topics covered in PLN’s monthly journal, subscription rates, special subscription offers, and \nan order form; a description of three books available for purchase or included with a subscription \nto Prison Legal News – Protecting Your Health & Safety, With Liberty for Some: 500 Years of \nPage 7 of 17 \n \nCase 2:13-cv-00266-JRG-MCLC   Document 29   Filed 03/27/15   Page 7 of 17   PageID #: 356\n\nImprisonment in America, and Prison Profiteers: Who Makes Money from Mass Incarceration; \nand other information about PLN’s bookstore. \n33.  Book Catalog: Prison Legal News sent certain prisoners at the Sullivan County \nJail its PLN Book List. The double-sided single page book list includes a description of 43 \nbooks, dictionaries, and resources materials available for purchase. The books available for \npurchase include information about a variety of topics, including but not limited to: the basic \nrights of prisoners regarding health and safety; the American criminal justice system; self-\nrepresentation in court; finding the right lawyer; DNA testing; issues related to imprisoned \nwomen; developing a successful re-entry plan upon release from prison; searching for a job; \ncrime and poverty; and the mental health crisis in U.S. prisons and jails. \n34.  Book Offers: Prison Legal News sent certain prisoners at the Sullivan County Jail \na double-sided single-page informational brochure about two books for sale: The Habeas \nCitebook: Ineffective Assistance of Counsel, a handbook containing case citations, pleadings, and \nforms designed to help a prisoner seek habeas corpus relief; and Prisoners’ Guerrilla Handbook \nto Correspondence Programs in the United States and Canada, a handbook on high school, \nvocational, paralegal, undergraduate, and graduate courses available through correspondence \nstudy. \n35.  Collectively, the PLN Brochure, Book List, and Book Offer described above in \nparagraphs 32 through 34 are referred to as “Informational Brochure Packs” below.  \n36.  From on or about February 15, 2012 to May 15, 2013, Prison Legal News mailed \n46 individually addressed Information Brochure Packs to 46 separate prisoners at the Sullivan \nCounty Jail, each of whom was a prisoner at the Sullivan County Jail at the time the Jail received \nthe Informational Brochure Packs. \nPage 8 of 17 \n \nCase 2:13-cv-00266-JRG-MCLC   Document 29   Filed 03/27/15   Page 8 of 17   PageID #: 357\n\n37.  On information and belief, Defendants rejected each Informational Brochure Pack \nsent by PLN and did not deliver them to the prisoner-addressees. \n38.  For the Informational Brochure Packs that Defendants returned to Prison Legal \nNews, Defendants simply wrote “RTS” or sometimes “not here.” \n39.  For example, PLN sent Ahmad Abdul-Khaaliq such a Brochure Pack in a \nstandard, white envelope on December 19, 2012, but Jail employees marked “not here” and \n“RTS” and caused the brochures to be returned to PLN. On information and belief, Mr. Abdul-\nKhaaliq did not receive this mail from PLN even though he was a prisoner at the Sullivan \nCounty Jail at the time that the mail arrived at the jail. \n40.  On or about February 16, 2012, PLN mailed an Informational Brochure Packet \naddressed to prisoner Donald Wilcox at the Sullivan County Jail. Mr. Wilcox was a prisoner at \nthe Sullivan County Jail at the time that the Jail received the packet from PLN. The Jail returned \nthe mail to PLN without separate notification. \n41.  Inmate Nicholas Hillis requested PLN’s materials in January 2013. PLN sent Mr. \nHillis an initial mailing including Protecting Your Health & Safety and other sample and \ninformational materials in April 2013. On information and belief, Mr. Hillis’s copy of Protecting \nYour Health & Safety never reached him under Policy I. \n42.  Inmate Ryan Davis requested materials from PLN on or about April 30, 2012. \n43.  PLN mailed an Informational Brochure Pack to Mr. Davis, along with a sample \ncopy of Prison Legal News, in June 2012. Mr. Davis received some materials, but he did not \nreceive his monthly gift subscription to Prison Legal News while Policy I was in effect. \n44.  Defendants did not provide PLN due process notice or an opportunity to appeal \nthe censorship decisions for any of the censored mail described in this Amended Complaint. \nPage 9 of 17 \n \nCase 2:13-cv-00266-JRG-MCLC   Document 29   Filed 03/27/15   Page 9 of 17   PageID #: 358\n\n45.  Likewise, Defendants did not provide the prisoner-addressees notice or an \nopportunity to appeal the censorship decisions for any of the mail described herein. \n46.  The Defendants failed to provide due process, including notice and an opportunity \nto be heard, to PLN and the prisoner-addressees. \n47.  Prison Legal News intends to continue sending Informational Brochure Packs to \nprisoners at the Sullivan County Jail in the future. \nJAIL POLICIES \nI.  Policy I \n48.  On October 14, 2011 the Sullivan County Jail, on the orders of Defendant J. \nWayne Anderson, promulgated and implemented a new policy governing mail to prisoners \n(“Policy I”). \n49.  The Jail’s Postcard-Only Mail Policy stated, in pertinent part: \n    As a general rule, incoming mail shall be limited to the Following: \n    1. Standard postcard, of which the minimum size is 3.5 x 4.25, and maximum size  \n    8.5 x 11. \n2. Postcards must be white in color front and back. \n \n50.  The Postcard-Only Mail Policy also stated, “If any items are received in the mail \nother than postcards, (ex. Stamps. envelopes) the mail will be returned to sender.” \n51.  Defendants have used their Postcard-Only Mail Policy to censor Plaintiff’s Prison \nLegal News journal, Informational Brochure Packs, Renewal Brochure Packs, Fundraising Packs, \nonline articles, and other correspondence. \n52.  Defendants’ Policy I and their practice of enforcing this policy unconstitutionally \nburdens Plaintiff’s First Amendment rights, the First Amendment rights of other correspondents \nwho send mail to prisoners confined at the Sullivan County Jail, the First Amendment rights of \nPage 10 of 17 \n \nCase 2:13-cv-00266-JRG-MCLC   Document 29   Filed 03/27/15   Page 10 of 17   PageID #: 359\n\nthe intended recipients of outgoing mail from prisoners confined at the Sullivan County Jail, and \nthe First Amendment rights of prisoners at the Sullivan County Jail. \n53.  Defendant Anderson and other agents of Sullivan County are responsible for or \npersonally participated in creating and implementing these unconstitutional policies, practices, \nand customs, and for training and supervising the mail staff members whose conduct also has \ninjured Plaintiff and others, or ratified or adopted the policies or actions described herein. \nII.  Policy II \n54.  During the course of this litigation and days after the filing of the Complaint in \nthis action was reported by the local press, (see, e.g., Matthew Lane, “Group files lawsuit against \nSullivan County Sheriff’s office, Anderson,” TIMES NEWS (Oct. 29, 2013), available at: \n<http://www.timesnews.net/article/9069259/group-files-lawsuit-against-sullvan-county-sheriffs-\noffice-anderson>), and by the Tennessee Bar Association, (see Brittany Sims, “Group Files \nLawsuit against Sullivan County Sheriff’s Office,” TENN. BAR ASS’N (Oct. 30, 2013), available \nat: < http://www.tba.org/news/group-files-lawsuit-against-sullivan-county-sheriff-s-office>), \nDefendants issued and promulgated a new policy for jail mail (“Policy II”). \n55.  Policy II went into effect on November 4, 2013. (See Docs. 15-3, 24 at 3).1 \n56.  Policy II abandoned the postcards-only policy and returned to accepting regular \nmail. \n57.  Policy II, like Policy I, is silent as to magazines. (See Doc. 24 at 3). \n58.  Section IV of Policy II, regarding “Mail Rejection,” remained unchanged from \nPolicy I. \n                                                 \n1   While the effective date for Policy II is listed on the policy as November 4, 2013, Defendant Anderson did \nnot sign the policy until November 5, 2013. (See Doc. 15-3 at 3). \nPage 11 of 17 \n \nCase 2:13-cv-00266-JRG-MCLC   Document 29   Filed 03/27/15   Page 11 of 17   PageID #: 360\n\n59.  The “Mail Rejection” section of Policy II fails to provide any due process \nprotections to senders. \n60.  The “Mail Collection and Delivery” section of Policy II fails to provide any due \nprocess protections to senders or recipients. \n61.  Defendants’ failure to provide for adequate due-process protections continues to \ncause Plaintiff irreparable harm and denial of their constitutional rights. \n62.  Defendants’ Policy II and their practice of enforcing this policy unconstitutionally \nburdens Plaintiff’s First Amendment rights, the First Amendment rights of other correspondents \nwho send mail to prisoners confined at the Sullivan County Jail, the First Amendment rights of \nthe intended recipients of outgoing mail from prisoners confined at the Sullivan County Jail, and \nthe First Amendment rights of prisoners at the Sullivan County Jail. \nIII.  Content-Based Discrimination \n63.  Additionally, Defendants have maintained a policy and practice of permitting other \nmagazines into the Jail while censoring Plaintiffs’ materials. \n64.  Specifically, Defendants have allowed inmates access to O Magazine, Men’s Journal, \nGlamour, Outdoor Life, Field & Stream, Hot Rod, Us, and Star magazines.  \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \nVIOLATION OF THE FIRST AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS TO THE UNITED STATES \nCONSTITUTION \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n \n65.

The due-process protections for both Policy I and Policy II are facially \nunconstitutional. \n72.  The acts described above have caused damages to Plaintiff, and will continue to \ncause damage. \n73.

The magazines accessible to inmates are on a range of entertainment, gossip, \nlifestyle, and sports topics. By permitting access to periodicals such as O Magazine, Field and \nStream, and Outdoor Life, while banning access to core political speech such as PLN’s monthly \nmagazine, Defendants engaged in unlawful discrimination based on content. \n77.  The actions described above have caused PLN damage, and will continue to cause \ndamage. \n78.  PLN is entitled to punitive, compensatory, presumed, and nominal damages, as \nwell as injunctive and declaratory relief, for Defendants’ content-based discrimination, and \nadditionally, punitive damages against Defendant Anderson in his personal capacity. \nINJUNCTION ALLEGATIONS \n79.
