    "summary": "<p>The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) requires the government to obtain a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) before it may conduct any domestic electronic surveillance to acquire foreign intelligence information. The warrant applications are made ex parte and must include a sworn statement by a federal officer of the facts and circumstances relied upon to justify the government's belief that the target of surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. Once a FISC judge receives a warrant application, the judge can order approval of the surveillance only if the judge finds that there is probable cause to believe that the target of the electronic surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. Because the orders only authorize surveillance up to 90 days, the government must file an application for an extension that meets the same requirements as the initial warrant application and obtain a renewal order from the FISC for continued surveillance. For the Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse collection of FISA matters, see our <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/results.php?searchSpecialCollection=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">special collection</a>.</p>\r\n<p>On January 29, 2018, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) voted to disclose a memorandum (the Nunes Memo) revealing existence of a FISA warrant for the electronic surveillance of Carter Page, who served as a onetime foreign policy advisor to the Trump Campaign until September 2016. The Nunes Memo was declassified by President Donald Trump on February 2, 2018. The Nunes Memo revealed that on October 21, 2016, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) sought and received a probable cause order from the FISC authorizing electronic surveillance on Carter Page. The Nunes Memo further disclosed that in addition to the initial warrant application, the government had received three renewal orders from the FISC.</p>\r\n<p>On February 6, 2018, reporters Adam Goldman and Charlie Savage, along with the New York Times, filed a motion in the FISC for release of all court records, including opinions and application materials, in reference to the surveillance of Carter Page. See <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16844\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Misc. 18-01</a>.</p>\r\n<p>On March 7, 2018, reporter Charlie Savage and the New York Times Company also filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs sued the Department of Justice (DOJ) under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for the same documents they requested in their FISC motion: the release of all documents regarding the surveillance of Carter Page.</p>\r\n<p>On July 21, 2018, the DOJ produced redacted documents it considered responsive to the FOIA request. See <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17114\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">In re Carter W. Page</a>.</p>\r\n<p>On August 9, 2018, the parties stipulated to settle their claims. In exchange for The Times's agreement to dismiss this action, the DOJ agreed to provide to the Times any additional documents responsive to The Times's FOIA Request that are released in any related actions. On August 9, 2018, United States District Judge Analisa Torres approved the settlement. The case is now closed.</p>",

The September 23rd \nNews Article stated that a \"well-placed Western intelligence source\" told the news \norganization that Page met with Igor Sechin, a longtime Putin associate and former \nRussian deputy minister who is now the executive chairman of Rosneft.  At their \nalleged meeting, Sechin raised the issue of the lifting of sanctions with Page. \nAccording to the September 23rd News Article, the Western intelligence source also \nreported that U.S. intelligence agencies received reports that Page met with another \ntop Putin aide -Igor Divyekin, a former Russian security official who now serves as \ndeputy chief for internal policy and is believed by U.S. officials to have \nTOP SBCRBT/INOFORN/FISA \n-24-\n17-cv-597(FBI)-1 07 \n\nTOP SBCRBTl/NOFORNIFISA \nresponsibility for intelligence collected by Russian agencies about the U.S. election.19 \n(U)  ~ According to the September 23rd News Article, certain members of \nCongress were \"taken aback\" after being briefed on the alleged meetings between \nPage and Russian officials and viewed the meetings as a possible back channel to the \nRussians that could undercut U.S. foreign policy.

For example, the September 23rd News Article noted that \nPage's precise role in Candidate #1's campaign is unclear. According to the article, a \nspokesperson for Candidate #1' s campaign called Page an \"informal foreign \nadvisor\" who \"does not speak for [Candidate #1] or the campaign.\" In addition, \nanother spokesperson for Candidate #1's campaign said that Page \"has no role\" and \nadded \"[w]e are not aware of any of his activities, past or present.\" However, the \narticle stated that the campaign spokesperson did not respond when asked why \nCandidate #1 had previously described Page as an advisor.

The Election Security Joint \nStatement states that the recent disclosures of e-mails on, among others, sites like \nWikiLeaks are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed \nefforts.

The Election \nSecurity Joint Statement stated that, based on the scope and sensitivity of these \nefforts, only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities. \nMore recently, on December 29, 2016, the White House issued a statement that the \nU.S. President had ordered a number of actions in response to the Russian \nGovernment's aggressive harassment of U.S. officials and cyber operations aimed at \nthe U.S. election.

This is an action under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C.\n§552, to obtain an order for the production of agency records from Defendant Department of Justice\n(“DOJ”) in response to a FOIA request properly made by Plaintiffs.   \nPARTIES \n2. Plaintiff The New York Times Company publishes The New York Times\nnewspaper and www.nytimes.com.  The New York Times Company is headquartered in this judicial \ndistrict at 620 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York, 10018. \n3. Plaintiff Charlie Savage is a reporter for The New York Times and an employee of\nThe New York Times Company. \n4. Defendant DOJ is an agency of the federal government that has possession and\ncontrol of the records that Plaintiffs seek.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n§1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B).\n1 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02054   Doc #: 1   Filed 03/07/18   Page 2 of 3 Page ID #: 2\n6.  Venue is premised on the place of business of Plaintiffs and is proper in this \ndistrict under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B). \n7.  Defendant DOJ has failed to meet the statutory deadline set by FOIA. See 5 \nU.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A). Plaintiffs are therefore deemed to have exhausted all administrative remedies, \npursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(C). \nFACTS \n8.  On February 2, 2018, Plaintiffs submitted a FOIA request to DOJ (FOIA/PA \n#18-094) seeking “access to, including declassification review of as necessary, documents submitted by \nDOJ to the FISC, and orders or other documents issued by the FISC, in connection with the FISA order \ntargeting Carter Page issued in October 2016, as well as its extensions, the existence of which and certain \ndetails of which were declassified by President Trump in connection to the HPSCI memo.” \n9.  On February 21, 2018, DOJ acknowledged receipt of the request.  \n10.  DOJ has failed to respond to Plaintiffs’ FOIA request within the statutory time \nframe required under FOIA. \nCOUNT \n11.  Plaintiffs repeat, reallege, and reincorporate the allegations in the foregoing \nparagraphs as though fully set forth herein. \n12.  Defendant DOJ is subject to FOIA and must therefore release in response to a \nFOIA request any disclosable records in its possession at the time of the request and provide a lawful \nreason for withholding any materials as to which it is claiming an exemption.  \n13.  DOJ has failed to meet the statutory deadline set by FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. \n§ 552(a)(6)(A).  Accordingly, Plaintiffs are deemed to have exhausted their administrative remedies under \nFOIA. \n14.  DOJ has no lawful basis for declining to release the records requested by \nPlaintiffs under FOIA. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02054   Doc #: 1   Filed 03/07/18   Page 3 of 3 Page ID #: 3\n15.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to an order compelling DOJ to produce \nrecords responsive to their FOIA request. \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court:  \n16.  Declare that the documents sought by their FOIA request, as described in the \nforegoing paragraphs, are public under 5 U.S.C. § 552 and must be disclosed; \n17.  Order DOJ to provide the requested documents to Plaintiffs within 20 business \ndays of the Court’s order; \n18.  Award Plaintiffs the costs of this proceeding, including reasonable attorneys’ \nfees, as expressly permitted by FOIA; and  \n19.  Grant Plaintiffs such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper. \n \n \n \n \nDated:  New York, NY \n  March 7, 2018 \n   \n \n              _____________/s/_________________  \n              David E.
