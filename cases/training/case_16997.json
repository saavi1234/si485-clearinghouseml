Att'y Gen. 293 (January 16, 1981). Plaintiffs allege that this is just such a case.

    "summary": "<p>On November 20, 2018, a group of asylum seekers challenged the federal government&rsquo;s latest asylum policy, which prohibited people who enter the United States along the southern border somewhere other than a designated port of entry from obtaining asylum. Specifically, the plaintiffs challenged an interim final rule promulgated on November 9, 2018, declaring all those subject to a presidential proclamation concerning the southern border ineligible for asylum. The plaintiffs also challenged the \"Presidential Proclamation Addressing Mass Migration Through the Southern Border of the United States,&rdquo; which then President Trump signed the same day, blocking the entry of all people entering the United States without inspection at the southern border. The plaintiffs alleged violations of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Act. Represented by the National Immigrant Justice Center, Human Rights First, and private counsel, they sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The case was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, and assigned to Magistrate Judge Randolph D. Moss.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs were six non-citizens who entered the United States seeking asylum. Two were a father and daughter who fled Honduras to escape a gang threatening to kill them, fearing the local police would not be willing to protect them. Another fled from Mexico, seeking safety from her gang-affiliated partner, who repeatedly beat her and threatened to kill her. A fourth plaintiff was an unaccompanied minor from Honduras who sought to escape a credible fear of murder from his father&mdash;a police officer who abused him&mdash;and from a gang that the plaintiff refused to join on moral grounds. Another two plaintiffs were a mother and her son from Honduras seeking asylum to escape the violence and threat of death posed by her husband. None had been granted asylum.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs argued that federal law allowed non-citizens to seek asylum regardless of their immigration status or how they entered the United States. Further, federal law established procedural safeguards that aimed to give asylum seekers a fair review process during removal proceedings. The plaintiffs also argued that under treaty obligations, the United States could not deny asylum on the basis of where the non-citizen entered the country. But the government&rsquo;s new rule, part of its broader &ldquo;zero-tolerance&rdquo; policy on immigration, &ldquo;shutter[ed] access to the asylum system for thousands of men, women, and children that the Administration concedes are likely to have meritorious asylum claims.&rdquo; Faced with even longer wait times at the border, the complaint argued, that asylum seekers already in dangerous situations and with scarce financial resources were thus left seriously vulnerable to violence from criminal organizations near the border.</p>\r\n<p>At the same time the complaint was filed, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, to be followed by a preliminary injunction enjoining implementation and enforcement of the rule and the proclamation.</p>\r\n<p>The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees filed an amicus brief in support of the plaintiffs, as did a group of seven United States senators.</p>\r\n<p>On December 17, 2018, the court held a hearing on the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, and consolidated the case with <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17043\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>S.M.S.R. v. Trump</em></a>, designating this case as the lead case. On December 21, the court decided to hold the motion in abeyance.</p>\r\n<p>On December 18, 2018, the <em>S.M.S.R. v. Trump</em> plaintiffs filed an amended complaint listing seven additional asylum seekers as plaintiffs. At the same time, the plaintiffs in this case also filed an amended complaint seeking certification of a class consisting of all persons who had crossed the southern border since November 10, 2018, and had either gone into hiding to avoid detection, presented outside a port of entry and been detained, or presented and been released pending further immigration proceedings.</p>\r\n<p>On December 26, 2018, the defendants filed a motion to stay all briefing deadlines in light of the lapse in appropriations to the Department of Justice caused by the federal government shutdown. The court, however, denied this motion.</p>\r\n<p>On January 4, 2019, the plaintiffs in both cases filed motions for summary judgment and class certification. The defendants filed a cross motion for summary judgment on February 25, 2019. Oral argument on these pending motions was scheduled for May 29, 2019.</p>\r\n<p>On August 2, 2019, the court granted in part the plaintiffs&rsquo; summary judgment and class certification motions, denied the defendants&rsquo; motion for summary judgment, and denied as moot the plaintiffs&rsquo; earlier motion for a temporary restraining order. 404 F.Supp.3d 109. The court held that the rule challenged by the plaintiffs was &ldquo;unlawful&rdquo; within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act. The court also found both the plaintiffs&rsquo; argument for an injunction and the defendants&rsquo; argument against the injunction unpersuasive; as a practical matter, it would be impossible to vacate the challenged rule with respect to the organizational plaintiffs without vacating the rule entirely. As such, the court agreed to vacate the rule but declined the plaintiffs&rsquo; request to enforce the requested injunction. As to the class certification, the court found that, here, the class certification requirements of numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation were met. All members of the proposed class faced the same potential loss of the right to seek asylum and sought invalidation of the interim final rule.</p>\r\n<p>On September 30, 2019, the defendants appealed the case. Oral argument was held in December 2020. Then, on February 2, 2021, President Biden issued the Executive Order on Creating a Comprehensive Regional Framework to Address the Causes of Migration, to Manage Migration Throughout North and Central America, and to Provide Safe and Orderly Processing of Asylum Seekers at the United States Border. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a per curiam order the following day asking the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing the mootness of the appeal in light of the executive order. A few days after receiving the supplemental briefs, the D.C. Circuit filed another order holding the case in abeyance as the new Biden administration worked to implement its own immigration policies. The administration was instructed to file status reports every 60 days.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Over the next few months, the Biden administration worked to strengthen the U.S. asylum system and end many Trump-era policies, including Remain in Mexico and Title 42. In October 2023, the U.S. government filed an unopposed motion to voluntarily dismiss the case. This motion was granted, and the district court dismissed the case on December 3, 2023. This case is now closed.</p>",

TRUMP, et al., \nAMENDED CLASS ACTION \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR \nDefendants.  DECLARATORY AND \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n   \n \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 40   Filed 12/18/18   Page 2 of 37\n \nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n1.  This case concerns the U.S. government’s unlawful attempt to deprive vulnerable \nindividuals of access to the protection that the nation’s asylum system affords.   \n2.  Under U.S. law, noncitizens are entitled to seek asylum irrespective of immigration \nstatus and without regard to manner of entry into the United States.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1).  \nU.S. law in this regard is consistent with the United States’ treaty obligations under the Refugee \nAct of 1980.  U.S. law also requires certain procedural safeguards during removal proceedings.  \nSee  id.  § 1225(b)(1).    These  safeguards  are  critical  to  ensuring  that  individuals  who  face \npersecution—including rape, kidnapping, torture, and even death—in their home countries are \ngiven a fair chance to establish their eligibility for asylum.   \n3.  On November 9, 2018, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Department of \nHomeland Security (“DHS”) promulgated an interim final rule (“the Rule”), EOIR Docket No. \n18–0501; A.G. Order No. 4327–2018, imposing new, significant limitations on who may seek \nasylum in the United States.  On the same day, President Trump signed a presidential proclamation \nentitled “Presidential Proclamation Addressing Mass Migration Through the Southern Border of \nthe United States” (“the Proclamation”) that purports to suspend the entry of individuals who have \nentered the United States from across the U.S.–Mexico border without receiving inspection at a \ndesignated port of entry.  Together, the Rule and the Proclamation render ineligible for asylum any \nnoncitizen who enters the United States without inspection from across the U.S.–Mexico border.  \nThis dramatic change to the Nation’s asylum laws shutters access to the asylum system for \nthousands of men, women, and children that the Administration concedes are likely to have \nmeritorious asylum claims.  The Rule is illegal in several respects. \n \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 40   Filed 12/18/18   Page 3 of 37\n \n4.  First, the Rule contradicts the requirements of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n(“INA”), specifically 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1), which gives any noncitizen who is physically present \nin or who arrives in the United States a statutory right to seek asylum, irrespective of the \nindividual’s manner of entry, and requires the government to follow specific processes when an \nindividual expresses a desire to seek asylum or fear of returning to his or her home country.  The \nRule is therefore contrary to law under the INA and the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \n§ 551 et seq. (“APA”). \n5.  Second, the Rule violates 8 U.S.C. § 1225 by mandating a denial of a credible fear \ndetermination, even in situations where a noncitizen in expedited removal proceedings shows a \nsignificant possibility that she could establish eligibility for asylum.  For this reason, the Rule is \nagain contrary to law under the INA and the APA.  \n6.  Third, the Rule violates The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection \nAct, 8 U.S.C. § 1158 (b)(3)(C), by denying unaccompanied children the opportunity to first present \nthe substance of their claims for asylum in a non-adversarial proceeding before an asylum officer.  \n7.  Fourth, by adopting, without notice and the opportunity to comment, an interim \nfinal rule depriving certain asylum seekers of the statutory protection outlined in the INA simply \nbecause they enter the country without inspection, the responsible government officials have acted \nin excess of their statutorily prescribed authority, contrary to law, and arbitrarily and capriciously, \nall in violation of the APA. \n8.  Fifth, the promulgation of the Rule was invalid because the current Acting Attorney \nGeneral who putatively authorized promulgation of the Rule is ineligible to serve in that role under \n28 U.S.C. § 508 and the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution, art. II, § 2, cl. 2.  \n \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 40   Filed 12/18/18   Page 4 of 37\n \n9.  Sixth, even assuming the current Acting Attorney General’s appointment was \nlawful, the Rule violates the requirement under 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(2)(C) that any changes to the \nlimitations and conditions imposed on asylum seekers be made by regulation—rather than by \npresidential decree.  Because the Rule is predicated on an abdication of that responsibility, and \nsimply incorporates by reference the consequence of Presidential proclamations, the Rule is invalid \nunder the APA and is ultra vires. \n10.  If allowed to stand, the Rule would fundamentally reshape and constrict asylum \nlaw, in contravention of U.S. and international law.  This Court’s intervention is necessary to put \na stop to this Administration’s illegal actions and prevent irreparable harm to thousands of asylum \nseekers who desperately need protection in this country.  \n11.  Plaintiffs respectfully request a declaration that the Rule violates the APA, and an \norder enjoining the application of the Rule.      \nPARTIES \n12.  Plaintiffs are noncitizens who are presently in the United States and wish to seek \nasylum. \n13.  Plaintiff O.A. is a 23-year-old man from Honduras who the government contends \nis subject to the Proclamation.  O.A. fled Honduras with his 4-year-old daughter, K.S., because a \ngang called Mara-18 (M-18), threatened to kill him and his family.  They did so because M-18 had \nkilled O.A.’s brother, and they then targeted O.A. and his family when O.A. cooperated with the \npolice to help them investigate his brother’s death.  O.A. knew that the police in Honduras would \nnot be willing or able to help him, and he decided to flee Honduras with his daughter.   \n14.  Plaintiff K.S. is a 4-year-old girl from Honduras.  O.A. is her father, and she entered \nthe United States with him when he entered the United States after fleeing Honduras.  K.S.’s life \n \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 40   Filed 12/18/18   Page 5 of 37\n \nwas at risk in Honduras because her father cooperated with police to investigate the death of his \nbrother, and she accompanied him when he fled Honduras to seek asylum in the United States. \n15.  Plaintiff A.V. is a 27-year-old woman from Honduras who crossed the border from \nMexico into the United States other than at a port of entry on November 11, 2018.  She has a \ncredible fear of persecution in Honduras because she is a victim of repeated violent assaults by her \npartner (who is the father of her children), and because her partner is likely a member of gang and \nhas threatened to kill her.  A.V. has nowhere to turn for help in Honduras.   \n16.  Plaintiff G.Z. is a 16-year-old unaccompanied minor from Honduras who the \ngovernment alleges crossed the U.S.–Mexico border other than at a port of entry on November 10, \n2018.  In Honduras, G.Z. was the victim of recurring violence at the hands of his father, who is a \npolice officer.  G.Z. has no ability to seek protection from the police, because his father is one of \nthem.  In the weeks preceding his departure from Honduras, G.Z. also rebuffed efforts by MS-13 \ngang members to recruit him because he believes their activities to be morally wrong.  G.Z. feared \nthat if he did not leave Honduras he would be killed.  He has a credible fear of persecution.   \n17.  Plaintiff D.S. is an asylum seeker from Honduras.  She fled Honduras because of \nsevere domestic abuse by her partner, who is a security guard.  She tried to report the violence, \nwhich at points required hospitalization, but the government did nothing in response to her \ncomplaint and did not pursue her partner when he failed to appear in judicial proceedings.  D.S. \nalso tried to relocate internally within Honduras but her partner tracked her down and threatened \nto kill her.  D.S. made the difficult journey across Mexico with her son, C.A., over the course of \ntwo weeks, during which time she exhausted all of her financial resources.  D.S., with her son, \nC.A., entered the United States other than at a port of entry on November 13, 2018, and they were \napprehended by immigration officials on the U.S. side of the border.   \n \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 40   Filed 12/18/18   Page 6 of 37\n \n18.  Plaintiff C.A. is an asylum seeker from Honduras, whose mother is Plaintiff D.S.  \nPlaintiff C.A. was regularly beaten by his father in Honduras and accompanied his mother, D.S., \non her journey to the United States.  With D.S., C.A. entered the United States other than at a port \nof entry on November 13, 2018, and they were apprehended by immigration officials on the U.S. \nside of the border.   \n19.  Plaintiff D.R. is an asylum seeker from El Salvador who crossed the southern \nborder other than at a port of entry on or about November 13, 2018.  D.R. was forced to flee El \nSalvador with her 20-year-old daughter, P.R., after government officials and members of a major \npolitical party badly beat them and threatened their lives for opposing the party and refusing to \nhelp it violate the law.  She fears she will be persecuted again if forced to return to El Salvador. \n20.  Plaintiff P.R. is a 20-year-old asylum seeker from El Salvador, whose mother is \nPlaintiff D.R.  Like her mother, P.R. was beaten and threatened by police and other government \nand political-party officials.  This abuse occurred because of her and her mother’s political \naffiliation and refusal to support the party.  Neither she nor her mother could go to the Salvadoran \nauthorities to report and prevent their persecution, because those authorities were precisely the \npeople perpetrating that persecution.  With nowhere to turn for help, she fled the country, crossing \nthe U.S. southern border with her mother on or about November 13, 2018.  She has a credible fear \nthat if returned to her home country, she would be gravely harmed or killed on account of her \nrefusal to support the party and on account of her relationship to her mother.   \n21.  Plaintiff G.R. is an 18-year-old Nicaraguan national who is seeking asylum in the \nUnited States.  After providing medical assistance to protesters participating in peaceful protests \nagainst government policies—and after participating in some such protests herself—G.R. received \nthreatening phone calls, whereupon she attempted to relocate to another part of Nicaragua.  Internal \n \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 40   Filed 12/18/18   Page 7 of 37\n \nrelocation did not work:  in response to her continued political activism, police stopped her on the \nstreet, called her by her name, and informed her that the next time they saw her they would take \nher into custody.  It became clear to G.R. that the authorities intended to arrest her for her political \nbeliefs, and that she would likely be tortured and raped in prison if she did not flee.  Accordingly, \nG.R. departed Nicaragua seeking refuge from persecution.  She was apprehended crossing the \nsouthern border into the United States other than at a port of entry on or about November 13, 2018. \n22.  Defendant Donald J. Trump is the President of the United States.  On November 9, \n2018, he issued the Proclamation.  He is sued in his official capacity. \n23.  Defendant Matthew G. Whitaker was appointed to the position of Acting Attorney \nGeneral of the United States (“Acting Attorney General”) on November 7, 2018.  The Attorney \nGeneral is responsible for administering the INA, oversees the Executive Office for Immigration \nReview (“EOIR”), and is empowered by statute to grant asylum or any other relief.  He is sued in \nhis official capacity. \n24.  Defendant Kirstjen M. Nielsen is the Secretary of DHS (“the Secretary”).  She \ndirects United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”), United States Citizenship \nand Immigration Services (“USCIS”), and United States Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”).  \nShe is sued in her official capacity.   \n25.  Defendant Lee Francis Cissna is Director of USCIS, which is the agency that \nemploys the Asylum Officers who conduct credible fear screening interviews to determine whether \nindividuals may apply for asylum before an immigration judge.  He is sued in his official capacity. \n26.  Defendant John Lafferty, the Asylum Division Chief within USCIS, is responsible \nfor overseeing the credible fear screening process and asylum adjudication within USCIS.  He is \nsued in his official capacity.  \n \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 40   Filed 12/18/18   Page 8 of 37\n \nNATURE OF ACTION \n27.  This is an action arising under the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 \nU.S.C. § 1101 et seq., and the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 551 et seq.   \n28.  Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the interim final rule entitled “Aliens \nSubject to a Bar on Entry Under Certain Presidential Proclamations; Procedures for Protection \nClaims,” 83 Fed. Reg. 55,934 (Nov. 9, 2018) is arbitrary, capricious, contrary to law, and beyond \nthe authority of the Acting Attorney General and the Secretary to promulgate under the APA and \notherwise.  Plaintiffs further seek an injunction prohibiting Defendants from enforcing the Rule \nand such additional and other relief as is just and proper.   \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n29.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, as the claims in this case arise \nunder federal statutes, including the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq., and the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 701 et \nseq.    Specifically,  this  Court  has  jurisdiction  to  review  Plaintiffs’  claims  that  the  Rule  is \ninconsistent with the INA and thus ultra vires to it. \n30.  This Court further has jurisdiction to review this case as a challenge to changes in \nthe expedited removal process under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3).  Although courts generally lack \njurisdiction to review challenges to the expedited removal process, judicial review under § 1225(b) \nis available to determine if any regulation issued to implement such section is constitutional or \nwhether such regulation is otherwise in violation of law.  This case falls squarely within this \nstatutory exception.  Plaintiffs present a challenge to the “validity of the system” for expedited \nremoval. See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3).  The Rule and Proclamation are each a “written policy \ndirective, written policy guideline, or written procedure” issued to implement the expedited \nremoval procedures set forth in 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b).  And Plaintiffs assert that the Rule and \nProclamation impose changes to the expedited removal and credible fear system that are “not \n \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 40   Filed 12/18/18   Page 9 of 37\n \nconsistent with applicable provisions of [8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1)],” and “otherwise in violation of \nlaw.”  Id. § 1252(e)(3)(A)(ii). \n31.  The declaratory, injunctive, and other relief sought by Plaintiffs are authorized by \n28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202.   \n32.

Congress enacted the Refugee Act of 1980 to “bring United States refugee law into \nconformance” with international law, as outlined under the United Nations Convention Relating \nto the Status of Refugees and the 1967 United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees.  \nINS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 436–37 (1987).   \n34.  Among the treaty obligations undertaken by the United States was the promise that \nthe  “Contracting  States  shall  apply  the  provisions  of  this  Convention  to  refugees  without \ndiscrimination as to race, religion or country of origin.”  Convention Relating to the Status of \nRefugees art. 3, July 28, 1951, 19 U.S.T. 6259, 189 U.N.T.S. 150.1  Further, “[c]ontracting States \nshall not impose penalties, on account of their illegal entry or presence, on refugees who, coming \ndirectly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of Article 1, enter \n                                                            \n1 The text of the Convention is available online at http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/3b66c2aa10. \n \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 40   Filed 12/18/18   Page 10 of 37\n \nor are present in their territory without authorization, provided they present themselves without \ndelay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence.”  Id. at art. 31(1).  \nThis prohibition against restricting asylum access based on manner of entry is reiterated in the \nIntroductory Note to the Refugee Convention, which states:  “The Convention further stipulates \nthat, subject to specific exceptions, refugees should not be penalized for their illegal entry or stay. \nThis recognizes that the seeking of asylum can require refugees to breach immigration rules.”  Id. \nat Introductory Note. \n35.  The INA is the embodiment of these international law obligations.  Its instructions \nregarding the asylum process are clear:  “Any alien who is physically present in the United States \nor who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port of arrival and including \nan alien who is brought to the United States after having been interdicted in international or United \nStates waters), irrespective of such alien’s status, may apply for asylum in accordance with this \nsection or, where applicable, section 1225(b) of this title.”  8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1) (emphases \nadded). \n36.  While asylum is ultimately a discretionary remedy within the parameters set by \nstatute, the duty to allow a noncitizen access to the process for seeking asylum is not discretionary, \nas the U.S. government has recognized.  See, e.g., Federal Defendant’s Reply Brief in Support of \nMotion for Summary Judgment and Dismissal for Lack of Jurisdiction, cited in Munyua v. United \nStates,  2005  U.S.  Dist.  LEXIS  11499,  at  *16–19  (N.D.  Cal.  Jan. 10,  2005)  (“[D]efendant \nacknowledges  that  [the  immigration  officers]  did  not  have  the  discretion  to  ignore  a  clear \nexpression of fear of return or to coerce an alien into withdrawing an application for admission.”). \n37.  For a noncitizen to be eligible for asylum, the noncitizen must establish that he or \nshe is a refugee under the INA, defined as follows:   \n \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 40   Filed 12/18/18   Page 11 of 37\n \n[A]ny person who is outside any country of such person’s nationality or, in the case of a \nperson having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually \nresided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail \nhimself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-\nfounded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a \nparticular social group, or political opinion. \n \n8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); see id. § 1158(a)(1).   \n \n38.  To demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution, a noncitizen need not show that \nharm is certain or even more likely than not; a 1 in 10 chance of persecution is sufficient under \nU.S. Supreme Court precedent.  See Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 430. \nExpedited Removal and Credible Fear \n39.  In  1996,  Congress  passed  the  Illegal  Immigration  Reform  and  Immigrant \nResponsibility Act (“IIRIRA”), which created an expedited removal process for immigration \nofficials to deport certain individuals deemed inadmissible under the INA.   \n40.  Out of a concern that expedited removal would prevent individuals from seeking \nand applying for asylum—and thereby abrogate the United States’ obligations under domestic and \ninternational law—IIRIRA implemented the “credible fear” screening process to ensure that \nindividuals subject to expedited removal proceedings would be given meaningful access to the \nasylum process. \n41.  Under those provisions, if a noncitizen facing expedited removal indicates any fear \nof returning to his or her home country, an immigration officer must refer the asylum seeker for a \n“credible fear” interview.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(4).  This interview \nis designed to “elicit all relevant and useful information bearing on whether the applicant has a \ncredible fear of persecution or torture.”  8 C.F.R. § 208.30(d). \n42.  To  satisfy  the  credible  fear  standard,  an  asylum  seeker  need  only  show  a \n“significant possibility, taking into account the credibility of the statements made by the noncitizen \n \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 40   Filed 12/18/18   Page 12 of 37\n \nand in support of the noncitizen’s claim and such other facts as are known to the officer, that the \nnoncitizen could establish eligibility for asylum.”  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v).  The standard used \nin this initial screening is intentionally lower than the standard used in the full asylum hearing that \nthe applicant will later undergo if he or she passes the credible fear interview.  The intentionally \nlow threshold for demonstrating a credible fear accounts for the reality that credible fear interviews \ntypically take place shortly after asylum seekers have completed their often traumatic journeys to \nthe United States, in border processing centers or detention facilities where asylum seekers \ntypically do not have access to attorneys.  The standard also acknowledges that many asylum \nseekers arrive in the United States without the time, resources, or expertise to develop fully, upon \narrival, the evidence necessary to prevail on their ultimate asylum application. \n43.  The credible fear process includes another important limitation.  Recognizing the \nabbreviated nature of these interviews, if a person meets the definition of a refugee but may be \nsubject to a bar to asylum, officers are required to flag those potential bars for future adjudication, \nbut to refer the applicant for full removal proceedings.  See 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(e)(5).      \n44.  The  requirement  to  refer  an  asylum  seeker  subject  to  expedited  removal \nproceedings to an asylum officer for a credible fear interview is mandatory.  See 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii) (immigration officer “shall refer the [noncitizen] for an interview by an asylum \nofficer” (emphasis added)); 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(4) (“[T]he inspecting officer shall not proceed \nfurther with removal of the [noncitizen] until the [noncitizen] has been referred for an interview \nby an asylum officer.” (emphasis added)). \n45.  If an applicant is found by an asylum officer to have a credible fear of persecution \nor torture, the applicant is taken out of the expedited removal process and placed in the regular \nremoval process.  The applicant thus obtains the ability to develop a full record in support of his \n \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 40   Filed 12/18/18   Page 13 of 37\n \nor her asylum claim; the right to present that claim before an immigration judge at a trial-like \nhearing; and the ability to appeal an adverse decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals and a \nfederal court of appeals.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii). \n46.  The newly promulgated Rule and the accompanying Proclamation upend this \ndetailed statutory scheme.  Under the Rule, asylum seekers who enter without inspection from \nacross  the  U.S.–Mexico  border  are  barred  from  obtaining  asylum  and  may  only  apply  for \nwithholding of removal or relief under the Convention Against Torture (“CAT”).  Obtaining either \nof these forms of relief requires satisfying a different standard than credible fear interviews, \nrequiring an individual to demonstrate a “reasonable possibility” of persecution “on account of” a \nprotected ground.  This “reasonable fear” standard is significantly higher than the credible fear \nstandard.  That is so because the reasonable fear screening standard is the same standard required \nto establish a “well-founded fear” of persecution in the asylum context.  The credible fear standard, \non the other hand, requires only a showing of a significant possibility that the well-founded fear \nwill be established.  \n47.  Moreover, unlike asylum, withholding of removal and CAT protection do not \nprohibit the government from removing the noncitizen to a third country; do not create a path to \nlawful permanent resident status and citizenship; do not allow the noncitizen to travel freely within \nthe United States or internationally; and do not ensure family unity by permitting a noncitizen’s \nfamily members to obtain lawful immigration status derivatively. \n48.  The Government contends that Plaintiffs are subject to the new Proclamation and \nRule; Plaintiffs are suffering irreparable harm as a result.  Plaintiffs suffered persecution that their \nhome country’s government was unwilling and unable to stop, and have come to the United States \nto seek refuge.  The Proclamation and Rule effectively prevent Plaintiffs from applying for asylum \n \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 40   Filed 12/18/18   Page 14 of 37\n \nand the benefits that come with it, and place Plaintiffs at high risk of being returned to the country \nthat perpetrated or sanctioned their oppression. \nImplementation of “Zero-Tolerance” Immigration Policy \n49.  In April 2018, the U.S. government began implementing a “zero-tolerance” policy \non immigration.  In announcing the policy, then-Attorney General Jefferson B. Sessions III stated \nwithout  any  evidence  that  “[t]he  situation  at  our  Southwest  Border  is  unacceptable,”  and \n“necessitate[d] an escalated effort to prosecute those who choose to illegally cross our border.”2  \nMr.  Sessions  continued:    “To  those  who  wish  to  challenge  the  Trump  Administration’s \ncommitment to public safety, national security, and the rule of law, I warn you:  illegally entering \nthis country will not be rewarded, but will instead be met with the full prosecutorial powers of the \nDepartment of Justice.” \n50.  In  accordance  with  this  directive,  the  U.S.  government  took  steps  to  deter \nimmigration at the southern border, such as referring greater numbers of migrants, including \nasylum seekers, for criminal prosecution, detaining migrants (including children) in inhospitable \nconditions, and encouraging adjudication officers to deny asylum claims. \n51.  The Administration’s “zero-tolerance” policy resulted in the forcible separation of \nchild migrants from their parents, ostensibly so that the government could criminally prosecute the \nparents for illegal entry or reentry.3  Before federal courts enjoined the practice of separating \nfamilies, the Department of Homeland Security had separated over 2,000 children from their \nparents. \n                                                            \n2 DOJ, Attorney General Announces Zero-Tolerance Policy for Criminal Illegal Entry (Apr. 6, \n2018) <https://tinyurl.com/y96nsut6>. \n3 See Miriam Jordan, How and Why “Zero-Tolerance” is Splitting Up Families, N.Y.

The Administration’s “zero-tolerance” policy applied even to asylum seekers.  In \nfact, “zero-tolerance” led to a significant increase in criminal prosecutions of individuals seeking \nsuch protection, including many parents who entered the United States without inspection because \nit was their only means of protecting their children from the persecution faced in their home \ncountries.4 \n53.  Nor did the Administration always permit asylum seekers to seek asylum through \ndesignated ports of entry; the Administration began to employ a policy of “metering” at the U.S.–\nMexico border to keep a caravan of asylum seekers from presenting themselves at the border to \nseek protection.  The existence of this policy was confirmed by the Secretary, who stated in a May \n2018 interview, “We are ‘metering,’ which means that if we don’t have the resources to let them \nin on a particular day, they are going to have to come back.”5  A September 27, 2018 Special \nReview of the Administration’s “zero-tolerance” and family separation policies by DHS’s Office \nof Inspector General (“OIG Report”) similarly acknowledges that the “metering” process involves \nCBP officers standing at the international border line in the middle of the bridges to the ports of \nentry; when an asylum seeker approaches the border line, officers confirm whether space is \navailable and permit them “to enter once there is sufficient space and resources to process them.”6 \n                                                            \n4 See Russell Berman, 85 Immigrants Sentenced Together Before One Judge, THE ATLANTIC, \nJune 19, 2018 <https://tinyurl.com/ydh63e8u>.  The need to escape the persecution they face in \ntheir home countries is frequently cited by asylum seekers as a primary reason for seeking safe \nharbor in the United States.  See generally University of Washington, The Cycle of Violence: \nMigration from the Northern Triangle (2017) <https://tinyurl.com/yabyz9ax> (reporting that the \nincrease of violence in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador between 2011 and 2016 coincided \nwith a doubling of total respondents listing “fleeing violence” as their main reason for migration).   \n5 Fox News, Secretary Nielsen Talks Immigration, Relationship with Trump 03:20 (May 15, 2018) \n<https://tinyurl.com/y8buwakc>. \n6 Dep’t of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General, Special Review - Initial Observations \nRegarding Family Separation Issues Under the Zero Tolerance Policy, at 6 (Sept. 27, 2018) \n \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 40   Filed 12/18/18   Page 16 of 37\n \n54.  Although CBP does not maintain a wait list for those who have been turned away \ndue to metering, some asylum seekers have instituted an unofficial waitlist to keep track of those \nawaiting entry.  CBP will often refer migrants to the unofficial waitlist when metering.  Due to \nmetering, the average wait time for asylum seekers at a port of entry can be up to several weeks.  \nPublic Statements by Defendants \n55.  Public statements by the senior Executive Branch officials and the President both \nbefore  and  after  the  implementation  of  “zero-tolerance”  reinforced  the  basic  theme  of  the \nAdministration’s immigration policy:  to deter any and all immigration.   \n56.  On  October 12,  2017,  then-Attorney  General  Sessions,  in  an  address  to  the \nExecutive Office for Immigration Review, stated, without any evidence:  “We . . . have dirty \nimmigration lawyers who are encouraging their otherwise unlawfully present clients to make false \nclaims of asylum providing them with the magic words needed to trigger the credible fear \nprocess.”7 \n57.  On January 16, 2018, Secretary Nielsen stated, before the U.S. Senate, that “we \nmust tighten [our] case processing standards, including the ‘credible-fear’ standard.”8 \n                                                            \n<https://tinyurl.com/y9rkz2ye>.  The Administration’s claims regarding its limited capacity to \nprocess asylum applications are similarly unfounded.  Senior CBP and ICE officials at the San \nYsidro port of entry stated in interviews “that CBP has only actually reached its detention capacity \na couple of times per year and during ‘a very short period’ in 2017.”  Amnesty International, USA: \n‘You Don’t Have Any Rights Here’: Illegal Pushbacks, Arbitrary Detention & Ill-Treatment of \nAsylum-Seekers in the United States (2018) <https://tinyurl.com/y8k4q54o>.

For his part, President Trump has made no secret of his disdain for the Nation’s \nduly-enacted immigration laws, including the asylum laws: \na.  On June 21, 2018, the President tweeted:  “We shouldn’t be hiring judges by \nthe thousands, as our ridiculous immigration laws demand, we should be \nchanging our laws, building the Wall, hire Border Agents and Ice and not let \npeople come into our country based on the legal phrase they are told to say as \ntheir password.” \n   \nb.  On June 24, 2018, the President tweeted:  “We cannot allow all of these people \nto invade our Country.  When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with \nno Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came.  Our system \nis a mockery to good immigration policy and Law and Order.  Most children \ncome without parents . . . .” \n \nc.  On June 30, 2018, the President tweeted:  “When people come into our Country \nillegally,  we  must  IMMEDIATELY  escort  them  back  out  without  going \nthrough years of legal maneuvering.” \n \nd.  On  July 5,  2018,  the  President  tweeted:    “When  people,  with  or  without \nchildren, enter our Country, they must be told to leave without our Country \nbeing forced to endure a long and costly trial. Tell the people, ‘OUT,’ and they \nmust leave, just as they would if they were standing in your front lawn.” \n \ne.  On October 29, 2018, the President tweeted:  “Many Gang Members and some \nvery bad people are mixed into the Caravan heading to our Southern Border. \nPlease go back, you will not be admitted into the United States unless you go \nthrough the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military \nis waiting for you!” \n \nf.  On November 1, 2018, President Trump delivered a speech regarding asylum \npolicy.  In that speech, the President again referred to migrants from Central \nAmerica as “an ‘invasion,’” and accused those individuals of using “fraudulent \nor meritless asylum claims to gain entry into our great country.”9   \n \ng.  In the same speech, President Trump attacked the content of the asylum laws \npassed by Congress:  “Think of it.  Somebody walks into our country, reads a \nstatement given by a lawyer, and we have a three-and-a-half-year court case for \none  person.”    The  President  called  the  laws  that  Congress  has  passed \n“incompetent, very, very stupid laws,” and said that the immigration laws are \n“not archaic; they’re incompetent.  It’s not that they’re old; they’re just bad.” \n \n                                                            \n9 Remarks by President Trump on the Illegal Immigration Crisis and Border Security, The White \nHouse (Nov. 1, 2018) <https://tinyurl.com/y9x88wfj>. \n \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 40   Filed 12/18/18   Page 18 of 37\n \n59.  The  foregoing  statements  reflect  a  hostility  amongst  senior  members  of  the \nAdministration  to  the  immigration  system  and  to  asylum  claims,  especially  those  filed  by \nindividuals from Central America.  The statements also demonstrate the Administration’s desire \nto shutter access to asylum by all possible means. \nEffects of the Zero-Tolerance Policy \n60.  As a result of the Administration’s zero-tolerance policy, many migrants who arrive \nat ports of entry on the U.S.–Mexico border are rebuffed and left in limbo on the Mexican side of \nthe border.   \n61.  In recent years, violence in Mexico has increased.  2017 was listed as “the deadliest \nyear in Mexico,” with 29,168 homicide victims, a 27 percent increase from 2016.10  In January \n2018, the U.S. State Department issued a Level Four, “Do not travel” warning—the highest-level \ntravel  warning—for  the  state  of  Tamaulipas,  which  incorporates  Reynosa,  Matamoros,  and \nNuevo Laredo, three major port of entry sites.11  Many of the other border states, such as \nChihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Sonora, are listed at Level Three, “Reconsider travel,” due \nto high levels of “[v]iolent crime and gang activity.”12 \n62.  The violence faced by migrants and refugees like Plaintiffs while in Mexico is \ndisproportionately high and serious.  They face grave risks of kidnapping, disappearances, sexual \nassault, trafficking, and other harms in Mexico’s northern border region.  They are targeted not \n                                                            \n10  Human  Rights  First,  Mexico:    Still  Not  Safe  for  Refugees  and  Migrants  (Mar.  2018) \n<https://tinyurl.com/y8b6flak>. \n11 U.S. Dep’t. of State, Mexico Travel Advisory <https://tinyurl.com/ycpn4cxr> (“Violent crime, \nsuch as murder, armed robbery, carjacking, kidnapping, extortion, and sexual assault, is common. \nGang activity, including gun battles, is widespread. . . .

Additionally, they have limited or no financial \nresources or contacts in the region.  \n63.  Long wait times for access to ports of entry—times which will only increase under \nthe Rule—leave asylum-seekers especially vulnerable.  Cartels and other criminal organizations \nprey on migrants in border towns and near ports of entry, with cartel members often waiting \ndirectly outside some ports of entry.13  As a result, “evidence of mass graves and disappearances \nin Mexico suggest disproportionate killing of non-Mexican migrants.”14  Attorneys and employees \nof migrant shelters in Reynosa, Mexico, report that “most—if not all—migrants they encounter \nwho had been turned away from the port of entry have been kidnapped and held for ransom.”15  \nAnd with migrant shelters frequently at capacity, many asylum-seekers have no other choice but \nto sleep on the streets or on the bridge itself while they await access to a port of entry.  \n64.  The Administration’s policy of “metering” has also created strong incentives for \nlegitimate asylum seekers to cross the border other than at authorized ports of entry.  DHS’s recent \nOIG Report confirmed this reality.  The OIG reported “evidence that limiting the volume of \nasylum-seekers entering at ports of entry leads some aliens who would otherwise seek legal entry \ninto the United States to cross the border illegally.

On November 9, 2018, Defendants enacted the next phase of their “zero-tolerance” \npolicy aimed at significantly reducing the availability of asylum. \n66.  The process began when Acting Attorney General Whitaker and the Secretary \npromulgated the Rule.  The Rule makes three main changes to asylum law.   \na.  First,  the  Rule  provides  that  noncitizens  who  apply  for  asylum  after \nNovember 9, 2018 will be ineligible for asylum if they are “subject to a \npresidential proclamation or other presidential order suspending or limiting the \nentry of aliens along the southern border with Mexico that is issued pursuant to \nsubsection 212(f) of 215(a)(1) of the Act on or after November 9, 2018” and \nhave entered the United States contrary to the terms of the proclamation or \norder.    See  Rule,  83  Fed.  Reg.  at  55,952  (to  be  codified  at  8  C.F.R. \n§§ 208.13(c)(3), 1208.13(c)(3)).   \nb.  Second, the Rule provides that noncitizens who are ineligible for asylum \npursuant to §§ 2018.13(c)(3) and 1208.13(c)(3) will not be permitted to make a \nshowing  of  “credible  fear”  of  persecution,  as  noncitizens  seeking  asylum \npresently may do.  Under the Rule, a noncitizen’s request for asylum is, from a \n                                                            \n16 OIG Report, supra note 6, at 7. \n17 Id. at n.15. \n \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 40   Filed 12/18/18   Page 21 of 37\n \nmerits standpoint, summarily denied, because the asylum officer is directed to \n“enter  a  negative  credible  fear  determination  with  respect  to  the  alien’s \napplication  for  asylum.”    The  noncitizen  instead  will  be  placed  into \n“proceedings under section 240 of the Act for full consideration of the alien’s \nclaim for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act, or for \nwithholding or deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture if the \nalien establishes a reasonable fear of persecution or torture.”  Id. (to be codified \nat 8 C.F.R. § 208.30). \nc.  Third, the Rule provides for what an immigration judge is to do with respect to \nthe  review  of  expedited  removal  orders  following  a  negative  credible  or \nreasonable fear assessment.  The Rule provides that an immigration judge is to \nreview de novo the determination that a noncitizen falls within the scope of a \nPresidential  proclamation  that  is  described  in  8  C.F.R.  § 208.13(c)(3)  or \n§ 1208.13(c)(3).  If the immigration judge determines that the noncitizen is not \nsubject to a proclamation, then the asylum officer’s finding will be vacated and \nDHS may commence removal proceedings under Section 240 of the INA.  If \nthe judge agrees that the noncitizen is subject to a proclamation, the judge will \nthen review the asylum officer’s determination that the noncitizen lacks a \nreasonable fear of persecution pursuant to the procedures set forth in 8 C.F.R. \n§ 1208.30(g)(2). \n67.  Put more succinctly, together the Rule and Proclamation prohibit anyone from \nobtaining asylum if they cross outside of a port of entry and make it more difficult for those people \n \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 40   Filed 12/18/18   Page 22 of 37\n \nto obtain other forms of relief.  At the same time, as detailed above, the Administration has made \nit untenable for many, if not most, noncitizens to apply for asylum at a port of entry.   \n68.  In support of the Rule, the Acting Attorney General and the Secretary cited 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1158(b)(2)(C), which authorizes the Attorney General to “by regulation establish additional \nlimitations and conditions, consistent with [the remainder of Section 1158], under which an alien \nshall be ineligible for asylum.”  The Acting Attorney General and the Secretary also relied on 8 \nU.S.C. § 1158(d)(5)(B), which provides that the Attorney General may “provide by regulation for \nany  other  conditions  or  limitations  on  the  consideration  of  an  application  for  asylum  not \ninconsistent with this chapter.”  None of the other “limitations and conditions” on asylum that are \npresent in Section 1158 relate to manner of entry, and a bar to asylum based on manner of entry is \ncontrary to the plain language of Section 1158.  \n69.  The Acting Attorney General and the Secretary acknowledged that in the previous \nyear 1,889 migrants from the Northern Triangle (i.e., Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador), \nrepresenting nearly 25% of those whose asylum applications were adjudicated on the merits, had \nbeen granted asylum.  See Rule, 83 Fed. Reg. at 55,946.  They further acknowledged that “[s]ome \nof those asylum grants would become denials for aliens who became ineligible for asylum” under \nthe Rule.  Id. at 55,948.    \n70.  Although the APA requires an agency to allow for a period of public notice and \ncomment (as well as a 30-day waiting period) before implementing a proposed regulation, see 5 \nU.S.C. §§ 553(b), (c), (d), the Rule became effective upon its publication.  In explaining why they \nfailed to follow the ordinary rulemaking process, DOJ and DHS claimed that “good cause” existed \nto bypass those procedures under 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(B).  DOJ and DHS also invoked the “foreign \naffairs” exception to the notice and comment requirement set forth in 5 U.S.C. § 553(a)(1). \n \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 40   Filed 12/18/18   Page 23 of 37\n \n71.  Also on November 9, 2018, President Trump issued the Proclamation pursuant to \n8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(f) and 1185(a).  The Proclamation provides that entry of “any alien” into the \nUnited  States  across  the  international  boundary  between  the  United  States  and  Mexico  is \n“suspended and limited” for a period of 90 days, Proclamation § 1, at which point the President \nwill decide whether to extend the suspension period, id. § 2(d).  The suspension of entry applies \nto aliens who enter the United States after the date of the Proclamation, and does not apply to “any \nalien who enters the United States at a port of entry and properly presents for inspection, or to any \nlawful permanent resident.”  Id. §§ 2(a), (b). \n72.  In the Proclamation, President Trump openly prejudged asylum claims of intending \nmigrants; he specifically stated that the Proclamation was meant to bar access to asylum for Central \nAmericans, who, according to the President’s unsupported say-so, “have no lawful basis for \nadmission into our country.” \n73.  Taken together, the Rule and Proclamation eliminate asylum for a person who \nenters the United States along the southern border other than at a port of entry, even if she has a \ncredible fear of persecution if returned to her home country and even if she ultimately crosses other \nthan at a port of entry because “metering” or other delays at a port of entry have exhausted her \nfinancial resources or expose her to a continuing threat of crime and violence at the Mexican \nborder.  \n74.  The Administration purported to justify the Rule and Proclamation by citing “an \nurgent situation at the southern border.”  Rule, 83 Fed. Reg. at 55,944.  Contrary to assertions \ncontained in the Rule, however, the available data show that migration across the U.S.–Mexico \n \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 40   Filed 12/18/18   Page 24 of 37\n \nborder has, in fact, decreased since 2016.18  In 2017, the number of people apprehended by border \nofficials after crossing irregularly was the lowest it has been in 46 years.19   \n20 \n75.  According to CBP, when compared to 2016, there were, at the southern border, \nmore than 60,000 fewer apprehensions of undocumented aliens from Mexico in 2017, and more \n                                                            \n18 Douglas Massey, Today’s US–Mexico ‘Border Crisis’ in 6 Charts, THE CONVERSATION (Jun. 27, \n2018) <https://tinyurl.com/ycn4czpl>; see also Max Bearak, Even Before Trump, More Mexicans \nWere Leaving the U.S. Than Arriving, WASH.

While President Trump in the Proclamation has taken the position that only a \n“fraction” of asylum applicants who crossed the U.S. border have valid claims for asylum \n(“fraction” meaning less than 100%), thousands of refugees from Northern Triangle countries were \nfound to have valid claims for asylum in 2016 alone.  In 2016, 2,157 people from El Salvador, \n1,505 from Honduras, and 1,949 from Guatemala were found by U.S. asylum officers and \nimmigration judges to be eligible for asylum.23  According to DHS’s own statistics, El Salvador \nand Guatemala were two of the three most common countries of nationality of people affirmatively \ngranted  asylum  in  the  United  States  in  2016—the  third  being  China—while  El  Salvador, \nGuatemala, and Honduras were three of the four most common countries of nationality of persons \ngranted asylum defensively in immigration court, the fourth, again, being China.24 \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n77.

Plaintiff G.Z. brings the below Count 3 challenging the illegal Rule on his own \nbehalf and on behalf of a subclass comprised of all noncitizen asylum-seekers from a non-\ncontiguous country who are found to be unaccompanied minors by the immigration authorities, \nwho have or will have entered the United States through the southern border, without inspection, \non or after November 10, 2018, excepting those who are barred from seeking asylum due to a \nreinstatement order entered under 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(5). \n79.  The prerequisites of Rule 23(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are satisfied.  \nThe proposed class and subclass consist of thousands of persons who have crossed the southern \nborder since November 10, 2018, and have either gone into hiding to avoid detection, presented \noutside a port of entry and been detained, or presented and been released pending further \nimmigration proceedings, rendering joinder of all class members impracticable.  The lawfulness \nof the Rule presents legal and factual questions that are common to the class and subclass.  The \nProposed Class Representatives’ claims are typical of the class, given that the Rule implements a \ncategorical bar on asylum eligibility equally applicable to all class and subclass members.  The \nProposed Class Representatives will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the proposed \nclass and subclass.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1)–(4).   \n80.  The Proposed Class Representatives are willing and able to represent the proposed \nclass and have every incentive to pursue this action to a successful conclusion.  The Proposed \n \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 40   Filed 12/18/18   Page 27 of 37\n \nClass Representatives—like the members of the class and subclass—uniformly face application of \nthe Rule, which will prevent the Proposed Class Representatives and the class members alike from \npursuing their asylum claims.  The Proposed Class Representatives seek injunctive and declaratory \nrelief that would bar the application of the Rule.  If the Proposed Class Representatives succeed in \nobtaining this relief, it will ameliorate the harm that the Rule is causing to each class member.  \nAccordingly, there is no conflict of interest between the Proposed Class Representatives and the \nmembers of the class they seek to represent. \n81.  The Proposed Class Representatives have retained counsel who are experienced in \nclass action, civil rights, and immigrants’ rights litigation.  Plaintiffs’ counsel will fairly and \nadequately represent the interests of the class. \n82.  The named Defendants have implemented a Rule that uniformly revokes asylum \neligibility for all members of the proposed class and subclass.  They have acted on grounds that \napply generally to the proposed class and subclass, such that final injunctive or declaratory relief \ninvalidating the Rule would restore the rights of the proposed class and subclass as a whole.  See \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \nCOUNTS \nCLASS ACTION COUNT ONE \n \nVIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT: \nRULEMAKING CONTRARY TO LAW (8 U.S.C. § 1158) \n \n83.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 82.   \n84.  The Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1), gives any noncitizen \nwho is physically present in or who arrives in the United States a statutory right to seek asylum, \nregardless of that individual’s immigration status and manner of entry.    \n \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 40   Filed 12/18/18   Page 28 of 37\n \n85.  By barring the plaintiffs from obtaining asylum based solely on the manner in \nwhich they entered the United States, the Rule violates the INA, which prohibits penalizing \nrefugees for entering the country illegally and other than at a port of entry. \n86.  Under the Administrative Procedure Act, a court “shall hold unlawful and set aside \nagency action, findings, and conclusions found to be . . . not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. \n§ 706.    \n87.  The Rule is not in accordance with 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1).  The Rule is therefore \ncontrary to law under the APA. \n88.  Plaintiffs have been harmed as a result of Defendants’ violations of the INA and \nthe APA.  In particular, Plaintiffs have been denied a meaningful opportunity to seek asylum, \nexposing them to multiple other harms including the threat of removal to their home countries and \nthe persecution from which they fled.  The Rule also deprives Plaintiffs of other benefits to which \nasylees are entitled.  The harm to Plaintiffs is irreparable. \n89.  Plaintiffs do not have an adequate remedy at law to redress the violations alleged \nherein, and therefore seek injunctive relief restraining Defendants from continuing to engage in \nthe unlawful policy and practices alleged herein. \nCOUNT TWO \n \nVIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT: \nRULEMAKING CONTRARY TO LAW (8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)) \n \n90.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 89.   \n91.  The Immigration and Nationality Act, including 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1) (expedited \nremoval) and 8 U.S.C. § 1158 (asylum), affords noncitizens an opportunity to apply for asylum, \nby screening arriving noncitizens to determine whether their asylum claims are potentially viable.   \n \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 40   Filed 12/18/18   Page 29 of 37\n \n92.  Expedited removal procedures apply to certain noncitizens, including noncitizens \nwho lack proper travel documents and either arrive at a port of entry or are apprehended within 14 \ndays of their arrival and within 100 miles of the U.S. international border.  See 69 Fed. Reg. 48,877 \n(Aug. 11, 2004).  Under expedited removal procedures, an inspecting officer may summarily \nremove certain noncitizens.  However, if the noncitizen expresses a fear of returning to her country \nof origin, the officer is required to refer her to an asylum officer for a “credible fear determination.”  \nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1).   \n93.  By statute, an applicant has a “credible fear of persecution” if she can demonstrate \n“a significant possibility, taking into account the credibility of the statements made by the alien in \nsupport of the alien’s claim and such other facts as are known to the officer, that the alien could \nestablish eligibility for asylum under section 1158 of this title.”  Id. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v). \n94.  Under this Congressional design, a noncitizen in expedited removal proceedings—\nincluding a noncitizen who enters without inspection—should not fail a credible fear interview \nunless there is no significant possibility that that individual would ultimately prevail in her asylum \nclaim.  See 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(e)(5) (citing to 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(c)(3)).  A credible fear interview \nis not an on-the-merits adjudication of the claim.  To the contrary, the credible fear standard of \nreview is intended to be sufficiently low to ensure all bona fide asylum seekers receive a full \nhearing on their claims. \n95.  The Rule mandates a negative credible fear finding for anyone who enters without \ninspection, even in cases where there is a significant possibility that the noncitizen is eligible for \nasylum.  This requirement violates the plain meaning of Section 1225.   \n \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 40   Filed 12/18/18   Page 30 of 37\n \n96.  Immigration  judges  are  mandated  to  follow the same  rules as those that are \napplicable to asylum officers in denying a credible fear finding for asylum seekers who are subject \nto the Rule.  8 C.F.R. § 1208.30(e).  This also violates the plain text of Section 1225. \n97.  The Rule forbids a positive credible fear determination even if an asylum officer or \nan immigration judge determines that there is a “significant possibility” that federal courts will \ndetermine that the individual has a right to seek asylum under the statute notwithstanding the \nregulations, and that the individual otherwise has a significant possibility of winning such a claim.  \nSee id. § 208.30(e)(5); id. § 1208.30(e)(5).   \n98.  Under the Administrative Procedure Act, a court “shall hold unlawful and set aside \nagency action, findings, and conclusions found to be . . . not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. \n§ 706.    \n99.  Defendants’ Rule is “not consistent with applicable provisions” of the asylum and \nexpedited removal provisions and thus is “in violation of law.”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A)(ii).  The \nRule is therefore contrary to law under the APA. \n100.  Plaintiffs do not have an adequate remedy at law to redress the violations alleged \nherein, and therefore seek injunctive relief restraining Defendants from continuing to engage in \nthe unlawful policy and practices alleged herein. \nCLASS ACTION COUNT THREE \n \nVIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT: \nRULEMAKING CONTRARY TO THE TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION \nREAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 \n \n101.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 100.   \n102.  The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Act (“TVPRA”) provides \nspecific asylum protections to children.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1158 (b)(3)(C).  \n \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 40   Filed 12/18/18   Page 31 of 37\n \n103.  Under the TVPRA, unaccompanied children who enter without inspection are \ngenerally not subject to expedited removal provisions.  See id. § 1232(a)(5)(D)(i).  Instead, \nunaccompanied children are placed into regular removal proceedings before an immigration judge \nwithout having to pass a credible fear interview.  Id. \n104.  However, the immigration judge is not the first person to whom an unaccompanied \nminor presents his or her application for asylum.  Instead, the TVPRA provides that “[a]n asylum \nofficer . . . shall have initial jurisdiction over any asylum application filed by an unaccompanied \nalien child.”  Id.   \n105.  Under the TVPRA, if the asylum officer denies the application for asylum, the \nunaccompanied minor then has an opportunity to proceed before the immigration judge. \n106.  This sequencing implements an important objective of the statute.  By allowing an \nunaccompanied child the opportunity to present an asylum claim to an asylum officer in the first \ninstance, the TVPRA ensures that when a child recounts for the first time the traumatic and \nsensitive facts of the persecution underlying a claim for humanitarian protection, he or she may do \nso in a non-adversarial setting.   \n107.  The Rule is contrary to the system established by the TVPRA.  Under the Rule, \nunaccompanied children subject to the Proclamation are ineligible for asylum, and will be subject \nto a mandatory negative credible fear finding.  Because asylum officers do not have authority to \norder withholding of removal or protection under the Convention Against Torture, the asylum \nofficer  will,  under  the  Rule,  have  no  obvious  basis  to  hear  or  assess  the  merits  of  the \nunaccompanied minor’s claims of persecution.  \n108.  As a result, the first time an unaccompanied minor like G.Z. will be permitted to \npresent and obtain any review of the traumatic and sensitive details of a claim for asylum is in the \n \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 40   Filed 12/18/18   Page 32 of 37\n \nadversarial proceeding that occurs before an immigration judge.  The Rule thus upends the non-\nadversarial process mandated by Congress in 8 U.S.C. § 1158 (b)(3)(C).   \n109.  Because Defendants’ actions under the Rule are contrary to the TVPRA, they \nviolate  APA  Section 706(2)(A)  because  they  are  “not  in  accordance  with  law”  and  APA \nSection 706(2)(C) because they exceed Defendants’ statutory authority.   \n110.  Plaintiff G.Z. is irreparably harmed by losing his statutory right to participate in a \nnon-adversarial process before an asylum officer.  Plaintiff G.Z. therefore asks that this Court grant \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief to him and all others who are similarly situated.  \nCLASS ACTION COUNT FOUR \nVIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT:   \nRULEMAKING THAT IS ARBITRARY, CAPRICIOUS, AN ABUSE OF DISCRETION \nAND OTHERWISE CONTRARY TO LAW \n111.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 110.   \n112.  The promulgation of the Rule constitutes agency action by the Acting Attorney \nGeneral and the Secretary that is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and otherwise not in \naccordance with law for a number of reasons.  Among other things, the Rule is irrational and \narbitrary.  It is therefore unlawful under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \nCLASS ACTION COUNT FIVE \n \nVIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT:   \nCONTRARY TO 28 U.S.C. § 508 AND THE APPOINTMENTS CLAUSE \n \n113.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 112.   \n114.  President Trump fired former Attorney General Jefferson B. Sessions III on or \nabout November 7, 2018.  Mr. Sessions therefore was no longer the Attorney General at the time \nthe Rule issued and could not have promulgated the Rule.  \n \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 40   Filed 12/18/18   Page 33 of 37\n \n115.  Defendant Whitaker’s appointment to the position of Acting Attorney General is \ninvalid because it violates the requirements of 28 U.S.C. § 508.  Section 508 requires that “in case \nof a vacancy in the office of Attorney General, or his absence or his disability, the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral may exercise all the duties of the office.”  28 U.S.C. § 508.  If the Deputy Attorney General \nis also unavailable, then the duties “shall” be assumed by the Associate Attorney General and the \nAttorney General may also designate the Solicitor General or the Assistant Attorneys General to \nassume the duties.  Id. § 508(b). \n116.  Because Defendant Whitaker was not the Deputy Attorney General, Associate \nAttorney  General,  Solicitor  General,  or  an  Assistant  Attorney  General  at  the  time  of  his \nappointment to the position of Acting Attorney General, his appointment is invalid under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 508. \n117.  Defendant Whitaker’s appointment to the position of Acting Attorney General is \nalso invalid because it violates the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution, art. II, \n§ 2, cl. 2.   \n118.  The Appointments Clause requires that the President obtain “the Advice and \nConsent of the Senate” before appointing principal “Officers of the United States.”  U.S. Const. \nart. II, § 2, cl. 2. \n119.  The Attorney General, as the chief law enforcement officer of the United States, \nthe head of the Department of Justice, and a Cabinet level official who reports only to the President, \nis a principal officer under the Appointments Clause.  See Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 670–\n77 (1988).  An Acting Attorney General must therefore be appointed by the President and \nconfirmed by the Senate.   \n \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 40   Filed 12/18/18   Page 34 of 37\n \n120.  President Trump did not obtain the advice and consent of the Senate before \nappointing Defendant Whitaker to the position of Acting Attorney General.  Defendant Whitaker’s \nappointment is thus in direct contravention of the Appointments Clause. \n121.   Because Defendant Whitaker lacked authority to promulgate the Rule due to his \nillegal appointment, the Rule is unlawful under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C).   \nCLASS ACTION COUNT SIX \n \nVIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT:   \nCONTRARY TO REQUIREMENT THAT ASYLUM LIMITS BE MADE BY \nREGULATION \n \n122.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 121.   \n123.  Even if Defendant Whitaker’s appointment as Acting Attorney General was lawful, \nthe Rule constitutes agency action in excess of the statutory authority conferred upon him. \n124.  In 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(2)(C), Congress provided that “[t]he Attorney General may \nby Regulation establish additional limitations and conditions, consistent with this section, under \nwhich an alien shall be ineligible for asylum.” \n125.  The  Rule  violates  the  statutory  requirement  that  additional  limitations  and \nconditions  be  established  by  regulation,  because  it  automatically  incorporates,  without \nindependent rulemaking process, the content of unspecified Presidential proclamations, so long as \nthe proclamation includes terms that “suspend[] or limit[] the entry of aliens along the southern \nborder with Mexico” and is issued pursuant to subsection 212(f) or 215(a)(1) of the INA on or \nafter November 9, 2018.    \n126.  The Rule is contrary to the statutory requirement that conditions and limitations on \nthe availability of asylum be established by regulation.  Instead, the Rule constitutes an abdication \n \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 40   Filed 12/18/18   Page 35 of 37\n \nof that responsibility by allowing the President, by proclamation and without a rulemaking process, \nto add or change the conditions and limitations for asylum.   \n127.  The Rule therefore exceeds the Acting Attorney General’s statutory authority under \n8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(2)(C) and is invalid under the APA. \nCLASS ACTION COUNT SEVEN \n \nVIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACTION: \nNOTICE AND PUBLIC COMMENT PROVISIONS \n \n128.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 127. \n129.  The Rule is illegal because the Administration promulgated the Rule without \nproviding the notice and opportunity for public comment set forth in 5 U.S.C. §§ 553(a)–(d).  \nCLASS ACTION COUNT EIGHT \nVIOLATION OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT:  \nULTRA VIRES RULEMAKING \n \n130.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 129. \n131.  The Rule is illegal and so is ultra vires for the reasons provided in Counts One \nthrough Six.  See, e.g., Trudeau v. FTC, 456 F.3d 178 (D.C. Cir. 2006); Aid Ass’n for Lutherans \nv. U.S. Postal Serv., 321 F.3d 1166, 1172, 1175 (D.C. Cir. 2003).   \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court enter judgment in its favor \nand against Defendants, and to grant the following relief: \n  a.  A declaratory judgment (1) that the Rule is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to \nlaw within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706; (2) that Defendant Whitaker’s appointment to the \nposition of Acting Attorney General is unlawful, and the promulgation of the Rule therefore \nconstitutes agency action in excess of the statutory authority conferred upon the office of the \n \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 40   Filed 12/18/18   Page 36 of 37\n \nAttorney General; (3) in the event that the Court determines Defendant Whitaker’s appointment \nwas lawful, that the promulgation of the Rule violates the requirement that additional limitations \non the availability of asylum be established by regulation; (4) that the Rule was promulgated in \nviolation of 5 U.S.C. § 553; and (5) the Rule is ultra vires because it is illegal. \n  b.  Such preliminary injunctive and ancillary relief as may be necessary to avert the \nlikelihood of irreparable harm to Plaintiffs during the pendency of this action, including, but not \nlimited to, temporary and preliminary injunctions; \n  c.  A permanent injunction forbidding Defendants from implementing or enforcing the \nRule;  \n  d.

Plaintiffs  Capital  Area  Immigrants’  Rights  Coalition  (“CAIR  Coalition”), \nRefugee  and  Immigrant  Center  for  Education  and  Legal  Services,  Inc.  (“RAICES”),  and \nS.M.S.R., R.S.P.S., Z.A.G.G., D.A.L.G., L.C.V.R., C.S.C.C., R.G.G., N.A.G.A., A.J.A.C., on \nbehalf of his minor son, A.J.E.A.M., K.P.P.V., R.D.P.V., and Y.A.L.P. (“Individual Plaintiffs”), \non behalf of themselves and a class of all others similarly situated (collectively, “Plaintiffs”), \nbring  this  lawsuit  to  challenge  the  Government’s  categorical  bar  on  asylum  eligibility  for \nindividuals and families entering the United States across the southern border outside designated \nports of entry. \n2.  Our  immigration  laws,  consistent  with  the  United  States’  international  legal \nobligations, reflect Congress’s commitment to aid persons fleeing persecution regardless of their \npoint of entry: “[a]ny alien who is physically present in the United States or who arrives in the \nUnited States,” “whether or not at a designated port of arrival” and “irrespective of such alien’s \nstatus,” has the right to apply for asylum.  8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1). \n3.  On  November  9,  2018,  directly  countermanding  that  and  other  statutory \nguarantees, and without using the notice and comment procedures required by the Administrative \nProcedure  Act  (“APA”),  5  U.S.C.  §  553,  the  Acting  Attorney  General  and  Secretary  of \nHomeland Security issued an interim final rule (the “Rule”) providing that any individuals \nsubject to a presidential proclamation restricting entry through the southern border pursuant to \nImmigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) § 212(f), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f), or INA § 215(a)(1), 8 \nU.S.C. § 1185(a)(1), are ineligible for asylum.  See Aliens Subject to a Bar on Entry Under \nCertain Presidential Proclamations; Procedures for Protection Claims, 83 Fed. Reg. 55,934 \n(Nov. 9, 2018).   \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 4 of 69\n4.  The next day, the President signed a Proclamation1 suspending the entry of all \npersons entering the United States without inspection at the southern border with Mexico.   \n5.  Taken together, the Rule and Proclamation create an unlawful “mandatory bar on \neligibility for asylum,” 83 Fed. Reg. 55,939, that operates against many of those who need it \nmost: migrants fleeing persecution and violence across the southern border of the United States.  \nSuch asylum seekers are disproportionately comprised of women, children, LGBT individuals, \nand other vulnerable populations at risk of violence in their home countries. \n6.  Plaintiffs respectfully ask the Court to issue an order declaring that the Rule and \nProclamation violate the INA, the APA, and the Constitution, and enjoining their enforcement \nand implementation across the United States.   \n7.  Because  Individual  Plaintiffs  are  at  risk  of  deportation,  and  Plaintiffs  CAIR \nCoalition and RAICES also will suffer irreparable harm absent an injunction against the Rule, \nPlaintiffs have moved for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n8.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because \nthis action arises under the U.S. Constitution, the INA, the APA, and other federal statutes.  \n9.  The Court is authorized to award the requested declaratory and injunctive relief \nunder the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202; the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706; the \nMandamus and Venue Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1361; Rules 23, 57, and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure (“Federal Rules”); and the Court’s inherent equitable powers.   \n10.  Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(b)(2), (e)(1).  Upon \ninformation and belief, a substantial part of the events giving rise to this claim occurred in this \n                                                 \n1 “Presidential Proclamation Addressing Mass Migration Through the Southern Border of the \nUnited States” 83 Fed. Reg. 57,661 (Nov. 9, 2018) (the “Proclamation”). \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 5 of 69\nDistrict, including the decision to implement the policy changes challenged in this action.  Each \nindividual Defendant also is an officer of the United States sued in his or her official capacity, \nand the majority of Defendants reside in this District. \n11.  To the extent that Plaintiffs’ claims constitute “[j]udicial review of determinations \nunder [8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)] and its implementation,” jurisdiction and venue also are proper under \n8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3). \nPARTIES \nS.M.S.R. and R.S.P.S. \n12.  Plaintiff S.M.S.R. is a young mother from Honduras seeking asylum in the United \nStates.  S.M.S.R. fled Honduras in October 2018 with her minor son, R.S.P.S., because members \nof the Mara Salvatrucha (“MS-13”) gang repeatedly attacked R.S.P.S. and threatened to kill both \nhim and S.M.S.R. on at least four occasions in the past eight months.  The gang members \nthreatened to kill them because of S.M.S.R.’s refusal to live with the gang as their “wife,” and \nR.S.P.S.’s refusal to join the gang.  S.M.S.R. told the gang that she could not act as their “wife” \nbecause of her Evangelical Christian beliefs.   \n13.  Based on past observation, information, and belief, the police in Honduras would \nnot  help  S.M.S.R.  or  her  son  if  they  reported  MS-13’s  violence  and  threats  against  them.  \nS.M.S.R. has seen police officers receiving payments from gang members and greeting gang \nmembers in a friendly way, despite having received reports of gang-related murders in the area.  \nS.M.S.R. also cannot be safe in other areas of Honduras, because MS-13 took pictures of her and \ntold her they would find her.   \n14.  S.M.S.R. decided to flee Honduras with her son the day after the most recent \ndeath threat that they received from MS-13 gang members in early October 2018.  S.M.S.R. and \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 6 of 69\nR.S.P.S. entered the United States without inspection on November 10, 2018, and were quickly \ndetained by U.S. immigration officials. \n15.  On November 16, 2018, while detained at the South Texas Family Residential \nCenter in Dilley, Texas, S.M.S.R. received an orientation in which she was provided with \ninformation about what a credible fear interview was.  Based on this orientation, she understood \nthat she would receive a “credible fear” interview, and upon a positive result, would be permitted \nto apply for asylum.   \n16.  Plaintiff S.M.S.R. was interviewed by an asylum officer on November 19, 2018.  \nS.M.S.R. confirmed to the asylum officer that she was testifying on behalf of herself and her son, \nR.S.P.S., and that she and her son wanted R.S.P.S. to be included in her claim for asylum \nprotection.  After S.M.S.R. indicated that she had entered outside a port of entry on November \n10, 2018, the asylum officer told S.M.S.R. that she had entered the United States illegally and \nwas ineligible for asylum based on a presidential proclamation and her entry outside a designated \nport of entry.   \n17.  The asylum officer further told S.M.S.R. that she was not eligible for a credible \nfear interview based on the Proclamation, and that the purpose of the rest of the interview was to \ndetermine if she had a reasonable fear of persecution or torture.  S.M.S.R. was confused about \nwhat constitutes a “reasonable fear” and did not receive any orientation on what a reasonable \nfear interview was, or why she could not apply for asylum in the United States.   \n18.  Plaintiff R.S.P.S., the minor son of S.M.S.R., is a boy from Honduras seeking \nasylum in the United States.  R.S.P.S. fled Honduras in October 2018 with his mother, S.M.S.R., \nbecause members of the MS-13 gang repeatedly attacked R.S.P.S. and threatened to kill both him \nand S.M.S.R. on at least four occasions in the past eight months.  The gang members threatened \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 7 of 69\nto kill them because of S.M.S.R.’s refusal to live with the gang as their “wife,” and R.S.P.S.’s \nrefusal to join the gang.  R.S.P.S. cannot do the things that the gang told him he would have to \ndo—including  using  drugs  and  beating  up  and  killing  people—because  of  his  Evangelical \nChristian beliefs.  \n19.  Members of MS-13 have attacked R.S.P.S. three times, leaving him with a scar on \nhis hand and bruises covering his chest and arm.  The day before R.S.P.S. and his mother left \nHonduras, gang members told him that the next time they saw him they would not “warn” him \nagain, and would kill him and his mother.  \n20.  Based on past observation, information, and belief, the police in Honduras would \nnot help R.S.P.S. or his mother if they reported MS-13’s violence and threats against them.  In \nR.S.P.S.’s  experience,  the  police  have  failed  to  respond  to  numerous  gang-related  murders \nreported in his neighborhood in Honduras.  R.S.P.S. also has seen police officers ignore gang \nmembers using drugs in front of them.   \n21.  R.S.P.S. entered the United States without inspection on November 10, 2018 with \nhis mother, and they were quickly detained by U.S. immigration officials.  R.S.P.S. was briefly \nquestioned for “reasonable fear” by the asylum officer following his mother’s interview on \nNovember 19, 2018.  R.S.P.S. told the asylum officer about three incidents of violence he had \nexperienced from MS-13 gang members and that there is nowhere he and his mother could safely \nlive in Honduras. \n22.  Plaintiffs S.M.S.R. and R.S.P.S. received supervised release from detention into \nthe community.  If they are returned to Honduras, both S.M.S.R. and R.S.P.S. fear persecution in \nthe form of torture or death by MS-13 gang members.   \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 8 of 69\n23.  On November 27, 2018, Plaintiffs S.M.S.R. and R.S.P.S. each were served with a \ndocument styled a Notice to Appear (“NTA”) for a hearing under INA § 240.  The documents \nindicated that both S.M.S.R. and R.S.P.S. received positive credible fear determinations, but \nneither document included a date or time for a hearing. \n24.  Plaintiffs S.M.S.R. and R.S.P.S. subsequently were issued Notices of Hearing in \nRemoval Proceedings dated December 15, 2018, setting a hearing for January 3, 2018. \nZ.A.G.G. and D.A.L.G. \n25.  Plaintiff Z.A.G.G. is a mother from Guatemala seeking asylum in the United \nStates.    Z.A.G.G.  fled  Guatemala  in  October  2018  with  her  minor  son,  D.A.L.G.,  due  to \npersecution based on her race and her son’s medical condition.   \n26.  Z.A.G.G. has faced lifelong discrimination and violence on account of being a \nmember of the K’iche indigenous group in Guatemala.  When Z.A.G.G. was thirteen years old, \nshe was raped because she is indigenous.  Her attacker told her that she was dirty and did not \nneed to be treated well because of her race.  On another occasion, villagers threw rocks at her \nface, scarring her chin.  Even Z.A.G.G.’s teachers would pull her hair, kick her, and tell her she \ndid not deserve anything because she belongs to an indigenous group. \n27.  Z.A.G.G. fled Guatemala after non-indigenous people told her that before she \nknew it, she and her son would be dead.  She fears that she and D.A.L.G. will be killed because \none year ago, non-indigenous people in her village murdered an indigenous man for speaking \nK’iche.  Plaintiffs Z.A.G.G. and D.A.L.G. speak some K’iche, particularly with family, and \nZ.A.G.G.’s K’iche noticeably affects the way she speaks Spanish. \n28.  Plaintiff  D.A.L.G.,  the  minor  son  of  Z.A.G.G.,  is  a  two-year-old  boy  from \nGuatemala seeking asylum in the United States.  D.A.L.G. fled Guatemala in October 2018 with \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 9 of 69\nhis mother, Z.A.G.G., because of the persecution he faces on account of his race and his medical \ncondition, a “pigeon chest” that visibly affects the size of his chest and the way he speaks and \nwalks. \n29.  Guatemalan society ostracizes D.A.L.G. because of his pigeon chest.  Members of \nthe community have pushed him and said they do not want him living in their town because he is \nsick.  People refuse to go near D.A.L.G. because of the way his condition affects his gait and \nspeech.  The community hospital in their town refuses to treat D.A.L.G. and Z.A.G.G. because of \ntheir race. \n30.  Based on past observation, information, and belief, the police in Guatemala would \nnot help Plaintiff Z.A.G.G. or her son.  Z.A.G.G. has reported assaults by non-indigenous people \nto the police, but they ignored her because they inferred she is indigenous due to her appearance \nand the way she dresses. \n31.  Z.A.G.G. believes that there is nowhere in Guatemala that she and D.A.L.G. \ncould be safe, because indigenous people face persecution and violence throughout the entire \ncountry.  Nor could they move to an indigenous community; indigenous leaders refuse to talk to \nher and D.A.L.G. because of D.A.L.G.’s medical condition. \n32.  If they are returned to Guatemala, Z.A.G.G. and D.A.L.G. fear persecution in the \nform of torture or death on account of their race and D.A.L.G.’s medical condition. \n33.  Z.A.G.G.  and  D.A.L.G.  entered  the  United  States  without  inspection  on \nNovember 18, 2018, and were quickly detained by U.S. immigration officials. \n34.  Z.A.G.G., on behalf of herself and her son, underwent a credible fear interview by \nan asylum officer on December 4, 2018.   \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 10 of 69\n35.  After  December  4,  2018,  Z.A.G.G.  and  D.A.L.G.  received  documents  styled \nNTAs for further proceedings under INA § 240, indicating that both received positive credible \nfear determinations.  Neither document included a date or a time for a hearing. \nL.C.V.R. and C.S.C.C. \n36.  Plaintiff L.V.C.R. is a mother from El Salvador seeking asylum in the United \nStates.  L.C.V.R. fled El Salvador in October 2018 with her minor son, C.S.C.C., because of \ndeath threats from MS-13 after she witnessed a crime and cooperated with the police. \n37.  Plaintiff C.S.C.C. is a two-year-old boy from El Salvador seeking asylum in the \nUnited States.  C.S.C.C. fled El Salvador in October 2018 with his mother, L.V.C.R., because of \ndeath threats from MS-13 after she witnessed a crime and cooperated with the police. \n38.  In 2014, while L.C.V.R. was walking to a store, she witnessed several members \nof MS-13 commit a massacre.  The gang members saw L.C.V.R. as she ran away.  When the \npolice found out that L.C.V.R. was a witness, they asked her to cooperate.  L.C.V.R. identified \nthree men who committed the murders.   \n39.  The police kept L.C.V.R. in protective custody for several days.  The police told \nL.C.V.R. to move away from her town immediately for her safety, so she moved to an island in \nanother part of El Salvador. \n40.  In September 2018, a policeman told Plaintiff L.C.V.R. that one of the men she \nhad identified was released from prison. \n41.  In October 2018, L.C.V.R. received a call from gang members telling her that she \nand her son would be killed.  They said that because of her, they had been caught by the police, \nand now she would pay the price.   L.C.V.R. also  found out  that gang members from  the \nmainland contacted gang members on the island and told them to kill L.C.V.R. and C.S.C.C. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 11 of 69\n42.  Based on past observation, information, and belief, the police in El Salvador \nwould not help L.C.V.R. or her son.  L.C.V.R. reported the October 2018 death threat to the \npolice, but they told her that they could not help her because they feared for their own lives and \ndid not have the resources to protect her.  L.C.V.R. further knows that the gangs cooperate with \nthe police.  While in protective custody, L.C.V.R. twice heard the police telling gang members \nabout raids so that the gang could avoid them. \n43.  Plaintiff L.C.V.R. believes that there is nowhere in El Salvador that she and \nC.S.C.C. could be safe, because MS-13 found and threatened her even though she had moved to \na different part of the country. \n44.  If  they  are  returned  to  El  Salvador,  Plaintiffs  L.C.V.R.  and  C.S.C.C.  fear \npersecution, torture, or death on account of L.C.V.R. cooperating as a witness against members \nof MS-13. \n45.  L.C.V.R. and C.S.C.C. entered the United States without inspection on November \n18, 2018, and were quickly detained by U.S. immigration officials. \n46.  L.C.V.R., on behalf of herself and her son, underwent a credible fear interview by \nan asylum officer on December 1, 2018.   \n47.  After December 1, 2018, L.C.V.R. and C.S.C.C. received documents styled NTAs \nindicating that both received positive credible fear determinations.  Neither document included a \ndate or a time for a hearing. \nR.G.G. and N.A.G.A. \n48.  Plaintiff R.G.G. is a father from Guatemala seeking asylum in the United States.  \nR.G.G. fled Guatemala in November 2018 with N.A.G.A., whom he considers his minor son, \nafter suffering a lifetime of persecution because he is gay. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 12 of 69\n49.  Plaintiff N.A.G.A. is a two-year-old boy from Guatemala seeking asylum in the \nUnited States.  N.A.G.A. fled El Salvador in November 2018 with R.G.G., who has served as his \nfather, because of persecution R.G.G. faced and death threats that they both received because of \nR.G.G.’s sexual orientation. \n50.  When R.G.G. was nine years old, two brothers in his neighborhood regularly \nraped him over a period of three months.  Approximately three months after the rapes began, \nR.G.G. defended himself with a knife.  In response, the brothers stopped raping R.G.G. but \nthreatened him with death if he ever told anyone about their actions.  Nevertheless, whenever the \nbrothers saw R.G.G., they continued to threaten him and call him homophobic slurs. \n51.  These attacks caused R.G.G. years of fear and depression.  At the age of 15, \nR.G.G. publicly acknowledged that he is gay.  Upon coming out, R.G.G. became increasingly \nisolated from his family and the community in which he grew up.  He left his hometown for \nGuatemala City, where he accepted a position as a waiter.  Shortly after beginning work, he \nlearned that his boss intended to prostitute him.  R.G.G. was forced to perform sex work until he \nwas eighteen years old. \n52.  At age 18, R.G.G. returned to his hometown to go back to school.  But the two \nbrothers who had raped him almost a decade earlier began threatening him again.  Shortly after \nR.G.G. returned home, one of the brothers shot him in the leg.   \n53.  The threats and violence continued for another four years.  In 2018, R.G.G. began \nreceiving threatening letters from the brothers that he needed to pay them extortion demands \nbecause he was gay and needed protection.  The letters also said that if R.G.G. did not pay, the \nbrothers  would  harm  or  kill  N.A.G.A.    The  last  letter  R.G.G.  received,  in  October  2018, \nprompted him to flee Guatemala with N.A.G.A. and seek asylum in the United States. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 13 of 69\n54.  Based on past observation, information, and belief, the police in Guatemala would \nnot help R.G.G. or N.A.G.A. if R.G.G. reported the violence and threats against them.  R.G.G. \nbelieves that the police in Guatemala are corrupt and fail to protect sexual minorities.  Once, \nwhile in police custody, R.G.G. was held down by three police officers and forced to perform \noral sex on another officer. \n55.  R.G.G. believes that there is nowhere in Guatemala that he and N.A.G.A. could \nbe safe, because gay men face persecution and violence throughout the entire country.  Even \nR.G.G.’s own brother told him it would be better to die than to be a gay man. \n56.  If they are returned to Guatemala, R.G.G. and N.A.G.A. fear persecution in the \nform of torture or death on account of R.G.G.’s sexual minority status. \n57.  R.G.G. and N.A.G.A. entered the United States without inspection on November \n17, 2018, and were quickly detained by U.S. immigration officials. \n58.  R.G.G., on behalf of himself and N.A.G.A., underwent a credible fear interview \nby an asylum officer on December 7, 2018.   \n59.  After December 7, 2018, the Department of Homeland Security issued R.G.G. \nand  N.A.G.A.  documents  styled  NTAs  indicating  that  both  received  positive  credible  fear \ndeterminations.  Neither document included a date or a time for a hearing. \nA.J.A.C., on behalf of his minor son A.J.E.A.M. \n60.  Plaintiff A.J.E.A.M. is a nine-year-old boy from Guatemala seeking asylum in the \nUnited States.  A.J.E.A.M. fled Guatemala in November 2018 with his father, A.J.A.C., because \nof persecution they suffered due to their family membership. \n61.  A.J.A.C.  owned  and  ran  a  restaurant  with  his  family.    In  September  2018, \nA.J.A.C.’s wife received an extortion demand from the Mara 18 gang.  The caller demanded that \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 14 of 69\nthe family pay extortion payments to the gang and threatened to kill her and her family if they \nfailed to pay.   \n62.  Approximately one week later, A.J.A.C. received a second phone call demanding \nextortion, again from the Mara 18 gang.  The gang member threatened to kill A.J.A.C. and his \nfamily.  The gang member said that Mara 18 knew the movements of A.J.A.C. and his family.  \nA.J.A.C. received a third phone call from the Mara 18 gang in early October 2018.  The caller \nagain made an extortion demand and again threatened to kill the family. \n63.  A.J.A.C. and his wife changed their phone number and reported the threats to the \nlocal police the day after the third call.  \n64.  In early November 2018, A.J.A.C. witnessed the murder of one of his customers.  \nA.J.A.C. watched as a teenage girl emerged from a gray car, shot A.J.A.C.’s customer ten to \ntwelve times, and then drove away.  A.J.A.C. suspects that other occupants in the car may have \nobserved that he witnessed the murder. \n65.  A.J.E.A.M. is aware of violence perpetrated by gangs in his community.  While \nhe was playing with a friend, A.J.E.A.M. heard the gunshots that killed two people. \n66.  Based on past observation, information, and belief, the police in Guatemala would \nnot help A.J.E.A.M.  A.J.A.C. has heard stories of people who make reports to the police and \nthen are murdered.  A.J.A.C. also stated that the police do not have the resources to protect \neveryone. \n67.  A.J.E.A.M. believes that there is nowhere he will be safe in Guatemala because \nhis family is now a target of the Mara 18 gang, which is pervasive throughout the country. \n68.  If he is returned to Guatemala, A.J.E.A.M. fears persecution in the form of torture \nor death because of his relationship to his family and his family’s failure to pay the extortion \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 15 of 69\ndemands by the Mara 18 gang.  A.J.E.A.M. believes that, because Mara 18 threatened his father \nand mother, they will harm him too. \n69.  A.J.E.A.M.  and  A.J.A.C.  entered  the  United  States  without  inspection  on \nNovember 15, 2018, and were quickly detained by U.S. immigration officials. \n70.  In or around 1998, A.J.A.C. previously had entered the United States.  In 2001, \nA.J.A.C. received a removal order from an immigration judge.  In or around 2005, A.J.A.C. \nvoluntarily left the United States pursuant to his removal order.  \n71.  A.J.A.C. and A.J.E.A.M. underwent  fear interviews by  an  asylum officer on \nNovember  28,  2018.    Because  A.J.A.C.  had  a  prior  removal  order  that  was  reinstated  by \nDefendant DHS, he underwent a reasonable fear interview.  A.J.E.A.M., who has no prior \nremoval order, underwent a credible fear interview.  A.J.A.C.’s reasonable fear interview and \nA.J.E.A.M.’s credible fear interview took place together, at the same time and place, with the \nsame asylum officer.  Both father and son were present in the same room during the interviews, \nwhich generated one set of interview notes. \n72.  After  November  29,  2018,  A.J.E.A.M.  received  a  document  styled  an  NTA \nindicating that he received a positive credible fear determination.  The  document does not \ninclude a date or time for a hearing.  \n73.  On November 30, 2018, Defendants informed A.J.A.C. that he had received a \nnegative reasonable fear determination.  A.J.A.C. reserved his right to have an immigration judge \nreview the negative reasonable fear finding, and is awaiting a court date. \nK.P.P.V. and R.D.P.V. \n74.  Plaintiff K.P.P.V. is a mother from Honduras seeking asylum in the United States.  \nK.P.P.V. fled Honduras in November 2018 with her minor daughter, R.D.P.V., because of death \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 16 of 69\nthreats from an arms and drug trafficking gang, called Los Gaidos, for which her ex-partner \npreviously worked. \n75.  Plaintiff R.D.P.V. is a seven-year-old girl from Honduras seeking asylum in the \nUnited States.  R.D.P.V. fled Honduras in November 2018 with her mother, K.P.P.V., because of \ndeath threats to both her and her mother from Los Gaidos. \n76.  K.P.P.V.  was  in  a  relationship  with  R.D.P.V.’s  father  from  2009  to  2017.  \nK.P.P.V. left the relationship in 2017 when she discovered that her partner was working for Los \nGaidos. \n77.  In early 2018, R.D.P.V.’s father left Los Gaidos.  In May 2018, K.P.P.V. received \nher first threat from members of Los Gaidos, who were looking for R.D.P.V.’s father.  Two \nmasked men came to her house and threatened to kill her if she did not tell them where he was, \neven though she had not communicated with R.D.P.V.’s father and did not know where he was. \n78.  In November 2018, two members of Los Gaidos returned and told K.P.P.V. that \nthey would kill her and her children if she did not tell them where R.D.P.V.’s father was.  \nK.P.P.V. and R.D.P.V. fled Honduras shortly thereafter. \n79.  R.D.P.V. was present at the house when the men from Los Gaidos made their \nfinal threat.  K.P.P.V. took R.D.P.V. with her to the United States because she was afraid that \nLos Gaidos members would recognize R.D.P.V. \n80.  Based on past observation, information, and belief, the police in Honduras would \nnot help K.P.P.V. or her daughter.  K.P.P.V. reported the threats to the police but they told her \nthat they could not help her, because she did not have specific proof about who threatened her.  \nAdditionally, K.P.P.V. knows of a teenage girl in her town who reported a similar claim against \nLos Gaidos to the police and was later murdered. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 17 of 69\n81.  Furthermore, K.P.P.V. believes that the police work with gangs and drug cartels \nlike Los Gaidos.  K.P.P.V. witnessed R.D.P.V.’s father give money to the police multiple times.  \n82.  K.P.P.V. believes that there is nowhere in Honduras that she and R.D.P.V. could \nbe safe, because Los Gaidos is connected to every part of the country.  K.P.P.V. has reason to \nbelieve that Los Gaidos has ties to criminal organizations, the police, and the government in \nother parts of Honduras. \n83.  If they are returned to Guatemala, K.P.P.V. and R.D.P.V. fear persecution in the \nform of torture or death at the hands of Los Gaidos. \n84.  Plaintiffs K.P.P.V. and R.D.P.V. entered the United States without inspection on \nNovember 21, 2018, and were quickly detained by U.S. immigration officials. \n85.  Plaintiffs K.P.P.V. and R.D.P.V. currently are detained at the South Texas Family \nResidential Center in Dilley, Texas.   \n86.  K.P.P.V.,  on  behalf  of  herself  and  her  daughter,  underwent  a  credible  fear \ninterview by an asylum officer on December 18, 2018 and are awaiting their determinations. \nY.A.L.P. \n87.  Plaintiff  Y.A.L.P.  is  sixteen-year-old  unaccompanied  minor  from  Guatemala \nseeking asylum in the United States.  Y.A.L.P. fled Guatemala in November 2018 with her minor \ndaughter, S.E.P.L., because of death threats from gang members who wanted to kill her brother \nfor not joining the gang. \n88.  About a year before Y.A.L.P. fled Guatemala, her brother was being recruited by \na local gang.  He did not want to join the gang because he did not want to rob people.  Because \nhe refused to join the gang, Y.A.L.P.’s brother and her mother received threatening messages.  \nY.A.L.P.’s brother and mother fled Guatemala because of these threats. \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 18 of 69\n89.  After her brother and mother left Guatemala, Y.A.L.P. began receiving threats \nherself.  Gang members left a letter at her house saying that they believed that she was hiding her \nbrother and that she needed to bring him back, or they would kill Y.A.L.P. and her daughter. \n90.  Based on past observation, information, and belief, the police in Guatemala would \nnot help Y.A.L.P. or her daughter.  Y.A.L.P. and her aunt reported the threatening letter to the \npolice immediately, but the policy only copied the letter and recorded something on a computer.  \nY.A.L.P. believes that the police in her community are also afraid of the gangs. \n91.  Y.A.L.P. believes that there is nowhere in Guatemala that she and S.E.P.L. could \nbe safe, because gangs operate throughout the country. \n92.  If she is returned to Guatemala, Y.A.L.P. fears that she and S.E.P.L. will be \npersecuted, tortured, or killed because her brother refused to join a gang. \n93.  After a week and a half in Mexico, Y.A.L.P. and S.E.P.L. arrived at the border but \ndid not know what to do.  Y.A.L.P. asked a boy for help, and she and the boy decided to cross \nthe Rio Grande river together. \n94.  Y.A.L.P. and S.E.P.L. entered the United States without inspection on November \n26, 2018, and were quickly detained by U.S. immigration officials. \n95.  On November 26, 2018, the Department of Homeland Security issued Y.A.L.P. a \ndocument styled an NTA, which did not include a date or a time for a hearing. \nCAIR Coalition \n96.  Plaintiff CAIR Coalition is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit legal services and advocacy \norganization with its principal place of business in the District of Columbia.  CAIR Coalition \nprovides direct legal services to migrant men, women, and children at risk of detention and \ndeportation in the Washington, DC metropolitan area and beyond, including with respect to \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 19 of 69\ncredible  fear  interviews  in  the  course  of  removal  procedures,  asylum  applications,  and \nadversarial proceedings in immigration courts.

Under existing federal law, and consistent with the United States’ international \nlegal obligations, individuals fleeing persecution and violence are entitled to pursue several \nforms of legal protection in the United States. \n112.  These forms of protection include (1) asylum, 8 U.S.C. § 1158; (2) withholding of \nremoval,  8  U.S.C.  § 1231(b)(3);  and  (3)  protection  under  the  Convention  Against  Torture \n(“CAT”), see  Foreign  Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (“FARRA”), Pub.  L. \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 22 of 69\nNo. 105-277, div. G, Title XXII, § 2242, 112 Stat. 2681, 2681-822 (1998) (codified as Note to 8 \nU.S.C. § 1231); 8 C.F.R. § 208.18. \n113.  Modern asylum procedures initially were established in the Refugee Act of 1980, \nPub. L. 96-212, 94 Stat. 102, which revised the INA’s procedures for admission of refugees and \nannounced that “it is the policy of the United States to encourage all nations to provide assistance \nand resettlement opportunities to refugees to the fullest extent possible,” id. § 101(a) (codified as \nNote to 8 U.S.C. § 1521). \n114.  In creating the asylum provisions, Congress sought to bring the United States into \ncompliance with its international obligations under the 1967 United Nations Protocol Relating to \nthe Status of Refugees and the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.  These and \nother international  treaties reflect  the United States’ obligations to  permit  refugees to  seek \nasylum in its borders, to impose no penalties on asylum seekers based on their unlawful status, \nand to prevent the return (or “refoulement”) of individuals to countries where they would face \npersecution or torture. \n115.  In  particular,  Article  31(1)  of  the  Optional  Protocol  provides  that  “[t]he \nContracting States shall not impose penalties, on account of their illegal entry or presence, on \nrefugees who, coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the \nsense of article 1, enter or are present in their territory without authorization, provided they \npresent themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or \npresence.”  Article 33(1) of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the \nOptional Protocol “imposed a mandatory duty on contracting States not to return an alien to a \ncountry  where  his  ‘life  or  freedom  would  be  threatened’”  on  account  of  race,  religion, \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 23 of 69\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.  I.N.S. v. Cardoza-\nFonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 429 (1987) (quoting 189 U.N.T.S. 150, 176 (1954)). \n116.  “Congress imbued these international commitments with the force of law when it \nenacted the Refugee Act of 1980,” and when it subsequently passed the Illegal Immigration \nReform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009, “which \nrefashioned the above principles into their current form” in the INA.  R-S-C v. Sessions, 869 F.3d \n1176, 1178 (10th Cir. 2017).  This “refashioning” in the INA included the modern prohibition on \nwithholding of removal as to individuals threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, \nsocial group membership, or political opinion, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A), 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16, \nand the guarantee that all noncitizens may apply for asylum on the same grounds, 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1158(a)(1).  See R-S-C, 869 F.3d at 1178. \n117.  Specifically, Congress made clear that all noncitizens may apply for asylum, \nregardless  of  how  or  where  they  entered  into  the  United  States.    In  particular,  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1158(a)(1) provides that “[a]ny alien who is physically present in the United States or who \narrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port of arrival and including an alien \nwho is brought to the United States after having been interdicted in international or United States \nwaters), irrespective of such alien’s status, may apply for asylum in accordance with this section \nor, where applicable, section 1225(b) of this title.”  8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1) (emphases added).2   \n118.  Asylum  may  be  granted  to  an  individual  who  has  a  “well-founded  fear  of \npersecution”  on  the  same  five  grounds  enumerated  in  our  international  agreements:  “race, \n                                                 \n2 The Board of Immigration Appeals has held that “an alien’s manner of entry or attempted \nentry . . . should not be considered in such a way that the practical effect is to deny [asylum] \nrelief in virtually all cases.”  Matter of Pula, 19 I. & N. Dec. 467, 473 (BIA 1987). \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 24 of 69\nreligion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.”  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1158(b)(1)(A); id. § 1101(a)(42)(A).   \n119.  An applicant’s testimony is sufficient to sustain her burden to prove such well-\nfounded fear without corroboration if it “is credible, is persuasive, and refers to specific facts” \nsufficient to demonstrate that asylum may be warranted.  Id. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii).  A ten percent \nchance of harm is sufficient to establish a “well-founded fear.”  Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at \n440; see, e.g., Bartolome v. Sessions, 904 F.3d 803, 809 (9th Cir. 2018). \n120.  There are three principal ways in which individuals may seek asylum: \na.  First, where a noncitizen is not in any kind of removal proceedings, her \napplication is “affirmative.”  See 8 C.F.R. § 208.2(a).  She files an application with Defendant \nUSCIS and has an interview with an asylum officer.  Id. §§ 208.3, 208.4, 208.9. \nb.  Second, a noncitizen in ordinary removal proceedings under INA § 240, 8 \nU.S.C. § 1229a, may file a “defensive” application in order to prevent her removal, 8 C.F.R. \n§ 208.2(b).   \nc.  Third, a noncitizen in “expedited removal” proceedings under INA § 235, \n8  U.S.C.  §  1225—which  apply  to  certain  noncitizens  who  arrive  at  ports  of  entry  or  are \napprehended after entering without inspection, see id. § 1225(b)(1)3—also may seek asylum to \nprevent her removal.  If the individual indicates an intention to apply for asylum or a fear of \npersecution during the expedited removal process, she is entitled to a “credible fear” screening \ninterview with an asylum officer.  Id. § 1225(b)(1)(B).  If the officer finds she has a “credible \nfear of persecution,” defined as a “significant possibility” that the alien could establish eligibility \n                                                 \n3 See also Designating Aliens for Expedited Removal, 69 Fed. Reg. 48,877 (Aug. 11, 2004) \n(expedited removal applies to those who entered without inspection and are apprehended within \n14 days of entry and 100 miles of the border). \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 25 of 69\nfor asylum, she is then placed in ordinary removal proceedings under INA § 240 and permitted \nto apply for asylum as part of that process.  Id.; 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(f).  If the officer finds that the \nindividual does not have a credible fear, the officer must provide her with a written notice of \ndecision for review by an immigration judge.  8 C.F.R. § 208.30(g). \n121.  Withholding  of  removal  separately  offers  protection  to  individuals  facing \npersecution on the same five grounds for which asylum is available (race, religion, nationality, \nmembership in a particular social group, or political opinion), 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A), and the \ndomestic implementing legislation for the CAT offers individuals protection against return to \ncountries where they are likely to be tortured,4 see Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act \nof 1998, Pub. L. No. 105–277, § 2242(b) (requiring implementation of CAT); 8 C.F.R. § 208.18. \n122.  Noncitizens may obtain withholding of removal and CAT relief in different ways, \neach of which is defensive: \na.  Noncitizens can raise withholding of removal and CAT relief as defenses \nto ordinary removal proceedings.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3).  The applicant must demonstrate \nthat it “is more likely than not that he would be subject to persecution on one of the [protected] \ngrounds.”  Ling Huang v. Holder, 744 F.3d 1149, 1152 (9th Cir. 2014).  Similarly, to obtain \nCAT relief, an applicant must demonstrate that it is “more likely than not that he or she would be \nwould be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.”  8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(2). \nb.  Alternatively, Defendant DHS has provided by regulation that aliens who \nare ordered removed because they committed aggravated felonies, 8 U.S.C. § 1228, or whose \nremovals are reinstated because they entered unlawfully after a valid removal order, 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1231,  may  avoid  removal  by  showing  a  “reasonable  fear”  of  persecution.    8  C.F.R. \n                                                 \n4 As the Rule recognizes, “[f]ewer than 1,000 aliens per year, of any nationality, receive CAT \nprotection.”  83 Fed. Reg. 55,947. \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 26 of 69\n§§ 208.31(b), 1280.31(b).  To establish such a “reasonable fear” an individual must establish “a \nreasonable possibility that he or she would be persecuted on account of his or her race, religion, \nnationality,  membership  in  a  particular  social  group  or  political  opinion,  or  a  reasonable \npossibility that he or she would be tortured in the country of removal.”   Id. §§ 208.31(c), \n1208.31(c).5  Individuals who show such a reasonable fear are referred to an immigration judge \nfor full consideration of withholding of removal.  Id. §§ 208.31(e), 1208.31(e).6   \n123.  There  is  no  “reasonable  fear”  screening  process  for  noncitizens  subject  to \nexpedited removal.  Such noncitizens only need to show a “credible fear” of persecution or \ntorture to advance to proceedings under INA § 240, in which they may raise claims for asylum, \nwithholding of removal, or CAT relief. \n124.  The INA imposes eligibility restrictions on asylum that it does not impose on \nwithholding of removal and CAT relief.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(A). \n125.  Congress  made  a  variety  of  benefits  available  to  those  who  obtain  asylum, \nincluding a path to U.S. citizenship, id. § 1427(a), and status adjustment from asylee to legal \npermanent resident, id. § 1159(b). \n126.  The spouse and children of a person eligible for asylum likewise are derivatively \neligible for asylum.  Id. § 1158(b)(3)(A). \n                                                 \n5  “‘[T]he  standard  for  showing  entitlement  to  these  forms  of  protection  (a  probability  of \npersecution or torture)’” thus “‘is significantly higher than the standard for asylum (a well-\nfounded fear of persecution).’”  83 Fed. Reg. 55,942 (quoting Regulations Concerning the CAT, \n64 Fed. Reg. 8,485); see also id. (“‘This . . . screening process is modeled on the credible-fear \nscreening process, but requires the alien to meet a higher screening standard.’”). \n6 If an asylum officer concludes that the individual does not present a reasonable fear and \nrequests further review, an immigration judge performs a brief de novo review of the asylum \nofficer’s decision.  8 C.F.R. §§ 208.31(g), 1208.31(g);  Immigration Court Practice Manual, \nch. 7.4(e)(iv)(E).  If the immigration judge concurs with the asylum officer, the case is returned \nto  DHS  for  the  individual’s  removal  without  further  administrative  appeal.    8  C.F.R. \n§§ 208.31(g)(1),  1208.31(g)(1).    If  the  immigration  judge  disagrees,  an  application  for \nwithholding of removal and CAT relief is permitted.  Id. §§ 208.31(g)(2), 1208.31(g)(2). \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 27 of 69\n127.  Asylees  also  are  exempt  from  removal,  id.  § 1158(c)(1)(A),  may  obtain \nemployment authorization in the United States, id. § 1158(c)(1)(B), may travel abroad without \nthe Government’s advance consent, id. § 1158(c)(1)(C), and may obtain public benefits, id. \n§ 1613(b)(1). \n128.  These  status  adjustment  and  family  eligibility  benefits  are  not  available  in \nconnection  with  other  forms  of  relief  for  those  fleeing  persecution  and  violence,  such  as \nwithholding of removal and CAT protection. \nIndividuals and Families Seeking Asylum at the Southern Border \n129.  Those  like  Individual  Plaintiffs  who  arrive  at  the  southern  border  seeking \nasylum in the United States often are fleeing some of the most dangerous countries in the world. \n130.  Many  hail  from  El  Salvador,  Guatemala,  and  Honduras,  often  referred  to \ncollectively as the “Northern Triangle.”  According to a recent report from the United Nations \nHigh Commissioner for Refugees, these countries are experiencing epidemic levels of violence \nat the hands of “well-connected, armed, and dangerous criminal groups in the region,” which \nhave utterly “surpassed the governments’ capacity to respond.”7   \n131.  In  particular,  violence  against  women  by  armed  groups  has  escalated \ndramatically throughout Central America in recent years, and those governments have failed to \nprovide effective protection.8 \n132.  As of 2016, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras ranked first, third, and \nseventh, respectively, for rates of female homicides.9 \n                                                 \n7 See Women on the Run: First-Hand Accounts of Refugees Fleeing El Salvador, Guatemala, \nHonduras, and Mexico at 58, UNHCR (Oct. 2015), https://goo.gl/6hVsam; see also Neither \nSecurity nor Justice: Sexual and Gender-based Violence and Gang Violence in El Salvador, \nHonduras, & Guatemala, KIND (2017). \n8 Anjali Fleury, Fleeing to Mexico for Safety: The Perilous Journey for Migrant Women, United \nNations University (May 4, 2016), https://goo.gl/f8dspH. \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 28 of 69\n133.  In some instances, government actors have been charged with participating in \nsuch  violence.    For  example,  following  a  March  2017  protest  against  sexual  violence  and \nphysical abuse at a Guatemalan government-run children’s shelter, 56 girls were locked inside \nthe shelter and 41 died in a fire, for which state officials were charged.10  Plaintiff R.S.P.S. \nrecalls seeing a news report about another instance in which the Honduran police shot a boy, and \npeople subsequently asking why the police were killing citizens instead of helping them. \n134.  Violence against children likewise is prevalent in the region.  As one example, \nHonduras is a particularly dangerous place for young people: In 2017, it was listed as the single \nmost violent country for children under nineteen years old, with a homicide rate of more than \nthirty children per 100,000 inhabitants (about ten times the global average).11   \n135.  In  particular,  two  rival  gangs  (MS-13  and  Mara  18)  fight  for  control  over \nterritory and recruit in urban and rural areas of Honduras.12  These gangs often target children \nlike Plaintiff R.S.P.S. as their weapons of war, because national anti-gang legislation carries less \nsevere penalties for minors involved in gang activity than for adults.13  These young recruits are \noften forced to collect “taxes” or sell drugs, and those who refuse are often killed,14 while law \nenforcement officers frequently regard them as potential criminals or gang members.15   \n                                                                                                                                                             \n9 Women on the Run at 2, supra. \n10 Fatema Z.

Corruption among Honduran law enforcement also has been widely reported; \nsome police officers themselves work with the gangs, compounding the dangers to citizens.16 \n137.  Reports of violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (“LGBT”) \nindividuals in the Northern Triangle countries also are overwhelming, and frequently ignored by \nstate governments.17  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees found in the course \nof a study that 88% of LGBT asylum seekers and refugees from the Northern Triangle reported \nhaving suffered sexual and gender-based violence in their home countries.18 \n138.  According  to  the  Honduran  non-governmental  organization  Cattrachas,  264 \nLGBT individuals were killed in that country between 2009 and 2017; in most cases, those \nresponsible were never brought to justice.19  \n139.  According to Amnesty International, the “high levels of impunity and corruption \nin [Northern Triangle] countries mean authorities are unlikely to punish those responsible for \ncrimes against LGBT people, particularly when security forces are responsible for the attacks.”20 \n140.  In sum, Individual Plaintiffs and other migrants fleeing to the United States, and \nparticularly from the Northern Triangle countries, often are running from life-or-death situations, \nleaving behind all they have to make a dangerous journey. \n141.  Many of these individuals have legitimate claims  for asylum in  the United \nStates.  According to data published by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, in \n                                                 \n16 Sarah Chayes,  When Corruption is the Operating System: The Case of Honduras at 29, \nCarnegie Endowment for International Peace (May 2017), https://goo.gl/nUFicM (“Of greater \nconcern are the reports we heard in interviews of collusion between police and the youth gangs \nwhose depredations it is their job to curb.”). \n17 See Women on the Run at 27-30, supra. \n18 No Safe Place, Amnesty Int’l at 7 (Nov. 2017), https://goo.gl/dNTUNm. \n19 No Safe Place: LGBTI Salvadorans, Guatemalans and Hondurans Seeking Asylum in Mexico \n(Nov. 27, 2017), https://goo.gl/79cG3H. \n20 Id. \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 30 of 69\nFiscal Year 2015, 82% of the women from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico who \nwere subject to credible fear screenings by asylum officers in the United States were found to \nhave a significant possibility of establishing eligibility for asylum or protection under the CAT.21 \n142.  In a similar 2014 report, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \nfound that 58% of unaccompanied children interviewed from the Northern Triangle countries \nand Mexico were “forcibly displaced because they suffered or faced harms that indicated a \npotential or actual need for international protection.”22 \n143.  Perhaps  the  most  telling  indicator  of  the  extreme  risks  of  persecution  and \nviolence faced by asylum seekers is the fact that they are willing to endure a dangerous journey \nto the United States for an opportunity to press their asylum claims. \n144.  Asylum seekers are at risk of kidnapping, disappearance, trafficking, and sexual \nassault, among other harms, along their journey.  Migrant females are particularly vulnerable. \nData published by Amnesty International estimates that 60% of women and girls are raped while \nmigrating across Mexico, and the estimates of some service providers are higher.23 \n145.  The so-called migrant “caravans” that began making their way to the United \nStates in late 2018 also have included as many as 2,300 children who were exposed to inclement \nweather, dangerously hot temperatures, and limited access to proper shelter, leading some to fall \nill or suffer serious effects of dehydration.24 \n                                                 \n21 See Women on the Run n.2, UNHCR, https://goo.gl/6hVsam. \n22 Children on the Run: Unaccompanied Children Leaving Central America and Mexico and the \nNeed for International Protection at 6, UNHCR (2014), https://goo.gl/p3TGrW. \n23  Alyson  L.

While crossing Mexico to reach the United States itself carries risks, some \nmigrants report that asylum claims have been more difficult to prove to Mexican authorities, that \nthey did not have enough information about protections in Mexico, or that conditions in Mexico \nare sufficiently dangerous that seeking asylum there would not improve their safety.25  Plaintiff \nS.M.S.R., for example, had been told by friends and others that seeking asylum in Mexico would \nbe impossible.   \n147.  Rates of violence in Mexico also have been increasing, with more than 23,000 \nmurder investigations opened in 2017 (the highest count on record).26  Plaintiff S.M.S.R., for \nexample, felt unsafe on numerous occasions while traveling through Mexico with her son. \nObstacles and Risks at Southern Border Ports of Entry \n148.  Upon arrival at the southern border, entry through a designated port is infeasible \nfor many asylum seekers.  Some asylum seekers are unaware that designated ports of entry exist.   \n149.  In other cases, designated ports of entry are difficult to access, causing migrants \nto attempt unauthorized border crossings.  Plaintiff S.M.S.R., for example, had been told that \nentering the United States through a designated port of entry would be difficult. \n150.  Defendant CBP engages in a well-documented practice of “metering,” in which \n“officers only allow the asylum-seeker to cross the [international] line if space is available” in \nthe port of entry.27  “When the ports of entry are full, CBP guidance states that officers should \n                                                 \n25 Fleury, Fleeing to Mexico for Safety: The Perilous Journey for Migrant Women, supra. \n26  Mexico  murders  hit  record  high,  dealing  blow  to  president,  Reuters  (Dec.  23,  2017), \nhttps://goo.gl/524yFF.  \n27 Special Review – Initial Observations Regarding Family Separation Issues Under the Zero \nTolerance Policy, OIG-18-84 at 6, U.S. Office of Inspector Gen.

Advocates have documented substantial delay times and long lines at designated \nports  of  entry  such  as  Nogales,  Arizona;  El  Paso  and  McAllen,  Texas;  and  San  Diego, \nCalifornia.29  Families may be camped out in heat exceeding 100 degrees.30 \n152.  At one point this year, the Nogales, Arizona port of entry had 113 individuals \nwaiting their turn to  present  themselves for asylum.   Only six asylum  seekers were being \nprocessed each day, and the port had a holding capacity of only 47 people.31 \n153.  Advocates  further  reported  instances  in  which  CBP  officers  turned  asylum \nseekers away by claiming “we’re not doing asylum here” or telling migrants the port of entry is \n“full.”32 \n154.  Left stranded while waiting for backlogs at ports of entry to  clear, asylum \nseekers are particularly vulnerable to kidnapping, extortion, and other violence by organized \ncrime elements in northern Mexico.33  A study issued by Human Rights First reported that local \n                                                 \n28 Id. \n29 Adam Isacson et al., “Come Back Later”: Challenges for Asylum Seekers Waiting at Ports of \nEntry at 2-3, Washington Office on Latin Am.

Crossing the border outside of a designated port of entry can become a safety \nimperative in these circumstances. \n156.  A September 2018 report by the U.S. Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) found \nthat asylum seekers were “turned away at some of the ports of entry” that it inspected, and stated \nthat a CBP official had reported that backlogs at ports of entry caused by metering directives and \nthe  Administration’s  “Zero  Tolerance  Policy”  “likely  resulted  in  additional  illegal  border \ncrossings.”35   \n157.  OIG  concluded  that  “[w]hile  the  stated  intentions  behind  metering  may  be \nreasonable, the practice may have unintended consequences.  For instance, OIG saw evidence \nthat limiting the volume of asylum-seekers entering at ports of entry leads some aliens who \nwould otherwise seek legal entry into the United States to cross the border illegally.”36 \n158.  OIG reported that “[a]ccording to one Border Patrol supervisor, the Border \nPatrol sees an increase in illegal entries when aliens are metered at ports of entry.”37   \n159.

By late November 2018, the Government’s “metering” practices had contributed \nto a backlog of thousands of migrants waiting to attempt entry near Tijuana.39  The Mexican \ngovernment opened an open-air sports complex about a mile from the U.S. border to house these \nmigrants while Defendants processed an estimated forty asylum applications per day.40  Migrants \nreported lack of food and water at the facility, as well as exposure to rain and mud.41 \n161.  After customs officials reported that they did  not expect to process asylum \napplications for recently arrived “caravan” members for five to six weeks, migrants organized a \npeaceful protest near the Tijuana border crossing on November 25, 2018.42  The group of \nprotesters, which included women and young children, was dispersed by CBP agents using tear \ngas and pepper spray.43 \nThe Government’s Escalating Responses to Southern Border Migration \n162.

Nonetheless, Defendants have targeted southern border asylum seekers in recent \nmonths with exceptionally strict policies and unlawful regulations.  \n165.  In April 2018, the Administration announced a new “Zero Tolerance” policy on \nimmigration, pursuant to which the Government began separating detained migrant parents and \ntheir children.46 \n166.  Following immense public opposition and political pressure, the “Zero Tolerance” \nfamily separation policy was withdrawn by Executive Order for an indefinite period on June 20, \n2018.47 \n167.  On June 26, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California \nissued a preliminary injunction enjoining the Government from unlawfully detaining migrant \nparents without and apart from their children, and ordered the Government to reunite separated \nfamilies within thirty days, absent a determination of parental unfitness or danger to the child.48 \n168.

In the months preceding the issuance of the challenged Rule, President Trump \nrepeatedly asserted fears of an asylum-seeking “caravan” thousands of miles from the border.   \n170.  Among other such statements, President Trump tweeted that individuals would \n“have to apply for asylum in Mexico first, and if they fail to do that, the U.S. will turn them \naway.”50  On October 31, 2018, the President tweeted a video that contained inflammatory \nfootage depicting an immigrant convicted of murdering police officers followed by a migrant \n“caravan” breaking past a wall.”51 \n171.  President Trump soon after indicated that he intended to sign an executive order \nrestricting asylum. \nThe Rule and Proclamation \n172.  On November 9, 2018, Defendant Whitaker, in his capacity as Acting Attorney \nGeneral, and Defendant Nielsen, in her capacity as Secretary of Homeland Security, promulgated \nthe Rule pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158(b)(2)(C), (d)(5)(B), which give the Attorney General the \npower to  establish by regulation “additional limitations and conditions,  consistent with this \nsection, under which an alien shall be ineligible for asylum,” and “any other conditions or \n                                                 \n49 Id.; Dkt. 321, Case No. 18-cv-0428 DMS (MDD) (S.D.

As set forth above, the INA already guarantees “[a]ny alien who is physically \npresent in the United States or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated \nport of arrival and including an alien who is brought to the United States after having been \ninterdicted in international or United States waters), irrespective of such alien’s status” the right \nto “apply for asylum in accordance with this section or, where applicable, section 1225(b) of this \ntitle.”  8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1). \n174.  The Rule imposes a “new mandatory bar on eligibility for asylum” for “aliens \nwho are subject to a presidential proclamation suspending or imposing limitations on their entry \ninto the United States pursuant to § 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f), or § 215(a)(1) of the \nINA,  8  U.S.C.  § 1185(a)(1),  and  who  enter  the  United  States  in  contravention  of  such  a \nproclamation after the effective date of this rule.”  83 Fed. Reg. 55,939. \n175.  The bar is effected through changes to 8 C.F.R. § 208.13 (aliens ineligible for \nasylum  if,  in  relevant  part,  they  are  the  subject  of  a  presidential  proclamation  under  INA \n§§ 212(f), 215(a)(1)); id. § 1208.13 (same); id. § 208.30 (asylum officers shall enter negative \ncredible fear findings with respect to asylum applications and refer individuals for proceedings \nunder INA § 240 on withholding of removal and CAT claims); id. § 1003.42 (establishing \nlimited  de  novo  review  procedures  by  immigration  judges  regarding  determination  that \nindividuals are subject to the bar under 8 C.F.R. §§ 208.13(c)(3), 1208.13(c)(3)); id. § 1208.30 \n(same, and establishing limited de novo review procedures by immigration judges regarding \nnegative reasonable fear determinations). \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 38 of 69\n176.  The “mandatory bar” applies “prospectively, to aliens who enter the United States \nafter the effective date of such a proclamation,” and where a presidential proclamation concerns \nentry at “the southern border.”  It does not apply in the event that a proclamation expressly \ndisclaims effects on asylum eligibility or contains applicable waivers or exceptions.  83 Fed. \nReg. 55,939; 8 C.F.R. §§ 208.13, 1208.13. \n177.  According to its public notice, the Rule does not limit the ability of individuals to \nbe considered for withholding of removal or CAT protections, 83 Fed. Reg. at 55,947, which \nrequire satisfaction of the higher “reasonable fear” standard. \n178.  Thus, for any individual subject to the new “mandatory bar,” an asylum officer \n“shall enter a negative credible fear determination with respect to the alien’s application for \nasylum” and “place the alien in proceedings under section 240 of the Act” to consider her claim \nfor withholding of removal or protection under the CAT “if the alien establishes a reasonable \nfear of persecution or torture.”  8 C.F.R. § 208.30. \n179.  If such an individual fails to establish a reasonable fear of persecution or torture \nduring her interview with an asylum officer, that officer must provide her a notice of decision \nsubject to limited review by an immigration judge, who likewise will apply the heightened \n“reasonable fear” standard rather than the “credible fear” standard.  Id.  \n180.  According to Procedural Guidance issued by USCIS,52 “aliens cannot be placed in \nproceedings before an immigration judge to determine whether they are entitled to statutory \nwithholding or CAT protection by showing a mere significant possibility that they would be \n                                                 \n52 Some asylum officers reported to news outlets that they received an email copy of USCIS’s \nguidance memorandum only on Friday night—or not at all—although the agency was to begin \nprocessing cases under the new regulation on Saturday, November 10, 2018.  Dara Lind, Some \nasylum officers say they never got the memo about Trump’s asylum ban, Vox (Nov. 9, 2018), \nhttps://goo.gl/pBhrZy. \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 39 of 69\npersecuted or tortured” under the credible fear standard.53  In addition, whereas unaccompanied \nchildren previously received special non-adversarial proceedings in which to present their claims \nfor asylum, those children will now be summarily informed that they are ineligible for asylum, \nand compelled to undergo the same withholding-of-removal process as adults.54   \n181.  On November 9, 2018, the day after the Rule was first announced, President \nTrump issued the Proclamation pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(f), 1185(a).  The Proclamation \nimmediately suspended “[t]he entry of any alien into the United States across the international \nboundary between the United States and Mexico,” applicable to aliens who enter the country \nafter the date of the Proclamation and outside designated ports of entry.  Proc. §§ 1, 2(a)-(b).   \n182.  The suspension prescribed in the Proclamation will expire ninety days after its \neffective date or the date on which an agreement permits the United States to “remove aliens to \nMexico” under the terms of INA § 208(a)(2)(A), 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(A), whichever is earlier. \n183.  Together, the Rule and Proclamation rendered immediately ineligible for asylum \nall noncitizens who enter the United States without inspection at the southern border. \n184.  The Rule and Proclamation claim, by their own terms, that this policy change is \nneeded to respond to a “crisis on the southern border.”  83 Fed. Reg. 55,947; see also Proc. at 1. \n185.  The  public  notice  for  the  Rule,  like  President  Trump’s  earlier  public \nannouncements, invokes “the prospect that large caravans of thousands of aliens, primarily from \nCentral  America,  will  seek  to  enter  the  United  States  unlawfully  or  without  proper \ndocumentation” in the near future.  83 Fed. Reg. 55,947.   \n                                                 \n53 L.

The Proclamation likewise cites concerns regarding impending “large numbers of \naliens  traveling  through  Mexico  to  enter  our  country  unlawfully  or  without  proper \ndocumentation,” who “would add tremendous strain to an already taxed system, especially if \nthey avoid orderly processing by unlawfully crossing the southern border.”  Proc. at 1.   \n187.  To date, however, the migrant “caravan” that has arrived has proceeded largely to \ndesignated ports of entry, particular at the border with Tijuana, Mexico. \n188.  As numerous news outlets reported, “[t]he vanguard of what President Trump has \nlabeled an invasion force formed an orderly line at about 6:45 a.m. on Thursday [November 15, \n2018] near a major border crossing between Tijuana and the United States and waited patiently” \nto present largely asylum claims.55   \n189.  Among them, at least “[a]bout 80 lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people” \n“had come to the crossing, with stories of victimization and persecution, to make appointments \nfor asylum interviews in the United States.”56 \n190.  The  public  notice  for  the  Rule  claims  that  it  will,  in  combination  with  the \nProclamation, “help ameliorate the pressures on the present system” for apprehending, detaining, \nand evaluating the claims of migrants and “have a deterrent effect that could lessen future flows \nof illegal immigration.”  83 Fed. Reg. 55,947-55,948.  The Rule explicitly seeks to “reduce the \nnumber of cases referred to section 240 proceedings.”57  83 Fed. Reg. at 55,947. \n                                                 \n55 Kirk Semple, Dozens From Migrant Caravan Line Up at Border, Seeking Asylum Interviews, \nNew York Times (Nov. 15, 2018), https://goo.gl/KpG2AX. \n56 Id. \n57  The  Rule’s  public  notice  recognizes  that  “[o]nce  aliens  are  referred  for  section  240 \nproceedings, their cases may take months or years to adjudicate due to backlogs in the system.”  \n83 Fed. Reg. at 55,945.   \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 41 of 69\n191.  However,  notwithstanding  the  Rule’s  purported  efficiency  objectives,  the \nGovernment recognizes that “screening for proclamation-based ineligibility for asylum may in \nsome case entail some additional work.”  Id.   \n192.  For  example,  Defendant  USCIS  estimates  that  asylum  officers  historically \naverage four to five credible fear interviews and completions per day, but only two to three \nreasonable fear case completions per day.  Id.  The Proclamation therefore “might result in the \nneed to increase the number of officers required” to complete credible fear or reasonable fear \nscreenings consistent with current case completion goals,  and “additional interviewing time \nmight be necessary.”  Id. \n193.  In addition, DHS expects to “expend additional resources detaining aliens who \nwould have previously received a positive credible-fear determination and who now receive, and \nchallenge, a negative credible-fear and reasonable-fear determination.”  Id.  Because individuals \nare eligible for parole or release if they establish a credible fear, “[t]o the extent that the rule may \nresult in lengthier interviews for each case, aliens’ length of stay in detention would increase.”  \nId.   \n194.  DHS also anticipates that, to the extent that the Rule will increase the number of \nmigrants receiving negative credible fear and reasonable fear determinations and thus be subject \nto immediate removal, “DHS will incur increased and more immediate costs for enforcement and \nremoval of these aliens.”  Id. at 55,948.  \n195.  Defendants further acknowledge that “in the event all of the approximately 70,000 \naliens per year who cross illegally and assert a credible fear instead decide to present at a port of \nentry, processing times at ports of entry would be slower in the absence of additional resources \nor policies that would encourage alien to enter at less busy ports.”  Id. 55,949.  For example, \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 42 of 69\nusing figures from Fiscal Year 2018, the number of migrants presenting at designated ports of \nentry would rise from about 124,511 to approximately 200,000.  Id.   \n196.  Upon  information  and  belief,  no  additional  resources  or  policies  have  been \ndedicated to encouraging migrants to enter the United States at less busy ports or to augmenting \nthe staffing of busier ports. \n197.  In addition, the APA generally requires advance public notice and comment on \nproposed regulations, including the publication of a proposed substantive rule at least thirty days \nbefore its effective date.  5 U.S.C. § 553(b)-(d).  The Rule was not published prior to its adoption \nby Defendants or subjected to advance public notice and comment procedures. \n198.  Written or electronic comments  regarding the  Rule must be submitted on or \nbefore January 8, 2019.  83 Fed. Reg. 55, 934. \n199.  On November 19, 2018, in a case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union \n(“ACLU”) challenging the Rule and Proclamation, the U.S. District Court for the Northern \nDistrict of California issued a temporary restraining order enjoining the implementation of the \nRule nationwide.  East Bay Sanctuary Covenant, et al. v. Trump, et al., Case No. 18-cv-06810, \n2018 WL 6053140, at *21 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 19, 2018).  The court concluded that the plaintiffs \nwere likely to succeed on the merits of their claims, see id. at *10-17, that the organizational \nplaintiffs “made a clear showing that it is likely that they and their clients will suffer irreparable \nharm absent a TRO,” id. at *19, and that the public interest and balance of equities favor an \ninjunction against the Rule, id. at *19-20. \n200.  The Northern District of California’s temporary restraining order is to remain in \neffect until December 19, 2018 or further order of the court.  Id. at *21.  A hearing was set for \nDecember 19, 2018 for defendants to show cause why they “should not be enjoined from taking \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 43 of 69\nany action continuing to implement the Rule and ordered to return to the pre-Rule practices for \nprocessing asylum applications” pending final disposition of the case.  Id. \n201.  On November 27, 2018, the Government moved the U.S. District Court for the \nNorthern District of California for an emergency stay of its temporary restraining order.  East \nBay Sanctuary Covenant, Case No. 18-cv-06810, Dkt. 52 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 27, 2018).  The court \ndenied the Government’s request on November 30, 2018.  Id. Dkt. 61. \n202.  The Government also filed a Notice of Appeal on November 27, 2018.  Id. Dkt. \n51.  On December 1, 2018, the Government moved the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth \nCircuit for an emergency administrative stay and stay pending appeal of the district court’s \ntemporary restraining order.  East Bay Sanctuary Covenant, et al. v. Trump, et al., Case No. 18-\n17274, Dkt. 4 (9th Cir. Dec. 1, 2018).  In a docket order issued on the same date, the Ninth \nCircuit motions panel denied the Government’s request for an immediate administrative stay and \ncalled for briefing on the Government’s request for a stay pending appeal to be completed by \nDecember 4, 2018.   \n203.  On  December  7,  2018,  the  Ninth  Circuit  issued  its  opinion  denying  the \nGovernment’s request for a stay of the district court’s temporary restraining order pending \nappeal.  East Bay, Case No. 18-17274, 2018 WL 6428204 (9th Cir. Dec. 7, 2018).   \n204.  On December 11, 2018, the Government filed an emergency application to the \nUnited States Supreme Court for a stay of the district court’s injunction.  Application for Stay \nPending Appeal, Trump v. East Bay Sanctuary Covenant, No. 18A615 (U.S. Dec. 11, 2018).  \nThe Supreme Court has not yet issued a ruling on that stay application.  \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 44 of 69\nHarms to Individual Plaintiffs \n205.  Absent an injunction, the Rule will cause immediate and irreparable harm to \nIndividual Plaintiffs and the other putative class members who are fleeing dangerous conditions \nin their home countries and seeking asylum in the United States.  The Rule and Proclamation \nwill categorically deprive Individual Plaintiffs of eligibility for asylum regardless of the merits of \ntheir claims. \n206.  As  a  result  of  the  Rule’s  asylum  eligibility  bar,  Individual  Plaintiffs  face  a \nsignificantly increased risk that they will be forced to return to dangerous conditions in their \nhome countries.   \n207.  For  Plaintiffs  S.M.S.R.,  R.S.P.S.,  L.C.V.R.,  C.S.C.C.,  A.J.E.A.M.,  K.P.P.V., \nR.D.P.V., and Y.A.L.P., this would mean forcible return to home countries where they have \nexperienced, and would continue to face, real and imminent threats of violence at the hands of \ngang members from MS-13, Mara 18, Los Gaidos, and other criminal organizations. \n208.  In  the  case  of  Plaintiffs  S.M.S.R.  and  R.S.P.S.,  in  particular,  MS-13  gang \nmembers have pictures of S.M.S.R., vowed to find her if she relocated, and told R.S.P.S. he \nwould not receive another warning before being killed with his mother for their refusals to \naffiliate  with  the  gang.    Gangs  similarly  have  targeted  and  continue  to  threaten  Plaintiffs \nL.C.V.R., C.S.C.C., A.J.E.A.M., K.P.P.V., R.D.P.V., and Y.A.L.P. in El Salvador, Guatemala, \nand Honduras, because they witnessed a crime, refused to pay extortion, or are related to family \nmembers that the gangs want to murder. \n209.  For  other  Individual  Plaintiffs,  implementation  of  the  Rule  will  dramatically \nincrease the likelihood of return to countries where they face ongoing threats to their lives based \non their race, medical condition, or sexual orientation.  If deported, Z.A.G.G. and D.A.L.G. \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 45 of 69\nwould be returned to Guatemala, where they have encountered and would continue to encounter \nthreats, beatings, and the refusal of medical care on account of being members of the K’iche \nindigenous group, as well as because of D.A.L.G.’s medical condition.  If R.G.G. and N.A.G.A. \nwere returned to Guatemala, they would face continued threats of torture and death because \nR.G.G. is gay. \n210.  In addition, the Rule effectively applies a heightened “reasonable fear” standard, \nrather  than  the  “credible  fear”  standard,  to  all  individuals  subject  to  the  Rule  who  are  in \nexpedited removal proceedings.  Plaintiff A.J.E.A.M.’s case illustrates how that change in policy \nwill irreparably harm class members in expedited removal: A.J.E.A.M. and his father, A.J.A.C., \nunderwent fear interviews together, at the same time, and with the same asylum officer, but \nreceived different fear screening results depending on whether the reasonable or credible fear \nstandards were applied.  Because A.J.A.C. had a prior removal order that was reinstated by \nDefendants, the asylum officer applied the reasonable fear standard, yielding a negative fear \ndetermination.  But the asylum officer used the credible fear standard for A.J.E.A.M., who has \nno prior removal order, and made a positive fear determination on the same facts. \n211.  Had the Rule been in effect at the time of his interview, Plaintiff A.J.E.A.M. \nwould have received a negative determination for credible fear and likewise also for reasonable \nfear, given that the facts of his interview were the same as his father’s.  See 83 Fed. Reg. 55,943 \n(“If, however, an alien lacks a significant possibility of eligibility for asylum because of the \nproclamation bar, then the asylum officer will make a negative credible-fear finding.  The \nasylum officer will then apply the reasonable-fear standard to assess the alien’s claims for \nstatutory withholding of removal or CAT protection.”).  The Rule thus would have irreparably \nharmed A.J.E.A.M. and placed him at risk of immediate removal. \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 46 of 69\n212.  Furthermore,  by  denying  eligibility  for  asylum  and  therefore  access  to \nadjudication in front of an asylum officer, the Rule irreparably harms unaccompanied minors like \nY.A.L.P.  If the Rule were in effect, Y.A.L.P. would bypass the normal, non-adversarial asylum \noffice process and move directly to trial at immigration court.  Direct and cross examinations \nabout the threats to her life would traumatize sixteen-year-old Y.A.L.P. all over again. \nHarms to Organizational Plaintiffs \n213.  Plaintiffs CAIR Coalition and RAICES are 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations that \nprovide assistance to asylum seekers, including individuals who crossed the southern border \noutside designated ports of entry and who file applications for asylum with Defendant USCIS.  \nAbsent  injunctive  relief,  both  organizations  would  be  irreparably  harmed  by  the  Rule  and \nProclamation, which divert their human and financial resources and compromise their ability to \nserve their client populations consistent with their organizational missions. \n214.  Plaintiff  CAIR  Coalition  is  a  501(c)(3)  nonprofit  organization  dedicated  to \nproviding legal services to migrant men, women, and children who are detained by ICE or the \nOffice of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”) in Virginia and Maryland.  CAIR Coalition assists \nclients  with  applications for asylum, preparing for credible fear interviews, and adversarial \nproceedings  in  immigration  courts.    CAIR  Coalition  also  trains  and  supervises  legal \nprofessionals to provide similar assistance. \n215.  Asylum applications are a critical component of CAIR Coalition’s organizational \nmission.  Each year, CAIR Coalition serves hundreds of clients seeking asylum who entered the \nUnited States at the southern border in places other than ports of entry (“non-POE asylum \nseekers”). \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 47 of 69\n216.  The Rule, if not enjoined, will irreparably frustrate CAIR Coalition’s mission to \nserve as many migrants lawfully seeking asylum as possible.  Because Defendant DHS will \nsummarily  deport  many  non-POE  asylum  seekers  before  they  reach  the  Washington,  DC \nmetropolitan area, CAIR Coalition will face a drastic reduction in its client base. \n217.  The Rule and Proclamation also will substantially limit the overall number of \nclients CAIR Coalition can serve, whether or not those clients entered at a port of entry.  CAIR \nCoalition must create more complicated new resources and procedures to assist clients with their \nclaims,  in  turn  reducing  how  many  clients  the  organization  can  reach.    The  Rule  and \nProclamation put CAIR Coalition in a difficult position: raise more funds to serve the same \nnumber of clients, or reduce the number of clients served to fit within its current budget. \n218.  For example, CAIR Coalition will be forced to divert significant staff resources to \nanalyzing  and  interpreting  the  Rule  and  Proclamation,  overhauling  its  client  information \ndatabase, and preparing new informational and advocacy materials. \n219.  CAIR Coalition also will need to develop new materials and procedures for jail \nvisits specifically for non-POE asylum seekers.  CAIR Coalition usually provides one orientation \nfor all detainees, regardless of how they entered the country.  Under the Rule and Proclamation, \nhowever, CAIR Coalition must develop a separate orientation for non-POE asylum seekers to \nexplain the different standard for their credible fear interview and the limited forms of relief \navailable, double the number of staff to conduct two orientations, and spend more staff time on \nthe longer, more complicated dual orientation.   \n220.  Under  the  Rule  and  Proclamation,  CAIR  Coalition  also  will  expend  more \nresources to prepare each non-POE asylum seeker for his or her credible fear interview.  During \nthe approximately 1,500 intake sessions for detained adults that CAIR Coalition conducts each \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 48 of 69\nyear, a CAIR Coalition staff member typically spends about five to ten minutes with each adult \neligible for such interview preparing them for their credible fear interview.  \n221.  Under USCIS guidance regarding the Rule and Proclamation, non-POE asylum \nseekers effectively will need to  meet  the higher “reasonable fear” standard rather than the \ntraditional “credible fear” standard to obtain relief.  To prevail in a reasonable fear interview, an \nindividual must show effectively at least a 51% chance—i.e., that they “more likely than not”—\nwill be persecuted or tortured in their home country.  In contrast, in a credible fear interview, an \nindividual  must  show  an  approximately  10%  chance—i.e.,  that  they  have  a  “well-founded \nfear”—of persecution or torture in their home country.  It is much more difficult for migrants to \nreceive a positive determination in a reasonable fear interview.  During 2018, only 62% of \nreasonable fear interviews CAIR Coalition was involved with received positive determinations, \ncompared to 87% for credible fear interviews. \n222.  As a result of the heightened “reasonable fear” standard, each preparation session \nfor a non-POE asylum seeker will take roughly twice the amount of time, roughly ten to twenty \nminutes per client, whether to elicit and prepare more facts to satisfy the higher standard or \nrelated to follow-up interviews.  The Rule and Proclamation thus would cut in half the number of \nclients  CAIR  Coalition  can  prepare  during  each  jail  visit.    And  with  finite  resources  and \npermission to make jail visits only a few times a month, CAIR Coalition will be unable to \ncompensate for this loss. \n223.  CAIR Coalition will spend more resources during credible fear interviews for \nadult non-POE asylum seekers, too.  Prior to the Rule and Proclamation, CAIR Coalition had \nstopped  sending  staff  and  volunteers  to  credible  fear  interviews  in  person  because  the \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 49 of 69\noverwhelming majority of clients received positive results.  Instead, CAIR Coalition generally \nwould review the transcripts from interviews with negative determinations. \n224.  Because the Rule and Proclamation increase the standard for the interviews, it \nwill be important to send staff and volunteer attorneys to as many interviews as possible to \nincrease the likelihood that each client will pass.  If CAIR Coalition staff members are busy \nattending these interviews, they will be unable to assist as many clients in trial proceedings under \nINA § 240. \n225.  Given the increased burden of proof that will be required at interviews, CAIR \nCoalition also anticipates that it will not be able to staff interviews with legal assistants or law \nstudent volunteers, as it sometimes has in the past. \n226.  CAIR Coalition also will need to recreate its now-defunct volunteer program for \nattending credible fear interviews as a result of the higher standard.  Because of the Rule and \nProclamation, CAIR Coalition already has discussed hiring another dedicated attorney or legal \nassistant to recruit and train volunteer lawyers to sit in on credible fear interviews. \n227.  The increased need for volunteer lawyers has a ripple effect on the rest of CAIR \nCoalition’s programs.  Attorneys volunteering to attend credible fear interviews will have less \ntime—or perhaps no more time—available to volunteer in other cases.  This reduced volunteer \ncapacity reduces the organization’s overall capacity to represent as many clients as possible, \nespecially in trial proceedings.   \n228.  Reduced  volunteer  capacity  also  will  divert  resources  from  other  of  CAIR \nCoalition’s initiatives, such as providing translations or conducting country conditions research. \n229.  The Rule and Proclamation also will force CAIR Coalition to spend more time \nand resources on each child client, because all child cases will be time- and resource-intensive \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 50 of 69\ntrial cases.  Because the Rule and Proclamation prevent non-POE asylum seekers, including \nchildren, from obtaining asylum, their cases bypass the normal Asylum Office process and move \ndirectly to trial at immigration court.   \n230.  CAIR Coalition’s staff members will have to prepare for trial rather than  an \ninterview at the Asylum Office.  And staff members who work with detained children will have \nless time available to work on each case, as the detained docket moves much faster than the \ntimeframe at the Asylum Office. \n231.  Under the Rule and Proclamation, CAIR Coalition will have to spend more time \nand resources on cases for young mothers and their children as well.  Each year, CAIR Coalition \nserves about twenty to thirty mothers and their immigrant children who live in shelters.  CAIR \nCoalition anticipates that, under the new Rule and Proclamation, it will have to significantly \nincrease the total time that must be spent on each family’s case, because the mothers will be \nineligible for asylum and their children unable to be counted as derivatives within a single \napplication for relief. \n232.  The Rule and Proclamation also will jeopardize CAIR Coalition’s already tight \nbudget.  CAIR Coalition depends on law firms for 12% of its annual budget; if the organization \nplaces fewer asylum cases with volunteers at law firms, it is likely to receive fewer of these \nmuch-needed donations. \n233.  In addition, some of CAIR Coalition’s funding is tied to the number of adult \nclients that it serves each year.  At the Caroline County, Virginia detention center, for example, \nCAIR  Coalition  receives  funding  to  serve  a  targeted  number  of  detained  adults  in  trial \nproceedings each year.  The increased time it takes CAIR Coalition to serve each asylum seeker \ncorrespondingly reduces the overall numbers of people served.  As a result, it is uncertain \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 51 of 69\nwhether CAIR Coalition will be able to comply with its existing funding conditions tied to \nnumbers of trial representations. \n234.  The Rule’s lack of notice and comment procedures also irreparably compromised \nCAIR Coalition’s ability to inform the Government of the substantial and irreparable harms—\nboth to the organization and its clients—that the policy would create.  Commenting on rules and \nregulations is an important part of CAIR Coalition’s mission to improve the lives of migrants in \nthe Washington, D.C. area.  Had CAIR Coalition been given the opportunity to comment on the \nRule, it would have done so. \n235.  RAICES is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization headquartered in San Antonio, \nTexas. \n236.  Founded in 1986 as the Refugee Aid Project by community activists in South \nTexas, RAICES has grown to be the largest immigration legal services provider in Texas.  \nRAICES is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, with other \noffices in Austin, Corpus Christi, Dallas, Fort Worth, and Houston.  RAICES’s mission is to \npromote justice by providing free and low-cost legal services to underserved migrant children, \nfamilies, and refugees in Texas.  In 2017, RAICES closed approximately 51,000 cases at no cost \nto the client. \n237.  Since January 1, 2018, approximately 70% of the detained migrant families, and \n50% of the detained unaccompanied minors served by RAICES were non-POE asylum seekers.  \nHonduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador are the primary home countries for the non-POE asylum \nseekers whom RAICES serves. \n238.  Absent an injunction, the Rule and Proclamation will irreparably harm RAICES \nin multiple ways, including by frustrating RAICES’s mission to serve as many migrant clients as \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 52 of 69\npossible.  RAICES will be unable to represent the same number of clients that it does currently, \nboth because fewer clients will be eligible for relief and because RAICES will spend more \nresources on each individual case.  The Rule and Proclamation also will force RAICES to divert \nscarce resources away from other important programs to compensate for the additional time, \nprocedures, and staff required to continue serving clients under the policy. \n239.  The Rule and Proclamation will fundamentally reduce the capacity and divert the \nresources of RAICES’s Family Detention Services program, which will need to devise entirely \nnew intake procedures at each of the detention centers it serves.  Currently, the intake process is \nrelatively short.  Since January 1, 2018, Family Detention Services has conducted at least 7,000 \nintakes.  Under the Rule and Proclamation, however, RAICES staff will need to conduct more \nextensive and time-consuming intake questioning of each client.  In particular, RAICES will \nneed to ascertain whether the client attempted to enter through a port of entry and whether he or \nshe is likely to meet the higher legal standards for alternative forms of relief.   \n240.  The Rule and Proclamation also will require Family Detention Services to create \nan entirely new process for assisting non-POE asylum seekers with their credible fear interviews.  \nFor example, Family Detention Services currently assists most detainees at the detention facility \nin Karnes, Texas with their credible fear interviews.  Since January 1, 2018, approximately 2,700 \nfamilies underwent credible fear interviews.   \n241.  Pro bono attorneys and law students often attend these interviews telephonically \nso  that  staff  can  focus  on  difficult  or  emergency  cases.    Since  June  2018,  RAICES  staff \nrepresented at approximately 40 interviews, while volunteers represented at approximately 359 \ninterviews. \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 53 of 69\n242.  Under the Rule and Proclamation, however, Family Detention Services will be \nforced to create a more time- and resource-intensive dual-track system to prepare clients for \ninterviews: one for clients who entered at ports of entry or before the effective date of the Rule \nand Proclamation—i.e., using the traditional preparation methods—and another entirely new \nsystem for non-POE asylum seekers. \n243.  Under  the  Rule  and  Proclamation,  the  shift  from  credible  to  reasonable  fear \ninterviews will be a significant one for Family Detention Services.  The reasonable fear standard \nis much more difficult to meet than the credible fear standard.  Since January 1, 2018, only about \n65%  of  RAICES’s  clients  in  reasonable  fear  interviews  received  positive  determinations, \ncompared to 95% for clients in credible fear interviews.   \n244.  The  program’s  staff  will  spend  double  or  triple  the  time  interviewing  and \npreparing each client to meet the higher reasonable fear standard.  Due to the higher stakes, more \nstaff will need to attend interviews, rather than relying on volunteers.  For the pro bono attorneys \nthat still could attend, Family Detention Services will need to create new training resources on \nlegal  arguments  that  were  rarely  necessary  during  previous  credible  fear  interviews.    And \nRAICES would be unable to rely on law students and non-lawyers to attend these interviews, \ndrastically reducing the program’s volunteer base. \n245.  In contrast to the credible fear standard, the higher reasonable fear standard will \nrequire Family Detention Services to prepare each child for an interview.  Children are more \nlikely to be required to testify in a reasonable fear rather than a credible fear interview.  Thus, \nFamily  Detention  Services  will  have  to  explain  the  process  and  prepare  each  child  for \nquestioning.  This generally at least doubles—with a corresponding increase depending on the \nsize of the family—the time to prepare each family for their interviews. \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 54 of 69\n246.  As a result of the Rule and Proclamation and the foregoing resource-shifting, \nFamily Detention Services might not be able to provide any assistance at credible fear interviews \nfor asylum seekers unaffected by the policy. \n247.  Family  Detention  Services  also  will  struggle  under  the  weight  of  increased \nappeals under the Rule and Proclamation.  These appeals are time-consuming for staff, who must \nprepare  the  client  to  testify  and  research  legal  arguments  for  immigration  court.    Family \nDetention Services will need to narrow its case acceptance criteria as the volume of appeals \nincreases, further undermining the program’s commitment to universal representation.   \n248.  Nor will Family Detention Services be able to rely on pro bono attorneys to \nrepresent clients in immigration court; unlike with telephonic credible fear interviews, few pro \nbono attorneys are available to represent clients in person at immigration court, especially in \nrural Texas.   \n249.  The Rule and Proclamation also create new burdens for RAICES’s Children’s \nProgram.  Under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (“TVPRA”), removal \nproceedings for unaccompanied minors applying for asylum occur at the Asylum Office in a \nnon-adversarial context, rather than in immigration court, to protect these vulnerable children. \n250.  Under the Rule and Proclamation, however, unaccompanied minors who enter \noutside of a port of entry will no longer be eligible for asylum.  The Asylum Office will have no \njurisdiction over the case; an Immigration Judge will hear the case for withholding of removal \nand protection under CAT.  What has been a non-adversarial process using minimal resources \ntherefore will become a lengthy and costly process for the Children’s Program.  Staff will have \nto prepare formal briefings and sophisticated legal arguments for an Immigration Judge, both of \nwhich are uncommon for Asylum Office proceedings. \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 55 of 69\n251.  The adversarial  process in  immigration court is  also  a traumatic one for  the \nchildren.  Under the Rule and Proclamation, Children’s Program staff will expend tremendous \ntime and resources preparing children not only for the contents of their testimony and cross-\nexamination by a DHS attorney, but also for the emotional toll that testimony would take. \n252.  The Rule and Proclamation will add new obstacles for RAICES’s Community \nImmigration Services program as well, which assists clients after they have been released from \ndetention.  Last year, Community Immigration Services worked with approximately 100 asylum-\nseeking clients outside detention.  Staff assisted with roughly 75 applications. \n253.  Under the Rule and Proclamation, Community Immigration Services will spend at \nleast double the traditional time on each family’s applications.  Because each individual will \nhave  to  submit  a  separate  application,  rather  than  one  application  per  family,  it  will  take \nsignificantly more time and resources for Community Immigration Services lawyers to assist \nfamilies with their applications than before the policy.  RAICES anticipates that, under the \nInterim Rule and Proclamation, Community Immigration Services would need to assist with at \nleast twice the current number of applications. \n254.  Community Immigration Services staff also may have to shift roles into other \nRAICES programs.  If fewer clients are released from detention under the higher reasonable fear \nstandard, Community Immigration Services lawyers will have a decreased population to serve.  \nFamily Detention Services and the Children’s Program, conversely, will be understaffed due to \nthe increased burdens created by the Rule and Proclamation.  RAICES will need to retrain \nCommunity Immigration Services staff to perform unfamiliar duties for other programs. \n255.  The Rule’s lack of notice and comment procedures also irreparably compromised \nRAICES’s ability to inform the Government of the substantial harms—both to the organization \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 56 of 69\nand its clients—that the policy would create.   Commenting on rules and regulations is  an \nimportant part of RAICES’s mission to improve the lives of migrants in Texas.   In 2018, \nRAICES has commented on four proposed rules and regulations.  Had RAICES been given the \nopportunity to comment on the Rule, it would have done so. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n256.  Individual Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit challenging the Rule and Proclamation \nindividually and on behalf of a proposed nationwide class under Federal Rules 23(b)(2) and \n23(c)(4), consisting of all noncitizens who have entered or will enter the United States through \nthe southern border but outside ports of entry after November 9, 2018.   \n257.  The prerequisites of Federal Rule 23(a) are satisfied.  The proposed class consists \nof thousands of migrants detained or released into the community pending further immigration \nproceedings throughout the United States, rendering it impracticable to join all class members \nbefore the Court.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).  There also are substantial questions of law or fact \ncommon to all class members, including whether the Defendants’ actions in promulgating and \nenforcing the Rule and Proclamation violate the laws and Constitution of the United States.  Id. \n23(a)(2), (c)(4).  Individual Plaintiffs’ claims will be typical of those of the class, and Individual \nPlaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the class’s interests.  Id. 23(a)(3)-(4). \n258.  Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the \nclass, such that the requested declaratory and injunctive relief is appropriate respecting the class \nas a whole.  Id. 23(b)(2).  All class members had the right to apply for asylum under the U.S. \nimmigration laws prior to the promulgation of the Rule and Proclamation. \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 57 of 69\nCAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT I \n(Substantive Violation of INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1158, and APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706) \n259.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each of the foregoing paragraphs \nas though fully set forth herein. \n260.  The APA requires courts to hold unlawful and set aside any agency action that is \n“arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law;” “contrary \nto  constitutional  right,  power,  privilege,  or  immunity;”  “in  excess  of  statutory  jurisdiction, \nauthority, or limitations, or short of statutory right;” and “without observance of procedure \nrequired by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(C). \n261.  The INA guarantees “[a]ny alien who is physically present in the United States or \nwho arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port of arrival and including an \nalien who is brought to the United States after having been interdicted in international or United \nStates waters), irrespective of such alien’s status” the right to “apply for asylum in accordance \nwith this section or, where applicable, section 1225(b) of this title.”  8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1) \n(emphasis added). \n262.  In  promulgating  the  Rule  and  implementing  it  in  conjunction  with  the \nProclamation, Defendants  have acted contrary  to  the  INA.   By purporting to  deny  asylum \neligibility to those specifically entitled to seek it, the Rule and Proclamation violate the INA. \n263.  Further, the Rule impermissibly empowers the President, rather than the Attorney \nGeneral, to establish limitations on asylum unilaterally.  Section 1158(b)(2)(C) states that “[t]he \nAttorney General” may “establish . . . limitations and conditions” on asylum eligibility.  But the \n57 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 58 of 69\nRule purports to transfer that power to the President alone.  That purported delegation would \nallow an end-run around the requirements of the APA. \n264.  The Rule exceeds the Attorney General’s scope of delegated authority to establish \n“consistent” limitations and conditions on asylum eligibility and consideration of applications \nunder 8 U.S.C § 1158(b)(2)(C), (d)(5)(B).  In addition to contravening the plain terms of 8 \nU.S.C. § 1158(a)(1), the Rule introduces a limit on the availability of asylum that is dramatically \ndifferent from the other restrictions on asylum specified in the statute itself. \n265.  The  President’s  authority  under  8  U.S.C.  §§  1182(f),  1185(a)(1)  does  not \nencompass the ability to override statutory requirements related to asylum. \n266.  Through their actions described in this Complaint, Defendants have violated the \nsubstantive requirements of the INA and APA.  Defendants’ violations inflict immediate and \nirreparable harm upon all Plaintiffs, including by denying Individual Plaintiffs and other putative \nclass members the opportunity to seek asylum under the laws of the United States, depriving \nthem of the benefits to which asylees are entitled, and exposing them to the risk of forcible return \nto dangerous conditions in their home countries. \n267.  Plaintiffs lack adequate remedies at law to address Defendants’ violations and \nseek injunctive relief restraining Defendants from continuing to engage in the unlawful policy \nand practices alleged herein. \nCOUNT II \n(Violation of APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706, through Arbitrary and Capricious Action) \n268.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each of the foregoing paragraphs \nas though fully set forth herein. \n58 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 59 of 69\n269.  The APA requires courts to hold unlawful and set aside any agency action that is \n“arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A). \n270.  In  promulgating  the  Rule  and  implementing  it  in  conjunction  with  the \nProclamation, Defendants have acted arbitrarily and capriciously.  The Rule lacks any rational or \nevidence-based relationship to its proffered rationale of reducing the Government’s expenditure \nof resources to detain and remove unlawful aliens.   \n271.  There also is no evidence that the Rule will “have a deterrent effect that could \nlessen future flows of illegal immigration,” 83 Fed. Reg. 55,948, given the exigencies and \nadministrative delays that  compel migrants,  and especially asylum seekers, to  pursue  entry \noutside of designated ports. \n272.  The Rule and Proclamation also change prior policy holding that unlawful entry is \nmerely one consideration in asylum applications, rather than a categorical bar to eligibility.  See \nPula, 19 I. & N. Dec. 467, 473.  The Rule and Proclamation lack any acknowledgement of this \ndeviation from existing policy, fail to offer meaningful justifications for such change, create \ninternal inconsistencies in the law, and do not represent reasoned agency action. \n273.  Through  their  actions  described  in  this  Complaint,  Defendants  have  acted \narbitrarily and capriciously in violation of the APA.   \n274.  Defendants’ violations inflict immediate and irreparable harm upon all Plaintiffs, \nincluding by denying Individual Plaintiffs and other putative class members the opportunity to \nseek asylum in the United States and placing them at risk of deportation to countries in which \nthey are endangered. \n59 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 60 of 69\n275.  Plaintiffs lack adequate remedies at law to address Defendants’ violations and \nseek injunctive relief restraining Defendants from continuing to engage in the unlawful policy \nand practices alleged herein. \nCOUNT III \n(Violation of APA, 5 U.S.C. § 553, for Failure to Follow Notice and Comment Procedures) \n276.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each of the foregoing paragraphs \nas though fully set forth herein. \n277.  The APA requires courts to hold unlawful and set aside any agency action taken \n“without observance of procedure required by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \n278.  The APA requires that agencies follow public notice-and-comment rulemaking \nprocedures before promulgating regulations.  See 5 U.S.C. § 553(b), (c).  Defendants failed to \nprovide notice and an opportunity for public comment on the Rule in any manner prior to its \nissuance on November 8, 2018. \n279.  The APA also presumptively requires that a substantive rule be published “not \nless than 30 days before its effective date.”  Id. § 553(d).  Defendants failed to publish the Rule, \nwhich affects asylum seekers’ substantive rights under the INA, as required by this provision. \n280.  The APA’s notice and comment exceptions related to “foreign affairs function[s] \n of the United States,” id. § 553(a)(1), and “good cause,” id. § 553(d)(3), are inapplicable.   \n281.  Had the Rule been the subject of advance publication and notice-and-comment \nrulemaking under the APA, CAIR Coalition and RAICES would have submitted comments \nopposing its adoption. \n60 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 61 of 69\n282.  Defendants’ violations inflict immediate and irreparable harm upon all Plaintiffs, \nwho  lack  adequate  remedies  at  law  and  seek  injunctive  relief  restraining  Defendants  from \ncontinuing to engage in the unlawful policy and practices alleged herein. \nCOUNT IV \n(Due Process, U.S. Const. amend. V) \n283.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each of the foregoing paragraphs \nas though fully set forth herein. \n284.  “[T]he Due Process Clause applies to all ‘persons’ within the United States, \nincluding aliens, whether their presence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or permanent.”  \nZadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 693 (2001) (internal quotation omitted); see also Shaughnessy \nv. United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U.S. 206, 212 (1953) (“[A]liens who have once passed \nthrough our gates, even illegally, may be expelled only after proceedings conforming to . . . due \nprocess of law.”).  The Due Process Clause applies to Individual Plaintiffs and the other putative \nclass members in the United States. \n285.   Under the Rule and Proclamation, Defendants will deny Individual Plaintiffs and \nother  putative  class  members  access  to  the  asylum  procedures  to  which  they  are  entitled, \nregardless of their point of entry, under the INA.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1). \n286.  In addition, “an alien who has unlawfully entered the United States has a Fifth \nAmendment procedural due process right to petition the government for political asylum and a \nstatutory procedural due process right to a meaningful or fair evidentiary hearing.”  Gutierrez-\nRogue v. I.N.S., 954 F.2d 769, 772-73 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (citing Maldonado-Perez v. I.N.S., 865 \nF.2d 328, 332-33 (D.C. Cir. 1989)) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).   \n61 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 62 of 69\n287.  As discussed above, Individual Plaintiffs and other putative class members have \nbeen afforded no process or access to fair hearings through which to seek asylum under the Rule \nand Proclamation, due to the policy’s categorical denial of eligibility for migrants who entered \nthrough the southern border outside designated ports of entry.  Denying Individual Plaintiffs and \nother putative class members any ability to  be meaningfully heard on their asylum claims \nviolates their Fifth Amendment rights to due process. \n288.  In addition, because minor children are derivatively eligible to receive asylum \nwhere their parents obtain asylum, see 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(3)(A), Defendants’ violations of the \ndue process rights of adult members of the putative class likewise violate the due process rights \nof derivatively eligible children in the putative class. \n289.  Defendants’ due process violations inflict immediate and irreparable harm upon \nIndividual  Plaintiffs  and  other  putative  class  members,  including  by  denying  them  the \nopportunity to seek asylum in the United States and placing them at risk of deportation to \ncountries in which they are endangered. \n290.  Plaintiffs lack adequate remedies at law to address Defendants’ violations and \nseek injunctive relief restraining Defendants from continuing to engage in the unlawful policy \nand practices alleged herein. \nCOUNT V \n(Substantive Violation of Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, \n8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(3)(C), and APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706) \n291.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each of the foregoing paragraphs \nas though fully set forth herein. \n292.  As  noted  above,  the  TVPRA  amended  the  INA  to  provide  specific  asylum \nprotections for children.  See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158(b)(3)(C), 1232. \n62 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 63 of 69\n293.  Pursuant to the TVPRA, unaccompanied children who enter the United States \nwithout  inspection  generally  are  not  subject  to  expedited  removal.    Id.  §  1232(a)(5)(D)(i).  \nInstead, unaccompanied minors are placed in regular removal proceedings before Immigration \nJudges without having to pass credible fear interviews.  Id. \n294.  Prior to reaching an Immigration Judge, an unaccompanied child presents her \napplication for asylum to  an  asylum officer,  who has “initial  jurisdiction over any asylum \napplication filed by an unaccompanied alien child” and can accept the application even for an \nunaccompanied child in removal proceedings.  Id. § 1158(b)(3)(C).  If the asylum officer denies \nthe application, then the unaccompanied minor generally proceeds to present her application to \nthe Immigration Judge, in addition to any other claims she may have for withholding of removal \nor CAT relief.  See id. § 1232(a)(5)(D). \n295.  As addressed above, this sequencing, which permits unaccompanied minors to \npresent asylum claims to asylum officers in the first instance, is designed to further the TVPRA’s \nfundamental objective of protecting children.  It ensures that when unaccompanied minors first \nrecount the difficult and potentially traumatic facts underlying their asylum claims, they do so in \na  non-adversarial  setting,  rather  than  in  the  context  of  trial  proceedings  including  cross-\nexamination by DHS attorneys. \n296.  The Rule is directly contrary to the TVPRA.  asylum officers would be forced to \nissue negative findings on the asylum claims of unaccompanied children.  The Rule contravenes \nthe specific process that Congress set up for unaccompanied children. \n297.  Through their actions described in this Complaint, Defendants have violated the \nsubstantive requirements of the TVPRA and APA.  Defendants’ violations inflict immediate and \nirreparable harm upon unaccompanied children in the putative class by depriving them of the \n63 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 64 of 69\nopportunity  to  seek  asylum  under  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  especially  the  procedural \nprotections created in  the TVPRA, and by  exposing them to  the risk of forcible return to \ndangerous conditions in their home countries.  Defendants’ violations also inflict immediate and \nirreparable  harm  on  RAICES  and  CAIR  Coalition  by  compromising  the  services  they  can \nprovide to unaccompanied minor clients and forcing them to drastically divert or redesign their \nchildren’s services programs.  \n298.  Plaintiffs lack adequate remedies at law to address Defendants’ violations and \nseek injunctive relief restraining Defendants from continuing to engage in the unlawful policy \nand practices alleged herein. \nCOUNT VI \n(Mandamus, 28 U.S.C. § 1361) \n299.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each of the foregoing paragraphs \nas though fully set forth herein. \n300.  Federal district courts have “original jurisdiction of any action in the nature of \nmandamus to compel an officer or employee of the United States, or any agency thereof to \nperform a duty owed to the plaintiff.”  28 U.S.C. § 1361. \n301.  A plaintiff may obtain a writ of mandamus where she has a clear right to the relief \nsought, the defendant has a duty to do the act in question, and no other adequate remedy is \navailable.  Id. \n302.  Under the INA, “[a]ny alien who is physically present in the United States or who \narrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port of arrival and including an alien \nwho is brought to the United States after having been interdicted in international or United States \nwaters), irrespective of such alien’s status,” has the right to “apply for asylum in accordance with \n64 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 65 of 69\nthis  section  or,  where  applicable,  section  1225(b)  of  this  title.”    8  U.S.C.  §  1158(a)(1).  \nDefendants have a clear, nondiscretionary duty to permit noncitizens to make asylum claims \nregardless of their status and point of entry into the United States. \n303.  The Rule and Proclamation contravene Defendants’ duty to permit such claims \nand categorically deny Individual Plaintiffs and the other members of the putative class the \nability to claim asylum, for which the new policy unlawfully makes them ineligible based on \ntheir point of entry into the United States. \n304.  Plaintiffs have exhausted all other avenues of relief and have no other adequate \nremedy. \n305.  Defendants’ violations inflict immediate and irreparable harm upon all Plaintiffs, \nincluding by denying Individual Plaintiffs and other putative class members the opportunity to \nseek asylum in the United States and placing them at risk of deportation to countries in which \nthey are endangered. \n306.  Plaintiffs have a clear right to access the asylum procedures available under the \nINA, and Defendants have a non-discretionary duty to provide them access to those procedures.  \nThere is no adequate remedy to Defendants’ violation, apart from ordering Defendants to carry \nout  their  duties  to  permit  asylum  claims  consistent  with  the  terms  of  the  INA.    Plaintiffs \naccordingly are entitled to mandamus relief. \nCOUNT VII \n(Violation of 28 U.S.C. § 508 and the Appointments Clause) \n307.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each of the foregoing paragraphs \nas though fully set forth herein. \n65 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 66 of 69\n308.  Under 28 U.S.C. § 508(a), “[i]n case of a vacancy in the office of Attorney \nGeneral, or of his absence or disability, the Deputy Attorney General may exercise all the duties \nof that office.”  If the Deputy Attorney General is not “available,” the “Associate Attorney \nGeneral shall act as Attorney General.”  Id. § 508(b).  “The Attorney General may designate the \nSolicitor General and the Assistant Attorneys General, in further order of succession, to act as \nAttorney General.”  Id. \n309.  Defendant Whitaker was not the Deputy Attorney General, nor did he hold any \nother office in the Department of Justice in the line of succession, at the time the office of \nAttorney General became vacant.  His appointment to be Acting Attorney General therefore \nviolates 28 U.S.C. § 508. \n310.  The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 (“FVRA”), 5 U.S.C. § 3345, is not \napplicable.  First, the FVRA does not override the provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 508.  Second, \nAttorney  General  Jefferson  B.  Sessions  was  removed  by  President  Trump.    The  resulting \nvacancy thus could not be filled using the FVRA.  See 5 U.S.C. § 3345(a). \n311.  The Appointments Clause of the Constitution, art. II, § 2, cl. 2, requires the \nPresident to obtain “the Advice and Consent of the Senate” before appointing principal “Officers \nof the United States.” \n312.  The Attorney General is a principal officer for purposes of the Appointments \nClause.  See Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654 (1988). \n313.  President Trump did not obtain the Advice and Consent of the Senate before \nappointing Defendant  Whitaker to be Acting Attorney General.  His appointment therefore \nviolates the Appointments Clause. \n66 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 67 of 69\n314.  Because Defendant Whitaker’s appointment is invalid, he lacked authority to \nissue the Rule, and the Rule is unlawful.   \n315.  In  addition,  any  future  action  taken  by  Defendant  Whitaker  affecting  any \nindividual  Plaintiff,  organizational  Plaintiff,  client  of  an  organizational  Plaintiff,  or  class \nmember, is likewise invalid.  In particular, to the extent that written or electronic comments \nregarding the Rule are  due on January  8, 2019, any  additional action taken by Defendant \nWhitaker thereafter to promulgate a final rule will be unlawful. \nCOUNT VIII \n(Declaratory Judgment) \n316.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each of the foregoing paragraphs \nas though fully set forth herein. \n317.  Pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202, and Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 57, this Court is empowered to issue a declaratory judgment regarding \nthe Rule’s lawfulness under the Constitution, the INA, the APA, and other federal statutes. \n318.  An “actual, ripe controversy” exists between the parties concerning Defendants’ \nauthority to issue the Rule and to implement and enforce its terms nationwide consistent with \nU.S. law.  Committee on Oversight & Gov’t Reform v. Holder, 979 F. Supp. 2d 1, 22 (D.D.C. \n2013).  The Court has subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate that dispute pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1331.  See id. \n319.  Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment from the Court that the Rule is inconsistent \nwith and unlawful under the Constitution and laws of the United States. \n67 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 39   Filed 12/18/18   Page 68 of 69\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court: \na.  Declare that the Rule is unauthorized by, and contrary to, the Constitution \nand laws of the United States;  \nb.  Issue a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and permanent \ninjunction enjoining Defendants from implementing or enforcing the Rule \nacross the nation; \nc.  Issue  a  writ  of  mandamus  requiring  Defendants’  compliance  with  the \nterms of the INA, including the requirement that they provide Individual \nPlaintiffs and the putative class access to credible fear interviews to pursue \ntheir asylum claims; \nd.  Set an expedited hearing within fourteen days pursuant to Federal Rule \n65(b)(2) to determine whether the temporary restraining order should be \nextended and a preliminary injunction should be issued;  \ne.  Determine that this action may be maintained as a class action pursuant to \nFederal  Rules  23(b)(2)  and  23(c)(4);  direct  that  reasonable  notice  be \nprovided  to  the  class  pursuant  to  Federal  Rule  23(c)(2);  declare  that \nPlaintiffs are the representatives of the class; and declare that Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel are class counsel; and \nf.

Under U.S. law, noncitizens are entitled to seek asylum irrespective of immigration \nstatus and without regard to manner of entry into the United States.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1).  \n(cid:56)(cid:17)(cid:54)(cid:17)(cid:3)(cid:79)(cid:68)(cid:90)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:74)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:86)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:90)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:56)(cid:81)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:182)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:79)(cid:76)(cid:74)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:86) under the Refugee \nAct of 1980.  U.S. law also requires certain procedural safeguards during removal proceedings.  \nSee id.  § 1225(b)(1).    These  safeguards  are  critical  to  ensuring  that  individuals  who  face \npersecution(cid:178)including rape, kidnapping, torture, and even death(cid:178)in their home countries are \ngiven a fair chance to establish their eligibility for asylum.   \n3.

First, the Rule contradicts the requirements of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n(cid:11)(cid:179)(cid:44)(cid:49)(cid:36)(cid:180)(cid:12), specifically 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1), which gives any noncitizen who is physically present \nin or who arrives in the United States a statutory right to  seek asylum,  irrespective of the \n(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:76)(cid:89)(cid:76)(cid:71)(cid:88)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:182)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:80)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:81)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:3)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:85)(cid:92)(cid:15)(cid:3)and requires the government to follow specific processes when an \nindividual expresses a desire to seek asylum or fear of returning to his or her home country.  The \nRule is therefore contrary to law under the INA and the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \n§ 551 et seq. (cid:11)(cid:179)(cid:36)(cid:51)(cid:36)(cid:180)(cid:12)(cid:17)\n5. Second, the Rule violates 8 U.S.C. § 1225 by mandating a denial of a credible fear \ndetermination, even in situations where a noncitizen in expedited removal proceedings shows a \nsignificant possibility that she could establish eligibility for asylum.  For this reason, the Rule is \nagain contrary to law under the INA and the APA.  \n6. Third, the Rule violates The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection \nAct, 8 U.S.C. § 1158 (b)(3)(C), by denying unaccompanied children the opportunity to first present \nthe substance of their claims for asylum in a non-adversarial proceeding before an asylum officer.  \n7. Fourth, by adopting, without notice and the opportunity to comment, an interim \nfinal rule depriving certain asylum seekers of the statutory protection outlined in the INA simply \nbecause they enter the country without inspection, the responsible government officials have acted \nin excess of their statutorily prescribed authority, contrary to law, and arbitrarily and capriciously, \nall in violation of the APA. \n8. Fifth, the promulgation of the Rule was invalid because the current Acting Attorney \nGeneral who putatively authorized promulgation of the Rule is ineligible to serve in that role under \n28 U.S.C. § 508 and the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution, art. II, § 2, cl. 2.  \n2\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 1   Filed 11/20/18   Page 4 of 34\n \n9. Sixth, (cid:72)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:86)(cid:88)(cid:80)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:88)(cid:85)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:36)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3)(cid:36)(cid:87)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:81)(cid:72)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:42)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:182)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:83)(cid:83)(cid:82)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:90)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:3)\nlawful, the Rule violates the requirement under 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(2)(C) that any changes to the \nlimitations and conditions imposed on asylum seekers be made by regulation(cid:178)rather than by \npresidential decree.  Because the Rule is predicated on an abdication of that responsibility, and \nsimply incorporates by reference the consequence of Presidential proclamations, the Rule is invalid \nunder the APA and is ultra vires.\n10. If allowed to stand, the Rule would fundamentally reshape and constrict asylum \n(cid:79)(cid:68)(cid:90)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:3)(cid:56)(cid:17)(cid:54)(cid:17)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:81)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:3)(cid:79)(cid:68)(cid:90)(cid:17)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:55)(cid:75)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:38)(cid:82)(cid:88)(cid:85)(cid:87)(cid:182)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:81)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:86)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:83)(cid:88)(cid:87)(cid:3)\n(cid:68)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:83)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:36)(cid:71)(cid:80)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:182)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:79)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:74)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:83)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:85)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:83)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:69)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:80)(cid:3)to thousands of asylum \nseekers who desperately need protection in this country.  \n11. Plaintiffs respectfully request a declaration that the Rule violates the APA, and an \norder enjoining the application of the Rule.      \nPARTIES \n12. Plaintiffs are noncitizens who are presently in the United States and wish to seek \nasylum.\n13. Plaintiff O.A. is a 23-year-old man from Honduras who the government contends \nis subject to the Proclamation.  O.A. fled Honduras with his 4-year-old daughter, K.S., because a \ngang called Mara-18 (M-18), threatened to kill him and his family.  They did so because M-18 had \n(cid:78)(cid:76)(cid:79)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:50)(cid:17)(cid:36)(cid:17)(cid:182)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:69)(cid:85)(cid:82)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:74)(cid:72)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:50)(cid:17)(cid:36)(cid:17)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:75)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:68)(cid:80)(cid:76)(cid:79)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:90)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:50)(cid:17)(cid:36)(cid:17)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:82)(cid:83)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:90)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)\n(cid:83)(cid:82)(cid:79)(cid:76)(cid:70)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:79)(cid:83)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:74)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:75)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:69)(cid:85)(cid:82)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:182)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:17)  O.A. knew that the police in Honduras would \nnot be willing or able to help him, and he decided to flee Honduras with his daughter.  \n14. Plaintiff K.S. is a 4-year-old girl from Honduras.  O.A. is her father, and she entered \nthe United States with him when he entered the United States after fleeing Honduras.  (cid:46)(cid:17)(cid:54)(cid:17)(cid:182)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:79)(cid:76)(cid:73)(cid:72)(cid:3)\n3\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 1   Filed 11/20/18   Page 5 of 34\n \nwas at risk in Honduras because her father cooperated with police to investigate the death of his \nbrother, and she accompanied him when he fled Honduras to seek asylum in the United States.\n15. Plaintiff A.V. is a 27-year-old woman from Honduras who crossed the border from \nMexico into the United States other than at a port of entry on November 11, 2018.  She has a \ncredible fear of persecution in Honduras because she is a victim of repeated violent assaults by her \npartner (who is the father of her children), and because her partner is likely a member of gang and \nhas threatened to kill her.  A.V. has nowhere to turn for help in Honduras.  \n16. Plaintiff G.Z. is a 17-year-old unaccompanied minor from Honduras who  the \ngovernment alleges crossed the U.S.(cid:177)Mexico border other than at a port of entry on November 10, \n2018.  In Honduras, G.Z. was the victim of recurring violence at the hands of his father, who is a \npolice officer.  G.Z. has no ability to seek protection from the police, because his father is one of \nthem.  In the weeks preceding his departure from Honduras, G.Z. also rebuffed efforts by MS-13 \ngang members to recruit him because he believes their activities to be morally wrong.  GZ feared \nthat if he did not leave Honduras he would be killed.  He has a credible fear of persecution.  \n17. Plaintiff D.S. is an asylum seeker from Honduras.  She fled Honduras because of \nsevere domestic abuse by her partner, who is a security guard.  She tried to report the violence, \nwhich at points required hospitalization, but the government did nothing in response to her \ncomplaint and did not pursue her partner when he failed to appear in judicial proceedings.  D.S. \nalso tried to relocate internally within Honduras but her partner tracked her down and threatened \nto kill her.  D.S. made the difficult journey across Mexico with her son, C.A., over the course of \ntwo weeks, during which time she exhausted all of her financial resources.  D.S., with her son, \nC.A., entered the United States other than at a port of entry on November 13, 2018, and they were \napprehended by immigration officials on the U.S. side of the border.  \n4\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 1   Filed 11/20/18   Page 6 of 34\n \n18. Plaintiff C.A. is an asylum seeker from Honduras, whose mother is Plaintiff D.S.  \nPlaintiff C.A. was regularly beaten by his father in Honduras and accompanied his mother, D.S., \non her journey to the United States.  With D.S., C.A. entered the United States other than at a port \nof entry on November 13, 2018, and they were apprehended by immigration officials on the U.S. \nside of the border.  \n19.

Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the interim final rule entitled (cid:179)Aliens \nSubject to a Bar on Entry Under Certain Presidential Proclamations; Procedures for Protection \nClaims,(cid:180) 83 Fed. Reg. 55,934 (Nov. 9, 2018) is arbitrary, capricious, contrary to law, and beyond \nthe authority of the Acting Attorney General and the Secretary to promulgate under the APA and \notherwise.  Plaintiffs further seek an injunction prohibiting Defendants from enforcing the Rule \nand such additional and other relief as is just and proper.   \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n26. This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, as the claims in this case arise \nunder federal statutes, including the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq., and the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 701 et\nseq.

This Court further has jurisdiction to review this case as a challenge to changes in \nthe expedited removal process under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3).  Although courts generally lack \njurisdiction to review challenges to the expedited removal process, judicial review under § 1225(b) \nis available to determine if any regulation issued to implement such section is constitutional or \nwhether such regulation is otherwise in violation of law.

The standard used \nin this initial screening is intentionally lower than the standard used in the full asylum hearing that \nthe applicant will later undergo if he or she passes the credible fear interview.  The intentionally \nlow threshold for demonstrating a credible fear accounts for the reality that credible fear interviews \ntypically take place shortly after asylum seekers have completed their often traumatic journeys to \nthe United States,  in border processing centers or detention facilities where asylum seekers \ntypically do not have access to attorneys.  The standard also acknowledges that many asylum \nseekers arrive in the United States without the time, resources, or expertise to develop fully, upon \narrival, the evidence necessary to prevail on their ultimate asylum application. \n40. The credible fear process includes another important limitation.  Recognizing the \nabbreviated nature of these interviews, if a person meets the definition of a refugee but may be \nsubject to a bar to asylum, officers are required to flag those potential bars for future adjudication, \nbut to refer the applicant for full removal proceedings.  See 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(e)(5).      \n41. The  requirement  to  refer  an  asylum  seeker  subject  to  expedited  removal \nproceedings to an asylum officer for a credible fear interview is mandatory.   See 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii) (immigration (cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:73)(cid:76)(cid:70)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:179)shall refer the [noncitizen] for an interview by an asylum \n(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:73)(cid:76)(cid:70)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:180)(cid:3)(cid:11)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:83)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:71)(cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:12)); 8 C.F.R. § (cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:24)(cid:17)(cid:22)(cid:11)(cid:69)(cid:12)(cid:11)(cid:23)(cid:12)(cid:3)(cid:11)(cid:179)[T]he inspecting officer shall not proceed \nfurther with removal of the [noncitizen] until the [noncitizen] has been referred for an interview \nby an asylum officer.(cid:180)(cid:3)(cid:11)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:83)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:71)(cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:12)).\n42. If an applicant is found by an asylum officer to have a credible fear of persecution \nor torture, the applicant is taken out of the expedited removal process and placed in the regular \nremoval process.  The applicant thus obtains the ability to develop a full record in support of his \n10\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 1   Filed 11/20/18   Page 12 of 34\n \nor her asylum claim; the right to present that claim before an immigration judge at a trial-like \nhearing; and the ability to appeal an adverse decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals and a \nfederal court of appeals.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii).\n43. The newly promulgated Rule and the accompanying Proclamation upend this \ndetailed statutory scheme.

Moreover, unlike asylum, withholding of removal and CAT protection do not \nprohibit the government from removing the noncitizen to a third country; do not create a path to \nlawful permanent resident status andcitizenship; do not allow the noncitizen to travel freely within \nthe United States or internationally; and do not ensure family unity by permitting (cid:68)(cid:3)(cid:81)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:70)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:93)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:182)(cid:86)(cid:3)\nfamily members to obtain lawful immigration status derivatively. \n45.

Third, the Rule provides for what an immigration judge is to do with respect to \nthe  review  of  expedited  removal  orders  following  a  negative  credible  or \nreasonable fear assessment.  The Rule provides that an immigration judge is to \nreview de novo the determination that a noncitizen falls within the scope of a \nPresidential  proclamation  that  is  described  in  8  C.F.R.  § 208.13(c)(3)  or \n§ 1208.13(c)(3).

Put more succinctly, together the Rule and Proclamation prohibit anyone from \nobtaining asylum if they cross outside of a port of entry and make it more difficult for those people \n19\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 1   Filed 11/20/18   Page 21 of 34\n \nto obtain other forms of relief.  At the same time, as detailed above, the Administration has made \nit untenable for many, if not most, noncitizens to apply for asylum at a port of entry.   \n65.

By barring the plaintiffs from obtaining asylum based solely on the manner in \nwhich they entered the United States, the Rule violates the INA, which prohibits penalizing \nrefugees for entering the country illegally and other than at a port of entry. \n77.

In particular, Plaintiffs have been denied a meaningful opportunity to seek asylum, \nexposing them to multiple other harms including the threat of removal to their home countries and \nthe persecution from which they fled.  The Rule also deprives Plaintiffs of other benefits to which \nasylees are entitled.  The harm to Plaintiffs is irreparable. \n80.

The Immigration and Nationality Act, including 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1) (expedited \nremoval) and 8 U.S.C. § 1158 (asylum), affords noncitizens an opportunity to apply for asylum, \nby screening arriving noncitizens to determine whether their asylum claims are potentially viable.   \n83.

Under this Congressional design, a noncitizen in expedited removal proceedings(cid:178)\nincluding a noncitizen who enters without inspection(cid:178)should not fail a credible fear interview \nunless there is no significant possibility that that individual would ultimately prevail in her asylum \nclaim.  See 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(e)(5) (citing to 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(c)(3)).  A credible fear interview \nis not an on-the-merits adjudication of the claim.  To the contrary, the credible fear standard of \n25\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 1   Filed 11/20/18   Page 27 of 34\n \nreview is intended to be sufficiently low to ensure all bona fide asylum seekers receive a full \nhearing on their claims. \n86. The Rule mandates a negative credible fear finding for anyone who enters without \ninspection, even in cases where there is a significant possibility that the noncitizen is eligible for \nasylum.  This requirement violates the plain meaning of Section 1225.   \n87.

See 8 U.S.C. § 1158 (b)(3)(C).  \n94. Under the TVPRA, unaccompanied children who enter without inspection are \ngenerally not subject to expedited removal provisions.   See id. § 1232(a)(5)(D)(i).  Instead, \nunaccompanied children are placed into regular removal proceedings before an immigration judge \nwithout having to pass a credible fear interview.  Id.\n95. However, the immigration judge is not the first person to whom an unaccompanied \nminor  presents his or her application for asylum.  Instead, the TVPRA prov(cid:76)(cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:179)(cid:62)(cid:68)(cid:64)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:92)(cid:79)(cid:88)(cid:80)(cid:3)\nofficer . . . shall have initial jurisdiction over any asylum application filed by an unaccompanied \n(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:76)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:76)(cid:79)(cid:71)(cid:17)(cid:180)(cid:3)(cid:3)Id.\n96. Under the TVPRA, if the asylum officer denies the application for asylum, the \nunaccompanied minor then has an opportunity to proceed before the immigration judge. \n97. This sequencing implements an important objective of the statute.  By allowing an \nunaccompanied child the opportunity to present an asylum claim to an asylum officer in the first \ninstance, the TVPRA ensures that when a child recounts for the first time the traumatic and \nsensitive facts of the persecution underlying a claim for humanitarian protection, he or she may do \nso in a non-adversarial setting.   \n98. The Rule is contrary to the system established by the TVPRA.  Under the Rule, \nunaccompanied children subject to the Proclamation are ineligible for asylum, and will be subject \n27\n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 1   Filed 11/20/18   Page 29 of 34\n \nto a mandatory negative credible fear finding.  Because asylum officers do not have authority to \norder withholding of removal or protection under the Convention Against Torture, the asylum \nofficer  will,  under  the  Rule,  have  no  obvious  basis  to  hear  or  assess  the  merits  of  the \n(cid:88)(cid:81)(cid:68)(cid:70)(cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:80)(cid:83)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:76)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:80)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:182)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:79)(cid:68)(cid:76)(cid:80)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:3)(cid:83)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:88)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:17)(cid:3)\n99. As a result, the first time an unaccompanied minor like GZ will be permitted to \npresent and obtain any review of the traumatic and sensitive details of a claim for asylum is in the \nadversarial proceeding that occurs before an immigration judge.  The Rule thus upends the non-\nadversarial process mandated by Congress in 8 U.S.C. § 1158 (b)(3)(C).   \n100.

The Rule is contrary to the statutory requirement that conditions and limitations on \nthe availability of asylum be established by regulation.  Instead, the Rule constitutes an abdication \nof that responsibility by allowing the President, by proclamation and without a rulemaking process, \nto add or change the conditions and limitations for asylum.   \n118.

Civil Action No. 18-2718 (RDM) \n \nDONALD J. TRUMP, et al., \n \n  Defendants. \n \n \nS.M.S.R. et al., \n \n    Plaintiffs, \n \n  v.    Civil Action No. 18-2838 (RDM) \n \nDONALD J. TRUMP, et al., \n \n  Defendants. \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nOn November 9, 2018, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security \njointly issued an interim final rule adding “a new mandatory bar on eligibility for asylum for \ncertain aliens who are subject to a presidential proclamation suspending or imposing limitations \non their entry into the United States . . . and who enter the United States in contravention of such \na proclamation.”  Aliens Subject to a Bar on Entry Under Certain Presidential Proclamations; \nProcedures for Protection Claims, 83 Fed. Reg. 55,934, 55,939 (Nov. 9, 2018) (“the Rule” or \n“the Interim Final Rule”).  That same day, the President issued a proclamation suspending for a \nperiod of ninety days “[t]he entry of any alien into the United States across the international \nboundary between the United States and Mexico,” except by aliens “who enter[] the United \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 2 of 77\nStates at a port of entry and properly present[] for inspection” and entries by “lawful permanent \nresident[s] of the United States.”  Addressing Mass Migration Through the Southern Border of \nthe United States, 83 Fed. Reg. 57,661, 57,663 (Nov. 15, 2018) (“the Proclamation”).  Since that \nproclamation expired, the President has issued two subsequent proclamations suspending entries \nacross the southern border, except at a port of entry, for additional ninety-day periods.  See \nAddressing Mass Migration Through the Southern Border of the United States, 84 Fed. Reg. \n3,665 (Feb. 12, 2019); Addressing Mass Migration Through the Southern Border of the United \nStates, 84 Fed. Reg. 21,229 (May 13, 2019).  It is uncontested that together, these actions make \naliens (with the sole exception of lawful permanent residents) ineligible for asylum if they enter \nthe United States from Mexico outside a designated port of entry.   \nPlaintiffs in these consolidated cases are nineteen individuals from Honduras, El \nSalvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala who entered the United States from Mexico outside ports of \nentry after November 9, 2018, and two nonprofit organizations that provide legal services to \nrefugees.  All but one of the individual plaintiffs seek asylum, and the remaining plaintiff was \ngranted asylum during the pendency of this proceeding but fears revocation if the Rule is \nenforced, Dkt. 80 at 3.  Together, Plaintiffs challenge the lawfulness of the Rule on multiple \ngrounds.  First and foremost, they contend that the Rule runs afoul of the Immigration and \nNationality Act (“INA”), Pub. L. No. 82-414, 66 Stat. 163 (1952) (codified as amended at 8 \nU.S.C. § 1101 et seq.), which declares that “[a]ny alien who is physically present in the United \nStates or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port of arrival . . .) \nirrespective of such alien’s status, may apply for asylum.”  8 U.S.C. § 1158.  In other words, \naliens have a statutory right to seek asylum regardless of whether they enter the United States at \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 3 of 77\na designated port of entry, and Defendants may not extinguish that statutory right by regulation \nor proclamation.   \nBeyond that core challenge, Plaintiffs also argue that the Rule: (1) circumvents the \nstatutorily-mandated process for promulgating “additional limitations and conditions” on \neligibility for asylum, which authorizes the Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity to add limitations and conditions “by regulation,” 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(2)(C), but does \nnot authorize the President to do so by proclamation; (2) violates the William Wilberforce \nTrafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (“TVPRA”), Pub. L. No. 110-457, 122 Stat. \n5044 (2008), by depriving unaccompanied children of the right to seek asylum in a non-\nadversarial setting, see 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(3)(C); (3) is “arbitrary and capricious” in violation of \nthe Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); and (4) was promulgated \nwithout the required opportunity for notice and public comment, also in violation of the APA, 5 \nU.S.C. § 553.  Some of the plaintiffs also contend that the Rule violates the INA’s expedited \nremoval scheme, 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b), by mandating a negative credible fear determination for \nthose aliens who cross between ports of entry. \nSeveral motions are currently before the Court.  Plaintiffs in both consolidated cases—\nO.A. v. Trump, Civ. No. 18-2718 (“O.A.”) and S.M.S.R. v. Trump, Civ. No. 18-2838 \n(“S.M.S.R.”)—have moved for summary judgment and to certify a class of all asylum seekers \nwho entered or will enter the United States after November 9, 2018 by crossing the southern \nborder, except at a designated port of entry.  See Dkt. 51; Dkt. 52.  Defendants, in turn, oppose \nthose motions and cross-move for summary judgment, arguing that the Court lacks subject-\nmatter jurisdiction; that Plaintiffs lack standing to sue; that Plaintiffs’ claims fail on the merits; \nand that the Court should not certify a class.  See Dkt. 66.  Also pending before the Court are the \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 4 of 77\nO.A. and S.M.S.R. Plaintiffs’ earlier-filed motions for temporary and preliminary injunctive \nrelief, Dkt. 6; Mot. for Temp. Restraining Order, Dkt. 6, S.M.S.R. et al. v. Trump et al. (No. 18-\n2838), which the Court held in abeyance after the United States District Court for the Northern \nDistrict of California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction eliminating any risk of \nimminent injury to any of the plaintiffs in these actions.  See Minute Entry (Dec. 21, 2018); see \nalso E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 354 F. Supp. 3d 1094 (N.D. Cal. 2018). \nAs explained below, the Court first holds that it has subject-matter jurisdiction, and that \nPlaintiffs have Article III and zone of interests standing to challenge the Rule.  The Court also \nholds that the Rule (in conjunction with the Proclamation) is inconsistent with 8 U.S.C. § 1158.  \nThose three conclusions end the required inquiry: Because the Rule is contrary to law and must, \nas a result, be set aside, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), the Court need not consider Plaintiffs’ alternative \nlegal challenges.  Nor need the Court resolve the parties’ dispute about the propriety of \nnationwide injunctions.  As the D.C. Circuit has explained, “‘[w]hen a reviewing court \ndetermines that agency regulations are unlawful, the ordinary result is that the rules are \nvacated—not that their application to the individual [plaintiffs] is proscribed.’”  Nat’l Mining \nAss’n v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 145 F.3d 1399, 1409 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (quoting Harmon v. \nThornburgh, 878 F.2d 484, 495 n.21 (D.C. Cir. 1989)).  As a result, vacatur—i.e., nullification—\nof the Interim Final Rule obviates any need for the issuance of an injunction.  Should future \nevents dictate otherwise, Plaintiffs are free to return to the Court to seek appropriate relief at that \ntime.  Finally, although it is unclear that class certification will serve any significant purpose \ngiven vacatur of the Rule, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have met their burden under Rule 23(a) \nand Rule 23(b)(2) for certification of a class. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 5 of 77\nI.  BACKGROUND \n  Statutory and Regulatory Background \nAsylum is a form of discretionary relief that allows an otherwise removable alien who \nqualifies as a refugee to remain in the United States.1  Asylum also creates a path to lawful \npermanent resident status and citizenship and confers other benefits, including the right to work \nin the United States and to receive certain forms of financial assistance from the federal \ngovernment.  See 83 Fed. Reg. at 55,936.  Prior to 1980, “the U.S. refugee program consisted of \nad hoc responses to various crises.”  Jaya Ramji, Legislating Away International Law: The \nRefugee Provisions of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, 37 \nStan. J. Int’l L. 117, 132 (2001) (hereinafter “Legislating Away”).  In addition to legislative \nresponses to discrete concerns, see, e.g., Refugee Relief Act of 1953, Pub. L. No. 83-203, 67 \nStat. 400; Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, Pub. L. No. 89-236, 79 Stat. 913, the \nAttorney General was authorized to use his general parole authority to provide protection for \nrefugees within the United States, see INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 427 n.4 (1987).   \nThe Refugee Act of 1980 (“1980 Act”), Pub. L. No. 96-212, 94 Stat. 102 (codified at 8 \nU.S.C. §§ 1157–59 (1980)), introduced the nation’s first “uniform and systematic asylum \nprocedure” and “created the framework for the current asylum process.”  Ramji, Legislating \nAway, 37 Stan. J. Int’l L. at 132.  The 1980 Act charged the Attorney General with establishing \n“a procedure for an alien physically present in the United States or at a land border or port of \n                                                 \n1  The INA defines a “refugee” as “any person who is outside any country of such person’s \nnationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such \nperson last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or \nunwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a \nwell-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a \nparticular social group, or political opinion.”  8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42). \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 6 of 77\nentry, irrespective of such alien’s status, to apply for asylum” and authorized the Attorney \nGeneral to grant asylum in his discretion, provided that that the applicant was a refugee within \nthe meaning of the INA.  8 U.S.C. § 1158(a) (1980).  At the same time the 1980 Act established \nthe asylum process, it amended the statutory scheme governing a related form of relief—\n“withholding of deportation”—to remove the Attorney General’s discretion to decide whether to \ngrant that form of relief.  Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 428–29.  As amended by the 1980 Act, \nthe INA “requires the Attorney General to withhold deportation of an alien who demonstrates \nthat his ‘life or freedom would be threatened’ on account of one of [a list of factors] if he is \ndeported.”  Id. at 423 (emphasis added).   \nAccordingly, as of 1980, the INA included two related, but distinct, forms of relief \navailable to those subject to persecution in their country of origin: asylum and withholding of \ndeportation.  “[O]ne of the Congress’ primary purposes” in enacting “the entire 1980 Act . . . was \nto bring United States refugee law into conformance with the 1967 United Nations Protocol \nRelating to the Status of Refugees (“1967 Protocol”), 19 U.S.T. 6223, T.I.A.S. No. 6577, to \nwhich the United States acceded in 1968.”  Id. at 436–37.  The Protocol, in turn, incorporated by \nreference the substantive provisions of the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the \nStatus of Refugees (“1951 Convention”).  See id. at 429; Sale v. Haitian Ctrs. Council, Inc., 509 \nU.S. 155, 169 n.19 (1993).  Among other parallels, “the definition of ‘refugee’ that Congress \nadopted” in the 1980 Act “is virtually identical to the one proscribed by . . . the [1951] \nConvention.”  Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 437.   \nThe next relevant amendment to the INA did not come until 1996, when Congress \nenacted the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (“IIRIRA”), Pub. L. \nNo. 104-208, Div. C, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (1996).  Among other changes, IIRIRA established two \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 7 of 77\ntypes of removal proceedings.  Regular, or “formal,” removal proceedings allow aliens to \nchallenge their removal in administrative proceedings with various procedural guarantees, \nincluding the rights to written notice of the charge of removability, to counsel, to appear at a \nhearing before an immigration judge and to present evidence, to appeal an adverse decision to \nthe Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”), and to seek judicial review.  8 U.S.C. §§ 1229(a)(1), \n1229a(b)(4); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(b), 1240.11(a)(2), 1240.15.  An alien placed in formal removal \nproceedings may avoid removal by establishing, through this adversarial process, that she is \neligible for asylum, withholding of deportation, or some other form of relief.   \nThe second type of proceedings, called expedited removal, affords considerably less \nprocess to a subset of aliens—most notably, those arriving at the border and those who recently \nentered the United States without inspection.2  Under expedited removal procedures, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security may remove an alien from the United States “without further \nhearing or review[,] unless the alien indicates either an intention to apply for asylum under [8 \nU.S.C. § 1158] or a fear of persecution” supporting a claim to withholding of removal.  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(i).  If “the alien indicates either an intention to apply for asylum . . . or a fear of \n                                                 \n2  Although IIRIRA permits the Department of Homeland Security to apply expedited removal \nprocedures more broadly, 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i), (iii), the Department has traditionally \nlimited application of the expedited procedures to (1) arriving aliens; (2) aliens who arrived in \nthe United States by sea within the last two years, who have not been admitted or paroled by \nimmigration authorities; and (3) aliens found in the United States within 100 miles of the border \nwithin 14 days of entering the country, who have not been admitted or paroled by immigration \nauthorities.  See Designating Aliens Subject to Expedited Removal Under Section \n235(b)(1)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 67 Fed. Reg. 68,924 (Nov. 13, 2002); \nDesignating Aliens for Expedited Removal, 69 Fed. Reg. 48,877 (Aug. 11, 2004).  On July 23, \n2019, however, the Department issued a notice in the Federal Register outlining its intent to \n“exercise the full remaining scope of its statutory authority” to apply expedited removal \nprocedures to all aliens determined inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C) or 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1182(a)(7).  See Designating Aliens for Expedited Removal, 84 Fed. Reg. 35,409 (Jul. 23, \n2019).  \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 8 of 77\npersecution, the [immigration] officer [is required to] refer the alien for an interview by an \nasylum officer,” who must determine whether the alien has a credible “fear of persecution.”  Id. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii).  For purposes of the asylum officer’s assessment, a credible fear of \npersecution means “that there is a significant possibility . . . that the alien could establish \neligibility for asylum.”  Id. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v).3  If the asylum officer determines that the alien \nhas a credible fear, “the alien [is] detained for further consideration of the application for \nasylum,” id. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii), and is typically placed in formal removal proceedings.  If, on \nthe other hand, the asylum officer determines that the alien does not have a credible fear of \npersecution, “the officer shall order the alien removed from the United States without further \nhearing or review.”  Id. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(I).   \nAn alien who is ineligible for asylum or is denied asylum may apply for other forms of \nrelief, including withholding of removal in cases in which the alien can show “that it is more \nlikely than not that he or she would be persecuted on account of” a protected ground if removed \nfrom the United States.4  8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(2); see also 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3).  Withholding \nof removal, accordingly, requires a more substantial showing than the “well-founded fear of \n                                                 \n3  The standard necessary to establish a “credible fear” is lower than the standard for obtaining \nasylum itself.  The Supreme Court has indicated that ultimately to prevail on an asylum claim, \napplicants must establish that there is roughly a 10% chance that they will be persecuted on \naccount of a protected ground if they are returned to their country of origin.  See Cardoza-\nFonseca, 480 U.S. at 431–32.  To prevail at the initial credible fear interview, however, \napplicants need only show “a significant possibility” that they could establish eligibility for \nasylum.  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v). \n4  An alien can pursue withholding of removal either under the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), or \nunder regulations implementing U.S. obligations under Article 3 of the Convention Against \nTorture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (“CAT”), 8 C.F.R. \n§ 1208.16(c).  83 Fed. Reg. at 55,936.  Protection from removal under CAT requires that the \nalien “establish that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the \nproposed country of removal.”  8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(2).   \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 9 of 77\npersecution” standard applicable in asylum cases, see Kouljinski v. Keisler, 505 F.3d 534, 544 \n(6th Cir. 2007).  Unlike asylum, moreover, withholding does not preclude the government from \nremoving the alien to a third country where the alien would not face persecution, does not \nestablish a pathway to lawful permanent resident status and citizenship, and does not afford \nderivative protection for the alien’s family members.  See 83 Fed. Reg. at 55,939. \nIIRIRA also amended the asylum provision of the INA, adding language relevant to \nPlaintiffs’ challenge here.  Although the 1980 Act required the Attorney General to establish \nprocedures for an alien “physically present in the United States . . . , irrespective of such alien’s \nstatus, to apply for asylum,” 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a) (1980) (emphasis added), IIRIRA clarified that: \n[a]ny alien who is physically present in the United States or who arrives in the \nUnited States (whether or not at a designated port of arrival and including an \nalien who is brought to the United States after having been interdicted in \ninternational waters or United States waters), irrespective of such alien’s status, \nmay apply for asylum in accordance with this section or, where applicable, \nsection 1225(b) of this title [which addresses expedited removal]. \n \n8 U.S.C. § 1158(a) (emphasis added).  In addition, IIRIRA added a number of restrictions and \nlimitations on asylum.  It precludes aliens from applying for asylum, for example, (1) “if the \nAttorney General determines that the alien may be removed, pursuant to a bilateral or \nmultilateral agreement, to a country (other than the country of the alien’s nationality . . .) in \nwhich the alien’s life or freedom would not be threatened,” id. § 1158(a)(2)(A); (2) if the alien \ncannot “demonstrate[] by clear and convincing evidence” that she filed her asylum application \nwithin 1 year after their date of arrival in the United States, subject to certain exceptions, id. \n§ 1158(a)(2)(B); or (3) if the alien, again subject to certain exceptions, “previously applied for \nasylum and had such application denied,” id.§ 1158(a)(2)(C).   \nAlthough the Attorney General’s authority to grant or to deny an asylum application had \nlong been discretionary—subject only to the limitation, added in 1990, that “[a]n alien who ha[d] \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 10 of 77\nbeen convicted of an aggravated felony” could “not apply for or be granted asylum,” \nImmigration Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101–649, 104 Stat 4978 (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1158(d))—\nIIRIRA added a number of further statutory limitations on the Attorney General’s discretion to \ngrant relief.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(2).  The Attorney General, for example, may not grant \nasylum to an alien who “participated in the persecution of any person,” who has “been convicted \nby a final judgment of a particularly serious crime,” or who poses “a danger to the security of the \nUnited States.”  Id. § 1158(b)(2)(A)(i)–(ii), (iv).  Finally, of particular relevance here, Congress \ngranted the Attorney General authority to issue regulations “establish[ing] additional limitations \nand conditions, consistent with [8 U.S.C. § 1158,] under which an alien shall be ineligible for \nasylum.”  Id. § 1158(b)(2)(C). \nIn general, an alien may apply for asylum in one of three ways: (1) if she is not in any \nkind of removal proceeding, she may file an affirmative application for asylum, see 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1158(a)(1); 8 C.F.R. § 208.1(a)(1); (2) if she is subject to regular removal proceedings under 8 \nU.S.C. § 1229a, she may file a defensive application for asylum as a defense to removal, see 8 \nU.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4); 8 C.F.R. § 208.2(b); or (3) if she is subject to expedited removal \nproceedings under 8 U.S.C. § 1225, she may also file a defensive application for asylum as a \ndefense to expedited removal, see 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(f).  Special \nprocedures, however, apply to unaccompanied minors.  Under the TVPRA, an “unaccompanied \nalien child” that the Department of Homeland Security seeks to remove from the United States is \nentitled to the procedural protections afforded by formal—as opposed to expedited—removal \nproceedings, 8 U.S.C. § 1232(a)(5)(D), but is also entitled to present her claims in the first \ninstance in a non-adversarial setting, see id. § 1158(b)(3)(C).   \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 11 of 77\n  Challenged Actions \nOn November 9, 2018, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security \npromulgated the Interim Final Rule.  See 83 Fed. Reg. at 55,934.  The Rule explains, by way of \nbackground, that “the United States has seen a large increase in the number and proportion of \ninadmissible aliens subject to expedited removal who assert an intent to apply for asylum . . . and \nare subsequently placed into removal proceedings in immigration court.”  83 Fed. Reg. at \n55,935.  According to the Rule, “[m]ost of these aliens unlawfully enter the country between \nports of entry along the southern border” and the need to “surveil, apprehend, . . . process,” and \ndetain these individuals has placed strains on the Justice Department and the Department of \nHomeland Security.  Id.  Moreover, by entering the United States between ports of entry along \nthe southern border, these aliens “engage in conduct that seriously endangers themselves, any \nchildren traveling with them, and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (‘CBP’) agents who \nseek to apprehend them.”  Id.  The purpose of the Rule is to encourage aliens entering the United \nStates along the southern border to do so at a designated port of entry, where they—and their \napplications for asylum—can be processed in an orderly and efficient fashion.  Id. at 55,936.  \nThe solution to that problem, according to the Rule, is to treat aliens who enter at the southern \nborder between ports of entry as categorically ineligible for asylum.  Id.   \nRather than enact this regulatory change entirely through the Interim Final Rule, \nhowever, the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security and the President adopted the new \npolicy in two steps.  As the first step, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity amended two regulations relating to the eligibility for asylum.  As noted above, when \nCongress enacted IIRIRA, it granted the Attorney General—and, now, the Secretary of \nHomeland Security—authority to establish, by regulation, “additional limitations and conditions, \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 12 of 77\nconsistent with [8 U.S.C. § 1158], under which an alien shall be ineligible for asylum.”  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1158(b)(2)(C).  The first regulation the Rule amended deals with eligibility for asylum as a \ngeneral matter, applicable irrespective of how an alien applies for asylum.  See 8 C.F.R. § 208.13 \n(“Establishing asylum eligibility”).  Among other things, that regulation sets forth certain \n“mandatory” grounds for denial of asylum applications.  Id. § 208.13(c).  The Rule adds the \nfollowing “[a]dditional limitation on eligibility for asylum” to the existing list of mandatory \ngrounds for denial: \nFor applications filed after November 9, 2018, an alien shall be ineligible for \nasylum if the alien is subject to a presidential proclamation or other presidential \norder suspending or limiting entry of aliens along the southern border with \nMexico that is issued pursuant to [8 U.S.C. § 1185(a)(1) or 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f)] \non or after November 9, 2018 and the alien enters the United States after the \neffective  date  of  the  proclamation  or  order  contrary  to  the  terms  of  the \nproclamation or order.   \n \n83 Fed. Reg. at 55,952; 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(c)(3).  This limitation on eligibility depends on the \npromulgation of an applicable presidential proclamation.   \nIn addition, and consistent with Defendants’ “anticipat[ion] that a large number of aliens \nwho would be subject to a proclamation-based ineligibility bar would be subject to expedited-\nremoval proceedings,” 83 Fed. Reg. at 55,936, the Rule also amended the regulation governing \ncredible fear determinations in expedited removal proceedings, 8 C.F.R. § 208.30.  Under the \npre-existing regulation, an asylum officer is required to “conduct [an] interview [of the applicant] \nin a nonadversarial manner . . . to elicit all relevant and useful information bearing on whether \nthe applicant has a credible fear of persecution or torture” and must find that the alien has a \ncredible fear of persecution “if there is a significant possibility . . . the alien can establish \neligibility for asylum . . . or for withholding of removal.”  Id. § 208.30(d), (e)(2).  As amended \nby the Rule, however, the regulation now directs an asylum officer to make a “negative credible \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 13 of 77\nfear determination” if the alien is “described in [8 C.F.R.] § 208.13(c)(3).”  Id. § 208.30(e)(5)(ii).  \nAs a result, an alien subject to the new Rule automatically receives a negative credible fear \ndetermination.  Under those circumstances, the applicant is ineligible for asylum—although she \ncan still attempt to satisfy the more demanding threshold standard for withholding of removal.  \nId. \nAs the second step in adopting the regulatory change, the President issued a proclamation \nentitled “Addressing Mass Migration Through the Southern Border of the United States,” 83 \nFed. Reg. 57,661, on the same day the Rule was promulgated.5  Although entry into the United \nStates outside of a designated port of entry is already unlawful, 8 U.S.C. § 1325(a), the \nProclamation declares that “[t]he entry of any alien into the United States across the international \nboundary between the United States and Mexico is hereby suspended and limited” for a period of \nninety days or until “an agreement permits the United States to remove aliens to Mexico” \npursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(A).  83 Fed. Reg. at 57,663, Proclamation § 1.  The \nProclamation applies only prospectively, does not apply to aliens who enter at a designated port \nof entry or who are lawful permanent residents of the United States, and does not limit the right \nof any alien to be “considered for withholding of removal.”  Id. § 2(b)–(c).  The President issued \nsubsequent proclamations extending this suspension on entry for additional ninety-day periods \non February 7, 2019, see 84 Fed. Reg. 3,665, and on May 13, 2019, see 84 Fed. Reg. 21,229.  \nEven if the President declines to renew the Proclamation at some point in the future, however, \nthe bar will remain in place for those who entered the United States during the designated period.  \n                                                 \n5  The Proclamation was issued after the Interim Final Rule and is therefore not a part of the \nAdministrative Record.  See Dkt. 64.  The Court takes judicial notice of the Proclamation as a \ndocument or fact “not subject to reasonable dispute because it . . . can be accurately and readily \ndetermined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.”  Fed. R. Evid. \n201(b). \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 14 of 77\n83 Fed. Reg. at 55,941 (stating that aliens will not overcome ineligibility “merely because a \nproclamation has subsequently ceased to have effect”). \nAll agree that, taken together, the Rule and the Proclamation create a categorical bar to \nasylum for aliens who have entered the United States from Mexico outside a port of entry after \nNovember 9, 2018. \n  East Bay Sanctuary Covenant Litigation \nThe same day the Rule and the Proclamation were issued, a group of nonprofit \norganizations that provide legal and social services to immigrants filed suit in the Northern \nDistrict of California, challenging the Rule and seeking a temporary restraining order.  See \nComplaint, E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, No. 18-6810 (“East Bay”) (N.D. Cal. Nov. 9, \n2018), Dkt. 1; Motion for Temporary Restraining Order, E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, \nNo. 18-6810 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 13, 2018), Dkt. 8.  On November 19, 2018, following expedited \nbriefing and a hearing, the district court granted a nationwide temporary restraining order barring \nimplementation of the Rule until December 19, 2018, when that court was scheduled to hold a \nhearing on the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.  E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. \nTrump, 349 F. Supp. 3d 838 (N.D. Cal. 2018) (“East Bay I”).  The government promptly filed an \nemergency motion to stay the district court’s temporary restraining order pending appeal, and the \nNinth Circuit denied that motion.  See E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 909 F.3d 1219 (9th \nCir. 2018) (“East Bay II”).  The Supreme Court, in turn, also declined to stay the temporary \nrestraining order pending appeal.  Trump v. E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant, 139 S. Ct. 782 (U.S. \nDec. 21, 2018).  On December 19, 2018, the district court granted the plaintiffs’ request for a \npreliminary injunction, E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 354 F. Supp. 3d 1094, 1102 (N.D. \nCal. 2018) (“East Bay III”), and that order is currently on appeal to the Ninth Circuit, E. Bay \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 15 of 77\nSanctuary Covenant v. Trump, appeal docketed, No. 18-17274 (9th Cir. Nov. 27, 2018) (initially \ndocketed with respect to district court’s order granting temporary restraining order). \n  This Proceeding \nThe day after the Northern District of California issued the temporary restraining order in \nEast Bay I, a group of asylum seekers who crossed the southern border outside ports of entry \nafter November 9, 2018, brought suit in this Court.  See Complaint for Declaratory and \nInjunctive Relief, O.A. v. Trump, No. 18-2718 (“O.A.”) (D.D.C. Nov. 20, 2018), Dkt. 1.  The \nnext day, November 21, 2018, those plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order and \npreliminary injunction.  See Dkt. 6.  Before briefing was complete on those motions, a second \ngroup of individual plaintiffs—this time joined by two organizations, the Capital Area \nImmigrants’ Rights Coalition (“CAIR Coalition”) and Refugee and Immigrant Center for \nEducation and Legal Services, Inc. (“RAICES”)—brought suit, see Complaint, S.M.S.R. v. \nTrump, No. 18-2838 (“S.M.S.R.”) (D.D.C. Dec. 3, 2018), Dkt. 3, and also moved for a temporary \nrestraining order and preliminary injunction, see id., Dkt. 6.  Unlike the original O.A. complaint, \nthe S.M.S.R. complaint included class allegations.  See id., Dkt. 3 at 43–44 (Compl. ¶¶ 175–77).   \nThe Court held a hearing on the pending motions on December 17, 2018.  See Minute \nEntry (Dec. 17, 2018).  At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court noted that a nationwide \ntemporary restraining order was then in effect; that the Ninth Circuit had declined to stay that \norder pending appeal; that a stay application was pending before the Supreme Court; and that the \nU.S. District Court for the Northern District of California was likely to decide in the next two \ndays whether to grant a nationwide preliminary injunction.  Dkt. 41 at 123–25 (Dec. 17, 2018 \nHrg. Tr.).  In light of this state of affairs and the fact that Plaintiffs would not face any risk of \nimminent injury while an injunction issued by another court remained in effect, the Court \ndirected that the parties meet and confer about whether to proceed by way of expedited briefing \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 16 of 77\non cross-motions for summary judgment rather than motions for preliminary relief.  Id. (Dec. 17, \n2018 Hrg. Tr.).  The Court also consolidated the O.A. and S.M.S.R. cases and set December 18, \n2018, as the deadline for Plaintiffs to amend their complaints.  See Minute Order (Dec. 17, \n2018); S.M.S.R., Minute Order (Dec. 17, 2018).  Both sets of plaintiffs timely amended and \njoined additional individual plaintiffs, and the O.A. Plaintiffs added class allegations to their \ncomplaint.  See Dkt. 39 (S.M.S.R. Amend. Compl.); Dkt. 40 (O.A. Amend. Compl.).  Following a \ntelephonic status conference on December 21, 2018, the Court set a schedule for expedited \nbriefing on cross-motions for summary judgment and class certification.  See Minute Entry (Dec. \n21, 2018).  Pending resolution of those motions, and barring any intervening need to act, the \nCourt has held the O.A. and S.M.S.R. motions for temporary restraining orders and preliminary \ninjunctions in abeyance.  Id. \nThe parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment and Plaintiffs’ motions to certify a \nclass, Dkt. 51; Dkt. 52; Dkt. 66, along with Plaintiffs’ previously-filed motions for preliminary \nrelief, Dkt. 6; Mot. for Temp. Restraining Order, Dkt. 6, S.M.S.R. et al. v. Trump et al. (No. 18-\n2838), are currently before the Court.   \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nIn the normal course, summary judgment may be granted “if the pleadings, the discovery \nand disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits [or declarations] show that there is no genuine \nissue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to a judgment as matter of law.” Air \nTransp. Ass’n. of Am., Inc. v. Nat’l Mediation Bd., 719 F. Supp. 2d 26, 31–32 (D.D.C. \n2010), aff’d, 663 F.3d 476 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  “In a case involving review of a final agency action \nunder the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706, however, the Court’s role is limited to \nreviewing the administrative record, so the standard set forth in Rule 56(c) does not apply.”  Id.  \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 17 of 77\nIn the APA context, “it is the role of the agency to resolve factual issues to arrive at a decision \nthat is supported by the administrative record, whereas ‘the function of the district court is to \ndetermine whether or not as a matter of law the evidence in the administrative record permitted \nthe agency to make the decision it did.’”  Catholic Health Initiatives v. Sebelius, 658 F. Supp. 2d \n113, 117 (D.D.C. 2009) (quoting Cottage Health Sys. v. Sebelius, 631 F. Supp. 2d 80, 89–90 \n(D.D.C. 2009)).  Summary judgment serves as “the mechanism for deciding, as a matter of law, \nwhether the agency action is supported by the administrative record and otherwise consistent \nwith the APA standard of review.”  Id. (internal quotations omitted). \nIII.  ANALYSIS \n  Plaintiffs raise a host of challenges to the Rule, principally under the APA, and they seek \nto proceed on behalf of a nationwide class of “[a]ll noncitizen asylum-seekers who have entered \nor will enter the United States through the southern border but outside ports of entry after \nNovember 9, 2018,” Dkt. 52-13 at 1; Dkt. 51-16 at 1.  Among other things, they contend that the \nRule violates the INA’s mandate that an alien present in the United States is entitled to seek \nasylum “whether or not” the alien arrived in the United States “at a designated port of arrival,” \nand “irrespective of [the] alien’s status.”  8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1).  They further contend that the \nRule violates a range of laws designed to protect the rights of aliens and unaccompanied alien \nchildren to seek asylum and the right of the public to participate in the regulatory process.  \nBefore reaching any of these questions, however, the Court must address a series of threshold \nissues, including statutory jurisdiction, Article III standing, and zone of interests standing.  After \nresolving those issues, the Court will turn to the merits.  Finally, the Court will consider the \nappropriate remedy and Plaintiffs’ motions for class certification. \n \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 18 of 77\n  Threshold Issues  \n \n1.  Statutory Jurisdiction \nDefendants devote the lion’s share of their briefing to the question of this Court’s \nstatutory jurisdiction over the individual plaintiffs’ claims.6  In Defendants’ view, the individual \nplaintiffs will have an opportunity to challenge the Rule if they are eventually subject to final \norders of removal; they cannot, however, short-circuit the process that Congress established for \njudicial review in the courts of appeals only after issuance of a final order of removal.  The \nindividual plaintiffs are bound to follow that process, Defendants contend, because all but one of \nthe individual plaintiffs are now in full removal proceedings, and the one plaintiff who is no \nlonger in removal proceedings has received asylum and, thus, no longer has standing to \nchallenge the Rule.  As a result, according to Defendants, each of the individual plaintiffs with a \nlive claim is subject to two relevant statutory provisions:  8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(5), which mandates \nthat “a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals [pursuant to the Hobbs Act] \nshall be the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of an order of removal,” and 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(b)(9), which consolidates “[j]udicial review of all questions of law and fact . . . arising \nfrom any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the United States” into \n“judicial review of a final order” of removal.  As Defendants read these provisions, this Court \nlacks statutory jurisdiction to consider any challenge to an agency action (1) that occurs in the \ncourse of removal proceedings, or (2) that the individual plaintiffs could challenge in those \nproceedings.  Dkt. 22 at 27; see also Dkt. 66 at 34–35.  On this telling, the individual plaintiffs \n                                                 \n6  Defendants do not argue that this Court lacks statutory jurisdiction over the organizational \nplaintiffs’ claims. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 19 of 77\nbrought their challenge in the wrong place (in this Court, as opposed to a court of appeals) and at \nthe wrong time (prior to receiving any final order of removal).   \nPlaintiffs, for their part, understand the nature of their lawsuit and the judicial review \nprovisions of the INA in very different terms.  As they explain it, this suit does not challenge any \norder of removal, nor does it “arise from” any removal proceeding.  Rather, they challenge the \nvalidity of the Rule on its face, without regard to any particular application, based on a host of \nsubstantive and procedural flaws in the rulemaking.  Nor, in Plaintiffs’ view, is the Rule itself \ninextricably tied to removal proceedings, as Defendants contend.  To the contrary, the Rule \naffects anyone seeking asylum, whether the asylum seeker applies affirmatively—that is, outside \nof any removal proceeding—or defensively—that is, within the confines of either a formal or \nexpedited removal proceeding.  Indeed, Plaintiffs argue, many of the individual plaintiffs “were \nin neither expedited nor ordinary removal proceedings when they filed this suit.”  See, e.g., Dkt. \n52-1 at 24–25 & n.8.  As a result, as Plaintiffs see it, § 1252’s channeling rules, which apply only \nto claims arising from actions taken and decisions rendered in removal proceedings, have \nnothing to do with this case.   \nBut even if that view of § 1252’s jurisdictional provisions is incorrect, Plaintiffs contend \nthat this Court has jurisdiction to consider at least some of the individual plaintiffs’ claims under \n8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3), which authorizes judicial review in this Court to determine whether “any \nregulation issued to implement” the expedited removal provision of the INA is “consistent with \nthe applicable provisions” of the statute.  Defendants concede that at least one of the individual \nplaintiffs, A.V., was in expedited removal proceedings at the time the original complaint and \namended complaint were filed.  See Dkt. 22 at 29; Dkt. 90 at 11 (Defs’ SUMF ¶ 46).  It was only \nafter suit was brought that the government inexplicably moved her from expedited removal to \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 20 of 77\nfull removal—without conducting an initial credible fear interview—on the eve of oral \nargument.  This matters, according to Plaintiffs, because jurisdiction must be assessed at the time \nan action is commenced.  And, finally, even putting that principle aside, Plaintiffs argue that two \nindividual plaintiffs—an unaccompanied minor who is entitled to present his asylum request in \nthe first instance to an asylum officer outside the context of full removal proceedings and a \nplaintiff who received asylum, but fears that the government will revoke that status if the Rule is \nallowed to stand—are not subject to full removal proceedings (and thus are not subject to the \nchanneling rules Defendants invoke) even to this day. \n“Within constitutional bounds, Congress decides what cases the federal courts have \njurisdiction to consider.”  Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 212 (2007).  As a general rule, federal \ndistrict courts have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 over “all civil actions arising under the \nConstitution, law, or treaties of the United States.”  But Congress may curtail that grant of \njurisdiction “by establishing an alternative statutory scheme for administrative and judicial \nreview.”  Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps., AFL-CIO v. Trump, No. 18-5289, 2019 WL 3122446 at *3 \n(D.C. Cir. July 16, 2019).  Here, Defendants invoke two provisions of the INA—§ 1252(a)(5) \nand § 1252(b)(9)—and argue that, taken together, these provisions divest this Court of \njurisdiction to adjudicate the individual plaintiffs’ claims.  For the reasons explained below, the \nCourt concludes that the individual plaintiffs’ claims fall “outside the text of [the] jurisdiction-\nchanneling provision[s]” and, thus, “may proceed in the district court.”  Gen. Elec. Co. v. \nJackson, 610 F.3d 110, 127 (D.C. Cir. 2010). \na.  8 U.S.C. 1252(a)(5) \nDefendants do not contend that § 1252(a)(5), standing alone, divests this Court of \njurisdiction but, rather, argue that it does so in conjunction with § 1252(b)(9).  A close reading of \n§ 1252(a)(5), however, reveals that it adds little to Defendants’ argument.   \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 21 of 77\nThe Court starts, as it must, with the statute’s text.  See BP Am. Prod. Co. v. Burton, 549 \nU.S. 84, 91 (2006).  Section 1252 begins with § 1252(a)(1), which provides that “[j]udicial \nreview of a final order of removal . . . is governed only by [the Hobbs Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2341–\n51], except as provided in subsection (b) and except that the court [of appeals] may not order the \ntaking of additional evidence under [28 U.S.C. § 2374(c)].”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(1) (emphasis \nadded).  Under the Hobbs Act, in turn, the federal courts of appeals—and not the district \ncourts—are vested with exclusive jurisdiction to determine “the validity of” and to enjoin or to \nset aside, “in whole or in part, the order of the agency” at issue.  28 U.S.C. § 2349.  As a result, \none need read no further than the first sentence of § 1252 to find that the “only” way to obtain \njudicial review of a final order of removal is by filing a petition in the appropriate court of \nappeals.  8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(1). \nSection 1252(a)(5) clarifies that the § 1252(a)(1) process is the “exclusive means of \nreview” of an order of removal.  8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(5).  That provision provides:   \nNotwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  law  (statutory  or  nonstatutory), \nincluding section 2241 of Title 28, or any other habeas corpus provision, and \n[the  Mandamus  and  All  Writs  Acts],  a  petition  for  review  filed  with  an \nappropriate court of appeals . . . shall be the sole and exclusive means for judicial \nreview of an order of removal [with the exception of expedited removal orders].  \nFor purposes of this chapter, in every provision that limits or eliminates judicial \nreview or jurisdiction to review, the terms ‘judicial review’ and ‘jurisdiction to \nreview’ include habeas corpus review pursuant to section 2241 of Title 28, or \nany other habeas corpus provision, [the Mandamus and All Writs Act], and \nreview pursuant to any other provision of law (statutory or nonstatutory). \n \n8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(5).  Taken together, § 1252(a)(1) and § 1252(a)(5) establish a comprehensive \nrule:  Section 1252(a)(1) defines the only means for obtaining “[j]udicial review of a final order \nof removal,” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(1), and § 1252(a)(5) provides that “a petition for review filed \nwith an appropriate court of appeals” is “the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of an \norder of removal,” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(5).  An aggrieved party cannot circumvent the Hobbs Act \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 22 of 77\nprocedure by filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, a mandamus petition, an All Writs Act \naction, or any other statutory or nonstatutory claim in federal district court.  The exclusive means \nof obtaining judicial review of an order of removal is the Hobbs Act.  That much is clear. \nThe work that § 1252(a)(5) does in clarifying that the Hobbs Act remedy is exclusive and \nnot subject to circumvention, however, does nothing to advance the inquiry here.  Congress did \nnot declare that any legal challenge relating to the immigration laws and regulations must be \nbrought under the Hobbs Act.  Instead, at least as far as § 1252(a)(1) and § 1252(a)(5) go, \nCongress provided an “exclusive means for judicial review of an order of removal.”  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(a)(5) (emphasis added); see also 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(1) (providing procedure for \n“[j]udicial review of a final order or removal”).  Here, however, Plaintiffs do not seek review of \nan “order or removal,” nor do they challenge anything that has occurred in the course of a \nremoval proceeding.  Rather, they bring a facial challenge to the validity of a regulation of \ngeneral applicability based on the administrative record generated in the rulemaking.  The plain \nlanguage of § 1252(a) and § 1252(a)(5) makes clear that those provisions do not, standing alone, \napply to Plaintiffs’ challenge. \nThis reading of § 1252(a)(5) invites an obvious retort:  If § 1252(a)(1) provides that \njudicial review of a final order of removal is subject to review “only” under the Hobbs Act, what \nfunction does § 1252(a)(5) perform?  The answer to that question is found in the statutory history \nof the INA.  At one time, a petition for a writ of habeas corpus provided the sole means of \nchallenging the lawfulness of an deportation order.7  See Heikkila v. Barber, 345 U.S. 229, 230, \n                                                 \n7  Prior to 1996, aliens who entered the country without inspection were deemed deportable and \nplaced into deportation proceedings.  In contrast, aliens arriving at the border were deemed \nexcludable and placed into exclusion proceedings.  See Judulang v. Holder, 132 S. Ct. 476, 479 \n(2011).  With the passage of IIRIRA in 1996, Congress changed that nomenclature and created \n \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 23 of 77\n234–36 (1953).  Then, for a period of time, the Supreme Court held that although the detailed \nhearing procedures specified by the APA did not apply to deportation hearings under the INA, \nsee Marcello v. Bonds, 349 U.S. 302 (1955); Ardestani v. INS, 502 U.S. 129, 133 (1991), the \nAPA’s judicial review provisions did, see Shaughnessy v. Pedreiro, 349 U.S. 48, 50–52 (1955).  \nIn 1961, Congress introduced the Hobbs Act remedy for deportation orders, but explicitly \nretained habeas review of these orders.  INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 309–10 (2001).  When \nCongress enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (“AEDPA”), Pub. L. No. \n104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), however, it repealed the provision permitting aliens to challenge \ndeportation orders in habeas, and when Congress enacted IIRIRA later that year, it replaced the \nremaining jurisdictional rules that Congress enacted in 1961 with a version of the rules currently \nset forth in § 1252.  Thus, as of 1996, the Hobbs Act provided the “only” process for obtaining \njudicial review of a final order of removal following full removal proceedings. \nCongress did not enact § 1252(a)(5) until 2005, following the Supreme Court’s decision \nin INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001).  St. Cyr held that, notwithstanding § 1252(a)(1)’s \ndeclaration that “[j]udicial review of a final order of removal . . . is governed only by” the Hobbs \nAct, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(1) (emphasis added), criminal aliens who were otherwise barred from \nobtaining judicial review could invoke the district court’s habeas jurisdiction.  533 U.S. at 314.  \nIn response, Congress enacted § 1252(a)(5), along with other changes to § 1252, to offer a “clear, \nunambiguous, and express statement of congressional intent to preclude judicial consideration on \nhabeas of” certain claims, id. at 314.  See H.R. Conf. Rep. 109-72 at 80–81.  Understood in this \nlight, § 1252(a)(5) does not expand the scope of § 1252(a)(1) or reach agency action unrelated to \n                                                 \n“removal” proceedings for all aliens, regardless of whether they had already entered the country \nor were apprehended at the border.  Id.   \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 24 of 77\na removal proceeding.  Rather, it merely reaffirms that Congress has provided a single means for \nobtaining judicial review of removal orders. \n  Because Plaintiffs do not seek review of a removal order—or, indeed, of any decision or \naction taken in the course of a removal proceeding—§ 1252(a)(5) has no bearing on the Court’s \nstatutory jurisdiction.   \nb.  8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9) \nDefendants rely primarily on § 1252(b)(9), which channels “[j]udicial review of all \nquestions of law and fact . . . arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an \nalien” into “judicial review of [the] final order” of removal.  Courts have, at times, described \n§ 1252(b)(9) as “‘vise-like’ in grip[,] . . . swallow[ing] up virtually all claims that are tied to \nremoval proceedings.”  J.E.F.M. v. Lynch, 837 F.3d 1026, 1031 (9th Cir. 2016) (quoting Aguilar \nv. ICE, 510 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2007)).  But courts have also recognized that § 1252(b)(9) “has \nbuilt-in limits,” id. at 1032.  By its own terms, § 1252(b)(9) applies only to claims that arise from \nremoval proceedings.  See Nielsen v. Preap, 139 S. Ct. 954, 962 (2019) (plurality opinion); \nJennings v. Rodriguez, 138 S. Ct. 830, 840–41 (2018) (plurality opinion); id. at 876 (Breyer, J., \ndissenting).  That limitation is determinative here.  \nThe Court begins, once again, with the statutory text, see BP Am. Prod. Co., 549 U.S. at \n91, which provides in relevant part:  \n(b)  Requirements for review of orders of removal \n \nWith respect to review of an order of removal under subsection (a)(1), the \nfollowing requirements apply: \n. . . . \n \n(9)  Consolidation of questions for judicial review \n \nJudicial review of all questions of law and fact, including interpretation and \napplication of constitutional and statutory provisions, arising from any action \ntaken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the United States under \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 25 of 77\nthis subchapter shall be available only in judicial review of a final order under \nthis section.  Except as otherwise provided in this section, no court shall have \njurisdiction, by habeas corpus under [28 U.S.C. § 2241] or any other habeas \nprovision, by [28 U.S.C. § 1361 (mandamus) or § 1651 (All Writs Act)], or by \nany other provision of law (statutory or nonstatutory), to review such an order \nor such questions of law or fact. \n \n8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9).  The Supreme Court has characterized § 1252(a)(9) “as a ‘zipper clause,’” \nwhich “consolidate[s] ‘judicial review’ of immigration proceedings into one action in the court \nof appeals.”  St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 313 (quoting Reno v. Am.-Arab Discrimination Comm., 525 \nU.S. 471, 483 (1999) (“AADC”)).  For present purposes, the statutory text presents two \nsignificant interpretative questions.  \n The first question focuses on the import of § 1252(b)’s introductory clause.  As the \nSupreme Court observed in St. Cyr, this clause limits the reach of § 1252(b)(9); it applies “only \n‘[w]ith respect to review of an order of removal under subsection (a)(1).’”  Id. (quoting \n§ 1252(b)(9)).  Read literally, that language might dispose of Defendants’ § 1252(b)(9) defense \nfor precisely the same reason that § 1252(a)(5) does not apply:  Plaintiffs do not seek review of \n“an order of removal.”  But, as the St. Cyr dissent explains, that reading of the statute proves too \nmuch and would, among other things, render § 1252(b)(9) meaningless.  Id. at 332 (Scalia, J., \ndissenting).  That is, if § 1252(b)(9) applies only to the review of final orders of removal, what \nwork is done by its channeling of “all questions of law and fact . . . arising from any action taken \nor proceeding brought to remove an alien” into review of the “final order” of removal?  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(b)(9). \nThe answer to that question is relatively straightforward:  If an alien subject to a removal \nproceeding wants to challenge “any action taken” to “remove” her from the United States, she \nmay do so only by seeking “judicial review of [the] final order” of removal.  See St. Cyr, 533 \nU.S. at 332 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  The zipper clause applies “[w]ith respect to review of an \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 26 of 77\norder of removal,” id. at 313 (majority opinion), because it folds all precedent challenges \n“arising from” the removal “proceeding” or “action taken . . . to remove [the] alien” into review \nof the final “order of removal,” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9).  Although offered by the St. Cyr dissent, \nthat reading of the statute is not inconsistent with the majority’s conclusion that actions that are \nnot ever subject to judicial review under § 1252(a)(1) are also not subject to § 1252(b)(9)’s \nchanneling rule, St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 313; that is, if there is no final order of removal, there is \nnothing into which to fold the precedent challenges.  Understood in this light, § 1292(b)(9) \nfunctions to consolidate all challenges arising from a removal proceeding or action taken to \nremove an alien into “review of [the final] order of removal,” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b); see also St. \nCyr, 533 U.S. at 313 (“Subsection (b)(9) simply provides for the consolidation of issues to \nbrought in petitions for ‘[j]udicial review.’”), much in the way that a party to an administrative \nadjudication must typically wait for a final decision before challenging any action taken or \nproceeding brought leading up to the final agency action, see Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, \n177–78 (1997); Scenic Am. v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., 836 F.3d 42, 55–56 (D.C. Cir. 2016).   \nThe second question focuses on the meaning of the phrase “arising from any action taken \nor proceeding brought to remove an alien from the United States.”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9).  The \nSupreme Court recently considered the meaning of that phrase in Jennings v. Rodriguez, 138 S. \nCt. 830 (2018), and Nielsen v. Preap, 139 S. Ct. 954 (2019).  Both Jennings and Preap involved \nhabeas petitions and class actions challenging the government’s authority to detain aliens, either: \n(1) subject to ongoing removal proceedings, without providing periodic bond hearings \n(Jennings); or (2) pursuant to mandatory detention rules, without regard to how long after their \nrelease from prison on criminal changes they are taken into immigration custody (Preap).  In \nboth cases, the Supreme Court held that § 1252(b)(9) did not strip the district courts of \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 27 of 77\njurisdiction.  See Preap, 139 S. Ct. at 962 (plurality opinion); see generally id. at 976–85 \n(Breyer, J., dissenting); Jennings, 138 S. Ct. at 839–41 (plurality opinion); id. at 876 (Breyer, J., \ndissenting).   \nAs Justice Alito explained for the Jennings plurality, “when confronted with capacious \nphrases like ‘arising from,’” the Court has “eschewed ‘uncritical literalism’ leading to results that \n‘no sensible person could have intended.’”  138 S. Ct. at 840 (plurality opinion) (quoting \nGobeille v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 136 S. Ct. 936, 943 (2016) (internal quotation marks omitted)).  \nThe Supreme Court, notably, took just that approach when interpreting the “very phrase” at issue \nhere as used in a subsequent provision of § 1252.  Id. at 840–41 (plurality opinion).  That \nprovision, § 1252(g), specifies that § 1252 constitutes the exclusive grant of jurisdiction “to hear \nany cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the \nAttorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against \nany alien.”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) (emphasis added).  In AADC, the Supreme Court did not \n“interpret this language to sweep in any claim that can technically be said to ‘arise from’ the \nthree listed actions of the Attorney General” but, instead, “read the language to refer to just those \nthree specific actions themselves.”  Jennings, 138 S. Ct. at 841 (plurality opinion); see id. at 876 \n(Breyer, J., dissenting).   \nHaving recognized that the phrase “arising from” does not sweep in every action or \ndecision connected in any way with the removal process, neither Jennings nor Preap endeavored \nto announce a test that would govern in all cases.  The Court did, however, hold in both cases \nthat § 1252(b)(9) did not “present a jurisdictional bar” because the respondents in those cases (1) \nwere “not asking for review of an order of removal;” (2) were “not challenging the decision to \ndetain them in the first place or to seek removal;” and (3) were “not even challenging any part of \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 28 of 77\nthe process by which their removability will be determined.”  Jennings, 138 S. Ct. at 841 \n(plurality opinion); see also Preap, 139 S. Ct. at 962 (plurality opinion) (quoting same).   \nAgainst the backdrop of St. Cyr, AADC, Preap, and Jennings, the Court concludes that \n§ 1252(b)(9) does not divest this Court of jurisdiction to adjudicate individual plaintiffs’ claims \nfor several reasons:   \nFirst, the plain language of § 1252(b)(9) applies only to claims arising from “any action \ntaken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the United States.”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9) \n(emphasis added).  In Jennings, the concurrence concluded (and the plurality assumed) that \ndetention typically “is an ‘action taken . . . to remove’ an alien.”  138 S. Ct. at 855 (Thomas, J., \nconcurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (emphasis omitted); see also id., 138 S. Ct. at \n841 n.3 (plurality opinion).  The plurality, however, expressed doubt—albeit without deciding \nthe question, which was not before the Court—that the detention of an alien “under 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii) for consideration of [his or her] asylum application[]” constitutes an “action \ntaken . . . to remove” the alien “from the United States.”  138 S. Ct. at 840 & n.2 (plurality \nopinion) (emphasis added).  The concurrence’s view that the detentions at issue in Jennings were \n“action[s] taken . . . to remove” aliens, moreover, was premised on the fact that “detention during \nremoval proceedings” is “an ‘aspect of the [removal] process.’”  Id. at 854 (Thomas, J., \nconcurring in part and concurring in the judgment).   \nHere, in contrast, Plaintiffs do not challenge any aspect of the removal process.  They do \nnot challenge or seek to set aside an order of removal, a decision to initiate removal proceedings, \nthe rejection of any defensive asylum claim, or a detention order.  Rather, they bring a series of \nfacial challenges to a regulation that applies equally to affirmative and defensive applications for \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 29 of 77\nasylum, seeking to set aside the regulation itself.8  The challenged Rule is not an “action \ntaken . . . to remove an alien from the United States,” and was not promulgated as part of a \nremoval “proceeding.”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9).  Just as it was “implausible” in AADC to construe \n“the mention of three discrete events along the way the road to deportation” in § 1252(g) as “a \nshorthand way of referring to all claims arising from deportation proceedings,” 525 U.S. at 482, \nit is implausible to construe § 1252(b)(9)’s mention of an “action taken” or a “proceeding \nbrought to remove an alien” as shorthand for any agency action that might ultimately facilitate \nthe removal of a class of aliens.  To borrow from AADC, this reading is not implausible “because \nCongress is too unpoetic to use synecdoche, but because that literary device is incompatible with \nthe need for precision in legislative drafting.”  Id. at 482.  \n                                                 \n8  Because Plaintiffs challenge the lawfulness of the Rule—and not any individual asylum \napplication or order of removal—there is no merit to Defendants’ contention, see Dkt. 22 at 30, \nthat Plaintiffs fail to satisfy the final-agency-action requirement of the APA, see 5 U.S.C. § 704.  \nAlthough the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security have invited public \ncomment on the Interim Final Rule, there is no doubt that the Rule “mark[s] the ‘consummation \nof the agenc[ies’] decisionmaking process” and that “legal consequences will flow” from it.  \nBennett, 520 U.S. at 178.  Nor is the Court convinced by Defendants’ late-asserted contention \nthat Plaintiffs’ claims are barred for failure to exhaust under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(d).  Dkt. 81 at 5.  \nThat provision merely requires an alien to “exhaust[] all administrative remedies” before “[a] \ncourt may review a final order of removal.”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(d).  Here, however, Plaintiffs have \nnot asked the Court to review a final order of removal.  Finally, the Court concludes that \nDefendants have waived their contention that Plaintiffs have an “adequate other remedy” \nprecluding review under the APA.  Dkt. 81 at 6 n.4.  That requirement, found at 5 U.S.C. § 704, \nis not jurisdictional, Trudeau v. FTC, 456 F.3d 178, 183–84 (D.C. Cir. 2006), and Defendants’ \neffort to raise it in a footnote—included in a supplemental brief that the Court authorized only to \naddress unrelated issues—is insufficient to preserve the argument.  See, e.g., CTS Corp. v. EPA, \n759 F.3d 52, 64 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (“A footnote is no place to make a substantive legal argument . \n. . hiding an argument there and then articulating it in only a conclusory fashion results in \nforfeiture.”); Elec. Privacy Info. Ctr. v. IRS, 261 F. Supp. 3d 1, 13 (D.D.C. 2017) (holding that \nclaims raised only in footnotes of party’s brief were deemed forfeited), aff’d, 910 F.3d 1232 \n(D.C. Cir. 2018); Davis v. Bud & Papa, Inc., 885 F. Supp. 2d 85, 90 (D.D.C. 2012) (“[I]t is a \nwell-settled prudential doctrine that courts generally will not entertain new arguments first raised \nin a reply brief.”). \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 30 of 77\nSecond, for similar reasons, this is not a case in which Plaintiffs seek judicial review of a \nquestion of law or fact “arising from” an action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien.  \n8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9).  Even assuming that the individual plaintiffs’ removal proceedings, and \nnot the challenged Rule, are the “action[s] taken . . . to remove” them for purposes of § \n1252(b)(9), the relevant question is “whether the legal questions in this case arise from such an \naction,” Jennings, 138 S. Ct. at 841 n.3 (plurality opinion) (emphasis omitted and added).  They \ndo not.  To the contrary, Plaintiffs ask that the Court consider a series of questions of law \n“arising from” a rulemaking of general applicability.  Among other things, they ask that the \nCourt consider whether the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security acted \nlawfully when they (1) promulgated the Rule without providing a timely opportunity for public \nnotice and comment and without publishing the rule thirty days in advance of its effective date, \n(2) adopted a regulation limiting the eligibility of a class of aliens to seek asylum based on their \nentry into the United States outside a designated port of entry; and (3) sought to adopt additional \n“conditions or limitations on the consideration of an application for asylum” by regulation, while \nceding to the President the authority to define the scope and timing of those conditions or \nlimitations by proclamation.  None of these questions arise “‘from [removal] proceedings’” or \nfrom the “‘many . . . decisions or actions that may be part of the [removal] process.’”  Jennings, \n138 U.S. at 854 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (quoting AADC, \n525 U.S. at 482–83).  Rather, they “arise from” the challenged rulemaking.   \n  Defendants’ attempts to sidestep this clear textual limitation are unavailing.  In \nDefendants’ view, § 1252(b)(9) divests the district courts of jurisdiction to adjudicate “all issues \narising from removal proceedings or that can be raised in those proceedings.”  Dkt. 22 at 27 \n(emphasis added); see also Dkt. 66 at 31.  Because the individual plaintiffs are now in removal \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 31 of 77\nproceedings and could seek to bring their procedural and substantive challenges to the Rule in \nthose individual proceedings, Defendants contend that they are obligated to do so.  But, even \naside from the fact that an immigration judge lacks the authority to set aside a regulation \npromulgated by the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, see Jafarzadeh, \n270 F. Supp. 3d 296, 310 (D.D.C. 2017), Defendants’ reading cannot be reconciled with the \nplain language of the statute.  The question is not whether an issue could be raised in removal \nproceedings, but rather whether it “arise[s] from” those proceedings.  8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9); see \nalso Jennings, 138 S. Ct. at 841 & n.3 (plurality opinion).  Nor is Defendants’ position supported \nby the cases they cite, which concern claims directly implicating the plaintiffs’ ability to defend \nthemselves in removal proceedings.  See J.E.F.M., 837 F.3d at 1029 (challenging deprivation of \nthe right to counsel in removal proceedings); Aguilar, 510 F.3d at 13–14 (same); Vetcher v. \nSessions, 316 F. Supp. 3d 70, 75 (D.D.C. 2018) (challenging access to law library to defend \nagainst removal).  The claims in those cases challenged procedures intrinsic to individual \nremoval proceedings, which “arise from” those proceedings as contemplated by § 1252(b)(9) in a \nway that a facial challenge to a regulation of general applicability does not.  \nAADC, Jennings, and Preap all make clear that the phrase “arising from” cannot be \ndivorced from the terms it modifies, thereby transforming a defined restriction on § 1331 \njurisdiction into an amorphous limitation on most, if not all, APA review of immigration rules.  \nAs the Jennings plurality explained, the phrase “arising from” appears in both § 1252(b)(9) and \n§ 1252(g)—and if courts must “read th[at] language” in § 1252(g) “to refer to just th[e] three \nspecific actions” listed in § 1252(g), courts must read § 1252(b)(9) in a similar manner.  138 S. \nCt. at 840–41 (plurality opinion).  True, the specific actions listed in § 1252(b)(9)—“any action \ntaken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the United States”—are more expansive \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 32 of 77\nthan those listed in § 1252(g)—a “decision or action . . . to commence proceedings, adjudicate \ncases, or execute removal orders against any alien.”  But the operative phrase—“arising from”—\nmust mean the same thing in both subsections, see Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U.S. 561, 570 \n(1995) (adhering to the “normal rule of statutory construction that identical words used in \ndifferent parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning” (internal quotation \nomitted)), and cannot be used in either subsection to extend the reach of the channeling rule \nbeyond the actions or proceedings identified.   \nThird, consideration of other portions of § 1252 confirms that Congress did not intend \n§ 1252(b)(9) to sweep in the sort of APA challenges to a rulemaking that Plaintiffs bring here.  \nMost notably, § 1252(b)(4)(A) specifies that the record in cases governed by §1252(a) and \n§ 1252(b)(9) “shall” consist of “only . . . the administrative record on which the order of removal \nis based.”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(A) (emphasis added).  Although that record might have some \nbearing on an individual plaintiff’s standing to sue in any particular case, it has nothing to do \nwith the challenges Plaintiffs have brought in this case.  Instead, the relevant record here consists \nof the materials the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security considered in \ndeciding whether to issue the Rule and in considering whether to invoke the APA’s exceptions to \nthe usual notice-and-comment and advanced-publication requirements.  Without that record, \nwhich § 1252(b)(4)(A) precludes the courts of appeals from considering, it is difficult to fathom \nhow meaningful judicial review of individual plaintiffs’ claims could occur.  Similarly, \n§ 1252(b)(4) sets forth the governing standards of review, which treat “administrative findings of \nfact” as “conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the \ncontrary,” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B); treat “a decision that an alien is not eligible for admission” \nas “conclusive unless manifestly contrary to law,” id. § 1252(b)(4)(C); and accord “conclusive” \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 33 of 77\nweight to “the Attorney General’s discretionary judgment whether to grant” asylum to an \napplicant “unless manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion,” id. § 1252(b)(4)(D).  \nThese standards, unique to the removal process, would leave no room for the courts of appeals to \nevaluate the lawfulness of the Rule under APA standards.  \nFourth, the Supreme Court has recognized—in similar circumstances and interpreting a \nsimilar statutory provision—that district courts have jurisdiction over “general collateral \nchallenges to [unlawful] practices and policies used by [immigration authorities].”  McNary v. \nHaitian Refugee Ctr., 498 U.S. 479, 492 (1991).  In 1986, Congress enacted the Immigration \nReform and Control Act (“IRCA”), Pub. L. No. 99-603, 100 Stat. 3359, which, among other \nthings, allowed alien farmworkers who had resided in the United States and performed at least \nninety days of qualifying agricultural work during a specified period to apply for adjustment of \nstatus to “special agricultural workers” (“SAWs”).  8 U.S.C. § 1160(a).  IRCA, however, \nallowed only limited “administrative or judicial review of a determination respecting an \napplication for adjustment of status” and, in particular, provided that “[t]here shall be judicial \nreview of such a denial only in the judicial review of an order of exclusion or deportation.”  Id. § \n1160(e).  In McNary, the plaintiffs challenged certain “practices and policies” adopted by the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”)—the predecessor agency to the United States \nCitizenship and Immigration Service—“in [the] administration of the SAW program.”  498 U.S. \nat 487.  In response to the government’s contention that the district court lacked jurisdiction to \nconsider that challenge, the Supreme Court held that § 1160(e) did not divest the district court of \njurisdiction over the plaintiffs’ pattern or practice claims.  Id. at 491–95.   \nMcNary premised its holding on two relevant considerations, both of which apply in the \npresent context with equal or greater force.  First, and most significantly, the Supreme Court \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 34 of 77\nfocused on the words of the jurisdiction-limiting provision, which applied only to judicial review \n“‘of a determination respecting an application’ for SAW status,” and which channeled only \n“‘judicial review of such a denial’” into the Hobbs Act procedures for reviewing final exclusion \nor deportation orders.  Id. at 492 (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1160(e)(1) and (e)(3)).  Like the provision \nat issue in McNary, § 1252(b)(9) applies to challenges to specific actions—that is, “any action \ntaken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the United States,” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9) \n(emphasis added)—and not to challenges of the type Plaintiffs press here.9  Jafarzadeh, 270 F. \n                                                 \n9  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit observed that, in enacting IIRIRA, “Congress was \nlegislating against the backdrop of recent Supreme Court law,” and that McNary “offered a \nblueprint for how Congress could draft a jurisdiction-channeling statute that would cover not \nonly individual challenges to agency decisions, but also broader challenges to agency policies \nand practices.”  J.E.F.M., 837 F.3d at 1034.  According to the Ninth Circuit, that “blueprint” \nappeared in the following passage:  \n[H]ad Congress intended the limited review provisions of [§ 1160(e)] . . . to \nencompass challenges to INS procedures and practices, it could easily have used \nbroader statutory language.  Congress could, for example, have . . . channel[ed]  \ninto the Reform Act’s special review procedures “all causes . . . arising under \nany of the provisions” of the legalization program.  It moreover could have \nmodeled [§ 1160(e)] on 38 U.S.C. § 211(a), which governs review of veterans’ \nbenefit claims, by referring to review “on all questions of law and fact” under \nthe SAW legalization program. \nMcNary, 498 U.S. at 494.  Congress’s use of the phrase “all questions of law and fact” in \n§ 1252(b)(9) led the Ninth Circuit to conclude that Congress must have intended to “include[e] \npolicies-and-practices challenges” in § 1252(b)(9)’s channeling provisions.  J.E.F.M., 837 F.3d \nat 1029.  That might be right with respect to certain types of policy and practice claims but, if \nanything, the “blueprint” that the Supreme Court offered in McNary counsels against the \nconclusion that § 1252(b)(9) reaches Plaintiffs’ challenge here.  To be sure, the model that the \nMcNary Court referenced—38 U.S.C. § 211(a)—used the phrase “any question of law or fact.”  \n38 U.S.C. § 211 (1982).  But what matters is what comes next:  Section 211(a) did not identify a \nparticular type of proceeding in which such questions might arise but, rather, applied the any-\nquestion-of-law-or-fact standard to all “[t]he decisions of the Administrator [of Veterans Affairs] \n. . . under any law administered by the Veterans’ Affairs Administration providing benefits for \nveterans.”  Id.  Had Congress followed that sweeping blueprint here, it would have provided for \nHobbs Act review of “all questions of law and fact” arising from decisions of the Department of \nJustice or the Department of Homeland Security “under any law administered by” either agency \nrelating to immigration. \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 35 of 77\nSupp. 3d at 309.  Second, the Supreme Court stressed that the statutory scheme at issue in \nMcNary limited review to the “administrative record,” and specified that “‘the findings of fact \nand determinations contained in such record shall be conclusive unless the applicant can \nestablish abuse of discretion or that the findings are directly contrary to clear and convincing \nfacts contained in the record considered as a whole.’”  McNary, 498 U.S. at 493 (quoting 8 \nU.S.C. § 1160(e)(3)(B)).  Because that administrative record did not speak to the type of \nchallenge that the McNary plaintiffs brought, and because the “‘abuse-of discretion’ standard” \nmade “no sense” if the judicial review provisions were read to encompass pattern or practice \nclaims, the Court further concluded that “the language of” § 1160(e)(3)(B) added “substantial \ncredence to the conclusion that [IRCA’s] review provision [did] not apply to challenges to the \nINS’[s] practices and procedures in administering the SAW program.”  Id. at 493–94.  For the \nreasons explained above, the same conclusion applies here.  In short, “as in McNary, [P]laintiffs \nraise claims that are outside the scope of the administrative process.”  Jafarzadeh, 270 F. Supp. \n3d at 309.   \nThe D.C. Circuit’s “cases interpreting McNary hew to [the] distinction between collateral \nand particularized claims” and hold that similar jurisdiction-limiting provisions “only bar \nclaimants from circumventing statutory provisions that give appellate courts jurisdiction to hear \ntheir . . . challenges.”  Gen. Elec. Co., 610 F.3d at 126–27.  That distinction also coheres with \nother Supreme Court precedent holding that “[p]rovisions for agency review do not restrict \njudicial review unless the ‘statutory scheme’ displays a ‘fairly discernible’ intent to limit \njurisdiction, and the claims at issue ‘are of the type Congress intended to be reviewed within \nth[e] statutory structure.’”  Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. \n477, 489 (2010) (quoting Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200, 207, 212 (1994)).  \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 36 of 77\nUnder that line of authority, courts must “presume that Congress does not intend to limit \njurisdiction if ‘a finding of preclusion could foreclose all meaningful judicial review’; if the suit \nis ‘wholly collateral to a statute’s review provisions’; and if the claims are ‘outside the agency’s \nexpertise.’”  Id. at 489–90 (quoting Thunder Basin Coal Co., 510 U.S. at 212–13 (emphasis \nadded)); see also Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps., AFL-CIO, 2019 WL 3122446, at *3. \nAdopting Defendants’ position here “could” deprive some or all of the individual \nplaintiffs of “meaningful judicial review.”  Thunder Basin Coal Co., 510 U.S. at 212–13.  \nConsider just one example.  Those who seek asylum often also seek withholding of removal, \nwhich holds applicants to a higher standard of proof and affords fewer benefits if granted—most \nnotably, it does not provide a path to lawful permanent resident status or citizenship.  See 83 Fed. \nReg. at 55,939.  As a result, if an individual plaintiff is denied asylum but granted withholding of \nremoval, she will not be subject to a final order of removal and will not, in all likelihood, have \nthe opportunity to obtain judicial review of the asylum denial under § 1252(a).10  See, e.g., \nKarshe v. Gonzales, 161 F. App’x 726, 2006 WL 64426 at *1 (9th Cir. 2006); Zeng v. INS, 83 F. \nApp’x 264, 2003 WL 22977463 at * 1 (9th Cir. 2003).  Requiring an individual plaintiff to \nforego a claim for withholding of removal—and thus subject themselves to the risk of removal—\nin order to obtain judicial review of an asylum denial would arguably violate U.S. treaty \nobligations.  See Article 33(1), United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, \n189 U.N.T.S. 150, 176 (1954), reprinted in 19 U.S.T. 6259, 6276, T.I.A.S. No. 6577 (1968); \nCardoza–Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 428–29; Murray v. Schooner Charming Betsy, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) \n                                                 \n10  Although the Court need not decide for present purposes whether any post-McNary Supreme \nCourt precedent is to the contrary, the Court notes the D.C. Circuit has held: “Properly read, . . . \nMcNary’s conclusion that the immigration statute’s jurisdiction-stripping provision presented no \nbar to a pattern and practice suit did not depend on the unavailability of alternative means of \njudicial review.”  Gen. Elec. Co., 610 F.3d at 126. \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 37 of 77\n64, 118 (1804) (holding that a statute “ought never to be construed to violate the law of nations if \nany other possible construction remains”).  But, even putting that question of international law \naside, it would constitute “an odd procedure for Congress to choose” to provide for judicial \nreview of the Rule, Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 490, and distinguishes this case from \nprecedents holding that a plaintiff’s inability “to obtain pre-implementation’ review” of a \nchallenged practice does not deprive the plaintiff of all meaningful judicial review, Am. Fed’n of \nGov’t Emps., AFL-CIO, 2019 WL 3122446, at *4. \nPlaintiffs’ challenges are also “wholly collateral,” Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 489, to \n“any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the United States,” 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(b)(9).  As explained above, the action challenged is the Attorney General and Secretary \nof Homeland Security’s promulgation of the Interim Final Rule; Plaintiffs do not seek to \noverturn any asylum decision and do not challenge anything occurring in any removal \nproceeding.  “[N]either the immigration judge nor the Board of Immigration Appeals can \nreview” whether the Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security complied with the \nsubstantive and procedural requirements of the APA when they promulgated the Interim Final \nRule.  Jafarzadeh, 270 F. Supp. 3d at 310.   \nFinally, for similar reasons, Plaintiffs’ challenges “are also outside the . . . competence \nand expertise” of asylum officers, immigration judges, and the BIA.  Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. \nat 478.  Nothing within the expertise of these decisionmakers will have any bearing on the claims \nPlaintiffs assert.  To the contrary, because Plaintiffs challenge the Rule—and not its \nimplementation—the relevant facts, expert judgments, and theory of statutory interpretation that \nthe Court must review reside in the Administrative Record and in the Rule itself.  See SEC v. \nChenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 196 (1947); Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc., v. Volpe, 401 \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 38 of 77\nU.S. 402, 419–20 (1971); Comm. for Creative Non-Violence v. Lujan, 908 F.2d 992, 997 (D.C. \nCir. 1990).  It is, in other words, “black-letter administrative law that in an [APA] case, a \nreviewing court should have before it neither more nor less information than did the agency \nwhen it made its decision.”  CTS Corp. v. EPA, 759 F.3d 52, 64 (D.C. Cir. 2014).  Nor is there \nany reason to believe, in the circumstances of this case, that an immigration judge or the BIA \nwould have any relevant expertise to bring to bear on the administrative law questions the case \nposes or that they would be better situated than the Court to determine whether phrases like “may \napply” and “is eligible” mean the same thing.  This is not a case that requires detailed knowledge \nof a complex regulatory scheme.  In short, nothing an asylum officer, an immigration judge, or \nthe BIA might offer “could ‘obviate the need to address’ . . . [Plaintiffs’] statutory claims,” could \n“moot” one or more of those claims, or is likely meaningfully to inform the judiciary’s \nconsideration of Plaintiffs’ facial challenge to the Interim Final Rule.  Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps., \nAFL-CIO, No. 18-5289, 2019 WL 3122446, at *8 (quoting Jarkesy v. SEC, 803 F.3d 9, 29 (D.C. \nCir. 2015)). \nFor all of these reasons, the Court concludes that it has federal question jurisdiction over \nthe individual plaintiffs’ claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, and that nothing in § 1252(a)(5) or \n§ 1252(b)(9) divests this Court of that jurisdiction. \nc.  8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3) \nThe parties have also devoted considerable attention to whether the Court has jurisdiction \nover at least some of the individual plaintiffs’ claims, in any event, under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3).  \nThat provision confers original jurisdiction on the United States District Court for the District of \nColumbia to review “determinations” made in the implementation of the expedited removal \nprovisions of the INA, including jurisdiction to decide “whether . . . any regulation issued to \nimplement [the expedited removal provision] is . . . in violation of law.”  8 U.S.C. \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 39 of 77\n§ 1252(e)(3)(A).  Any such challenge must be brought “no later than 60 days after the date the \nchallenged . . . regulation is first implemented,” id. § 1252(e)(3)(b), and the court may not \n“certify a class under Rule 23,” id. § 1252(e)(1)(B).  Section 1252(e)(3) is potentially relevant \nhere because the Rule amends both the general regulation applicable to asylum eligibility and the \nregulation specifically applicable in expedited removal proceedings.  See 83 Fed. Reg. at 55,952 \n(amending both 8 C.F.R. § 208.13 and 8 C.F.R. § 208.30). \nAccording to Defendants, § 1252(e)(3) does not provide this Court with jurisdiction \nbecause none of the individual plaintiffs are currently in expedited removal proceedings.  Dkt. 81 \nat 2–3.  That contention, however, disregards the maxim that, at least for cases originally filed in \nfederal court, subject matter jurisdiction “depends upon the state of things at the time the action \nis brought,” Mollan v. Torrance, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 537, 539 (1824); see also Grupo Dataflux v. \nAtlas Glob. Grp. L.P., 541 U.S. 567, 570–71 (2004) (“[T]ime-of-filing rule is hornbook law \n(quite literally) taught to first-year law students in any basic course on federal civil procedure.”), \nor, if a complaint is amended in a manner that affects the jurisdictional allegations, subject \nmatter jurisdiction is determined at the time the amended complaint is filed, see Rockwell Int’l \nCorp. v. United States, 549 U.S. 457, 473 (2007) (noting, for example, that “withdrawal of \n[relevant] allegations” may divest the court of jurisdiction, “unless they are replaced by others \nthat establish jurisdiction”).  Where multiple plaintiffs assert claims seeking precisely the same \ndeclaratory or injunctive relief, moreover, and where the court has subject matter jurisdiction to \nconsider the claims of at least one of those plaintiffs, the court need not address its jurisdiction to \nconsider the claims of the remaining plaintiffs.  See, e.g., Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. \n417, 434–35 (1998) (Article III jurisdiction); Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 721 (1986) \n(same); Sec’y of the Interior v. California, 464 U.S. 312, 319 n.3 (1984) (same).  As a result, \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 40 of 77\nPlaintiffs need only demonstrate that the Court has jurisdiction under § 1252(e)(3) over the \nclaims of at least one of the individual plaintiffs. \nAlthough the parties dispute whether a number of the individual plaintiffs (D.R., P.R., \nG.R., L.C.V.R., C.S.C.C., R.G.G., N.A.G.A., K.P.P.V., R.D.P.V., and Y.A.L.P.) remained in \nexpedited removal proceedings on December 18, 2018—the day the O.A. and S.M.S.R. Plaintiffs \nfiled their amended complaints—Defendants concede that at least one plaintiff, A.V., was in \nexpedited removal proceedings until at least May 24, 2019.11  See Dkt. 90 at 11 (Defs’ SUMF \n¶ 46) (“After entering the United States on November 11, 2018, Plaintiff A.V. was issued a \nNotice and Order of Expedited Removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1) on November 12, 2018.”); \nDkt. 22 at 29; Dkt. 66 at 19.  Indeed, as of May 29, 2019—the day the Court held oral \nargument—“the government had not notified either A.V. or [her counsel] that she had been \nissued a Notice to Appear and placed into ordinary removal proceedings.”  Dkt. 80-1 at 4 (Walsh \nDecl. ¶ 15).  Thus, on the day A.V. filed suit and on the day she filed her amended complaint, \nshe was in expedited removal proceedings under § 1225. \nDefendants do not take issue with the rule that statutory jurisdiction is, in the usual \ncourse, decided based on the facts as they existed at the time the complaint or amended \ncomplaint was filed.  That rule, moreover, is entirely sensible.  It would hardly promote “the just, \nspeedy, and inexpensive determination of every action and proceeding,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 1, for \n                                                 \n11  The parties disagree, for example, about when, as a factual matter, the Department of \nHomeland Security made final credible fear determinations as to plaintiffs D.R. and P.R., \ncompare Dkt. 81 at 2 n.1, with Dkt. 85 at 1–2; and whether, as a legal matter, aliens remain in \nexpedited removal proceedings until they receive a credible fear interview, until they receive a \nNotice to Appear without a time and date, until they receive a Notice to Appear with a time and \ndate, or until their Notice to Appear is filed with the immigration court, compare Dkt. 85 at 2; \nDkt. 80 at 7–8, with Dkt. 81 at 4.  The Court notes, however, that the Department’s own \nregulations specify that full removal proceedings are not commenced until the Notice to Appear \nis filed with the immigration court.  See 8 C.F.R. § 1239.1. \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 41 of 77\nexample, for one court—properly vested with statutory jurisdiction—to spend weeks, months, or \nyears adjudicating a case, only to yield jurisdiction to an entirely different court based on \nintervening events, and for the second court to need to start from square one.  Departing from the \nestablished rule would also invite forum shopping and other mischief, at least to the extent that \none or more of the parties to the litigation is able to affect the court’s statutory jurisdiction based \non their post-complaint actions.  The usual rule, moreover, dates back to the early days of the \nrepublic, see Mollan, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) at 539, and Congress has legislated against this settled \nprinciple since then, Miles v. Apex Marine Corp., 498 U.S. 19, 32 (1990) (“We assume that \nCongress is aware of existing law when it passes legislation.”). \nDefendants argue that A.V.’s claims do not implicate that usual rule because she is no \nlonger in expedited removal proceedings and, thus, will never receive a “‘determination’ under \nsection 1225(b).”  Dkt. 81 at 10.  That fact, in Defendants’ view, does more than alter the initial \njurisdictional terrain—it means that A.V. will never be subject to a “determination” under the \nexpedited removal provision, and it means that the Court cannot afford her any relief with \nrespect to a “determination” ordering her expedited removal.  Id. (quoting 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(e)(3)).  In other words, according to Defendants, the government’s decision to move A.V. \nfrom expedited to full removal proceedings has “mooted” her right to invoke this Court’s \njurisdiction under § 1252(e)(3).  That contention is flawed in a number of respects.   \nFirst, Defendants’ argument misunderstands the mootness doctrine.  It is a claim, and not \njurisdiction, that can become moot based on changed circumstances, and, here, A.V.’s claim is \npremised on the APA, not on § 1252(e)(3).  To the extent Defendants implicitly disagree, they \nfail to identify any feature of § 1252(e)(3) suggesting that it provides a cause of action, much less \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 42 of 77\nan exclusive cause of action for claims brought challenging implementation of the expedited \nremoval statute. \nSecond, to the extent Defendants contend that § 1252(e)(3) vests this Court with \njurisdiction only after the Department of Homeland Security makes a “determination” respecting \nexpedited removal and that, because A.V. is no longer in expedited removal proceedings, this \npredicate will never be satisfied, they misread the statute.  The language of § 1252(e)(3) is plain: \nit applies to both “judicial review of determinations” made under the expedited removal \nprovision and to judicial review of the “implementation” of that provision.12  Any suggestion that \nreview is nonetheless unavailable unless and until the Department makes a final determination of \nexpedited removal is both unsupported by the text and at odds with the fact that a challenge must \nbe brought within sixty days of the “first implement[ation]” of a challenged regulation, see Am. \nImmigration Lawyers Ass’n v. Reno, 199 F.3d 1352, 1354 (D.C. Cir. 2000).  Under Defendants’ \nreading of § 1252(e)(3), the sixty-day deadline would mean that an alien’s ability to press her \nclaim concerning the implementation of the expedited removal scheme is based wholly on \nhappenstance:  If the government happens to make a final determination as to her expedited \nremoval within the sixty-day window, she can bring a claim challenging the system.  If the \ngovernment does not enter such a determination within sixty days, that same alien is out of luck.  \nThe Court doubts that Congress intended such an arbitrary result.  \n                                                 \n12  Section 1252(e)(3) refers to “[j]udicial review of determinations under [§ 1225(b)] and its \nimplementation.”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3).  One might argue that “its implementation” refers to \nimplementation of the removal order, and not to implementation of § 1225(b).  That, however, is \nnot the best reading of the provision.  Among other things, the reference to “implementation” is \nin the singular, as is the reference to “section 1225(b),” while the reference to “determinations” \nis in the plural.   \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 43 of 77\nThird, Defendants’ argument proves too much.  At oral argument, counsel conceded that, \nunder Defendants’ reading of the statute, this Court would lose jurisdiction under § 1252(e)(3) if \nthe government moves the plaintiff from expedited to full removal proceedings—up to the \nmoment the Court enters final judgment.  Dkt. 79 at 58–59 (May 29, 2019 Hrg. Tr.).  That \nreading of the statute would attribute to Congress an intent to empower the government to avoid \nan unfavorable decision at any time, so long as the government acts before the Court enters final \njudgment.  Considered against the backdrop of the usual rule, which fixes statutory jurisdiction at \nthe time the complaint is filed, that contention is a step too far.  There is no reason to believe that \nCongress intended to cede to the government the unique capacity to shift fora at its whim.   \nNotwithstanding these problems with Defendants’ argument, the Court is unpersuaded \nthat § 1252(e)(3) applies here, for essentially the same reasons that it is unpersuaded that \n§ 1252(a)(5) and § 1252(b)(9) apply.  Most importantly, § 1252(e)(3) is about challenges to \nexpedited removal orders and the implementation of the expedited removal provisions that \nCongress enacted in IIRIRA.  This case, in contrast, presents neither a challenge to a removal \norder nor a challenge to the statutory or regulatory system for expedited removal.  Rather, as \nexplained in greater detail above, Plaintiffs assert a facial challenge to a rule governing eligibility \nfor asylum, whether sought in a defensive or affirmative application.  That is why § 1252—as a \nwhole—does not apply to Plaintiffs’ challenges, and it is why the Court has statutory \njurisdiction.  But, even if Defendants were correct that § 1252 had some bearing on this case, the \nbottom line would be the same.  That is because § 1252(e)(3) sweeps, if anything, more broadly \nthan § 1252(a)(5) and § 1252(b)(9)—it does not apply merely to removal proceedings and \nactions taken to remove an alien, but to the implementation of the expedited removal provisions \nof IIRIRA—and the government’s post-complaint decision to move A.V. from expedited to full \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 44 of 77\nremoval proceedings would not divest the Court of whatever jurisdiction it had at the time the \ncomplaints were filed. \n*     *     * \nThe Court, accordingly, concludes that it has statutory jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1331 to consider the Plaintiffs’ claims, because § 1252 does not divest the Court of jurisdiction \nover the individual plaintiffs’ claims and because Defendants raise no statutory, jurisdictional \ndefense to the organizational plaintiffs’ claims.  \n2.  Article III Standing and Zone of Interests Standing \nDefendants next argue that the organizational plaintiffs lack Article III and prudential (or \n“zone of interests”) standing and that the individual plaintiffs lack Article III standing.13  \n“Because Article III limits federal judicial jurisdiction to cases and controversies, see U.S. Const. \nart. III, § 2, federal courts are without authority” to decide disputes unless the plaintiff has \nstanding—that is, “‘a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy [sufficient] to \nwarrant his invocation of federal-court jurisdiction.’” Chamber of Commerce v. EPA, 642 F.3d \n192, 199 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (quoting Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 493 (2009)).  \nThis fundamental limitation “is founded in concern about the proper—and properly limited—\nrole of the courts in a democratic society.”  Summers, 555 U.S. at 492–93 (quoting Warth v. \nSeldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975)).  To demonstrate Article III standing, a plaintiff must \ndemonstrate a “concrete and particularized” injury that is “fairly traceable” to the defendant’s \nconduct and “that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.”  Spokeo, Inc. v. \nRobins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547–48 (2016) (quoting Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 \n                                                 \n13  Even though “zone of interests” standing is not jurisdictional, see Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static \nControl Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 126, 128 n.4 (2014), the Court addresses it here as a \nthreshold issue. \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 45 of 77\n(1992)).  “At least one plaintiff must have standing to seek each form of relief requested,” Town \nof Chester, N.Y. v. Laroe Estates, Inc., 137 S. Ct. 1645, 1651 (2017), and that party “bears the \nburden of establishing” the elements of standing “with the manner and degree of evidence \nrequired at the successive stages of the litigation,” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.   \na.  Organizational Plaintiffs \nThe Court begins with the organizational plaintiffs.  An organization “can assert standing \non its own behalf, on behalf of its members or both.”  Equal Rights Ctr. v. Post Props., Inc., 633 \nF.3d 1136, 1138 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  Here, the organizational plaintiffs rely on the first approach, \n“which requires [them], like an individual plaintiff, to show ‘actual or threatened injury in fact \nthat is fairly traceable to the alleged illegal action and likely to be redressed by a favorable court \ndecision.’”  Id. (quoting Spann v. Colonial Village, Inc., 899 F.2d 24, 27 (D.C. Cir. 1990)).  For \nsupport, Plaintiffs rely on Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 379 (1982).  In that \ncase, a fair housing organization claimed that the defendant’s discriminatory housing practices \n“frustrated” the organization’s ability to “provide counseling and referral services for low- and \nmoderate-income homeseekers,” forcing it “to devote significant resources to identify and \ncounteract” the alleged discriminatory practices.  Id.  The Supreme Court held that “there [could] \nbe no question that the organization . . . suffered injury in fact” because it established a “concrete \nand demonstrable injury to the organization’s activities—with the consequent drain on the \norganization’s resources—[that] constitute[d] far more than simply a setback to the \norganization’s abstract social interests.”  Id. \nThe D.C. Circuit “has applied Havens Realty to justify organizational standing in a wide \nrange of circumstances.”  Abigail All. for Better Access to Developmental Drugs v. Eschenbach, \n469 F.3d 129, 133 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (collecting cases); see also 13A Charles Alan Wright et \nal., Federal Practice & Procedure § 3531.9.5 (3d ed. Sept. 2018) (same).  That said, Havens is \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 46 of 77\nnot without limits:  A plaintiff must show more than a mere “setback to the organization’s \nabstract social interests,” Havens, 455 U.S. at 379, a “self-inflicted budgetary choice,’” Am. \nSoc’y for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals v. Feld Entm’t, Inc., 659 F.3d 13, 25 (D.C. Cir. 2011) \n(“ASPCA”), or an effect on the “organization[’s] lobbying activities,” Ams. for Safe Access v. \nDEA, 706 F.3d 438, 457 (D.C. Cir. 2013).  An organization seeking to establish Havens standing \nmust clear two hurdles.  First, it “must show a ‘direct conflict between the defendant’s conduct \nand the organization’s mission.’” ASPCA, 659 F.3d at 25 (quoting Nat’l Treasury Emps. Union \nv. United States, 101 F.3d 1423, 1430 (D.C. Cir. 1996)).  If it can do so, the Court must then “ask \nwhether the plaintiff used its resources to counteract that injury.”  Id.  “[A]n organization may \nnot,” however, “‘manufacture the injury necessary to maintain a suit from its expenditure of \nresources on that very suit.’”  Id. (quoting Spann, 899 F.2d at 27). \nPlaintiffs have met this burden.  Both CAIR Coalition and RAICES have identified \nvarious ways that the Rule would frustrate their missions of providing direct legal services to \nasylum seekers.  Dkt. 39 at 46–56 (S.M.S.R. Amend. Compl. ¶¶ 213–255).  The declaration of \nCAIR Coalition’s litigation director, for example, describes the organization’s mission in detail \nand explains how the Rule will interfere with that mission and will, if allowed to take effect, \nimpose substantial, tangible costs on the organization.  See Dkt. 6-5 at 2–11 (Cubas Decl. ¶¶ 3–\n39), S.M.S.R. et al. v. Trump et al. (No. 18-2838).  In particular, according to the declaration, the \nRule will either dramatically reduce the number of clients that CAIR Coalition can serve or will \nrequire it to “raise more funds to serve the same number of clients.”  Id. at 5 (Cubas Decl. ¶ 14).  \nTo take just one example, if CAIR Coalition’s clients are ineligible for asylum, the organization \nwill need to assist them in seeking withholding of removal, which requires that applicants meet a \nsubstantially more demanding test (“reasonable fear” as compared to “credible fear”), and will, \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 47 of 77\nas a result, require “double th[e] time [to] prepar[e]” them for interviews.  Id. at 7 (Cubas Decl. \n¶ 22).  More cases, moreover, will “move directly to trial at immigration court,” which will \nfurther tax CAIR Coalition’s resources.  Id. at 10 (Cubas Decl. ¶¶ 33–34).  And at the same time \nthat the Rule will impose these additional demands on the organization, it will diminish a portion \nof CAIR Coalition’s funding, which “is tied [in part] to the number of adult clients that the \norganization serves each year.”  Id. at 11 (Cubas Decl. ¶ 38).   \nSimilarly, RAICES attests that the Rule will frustrate its mission and will impose \nsubstantial, tangible burdens on the organization.  Dkt. 39 at 52 (S.M.S.R. Amend. Compl. \n¶ 238).  The declaration of RAICES’s chief legal programs officer describes the mission of the \norganization and explains how the Rule will undermine that mission and will impose additional \ncosts on the organization.  See Dkt. 6-6 at 2–11 (Garza Pareja Decl. ¶¶ 3–36), S.M.S.R. et al. v. \nTrump et al. (No. 18-2838).  According to the declaration, the Rule will require RAICES “to \ndivert scarce resources—including staff time—to: (1) creating new intake procedures for \ndetained families; (2) preparing [affected] asylum seekers for more onerous reasonable fear \ninterviews; (3) preparing children of [affected] asylum seekers for reasonable fear \ninterviews . . . ; (4) appealing more negative determinations to immigration court and beyond; (5) \npreparing unaccompanied minors to testify and be cross-examined in immigration court, rather \nthan at the non-adversarial Asylum Office; (6) assisting families to prepare multiple applications \nfor relief, instead of one application with derivative family members; (7) creating new resources \nand policies to implement these changes; (8) training staff on these new policies; and (9) \nretraining staff from certain programs to move into new roles to implement these policies.”  Id. at \n9–10 (Garza Pareja Decl. ¶ 32).  The organization, as a result, will “be unable to represent the \nsame number of clients that it does currently,” will need to “spend more resources on each \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 48 of 77\nindividual case,” and will be “force[d] . . . to divert scarce resources away from other important \nprograms.”  Id. at 3 (Garza Pareja Decl. ¶ 6). \nThese uncontested declarations demonstrate that the Rule directly conflicts with the \nmissions of the organizational plaintiffs and that it will require them to use substantial “resources \nto counteract that injury.”  ASPCA, 659 F.3d at 25.  No more is required to establish standing \nunder Havens.  Defendants disagree, arguing that “nothing in the [R]ule prevents CAIR \n[Coalition] or RAICES from continuing to represent asylum-seeking clients.”  Dkt. 31 at 32.  \nThat is correct, but immaterial.  Courts have never required an organization to prove that is it \nentirely hamstrung by challenged actions; a direct conflict is one in which a defendant’s actions \ncause a “perceptibl[e] impair[ment]” of the organization’s mission that makes its “overall task \nmore difficult.”  Nat’l Treasury Emps. Union, 101 F.3d at 1429 (quoting Fair Emp’t Council of \nGreater Washington, Inc. v. BMC Mktg. Corp., 28 F.3d 1268, 1276 (D.C. Cir. 1994)).  CAIR \nCoalition and RAICES have made such a showing here. \nDefendants also argue that the organizational plaintiffs fail the zone of interests test.  Dkt. \n31 at 33–34.  The Court, once again, disagrees.  Zone of interests standing is not a jurisdictional \ndoctrine but, rather, requires that the “plaintiff’s complaint falls within the zone of interests \nprotected by the law invoked.”  Lexmark Int’l, 572 U.S. at 126.  The zone of interests test is, in \nother words, a “tool for determining who may invoke the cause of action” created in the statute at \nissue.  Id. at 130.  “[I]n keeping with Congress’s ‘evident intent’ when enacting the APA ‘to \nmake agency action presumptively reviewable,’” the test, at least in the APA context, “‘is not \nmeant to be especially demanding.’”  Match–E–Be–Nash–She–Wish Band of Pottawatomi \nIndians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 225 (2012) (quoting Clarke v. Secs. Indus. Ass’n, 479 U.S. \n388, 399–400 (1987)).  “The interest [the plaintiff] asserts must be ‘arguably within the zone of \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 49 of 77\ninterests to be protected or regulated by the [underlying] statute’ that [the plaintiff] says was \nviolated.”  Id. at 224 (quoting Ass’n of Data Processing Serv. Orgs., Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, \n153 (1970)).  Courts “do not require any ‘indication of congressional purpose to benefit the \nwould-be plaintiff,’” and the Supreme Court has “always conspicuously included the word \n‘arguably’ in the test to indicate that the benefit of any doubt goes to the plaintiff.”  Id. (quoting \nClarke, 479 U.S. at 399–400).  “The test forecloses suit only when a plaintiff’s ‘interests are so \nmarginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it cannot \nreasonably be assumed that Congress intended to permit the suit.’”  Id. (quoting Clarke, 479 U.S. \nat 399). \nThe organizational plaintiffs easily meet this permissive test.  To start, the organizational \nplaintiffs’ interest in providing legal assistance to as many asylum seekers as they can is \nconsistent with the INA’s purpose to “establish[ ] . . . [the] statutory procedure for granting \nasylum to refugees.”  Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 427.  Even more to the point, the \norganizational plaintiffs’ interest in representing asylum seekers furthers the purposes of the \nINA.  As the Ninth Circuit observed in East Bay II, the INA includes provisions designed “to \nensure that pro bono legal services of the type that the [organizational plaintiffs] provide are \navailable to asylum seekers.”  East Bay II, 909 F.3d at 1245.  Most notably, Congress required \nthat, “[a]t the time of filing an application for asylum, the Attorney General shall . . . advise the \nalien of the privilege of being represented by counsel and of the consequences . . . of knowingly \nfiling a frivolous application for asylum” and shall “provide the alien a list of persons (updated \nnot less often than quarterly) who have indicated their availability to represent aliens in asylum \nproceedings on a pro bono basis.”  8 U.S.C. § 1158(d)(4).  In expedited removal proceedings \ninvolving aliens convicted of certain crimes, moreover, Congress directed that the Attorney \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 50 of 77\nGeneral take steps “to ensure that the alien’s access to counsel and right to counsel . . . are not \nimpaired” due to the alien’s place of detention, 8 U.S.C. § 1228(a)(2), and to provide that “the \nalien shall have the privilege of being represented (at no expense to the government) by counsel”  \nin removal proceedings, 8 U.S.C. § 1228(b)(4)(B).  In addition, the INA guarantees that aliens in \n“removal proceedings before an immigration judge and in any appeal proceedings before the \nAttorney General from any such removal proceedings . . . shall have the privilege of being \nrepresented (at no expense to the [g]overnment) by . . . counsel[] authorized to practice in such \nproceedings.”  8 U.S.C. § 1362; see also id. § 1101(i)(1) (requiring that potential T visa \napplicants be referred to nongovernmental organizations for legal advice); id. § 1184(p)(3)(A) \n(same for U visas).  \nThe Court, accordingly, concludes that the interests that the organizational plaintiffs seek \nto protect are at least “arguably” within the zone of interests protected by the INA and that, as a \nresult, the organizational plaintiffs’ claims satisfy the zone of interests test.14 \nb.  Individual Plaintiffs \n  There is no doubt that asylum is a valuable form of relief from removal and that it affords \nthe asylee benefits above and beyond avoiding removal, including, most notably, a path to lawful \n                                                 \n14  Neither INS v. Legalization Assistance Project of the L.A. Cty. Fed’n of Labor (“LAP”), 510 \nU.S. 1301, 1305 (1993) (O’Connor, J., in chambers) nor Fed’n for Am. Immigration Reform, Inc. \nv. Reno (“FAIR”), 93 F.3d 897, 900–04 (D.C. Cir. 1996), Dkt. 31 at 34, supports a contrary \nconclusion.  Justice O’Connor’s in chambers opinion in LAP reflects the views of a single Justice \nrelating to a different statute, IRCA.  FAIR, too, is inapposite.  The organization at issue in that \ncase was “dedicated to ensuring that levels of legal immigration are consistent with the \nabsorptive capacity of the local areas where immigrants are likely to settle,” and it brought suit \nchallenging the INA’s scheme for “parole and adjustment of status of Cuban nationals” into the \nUnited States.  FAIR, 93 F.3d at 899 (internal quotation omitted).  The D.C. Circuit held that the \norganization’s mission bore no more than a “marginal[] rela[tionship]” to the statutory purposes \nof the INA, because it pointed to no language of congressional intent that “even hint[ed] at a \nconcern about regional impact” of immigration.  Id. at 900–01.   \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 51 of 77\npermanent resident status and citizenship.  Nor is there any doubt that the Rule, by definition, \napplies to each of the individual plaintiffs and that it, by definition, would render each of the \nplaintiffs categorically ineligible for asylum.  See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561–62 (holding that “there \nis ordinarily little question” that a plaintiff has standing if she herself is “an object of the \naction . . . at issue”).  And while it is not the Court’s role to adjudicate the individual plaintiffs’ \nclaims to asylum—and the Court will not do so—each has submitted a declaration setting forth \nfacts sufficient to state a plausible claim to asylum.  See, e.g., Dkt. 51-2 (O.A. Decl.); Dkt. 51-4 \n(A.V. Decl.); Dkt. 51-6 (G.Z. Decl.); Dkt. 51-8 (D.S. Decl.); Dkt. 51-10 (D.R. Decl.); Dkt. 51-11 \n(P.R. Decl.); Dkt. 51-12 (G.R. Decl.); Dkt. 6-3 (S.M.S.R. Decl.), S.M.S.R. et al. v. Trump et al. \n(No. 18-2838); Dkt. 6-4 (R.S.P.S. Decl.), S.M.S.R. et al. v. Trump et al. (No. 18-2838); Dkt. 52-3 \n(L.C.V.R. Decl.); Dkt. 52-4 (R.G.G. Decl.); Dkt. 52-5 (A.J.A.C. Decl.); Dkt. 52-6 (K.P.P.V. \nDecl.); Dkt. 52-7 (Y.A.L.P. Decl.).  That is enough to establish an injury in fact that is fairly \ntraceable to the challenged Rule and that would be redressed by the invalidation of the Rule.  See \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 560–61.   \nDefendants disagree, arguing that because of the East Bay preliminary injunction, “the \nchallenged rule has not been applied to” any of the individual plaintiffs and that, at least as long \nas the preliminary injunction remains in place, the individual plaintiffs “cannot show any \npossibility of imminent injury.”  Dkt. 66 at 25.  Although the government’s appeal of the \npreliminary injunction is pending, Defendants contend that the “hypothetical future vacation of \nthe [East Bay] injunction is inadequate” to establish the possibility of imminent injury.  Dkt. 76 \nat 16.  That is incorrect.  As the Supreme Court has held, preliminary injunctive relief does not \ndefeat Article III standing; the relief is by definition temporary, leaving the threat of future injury \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 52 of 77\nin place.  See Preap, 139 S. Ct. at 963 (plurality opinion) (“Unless that preliminary injunction \nwas made permanent and was not disturbed on appeal, [plaintiffs] faced the threat of [injury].”).  \n That threat of future injury, moreover, is apparent here:  the President himself has \nconfirmed by proclamation that “[t]he United States is appealing th[e] [preliminary] injunction,” \nand, “[s]hould the injunction be lifted, aliens who enter the United States unlawfully through the \nsouthern border in contravention of this proclamation will be ineligible to be granted asylum \nunder th[e] interim final rule.”  84 Fed. Reg. at 3,665; 84 Fed. Reg. at 21,230.  At oral argument, \nmoreover, the Court asked counsel for Defendants whether the government would revisit the \npositive credible fear determinations made for some, but not all, of the individual plaintiffs if the \nRule is allowed to take effect, and counsel declined to provide the Court or Plaintiffs with any \nassurances.  Dkt. 79 at 59–60 (May 29, 2019 Hrg. Tr.) (“I don’t have a firm answer on that, I’m \ngoing to leave the government’s options open.”).  Indeed, counsel went a step further and left the \ngovernment’s options open to revoke the grant of asylum obtained by one of the individual \nplaintiffs.  Id. at 60 (May 29, 2019 Hrg. Tr.) (“Again, same response, your Honor, I have to wait \nand see.”).  More importantly, the Rule itself declares in categorical terms that “an alien shall be \nineligible for asylum if the alien is subject to” the Proclamation.  83 Fed. Reg. at 55,952; 8 \nC.F.R. § 208.13.  As a result, if the Rule is allowed to take effect, each of the individual plaintiffs \nwill be “ineligible” for asylum, regardless of whether they have been subject to a credible fear \ninterview, have obtained an initial credible fear determination, or (perhaps) have even been \ngranted asylum.  See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1158(c)(2)(A) (“Asylum granted under subsection (b) does \nnot convey a right to remain permanently in the United States and may be terminated if the \nAttorney General determines that . . . the alien no longer meets the conditions described in \nsubsection (b)(1) owing to a fundamental change in circumstances.”). \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 53 of 77\nDefendants also press this same point in a different way, arguing that the East Bay \ninjunction “has, in effect, provided Plaintiffs with the full relief they seek from this Court.”  Dkt. \n66 at 40.  But, regardless of whether this issue is best considered as one of standing or mootness, \nthe Court is unconvinced.  Although the East Bay court had entered a temporary restraining order \nat the time the O.A. and S.M.S.R suits were commenced, that court did not enter the existing \npreliminary injunction until December 19, 2018, see East Bay III, 354 F. Supp. 3d at 1102—after \nthe original and amended complaints were filed in this case.  See Dkt. 1 (O.A. Compl.); \nComplaint, S.M.S.R., No. 18-2838 (D.D.C. Dec. 3, 2018), Dkt. 3; Dkt. 39 (S.M.S.R. Amend. \nCompl.); Dkt. 40 (O.A. Amend. Compl.).  To carry their “heavy” burden of establishing that \nPlaintiffs’ claims have been mooted by the East Bay preliminary injunction, United States v. W. \nT. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 633 (1953), Defendants must show that “there is no reasonable \nexpectation . . . that the alleged violation will recur” and that “interim relief or events have \ncompletely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation.”  ABA v. FTC, 636 \nF.3d 641, 648 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (internal quotation omitted).  Far from doing so, Defendants have \nappealed the East Bay preliminary injunction and have preserved the “option” to apply the Rule \nto all of the individual plaintiffs. \n  Merits \nThat all amounts to a very long backstroke for a relatively short putt.  Plaintiffs challenge \nthe Rule on a variety grounds, several of which have considerable force.  The Court need only \nconsider the first of Plaintiffs’ challenges, however, because it is sufficient to resolve the case.  \nThat challenge boils down to one question:  Is the Rule, which renders all aliens who enter the \nUnited States across the southern border after November 9, 2018, except at a designated port of \nentry, ineligible for asylum, consistent with 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1), which provides that “[a]ny \nalien who is physically present in the United States or who arrives in the United States (whether \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 54 of 77\nor not at a designated port of arrival . . . ), irrespective of such alien’s status, may apply for \nasylum”?  According to Plaintiffs, the inconsistency between the Rule and statute is self-evident.  \nAccording to Defendants, the Rule is consistent with the statute because a bar on “eligibility” for \nasylum (as specified in the Rule) is different than a bar on “applying” asylum (as precluded by \nthe statute).  For the reasons explained below, the Court agrees with Plaintiffs and concludes that \nDefendants’ reading of the statute is untenable.    \nNeither party explicitly invokes the familiar Chevron framework and, for present \npurposes, the Court need not decide whether Chevron applies to an interim final rule which lacks \nthe benefit of public comment, see United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 230–31 (2001) \n(while notice and comment is “significant . . . in pointing to Chevron authority, the want of that \nprocedure . . . does not decide the case,” as courts “have sometimes found reasons for Chevron \ndeference even when no such administrative formality was required and none was afforded”), or \nwhether Chevron deference was forfeited here, see Neustar, Inc. v. Fed. Commc’ns Comm’n, 857 \nF.3d 886, 893–94 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (“The [government’s] brief nominally references Chevron’s \ndeferential standard in its standard of review but did not invoke this standard with respect to \nrulemaking.  Consequently, it has forfeited any claims to Chevron deference.”).  Rather, “[t]he \njudiciary is the final authority on issues of statutory construction and must reject administrative \nconstructions,” like that at issue here, “which are contrary to clear congressional intent.”  \nChevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843 n.9 (1984).   \nThe Court, moreover, need not pause over the fact that presidential actions are not \nthemselves subject to APA review, see Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 801 (1992), \nbecause it is the Rule, and not the Proclamation, that has operative effect, see Chamber of \nCommerce v. Reich, 74 F.3d 1322, 1326 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (finding regulations that implement an \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 55 of 77\nexecutive order are reviewable under the APA).  The fact that the Rule defines those who are \nineligible for asylum by reference “to a presidential proclamation or other presidential order” \nmay raise separate problems with the Rule, see Dkt. 39 at 57–58 (S.M.S.R. Amend. Compl. \n¶ 263); Dkt. 40 at 34–35 (O.A. Amend. Compl. ¶¶ 124–127), but it does not insulate the Rule \nfrom APA review or even purport to transfer the statutory authority to establish—“by \nregulation”—additional limitations on asylum from the Attorney General and the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to the President.  \nThe Court starts, once again, with the statutory text, see Ross v. Blake, 136 S. Ct. 1850, \n1856 (2016), and “must enforce plain and unambiguous statutory language according to its \nterms,” Hardt v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., 560 U.S. 242, 251 (2010).  As the Supreme \nCourt “ha[s] stated time and again[,] . . . courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute \nwhat it means and means in a statute what it says there.  When the words of a statute are \nunambiguous, then, this first canon is also the last: ‘judicial inquiry is complete.’”  Conn. Nat’l \nBank v. Germain, 503 U.S. 249, 253–54 (1992) (quoting Rubin v. United States, 449 U.S. 424, \n430 (1981)) (citations omitted).  The words of the statute, moreover, must be “placed in context,” \nFDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 132 (2000), and must be read “with \na view to their place in the overall statutory scheme,” id. at 133 (quoting Davis v. Mich. Dep’t of \nTreasury, 489 U.S. 803, 809 (1989)). \nThe language at issue here was enacted as part of IIRIRA in 1996.  Prior to that time, the \nrelevant provision of the INA merely required the Attorney General to establish “a procedure for \nan alien physically present in the United States or at a land border or port of entry, irrespective of \nsuch alien’s status, to apply for asylum.”  8 U.S.C. § 1158(a) (1980).  In its current form, \n§ 1158(a)(1) now provides: \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 56 of 77\nAny alien who is physically present in the United States or who arrives in the \nUnited States (whether or not at a designated port of arrival and including an \nalien who is brought to the United States after having been interdicted in \ninternational or United States waters), irrespective of such alien’s status may \napply for asylum in accordance with this section or, where applicable, section \n1225(b) of this title. \n \n8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1) (emphasis added).  The other paragraph relevant to the present dispute was \nalso introduced in IIRIRA, and it provides: \nThe Attorney General [and now the Secretary of Homeland Security] may by \nregulation establish additional limitations and conditions, consistent with this \nsection, under which an alien shall be ineligible for asylum under paragraph (1). \n \n8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(2)(C) (emphasis added).  All agree that a regulation barring all aliens who \nenter the United States from Mexico outside a designated port of entry from applying for asylum \nwould be “inconsistent with” § 1158(a)(1) and, thus, ultra vires.  But, according to the \ngovernment, that is not what the Rule does.  Instead, it treats those aliens as ineligible for \nasylum.  And, in its view, “the instruction that aliens ‘may apply’ for asylum regardless of \nwhether they entered at a port of entry does not require that an alien must be eligible for or be \nable to ‘receive’ asylum.”  Dkt. 66 at 42 (emphasis added). \nAs a matter of plain language, the government’s distinction is, to say the least, a fine one.  \nThe word “ineligible” means “legally or officially unable to be considered for a benefit.”  \nIneligible, Oxford English Dictionary, https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/ineligible (last \nvisited Aug. 2, 2019).  Defendants never explain, nor could they, how that differs from “legally \nor officially unable to apply for a benefit.”  Whether framed as a restriction on who may apply or \non who is eligible, the government must consider whether the restriction at issue is applicable; \nprovide the alien with some opportunity to be heard; and render a decision, which is then subject \nto review by an immigration judge.  8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(III); 8 C.F.R. §§ 208.13, 208.14.  \nAs a matter of common usage, no one would draw a meaningful distinction, for example, \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 57 of 77\nbetween a rule providing that children may not apply for a driver’s license and one providing that \nchildren are not eligible to receive a driver’s license.  Both locutions mean the same thing.   \nMoreover, even if one might hypothesize some circumstance in which the phrases “may \nnot apply” and “are ineligible” do not mean the same thing, this is not such a case.  Under the \ngovernment’s theory, § 1158 is divided into two discrete realms.  Section 1158(a), which \nincludes the right to apply for asylum “whether or not” the applicant arrived in the United States \n“at a designated port of arrival,” defines who may—and who may not—“apply” for asylum, \nwhile § 1158(b), which includes the Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security’s \nauthority to promulgate regulations “consistent with” § 1158, defines who is—and who is not—\n“eligible” for asylum.  But that purported distinction is at odds with the Rule itself, as well as the \nDepartment of Homeland Security’s implementing regulations.  As the Rule explains, in the \ncontext of expedited removal proceedings, an asylum officer must “ask threshold questions to \nelicit whether an alien is ineligible for a grant of asylum pursuant to [the] proclamation bar,” and \nif “an alien lacks a significant possibility of eligibility” under the bar, the asylum officer must \nmake a negative credible fear determination.  83 Fed. Reg. at 55,944 (emphasis added).  The \nasylum officer is charged with going on to determine whether the alien is “subject to one or more \nof the mandatory bars to applying for, or being granted, asylum contained” in § 1158(a) (who \nmay apply) or § 1158(b) (who is eligible) only “if [the] alien” clears the credible fear hurdle.  8 \nC.F.R. § 208.30(e)(5)(i)–(ii).  In other words, under Defendants’ theory, asylum officers must \ndecide whether an alien is “eligible” for asylum before deciding whether he may “apply.”  That \nresult is unproblematic if the terms are even roughly synonymous; it makes no sense if the right \nto apply is viewed as a step precedent to consideration of the alien’s eligibility. \n57 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 58 of 77\nOther regulatory provisions confirm that the government itself treats the “bars to applying \nfor, or being granted, asylum” as interchangeable.  8 C.F.R. § 208.30(e)(5)(i) (emphasis added).  \nThus, in addition to § 208.30(e)(5), § 208.13(c), which the Rule also amends, provides that “an \napplicant shall not qualify for asylum if” § 1158(a)(2) (who may apply) or § 1158(b)(2) (who is \neligible) “applies to the applicant.”  8 C.F.R. § 208.13(c)(1).  Notably, in the government’s own \nwords, if the applicant fails to “qualify” under either paragraph of § 1158, he shall be “found to \nbe ineligible for asylum.”  Id. (emphasis added) (“If the applicant is found to be ineligible for \nasylum under either” § 1158(a)(2) or § 1158(b)(2)).  Against this regulatory backdrop, the \ndistinction Defendants would have the Court draw between limitations on who may apply and \nwho is eligible for asylum not only “strains credulity,” East Bay I, 349 F.3d at 857, but snaps it. \nBut the Court need not go that far to conclude that the Rule is contrary to law.  Even \nassuming that the phrases “may not apply” and “are ineligible” reflect some subtle distinction in \nmeaning, the relevant question is not whether the Rule uses the exact same words as in the \nstatutory prohibition.  The question, instead, is whether the Rule is “consistent with,” 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1158(b)(2)(C), the statutory mandate that any alien present in the United States “may apply for \nasylum,” regardless of “whether or not” the alien entered the United States “at a designated port \nof arrival,” 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1).  Defendants do not even attempt to satisfy that test, nor could \nthey.  As the Ninth Circuit put it, “[t]he technical differences between applying for and eligibility \nfor asylum are of no consequence to a refugee when the bottom line—no possibility of asylum—\nis the same.”  East Bay II, 909 F.3d at  1247–48.  Or to continue the analogy started above, a \nregulation making all sixteen-year-olds “ineligible” to obtain a driver’s license is not, by any \nlogic, consistent with a statute providing that any sixteen-year-old may “apply” for a driver’s \nlicense.  The statute might not mean that all sixteen-year-olds should receive a license.  It might \n58 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 59 of 77\nnot mean that the motor vehicle administration is precluded from considering the age or maturity \nof an applicant, along with other factors.  But a categorical bar on “eligibility” for all sixteen-\nyear-olds is not “consistent with” a statutory right to “apply” for a driver’s license at sixteen.  \nTurning, again, to the dictionary, “consistent” means “compatible or in agreement with.”  \nConsistent, Oxford English Dictionary, https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/consistent (last \nvisited Aug. 2, 2019).  The Rule’s direction that “an alien shall be ineligible for asylum” if the \nalien entered the United States outside a designated port of entry is not “compatible” with the \ncongressional mandate that all aliens present in the United States may “apply” for asylum, \nregardless of whether they entered the United States at a designated port of entry.15 \nNone of Defendants’ counterarguments are persuasive.  Defendants first invoke the final \nclause of § 1158(a)(1), which qualifies an alien’s right to apply for asylum with the condition \nthat the alien must do so “in accordance with this section or, where applicable, section 1225(b) \nof” the INA.  Dkt. 76 at 18.  In Defendants’ view, this qualification “makes clear that an \nindividual’s ability to apply for asylum is always subject to the discretion afforded to the \nAttorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security to determine asylum eligibility.”  Id.  \n                                                 \n15  Because the statutory text is plain, the Court need not consider whether Defendants’ \ninterpretation is at odds with the established purpose of § 1158 and the Charming Betsy canon of \nstatutory interpretation, see Schooner Charming Betsy, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) at 118.  Nor is the \nCourt persuaded by Defendants’ effort to reconcile their position with the relevant treaty \nbackground.  In particular, Defendants contend that Article 31 of the 1951 Convention applies \nonly to penalties imposed on account of illegal entry by a refugee “coming directly from a \nterritory where their life or freedom was threatened.”  Dkt. 22 at 37 (quoting Article 31(1), 19 \nU.S.T. at 6275).  In Defendants’ view, that prohibition does not apply here because the \nindividual plaintiffs in this action—who seek asylum from Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, \nand Guatemala—came to the United States through Mexico.  Id.  But, even if Defendants were \ncorrect that Article 31 is so limited—and that proposition is subject to dispute—the path to the \nUnited States followed by the individual plaintiffs in this case says nothing about what that \nstatute means.  Rather, the phrase “may apply” must have the same meaning regardless of \nwhether the alien is seeking asylum from Mexico or from Honduras. \n59 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 60 of 77\nBut that construction of the statute turns the relevant allocation of authority on its head.  \nCongress has defined who may apply for asylum, specifying that “[a]ny alien who is physically \npresent in the United States” may do so, regardless of “whether or not” the alien arrived “at a \ndesignated port of arrival.”  8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1).  Congress also granted the Attorney General \nand the Secretary of Homeland Security authority to promulgate regulations establishing \n“additional limitations and conditions” on eligibility for asylum, but only to the extent \n“consistent with” § 1158.  Id. § 1158(b)(2)(C) (emphasis added).  As a result, if any incongruity \nexists between the terms of the statute and a regulation, the statutory text prevails—not vice \nversa.    \nNext, Defendants dispute that the Rule is “predicated upon the manner of an alien’s entry \npe se” and argue, instead, that it turns on “whether an alien has contravened a Presidential \nproclamation concerning a particular crisis at the southern border at a particular time.”  Dkt. 31 \nat 38.  This matters, according to Defendants, because “[a]liens who contravene such a measure \nhave not merely violated the immigration laws, but have also undercut the efficacy of a measure \nadopted by the President based on his determination of the national interest in matters that could \nhave significant implications for the foreign affairs of the United States.”  83 Fed. Reg. at \n55,940.  The Court does not doubt that the Proclamation reflects a determination by the President \nthat the influx of aliens entering the United States across the southern border outside the \ndesignated ports of entry poses a “particular problem for the national interest.”  Dkt. 41 at 93 \n(Dec. 17, 2018 Hrg. Tr.).  But that assessment is neither sufficient to override a statutory \nmandate permitting all aliens present in the United States to apply for asylum, regardless of \nwhether they arrived in the United States “at a designated port of arrival,” 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1); \nsee Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952), nor does it suffice to shift the \n60 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 61 of 77\ncongressional assignment of authority to adopt additional limitations on asylum “by regulation” \nfrom the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security to the President.  The \nauthority that the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security have invoked in \nsupport of the Rule is their authority to promulgate regulations “consistent with” § 1158, 8 \nU.S.C. § 1158(b)(2)(C), and they cannot sidestep the statutory restriction on their authority by \ninvoking a presidential proclamation that is not premised on any authority to alter or supplant the \nrules that Congress specified in § 1158.   \nFinally, Defendants argue that the government has, “for decades, considered whether an \nalien unlawfully entered the country in issuing discretionary asylum denials.”  Dkt. 31 at 36.  \nThe principal BIA decision upon which they rely, however, Matter of Pula, 19 I. & N. Dec. 467 \n(BIA 1987), was decided almost a decade before Congress amended § 1158(a)(1) in IIRIRA to \ninclude the critical language (“whether or not at a designated port of arrival”) upon which \nPlaintiffs rely.  Nor does that decision sweep as broadly as Defendants suggest.  True, Pula \nrecites that “an alien’s manner of entry or attempted entry is a proper and relevant discretionary \nfactor to consider in adjudicating asylum applications.”  Id. at 473.  In Pula, however, the \n“manner of entry” was through the use of “a fraudulent document,” raising concerns unlike those \nat issue here.  Id. at 474.  But even putting that distinction aside, there is a vast difference \nbetween considering how the alien entered the United States as one, among many, factors in the \nexercise of a discretionary authority, and a categorial rule that disqualifies any alien who enters \nacross the southern border outside a designated port of entry.  Returning, once again, to our \nteenaged drivers, one might plausibly argue that it is permissible to consider a sixteen-year-old’s \nage, among other factors, in deciding whether she should receive a driver’s license.  But it is \n61 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 62 of 77\nsomething altogether different to maintain that no sixteen-year-old may receive a driver’s \nlicense, notwithstanding a statutory entitlement to apply for a license at age sixteen. \nBecause the Interim Final Rule exceeds the authority that Congress conferred on the \nAttorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security to “establish additional limitations and \nconditions” on asylum that are “consistent with” § 1158, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(2)(C), the Rule is \n“not in accordance with law” and “in excess of statutory . . . authority,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), \n(C).  Having concluded that the Rule is, therefore, “unlawful” within the meaning of the APA, \nid. § 706(2), the Court need not reach Plaintiffs’ remaining substantive and procedural \nchallenges to the lawfulness of the Rule. \n   Remedy \nThis brings the Court to the question of remedy.  The S.M.S.R. Plaintiffs urge the Court to \nissue “a declaration that the Rule is unlawful and an injunction prohibiting its enforcement \nagainst each member of the proposed class.”  Dkt. 72 at 34.  The O.A. Plaintiffs, likewise, argue \nthat Plaintiffs are entitled to “[n]ationwide [r]elief,” contending that “there is nothing unusual \nabout a court issuing an injunction that provides Plaintiffs complete relief and also prevents the \n[g]overnment from harming other similarly situated individuals.”  Dkt. 73 at 29–31.  Defendants \ndisagree, arguing that “Article III and equitable principles require that relief be no broader than \nnecessary to redress the Plaintiffs’ injuries” and that “a plaintiff’s remedy must be tailored to \nredress the plaintiff’s particular injury.”  Dkt. 66 at 65 (quotation omitted).  Relying on Justice \nThomas’s concurrence in Trump v. Hawaii, Defendants contend that “[n]ationwide \ninjunctions . . . ‘take a toll on the federal court system—preventing legal questions from \npercolating through the federal courts, encouraging forum shopping, and making every case a \nnational emergency for the courts and for the Executive Branch.’”  Dkt. 66 at 66 (quoting 138 S. \nCt. 2392, 2425 (2018) (Thomas, J., concurring)).  Thus, according to Defendants, “this Court has \n62 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 63 of 77\nthe authority to grant only declaratory relief[] and must limit the relief to remedying only the \nparticular harms alleged by the specific plaintiffs properly before it—that is, a challenge to \nimplementation of Section 1225(b)(1) by the sole Plaintiff subject to an expedited removal order, \nA.V.”  Id. at 67. \nNeither Plaintiffs’ nor Defendants’ view of the appropriate remedy is persuasive.   \nIn several recent cases, the propriety of nationwide injunctive relief has been front and \ncenter.  See, e.g., Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2423; City of Chicago v. Sessions, 888 F.3d \n272, 293 (7th Cir. 2018); NAACP v. Trump, 315 F. Supp. 3d 457, 474 n.13 (D.D.C. 2018); see \nalso Samuel L. Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. \nRev. 417 (2017); Zayn Siddique, Nationwide Injunctions, 117 Colum. L. Rev. 2095 (2017).  \nThis, however, is not such a case, because the APA and controlling D.C. Circuit precedent \ndictate the proper remedy.  For the reasons explained above, the Court has concluded that the \nInterim Final Rule is both “contrary to law” and was adopted “in excess of statutory . . . \nauthority,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C).  Under these circumstances, the APA mandates that the \nCourt “shall” “set aside” the challenged “agency action.”  Id. § 706.  That is, under the plain \nlanguage of the APA, the Court must “annul or vacate” the agency’s action.  See Set Aside, \nBlack’s Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014).   \nThat reading of the APA is consistent with longstanding and consistent practice in this \ncircuit.  See, e.g., Humane Soc’y of United States v. Zinke, 865 F.3d 585, 614 (D.C. Cir. 2017) \n(“A common remedy when we find a rule is invalid is to vacate.”); Blue Water Navy Viet. \nVeterans Ass’n, Inc. v. McDonald, 830 F.3d 570, 578 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (“vacatur is the ‘normal \nremedy’”) (quoting Allina Health Servs. v. Sebelius, 746 F.3d 1102, 1110 (D.C. Cir. 2014)); \nSugar Cane Growers Coop. of Fla. v. Veneman, 289 F.3d 89, 97 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (“Normally \n63 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 64 of 77\nwhen an agency . . . clearly violates the APA we would vacate its action.”).  To be sure, \ndecisions in this circuit have, on occasion, remanded a rule without vacatur, see Allied–Signal, \nInc. v. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Comm’n, 988 F.2d 146, 150–51 (D.C. Cir. 1993), but \nDefendants cite no authority suggesting that any remedy short of vacatur is appropriate here, nor \nhave they even requested remand without vacatur.  Cf. Milk Train, Inc. v. Veneman, 310 F.3d \n747, 757 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (Sentelle, J., dissenting) (positing that vacatur is always required); \nCheckosky v. SEC, 23 F.3d 452, 491 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (Randolph, J., concurring) (same). \nTo the extent Defendants argue that the vacatur remedy should be limited to the plaintiffs \nin this case, that contention is both at odds with settled precedent and difficult to comprehend.   \nThe D.C. Circuit has “made clear that ‘[w]hen a reviewing court determines that agency \nregulations are unlawful, the ordinary result is that the rules are vacated—not that their \napplication to the individual petitioners is proscribed.’” Nat’l Mining Ass’n, 145 F.3d at 1409 \n(quoting Thornburgh, 878 F.2d at 495 n.21) (emphasis added).  As the D.C. Circuit explained in \nthat decision, “Justice Blackmun made a similar observation in Lujan v. National Wildlife \nFederation, 497 U.S. 871 (1990), writing in dissent but apparently expressing the view of all \nnine Justices on th[e] question.”  Nat’l Mining Ass’n, 145 F.3d at 1409.  Justice Blackmun wrote: \nThe Administrative Procedure Act permits suit to be brought by any person \n“adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action.”  In some cases the “agency \naction” will consist of a rule of broad applicability; and if the plaintiff prevails, \nthe result is that the rule is invalidated, not simply that the court forbids its \napplication to a particular individual.   Under these circumstances a single \nplaintiff, so long as he is injured by the rule, may obtain “programmatic” relief \nthat affects the rights of parties not before the court.  On the other hand, if a \ngenerally lawful policy is applied in an illegal manner on a particular occasion, \none who is injured is not thereby entitled to challenge other applications of the \nrule. \n \nLujan, 497 U.S. at 913 (Blackmun, J., dissenting).  As understood by the D.C. Circuit in \nNational Mining Association, this view was shared by the three Justices who joined Justice \n64 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 65 of 77\nBlackmun’s dissent, and by the majority, which observed that a final agency action may “be \nchallenged under the APA by a person adversely affected—and the entire [agency program], \ninsofar as the content of that particular action is concerned, would thereby be affected.”  Id. at \n890 n.2; see also Nat’l Mining Ass’n, 145 F.3d at 1409 (citing same). \nEven without this controlling precedent, moreover, the Court would be at a loss to \nunderstand what it would mean to vacate a regulation, but only as applied to the parties before \nthe Court.  As a practical matter, for example, how could this Court vacate the Rule with respect \nto the organizational plaintiffs in this case without vacating the Rule writ large?  What would it \nmean to “vacate” a rule as to some but not other members of the public?  What would appear in \nthe Code of Federal Regulations?  Fortunately, the Court need not engage in such logical \ngymnastics because the language of the APA and the controlling D.C. Circuit precedent are \nunambiguous.  The Court, accordingly, concludes that the proper remedy is to set the Rule aside, \nand the legal consequences of that result are not limited “to the individual” plaintiffs.  Nat’t \nMining Ass’n, 145 F.3d at 1409.  \nThat leaves the question whether issuance of an injunction is also warranted.  The \nSupreme Court has cautioned that a district court vacating an agency action under the APA \nshould not issue an injunction unless doing so would “have [a] meaningful practical effect \nindependent of its vacatur.”  Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms, 561 U.S. 139, 165 (2010).  \nThis is because “[a]n injunction is a drastic and extraordinary remedy, which should not be \ngranted as a matter of course” or where “a less drastic remedy . . . [is] sufficient to redress” the \nplaintiffs’ injury.  Id.  At least on the present record, this is such a case.  Defendants have \nrepresented that they will abide by the Court’s order, Dkt. 79 at 78 (May 29, 2019 Hrg. Tr.), and \nDepartment of Justice guidance regarding vacatur under the APA provides that the “Department \n65 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 66 of 77\nlitigators should” comply “with circuit precedent,” including the D.C. Circuit’s decision in \nNational Mining Association, 145 F.3d 1399 (D.C. Cir. 1998), see Memorandum from the \nAttorney General to Heads of Civil Litigating Components (Sept. 13, 2018), \nhttps://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1093881/download (last visited Aug. 2, 2019).  \nThose assurance are sufficient under the present circumstances.  Plaintiffs are free, however, to \nreturn to the Court for further relief if warranted. \n*     *     * \nThe Court, accordingly, will vacate the Rule but will decline Plaintiffs’ request that the \nCourt enter an injunction. \n  Class Certification \nFinally, the Court must consider whether to grant Plaintiffs’ motions for class \ncertification.16  The question of class certification arises in an unusual posture in this case \nbecause the Court directed that the parties brief the merits on an expedited basis (to obviate the \nneed for further litigation on Plaintiffs’ motions for preliminary relief) and because the parties \nconsolidated their briefing on class certification with the merits.  It is also unclear that class \ncertification will serve any significant purpose, given the Court’s decision on the merits and the \nrelief that the Court has already ordered.  But, because the law is unsettled on whether the Court \nmay, in its discretion, decline to certify a class (or may decline to decide whether to certify a \n                                                 \n16  Although mindful of the fact that Rule 23(c)(1) directs courts to resolve class certification \nmotions “[a]t an early practicable time,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(A), the Court notes that the rule \ngrants district courts “great discretion in determining the appropriate timing for such a ruling.”  \nHyman v. First Union Corp., 982 F. Supp. 8, 11 (D.D.C. 1997); see also 7A Charles Alan Wright \net al., Federal Practice & Procedure § 1785.3 (3d ed. Sept. 2018) (“The time at which the court \nfinds it appropriate to make its class-action determination may vary with the circumstances of the \nparticular case.”).  Thus, district courts are not required to decide class certification issues before \nruling on the merits.   \n66 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 67 of 77\nclass) based on these prudential considerations, and because class certification could have some \nbearing on future proceedings in this matter, the Court will resolve the pending motions.  \nCompare Shady Grove Orthopedic Assocs., P.A. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.S. 393, 398–400 \n(2010) (Rule 23 “says that if the prescribed preconditions are satisfied ‘[a] class action may be \nmaintained’ (emphasis added)—not “a class action may be permitted.”  Courts do not maintain \nactions; litigants do.”) with Tobias Barrington Wolff, Discretion in Class Certification, 162 U. \nPa. L. Rev. 1897, 1900 (2014) (“The Court did not indicate that it was effecting any radical \nchange [in Shady Grove], nor did it acknowledge any need to harmonize its assertion with the \ndecades of federal judicial holdings recognizing the discretion of district courts in matters \nrelating to class certification.”); see also Mills v. District of Columbia, 266 F.R.D. 20, 22 \n(D.D.C. 2010) (declining to certify class because declaration that statute was facially \nunconstitutional already provided complete relief to putative class members). \nTo proceed on behalf of a class, a plaintiff or group of plaintiffs must clear two hurdles.  \nFirst, the putative class representatives must show that “(1) the class is so numerous that joinder \nof all members is impractical; (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class; (3) the \nclaims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; \nand (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.”  \nFed. R. Civ. P. (23)(a).  These four “prerequisites,” DL v. District of Columbia, 860 F.3d 713, \n723 (D.C. Cir. 2017), are referred to as numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of \nrepresentation, Amgen Inc. v. Conn. Ret. Plans & Trust Funds, 133 S. Ct. 1184, 1191 (2013).  \nSecond, the “plaintiffs must then demonstrate that their proposed class falls into one of the \ncategories of class actions listed in Rule 23(b).”  DL, 860 F.3d at 723.  As relevant here, Rule \n23(b)(2) applies if “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply \n67 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 68 of 77\ngenerally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is \nappropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  Because “[t]he class \naction is ‘an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the \nindividual named parties only,’” Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, 589 U.S. 27, 33 (2013) \n(quoting Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 700–01 (1979)), the party seeking class treatment \n“must affirmatively demonstrate . . . compliance” with Rule 23, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, \n564 U.S. 338, 351 (2011).   \n1.  Rule 23(a) and (b) \nHere, the four “prerequisites” contained in Rule 23(a) are readily satisfied.  First, \nDefendants do not dispute—nor could they—that the proposed class, which consists of “[a]ll \nnoncitizen asylum-seekers who have entered or will enter the United States through the southern \nborder but outside ports of entry after November 9, 2018,” Dkt. 51 at 21–22; Dkt. 52 at 1–2, \nsatisfies the numerosity requirement.  To meet this requirement, Plaintiffs need not clear any \n“specific threshold,” although “courts in this jurisdiction have observed that a class of at least \nforty members is sufficiently large to meet this requirement.”  Taylor v. D.C. Water & Sewer \nAuth., 241 F.R.D. 33, 37 (D.D.C. 2007).  Plaintiffs may satisfy the requirement, moreover, by \nsupplying estimates, rather than a precise number, of putative class members, see Pigford v. \nGlickman, 182 F.R.D. 341, 347–48 (D.D.C. 1998), “so long as there is a reasonable basis for the \nestimate provided,” Kifafi v. Hilton Hotels Ret. Plan, 189 F.R.D. 174, 176 (D.D.C. 1999).  \nRelying on statistics available in the Administrative Record, Plaintiffs reasonably estimate that \nthe class consists of “thousands of migrants who have crossed and will cross the United States’ \nsouthern border outside ports of entry.”  Dkt. 52-1 at 16.  That is sufficient to satisfy the \nnumerosity requirement. \n68 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 69 of 77\n  The second and third requirements, commonality and typicality, often overlap.  The \nsecond requirement is satisfied if “there are questions of law or fact common to the class,” Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 23(a)(2), and the third is satisfied if “the claims or defenses of the representative \nparties are typical of the claims or defenses of class,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3).  The commonality \nrequirement is satisfied if class members’ claims “depend upon a common contention” that “is \ncapable of classwide resolution—which means that determination of its truth or falsity will \nresolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.”  Dukes, \n564 U.S. at 350.  The typicality requirement, in turn, demands that the proposed, representative \nplaintiffs “possess the same interest and suffer the same injury” as the other class members.  \nGen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 156 (1982) (internal quotation marks and citations \nomitted).  “While commonality requires a showing that the members of the class suffered an \ninjury resulting from the defendant’s conduct, the typicality requirement focuses on whether the \nrepresentatives of the class suffered a similar injury from the same course of conduct.”  Bynum v. \nD.C., 214 F.R.D. 27, 34 (D.D.C. 2003).  Both requirements are satisfied here.  All members of \nthe proposed class, and all of the proposed class representatives, face the same threat of injury: \nloss of the right to seek asylum because they entered the United States across the southern border \nafter November 9, 2018, outside a designated port of entry.  All challenge the same Rule on the \nsame grounds, and all seek the same remedy—invalidation of the Rule.  Finally, all have the \nsame interest in this Court’s judgment and will likely share an interest in any further relief they \nmight subsequently decide to seek. \nDefendants disagree, arguing that “the proposed class includes disparate groups of \npersons whose statutory and constitutional rights are distinct . . . and thus would be affected by \nthe Rule differently.”  Dkt. 66 at 60–61.  The Court is unpersuaded.  Unlike in Dukes, where the \n69 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 70 of 77\nSupreme Court reasoned that no “glue” held together each of the purported acts of discrimination \nalleged by a class of women, 564 U.S. at 352, Plaintiffs and the putative class members share an \nidentical interest in the invalidation of the Rule and in enforcing this Court’s decision.  \nCommonality is satisfied where there is “a uniform policy or practice that affects all class \nmembers,” DL, 713 F.3d at 128, and that principle applies with equal force to the typicality \nrequirement.  Because the Rule exposes all putative class members and all named Plaintiffs to \nthe same deprivation of their statutory right to seek asylum, the Court finds that the proposed \nclass satisfies Rule 23(a)’s requirements of commonality and typicality.   \nFinally, Plaintiffs also satisfy Rule 23(a)’s adequacy of representation requirement.  This \nrequirement imposes two conditions on plaintiffs seeking to represent a class: first, “the named \nrepresentative must not have antagonistic or conflicting interests with the unnamed members of \nthe class,” and second, “the representative must appear able to vigorously prosecute the interests \nof the class through qualified counsel.”  Twelve John Does v. Disttrict of Columbia, 117 F.3d \n571, 575 (D.C. Cir. 1997).  Here, Defendants challenge only the first of these conditions, arguing \nthat the named representatives “cannot vigorously prosecute the interests of the entire class, \nwhich [includes members in] diverse and disparate situations.”  Dkt. 66 at 63–64.  But that \nargument merely rehashes Defendants’ attack on the commonality and typicality of Plaintiffs’ \nclaims.  To be sure, each individual plaintiff and member of the putative class will have a unique \ninterest in pursuing his or her own claim to asylum.  That, however, is not what this case is \nabout.  It relates solely to whether the individual plaintiffs and putative class members will have \nan opportunity to pursue those claims, unencumbered by the Rule’s categorical ban.   \nAlthough Defendants do not dispute that Plaintiffs’ counsel are qualified to represent the \nclass, the Court has considered that question sua sponte and concludes that current counsel is \n70 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 71 of 77\nwell-qualified to do so.  As shown by the declarations submitted in support of class certification, \ncurrent counsel are willing and have the ability vigorously to litigate this case and to protect the \ninterests of absent class members.  See Dkt. 51-13 (Reyes Decl.); Dkt. 51-14 (Vieux Decl.); Dkt. \n51-15 (Roth Decl.); Dkt. 52-10 (Govindaiah Decl.); Dkt. 52-11 (Appelbaum Decl.).  The Court, \naccordingly, concludes that the adequacy of representation requirement is satisfied. \nThe Court also concludes that Plaintiffs have shown that Rule 23(b)(2) is satisfied in this \ncase.  Rule 23(b)(2) applies if “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on \ngrounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding \ndeclaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  “The \nkey to the (b)(2) class is the indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy \nwarranted—the notion that the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only \nas to all of the class members or as to none of them.”  Dukes, 564 U.S. at 360 (internal quotation \nmarks and citations omitted).  Rule 23(b)(2) imposes “two requirements: (1) that defendant’s \nactions or refusal to act are ‘generally applicable to the class’ and (2) that plaintiffs seek final \ninjunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief on behalf of the class.”  Bynum, 214 F.R.D. \nat 37.  Both requirements are satisfied here.  The Rule imposes a categorical ban on asylum \neligibility that is applicable to the named Plaintiffs and to the entire class they seek to represent.  \nThe relief Plaintiffs seek, moreover—a declaration that the Rule is unlawful and an injunction \nsetting the Rule aside, Dkt. 39 at 68 (S.M.S.R. Amend. Compl. Prayer for Relief); Dkt. 40 at 35–\n36 (O.A. Amend. Compl. Prayer for Relief)—would prevent Defendants from applying the \ncategorical bar to every member of the proposed class “in one stroke.”  Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350. \nEchoing their contentions that Plaintiffs have failed to satisfy the commonality, \ntypicality, and adequacy of representation requirements, Defendants contend that Rule 23(b)(2) \n71 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 72 of 77\nis not satisfied because a single remedy would not serve all members of the putative class.  That \ncontention, once again, conflates Plaintiffs’ challenge to the categorical bar on eligibility for \nasylum—which applies equally to all members of the putative class—with each putative member \nof the class’s unique interest in seeking asylum, which is not at issue in this case.  The relief \nPlaintiffs seek is “generally applicable to the class” and is indivisible.  See Garcia Ramirez v. \nU.S. Immigration & Customs Enf’t, 338 F. Supp. 3d 1, 48 (D.D.C. 2018) (Rule 23(b) satisfied \nwhere plaintiffs “d[id] not seek a court order mandating any particular outcome with respect to \nany particular [individual plaintiff]”); see also Damus v. Nielsen, 313 F. Supp. 3d 317, 334–35 \n(D.D.C. 2018) (Rule 23(b)(2) satisfied where plaintiffs were not asking the court “to remedy \ndiscrete errors in their parole determinations,” but rather “only . . . address an alleged systematic \nharm”); R.I.L-R v. Johnson, 80 F. Supp. 3d 164, 182 (D.D.C. 2015) (Rule 23(b)(2) satisfied \nwhere plaintiffs sought to enjoin ICE from consideration of particular factor in making detention \ndetermination). \nThe Court, accordingly, concludes that Plaintiffs have satisfied the requirements of Rule \n23(a) and (b).  Defendants argue that class certification is nonetheless inappropriate for two \nfurther reasons: (1) the Court allegedly lacks jurisdiction to certify a class, Dkt. 66 at 53–56; and \n(2) Plaintiffs’ proposed class is purportedly “overbroad and not ascertainable,” id. at 57–59.   \n2.  Jurisdiction to Certify a Class \nDefendants argue that the Court lacks jurisdiction to certify a class for two reasons.  First, \nthey argue that because “challenges to the Rule must be made either in a petition for review \nunder 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9) or under the requirements for expedited-removal challenges \nprovided by 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3),” Dkt. 66 at 53, the Court lacks jurisdiction to certify a class.  \nThat contention, however, merely repeats the jurisdictional arguments that the Court considered, \nand rejected, above.  Because § 1252(b)(9) does not govern Plaintiffs’ claims, it has no bearing \n72 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 73 of 77\non class certification.  Defendants are correct, though, that § 1252(e)(1) precludes certification of \na class “in any action for which judicial review is authorized” by § 1252(e)(3).  Although the \nCourt has recognized that an argument can be made that § 1252(e)(3) applies to the claims of \nsome of the individual plaintiffs, see supra 38–43, the Court has declined to embrace that \ncontention.  But, even if § 1252(e)(1) might apply to the claims of some of the individual \nplaintiffs, that would at most preclude those plaintiffs from serving as class representatives.  \nThose plaintiffs who were never placed in expedited removal proceedings would be able to \npursue their claims on behalf of the class. \nSecond, Defendants rely on 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1), which states: \nRegardless of the nature of the action or claim of the identity of the party or \nparties bringing the action, no court (other than the Supreme Court) shall have \njurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of the provisions of \npart IV of this subchapter [8 U.S.C. §§ 1221–1232], other than with respect to \nthe  application  of  such  provisions  to  an  individual  alien  against  whom \nproceedings . . . have been initiated. \n \n8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1).  Because the Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief in addition to a declaration \nthat the Rule is invalid, and because the Supreme Court has made clear that § 1252(f)(1) bars \n“classwide injunctive relief against the operation of §§ 1221–123[2],” Dkt. 66 at 54 (quoting \nAADC, 525 U.S. at 481–82), Defendants argue that this provision “dooms” the bid for class \ncertification.  Dkt. 66 at 54.  The Court disagrees.  As initial matter, § 1252(f) applies only to \nefforts to enjoin the operation of “part IV” of the INA, §§ 1221–1232.  The asylum provision \nDefendants invoked as authorization to issue the challenged Rule, however, is contained in part \nII of the INA.  Defendants make no attempt to explain why the Attorney General and the \nSecretary pf Homeland Security’s exercise of authority under 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(2)(C) to \nestablish conditions “under which an alien shall be ineligible for asylum under [§ 1158(b)(1)]” \nwould fall under § 1252(f)(1)’s limitation on injunctive relief regarding “the operation of \n73 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 74 of 77\n§§ 1221–123[2],” AADC, 525 U.S. at 481–82; see also Gonzales v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 508 \nF.3d 1227, 1233 (9th Cir. 2007) (“Section 1252(f)(1) does not prohibit the current injunction \nbecause . . . it directly implicates the adjustment of status provision which falls under part V of \nsubchapter II, notwithstanding that a reinstatement proceeding [under part IV] may be a \ncollateral consequence of an unsuccessful adjustment application.”); Catholic Soc. Servs., Inc. v. \nINS, 232 F.3d 1139, 1150 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc) (upholding injunction issued under statutory \nprovision governing adjustment of status, located in part V of the INA).  Although asylum \nofficers are charged with implementing the Rule in expedited removal proceedings, which are \nauthorized in part IV, the relief Plaintiffs seek would not enjoin the operation of removal \nproceedings. \nBut, even if Plaintiffs did seek to enjoin the operation of removal proceedings, \nDefendants’ reliance on § 1252(f) would fail.  As the Ninth Circuit held in Jennings, and the \nSupreme Court did not question, § 1252(f) does not affect a lower court’s “‘jurisdiction over . . . \nstatutory claims because those claims d[o] not ‘seek to enjoin the operation of the immigration \ndetention statutes, but to enjoin conduct . . . not authorized by the statutes.’”  138 S. Ct. at 851 \n(emphasis omitted) (quoting Rodriguez v. Hayes, 591 F.3d 1105, 1120 (9th Cir. 2010)).  In other \nwords, “[w]here . . . a petitioner seeks to enjoin conduct that allegedly is not even authorized by \nthe statute, the court is not enjoining the operation of [the statute], and § 1252(f)(1) therefore is \nnot implicated.” Rodriguez, 591 F.3d at 1120 (internal quotations and citations omitted); see also \nGrace v. Whitaker, 344 F. Supp. 3d 96, 143 (D.D.C. 2018); Garcia Ramirez, 338 F. Supp. 3d at \n49; Damus v. Nielsen, 313 F. Supp. 3d at 328; R.I.L-R, 80 F. Supp. 3d at 184.  Where, as here, an \ninjunction would not obstruct the “operation of” a covered provision but merely enjoin conduct \nthat allegedly violates that provision, § 1252(f)(1) poses no bar to relief.   \n74 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 75 of 77\nFinally, even if § 1252(f) applied here, and even if it applied to claims that the \ngovernment has acted in excess of its statutory authority under the INA, it still would not \nforeclose class treatment because it “only bars injunctive relief,” not declaratory relief.  Hamama \nv. Adducci, 912 F.3d 869, 878 (6th Cir. 2018) (“[T]here is a big difference between barring the \ncertification of a class under Rule 23 and barring all injunctive relief.  The former bars a class \naction regarding anything; the latter only bars injunctive relief for anyone other than \nindividuals.” (emphases in original)); see also Alli v. Decker, 650 F.3d 1007, 1013 (3d Cir. 2011) \n(“[V]iewing the provision in context and then taking into consideration the heading of the \nprovision [‘limits on injunctive relief’], it is apparent that the jurisdictional limitations in § \n1252(f)(1) do not encompass declaratory relief.”); Rodriguez, 591 F.3d at 1119 (“It is simply not \nthe case that Section 1252(f) bars Petitioner from receiving declaratory relief on behalf of the \nclass.”); Reid v. Donelan, No. 13-30125-PBS, 2018 WL 5269992, at *6 (D. Mass. Oct. 23, 2018) \n(declining to address whether § 1252(f)(1) bars a class-wide injunction because the statute “does \nnot bar classwide declaratory relief, which suffices to satisfy Rule 23(b)(2)”). \n3.  Ascertainability \nFinally, Defendants argue that because the class “potentially includes all aliens outside \nthe United States and extraterritorial aliens have no right to challenge laws that apply only to \nthose on U.S. soil,” Plaintiffs have failed to define an ascertainable class.  Dkt. 66 at 58.  \nDefendants premise this contention on the theory that “[c]ourts in this Circuit have ‘grafted’ onto \nRule 23 an ‘implied’ requirement that a court should first determine whether a proposed class is \nadequately defined such that its members are clearly ascertainable, before reaching the four \n‘explicit’ prerequisites of Rule 23(a).”  Id. at 57 (quoting Brewer v. Lynch, No. CV 08-1747-\nBJR, 2015 WL 13604257, at *5 (D.D.C. Sept. 30, 2015)).  It is “far from clear,” however, “that \nthere exists in this district a requirement that a class certified under Rule 23(b)(2) must \n75 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 76 of 77\ndemonstrate ascertainability to merit certification.”  Garcia Ramirez, 338 F. Supp. 3d at 48.  The \nrequirement, moreover, “has been recently disavowed by four federal appellate courts,” and “the \nD.C. Circuit has not opined on the requirement.”  Hoyte v. District of Columbia, 325 F.R.D. 485, \n489 n.3 (D.D.C. 2017). \nOut of an abundance of caution, the Court will assume for present purposes that such a \nrequirement exists.  See id.  But even with that assumption, Defendants’ argument fails.  Where \nthe ascertainability requirement exists for Rule 23(b)(2) classes, the proponents of class \ncertification must demonstrate that “the general outlines of the members of the class are \ndeterminable at the outset of the litigation” without engaging in burdensome individualized \ndeterminations.  Brewer, 2015 WL 13604257, at *5 (internal quotation omitted).  The \nrequirement, however, “is not designed to be . . . particularly stringent.”  Id. \nThe class members here are easily determined.  The proposed class includes all asylum \nseekers who are subject to the Rule’s categorical prohibition on asylum eligibility.  It does not, as \nDefendants claim, include unknown and unidentifiable aliens who are outside the United States.  \nRather, aliens will only become members of the class if and when they enter the United States \nthrough the southern border without inspection.  Nor is it at all unusual or improper for a Rule \n23(b)(2) class to include future members.  See, e.g., Garcia Ramirez, 338 F. Supp. 3d at 49–50; \nAbdi v. Duke, 323 F.R.D. 131, 137–38 (W.D.N.Y. 2017); R.I.L-R, 80 F. Supp. 3d at 180; Duprey \nv. Conn. Dep’t of Motor Vehicles, 191 F.R.D. 329, 338 (D. Conn. 2000).  The proposed class in \nthis case is defined by clear and objective criteria:  If an asylum seeker crosses the southern \nborder outside of a port of entry after November 9, 2018, he or she is a member of the class.  \nThat determination does not require complicated or individualized determinations—indeed, these \n76 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-02718-RDM   Document 92   Filed 08/02/19   Page 77 of 77\ncriteria are precisely the same ones Defendants would apply in enforcing the Rule.  That is \nsufficient.   \n*     *     * \nThe Court, accordingly, concludes that Plaintiffs have carried their burden of \ndemonstrating that class treatment is warranted under Rule 23(b)(2).  The Court will enter a \nseparate order certifying the proposed class, designating the individual plaintiffs as class \nrepresentatives, and appointing Plaintiffs’ counsel to serve as counsel for the class. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court will GRANT in part and DENY in part \nPlaintiffs’ motions for summary judgment and class certification, Dkt. 51; Dkt. 52, and will \nDENY Defendants’ cross-motion, Dkt. 66.  The Court will DENY as moot Plaintiffs’ earlier-\nfiled motions for temporary and preliminary injunctive relief, Dkt. 6; Mot. for Temp. Restraining \nOrder, Dkt. 6, S.M.S.R. et al. v. Trump et al. (No. 18-2838).  A separate order consistent with this \nMemorandum Opinion will issue.   \n \n \n \n                                      /s/ Randolph D.
