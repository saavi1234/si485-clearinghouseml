    "summary": "<p><p>This case, filed in federal court in 2011 and settled in 2012, addressed the Adams County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department and its communication with deaf individuals incarcerated in its jail. The case&rsquo;s complaint described an incident in May 2010 in which law enforcement was called on two individuals engaged in an argument. Neither of the two--who became the case&rsquo;s individual plaintiffs--could speak, write, or read effectively in English. When Sheriff&rsquo;s deputies arrived, the plaintiffs were not able to communicate or explain what had happened. The complaint alleged that the deputies failed to provide a sign language interpreter or any other effective auxiliary aid. Instead, one of the individuals was arrested for allegedly hitting the second individual, despite the attempts by both to explain that no violence had occurred. While in custody, the arrestee was required to sign several forms that he did not understand, including a Miranda form acknowledging that he knew his rights. Throughout his 25-day detention at the Adams County Detention Facility, staff failed to provide him with appropriate auxiliary aids or services. He was unable to call anyone, to communicate during his medical intake, or understand why he was being detained.</p>\r</p><p><p>This lawsuit followed. It was filed November 23, 2011 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. The two deaf individuals were represented by the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition. The plaintiffs sued the Sheriff of Adams County in his official capacity under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. They sought declaratory relief, damages, and an injunction requiring the defendant to provide qualified sign language interpreters or other appropriate auxiliary aids or services to ensure effective communication with deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals. On January 26, 2012, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that added two additional individual plaintiffs. One was another deaf individual who communicated only through American Sign Language. He was detained at the Adams County Detention Facility for six days and unable to communicate during his detention. The other plaintiff was his aunt. The amended complaint also added the Colorado Association of the Deaf as a plaintiff.</p>\r</p><p><p>On March 13, 2012, District Judge John L. Kane referred the case to Magistrate Judge Boyd N. Boland. The parties then spent the next several months engaging in settlement conversations. On September 25, they moved to dismiss the case because they had reached a settlement agreement. The agreement required the defendant to change jail policies to ensure that detained individuals who required sign language interpretation knew how to request it. The settlement also required the defendants to provide training for staff, verify and monitor compliance with the agreement, and pay $100,000 to the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition Legal Program. On September 27, 2012, Judge Kane granted the parties&rsquo; motion to dismiss the case and retained jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement for two years. There are no further docket entries. The enforcement period was scheduled to end in 2014, so the case is now closed.</p></p>",

On July 26, 1990, now more than twenty years ago, the ADA was passed,\nestablishing the most important civil rights law for people with disabilities in the nation’s\nhistory.\n2. The ADA was passed to ensure people with disabilities are not discriminated\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB   Document 1   Filed 11/23/11   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 21\nagainst.\n3. One of the purposes of the ADA is ensuring that deaf or hard-of-hearing\nindividuals receive qualified sign language interpreter services or other auxiliary aids and\nservices to ensure effective communication.\n4. Title II of the ADA specifically applies to public entities, such as the Adams\nCounty, Colorado Sheriff’s Office (“ACSO”).\n5. As set forth more fully below, ACSO has discriminated against deaf and hard-of-\nhearing individuals who have been contacted as alleged victims of crimes, against alleged deaf\nor hard of hearing perpetrators and against deaf or hard of hearing individuals detained at the\nAdams County Detention Facility (“ACDF”).\n6. ACSO has refused to provide effective communication for deaf persons.\n7. Plaintiffs seek a court order compelling the ACSO to comply with the ADA and\nSection 504, monetary damages and the recovery of their reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.\nJurisdiction and Venue\n8. This Court has jurisdiction over the federal claims in this action pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343.\n9. Venue is proper within this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391.\nParties\n10. Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition (“CCDC”) is a Colorado non-profit\ncorporation whose members are persons with disabilities and their non-disabled allies.\n11. Plaintiff Timothy Siaki is and was at all times material hereto a resident of\n2\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB   Document 1   Filed 11/23/11   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 21\nColorado.  Mr. Siaki is deaf.  Mr. Siaki is a CCDC member.\n12. Plaintiff Kimberlee Moore is and was at all times material hereto a resident of\nColorado.  Ms. Moore is deaf.  Ms. Moore is a CCDC member.\n13. Defendant Douglas Darr is the Sheriff of Adams County, Colorado, elected and\nserving pursuant to Part 5, Article 10, Title 30, Colorado Revised Statutes.  Sheriff Darr is\nresponsible for the operations of ACSO.  On information and belief, Sheriff Darr also serves as\nthe custodian of the ACDF.  Colo. Rev. Stat. § 30-10-511.  ACSO is responsible for the\noperations of the ACDF.  Sheriff Darr is sued in his official capacity as the Sheriff of Adams\nCounty, Colorado. \nFacts\n14. According to its website http://apps.adcogov.org/sheriff/divisions.html, ACSO\noperates an Administrative Services Division, a Patrol Division, a Sheriff’s Substation, a\nSheriff’s Detention Division, and a Jail Division, which consists of a Booking Section, Court\nSecurity Section, Detective Unit, Security Section, Transport Section, Accounting Unit, Bonding\nUnit, Court Services Section, Mail Unit, Programs Section, Jail Records Section, and Technical\nServices. \n15. In May of 2010, Mr. Siaki and Ms. Moore were staying at a Super 8 Motel,\nlocated at 5888 Broadway, Denver, Colorado.\n16. Late in the evening of May 14, 2010, Ms. Moore returned home and, upon her\nreturn, she and Mr. Siaki had an argument.\n17. Both Mr. Siaki and Ms. Moore are deaf and communicate by using American\n3\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB   Document 1   Filed 11/23/11   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 21\nSign Language (“ASL”).\n18. ASL is a separate and distinct language from English, which uses its own unique\nphrases, descriptions, syntax and grammatical rules.\n19. Mr. Siaki does not speak, read or write in English.\n20. Mr. Siaki does not read lips.\n21. Ms. Moore has a very limited ability to speak, read and write in English.\n22. Ms. Moore can occasionally read lips when she is familiar with the speaker and\nthe speaker’s speech patterns.\n23. As set forth in records and documents from the public defender’s office involved\nin Mr. Siaki’s criminal case and from the ACSO in this case, there are conflicting statements\nfrom witnesses who claimed to hear what transpired in the room that evening; however, both Mr.\nSiaki and Ms. Moore allege Mr. Siaki never harmed Ms. Moore.  ACSO records demonstrate the\nACSO deputies alleged Mr. Siaki hit Ms. Moore.\n24. Plaintiffs have denied and continue to deny this allegation and tried to\ncommunicate this to the ACSO’s officers on May 14, 2010.\n25. Like other deaf individuals, Plaintiffs Siaki and Moore both verbalize sounds\nwhich, to a person who is not deaf or who is unfamiliar, may sound like the deaf person is\nspeaking loudly or abruptly.\n26. On May 14, 2010, two ACSO deputies broke down the door to Mr. Siaki and Ms.\nMoore’s room, entered the room with their guns drawn, and ordered Mr. Siaki to the floor.\n27. On information and belief, the two ACSO deputies were Jaime Keefer and\n4\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB   Document 1   Filed 11/23/11   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 21\nChristopher Eye.\n28. Both deputies were aware that Mr. Siaki was deaf soon after their arrival.\n29. Both deputies were aware Ms. Moore was deaf soon after their arrival.\n30. Because Mr. Siaki is deaf, he was unable to understand the Deputies’ commands.\n31. Deputy Keefer grabbed Mr. Siaki’s left arm and physically forced him to the\nfloor.\n32. Based on statements obtained, he did so because he believed Mr. Siaki was not\ncomplying with his orders.\n33. Mr. Siaki had no understanding of what the deputies said before forcing him to\nthe floor.\n34. One of the deputies handcuffed Mr. Siaki behind his back.\n35. Deputy Keefer knew Mr. Siaki was deaf, but made assumptions that Mr. Siaki\ncould understand Deputy Keefer.\n36. According to Deputy Keefer’s statement in the record, Deputy Keefer instructed\nMr. Siaki to write his version of events on a piece of paper.\n37. Deputy Keefer wrote in his Affidavit in Support of Warrantless Arrest that Mr.\nSiaki “refused” to write.\n38. Mr. Siaki cannot read and write effectively.\n39. Throughout their interaction on May 14, 2010, Mr. Siaki attempted as best he\ncould to communicate to the deputies that he did not read, write, speak or understand English,\nand that he required a qualified sign language interpreter, but the Deputies did not offer or\n5\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB   Document 1   Filed 11/23/11   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 21\nprovide him with an interpreter or any other auxiliary aid or service.\n40. Neither deputy attempted to offer or provide auxiliary aids and services to Mr.\nSiaki.\n41. Mr. Siaki’s inability to communicate effectively verbally and in writing is readily\napparent.\n42. On information and belief, the deputies had no reason to force Mr. Siaki to the\nfloor and handcuff him except for their mistaken belief that he understood what they said and\nrefused to comply.\n43. At or about the time Deputy Keefer forced Mr. Siaki to the floor, Deputy Eye\ntook Ms. Moore from the room.\n44. Ms. Moore posed no threat of any kind to the health or safety of the deputies or\nanyone else.\n45. While outside, Deputy Eye requested that Ms. Moore complete a written\nstatement.\n46. Ms. Moore is unable to communicate effectively by writing in English.\n47. Ms. Moore attempted to the best of her ability to communicate to Deputy Eye that\nshe is unable to communicate effectively by writing in English, but was unable to do so\neffectively because she was not offered or provided a qualified sign language interpreter.\n48. Because Ms. Moore was not offered or provided with appropriate auxiliary aids\nand services, she was unable to communicate effectively what happened.\n49. Neither deputy attempted to offer or provide auxiliary aids and services to Ms.\n6\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB   Document 1   Filed 11/23/11   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 21\nMoore.\n50. As a result, Ms. Moore’s written statement is inaccurate.\n51. The deputies contacted North Washington Fire Department (“NWFD”)\nparamedics to examine Ms. Moore.\n52. Defendants neither offered nor provided auxiliary aids and services for Ms.\nMoore’s interactions with the paramedics.\n53. Ms. Moore was unable to effectively communicate with the paramedics because\nshe was not provided with appropriate auxiliary aids and services.\n54. Ms. Moore wanted to communicate to the paramedics that Ms. Siaki did not hit\nher.\n55. According to Deputy Keefer’s Affidavit in Support of Warrantless Arrest,\n“Deputy Eye advised [Deputy Keefer] while Kimberly [sic] was being treated inside the\nambulance she told the paramedics Timothy had hit her in the mouth.”\n56. Because ACSO’s deputies failed to provide effective communication, Ms. Moore\nwas not able to communicate effectively with the deputies.\n57. Deputy Keefer decided that Mr. Siaki had hit Ms. Moore and placed him under\narrest.\n58. When Ms. Moore realized that the deputies were placing Mr. Siaki under arrest\nfor allegedly hitting her, she attempted to clear up the confusion, but she was unable to do so\nbecause the deputies neither offered nor provided auxiliary aids and services that would have\nenabled Ms. Moore to communicate effectively.  \n7\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB   Document 1   Filed 11/23/11   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 21\n59. Deputy Eye reported in an Incident/Investigation Report as “[t]he female party\nchanged her story and said that the male party did not punch her, that he had tried to catch her by\nthe neck/jaw as she was falling down from tripping.”\n60. Deputy Keefer completed a “Domestic Violence Case Summary” form, and\ndirected Ms. Moore to sign it.\n61. That “Domestic Violence Case Summary” form indicated that Mr. Siaki had\nstruck Ms. Moore with his hand, had pushed and shoved her, and that Ms. Moore did not require\nan interpreter.\n62. The effect of signing the “Domestic Violence Case Summary” form to comply\nwith Deputy Keefer’s instructions was that Ms. Moore affirmed that the information contained\non the form was correct; however, Ms. Moore did not understand the form, did not complete the\nform, disputes several of the statements made on the form, and only signed the form because she\nwas directed to do so by Deputy Keefer.\n63. Mr. Siaki was handcuffed and transported to an Adams County substation for\nbooking.\n64. Because Mr. Siaki was denied access to effective communication by the deputies,\nhe did not know why he was being arrested and did not know where he was being taken.\n65. Because Ms. Moore was denied access to effective communication by the\ndeputies, she did not know why Mr. Siaki was being arrested and did not know where he was\nbeing taken.\n66. While at the Adams County substation, Deputy Keefer gave Mr. Siaki a form\n8\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB   Document 1   Filed 11/23/11   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 21\nwith his Miranda rights, written in English.\n67. Deputy Keefer directed Mr. Siaki to sign the Miranda rights form.\n68. Mr. Siaki did not understand his Miranda rights.\n69. Mr. Siaki was denied access to effective communication by the deputies and,\ntherefore, could not convey that he did not understand the Miranda form.\n70. Mr. Siaki did not understand that by signing the Miranda rights form, he was\nacknowledging that he understood what his rights were.\n71. Because Mr. Siaki, while in custody, was directed to sign the form by Deputy\nKeefer, he signed the form.\n72. At the substation, Mr. Siaki was directed to sign several other forms.  He did not\nunderstand any of the forms or the effect of his signature on those forms.  \n73. Mr. Siaki signed the forms because he was afraid of the deputies who directed\nhim to sign the forms.\n74. The ACSO neither offered nor provided Mr. Siaki access to effective\ncommunication at the substation.\n75. Mr .Siaki remained at the substation for approximately one hour before being\ntransported to the Adams County Detention Facility (“ACDF”).\n76. For the entirety of his time at the Adams County substation, Mr. Siaki repeatedly\nattempted to request a sign language interpreter, but the Adams County Deputies and staff did\nnot offer or provide him with appropriate auxiliary aids and services, including a sign language\ninterpreter.\n9\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB   Document 1   Filed 11/23/11   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 21\n77. For the entirety of his time at the Adams County substation, the Adams County\nDeputies and staff did not offer or provide Mr. Siaki with a means by which he could\ncommunicate his need for a sign language interpreter.\n78. Due to ACSO’s failure to offer or provide  appropriate auxiliary aids and services,\nMr. Siaki was unable to communicate effectively with anyone while at the substation.\n79. Mr. Siaki was also denied equal access to telecommunications equipment by\nACSO. \n80. Other hearing detainees had access to a telephone to make a call during the\nbooking process.\n81. Mr. Siaki was not provided access to a TDD (telecommunications device for the\ndeaf) on equal terms.\n82. After Mr. Siaki’s arrest, and using the internet-based relay system, My IP Relay,\nMs. Moore called Adams County inmate information telephone number.\n83. Ms. Moore called the Adams County inmate information telephone number in\norder to determine what was happening to Mr. Siaki, what he was charged with, where he was\ntaken, and whether there was a bond.\n84. The individual who answered Ms. Moore’s telephone call, on information and\nbelief, was an ACSO deputy or staff member by the name of Sally Elkerton.\n85. According to records obtained through releases and Colorado Access to Criminal\nJustice Act requests, Ms. Elkerton informed Ms. Moore of Mr. Siaki’s charge, and stated that she\nwould be unable to visit him for seven more days.\n10\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB   Document 1   Filed 11/23/11   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 21\n86. Ms. Moore then asked Ms. Elkerton when and where Mr. Siaki’s first court\nappearance would be.\n87. After some delay, Ms. Elkerton told Ms. Moore that Mr. Siaki was due in court at\n8:00 a.m. on the following Monday, which was approximately two days away.\n88. Ms. Elkerton told Ms. Moore that court would be convened at the ACDF address\nof 150 North Nineteenth Avenue, not the court address.\n89. Ms. Moore then called the ACSO at (303) 654-1850, also using a relay service\nand spoke with Adams County Detention Specialist Megan Moore.\n90. Ms. Moore asked Detention Specialist Moore about the date, time and location of\nMr. Siaki’s first court appearance.  Detention Specialist Moore told Ms. Moore that the\nappearance would be the following Monday at 8:00 a.m.\n91. Detention Specialist Moore gave Ms. Moore a different address for Mr. Siaki’s\ncourt appearance, which was for the Brighton Justice Center, 1100 Judicial Center Drive,\nBrighton, Colorado 80601.\n92. Detention Specialist Moore also informed Ms. Moore that a restraining order had\nbeen automatically entered, restraining Mr. Siaki from having contact with Ms. Moore.\n93. Ms. Moore was unaware of the restraining order.\n94. Ms. Moore was extremely concerned about Mr. Siaki’s health and safety.\n95. Ms. Moore felt isolated because, following Mr. Siaki’s arrest, she was left alone\nwith no idea when she would be able to see and communicate with him next.\n96. Upon Mr. Siaki’s arrival at the ACDF, he met with medical intake interviewers\n11\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB   Document 1   Filed 11/23/11   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 21\nwho conducted a medical intake.\n97. Mr. Siaki’s disability was readily apparent to the ACSO deputies and staff at the\nACDF, including the medical intake interviewers.\n98. Mr. Siaki attempted to the best of his ability to request a sign language\ninterpreter, but neither the ACSO deputies nor ACSO staff offered or provided Mr. Siaki with\nappropriate auxiliary aids and services, including a sign language interpreter.\n99. ACDF staff did not provide Mr. Siaki with a means to communicate his need for\nan interpreter.\n100. Because ACDF staff denied him access to appropriate auxiliary aids and services,\nMr. Siaki was unable to effectively communicate with the ACSO medical intake interviewers,\nand was unable to understand the forms the interviewers gave him.\n101. ACSO staff provided Mr. Siaki with an inmate handbook, which was written in\nEnglish.\n102. Mr. Siaki was unable to read or understand the inmate handbook in the absence of\nappropriate auxiliary aids and services.\n103. Mr. Siaki was detained at the ACDF for approximately twenty-five days, from\nMay 15, 2010 until June 10, 2010.\n104. Due to the ACSO deputies’ and staff’s failure to provide him with appropriate\nauxiliary aids and services, during Mr. Siaki’s entire detention at the ACDF was he unable to\neffectively communicate with the ACDF deputies or staff.\n105. During his detention, Mr. Siaki did not understand why he was being detained.\n12\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB   Document 1   Filed 11/23/11   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 21\n106. During his detention, ACDF staff did not offer or provide auxiliary aids and\nservices for any of the programs, services and activities available to hearing detainees.\n107. On information and belief, the ACSO staff communicated with detainees using\nauditory methods which Mr. Siaki could not hear.\n108. On information and belief, ACSO staff did not make such auditory\ncommunications accessible to Mr. Siaki.\n109. During Ms. Moore’s relay calls to the ACDF, she made clear she was deaf.\n110. When Ms. Moore was finally permitted to visit Mr. Siaki, ACSO staff did not\noffer or provide auxiliary aids and services to facilitate their communication.\n111. Ms. Moore was denied effective communication by Defendant.\n112. ACSO provides personnel who conduct pre-trial services interviews to all\ndetainees.\n113. ACSO neither offered nor provided Mr. Siaki with auxiliary aids and services for\neffective communication during his pre-trial services meeting.\n114. As a result of ACSO’s failure to offer or provide Mr. Siaki with auxiliary aids and\nservices for effective communication during his pre-trial services meeting, Mr. Siaki was denied\neffective communication with the interviewer.\n115. Mr. Siaki was damaged by Defendant’s unlawful discrimination.\n116. Ms. Moore was damaged by Defendant’s unlawful discrimination.\n117. ACSO refuses to offer or provide sign language interpreters or other appropriate\nauxiliary aids and services during interrogation by its deputies.\n13\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB   Document 1   Filed 11/23/11   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of 21\n118. ACSO refuses to offer or provide sign language interpreters or other appropriate\nauxiliary aids and services during booking.\n119. ACSO refuses to offer or provide sign language interpreters or other appropriate\nauxiliary aids and services during medical questioning.\n120. ACSO provides programs and services to detainees but does not provide auxiliary\naids and services for effective communication for detainees who are deaf for such programs and\nservices.\n121. On information and belief, ACSO has a policy, practice or custom of not\nproviding sign language interpreters or other appropriate auxiliary aids and services during \ninterrogations, bookings, medical questioning, counseling, programs and detentions.\n122. On information and belief, ACSO has never provided a qualified sign language\ninterpreter to any deaf individual who has been detained at the ACDF.\n123. In response to a Colorado Open Records Act request by the Colorado Cross-\nDisability Coalition, the ACSO reported that nine inmates identified as deaf were booked at the\nACDF from December 2009 to August 2011.\n124. ACSO denies access to auxiliary aids and services for deaf detainees (e.g., a TTY\nor video phone) to communicate with persons outside the Detention Facility during times when\nhearing detainees are permitted to make telephone calls.\n125. ACSO has no policies informing its employees and/or contractors about providing\nappropriate auxiliary aids and services to detainees who are deaf or hard of hearing.\n126. Plaintiffs and other deaf individuals will be harmed if Defendant does not change\n14\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB   Document 1   Filed 11/23/11   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of 21\nits policies, practices and procedures.\n127. Plaintiffs and other deaf individuals will be harmed if Defendant does not\nimmediately adopt and implement policies, practices and procedures to ensure that deaf\ndetainees are provided with effective communication.\n128. CCDC’s purpose is to promote independence, self-reliance, and full participation\nfor people with all types of disabilities, and to combat discrimination against individuals with\ndisabilities, through advocacy, education, research and training.  As a part of that purpose,\nCCDC seeks to ensure that individuals who are deaf and hard-of-hearing have access to -- and do\nnot encounter discrimination in -- participating in government services, including services while\nencountering law enforcement officials, and while being arrested, booked, interrogated, and\ndetained.\n129. CCDC engages in extensive outreach as well as advocacy and educational efforts\nto promote access for and combat discrimination against people with disabilities.  This effort and\nthis purpose have been and continue to be adversely affected by Defendant’s violations of the\nADA and Section 504.\n130. ACSO’s actions have caused and continue to cause distinct, palpable and\nperceptible injury to CCDC.  Those injuries include, but are not limited to, those described\nherein.\n131. CCDC has devoted resources, which could have been devoted to its other\noutreach, advocacy, and educational efforts, to communicating with Defendant in an attempt to\nsecure accessible services, activities and programs.\n15\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB   Document 1   Filed 11/23/11   USDC Colorado   Page 16 of 21\n132. CCDC has devoted resources, which could have been devoted to its other\noutreach, advocacy, and educational efforts, to educate members and others who have been\ninjured by Defendant’s discrimination.\n133. ACSO’s discrimination has been and continues to be a barrier to the full\nparticipation of persons with disabilities and, therefore, frustrates CCDC’s ability to achieve full\ninclusion for persons with disabilities.  For example: \na. Defendant’s discrimination, in and of itself, denies effective communication to\npeople who are deaf; and\nb. Defendant’s actions send the message that such discrimination continues to be\nacceptable at this time.\n134. Defendant’s discrimination has required and continues to require CCDC to make\na greater effort -- and to allocate significant resources -- to educate the public that such\ndiscrimination is wrong and otherwise to counteract the adverse impact of such discrimination. \nThis perceptibly impairs CCDC’s counseling, advocacy, educational, and training missions.\n135. CCDC also has devoted and continues to devote resources -- including but not\nlimited to those devoted to the present lawsuit -- to identifying and counteracting the sources of\ndiscrimination in the community, including that of Defendant.\n136. CCDC’s injuries -- including, without limitation, those described herein -- are\ntraceable to Defendant’s discriminatory conduct alleged in this Complaint and will be redressed\nby the relief requested in it.\n137. CCDC’s members include individuals who are deaf and hard of hearing who\n16\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB   Document 1   Filed 11/23/11   USDC Colorado   Page 17 of 21\nrequire auxiliary aids and services for effective communication. \n138. CCDC’s members have been injured and will continue to be injured by\nDefendant’s discrimination described above.\n139. The elimination of discrimination, such as that of Defendant, is at the core of\nCCDC’s organizational purpose.\n140. The participation of individual CCDC members in the lawsuit is not required\neither to resolve the claims at issue or to formulate relief.  \nFirst Claim for Relief\n(Violations of the ADA)\n141. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the remainder of the allegations\nset forth in this Complaint as fully set forth herein.\n142. Title II of the ADA provides in pertinent part: “[N]o qualified individual with a\ndisability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the\nbenefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subject to discrimination\nby any such entity.”\n143.

Plaintiff Siaki, Plaintiff Moore and other CCDC members who are deaf are likely\nto encounter the same discriminatory policies and practices.\n152. In the absence of the injunction requested herein, Defendant will continue to\ndiscriminate against Plaintiff Siaki, Plaintiff Moore and CCDC, including its members, on the\nbasis of disability in violation of Title II of the ADA and its implementing regulations.\n153.

Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the remainder of the allegations\nset forth in this Complaint as fully set forth herein.\n161. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), provides in\npertinent part:\nNo otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States . . . shall,\nsolely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be\ndenied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or\nactivity receiving Federal financial assistance.  \n162.

On July 26, 1990, now more than twenty years ago, the ADA was passed,\nestablishing the most important civil rights law for people with disabilities in the nation’s\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB   Document 6   Filed 01/26/12   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 29\nhistory.\n2. The ADA was passed to ensure people with disabilities are not discriminated\nagainst.\n3. One of the purposes of the ADA is ensuring that deaf or hard-of-hearing\nindividuals receive qualified sign language interpreter services or other auxiliary aids and\nservices to ensure effective communication.\n4. Title II of the ADA specifically applies to public entities, such as the Adams\nCounty, Colorado Sheriff’s Office (“ACSO”).\n5. As set forth more fully below, ACSO has discriminated against deaf and hard-of-\nhearing individuals who have been questioned as alleged victims of crimes, against deaf or hard\nof hearing alleged perpetrators and against deaf or hard of hearing individuals detained at the\nAdams County Detention Facility (“ACDF”).\n6. ACSO has refused to provide effective communication for deaf persons.\n7. Plaintiffs seek a court order compelling the ACSO to comply with the ADA and\nSection 504, monetary damages and the recovery of their reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.\nJurisdiction and Venue\n8. This Court has jurisdiction over the federal claims in this action pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343.\n9. Venue is proper within this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391.\nParties\n10. Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition (“CCDC”) is a Colorado non-profit\n2\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB   Document 6   Filed 01/26/12   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 29\ncorporation whose members are persons with disabilities and their non-disabled allies.\n11. Colorado Association of the Deaf (“CAD”) is a Colorado non-profit\ncorporation whose members are deaf individuals and their families.\n12. Plaintiff Timothy Siaki is and was at all times material hereto a resident of\nColorado.  Mr. Siaki is deaf. \n13. Plaintiff Kimberlee Moore is and was at all times material hereto a resident of\nColorado.  Ms. Moore is deaf.\n14. Plaintiff Michaelee Owen is and was at all times material hereto a resident of\nColorado.  Mr. Owen is deaf.\n15. Plaintiff Jeanine Roybal is and was at all times material hereto a resident of\nColorado.  Ms. Roybal is Plaintiff Owen’s guardian.\n16. Defendant Douglas Darr is the Sheriff of Adams County, Colorado, elected and\nserving pursuant to Part 5, Article 10, Title 30, Colorado Revised Statutes.  Sheriff Darr is\nresponsible for the operations of ACSO.  On information and belief, Sheriff Darr also serves as\nthe custodian of the ACDF.  Colo. Rev. Stat. § 30-10-511.  ACSO is responsible for the\noperations of the ACDF.  Sheriff Darr is sued in his official capacity as the Sheriff of Adams\nCounty, Colorado. \nFacts\n17. Plaintiffs Siaki, Moore, Owen and Roybal are all members of CCDC and/or CAD.\n18. ACSO operates an Administrative Services Division, a Patrol Division, a\nSheriff’s Substation, a Sheriff’s Detention Division, and a Jail Division.  The Jail Division \n3\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB   Document 6   Filed 01/26/12   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 29\nconsists of a Booking Section, Court Security Section, Detective Unit, Security Section,\nTransport Section, Accounting Unit, Bonding Unit, Court Services Section, Mail Unit, Programs\nSection, Jail Records Section, and Technical Services. \n19. In May of 2010, Mr. Siaki and Ms. Moore were staying at a Super 8 Motel,\nlocated at 5888 Broadway, Denver, Colorado.\n20. Late in the evening of May 14, 2010, Ms. Moore returned home and, upon her\nreturn, she and Mr. Siaki had an argument.\n21. Both Mr. Siaki and Ms. Moore are deaf and communicate by using American\nSign Language (“ASL”).\n22. ASL is a separate and distinct language from English, which uses its own unique\nphrases, descriptions, syntax and grammatical rules.\n23. Mr. Siaki does not speak, read or write effectively in English.\n24. Mr. Siaki does not read lips.\n25. Mr. Siaki can write some words and phrases, but he does not understand most\nwritten communication.\n26. Ms. Moore has a very limited ability to speak, read and write in English.\n27. Ms. Moore can occasionally read lips when she is familiar with the speaker and\nthe speaker’s speech patterns.\n28. As set forth in records and documents from the public defender’s office involved\nin Mr. Siaki’s criminal case and from the ACSO in this case, there are conflicting statements\nfrom witnesses who claimed to hear what transpired in the room that evening; however, both Mr.\n4\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB   Document 6   Filed 01/26/12   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 29\nSiaki and Ms. Moore allege Mr. Siaki never harmed Ms. Moore.  ACSO records demonstrate the\nACSO deputies alleged Mr. Siaki harmed Ms. Moore.\n29. Plaintiffs have denied and continue to deny this allegation and tried to\ncommunicate this to the ACSO’s officers on May 14, 2010.\n30. Like other deaf individuals, Plaintiffs Siaki and Moore both verbalize sounds\nwhich, to a person who is not deaf or who is unfamiliar, may sound like the deaf person is\nspeaking loudly or abruptly.\n31. On May 14, 2010, two ACSO deputies went to hotel room where Mr. Siaki and\nMs. Moore were staying.\n32. The two ACSO deputies were Jaime Keefer and Christopher Eye.\n33. Deputy Keefer broke open the door to Mr. Siaki and Ms. Moore’s room.\n34. One of the two deputies entered the room with a gun drawn.\n35. Deputy Keefer ordered Mr. Siaki to the floor.\n36. Mr. Siaki did not hear him and did not understand.\n37. Mr. Siaki pointed to his ears and shook his head “no” to indicate he is deaf.\n38. Deputy Keefer was aware that Mr. Siaki was deaf soon after their arrival.\n39. Deputy Eye was aware Ms. Moore was deaf soon after their arrival.\n40. Because Mr. Siaki is deaf, he was unable to understand the Deputies’ commands.\n41. Deputy Keefer grabbed Mr. Siaki’s left arm and physically forced him to the\nfloor.\n42. Deputy Keefer forced Mr. Siaki to the floor because he believed Mr. Siaki was\n5\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB   Document 6   Filed 01/26/12   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 29\nnot complying with his orders.\n43. Mr. Siaki had no understanding of what the deputies said before forcing him to\nthe floor.\n44. One of the deputies handcuffed Mr. Siaki behind his back.\n45. Deputy Keefer knew Mr. Siaki was deaf, but made assumptions that Mr. Siaki\ncould understand Deputy Keefer.\n46. According to Deputy Keefer’s statement in the record, Deputy Keefer instructed\nMr. Siaki to write his version of events on a piece of paper.\n47. Deputy Keefer wrote in his Affidavit in Support of Warrantless Arrest that Mr.\nSiaki “refused” to write.\n48. Mr. Siaki cannot read and write effectively.\n49. Throughout their interaction on May 14, 2010, Mr. Siaki attempted as best he\ncould to communicate to the deputies that he required a qualified sign language interpreter, but\nthe Deputies did not offer or provide him with an interpreter.\n50. After Mr. Siaki was handcuffed, he had no way of communicating.\n51. Neither deputy attempted to offer or provide auxiliary aids and services to Mr.\nSiaki.\n52. Mr. Siaki’s inability to communicate effectively verbally is readily apparent.\n53. Mr. Siaki’s inability to communicate effectively in writing is readily apparent.\n54. The deputies had no reason to force Mr. Siaki to the floor and handcuff him\nexcept for their mistaken belief that he understood what they said and refused to comply.\n6\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB   Document 6   Filed 01/26/12   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 29\n55. At or about the time Deputy Keefer forced Mr. Siaki to the floor, Deputy Eye\ntook Ms. Moore from the room.\n56. Ms. Moore posed no threat of any kind to the health or safety of the deputies or\nanyone else.\n57. While outside, Deputy Eye requested that Ms. Moore complete a written\nstatement.\n58. Ms. Moore is unable to communicate effectively by writing in English.\n59. Ms. Moore was unable to communicate effectively because she was not offered or\nprovided a qualified sign language interpreter.\n60. Because Ms. Moore was not offered or provided with appropriate auxiliary aids\nand services, she was unable to communicate effectively what happened.\n61. Neither deputy attempted to offer or provide auxiliary aids and services to Ms.\nMoore.\n62. As a result, Ms. Moore’s written statement is inaccurate.\n63. The deputies called North Washington Fire Department (“NWFD”) paramedics to\nexamine Ms. Moore.\n64. Defendant neither offered nor provided auxiliary aids and services for Ms.\nMoore’s interactions with the paramedics.\n65. Ms. Moore was unable to effectively communicate with the paramedics because\nshe was not provided with appropriate auxiliary aids and services.\n66. Ms. Moore wanted to communicate to the paramedics that Ms. Siaki did not hit\n7\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB   Document 6   Filed 01/26/12   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 29\nher.\n67. According to Deputy Keefer’s Affidavit in Support of Warrantless Arrest,\n“Deputy Eye advised [Deputy Keefer] while Kimberly [sic] was being treated inside the\nambulance she told the paramedics Timothy had hit her in the mouth.”\n68. Because ACSO’s deputies failed to provide effective communication, Ms. Moore\nwas not able to communicate effectively with the deputies.\n69. Deputy Keefer decided that Mr. Siaki had hit Ms. Moore and placed him under\narrest.\n70. Deputy Eye reported in a later Incident/Investigation Report as “[t]he female\nparty changed her story and said that the male party did not punch her, that he had tried to catch\nher by the neck/jaw as she was falling down from tripping.”\n71. Deputy Keefer completed a “Domestic Violence Case Summary” form, and\ndirected Ms. Moore to sign it.\n72. That “Domestic Violence Case Summary” form indicated that Mr. Siaki had\nstruck Ms. Moore with his hand, had pushed and shoved her, and that Ms. Moore did not require\nan interpreter.\n73. The effect of signing the “Domestic Violence Case Summary” form to comply\nwith Deputy Keefer’s instructions was that Ms. Moore affirmed that the information contained\non the form was correct.\n74. Ms. Moore did not understand the form, did not complete the form, disputes\nseveral of the statements made on the form, and only signed the form because she was directed\n8\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB   Document 6   Filed 01/26/12   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 29\nto do so by Deputy Keefer.\n75. Mr. Siaki was handcuffed and transported to an Adams County substation for\nbooking.\n76. Because Mr. Siaki was denied access to effective communication by the deputies,\nhe did not know why he was being arrested and did not know where he was being taken.\n77. Because Ms. Moore was denied access to effective communication by the\ndeputies, she did not know why Mr. Siaki was being arrested and did not know where he was\nbeing taken.\n78. While at the Adams County substation, Deputy Keefer gave Mr. Siaki a form\nwith his Miranda rights, written in English.\n79. Deputy Keefer directed Mr. Siaki to sign the Miranda rights form.\n80. Mr. Siaki did not understand his Miranda rights.\n81. Mr. Siaki was denied access to effective communication by the deputies and,\ntherefore, could not convey that he did not understand the Miranda form.\n82. Mr. Siaki did not understand that by signing the Miranda rights form, he was\nacknowledging that he understood what his rights were.\n83. Because Mr. Siaki, while in custody, was directed to sign the form by Deputy\nKeefer, he signed the form.\n84. At the substation, Mr. Siaki was directed to sign several other forms.  He did not\nunderstand any of the forms or the effect of his signature on those forms.  \n85. Mr. Siaki signed the forms because he was afraid of the deputies who directed\n9\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB   Document 6   Filed 01/26/12   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 29\nhim to sign the forms.\n86. The ACSO neither offered nor provided Mr. Siaki access to effective\ncommunication at the substation.\n87. Mr. Siaki remained at the substation for approximately one hour before being\ntransported to the Adams County Detention Facility (“ACDF”).\n88. For the entirety of his time at the Adams County substation, Mr. Siaki repeatedly\nattempted to convey he was deaf so someone would offer a sign language interpreter.\n89. The Adams County Deputies and staff did not offer or provide him with\nappropriate auxiliary aids and services, including a sign language interpreter.\n90. For the entirety of his time at the Adams County substation, the Adams County\nDeputies and staff did not offer or provide Mr. Siaki with a means by which he could\ncommunicate his need for a sign language interpreter.\n91. Due to ACSO’s failure to offer or provide appropriate auxiliary aids and services,\nMr. Siaki was unable to communicate effectively with anyone while at the substation.\n92. Mr. Siaki was also denied equal access to telecommunications equipment by\nACSO. \n93. Other hearing detainees had access to a telephone to make a call during the\nbooking process.\n94. Mr. Siaki was not provided access to a TDD (telecommunications device for the\ndeaf) on equal terms as hearing inmates were provided access to telephones.\n95. After Mr. Siaki’s arrest, and using the internet-based relay system, My IP Relay,\n10\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB   Document 6   Filed 01/26/12   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 29\nMs. Moore called Adams County inmate information telephone number.\n96. Ms. Moore called the Adams County inmate information telephone number in\norder to determine what was happening to Mr. Siaki.\n97. The individual who answered Ms. Moore’s telephone call, on information and\nbelief, was an ACSO deputy or staff member by the name of Sally Elkerton.\n98. Ms. Elkerton informed Ms. Moore of Mr. Siaki’s charge, and stated that she\nwould be unable to visit him for seven more days.\n99. Ms. Moore then asked Ms. Elkerton when and where Mr. Siaki’s first court\nappearance would be.\n100. After some delay, Ms. Elkerton told Ms. Moore that Mr. Siaki was due in court at\n8:00 a.m. on the following Monday, which was approximately two days away.\n101. Ms. Elkerton told Ms. Moore that court would be convened at the ACDF address\nof 150 North Nineteenth Avenue, not the court address.\n102. Ms. Moore then called the ACSO at (303) 654-1850, also using a relay service\nand spoke with Adams County Detention Specialist Megan Moore.\n103. Ms. Moore asked Detention Specialist Moore about the date, time and location of\nMr. Siaki’s first court appearance.  Detention Specialist Moore told Ms. Moore that the\nappearance would be the following Monday at 8:00 a.m.\n104. Detention Specialist Moore gave Ms. Moore a different address for Mr. Siaki’s\ncourt appearance, which was for the Brighton Justice Center, 1100 Judicial Center Drive,\nBrighton, Colorado 80601.\n11\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB   Document 6   Filed 01/26/12   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 29\n105. Detention Specialist Moore also informed Ms. Moore that a restraining order had\nbeen automatically entered, restraining Mr. Siaki from having contact with Ms. Moore.\n106. Ms. Moore was unaware of the restraining order.\n107. Ms. Moore was extremely concerned about Mr. Siaki’s health and safety.\n108. Ms. Moore felt isolated because, following Mr. Siaki’s arrest, she was left alone\nwith no idea when she would be able to see and communicate with him next.\n109. Upon Mr. Siaki’s arrival at the ACDF, he met with medical intake interviewers\nwho conducted a medical intake.\n110. Mr. Siaki’s disability was readily apparent to the ACSO deputies and staff at the\nACDF, including the medical intake interviewers.\n111. Mr. Siaki attempted to the best of his ability to inform them he was deaf so they\nwould provide a sign language interpreter, but neither the ACSO deputies nor ACSO staff\noffered or provided Mr. Siaki with appropriate auxiliary aids and services, including a sign\nlanguage interpreter.\n112. ACDF staff did not provide Mr. Siaki with a means to communicate his need for\nan interpreter.\n113. Because ACDF staff denied him access to appropriate auxiliary aids and services,\nMr. Siaki was unable to effectively communicate with the ACSO medical intake interviewers,\nand was unable to understand the forms the interviewers gave him.\n114. ACSO staff provided Mr. Siaki with an inmate handbook, which was written in\nEnglish.\n12\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB   Document 6   Filed 01/26/12   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 29\n115. Mr. Siaki was unable to read or understand the inmate handbook in the absence of\nappropriate auxiliary aids and services.\n116. Mr. Siaki was detained at the ACDF for approximately twenty-five days, from\nMay 15, 2010 until June 10, 2010.\n117. Due to the ACSO deputies’ and staff’s failure to provide him with appropriate\nauxiliary aids and services, during Mr. Siaki’s entire detention at the ACDF was he unable to\neffectively communicate with the ACDF deputies or staff.\n118. During his detention, Mr. Siaki did not understand why he was being detained.\n119. During his detention, ACDF staff did not offer or provide auxiliary aids and\nservices for any of the programs, services and activities available to hearing detainees.\n120. On information and belief, the ACSO staff communicated with detainees using\nauditory methods which Mr. Siaki could not hear.\n121. On information and belief, ACSO staff did not make such auditory\ncommunications accessible to Mr. Siaki.\n122. During Ms. Moore’s relay calls to the ACDF, she made clear she was deaf.\n123. When Ms. Moore was finally permitted to visit Mr. Siaki, ACSO staff did not\noffer or provide auxiliary aids and services to facilitate their communication.\n124. Ms. Moore was denied effective communication by Defendant.\n125. Plaintiff Michaelee Owen was arrested on or about November 2, 2011 by the\nFederal Heights Police Department.\n126. On information and belief, the Federal Heights Police transported Mr. Owen to\n13\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB   Document 6   Filed 01/26/12   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of 29\nthe ACDF on or about November 2, 2011.\n127.

ACSO did not offer or provide Mr. Owen an interpreter during the booking\nprocess.\n136. ACSO did not offer or provide Mr. Owen an interpreter during the intake,\nscreening and medical evaluation process.\n137. For the entirety of his detention at the ACDF, Mr. Owen attempted to\ncommunicate that he is deaf so that ACSO Personnel would provide a sign language interpreter,\nbut Defendant’s Personnel did not offer or provide him with a sign language interpreter.\n138. On information and belief, for the entirety of his time at the ACDF, Defendant’s\nPersonnel did not offer or provide Mr. Owen with a means by which he could communicate his\n14\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB   Document 6   Filed 01/26/12   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of 29\nneed for a sign language interpreter.\n139. Due to Defendant’s and Defendant’s Personnel’s failure to provide appropriate\nauxiliary aids and services, Mr. Owen was unable to communicate effectively with anyone while\nat the ACDF.\n140. On information and belief, Defendant and Defendant’s Personnel never provided\nMr. Owen with a qualified sign language interpreter or any other appropriate auxiliary aid or\nservice, thereby denying him effective communication.\n141. Mr. Owen was also denied equal access to telecommunications equipment by\nDefendant and Defendant’s Personnel while at the ACDF.\n142. On information and belief, during his detention at the ACDF, Defendant denied\naccess to a TDD or other telecommunications equipment on his first day of detention.\n143. Later, ACSO Personnel brought Mr. Owen a TTY machine to make a call.\n144. The TTY machine was inoperable.\n145. ACSO Personnel never offered or provided any other access for Mr. Owen to\ncommunicate with anyone outside the ACDF.\n146. Mr. Owen was unable to communicate with anyone outside of the ACDF until his\ncell mate, who was not deaf but who knew some sign language, telephoned Ms. Roybal on his\nbehalf.\n147. Defendant and Defendant’s Personnel denied Mr. Owen effective communication\nfor the entirety of his detention at the ACDF.\n148. Mr. Owen was damaged by Defendant’s unlawful discrimination.\n15\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB   Document 6   Filed 01/26/12   USDC Colorado   Page 16 of 29\n149. Ms. Roybal is Mr. Owen’s aunt and guardian.\n150. Once Ms. Roybal was informed, by Mr. Owen’s cell mate, that Mr. Owen was at\nthe ACDF, she called ACSO Personnel.\n151. ACSO Personnel informed Ms. Roybal that she would not be able to see Mr.\nOwen for several days.\n152. ACSO Personnel provided no means for Ms. Roybal and Mr. Owen to\ncommunicate.\n153. Other hearing inmates had access to telephones during Mr. Owen’s detention.\n154. When Ms. Roybal did visit Mr. Owen, ACSO Personnel asked Ms. Roybal to\ninterpret for Mr. Owen.\n155.

On information and belief, Defendant has never provided a qualified sign\nlanguage interpreter to any deaf individual who has been detained at the ACDF.\n162. In response to a Colorado Criminal Justice Records Act request by the Colorado\nCross-Disability Coalition, Defendant reported that nine detainees identified as deaf were\nbooked at the ACDF from December 2009 to August 2011.\n163. Defendant denies access to auxiliary aids and services for deaf detainees (e.g., a\nTTY or video phone) to communicate with persons outside the ACDF during times when\nhearing detainees are permitted to make telephone calls.\n164. Defendant has no policies informing Defendant’s Personnel about providing\nappropriate auxiliary aids and services to detainees who are deaf or hard of hearing.\n165.

CCDC’s purpose is to promote independence, self-reliance, and full participation\nfor people with all types of disabilities, and to combat discrimination against individuals with\n17\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB   Document 6   Filed 01/26/12   USDC Colorado   Page 18 of 29\ndisabilities, through advocacy, education, research and training.  As a part of that purpose,\nCCDC seeks to ensure that individuals who are deaf and hard-of-hearing have access to -- and do\nnot encounter discrimination in -- participating in government services, including services while\nencountering law enforcement officials, and while being arrested, booked, interrogated, and\ndetained.\n169. CCDC engages in extensive outreach as well as advocacy and educational efforts\nto promote access for and combat discrimination against people with disabilities.  This effort and\nthis purpose have been and continue to be adversely affected by Defendant’s violations of the\nADA and Section 504.\n170. Defendant and Defendant’s Personnel’s actions have caused and continue to\ncause distinct, palpable and perceptible injury to CCDC.  Those injuries include, but are not\nlimited to, those described herein.\n171. CCDC has devoted resources, which could have been devoted to its other\noutreach, advocacy, and educational efforts, to communicating with Defendant in an attempt to\nsecure accessible services, activities and programs.\n172. CCDC has devoted resources, which could have been devoted to its other\noutreach, advocacy, and educational efforts, to educate members and others who have been\ninjured by Defendant’s discrimination.\n173. Defendant’s and discrimination has been and continues to be a barrier to the full\nparticipation of persons with disabilities and, therefore, frustrates CCDC’s ability to achieve full\ninclusion for persons with disabilities.  For example: \n18\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB   Document 6   Filed 01/26/12   USDC Colorado   Page 19 of 29\na. Defendant’s discrimination, in and of itself, denies effective communication to\npeople who are deaf; and,\nb. Defendant’s actions send the message that such discrimination continues to be\nacceptable at this time.\n174. Defendant’s discrimination has required and continues to require CCDC to make\na greater effort -- and to allocate significant resources -- to educate the public that such\ndiscrimination is wrong and otherwise to counteract the adverse impact of such discrimination. \nThis perceptibly impairs CCDC’s counseling, advocacy, educational, and training missions.\n175. CCDC also has devoted and continues to devote resources -- including but not\nlimited to those devoted to the present lawsuit -- to identifying and counteracting the sources of\ndiscrimination in the community, including that of Defendant.\n176. CCDC’s injuries -- including, without limitation, those described herein -- are\ntraceable to Defendant’s discriminatory conduct alleged in this Complaint and will be redressed\nby the relief requested in it.\n177. CCDC’s members include individuals who are deaf and hard of hearing who\nrequire auxiliary aids and services for effective communication. \n178. CCDC’s members have been injured and will continue to be injured by\nDefendant’s discrimination described above.\n179. The elimination of discrimination, such as that of Defendant, is at the core of\nCCDC’s organizational purpose.\n180. The participation of individual CCDC members in the lawsuit is not required\n19\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB   Document 6   Filed 01/26/12   USDC Colorado   Page 20 of 29\neither to resolve the claims at issue or to formulate relief.  \n181. CAD’s purpose is to protect the rights of the deaf individuals and their families,\nto empower deaf individuals to exercise self-determination and independence, and to advocate\nfor equal opportunities in social, educational, and employment opportunities in Colorado.  As a\npart of that purpose, CAD seeks to ensure that deaf individuals and individuals who are hard-of-\nhearing have access to -- and do not encounter discrimination in -- participating in government\nservices, including services while encountering law enforcement officials, and while being\narrested, booked, interrogated, and detained.\n182. CAD engages in extensive outreach as well as advocacy and educational efforts to\npromote access for and combat discrimination against deaf individuals.  This effort and this\npurpose have been and continue to be adversely affected by Defendant’s violations of the ADA\nand Section 504.\n183. Defendant’s and Defendant’s Personnel’s actions have caused and continue to\ncause distinct, palpable and perceptible injury to CAD.  Those injuries include, but are not\nlimited to, those described herein.\n184. CAD has devoted resources, which could have been devoted to its other outreach,\nadvocacy, and educational efforts, to educate members and others who have been injured by\nDefendant’s discrimination.\n185. Defendant’s discrimination has been and continues to be a barrier to the full\nparticipation of deaf individuals and, therefore, frustrates CAD’s ability to achieve full inclusion\nfor deaf individuals.  For example: \n20\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB   Document 6   Filed 01/26/12   USDC Colorado   Page 21 of 29\na. Defendant’s discrimination, in and of itself, denies effective communication to\ndeaf individuals; and\nb. Defendant’s actions send the message that such discrimination continues to be\nacceptable at this time.\n186. Defendant’s discrimination has required and continues to require CAD to make a\ngreater effort -- and to allocate significant resources -- to educate the public that such\ndiscrimination is wrong and otherwise to counteract the adverse impact of such discrimination. \nThis perceptibly impairs CAD’s counseling, advocacy, educational, and training missions.\n187. CAD also has devoted and continues to devote resources -- including but not\nlimited to those devoted to the present lawsuit -- to identifying and counteracting the sources of\ndiscrimination in the community, including that of Defendant.\n188. CAD’s injuries -- including, without limitation, those described herein -- are\ntraceable to Defendant’s discriminatory conduct alleged in this Amended Complaint and will be\nredressed by the relief requested in it.\n189. CAD’s members include deaf individuals who require auxiliary aids and services\nfor effective communication. \n190. CAD’s members have been injured and will continue to be injured by\nDefendant’s discrimination described above.\n191. The elimination of discrimination, such as that of Defendant, is at the core of\nCAD’s organizational purpose.\n192. The participation of individual CAD members in the lawsuit is not required either\n21\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB   Document 6   Filed 01/26/12   USDC Colorado   Page 22 of 29\nto resolve the claims at issue or to formulate relief.  \nFirst Claim for Relief\n(Violations of the ADA)\n193.

Martínez \n \nCivil Action No. 20-cv-1268-WJM \n \nLORENA GARCIA, \nLORENA FOR COLORADO, \n \n  Plaintiffs, \n \nv. \n \nJENA GRISWOLD, Colorado Secretary of State, in her official capacity, \n \n  Defendant. \n \n \nAMENDED ORDER DENYING PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n \n \nBefore the Court is Plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and \nPreliminary Injunction (“Motion”) (ECF No. 7), asking the Court to order Colorado \nSecretary of State Jena Griswold (“Secretary”) to place Plaintiff Garcia on the primary \nelection ballot as a Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate.  Plaintiffs brought this motion \non May 6, 2020, which was the same day that the Secretary was required to certify the \nballot.  At 6:15 PM on May 7, 2020, the Court issued a four-page summary order \ndenying the Motion, stating that “a detailed written order [will follow] in due course.”  \n(ECF No. 12 at 1.)  This is that order. \nAlthough the May 7 deadline and primary election have passed, this Order is \nentered nunc pro tunc to May 7, 2020, so that the Order accurately reflects the \ncircumstances facing the Court at the time that it ruled.  For the reasons explained \nbelow, Plaintiffs’ Motion is denied. \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01268-WJM-STV   Document 30   Filed 08/21/20   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 12\nI.  LEGAL STANDARD \n“A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish [1] that he is likely to \nsucceed on the merits, [2] that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \npreliminary relief, [3] that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and [4] that an \ninjunction is in the public interest.”  Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  The \nstandard is even more strict for a “disfavored” injunction: \n[A] disfavored injunction may exhibit any of three \ncharacteristics: (1) it mandates action (rather than prohibiting \nit), (2) it changes the status quo, or (3) it grants all the relief \nthat the moving party could expect from a trial win.  To get a \ndisfavored injunction, the moving party faces a heavier \nburden on the likelihood-of-success-on-the-merits and the \nbalance-of-harms factors: She must make a strong showing \nthat these tilt in her favor. \nFree the Nipple-Fort Collins v. City of Fort Collins, 916 F.3d 792, 797 (10th Cir. 2019) \n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \nPlaintiffs seek at least an injunction changing the status quo, i.e., “the last \npeaceable uncontested status existing between the parties before the dispute \ndeveloped.”  Id. at 798 n.3 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Accordingly, Plaintiffs \nmust make a strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits and that the balance \nof harms tips in their favor.  Plaintiffs cannot make either showing. \nII.  STATUTORY FRAMEWORK \nIn Colorado, a U.S. Senate candidate may seek placement on the primary \nelection ballot through, among other methods, a petition for nomination “signed by at \nleast one thousand five hundred eligible electors in each congressional district.”  Colo. \nRev. Stat. § 1-4-801(2)(c)(II).  Regarding its electoral laws generally (i.e., without \nreference specifically to the signatures-per-district requirement), Colorado says that \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01268-WJM-STV   Document 30   Filed 08/21/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 12\n“[s]ubstantial compliance with the provisions or intent of [the electoral] code shall be all \nthat is required for the proper conduct of an election to which this code applies.”  Id. § 1-\n1-103(3). \nIII.  BACKGROUND \nThe following timeline is undisputed, save for facts attributed specifically to \nPlaintiffs (e.g., “Plaintiffs say that . . .”).  The Court draws some of this information from \nthe Colorado Supreme Court’s opinion resolving a lawsuit brought by Michelle Ferrigno \nWarren, another U.S. Senate candidate who faced challenges obtaining the required \nnumber of signatures as the COVID-19 pandemic set in.  See Griswold v. Ferrigno \nWarren, 462 P.3d 1081 (Colo. 2020) (“Ferrigno Warren”). \nJanuary 21.1  First day that U.S. Senate candidates can collect signatures.  \n(¶ 37.)2 \nJanuary 21 through first week of March.  Plaintiffs’ volunteers collect \nsignatures with no evident problems.  (¶¶ 38–48.) \nMarch 5.  Colorado officials announce the first two positive cases of COVID-19 in \nthe state.  (¶ 50.) \nMarch 10.  Governor Jared Polis declares a state of emergency due to COVID-\n19.  (¶ 51.) \nMarch 10 through March 16.  Plaintiffs’ signature-gathering efforts are \nsignificantly hampered by COVID-19.  Many volunteers choose not to go out and collect \nsignatures, and many potential signatories are no longer willing to open their doors, talk \n \n1 All dates are in the current year, 2020. \n2 All “¶” citations, without more, are to the Complaint (ECF No. 1). \n3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01268-WJM-STV   Document 30   Filed 08/21/20   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 12\nto volunteers on the streets, etc.  (¶¶ 54–75.) \nMarch 17. \n— Deadline to submit signatures to the Secretary.  (¶ 41.) \n— Plaintiffs submit their signatures to the Secretary.  Plaintiffs’ “gross” number of \nsignatures (i.e., before the Secretary evaluates signatures for validity) is more than \n1,500 signatures in Congressional Districts 1, 2, 3, and 7, but fewer than 1,500 in the \nother districts.  (¶ 76.)  Plaintiffs say they did not know how many gross signatures they \nhad at this point in any district.  (ECF No. 17 at 1–3.) \n— Ferrigno Warren, another U.S. Senate candidate who did not gather the \nrequired number of signatures per congressional district, files a lawsuit in Colorado \nstate court (specifically, Denver District Court), arguing that her efforts amounted to \n“substantial compliance” in light of COVID-19, and so the Secretary should be ordered \nto place her name on the ballot.  Ferrigno Warren, 462 P.3d at 1082–83. \nMarch 25.  Governor Polis issues a statewide “stay at home” order.  (¶ 53.) \nApril 14.  According to Plaintiffs, they receive from the Secretary, “for the first \ntime, . . . specific numbers for how many reviewable signatures [they] had submitted, as \nwell as the numbers for each of the Congressional Districts.”  (ECF No. 17 at 3.) \nApril 16.  The Denver District Court holds a hearing on Ferrigno Warren’s \nrequest that the Secretary be ordered to place her name on the ballot.  The Secretary \nconcedes that “substantial compliance” was the appropriate standard, even for \nnumerical thresholds such as signatures per congressional district.  The Secretary \nproposes “a mathematical ‘discount-rate’ formula for determining substantial compliance \nthat could be applied to evaluate not only Ferrigno Warren’s signature collection efforts, \n4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01268-WJM-STV   Document 30   Filed 08/21/20   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 12\nbut also those of the other candidates whose signature collections may have been \nhampered by the COVID-19 pandemic.”  Ferrigno Warren, 462 P.3d at 1083.  In brief, \nthe Secretary’s proposal would have lowered the 1,500-signature threshold based on \nthe number of days in which COVID-19 made signature-gathering less effective or \nimpossible.  Id.  Under the Secretary’s formula, Ferrigno Warren would not have been in \nsubstantial compliance.  Id. \nApril 20.  Plaintiffs receive an “insufficiency notice” from the Secretary, showing \nfewer than 1,500 valid signatures in five of Colorado’s seven congressional districts.  \n(¶¶ 76–77.) \nApril 21.  The Denver District Court issues its order in the Ferrigno Warren \ndispute.  The court rejects the Secretary’s discount-rate approach, holds that Ferrigno \nWarren had substantially complied (under a different standard), and orders the \nSecretary to put her name on the ballot.  Ferrigno Warren, 462 P.3d at 1084. \nApril 24. \n— Plaintiffs sue in Denver District Court, arguing for the same relief granted to \nFerrigno Warren.  (¶ 77.) \n— The Secretary appeals the Denver District Court’s decision regarding Ferrigno \nWarren directly to the Colorado Supreme Court.  Ferrigno Warren, 462 P.3d at 1084. \nApril 29–30.  The Denver District Court holds a hearing regarding Plaintiffs’ \nlawsuit.  (¶¶ 79–80.) \nApril 30.  The Denver District Court rules that Plaintiffs had substantially \ncomplied with the signature requirement, and orders the Secretary to place Plaintiff \nGarcia on the ballot.  (¶ 81.) \n5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01268-WJM-STV   Document 30   Filed 08/21/20   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 12\nMay 4, 2020. \n  — The Colorado Supreme Court reverses the Denver District Court’s decision \nregarding Ferrigno Warren, holding (contrary to the Secretary’s position) that the 1,500-\nsignatures-per-congressional-district threshold is a strict requirement that may not be \nrelaxed through a “substantial compliance” analysis.  Ferrigno Warren, 462 P.3d at \n1084–86. \n  — The Secretary appeals the Denver District Court’s decision in Plaintiffs’ case.  \n(¶ 83.) \nMay 5.  The Colorado Supreme Court reverses the Denver District Court’s \ndecision in Plaintiffs’ case.  (¶ 84.) \nMay 6.  Plaintiffs file this lawsuit.  (ECF No. 1.) \nMay 7.  Deadline for the Secretary to certify the ballot.  (¶ 85.) \nMay 16.  County clerks must mail ballots to overseas servicemembers, as \nrequired by the federal Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, \n52 U.S.C. § 20302(a)(8)(A). \nIV.  ANALYSIS \nA.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n1.  Laches \nPlaintiffs have not made a strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits \nbecause they have not made a strong showing that they can overcome the Secretary’s \nequitable defense of laches.  “Laches requires proof of (1) lack of diligence by the party \nagainst whom the defense is asserted, and (2) prejudice to the party asserting the \ndefense.”  Costello v. United States, 365 U.S. 265, 282 (1961). \n6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01268-WJM-STV   Document 30   Filed 08/21/20   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 12\na.  Lack of Diligence \nThe diligence in question here is not when Plaintiffs commenced this lawsuit, but \nwhen Plaintiffs commenced a state-court lawsuit, seeking a “substantial compliance” \nruling.  A ruling against Plaintiffs in such a lawsuit is a prerequisite to a federal \nconstitutional claim that Colorado’s ballot-access laws are unconstitutionally strict. \nStated slightly differently, what Plaintiffs want from this Court is a ruling that the \nConstitution requires Colorado, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, to put a candidate \non the ballot if the candidate has substantially complied (in some constitutional sense) \nwith ballot access requirements.3  But because Colorado already has a statutory \nsubstantial compliance standard, a federal claim seeking constitutional substantial \ncompliance is unripe until a state-court lawsuit arguing statutory substantial compliance \nfails (either because the court rules that the candidate is not in substantial compliance, \nor because—as in this case—the Colorado Supreme Court rules that substantial \ncompliance cannot excuse explicit numerical requirements).  Thus, under the \ncircumstances, the diligence necessary to avoid the defense of laches necessarily \nincludes filing the predicate state-court lawsuit. \nPlaintiffs submitted their signature packets to the Secretary on March 17.  Those \nsignature packets were deficient as to Congressional Districts 4–6, even if every \nsignature was valid.  In other words, as of March 17, Plaintiffs knew (or should have \nknown) that they would need a substantial compliance ruling in state court.  Unlike \n \n3 Plaintiffs do not argue that a 1,500-signatures-per-congressional-district requirement is \nfacially unconstitutional, nor that collecting signatures should be completely excused under the \ncircumstances.  Thus, Plaintiffs are necessarily arguing for a constitutional substantial \ncompliance standard—a candidate must try to gather the needed signatures, and then some \nstandard rooted in the Constitution compels Colorado to pronounce those efforts good enough. \n7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01268-WJM-STV   Document 30   Filed 08/21/20   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 12\nFerrigno Warren, they did not commence a substantial compliance lawsuit until April 24.  \nPlaintiffs therefore did not display the diligence required to defeat a defense of laches. \nPlaintiffs claim, however, that they did not know until April 14 that they had failed \nto gather enough signatures in Congressional Districts 4–6.  This is frankly incredible.  \nPlaintiffs provide detailed allegations about their signature-collecting efforts both before \nand after the COVID-19 pandemic began to affect Colorado, including statistics about \nrate of signature collection and numbers of signatures collected on specific days or at \nspecific events.  (¶¶ 38–48, 54–74.)  Plaintiffs presumably intend to prove these \nallegations are true.  If they succeed in so proving, it is very difficult to believe that \nPlaintiffs were “flying blind,” so to speak, with no idea where the signature-gathering \neffort stood in each congressional district. \nHowever, even if the Court accepts Plaintiffs’ claim that they did not know of the \ndeficiency until April 14, the Court would still find lack of diligence.  Given the highly \ncompressed deadlines at issue here, every hour matters.  As of April 14 at the latest, \nPlaintiffs knew they would need to file a substantial compliance lawsuit in state court.  \nThey waited another ten days, which was precious time under the circumstances.  \nThus, Plaintiffs displayed a lack of diligence. \nb.  Prejudice to the Secretary \n“Ballots and elections do not magically materialize.  They require planning, \npreparation, and studious attention to detail if the fairness and integrity of the electoral \nprocess is to be observed.”  Perry v. Judd, 471 F. App’x 219, 226 (4th Cir. 2012).  The \nSecretary’s assertions that ballot-printing is a complex and time-sensitive process stand \nunrebutted.  (See ECF No. 8 at 13–15.)  A ruling in Plaintiffs’ favor at this late hour \nwould throw this process into disarray, not only because the Secretary would need to \n8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01268-WJM-STV   Document 30   Filed 08/21/20   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 12\naccommodate Plaintiff Garcia, but because it would call into question whether every \nother candidate claiming a similar impediment should also be placed on the ballot.  This \ncould potentially jeopardize the federal statutory deadline to mail ballots to overseas \nservicemembers.  Accordingly, the Secretary has been prejudiced by Plaintiffs’ lack of \ndiligence. \nFor these reasons, Plaintiffs are not strongly likely to succeed on the merits \nbecause the Secretary is likely to succeed in proving a laches defense.  Cf. Perry, \nsupra; Dobson v. Dunlap, 576 F. Supp. 2d 181, 187 (D. Me. 2008) (applying laches in a \nsimilar situation). \nc.  Other Cases Distinguishable \nPlaintiffs say that the relief they seek is supported by cases from elsewhere \ngranting similarly urgent relief in light of COVID-19.  (ECF No. 7 at 23.)  The Court finds \nthese cases inapposite. \nIn Esshaki v. Whitmer, ___ F. Supp. 3d ___, 2020 WL 1910154 (E.D. Mich. Apr. \n20, 2020), the deadline at issue was an April 21 deadline to submit signatures in \nadvance of an August 4 primary election.  Id. at *1.  Moreover, in that case, “the State \nconceded at oral argument that the signature-gathering due date could be moved back \nto May 8, 2020 without significant impairment of the State’s interests.”  Id. at *7.  The \ncircumstances in Esshaki are not comparable to those before this Court. \nIn Garbett v. Herbert, ___ F. Supp. 3d ___, 2020 WL 2064101 (D. Utah Apr. 29, \n2020), the deadline at issue was an April 13 deadline to submit signatures.  Id. at *1.  \nThe plaintiff filed her lawsuit the same day, and the ballot certification deadline was April \n29.  Id. at *1–4.  Moreover, the plaintiff had been seeking administrative redress from \nthe relevant state officers for weeks before April 13.  See id.  Thus, the circumstances in \n9 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01268-WJM-STV   Document 30   Filed 08/21/20   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 12\nGarbett are also not comparable to those before this Court. \nIn Libertarian Party of Illinois v. Pritzker, ___ F. Supp. 3d ___, 2020 WL 1951687 \n(N.D. Ill. Apr. 23, 2020), the deadline at issue was a June 22 deadline to submit \nsignatures for non-major-party candidates hoping to appear on the general election \nballot.  Id. at *1–2.  Moreover, “the ‘window’ for gathering such signatures opened at \nnearly the same time that Governor Pritzker first imposed restrictions [due to COVID-\n19].”  Id. at *4.  Thus, the circumstances in Libertarian Party of Illinois are not at all \ncomparable to those before this Court. \n2.  No Substantial Compliance Under a Constitutional Standard \nPlaintiffs do not explain what sort of compliance is substantial enough for \nconstitutional purposes, such that the Constitution requires Colorado to deem Plaintiffs’ \nefforts good enough under the circumstances.  Whatever that standard is (assuming it \nexists), Plaintiffs have not made a strong showing of likelihood of success. \nPlaintiffs allege, at most, that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly limited their \nability to obtain signatures beginning in roughly the last week before the March 17, 2020 \nsubmission deadline, subsequent to Governor Polis’s state of emergency declaration on \nMarch 10, 2020.  And Plaintiffs were counting on canvassing at events very close to the \ndeadline, such as the March 14 St. Patrick’s Day parade in Denver (which was \ncancelled due to COVID-19).  (¶ 72.)  Taking such risks—specifically counting on the \nsignatures expected to be gathered in the last few days before the deadline—does not \nshow substantial compliance.  Thus, assuming a constitutional substantial compliance \nstandard exists, Plaintiffs have not shown a strong likelihood of success that they \nsatisfied it. \n10 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01268-WJM-STV   Document 30   Filed 08/21/20   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 12\nB.  Balance of Harms & Public Interest \nIn analyzing whether a preliminary injunction should issue against the \ngovernment, the balance-of-harms and public-interest elements of the preliminary \ninjunction test are treated together.  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009).  For \nessentially the same reasons stated in Part IV.A.1.b, above, these factors tip in the \nSecretary’s favor, not Plaintiffs’.  At this very late hour, the Secretary’s interest in \nensuring that ballots are timely printed outweighs even a meritorious claim under the \nConstitution. \nMoreover, “[c]ourt orders affecting elections, especially conflicting orders, can \nthemselves result in voter confusion and consequent incentive to remain away from the \npolls.”  Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S. 1, 4–5 (2006).  If the Court were to grant the relief \nPlaintiffs seek, there would be “conflicting orders”: one from the Colorado Supreme \nCourt saying that Plaintiff Garcia must not be on the ballot, and one from this Court \nsaying that she must be on the ballot.  Although the Colorado Supreme Court was \ninterpreting Colorado election law and this Court would be interpreting the Constitution, \nthe average voter is unlikely to pick up on that distinction. \nFor these reasons, Plaintiffs have not made the necessary showing under the \nbalance-of-harms and public-interest elements of the preliminary injunction test. \nV.  CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining \nOrder and Preliminary Injunction (ECF No. 7) is DENIED. \n \n   \n11 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-01268-WJM-STV   Document 30   Filed 08/21/20   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 12\nDated this 21st day of August, 2020, nunc pro tunc to the 7th day of May, 2020. \n \n \nBY THE COURT: \n \n \n \n______________________ \nWilliam J.
