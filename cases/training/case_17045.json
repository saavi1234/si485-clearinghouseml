Plaintiffs in these related cases acknowledge that the new Proclamation's requirements, if carried out by the government, may remedy the harms plaintiffs have alleged in these cases. See Emami Dkt. Nos. 173, 175. The Court consequently finds it appropriate to stay these cases, terminate the pending discovery disputes, and administratively close the cases, pending further developments.

Defendants' request to dismiss the cases as moot is denied without prejudice, as the Court finds the request is not sufficiently supported by the record at this point. Plaintiffs may file their motion for summary judgment whenever they wish to do so, and the parties are directed to meet and confer on a briefing schedule. The briefing must be coordinated and streamlined as between the two related cases; duplicative briefs will not be accepted. Defendants may renew any mootness arguments in their opposition to plaintiffs' summary judgment motion, as warranted. The parties are further directed to file a stipulation of dismissal for those petitioner-plaintiffs as to whom the parties agree there is no live controversy. See Dkt. No. 89-1. Signed by Judge James Donato on 3/15/2022. (This is a text-only entry generated by the court. There is no document associated with this entry.)

    "summary": "<p>This is one of many legal challenges to the series of Trump's executive orders (EOs) known collectively as the \"Travel Ban\" or \"Muslim Ban.\" This suit in particular challenged the waiver system that accompanied the ban, which was purportedly instated to prevent the EOs from arbitrarily denying people entry into the country.</p>\r\n<p>Twenty six individuals who had been denied a travel visa, or whose relatives had been denied a travel visa as a result of the EOs, filed this putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (in San Francisco) on March 13, 2018. District Judge James Donato was assigned to the case. The plaintiffs sued the President; the U.S. Attorney General; the Department of Justice; the Secretary and Department of Homeland Security; the Secretary of State and the State Department; and the Director of National Intelligence along with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Plaintiffs brought this case against defendants under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), alleging defendants violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The plaintiffs, represented by the Immigrant Advocacy and Litigation Center, Public Counsel, and private counsel, sought injunctive and declaratory relief.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs alleged that the Trump Administration's failure to grant visas to individuals because of their nationality was unconstitutional. They argued the resulting separation of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents from their families was in contravention of Congress' purpose in the INA&mdash;promoting family reunification. Therefore, the government's actions amounted to an arbitrary and capricious act in violation of the APA.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs also argued that the government's refusal to consider applicants' eligibility for waivers on a case-by-case basis or develop meaningful guidance was, as a matter of law, arbitrary and capricious and therefore a violation of the APA. The plaintiffs further alleged that the government targeted individuals with discriminatory intent based on national origin without any lawful justification in violation of the Due Process and Equal Protection guarantees of the Fifth Amendment. First, the plaintiffs cited the lack of a provision for waivers coupled with the government&rsquo;s blanket denials of visas to applicants targeted by EOs. Second, the plaintiffs cited statements made by government officials concerning their intent and the application of the travel ban. As a result, the plaintiffs asked the court to order the government to consider the plaintiffs' eligibility for waivers.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs requested the certification of two classes: \"Family Member Class\" and \"Visa Applicant Class.\" The Family Member Class was defined as US citizens and permanent residents \"with approved family-based visa petitions or whose family members have applied for visa categories covered by the ban, and whose family members have been or will be refused pursuant to the Proclamation without an opportunity to apply for and be meaningfully considered for a waiver or are awaiting adjudication of a waiver.\" The Visa Applicant Class is defined as \"Iranian, Libyan, Somali, Syrian, and Yemeni nationals who have applied for immigrant or nonimmigrant visas that have been or will be refused pursuant to the Proclamation without an opportunity to apply for and be meaningfully considered for a waiver or are awaiting adjudication of a waiver.\"</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint on July 29, 2018, and the government moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim on September 12, 2018. On February 4, 2019, the court denied the motion to dismiss for the APA claim and granted the motion for the Fifth Amendment and mandamus claims. For the Fifth Amendment due process claim, the court held that the plaintiffs failed to allege any constitutionally protected right for either plaintiff class. The court found that the equal protection claim assumed the EOs unconstitutionally excluded Muslims or illegally discriminated on the basis of nationality, but that the Supreme Court had already decided that these travel orders passed rational basis review in <em>Trump v. Hawaii</em>. Based on this precedent, the district court held that the government&rsquo;s national security justification for the EOs was sufficient to stand against an equal protection challenge. Lastly, the court dismissed the mandamus claim because the APA claim would go forward and therefore plaintiffs would not have exhausted all other avenues for relief to make a writ of mandamus appropriate. 365 F. Supp. 3d 1009.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint on February 23, 2019. On February 26, 2019, the government moved to consolidate this case with <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16712\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Pars Equality Center v. Pompeo</em></a>. After oral argument on April 11, 2019, the court denied the motion and decided to allow both cases to proceed, ordering the parties to work together to minimize duplication between the two cases.</p>\r\n<p>In response to the second amended complaint, the government filed a motion to dismiss or obtain summary judgment on June 13, 2019. The motion argued the complaint should be dismissed for failure to state an actionable claim and that the existing waiver process was &ldquo;not a sham&rdquo; but rather an adequate procedure for the handling of thousands of visa applications.</p>\r\n<p>A contentious period of discovery ensued throughout the rest of 2019 and into 2020. During this time, two plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims on October 30, 2019.</p>\r\n<p>On June 5, 2020, the court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss following the same reasoning and outcome from the February 4, 2019, order that addressed the first amended complaint. The motion to dismiss was denied for the APA claim and granted for the Fifth Amendment and mandamus claims. In addition, the court denied summary judgment and denied the opportunity for another round of pleading amendments. 365 F. Supp. 3d. 1009.</p>\r\n<p>Discovery continued through 2020. But the EOs at issue were revoked by Joe Biden on his first day in office, January 20, 2021. This revocation was announced by way of <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/25/2021-01749/ending-discriminatory-bans-on-entry-to-the-united-states\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Proclamation 10141</a> which also ordered the State Department to resume processing visa applications from people affected by the EOs. The Proclamation instructed the Secretary of State to provide a report including the number of visa applicants being considered for a waiver of the Travel Ban EOs&rsquo; restrictions, a plan for &ldquo;expeditiously adjudicating&rdquo; these applications, a proposal to ensure the reconsideration of denied applications under the revoked EOs, and a plan to ensure that the cases of re-applicants were not to be prejudiced as a result of a previous visa denial resulting from the revoked EOs.</p>\r\n<p>This change in executive policy prompted mootness rulings and withdrawals of claims in other actions arising out of the implementation of the EOs. On February 11, 2021, the government filed a notice to the district court informing it of two mootness rulings issued by the Ninth and Sixth Circuits on appeals from travel ban litigation following Biden&rsquo;s inauguration day proclamation. (One of the cases they cited in this notice, <em>Arab American Civil Rights League v. Trump</em>, can be found <a href=\"../../../../case/15612/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> in the Clearinghouse.) In addition to notifying the court of these appellate decisions, the government asked the district court to dismiss the case.</p>\r\n<p>Instead of dismissing the lawsuit on March 23, 2020, the court stayed proceedings pending DHS&rsquo; execution of President Biden&rsquo;s January 20 Proclamation. The court also directed the parties to file a joint status update by June 7, 2021.</p>\r\n<p>The parties filed their joint update on June 7, 2021. In the update, the parties explained why they had not reached a settlement. The plaintiffs claimed, among other things, that following the January 20 proclamation, the government invited them to reapply for visas, denying them the benefit of their earlier application date. On the other side, the government claimed that because the Proclamation undid the EOs that were the source of the harm experienced by the plaintiffs, that there was no live case or controversy for the district court to adjudicate.</p>\r\n<p>On June 16, 2021, District Judge Donato set a status conference for September 2, 2021. The plaintiffs moved to lift the stay of proceedings on July 13, 2021, and the government filed its opposition to this motion on July 27, 2021. &nbsp;On September 2, the court held a status conference and, on October 4, the parties filed a joint submission outlining their respective stances regarding which plaintiff's still had live claims.</p>\r\n<p>On March 15, 2022, the court ordered that this case and <em>Pars Equality Center</em> be reopened. Defendants' request to dismiss the cases for mootness was denied without prejudice because of the application date issue raised by the plaintiffs. The parties were also instructed to file a stipulation of dismissal for any plaintiffs whom the parties agreed were not involved in any live controversy.</p>\r\n<p>The case is ongoing.</p>",

Reg. 45161 (2017) (the “Proclamation”).  The \n21  Proclamation sharply curtailed, and in some cases completely suspended, entry into the United \n22  States by nationals of Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, Yemen and Somalia.  Id. \n23  at 45162, 45165-67.1  Plaintiffs focus on nationals of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, and \n24  challenge the government’s handling of a waiver program that would allow exceptions for entry \n25  into the United States in certain circumstances.  The gravamen of the complaints is that the \n26 \n27 \n \n1 The restrictions on nationals of Chad have been lifted.  Presidential Proclamation No. 9723, 83 \n28 \nFed. Reg. 15937 (Apr. 10, 2018). \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 152   Filed 06/05/20   Page 2 of 10\n \n1  government created guidance for waivers which it has systematically ignored to deny the vast \n2  majority of waiver applications.   \n3  The Court granted in part and denied in part a motion to dismiss in the Emami case with \n4  leave to amend, finding that plaintiffs had plausibly stated a claim under the Accardi doctrine.  \n5  Dkt. No. 74 (Emami) at 16.  The heart of this claim was that “the State Department has acted \n6  arbitrarily and unlawfully by disregarding its own procedures and rules in administering the \n7  waiver program” established by the Proclamation.  Id. at 14.  The Emami plaintiffs filed a second \n8  amended complaint.  Dkt. No. 75 (Emami).  As the Emami motion to dismiss proceedings were \n9  under way, the Pars case was transferred here from the Western District of Washington.  Dkt. No. \n10  80 (Pars).  The operative complaint in that case remains the initial complaint.  Dkt. No. 1 (Pars).  \n11  Defendants have filed motions to dismiss, or to obtain summary judgment for, the second \n12  amended complaint in Emami and the complaint in Pars.  Dkt. No. 98 (Emami); Dkt. No. 120 \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  (Pars).  This order resolves those motions.   \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  DISCUSSION \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  The parties’ familiarity with the record is assumed.  The prior dismissal order provides a \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  detailed statement of the case and plaintiffs’ claims, and the governing standards for a motion to \nS d nr\nee 17  dismiss.  Dkt. No. 74 (Emami).   \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  I.  MOTIONS TO DISMISS \n19  A.  Pars Complaint \n20  The Court has not been called upon to review the plausibility of the Pars complaint until \n21  now.  The analysis of the Emami complaint in the dismissal order applies in full measure here, and \n22  streamlines the discussion. \n23  1.  Justiciability \n24  The Court squarely answered the government’s justiciability objection in Emami.  \n25  Dismissal for lack of a justiciable controversy was denied because the Emami plaintiffs are not \n26  suing over “individual consular officer decisions on the merits . . . [or] the outcome of any \n27  particular consular officer’s decision in a given case.”  Dkt. No. 74 (Emami) at 11-12.  They are \n28  “challenging systemic practices with respect to the waiver program, and not individualized \n2 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 152   Filed 06/05/20   Page 3 of 10\n \n1  determinations for any specific person.”  Id. at 12.  So too in the Pars complaint.  See Dkt. No. 1 \n2  (Pars); Dkt. No. 125 (Pars) at 6 (“Plaintiffs do not seek review of any individual, discretionary \n3  decision by a consular officer,” rather, “they seek review of the policies and practices that \n4  Defendants have adopted to implement the Proclamation”).  This is a justiciable controversy \n5  properly before the Court.   \n6  2.  APA Claim \n7  Defendants’ request to dismiss the APA claim in Pars is denied.  Defendants say that the \n8  APA does not apply at all.  Dkt. No. 120 (Pars) at 9-10.  But as the Court has already determined, \n9  the Administrative Procedure Act “creates a ‘basic presumption of judicial review for one \n10  suffering legal wrong because of agency action,’” and our circuit has construed the APA “to \n11  provide for ‘broad judicial review of agency action.’”  Dkt. No. 74 (Emami) at 13 (quoting \n12  Weyerhaeuser Co. v. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Serv., 139 S.Ct. 361, 370 (2018), and Regents of the \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Univ. of Cal. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 908 F.3d 476, 494 (9th Cir. 2018)).  Agency action \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  is not immunized from review just because it might be linked to a Presidential Proclamation.  See \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 932 F.3d 742, 770 (9th Cir. 2018) (“insofar as DOJ and \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  DHS have incorporated the Proclamation by reference into the Rule, we may consider the validity \nS d nr\nee 17  of the agency’s proposed action, including its ‘rule . . . or the equivalent’”); Chamber of \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Commerce of the U.S. v. Reich, 74 F.3d 1322, 1326 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (“agency regulations that \n19  implement an executive order are reviewable under the APA”). \n20  The Pars complaint is based on a final agency action properly subject to judicial review.  \n21  Defendants say that plaintiffs have “fail[ed] . . . to direct their complaint against any ‘final agency \n22  action,’” Dkt. No. 128 (Pars) at 2-3, but that is not a fair characterization of plaintiffs’ complaint.  \n23  The Pars plaintiffs have identified, and are challenging, a final agency action consisting of “the \n24  ‘worldwide guidance’ referenced in the State Department’s February 22 letter and the State \n25  Department guidance, cables, sample Q’s & A’s and instructions referenced in the Richardson \n26  declaration,” along with other actions taken by defendants in reliance of Section 3(c) of the \n27  Proclamation.  Dkt. No. 1 (Pars) ¶¶ 279-80.  Plaintiffs further allege that these actions resulted in \n28  a waiver process in which, among other things, “visa applicants have been denied waivers without \n3 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 152   Filed 06/05/20   Page 4 of 10\n \n1  ever having received notice of a waiver process, and/or have been denied waivers without ever \n2  having had a consular interview or other opportunity to provide evidence of their eligibility for a \n3  waiver, in contravention of 22 C.F.R. §§ 41.121 and 42.81, which state that when refusing the \n4  issuance of a visa, a consular officer must inform the visa applicant ‘whether there is, in law or \n5  regulations, a mechanism (such as a waiver) to overcome the refusal.’”  Id. ¶ 281 (quoting 22 \n6  C.F.R. § 41.121(b)(1)).  Plaintiffs also allege that the government has implemented a waiver \n7  process in which “consular officers do not have discretion over whether and when to grant a \n8  waiver, and thus no discretion over whether they may grant a visa to an individual subject to the \n9  Proclamation, in contravention of the Proclamation itself as well as 8 U.S.C. § 1104(a), which \n10  states that consular officers have complete discretion over the issuance of visas and that such \n11  discretion may not be circumscribed by the Secretary of State.”  Id. ¶ 284.   \n12  Defendants suggest that “the Proclamation [is] the only relevant source of law in this \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  case,” Dkt. No. 128 (Pars) at 2-3, but plaintiffs have identified a number of legal tests with which \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  to assay the government’s conduct, and defendants have not demonstrated that plaintiffs have \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  missed the mark.  In effect, plaintiffs are following Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S.Ct. 2392, 2408 \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  (2018), where the Supreme Court measured the Proclamation against the provisions of the \nS d nr\nee 17  Immigration and Nationality Act, even after finding that the President had lawfully exercised his \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  “broad discretion to suspend the entry of aliens into the United States” under § 1182(f) of that \n19  statute.  See Hawaii, 138 S.Ct. at 2411 (“We may assume that § 1182(f) does not allow the \n20  President to expressly override particular provisions of the INA.  But plaintiffs have not identified \n21  any conflict between the statute and the Proclamation”).  In this case, plaintiffs have plausibly \n22  alleged conflicts between the government’s actions, 22 C.F.R. §§ 41.121 and 42.81, the \n23  Proclamation, and 8 U.S.C. § 1104(a).  Defendants effectively concede the point by sidestepping \n24  the conflict allegations with factual arguments, such as “each Plaintiff received exactly what the \n25  regulations require,” Dkt. No. 120 (Pars) at 11, and “Plaintiffs are wrong that consular officers are \n26  denied discretion to grant waivers,” Dkt. No. 128 (Pars) at 7. \n27  The Court also declines to dismiss at this juncture plaintiffs’ allegation that defendants’ \n28  implementation of the waiver provision violated the APA’s notice-and-comment requirements.  \n4 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 152   Filed 06/05/20   Page 5 of 10\n \n1  Dkt. No. 125 (Pars) at 11; Dkt. No. 1 (Pars) ¶ 287 (“Defendants’ actions, as set forth above, affect \n2  the Plaintiffs’ substantive rights and were made without observance of procedure required by law \n3  in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D).”).  “[W]hen an agency \n4  promulgates regulations other than ‘interpretative rules, general statements of policy, or rules of \n5  agency organization, procedure, or practice,’ 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(A), the statute provides the public \n6  with pre-promulgation notice and comment.  5 U.S.C. § 553(b), (c).”  Alcaraz v. Block, 746 F.2d \n7  593, 610-11 (9th Cir. 1984) (internal citation omitted).  The government cites Innovation Law Lab \n8  v. McAleenan, 924 F.3d 503, 509 (9th Cir. 2019), for the proposition that the State Department’s \n9  waiver guidance was not required to go through notice-and-comment rulemaking because it was \n10  merely “a ‘general statement of policy’ to guide the exercise of discretion by its officials.”  Dkt. \n11  No. 128 (Pars) at 6.  But that is not consistent with plaintiffs’ allegations here.  Plaintiffs have \n12  plausibly alleged for 12(b)(6) purposes that defendants have issued guidance which resulted in a \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  waiver process in which consular officers had no discretion to exercise at all.  Dkt. No. 1 (Pars) \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  ¶¶ 279, 284.  The government may, however, raise the argument again if warranted at a later stage \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  of the case, after development of the record.   \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  3.  Accardi Claim \nS d nr\nee 17  As a second claim, the Pars plaintiffs essentially re-allege their first claim in the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  alternative, this time under the “Accardi Doctrine & Administrative Procedure Act.”  Dkt. No. 1 \n19  (Pars) ¶¶ 289-94.  It will go forward for the reasons stated in the Emami order with respect to the \n20  Accardi doctrine.  The government says that “Accardi has no relevance here, where the \n21  Proclamation and its related guidance are neither regulations nor internal documents that create \n22  any procedural rights.”  Dkt. No. 120 (Pars) at 10.  This is in effect an improper request for \n23  reconsideration of the Emami order, see Civil L.R. 7-9, and in any event, the Accardi doctrine is \n24  not so circumscribed, as the government’s own case citations demonstrate.  In Montilla v. \n25  Immigration and Naturalization Service, 926 F.2d 162, 167 (2d Cir. 1991), the court held that \n26  “[t]he Accardi doctrine is premised on fundamental notions of fair play underlying the concept of \n27  due process.  . . . Its ambit is not limited to rules attaining the status of formal regulations.  As the \n28  Supreme Court noted ‘where the rights of individuals are affected, it is incumbent upon agencies \n5 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 152   Filed 06/05/20   Page 6 of 10\n \n1  to follow their own procedures.’”  The Montilla court further noted that “[t]he doctrine has \n2  continued vitality, particularly where a petitioner’s rights are ‘affected.’”  Id. \n3  Two other aspects of the Montilla case are relevant here.  It does not stand for the \n4  proposition, as the government suggests, that “even assuming that an Accardi claim could survive \n5  a motion to dismiss, the only relief available would be limited to a ‘remand’ with instructions for \n6  the agency to comply.”  Dkt. No. 120 (Pars) at 11.  In Montilla, a remand to the Board of \n7  Immigration Appeals made sense because petitioner’s sole contention on appeal was that “the \n8  immigration judge did not follow the applicable regulation protecting an alien’s right to counsel, 8 \n9  C.F.R. § 242.16(a) (1990), and that this error constituted a denial of due process” in his \n10  deportation proceeding.  926 F.2d at 166, 170.  The Montilla court never said that a remand was \n11  the only option for an Accardi violation; to the contrary, it emphasized that the doctrine was “still \n12  alive and well” and that it was a “judicially-evolved rule ensuring fairness.”  Id. at 168.  This \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  underscores the flexibility inherent in the doctrine to fashion a remedy that fits the wrong.  \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Montilla is also notable for applying Accardi as a freestanding claim, untethered to the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  APA or other statute.  This is entirely consistent with the decision in Accardi itself, which was not \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  based on the APA.  See United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260 (1954).  The \nS d nr\nee 17  Court has reached the same conclusion as Montilla that an Accardi claim can stand on its own and \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  “is at heart a claim of procedural fairness that owes as much to the Due Process Clause as to the \n19  Administrative Procedures Act.”  Dkt. No. 122 (Emami) at 2 (citing Jefferson v. Harris, 285 F. \n20  Supp. 3d 173, 185 (D.D.C. 2018)).  Plaintiffs’ decision to tie their Accardi claim to the APA is \n21  analytically questionable, and they may find that they have imposed on themselves unnecessary \n22  burdens by doing that.  The request to dismiss the Pars plaintiffs’ second claim under the Accardi \n23  doctrine is denied.   \n24  4.  Fifth Amendment Due Process Claim \n25  Plaintiffs’ third claim directly under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment for a \n26  violation of procedural due process cannot go forward.  In the Emami order, the Court dismissed \n27  this claim due to plaintiffs’ “inability to allege a deprivation of an interest protected by the Due \n28  Process Clause.”  Dkt. No. 74 (Emami) at 17.  This is a separate and different inquiry from the one \n6 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 152   Filed 06/05/20   Page 7 of 10\n \n1  under Accardi, and is subject to different standards.  The Pars plaintiffs ask the Court to \n2  “reconsider its view,” Dkt. No. 125 (Pars) at 12, on the basis of a circuit decision from 2008.  See \n3  id. at 12-13 (citing Bustamante v. Mukasey, 531 F.3d 1059 (9th Cir. 2008)).  This is also an \n4  improper request for reconsideration, and it is unpersuasive in that Bustamante pre-dates Kerry v. \n5  Din, 135 S.Ct. 2128 (2015), the main basis for the Court’s prior order on this issue, by nearly a \n6  decade.  The third claim is dismissed.   \n7  B.  Emami Second Amended Complaint \n8  The second amended complaint in Emami, and the attendant motion to dismiss arguments, \n9  are Groundhog Day or déjà vu all over again, depending on one’s taste in clichés.  The allegations \n10  and arguments on both sides are virtually unchanged.  \n11  The Emami SAC continues to suffer from vague and conflicting allegations.  To take one \n12  example, the SAC says that defendants have failed to issue any guidance at all.  See, e.g., Dkt. No. \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  75 (Emami) ¶ 313 (“Defendants have either failed to promulgate guidance or have promulgated \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  guidance that is arbitrary and capricious on its face”).  This is an inherently odd assertion, \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  especially in light of plaintiffs’ own complaint exhibits in which the State Department recognized \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  its online postings as its “outward facing guidance” for waivers.  Dkt. No. 74 (Emami) at 14.  \nS d nr\nee 17  Plaintiffs try to walk this back in their opposition to the motion to dismiss, where they say that \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  their claim “is not that no guidance has been issued at all, but rather that the issued guidance has \n19  not been followed; that the guidance itself is arbitrary and capricious; and that it violates \n20  Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights.”  Dkt. No. 104 (Emami) at 1-2.  In light of this admission, the \n21  portions and claims in the SAC alleging that no guidance was issued are dismissed.  The Court \n22  will not catalog here the other vague and inconsistent allegations in the SAC, but if they become \n23  an issue in the case, they are likely to meet a similar disposition. \n24  The government’s request to dismiss the first claim under the APA is denied.  Plaintiffs \n25  allege, among other things, that the government has “failed to follow their own policies and \n26  procedures,” and have “put in place a waiver process in which applicants are denied waivers \n27  without ever receiving notice or an opportunity to apply [and] applicants are denied waivers \n28  without having had a consular interview since the time the Proclamation went into effect.”  Dkt. \n7 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 152   Filed 06/05/20   Page 8 of 10\n \n1  No. 75 (Emami) ¶ 314.  Plaintiffs allege that these actions should be invalidated under Accardi, \n2  347 U.S. 260.  Id. ¶ 317.  The Court has already found this to be a viable claim, Dkt. No. 74 \n3  (Emami), and that conclusion holds.  \n4  The second and third claims for relief under the Fifth Amendment are again dismissed \n5  based on an “inability to allege a deprivation of an interest protected by the Due Process Clause.”  \n6  Dkt. No. 74 (Emami) at 17.  The Court has also determined that the equal protection claim “holds \n7  together only if it is assumed that the Proclamation unconstitutionally excludes Muslims or \n8  illegally discriminates on the basis of nationality, a proposition that the Supreme Court turned \n9  aside in Hawaii.”  Id. (citing 138 S.Ct. at 2413-23).  The Court further noted that the equal \n10  protection claim was likely to be subject to rational basis review, and that the Supreme Court “has \n11  already concluded in reviewing the Proclamation that ‘the Government has set forth a sufficient \n12  national security justification to survive rational basis review.’  Hawaii, 138 S.Ct. at 2423.”  Id. at \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  18.  The Emami plaintiffs’ Fifth Amendment claims are virtually unchanged from their previous \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  versions, and the Court sees no reason to reach a different conclusion on either claim. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  The mandamus claim is dismissed.  The claim focuses on defendants’ alleged “fail[ure] to \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  develop meaningful guidance,” Dkt. No. 75 (Emami) ¶ 336, an allegation that plaintiffs have now \nS d nr\nee 17  retracted.  Plaintiffs have added a claim for unreasonable delay on decisions on individual visa and \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  waiver applications.  Id. ¶ 337.  But “[m]andamus is an extraordinary remedy and is available to \n19  compel a federal official to perform a duty only if: (1) the individual’s claim is clear and certain; \n20  (2) the official’s duty is nondiscretionary, ministerial, and so plainly prescribed as to be free from \n21  doubt, and (3) no other adequate remedy is available.”  Kildare v. Saenz, 325 F.3d 1078, 1084 (9th \n22  Cir. 2003); see also Heckler v. Ringer, 466 U.S. 602, 616 (1984) (“The common-law writ of \n23  mandamus, as codified in 28 U.S.C. § 1361, is intended to provide a remedy for a plaintiff only if \n24  he has exhausted all other avenues of relief and only if the defendant owes him a clear \n25  nondiscretionary duty.”).  Plaintiffs do not identify any source of law that mandates that decisions \n26  be issued within a certain period of time, and the decisions on individual waiver applications are \n27  inherently discretionary.  See 82 Fed. Reg. at 45168 (“a consular officer, or the Commissioner, \n28 \n8 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 152   Filed 06/05/20   Page 9 of 10\n \n1  United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP), or the Commissioners’ designee, as \n2  appropriate, may, in their discretion, grant waivers on a case-by-case basis”). \n3  II.  SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n4  The government’s motions for summary judgment are denied.  The government relies on \n5  an “administrative record” to “show[] that defendants have applied the waiver provision in an \n6  orderly way.”  Dkt. No. 98 (Emami) at 11.  But this does not account for the Accardi claims, and \n7  “there is no ‘administrative record’ when the essence of the claim is that the government has failed \n8  to act in accordance with its own rules and regulations.”  Dkt. No. 122 (Emami) at 2.  In addition, \n9  the multiple discovery dispute letters that have been filed in these cases underscore the degree to \n10  which the parties disagree about the material facts and what the “administrative record” might \n11  properly contain.  These factual disputes preclude summary judgment at this time.  See Federal \n12  Trade Commission v. D-Link Systems, Inc., No. 17-cv-00039-JD, 2018 WL 6040192 (N.D. Cal. \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Nov. 5, 2018).  It is also doubtful that plaintiffs have had a full and fair opportunity to take \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  discovery from defendants and test the evidence the government has presented as the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  administrative record.   \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  CONCLUSION \nS d nr\nee 17  In the Pars case, defendants’ motion to dismiss is denied as to plaintiffs’ APA claim and \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Accardi claim, but granted as to the Fifth Amendment claim.  The summary judgment motion is \n19  denied without prejudice.   \n20  In the Emami case, defendants’ motion to dismiss is denied for plaintiffs’ APA claim, but \n21  granted for plaintiffs’ Fifth Amendment Due Process and Equal Protection claims, and the \n22  mandamus claim.  Defendants’ summary judgment motion is denied without prejudice.   \n23  On this record, the Court declines to provide yet another round of pleading amendments to \n24  either set of plaintiffs.  The Emami plaintiffs have had multiple opportunities to amend, in which \n25  case the Court’s discretion to deny further amendment is especially broad.  See Chodos v. West  \n26  // \n27  // \n28  // \n9 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 152   Filed 06/05/20   Page 10 of 10\n \n1  Publishing Co., 292 F.3d 992, 1003 (9th Cir. 2002).  So too for the Pars plaintiffs, given the \n2  procedural context of these closely related cases.   \n3  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n4  Dated:  June 5, 2020  \n5   \n6     \nJAMES DONATO \n7 \nUnited States District Judge \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13 \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15 \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16 \nS d nr\nee 17 \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n10 ",

INTRODUCTION \n3\nThis is an unusual action—Plaintiffs bring what they plead as an APA claim to challenge \n4\nthe implementation of the waiver provision in Presidential Proclamation 9645, 82 Fed. Reg. 45161 \n5\n(Sept. 24, 2017), which the Supreme Court recently upheld in Hawaii v. Trump, 138 S. Ct. 2392 \n6 (2018). But Plaintiffs identify no agency policy that they claim is invalid or improper, and they \n7 challenge individual waiver denials despite the doctrine of consular nonreviewabilty. Plaintiffs \n8 assert that the waiver process is “a sham”—essentially a process that is not being implemented at \n9 all. This Court recognized the unusual nature of this APA claim in its motion to dismiss ruling. \n10 See Dkt. No. 74. This Court explained that the only viable inquiry was into whether the State \nDepartment  was  in  fact  implementing  the  waiver  provision  pursuant to  guidance  issued  to \n11\nimplement the Proclamation. The government’s record answers this question definitively and in \n12\nthe affirmative: the State Department has issued detailed guidance to its consular officers and \n13\ncontinues to update that guidance to assist them in processing waiver requests. And those officers \n14\nare carrying out their duties in good faith, authorizing thousands of waivers and conducting \n15\nburdensome and time-consuming national security vetting on many thousands more. The status of \n16\nthe individual Plaintiff cases shows this process is ongoing. Because the process is not a sham, and \n17\nguidance has been issued, this Court should grant summary judgment to Defendants.  \n18\nThis Court partially dismissed this matter in February. The Court allowed Plaintiffs’ \n19\nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA) challenge to proceed in a limited way, based on its finding \n20\nthat Plaintiffs stated a claim under United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260 \n21\n(1954), finding that “the heart of the APA claim is that the State Department has acted arbitrarily \n22\nand unlawfully by disregarding its own procedures and rules in administering the waiver program.” \n23\nSee Dkt. No. 74 at 13-16. The Court dismissed Plaintiffs’ constitutional claims, holding that \n24 Plaintiffs failed to allege any constitutionally protected fundamental right, Dkt. No. 74 at 16-17, \n25 and that Hawaii precludes their argument that a high proportion of waiver denials could constitute \n26 inherently  unconstitutional  discrimination.  Id.  at  17.  The  Court  also  dismissed  Plaintiffs’ \n27 mandamus claim as redundant.  \n28 Plaintiffs new complaint should be dismissed for largely the same reasons. First, Plaintiffs’ \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 98   Filed 06/13/19   Page 7 of 30\n \n \n1\nAccardi claim, unless very narrowly focused on whether the waiver process is being implemented \n2\nat all, is too amorphous and does not specifically allege that any particular aspect of the process \n3\nviolates  the  Proclamation  or  State  Department  guidance.  Further,  the  Proclamation  and  its \n4\nimplementing guidance are neither regulations nor internal documents that create procedural \n5\nrights. Second, Plaintiffs’ due process, equal protection, and mandamus claims have already been \n6 resolved by this Court and have not substantively changed in the new complaint. \n7 Should the Court deny the instant motion to dismiss, Defendants, in the alternative, move \n8 for summary judgment based on the administrative record submitted to the Court, which includes \n9 the various types of guidance provided to consular officers to assist them in resolving waiver \n10 requests, the factual material showing the progress made in each of the Plaintiffs’ individual cases, \nand statistics recently provided to Congress showing the active and ongoing implementation of the \n11\nwaiver provision. As this Court has noted, the “gravamen of the complaint” here is that the \n12\ngovernment has disregarded its own guidance about visa and waiver adjudications under the \n13\nProclamation “in favor of a policy of blanket denials.” See Dkt. No. 74, at 12:6-8. As this Court \n14\nexplained, the government’s Accardi defense “puts substantial emphasis on a number of factual \n15\nmatters” such as “waiver reviews and approval figures” and is “properly addressed in a summary \n16\njudgment motion (if truly undisputed).” Id. at 16. As the accompanying certified administrative \n17\nrecord and congressional reporting shows there is no such policy of blanket denials; instead, since \n18\nthe Proclamation went into effect, relevant agencies have issued guidance to consular officers to \n19\nassist them in adjudicating visa waiver requests.  \n20\nConsular officers, moreover, have been processing and reviewing a vast number of visa \n21\napplications on an individualized basis: over 3,000 waiver requests granted as of the end of March. \n22\nAn additional 12,000—over 26 percent of those considered for waivers—are undergoing security \n23\nvetting,  which  is  a  rigorous,  time-consuming  process  that  is  fully  consistent  with  the \n24 Proclamation’s direction that waivers be granted only to those who pose no national security or \n25 public safety risk given fundamental flaws in the identification infrastructure or cooperativeness \n26 of the countries subject to the Proclamation, a concern the Supreme Court expressly validated. \n27 There can be no real factual dispute over these processing statistics or the existence of the guidance \n28 to consular officers. Indeed, Plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate any violation of law even as to \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 98   Filed 06/13/19   Page 8 of 30\n \n \n1\ntheir own cases, where the record reveals that they—or their family members—have been issued \n2\nvisas, are still undergoing consideration for waivers, or have been refused after having been found \n3\nineligible for a waiver. \n4\nIn sum, Defendants are implementing the waiver provision in an ordered and deliberate \n5\nway, giving due consideration not only to the demonstrated interests of individual applicants but \n6 also to the abiding concerns of national security and public safety that gave rise to the Proclamation \n7 in the first place. Simply put, there is no viable allegation that Defendants have not implemented \n8 the Proclamation’s waiver process in good faith, or that the waiver process is a “sham.” \n9 II.  BACKGROUND \n10 A.  The Proclamation’s Waiver Process   \n11 At  issue  is  the  implementation  of  the  Proclamation’s  waiver  provision.  Subject  to \nexceptions not relevant here, the Proclamation suspends entry into the United States of nationals \n12\nof several identified countries of concern. See 82 Fed. Reg. 45161 § 2(g). A consular officer may \n13\nnonetheless, as a matter of discretion, “grant waivers on a case-by-case basis to permit the entry \n14\nof foreign nationals for whom entry is otherwise suspended.” Id. § 3(c). Notably, visa applicants \n15\nare not refused pursuant to the Proclamation if they are ineligible to obtain visas on other grounds \n16\nor if their applications are rejected for reasons other than the Proclamation’s entry restrictions. An \n17\napplicant is refused under the Proclamation only if it constitutes the sole basis for visa refusal. By \n18\nextension, only an applicant refused based solely on the Proclamation may be considered for a \n19\nwaiver under it. See id. § 3(a), (c). \n20\n  As the State Department’s publicly accessible guidance explains, there is no separate \n21\napplication for a waiver: “An individual who seeks to travel to the United States should apply for \n22\na visa and disclose during the visa interview any information that might demonstrate that he or she \n23\nis eligible for a waiver.” U.S. Department of State – Bureau of Consular Affairs, June 26 Supreme \n24\nCourt  Decision  on  Presidential  Proclamation  9645  (“State  Dep’t  Website”),  available  at \n25 https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/presidential-\n26 proclamation-archive/june_26_supreme_court_decision_on_presidential_proclamation9645.html \n27 (last visited June 11, 2019); A.R. 296, 299, 306, 309, 317, 319. This is consistent with other visa-\n28 application  procedures,  such  as  nonimmigrant  visa  waivers,  which  do  not  have  a  separate \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 98   Filed 06/13/19   Page 9 of 30\n \n \n1\napplication.  See  Foreign  Affairs  Manual  (“FAM”)  305.4-3,  available  at \n2\nhttps://fam.state.gov/fam/09FAM/09FAM030504.html.  The  Proclamation  sets  out  a  non-\n3\nexhaustive list of examples elucidating when a waiver “may be appropriate,” while emphasizing \n4\nthat “[c]ase-by-case waivers may not be granted categorically.” 82 Fed. Reg. at 45168-69, \n5\n§ 3(c)(iv).  The  Proclamation  mandates  that  “[t]he  Secretary  of  State  and  the  Secretary  of \n6 Homeland Security shall coordinate to adopt guidance addressing the circumstances in which \n7 waivers may be appropriate.” Id. at 45168, § 3(c). Such guidance is not required to be made public, \n8 and the State Department often provides internal guidance to consular officers to avoid the risk \n9 that visa applicants will misuse it. A.R. 288, 297, 308, 318. \n10 Since the promulgation of the Proclamation, the State Department has provided answers \n11 on its public website to a number of common questions regarding the mechanics of the waiver \n12 process. See State Dep’t Website. It has also released hundreds of pages of guidance, both general \n13 and in specific cases. See, e.g., A.R. 13-155; U.S. Department of State, Virtual Reading Room \n14 Documents Search Results.2 This Court has previously noted that such online postings constitute \n15 the State Department’s outward-facing guidance on the waiver process. Dkt. No. 74, at 14:18-19. \n16 The  internal  waiver  guidance  that  has  been  promulgated,  and  submitted  in  the \n17 administrative record for this Court’s review, consists of several types of material. First, updates \n18 to the Foreign Affairs Manual have provided visa adjudication guidance to consular officers by \n19 the State Department. A.R. 3-11. Second, detailed operational Q&As have addressed specific \n20 issues that might arise in applying the Proclamation and its waiver provisions, and are updated on \n21 a rolling basis. A.R. 13-155. Third, cables have regularly been issued to consular posts, as the State \n22 Department  has  endeavored  to  ensure  that  its  personnel  are  in  full  compliance  with  the \n23 Proclamation. A.R. 157-98. Fourth, various training materials have been produced for the benefit \n24 of consular officers, including presentations, flowcharts, and reference guides. A.R. 200-84, \n25 327-45. Fifth, press guidance has laid out waiver-related issues suitable for explanation to the \n26 public. A.R. 286-325. \n                                                 \n27\n2  Available  at    https://foia.state.gov/Search/results.aspx?searchText=Presidential+Proclamation+9645&beginDate \n28\n=20170901 &endDate=20190612&publishedBeginDate=&publishedEndDate=&caseNumber=. \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 98   Filed 06/13/19   Page 10 of 30\n \n \n1\nA waiver may be granted only if an applicant shows the following: (1) denying entry would \n2\ncause undue hardship, (2) entry would be in the national interest of the United States, and (3) entry \n3\nwould not pose a threat to the national security or public safety of the United States. 82 Fed. Reg. \n4\nat 45168, § 3(c). As of March 31, 2019, 3,071 visa applicants have been given waivers and issued \n5\nvisas. See Dep’t of State Report to Congress: Implementation of Presidential Proclamation 9645 – \n6 December 8, 2017, to March 31, 2019 (“State Dep’t Report”).3 While the first two prongs of waiver \n7 eligibility may be readily resolved based on the materials submitted by the applicant, an analysis \n8 of the third prong can prove time-consuming because the applicant must be carefully vetted in \n9 light of the identity sharing problems identified as the basis for the Proclamation. As of March 31, \n10 2019, more than 12,000 visa applicants had been found by consular officers to preliminarily meet \nthe first two conditions for a waiver and are now under review to determine whether they meet the \n11\nnational security and public safety criterion. See id.  \n12\nVisa applicants who are refused under the Proclamation are handed notices by consular \n13\nofficers indicating that they are ineligible for a visa under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f) and a consular officer \n14\nis reviewing their eligibility for a waiver under the Proclamation. See A.R. at 10, 11, 29-30, 57-58, \n15\n87-88, 119-20, 151-53, 340-41. The notices describe the three criteria that must be met for a waiver \n16\napproval, and advise applicants that, during this potentially lengthy process, their applications will \n17\nremain refused under § 1182(f) until the consular officer has made an individualized determination \n18\non those three factors. See id. \n19\nB.  Individual Plaintiffs’ Claims \n20\nPlaintiffs include U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents who filed family-based visa \n21\npetitions on behalf of one or more beneficiaries, or whose family members are visa applicants. \n22\nSAC ¶¶ 11, 12, 16-45, 95-302, 304. Plaintiffs also include unadmitted and nonresident aliens who \n23\napplied for and were denied visas under the Proclamation. Id.  \n24\nIn all, 26 Plaintiffs are seeking waivers in this action. One Plaintiff has been issued an \n25 immigrant visa based on a finding that she was eligible for a waiver. A.R. at 347-59 ¶ 12. One \n26 Plaintiff had a visa application refused for a reason unrelated to the Proclamation. Id. ¶ 21. Twelve \n                                                 \n27\n3 Available at https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/presidentialproclamation/Combined%20-%20Report%20on \n28\n%20Implementation%20of%20PP%209645%20December%2007%202017%20to%20March%2031%202019.pdf. \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 98   Filed 06/13/19   Page 11 of 30\n \n \n1\nPlaintiffs, whose visa applications were refused under the Proclamation, have been advised that \n2\nthey do not qualify for a waiver. Id. ¶¶ 5, 6, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. The remaining \n3\ntwelve Plaintiffs have been preliminarily found to meet the first two waiver prongs—undue \n4\nhardship and national interest—and are among the group of more than 12,000 applicants who are \n5\nundergoing national security vetting, but for whom a final decision has not been made. Id. ¶¶ 4, 7, \n6 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 22. While national security vetting is ongoing, these Plaintiffs’ visa \n7 applications remain properly refused under the Proclamation. \n8 Plaintiffs claim that their visa applications and waivers were either inappropriately denied \n9 or have been pending too long, which they attribute to an alleged “blanket denial” policy, SAC \n10 ¶¶ 3, 5, 7; a failure to issue or follow internal policies and procedures, id. ¶ 1-2, 314; a failure to \ncreate a separate process for waiver applications, id. ¶ 315; and various constitutional theories, id. \n11\n¶¶ 122, 173, 319-32. \n12\nIII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \n13\nThe APA provides for judicial review of final agency action. See 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 704. It \n14\nauthorizes courts to “hold unlawful and set aside” only those agency actions, findings, and \n15\nconclusions it finds to be “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \n16\naccordance with the law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). The administrative record is the exclusive basis \n17\nfor the Court’s review. See id. at 743-44 (1985) (“The task of the reviewing court is to apply the \n18\nappropriate APA standard of review, 5 U.S.C. § 706, to the agency decision based on the record \n19\nthe agency presents to the reviewing court.”); Camp v. Pitts, 411 U.S. 138, 142 (1973) (per curiam) \n20\n(“the focal point for judicial review should be the administrative record in existence, not some new \n21\nrecord made initially in the reviewing court”). \n22\nSummary judgment under Rule 56 is appropriate to resolve APA challenges. See Nw. \n23\nMotorcycle Ass’n v. U.S. Dep’t Agric., 18 F.3d 1468, 1471–72 (9th Cir. 1994). Even if the parties \n24\ndispute the facts before the administrative agency, “the function of the district court is to determine \n25\nwhether or not as a matter of law the evidence in the administrative record permitted the agency \n26\nto make the decision it did.” Occidental Engineering Co. v. Immigration & Naturalization Service, \n27\n753 F.2d 766, 769 (9th Cir. 1985); see also City & Cnty. of San Francisco v. United States, 130 \n28\n6 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 98   Filed 06/13/19   Page 12 of 30\n \n \n1\nF.3d 873, 877 (9th Cir. 1997). \n2\nIV.  ARGUMENT \n3\nA.  Motion to Dismiss \n4 1.  Plaintiffs’ fail to state a claim under the Accardi doctrine. \n5 In its February 4, 2019 Order, the Court found that Plaintiffs stated a claim under Accardi, \n6 347 U.S. 260, and “the heart of the APA claim is that the State Department has acted arbitrarily \n7 and unlawfully by disregarding its own procedures and rules in administering the waiver program.” \nSee Dkt. No. 74 at 13-16. This Court, however, did not have the benefit of detailed briefing from \n8\nthe Government on Accardi. That claim should now be dismissed because such a claim is too \n9\namorphous when Plaintiffs do not challenge any specific agency action as violative of agency \n10\npolicy, and the Proclamation and its implementing internal guidance are neither regulations nor \n11\ninternal documents that create procedural rights.  \n12\nAs an initial matter, even if Accardi’s directive that an agency must follow its own \n13\nregulations may make sense when analyzing a specific agency action, it makes little sense when \n14\nthere is no final agency action subject to review, which is the case here given consular non-\n15\nreviewability. Accardi—even where it applies—is not a license to engage in roving oversight of \n16\nan agency’s implementation of a regulatory scheme, and there are no cases where it has been \n17\napplied in the manner Plaintiffs seek to apply it here. See Order at 18 (recognizing a request to \n18\n“order defendants to fulfill their duties under the Proclamation” may be “impermissible”).  \n19\nFurther, Accardi is inapplicable here because the Proclamation is not a regulation. Accardi, \n20\n347 U.S. at 268. It is neither the nature nor the purpose of the Proclamation waiver provisions to \n21 confer a legally enforceable benefit or right in any person, as the Proclamation itself expressly \n22 acknowledges. Proclamation, § 9(c). Moreover, the implementing guidance, including the Foreign \n23 Affairs Manual, simply furnishes additional details regarding the waiver process, which ultimately \n24 consists of discretionary determinations made by consular officers as expressly provided by the \n25 Proclamation. A.R. 3-11. The Ninth Circuit has held that the Accardi doctrine is inapplicable in \nthe context most similar to this one—with respect to internal operating guidelines that preserve the \n26\nexercise of agency discretion as in this case. See Mada-Luna v. Fitzpatrick, 813 F.2d 1006, 1009 \n27\n(9th Cir. 1987) (Operating instructions are “general statements of policy” because the instructions \n28\n7 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 98   Filed 06/13/19   Page 13 of 30\n \n \n1\npersevered the agency’s flexibility and opportunity to make discretionary determinations.). As the \n2\nNinth Circuit explained, an Accardi claim is not viable where a directive “leave[s] agency officials \n3\nfree to consider the individual facts in the various cases that arise and to exercise discretion.” Id. \n4\nThat is plainly true here given the express terms of the Proclamation and the discretion conferred \n5\non consular officials.  \n6 Plaintiffs briefly assert that the government is failing to follow two regulations, see \n7 generally SAC ¶ 314, but their own complaint shows this to be untrue. The two regulations, 22 \n8 C.F.R. §§ 41.121 & 42.81 mandate that a decision be made on a visa application and supported by \n9 a justification. Here, every Plaintiff has received exactly what the regulations require. See, e.g., \n10 SAC Ex. L at 2, Dkt. No. 77-13 (“[A] consular officer found you ineligible for a visa under Section \n212(f). . . Taking into account the provisions of the Proclamation, a waiver will not be granted in \n11\nyour case.”); SAC ¶¶ 79, 97, 99-302; see also AR at 347-59. \n12\nEven assuming an Accardi claim could survive a motion to dismiss, the relief for any \n13\nviolation of such a “regulation” under an Accardi theory would be limited to a “remand” with \n14\ninstructions for the agency to comply with its regulations, irrespective of the outcome the agency \n15\nreaches on remand. Montilla v. I.N.S., 926 F.2d 162, 169 (2d Cir. 1991). But for those who were \n16\ndenied a visa based on the Proclamation, the agency is already considering qualification for a \n17\nwaiver under the applicable guidelines. A.R. 347-59. The relief Plaintiffs seek goes far beyond a \n18\nremand and would not be appropriate on this claim. See generally SAC, Prayer for Relief at 66.  \n19\n2.  Plaintiffs fail to state due process and equal protection claims. \n20\nPlaintiffs’ constitutional claims are virtually identical to those this Court already rejected. \n21\nSee Dkt. No. 74 at 16-18. Because they continue to lack merit, the Court should dismiss them. \n22\nFirst, Plaintiffs do not allege a deprivation of an interest protected by the Due Process \n23\nClause,  as  this  Court  held.  See  Dkt.  No.  74  at  16-17  (“[Plaintiffs  have  not  alleged  any \n24\nconstitutionally protected fundamental rights” and there is no “unfettered right to reside in the \n25 United States with family members who are foreign nationals”); Plaintiffs’ complaint has not \n26 substantively changed on this claim. Compare SAC ¶¶ 319-21 with FAC ¶¶ 322-27 (consisting of \n27 almost identical allegations). In a purported procedural due process claim, Plaintiffs now set forth \n28 alleged “reliance interests” and procedural rights based on “statutory benefits” and “an opportunity \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 98   Filed 06/13/19   Page 14 of 30\n \n \n1\nfor meaningful consideration for a waiver.” SAC ¶¶ 322, 324. But these allegations amount to the \n2\nsame insufficient, cursory claim this Court already rejected. Dkt. No. 74 at 17 (dismissing \n3\nPlaintiffs’ procedural due process claim because of “Plaintiffs’ inability to allege a deprivation of \n4\nan interest protected by the Due Process Clause”); compare SAC ¶¶ 322-26 with FAC ¶¶ 328, 333-\n5\n34. The visa applicant Plaintiffs do not have a protected liberty or property interest because they \n6 are “unadmitted and nonresident alien[s]” who have “no constitutional right of entry into the \n7 country,” Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753. 762 (1972), and “[w]hatever the procedure \n8 authorized by Congress is, it is due process as far as an alien denied entry is concerned.” U.S. ex \n9 rel. Knauff v. Shaughnessy, 338 U.S. 537, 544 (1950). Thus, even assuming that a U.S. citizen \n10 spouse has a protected interest, Defendants afforded them the process due by providing a statutory \ncitation justifying the visa denials (SAC Ex. L at 2, Dkt. No. 77-13). Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2419. \n11\n(“the Government need provide only a statutory citation to explain a visa denial”). Thus, all \n12\nPlaintiffs’ procedural due process claims fail.  \n13\nPlaintiffs’ equal protection claim is also substantively identical to the one rejected by this \n14\nCourt given that Hawaii had already resolved the relevant issues. See Dkt. No. 74 at 17 (claim \n15\n“demands assumptions unsupported by non-conclusory allegations of fact” and Supreme Court \n16\nhas already rejected “the logic that almost-uniform denials of waivers is tantamount to denial \n17\n[based on] discriminatory grounds) (citing Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2413-23). This Court noted that \n18\n“the equal protection claim would likely be subject to rational basis review” and “[t]he Supreme \n19\nCourt . . . concluded . . . that the Government has set forth a sufficient national security justification \n20\nto survive rational basis review.” Id. at 18 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted); accord \n21\nAlharbi v. Miller, -- F. Supp. 3d --, 2019 WL 1367758 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2019) (dismissing \n22\nEstablishment Clause and Due Process challenges to waiver process). \n23\nIn sum, these constitutional claims have not changed and must be dismissed. Letting these \n24 claims proceed would amount to an end run around the dispositive Hawaii decision. \n25 3.  Plaintiffs fail to state a mandamus claim. \n26   Plaintiffs set forth an asserted mandamus claim that is substantively identical to their prior \n27 claim. See SAC ¶¶ 333-39. This Court has already found that a mandamus claim in this context is \n28 redundant, and granted leave to amend it only as appropriate “at a later stage.” See Dkt. No. 74 at \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 98   Filed 06/13/19   Page 15 of 30\n \n \n1\n18 (“Because the APA claim will go forward, the Court dismisses plaintiffs’ mandamus claim . . . . \n2\nThe dismissal is without prejudice to renewing at a later time, should that become appropriate \n3\n[including when] relevant to a discussion of the proper relief in this case.”); compare SAC ¶¶ 333-\n4\n39 with FAC ¶¶ 335-41. Therefore, the Court should likewise dismiss Plaintiffs’ mandamus claim \n5\nin the SAC. As we explained in our first motion to dismiss, Dkt. No. 42 at 9-11, Plaintiffs have no \n6 clear right to the relief they seek, nor do Defendants have a nondiscretionary, ministerial duty to \n7 perform the acts requested given that Proclamation waivers are discretionary. \n8   Even putting those fundamental flaws in the mandamus claim to the side, the relief \n9 requested under mandamus is not warranted. Plaintiffs ask this Court to order Defendants to: \n10 (i) “develop guidance on the waiver process,” SAC at ¶¶ 335-36, Prayer for Relief ¶ 3; (ii) \n11 “evaluate whether . . . applicants previously denied waivers under an unlawful process should be \n12 reconsidered,”  SAC  at  ¶  338;  (iii)  and  “adjudicate  applicants’  requests  for  waivers”  and \n13 “immediately issue visas,” SAC at ¶ 335, 338. With respect to guidance, it has been promulgated, \n14 and is included in the administrative record, as Plaintiffs acknowledge. See State Dep’t Website; \n15 see, e.g., SAC at ¶ 86; Dkt. No. 77-4, 77-7. With respect to readjudicating all waiver requests, this \n16 Court  has  already  found  that  a  request  for  “the  retraction  of  all  visa  denials”  would  be \n17 “impermissible.” Dkt. No. 74 at 18. And as State Department statistics show, thousands of waivers \n18 have been granted and many thousands more are under active consideration. With respect to the \n19 demand  that  Plaintiff’s  individual  waiver  request  be  immediately  adjudicated,  this  relief  is \n20 inapprorpiate. The language of the Proclamation emphasizes that no applicant has a “clear right” \n21 to a waiver, and that it is up to consular officers, following guidance from the Secretaries of State \n22 and Homeland Security, and using the time necessary to ensure themselves that each of the three \n23 waiver factors are met to their satisfaction, to decide “in their discretion” if a waiver “would be \n24 appropriate” in any given case. Proclamation, § 3(c). Even if the Proclamation were enforceable, \n25 it does not impose any timeline by which waivers must be adjudicated. Proclamation, § 3(c); see \n26 Luo v. Coultice, 178 F. Supp. 2d 1135, 1140 (C.D. Cal. 2001). But even if Plaintiffs’ claims were \n27 subject to APA review under a “reasonable time” standard, which they are not, Plaintiffs fail to \n28\n10 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 98   Filed 06/13/19   Page 16 of 30\n \n \n1\nstate a claim that Defendants have not acted “within a reasonable time[ ],” given Defendants’ need \n2\nto review thousands of applications individually to assess the national-security and public-safety \n3\nrequirements for a waiver. 5 U.S.C. § 555(b); see Hussein v. Beecroft, No.-17-cv-12356, 2018 WL \n4\n3574717, at *7 (E.D. Mich. July 25, 2018); Luo, 178 F. Supp. 2d at 1140. The waiver process also \n5\noffers the ability to expedite processing in appopriate cases. See Moody v. Pompeo, No. 19-1151, \n6\nOrder  at  5  (D.D.C.  May  13,  2019)  (explaining  availability  of  expedited  processing  when \n7\nwarranted); A.R. 145 ( “[i]n urgent cases, a response from the Visa Office [to a waiver-related \n8\nquestion] can be provided within one business day, provided that the Visa Office has all the \n9\ninformation needed”). And any relief in favor of Plaintiffs will work to delay the adjudication of \n10\nothers seeking waivers. See State Dep’t Report (12,000 waiver requests undergoing security \n11\nvetting). For these reasons, the Court should dismiss Plaintiffs’ mandamus claim. \n12  \nB.  Motion for Summary Judgment \n13  \n1.  The administrative record emphatically demonstrates that the waiver process \n14 is not a sham. \n15 Contrary to Plaintiffs’ depiction of the waiver process as “arbitrary and ad hoc,” SAC ¶ 94, \n16 the administrative record shows that Defendants have applied the waiver provision in an orderly \n17 way, taking deliberate measures to adhere to the Proclamation and any related guidance. The \n18 waiver process is operating properly and is not a sham. This is established by the administrative \n19 record, which shows that (1) the State Department has regularly issued detailed internal guidance \n20 to inform consular officers’ application of the Proclamation’s waiver criteria, (2) each applicant \n21 who meets the first two prongs for a waiver is properly vetted for national security or public safety \n22 concerns,  (3) consular  officers  are  afforded  discretion  to  make  case-by-case  waiver \n23 determinations, which are not reviewable and are in any event entitled to a presumption of \n24 regularity, (4) the application process is legitimate, as applicants are automatically considered for \n25 waivers as part of a unitary visa application process consistent with other types of waiver requests, \n26 and (5) numerous applicants, including most Plaintiffs, either have been found eligible for waivers \n27 and issued visas or continue to receive administrative processing after the consular officer made a \n28 preliminary  finding  regarding  the  undue  hardship  and  national  interest  criteria.  The  record \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 98   Filed 06/13/19   Page 17 of 30\n \n \n1\nconfirms, moreover, that the Accardi doctrine does not apply in this case, as consular officers do \n2\nin fact enjoy discretion to make waiver determinations on a case-by-case basis. \n3\na.  Internal guidance \n4\nSummary judgment is appropriate because the record shows that the waiver process is \n5\nbeing regularly implemented and is not a sham. Proof of that robust administration can first be \n6\nfound in the guidance that the State Department has methodically prepared, and periodically \n7\nupdated, to ensure that waiver adjudications conform to the Proclamation’s terms. See 82 Fed. \n8\nReg. at 45168, § 3(c) (requiring relevant agencies to “coordinate to adopt guidance addressing the \n9\ncircumstances in which waivers may be appropriate for foreign nationals” under the Proclamation). \n10\nThe Department periodically circulated “Operational Q&As,” which include a detailed discussion \n11\nfor day-to-day application of the waiver standards by consular officers, and cover specific topics \n12\nsuch as how consular officers should construe the phrase “close family member” when considering \n13\nan applicant’s hardship, or what might constitute “significant business or professional obligations” \n14\nin a consular officer’s judgment. A.R. 19-24, 38-52, 67-81, 98-113, 130-46. The Q&As and other \n15\nguidance documents expound how the Proclamation’s general waiver criteria should be applied by \n16\nconsular officers in light of the specific facts presented in each case; thus, they delve into a number \n17\nof illustrative scenarios and hardship categories to elucidate when a consular officer might \n18\nreasonably find that an applicant has shown undue hardship, national interest, or the absence of \n19\nany threat to national security or public safety. A.R. 20-22, 43-48, 72-77, 102-08, 135-40. The \n20\nspecificity and depth with which the Q&As treat the waiver prongs—addressing, for instance, \n21\nwhether the spouse of “an unconsummated proxy marriage” could qualify as a close family \n22\nmember to establish undue hardship—undercuts any claim that the government is perfunctorily \n23\nissuing “mass waiver denials” or purposely flouting the Proclamation’s waiver provision. A.R. 45, \n24\n74, 105, 137; see Dkt. No. 1 ¶ 102. \n25\nThe same is true for internal State Department cables, many of which meticulously lay out \n26\nhow the waiver provision should be applied. One cable, from September 25, 2017, recites discrete \n27\n“steps” that consular officers should follow in adjudicating visa applications, reminding them that \n28\n12 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 98   Filed 06/13/19   Page 18 of 30\n \n \n1\nan applicant can qualify for a waiver even if he did not “fit[] in any of the categories of exceptions” \n2\nto the Proclamation. A.R. 164-65. That cable also contains examples drawn from the Proclamation \n3\nto illustrate particular instances when a waiver may be warranted—for example, when an officer \n4\nmakes the fact-specific determination that the applicant is “an individual needing urgent medical \n5\ncare, or someone whose entry is otherwise justified by the special circumstances of the case.” A.R. \n6\n171; see Proclamation § 3(c)(ii)(D) (directing State Department to issue guidance addressing this \n7\nexample of when a waiver would be appropriate). These internal cables, in addition to consistently \n8\nnoting the availability of  waivers,  have  been  responsive  to the  various  legal  developments \n9\nsurrounding the Proclamation. E.g., A.R. 163-64, 172, 185-86. Even after the Supreme Court \n10\nupheld the Proclamation as a lawful exercise of the President’s broad authority under 8 U.S.C. \n11\n§ 1182(f), agencies have continued to refine the procedures by which their personnel, including \n12\nconsular  officers,  process  visa  applications  and  regulate  entry  into  the  United  States.  See \n13\nA.R. 193-98 (Feb. 24, 2019 cable alerting consular officers of “the need to delve deeper into \n14\nparticular applications that warrant additional scrutiny”). Indeed, the very sequence of these \n15\ninternal cables, issued over time to ensure that consular officers are aware of and promptly account \n16\nfor evolving extrinsic circumstances, attests to the celerity and rigor with which the Department \n17\nof State applied the Proclamation and its waiver provision. \n18\nThe  State  Department  has  also  periodically  organized  trainings,  such  as  interactive \n19\nwebinars, to ensure that consular officers are acquainted with the scope and purpose of waiver \n20\nadjudications  under  the  Proclamation.  Consistent  with  the  individualized  nature  of  those \n21\nassessments, presenters have referred to the Proclamation to clarify the parameters of the waiver \n22\nanalysis—emphasizing, for example, that undue hardship cannot be found unless “an unusual \n23\nsituation exists that compels immediate travel by the applicant and that delaying visa issuance and \n24\nthe associated travel plans would defeat the purpose of travel.” A.R. 212, 235. These internal \n25\npresentations are consistent with the Proclamation and have provided examples and guidelines to \n26\ninform the factual evaluations done by consular officers prior to rendering any judgment on a \n27\nwaiver application. Such examples and guidelines have promoted consistent, competent, and \n28\n13 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 98   Filed 06/13/19   Page 19 of 30\n \n \n1\nassured decision-making by consular officers, who must weigh whether an applicant has made a \n2\nsufficient showing of the three waiver criteria. See A.R. 236-45 (discussing types of hardship to \n3\nconsider as part of the first prong and factual scenarios that might give rise to a finding of “undue” \n4\nhardship).  \n5\nThe presentations have been consistent with other internal guidance in requiring that \n6\nconsular officers provide case notes explaining the specific bases for any waiver issued, including \n7\n“the category of waiver for which the applicant is eligible,” “the undue hardship caused by denying \n8\nentry during the suspension,” the national interest advanced by virtue of the waiver, and “the \n9\nreasons the applicant does not pose a threat to U.S. national security or public safety.” Compare \n10\nA.R. 227-28, with A.R. 9, 22, 23, 50, 65, 79, 110-12, 143-44, 169. The repeated emphasis on the \n11\nneed to articulate the reasoning behind a waiver grant further confirms the robustness of the \n12\nprocess carried out by consular officers. See 8 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(1) (recognizing that the decision \n13\nto grant or deny a visa application, with limited exception, rests solely with the consular officer); \n14\n22 C.F.R. §§ 41.111, 41.121, 42.71, 42.81 (same). Additionally, the presentation materials, like \n15\nthe Q&As and cables, have been updated over time to incorporate any issues that might be relevant \n16\nto consular officers and to further improve efforts to consistently analyze waivers in accordance \n17\nwith the Proclamation’s broad mandates. See generally A.R. 200-84; see also A.R. 286 (indicating \n18\nthat “[t]he Proclamation provides a timeframe which will allow the relevant agencies to make \n19\noperational adjustments and implement its provisions”). That focus on refining the ability of \n20\nadjudicators to assess diverse waiver claims is evident even in the interactive nature of the \n21\nwebinars, which allow officers to ask questions through a chat box as the presentations are \n22\nongoing. A.R. 201, 220 (noting that any unanswered questions would be addressed through \n23\nupdates to the Q&As). Such ongoing refinements to the procedure of deciding waivers and \n24\ninstructing consular officers across the world show that the process is not a sham. \n25\n  In addition to the body of Q&As, cables, and presentations discussed above, the State \n26\nDepartment  has  produced  an  array  of  miscellaneous  guidance  documents—e.g.,  flowcharts, \n27\nsample letters, and reference guides—specific to the waiver process. A.R. 327-45. These too \n28\n14 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 98   Filed 06/13/19   Page 20 of 30\n \n \n1\ndemonstrate the agency’s efforts to ensure rational, consistent decision-making by consular \n2\nofficers. Of particular note are the flowcharts, which map out the analytical steps through which a \n3\nconsular officer must proceed before granting or denying a waiver, and serve as useful visual aids \n4\nfor consular officers who must consider a large number of visa applicants day in and day out. \n5\nA.R. 327-37. Especially relevant here is the flowchart for waiver eligibility determinations. \n6\nA.R. 337. While that flowchart contains redacted information that, if disclosed, would provide a \n7\nroadmap for applicants to potentially defeat screening protocols using fraud, it is revealing in its \n8\ndepiction of the various considerations that bear on a consular officer’s assessment of a waiver \n9\nclaim. Id. Plaintiffs surmise that the government has administered the waiver provision without a \n10\ndefinite plan or purpose, Dkt. No. 1 ¶ 7, but documents such as the flowchart show that the process \n11\nhas been anything but haphazard. Contrary to their claim of an “ad hoc” approach, the waiver \n12\nprovision has benefited from orderly administration by consular officers, who make a series of \n13\ndetailed factual assessments before arriving at any finding of no waiver. A.R. 237. \n14\nb.  National security vetting \n15\nThe most time-consuming part of the waiver process is the security vetting, whereby every \n16\napplicant must undergo thorough vetting to ensure they do not present a national security or public \n17\nsafety risk. That vetting—which is similar to many other vetting processes in the visa adjudication \n18\nsystem where consular officers consult law enforcement partners to help evaluate applicants—is \n19\ncritical to achieve a fundamental purpose of the Proclamation given the identity management and \n20\ncooperation problems with the subject countries. 82 Fed. Reg. at 45168, § 3(c)(i)(B) (waiver may \n21\nbe granted only if the applicant demonstrates to the consular officer’s satisfaction that “entry would \n22\nnot pose a threat to the national security or public safety of the United States”). Vetting aliens to \n23\nensure that there is no threat to national security or public safety is not a sham, and Plaintiffs’ \n24\ncomplaint raises no colorable allegation that the national security vetting is illegitimate or \n25\nimproper in any way. Thus, the part of the waiver process that causes the most delay is not in any \n26\nway being challenged in the operative complaint. \n27\nThe Proclamation, from the outset, explains that the purpose of its entry restrictions is to \n28\n15 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 98   Filed 06/13/19   Page 21 of 30\n \n \n1\nremedy threats to the safety of the United States posed by the inadequate identity-management and \n2\ninformation-sharing protocols of certain identified countries. 82 Fed. Reg. at 45163, § 1(a)-(b) \n3\n(such “protocols and practices of foreign governments are important for the effectiveness of the \n4\nscreening and vetting protocols and procedures of the United States,” which in turn “play a critical \n5\nrole” in protecting U.S. “citizens from terrorist attacks and other public-safety threats”); A.R. 3. \n6\nThe restrictions are intended to “encourage the countries to work with the United States to address \n7\nthose inadequacies and risks so that the restrictions and limitations . . . may be relaxed or removed \n8\nas soon as possible,” 82 Fed. Reg. at 45164, § 1(h), as happened with Chad. A.R. 185-87, 320. \n9\nShort of that, however, the Proclamation contemplates that the restrictions must stay in place, “both \n10\nto protect national security and public safety, and to induce improvements by [the identified] \n11\ncountries.” See Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2409. The Supreme Court expressly upheld the Proclamation \n12\nbased on this rationale. Id. at 2410. \n13\nA substantial portion of the guidance to consular officers concerns this security vetting—\n14\nand most of that is classified or law enforcement sensitive because, if disclosed, just as with \n15\nsecurity vetting in other visa contexts, it would create the highest risk of providing a roadmap for \n16\nmalign actors intent on defrauding the government to skirt the national security and public safety \n17\nchecks. See, e.g., A.R. 9-10 (9 F.A.M. 302.14-10(E)(2) (redacted material detailing steps for \n18\nconsular officer to take in conducting security vetting)); A.R. 39, 41-42, 50, 70-71, 79-80, 159-62 \n19\n(same); A.R. 183 (referencing classified guidance); see also Dkt. No. ¶ 77 n.7 (discussing \n20\nanalogous administrative processing procedures). The primary public-facing cable addressing this \n21\nvetting is 17 STATE 56801, with unclassified excerpts appearing at A.R. 157-162. This cable \n22\nshows that a substantial manual investigation by the consular officer is needed in each case, who \n23\nconsiders an exceedingly broad swath of information from interagency partners before rendering \n24\na judgment as to whether the applicant poses a security threat. See A.R. 157. In doing this, \n25\n“consular  officers  must  understand  the  specific  circumstances  that  led  to  each  [identified] \n26\ncountry’s designation as inadequate,” including information relating to the likelihood a passport \n27\ncould be fraudulent, and whether the country shares information regarding identity, criminal \n28\n16 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 98   Filed 06/13/19   Page 22 of 30\n \n \n1\nhistory, or suspected terrorists. A.R. 157-58. Given these concerns about identity management that \n2\ngave rise to the Proclamation, this requires “a case by case determination to verify that an \n3\napplicant’s identity as recorded in a passport is bona fide and that there is no indication that he or \n4\nshe has engaged in terrorist or criminal activities.” A.R. 157. This individual investigation is \n5\n“resource intensive for posts and interagency partners.” Id. The guidance makes it clear that \n6\nconsular officials are to provide case notes assessing this factor based on their investigation and \n7\nconsultation with partners and foreign governments. A.R. 79-80, 169. While this process is \n8\n“resource intensive,” it is not a “sham,” and it is one that ultimately results in a judgment made by \n9\nthe consular officer. A.R. 157. \n10\nGiven that the entry restrictions were introduced specifically to redress the “significant \n11\ngaps” in the identity-management and information-sharing practices of several countries, see 82 \n12\nFed. Reg. at 45164, § 1(h)(ii), it would run counter to the very purpose and design of the \n13\nProclamation not to consider those gaps when adjudicating visa applications from affected foreign \n14\nnationals. Further, while the first two prongs can be assessed relatively quickly on the materials \n15\nand statements submitted by the applicant, the third component of the waiver analysis may take \n16\nconsiderably  more  time—challenging  consular  officers  not  only  to  probe  the  applicant’s \n17\nbackground for fraud, criminal, or terrorist concerns, but also to scrutinize the gathered evidence \n18\nin  light  of  the  conditions  that  led  the  applicant’s  country  to  be  “deemed  ‘inadequate’  on \n19\ninformation sharing” in the first place. See A.R. 157. The patient and thorough approach adopted \n20\nby  consular  officers  to  investigate  applicants  for  security  concerns  reflects  the  good  faith \n21\nimplementation of a Proclamation designed to eliminate national security risks in cases where \n22\ninformation sharing or cooperation is inadequate, and that extensive effort is not what one would \n23\nexpect if the process were in fact a “sham.”  \n24\nc.  Consular officers’ function in adjudicating waivers \n25\nThe central role afforded to consular officers, and the presumption of regularity that their \n26\ndecisions enjoy, also shows that the waiver process is not a sham. Throughout the record, there is \n27\na clear recognition that consular officers are authorized to make, and in fact are the ones actually \n28\n17 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 98   Filed 06/13/19   Page 23 of 30\n \n \n1\nmaking,  waiver  decisions  with  respect  to  visa  applicants  on  a  case-by-case  basis.  The \n2\nProclamation’s direction that consular officers have discretion to adjudicate waivers is reiterated \n3\nthroughout various internal guidance—perhaps most prominently in the Foreign Affairs Manual \n4\n(“FAM”), which punctuates that no waiver can be granted until the consular officer is satisfied that \n5\nthe applicant has met all three waiver conditions.4 See A.R. 7-11. More than once, the FAM makes \n6\nsure to directly address consular officers while setting out waiver-related guidance, leaving no \n7\nuncertainty as to who is responsible for assessing waiver eligibility and adjudicating visas in \n8\nindividual cases. See, e.g., A.R. 7 (“You must determine whether the applicant may qualify for a \n9\nwaiver” (emphasis added)); A.R. 9 (“If the applicant qualifies for a waiver, you may issue the \n10\nvisa.” (emphasis added)). \n11\nSimilarly, the Q&As make plain that “Consular officers may grant waivers on a case-by-\n12\ncase basis when the applicant demonstrates to the officer’s satisfaction that the [waiver] criteria \n13\napply.” A.R. 19 (emphasis added). Some of the Q&As provide for consultation with supervisors \n14\nsuch as the visa chief or the consular section chief at the consular post, see A.R. 131—but those \n15\nsupervisory personnel are generally also consular officers at the post who themselves adjudicate \n16\nvisas and waivers.5 A.R. 19, 39, 68, 99, 131. And while consular officers may find themselves \n17\nconsulting with interagency partners at certain points in the process—especially during the process \n18\nof national security vetting, where information from interagency partners is critical—they do not \n19\nrelinquish any of their discretion in applying the waiver criteria to the applicant’s case, including \n20\nin relation to the third prong. A.R. 157-59. As the guidance makes clear, an applicant must \n21\n“demonstrate[] to the [consular] officer’s satisfaction” that her entry would pose no threat to \n22\nnational security or public safety before a waiver can be granted. A.R. 19, 38, 67, 130-31. \n23\n  Plaintiffs rely heavily on the uncorroborated statements of a former State Department \n24\n                                                 \n25\n4 The FAM constitutes a “single, comprehensive, and authoritative source” for the State Department’s governing \n26 policies and “convey[s] codified information” for agency personnel to “carry out their responsibilities in accordance \nwith statutory, executive and Department mandates.” See U.S. Department of State, Foreign Affairs Manual and \n27 Handbook, available at https://fam.state.gov/. \n5 According to the Q&As, “[s]ole consular officers do not need concurrence from their supervisor for waivers or \n28\nexceptions, but should seek [visa office] concurrence on their decisions to grant waivers.” A.R. 23, 50, 80, 111, 143. \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 98   Filed 06/13/19   Page 24 of 30\n \n \n1\nemployee, Christopher Richardson, who alleged many months ago, in a different case, without \n2\nbeing subject to adversarial, that consular officers are shut out from the decision-making process \n3\nto grant or deny waivers. See generally SAC ¶¶ 3, 67, 72, 75, 90-93. According to Richardson, “it \n4\nis understood that there really is no waiver [process]” and consular officers are forced “to \n5\ndetermine at all possible cost” that all applicants are ineligible “to even apply for a waiver.” See, \n6\ne.g., Dkt. No. 77-3; SAC ¶ 91. But Richardson’s qualifications to opine on the waiver process are \n7\ndubious at best. Before he retired from the Department in March of 2018—just a few months after \n8\nthe Proclamation went into effect—he served as the American Citizens Services Chief at the U.S. \n9\nEmbassy in Madrid. Id. ¶ 155. Spain is not one of the countries of concern identified in the \n10\nProclamation, nor do American citizens apply for visas as they must travel with passports. See \n11\n8 U.S.C. § 1185(b) (providing that “it shall be unlawful for any citizen of the United States to \n12\ndepart from or enter, or attempt to depart from or enter, the United States unless he bears a valid \n13\nUnited states passport”). Richardson also does not claim that he adjudicated visa applications, \n14\napplied the Proclamation, or ever played any part in carrying out the Proclamation’s waiver \n15\nprovision, and his credentials suggest that he did not. In short, other than Richardson’s vague \n16\nconjecture that the waiver process somehow is a sham, Plaintiffs point to nothing that would allow \n17\nthis Court to reasonably conclude that consular officers—despite all the record evidence to the \n18\ncontrary—have been directed to deny all waiver applications and disregard the hundreds of pages \n19\nof guidance that are included in the administrative record.6 Richardson’s declaration was before \n20\nthe court in Alharbi v. Miller, No. 17-cv-2435-BMC (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 25, 2018), Dkt. No. 42-2, but \n21\nthe court dismissed that case after finding that the plaintiffs there had made no plausible or \n22\nparticular allegations of bad faith by agency actors. Id., Dkt. No. 82, at 26. \n23\nThus, while consular officers may at times have to confer with supervisors or agency \n24\npartners, especially with respect to the resource-intensive national security assessment, that \n25\ncollaborative element does not alter the fact that the consular officer oversees all steps of the waiver \n26\n                                                 \n27\n6 Plaintiffs refer to statements from other former consular officers as evidence of a fraudulent waiver process. See, \n28\ne.g., SAC ¶ 89. But because Plaintiffs never identify these individuals, their alleged statements should hold no weight.  \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 98   Filed 06/13/19   Page 25 of 30\n \n \n1\nadjudication  and  ultimately  decides  in  her  discretion  to  grant  or  deny  a  waiver  under  the \n2\nProclamation. A.R. 157. \n3\nd.  Application process \n4\nThe application process further confirms that implementation of the waiver provision is \n5\nnot a sham by ensuring that all individuals subject to the Proclamation receive full consideration \n6\nfor a waiver as a matter of course. While the waiver provision places the burden on the applicant \n7\nto demonstrate to the satisfaction of the consular officer that a waiver is warranted, “[t]here is no \n8\nseparate application for a waiver. An individual who seeks to travel to the United States should \n9\napply for a visa and disclose during the visa interview any information that might demonstrate that \n10\nhe or she is eligible for a waiver.” State Dep’t Website. This unitary process, whereby applicants \n11\nrefused visas under the Proclamation are still considered for a waiver with an opportunity to \n12\nprovide relevant information but without any further action on their end, is consistent with the \n13\nterms of the Proclamation, which does not dictate any particular method by which consular officers \n14\nmust consider waiver eligibility, but mandates only that waiver eligibility be considered. See 82 \n15\nFed. Reg. at 45168, § 3(c). Indeed, requiring applicants to file a separate application for a waiver, \n16\nwith largely duplicative evidence, would burden both the applicant and the consular officer, who \n17\nin any case would have to interview the applicant on his larger request for a visa. An automatic \n18\nprocess, on the other hand, streamlines application processing and prevents applicants from being \n19\npenalized for being unfamiliar with the general framework of the Proclamation and the ways in \n20\nwhich its various parts intersect. \n21\nAs to the argument that a separate waiver form, however onerous, could enable applicants \n22\nto provide more evidence in support of their claim than through a unitary visa application, the State \n23\nDepartment has made sure to give public notice that applicants, during the visa interview, should \n24\ndisclose “any information that might demonstrate that he or she is eligible for a waiver.” State \n25\nDep’t Website. Further, as amply shown above, consular officers are reminded regularly that the \n26\nProclamation itself mandates that refused visa applicants be considered for waivers, and there is \n27\nno evidence that they have ever attempted to disobey that express directive. The first two waiver \n28\n20 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 98   Filed 06/13/19   Page 26 of 30\n \n \n1\nprongs,  in  any  case,  can  be  evaluated  through  relatively  straightforward  inquiries  of  the \n2\napplicant—and the visa applicant is provided the information needed to substantiate a claim of \n3\nsevere hardship or other compelling reason for wanting to travel to the United States.7 And should \n4\nthe applicant still, for some reason, believe that she had been deprived of a full opportunity to \n5\nestablish her case for a visa, the regulations allow her to present further evidence regarding her \n6\neligibility to the consular officer who adjudicated his case for up to one year from the date of her \n7\nrefusal. See 22 C.F.R. § 42.81(e). \n8\nSome of the named Plaintiffs allege that they submitted visa applications and were \n9\ninterviewed on those applications before the Proclamation went into effect and thus were never \n10\nproperly considered for waivers. Dkt. No. 81, ¶¶ 22, 77, 196, 251, 260, 278, 314. That allegation \n11\nis unfounded and, in any case, confuted by the record. As their individual declarations show, those \n12\nPlaintiffs had their applications readjudicated after the Proclamation took effect. They were \n13\nrefused visas under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f) pursuant to the Proclamation and automatically considered \n14\nfor waivers. A.R. 347 60, ¶¶ 5, 6, 7, 9, 11-13, 20, 22 24, 26, 28. Some of those Plaintiffs were \n15\ndenied waivers after failing to meet the mandatory criteria, while others are still undergoing \n16\nconsideration for a waiver of the Proclamation’s entry restrictions. If anything, the orderly way in \n17\nwhich  all  Plaintiffs’  cases  have  been  handled—irrespective  of  when  they  arose—plainly \n18\ndemonstrates that Defendants are implementing the waiver process. \n19\ne.  Waiver-related statistics \n20\nStatistics relating to the implementation of the Proclamation unmistakably demonstrate that \n21\nthe waiver process is not a sham. According to data recently released in the quarterly State \n22\nDepartment report on the waiver process, consular officers, between December 8, 2017, and March \n23                                                  \n7 Because the first two waiver prongs demand an inquiry into individual facts and can best be assessed by the consular \n24\nofficer, who is directly presented with the applicant’s evidence, it is unsurprising that much of the State Department’s \npublicly available guidance pertain to undue hardship and national interest. See A.R. 19, 38, 67, 98, 131 (each \n25\nexplaining that “[t]he requirement for issuance to be in the national interest may be met if a U.S. person or entity \nwould suffer hardship if the applicant could not travel until after visa restrictions imposed with respect to nationals of \n26\nthat country are lifted” (emphasis in original)). Those prongs intersect where “[t]he required level of hardship to an \napplicant may vary with the level of U.S. national interest in facilitating the applicant’s travel to the United States.” \n27\nA.R. 140. Thus, “[w]hen assessing national interest, consular officers should consider hardship suffered by a U.S. \nperson or entity . . . . If an applicant’s travel is related to a program or policy objective of the U.S. government, then \n28\nthe national interest can be considered higher, and the hardship to the applicant would not need to be as severe.” Id. \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 98   Filed 06/13/19   Page 27 of 30\n \n \n1\n31, 2019, received 178,681 visa applications from nationals of the affected countries. State Dep’t \n2\nReport, at 7-16. Of those, only 60,275 applications—or about a third of all applications—were \n3\naffected by the Proclamation. Id. And of those 60,275 affected applicants, 10,734 were refused \n4\nvisas for reasons unrelated to the Proclamation, whereas 6,893 were issued visas under the \n5\nProclamation, including 3,071 applicants as a result of a waiver. Id. at 16-20, 26-36. Those 3,071 \n6\nindividuals were granted waivers after having been found to meet all three waiver criteria—a figure \n7\nthat represents approximately 6.7 percent of all applications considered for a waiver under the \n8\nProclamation. Id. at 3. Notably, more than 12,000 applicants—or over 26 percent of those \n9\nconsidered for waivers—have been found to meet the first two waiver prongs and are currently \n10\nundergoing a manual “interagency security review to resolve whether their entry would not pose \n11\na threat to the national security or public safety.” Id. As we have explained, it is that vetting that \n12\nis most time-consuming and that has led to frustration by applicants. Thus, contrary to Plaintiffs’ \n13\nsuggestion of a blanket waiver denial policy, the evidence demonstrates that there are applicants \n14\ncurrently occupying every stage of the multi-step waiver process, and proceeding through that \n15\nprocess in a structured way.  \n16\nPlaintiffs also refer to some statistical data—from early 2018, just a few months after the \n17\nProclamation went into effect—to allege that Defendants have adopted a blanket denial policy. \n18\nDkt. No. 1 ¶¶ 136-54. Plaintiffs, in fact, rest much of their case on those expired statistics, arguing \n19\nthat because “only an exceedingly small number of visa applicants are actually granted waivers,” \n20\nthe figures “confirm that [the waiver process] is, indeed, window dressing.” Id. ¶ 138. Although \n21\nthe referenced data in fact reveals that, even in the Proclamation’s incipiency, applicants were \n22\nbeing processed and cleared for waivers, Plaintiffs insinuate that the number of waiver grants \n23\nduring  that  period  was  either  too  low  or  contrived.  Id.  ¶¶ 139-41,  145  (claiming  that  the \n24\ngovernment “appeared to start granting waivers at a relatively faster rate” in light of developments \n25\nin Hawaii), 148-50. In doing so, however, Plaintiffs divorce the waiver statistics from the only \n26\ncontext in which those numbers can be properly viewed. Statistics from the very beginning of the \n27\nwaiver process, just as the program was being developed and implemented after the Supreme Court \n28\n22 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 98   Filed 06/13/19   Page 28 of 30\n \n \n1\ngranted  a  stay  that  permitted  the  Proclamation  to  take  effect  in  December  2017,  are  not \n2\nrepresentative and should be given little weight by this Court. Indeed, the numerical cherry-picking \n3\nin which Plaintiffs engage—suggesting, for example, that the waiver process is irregular simply \n4\nbecause “less than 2% of visa applicants . . . had been granted waivers as of April 30, 2018”— is \n5\nbased on information that the Supreme Court had before it and represents the kind of statistical \n6\nmanipulation that the Supreme Court expressly disfavored in Hawaii. See id. at 2423 n.7. If \n7\nPlaintiffs had their way, this Court would be put in the untenable position of determining whether \n8\nthe number of waiver grants, which naturally changes over time, is somehow too low—an \n9\nimpossible task that the Court should decline to take on. \n10\nIn citing waiver statistics to challenge the waiver process, Plaintiffs also misapprehend the \n11\nbasic framework in which waiver adjudications take place. As discussed above, no waiver can be \n12\ngranted until a consular officer has made an individualized determination that the applicant has \n13\nmet the three criteria set out in the Proclamation—to wit, undue burden, national interest, and \n14\nnational security/public safety. See 82 Fed. Reg. at 45168, § 3(c). It is a wide and exhaustive \n15\nundertaking—so much so that the refusal letters provided to visa applicants who remain eligible \n16\nfor waivers forewarn that the waiver assessment “can be a lengthy process.” A.R. 10, 11, 152, 340, \n17\n341; see Singh v. Still, 470 F. Supp. 2d 1064, 1068 (N.D. Cal. 2007) (holding that in determining \n18\nwhether an agency has unreasonably delayed in processing an immigration application, courts \n19\ntypically look to “the source of the delay—e.g., the complexity of the investigation as well as the \n20\nextent  to  which  the  defendant  participated  in  delaying  the  proceeding”).  Even  before  the \n21\nProclamation’s promulgation, case-by-case adjudications of visa petitions frequently took months, \n22\nin part, because of required background checks. See I.N.S. v. Miranda, 459 U.S. 14, 15, 18 (1982) \n23\n(finding that INS’s failure to act on immigrant visa petition for eighteen months did not constitute \n24\nunreasonable delay because of “the number of the applications received by the INS and the need \n25\nto  investigate  their  validity”);  Sayyadinejead  v.  Chertoff,  No.  07-cv-0631-JAH,  2007  WL \n26\n4410356, at *6 (S.D. Cal. Dec. 14, 2007) (finding that, despite a delay of three years on account \n27\nof FBI background checks, USCIS and the FBI were “taking reasonable precautions as public \n28\n23 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 98   Filed 06/13/19   Page 29 of 30\n \n \n1\nsafety require[d] them to do, and [were] also doing everything possible to ensure that the [p]laintiff \n2\nwait[ed] no longer than necessary to receive permanent status”). Thus, while Plaintiffs complain \n3\nabout what they deem to be excessively low numbers of waiver grants, they fail to consider that \n4\nthose statistics are entwined with the time it takes to thoroughly complete each individual waiver \n5\nadjudication. And it is not unreasonable that the waiver statistics, thus far, have not been any \n6\nhigher, where consular officers must adjudicate a daunting volume of waiver applications and \n7\nendeavor “to mitigate the risks” to national security and public safety that might attend any one of \n8\nthose determinations. A.R. 169, 180. \n9\nPlaintiffs, in short, proffer only “selective statistics” and “anecdotal evidence” to protest \n10\nthat “not enough individuals are receiving waivers.” See Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2423 n.7. Their \n11\ncomplaint, at bottom, is rooted simply in their dissatisfaction with the rate at which consular \n12\nofficers have adjudicated waiver applications and the number of waivers that those officers have \n13\ngranted. Courts have declined to step in in individual cases where adjudications of similar requests \n14\nhave taken years—this Court should likewise decline to oversee a challenging and multi-faceted \n15\nwaiver process where many cases are delayed due to essential national security vetting. Plaintiffs’ \n16\nclaims relating to delay are far too meager to go forward, especially where they have not proffered \n17\nany evidence or viable claim that the government has failed to comply with its own waiver \n18\nguidance and procedures. \n19\n*** \n20\n  Incidentally, the sound implementation of the waiver provision can also be seen in the case \n21\nhistories of Plaintiffs themselves. Notably, one Plaintiff has been granted an immigrant visa based \n22\non her qualification for a waiver. A.R. at 347-59 ¶ 12. Of the 26 plaintiffs for whom the State \n23\nDepartment compiled information regarding their visa applications, consular officers determined \n24\nthat 12 of them met the first two waiver prongs of hardship and national interest. Id. ¶¶ 4, 7, 8, 9, \n25 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 22. Although further vetting with respect to the third prong remains for \n26 these Plaintiffs, should the consular officers adjudicating their applications find that they would \n27 not pose a threat to national security or public safety, they would likely be granted waivers, absent \n28 any other eligibility concerns. Aside from one plaintiff who was refused a visa for a reason \n24 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 98   Filed 06/13/19   Page 30 of 30\n \n \n1\nunrelated to the Proclamation, id. ¶ 21, the remaining Plaintiffs were denied waivers after having \n2\nfailed to meet one or both of the first two waiver prongs, id. ¶¶ 5, 6, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, \n3\n28,  29.  The  different  positions  that  Plaintiffs—and  all  other  applicants  covered  by  the \n4\nProclamation—currently occupy in relation to their visa proceedings illustrate that the waiver \n5\nprocess, far from being aimless or stagnant, has been moving deliberately apace, through the \n6 combined efforts of the agencies. \n7   In short, the administrative record and publicly available information showing thousands \n8 of granted waivers decisively refute Plaintiffs’ allegations that the State Department has not \n9 followed its own guidance, or has instituted a “sham” waiver process. Defendants are entitled to \n10 summary judgment on the Accardi claim—the only claim that this Court permitted to go forward \n11 in its prior order. \n12 V.  CONCLUSION \n13    For the foregoing reasons, the Court should dismiss Plaintiffs’ SAC with prejudice or grant \n14 summary judgment to Defendants. \n15 Dated: June 13, 2019     JOSEPH H.

Presidential  Proclamation  9645  issued  on  September  24,  2017  (“the  Proclamation”) \n11 \nprohibits the entry of all immigrants and certain categories of non-immigrants for nationals of Iran, \n12 \nLibya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen.1 The Proclamation provides for case-by-case waivers from the \n13 \nban for individuals who can “demonstrate” that denial of entry “would cause undue hardship, . . . \n14 \nwould not pose a threat to national security, . . . and would be in the national interest.” Ex. A, \n15 \nPresidential Proclamation No. 9645, 82 Fed. Reg. 45161 (Sept. 27, 2017), § 3(c). The Proclamation \n16 \nprovides several examples of circumstances in which waivers may be appropriate, and further \n17 \nrequires  the Secretary  of  State  and  the Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  to  adopt  guidance \n18 \nestablishing when waivers may be appropriate for foreign nationals who would otherwise be \n19 \nbanned.  \n20 \n21  2.  To date, however, no meaningful guidance has been issued or publicly promulgated. The \n22  agencies do not appear to have established—and certainly have not provided information to the \n23 \n                                                \n \n24 \n1 Under the terms of the Proclamation, all Syrian nationals are banned; all Libyan and Yemeni nationals seeking \nimmigrant or non-immigrant B1/B2 visas are banned; all Iranian nationals except non-immigrants seeking F, M, or J \n25 \nvisas are banned; and all Somali nationals seeking immigrant visas are banned.  \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 2 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 3 of 68\n  \n1  public about—waiver application procedures that are accessible to visa applicants. To the extent \n2  guidance has been issued, it has been confusing, contradictory, in conflict with the terms of the \n3 \nProclamation, or seemingly designed to result in the denial of meritorious applications. Such \n4 \nguidance also has failed to provide for a mechanism by which individuals may “demonstrate”—\n5 \nas the Proclamation says they must—that they meet the eligibility criteria described in the \n6 \nProclamation. Id. \n7 \n3.  Immediately  after  the  Proclamation  first  went  fully  into  effect  in  December  2017, \n8 \nthousands of individuals, including many plaintiffs in this action, reported receiving blanket, \n9 \nboilerplate denials of both visas and waivers, most before ever having had an opportunity to apply \n10 \nfor a waiver or to “demonstrate” their eligibility. Individuals denied waivers include those who \n11 \nhad previously been informed by U.S. consular officials that their visas had been approved. Others \n12 \nwere informed that their eligibility for a waiver is being considered, but have been waiting for \n13 \nmonths or more than a year without a decision in their cases. Both public reports and the latest \n14 \n15  government statistics illustrate that the number of waiver grants has been “a minuscule percentage” \n16  of those eligible for visas. Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. ___, 138 S. Ct. 2392, 2431 (2018) (Breyer, \n17  J., dissenting). By all indications, the waiver process has been a fraud. See, e.g., Ex. B, Decl. of \n18 \nChristopher  Richardson,  Esq.  (“Richardson  Decl.”),  Alharbi  v.  Miller,  No.  1:18-cv-02435 \n19 \n(E.D.N.Y. filed Apr. 25, 2018), ECF No. 24-2.      \n20 \n4.  Plaintiffs and putative class members are U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and \n21 \nIranian, Libyan, Somali, Syrian, and Yemeni foreign nationals whose visa applications have been \n22 \ndenied or stalled by the government’s failure to provide fair and meaningful access to case-by-\n23 \ncase waivers. Many have approved visa petitions for their family members; others have family \n24 \nmembers who have applied for immigrant or non-immigrant visas and been summarily denied or \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 3 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 4 of 68\n  \n1  indefinitely stalled; and others have applied for business-related or extraordinary ability visas to \n2  the United States. All seek entry to the United States to be reunited with their families or because \n3 \nof significant business or professional relationships in the United States.  \n4 \n5.  Based upon all available data and information, Defendants have adopted a policy or \n5 \npractice of not instituting an orderly waiver process through which individuals may “demonstrate,” \n6 \nas stated in the Proclamation, their eligibility for a case-by-case waiver. Ex. A, § 3(c). \n7 \n6.  Defendants have further adopted a policy or practice of not providing information about \n8 \nthe waiver process and have thereby hindered Plaintiffs’ and their family members’ ability to make \n9 \na showing that they meet the relevant criteria.  \n10 \n7.  Defendants have also adopted a policy or practice of denying or stalling virtually all visa \n11 \nissuance and waiver grants under the Proclamation, and have not given consular officials the \n12 \ndiscretion to grant any waivers.  \n13 \n8.  As  set  forth  below,  the  government’s failure  to  provide  a  meaningful,  orderly,  and \n14 \n15  accessible process through which individuals covered by the ban can demonstrate their eligibility \n16  for a waiver violates the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) and Plaintiffs’ right to due process \n17  under the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  \n18 \n9.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs request that this Court order Defendants to provide clear guidance \n19 \nand an orderly process by which applicants may demonstrate their eligibility for a waiver; evaluate \n20 \nwhether applicants previously denied waivers under an unlawful policy should be reconsidered for \n21 \na waiver grant; act on waivers that have been pending for an unreasonable period of time; and give \n22 \nfull consideration for case-by-case waivers to all visa applicants as set forth in the Proclamation.  \n23 \n \n24 \n \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 4 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 5 of 68\n  \n1  CLASS DEFINITION \n2  10.  Plaintiffs bring this case as a class action under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and \n3 \n(b), on behalf of the following two subclasses: (i) the “Family Member Class” and (ii) the “Visa \n4 \nApplicant Class.” \n5 \n11.  The Family Member Class is comprised of United States citizens and lawful permanent \n6 \nresidents with approved family-based visa petitions or whose family members have applied for \n7 \nvisa categories covered by the ban, and whose family members have been or will be refused \n8 \npursuant to the Proclamation without an opportunity to apply for and be meaningfully considered \n9 \nfor a waiver or are awaiting adjudication of a waiver. \n10 \n12.  The Visa Applicant Class is comprised of Iranian, Libyan, Somali, Syrian, and Yemeni \n11 \nnationals who have applied for immigrant or nonimmigrant visas that have been or will be refused \n12 \npursuant to the Proclamation without the opportunity to apply for and be meaningfully considered \n13 \nfor a waiver or who are awaiting adjudication of a waiver. \n14 \n15  JURISDICTION, VENUE, AND INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT \n16  13.  Jurisdiction is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question), 28 U.S.C. § 1361 \n17  (Mandamus and Venue Act of 1962), 5 U.S.C. § 702 (APA), and 28 U.S.C. § 2201 (Declaratory \n18 \nJudgment Act). The United States has waived its sovereign immunity pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 702. \n19 \nThis Court may grant declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 702, 28 U.S.C. § \n20 \n1651, and 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–2202.  \n21 \n14.  Venue is proper in the Northern District of California under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because \n22 \nDefendants are officers or employees of the United States acting in their official capacities and \n23 \nagencies of the United States; some Plaintiffs reside in this judicial district; and no real property \n24 \nis involved in this action. Plaintiffs have exhausted all administrative remedies. \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 5 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 6 of 68\n  \n1  15.  Intradistrict assignment is proper in the San Francisco Division because a substantial part \n2  of the events or omissions that give rise to the claim occurred in San Francisco and Napa Counties.  \n3 \nCivil L.

The  Proclamation  puts  in  place  an  indefinite  travel  ban  on  most  nationals  of  five2 \n11 \npredominantly  Muslim  countries,  including  all  immigrants  and  various  categories  of  non-\n12 \nimmigrants  from  each  of  the  enumerated  countries.3 Alongside  these  entry  restrictions,  the \n13 \nProclamation provides for a waiver that may be granted on a case-by-case basis to individuals who \n14 \n15  meet three specific criteria.4 Ex. A, § 3(c); infra Section II. \n16  56.  The Proclamation was challenged in court, and before its effective date, two district courts \n17  issued nationwide injunctions prohibiting implementation of the ban against individuals with \n18 \n19 \n                                                \n \n20 \n2 The Proclamation originally included six Muslim-majority countries: Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and \nYemen.

The Proclamation also prevents entry of certain Venezuelan \n22  government officials and their family members and of all North Korean nationals. See Ex. A, § 2(d), (f). \n \n23  3 Under the terms of the Proclamation, all Syrian nationals are banned; all Libyan and Yemeni nationals seeking \nimmigrant or non-immigrant B1/B2 visas are banned; all Iranian nationals except non-immigrants seeking F, M, or J \nvisas are banned; and all Somali nationals seeking immigrant visas are banned.  \n24 \n \n4 The Second Executive Order created a waiver process, Exec.

On December 4, 2017, the Supreme Court granted Defendants’ application for a stay \n4 \nof the preliminary injunctions entered by the district courts, allowing full implementation of the \n5 \ntravel ban to proceed. See Trump v. Int’l Refugee Assistance Project, 138 S. Ct. 542 (2017). The \n6 \nSupreme Court subsequently reversed the preliminary injunction and allowed the Proclamation to \n7 \nremain fully in effect. Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. ___, 138 S. Ct. 2392 (2018). The Court found \n8 \nthat the Proclamation likely did not violate the Constitution, in part because of the existence of a \n9 \ncase-by-case waiver process that provides for individualized consideration of every visa applicant. \n10 \nId. at 2422-23.  \n11 \n57.  Since December 4, 2017, the Proclamation has been in full effect, and the only means by \n12 \nwhich covered individuals from the banned countries may enter the United States is through grant \n13 \nof a case-by-case waiver.   \n14 \n15  II.  Case-by-Case Waivers under the Proclamation  \n16  58.  Section 3 of the Proclamation contains a subsection entitled “Waivers,” which states: \n17  Notwithstanding the suspensions of and limitations on entry set \nforth in section 2 of this proclamation, a consular officer, or the \n18  Commissioner,  United  States  Customs  and  Border  Protection \n(CBP), or the Commissioner’s designee, as appropriate, may, in \n19 \ntheir discretion, grant waivers on a case-by-case basis to permit the \nentry of foreign nationals for whom entry is otherwise suspended or \n20 \nlimited if such foreign nationals demonstrate that waivers would be \nappropriate and consistent with subsections (i) through (iv) of this \n21 \nsubsection [laying out waiver standards].  \n \n22 \nEx. A, § 3(c). \n23 \n59.  The Proclamation explains that a waiver may be granted if, in a consular officer’s or CBP’s \n24 \ndiscretion, a foreign national has demonstrated that: (1) denial of entry “would cause the foreign \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 13 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 14 of 68\n  \n1  national undue hardship”; (2) his or her “entry would not pose a threat to the national security or \n2  public safety of the United States”; and (3) his or her “entry would be in the national interest.” Id. \n3 \n§ 3(c)(i). \n4 \n60.  The Proclamation then specifies that while “[c]ase-by-case waivers may not be granted \n5 \ncategorically,” they “may be appropriate, subject to the limitations, conditions, and requirements \n6 \nset forth” in subsection (c), “in individual circumstances ….” Id. § 3(c)(iv). It proceeds to give a \n7 \ngenerous list of non-exhaustive examples of circumstances under which issuance of a waiver may \n8 \nbe appropriate, including:  \n9 \n(A) the foreign national has previously been admitted to the United \n10  States for a continuous period of work, study, or other long-term \nactivity, is outside the United States on the applicable effective date \n11 \n… of this proclamation, seeks to reenter the United States to resume \nthat activity, and the denial of reentry would impair that activity;  \n12 \n \n(B)  the  foreign  national  has  previously  established  significant \n13 \ncontacts with the United States but is outside the United States on \nthe applicable effective date ... of this proclamation for work, study, \n14 \nor other lawful activity; \n15   \n(C)  the  foreign  national  seeks  to  enter  the  United  States  for \n16  significant business or professional obligations and the denial of \nentry would impair those obligations; \n17   \n(D) the foreign national seeks to enter the United States to visit or \n18  reside with a close family member (e.g., a spouse, child, or parent) \nwho is a United States citizen, lawful permanent resident, or alien \n19 \nlawfully admitted on a valid nonimmigrant visa, and the denial of \nentry would cause the foreign national undue hardship; \n20 \n \n(E) the foreign national is an infant, a young child or adoptee, an \n21 \nindividual needing urgent medical care, or someone whose entry is \notherwise justified by the special circumstances of the case …. \n22 \n \n23  Id. \n24 \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 14 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 15 of 68\n  \n1  61.  The  Proclamation  also  instructs  that,  “[t]he  Secretary  of State  and  the  Secretary  of \n2  Homeland Security shall coordinate to adopt guidance addressing the circumstances in which \n3 \nwaivers may be appropriate for foreign nationals seeking entry as immigrants or nonimmigrants.” \n4 \nId. § 3(c). It further directs the Secretaries to:  \n5 \n[A]ddress the standards, policies and procedures for: \n \n6 \n(A) determining whether the entry of a foreign national would not \npose a threat to the national security or public safety of the United \n7 \nStates; \n8   \n(B) determining whether the entry of a foreign national would be in \n9  the national interest; \n \n10  (C)  addressing  and  managing  the  risks  of  making  such  a \ndetermination in light of the inadequacies in information sharing, \n11 \nidentity management, and other potential dangers posed by the \nnationals  of  individual  countries  subject  to  the  restrictions  and \n12 \nlimitations imposed by this proclamation; \n \n13 \n(D) assessing whether the United States has access, at the time of \nthe waiver determination, to sufficient information about the foreign \n14 \nnational to determine whether entry would satisfy the requirements \n15  of subsection (i) of this subsection; and  \n \n16  (E)  determining  the  special  circumstances  that  would  justify \ngranting a waiver under subsection (iv)(E) of this subsection. \n17   \nId. § 3(c)(ii). \n18 \nIII.  Agency Guidance and Implementation \n19 \n \n62.  The Proclamation directs the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to \n20 \ndevelop specific guidance for consular officers and visa applicants on how the waiver provisions \n21 \nwill be implemented. Id. § 3(c). \n22 \n23  63.  Despite this clear mandate, the agencies have failed to provide meaningful guidance that \n24  sheds light on the waiver process or provides applicants with an orderly way to access that process. \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 15 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 16 of 68\n  \n1  See Washington v. Trump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1169 (9th Cir. 2017) (“The Government … has offered \n2  no explanation for how these [discretionary waiver] provisions would function in practice: how \n3 \nwould the ‘national interest’ be determined, who would make that determination, and when?”).  \n4 \n64.  After the Supreme Court’s lifting of the stays on the Proclamation, the State Department \n5 \nissued, through its website, some minimal instructions regarding its immediate implementation. \n6 \nEx. C, U.S. Dep’t of State, New Court Order on Presidential Proclamation (Dec. 4, 2017). That \n7 \nposting stated that consular officers will review eligibility for a waiver at the time of an applicant’s \n8 \ninterview. Id. But it did not explain how waivers would be adjudicated for individuals who had \n9 \nalready had their interviews and, as set forth more fully below, it did not answer any critical \n10 \nquestions about how individuals may apply for a waiver and how they may “demonstrate” their \n11 \neligibility for a waiver.  \n12 \n65.  All  available  evidence  shows  that  Defendants  are  not  providing  any  meaningful \n13 \nindividualized consideration of waiver applicants’ eligibility. Just days after the Proclamation went \n14 \n15  into effect, several organizations and attorneys, including undersigned counsel, began receiving \n16  reports from individuals covered by the ban of pro forma, mass denials of both visas and waivers \n17  by consular offices in Armenia, Turkey, Djibouti, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and elsewhere. See Yeganeh \n18 \nTorbati & Mica Rosenberg, Exclusive: Visa Waivers Rarely Granted under Trump's Latest U.S. \n19 \nTravel Ban: Data, Reuters (Mar. 6, 2018), https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-\n20 \ntravelban-exclusive/  exclusive-visa-waivers-  rarely-granted-under-trumps-latest-u-s-travel-ban-\n21 \ndata-idUSKCN1GI2DW; Ex. D, Decl. of Jay Gairson (“Gairson Decl.”); infra Section IV. Many \n22 \nof the individuals who were notified that they had been denied waivers, including Plaintiffs in this \n23 \naction, had never been informed about or provided an opportunity to apply for a waiver. See infra \n24 \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 16 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 17 of 68\n  \n1  Section IV. Automatically denied individuals included those who had previously been informed \n2  that their visas had been approved. See infra Section IV. \n3 \nA. The Guidance Provided by Federal Officials About the Waiver Process Has Been \nNon-Existent or Conflicting.      \n4 \n \n66.  After the Proclamation went into effect in December 2017, visa applicants immediately \n5 \nbegan to contact embassies and consulates abroad to ask for guidance and clarification, but \n6 \nreceived no response or standard automated responses that did not address their questions or \n7 \n8  provide meaningful information. See infra Section IV. Attorneys contacted the State Department \n9  for clarification but also received inadequate and inconsistent responses. See infra Section IV.  \n10  67.  More than fourteen months after the Proclamation went into effect and almost a year and \n11 \na half since its issuance, Defendants have yet to promulgate clear guidance, and their practices \n12 \ncontinue to sow confusion and chaos. See Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. ___, 138 S. Ct. 2392, 2431 \n13 \n(2018) (Breyer, J., dissenting) (stating that, although the Proclamation directs the Secretaries to \n14 \ndevelop guidance for consular officers, to the Court’s “knowledge, no guidance has issued”). To \n15 \nthe extent that guidance has issued, it has been confusing or contradictory, and has failed to shed \n16 \nlight on key questions about the waiver process.  \n17 \n68.  Documents released in response to Freedom of Information Act litigation demonstrate a \n18 \nwaiver process that is designed to make it especially difficult for immigrants to obtain waivers—\n19 \nin clear conflict with the examples provided in the Proclamation. See Dara Lind, Exclusive: \n20 \nInternal documents show how hard it is for some immigrants to get a travel ban waiver, Vox \n21 \n(Sept. 21, 2018), https://www.vox.com/2018/9/20/17622622/travel-ban-waiver-muslim-how. \n22 \n23  The guidance, which includes significant redactions, fails to provide for a process by which \n24  individuals may demonstrate their eligibility for a waiver, and also appears not to be followed in \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 17 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 18 of 68\n  \n1  practice. For example, it states that consular officials may grant waivers, but by all indications, \n2  that is not true in practice. See id. See also U.S. Dep’t of State, Operational Q&As on P.P. 9645 \n3 \nin light of the U.S. Supreme Court orders of December 4, 2017, lifting lower court injunctions \n4 \nand pursuant to guidance in 17 STATE 97682 (Jan. 23, 2018), https://refugeerights.org/wp-\n5 \ncontent/uploads/2018/09/FOIA-Waiver-Guidance.pdf; Ex. B, Richardson Decl.; Ex. D, Gairson \n6 \nDecl.; infra Section IV.  \n7 \n69.  The State Department initially provided the following general statement in response to a \n8 \nquery by a U.S. Senator about the waiver eligibility criteria:  \n9 \nFirst, to satisfy the undue hardship criterion, the applicant must \n10  demonstrate to the consular officer’s satisfaction that an unusual situation \nexists that compels immediate travel by the applicant and that delaying \n11 \nvisa issuance and the associated travel plans would defeat the purpose of \ntravel. Second, the applicant’s travel may be considered in the national \n12 \ninterest if the applicant demonstrates to the consular officer’s satisfaction \nthat a U.S. person or entity would suffer hardship if the applicant could \n13 \nnot travel until after visa restrictions imposed with respect to nationals of \nthat country are lifted. \n14 \n \n15  Finally, to establish that the applicant does not constitute a threat to \nnational security or public safety, the consular officer considers the \n16  information-sharing and identity-management protocols and practices of \nthe government of the applicant’s country of nationality as they relate to \n17  the applicant. If the consular officer determines, after consultation with \nthe Visa Office, that an applicant does not pose a threat to national \n18  security or public safety and the other two requirements have been met, a \nvisa may be issued with the concurrence of a consular manager. \n19 \n \nEx. E, Letter from Mary K. Waters, U.S. Dep’t of State, to Chris Van Hollen, U.S. Senator (Feb.  \n20 \n \n22, 2018) (“First Van Hollen Letter”). \n21 \n \n70.  Although  the  State  Department  asserted  in  the  same  letter  that  “[t]he  Department’s \n22 \n23  worldwide  guidance  to  consular  officers  regarding  waivers  is  drawn  directly  from  the \n24  Proclamation,” id., the above-quoted statement adds a requirement of showing “that a U.S. person \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 18 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 19 of 68\n  \n1  or entity would suffer hardship if the applicant could not travel until after visa restrictions imposed \n2  with respect to nationals of that country are lifted,” which does not appear anywhere in the \n3 \nProclamation.  \n4 \n71.  Moreover, individuals who clearly meet the criteria outlined in the Proclamation and the \n5 \nstatement provided to Senator Van Hollen are routinely being denied waivers without due \n6 \nconsideration, in some cases just days after the ban went into effect. See, e.g., Trump v. Hawaii, \n7 \n585 U.S. ___, 138 S. Ct. 2392, 2431 (2018) (Breyer, J., dissenting) (identifying “numerous \n8 \napplicants who could meet the waiver criteria,” but who have nonetheless been summarily \n9 \nrejected, including scholars, relatives of U.S. citizens, and a Yemeni child with cerebral palsy,5 \n10 \nand pointing to an amicus brief which “identified 1,000 individuals—including parents and \n11 \nchildren of U. S. citizens—who sought and were denied entry under the Proclamation, hundreds \n12 \nof whom seem to meet the waiver criteria.”) \n13 \n72.  Consular officials, in fact, have been left with the understanding that the goal is to deny \n14 \n15  waivers to the fullest extent possible, Ex. B, Richardson Decl., and applicants and their attorneys \n16  remain completely confused about applicable standards of eligibility for waivers. \n17  73.  Nor has the State Department provided an orderly process through which individuals who \n18 \nare covered by the ban may apply for a waiver or seek to “demonstrate”—as the Proclamation \n19 \nspecifically provides—their eligibility for a waiver. See infra Section IV. Instead, individuals, \n20 \nattorneys, and organizations seeking to assist impacted community members have had to resort \n21 \n22 \n23 \n                                                \n \n24 \n5 After Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg inquired about the child’s case at oral argument in Trump v. Hawaii on April \n25, 2018, a waiver was granted in her case and her visa was issued, allowing her to come to the United States with \n25 \nher U.S. citizen father.  \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 19 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 20 of 68\n  \n1  to guesswork and have had to invent a process by which to obtain consideration of materials \n2  relevant to any meaningful waiver determination. See Ex. D, Gairson Decl.    \n3 \n74.  Further, even where the State Department has provided minimal guidance, that guidance \n4 \ndoes not appear to be followed or applied with any consistency. For example, the State \n5 \nDepartment website provides a definition of “close family member,” stating that the definition \n6 \nfor purposes of the Proclamation is the same as the definition of “immediate relative” contained \n7 \nin the INA.6 Ex. F, U.S. Dep’t of State, Revisions to Presidential Proclamation 9645 (Apr. 10, \n8 \n2018) (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1151(b)(2)(A)(i)). But according to an email received by counsel from a \n9 \nU.S. Consulate in Canada, visa applicants who seek to be reunited with a parent in the United \n10 \nStates are ineligible for consideration for a waiver if they are over the age of 21, a definition that \n11 \nis found nowhere in immigration law and that is the reverse of the definition of “immediate \n12 \nrelative” in the cited provision. The email exchange reads in relevant part as follows: \n13 \nCOUNSEL: [I]t appears as though my client, [REDACTED], has been \n14 \ndenied the opportunity to request a waiver of the presidential \n15  proclamation.  \nAccording to the presidential proclamation itself and guidance on the \n16  State Department's website, foreign nationals who seek to enter the US to \nbe reunited with a close family member (e.g. spouse, child, or parent) are \n17  eligible for requesting a waiver.  \nMy client is the daughter of a United States citizen. Could you kindly \n18  explain why your office has denied my client the opportunity to request a \nwaiver of the presidential proclamation? \n19 \nCONSULATE: A consular officer may issue a visa based on a listed \nwaiver category to nationals of countries identified in the Presidential \n20 \nProclamation on a case-by-case basis. \nIt has been determined that your client, [REDACTED], does not meet the \n21 \ndefinition of close family as she is over 21 years of age. \nThis decision cannot be appealed. \n22 \n \n23 \n                                                \n24 \n \n6 8 U.S.C. § 1151(b)(2)(A)(i) defines “immediate relatives” as the children, spouses, and parents of U.S. citizens, \n25 \nand only allows children over the age of 21 to petition for immigrant visas for their parents.  \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 20 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 21 of 68\n  \n1  Ex. G, Email correspondence between U.S. Consulate General in Vancouver, Canada, and \nAttorney Shabnam Lotfi (Jan. 3-9, 2018). \n2    \n75.  Applicants in certain visa categories have been told that they are categorically not eligible \n3 \nto be considered for a waiver—an assertion that is contrary to the terms of the Proclamation, \n4 \nwhich states that every visa applicant will be considered for a waiver. See infra Section IV.C. In \n5 \nthe absence of clear standards to guide consular officers in their decision-making, different posts \n6 \nappear to have adopted different practices. Ex. D, Gairson Decl. The result has been an almost-\n7 \n8  uniform denial of case-by-case waivers, and a de facto practice that consular officials do not \n9  have the authority to grant waivers. Ex. B, Richardson Decl.  \n10  76.  Attorneys have also been told by consulates that they may not submit documents in \n11 \nsupport of waiver applications for their clients, and that “[t]here is no role or requirement for \n12 \nlegal services to facilitate the waiver process.” One such email exchange reads in relevant part as \n13 \nfollows:  \n14 \nCOUNSEL: Could you please kindly let us know whether you will allow our \n15  office to submit a waiver packet on behalf of the beneficiary to outline and \npresent evidence that he meets the grounds for approval of a waiver in \n16  consideration of the three grounds outlined by Section 3(c) of the Proclamation…  \nCONSULATE: As we said, we have all the required documents at this time. We \n17  have already submitted a waiver request on behalf of the applicant, as the \napplicant was informed during the interview. There is no role or requirement for \n18  legal services to facilitate the waiver process, which the Embassy initiated as soon \nas the applicant was interviewed. Please note – and inform your client – that only \n19 \nU.S. government officials can author waiver requests. \n \n20 \nEx. H, Email correspondence between Attorney Parastoo Zahedi and the Consular  \nSection of the U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi (July 18-19, 2018). \n21 \n \n77.  Existing guidance also does not explain how consular officers should consider the \n22 \n23  eligibility for a waiver of applicants who, like several Plaintiffs in this action, were interviewed \n24 \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 21 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 22 of 68\n  \n1  prior to implementation of the Proclamation but were in administrative processing7 at the time \n2  the ban went into effect, or for visa applicants whose applications were approved prior to \n3 \nimplementation of the ban but who had not yet gotten their visas stamped in their passports. See, \n4 \ne.g., Ex. K, Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, Alharbi v. Miller, No. 1:18-cv-02435 \n5 \n(E.D.N.Y. filed Apr. 25, 2018), ECF No. 20.  \n6 \n78.  The government has staunchly refused to provide meaningful information or to institute \n7 \nan orderly, predictable process by which individuals may apply for a case-by-case waiver.8  \n8 \nB.  Denial Letters Issued by Consular Officers Provide Further Evidence of the \n9  Dearth of Meaningful Guidance. \n \n10  79.  Defendants provided the consulates and embassies abroad with a template letter to \n11 \nprovide to applicants when they have been denied a visa pursuant to the Proclamation. The letter \n12 \nhas two options for a consular officer to select: (1) “Taking into account the provisions of the \n13 \n                                                \n14 \n \n7 Administrative processing is a period after a visa interview during which applicants undergo additional screening \n15 \noutside of “normal” visa processing. Maggio & Kattar & The Pennsylvania State University Law School’s Center \nfor Immigrants’ Rights, Administrative Processing FAQ, 1, Penn. State L. Sch., https://pennstatelaw.psu.edu/sites/ \n16 \ndefault/files/documents/pdfs/Immigrants/Administrative-Processing-FAQ.pdf (last visited Feb. 22, 2019). “Before \nissuing a visa, consular officers review different databases to determine if information exists that may impact \n17  individual eligibility for a visa. A ‘hit’ on a particular database occurs when there is a match between the visa \napplicant and a database. These hits may be based on criminal convictions, security risks, and prior visa overstays or \n18  denials (this list is non-exhaustive).” Id. A hit may also occur when an applicant’s name is similar to the name of \nsomeone suspected of criminal activity. Id. at 4. “When an individual case has been tagged in a database, the \nDepartment of State, at the request of the consular post, may initiate administrative processing.” Id. at 1. Cases filed \n19 \nby nationals of several countries are routinely placed in administrative processing. Id. at 3. \n \n20 \n8 In fact, the waiver process has been so opaque that, in addition to formal requests for information from U.S. senators, \ntwo civil rights organizations, including undersigned counsel, have filed a FOIA request seeking documents from the \n21  State Department that could provide some clarity and transparency about the travel ban waiver process. Muslim \nAdvocates and Center for Constitutional Rights, Freedom of Information Act Request Regarding the Waiver Process \n22  Provided  for  in  Presidential  Proclamation  9645  (January  23,  2018),  https://www.muslimad \nvocates.org/files/2018.01.23_FOIA_Proclamation-Waivers-Signed.pdf. The case is currently being litigated in the \n23  U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Muslim Advocates v. U.S. Dep’t of State, No. 1:18-cv-01546 (D.D.C. \nfiled June 28, 2018). In response to the litigation, the State Department has begun to produce documents, which have \nincluded some guidance issued to consular officials. But the guidance has not shed further light on the process, and \n24 \nhas raised more questions than it has answered. It also appears to conflict with statements by former consular officials \nabout the instructions they received. \n25 \n \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 22 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 23 of 68\n  \n1  Proclamation, a waiver will not be granted in your case”; or (2) “The consular officer is \n2  reviewing your eligibility for a waiver under the Proclamation.” Ex. I, Embassy letter regarding \n3 \neligibility for waiver under the Proclamation. There is no option indicating that a waiver has \n4 \nbeen granted. \n5 \n80.   These form letters further confirm that not all individuals are being considered for case-\n6 \nby-case waivers, in direct conflict with agency statements that “[a] consular officer will carefully \n7 \nreview each case to determine whether the applicant is affected by the Proclamation . . . and, if \n8 \nso, whether the applicant qualifies for an exception or a waiver.” Ex. F, U.S. Dep’t of State, \n9 \nRevisions to Presidential Proclamation 9645 (Apr. 10, 2018). As set forth previously, scores of \n10 \ndenials were issued just days after the Proclamation went into effect, and numerous individuals \n11 \nwho have received these form denials at the interview were told that their eligibility would not be \n12 \nconsidered and that they may not submit additional documents in support of such consideration. \n13 \nSee infra Section IV.   \n14 \n15  C.  Defendants Have Granted a “Minuscule Percentage” of Waiver Applications. \n16  81.  To date, the overwhelming majority of waiver applicants have been denied or stalled by \n17  Defendants. \n18 \n82.  In a letter dated February 22, 2018, the State Department disclosed that, as of January 8, \n19 \n2018, only two waivers were granted to applicants of the banned countries out of at least 6,555 \n20 \napplicants who were eligible to be considered for waivers—a rejection rate of more than 99%. \n21 \nEx. E, First Van Hollen Letter.  \n22 \n83.  After the letter was made public, the State Department switched from disclosing the \n23 \nnumber of waivers granted to disclosing only the number of waivers cleared—a figure that does \n24 \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 23 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 24 of 68\n  \n1  not appear to bear any substantial relation to the number of waivers actually granted. The State \n2  Department has also refused to provide a clear explanation of the term “cleared”.  \n3 \n84.  As of March 6, 2018, 102 applicants had been cleared for waivers, likely out of an \n4 \nexpanded pool of applicants—moving the rejection rate to at least 98% of visa applicants. Torbati \n5 \n& Rosenberg, Exclusive: Visa Waivers Rarely Granted, supra Section III.  \n6 \n85.  As of April 30, out of 27,129 applicants from banned countries who were ostensibly \n7 \nconsidered for waivers, only 579 had been cleared for waivers. Ex. J, Letter from Mary K. \n8 \nWaters, U.S. Dep’t of State, to Chris Van Hollen, U.S. Senator (June 22, 2018) (“Second Van \n9 \nHollen Letter”).  \n10 \n86.  According to the latest numbers from the State Department website, that figure is now at \n11 \n2,673. U.S. Dep’t of State, June 26 Supreme Court Decision on Presidential Proclamation 9645 \n12 \nhttps://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/presidential-\n13 \nproclamation-archive/june_26_supreme_court_decision_on_presidential_proclamation9645.html \n14 \n15  (last visited February 23, 2019). Assuming a stable number of applications per month, the \n16  rejection rate thus remains greater than 96%. See Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. ___, 138 S. Ct. \n17  2392, 2431 (2018) (Breyer, J., dissenting) (“That number, … however, when compared with the \n18 \nnumber of pre-Proclamation visitors, accounts for a miniscule percentage of those likely eligible \n19 \nfor visas, in such categories as persons requiring medical treatment, academic visitors, students, \n20 \nfamily members, and others belonging to groups that, when considered as a group (rather than \n21 \ncase by case), would not seem to pose security threats.”).  \n22 \n87.  Ultimately, however, the numbers provided by the State Department are misleading, \n23 \nsince not all individuals “cleared” for waivers have been granted a waiver or issued a visa. Based \n24 \non all available evidence, being “cleared” for a waiver simply means that a consular official has \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 24 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 25 of 68\n  \n1  forwarded the case for consideration for a waiver grant by the State Department in Washington, \n2  DC. Ex. D, Gairson Decl. Individuals “cleared” for waivers may continue to be stalled and may \n3 \nnot ultimately be granted a visa, rendering the government’s 2,673 figure essentially \n4 \nmeaningless.  \n5 \n88.  Thus, based upon all available evidence, the percentage of persons who have actually \n6 \nbeen granted a waiver and issued a visa remains considerably smaller than the bare 4% of \n7 \nindividuals who have been “cleared” for consideration for a waiver grant.  \n8 \nD. Former Consular Officials Have Confirmed the Absence of a Meaningful Waiver \n9  Process. \n \n10  89.  Former consular officers have confirmed the absence of a meaningful waiver \n11 \nconsideration process.  \n12 \n90.  In a sworn affidavit submitted in related litigation in the Eastern District of New York, \n13 \nformer consular official Mr. Christopher Richardson wrote: \n14 \nAs a Consular officer previously employed by the State Department my \n15  impression and interpretation of how we as officers were to apply the \nwaiver process was as follows: \n16   \n(a) They gave us a list of things and we would go down the list one by \n17  one until we were able to determine at all possible cost that the person \nwas not eligible to even apply for the waiver. My understanding was no \n18  one is to be eligible to apply.  \n \n19 \n(b) If for some reason an applicant made it through the list and we had no \nchoice but to determine we could find an applicant eligible to apply, \n20 \nregardless of the [Presidential Proclamation] instructions that we had \n“discretion to grant the waiver,” we were not allowed to exercise that \n21 \ndiscretion. We were mandated to send to Washington that we found this \napplicant eligible to apply and Washington would then make the decision \n22 \nto grant or deny the waiver.   \n23   \n24 \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 26 of 68\n  \n1  Ex. B, Richardson Decl. at 4. See also Jeremy Stahl, “The Waiver Process Is Fraud,” Slate (June \n2  15, 2018), https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/06/trump-travel-ban-waiver-process-is-a-\n3 \nsham-two-consular-officers-say.html.  \n4 \n91.  Mr. Richardson further stated: “[T]here really is no waiver [process] and the Supreme \n5 \nCourt was correct to point out that the waiver [process] is merely ‘window dressing.’” Ex. B, \n6 \nRichardson Decl. at 3. Mr. Richardson’s description of the waiver process has been corroborated \n7 \nby another consular officer. Stahl, supra. \n8 \n92.  These statements reveal a process that conflicts with the plain text of the Proclamation, \n9 \nthe information provided by the State Department on its website and in letters to U.S. senators, \n10 \nthe recently-released “guidance”, and arguments made by the government while defending \n11 \nagainst litigation challenging the ban. As described by Mr. Richardson, officers were instructed \n12 \nnot to consider applicants for waivers in good faith and to make every effort to deny eligibility \n13 \neven to apply for a waiver. They also were not allowed to exercise their discretion to grant a \n14 \n15  waiver even where they did consider an applicant to be eligible. \n16  93.  Consistent with Mr. Richardson’s representations, numerous visa applicants have stated \n17  that when they attended their visa interviews, officers informed them that waivers are processed \n18 \nin Washington, DC. See Ex. D, Gairson Decl.; infra Section IV. This is in conflict with the State \n19 \nDepartment’s claims that a visa applicant’s eligibility for a waiver is determined by the consular \n20 \nofficer at the time of the interview.  \n21 \n94.  As a result of the inconsistent statements, the absence of meaningful guidance, and the \n22 \nabsence of an orderly process by which applicants may “demonstrate” their eligibility for a \n23 \nwaiver, applicants do not know who is adjudicating their requests for waivers, what information \n24 \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 26 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 27 of 68\n  \n1  they are considering, and what the standards really are to qualify for a waiver grant. The process \n2  continues to be “a sham”.  \n3 \nIV.  The Plaintiffs \n \n4 \n95.  Plaintiffs include:  \n5 \na.  U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents who are of Iranian, Libyan, Somali, Syrian, \n6 \nand Yemeni national origin and/or who have Iranian, Libyan, Somali, Syrian, and Yemeni \n7 \nfamily members who seek to enter the United States to permanently reside with their family \n8 \nmembers; \n9 \nb.  Iranian family members of U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents who seek to enter \n10 \nthe United States on family-based immigrant visas; \n11 \nc.  U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents who are of Iranian, Libyan, Somali, Syrian, \n12 \nand Yemeni national origin and/or who have Iranian, Libyan, Somali, Syrian, and Yemeni \n13 \nfamily members who seek to enter the United States on non-immigrant visas; \n14 \n15  d.  Iranian family members of U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents who seek to enter \n16  the United States on fiancé or visitor visas;  \n17  e.  Iranian  nationals  who  have  approved  immigrant  visas  because  of  their  substantial \n18 \ninvestment in the United States; and  \n19 \nf.  Iranian  and  Syrian  nationals  who  have  approved  immigrant  visas  because  of  their \n20 \nextraordinary abilities.    \n21 \n96.  Several Plaintiffs have approved visa petitions for their family members. Others have \n22 \napproved investment or extraordinary ability immigrant visas that have since been denied or stalled \n23 \nunder the Proclamation. All are suffering a range of ongoing harms including separation from their \n24 \nfamily and loved ones; loss of jobs, research opportunities, and investments; emotional distress \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 27 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 28 of 68\n  \n1  caused by extended separation from loved ones at critical times in their lives including pregnancy \n2  and  childbirth;  and  a  range  of  financial  losses  for  visa  application  fees,  travel  costs, \n3 \naccommodation costs, medical fees, and other costs directly or indirectly associated with the visa \n4 \napplication process.   \n5 \n97.  Each of the Plaintiffs’ circumstances fit directly under one or more of the examples offered \n6 \nin the Proclamation of circumstances under which a waiver grant may be appropriate. Many have \n7 \nreceived boilerplate letters denying them visas and waivers. Others have been informed that their \n8 \neligibility for a waiver is being considered, but have had their applications stalled and have been \n9 \nawaiting a decision on their visa applications for months. Most have had no opportunity to submit \n10 \ndocuments or materials demonstrating their eligibility for a waiver. \n11 \n98.  Plaintiffs all seek clear guidance about the waiver process, an opportunity to apply in an \n12 \norderly manner with full understanding of the criteria and methods by which waiver determinations \n13 \nare made, and full and timely adjudication of their waiver requests.    \n14 \n15  A. Family members seeking reunification in the United States  \n16  i.  Tannaz Toloubeydokhti, Fathollah Tolou Beydokhti, and Behnaz Malekghaeini \n17  99.  Plaintiff Tannaz Toloubeydokhti is a U.S. citizen of Iranian origin who resides in San \n18 \nDiego, California.  \n19 \n100.  Ms. Toloubeydokhti is employed as an obstetric-gynecologist and has dedicated her career \n20 \nto improving the lives of American mothers and their babies.  \n21 \n101.  Ms. Toloubeydokhti petitioned for immigrant visas for her parents, Plaintiffs Fathollah \n22 \nTolou Beydokhti and Behnaz Malekghaeini, both Iranian nationals, on September 1, 2016. Her \n23 \npetitions were approved, and their visa interviews were scheduled for December 21, 2017, at the \n24 \nU.S. Embassy in Yerevan, Armenia.  \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 28 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 29 of 68\n  \n1  102.  Despite the lack of guidance or information about waiver applications and criteria for \n2  consideration, Mr. Tolou Beydokhti and Ms. Malekghaeini put together documents they believed \n3 \nwould demonstrate that they meet the criteria for a waiver under the terms of the Proclamation. \n4 \nBut when they attempted to present those documents to the consular official, the official refused \n5 \nto review them, stated that they did not qualify for a waiver, and stated that their visas were denied. \n6 \n103.  Mr. Tolou Beydokhti and Ms. Malekghaeini’s cases fit within one of the examples \n7 \nprovided in the Proclamation as a situation in which a grant of a waiver may be appropriate.  \n8 \n104.  Ms. Toloubeydokhti has suffered significant emotional distress because she has been \n9 \ndeprived of the opportunity to have her parents present during her pregnancy and at the birth of \n10 \nher child. Her parents have similarly suffered emotional distress at their separation from their \n11 \ndaughter during her time of need. \n12 \n105.  The family has also suffered and is continuing to suffer significant financial losses. They \n13 \nhave paid filing fees and travel costs which they will be unable to recover. Ms. Toloubeydokhti \n14 \n15  now also has to incur significant childcare expenses in the absence of her parents, who would have \n16  helped take care of her child while she is at work. \n17  ii.  Afrooz Kharazmi and Afshan Alamshah Zadeh \n18 \n106.  Plaintiff Afrooz Kharazmi, a U.S. citizen of Iranian origin residing in Loveland, Ohio, filed \n19 \nan immigrant visa petition with USCIS on June 1, 2004 for her sister, Plaintiff Afshan Alamshah \n20 \nZadeh, an Iranian national currently residing in Iran.  \n21 \n107.  Ms. Alamshah Zadeh waited patiently for 12 years for her priority date9 to become current.  \n22 \n                                                \n23 \n \n9 An applicant’s priority date is the date upon which her application was filed. Unless the applicant is a spouse, \n24 \nparent, or minor child of a U.S. citizen, the applicant must wait until his or her priority date becomes “current” \nbefore she can apply for adjustment of her status to that of a lawful permanent resident. For siblings, priority dates \n25 \ncan take more than a decade to become current.  \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 29 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 30 of 68\n  \n1  108.  USCIS approved her petition in October 2016. The U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi, UAE, \n2  scheduled Ms. Alamshah Zadeh’s immigrant visa interview for January 7, 2018.  \n3 \n109.  Ms. Alamshah Zadeh attended the interview and was informed during the interview that \n4 \nher immigrant visa was denied pursuant to the Proclamation.  \n5 \n110.  At no point was Ms. Alamshah Zadeh informed that she could seek to “demonstrate” her \n6 \neligibility for a waiver under the terms of the Proclamation.  \n7 \n111.  At no point was Ms. Alamshah Zadeh provided an opportunity to apply for a waiver or to \n8 \nsubmit documents in support of such application. \n9 \n112.  Accordingly, the consular officer was not made aware of and likely did not consider any \n10 \nfactors that would have been relevant to determining whether continuing separation would cause \n11 \nher and her family members “undue hardship.” Ms. Alamshah Zadeh has been living in limbo for \n12 \nyears while waiting to rejoin her family in the United States, and has not settled down or planned \n13 \nfor her future in Iran because she reasonably believed that she would soon be reunited with her \n14 \n15  two U.S. citizen parents and her U.S. citizen sister.  \n16  113.  Ms. Alamshah Zadeh’s case fits within one of the examples provided in the Proclamation \n17  as a situation in which a grant of a waiver may be appropriate.  \n18 \n114.  Ms. Kharazmi and Ms. Alamshah Zadeh have endured years of separation from each other. \n19 \nMs. Alamshah Zadeh’s entire family are U.S. citizens residing in the United States; she is the only \n20 \nfamily member left in Iran and now risks being permanently separated from them.  \n21 \n115.  Ms. Kharazmi and Ms. Alamshah Zadeh have also paid thousands of dollars in attorneys’ \n22 \nfees, filing fees, travel costs, and medical fees, which they will be unable to recover.  \n23 \niii.  Dr. Najib Adi \n24 \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 30 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 31 of 68\n  \n1  116.  Plaintiff Dr. Najib Adi is a U.S. citizen of Syrian origin who owns a highly successful \n2  dental practice in Gainesville, Virginia. He employs close to 20 people and provides dental \n3 \nservices to well over 4,000 patients.  \n4 \n117.  Since war broke out in Syria in 2011, Dr. Adi has been unable to visit his family back \n5 \nhome. His father was deceased in 2014 and he was not able to say goodbye or to attend his \n6 \nfuneral. His mother is a 70-year-old widow living in war-torn Damascus. He wishes to bring her \n7 \nhome so that she can spend her golden years with him, his wife, and his two children and so they \n8 \ncan take care of her as she grows older. \n9 \n118.  In February 2017, he petitioned for a family-based immigrant visa for his mother. The \n10 \npetition was approved in August 2017, and her interview was scheduled at the U.S. Embassy in \n11 \nAmman, Jordan for December 26, 2017.  \n12 \n119.  Hoping to bring his mother home with him after the interview, Dr. Adi traveled to Jordan \n13 \nand went with his mother to the interview.    \n14 \n15  120.  At no point during this process was Dr. Adi or his mother informed that she could seek to \n16  “demonstrate” her eligibility for a waiver under the terms of the Proclamation. However, on his \n17  own initiative and with the assistance of an immigration attorney, he prepared a letter and \n18 \ndocumentary evidence outlining the reasons his mother should be granted a waiver under the \n19 \nProclamation, and presented this evidence to the consular official at the interview. The consular \n20 \nofficial told Dr. Adi and his mother that because of the Proclamation, he is unable to grant her a \n21 \nvisa even though everything looked to be in order, but that she would be considered for a waiver \n22 \ngrant. \n23 \n24 \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 31 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 32 of 68\n  \n1  121.  For more than a year, Dr. Adi and his mother have been waiting for word on whether she \n2  has been granted a waiver. They have received no further information despite multiple queries, \n3 \nincluding a congressional inquiry, about the status of her case.  \n4 \n122.  Dr. Adi is suffering severe emotional distress at his separation from his mother, and his \n5 \nfeeling of helplessness at not being able to take care of her when she needs him. He is worried \n6 \nabout her safety in Syria and only wishes to bring her home so they can make up for lost time \n7 \nbeing apart from each other. Dr. Adi is additionally suffering emotional distress because he feels \n8 \nhe is being treated like a second-class citizen and not being allowed to access the full privileges of \n9 \ncitizenship due to his religion and national origin.  \n10 \n123.  Dr. Adi has paid thousands of dollars in attorneys’ fees, filing fees, travel costs, and \n11 \nmedical fees, which he will be unable to recover. \n12 \niv.  Ismail Alghazali \n13 \n124.  Plaintiff Mr. Ismail Alghazali is a U.S. citizen of Yemeni origin currently residing in \n14 \n15  Djibouti. He was compelled to leave his home in the United States in order to be with his \n16  Yemeni wife, who has been unable to come to the United States because of the Proclamation. \n17  125.  He petitioned for a family-based immigrant visa for his wife in or around June 2016, and \n18 \nthe petition was approved on November 23, 2016. Her interview was scheduled for January 3, \n19 \n2018 at the U.S. Embassy in Djibouti.  \n20 \n126.  She attended her interview and was informed immediately that her visa was denied and \n21 \nthat she would not be considered for a waiver.  \n22 \n127.  At no point was Mr. Alghazali or his wife informed that she could seek to “demonstrate” \n23 \nher eligibility for a waiver under the terms of the Proclamation.  \n24 \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 32 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 33 of 68\n  \n1  128.  At no point was Mr. Alghazali or his wife provided an opportunity to apply for a waiver or \n2  to submit documents in support of such application. \n3 \n129.  Mr. Alghazali’s wife’s case fits within one of the examples provided in the Proclamation \n4 \nas a situation in which a grant of a waiver may be appropriate. \n5 \n130.  Mr. Alghazali and his wife are currently stuck in Djibouti, where life is difficult and \n6 \nextremely expensive. Mr. Alghazali was forced to leave his job in the United States because his \n7 \nwife, who was pregnant at the time, could not be on her own in Djibouti. They are unable to go \n8 \nto Yemen, which is currently in the throes of a violent civil war the United Nations has described \n9 \nas the worst humanitarian crisis in the world.10 There is no security or stability; schools and \n10 \nhealth centers are closed; and there is no safe drinking water, access to food, or electricity in \n11 \nlarge portions of the country.  \n12 \n131.  Mr. Alghazali and his wife experienced intense difficulty in Djibouti on a number of \n13 \nlevels. About a month after her interview, Mr. Alghazali’s wife went into labor in the middle of \n14 \n15  the night. It took Mr. Alghazali a long time to find a taxi or an ambulance to take her to the \n16  hospital. When he finally found a taxi that would take them to the hospital, his wife was already \n17  in the process of delivering their baby, who was born in the taxi cab with no medical assistance. \n18 \nSince that time, his wife has suffered physical and emotional distress because of this experience. \n19 \nThey continued to live in extremely difficult circumstances in Djibouti for months, with no \n20 \nability to work or to study.  \n21 \n22 \n                                                \n \n23 \n10 See Daniel Nikbakht & Sheena McKenzie, The Yemen war is the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, UN says, \nCNN (Apr. 3, 2018), https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/03/middleeast/yemen-worlds-worst-humanitarian-crisis-un-\n24 \nintl/index.html; U.S. Dep’t of State, Yemen Travel Advisory (Feb. 14, 2019), https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/ \nen/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/yemen-travel-advisory.html.  \n25 \n \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 33 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 34 of 68\n  \n1  132.  Mr. Alghazali’s entire family are U.S. citizens. All reside in the United States, except for \n2  his younger sister who accompanied him to Djibouti because he is her legal guardian. She suffers \n3 \nfrom a speech disability, insomnia, depression, and loss of concentration. He was unable to \n4 \nproperly provide for her in Djibouti, and she was unable to access the services she needs.  \n5 \n133.  Eventually, Mr. Alghazali had to return to his job in the United States, and his wife and \n6 \ninfant son are now in Yemen, where the situation is extremely dangerous.    \n7 \nv.  Malik Almathil \n8 \n134.  Plaintiff Malik Almathil is a U.S. citizen residing in New York City.  \n9 \n135.  In March 2015, he petitioned for a family-based immigrant visa for his wife, a Yemeni \n10 \nnational currently residing in Jordan. The petition was approved shortly thereafter, and his wife \n11 \nattended her visa interview in Djibouti on July 31, 2017. At the interview, she was informed that \n12 \nher visa was approved. \n13 \n136.  On December 17, 2017, shortly after the Proclamation went into full effect, she received a \n14 \n15  boilerplate denial of a visa and waiver.   \n16  137.  At  no  point  was  Mr.  Almathil  or  his  wife  informed  that  his  family  could  seek  to \n17  “demonstrate” their eligibility for a waiver under the terms of the Proclamation.  \n18 \n138.  At no point was Mr. Almathil or his wife provided an opportunity to apply for a waiver or \n19 \nto submit documents in support of such application. \n20 \n139.  Mr. Almathil’s wife’s case fits within one of the examples provided in the Proclamation as \n21 \na situation in which a grant of a waiver may be appropriate. \n22 \n140.  Mr. Almathil is suffering severe emotional distress at his inability to be with his wife and \n23 \nto bring her home with him to the United States. Because of the situation in Yemen, his wife had \n24 \nto leave the country in 2015 and is unable to return. Mr. Almathil had to give up continuing his \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 34 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 35 of 68\n  \n1  college education in order to go be with his wife while they awaited processing of her visa \n2  application, and he spent two years with her in Djibouti trying to bring her home. Because of the \n3 \nsignificant expenses associated with living in Djibouti, he ultimately had to return to the United \n4 \nStates to resume earning a living so that he can provide for himself and his wife. His ongoing \n5 \nseparation from his wife is the most difficult thing he has ever had to endure.     \n6 \n141.  In addition to the significant costs of living in Djibouti, Mr. Almathil has spent thousands \n7 \nof dollars in filing fees, travel costs, and other expenses related to his wife’s visa application, \n8 \nwhich he will be unable to recover.  \n9 \nvi.  Khalil Ali Nagi \n10 \n142.  Plaintiff Khalil Ali Nagi is a U.S. citizen residing in Schenectady, New York with his four-\n11 \nyear-old U.S. citizen daughter.  \n12 \n143.  In December 2015, he petitioned for a family-based immigrant visa for his Yemeni wife. \n13 \nThe petition was approved in 2016, and her interview was scheduled in Djibouti for July 2017. \n14 \n15  The airport in Yemen was closed at that time, however, and she was unable to leave the country \n16  to attend her interview, which was rescheduled for October 31, 2017. Mr. Nagi traveled with her \n17  to Djibouti, where she attended the interview and was told that her application looked good and \n18 \nthat her visa would be approved.  \n19 \n144.  Unable to return to Yemen and without an issued visa to the United States, Mr. Nagi, his \n20 \nwife, and their four-year-old child remained in Djibouti to wait for her visa to be issued. But in \n21 \nMarch 2018, she was informed that she would not be approved for a visa or a waiver.  \n22 \n145.  Mr. Nagi had to return to the United States along with his four-year-old daughter, forced \n23 \nto leave his wife behind. He is experiencing severe emotional distress because of their separation, \n24 \nand his four-year-old daughter constantly cries for her mother.

He is desperate to be reunited with his wife so that their family can live \n3 \ntogether in their home in the United States. \n4 \n146.  Mr. Nagi has paid thousands of dollars in living expenses, travel costs, filing fees, and other \n5 \ncosts related to his wife’s visa application, which he will be unable to recover.      \n6 \nvii.  Hezam Alarqaban \n7 \n147.  Plaintiff Hezam Alarqaban is a lawful permanent resident of Yemeni origin residing in \n8 \nOakland, California.  \n9 \n148.  In March 2012, he petitioned for a family-based immigrant visa for his wife and his \n10 \neleven children, all of whom are Yemeni nationals. The petition was approved in 2016, and the \n11 \nfamily had their interview at the U.S. Embassy in Malaysia in March 2016. \n12 \n149.   As the situation in Yemen deteriorated, the family moved to Djibouti in December 2016. \n13 \nThey continued to wait for issuance of their visas, which were finally stamped in their passports \n14 \n15  in February 2017.  \n16  150.   In June 2017, however, their visas were canceled and stamped “revoked without \n17  prejudice.” They submitted additional documents and in October 2017, their application was \n18 \nonce again sent to the U.S. Embassy in Djibouti. \n19 \n151.  They attended another interview at the Embassy in Djibouti in February 2018 and did not \n20 \nreceive any further communication until June 2018, when they were told that their eligibility for \n21 \na waiver was being reconsidered. \n22 \n152.  At no point was Mr. Alarqaban or his family informed that his family could seek to \n23 \n“demonstrate” their eligibility for a waiver under the terms of the Proclamation.  \n24 \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 36 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 37 of 68\n  \n1  153.  At no point was Mr. Alarqaban or his family provided an opportunity to apply for a waiver \n2  or to submit documents in support of such application. \n3 \n154.  Mr. Alarqaban’s family’s case fits within one of the examples provided in the Proclamation \n4 \nas a situation in which a grant of a waiver may be appropriate. \n5 \n155.  Mr. Alarqaban has suffered and is continuing to suffer severe emotional distress at his \n6 \nseparation from his family. He is not able to afford travel to visit his family. During the entire six \n7 \nyears that they have been separated from each other, he has only been able to spend a total of two \n8 \nmonths with his wife and children.  \n9 \n156.  Mr. Alarqaban has incurred enormous expense supporting his family in Djibouti, where \n10 \ncost of living is extremely high. He has also paid thousands of dollars in filing fees, travel costs, \n11 \nmedical fees, and other costs associated with the visa application process, which he will be \n12 \nunable to recover. \n13 \nviii.  Abdurraouf Gseaa  \n14 \n15  157.  Plaintiff Abdurraouf Gseaa is a U.S. citizen of Libyan origin who resides in Houston, \n16  Texas. He petitioned for a family-based immigrant visa petition for his wife, who is a Libyan \n17  national, in October 2016. \n18 \n158.  USCIS approved the petition and scheduled her for an interview in April 2018 at the U.S. \n19 \nConsulate General in Casablanca, Morocco. She was unable to obtain a visa to travel to \n20 \nMorocco, however, and the interview had to be rescheduled. \n21 \n159.  His wife’s interview was then moved to the U.S. Embassy in Tunisia, and rescheduled for \n22 \nJuly 12, 2018. She attended her interview and was told that her eligibility for a waiver would be \n23 \nconsidered but that it would take several months to obtain a response.  \n24 \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 37 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 38 of 68\n  \n1  160.  At no point was Mr. Gseaa or his wife informed that she could seek to “demonstrate” her \n2  eligibility for a waiver under the terms of the Proclamation.  \n3 \n161.  At no point was Mr. Gseaa or his wife provided an opportunity to apply for a waiver or to \n4 \nsubmit documents in support of such application. \n5 \n162.  Mr. Gseaa’s wife’s case fits within one of the examples provided in the Proclamation as a \n6 \nsituation in which a grant of a waiver may be appropriate. \n7 \n163.  Mr. Gseaa’s wife was alone in Libya for an extended period of time while she was \n8 \npregnant, and she recently gave birth to their first child. The situation in Libya is precarious and \n9 \nthe country has been ravaged by violence and war. Because of their separation and in order to \n10 \ngive himself more flexibility to spend time with her, Mr. Gseaa had to quit a stable and well-\n11 \npaying job and has now become an Uber driver. He travels back and forth to Libya because he \n12 \ncannot bear to leave his wife and newborn child alone. He cannot wait for the time when he can \n13 \nbring them home and they can live together and raise their child in the United States.  \n14 \n15  164.  Mr. Gseaa has spent thousands of dollars in attorneys’ fees, filing fees, travel costs, and \n16  medical fees, which he will be unable to recover.   \n17  ix.  Sudi Wardere \n18 \n165.  Plaintiff Sudi Wardere is a U.S. citizen of Somali origin who resides in Kirkland, \n19 \nWashington. She petitioned for a family-based immigrant visa for her husband in October 2016. \n20 \nHer husband is a Somali national who has resided in South Africa since 2005.  \n21 \n166.  USCIS approved the visa petition on March 31, 2017, and Ms. Wardere’s husband \n22 \nattended his interview at a U.S. Consulate General in South Africa on February 5, 2018. The \n23 \nConsulate then interviewed him again on March 22, 2018. Since that time, they have been \n24 \nawaiting a decision on his visa application.  \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 38 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 39 of 68\n  \n1  167.  At no point was Ms. Wardere or her husband informed that he could seek to “demonstrate” \n2  his eligibility for a waiver under the terms of the Proclamation.  \n3 \n168.  At no point was Ms. Wardere or her husband provided an opportunity to apply for a waiver \n4 \nor to submit documents in support of such application. \n5 \n169.  Ms. Wardere’s husband’s case fits within one of the examples provided in the Proclamation \n6 \nas a situation in which a grant of a waiver may be appropriate. \n7 \n170.  Ms. Wardere has suffered great hardship because of their separation from each other. On \n8 \nMay 26, 2018, she gave birth to their son, alone and without her husband’s support. Her husband \n9 \ndid not meet his child for over a year because they were unable to afford travel to South Africa \n10 \nwhile they are maintaining two separate households, and Ms. Wardere cannot leave her job for \n11 \nlong periods of time.  \n12 \n171.  Ms. Wardere was compelled to go back to work immediately after having her baby, who \n13 \nis now in daycare. He is frequently sick and she has had to take him to the emergency room on \n14 \n15  four separate occasions. She had to spend Eid-al-Fitr, one of the most important Muslim holidays, \n16  without her husband, and has had enormous difficulty juggling work and being a single parent to \n17  their child.  \n18 \n172.  Ms. Wardere’s husband is also in a precarious situation. He owns a store in South Africa, \n19 \nwhich has been closed several times because of riots. Members of the Somali community in South \n20 \nAfrica are frequently subjected to xenophobic attacks, and his store was robbed several times.  \n21 \n173.  Ms. Wardere has additionally suffered emotional distress because she believes she is being \n22 \ntreated differently on account of her religion and nationality, and is not being allowed to access all \n23 \nthe privileges of being a U.S. citizen simply because of her religion and national origin.   \n24 \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 39 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 40 of 68\n  \n1  174.  In addition to the costs of maintaining two households, Ms. Wardere and her husband have \n2  also spent thousands of dollars in filing fees and medical fees, which they will be unable to recover.  \n3 \nx.  Khadija Aden \n4 \n175.  Plaintiff Khadija Aden is a lawful permanent resident of Somali origin who resides in \n5 \nSeattle, Washington. In October 2015, she petitioned for a family-based immigrant visa for her \n6 \nson, who is Somali but has never been to Somalia.  \n7 \n176.  Her petition was approved and her son attended his interview at the U.S. Embassy in \n8 \nAddis Ababa, Ethiopia on June 11, 2018. His visa was denied and he received a boilerplate letter \n9 \nstating that he is ineligible for a waiver.  \n10 \n177.  At no point was Ms. Aden or her son informed that he could seek to “demonstrate” his \n11 \neligibility for a waiver under the terms of the Proclamation.  \n12 \n178.  At no point was Ms. Aden or her son provided an opportunity to apply for a waiver or to \n13 \nsubmit documents in support of such application. \n14 \n15  179.  Ms. Aden’s son’s case fits within one of the examples provided in the Proclamation as a \n16  situation in which a grant of a waiver may be appropriate. \n17  180.  In fact, Ms. Aden’s son arguably should not even be subject to the ban, as he has never \n18 \nbeen to Somalia and therefore should not be considered a Somali national. He was born in a \n19 \nrefugee camp in Ethiopia after his parents left Somalia as refugees. He has lived his entire life in \n20 \nEthiopia, where he resided with his father until his father died in 2015.  \n21 \n181.  Ms. Aden has suffered severe emotional distress because of her separation from her son. \n22 \nShe is constantly worried about his safety and well-being, and is terrified at the prospect that he \n23 \nwould have to go back to Somalia. \n24 \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 40 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 41 of 68\n  \n1  182.  Ms. Aden has also spent thousands of dollars in attorneys’ fees, filing fees, medical costs, \n2  and other expenses related to their visa application, which she will be unable to recover.   \n3 \nB.  Fiancés seeking reunification in the United States  \n4 \ni.  Soheil Vazehrad and Atefehossadat Motavaliabyazani \n5 \n183.  Plaintiff Soheil Vazehrad is a U.S. citizen of Iranian origin who is employed as a registered \n6 \ndental hygienist and resides in Napa, California.  \n7 \n184.  Mr. Vazehrad filed an application with USCIS for a fiancé visa for Plaintiff Atefehossadat \n8 \nMotavaliabyazani, an Iranian national currently in Iran, in April 2016.  \n9 \n185.  USCIS approved Mr. Vazehrad's petition on May 11, 2016.  \n10 \n186.  Ms. Motavaliabyazani attended her interview at the U.S. Embassy in Yerevan, Armenia, \n11 \non  October  20,  2016,  and  was  told  that  her  case  would  go  through  routine  administrative \n12 \nprocessing.  \n13 \n187.  On January 4, 2018, she received a boilerplate email stating: \n14 \n15  Dear Applicant: \n \n16  This is to inform you that a consular officer found you ineligible for \na visa under Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, \n17  pursuant  to  Presidential  Proclamation  9645.

At no point was Ms. Motavaliabyazani provided an opportunity to apply for a waiver or to \n2  submit documents in support of such application. \n3 \n190.  Ms. Motavaliabyazani’s case fits within one of the examples provided in the Proclamation \n4 \nas a situation in which a grant of a waiver may be appropriate. \n5 \n191.  Mr. Vazehrad and Ms. Motavaliabyazani are suffering ongoing severe emotional and \n6 \nmental distress because of their indefinite separation from each other.  \n7 \n192.  Mr. Vazehrad is suffering from loss of consortium  since he has been deprived and \n8 \ncontinues to be deprived of the opportunity to be with his fiancée. He is also forced to take \n9 \nsignificant breaks from work and to incur significant expenses to travel to meet his fiancée outside \n10 \nof the United States.    \n11 \n193.  Mr. Vazehrad and Ms. Motavaliabyazani have also paid filing fees, travel costs, and other \n12 \ncosts associated with the visa application process, which they are unable to recover.  \n13 \nC.  Family members applying for visitor visas  \n14 \n15  i.  Bamshad Azizi, Roghayeh Azizikoutenaei, and Hojjatollah Azizikoutenaei \n16  194.  Plaintiff Bamshad Azizi is a lawful permanent resident of Iranian origin residing in San \n17  Jose, California. He is the co-founder of a cybersecurity startup in the United States.  \n18 \n195.  Mr. Azizi’s parents Plaintiffs Roghayeh Azizikoutenaei and Hojjatollah Azizikoutenaei \n19 \napplied for B1/B211 tourist visas to come visit him and his sister in the United States.

Mr. Azizikoutenaei had also had surgery recently. \n3 \nThey both were considerably weakened by their illnesses and wanted nothing more than to spend \n4 \ntime with their family members as they continue to recover.  \n5 \n196.  Mr. and Mrs. Azizikoutenaei attended their interview at the U.S. Consulate General in \n6 \nDubai, UAE, on September 12, 2017, twelve days before the signing of the Proclamation, and \n7 \nwere told that their visas would be ready in two weeks.  \n8 \n197.  On October 3, 2017, they received an email from the Consulate requesting that they send \n9 \ntheir passports so that their visas could be stamped. They complied with this request. \n10 \n198.  Eleven days later, their passports were returned with no visas and with a letter stating that \n11 \ntheir applications had been placed in administrative processing.  \n12 \n199.  After following up multiple times with the Consulate and receiving only automated \n13 \nresponses, Mr. and Mrs. Azizikoutenaei received boilerplate rejection letters on January 10, \n14 \n15  2018.  \n16  200.  At  no  point  were  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Azizikoutenaei  informed  that  they  could  seek  to \n17  “demonstrate” their eligibility for a waiver under the terms of the Proclamation.  \n18 \n201.  At no point were Mr. and Mrs. Azizikoutenaei provided an opportunity to apply for a \n19 \nwaiver or to submit documents in support of such application. \n20 \n202.  Accordingly, the consular officer was not made aware of the particular reasons they wanted \n21 \nto visit their family in the United States or their recent medical circumstances. \n22 \n23 \n                                                \n24 \n \nor contests, if not being paid for participating”; and “Enrollment in a short recreational course of study, not for credit \n25 \ntoward a degree.” Id.    \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 43 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 44 of 68\n  \n1  203.  Mr. and Mrs. Azizikoutenaei’s case fits within one of the examples provided in the \n2  Proclamation as a situation in which a grant of a waiver may be appropriate.  \n3 \n204.  The entire family has suffered and is continuing to suffer significant emotional distress \n4 \nbecause of their ongoing separation from each other. Mr. and Mrs. Azizikoutenaei continue to be \n5 \nweakened by their surgeries and medical conditions, and they and Mr. Azizi are distressed at their \n6 \ninability to spend time with each other.  \n7 \n205.

Maral Charkhtab Tabrizi, Zahra Rouzbehani, and Bahram Charkhtab Tabrizi \n10   \n206.  Plaintiff Maral Charkhtab Tabrizi is a lawful permanent resident of Iranian origin \n11 \nresiding in Arizona who is married to a U.S. citizen and who recently had her first child.  \n12 \n207.  Her  parents,  Plaintiffs  Zahra  Rouzbehani  and Bahram  Charkhtab  Tabrizi,  who  have \n13 \ntraveled to the United States many times in the past, applied for tourist visas while she was \n14 \n15  pregnant to witness the birth of their first grandchild and to provide support to their daughter.  \n16  208.  They attended their interviews at the U.S. Consulate General in Dubai, UAE, on October \n17  19, 2017. Ms. Rouzbehani was approved immediately, but Mr. Charkhtab Tabrizi’s case was \n18 \nplaced  in  administrative  processing.  Ms.  Rouzbehani  elected  to  wait  for  her  husband’s \n19 \nadministrative processing to be completed before sending her passport to be stamped with the visa, \n20 \nso that they could travel to the United States together.  \n21 \n209.  Immediately after the Supreme Court allowed the Proclamation to go into effect in \n22 \nDecember 2017, Ms. Rouzbehani sent her passport to the Consulate in order for her visa to be \n23 \nissued.  \n24 \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 44 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 45 of 68\n  \n1  210.  Shortly thereafter, however, the passport was returned without a visa and both their visas \n2  were refused pursuant to the Proclamation. \n3 \n211.  At no point were Mr. Charkhtab Tabrizi and Ms. Rouzbehani informed that they could seek \n4 \nto “demonstrate” their eligibility for a waiver under the terms of the Proclamation.  \n5 \n212.  At no point were Mr. Charkhtab Tabrizi and Ms. Rouzbehani provided an opportunity to \n6 \napply for a waiver or to submit documents in support of such application. \n7 \n213.  Accordingly, the consular officer was not made aware of specific circumstances that are \n8 \nhighly relevant to a meaningful waiver adjudication. Mr. Charkhtab Tabrizi and Ms. Rouzbehani \n9 \nwanted to be there to support their daughter for several compelling reasons:  \n10 \n214.  First, Ms. Charkhtab Tabrizi’s household finances depend heavily on her salary. She is a \n11 \ncontractor for Google and had been there for less than 12 months at the time she gave birth to her \n12 \nchild. She therefore was not eligible for paid maternity leave under California laws or under the \n13 \nFamily Medical Leave Act, and had accordingly planned to return to work as soon as possible. \n14 \n15  Without her parents, Ms. Charkhtab Tabrizi was unable to return to work as quickly as she had \n16  hoped.  \n17  215.  Second, Ms. Charkhtab Tabrizi has a connective tissue disorder which has caused her \n18 \nsevere pain during her pregnancy and makes her daily activities very difficult. She had hoped that \n19 \nher parents could be there to support her during her recovery.  \n20 \n216.  Instead, she had to remain at home with her baby by herself for two and a half months \n21 \nwhile recovering from an emergency cesarean section, and during that time was diagnosed with \n22 \ndepression. She is currently unable to afford good daycare and has resorted to temporarily relying \n23 \non her sister-in-law to take care of her child after a period of unpaid leave during which she and \n24 \nher husband depleted their savings. They had also been hoping that her parents could meet her in-\n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 45 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 46 of 68\n  \n1  laws for the first time when they visited, but her father-in-law has passed away in the intervening \n2  time since they applied for the visa. She continues to be in desperate need of emotional and \n3 \nlogistical support from her parents.  \n4 \n217.  Ms. Rouzbehani and Mr. Charkhtab Tabrizi’s case fits within one of the examples provided \n5 \nin the Proclamation as a situation in which a grant of a waiver may be appropriate.  \n6 \n218.  The  denial  of  Ms.  Rouzbehani’s  and  Mr.  Charkhtab  Tabrizi’s  visas  is  causing  Ms. \n7 \nCharkhtab Tabrizi severe financial hardship.  \n8 \n219.  All three family members have also suffered significant emotional distress. Ms. Charkhtab \n9 \nTabrizi was deprived of the opportunity to have her parents present during her pregnancy, and her \n10 \nparents have been unable to be there to support her in her time of need. Ms. Rouzbehani and Mr. \n11 \nCharkhtab Tabrizi were unable to be there for the birth of their first grandchild, and were unable \n12 \nto ever meet their daughter’s father-in-law.  \n13 \n220.  Ms. Charkhtab Tabrizi has also suffered increased physical pain because she has to carry \n14 \n15  out daily tasks for which she would have been able to rely on her parents’ assistance.  \n16  221.  Ms. Charkhtab Tabrizi and her parents have paid thousands of dollars in filing fees, travel \n17  costs, and other costs associated with the visa application process, which they will be unable to \n18 \nrecover.  \n19 \niii.  Maryam Mozafari and Mohammad Mehdi Mozaffary \n20 \n222.  Plaintiff Maryam Mozafari is a lawful permanent resident of Iranian origin, currently \n21 \nresiding in San Francisco, California. She was pregnant and wanted her parents, her mother and \n22 \nPlaintiff Mr. Mohammad Mehdi Mozaffary, to come visit her and provide her with much-needed \n23 \nsupport.  \n24 \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 46 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 47 of 68\n  \n1  223.  Her mother and Mr. Mozaffary had both visited the United States in 2014, and had left the \n2  country well in advance of the expiration of their visas and their approved duration of stay in the \n3 \nUnited States.  \n4 \n224.  On December 28, 2016, they applied for tourist visas at the U.S. Consulate General in \n5 \nDubai, UAE. Her mother’s visa was granted immediately. Mr. Mozaffary was asked for his \n6 \nmandatory military service documents. He did not have them with him, as the documents were not \n7 \nmentioned in the list of required documents for the visa application. He was asked to reapply and \n8 \nbring the documents with him to the next interview.  \n9 \n225.  Because of the timing of the first two travel bans, Mr. Mozaffary had to delay his interview, \n10 \nand was not able to get back to the Consulate until July 30, 2017. He was told by the consular \n11 \nofficer that his documents appeared to be in order, but that he would be sending Mr. Mozaffary \n12 \nadditional forms to fill out. Mr. Mozaffary received the forms in August 2017 and returned them \n13 \nto the Consulate shortly thereafter.  \n14 \n15  226.  For the next several months, Ms. Mozafari and Mr. Mozaffary sent several emails to the \n16  Consulate to inquire about the status of their cases, but received no reply or a system-generated \n17  automatic response.  \n18 \n227.  On January 11, 2018, Mr. Mozaffary’s visa was denied pursuant to the Proclamation.  \n19 \n228.  At no point was Mr. Mozaffary informed that he could seek to “demonstrate” his eligibility \n20 \nfor a waiver under the terms of the Proclamation.  \n21 \n229.  At no point was Mr. Mozaffary provided an opportunity to apply for a waiver or to submit \n22 \ndocuments in support of such application. \n23 \n230.  Mr. Mozaffary suffers from a heart condition which requires that he be accompanied at all \n24 \ntimes. Because he was unable to obtain a visa, Ms. Mozafari’s mother was only able to come visit \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 47 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 48 of 68\n  \n1  her in the United States for a brief time, as she felt torn between her daughter and being forced to \n2  leave her ailing husband behind.  \n3 \niv.

Mr. Farnoudian and Ms. Emami have visited the United States in the past and have fully \n10  complied with the terms of their tourist visas.  \n11 \n233.  Mr. Farnoudian and Ms. Emami attended their visa interview on October 17, 2017 at the \n12 \nU.S. Consulate General in Dubai, UAE.  \n13 \n234.  Mr.  Farnoudian’s  visa  application  was  placed  in  administrative  processing,  but  Ms. \n14 \nEmami’s visa application was approved.  \n15 \n235.  Mr. Farnoudian received an email on January 8, 2018, informing him that his visa had been \n16 \ndenied pursuant to the Proclamation.  \n17 \n236.  Ms. Emami’s visa, meanwhile, was revoked. She was never notified that her already-\n18 \napproved visa had been revoked pursuant to the Proclamation, and she only found out that that \n19 \nwas the case after checking the status of her visa online.  \n20 \n237.  At no point was anyone in the family informed that Mr. Farnoudian and Ms. Emami could \n21 \nseek to “demonstrate” their eligibility for a waiver under the terms of the Proclamation.  \n22 \n23  238.  At no point were Mr. Farnoudian and Ms. Emami provided an opportunity to apply for \n24  such a waiver or to submit documents in support of such application.  \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 48 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 49 of 68\n  \n1  239.  Mr. Tedrick and Ms. Farnoodian-Tedrick were therefore forced to cancel their planned \n2  wedding celebration until such time that her parents would be able to attend. \n3 \n240.  All family members have suffered emotional distress because of their inability to celebrate \n4 \nMr. Tedrick and Ms. Farnoodian-Tedrick’s wedding together with their closest family members.   \n5 \n241.  The family has also suffered significant financial losses. Mr. Tedrick and Ms. Farnoodian-\n6 \nTedrick forfeited almost $4,000 in non-refundable deposits because they were compelled to cancel \n7 \ntheir planned celebration. Mr. Farnoudian and Ms. Emami also paid thousands of dollars in filing \n8 \nfees, travel costs, and other costs associated with the visa application process, which they will be \n9 \nunable to recover.  \n10 \nD. Business and investment visa applicants  \n11 \ni.  Behnam Babalou \n12 \n242.  Mr. Behnam Babalou is an Iranian national who invested five hundred thousand dollars \n13 \n($500,000) in the United States as part of his petition for an employment-based fifth preference \n14 \n15  (EB-5) investment visa12 in 2011.  \n16  243.  USCIS adjudicated his case and sent him an approval notice four years later, on December \n17  15, 2015. Mr. Babalou then attended his immigrant visa interview at the U.S. Embassy in Yerevan, \n18 \nArmenia, on May 24, 2016, after which his case was placed in administrative processing.  \n19 \n244.  On December 22, 2017, six years after his initial investment, he received a boilerplate email \n20 \ndenying him a visa and a waiver under the Proclamation. \n21 \n                                                \n22 \n \n23  12 The EB-5 investment visa is designed to give permanent resident status to entrepreneurs (and their spouses and \nunmarried children under 21) who (1) “[m]ake the necessary investment in a commercial enterprise in the United \nStates” (either $500,000 or $1 million); and (2) “[p]lan to create or preserve 10 permanent full-time jobs for \n24 \nqualified U.S. workers.” U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Servs., U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., EB-5 Immigrant \nInvestor Program, https://www.uscis.gov/eb-5 (last visited Feb. 22, 2019). \n25 \n \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 49 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 50 of 68\n  \n1  245.

At no point was Mr. Babalou provided an opportunity to apply for a waiver or to submit \n4 \ndocuments in support of such application.  \n5 \n247.  His immigration attorneys have since requested that he be considered for a waiver, but he \n6 \nhas not received a response.    \n7 \n248.  Mr. Babalou is at risk of losing his $500,000 investment in the United States. Because he \n8 \nremains in Iran, he is unable to fulfill the duties assigned to him as part of running his business, \n9 \nunable to oversee the U.S. citizens he has employed, and therefore unable to effectively grow his \n10 \nbusiness and continue contributing to the U.S. economy.  \n11 \n249.  In addition to the large investment he made into a U.S. business, Mr. Babalou has incurred \n12 \nsubstantial incidental costs over the last seven years, including $50,000 paid to a regional center \n13 \nfor assistance with overseeing his investment and thousands of dollars more in attorneys’ fees, \n14 \n15  filing fees, travel costs, and medical fees. These are costs Mr. Babalou will be unable to recover. \n16  ii.  Hoda Mehrabi Mohammad Abadi \n17  250.

USCIS adjudicated her case and sent her an approval notice nearly two years later, on June \n21 \n9, 2016. Ms. Mehrabi Mohammad Abadi attended her immigrant visa interview at the U.S. \n22 \nEmbassy in Yerevan, Armenia, on February 23, 2017, after which her case was placed in \n23 \nadministrative processing.  \n24 \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 50 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 51 of 68\n  \n1  252.  On December 14, 2017, her attorney received the same boilerplate email denying her a visa \n2  and a waiver under the Proclamation.  \n3 \n253.  At  no  point  was  Ms.  Mehrabi  Mohammad  Abadi  informed  that  she  could  seek  to \n4 \n“demonstrate” her eligibility for a waiver under the terms of the Proclamation.  \n5 \n254.  At no point was Ms. Mehrabi Mohammad Abadi provided an opportunity to apply for a \n6 \nwaiver or to submit documents in support of such application.  \n7 \n255.  Her attorney contacted the Embassy requesting that Ms. Mehrabi Mohammad Abadi’s case \n8 \nbe considered for a waiver from the Proclamation. The Embassy responded again on December \n9 \n17, 2017, with the following: \n10 \nDear inquirer, \n11 \n \nUnfortunately,  your  case  is  not  eligible  for  a  waiver  under \n12 \nPresidential Proclamation 9645. This refusal under Section 212(f) of \nthe Immigration and Nationality Act applies only to the current visa \n13 \napplication.

Accordingly, Ms. Mehrabi Mohammad Abadi was unable to submit documents in support \n18 \nof a waiver application and did not receive individualized consideration for a waiver.  \n19 \n257.  Ms. Mehrabi Mohammad Abadi is also at risk of losing a $500,000 investment in the \n20 \nUnited States. Because she remains in Iran, she is unable to fulfill the duties assigned to her as part \n21 \nof running a business, unable to oversee the U.S. citizens she has employed, and therefore unable \n22 \nto effectively grow her business and continue contributing to the U.S. economy.  \n23 \n258.

These are costs Ms. Mehrabi Mohammad Abadi will never recover.  \n3 \nE.  Individuals with extraordinary ability  \n4 \ni.  Dr. Mahdi Afshar Arjmand \n5 \n259.  Plaintiff Dr. Mahdi Afshar Arjmand is an Iranian national who filed for an employment-\n6 \nbased first preference visa for aliens with extraordinary ability (EB-1A)13 immigrant visa on \n7 \nDecember 27, 2016, and received an approval notice on January 9, 2017.  \n8 \n260.  He attended his immigrant visa interview with his family on July 25, 2017 at the U.S. \n9 \nEmbassy in Yerevan, Armenia. The officer informed them that their case looked good, but just \n10 \nneeded to go through administrative processing.  \n11 \n261.  On January 12, 2018, the Embassy emailed Dr. Afshar Arjmand the same boilerplate denial \n12 \nletter that Mr. Babalou and Ms. Mehrabi Mohammad Abadi received.  \n13 \n262.  At no point was Dr. Afshar Arjmand informed that he could seek to “demonstrate” his \n14 \n15  eligibility for a waiver under the terms of the Proclamation.  \n16  263.  At no point was Dr. Afshar Arjmand provided an opportunity to apply for a waiver or to \n17  submit documents in support of such application.  \n18 \n264.  In order to approve his visa, USCIS made a required finding that Dr. Afshar Arjmand has \n19 \n“extraordinary ability”—a fact that should render his entry in the national interest of the United \n20 \nStates. Dr. Afshar Arjmand had a job offer from the University of California, San Diego, to work \n21 \n                                                \n22 \n \n23  13 To qualify for an EB-1A visa an applicant “must be able to demonstrate extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, \neducation, business, or athletics through sustained national or international acclaim.” U.S. Citizenship & \nImmigration Servs., U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., Employment-Based Immigration: First Preference EB-1 (last \n24 \nupdated Oct. 29, 2015), https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-\nimmigration-first-preference-eb-1. \n25 \n \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 52 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 53 of 68\n  \n1  as a researcher and professor. The Embassy refused to consider Dr. Afshar Arjmand for a waiver \n2  even though the university sent multiple emails to the Embassy requesting that it issue Dr. Afshar \n3 \nArjmand's visa because of his prodigious talent and expertise. \n4 \n265.  Dr. Afshar Arjmand’s case fits within one of the examples provided in the Proclamation as \n5 \na situation in which a grant of a waiver would be appropriate.  \n6 \n266.  Dr. Afshar Arjmand risks losing a once-in-a-lifetime research and teaching opportunity at \n7 \nthe University of California, San Diego, one of the world's leading public research universities. \n8 \n267.   In addition to this significant lost work and financial opportunity, Dr. Afshar Arjmand has \n9 \npaid thousands of dollars in attorneys’ fees, filing fees, travel costs, and medical fees, which he \n10 \nwill be unable to recover. \n11 \nii.  Dr. Ehsan Heidaryan \n12 \n268.

He attended his immigrant visa interview at the U.S. \n18 \nConsulate General in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on December 23, 2017.  \n19 \n270.  Thereafter, the Consulate emailed Dr. Heidaryan to inform him that since he is an Iranian \n20 \nnational, his immigrant visa must be refused because of the Proclamation. Specifically, the \n21 \nConsulate wrote: \n22 \nDear Sir, \n23 \nUnfortunately your immigrant visa is refused under Presidential \n24  Proclamation 9645 and now considered closed.

Dr. Heidaryan is losing the opportunity to conduct research and to teach in his area of \n13 \nexpertise—chemical engineering—in the United States’ top tier universities. He is also losing the \n14 \n15  opportunity  to  take  advantage  of  the  substantial  resources  U.S.  universities  have  to  more \n16  effectively further his research and, thus, the opportunity to contribute his expertise to the United \n17  States.  \n18 \n276.

After the ban went into effect, his attorneys attempted to request a waiver for him, but were \n2  told that he is ineligible for a waiver because he has insufficient ties to the United States—a factor \n3 \nthat is neither a requirement for an EB-1 visa nor a requirement under the waiver factors set forth \n4 \nin the Proclamation.  \n5 \n298.  At no point was Mr. Hamami informed that he could seek to “demonstrate” his eligibility \n6 \nfor a waiver under the terms of the Proclamation.  \n7 \n299.

The Class meets the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)(1) because it is \n16  so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. The number of individuals who have \n17  been wrongly denied waivers or whose waiver applications are being stalled is not known with \n18 \nprecision by Plaintiffs but is easily ascertainable by Defendants. On any given day, thousands of \n19 \nvisa applications are adjudicated at embassies and consulates abroad. As such, more individuals \n20 \nwill  become  Class  members  in  the  future,  as  Defendants  continue  to  deny  applicants  the \n21 \nopportunity to demonstrate their eligibility for waivers under the Proclamation. The members of \n22 \nthe Class are ascertainable and identifiable by Defendants. \n23 \n306.

Plaintiffs and the Class share the same \n5 \nlegal claims, which include, but are not limited to: whether Defendants’ failure to consider all visa \n6 \napplicants for waivers, their failure to issue clear guidance, and their failure to provide an \n7 \naccessible, meaningful process by which individuals can seek to demonstrate their eligibility for a \n8 \nwaiver violate the APA and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  \n9 \n307.  Similarly, the Class meets the typicality requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n10 \n23(a)(3) because the claims of the representative Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the Class as \n11 \na whole. Plaintiffs, as with the Class they seek to represent, are all individuals who have been or \n12 \nwill be denied the chance to request a waiver under the Proclamation and who have been or will \n13 \nbe hindered from demonstrating their eligibility for a waiver because of Defendants’ failure to \n14 \n15  provide clear guidance and an accessible process for submitting applications.  \n16  308.  The adequacy requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)(4) are also met. \n17  Plaintiffs know of no conflict between their interests and those of the Class. Plaintiffs seek the \n18 \nsame relief as other members of the Class, namely that the Court order Defendants to: (a) provide \n19 \nclear guidance and an orderly process by which applicants may demonstrate their eligibility for a \n20 \nwaiver; (b) evaluate whether applicants previously denied waivers under an unlawful policy should \n21 \nbe reconsidered for a waiver grant; (c) act on waivers that have been pending for an unreasonable \n22 \nperiod of time; and (d) give full consideration for case-by-case waivers to all visa applicants as set \n23 \nforth in the Proclamation.  \n24 \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 60 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 61 of 68\n  \n1  309.   (a) order Defendants to immediately cease their unlawful policy and/or practice of refusing \n2  to receive or consider requests for waivers under the Proclamation for all visa applicants; (b) \n3 \nprovide an orderly process by which applicants may demonstrate their eligibility for a waiver; and \n4 \n(c) give full consideration for case-by-case waivers to all visa applicants as set forth in the \n5 \nProclamation. In defending their own rights, the individual Plaintiffs will defend the rights of all \n6 \nClass members fairly and adequately. Plaintiffs are represented by counsel with deep knowledge \n7 \nof immigration law and civil rights law and with extensive experience litigating complex cases \n8 \nand class actions. Counsel have the requisite level of expertise to adequately prosecute this case \n9 \non behalf of Plaintiffs and the Class. \n10 \n310.  The Class satisfies Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) because Defendants have \n11 \nacted on grounds generally applicable to the Class. Thus, final injunctive and declaratory relief is \n12 \nappropriate with respect to the Class as a whole.  \n13 \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n14 \n15  FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of Administrative Procedure Act)  \n16   \n311.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in the \n17 \npreceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n18 \n312.  The  APA  prohibits  federal  agency  action  that is  “arbitrary,  capricious,  an  abuse  of \n19 \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,” or is conducted “without observance of \n20 \nprocedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) and (D). \n21 \n313.  Defendants have either failed to promulgate guidance or have promulgated guidance that \n22 \n23  is arbitrary and capricious on its face in that it contradicts the terms of the Proclamation and \n24  provides conflicting information to both consular officials and applicants. \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 61 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 62 of 68\n  \n1  314.  Defendants have further failed to follow their own policies and procedures and have put in \n2  place a waiver process in which applicants are denied waivers without ever receiving notice or an \n3 \nopportunity to apply, applicants are denied waivers without having had a consular interview since \n4 \nthe time the Proclamation went into effect, applicants are denied waivers in a manner that \n5 \ncontravenes well-established regulations including 22 C.F.R. §§ 41.121 and 42.81 and the Foreign \n6 \nAffairs Manual, and applicants’ visa and waiver applications are indefinitely stalled. \n7 \n315.  Defendants have also failed to follow their own stated policy by failing to create an orderly \n8 \nprocess for waiver applications and by failing to consider all visa applicants for a waiver.  \n9 \n316.  In failing to comply with their own procedures and policies, Defendants’ actions are \n10 \narbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law, in violation \n11 \nof the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n12 \n317.  Because Defendants’ actions violate their own procedures and policies, they should be set \n13 \naside. See United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260 (1954). \n14 \n15  318.  Defendants’ violations of these laws have harmed and continue to harm Plaintiffs and \n16  proposed Class members by indefinitely denying them access to their families and to economic \n17  and professional opportunities. \n18  SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of Procedural Due Process under the Fifth Amendment) \n19 \n \n319.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in the \n20 \npreceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n21 \n320.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits the federal government from \n22 \n23  depriving individuals of their fundamental rights without due process of law.  \n24 \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 62 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 63 of 68\n  \n1  321.  Family Member Plaintiffs’ fundamental rights include their right to the \"integrity of the \n2  family unit.\" Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 651 (1972). This includes a cognizable liberty \n3 \ninterest in their family members’ ability to travel to the United States. See Bustamante v. Mukasey, \n4 \n531 F.3d 1059, 1062 (9th Cir. 2008); see also Kerry v. Din, 135 S.Ct. 2128, 2139 (2018) (Kennedy, \n5 \nJ., concurring); Cardenas v. United States, 826 F.3d 1164, 1167 (9th Cir. 2016) (noting that J. \n6 \nKennedy’s concurrence in Din is controlling). \n7 \n322.  Congress has granted statutory rights and prescribed procedures applicable to prospective \n8 \nimmigrants and non-immigrants. Due process rights attach to those statutory rights, which create \n9 \ncognizable liberty and property interests for both Family Member Plaintiffs and Visa Applicant \n10 \nPlaintiffs. See Lanza v. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d 917, 927 (9th Cir. 2004) (“The due process afforded \n11 \naliens stems from those statutory rights granted by Congress and the principle that ‘[m]inimum \n12 \ndue process rights attach to statutory rights.’”) (alteration in original) (quoting Dia v. Ashcroft, 353 \n13 \nF.3d 228, 239 (3d Cir. 2003). Those interests include reliance interests on the basis of which \n14 \n15  Plaintiffs have spent significant resources. See Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 601 (1972) \n16  (mutually explicit expectations give rise to property interests).  \n17  323.  The “very essence” of due process is the “protection of the individual against arbitrary \n18 \naction.” Bd. of Regents of State Colls. v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 584 (1972). Any deprivation of liberty \n19 \nand property interests must, at the very least, have a rational basis.   \n20 \n324.  The waiver process Defendants have implemented is inherently arbitrary and has deprived \n21 \nPlaintiffs of even the most minimal process that attaches to the statutory benefits conferred on \n22 \nthem by Congress. By not allowing them or their family members the opportunity to apply or be \n23 \nmeaningfully considered for a waiver, Defendants have deprived them of any opportunity to show \n24 \nthat they meet the eligibility criteria for visa categories for which they or their family members are \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 63 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 64 of 68\n  \n1  eligible by statute. In doing so, Defendants have deprived Plaintiffs of protected liberty and \n2  property interests without due process of law. \n3 \n325.  Defendants’ actions have therefore violated Plaintiffs’ right to procedural due process.   \n4 \n326.  Defendants’ procedural due process violations have harmed and continue to harm Plaintiffs \n5 \nand proposed Class members by indefinitely denying them access to their families and to economic \n6 \nand research opportunities. \n7 \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n8  (Violation of Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment) \n9  327.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in the \n10  preceding paragraphs as if set forth fully herein. \n11 \n328.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees all \n12 \nindividuals equal protection under the law. \n13 \n329.  In Trump v. Hawaii, the Supreme Court relied centrally on the asserted existence of a \n14 \nmeaningful waiver process to find that the plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on the merits of their \n15 \nconstitutional claims. See 585 U.S. ___, 138 S. Ct. 2392, 2422-23 (2018). In the absence of a \n16 \nmeaningful waiver process, Plaintiffs are being denied visas and waivers or are having their \n17 \napplications indefinitely stalled based solely on their national origin or religion, without any \n18 \nrational basis.  \n19 \n330.  The  absence  of  a  meaningful  waiver  process  and  the  blanket  denials  of  waivers  to \n20 \napplicants from banned countries, without the opportunity to demonstrate their eligibility for a \n21 \nwaiver from the Proclamation, amount to intentional discrimination based on national origin or \n22 \n23  religion, without any lawful justification.  \n24  331.  Defendants’ conduct violates the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection.  \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 64 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 65 of 68\n  \n1  332.  Defendants’ equal protection violations have harmed and continue to harm Plaintiffs and \n2  proposed Class members by indefinitely denying them access to their families and to economic \n3 \nand research opportunities. \n4 \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Mandamus) \n5 \n \n6  333.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in the \n7  preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n8  334.  The APA requires agencies to “proceed to conclude a matter presented” to the agency \n9  “within a reasonable time.” 5 U.S.C. § 555(b).  \n10 \n335.  Defendants have a non-discretionary duty to develop guidance on the waiver process and \n11 \nto receive and fully and fairly adjudicate applicants’ requests for waivers under the Proclamation \n12 \nwithin a reasonable time.  \n13 \n336.  The Proclamation first went fully into effect on December 4, 2017. More than a year has \n14 \npassed and Defendants have nonetheless failed to develop meaningful guidance and a waiver \n15 \nprocess by which every individual applicant may receive full consideration for a waiver. \n16 \n337.  Further, many individual Plaintiffs in this action have been awaiting decisions on their visa \n17 \nand waiver applications for several months up to well over a year. In failing to adjudicate their \n18 \napplications, Defendants have failed to act “within a reasonable time” in violation of the APA. \n19 \n338.  In addition, Plaintiffs whose family members were told at the interview that their visas \n20 \nwould be approved or who were issued visas that were later revoked pursuant to the Proclamation \n21 \n22  are entitled to immediate issuance of visas. This is because the approval of their visas was reversed \n23  in contravention to the explicit terms of the Proclamation and agency guidance, which provides \n24 \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 65 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 66 of 68\n  \n1  that no visas will be revoked. See Alharbi v. Miller, No. 1:18-cv-02435 (E.D.N.Y. filed April 25, \n2  2018).  \n3 \n339.  Because  there  are  no  other  adequate  remedies  available  to  Plaintiffs,  mandamus  is \n4 \nappropriate. See 5 U.S.C. § 704. \n5 \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n6 \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray that this Court: \n7 \n1.  Declare that Defendants’ actions in implementing and enforcing Section 3(c) of the \n8 \nProclamation have been arbitrary, capricious, and otherwise contrary to law; \n9 \n2.  Declare that Defendants’ actions in implementing and enforcing Section 3(c) of the \n10 \nProclamation have violated Plaintiffs’ procedural due process and equal protection rights \n11 \nunder the Fifth Amendment; \n12 \n3.  Order Defendants to issue guidance and develop a waiver process that does not violate the \n13 \nAPA or the constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection and that provides \n14 \n15  meaningful consideration to every individual visa applicant; \n16  4.  Order Defendants to evaluate whether individual and Class member applicants previously \n17  denied waivers under an unlawful process should be reconsidered for a waiver grant; \n18 \n5.  Order Defendants to act on waivers that have been pending for an unreasonable period of \n19 \ntime; \n20 \n6.  Award Plaintiffs costs of suit and reasonable attorney’s fees under the Equal Access to \n21 \nJustice Act and any other applicable law; and \n22 \n7.  Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems equitable, just, and proper. \n23 \n DATED: February 23, 2019  \n24         Washington, DC \n \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 66 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 67 of 68\n  \n1    Respectfully Submitted, \n \n2       \n/s/ Sirine Shebaya  /s/ Shabnam Lotfi \n3 \nMUSLIM ADVOCATES    LOTFI LEGAL, LLC \nSIRINE SHEBAYA (pro hac vice)  SHABNAM LOTFI (pro hac vice)   \n4 \nsirine@muslimadvocates.org   shabnam@lotfilegal.com   \nNIMRA AZMI (pro hac vice)*  VERONICA SUSTIC (pro hac vice)  \n5 \nnimra@muslimadvocates.org  veronica@lotfilegal.com \nJOSEPH SAEI (CA SBN 321341)* \n6 \nyusuf@muslimadvocates.org  \n7         \nAttorneys for Plaintiffs \n8   \n* Not admitted to practice in DC; supervised by members of the DC bar \n9     \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nSECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT - 67 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 75   Filed 02/23/19   Page 68 of 68\n  \n1   \nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE \n2   \n  I hereby certify that on February 23, 2019, I electronically filed the foregoing document \n3 \nwith the Clerk of the Court using CM/ECF.

Mania Pour Aghdasi is a U.S. citizen residing in California. In September 2016, Ms. \n12 \nAghdasi’s brother passed away after battling brain cancer in the house in which her father lived \n13 \nin Iran. Ms. Aghdasi is her father’s last remaining family member. She assisted her father, a 78-\n14 \nyear-old Iranian national, in applying for a visitor’s visa so they could be together in their grief. \n15 \nDuring the long 14 months that followed, Ms. Aghdasi repeatedly contacted the U.S. Embassy, \n16 \nher congressional representatives, the State Department, the White House—anyone who would \n17 \nlisten—to get her father’s visa approved as his health deteriorated. Ms. Aghdasi’s father died on \n18 \nDecember 24, 2017, waiting for his visa to be issued. Two weeks later, his visa application was \n19 \ndenied pursuant to the Presidential Proclamation that established the latest travel ban. At no \n20 \npoint did anyone consider Ms. Aghdasi’s father for a waiver from the travel ban. Nonetheless \n21 \nhis visa was denied. Ms. Aghdasi’s story is emblematic of the destruction and tragedy that has \n22 \n23  been wrought by the Proclamation’s reckless implementation, but her experience is sadly not \n24  uncommon.  \n25 \nCOMPLAINT - 2 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 1   Filed 03/13/18   Page 3 of 45\n \n1  2.  Plaintiffs and proposed class members are American citizens, U.S. lawful permanent \n2  residents, and foreign nationals who have approved visa petitions, or who have assisted family \n3 \nmembers with filing for U.S. visas, and who seek entry to the United States to be reunited with \n4 \ntheir American families or fulfill significant U.S. business relations.  \n5 \n3.  In 2017, President Donald J. Trump attempted to institute three travel bans via executive \n6 \norder and presidential proclamation. Each ban applied mostly to Muslim-majority countries. The \n7 \nfirst two versions were struck down by federal district and appellate courts. The constitutionality \n8 \nof the third travel ban is currently being litigated at the U.S. Supreme Court. On December 4, \n9 \n2017, the Court issued a decision allowing the third travel ban to be implemented while the case \n10 \nwas heard on its merits.  \n11 \n4.  On December 8, 2017, Defendants began implementing the third version of the travel \n12 \nban in a way that violates the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), the Immigration and \n13 \nNationality Act (“INA”), and Plaintiffs’ right to due process under the Fifth Amendment to the \n14 \n15  U.S. Constitution. The Presidential Proclamation (“Proclamation”) that established this ban \n16  specifically states that “case-by-case waivers” may be granted by consular officers under a non-\n17  exclusive list of circumstances for visa applicants from the banned countries. Nonetheless, in \n18 \ndirect contravention of the terms of the Proclamation, Defendants have refused to consider such \n19 \nwaivers and have instead issued blanket denials of visas, regardless of personal circumstances \n20 \nand without giving applicants the opportunity to argue their cases, thereby violating the APA, \n21 \nthe INA, and Plaintiffs’ right to Fifth Amendment due process.  \n22 \n5.  These claims are backed up by numbers published by Defendants themselves: State \n23 \nDepartment has revealed that, as of March 6, 2018, only about a hundred waivers had been \n24 \ngranted to visa applicants from the banned countries, a rejection rate of more than 98%.  \n25 \nCOMPLAINT - 3 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 1   Filed 03/13/18   Page 4 of 45\n \n1  6.  Defendants’ unlawful and discriminatory actions have shattered Plaintiffs’ lives and \n2  their prospects for being reunited with their loved ones as well as the lives and reunification \n3 \nprospects of the scores of similarly situated families and individuals they seek to represent \n4 \nthrough  this  action.  They  seek  this  Court’s  intervention  to  cease  visa  denials  due  to  the \n5 \nProclamation.  Such  intervention  is  needed  to  prevent  ongoing  and  future  harm  to  such \n6 \napplicants and to protect the integrity of the U.S. visa process.  \n7 \n7.  At issue in this suit is Section 3 of the Proclamation, which allows for case-by-case \n8 \nwaivers  from  the  Proclamation  for  visa  applicants  from  the  countries  banned  by  the \n9 \nProclamation. \n10 \n \n11 \nJURISDICTION, VENUE, AND INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT \n12 \n8.  Jurisdiction is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question), 28 U.S.C. § 1361 \n13 \n(Mandamus and Venue Act of 1962), 5 U.S.C. § 702 (APA), and 28 U.S.C. § 220 (Declaratory \n14 \n15  Judgment Act). The United States has waived its sovereign immunity pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § \n16  702. This Court may grant declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 702, 28 \n17  U.S.C. § 1651, and 28 U.S.C. § 2201–2202. A claim for attorney’s fees will be brought pursuant \n18 \nto 5 U.S.C. § 504 and 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d).  \n19 \n9.  Venue is proper in the Northern District of California under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because \n20 \nDefendants are officers or employees of the United States acting in their official capacities and \n21 \nagencies of the United States, many Plaintiffs reside in this judicial district, and no real property \n22 \nis involved in this action.  Plaintiffs have exhausted all administrative remedies. \n23 \n24 \n25 \nCOMPLAINT - 4 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 1   Filed 03/13/18   Page 5 of 45\n \n1  10.

Background \n9 \n49.  On September 24, 2017, President Trump signed the third version of the travel ban, \n10 \nPresidential Proclamation 9645, entitled “Enhancing Vetting Capabilities and Processes for \n11 \nDetecting Attempted Entry Into the United States by Terrorists or Other Public-Safety Threats.” \n12 \nPresidential  Proclamation  9645,  82  Fed.  Reg.  45161  (Sept.  27,  2017).  (Exhibit  A)  The \n13 \nProclamation provides for discretionary case-by-case waivers from a now-indefinite travel ban \n14 \n15  on nationals of the six Muslim-majority countries. \n16  50.  Affected states and individuals immediately brought suit against the Proclamation in \n17  federal district court in Hawaii and Maryland, seeking to block implementation of the travel \n18 \nban. On October 17, 2017, the Hawaii court granted a nationwide temporary restraining order \n19 \nand, the following day, the Maryland court issued a nationwide preliminary injunction.  \n20 \n51.  The government appealed these decisions to the Ninth and Fourth Circuit Courts of \n21 \nAppeal. It also requested the U.S. Supreme Court to issue a stay of the Hawaii and Maryland \n22 \ncourts’ decisions blocking the Proclamation’s implementation pending disposition of its appeals \n23 \nof  those  decisions  in  the  circuit  courts.  The  U.S.  Supreme  Court  granted  that  request  on \n24 \n25 \nCOMPLAINT - 9 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 1   Filed 03/13/18   Page 10 of 45\n \n1  Monday, December 4, 2017, thereby allowing the Proclamation’s travel ban to take full effect. \n2  Oral arguments in the circuit courts proceeded.  \n3 \n52.  On  Friday,  December  22,  2017,  the  Ninth  Circuit  affirmed  the  Hawaii  court’s \n4 \npreliminary injunction order but stayed its decision pending review by the U.S. Supreme Court. \n5 \nOn February 14, 2018, the Fourth Circuit affirmed the Maryland court’s preliminary injunction \n6 \norder, but also stayed its decision pending review by the U.S. Supreme Court.  \n7 \n53.  In the midst of the legal challenges to the Proclamation, the State Department began \n8 \nimplementing the travel ban. Since the U.S. Supreme Court allowed full implementation of the \n9 \nlatest iteration of the ban, officials at consulates and embassies in the banned countries have \n10 \nengaged  in  a  pattern  of  indiscriminately  denying  immigrant  and  non-immigrant  visas  to \n11 \napplicants from the banned countries.  \n12 \n54.  Indeed, in a response to an inquiry by two U.S. senators, the State Department has \n13 \nrevealed that, as of January 8, 2018, only two waivers were granted to applicants of the banned \n14 \n15  countries out of a total of 6,555 applicants who were eligible to be considered for waivers. \n16  Letter from Mary K. Waters, U.S. Department of State, to Chris Van Hollen, U.S. Senator (Feb. \n17  22, 2018), http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/reuterscom/1/60/60/letter.pdf (Exhibit B) As of \n18 \nMarch 6, 2018, the State Department had apparently issued 100 more waivers, meaning that \n19 \nconsular officers have rejected more than 98% of visa applicants. Yaganeh Torbati & Mica \n20 \nRosenberg, Exclusive: Visa Waivers Rarely Granted Under Trump’s Latest U.S. Travel Ban, \n21 \nReuters  (Mar.  6,  2018),  https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-travelban-\n22 \nexclusive/exclusive-visa-waivers-rarely-granted-under-trumps-latest-u-s-travel-ban-data-\n23 \nidUSKCN1GI2DW.

The two most recent versions of the travel ban specifically provided for “case-by-case \n2  waivers” to be granted by consular officers under a non-exclusive list of circumstances for visa \n3 \napplicants from the banned countries. Nonetheless, in direct contravention of the terms of the \n4 \nProclamation, Defendants have refused to consider such waivers and have instead issued blanket \n5 \ndenials  of  visas,  regardless  of  personal  circumstances  and  without  giving  applicants  the \n6 \nopportunity to argue their cases. Thus, irrespective of an applicant’s personal circumstances or \n7 \nbona fide relationship to the United States, the government has found a way to circumvent both \n8 \nthe courts and its own instruction and fully implement the Muslim travel ban. \n9 \n56.  A  mere  three  days  after  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court’s  lifting  of  the  stays  preventing \n10 \nimplementation  of  the  travel  ban,  the  State  Department,  without  taking  time  to  develop \n11 \nstandards or protocols, recklessly and irresponsibly executed a ban that greatly harmed, and \n12 \ncontinues to harm, more than 150 million visa applicants worldwide. Visa applicants contacted \n13 \nembassies and consulates abroad to ask for clarity but were given the runaround. Attorneys \n14 \n15  contacted  the  State  Department  for  clarification  but  received  inadequate  and  inconsistent \n16  responses.  The  problem  continues.  As  of  the  date  of  filing  of  this  complaint,  the  State \n17  Department also lacks protocols for considering waiver applications for individuals whose cases \n18  were  pending  administrative  processing1 at  the  time  the  ban  went  into  effect  and  for  visa \n19 \napplicants whose visas were approved prior to implementation of the ban. \n20 \n21 \n                                                 \n \n22 \n1 Administrative processing is a period after a visa interview during which applicants undergo \n23  additional screening outside of “normal” visa processing.

The process remains so opaque that, in addition to the formal request for information \n2  from U.S. senators, civil rights organizations have filed a FOIA request seeking documents from \n3 \nthe State Department related to the travel ban waiver process. (Exhibit D) As of the date of \n4 \nfiling, Defendants have not yet complied with the request.  \n5 \n \n6 \nII.  Relevant Law \n7 \n58.  Section 3 of the Proclamation contains a subsection entitled “Waivers,” which states: \n8 \nNotwithstanding the suspensions of and limitations on entry set \n9  forth in section 2 of this proclamation, a consular officer, or the \nCommissioner,  United  States  Customs  and  Border  Protection \n10  (CBP), or the Commissioner’s designee, as appropriate, may, in \ntheir discretion, grant waivers on a case-by-case basis to permit \n11 \nthe  entry  of  foreign  nationals  for  whom  entry  is  otherwise \nsuspended or limited if such foreign nationals demonstrate that \n12 \nwaivers would be appropriate and consistent with subsections (i) \nthrough (iv) of this subsection [laying out waiver standards].  \n13 \n \n82 Fed. Reg. at 45167. \n14 \n15  59.  The Proclamation explains that a waiver may be granted if, in a consular officer’s or \n16  CBP’s discretion, a foreign national has demonstrated that (1) a denial of entry “would cause the \n17  foreign national undue hardship”; (2) his or her “entry would not pose a threat to the national \n18 \nsecurity or public safety of the United States”; and (3) his or her “entry would be in the national \n19 \ninterest.” 82 Fed. Reg. at 45168. \n20 \n60.  The Proclamation then specifies that while “case-by-case waivers may not be granted \n21 \ncategorically,” they “may be appropriate, subject to the limitations, conditions, and requirements \n22 \nset forth” in subsection (c), “in individual circumstances ….” Id. It proceeds to give a number of \n23 \nexamples  of  such  circumstances  under  which  issuance  of  a  waiver  may  be  appropriate, \n24 \nincluding:  \n25 \nCOMPLAINT - 12 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 1   Filed 03/13/18   Page 13 of 45\n \n1  (A)  the  foreign  national  has  previously  been  admitted  to  the \nUnited States for a continuous period of work, study, or other \n2  long-term activity, is outside the United States on the applicable \neffective date … of this proclamation, seeks to reenter the United \n3 \nStates to resume that activity, and the denial of reentry would \nimpair that activity;  \n4 \n \n(B)  the  foreign  national  has  previously  established  significant \n5 \ncontacts with the United States but is outside the United States on \nthe applicable effective date ... of this proclamation for work, \n6 \nstudy, or other lawful activity; \n \n7 \n(C)  the  foreign  national  seeks  to  enter  the  United  States  for \n8  significant business or professional obligations and the denial of \nentry would impair those obligations; \n9   \n(D) the foreign national seeks to enter the United States to visit or \n10  reside with a close family member (e.g., a spouse, child, or parent) \nwho is a United States citizen, lawful permanent resident, or alien \n11 \nlawfully admitted on a valid nonimmigrant visa, and the denial of \nentry would cause the foreign national undue hardship; \n12 \n \n(E) the foreign national is an infant, a young child or adoptee, an \n13 \nindividual needing urgent medical care, or someone whose entry \nis otherwise justified by the special circumstances of the case …. \n14 \n \n15  82 Fed. Reg. at 45169. \n16  61.  The Proclamation also instructs that, “[t]he Secretary of State and the Secretary of \n17  Homeland Security shall coordinate to adopt guidance addressing the circumstances in which \n18 \nwaivers  may  be  appropriate  for  foreign  nationals  seeking  entry  as  immigrants  or \n19 \nnonimmigrants.” 82 Fed. Reg. at 45168. It further directs the Secretaries to:  \n20 \n[A]ddress the standards, policies and procedures for: \n \n21 \n(A) determining whether the entry of a foreign national would not \npose a threat to the national security or public safety of the United \n22 \nStates; \n23   \n(B) determining whether the entry of a foreign national would be \n24  in the national interest; \n \n25 \nCOMPLAINT - 13 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 1   Filed 03/13/18   Page 14 of 45\n \n1  (C)  addressing  and  managing  the  risks  of  making  such  a \ndetermination in light of the inadequacies in information sharing, \n2  identity management, and other potential dangers posed by the \nnationals of individual countries subject to the restrictions and \n3 \nlimitations imposed by this proclamation; \n \n4 \n(D) assessing whether the United States has access, at the time of \nthe  waiver  determination,  to  sufficient  information  about  the \n5 \nforeign  national  to  determine  whether  entry  would  satisfy  the \nrequirements of subsection (i) of this subsection; and  \n6 \n \n(E)  determining  the  special  circumstances  that  would  justify \n7 \ngranting a waiver under subsection (iv)(E) of this subsection. \n8   \nId. \n9 \n62.  Defendants have not yet developed such guidance and have instead proceeded full speed \n10 \nto implement the ban, rejecting more than 98% of visa applicants. \n11 \n \n12 \nIII.  Plaintiffs have been denied due consideration for a waiver of the Proclamation \n13 \n \n63.  Plaintiff Soheil Vazehrad is a U.S. citizen who is employed as a registered dental \n14 \n15  hygienist and resides in Napa, California. He filed an application with USCIS for a fiancée visa \n16  for  his  soon-to-be  wife,  Ms.  Atefehossadat  Motavaliabyazani,  in  April  2016.  Ms. \n17  Motavaliabyazani is an Iranian national who currently resides in Iran. USCIS approved Mr. \n18 \nVazehrad's petition on May 11, 2016. Ms. Motavaliabyazani attended her interview at the U.S. \n19 \nEmbassy in Yerevan, Armenia, on October 20, 2016, and was told that her case would go \n20 \nthrough routine administrative processing. On January 4, 2018, she received an email stating the \n21 \nfollowing: \n22 \nDear Applicant: \n23   \nThis is to inform you that a consular officer found you ineligible \n24  for a visa under Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality \n25 \nCOMPLAINT - 14 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 1   Filed 03/13/18   Page 15 of 45\n \n1  Act, pursuant to Presidential Proclamation 9645. Today’s decision \ncannot be appealed.... \n2   \nTaking into account the provisions of the Proclamation, a waiver \n3 \nwill not be granted in your case.  \n \n4 \n(Exhibit E) \n64.  Thus, Ms. Motavaliabyazani’s visa was refused pursuant to the Proclamation and she \n5 \nwas ineligible for a waiver of the Proclamation, despite the facts that her fiancé, Mr. Vazehrad, \n6 \nis a U.S. citizen, that her interview took place almost a year before the Proclamation was signed, \n7 \n8  and that, once the Proclamation came into effect, she was never given the opportunity to request \n9  a waiver of the Proclamation.  \n10  65.  Mr. Benham Babalou is an Iranian national who invested five hundred thousand dollars \n11 \n($500,000.00 USD) in the United States as part of his petition for an employment-based fifth \n12 \npreference  (EB-5)  investment  visa2 in  2011.  USCIS  adjudicated  his  case  and  sent  him  an \n13 \napproval  notice  four  years  later,  on  December  15,  2015.  Mr.  Babalou  then  attended  his \n14 \nimmigrant visa interview at the U.S. Embassy in Yerevan, Armenia, on May 24, 2016, after \n15 \nwhich his case was placed in administrative processing. On December 22, 2017, six years after \n16 \nhis initial investment, he received a visa denial via an email identical to that sent to Ms. \n17 \nMotavaliabyazani. \n18 \n66.   Thus,  Mr.  Babalou’s  visa  was  refused  pursuant  to  the  Proclamation  and  he  was \n19 \nineligible for a waiver of the Proclamation, despite the facts that the Proclamation would not \n20 \n21 \n                                                 \n \n22 \n2 The EB-5 investment visa is designed to give permanent resident status to entrepreneurs (and \n23  their spouses and unmarried children under 21) who (1) “[m]ake the necessary investment in a \ncommercial enterprise in the United States” (either $500,000 or $1 million); and (2) “[p]lan to \n24  create or preserve 10 permanent full-time jobs for qualified U.S. workers.” USCIS, EB-5 \nImmigrant Investor Program, https://www.uscis.gov/eb-5 (accessed Jan. 21, 2018). \n25   \nCOMPLAINT - 15 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 1   Filed 03/13/18   Page 16 of 45\n \n1  come into existence until almost a year and a half after Mr. Babalou’s interview at the Embassy \n2  and, further, that once the Proclamation came into effect, he was never given the opportunity to \n3 \nrequest  a  waiver  of  the  Proclamation.  His  attorneys  continue  to  request  a  waiver  of  the \n4 \nProclamation to no avail.  \n5 \n67.  Ms. Hoda Mehrabi Mohammad Abadi is an Iranian national who invested five hundred \n6 \nthousand dollars ($500,000.00) in the United States as part of her petition she filed on August 5, \n7 \n2014, for an employment-based fifth preference (EB-5) investment visa. USCIS adjudicated her \n8 \ncase and sent her an approval notice nearly two years later, on June 9, 2016. Ms. Mehrabi \n9 \nMohammad Abadi attended her immigrant visa interview at the U.S. Embassy in Yerevan, \n10 \nArmenia, on February 23, 2017, after which her case was placed in administrative processing. \n11 \nOn December 14, 2017, her attorney received the same email that Mr. Babalou received stating \n12 \nthat her visa was refused pursuant to the Proclamation and she was ineligible for a waiver.  \n13 \n68.  Her attorney tried to request the Embassy to consider Ms. Mehrabi Mohammad Abadi’s \n14 \n15  case for a waiver from the Proclamation, but the Embassy responded again on December 17, \n16  2017, with the following: \n17  Dear inquirer, \n \n18 \nUnfortunately,  your  case  is  not  eligible  for  a  waiver  under \nPresidential Proclamation 9645. This refusal under Section 212(f) \n19 \nof the Immigration and Nationality Act applies only to the current \nvisa application. Please be advised that Presidential Proclamation \n20 \n9645 currently restricts issuance of most visas to nationals of Iran \nand seven other countries. \n21 \n \n(Exhibit F) \n22 \n \n23  69.   This despite the facts that the Proclamation would not come into existence until long \n24  after her visa interview and, further, that once it came into effect, she was never given the \n25 \nCOMPLAINT - 16 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 1   Filed 03/13/18   Page 17 of 45\n \n1  opportunity to request a waiver of the Proclamation, nor was she informed of her right to be \n2  considered for a waiver. \n3 \n70.  Dr. Mahdi Afshar Arjmand is an Iranian national who filed for an EB-1A (alien with \n4 \nextraordinary ability) immigrant visa on December 27, 2016, and received an approval notice on \n5 \nJanuary 9, 2017. He attended his immigrant visa interview with his family on July 25, 2017 at \n6 \nthe U.S. Embassy in Yerevan, Armenia. The officer informed them that their case looked good, \n7 \nbut just needed to go through administrative processing. On January 12, 2018, the Embassy \n8 \nemailed  Dr.  Afshar  Arjmand  the  same  denial  letter  that  Mr.  Babalou  and  Ms.  Mehrabi \n9 \nMohammad Abadi received. The consulate never mentioned anything about a waiver process. \n10 \nDr. Afshar Arjmand had a job offer from the University of California, San Diego, to work as a \n11 \nresearcher and professor. The Embassy refused to consider Dr. Afshar Arjmand for a waiver \n12 \neven though the university had sent multiple emails to the Embassy requesting it to issue Dr. \n13 \nAfshar Arjmand's visa so he could start his position there. \n14 \n15  71.  Dr. Ehsan Heidaryan, a world-renowned professor of chemical engineering and Iranian \n16  national,  filed  a  petition  for  an  employment-based  first  preference  visa  for  aliens  with \n17  extraordinary  ability  (EB-1A)3 with  USCIS  on  February  7,  2017.  Based  on  his  impressive \n18 \nrecord of achievements in his field, USCIS approved Dr. Heidaryan’s petition on March 3, \n19 \n2017. He attended his immigrant visa interview at the U.S. Consulate General in Rio de Janeiro, \n20 \nBrazil, on December 23, 2017. Thereafter, the Consulate emailed Dr. Heidaryan to inform him \n21 \n                                                 \n \n22 \n3 To qualify for an EB-1A visa an applicant “must be able to demonstrate extraordinary ability \n23  in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics through sustained national or international \nacclaim.” USCIS, Employment-Based Immigration: First Preference EB-1, \n24  https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-\nimmigration-first-preference-eb-1 (accessed Jan. 21, 2018). \n25   \nCOMPLAINT - 17 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 1   Filed 03/13/18   Page 18 of 45\n \n1  that  since  he  is  an  Iranian  national,  his  immigrant  visa  must  be  refused  because  of  the \n2  Proclamation. Specifically, the consulate wrote: \n3 \nDear Sir, \n4 \nUnfortunately your immigrant visa is refused under Presidential \nProclamation 9645 and now considered closed. Do not need to fill \n5 \nout the questionnaire we sent by email. \n \n6 \n(Exhibit G) \n \n7 \n8  Not  only  did  the  Consulate  never  mention  anything  about  a  waiver  process  or  how  Dr. \n9  Heidaryan could prove his eligibility, but it affirmatively stopped him from even completing his \n10  visa application.  \n11 \n72.  Ms. Najmeh Maharlouei is an Iranian national currently residing in Shiraz, Iran, where \n12 \nshe is employed as a health researcher and Associate Professor of Community Medicine at \n13 \nShiraz University of Medical Sciences. She filed an application with USCIS for an immigrant \n14 \nvisa under the category of employment-based second preference (EB-2) with a National Interest \n15 \nWaiver4 on June 20, 2015. Her case was approved on March 4, 2016, and Ms. Maharlouei \n16 \nattended her immigrant visa interview at the U.S. Embassy in Yerevan, Armenia, on October 6, \n17 \n2016.  She was told at that interview that there were no problems with her case, but that she \n18 \nwould have to undergo routine administrative processing. Ms. Maharlouei received a notice \n19 \n20 \n                                                 \n \n21 \n4 An applicant can acquire permanent residency under the EB-2 category if she is a foreign \nnational who has an advanced degree and exceptional ability in the sciences, art, or business. \n22 \nUSCIS, Employment-Based Immigration: Second Preference EB-2, \n23  https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-\nimmigration-second-preference-eb-2 (accessed Jan. 21, 2018). This category usually requires \n24  that the applicant’s employer get a labor certification from the U.S. Department of Labor, but an \napplicant can receive a National Interest Waiver of that requirement if she shows that her work \n25  is in the U.S. national interest.  \nCOMPLAINT - 18 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 1   Filed 03/13/18   Page 19 of 45\n \n1  denying her visa application pursuant to the Proclamation on December 22, 2017. She at no \n2  point had the opportunity to request a waiver of the Proclamation despite the fact that the very \n3 \nreason her immigrant visa petition was approved by USCIS was a determination that her work is \n4 \nin the U.S. national interest. The Proclamation would not come into existence until more than a \n5 \nyear after Ms. Maharlouei’s interview.  \n6 \n73.  Plaintiff Nastaran Hajiheydari is an Iranian national currently residing in Iran where she \n7 \nworks  in  the  field  of  Information  Technology  Business  as  an  Associate  Professor  at  the \n8 \nUniversity of Tehran. She filed an application with USCIS for an immigrant visa under the \n9 \ncategory of employment-based second preference (EB-2) with a National Interest Waiver on \n10 \nOctober 14, 2016. Her case was approved less than 40 days later in November 2016, and Ms. \n11 \nHajiheydari and her family attended their immigrant visa interviews at the U.S. Embassy in \n12 \nYerevan, Armenia, on October 26, 2017. Their cases were placed in routine administrative \n13 \nprocessing. Ms. Hajiheydari received an email notice denying her family’s visa applications \n14 \n15  pursuant to the Proclamation on January 16, 2018. She at no point had the opportunity to request \n16  a waiver of the Proclamation despite the fact that the very reason her immigrant visa petition \n17  was approved by USCIS was a determination that her work is in the U.S. national interest.  \n18 \n74.  Plaintiff Afrooz Kharazmi, a U.S. citizen residing in Loveland, Ohio, filed an immigrant \n19 \nvisa petition with USCIS on June 1, 2004, for her sister, Plaintiff Afshan Alamshah Zadeh, an \n20 \nIranian national currently residing in Iran. Ms. Alamshah Zadeh waited in line for 12 years for \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nCOMPLAINT - 19 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 1   Filed 03/13/18   Page 20 of 45\n \n1  her priority date5 to become current. USCIS approved her petition in October 2016. The U.S. \n2  Embassy in Abu Dhabi, UAE, scheduled Ms. Alamshah Zadeh's immigrant visa interview for \n3 \nJanuary 7, 2018. She attended the interview and was informed that her immigrant visa was \n4 \ndenied pursuant to the Proclamation. Ms. Alamshah Zadeh did not have the opportunity to apply \n5 \nfor a waiver, thus the consular officer did not consider the fact that she has two U.S. citizen \n6 \nparents and a U.S. citizen sister with whom she seeks to be reunited, or the fact that she \n7 \npatiently waited in line for 12 years for her visa number to become current. \n8 \n75.  Plaintiff  Bamshad  Azizi  is  a  U.S.  lawful  permanent  resident  residing  in  San  Jose, \n9 \nCalifornia,  and  co-founder  of  a  cybersecurity  startup  in  the  United  States.  His  parents, \n10 \nRoghayeh Azizikoutenaei and Hojjatollah Azizikoutenaei applied for tourist visas to come visit \n11 \nhim and his sister. They attended their interview at the U.S. Consulate General in Dubai, UAE, \n12 \non September 12, 2017, 12 days before the signing of the Proclamation, and were told that their \n13 \nvisas would be ready in two weeks. In disbelief at their luck, Mr. and Mrs. Azizikoutenaei asked \n14 \n15  if their visas would really be ready in only two weeks, and the interviewing officer smiled and \n16  confirmed. On October 3, 2017, they received an email from the Embassy requesting that they \n17  send their passports so that their visas could be stamped. They did so and, to their dismay, their \n18 \npassports were returned eleven days later with no visas and with a letter stating that their \n19 \napplications had been placed in administrative processing. After following up multiple times \n20 \nwith  the  Embassy  and  receiving  only  automated  responses,  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Azizikoutenaei \n21 \n                                                 \n \n22 \n5 An applicant’s priority date is the date upon which her application was filed. An applicant’s \n23  priority date must become “current” before she can apply for an adjustment of status to that of \npermanent resident. Spouses, parents, and minor children of U.S. citizens do not have to wait for \n24  visas to become available, so their priority dates are irrelevant, but all other categories of \nimmigrants have to wait in line, in some cases for decades, for their priority dates to become \n25  current. \nCOMPLAINT - 20 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 1   Filed 03/13/18   Page 21 of 45\n \n1  received rejections on January 10, 2018. Mrs. Azizikoutenaei was diagnosed with cancer about \n2  a year ago and had to undergo two surgeries and a series of intense chemotherapy sessions. Mr. \n3 \nAzizikoutenaei also had surgery recently. They are both still quite weak and the family just \n4 \nwants to be reunited. They were unable to tell officers about their circumstances as they did not \n5 \nhave the opportunity to request a waiver from the Proclamation at any point. \n6 \n76.  Plaintiff Clyde Jean Tedrick II is an American citizen residing in Rockville, Maryland, \n7 \nwith Plaintiff Mitra Farnoodian-Tedrick, U.S. lawful permanent resident. They assisted Ms. \n8 \nFarnoodian-Tedrick’s parents, Farajollah Farnoudian and Farangis Emami, with applying for \n9 \ntourist visas to attend their wedding on May 27, 2018. Mr. Farnoudian and Ms. Emami had \n10 \nvisited the U.S. before and had fully complied with the terms of their tourist visas. They \n11 \nattended their visa interview on October 17, 2017, at the U.S. Consulate General in Dubai, \n12 \nUAE.  Mr.  Farnoudian’s  visa  application  was  placed  in  administrative  processing,  but  Ms. \n13 \nEmami’s visa application was approved. Mr. Farnoudian received an email on January 8, 2018, \n14 \n15  informing him that his visa had been denied pursuant to the Proclamation. Ms. Emami was \n16  never notified that her already-approved visa had been denied pursuant to the Proclamation, but \n17  only found out after checking the status of her case online. At no point did anyone in the family \n18 \nhave an opportunity to request a waiver. Due to the lack of opportunity to request a waiver, Mr. \n19 \nTedrick and Ms. Farnoodian-Tedrick were forced to cancel their wedding. \n20 \n77.  Plaintiff Tannaz Toloubeydokhti is a U.S. citizen who resides in San Diego, California. \n21 \nShe is employed as an obstetric-gynecologist and has dedicated her career to improving the lives \n22 \nof American mothers and babies. She is herself in her last trimester of pregnancy and, knowing \n23 \nhow difficult labor and caring for a newborn can be, she seeks family support for help both in \n24 \ndelivery  of  the  baby  and  with  childcare  afterwards.  Ms.  Toloubeydokhti  petitioned  for \n25 \nCOMPLAINT - 21 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 1   Filed 03/13/18   Page 22 of 45\n \n1  immigrant visas for her parents, Fathollah Tolou Beydokhti and Behnaz Malekghaeini, Iranian \n2  nationals, on September 1, 2016. Their cases were approved, and her parents attended their \n3 \nimmigrant visa interviews on December 21, 2017, at the U.S. Embassy in Yerevan, Armenia. \n4 \nMr. Beydokhti and Ms. Malekghaeini, went prepared to their interviews, ready to request \n5 \nwaivers of the Proclamation with supporting documents in hand. But when they presented their \n6 \ndocuments, the officer refused to review them, told them that they did not qualify for a waiver, \n7 \nand their visas were denied. \n8 \n78.  Plaintiff  Maral  Charkhtab  Tabrizi  is  a  U.S.  lawful  permanent  resident  residing  in \n9 \nArizona who is married to a U.S. citizen and is pregnant with her first child. Her parents, \n10 \nPlaintiffs Zahra Rouzbehani and Bahram Charkhtab Tabrizi, who have traveled to the United \n11 \nStates many times before, applied for tourist visas to witness the birth of their first grandchild. \n12 \nThey attended their interviews at the U.S. Consulate General in Dubai, UAE, on October 19, \n13 \n2017. Ms. Rouzbehani was approved right away, but Mr. Charkhtab Tabrizi’s case was sent for \n14 \n15  administrative processing. Ms. Rouzbehani decided to not send the passport for visa stamping \n16  immediately, but to wait for her husband’s administrative processing to be completed first so \n17  that they could travel together to the United States. Immediately after the Supreme Court \n18 \nallowed the Proclamation to go into effect, Ms. Rouzbehani sent her passport for visa stamping. \n19 \nNear the end of December 2017, the passport was returned without a visa and their visas were \n20 \nrefused pursuant to the Proclamation. They were not given the opportunity to apply for a waiver.  \n21 \n79.  Had they been given that opportunity, Ms. Charkhtab Tabrizi’s parents would have told \n22 \nthe adjudicating officer that they wanted to be there to support their daughter for a number of \n23 \nreasons. The first is financial. Ms. Charkhtab Tabrizi’s household finances depend heavily on \n24 \nher salary and, because she is a contractor for Google and has been there for less than 12 months \n25 \nCOMPLAINT - 22 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 1   Filed 03/13/18   Page 23 of 45\n \n1  and is therefore not eligible for maternity leave or for time off under the Family Medical Leave \n2  Act, she had planned to return to work as soon as possible. Without her parents, Ms. Charkhtab \n3 \nTabrizi will be unable to go back to work as quickly as she had hoped and will be unable to \n4 \nafford daycare after an unpaid leave during which time she and her husband will be depleting \n5 \ntheir savings. The second reason is medical. Ms. Charkhtab Tabrizi has a connective tissue \n6 \ndisorder which has caused her severe pain during her pregnancy and makes her daily activities \n7 \nvery difficult. She had hoped that her parents could be there to support her during her recovery \n8 \nso she could go back to work quickly; this is important because her contract may end before she \n9 \nhas fully recovered and she may lose all of her benefits and her opportunity to extend her \n10 \ncontract. The denial of Ms. Rouzbehani’s and Mr. Charkhtab Tabrizi’s visas is causing Ms. \n11 \nCharkhtab Tabrizi severe financial hardship and may even cost her her job.  \n12 \n80.  Plaintiff  Maryam  Mozafari  is  a  U.S.  permanent  resident  currently  residing  in  San \n13 \nFrancisco, California. She is pregnant and wanted her parents, Ms. Nahid Golestanian and Mr. \n14 \n15  Mohammad Mehdi Mozaffary, to come visit her and provide her the support she needs during \n16  this stressful time. They had both visited the United States in 2014, and had left the country well \n17  in advance of the expiration of their visas, and were thus confident they would be granted tourist \n18 \nvisas again. On December 28, 2016, they applied for tourist visas at the U.S. Consulate General \n19 \nin Dubai, UAE. Ms. Golestanian’s visa was granted immediately. Mr. Mozaffary was asked for \n20 \nhis mandatory military service documents. He did not have them with him, as the documents \n21 \nwere not mentioned in the list of required documents for the visa application, and he was asked \n22 \nto reapply and bring the documents with him to the next interview.  \n23 \n81.  Because of the timing of the first two travel bans, Mr. Mozaffary had to delay his \n24 \ninterview, and was not able to get back in to the Consulate until July 30, 2017. He was told by \n25 \nCOMPLAINT - 23 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 1   Filed 03/13/18   Page 24 of 45\n \n1  the consular officer that his documents appeared to be in order, but that he would be sending \n2  Mr. Mozaffary additional forms to fill out. Mr. Mozaffary received the forms in August and \n3 \nreturned them to the Consulate soon thereafter. For the next several months, Ms. Mozafari and \n4 \nMr. Mozaffary sent several emails to the Consulate to inquire about the status of the cases, but \n5 \neither received no reply at all or a system-generated standard response. On January 11, 2018, \n6 \nMr. Mozaffary’s visa was denied pursuant to the Proclamation. He did not have an opportunity \n7 \nto request a waiver. Mr. Mozaffary suffers from a heart condition which requires that he be \n8 \naccompanied at all times. During this time, Ms. Golestanian came to the United States to visit \n9 \nMs. Mozafari. She wants to stay with Ms. Mozafari to support her during her pregnancy, but she \n10 \nfeels torn between her daughter and her ailing husband. She has been put in an impossible \n11 \nposition. \n12 \n82.  Despite the fact that the Proclamation contains examples of specific circumstances under \n13 \nwhich issuance of a waiver to an applicant would be appropriate, Defendants have abrogated \n14 \n15  their duty to consider Plaintiffs’ individual circumstances—all of which fall cleanly under one \n16  or more of these examples—and have instead engaged in categorical refusals to consider waiver \n17  applications and, thus, categorical denials of visas to the individuals affected by the travel ban. \n18 \n \n19 \nIV.  President Trump’s ongoing promise to implement “a total and complete \nshutdown of Muslims entering the United States”  \n20 \n \n83.  Prior to his election, President Trump campaigned on the promise that he would ban \n21 \nMuslims from entering the United States. On December 7, 2015, then-candidate Trump issued a \n22 \n23  press release calling for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” \n24 \n25 \nCOMPLAINT - 24 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 1   Filed 03/13/18   Page 25 of 45\n \n1  Donald J. Trump Campaign, Donald J. Trump Statement on Preventing Muslim Immigration \n2  (Dec. 7, 2015). (Exhibit H) \n3 \n84.  When asked on the following day what the customs process would look like for a \n4 \nMuslim non-citizen attempting to enter the United States, candidate Trump stated, “[T]hey \n5 \nwould say, ‘are you Muslim?’” Nick Gass, Trump not bothered by comparisons to Hitler, \n6 \nPOLITICO  (Dec.  8,  2015),  https://www.politico.com/trump-muslims-shutdown-hitler-\n7 \ncomparison.  Candidate Trump then confirmed that, if they answered in the affirmative, they \n8 \nwould not be allowed into the country. Id.  \n9 \n85.  On June 13, 2016, candidate Trump reiterated his promise to ban all Muslims entering \n10 \nthis country until the United States is “in a position to properly and perfectly screen those \n11 \npeople coming into our country.” Ryan Teague Beckwith, Read Donald Trump’s Speech on the \n12 \nOrlando Shooting,  TIME  (Jun.  13,  2016),  http://time.com/4367120/orlando-shooting-donald-\n13 \ntrump- \n14 \n15  transcript/.  \n16  86.  In a foreign policy speech delivered on August 15, 2016, candidate Trump noted that the \n17  United States could not “adequate[ly] screen[]” immigrants because it admits “about 100,000 \n18 \npermanent immigrants from the Middle East every year.” Donald Trump Foreign Policy Speech \n19 \nin  Youngstown,  C-SPAN  (Aug.  15,  2016),  https://www.c-span.org/video/?413977-1/donald- \n20 \ntrump-delivers-foreign-policy-address (quoted remarks at 50:46). Candidate Trump proposed \n21 \ncreating an ideological screening test for immigration applicants, which would “screen out any \n22 \nwho have hostile attitudes towards our country or its principles – or who believe that Sharia law \n23 \nshould supplant American law.” He referred to this proposal as “extreme, extreme vetting.” Id.  \n24 \n25 \nCOMPLAINT - 25 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 1   Filed 03/13/18   Page 26 of 45\n \n1  87.  On June 5, 2017, after litigation against the first travel ban led to its replacement by a \n2  revised ban, President Trump issued a series of tweets criticizing the revision and calling for a \n3 \nreturn to the first travel ban. He stated, “The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original \n4 \nTravel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C.” (Exhibit I) \n5 \nPresident Trump also tweeted: “People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they \n6 \nwant, but I am calling it what we need and what it is a TRAVEL BAN!” (Exhibit J) \n7 \n88.  Defendants have pointed to the existence of a waivers provision in the Proclamation as \n8 \nproof of its constitutionality. But the president’s statements, both before and during his time in \n9 \noffice, combined with the blanket denials of waivers and visas to applicants from the banned \n10 \nMuslim-majority countries lay bare Defendants’ intent to institute a complete ban on Muslims \n11 \nentering the United States. \n12 \n \n13 \nV.  President Trump’s promise to end family reunification, a.k.a. chain migration \n14 \n15  89.  On January 4, 2018, President Trump tweeted, “…We must BUILD THE WALL, stop \n16  illegal immigration, end chain migration & cancel the visa lottery.” (Exhibit K) \n17  90.  On January 16, 2018, President Trump tweeted, “[W]e need to keep America safe, \n18 \nincluding moving away from a random chain migration and lottery system, to one that is merit-\n19 \nbased.” (Exhibit L) \n20 \n91.  On January 25, 2018, the White House issued a fact sheet entitled, “White House \n21 \nFramework  on  Immigration  Reform  &  Border  Security,”  where  it  stated  one  of  the \n22 \nadministration’s goal is to “[p]romote nuclear family migration by limiting family sponsorship \n23 \nto spouses and minor children only (for both Citizens and LPRs), ending extended-family chain \n24 \nmigration.” (Exhibit M) \n25 \nCOMPLAINT - 26 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 1   Filed 03/13/18   Page 27 of 45\n \n1  92.  Defendants have changed the terms of the travel ban that they themselves wrote by \n2  categorically limiting the number of visa applicants who can request consideration for a waiver \n3 \nof the travel ban. Defendants are therefore bypassing Congress and the INA and working to \n4 \neffectively end family reunification in the banned countries. \n5 \n \n6 \n \n7 \n \n8 \nVI.  Existing  guidance  from  the  State  Department  is  inadequate  to  guide  either \n9  consular officers or visa applicants with respect to the Proclamation’s waiver \nprocess \n10   \n93.  The guidance provided by the Proclamation itself is minimal, and the Proclamation \n11 \ndirects the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop specific \n12 \nguidance  for  consular  officers  and  visa  applicants  on  how  the  waivers  provision  will  be \n13 \nimplemented. 82 Fed. Reg. at 45168; see Washington v. Trump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1169 (9th Cir. \n14 \n15  2017) (“The Government … has offered no explanation for how these [discretionary waiver] \n16  provisions would function in practice: how would the \"national interest\" be determined, who \n17  would make that determination, and when?”). \n18 \n94.  After the Supreme Court’s lifting of the stays on the Proclamation, the State Department \n19 \nissued guidance regarding its immediate implementation on its website.

(Exhibit  N)  The \n22 \nguidance indicates that consular officers will review eligibility for a waiver at the time of an \n23 \napplicant’s interview.

But the State Department’s guidance does not offer definitions of key terms from the \n2  Proclamation’s  waivers  provision  like  “undue  hardship”  or  “significant  contacts”  or  any \n3 \nexplanation for how applicants can show that their entry into the United States would be in the \n4 \nnational interest.  \n5 \n96.  This lack of clarity leaves applicants guessing as to what the standards of eligibility are \n6 \nfor waivers—whether their hardships are undue, whether their contacts are significant—and \n7 \npresumably also leaves consular officers guessing as to which applicants are eligible. \n8 \n97.  The State Department’s guidance does provide a definition of “close family member,” \n9 \nand indicates that the definition for purposes of the Proclamation is the same as the definition \n10 \nfor  “immediate  relative”  that  can  be  found  elsewhere  in  immigration  law.  See  8  U.S.C.  \n11 \n§ 1151(b)(2)(A)(i).  \n12 \n98.  But according to an email received by counsel from the U.S. Consulate General in \n13 \nVancouver, Canada, visa applicants who seek to be reunited with a parent in the U.S. are \n14 \n15  ineligible for consideration of a waiver if they are over 21 years old, the opposite of the \n16  definition under the rest of immigration law. The email exchange reads in relevant part as \n17  follows: \n18 \nCOUNSEL: [I]t appears as though my client, [REDACTED], has \nbeen denied the opportunity to request a waiver of the presidential \n19 \nproclamation.  \n \n20 \nAccording to the presidential proclamation itself and guidance on \nthe  State  Department's  website,  foreign  nationals  who  seek  to \n21 \nenter the US to be reunited with a close family member (e.g. \nspouse, child, or parent) are eligible for requesting a waiver.  \n22 \n \n23  My client is the daughter of a United States citizen. Could you \nkindly  explain  why  your  office  has  denied  my  client  the \n24  opportunity to request a waiver of the presidential proclamation? \n \n25 \nCOMPLAINT - 28 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 1   Filed 03/13/18   Page 29 of 45\n \n1  CONSULATE: A consular officer may issue a visa based on a \nlisted waiver category to nationals of countries identified in the \n2  Presidential Proclamation on a case-by-case basis. \n \n3 \nIt has been determined that your client, [REDACTED], does not \nmeet the definition of close family as she is over 21 years of age. \n4 \n \nThis decision cannot be appealed. \n5 \n \n(Exhibit O) \n6 \n \n99.  Defendants  have  thus  limited  the  meaning  of  “close  family  member”  to  suit  their \n7 \n8  intended goal of broadly denying waivers to applicants from banned countries. \n9  100.  The guidance also does not explain how consular officers should consider the eligibility \n10  for a waiver of applicants, like several Plaintiffs, who were interviewed prior to implementation \n11 \nof  the  Proclamation  but  were  in  administrative  processing  during  the  periods  when  the \n12 \nProclamation was being implemented.  \n13 \n101.  Nor does the guidance explain how applicants stuck in administrative processing should \n14 \nhandle the situation. Applicants are thus at a loss for what to do—they do not know whether \n15 \nthey are supposed to contact the embassy or whether the embassy will contact them; whether \n16 \nthey should wait until administrative processing is completed or request a waiver while their \n17 \ncases  are  still  pending  administrative  processing.  Applicants  fear  that,  if  they  contact  the \n18 \nembassy, attention will be brought to their cases, which will result in an immediate denial due to \n19 \nthe Proclamation. This fear is not unfounded: counsel have personal knowledge of cases in \n20 \nwhich this occurred. \n21 \n102.  Visa applicants have stated that when they attend interviews at embassies and consulates \n22 \n23  abroad, the officers inform them that waivers are processed in Washington, D.C. This undercuts \n24  the State Department’s guidance which states that visa applicants’ eligibility for waivers will be \n25 \nCOMPLAINT - 29 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 1   Filed 03/13/18   Page 30 of 45\n \n1  determined by the consular officer at the time of the interview and further muddies the water. \n2  Applicants do not even know who is adjudicating their requests for waivers, much less what the \n3 \nstandards are to qualify for one. \n4 \n103.  In a letter to two U.S. senators published on March 6, 2018, the State Department issued \n5 \nmore  guidance  on  the  waiver  process.  (Exhibit  B)  This  guidance  contradicts  both  the \n6 \nProclamation and the State Department’s previous guidance on the process.  \n7 \n104.  For example, the letter states that “the applicant’s travel may be considered in the \n8 \nnational interest if the applicant demonstrates to the consular officer’s satisfaction that a U.S. \n9 \nperson  or  entity  would  suffer  hardship  if  the  applicant  could  not  travel  until  after  visa \n10 \nrestrictions  …  are  lifted.”  Id.  Neither  the  Proclamation  nor  the  guidance  from  the  State \n11 \nDepartment’s website ever make any mention of visa applicants being required to show that \n12 \nU.S. citizens or entities would suffer hardship if the applicant were not granted a visa, which \n13 \nbelies  the  State  Department’s  contention  that  “[t]he  Department’s  worldwide  guidance  to \n14 \n15  consular officers regarding waivers is drawn directly from the Proclamation.” Id.  \n16  105.  It is thus clear that Defendants are making things up as they go along, saying one thing \n17  on government websites, another thing to visa applicants and attorneys, and yet another thing \n18 \nwhen a U.S. senator is doing the inquiring.  \n19 \n \n20 \nVII.  Denial letters issued by consular officers reveal Defendants’ policy and practice \nof refusing to give applicants due consideration for waivers \n21 \n \n106.  Defendants provided the consulates and embassies abroad with a template letter to give \n22 \n23  to visa applicants when they have been denied a visa pursuant to the Proclamation. The letter \n24  has two options for a consular officer to select: (1) “Taking into account the provisions of the \n25 \nCOMPLAINT - 30 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 1   Filed 03/13/18   Page 31 of 45\n \n1  Proclamation, a waiver will not be granted in your case”; or (2) “The consular officer is \n2  reviewing your eligibility for a waiver under the Proclamation.” (Exhibit P)  \n3 \n107.  This begs the question: why are consular officers not considering all applicants for a \n4 \nwaiver? And on what basis does an officer decide in the first instance whether an applicant \n5 \nshould be considered for a waiver at all?  \n6 \n108.  These  form  letters  betray  Defendants’  policy  and  practice  of  judging  applicants’ \n7 \neligibility for waivers based not on their personal circumstances or on a consideration of the \n8 \nguidance provided by the Proclamation, but instead on applicants’ nationality and country of \n9 \norigin. \n10 \n109.  These form letters also contradict the guidance found on the State Department website. \n11 \nSee  Dep’t  of  State,  New  Court  Order  on  Presidential  Proclamation  (Dec.  4,  2017), \n12 \nhttps://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/News/visasnews/new_court_orders_on_presidential_pr\n13 \noclamation.html. That guidance tells officers that if they are faced with a visa applicant who is \n14 \n15  subject to the Proclamation, they will determine whether the applicant “may be eligible for a \n16  waiver under the Proclamation and therefore issued a visa.” The guidance goes on to state \n17  explicitly that, “[a] consular officer will carefully review each case to determine whether the \n18 \napplicant is affected by the Proclamation . . . and, if so, whether the applicant qualifies for an \n19 \nexception or a waiver.” Id.  \n20 \n110.  The fact that the form letters reveal that officers are not considering all applicants for \n21 \nwaivers, and that the letters are inconsistent with the guidance given by State Department which \n22 \nexplicitly tells officers to consider all applicants, shows that Defendants are making decisions \n23 \nbased on inappropriate considerations of country of origin and nationality and not on valid and \n24 \ngood faith considerations of applicants’ personal circumstances.  \n25 \nCOMPLAINT - 31 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 1   Filed 03/13/18   Page 32 of 45\n \n1   \n2  VIII.  Plaintiffs and proposed class members have suffered and continue to suffer \nirreparable harm because of the flawed waiver process \n3 \n \n111.  Defendants’ reckless and irresponsible implementation of the Proclamation, and their \n4 \npolicy and practice of refusing to consider in good faith the facts of individual cases, has caused \n5 \nsignificant and irreparable harm to Plaintiffs and proposed class members.  \n6 \n112.  Mr. Vazehrad has suffered a loss of consortium as he has been deprived and continues to \n7 \n8  be deprived of the opportunity to be with his fiancée, Ms. Motavaliabyazani. Both Plaintiffs are \n9  suffering ongoing severe emotional and mental distress as a result of their prolonged separation. \n10  Because the Proclamation made the travel ban of indeterminate length, the separation may well \n11 \nbe permanent. The couple have also paid thousands of dollars in attorney’s fees, filing fees, \n12 \ntravel costs, and medical fees, which they will never recoup.  \n13 \n113.  Mr. Babalou is at risk of losing a $500,000 investment in the United States. From his \n14 \nhome in Iran, he is unable to fulfill the duties assigned to him as part of running a business, \n15 \nunable to oversee the U.S. citizens he has employed, and therefore unable to effectively grow \n16 \nhis business and continue contributing to the U.S. economy. In addition to the large investment \n17 \nhe made into a U.S. business, Mr. Babalou has incurred substantial incidental costs over the last \n18 \nseven years, including $50,000 paid to a regional center for assistance with overseeing his \n19 \ninvestment  and  thousands  of  dollars  more  in  attorney’s  fees,  filing  fees,  travel  costs,  and \n20 \nmedical fees. These are costs that Mr. Babalou can never recoup.  \n21 \n114.  Ms. Mehrabi Mohammad Abadi is also at risk of losing a $500,000 investment in the \n22 \n23  United States. From her home in Iran, she is unable to fulfill the duties assigned to her as part of \n24  running a business, unable to oversee the U.S. citizens she has employed, and therefore unable \n25 \nCOMPLAINT - 32 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 1   Filed 03/13/18   Page 33 of 45\n \n1  to effectively grow her business and continue contributing to the U.S. economy. In addition to \n2  her large investment, Ms. Mehrabi Mohammad Abadi incurred substantial incidental costs, \n3 \nincluding $50,000 paid to a regional center for assistance with overseeing her investment and \n4 \nthousands of dollars more in attorney’s fees, filing fees, travel costs, and medical fees. These are \n5 \ncosts that Ms. Mehrabi Mohammad Abadi will never recover.  \n6 \n115.  Dr. Afshar Arjmand risks losing a once-in-a-lifetime research and teaching opportunity \n7 \nat  the  University  of  California,  San  Diego,  one  of  the  world's  leading  public  research \n8 \nuniversities.  This  despite  the  fact  that  Dr.  Afshar  Arjmand  was  deemed  by  USCIS  to  be \n9 \n“extraordinary”—and it would thus clearly be in the U.S. national interest to allow him to \n10 \nenter—and despite the university’s persistence and assistance in the matter borne of its desire to \n11 \nsecure Dr. Afshar Arjmand and his prodigious talent and expertise for its faculty. In addition to \n12 \nmissing out on this incredible opportunity, he has also paid thousands of dollars in attorney’s \n13 \nfees, filing fees, travel costs, and medical fees, which he will be unable to recoup. \n14 \n15  116.  Dr. Heidaryan risks losing the opportunity to use his hard-won skills and experience, \n16  deemed “extraordinary” by USCIS, to conduct research and teach in his area of expertise—\n17  chemical engineering—in America’s top tier universities. Relatedly, Dr. Heidaryan risks losing \n18 \nthe opportunity to take advantage of the substantial resources American universities have to \n19 \nmore effectively further his research and, thus, the opportunity to contribute his expertise to the \n20 \nUnited States. He has also paid thousands of dollars in attorney’s fees, filing fees, travel costs, \n21 \nand medical fees, which he cannot recover. \n22 \n117.  Ms. Maharlouei also risks losing the opportunity to conduct research in the United States \n23 \nin her field of medical sciences, despite the fact that USCIS already deemed her research to be \n24 \nin the U.S. national interest. Ms. Maharlouei risks losing the opportunity to take advantage of \n25 \nCOMPLAINT - 33 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 1   Filed 03/13/18   Page 34 of 45\n \n1  American universities’ substantial resources to more effectively further her research and, thus, \n2  the opportunity to contribute her substantial expertise to the United States. She has also paid \n3 \nthousands of dollars in attorney’s fees, filing fees, travel costs, and medical fees, which she will \n4 \nbe unable to recoup. \n5 \n118.  Ms. Hajiheydari risks losing the opportunity to conduct research in the United States, \n6 \ndespite the fact that USCIS already determined that her work is in the U.S. national interest. Ms. \n7 \nHajiheydari risks losing the opportunity to take advantage of American universities’ substantial \n8 \nresources to more effectively further her research and, thus, the opportunity to contribute her \n9 \nexpertise to the United States. She has also paid thousands of dollars in attorney’s fees, filing \n10 \nfees, travel costs, and medical fees, for herself and three family members, all of which she will \n11 \nbe unable to recoup. \n12 \n119.  Plaintiff Afrooz Kharazmi and Plaintiff Afshan Alamshah Zadeh waited in line for more \n13 \nthan 12 years for Ms. Alamshah Zadeh’s priority date to become current, enduring years of \n14 \n15  hardship, separation, and sacrifice. Ms. Alamshah Zadeh’s entire family are American citizens \n16  residing in the United States, and she is therefore at risk of permanently losing the ability to visit \n17  any member of her family and being left permanently alone in Iran. The sisters have also paid \n18 \nthousands of dollars in attorney’s fees, filing fees, travel costs, and medical fees, which they \n19 \ncannot recover. \n20 \n120.  Plaintiff Bamshad Azizi and his parents, Roghayeh and Hojjatollah Azizikoutenaei, have \n21 \nsuffered and are suffering significant emotional distress at their ongoing separation.  Mrs. \n22 \nAzizikoutenaei has been suffering from cancer for the last year and Mr. and Ms. Azizikoutenaei \n23 \nboth recently underwent surgeries. All the family wants is to be together, but, because the travel \n24 \nban is of an indeterminate length, and Mr. and Mrs. Azizikoutenaei are quite weak after their \n25 \nCOMPLAINT - 34 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 1   Filed 03/13/18   Page 35 of 45\n \n1  illnesses and surgeries, they are unsure that they will ever get to be reunited. This prospect is \n2  also causing Mr. Azizi and his parents ongoing and significant emotional distress. The family \n3 \nhave paid thousands of dollars in attorney’s fees, filing fees, and travel costs, which they will be \n4 \nunable to recoup.  \n5 \n121.  Plaintiff Clyde Jean Tedrick II and Plaintiff Mitra Farnoodian-Tedrick cancelled their \n6 \nwedding and lost $3,976.76 because of Defendants’ denial of Plaintiff Farajollah Farnoudian \n7 \nand Plaintiff Farangis Emami’s case. They have all suffered considerable stress in connection \n8 \nwith the wedding and have lost, perhaps permanently, an experience that everyone should get to \n9 \nenjoy: celebrating a wedding with one’s parents. They have also paid thousands of dollars in \n10 \nattorney’s fees, filing fees, and travel costs, which they cannot recoup.  \n11 \n122.  Plaintiff Tannaz Toloubeydokhti has suffered significant emotional distress as she has \n12 \nbeen deprived of the opportunity to have her parents, Mr. Fathollah Tolou Beydokhti and Ms. \n13 \nBehnaz Malekghaeini present during her pregnancy. They are also at risk of missing the birth of \n14 \n15  Ms. Toloubeydokhti’s child. These experiences are ones none of them can ever get back and this \n16  loss is irreparable. Ms. Toloubeydokhti is also at risk of enduring a significant financial burden, \n17  as she had hoped that her parents would assist her with childcare for her newborn. She may have \n18 \nto seek hired help, an expensive prospect. Ms. Toloubeydokhti and her parents have also paid \n19 \nthousands of dollars in attorney’s fees, filing fees, and travel costs, which they will be unable to \n20 \nrecoup.  \n21 \n123.  Plaintiff Maral Charkhtab Tabrizi has suffered significant emotional distress as she was \n22 \ndeprived  of  the  opportunity  to  have  her  parents,  Plaintiffs  Zahra  Rouzbehani  and  Bahram \n23 \nCharkhtab Tabrizi, present during her pregnancy. She also suffered increased physical pain and \n24 \nsuffering, as she has a connective tissue disorder with associated pain that would have been \n25 \nCOMPLAINT - 35 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 1   Filed 03/13/18   Page 36 of 45\n \n1  lessened with the assistance of her parents. Additionally, Ms. Rouzbehani and Mr. Charkhtab \n2  Tabrizi missed the birth of their first grandchild. This is an experience none of them can never \n3 \nget back and their loss is therefore irreparable. Ms. Charkhtab Tabrizi is also at risk of enduring \n4 \na significant financial burden, as she had hoped that her parents would assist her with childcare \n5 \nfor her newborn. Because Ms. Charkhtab Tabrizi cannot take paid time off, without her parents’ \n6 \nassistance, she will have to increase the amount of time she takes off, thereby losing far more \n7 \nmoney  than  she  would  have  had  her  parents  been  present.  Her  unpaid  leave,  potentially \n8 \nextended due to Ms. Rouzbehani and Mr. Charkhtab Tabrizi’s absence, may also result in the \n9 \ncancellation of her job contract and the loss of her medical benefits, harms that would be \n10 \nirreparable. Ms. Charkhtab Tabrizi and her parents have also paid thousands of dollars in \n11 \nattorney’s fees, filing fees, and travel costs, which they will be unable to recoup.  \n12 \n124.  Applicants are told in their denial letters they can apply for visas again. But Defendants \n13 \nhave no protocols in place and, despite having more than five months to do so, have issued no \n14 \n15  guidance to officers or applicants. Thus, applicants will have to pay application fees, buy plane \n16  tickets, make hotel reservations, and pay, again, all of the costs associated with applying for a \n17  visa and traveling to a U.S. embassy to attend yet another interview with no hope of achieving a \n18 \ndifferent result. \n19 \n125.  As a result, Plaintiffs’ rights continue to be violated and they continue to be separated \n20 \nfrom  their  families,  jobs,  research,  and  investments  on  the  basis  of  the  unlawful  and \n21 \nunconstitutional waiver process. \n22 \n \n23 \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n24 \n25 \nCOMPLAINT - 36 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 1   Filed 03/13/18   Page 37 of 45\n \n1  126.  Individual Plaintiffs bring this action as a class action pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil \n2  Procedure 23(b)(1) and (b)(2), on behalf of themselves and all other persons similarly situated. \n3 \nA class action is proper because the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is \n4 \nimpractical, this action involves questions of law and fact common to the class, Plaintiffs’ \n5 \nclaims are typical of the claims of the class, Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the \n6 \ninterests of the class, and Defendants have acted on grounds that apply generally to the class, so \n7 \nthat final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate with respect to the \n8 \nclass as a whole. \n9 \n127.   In addition to the named plaintiffs, there are many other similarly situated individuals \n10 \nwho have been denied waivers and visas pursuant to the Proclamation. Each of these similarly \n11 \nsituated individuals is entitled to bring a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief to \n12 \nprohibit Defendants’ policy, pattern, and practice of denying waivers and visas to applicants \n13 \nfrom banned countries without a good faith consideration of their applications. \n14 \n15  128.  The proposed class is defined as follows: \n16  All petitioners and beneficiaries of immigrant or nonimmigrant \nvisa petitions that were refused or will be refused pursuant to the \n17  Proclamation without the opportunity to request a waiver of the \nProclamation  or  that  were  refused  or  will  be  refused  despite \n18 \nclearly falling under the examples provided by the Proclamation \nfor circumstances under which a waiver may be appropriate. All \n19 \nindividuals who were or will be considered for a waiver of the \nProclamation and refused a waiver due to Defendants’ narrow and \n20 \nincorrect definition of a “close family member.”  \n \n21 \n129.  The proposed class meets the requirements of Rule 23(a)(1) because it is so numerous \n22 \nthat joinder of all members is impracticable. The number of individuals who have been wrongly \n23 \ndenied  waivers  is  not  known  with  precision  by  Plaintiffs  but  is  easily  ascertainable  by \n24 \nDefendants. On any given day, thousands of visa applications are adjudicated at embassies and \n25 \nCOMPLAINT - 37 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 1   Filed 03/13/18   Page 38 of 45\n \n1  consulates abroad. As such, more individuals will become class members in the future, as \n2  Defendants continue to deny applicants a good faith opportunity to request a waiver of the \n3 \nProclamation. The members of the class are ascertainable and identifiable by Defendants. \n4 \n130.  The proposed class meets the commonality requirements of Rule 23(a)(2) because all \n5 \nproposed class members have been or will be subject to Defendants’ common policy, pattern, \n6 \nand practice of refusing to consider applicants for waivers of the Proclamation. Plaintiffs and the \n7 \nproposed class share the same legal claims, which include, but are not limited to: whether \n8 \nDefendants’ refusal to consider applicants for waivers in good faith and failure to develop \n9 \nstandards or guidance for consular officers and visa applicants to follow violate the APA, the \n10 \nINA, and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  \n11 \n131.  Similarly, the proposed class meets the typicality requirements of Rule 23(a)(3) because \n12 \nthe claims of the representative Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the class as a whole. \n13 \nPlaintiffs, as with the class they seek to represent, are all individuals who have been or will be \n14 \n15  denied the chance to request a waiver of the Proclamation and who have been or will be stymied \n16  in their attempts to apply by a dearth of guidance from Defendants.  \n17  132.  The adequacy requirements of Rule 23(a)(4) are also met. Plaintiffs know of no conflict \n18 \nbetween their interests and those of the proposed class. Plaintiff seek the same relief as other \n19 \nmembers of the class, namely that the Court (a) order Defendants to immediately cease their \n20 \nunlawful policy and/or practice of refusing to receive or consider requests for waivers of the \n21 \nProclamation; (b) retract visa denials due to the arbitrary and capricious nature of Defendants’ \n22 \ndecision to implement the ban without appropriate guidance in place; (c) provide clear guidance \n23 \nthat defines key words and sets clear standards for consular officers and applicants to use; and \n24 \n(d) abide by the terms of the Proclamation and consider case-by-case waivers in good faith. In \n25 \nCOMPLAINT - 38 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 1   Filed 03/13/18   Page 39 of 45\n \n1  defending their own rights, the individual Plaintiffs will defend the rights of all class members \n2  fairly and adequately. Plaintiffs are represented by counsel with deep knowledge of immigration \n3 \nlaw and extensive experience litigating class actions and complex cases. Counsel have the \n4 \nrequisite level of expertise to adequately prosecute this case on behalf of Plaintiffs and the \n5 \nproposed class. \n6 \n133.  The proposed class satisfies Rule 23(b)(2) because Defendants have acted on grounds \n7 \ngenerally applicable to the class in refusing to fairly adjudicate waiver requests. Thus, final \n8 \ninjunctive and declaratory relief is appropriate with respect to the class as a whole.  \n9 \n \n10 \n \n11 \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n12 \nCOUNT ONE \n13 \n(Violation of Administrative Procedure Act)  \n14 \n134.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in the \n15 \npreceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n16 \n135.  The APA prohibits federal agency action that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \n17 \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,” or is conducted “without observance of \n18 \nprocedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n19 \n136.  The  INA  prohibits  discrimination  in  the  issuance  of  immigrant  visas  based  on \n20 \nnationality,  place  of  birth,  or  place  of  residence.  8  U.S.C.  §  1152(a)(1)(A).  The  INA’s \n21 \n22  implementing regulations specify the procedures for issuance or denial of a visa. 22 C.F.R. \n23  42.81; 22 CFR 41.121; 22 C.F.R. § 40.6. Under these regulations, a denial must be based on \n24  legal grounds and made in conformance with the INA.  \n25 \nCOMPLAINT - 39 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 1   Filed 03/13/18   Page 40 of 45\n \n1  137.  In denying waivers and visas to Plaintiffs and proposed class members based on their \n2  country of origin or nationality, Defendants have acted arbitrarily, capriciously, and not in \n3 \naccordance with the INA.  \n4 \n138.  Defendants’  actions  have  resulted  in  the  indefinite—and  possibly  permanent—\n5 \nseparation of U.S. citizens and U.S. lawful permanent residents from their family members in \n6 \ncontravention of Congress’ purpose in enacting the INA: promoting family reunification. This \n7 \nconduct is not in accordance with the INA. \n8 \n139.  Defendants have discriminated against Plaintiffs and proposed class members based on \n9 \nthe proscribed grounds in implementing the Proclamation’s waivers provisions. In this respect, \n10 \nthey have failed to use the discretion granted them by law. They are therefore in violation of the \n11 \nAPA. \n12 \n140.  Defendants have a non-discretionary duty under the Proclamation to develop standards \n13 \nto guide visa applicants in compiling their applications for waivers and for consular officers to \n14 \n15  reference in adjudicating waiver and visa applications. See 82 Fed. Reg. at 45168. Defendants \n16  have failed to promulgate such guidance and have nonetheless proceeded in denying waivers \n17  and visas. Defendants have also failed to follow existing procedures prescribed by the INA and \n18 \nimplementing regulations and the Foreign Affairs Manual in issuing these denials. In failing to \n19 \ndevelop or follow any procedures, instead basing their decisions on applicants’ country of origin \n20 \nor  nationality,  Defendants  have  conducted  themselves  arbitrarily  and  capriciously  and  in \n21 \ncontravention of the Proclamation, the INA, and the U.S. Constitution, and they have thus \n22 \nviolated the APA.   \n23 \n24 \n25 \nCOMPLAINT - 40 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 1   Filed 03/13/18   Page 41 of 45\n \n1  141.  Defendants’ violations of these laws have harmed and continue to harm Plaintiffs and \n2  proposed class members by indefinitely denying them access to their families and to economic \n3 \nand research opportunities. \n4 \n \n5 \nCOUNT TWO \n(Violation of Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment) \n6 \n142.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in the \n7 \n8  preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n9  143.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects all \n10  individuals from the government denying equal protection of the law. \n11 \n144.  The blanket denials of visas to applicants from banned countries without the opportunity \n12 \nto argue for a waiver from the Proclamation, together with statements made by Defendants \n13 \nconcerning their intent and the application of the travel ban, makes clear that Defendants are \n14 \ntargeting individuals for discriminatory treatment based on their country of origin or nationality, \n15 \nwithout any lawful justification.  \n16 \n145.  Defendants’  implementation  of  the  waivers  provision  has  a  disparate  impact  on \n17 \napplicants from certain countries and of certain nationalities.  \n18 \n146.  Defendants’  discriminatory  implementation  of  the  waivers  provisions  serves  no \n19 \ncompelling government interest and is not narrowly tailored.  \n20 \n147.  Defendants’ conduct violates the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection.  \n21 \n148.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment also prohibits the federal government \n22 \n23  from  depriving  individuals  of  their  fundamental  rights  without  due  process  of  law,  i.e., \n24  substantive due process.  \n25 \nCOMPLAINT - 41 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 1   Filed 03/13/18   Page 42 of 45\n \n1  149.  Plaintiffs’ fundamental rights include their right to the \"integrity of the family unit.\" \n2  Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 651 (1972).  \n3 \n150.  The  implementation  of  the  waiver  provision  of  the  Proclamation  directly  and \n4 \nsubstantially infringes on Plaintiffs’ fundamental rights. \n5 \n151.  The Due Process Clause forbids Defendants from infringing on Plaintiffs’ fundamental \n6 \nrights unless the infringement is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest.  \n7 \n152.  As  applied,  the  Proclamation’s  waivers  provision  fails  this  test.  It  is  not  narrowly \n8 \ntailored to protect national security interests—it operates to block nearly all persons from \n9 \nbanned countries from entry into the United States, regardless of their relationship to violence or \n10 \nterrorism. It is both under- and over-inclusive. \n11 \n153.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment guarantees procedural due process \n12 \nrights, e.g., the right to fair and impartial processes, even to foreign nationals. Those due process \n13 \nrights are implicated by the deprivation of a fundamental liberty interest, e.g., family integrity, \n14 \n15  and they may also arise from statute. See Lanza v. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d 917, 927 (9th Cir. 2004) \n16  (“The due process afforded aliens stems from those statutory rights granted by Congress and the \n17  principle  that  ‘minimum  due  process  rights  attach  to  statutory  rights.’”)  (quoting  Dia  v. \n18 \nAshcroft, 353 F.3d 228, 239 (3d Cir. 2003). The INA and its implementing regulations mandate \n19 \nvarious procedures for the processing of visas, procedures which Defendants have failed to \n20 \nfollow.  \n21 \n154.  In refusing to consider Plaintiffs’ applications in good faith, Defendants have violated \n22 \nPlaintiffs’ Fifth Amendment right to equal protection under the law and to substantive and \n23 \nprocedural due process.   \n24 \n25 \nCOMPLAINT - 42 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 1   Filed 03/13/18   Page 43 of 45\n \n1  155.  Defendants’ violations of these laws have harmed and continue to harm Plaintiffs and \n2  proposed class members by indefinitely denying them access to their families and economic and \n3 \nresearch opportunities. \n4 \n \n5 \nCOUNT THREE \n6  (Writ of Mandamus) \n \n7  156.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in the \n8  preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n9  157.  Defendants owe Plaintiffs and class members a duty to adjudicate in good faith their \n10 \nrequests for waivers of the Proclamation. The adjudication of waivers and development of \n11 \nguidance on such adjudication are clear, non-discretionary duties imposed upon Defendants by \n12 \nthe INA and implementing regulations and by section 3 of the Proclamation.  \n13 \n158.  Defendants are unlawfully ignoring Plaintiffs’ requests for waivers of the Proclamation \n14 \nand have failed to carry out the adjudicative and administrative functions delegated to them by \n15 \nlaw with regard to Plaintiffs’ cases.  \n16 \n159.  Defendants’ refusal to consider applicants’ eligibility for waivers on a case-by-case basis \n17 \nor  develop  meaningful  guidance  is,  as  a  matter  of  law,  arbitrary,  capricious,  and  not  in \n18 \naccordance with the law and is thus violative of the APA. \n19 \n160.  Defendants’ policy and practice of denying visa applications and waivers to people of a \n20 \ncertain country of origin or nationality violates Plaintiffs’ right against discrimination under the \n21 \n22  INA and implementing regulations. \n23  161.  Defendants’ discriminatory behavior in issuing blanket denials to visa applicants from \n24  banned countries without consideration of their personal circumstances violates Plaintiffs’ Fifth \n25 \nCOMPLAINT - 43 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 1   Filed 03/13/18   Page 44 of 45\n \n1  Amendment  rights  to  equal  protection  under  the  law  and  substantive  and  procedural  due \n2  process. \n3 \n162.  Because  there  are  no  other  adequate  remedies  available  to  Plaintiffs,  mandamus  is \n4 \nappropriate. See 5 U.S.C. § 704. \n5 \n163.  Defendants’ violation of the law in denying Plaintiffs the opportunity to present waiver \n6 \napplications as a matter of course, and thereby refusing to consider waivers on a case-by-case \n7 \nbasis, is substantially unjustified. Plaintiffs are, therefore, entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees \n8 \nunder the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2412.  \n9 \n \n10 \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n11 \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for the following relief: \n12 \n1.  A temporary restraining order and/or preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining \n13 \nDefendants from denying visa applications due to the Proclamation; \n14 \n15  2.  An  order  requiring  Defendants  to  immediately  retract  all  visa  denials  due  to  the \n16  Proclamation and notify applicants that they may apply for a waiver of the Proclamation \n17  without submitting a new visa application, paying associated fees, and attending another \n18 \ninterview; \n19 \n3.  An order requiring Defendants to fulfill their duties by providing clear and consistent \n20 \nguidelines for the waiver process, including definitions of key terms, standards for \n21 \napplicants to meet, and examples of documents needed to meet those standards;  \n22 \n4.  An order requiring Defendants to abide by the terms of the Proclamation and consider \n23 \napplicants’ waiver applications on a case-by-case basis without discriminating based on \n24 \napplicants’ country of origin or nationality; \n25 \nCOMPLAINT - 44 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-01587-JD   Document 1   Filed 03/13/18   Page 45 of 45\n \n1  5.

An order awarding Plaintiffs costs of suit and reasonable attorney’s fees under the Equal \n4 \nAccess to Justice Act and any other applicable law; \n5 \n7.

No. 42 \nKIRSTJEN NIELSEN, et al., \n10 \nDefendants. \n11 \n   \n12   \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  This case is a putative class action brought by thirty-six named plaintiffs against the United \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  States Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State, the agencies for Customs and \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Border Protection and Citizenship and Immigration Services, and their senior leaders.  Dkt. No. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  34.  Plaintiffs challenge the government’s conduct in connection with a waiver program that \nS d nr\nee 17  would permit the entry into the United States of foreign nationals banned by Presidential \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Proclamation 9645.  This order resolves defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ complaint, \n19  which was brought under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Dkt. No. 42. \n20  BACKGROUND \n21  I.  THE LEGAL CONTEXT \n22  The complaint arises out of Presidential Proclamation 9645, “Enhancing Vetting \n23  Capabilities and Processes for Detecting Attempted Entry Into the United States by Terrorists or \n24  Other Public-Safety Threats,” which President Trump signed on September 24, 2017.  82 Fed. \n25  Reg. 45161 (2017) (the “Proclamation”).  The President states that he issued the Proclamation \n26  after ordering a “worldwide review of whether, and if so what, additional information would be \n27  needed from each foreign country to assess adequately whether their nationals seeking to enter the \n28  United States pose a security or safety threat.”  82 Fed. Reg. at 45161.  The Secretary of \n\n \n1  Homeland Security concluded from the review that “a small number of countries . . . remain \n2  deficient . . . with respect to their identity-management and information-sharing capabilities, \n3  protocols, and practices.”  Id.  To advance the “policy of the United States to take all necessary \n4  and appropriate steps to encourage foreign governments to improve their information-sharing and \n5  identity-management protocols and practices,” the President ordered a sharp curtailment, and in \n6  some cases a complete suspension, of entry into the United States by nationals of eight countries:  \n7  Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, Yemen and Somalia.  Id. at 45162, 45165-67.   \n8  The complaint focuses on Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.  Dkt. No. 34 ¶ 4.1  For \n9  Iranian nationals, the President limited entry into the United States to holders of visas for students \n10  (F and M) or exchange visitors (J), and no others.  82 Fed. Reg. at 45165.  For Libyan nationals, \n11  the President suspended all immigrant entry, and nonimmigrant entry on business (B-1), tourist \n12  (B-2) and business/tourist (B-1/B-2) visas.  Id. at 45166.  For Somali nationals, the President \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  suspended all entry into the United States as immigrants, and required “additional scrutiny” of \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  nonimmigrant entry for ties to terrorist organizations or other threats to the United States.  Id. at \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  45167.  For nationals of Syria, entry as immigrants and nonimmigrants was suspended in toto.  Id. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  at 45166.  For Yemeni nationals, entry as immigrants was suspended, as well as entry as \nS d nr\nee 17  nonimmigrants on business (B-1), tourist (B-2) and business/tourist (B-1/B-2) visas.  Id. at 45167. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  The President also ordered the waiver program that is at the center of this dispute.  As \n19  Section 3(c) of the Proclamation provides, “a consular officer, or the Commissioner, United States \n20  Customs and Border Protection (CBP), or the Commissioner’s designee, as appropriate, may, in \n21  their discretion, grant waivers on a case-by-case basis . . . .”  82 Fed. Reg. at 45168.  “A waiver \n22  may be granted only if a foreign national demonstrates to the consular officer’s or CBP official’s \n23  satisfaction that:  (A) denying entry would cause the foreign national undue hardship; (B) entry \n24  would not pose a threat to the national security or public safety of the United States; and (C) entry \n25  would be in the national interest.”  Id. (Sec. 3(c)(i)).  \n26 \n27 \n                                                 \n1 The restrictions on nationals of Chad have been lifted.  Presidential Proclamation No. 9723, 83 \n28 \nFed. Reg 15937 (Apr. 10, 2018).   \n2 \n\n \n1  The President directed the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to \n2  “coordinate to adopt guidance addressing the circumstances in which waivers may be appropriate \n3  for foreign nationals seeking entry as immigrants or nonimmigrants.”  Id. (Sec. 3(c)).  The \n4  Proclamation left the format of the guidance up to the agencies, but provided examples of \n5  circumstances when a waiver would be appropriate.  These situations included a foreign national \n6  who “seeks to enter the United States to visit or reside with a close family member (e.g., a spouse, \n7  child, or parent) who is a United States citizen, lawful permanent resident, or alien lawfully \n8  admitted on a valid nonimmigrant visa,” and for whom “the denial of entry would cause . . . undue \n9  hardship.”  Id. at 45169 (Sec. 3(iv)(D)).  They also included a “foreign national [who] seeks to \n10  enter the United States for significant business or professional obligations and the denial of entry \n11  would impair those obligations.”  Id. (Sec. 3(iv)(C)).   \n12  A lawsuit brought in this circuit challenged the legality of the Proclamation, but the United \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  States Supreme Court upheld it as a proper exercise of the President’s discretion to suspend the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  entry of aliens into the United States under Section 1182(f) of the Immigration and Nationality \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Act.  Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S.Ct. 2392, 2408 (2018).  The plaintiffs had sought to enjoin the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Proclamation on the grounds, among others, that it was issued “for the unconstitutional purpose of \nS d nr\nee 17  excluding Muslims” in violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  Id. at 2415.  \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  The Supreme Court concluded that the plaintiffs were not likely to succeed on the merits.  The \n19  Court applied a rational basis review to find that “the entry policy is plausibly related to the \n20  Government’s stated objective to protect the country and improve vetting processes.”  Id. at 2420-\n21  23.  The Court also assumed without deciding that the plaintiffs’ statutory claims could be heard \n22  notwithstanding the doctrine of consular nonreviewability.  Id. at 2407.   \n23  The allowance for waivers in the Proclamation was an important reason why the five-\n24  justice majority upheld it as serving a legitimate national security interest.  The majority cited the \n25  waiver program as one of “three additional features” of the President’s policy -- along with the \n26  subsequent removal of restrictions on three “Muslim-majority” countries and an allowance for \n27  “significant exceptions” for nonimmigrant entry -- that effectively dispelled concerns of religious \n28  animus or discrimination in the Proclamation.  Id. at 2422.  The majority put substantial emphasis \n3 \n\n \n1  on the fact that DHS and the State Department were directed to “issue guidance elaborating upon \n2  the circumstances that would justify a waiver,” in the apparent expectation that this would \n3  establish a program similar to the “humanitarian exceptions” implemented by President Carter \n4  during the Iran hostage crisis.  Id.   \n5  The four dissenting justices took a different view.  Most relevant here is Justice Breyer’s \n6  attention to the majority’s observations about the waiver program.  He suggested that, while the \n7  words might be reassuring, the incipient evidence available to the Court indicated that waivers \n8  were not being granted in practice.  At the least, this evidence raised a serious question about \n9  whether the program was mere “window dressing.”  Id. at 2432-33.  This matters because, if the \n10  government was not in fact actually administering the waiver program, “its argument for the \n11  Proclamation’s lawfulness becomes significantly weaker.”  Id. at 2430.   \na  12  II.  THE FACTUAL CONTEXT \ntr in\nuoro 13  That is the main legal context of the complaint.  The factual circumstances are provided by \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  a number of State Department statements about the Proclamation and the waiver program that are \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  attached to the complaint and incorporated by reference, and so are properly considered for the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  motion to dismiss.  To start, on December 4, 2017, the Department posted on its website an \nS d nr\nee 17  informational statement about the Proclamation that included some “Frequently Asked Questions” \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  and the answers to those questions.  The post included these statements:  “In accordance with the \n19  Presidential Proclamation, for nationals of the eight designated countries, a consular officer will \n20  make a determination whether an applicant . . . may be eligible for a waiver under the \n21  Proclamation and therefore issued a visa.”  Dkt. No. 34-4 (Ex. C) at ECF p. 4.  “As specified in \n22  the Proclamation, consular officers may issue a visa based on a listed waiver category to nationals \n23  of countries identified in the PP on a case-by-case basis, when they determine:  that issuance is in \n24  the national interest, the applicant poses no national security or public safety threat to the United \n25  States, and denial of the visa would cause undue hardship.  There is no separate application for a \n26  waiver.  An individual who seeks to travel to the United States should apply for a visa and disclose \n27  during the visa interview any information that might demonstrate that he or she is eligible for a \n28  waiver.”  Id. at ECF p. 6.   \n4 \n\n \n1  On April 10, 2018, the Department posted to its website about “Revisions to Presidential \n2  Proclamation 9645.”  Dkt. No. 34-7 (Ex. F).  It explained that “[t]he new P.P. removes the visa \n3  restrictions imposed on nationals of Chad by the earlier P.P.”  Id. at ECF p. 2.  The new statement \n4  once again affirmed that “[a]s specified in the Proclamation, consular officers may issue a visa \n5  based on a listed waiver category to nationals of countries identified in the PP on a case-by-case \n6  basis, when they determine” the waiver factors are satisfied.  Id. at ECF pp. 4-5.  The revised \n7  statement’s “Frequently Asked Questions” section also said that “[a]n individual who wishes to \n8  apply for an immigrant visa should apply for a visa and disclose during the visa interview any \n9  information that might demonstrate that he or she is eligible for an exception or waiver per the \n10  Proclamation.  A consular officer will carefully review each case to determine whether the \n11  applicant is affected by the Proclamation and, if so, whether the case qualifies for an exception or \n12  a waiver.”  Id. at ECF p. 6.   \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Another “frequently asked” question posed this inquiry:  “I’ve heard that the Department \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  of State does not grant waivers of the Proclamation.  Is this correct?”  The State Department \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  answered, \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  This information is incorrect.  As specified in the Proclamation, \nS d nr consular officers may issue a visa to nationals of countries covered \nee 17  by the Proclamation with a waiver on a case-by-case basis, when \nth\nintr they determine:  that issuance is in the national interest, the \nUo\nN 18  applicant poses no national security or public safety threat to the \nUnited States, and denial of the visa would cause undue hardship.  \n19  There is no separate application for a waiver.  An individual who \nseeks to travel to the United States should apply for a visa and \n20  disclose during the visa interview any information that might \ndemonstrate that he or she is eligible for a waiver.  From \n21  December 8, 2017 through April 1, 2018, more than 430 applicants \nwere cleared for waivers after a consular officer determined the \n22  applicants satisfied all criteria and completed all required \nprocessing.  Many of those applicants already have received their \n23  visas. \n24  Id. at ECF p. 7. \n25  In addition to these comments that the State Department published on the internet, the \n26  complaint attached two letters from Mary K. Waters, Assistant Secretary of Legislative Affairs at \n27  the Department of State, to United States Senator Chris Van Hollen.  The first, dated February 22, \n28  2018, referred expressly to Section 3(c) of the Proclamation, and stated, “[t]he entry restrictions of \n5 \n\n \n1  the Proclamation may be waived if a consular officer determines that the applicant meets each of \n2  the following three criteria: (1) denying entry would cause the foreign national undue hardship; \n3  (2) entry would not pose a threat to the national security or public safety of the United States; and \n4  (3) entry would be in the national interest.”  Dkt. No. 34-6 (Ex. E) at ECF p. 2.  The letter added, \n5  “[c]onsular officers may grant waivers on a case-by-case basis when the applicant demonstrates to \n6  the officer’s satisfaction that he or she meets the three criteria discussed above.”  Id. at ECF p. 3.  \n7  After addressing each criteria more specifically, Ms. Waters stated, “If the consular officer \n8  determines, after consultation with the Visa Office, that an applicant does not pose a threat to \n9  national security or public safety and the other two requirements have been met, a visa may be \n10  issued with the concurrence of a consular manager.”  Id.  The letter also said that “Section 3(c)(iv) \n11  of the Proclamation provides examples of the circumstances in which a waiver might be \n12  appropriate.  The Department’s worldwide guidance to consular officers regarding waivers is \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  drawn directly from the Proclamation.  Further, consular officers may consult with the Visa Office \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  if a consular officer believes a case may warrant a waiver but the applicant’s circumstances do not \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  align with one of the examples in the Proclamation.”  Id.  Ms. Waters attached a chart to the letter \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  which showed that a total of 2 waivers had been approved as of February 15, 2018, out of 8,406 \nS d nr\nee 17  applications for nonimmigrant and immigrant visas that had been received and processed from \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  nationals subject to Proclamation 9645 between December 8, 2017, to January 8, 2018.  Id. at ECF \n19  p. 5.  The Court’s math indicates that this amounts to an approval rate of 0.02%.2   \n20  Ms. Waters sent a second letter to Senator Van Hollen six months later, on June 22, 2018.  \n21  That letter confirmed that, “[a]s discussed in our February 22 letter, the Department’s worldwide \n22  guidance to consular officers regarding when a waiver pursuant to section 3(c) of PP 9645 may be \n23  granted is drawn directly from PP 9645 itself.”  Dkt. No. 34-11 (Ex. J) at ECF p. 2.  The letter \n24  included another chart stating that, “as of April 30 unless otherwise stated,” waivers were \n25  approved for “579 (768 as of May 31)” applicants out of 33,176 applications that had been \n26 \n                                                 \n2 Ms. Waters’ chart contains a number of deductions, e.g., for “applicants refused for reasons \n27 \nunrelated to the Proclamation” (1,723) and “applicants who failed to meet the criteria for a \nwaiver” (6,282).  But even with those deductions, out of 273 applicants who presumptively \n28 \nqualified for a waiver, only 2 were granted.  That amounts to a 0.73% approval rate. \n6 \n\n \n1  received “from impacted nationalities.”  Id. at ECF p. 4.  The Court’s math indicates that this \n2  amounts to approval rates of 1.75% and 2.3%, for April 30, 2018, and May 31, 2018, \n3  respectively.3   \n4  Other exhibits in the complaint provide additional factual background.  These include a \n5  declaration by a former consular officer, Christopher Richardson, Esq., who was employed by the \n6  United States Department of State from 2011 to 2018, and most recently as American Citizens \n7  Services Chief at the United States Embassy in Madrid, Spain.  Dkt. No. 34-3 (Ex. B) ¶ 3.  \n8  Mr. Richardson states that he had access to “all the state department guidance, cables, sample Q’s \n9  and A’s and instructions regarding” the Proclamation, and when read together, it was “understood \n10  that there really is no waiver and the Supreme Court was correct to point out that the waiver is \n11  merely ‘window dressing.’”  Id. ¶¶ 4, 10.  Furthermore, “[a]s a Consular officer previously \n12  employed by the State Department [his] impression and interpretation of how we as officers were \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  to apply the waiver process was” that “we were not allowed to exercise that discretion [to grant a \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  waiver].  We were mandated to send notice to Washington that we found this applicant eligible to \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  apply and Washington would then make the decision to grant or deny the waiver.”  Id. ¶ 11.   \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Plaintiffs have also provided a sample waiver denial letter from the Consular Section of the \nS d nr\nee 17  United States Embassy for Yerevan, Armenia.  Dkt. No. 34-10 (Ex. I).  It reads, “Dear Applicant: \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  This is to inform you that a consular officer found you ineligible for a visa under Section 212(f) of \n19  the Immigration and Nationality Act, pursuant to Presidential Proclamation 9645.  Today’s \n20  decision cannot be appealed.”  Id.  The letter offers only two options for the consular officer to \n21  choose.  The first option states:  “Taking into account the provisions of the Proclamation, a waiver \n22  will not be granted in your case.”  Id.  The second states:  “The consular officer is reviewing your \n23  eligibility for a waiver under the Proclamation.  . . . You will be contacted with a final \n24  determination on your visa application as soon as practicable.”  Id.  The sample form comes with \n25 \n26 \n                                                 \n3 Again, even excluding Ms. Waters’ figures for those applicants “found ineligible for reasons \n27 \nother than those covered in P.P. 9645” (4,900) and those applicants “who received a visa under an \nexception from P.P. 9645” (4,900), results in waiver approval rates of 2.13% and 2.83% as of \n28 \nApril 30, 2018, and May 30, 2018, respectively. \n7 \n\n \n1  the first box pre-checked to show that a waiver was denied.  No box is provided in the form to \n2  show that a waiver has been granted.   \n3  III.  PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS \n4  The named plaintiffs and putative class members are United States citizens, and lawful \n5  permanent residents and foreign nationals hailing from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.  \n6  Dkt. No. 34 ¶ 4.  The complaint organizes plaintiffs into two groups.  In the Family Member Class \n7  are United States citizens and lawful permanent residents whose family members are subject to the \n8  entry restrictions imposed by the Proclamation.  Id. ¶ 11.  In the Visa Applicant Class are the \n9  Iranian, Libyan, Somali, Syrian and Yemeni visa applicants themselves whom the Proclamation \n10  would bar from the United States absent a waiver.  Id. ¶ 12. \n11  The number of named plaintiffs is quite sizable, and so the Court highlights just a few \n12  representative accounts of their waiver experiences as alleged in the complaint.  Plaintiff Tanaz \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Toloubeydokhti is a United States citizen of Iranian origin who lives in San Diego, California, and \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  works in obstetrics and gynecology.  Dkt. No. 34 ¶¶ 98-99.  In 2016, Ms. Toloubeydokhti \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  petitioned for immigrant visas for her parents, plaintiffs Fathollah Tolou Beydokhti and Behnaz \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Malekghaeini, who are both Iranian nationals.  The petitions were approved and her parents’ visa \nS d nr\nee 17  interviews were scheduled for December 21, 2017, at the United States Embassy in Yerevan, \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Armenia.  Id. ¶ 100.  Her parents had “put together documents they believed would demonstrate \n19  that they meet the criteria for a waiver under the terms of the Proclamation.”  Id. ¶ 101.  But \n20  “when they attempted to present those documents to the consular official, the official refused to \n21  review them, stated that they did not qualify for a waiver, and stated that their visas were denied.”  \n22  Id.  Because of the denial, Mr. Beydokhti and Ms. Malekghaeini were unable to enter the United \n23  States to be with their daughter and newborn grandchild.  Id. ¶ 103. \n24  Plaintiff Malik Almathil is a United States citizen living in New York City who petitioned \n25  in March 2015 for entry of his Yemeni wife currently residing in Jordan.  Id. ¶ 132-33.  The \n26  petition was approved, and Mrs. Almathil attended her visa interview in Djibouti on July 31, 2017, \n27  before the Proclamation went into effect.  Id. ¶ 133.  On December 17, 2017, soon after the \n28  Proclamation was promulgated, she received “a boilerplate denial of a visa and waiver,” without \n8 \n\n \n1  ever being given the opportunity to submit documents to demonstrate her eligibility for a waiver.  \n2  Id. ¶¶ 134-36.  Because of the situation in Yemen, Mrs. Almathil “had to leave the country in 2015 \n3  and is unable to return.”  Id. ¶ 138.  And because Mr. Almathil had to “return to the United States \n4  to resume earning a living so that he can provide for himself and his wife,” husband and wife are \n5  currently living in separate countries.  Id. \n6  Plaintiff Ismail Alghazali is a United States citizen of Yemeni origin currently residing in \n7  Djibouti.  Id. ¶ 123.  He petitioned for a family-based immigrant visa for his wife in mid-2016, \n8  and the petition was approved in late 2016.  Id. ¶ 124.  She attended her interview at the United \n9  States consulate in Djibouti on January 3, 2018, and “was informed immediately that her visa was \n10  denied and that she would not be considered for a waiver.”  Id. ¶¶ 124-25.  She was never \n11  informed that she could seek to demonstrate her eligibility for a waiver, nor given an opportunity \n12  to submit documents in support of a waiver application.  Id. ¶¶ 126-27.  She was pregnant at the \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  time of her interview and gave birth (in a taxi cab with no medical assistance) about a month after.  \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Id. ¶ 130.  Mr. Alghazali was forced to leave the United States and his job here so that he could be \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  with his wife and infant son in Djibouti.  Id. ¶ 129. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Plaintiff Soheil Vazehrad is a United States citizen of Iranian origin currently residing in \nS d nr\nee 17  Napa, California.  Id. ¶ 181.  He applied for a fiancé visa for plaintiff Atefehossadat \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Motavaliabyazani, an Iranian national currently in Iran, in April 2016, and the petition was \n19  approved in May 2016.  Id. ¶¶ 182-83.  Ms. Motavaliabyazani attended her interview at the United \n20  States embassy in Yerevan, Armenia, on October 20, 2016, almost a year before the Proclamation \n21  was issued, and on January 4, 2018, received an email identical in substance to the letter attached \n22  as Exhibit I to plaintiffs’ complaint and described above.  Id. ¶¶ 184-85.  Like the letter, the email \n23  contained only two options -- either denying a waiver or informing the applicant that “[t]he \n24  consular officer is reviewing your eligibility for a waiver” -- and like the sample letter attached to \n25  the complaint, the email Ms. Motavaliabyazani received had the first box checked, informing her \n26  that a waiver would not be granted in her case.  Dkt. No. 34-13 (Ex. L).  She was never informed \n27  that she could seek to demonstrate her eligibility for a waiver, nor given the opportunity to submit \n28  documents in support of a waiver application.  Dkt. No. 34 ¶¶ 186-87.    \n9 \n\n \n1  Plaintiff Hoda Mehrabi Mohammad Abadi is an Iranian national who invested $500,000.00 \n2  in the United States as part of her petition for an employment-based fifth preference (EB-5) \n3  investment visa.  Id. ¶ 255.  Her petition was approved in June 2016, and she attended her \n4  immigrant visa interview at the United States embassy in Yerevan, Armenia, on February 23, \n5  2017, seven months before the Proclamation was issued.  Id. ¶ 256.  On December 14, 2017, “her \n6  attorney received the same boilerplate email denying her a visa and a waiver under the \n7  Proclamation.”  Id. ¶ 257.  Even after her attorney contacted the embassy requesting that \n8  Ms. Mehrabi Mohammad Abadi’s case be considered for a waiver, the embassy responded, \n9  “Unfortunately, your case is not eligible for a waiver under Presidential Proclamation 9645.”  Id. \n10  ¶ 260.  Ms. Mehrabi Mohammad Abadi asserts that she consequently was “unable to submit \n11  documents in support of a waiver application.”  Id. ¶ 261. \n12  The complaint provides similar accounts of family separation and dislocation for the other \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  named plaintiffs.  On the basis of these factual allegations, plaintiffs assert three legal claims:  \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706; violation of the Due Process \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution; and for a writ of mandamus.   \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  LEGAL STANDARDS \nS d nr\nee 17  The standards governing defendants’ motion to dismiss are well-established.  Rule 8(a)(2) \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires that a complaint must contain “a short and plain \n19  statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.”  To meet that rule and survive \n20  a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a plaintiff must allege “enough facts to state a claim to relief \n21  that is plausible on its face.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  This does not \n22  impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage.  “[I]t simply calls for enough fact to raise a \n23  reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of” the conduct challenged by plaintiff.  \n24  Id. at 556.  “A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the \n25  court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  \n26  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556).  In addition, the \n27  allegations in the complaint must be sufficiently clear and concrete to give the defendant an “idea \n28  [of] where to begin” in preparing a response to the complaint.  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 565 n.10.  \n10 \n\n \n1  Determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief is a “context-specific task that \n2  requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.”  Iqbal, 556 \n3  U.S. at 679. \n4  The Court will assume that plaintiffs’ factual allegations are true, and will draw all \n5  reasonable inferences in their favor.  Usher v. City of Los Angeles, 828 F.2d 556, 561 (9th Cir. \n6  1987).  But it will not “accept as true allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted \n7  deductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences.”  In re Gilead Scis. Sec. Litig., 536 F.3d 1049, \n8  1055 (9th Cir. 2008) (quotation omitted).  If the complaint is dismissed, an opportunity to amend \n9  will be provided unless the Court determines that no cure is possible by new allegations of fact.  \n10  Lopez v. Smith, 203 F.3d 1122, 1130-31 (9th Cir. 2000). \n11  DISCUSSION \na  12  I.  JUSTICIABILITY AND THE SCOPE OF PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS \ntr in\nuoro 13  The first question raised in the government’s motion is whether plaintiffs’ claims are \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  justiciable, or whether they should be dismissed, as the government contends, under the doctrine \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  of the nonreviewability of consular decisions.  This is one of the government’s main contentions \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  for dismissal.  See, e.g., Dkt. No. 42 at 1 (“[C]onsular nonreviewability prevents a court [from] \nS d nr\nee 17  overturning consular officers’ decisions or interfering with their decision-making.”); id. at 3 \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  (“Plaintiffs’ claims are barred by 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(1) because the INA precludes judicial review \n19  of consular visa decisions.”); id. at 4 (“Consular officers’ decisions to grant or deny waivers and to \n20  revoke visas are committed to their discretion by law and therefore judicially unreviewable.”); id. \n21  at 6 (“Although plaintiffs’ challenge is styled as a challenge to the waiver process, they seek APA \n22  review of consular officers’ individual decisions to deny visas.”). \n23  It is certainly true that certain immigration or exclusion decisions are not reviewable in \n24  court.  See Hawaii, 138 S.Ct. at 2407; Rivas v. Napolitano, 714 F.3d 1108, 1110-11 (9th Cir. \n25  2013).  Because the complaint is at points rather loosely worded, it might seem on occasion that \n26  plaintiffs are straying into unreviewable areas.  But plaintiffs substantially clarified and narrowed \n27  the scope of their claims in their opposition brief and during oral argument.  In response to the \n28  government’s contention, plaintiffs expressly state that they “do not challenge individual consular \n11 \n\n \n1  officer decisions on the merits and do not challenge the outcome of any particular consular \n2  officer’s decision in a given case.”  Dkt. No. 57 at 1; see also id. at 2 (“this is not a case seeking \n3  review of an individual consular officer’s discretionary decision”); id. at 5 (“individual visa \n4  denials” are “not at issue here”).  That is entirely consistent with a fair reading of the complaint, \n5  which leaves no doubt that plaintiffs are challenging systemic practices with respect to the waiver \n6  program, and not individualized determinations for any specific person.  The gravamen of the \n7  complaint is that the government has flouted its own guidelines and statements about case-by-case \n8  determinations of waiver applications in favor of a policy of blanket denials.  See Dkt. No. 68 at \n9  17:12-15 (plaintiffs’ statement at the motion hearing that their “APA claim fundamentally rests on \n10  that idea that when an agency holds itself forth as providing a process, it must actually provide \n11  that process; and it can’t go against its own guidelines.”).  Those issues do not require review of \n12  an individual consular officer’s decision.  Consequently, dismissal for lack of a justiciable \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  controversy is denied.   \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Another important clarification by plaintiffs concerns the scope of the APA claim.  The \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  complaint suggests in places that plaintiffs might be contemplating a violation of the Immigration \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  and Nationality Act as the basis of their APA claim.  See, e.g., Dkt. No. 34 ¶ 319 (“Defendants \nS d nr\nee 17  have acted arbitrarily and capriciously and in contravention of . . . the INA . . . , and they have thus \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  violated the APA.”); id. at 68 (Prayer for Relief, ¶ 4) (seeking declaration that “defendants’ refusal \n19  to give full and fair consideration for waivers to all visa applicants from the banned countries \n20  violates . . . the INA”).  At the motion hearing, plaintiffs expressly disclaimed an APA claim \n21  premised on any “particular provision of the INA” or any claim that defendants violated “any \n22  specific section of the INA.”  Dkt. No. 68 at 17:16-18:3.  The complaint will be construed in light \n23  of this clarification.  Plaintiffs also acknowledged, as the Supreme Court’s opinion in Hawaii \n24  essentially compels, that they “do not challenge the Proclamation itself.”  Dkt. No. 57 at 1.   \n25  Nor do plaintiffs seek to enforce the terms of the Proclamation.  Rather, they are pursuing \n26  an APA claim based on the allegation that the State Department is not following its own waiver \n27  guidance.  Consequently, the Court need not address the issue of whether a private citizen can sue \n28 \n12 \n\n \n1  to enforce a Presidential Proclamation, which is by no means a self-evident proposition.  See East \n2  Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 909 F.3d 1219, 1250 (9th Cir. 2018). \n3  II.  APA CLAIM \n4  The Administrative Procedure Act creates a “basic presumption of judicial review [for] one \n5  suffering legal wrong because of agency action.”  Weyerhaeuser Co. v. U.S. Fish and Wildlife \n6  Serv., 139 S.Ct. 361, 370 (2018) (alterations in original; quotation omitted).  Our circuit has \n7  construed the APA to provide for “broad judicial review of agency action:  ‘A person suffering \n8  legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within \n9  the meaning of a relevant statute, is entitled to judicial review thereof.’”  Regents of the Univ. of \n10  Cal. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 908 F.3d 476, 494 (9th Cir. 2018) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 702).  \n11  The APA also states that “[a]gency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action for \n12  which there is no other adequate remedy in a court are subject to judicial review.”  5 U.S.C. § 704.  \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Section 706 authorizes the reviewing court to “compel agency action unlawfully withheld” as well \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  as to set aside any agency action that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. §§ 706(1) and (2)(A).   \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Plaintiffs’ APA claim has solid legal support in the “well-established” proposition that \nS d nr\nee 17  “agencies may be required to abide by certain internal policies.”  Alcaraz v. Immigration and \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Naturalization Serv., 384 F.3d 1150, 1162 (9th Cir. 2004).  This proposition was first recognized \n19  in United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260 (1954), which involved an \n20  immigration dispute with overtones similar to this one.  The plaintiff in Accardi was an Italian \n21  immigrant who challenged the validity of a decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals \n22  (“BIA”) that denied his deportation appeal.  Id. at 262-63.  The Supreme Court reversed and \n23  ordered a new appeal hearing because the BIA had not acted in conformance with its governing \n24  regulations.  Those regulations required the BIA to exercise its own judgment and discretion when \n25  considering appeals, but the record indicated that the BIA had summarily denied Accardi’s appeal \n26  because he was on a list sent from the Attorney General of “unsavory characters” slated for \n27  deportation.  Id. at 264-67.  The Supreme Court concluded that the BIA’s decision was invalid \n28 \n13 \n\n \n1  because it had not, in fact, exercised its discretion as required by the regulations, but had instead \n2  allowed the Attorney General to dictate the result.  Id.   \n3  The holding that administrative agencies are bound to follow their rules and guidelines has \n4  since been called the Accardi doctrine.  The Supreme Court reinvigorated the principle in Morton \n5  v. Ruiz, 415 U.S. 199, 235 (1974):  “Where the rights of individuals are affected, it is incumbent \n6  upon agencies to follow their own procedures.  This is so even where the internal procedures are \n7  possibly more rigorous than otherwise would be required.”  The doctrine applies to an agency’s \n8  procedures however they might be denominated.  See, e.g., Church of Scientology of Cal. v. \n9  United States, 920 F.2d 1481, 1487 (9th Cir. 1990) (“Pursuant to the Accardi doctrine, an \n10  administrative agency is required to adhere to its own internal operating procedures.”); see also \n11  Romeiro de Silva v. Smith, 773 F.2d 1021, 1025 (9th Cir. 1985) (noting that the INS can be bound \n12  by its “operations instructions”).  What is critical under the doctrine is that an agency can be sued \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  for failing to abide by the rules and procedures it formulates to perform its duties.   \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  The government does not seriously contest this point, see Dkt. No. 58 at 6 n.4, and for \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  good reason.  The State Department is without doubt an agency for purposes of the APA.  Allen v. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Milas, 896 F.3d 1094, 1102-03 (9th Cir. 2018).  The State Department created rules and \nS d nr\nee 17  procedures for the waiver program, as detailed in plaintiffs’ exhibits, and recognized the materials \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  it promulgated as such.  See, e.g., Dkt. No. 68 at 9:5-7 (State Department’s online postings were \n19  its “outward facing guidance” for waivers).  The heart of the APA claim is that the State \n20  Department has acted arbitrarily and unlawfully by disregarding its own procedures and rules in \n21  administering the waiver program.  That is a legally sound claim, and other courts have also \n22  allowed APA claims in similar circumstances.  See Torres v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., No. \n23  17cv1840 JM (NLS), 2017 WL 4340385, at *5 (S.D. Cal. Sept. 29, 2017) (APA claim based on \n24  DHS failure to follow Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program rules and standard \n25  operating procedures) (citing Accardi, 347 U.S. at 268, and Alcaraz, 384 F.3d at 1162); Damus v. \n26  Nielsen, 313 F. Supp. 3d 317, 335-38 (D.D.C. 2018) (APA claim based on DHS failure to comply \n27  with an ICE Parole Directive).   \n28 \n14 \n\n \n1  The next question is whether plaintiffs have alleged enough in the way of facts to state a \n2  plausible APA claim under Accardi.  They have.  To start, the parties agree that individuals \n3  subject to the Proclamation who seek a waiver in order to travel to the United States are required \n4  to “disclose during the visa interview any information that might demonstrate that he or she is \n5  eligible for a waiver.”  Dkt. No. 34-4 (Ex. C) at ECF p. 6.  The government repeatedly affirmed \n6  this point and emphasized the importance of the visa interview to the waiver program process at \n7  the motion hearing.  See, e.g., Dkt. No. 68 at 9:11-14 (“There is always a visa interview.  So issues \n8  on the undue harm and the national interest would be raised at the interview.”); id. at 23:4-8 \n9  (“[T]he guidance was clear on that from the beginning.  It says you ask at the interview, and you \n10  explain the circumstances at the interview that would entitle you -- it will help you meet the \n11  burden and the national interest test.”).   \n12  Plaintiffs allege many instances where applicants whose visa interviews took place before \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  the Proclamation were denied a visa and a waiver in summary fashion after the Proclamation was \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  signed, and with no further interview or opportunity to submit documents and demonstrate \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  eligibility for a waiver.  See, e.g., Dkt. No. 34 ¶¶ 133-36, 184-87.  Plaintiffs have identified other \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  occasions on which consular officers refused to consider or even accept documents offered to \nS d nr\nee 17  them, on one occasion at the visa interview.  Id. ¶ 101; see also id. ¶¶ 257-61.  These facts \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  adequately allege that the State Department has not followed its own guidance with respect to its \n19  requirement that visa applicants must disclose at their visa interviews any information that might \n20  demonstrate that the applicant is eligible for a waiver. \n21  Plaintiffs allege other failures by the State Department to adhere to its own rules.  For \n22  example, the waiver guidance states that individual consular officers will exercise discretion to \n23  grant waivers on a case-by-case basis when they find the requirements for a waiver to be satisfied.  \n24  See, e.g., Dkt. No. 34-4 (Ex. C) at ECF p. 6 (“consular officers may issue a visa based on a listed \n25  waiver category to nationals of countries identified in the PP on a case-by-case basis, when they \n26  determine . . . .”).  Contrary to this avowed process, plaintiffs allege facts plausibly demonstrating \n27  that a de facto policy of blanket denials has usurped individualized waiver decisions.  These facts \n28  include the declaration of a former consular officer who states that “we were not allowed to \n15 \n\n \n1  exercise that discretion” and that “there really is no waiver,” Dkt. No. 34-3 (Ex. B), and evidence \n2  showing that the sample waiver letter had the “denied” box pre-checked and contained no option \n3  for the grant of a waiver at all.  Dkt. No. 34-10 (Ex. I).  And as discussed, the complaint also \n4  offers the testimonials of applicants who were summarily denied waivers and visas, in some cases \n5  with the same form letter and in others without ever having had a post-Proclamation visa interview \n6  or any other opportunity to make his or her case for a waiver.   \n7  Consequently, the Court concludes that plaintiffs have stated an APA claim under the \n8  Accardi doctrine.  The government has not persuasively argued otherwise.  It puts substantial \n9  emphasis on a number of factual matters, see, e.g., Dkt. No. 58 at 1, 9 (asserting facts about waiver \n10  reviews and approval figures), but those issues are of course properly addressed in a summary \n11  judgment motion (if truly undisputed) or at trial, and not in a motion to dismiss.  The government \n12  also suggests that the Supreme Court already rejected in Hawaii any claim that the waiver process \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  is a sham, but that reading goes too far.  The footnote in the majority opinion about the evidentiary \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  record, 138 S.Ct. at 2423 n.7, hardly constitutes a clear holding that bars the door to plaintiffs’ \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  claims here.  To the contrary, the better conclusion is that the government’s conduct should be \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  tested on a full record, as plaintiffs propose to do in this case.   \nS d nr\nee 17  III.  FIFTH AMENDMENT CLAIM \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Plaintiffs also allege claims under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution \n19  for substantive and procedural due process deprivations, and an equal protection violation.  Dkt. \n20  No. 34 ¶¶ 322-34.  The Fifth Amendment provides that “[n]o person shall be . . . deprived of life, \n21  liberty, or property, without due process of law.”   \n22  For the due process claim, the threshold question is whether a plaintiff was deprived of any \n23  of these interests, because “no process is due if one is not deprived of ‘life, liberty, or property.’”  \n24  Kerry v. Din, 135 S.Ct. 2128, 2132 (2015) (Scalia, J., plurality opinion) (quotation omitted, \n25  emphasis in original).  Plaintiffs do not directly allege such a deprivation, so the question is \n26  whether they were deprived of “certain implied ‘fundamental rights’” that are understood to be \n27  included under the “liberty” prong.  Id. at 2133.  This is also lacking.  Plaintiffs have not alleged \n28  any constitutionally protected fundamental rights for either the Family Member Class or the Visa \n16 \n\n \n1  Applicant Class.  They refer to a “right” to the “integrity of the family unit,” but even assuming \n2  such a right can be found in the Fifth Amendment, which is not at all clear, plaintiffs concede that \n3  it would “not amount to a right of entry for foreign nationals, nor to an unfettered right to reside in \n4  the United States with family members who are foreign nationals.”  Dkt. No. 57 at 13.  Indeed, the \n5  Supreme Court has held in a plurality opinion that “[e]ven if we might ‘imply’ a liberty interest in \n6  marriage generally speaking, that must give way when there is a tradition denying the specific \n7  application of that general interest . . . .  Although immigration was effectively unregulated prior \n8  to 1875, as soon as Congress began legislating in this area it enacted a complicated web of \n9  regulations that erected serious impediments to a person’s ability to bring a spouse into the United \n10  States.”  Din, 135 S.Ct. at 2135.  Plaintiffs’ inability to allege a deprivation of an interest protected \n11  by the Due Process Clause means their claim must be dismissed in both its procedural and \n12  substantive iterations.  The dismissal is without prejudice and plaintiffs may amend, if they so \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  choose.  \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Plaintiffs’ equal protection claim under the Fifth Amendment is also dismissed.  Although \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  the Fifth Amendment does not contain an express equal protection clause, its Due Process Clause \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  has been interpreted to include an equal protection component.  See Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. \nS d nr\nee 17  497, 499-500 (1954); Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 93 (1976).  Even so, there are problems with \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  plaintiffs’ equal protection claim.  Their claim is that the “waiver guidance that has issued has \n19  been arbitrary and capricious and designed to result in almost-uniform denials.  Taken as true, and \n20  given the background against which the waiver scheme arose, this supports an inference that the \n21  agency has a policy of denying waivers on discriminatory grounds, including nationality or \n22  religion.”  Dkt. No. 57 at 14.  This inference is not nearly as obvious as plaintiffs suggest, and \n23  demands assumptions unsupported by non-conclusory allegations of fact.  That will not do under \n24  Twombly and Iqbal.  See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 768.  In addition, the logic that “almost-uniform \n25  denials” of waivers is tantamount to denial of “waivers on discriminatory grounds” holds together \n26  only if it is assumed that the Proclamation unconstitutionally excludes Muslims or illegally \n27  discriminates on the basis of nationality, a proposition that the Supreme Court turned aside in \n28  Hawaii.  138 S.Ct. at 2413-23.   \n17 \n\n \n1  The Court also notes, without firmly deciding the question at this time, that the equal \n2  protection claim would likely be subject to rational basis review.  See Ledezma-Cosino v. Sessions, \n3  857 F.3d 1042, 1048 (9th Cir. 2017).  The Supreme Court has already concluded in reviewing the \n4  Proclamation that “the Government has set forth a sufficient national security justification to \n5  survive rational basis review.”  Hawaii, 138 S.Ct. at 2423.  This is another sizeable roadblock to \n6  the equal protection claim as currently alleged.  But plaintiffs will have an opportunity to amend \n7  this claim too.   \n8  IV.  MANDAMUS CLAIM \n9  Plaintiffs’ final claim, for a writ of mandamus, is also dismissed without prejudice.  The \n10  writ of mandamus is “intended to provide a remedy for a plaintiff only if he [or she] has exhausted \n11  all other avenues of relief and only if the defendant owes him [or her] a clear nondiscretionary \n12  duty.”  Heckler v. Ringer, 466 U.S. 602, 616-17 (1984). \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Plaintiffs themselves have acknowledged the duplicative nature of their mandamus claim \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  and that it may not be necessary.  See, e.g., Dkt. No. 57 at 15 (“Should this Court find that \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  plaintiffs are not entitled to relief under the APA or the Due Process Clause, mandamus relief \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  would still be available.”); Dkt. No. 68 at 21:3-5 (“I would say the core of our claim is the APA \nS d nr\nee 17  and the constitutional claims.”). \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Because the APA claim will go forward, the Court dismisses plaintiffs’ mandamus claim \n19  on the basis of plaintiffs’ representations that the mandamus claim is redundant.  The dismissal is \n20  without prejudice to renewing at a later time, should that become appropriate.  Plaintiffs’ \n21  mandamus claim may also become relevant to a discussion of the proper relief in this case. \n22  On that note, the prayer for relief in the complaint asks the Court to order the retraction of \n23  all visa denials and to order defendants to “fulfill their duties under the Proclamation.”  Dkt. \n24  No. 34 at 67.  The former may infringe impermissibly on individual consular officers’ decision-\n25  making, and the latter, as noted previously in this order, sounds like an impermissible attempt to \n26  enforce the Proclamation.  These issues are not squarely before the Court at this time, but plaintiffs \n27  may want to consider them if they amend the complaint.   \n28 \n18 \n\n \n1  CONCLUSION \n2  Defendants’ motion to dismiss is denied for plaintiffs’ APA claim.  The Fifth Amendment \n3  claim is dismissed with leave to file an amended complaint by February 25, 2019, if plaintiffs so \n4  choose.  The mandamus claim is dismissed without prejudice to potential remedies if appropriate \n5  at a later stage.   \n6  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n7  Dated:  February 4, 2019 \n8   \n9     \nJAMES DONATO \n10 \nUnited States District Judge \n11 \n12 \na \ntr in\nuoro 13 \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15 \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16 \nS d nr\nee 17 \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n19 ",
