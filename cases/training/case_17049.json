    "summary": "<p>On December 12, 2018, six low-income older adults and adults with disabilities filed a putative class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida. The case was assigned to Judge Robert L. Hinkle. Represented by Disability Rights Florida, Southern Legal Counsel, and Justice in Aging, the plaintiffs sued the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration and the Florida Department of Elder Affairs, under the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and the Medicaid Act. </p><p>The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants’ administration of the Medicaid long-term care system violated the civil rights of the plaintiffs by requiring them to choose between receiving needed care and remaining in their homes. Specifically, the defendants’ administrative, planning, and funding decisions heavily favored treatment in nursing facilities, perpetuating the unnecessary institutionalization and segregation of older adults and people with disabilities. The plaintiffs alleged that this violated Title II of the ADA. They sought declarative and injunctive relief. </p><p>On March 12, 2019, the plaintiffs sought to certify a class. The proposed class consisted of adult residents of Florida who were at risk of unnecessary institutionalization without home- and community-based long-term care services because they: (1) were residing, and wish to remain, at home or in a community residential setting; (2) qualified or would qualify if allowed to enroll in the Long-Term Care Waiver; and (3) had been placed on the Long-Term Care Waiver waitlist.   </p><p>The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on June 3, 2019, adding four new plaintiffs. On October 11, 2019, the defendants sought partial summary judgment as to the plaintiff's claim that \"despite the specific permission that federal law confers on Florida to limit the capacity of its program, the limits on enrollment in the long-term managed care program violate the general prohibition against discrimination in Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act.\"</p><p>The court denied class certification on October 27, 2019, citing a conflict among proposed class members and stating that the plaintiffs had failed to sufficiently establish the numerosity requirement for class certification. 2019 WL 5677948. This led the defendants to file a second motion for partial summary judgment on February 6, 2020, asserting that the plaintiffs could recover only individual relief, not classwide relief. Following this motion, the plaintiffs filed a second motion for class certification on February 10, 2020, modifying the proposed class to eliminate conflicts among proposed class members. In addition, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, as to one plaintiff, on February 20, 2020. </p><p>On March 31, 2020, the court issued a series of rulings on the motions. First, the court granted the defendants' motion for partial summary judgment, stating that although “the ADA requires a state to provide reasonable accommodations for disabilities...the ADA does not require such an accommodation if it would fundamentally alter a state's programs.”  An injunction requiring the state to serve additional individuals through the waiver—to obtain an increase in or to exceed the cap—would fundamentally alter the state's program. 2020 WL 1547880. Second, the court denied the plaintiff’s second motion to certify a class, finding that the motion was untimely and failed to adequately meet the prerequisites of class certification. 2020 WL 1545739. Third, the court granted in part the defendant’s second motion for summary judgment. As the court denied the plaintiff’s second motion to certify class, the court dismissed any claims for relief on behalf of individuals who were not named plaintiffs. 2020 WL 1545738.</p><p>On May 11, 2020, the parties notified the court that they had reached a settlement in principle and would file dismissal documents in 30 days. The next day, the court dismissed all claims and reserved jurisdiction to enforce the order to comply with the settlement agreement. As of June 10, 2020, the settlement agreement has not been posted publicly. But as the enforcement of the settlement agreement is ongoing, this case remains open. </p><p></p>",

They need \nservices that could be provided in a long-term-care facility—a nursing home—but \nthey live and prefer to continue to live in the community. They allege they are \neligible for home and community-based services through the State of Florida’s \nMedicaid long-term-care waiver program. But they are on the program’s waitlist; \nthey are not currently receiving waiver services.  \nThe plaintiffs say this puts them at risk of unnecessary institutionalization, \nviolating the state’s duty under the Americans with Disabilities Act, as interpreted \nin Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581 (1999). That decision requires a \n \nCase No. 4:18cv569-RH-MJF\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00569-RH-MJF   Document 130   Filed 03/31/20   Page 2 of 4\n \nPage 2 of 4\n \nstate to provide needed services in the community, not in a nursing home, when \nthis can be done without fundamentally altering a state’s programs.  \nThe defendants are the Secretaries of the Florida Agency for Health Care \nAdministration and the Florida Department of Elder Affairs, the agencies that \nadminister the waiver program. \nThe state’s long-term-care waiver program is capped at 62,000 participants. \nThe Medicaid Act explicitly authorizes such a cap. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396n(c)(3)-\n(4), (9)-(10), 1396n(d)(3); 42 C.F.R. § 441.303(f)(6). The defendants have moved \nfor partial summary judgment, asserting that the Medicaid Act’s approval of caps \ntrumps the ADA’s requirement to provide services in the community.  \nThe plaintiffs assert, with the support of the United States as amicus curiae, \nthat the ADA and the Medicaid Act impose separate requirements and are both \nvalid. Quite so. The ADA requires a state to provide reasonable accommodations \nfor disabilities, including as necessary to avoid unnecessary institutionalization. \nBut as Olmstead recognized, there is an exception: the ADA does not require such \nan accommodation if it would fundamentally alter a state’s programs. See 28 \nC.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7)(i) (“A public entity shall make reasonable modifications in \npolicies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate \n \nCase No. 4:18cv569-RH-MJF\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00569-RH-MJF   Document 130   Filed 03/31/20   Page 3 of 4\n \nPage 3 of 4\n \nthat making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, \nprogram, or activity.”). \n A state request for approval to increase the cap would likely garner federal \napproval and would constitute a reasonable accommodation of the plaintiffs’ \ndisabilities. But at least in the circumstances of this case, an injunction requiring \nthe state to serve additional individuals through the waiver—to obtain an increase \nin or to exceed the cap—would fundamentally alter the state’s program. This is so \nas a matter of law. The same is true of an order requiring the state to establish a \nnew program outside the Medicaid system. See Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, \n527 U.S. 581, 603 n.14 (1999). Or to provide a service outside the Medicaid \nsystem that the state now provides only within the Medicaid system. Such \nfundamental alterations cannot properly be compelled.  \nEven so, this does not entitle the defendants to summary judgment across the \nboard. The record does not exclude the possibility that the plaintiffs will be entitled \nto relief that can be provided under the waiver without exceeding the cap. And the \nrecord does not exclude the possibility that the plaintiffs will be entitled to relief \nthrough existing programs the state operates outside the Medicaid system. The \nbottom line: the state will be required to provide a service to a plaintiff who needs \nit to avoid institutionalization only if the state can do so without exceeding the \nwaiver cap or through another existing program. \n \nCase No. 4:18cv569-RH-MJF\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00569-RH-MJF   Document 130   Filed 03/31/20   Page 4 of 4\n \nPage 4 of 4\n \n  For these reasons and those set out on the record of the summary-judgment \nhearing on March 27, 2020,  \n  IT IS ORDERED: \n  The defendants’ first motion for partial summary judgment, ECF No. 72, is \ngranted. I do not direct the entry of judgment under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 54(b). \n  SO ORDERED on March 31, 2020.     \n            s/Robert L.

      "text": "Case 4:18-cv-00569-RH-MJF   Document 132   Filed 03/31/20   Page 1 of 5\n \nPage 1 of 5\n \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE \nNORTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA \nTALLAHASSEE DIVISION \n \n \nBENJAMIN ALEXANDER et al., \n \n    Plaintiffs, \n \nv.              CASE NO.  4:18cv569-RH-MJF \n \nMARY MAYHEW et al., \n \n    Defendants. \n \n______________________________/ \n \n \nORDER DENYING THE SECOND  \nMOTION TO CERTIFY A CLASS \n \n \nThe plaintiffs in this proposed class action are adults with physical \ndisabilities or limitations. They need services that could be provided in a long-\nterm-care facility—a nursing home—but they live and prefer to continue to live in \nthe community. They allege they are eligible for home and community-based \nservices through the State of Florida’s Medicaid long-term-care waiver program. \nBut they are on the program’s waitlist; they are not currently receiving waiver \nservices.  \nThe plaintiffs say this puts them at risk of unnecessary institutionalization, \nviolating the state’s duty under the Americans with Disabilities Act, as interpreted \n \nCase No. 4:18cv569-RH-MJF\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00569-RH-MJF   Document 132   Filed 03/31/20   Page 2 of 5\n \nPage 2 of 5\n \nin Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581 (1999), to provide needed \nservices in the community, when this can be done without fundamentally altering a \nstate’s programs. The plaintiffs seek injunctive relief against the Secretaries of the \nFlorida Agency for Health Care Administration and the Florida Department of \nElder Affairs, the agencies that administer the waiver program. \nThe plaintiffs filed a timely motion to certify a class. The order of October \n27, 2019 denied the motion. At that time, the plaintiffs’ claim was that the state \nhad improperly ranked individuals—that is, proposed class members—on the wait \nlist. Ranking is a zero-sum game. If, as the plaintiffs asserted, an injunction was in \norder to require the state to change the ranking system, some proposed class \nmembers would move up, but others would move down. There was an \nirreconcilable conflict within the proposed class.  \nOn February 10, 2020—nearly a year after the deadline for a class-\ncertification motion—the plaintiffs filed a second motion to certify a class. By then \nthe plaintiffs had completely changed their theory of the case. Indeed, attempting \nto discern and track the plaintiffs’ shifting theories has been an effort to nail jello \nto a wall. At a motion hearing on March 27, 2020, the plaintiffs were still unable to \npropose terms of an injunction complying with the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n65(d)(1)(C) requirement to “describe in reasonable detail” the “act or acts \nrestrained or required.”  \n \nCase No. 4:18cv569-RH-MJF\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00569-RH-MJF   Document 132   Filed 03/31/20   Page 3 of 5\n \nPage 3 of 5\n \nThis order denies the second motion to certify a class for two reasons.  \nFirst, the motion is untimely. Fact discovery already has ended. The expert \ndiscovery deadline is approaching. The deadline to move for summary judgment is \napproaching. Allowing a completely reconstituted proposed class at this late date, \nso that the class could pursue a new theory, would prejudice the defendants.  \nSecond, the motion fails on the merits. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 \ngoverns class certification. The party who moves to certify a class has the burden \nof establishing that the Rule 23 criteria are met. See, e.g., Vega v. T-Mobile USA, \nInc., 564 F.3d 1256, 1265 (11th Cir. 2009). The Rule 23(a) criteria, each of which \nmust be satisfied, are commonly referred to as “numerosity, commonality, \ntypicality, and adequacy of representation.” Babineau v. Fed. Express Corp., 576 \nF.3d 1183, 1190 (11th Cir. 2009) (quoting Valley Drug Co. v. Geneva Pharm., \nInc., 350 F.3d 1181, 1187-88 (11th Cir. 2003)). In addition to the Rule 23(a) \ncriteria, a party must satisfy at least one Rule 23(b) criterion; the one at issue here \nis that a defendant “has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to \nthe class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is \nappropriate respecting the class as a whole.” These criteria were applied in a \nFlorida Medicaid waiver case in Long v. Benson, No. 4:08cv26-RH/WCS, 2008 \nWL 4571904 (N.D. Fla. Oct. 14, 2008).  \n \nCase No. 4:18cv569-RH-MJF\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00569-RH-MJF   Document 132   Filed 03/31/20   Page 4 of 5\n \nPage 4 of 5\n \nWithout a clearer articulation of the plaintiffs’ claim and proposed relief—\nwithout knowing what an injunction would require if the proposed class claim \nsucceeded—it is impossible to conclude that the plaintiffs have met the 23(a) or \n23(b) prerequisites to class certification. As set out in a separate order that will be \nissued contemporaneously with this order, the plaintiffs are not entitled to an \ninjunction requiring the defendants to obtain an increase in or to exceed the cap on \nthe state’s Medicaid long-term waiver program.  \nThe plaintiffs may assert—whether this part of the jello that will stick is \nunclear—that there is room under the cap. But even if such a claim goes forward, \nthe record does not show how much room exists under the cap or how many \nproposed class members might fit. Even if enough might fit to satisfy the \nnumerosity criterion, there would be an irreconcilable conflict among proposed \nclass members vying for a slot.  \nThe plaintiffs also may assert—more jello—that the plaintiffs will be \nentitled to relief through existing programs the state operates outside the Medicaid \nsystem. But the record does not show which programs this might be or how many \nproposed class members might qualify. The record does not show, for any such \nunspecified program, whether injunctive relief might ultimately be appropriate \nrespecting the class as a whole. Indeed, other than a fleeting reference during the \n \nCase No. 4:18cv569-RH-MJF\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00569-RH-MJF   Document 132   Filed 03/31/20   Page 5 of 5\n \nPage 5 of 5\n \nMarch 27 oral argument, it is not clear the plaintiffs have said they wish to receive \nservices through any such program. \nThe bottom line: the plaintiffs’ second motion to certify a class is both \nuntimely and substantively unfounded. \n  IT IS ORDERED: \nThe plaintiffs’ second motion to certify a class, ECF No. 101, is denied.  \nSO ORDERED on March 31, 2020. \n \n          s/Robert L.

The plaintiffs seek injunctive relief \nagainst the Secretaries of the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration and \nthe Florida Department of Elder Affairs, the agencies that administer the waiver \nprogram. \n  The plaintiffs have moved to certify a class consisting of adult residents of \nFlorida who live in the community, are eligible for long-term-care waiver services, \nand are on the waitlist. This order denies the motion. \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 governs class certification. The party \nwho moves to certify a class has the burden of establishing that the Rule 23 criteria \nare met. See, e.g., Vega v. T-Mobile USA, Inc., 564 F.3d 1256, 1265 (11th Cir. \n2009). The Rule 23(a) criteria are commonly referred to as “numerosity, \ncommonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation.” Babineau v. Fed. \nExpress Corp., 576 F.3d 1183, 1190 (11th Cir. 2009) (quoting Valley Drug Co. v. \nGeneva Pharm., Inc., 350 F.3d 1181, 1187-88 (11th Cir. 2003)). The criteria were \napplied in a Florida Medicaid waiver case in Long v. Benson, 4:08cv26-RH/WCS \n(Oct. 14, 2008).  \nThe plaintiffs’ motion has a fatal flaw that permeates several of the 23(a) \ncriteria, making it unnecessary to go further in the analysis. \nThere is an irreconcilable conflict within the class. The waitlist does not \noperate on the principle of first-come-first-served. Instead, the State applies a \n \nCase No. 4:18cv569-RH-MJF\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00569-RH-MJF   Document 80   Filed 10/27/19   Page 3 of 3\n \nPage 3 of 3\n \nmethodology intended to move the most critical cases to the front of the line. One \nof the named plaintiffs’ claims is that the methodology is flawed—that some \nindividuals, including the named plaintiffs, are farther down the list than they \nshould be.  \nRanking is a zero-sum game. If the named plaintiffs move up, someone else \nmust move down. The ones who would move down cannot adequately be \nrepresented by the named plaintiffs. The named plaintiffs’ claims are not typical of \nthe claims of those who would move down. And this, together with other analysis, \ncalls into question numerosity; there are more than 54,000 individuals on the \nwaitlist, but the record does not show how many would benefit from the named \nplaintiffs’ proposed changes to the ranking methodology, how many are at risk of \ninstitutionalization, or even how many are eligible for waiver services. See, e.g., \nVega, 564 F.3d at 1267-68 (holding that numerosity cannot be established by \nunsupported assumptions). \nIT IS ORDERED: \n  The class-certification motion, ECF No. 28, is denied.  \n  SO ORDERED on October 27, 2019.    \n            s/Robert L.

This is a statewide class action lawsuit brought by low-income older \nadults and adults with disabilities on a waitlist for long term care services.  They \n1 \n \n\n \nbring this suit because they seek, but cannot obtain, long-term care services in \ntheir homes or in other community-based settings.  Defendants have the ability, \nunder federal Medicaid law, to provide these services.  Instead, they ration \nservices to a restricted number of people, and, as a result, fail to address the care \nneeds  of  thousands  of  waitlisted  older  adults  and  adults  with  disabilities.  \nDefendants’ administration of the Medicaid long-term care system violates the \ncivil rights of the Named Plaintiffs and proposed class by requiring them to \nchoose between receiving needed care and remaining in their homes.   \n2.  Specifically,  Defendants’  administrative,  planning,  and  funding \ndecisions heavily favor nursing facility payment and nursing facility entry, \nwhile allowing the waitlist for Medicaid home and community based long-term \ncare services to grow to be the longest in the nation.  Meanwhile, Florida ranks \nnear the bottom in the nation in terms of Medicaid funding  of home and \ncommunity  based  services  as  compared  to  nursing  facility  expenditures.  \nDefendants utterly fail to meet the demonstrated need for home and community \nbased long-term care services. \n3.  Florida’s Statewide Medicaid Managed Care Long-Term Care Program \nincludes both nursing facility care and home and community based care services \nin a managed care system.  Plaintiffs have sought care and treatment through \n2 \n \n\n \nthe part of the program that would allow them to remain in their most integrated \nsetting, termed herein as the “Long-Term Care Waiver.”  Yet, because of the \ndiscriminatory way Defendants manage the public health care system, Named \nPlaintiffs  and  others  like  them  face  the  real  prospect  of  unnecessary \ninstitutionalization.   \n4.  Defendants’ failure to provide needed home and  community based \nservices to the Named Plaintiffs and proposed class violates the Americans with \nDisabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12132.   \nJURISDICTION \n5.  This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief under the ADA, \n42 U.S.C. § 12132. \n6.  This  Court  has  jurisdiction  over  the  subject  matter  of  this  action \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 & 1342.  Plaintiffs’ claims for declaratory and \ninjunctive relief are authorized under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-02.  \nVENUE \n7.  Venue lies in the Northern District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), and \nin the Tallahassee Division, because Defendants officially reside there.  N.D. \nFla. Loc. R. 3.1. \n \n3 \n \n\n \nNAMED PLAINTIFFS \n8.  BENJAMIN ALEXANDER is 55-years-old.  He lives with his elderly \nmother in Duval County, Florida.  He is a person with a disability under the \nADA.  He is eligible for the Long-Term Care Waiver.  He wishes to remain \nliving in the community with appropriate home and community based services.  \nMr. Alexander sought services through the Long-Term Care Waiver and was \nplaced on the waiting list in March 2018.   \n9.  GEORGE  COLLIER  is  91-years-old.  Pursuant  to  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P \n17(c)(2), he sues through his next friend, Timothy Collier.  He lives in an \nassisted living home in St. Lucie County, Florida.  He is a person with a \ndisability under the ADA.  He is eligible for the Long-Term Care Waiver.  He \nwishes  to  remain  living  in  the  community  with  appropriate  home  and \ncommunity based services.  Mr. Collier sought services through the Long-Term \nCare Waiver and was placed on the waitlist in 2015.   \n10.  RAIMUNDO LEAL is 76-years-old.  He lives in his own apartment in \nHillsborough County, Florida.  He is a person with a disability under the ADA.  \nHe is eligible for the Long-Term Care Waiver.  He wishes to remain living in \nthe community with appropriate home and community based services.  Mr. Leal \nsought services through the Long-Term Care Waiver and was placed on the \n4 \n \n\n \nwaitlist in 2016. \n11.  JEFFERSON LANGLAISE is 50-years-old.  He lives in an assisted \nliving home in Miami-Dade County, Florida.  He is a person with a disability \nunder the ADA.  He is eligible for the Long-Term Care Waiver.  He wishes to \nremain living in the community with appropriate home and community based \nservices.  Mr. Langlaise sought services through the Long-Term Care Waiver \nin 2017 and was placed on the waitlist in 2018. \n12.  CELIA LOPEZ is 82-years-old.  Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P 17(c)(2), \nshe sues through her next friend, Javier Lopez.  She lives in Miami-Dade \nCounty, Florida with her granddaughter, her granddaughter’s husband and three \ngreat-grandchildren.  She is a person with a disability under the ADA.  She is \neligible for the Long-Term Care Waiver.  She wishes to remain living in the \ncommunity with appropriate home and community based services.  Ms. Lopez \nsought services through the Long-Term Care Waiver and was placed on the \nwaitlist in November 2014. \n13.  GERARLDINE DAVENPORT is 90-years-old.  Pursuant to Fed. R. \nCiv. P 17(c)(2), she sues through her next friend, Barbara Roti.  She lives in an \nassisted living home in St. Lucie County, Florida.  She is a person with a \ndisability under the ADA.  She is eligible for the Long-Term Care Waiver.  She \n5 \n \n\n \nwishes  to  remain  living  in  the  community  with  appropriate  home  and \ncommunity based services.  Ms. Davenport sought services through the Long-\nTerm Care Waiver and was placed on the waitlist in 2013. \nDEFENDANTS \n14.  Defendant  JUSTIN  SENIOR  is  Secretary  of  Florida’s  Agency  for \nHealth Care Administration (AHCA) and is sued in his official capacity.  (This \nDefendant will be referenced by the agency, AHCA.)  AHCA is the “single state \nagency” that operates and administers Florida’s Medicaid program, including \nFlorida’s Long-Term Care Waiver, and is charged with developing legislative \nbudgetary requests for the Medicaid program.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(5), \n§ 20.42(3), Fla. Stat. (2018), § 216.023, Fla. Stat. (2018).  Secretary Senior is \nresponsible  for  the  oversight,  supervision,  and  control  of  AHCA  and  its \ndivisions, and is ultimately responsible for ensuring that AHCA’s services for \npeople with disabilities are provided in conformance with federal law. \n15.  Defendant JEFFREY BRAGG is Secretary of Florida’s Department of \nElder Affairs (DOEA), and is sued in his official capacity.  (This Defendant will \nbe referenced by the agency, DOEA.)  DOEA is the primary state agency \nresponsible for administering human services programs for the elderly and \ndeveloping policy recommendations for long-term care.  § 430.03, Fla. Stat. \n6 \n \n\n \n(2018).  It recommends legislative budget requests for programs and services \nfor the state’s elderly population.  Id.  Among other duties, DOEA prepares, \nsubmits to the Governor and the Legislature, and monitors implementation of a \nmaster plan for policies and programs in Florida that relate to aging.   Id. \n§ 430.04.  DOEA funds a community care service system, the declared primary \npurpose  of  which  is  “the  prevention  of  unnecessary  institutionalization  of \nfunctionally impaired elderly persons through the provision of  community-\nbased core services.”  Id. § 430.204.  DOEA is also the agency responsible for \nmaintaining the statewide waitlist for the Long-Term Care Waiver, including \nassessing each applicant’s priority status on that waitlist and making offers of \nenrollment to eligible individuals.  Id. § 409.979. \n16.  At all times relevant to this Complaint, Defendants were public entities \nunder the ADA.  42 U.S.C. § 12132. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n17.  Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and (b)(2), the Named Plaintiffs bring \nthis action on behalf of themselves and all other persons similarly situated. \n18.  The proposed class consists of:   \nAdult  residents  of  Florida  who  are  at  risk  of  unnecessary \ninstitutionalization without home and community based long-\nterm care services because they:  (1) are residing, and wish to \n7 \n \n\n \nremain, at home or in a community residential setting; (2) qualify \nor would qualify if allowed to enroll in the Long-Term Care \nWaiver;  and  (3)  have  been  placed  on  the  Long-Term  Care \nWaiver waitlist.  \n \n19. Numerosity:  The proposed class is so numerous that joinder of all its \nmembers is impracticable.  According to the  Florida  Department of Elder \nAffairs, as of August 2018, there were more than 50,000 people on a waitlist \nfor home and community based services through the Long-Term Care Waiver.   \n20. Commonality:  The questions of law or fact that are common to the \nNamed Plaintiffs and proposed class members include: \na.   Whether Defendants’ failure to provide needed home and community \nbased services to the Named Plaintiffs and proposed class members violates the \nADA.  \nb.  Whether the Named Plaintiffs and proposed class members can access \nappropriate long-term care services outside of entry to a nursing facility. \nc.  Whether Defendants’ Medicaid funded long-term care system favors \ninstitutional services to the detriment of the Named Plaintiffs and proposed \nclass members seeking home and community based services. \n21. Typicality:  The claims of the Named Plaintiffs are typical of the claims \nof the class as a whole in that the Named Plaintiffs and proposed class members \n8 \n \n\n \nare  all  qualified  individuals  with  disabilities  who  wish  to  remain  in  the \ncommunity, but who are without Medicaid long-term care services and are at \nrisk of unnecessary institutionalization. \n22. Adequate representation:  The Named Plaintiffs will fairly represent and \nadequately protect the interests of the proposed class as a whole.  The Named \nPlaintiffs do not have any interests antagonistic to those of other proposed class \nmembers.  By filing this action, the Named Plaintiffs have displayed an interest \nin vindicating their rights, as well as the claims of others who are similarly \nsituated.  The relief sought by the Named Plaintiffs will inure to the benefit of \nmembers of the proposed class generally.  The Named Plaintiffs are represented \nby counsel who are skilled and knowledgeable about civil rights litigation, \ndisability discrimination, Medicaid law, practice and procedure in the federal \ncourts, and the prosecution and management of class action litigation.  \n23. Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable \nto the proposed class, thereby making final injunctive relief appropriate with \nrespect  to  the  proposed  class  as  a  whole  under  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  23(b)(2).  \nAlthough the specific disabilities of the proposed class members can vary, they \nshare  a  common  need  for  Medicaid  funded  home  and  community  based \nservices.  A class action is superior to individual lawsuits for resolving this \n9 \n \n\n \ncontroversy. \n \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nStatewide Medicaid Managed Care Long-Term Care Program  \n24.  Medicaid  is  a  joint  federal  and  state  program  that  covers  medical \nservices to low-income persons pursuant to Title XIX of the Social Security \nAct, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396-1396v. \n25.  States are not required to participate in Medicaid, but if they do, they \nmust  comply  with  the  requirements  of  Title  XIX  and  its  implementing \nregulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services.  \nStates which participate must submit to the federal government a state Medicaid \nplan that fulfills the requirements of Title XIX.  42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a). \n26.  One of the primary purposes of Medicaid is “to furnish … rehabilitation \nand  other  services  to  help  such  families  and  individuals  attain  or  retain \ncapability  for  independence  or  self-care  ….”    42  U.S.C.  § 1396-1.    Each \nparticipating  state’s  Medicaid  plan  must  contain  reasonable  standards  to \ndetermine the extent of services needed to obtain these objectives.  42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396a(a)(17).  \n27.  Coverage of certain services is mandatory under Title XIX, including \n10 \n \n\n \nnursing facility services.  42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i) (incorporating 42 \nU.S.C. § 1396d(a)(1)-(5), (17), (21)).   \n28.  Federal  Medicaid  law  allows  states  to  include  certain  home  and \ncommunity based services in their state Medicaid program plans, including \npersonal care services.  Such services are provided to all qualifying persons, \nwithout enrollment limits.  42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(xvii)(24).  Florida has opted \nnot to provide these services to older adults or adults with disabilities.  \n29.   In addition, Federal Medicaid law allows states to offer home and \ncommunity  based  waiver  programs  (Waiver  Programs).    These  Waiver \nPrograms are designed to enable people who are elderly or have disabilities, \nand otherwise need the level of care provided in a nursing facility or other \ninstitution, to receive long-term care services in the community.  42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396n(c).  The federal Medicaid program allows states to obtain waivers of \ncertain  program  requirements,  including  the  requirement  that  otherwise \nprohibits enrollment caps.  42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(3). \n30.   The purpose of waivers, like Florida’s Long-Term Care Waiver, is to \nprovide “an array of home and community-based services that an individual \nneeds to avoid institutionalization.”  42 C.F.R. § 441.300. \n31.  When  providing  long-term  care  services,  State  Medicaid  programs \n11 \n \n\n \nmust  comply  with  the  ADA.    The  ADA  prohibits  unnecessary \ninstitutionalization  or  segregation  of  persons  with  disabilities.    42  U.S.C. \n§ 12132.  A state’s obligations under the ADA are distinct from its obligations \nunder the Medicaid Act.   \n32.  Florida’s Medicaid program provides only a few options for adults who \nare disabled or elderly and need long-term care services:  nursing facility \nplacement, or home and community based services under the Long-Term Care \nWaiver.  In addition, six counties operate limited facility based long-term care \nday services under the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly. \n33.  Nursing facilities are institutional settings under the ADA. \n34.  On average, the cost of nursing facility placement is several times the \ncost of care provided in the home and community through the Long-Term Care \nWaiver.   \n35.  The Long-Term Care Waiver provides home and community based \nservices in various residential settings, including assisted living homes, adult \nfamily care homes, and in an individual’s own home or family member’s home. \n36.  The Long-Term Care Waiver covers a wide range of services critical to \nmaintaining  people  with  long-term  care  needs  in  their  homes  and  in  the \ncommunity.  These services include assisted living care, adult day health care, \n12 \n \n\n \nassistive care services, attendant nursing care, behavioral management, care \ncoordination,  home  accessibility  adaptation,  home  delivery  of  meals, \nhomemaker  services,  hospice,  nursing,  medical  equipment  and  supplies, \nmedication administration and management, personal care services, personal \nemergency  response  system,  respite,  skilled  therapies  and  non-emergency \ntransportation.  \n37.  In  December  2017,  the  federal  Centers  for  Medicare  &  Medicaid \nServices (CMS) approved Defendant ACHA’s application for the current Long-\nTerm Care Waiver program, authorizing it to continue for another five years. \n38.  In the waiver application, Defendant AHCA requested to limit the \nnumber of people getting services to 62,000 at any point in time, with no \nincrease in capacity over the five years of the approval period.   \n39.  States can obtain CMS approval to raise a waiver program’s enrollment \ncap to respond to increased demand. Some states do not cap enrollment in their \nlong-term care waiver program at all. \n40.  As of October 2018, there were 59,329 persons receiving home and \ncommunity based services through the Long-Term Care Waiver.  \n41.  The  Long-Term  Care  Waiver  has  absorbed  seven  other  waiver \nprograms that had been targeted to meet the needs of discrete populations.  The \n13 \n \n\n \nmost  recent  consolidation  in 2018  decommissioned three  waiver programs \ndedicated to meeting the needs of people with HIV, traumatic brain or spinal \ncord injuries, and Cystic Fibrosis — a total of 7,500 slots.  Of this number, a \nlittle over 1,700 people previously served were transitioned onto the Long-Term \nCare Waiver.   \n42.  The transition of people from the decommissioned waivers to the Long-\nTerm Care Waiver has increased the number of people served on the Long-\nTerm Care Waiver but has reduced the capacity of the system as a whole.  \nPeople newly seeking services that had been covered by the decommissioned \nwaivers now must join the lengthy waitlist for the Long-Term Care Waiver. \n43.  As of October 2018, there were 53,193 persons on Defendants’ waitlist \nfor the Long-Term Care Waiver. \n44.  The Long-Term Care Waiver is considered an Aged and Disabled \nwaiver by CMS.  According to Kaiser Family Foundation data, 31 states had no \nwaiting list at all for their Aged, Physically Disabled or Aged and Disabled \nwaivers (per 2016 data).   \n45.  The federal Medicaid Act does not allow waitlists for nursing facility \nservices. \n46.  Nursing facility occupancy rates in Florida are among the highest in the \n14 \n \n\n \ncountry. \nDefendants’ Waitlist Ranking Underestimates the Risk \nof Unnecessary Nursing Facility Placement \n \n47.  When Named Plaintiffs and proposed class members seek to enroll in \nthe Long-Term Care Waiver, they go through Defendants’ assessment process \nto purportedly determine their level of risk of nursing facility placement.   \n48.  Defendant DOEA contracts with the regional Aging and Disability \nResource Centers (ADRCs) to field requests and complete an assessment over \nthe telephone. \n49.  Once assessed, individuals are placed on the waitlist for Long-Term \nCare  Waiver  services,  called  the  Assessed  Prioritized  Consumer  List.  \nCompletion  of  the  assessment  results  in  each  individual  being  placed  by \nnumerical rank into one of five “priority levels” (levels 1-5):  the higher the \nlevel, the higher the assessed risk.  Fla. Admin. Code R. 59G-4.193(3). \n50.  There are additional levels of risk (levels 6-8) that DOEA ranks based \non specific statutory characteristics.  In October 2018, there were only 45 people \non the Long-Term Care Waiver waitlist in levels 6-8. \n51.  In addition, individuals in three statutory categories are authorized to \napply  directly  for  the  Long-Term  Care  Waiver,  without  any  additional \n15 \n \n\n \nassessment of risk:  individuals residing in a nursing facility for at least 60 days \nwho have requested to transition to their communities; children aged 18, 19 or \n20  with  medically  complex  care  needs;  and  persons  classified  by  Adult \nProtective Services as “high risk” and placed by the State in an assisted living \nfacility.  § 409.979 (3)(f), Fla. Stat. (2018).   \n52.  Other  than  these  three  special  statutory  categories,  Defendants’ \nassessment of risk governs when a person may move off of the waitlist.  \n53.  Levels  0-5  are  based  exclusively  on  the  results  of  an  assessment \nconducted over the telephone.  This assessment process asks applicants a series \nof questions from the 701S assessment tool.  Responses to certain questions are \nthen run through an algorithm, which determines the individual’s “score” and \npriority level.  Fla. Admin. Code R. 59G-4.193(3). \n54.  Certain important risk factors are not considered when assigning a \npriority level.  These include:  whether the survey was completed by someone \nelse (i.e., a proxy), memory loss, cognitive decline or dementia, the presence of \nParkinson’s Disease, full paralysis, previous nursing facility stay, the age of the \ncaregiver, financial strain on the caregiver, and history of falls.  While some of \nthese factors are captured in the assessment, the algorithm does not consider \nthem in assigning a risk score. \n16 \n \n\n \n55.  The  assessment  process  relies  heavily  on  voluntary  caregiver \ninvolvement but does not properly take into account a caregiver’s availability, \nability, and willingness to provide support. \n56.  The vast majority of people on the waitlist are over 60-years-old, and \nmore than half of them are over 74-years-old.  A quarter of the waitlist is \ncomprised of people 85 or older.   \n57.  Many people with dementia are on the wait list and are in need of \nservices.  42% of people at Level 3 have dementia or a cognitive impairment; \nat Level 4 that number rises to 51%, and at Level 5 it is 57%.  But the assessment \nprocess does not adequately factor in dementia or cognitive impairment.  The \nassessment  asks  about  medical  validation  of  cognitive  decline,  but  those \nquestions have no impact on the individual’s score or priority ranking on the \nwaitlist. \n58.  One in four caregivers of individuals at Level 3 priority have been \nfound by Defendant DOEA to be “in crisis,” and at Level 4 that number rises to \nmore than half.  Nonetheless, people assessed at these levels wait years on \naverage to get needed long-term care. \n59.  Defendants’  criteria  and  methods  of  administration  perpetuate  the \ninstitutionalization  and  segregation  of  people  with  disabilities  by \n17 \n \n\n \nunderestimating their risk of institutionalization and failing to administer the \nlong-term care system based on accurate assessments of need for long-term care \nservices in the community.   \nDefendants Do Not Move People Off of the Long-Term Care  \nWaiver Waitlist at a Reasonable Pace \n \n60.  Average wait times are long.  People with a Level 1 assessment wait on \naverage 42 months.  Other average wait times are 43 months for Level 2, 40 \nmonths for Level 3, and 30 months for Level 4.   \n61.  Only people at the highest level of assessed risk, Level 5, move off of \nthe waitlist within 3 months.  To achieve a Level 5 score, the person must \ndemonstrate a high level of need for long-term care, have highly inadequate \nunpaid support, and have a caregiver in crisis. \n62.  Between July 1, 2016, and March 8, 2018, over 1,400 people on the \nwaitlist had to move to nursing facilities.  In this same period, over 8,600 people \ndied while on the waitlist. \n63.  The Long-Term Care Waiver waitlist continues to grow.  In March \n2017, the waitlist had 42,195 people on it.  As of October 2018, there were over \n53,000 people on the waitlist – an increase of over 20%. \n64.  As the waitlist increases, the number of people at risk of unnecessary \n18 \n \n\n \ninstitutionalization grows as well. \n65.  Florida has  no  comprehensive,  effectively  working plan  (called  an \n“Olmstead Plan”) for providing long-term care to proposed class members so \nthey can remain in the most integrated setting in the community, rather than \nbeing forced into segregated, institutional settings by virtue of their care needs. \nDefendants Overly Rely on Nursing Facility Settings \n66.  The ADA requires that states administer their “services, programs, and \nactivities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified \nindividuals with disabilities.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d).  This requirement applies \nto state Medicaid programs.  \n67.  Despite  their  obligations  to  provide  individuals  with  disabilities \nservices in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs, Defendants \nhave allocated the vast majority of Florida’s Medicaid long-term care resources \nto nursing facility services. \n68.  Florida  ranks  near  the  bottom  in  the  nation  in  terms  of  Medicaid \nexpenditures for home and community based services for older adults and adults \nwith disabilities.  Only 22.5% of Medicaid expenditures for long-term care for \nthis population were for home and community based care in 2016.  This was \nless than half the national average of 45.2%.   \n19 \n \n\n \n69.  In 2016, Defendant AHCA’s Medicaid program spent four times as \nmuch on nursing facility care as it did on home and community based long-term \ncare for this population. \n70.  In addition, Florida has become further entrenched in its commitment \nto institutions by lifting the moratorium for new certificates of need to allow for \nthe building of new nursing facility beds.  Defendant AHCA has approved \nthousands of new nursing facility beds since the moratorium was lifted in 2015. \n71.  Defendant AHCA has an incentive program within the long-term care \nsystem that provides fiscal rewards to managed care entities who transition \npeople out of nursing facilities and into the Long-Term Care Waiver.  There is \nno similar incentive program to bring people into the Long-Term Care Waiver \nfrom the waitlist.  The result is an incentive to move into a nursing facility: a \nperson seeking services at home or in the community can bypass the long \nwaitlist  only  by  first  submitting  to  at  least  60  consecutive  days  of \ninstitutionalization in a nursing facility. \n72.  Transitioning out of a nursing facility placement is difficult for low-\nincome people.  Once Medicaid-eligible individuals are admitted to nursing \nfacilities, they must turn over most of their income, including Social Security \nbenefits, to the state and nursing facility, except for a small monthly personal \n20 \n \n\n \nneeds allowance. \n73.  As  a  result,  nursing  facility  residents  are  often  unable  to  continue \npaying rent or mortgages and accordingly may lose the home they had before \nentering the nursing facility.   \n74.  Defendants  administer  their  Medicaid  long-term  care  system  in  a \ndiscriminatory manner that perpetuates the institutionalization and segregation \nof  persons  with  disabilities,  over  relies  on  nursing  facility  services  and \nunderfunding community based care, and fails to provide sufficient alternative \nMedicaid funded long-term care services in the community.   \nNAMED PLAINTIFFS’ ALLEGATIONS \nBenjamin Alexander \n75.  Mr. Alexander is a Medicaid beneficiary who requested Long-Term \nCare Waiver services in early 2018, but was placed on the waitlist.  \n76.  Mr. Alexander became disabled as a result of back surgery he had three \nyears ago that left him paralyzed.  At first quadriplegic, Mr. Alexander was able \nto regain most movement in his upper body.  However, his left hand does not \nopen completely.   He is paralyzed from the waist down, has uncontrolled \nmuscle spasms, abdominal pain, severe constipation, and is incontinent.   \n77.  Mr. Alexander has been treated in a hospital approximately ten times \n21 \n \n\n \nin  the  past  year  due  to  his  ongoing  muscle  spasms,  abdominal  pain,  and \nconstipation. \n78.  Mr. Alexander lives with his 92-year-old mother in her home and relies \non her and a former neighbor to help him.  He cannot bathe, maintain hygiene, \nor perform incontinence care without assistance.  He cannot keep his home \nclean and safe without help.  Neither Mr. Alexander nor his mother are licensed \nto drive and they must rely on others to help with shopping.  They also rely on \nthe Meal on Wheels program, which comes once per day.  \n79.  Mr.  Alexander’s  mother  is  elderly  with  her  own  physical  health \nproblems including unsteadiness.  She has great difficulty meeting her son’s \nphysical care needs.  When his legs seize up on him, she cannot assist him in \ngetting dressed or attend to his incontinence.  When he needs to move to his \nwheelchair, she struggles to lift him and help him transfer.  She is not confident \nshe has the ability to provide the care he needs. \n80.  The home Mr. Alexander lives in is not accessible to him.  There is no \nshower that he can maneuver into and his mother cannot lift him into the tub, \nso she gives him a sponge bath in his chair or on his bed.  Mr. Alexander rotates \nhimself every two hours with great difficulty because he does not have a bed or \nmattress that will adjust and assist with the prevention of skin breakdown. \n22 \n \n\n \n81.  Defendants recently assessed Mr. Alexander and ranked him at Level 3 \non the waitlist. \n82.  Defendants’ ranking failed to take into account his elderly mother’s \ndifficulty in lifting and maneuvering him to provide personal care.  When his \nmother is unable to provide care, he must rely on the kindness of a former \nneighbor who travels to his home to provide the care for him.  His ranking also \ndid not weigh the financial strain on his caregiver, his numerous emergency \nroom visits in the last year, or the total number of activities of daily living where \nhe needs assistance. \n83.  Mr. Alexander wants to remain living with his mother, but he is at risk \nof unnecessary nursing facility entry.  He cannot independently care for himself \nand his 92-year-old mother cannot do so either, which leaves Mr. Alexander \nfurther dependent upon the uncertainty of his former neighbor’s willingness to \nassist with his care needs.  Without his mother and his former neighbor’s help, \nhe would have to enter a nursing facility. \nGeorge Collier \n86.  Mr. Collier requested Long-Term Care Waiver services in 2015, but \nwas placed on the waitlist.  He currently lives in an assisted living home. \n87.  Mr.  Collier  has  numerous  health  conditions  including  dementia, \n23 \n \n\n \ndiabetes,  and  blindness.    He  cannot  take  medications  by  himself,  and  his \ndiabetes has been uncontrolled at times.  He was found unresponsive on the \nfloor in the last year.  He cannot use the telephone, shop and prepare meals, \nmanage money  or his medications,  or go out into the community without \nassistance.  He uses a walker to ambulate. \n88.  Mr. Collier is happy in his assisted living home, where he sings karaoke \nand enjoys dancing.  He likes to go to the grocery store to buy his food, but \nneeds total assistance.  His daughter-in-law says that putting him in a nursing \nfacility, “would be like putting him in a coffin.” \n89.  Mr.  Collier’s  assisted  living  home  helps  him  with  medication \nmanagement and meal preparation including preparing his plate and cutting his \nfood due to Mr. Collier’s blindness.  He also needs but is not receiving stand-\nby assistance with showering due to his unsteadiness, and assistance with \ndressing. \n90.  He is frequently dizzy and has had numerous falls in the last year, six \nof them requiring ambulance services.  Most recently, Mr. Collier went to the \nemergency room for dementia and undiagnosed weakness. \n91.  Mr. Collier has unmet care needs because he does not have the money \nto cover the cost of needed services.  These unmet needs place him at increased \n24 \n \n\n \nrisk of falls and wounds or infections.  For example, his unsteadiness in the \nshower leaves him at risk of more falls and hospitalizations.  He needs close \nmonitoring of his blood glucoses to prevent further dizziness and falls. \n92.  Defendants assessed and ranked Mr. Collier at Level 3 on the waitlist. \n93.  The Defendants’ ranking does not take into consideration the financial \nstrain on Mr. Collier’s son.  Though he continues to strive to pay the difference \nfor Mr. Collier’s assisted living facility, he also continues to pay additional \nhealth care costs for Mr. Collier such as dental care when Mr. Collier broke a \ntooth due to one of his falls.  In addition, his ranking did not take into account \nhis dementia or his history of falls. \n94.  Mr. Collier is at risk of unnecessary nursing facility entry.  Mr. Collier \nwants to remain in his home, so his son has been paying the difference between \nMr. Collier’s limited income and the cost of care and rent.  His son cannot \nsustain the $1,900 cost per month.  Without the services provided at his assisted \nliving home, Mr. Collier would have to enter a nursing facility. \nRaimundo Leal \n95.  Raimundo Leal requested Long-Term Care Waiver Services in 2011 \nbut was placed on the waitlist.   \n96.  Mr. Leal resides in a subsidized apartment and relies on occasional \n25 \n \n\n \nassistance from neighbors or self-paid care for homemaking and other chores.  \nIf his apartment is not maintained, he risks being in violation of his lease and \nevicted. \n97.  Mr. Leal is engaged with his family and community.  His brother \ncomes  to  visit  him  each  week,  and  his  son  and  grandchildren  provide \ncompanionship and help him to go to the grocery store. \n98.  Mr.  Leal  has  insulin-dependent  diabetes,  chronic  obstructive \npulmonary disease, and is subject to falls.  He also has rheumatoid arthritis.  His \nmemory is sometimes poor. \n99.  Mr.  Leal  cannot  bathe  and  dress  himself  without  assistance,  and \nsometimes he cannot ambulate without help.  He has difficulty managing his \nmedications. \n100.  Mr. Leal has had several hospitalizations due to falls and has recently \nprogressed from just using oxygen to now having a tracheostomy. \n101.  Mr. Leal first requested Long-Term Care Waiver services in July \n2011, where Defendants ranked him at Level 3.  He was placed on the wait list. \n102.  Since his initial request, Mr. Leal has been assessed numerous times.  \nIn June 2017, Mr. Leal’s health deteriorated and he requested a reassessment.  \nDefendants ranked him at Level 4.  The assessment noted that he is a frequent \n26 \n \n\n \nfall risk.  He needs daily help, but he rarely has assistance.  Different friends \nfrom his community will pitch in or help when they can.  He remained on the \nwaitlist. \n103.  In October of 2017, Mr. Leal needed more help at home and was \nreassessed again.  Defendants ranked him at Level 3, although he still was a fall \nrisk and needed assistance.  He remained on the waitlist.  Mr. Leal was last \nreassessed in May of 2018 and is now ranked Level 2. \n104.  Mr.  Leal  falls  frequently,  often  due  to  respiratory  distress  and \nresulting in multiple hospitalizations.  He usually does not recall the events \nleading up to his falls and, without regular assistance in his home, has been \nlucky to have been found by neighbors or family.   Mr. Leal was recently \nhospitalized again in August 2018, and required a tracheostomy to address \noxygen deficiency.  He was later admitted to a subacute care hospital for \ncontinued care and has remained there with a discharge order for a skilled \nnursing facility since September 2018. \n105.  Mr. Leal, however, does not want to be admitted to a skilled nursing \nfacility  and  wishes  to  be  discharged  home  with  Long-Term  Care  Waiver \nServices.  Discharge home without services or a caregiver in the home is against \nmedical advice. \n27 \n \n\n \n106.  Mr. Leal is at risk of unnecessary nursing facility entry.  He would be \nable  to  continue  to  live  independently  near  his  brother,  children,  and \ngrandchildren with the assistance of the Long-Term Care Waiver services.  \nWithout those supports and services, Mr. Leal would have to enter a nursing \nfacility. \nJefferson Langlaise \n107.  Jefferson Langlaise requested Long-Term Care Waiver services in \n2017, but was placed on the waitlist. \n108.  Mr. Langlaise has a seizure disorder with generalized seizures that \noccur several times a week.  He also has co-occurring mental health conditions, \ndizziness, high blood pressure and high cholesterol.  He is unable to work due \nto  his  disabilities  and  needs  assistance  with  walking,  mobility,  bathing, \nmedication management, shopping, meal preparation and chores. \n109.  Mr. Langlaise lives in an assisted living home, but his income is not \nenough  to  pay  the  cost.    His  mother,  his  primary  support,  is  paying  the \nremainder of his rent and expenses.  She is nearing retirement age, has another \nadult child with a disability at home, and cannot continue to sustain the cost of \npaying the difference. \n110.  Defendants assessed and ranked Mr. Langlaise at a Level 2 on the \n28 \n \n\n \nwaitlist. \n111.  Defendants’ ranking did not take into account the financial strain his \nmother is under to sustain the care he receives from the assisted living home. \n112.  Mr. Langlaise is at risk of unnecessary nursing facility entry because \nhis Social Security income is not enough to cover the cost of his assisted living \nhome.  His mother is privately paying for the remainder of his rent, medications, \nincidental expenses, and transportation.  His mother is unsure how she will \ncontinue to support Mr. Langlaise.  She has limited years left to work herself \nplus cares for her older son with disabilities living with her.  Without the care \nthat she pays for, Mr. Lainglaise would need to enter a nursing facility. \nCelia Lopez \n \n86.  Ms. Lopez requested Long-Term Care Waiver services in November \n2014 but was placed on the waitlist \n87.  Ms.  Lopez  lives  with  her  granddaughter  and  her  granddaughter’s \nfamily. \n88.  Ms. Lopez cannot perform necessary incontinence care, bathe herself, \ndress herself or eat without assistance.  She needs help with mobility and is at \nrisk for serious injury from falls.  She needs assistance to access the community \naround her, and would enjoy doing so.  \n29 \n \n\n \n89.  Ms. Lopez’s family is committed to helping her live at home with them.  \nHowever,  she  needs  help  all  day,  every  day,  particularly  because  of  her \nadvanced dementia.  She cannot speak words anymore.  \n90.  Ms. Lopez is helped each day and each night by caregivers paid for by \nher grandchildren.  However, this arrangement is not sustainable financially.  \nMoreover, because of the cost, Ms. Lopez does not have sufficient services to \naccess the world outside of her granddaughter’s home. \n91.  Defendants recently assessed Ms. Lopez and ranked her a Level 1 on \nthe waitlist. \n92.  The Defendants’ ranking does not reflect Ms. Lopez’s dementia and \nneed for supervision to prevent wandering.  Nor does the ranking take into \nconsideration the financial strain the cost of her care puts on her grandchildren.  \nThey cannot sustain the continued cost and, without the care they pay for, Ms. \nLopez would have to enter a nursing facility. \nGeraldine Davenport \n93.  Ms. Davenport requested Long-Term Care Waiver services in March \n2013 but was put on the waitlist.   \n94.  At that time, Ms. Davenport was living with her daughter who sought \nservices for her mother because her mother had dementia and did not have much \n30 \n \n\n \nmoney  \n95.  While  waiting  for  services  and  living  with  her  daughter,  Ms. \nDavenport was without a caretaker while her daughter was at work.  Her \nconfusion led to episodes of risky behavior, including taking all her medications \nat once, putting paper plates in the toaster oven, forgetting if she ate food, and \neating multiple lunches. \n96.  In  late  December  2017,  Ms.  Davenport  experienced  severe  back \npain—she had fractured her eleventh vertebrae.  Although she had a large bruise \non her back, she did not remember falling.  She was hospitalized and then \nreleased to a rehabilitation facility.  She could not return home because her \ndaughter worked during the day and there was no caretaker or services to \nprovide  the  support  Ms.  Davenport  required.    After  rehabilitation,  Ms. \nDavenport moved to an assisted living home in January 2018.  \n97.  Ms.  Davenport  meets  the  qualifications  for  the  Long-Term  Care \nWaiver.  She needs assistance with bathing, transferring, as well as walking and \nmobility.  She cannot manage her own money, prepare meals, shop, or do \nchores.    She  cannot  use  the  telephone,  manage  her  medications,  and  use \ntransportation without assistance. \n98.  Ms.  Davenport  experiences  bouts  of  depression  and  requires  the \n31 \n \n\n \nrelaxed and quiet environment that she now has at her assisted living home.  She \nhas visited nursing facilities in the past and found the setting to be depressing. \n99.  In January 2018, the Defendants ranked Ms. Davenport at Level 2 on \nthe waitlist. \n100.  Her risk assessment score did not take into consideration her dementia \nor memory loss, the fact that she was in a rehabilitation facility, or her history \nof falls. \n101.  Ms. Davenport wants to remain in the community.  She is at risk of \nunnecessary nursing facility entry because she cannot afford the cost of the \nassisted living home where she lives.  Without the services provided by the \nassisted living home, Ms. Davenport would have to enter a nursing facility. \n \nCLAIM FOR RELIEF  \nAMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT \n102.  Paragraphs 1 through 101 are incorporated by reference. \n103.  Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act provides that, “no \nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of disability, be excluded \nfrom participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or \nactivities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by  any such \n32 \n \n\n \nentity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132. \n104.  Each Named Plaintiff and proposed class member is a “qualified \nindividual with a disability” within the meaning of the ADA in that they: (1) \nhave a physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life \nactivities; and (2) meet the essential eligibility requirements for long-term care \nunder Florida’s Medicaid program. \n105.  Defendants are public agency directors responsible for operation of a \npublic entity, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131(1)(A) & (B). \n106.  Title II of the ADA requires that public entities “administer services, \nprograms, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs \nof qualified individuals with disabilities.”  See 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d). \n107.  Defendants violate the integration mandate of the ADA by failing to \nprovide needed home and community based services to Named Plaintiffs and \nproposed  class  members,  placing  them  at  risk  of  unnecessary \ninstitutionalization or segregation. \n108.  The ADA further prohibits a state from utilizing, “criteria or other \nmethods  of  administration  [t]hat  have  the  effect  of  subjecting  qualified \nindividuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis of disability.”  See \n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3)(i).  This includes methods of administration that, \n33 \n \n\n \n“have  the  purpose  or  effect  of  defeating  or  substantially  impairing \naccomplishment of objectives of the public entity’s program with respect to \nindividuals with disabilities.”  Id. § 35.130(b)(3)(ii). \n109.  Defendants’ criteria and methods of administering the Long-Term \nCare  Waiver  subject  Named  Plaintiffs  and  proposed  class  members  to \ndiscrimination by:  (1) using  a system  of  assessment  and  prioritization  that \nunderestimates  risk of  institutionalization  and places individuals  at  risk  of \nunnecessary institutionalization; and (2) funding Medicaid Long-Term Care \nservices with a bias toward institutional care. \n110.  Defendants’ unlawful discrimination against Named Plaintiffs and \nproposed class members violates Title II of the ADA. \n \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \n     WHEREFORE,  Named  Plaintiffs  and  proposed  class  members \nrespectfully request that this Court: \na.  Certify this action as a class action and appoint individual Named \nPlaintiffs as class representatives; \n34 \n \n\n \nb.  Declare that Defendants’ failure to provide Named Plaintiffs and \nproposed class members with needed home and community based services \nviolates Title II of the ADA; \nc.  Enter a permanent injunction requiring Defendants to comply \nwith the ADA, to include at a minimum: \ni.   the  provision  of  Medicaid-funded  home  and \ncommunity based services required by Named Plaintiffs \nand  the  proposed  class  members  to  avoid  or  prevent \nunnecessary institutionalization and to avoid segregation; \nii.   notification to Named Plaintiffs and proposed class \nmembers of the availability of home and community-\nbased alternatives to nursing facility or other institutional \ncare and how to access those alternatives; and  \niii.   development of a valid and reliable assessment tool \nfor risk of nursing facility.  \nd.  Require Defendants to publicly report on a quarterly basis on the \nprogress of compliance;  \n35 \n \n\n \ne.  Retain jurisdiction over this case until Defendants have come into \ncompliance with the ADA as applied to Named Plaintiffs and proposed class \nmembers;  \nf.  Award  Plaintiffs  their  reasonable  attorneys’  fees,  litigation \nexpenses, and costs; and \ng.  Grant such other relief as this Court deems just and proper. \n \nDated:  December 12, 2018  Respectfully submitted, \n \n \n/s/ Amanda Heystek \nAMANDA HEYSTEK, Fla.

CASE NO.  4:18cv569-RH-MJF \n \nMARY MAYHEW et al., \n \n    Defendants. \n \n______________________________/ \n \n \nORDER GRANTING THE DEFENDANTS’ SECOND \nSUMMARY-JUDGMENT MOTION IN PART \n \n \nThe plaintiffs are adults with physical disabilities or limitations. They need \nservices that could be provided in a long-term-care facility—a nursing home—but \nthey live and prefer to continue to live in the community. They allege they are \neligible for home and community-based services through the State of Florida’s \nMedicaid long-term-care waiver program. But they are on the program’s waitlist; \nthey are not currently receiving waiver services. The plaintiffs say this puts them at \nrisk of unnecessary institutionalization, violating the state’s duty under the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, as interpreted in Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, \n527 U.S. 581 (1999). That decision requires a state to provide needed services in \n \nCase No. 4:18cv569-RH-MJF\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00569-RH-MJF   Document 131   Filed 03/31/20   Page 2 of 3\n \nPage 2 of 3\n \nthe community, not in a nursing home, when this can be done without \nfundamentally altering a state’s programs. The defendants are the Secretaries of the \nFlorida Agency for Health Care Administration and the Florida Department of \nElder Affairs, the agencies that administer the waiver program. \nThe plaintiffs have attempted to assert claims not only for themselves but for \na proposed class. The order of October 27, 2019 denied the plaintiffs’ first motion \nto certify a class. This led the defendants to file a summary-judgment motion—\ntheir second—asserting the plaintiffs can recover only individual relief, not \nclasswide relief. The plaintiffs filed a second motion to certify a class, but a \nseparate order that will be issued contemporaneously with this one denies the \nsecond motion to certify a class. Only the plaintiffs’ individual claims will go \nforward.  \nThe plaintiffs have standing to assert only their own claims and to obtain \nonly appropriate relief on their own claims. This order makes no ruling on the \nscope of relief available on the plaintiffs’ own claims. But the defendants are \ncorrect: in the absence of a certified class, the plaintiffs have no standing to assert \nthe rights of individuals whose only involvement in this case was as proposed class \nmembers. Whether labeled a motion for summary judgment or to dismiss, the \nresult is the same: the plaintiffs cannot pursue a claim for relief on behalf of others. \nAccordingly,  \n \nCase No. 4:18cv569-RH-MJF\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00569-RH-MJF   Document 131   Filed 03/31/20   Page 3 of 3\n \nPage 3 of 3\n \n  IT IS ORDERED: \n  The defendants’ second summary-judgment motion, ECF No. 98, is granted \nin part. Any claims for relief on behalf of individuals who are not named plaintiffs \nare dismissed. I do not direct the entry of judgment under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 54(b).   \n  SO ORDERED on March 31, 2020.     \n            s/Robert L. Hinkle        \n          United States District Judge \n \n \nCase No. 4:18cv569-RH-MJF",
