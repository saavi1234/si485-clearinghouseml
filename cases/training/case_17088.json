The shelter, represented by Alliance Defending Freedom, sued the Municipality of Anchorage and the Anchorage Equal Rights Commission for violating the organization’s First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.  It alleged that Anchorage, acting in bad faith, had engaged in irrelevant, harassing, and overreaching investigations of the shelter, baselessly accusing the shelter of fair housing law violations and sex and gender identity discrimination.</p><p>On November 1, 2018, the shelter sought a preliminary injunction prohibiting Anchorage from applying the city’s non-discrimination ordinance in a manner that violated the shelter’s First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, or its rights under Article 1 of the Alaska Constitution.  The shelter alleged that as a homeless shelter, it was exempted from the non-discrimination ordinance by the explicit terms of the ordinance.  The court granted the preliminary injunction on August 9, 2019. 406 F.Supp.3d 776.</p><p>The following month, the parties presented a proposed consent decree to the court.  Anchorage agreed not to enforce the non-discrimination ordinance against the shelter’s overnight living space policies, allowing the shelter to keep its overnight housing open only to persons who were determined to be female at birth.  Anchorage also agreed to pay the shelter $1 in damages and $100,000 in attorneys’ fees and costs.  </p><p>The court issued the consent decree on October 2, 2019.</p>",

This challenge seeks to protect the right of a faith-based homeless shelter to \nexercise its religious beliefs and to speak about those beliefs so that it can help homeless and \nhurting women in downtown Anchorage.   \n2.  The Downtown Soup Kitchen d/b/a Downtown Hope Center (“Hope Center”) is a \nprivate, faith-based, non-profit organization that offers free religious teaching, food, and safe \nshelter to a limited number of homeless women who must first satisfy certain requirements, and \nmany of whom have been abused by men and want to escape sex-trafficking.  \n3.  The Hope Center’s motto is “Hope Restored • Hearts Renewed • Lives \nTransformed.”  \n4.  But Anchorage1 is interpreting its laws to force the Hope Center to admit men into \nits women’s shelter and to stay silent about the differences between men and women.  \n5.  That violates Anchorage’s own laws and the Constitution. \n6.  The practical result of this enforcement would be not only to force a religious \nministry to abandon its mission and message but also to force homeless women to sleep \nalongside and interact with men in intimate settings—even though those women may have just \nbeen beaten, raped, and sexually assaulted by a man the day before.  \n7.  Anchorage is doing all this under the guise of its public accommodation and fair \nhousing law, Anchorage Municipal Code, Title 5, § 5.20.050 and § 5.20.020.  \n8.  The former makes it illegal for public accommodations to: \n  “deny” “accommodations” and “services” on the basis of sex or gender identity; \n \n  “[p]ublish, circulate, issue, display, post or mail a written or printed \ncommunication, notice or advertisement” that “states or implies” that any of its \n                                                 \n1 The term “Anchorage” refers to all Defendants unless context indicates otherwise. \n2 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 2 of 54\n\naccommodations would be “refused” or “withheld” to a person based on their sex \nor gender identity; and \n \n  publish a statement that “states or implies” that a person’s “patronage or \npresence” belonging to a particular sex or gender identity would be “unwelcome, \nnot desired, not solicited, objectionable or unacceptable.” \n \n9.  And the latter makes it illegal for owners, lessors, managers, or agents to: \n  “[c]irculate, issue or display, make, print or publish, or cause to be made or \ndisplayed, printed or published, any communication, sign, notice, statement or \nadvertisement with respect to the use, sale, lease or rental of real property that \nindicates any preference, limitation, specification or discrimination based on” sex \nor gender identity. \n \n10.  But the Hope Center is not a public accommodation, either under the law or under \nthe specific exemption found in the code. See § 5.25.030(A)(9) (This chapter “shall not apply \nto…shelters for the homeless.”); and see § 5.20.020(A) (“With the exception of those conditions \ndescribed in section 5.25.030A, as ‘lawful practices’, it is unlawful…”). \n11.  And the Hope Center is not selling or leasing any real property. It is helping the \nhomeless free of charge.  \n12.  Nevertheless, Anchorage is currently investigating the Hope Center for violating \nits law in January 2018 when the Hope Center directed someone away from its women’s shelter \nto a hospital—even paying for transportation—because that individual was injured, inebriated, \nand past check-in time for the shelter.  \n13.  So that action was based on intoxication and late arrival, not any protected \ncategory. In fact, the Hope Center has never once turned anyone away from its shelter on the \nbasis of gender identity. \n14.  The individual who sought access in January 2018 nonetheless filed a complaint \nwith the Anchorage Equal Rights Commission (“Commission”), accusing the Hope Center of \n3 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 3 of 54\n\ndiscriminating on the basis of sex and gender identity, despite clear evidence of the non-\ndiscriminatory basis for that denial. \n15.  Although the Hope Center clearly did not violate the code, the Commission’s \nExecutive Director did not dismiss the complaint early on but continues to harass the Center \nthrough a now nearly 6 month “investigation.” \n16.  And during that investigation, the Executive Director initiated another complaint \nagainst the Hope Center, and this time included Brena, Bell & Clarkson—the law firm for \nHope Center’s then attorney. In this complaint, the Director accused the Hope Center and its \nattorney of violating the public accommodation and fair housing law because the attorney \ndiscussed the first complaint against the Hope Center with news reporters who asked about a \nlocal referendum that would decide if biological men could access opposite-sex restrooms.   \n17.  By pursuing this frivolous claim, Anchorage forced the Hope Center to obtain \nnew counsel. \n18.  Meanwhile, the Hope Center filed motions challenging the Commission’s \njurisdiction in both of the complaints brought against it—the first motion brought nearly 4 \nmonths ago. Yet the Commission has still refused to rule on those motions or issue a \ndetermination of no substantial evidence. Instead, the Commission is continuing to engage in \nirrelevant, overreaching, and harassing discovery. \n19.  As these events prove, Anchorage is not interested in investigating a past \nviolation of its law; it is harassing the Hope Center in bad faith, pressuring the Hope Center to \nchange its policy and to stay silent when the Hope Center has done nothing illegal.  \n20.  These investigations prove that Anchorage is using its law—a law which contains \nan express exemption for homeless shelters—and will continue to use this law in the future to \n4 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 4 of 54\n\nforce the Hope Center to change its faith-based policies, to allow biological men into its \nwomen’s shelter, and to stay silent about its religious beliefs.   \n21.  To stop this imminent irreparable harm, the Hope Center asks this Court to enjoin \nfuture enforcement of parts of the Anchorage Municipal Code and to declare specific sections \nunconstitutional, so that the Hope Center may freely speak its beliefs, freely exercise its faith, \nand freely serve hurting women who deserve a safe place to sleep in Anchorage.2  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n22.  This civil rights action raises federal questions under the United States \nConstitution, particularly the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and the Civil Rights Act of \n1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n23.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and \n1343.  \n24.  This Court has supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1367. \n25.  This Court has authority to issue the requested declaratory relief pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 57; the requested injunctive relief \nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1343 and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65; the requested damages under 28 \nU.S.C. § 1343; and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. § 1988.  \n26.  Venue lies in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because all events \ngiving rise to the claims detailed here occurred within the District of Alaska and the Defendants \nreside in the District of Alaska. \n \n                                                 \n2 The Hope Center is not, at this time, challenging the current investigations against the Hope \nCenter and its attorney, but may move to amend if that challenge becomes necessary.  \n5 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 5 of 54\n\nPLAINTIFF \n27.  Plaintiff The Downtown Soup Kitchen a/k/a Downtown Hope Center is a non-\nprofit, religious entity organized under the laws of the State of Alaska, with a principal place of \nbusiness at 240 E. 3rd Avenue, Anchorage, Alaska 99501. \nDEFENDANTS \n28.  The Municipality of Anchorage (“Anchorage”) is a home rule municipality \norganized under the laws of the State of Alaska, and is subject to suit under AS 29.35.010 and \nthe common law. \n29.  The Anchorage Equal Rights Commission (“the Commission”) is an \nadministrative agency within the Municipality of Anchorage.  \n30.  Pamela Basler (“Basler”) is a citizen of Alaska and the Executive Director of the \nCommission. Her authority is delegated to her by the Commission.  \n31.  Basler is sued individually, and in her official capacity as Executive Director of \nthe Commission.  \n32.  All actions taken by Anchorage officials in this complaint were taken on behalf \nof, with the authority of, and to act on behalf of Anchorage.  \n33.  Anchorage approved of, acquiesced in, and/or supported the actions of the \nAnchorage Equal Rights Commission. \n34.  All actions taken by Defendants, including the violations of the Hope Center’s \nconstitutional rights, were the result of a policy, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially \nadopted and promulgated by Defendants and/or their officers and were actions also taken under \ncolor of law by policy and/or decision makers. \n   \n6 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 6 of 54\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nThe Hope Center’s History \n35.  The Hope Center was prompted by the vision of a few Anchorage church leaders \nwho wanted to share God’s love with Anchorage's homeless.  \n36.  Formed over thirty years ago, the Hope Center provides food and showers to \nhomeless individuals in the downtown Anchorage area and provides shelter to homeless \nwomen, many of whom have been abused or battered by men.  \n37.  Operating out of a little red house on Fourth Avenue in downtown Anchorage, \nthe Hope Center initially provided nearly 300 free cups of soup each day to homeless and \nlow-income families.  \n38.  It also offered free showers and free clothing handouts from a yellow A-frame \nlocated next door. \n39.  In 2012, the Hope Center moved into its new facility on Third Avenue in \ndowntown Anchorage.  \n40.  The Hope Center later expanded its mission to include assisting the Brother \nFrancis Shelter (the “Francis Shelter”), a program of Catholic Social Services that provides free \nemergency shelter for individuals in Anchorage who are without a home.  \n41.  The Francis Shelter often had to shelter more homeless individuals than its \nfacilities could accommodate and faced the challenge of trying to provide a safe shelter \nenvironment for homeless women, many of whom had been abused or battered by men on the \nstreets or otherwise.  \n42.  The Francis Shelter and the Hope Center therefore agreed that the Hope Center \nwould assist the Francis Shelter by taking in and providing safe shelter to the Francis Shelter’s \n7 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 7 of 54\n\noverflow of homeless women who presented themselves at and who otherwise qualified for \nshelter at the Francis Shelter.  \n43.  Originally, the Francis Shelter checked individuals in and then the Hope Center \nwould transport the overflow of women from the Francis Shelter to the Hope Center.  \n44.  But the Anchorage homeless community eventually learned of the Hope Center’s \n“shelter” and began appearing at Hope Center directly.  \n45.  For its shelter, the Hope Center now accepts both an overflow of homeless \nwomen from the Francis Shelter, as well as some homeless women who either appear at or are \nreferred to the Hope Center directly.  \n46.  The Hope Center can provide shelter to fifty homeless women at any given time. \n47.  Of the women the Hope Center provides shelter to, most of these women have \nbeen abused or battered or escaped from sex trafficking.  \n48.  Because of its limited space and its religious mission, the Hope Center shelter \nonly accepts biological women to protect the physical, psychological, and emotional safety of the \nwomen seeking refuge from abuse, primarily from men.  \n49.  The Hope Center also gives priority to the elderly and disabled.  \n50.  To gain entry, the Hope Center shelter guests must first check in and meet many \nconditions.  \nThe Hope Center’s Religious Beliefs \n51.  The Hope Center is a faith-based, non-profit organization. \n52.  The Hope Center’s mission statement is “[i]nspired by the love of Jesus, we offer \nthose in need support, shelter, sustenance, and skills to transform their lives.”  \n8 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 8 of 54\n\n53.  The Hope Center does this both through acts of service and through the \ninculcation of Christian beliefs and values.  \n54.  The Hope Center believes that Jesus’ transforming love can free people of \ndestructive situations, habits, and addictions.  \n55.  The Hope Center believes that the Bible teaches that God creates people male or \nfemale. \n56.  The Hope Center believes that a person’s sex (whether male or female) is an \nimmutable God-given gift and that it is wrong for a person to deny his or her God-given sex. \n57.  The Hope Center believes that women should be cherished, respected, and \nprotected. \n58.  The Hope Center’s sincerely held religious belief is that it should convey and \npromote messages about God’s creation of each unique individual, whether male or female, and \nthat it should not convey conflicting messages. \n59.  The Hope Center’s sincerely held religious belief is that it should be loving, \nupfront, and honest in its interactions with others. \n60.  It would not only be dangerous and against common sense, but it would violate \nthe Hope Center’s sincerely held religious beliefs to admit biological men into its shelter and \nallow them to sleep side by side and disrobe next to women, some of whom have been assaulted \nby men and fear for their safety. \n61.  The Hope Center’s sincerely held religious belief is that it should care for women \nwho lack shelter. \n62.  The Hope Center’s sincerely held religious belief is that those providing shelter to \nhomeless women play a critical role in their understanding of God’s design for them. \n9 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 9 of 54\n\n63.  The Hope Center believes that an environment allowing a biological male to sleep \nwith and disrobe next to abused and battered females is not as ideal as an environment that \nallows those females to sleep in a room with members of the same biological sex. \n64.  To be true to its beliefs, teaching, mission, and values, the Hope Center must \nabide by its Christian beliefs in how it operates, including in what it teaches and how it treats \nothers.  \nThe Hope Center’s Operations \n65.  The Hope Center’s purpose is religious.  \n66.  Inspired by the love of Jesus, the Hope Center fulfills its religious mission in \nserving and teaching the poor. \n67.  The Hope Center guests must be willing to be exposed to Christian teachings and \nnot disrupt meetings inculcating Christian values.  \n68.  The Hope Center guests are offered Christian counseling, teaching, and advice \nprovided by staff and leaders associated with the Hope Center. \n69.  These activities include, but are not limited to, group prayer before meals, Bible \nstudies, group devotions, Christian music and television, signs and decor with Christian \nmessages, teachings, and symbols.  \n70.  The Hope Center hopes that by loving, serving, and teaching the homeless, \nhurting, and poor, the Hope Center encourages those it serves to put their faith in Jesus and free \nthemselves from destructive addictions and habits. \n71.  While not currently posted, the Hope Center desires to post, publish, or circulate \nits admittance policy or a portion thereof not only for clarity, but for peace of mind to those \n10 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 10 of 54\n\nseeking refuge from the harsh conditions of homeless life and also so that it can fulfill its \nreligious desire to be upfront and honest with those seeking access to the shelter.  \n72.  According to that policy, the Hope Center shelter guests must be biological \nfemales, at least 18 years of age, not demonstrate dangerous behavior, be clean and sober, be \nexposed to or attend prayer meetings and devotionals, be able to meet their personal needs \nwithout assistance, and must respect shelter guidelines.  \n73.  No Hope Center policy prohibits biological women who identify as men from \naccessing the shelter. \n74.  In fact, the Hope Center has allowed and is currently allowing biological women \nwho identify as men to access its shelter.  \n75.  Shelter guidelines at the Hope Center also include prohibitions against smoking, \nfighting, foul language, and wandering, as certain areas of the facility are off limits.  \n76.  In addition, all shelter guests at the Hope Center must sign up for a chore, assist \nwith clean-up at the facility, and adhere to a schedule.  \n77.  No shelter guest at the Hope Center is allowed to stay in the shelter without \ncomplying with its procedures.  \n78.  The Hope Center has one large open room in which it provides dinner to the \nhomeless women.  \n79.  After dinner, the homeless women who have signed up and qualify are permitted \nto stay the night, based upon space availability and priority of sign-up time and satisfaction of \nthe shelters conditions and guidelines.  \n11 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 11 of 54\n\n80.  Those who stay for the night at the Hope Center are given mats, along with a bag \nof blankets and a sheet, so that they can sleep on the floor in the one large open room where \nwomen sometimes change or are in various states of undress. \n81.  Showers and laundry are also provided to those who have signed up and qualified \nto stay the night, and breakfast is provided in the morning to those who stayed the previous \nnight.  \n82.  On Saturdays, shelter guests at the Hope Center are monitored by volunteers.  \n83.  The Hope Center’s Saturday shelter policy is that no one is allowed in the \nbuilding to participate in the day shelter unless they have stayed in the shelter the night \nbefore, having checked in and gone through a bag check. \n84.  True and correct copies of those Hope Center shelter policies are attached as \nExhibit 1 and Exhibit 2. \n85.  Saturday check-in time at the Hope Center for new guests is at 5:45 p.m.  \n86.  In addition to providing charitable food and shelter, the Hope Center maintains \na church on its property.  \n87.  Further, other homeless shelters in the Anchorage area accept biological males.  \n88.  The Hope Center has and will continue to direct any biological males who seek \naccess to its women’s shelter to those other shelters. \nThe Hope Center’s Interaction with “Jessie Doe”3 \n89.  On Friday, January 26, 2018, at about 6:00 p.m., ”Jessie Doe” (“Doe”) was \ndropped off at the Hope Center by officers of the Anchorage Police Department.  \n                                                 \n3 The real name of the complainant is not disclosed in this filing to address privacy concerns. \n12 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 12 of 54\n\n90.  Sherrie Laurie (“Laurie”), Hope Center’s Executive Director, was called to the \nDining Hall, which also serves as the sleeping area for the homeless women’s shelter, to discern \nthe course of action to be taken about Doe.  \n91.  Doe smelled strongly of alcohol and also had an open wound above Doe’s eye.  \n92.  Doe acted very agitated and was aggressive in body language.  \n93.  The Hope Center is a sober and clean shelter. No one is allowed to stay in the \nHope Center shelter if inebriated or high.  \n94.  Laurie informed Doe that the Hope Center did not accept individuals who were \ninebriated, under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and that Doe could not stay at Hope Center \nfor that reason.  \n95.  Laurie was eventually informed by the Francis Shelter that Doe had initiated a \nvery disruptive fight at the Francis Shelter, that the police had been called to handle the situation, \nand that Doe had been banned from the Francis Shelter property until July 4, 2018.  \n96.  Laurie recommended that Doe go to the hospital to receive medical care for the \nwound over Doe’s eye.  \n97.  Following much resistance, Doe agreed to go to the hospital, and Laurie paid for \na cab to take Doe to the emergency room.  \n98.  The Hope Center did not see Doe again that evening.  \n99.  The next day, on Saturday, January 27, 2018, around 2:00 p.m., Doe showed \nup at Hope Center again and sought to be admitted.  \n100.  Doe was not admitted, however, because Doe had not stayed the previous \nevening which is required by Shelter policy and because Doe sought entry at a time when \nthe shelter was not accepting new guests.  \n13 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 13 of 54\n\n101.  Doe was asked to leave the Hope Center property because the Hope Center, as \na courtesy to neighbors, does not allow loitering.  \n102.  Doe left the Hope Center and never returned.  \n103.  Doe later filed a complaint with the Commission claiming that the Hope \nCenter had discriminated against Doe on the basis of sex and gender identity under the \nAnchorage Municipal Code. \nThe Anchorage Municipal Code \n104.  The Commission was established by Section 17.02 of the Anchorage Municipal \nCharter. AMC § 5.10.020.  \n105.  It is an administrative agency within the Municipality of Anchorage. \n106.  Section 17.02 of the Anchorage Municipal Charter states that “[t]he assembly \nby ordinance shall establish an equal rights commission and prescribe its duties. The \ncommission shall appoint its principal executive officer with the approval of the mayor. The \nprincipal executive officer shall serve at the pleasure of the commission.”  \n107.  The Commission is authorized to hire an Executive Director, subject to the \napproval of the mayor, who serves at the pleasure of the Commission. AMC § 5.10.040. \n108.  The Commission may delegate to the Executive Director of the Commission all \npowers and duties given by Title 5 of the AMC, except the power to hold public hearings, issue \norders, and hire the executive director. AMC § 5.10.040(11). \n109.  The Executive Director of the Commission has the power to initiate, dismiss, and \nadministratively close complaints, initiate a civil action for injunctive relief, make \ndeterminations that a complaint is or is not supported by substantial evidence, initiate general \ninvestigations, issue discovery to a party, issue subpoenas, proceed with civil remedies, \n14 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 14 of 54\n\nsubstitute herself in for a complainant in a case, and determine whether conciliation efforts have \nfailed. AMC §§ 5.40.010, 5.40.060, 5.50.030, 5.50.060, 5.50.070, 5.50.080, 5.60.010, 5.60.020, \n5.60.050, 5.80.010. \n110.  The Chair of the Commission is the duly elected chairperson of the Commission, \nand has the power to rule on discovery objections and subpoenas, proceed with civil remedies, \nrule on requests for reconsideration, appoint hearing panels, rule on challenges to commissioner \nappointments. AMC §§ 5.20.010, 5.50.070, 5.50.080, 5.70.040. \n111.  Anchorage’s public accommodation law is found in AMC, Title 5, which was \namended in 2015 to include “gender identity” to the grounds of discrimination prohibited by the \ntitle. AMC § 5.20.050. \n112.  AMC § 5.20.010 defines “gender identity” as “a person’s gender-related self-\nidentity, as expressed in appearance or behavior, regardless of the person’s assigned sex at \nbirth. A person’s gender identity may be established by evidence of medical history, care or \ntreatment of the gender identity, consistent and uniform assertion of the gender identity, or \nother evidence that the gender identity is sincerely held, core to a person’s gender-related \nself-identity, and not being asserted for an improper purpose.” \n113.  The terms and phrases such as “evidence of medical history,” “consistent,” \n“uniform,” and “improper purpose” are not defined and the ordinance does not provide \nfurther guidance on how to interpret or enforce these terms. \n114.  AMC § 5.20.050 makes it illegal for public accommodations to: (1) refuse or \ndeny any of its accommodations, facilities, or services on the basis of sex or gender identity; (2) \n“[p]ublish, circulate, issue, display, post or mail a written or printed communication, notice or \nadvertisement” that “states or implies” that any of its accommodations would be “refused” or \n15 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 15 of 54\n\n“withheld” to a person based on their sex or gender identity; and (3) publish a statement that \n“states or implies” that a person’s “patronage or presence” belonging to a particular sex or \ngender identity would be “unwelcome, not desired, not solicited, objectionable or unacceptable.” \n115.  The terms and phrases such as “implies that,” “unwelcome,” “not desired,” \n“not solicited,” “objectionable,” and “unacceptable” are not defined and the ordinance does \nnot provide further guidance on how to interpret or enforce these terms. \n116.  AMC § 5.20.010 defines “public accommodation” as “any business or \nprofessional activity that is open to, accepts or solicits the patronage of, or caters or offers goods \nor services to the general public, subject only to the conditions and limitations established by law \nand applicable alike to all persons.” \n117.  In cases involving public accommodations, the Commission may order any \nequitable relief, including but not limited to admission or service in a place of public \naccommodation, and any other relief deemed appropriate by the Commission. \n118.  Although the Hope Center has repeatedly denied that it is a “public \naccommodation” and provided evidence accordingly, Anchorage continues to interpret its public \naccommodation law to include the Hope Center. \n119.  The Anchorage Municipal Code also includes a section titled “Unlawful practices \nin the sale, rental or use of real property,” which provides in relevant part that: “[I]t is unlawful \nfor the owner, lessor, manager, agent, brokerage service, or other person having the right to sell, \nlease, rent, advertise, or an owner’s association having the powers of governance and operation \nof real property to … [perform certain prohibited acts].” AMC § 5.20.020(A). \n16 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 16 of 54\n\n120.  The practices prohibited in AMC § 5.20.020 are subject to important exemptions \nset out in AMC § 5.25.030. “[C]onditions described in section 5.25.030(A). as ‘lawful \npractices’” are not subject to this chapter.   \n121.  One of the exemptions in section 5.25.030(A) states that the chapter shall not \napply to the “establishment of same-sex dormitories or portions thereof by educational facilities, \nprovided that such establishment shall not discriminate among its residents on the basis of race, \ncolor, religion, national origin, marital status, age, physical or mental disability, or familial \nstatus.” AMC § 5.25.030(A)(8). \n122.  Another exemption in section 5.25.030(A) states that the chapter shall not apply \nto [t]he establishment of a … shelter … or residential facility for the care and lodging of persons \nin need of special medical, rehabilitative, social, or psychological support, including, but not \nlimited to … shelters for the homeless.” AMC § 5.25.030(A)(9) (emphasis added).  \n123.  A finding of a discriminatory housing violation may result in issuance of an order \nthat includes, but is not limited to, actual damages, injunctive relief, and civil penalties not \nexceeding $11,000 if the respondent has not been adjudged to have committed any earlier \ndiscriminatory housing practice. \n124.  Despite the Hope Center’s objection and a clear exemption in the ordinance, \nAnchorage has likewise interpreted AMC § 5.20.020(A)(7) to apply to the Hope Center. \n125.  Title 5 of the AMC discusses the filing of complaints with or by the Anchorage \nEqual Rights Commission, as well as the investigative process of those complaints and fact \nfinding procedures. \n126.  The Commission or the Executive Director of the Commission may initiate \ninvestigations against an organization at any time. AMC § 5.50.060. \n17 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 17 of 54\n\n127.  According to AMC § 5.50.020(A), “[a]fter a complaint has been filed, staff \nshall convene a fact finding conference with the parties to define issues, receive and \nexchange information relevant to the complaint and response, if any, and negotiate a \nvoluntary resolution of the complaint, if possible, through a pre-determination settlement \nagreement. Parties shall be permitted to be fully represented by legal counsel at the fact \nfinding conference. Legal counsel shall be entitled to speak and present on behalf of the \nrepresented party at the fact finding conference. Legal counsel may not, however, cross-\nexamine the other party and must submit any questions through staff.” \n128.  A “fact finding conference” is an initial meeting where evidence is produced and \nthe complaint is discussed with the parties. AMC § 5.20.010. \n129.  The AMC also provides that the Commission shall provide “[t]he procedures \nto be followed at the conference” at least 21 days prior to the fact finding conference, \n“[e]xhibits and documents received at a fact finding conference may be used as evidence in \nmaking a determination”, “[s]tatements made by a party during a fact finding conference \nmay be used as evidence in making a determination….”, and that “[e]ach party may bring a \nreasonable number of witnesses.” AMC §§ 5.50.020(B)(3), (C), (F), (G). \n130.  If a matter is not settled between the parties, the Executive Director notifies \nthe Commission, and the chair of the Commission then appoints a “hearing panel,” which \nconsists of three commissioners hand-picked by the chair. AMC §§ 5.70.20, 5.70.030. \n131.  The hearing panel may conduct hearings or appoint a hearing examiner to \nconduct hearings. In conducting a hearing, the hearing panel or hearing examiner has full \nauthority to rule on the admissibility of evidence and other procedural matters. AMC § \n5.70.040. \n18 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 18 of 54\n\n132.  At the completion of a public hearing, the hearing panel may issue a final \norder in the case. AMC § 5.70.130. \n133.  The Commission may obtain a court order for the enforcement of any of its \norders by filing a complaint with the superior court in the Third Judicial District. AMC § \n5.80.030(B). \n134.  The Commission and/or its employees or representatives have the power to \nfile a complaint, initiate an investigation, conduct discovery, conduct the hearing, choose \nthose that preside over it, issue a ruling and enforce any penalty and punishment.  \nThe First Commission Complaint \n135.  On February 1, 2018, Doe filed a complaint (“First Complaint”) with the \nCommission claiming that the Hope Center had discriminated against Doe on the basis of \nsex and gender identity under AMC § 5.20.050, which prohibits discrimination in places of \npublic accommodation.  \n136.  The following day, the Commission forwarded the First Complaint to the \nHope Center, along with a notice of a fact finding conference. \n137.  On March 6, 2018, the Hope Center’s counsel, Kevin Clarkson (“Clarkson”), \nresponded to the First Complaint via letter, informing the Commission that (a) the Hope \nCenter was not a place of public accommodation; (b) Doe was turned away initially because \nDoe was under the influence of alcohol and had been involved in a fight at Francis Shelter; \n(c) Doe was turned away the following day because Doe appeared at a time when the Hope \nCenter was not accepting individuals; and (d) the Hope Center has a First Amendment right \nto religious liberty and association that permit it to operate exclusively so as to provide \ncharitable shelter to abused and battered women (“March 6 Letter”). \n19 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v.

Clarkson concluded the March 6 Letter by stating the Hope Center would not \nbe attending the fact finding conference, and that should the Commission decide to proceed \nwith the matter, the Hope Center intended to file a motion to dismiss. \n139.  The information provided should have been sufficient for the Commission to \ndismiss the First Complaint or reach a determination that the complaint was not supported \nby substantial evidence. \n140.  But instead, the Commission continued its “investigation” by serving mostly \nirrelevant and overbroad interrogatories to the Hope Center that contained close to 30 \ndifferent subparts.   \nProposition 1  \n141.  On March 14, 2018, the Anchorage Daily News published an article about \nProposition 1, an Anchorage initiative to regulate restrooms, locker rooms, and other \nfacilities based on the sex at birth of those seeking to access those facilities. (“March 14 \nArticle”).  \n142.  In that March 14 Article, the reporter referenced alleged comments made by \nAttorney Clarkson concerning the First Complaint against the Hope Center.  \n143.  Discussion of the First Complaint was relevant to the ongoing political debate \nin Anchorage about whether Proposition 1 should be passed.   \n144.  According to the March 14 Article, Clarkson said that “the person who filed \nthe [First Complaint] was not kept out of the shelter because they were transgender. He said \nit was because the person was intoxicated and came to the shelter while it was closed. Even \nso, Clarkson said the Hope Center is a religious organization that would not allow a \n20 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 20 of 54\n\n‘biological man’ to be sheltered there. The city’s other two emergency women’s shelters, \none of which is run by Catholic Social Services, do take in transgender women.” \n145.  On April 23, 2018, the Hope Center filed its motion to dismiss the First \nComplaint against it for lack of jurisdiction with the Commission, but to date the \nCommission has refused to rule on the motion.  \n146.  On April 26, 2018, the Commission “noted” receipt of the motion to dismiss, \nand made the first of several accusatory comments against the Hope Center and/or its \ncounsel. \n147.  For example, rather than dismiss or reach a determination that the complaint \nwas not supported by substantial evidence, the Commission attached a “pre-determination \nsettlement agreement, which [it believed would] adequately address [Hope Center’s] \nperceived misconduct and the Commission’s public policy concerns which arose as a result \nof [Hope Center’s] or its attorney’s actions.” \n148.  Based upon the Commission’s statements to and interactions with the Hope \nCenter during this investigation, it became clear that the Commission interpreted the \nAnchorage public accommodation law as requiring the Hope Center to admit biological men \ninto its women’s shelter and that the Commission considered the Hope Center guilty of \ncommitting “sex” or “gender identity” discrimination in violation of that law.  \n149.  On Friday, May 11, 2018, the Hope Center declined the Commission’s pre-\ndetermination settlement proposal related to the First Complaint as it had violated no law. \n21 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 21 of 54\n\nThe Second Commission Complaint \n150.  Unable to find any wrongdoing by the Hope Center in the First Complaint but \nunwilling to dismiss that complaint, the Commission continued its effort to force the Hope \nCenter to change its policies anyway.  \n151.  On Tuesday, May 15, 2018, Director Basler, filed a second complaint against \nthe Hope Center. (“Second Complaint”). \n152.  Director Basler also filed this Second Complaint against Brena, Bell & \nClarkson, P.C., the counsel of record for Hope Center at the time.  \n153.  In this Second Complaint, the Commission alleged that the Hope Center, \nthrough its alleged “spokesperson,” Clarkson, “published, circulated, issued, displayed, \nposted, or mailed a written or printed communication, notice or advertisement, or caused to \nbe circulated, issued or displayed, made, printed or published, a communication which states \nor implies that the use of Downtown Hope Center’s real property and/or services or facilities \nwill be refused to or denied to a person because of their sex and/or gender identity, in \nviolation of Anchorage Municipal Code § 5.20.020(A)(7) and/or Anchorage Municipal \nCode § 5.20.050(A)(2).” \n154.  The Commission contends in its Second Complaint that Clarkson has been \nidentified as the source of statements published in various media which implied or stated \nthat transgender individuals would not be allowed to be sheltered at the Hope Center. \n155.  Contemporaneously with the filing of the Second Complaint, the Commission \nset a fact finding conference and sent a “Request for Essential Information.” \n22 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 22 of 54\n\n156.  As a result of the potential conflict caused by the Commission’s filing of the \nSecond Complaint against the Hope Center’s attorney, the Hope Center was forced to hire \nnew counsel, Alliance Defending Freedom, the undersigned representing it in this litigation. \n157.  On June 21, 2018, Alliance Defending Freedom (“ADF”) entered an \nappearance in the Second Complaint, and informed the Commission that an ADF attorney \nwould serve as the “contact person” for the Hope Center. \n158.  But the Commission refused to correspond with ADF attorneys even though \nthese attorneys had affiliated themselves with a local attorney who was also representing the \nHope Center.  \n159.  On June 29, 2018, the Hope Center’s new counsel sent a letter to the \nCommission (“June 29 Letter”) informing the Commission that counsel had a conflict with \nthe fact finding conference date chosen by the Commission and had several concerns related \nto the lack of constitutional procedures and protections pertaining to the fact finding \nconference itself.  \n160.  The June 29 letter also noted that Hope Center intended to supplement its \ninterrogatory answers to include additional information on the jurisdictional issues. \n161.  The June 29 Letter also informed the Commission that the “procedures to be \nfollowed at the conference” had not been sent to the parties, as required, and requested a \ncopy of all relevant procedures referred to in the AMC. \n162.  Next, to the extent the “procedures” mentioned in AMC § 5.50.020(B)(3) \nreferred to AMC § 5.50.020 as a whole, the June 29 Letter stated the Hope Center’s \nconcerns about the lack of constitutional protections provided in the ordinance itself. \n23 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 23 of 54\n\n163.  Fact finding conferences at the Commission are evidentiary in nature, but as \ncounsel pointed out in its June 29 Letter, it is unclear what rules govern the admission of \nevidence at those conferences and how those rules are applied. \n164.  In its June 29 Letter, the Hope Center’s counsel asked whether objections to \nevidence would be allowed, whether there was a different standard for “documents” submitted, \nwhat rules were applicable, and how objections to evidence or “documents” were preserved.  \n165.  In relation to AMC § 5.50.020(G), the Hope Center asked in its June 29 Letter \nwhether counsel may object to questions asked or answers given, instruct a client not to answer, \nor even ask a client to clarify a response during the conference.  \n166.  The Hope Center also pointed out in its June 29 Letter that it had similar issues \nwith the “reasonable number of witnesses” that a party may bring.  \n167.  And the Hope Center inquired whether the prohibition on cross examination of \nthe “other party” extended to witnesses brought by the “other party.” \n168.  Due to unavailability of lead counsel and the fact it was unclear what the \nprocedures were, what rules were applicable, how those rules were expected to be applied, and \nwhether those procedures would comply with due process, the Hope Center requested a reset of \nthe fact finding conference in its June 29 Letter. \n169.  The Commission failed to answer any of the questions posed by the Hope \nCenter’s counsel in its June 29 Letter. \n170.  Even though the Commission set the fact finding conference without \ninquiring about counsel’s availability, the Commission contacted Hope Center’s local \nattorney and proceeded to deny the request for continuation of the fact finding conference \n24 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 24 of 54\n\nand stated that the information requested in its Request for Essential Information was due \ndays before the fact finding conference. \n171.  On July 5, 2018, before the fact finding conference, the Hope Center’s \ncounsel sent a letter to the Commission, noted disappointment with the Commission’s \nrefusal to reschedule the conference, again requested clarity about the conference’s \nprocedures, and submitted responses to the Commission’s Request for Essential \nInformation.  \n172.  The same day, the Hope Center filed a motion for lack of jurisdiction, further \nillustrating that the Commission had no basis to hold a fact finding conference. \n173.  In its Second Complaint, the Commission did not accuse the Hope Center of \ndirectly violating AMC § 5.20.020 or AMC § 5.20.050, but instead contends that oral statements \nmade by Clarkson, its former counsel, subject it to this section.  \n174.  The Commission has not alleged that Clarkson or his firm is an “owner,” “lessor,” \n“manager,” “brokerage service,” “owner’s association,” or “person having the right to sell, lease, \nrent [or] advertise” the Hope Center.  \n175.  Instead, the Commission appears to be accusing Clarkson of being an “agent” of \nreal property for the Hope Center.  \n176.  But Clarkson was the Hope Center’s attorney—not an “agent” of real property. \n177.  Clarkson’s comments themselves are also not actionable under the law. In \naddition to being protected by the litigation privilege, the law requires a written statement, and \nClarkson’s comments to the media were done orally. \n178.  In its motion for lack of jurisdiction, the Hope Center pointed out that not only \nhad the Commission failed to properly plead a claim against the Hope Center for violation \n25 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 25 of 54\n\nof AMC § 5.20.020 and 5.20.050, but that homeless shelters were specifically excluded from \nthat section as well as all of Title 5 of the AMC. \n179.  Section 5.20.020(A) specifically incorporates the exemption for homeless shelters \nfound at 5.25.030(A)(9). \n180.  And because the Hope Center is a “shelter for the homeless” and all sections of an \nordinance should be construed together so that all have meaning and no section conflicts with \none another, the Commission should have dismissed the First Complaint and Second Complaint \nagainst the Hope Center on this basis alone. \n181.  Along with the specific exclusion from the ordinance, the Hope Center is also not \na place of public accommodation. \n182.  The AMC limits its definition of public accommodation to a business or \ncommercial enterprise that serves the general public for profit or some other form of financial \nbenefit.  \n183.  The Hope Center’s women’s shelter is not a business or commercial enterprise, \ncurrently receives no government funds directly, but instead receives private donations from \nindividuals, other non-profits, businesses, foundations, and churches.  \n184.  The Hope Center women’s shelter operates exclusively on a charitable basis.  \n185.  The Hope Center women’s shelter does not conduct commercial transactions or \nother forms of “for profit” activities, and it does not cater to, or offer goods or services to, “the \ngeneral public.”  \n186.  Despite the Hope Center women’s shelter not meeting the definition of “public \naccommodation” and despite the Hope Center asking the Commission to address this point, \nthe Commission pressed forward with the fact finding conference anyway. \n26 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 26 of 54\n\nFact Finding Conference \n187.  On July 9, 2018, local counsel for the Hope Center, as well as local counsel \nfor Brena, Bell & Clarkson, appeared at the fact finding conference in the Second \nComplaint.  \n188.  As they previously told the Commission, Brena, Bell & Clarkson’s local \ncounsel came prepared with a court reporter to transcribe the fact finding conference.  \n189.  But the Commission informed counsel that transcription of the conference by \nthe court reporter would not be allowed. \n190.  Rather than address whether the Hope Center was a public accommodation or any \nof the facts or allegations involved in the Second Complaint, the Commission instead wrongly \naccused the Hope Center of not providing truthful answers to interrogatories in the First \nComplaint served two months earlier. \n191.  The Commission also alluded to materials it had in its possession allegedly \ndemonstrating inconsistencies with the Hope Center’s discovery responses involving funding, \nbut refused to show those materials to counsel and suggested it might at some later point.  \n192.  On July 13, 2018, the Hope Center’s local counsel followed up with the \nCommission and again asked for the materials promised during the fact finding conference \nin the Second Complaint (“July 13 e-mail”).  \n193.  But Hope Center’s counsel received the following negative response from the \nCommission’s investigator in return:  \nIn an effort to not distract what should be the immediate concerns of the parties \nregarding [settlement], we are not going to require [the Hope Center] to provide \nany supplemental information at this time, nor are we, at this time, going to be \nsupplementing the information provided to the parties.  \n \n27 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 27 of 54\n\n194.  In the same communication, the Commission also made derogatory comments \nabout the Hope Center’s prior counsel who had to withdraw from representation of the Hope \nCenter due to the complaint filed by the Executive Director. \n195.  The Commission’s investigator continued his July 13 e-mail by stating that \n“[p]erhaps [the Hope Center’s prior counsel] will be more forthcoming with providing [] \ninformation to [the Hope Center’s new counsel] than he has been to the Commission….” \n196.  After receiving the July 13 e-mail, the Hope Center received a proposed pre-\ndetermination settlement proposal from the Commission.  \n197.  Despite the Commission’s targeting of the Hope Center and its counsel, the \nHope Center proceeded in good faith to engage in settlement discussions. \n198.  On August 3, 2018, in the midst of those settlement discussions, the \nCommission unexpectedly accused the Hope Center and its counsel of not being forthright \nwith the Commission. \n199.  Specifically, the Commission accused Hope Center’s counsel of failing to \nsupplement discovery responses, even though the Hope Center’s counsel indicated its intent \nto supplement its responses earlier and the Commission told counsel that supplementation \nwas not necessary. See supra ¶¶ 157, 185-90.  \n200.  The Commission sent an e-mail on that date stating in part as follows: \nThis notice is being sent to all of you because each of you has a professional \nresponsibility to correct any false or misrepresented information that has previously \nbeen submitted to the Commission during its investigation of the above-referenced \ncomplaint. Although you may not have been representing the client at the time the \nstatements were made to the Commission, as Respondent’s current attorneys, each \nof you is ethically obligated to correct any omissions, false statements, and/or \nmisrepresentations previously made to the Commission.  \n \nI have attached a copy of the previously submitted interrogatories. Respondent has \nalready been allowed almost three months to make corrections to this information, \n28 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 28 of 54\n\nand  the  Commission’s  ability  to  fully  consider  Respondent’s  arguments  will \ncontinue to be limited by Respondent’s failure to timely amend and correct its \nearlier responses. The Commission will allow Respondent until August 9, 2018, to \nmake appropriate corrections to the interrogatory responses before it takes any \nformal action in regards to what it views as Respondent’s lack of candor about its \nreceipt of taxpayer funds and the contractual obligations for the receipt of those \nfunds.  \n \n201.  The Commission’s allegations in its August 3, 2018 e-mail were false. \n202.  The Commission had not been waiting for “almost three months” for the \nHope Center to make “corrections” to its interrogatory answers.  \n203.  The Hope Center was first informed on July 9, 2018 during the fact finding \nconference in the Second Complaint that the Commission had a vague concern related to its \ndiscovery responses. \n204.  Four days after that fact finding conference, the Commission told the Hope \nCenter’s counsel that it was not going to require the Hope Center to provide any \nsupplemental information at that time, but instead wanted to focus on resolution. \n205.  Despite the Commission’s attacks, the Hope Center on August 9, 2018, \namended its answers and objections to the Commission’s interrogatories in the First \nComplaint—not to correct alleged deficiencies, but to further substantiate reasons for \ndismissal of the complaint and to demonstrate more plainly to the Commission that its \noriginal answers were indeed truthful.  \n206.  To date, the Commission has not ruled on the Hope Center’s motions for lack \nof jurisdiction. \n207.  Nor has the Commission issued any determination that the First Complaint or \nSecond Complaint is or is not supported by substantial evidence. \n29 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 29 of 54\n\n208.  The First Complaint and Second Complaint are still in the “impartial \ninvestigation” phase. \nAnchorage is interpreting its law to stop the Hope Center from helping others \n209.  The Hope Center desires to continue its policy of allowing only biological \nfemales into its women’s shelter. \n210.  And due to the recent complaints filed against the Hope Center and publicity \nsurrounding it and its desire to be upfront and honest with others, the Hope Center likewise \ndesires to make its policies clear by posting them both at the women’s shelter and online. \n211.  But because of Anchorage’s public accommodation laws and the Commission’s \nhostile interpretation of them, the Hope Center faces only burdensome options.  \n212.  First, the Hope Center could comply with Anchorage’s interpretation of these \nlaws and seek to avoid investigation and punishment by allowing biological males to sleep in its \nshelter reserved solely for biological women, many of whom have been abused by men or \nescaped sex trafficking.  \n213.  But the Hope Center cannot take this first option because it not only places \nwomen at risk, it defies common sense, and likewise violates its religious beliefs. \n214.  Women who use the shelter have informed Hope Center officials that they would \nnot feel safe if they had to sleep and undress next to men.  \n215.  The Hope Center cannot pursue its religious mission or teach its religious beliefs \nabout loving those in need and about the difference between men and women when Anchorage \nforces the Hope Center to put homeless women at risk and to deny the distinction between men \nand women.   \n30 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 30 of 54\n\n216.  Second, the Hope Center could violate Anchorage’s interpretation of these laws \nby posting statements on the Hope Center grounds and on its website explaining the Hope \nCenter’s beliefs about sex and gender identity and explaining its denial of biological males into \nits women’s shelter. \n217.  The Hope Center could also violate Anchorage’s interpretation of these laws by \nhaving its attorneys talk about the Hope Center’s policies, its beliefs about sex and gender \nidentity, and the complaints filed against the Hope Center. \n218.  In fact, if not for Anchorage’s interpretation of its laws, the Hope Center would \ndirect its current lawyers to speak about the Hope Center’s policies about sex and gender \nidentity, its beliefs about sex and gender identity, and the complaints filed against the Hope \nCenter. \n219.  And if not for Anchorage’s interpretation of its laws, the Hope Center’s attorneys \nwould speak about these subjects in press releases, media interviews, and on their website.   \n220.  But the Hope Center and its attorneys will not take this second option because \nthey do not want to violate Anchorage’s laws and suffer its penalties. \n221.  Third, the Hope Center could refrain from posting statements explaining its \nbeliefs on sex and gender identity, the complaints filed against the Hope Center, and its policies \non sex and gender identity, and the Hope Center could also have its attorneys refrain from public \ndiscussion of these topics as well. \n222.  The Hope Center has temporarily taken this third option to avoid violating the \nAnchorage laws.  \n223.  Specifically, the Hope Center has refrained from posting a statement on its \ngrounds where women are admitted into its shelter, as well as on its website under the tab \n31 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 31 of 54\n\n“About the Women’s Shelter” located at   https://www.downtownhopecenter.org/ \nwomensshelter.  \n224.  The statement the Hope Center wants to post is attached as Exhibit 3. \n225.  Likewise, the Hope Center’s attorneys have been chilled from publicly discussing \nthe Hope Center’s religious beliefs and policies on its website (www.adflegal.org), in press \nreleases, and in media interviews even though it typically discusses those topics for other clients \nthrough these mediums.   \n226.  The Hope Center will not post its desired statement on its grounds or on its \nwebsite, and the Hope Center’s attorneys have been chilled in communicating about the Hope \nCenter in its typical fashion for fear of violating Anchorage’s laws.  \n227.  If not for Anchorage’s laws, the Hope Center would immediately post the \nstatement attached as Exhibit 3 both on its grounds where the women are admitted into its shelter \nas well as on the “About the Women’s Shelter” portion of its website. \n228.  This third option—not posting—also violates the Hope Center’s religious beliefs \nbecause the Hope Center is religiously motivated and obligated to follow God’s calling to foster \na safe environment for those women seeking refuge from the horrors they have experienced.    \n229.  Left with no option that does not violate its faith or the law, the Hope Center has \nno choice but to challenge the Anchorage laws for violating the United States and Alaska \nConstitutions.  \nALLEGATIONS OF LAW \n230.  At all times relevant to this Complaint, each and all of the acts alleged here are \nattributable to Defendants, who acted under color of a statute, regulation, custom, ordinance, or \nusage of the Municipality of Anchorage.  \n32 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 32 of 54\n\n231.  The Hope Center currently suffers imminent and irreparable harm because of \nDefendants’ actions that violate the Hope Center’s constitutional rights.  \n232.  The Hope Center has no adequate or speedy remedy at law for the loss of its \nconstitutional rights. \n233.  Unless Defendants’ conduct is enjoined, the Hope Center will continue to suffer \nirreparable injury. \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nFirst Amendment: Free Exercise of Religion \n234.  The Hope Center repeats and realleges each allegation contained in paragraphs 1-\n233 of this Complaint. \n235.  The First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the Hope \nCenter’s rights to operate, publish, speak, and not speak, in accordance with its religious beliefs. \n236.  The Hope Center has sincerely held religious beliefs that motivate and require it \nto operate its ministry in accordance with biblical moral teachings and to teach and explain those \nbeliefs to the public and those the Hope Center serves.  \n237.  The Hope Center would violate its religious beliefs if it were forced to allow \nbiological males admittance into its women’s only shelter and stopped from informing others \nabout its religious beliefs.  \n238.  AMC § 5.20.050 and AMC § 5.20.020 are not neutral or generally applicable as \napplied because they are based on hostility towards the Hope Center’s disfavored religious \nbeliefs and they target the Hope Center’s disfavored religious beliefs for punishment. \n239.  The Commission is pursuing complaints against the Hope Center without any \nsubstantial evidence. \n33 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 33 of 54\n\n240.  The Commission has made statements during the course of its investigation \nindicating its disdain for the Hope Center and/or its attorneys. \n241.  The Commission is engaging in intrusive and unnecessary discovery in the First \nComplaint. \n242.  Director Basler, through the Commission, purposefully brought a frivolous \ncomplaint against the Hope Center and its prior counsel without any basis in the law, resulting in \nthe need for it to obtain new representation.  \n243.  The First Amendment protects the Hope Center’s rights to believe and profess the \nreligious doctrines of its choice. \n244.  The First Amendment prohibits the government from interfering with this right by \npunishing the profession of a religious belief or imposing special disabilities on the basis of \nstating disfavored religious views. \n245.  AMC § 5.20.050 and AMC § 5.20.020 punish the Hope Center’s profession of its \nreligious beliefs. \n246.  Application of AMC § 5.20.050 and AMC § 5.20.020 are being threatened against \nthe Hope Center to coerce it into changing its policies based on its own religious beliefs. \n247.  AMC § 5.20.050 and AMC § 5.20.020, therefore, impose special disabilities on \nthe Hope Center due exclusively to its profession of disfavored religious beliefs.  \n248.  AMC § 5.20.050 and AMC § 5.20.020 directly and substantially interfere with the \nHope Center’s power to order its own affairs, including on matters of faith, doctrine, and \noperation. \n249.  AMC § 5.20.050 and AMC § 5.20.020 are also not neutral or generally applicable \nbecause they contain categorical exemptions.  \n34 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 34 of 54\n\n250.  AMC § 5.20.050 and AMC § 5.20.020 are not neutral or generally applicable \nbecause they are enforced through a system of individualized assessments. \n251.  For example, AMC § 5.20.050 contains the undefined, vague, and overbroad \nterms “unwelcome,” “not solicited,” “objectionable,” and “unacceptable” to describe what the \nAMC prohibits. Anchorage officials must determine—without any guidance—whether any of \nthese prohibitions apply in a given case based on their own subjective determinations.  \n252.  AMC § 5.20.050 and AMC § 5.20.020 also violate Plaintiff’s free exercise rights \nunder the hybrid rights doctrine because they implicate free exercise rights in conjunction with \nother constitutional protections, like the rights to free speech, expressive association, due process \nand equal protection. \n253.  AMC § 5.20.050 and AMC § 5.20.020 burden the Hope Center’s sincerely held \nreligious beliefs by banning, deterring, and preventing its religiously motivated speech, including \nthe statement in Exhibit 3. \n254.  AMC § 5.20.050 and AMC § 5.20.020 burden the Hope Center’s sincerely held \nreligious beliefs by preventing it from operating in accordance with its religious beliefs.  \n255.  Anchorage laws effectively prevent the Hope Center from speaking its \nreligiously-desired messages, from not speaking in ways required by its faith, and from adhering \nto key aspects of its faith. \n256.  AMC § 5.20.050 and AMC § 5.20.020 do not serve any compelling, significant or \nlegitimate, or even valid interests in a narrowly tailored way.  \n257.  Accordingly, as applied to the Hope Center, AMC § 5.20.050 and AMC \n§ 5.20.020 violate the First Amendment right to free exercise. \n35 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 35 of 54\n\nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nFirst Amendment: Freedom of Speech \n258.  The Hope Center repeats and realleges each allegation contained in paragraphs 1-\n233 of this Complaint. \n259.  The First Amendment Free Speech Clause protects the Hope Center’s rights to \nspeak, to publish speech, to be free from content and viewpoint discrimination, to be free from \nunconstitutional conditions, to be free from vague laws allowing unbridled discretion, to be free \nfrom overbroad laws, to not speak, and to not publish speech. \n260.  If not for Anchorage’s interpretation of AMC § 5.20.050(A)(2) and AMC § \n5.20.020(A)(7) as shown in the Second Complaint, the Hope Center and its agents, including its \nattorneys, would immediately engage in protected speech, including but not limited to, \npublishing and teaching its desired messages as set forth in Exhibit 3. \n261.  Instead, the Hope Center is not only unable to publish or display a portion of its \nadmittance policy, it likewise cannot discuss the Hope Center’s religious beliefs concerning sex \nand gender identity.  \n262.  The Hope Center has not and will not engage in certain protected speech to avoid \nviolating Anchorage’s interpretation of AMC 5.20.050(A)(2) and AMC § 5.20.020(A)(7) and to \navoid incurring the penalties for violating Anchorage’s interpretation of that law.  \n263.  The Hope Center is currently suffering ongoing harm because of Anchorage’s \ninterpretation of AMC § 5.20.050(A)(2) and AMC § 5.20.020(A)(7). \n264.  Because Anchorage’s interpretation of AMC § 5.20.050(A)(2) and AMC \n§ 5.20.020(A)(7) infringes rights under the Free Speech Clause, AMC § 5.20.050(A)(2) and \n36 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 36 of 54\n\nAMC § 5.20.020(A)(7) and Anchorage’s enforcement of these provisions chill, deter, and restrict \nthe Hope Center. \n265.  Further, vague and overbroad language included in the AMC allows unbridled \ndiscretion.  \n266.  AMC § 5.20.050(A)(2)(b) makes it “unlawful” for the owner, agent, or employee \nof a public accommodation to imply that a person’s “patronage or presence” belonging to a \nparticular sex or gender identity would be “unwelcome, not desired, not solicited, objectionable \nor unacceptable.” \n267.  AMC § 5.20.050(A)(2)(b) uses undefined and overbroad terms and phrases such \nas “implies that,” “unwelcome,” “not desired,” “not solicited,” “objectionable,” and \n“unacceptable” to describe the speech that is prohibited. \n268.  AMC § 5.20.050(A)(2)(b) is vague, facially and as applied, because it outlaws \ncommunications stating that any accommodations, facilities, or services will be refused or \nrestricted because of gender identity.  \n269.  AMC § 5.20.050(A)(2)(b) is overbroad because it outlaws publishing, circulating, \nissuing, displaying, posting or mailing a written or printed communication, notice of \nadvertisement “which states or implies that . . . [t]he patronage or presence of a person belonging \nto a particular race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, national origin, \nmarital status, age, or physical or mental disability is unwelcome, not desired, not solicited, \nobjectionable or unacceptable.”  \n270.  And the AMC definition of “gender identity” in AMC § 5.20.010 is facially \nunconstitutional under the First Amendment’s Free Speech Clause because its vague terms grant \n37 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 37 of 54\n\nunbridled discretion to enforcement officials to ban speech the government opposes and to allow \nspeech the government supports.  \n271.  AMC § 5.20.010 uses undefined and overbroad terms and phrases such as \n“evidence of medical history,” “consistent,” “uniform,” and “improper purpose” to define \n“gender identity.” \n272.  Those terms and phrases are not defined by the AMC, nor does that ordinance \nlanguage provide guidelines to govern the decisions of Defendants in applying and enforcing \nthese vague and overbroad terms. \n273.  This permits Defendants to use unbounded discretion to punish disfavored speech \non sex, gender identity, and other topics of public concern. \n274.  This unbridled discretion also exacerbates the issue of viewpoint discrimination. \n275.  Because Defendants’ interpretation of AMC § 5.20.050(A)(2) and AMC \n§ 5.20.020(A)(7) violates free-speech principles for all of the reasons stated above, they must \nfurther a compelling interest in a narrowly tailored way.  \n276.  Prohibiting the Hope Center from displaying or publishing its religiously \nmotivated policy explaining its religious beliefs does not further any legitimate, rational, \nsubstantial, or compelling interest. \n277.  Punishing the Hope Center’s speech also does not serve any legitimate, rational, \nsubstantial, or compelling government interest in a narrowly tailored way.  \n278.  Defendants have alternative, less restrictive means to achieve any legitimate \ninterest they may possess rather than forcing the Hope Center to abandon its free-speech rights.  \n279.  Moreover, punishing speech which states or implies the patronage or presence of \na person belonging to a protected class is “unwelcome, not desired, not solicited, objectionable \n38 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 38 of 54\n\nor unacceptable” does not further any legitimate, rational, substantial, or compelling interest, and \ncertainly does not further any such interests in a narrowly tailored way. \n280.  Defendants have alternative, less restrictive means to achieve any legitimate \ninterest they may possess rather than banning all speech which states or implies the patronage or \npresence of a person belonging to a protected class is “unwelcome, not desired, not solicited, \nobjectionable or unacceptable” because of a protected classification.  \n281.  Accordingly, as applied to the Hope Center and any of its agents, AMC \n§ 5.20.050(A)(1)-(3) and AMC § 5.20.020(A)(7) violates the First Amendment right to free \nspeech. \n282.  Accordingly, facially, AMC § 5.20.010’s definition of gender identity and \nAMC § 5.20.050(A)(2)(b) violate the First Amendment right to free speech. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \nFourteenth Amendment: Procedural Due Process \n283.  The Hope Center repeats and realleges each allegation contained in paragraphs 1-\n233 of this Complaint. \n284.  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees persons the \nright to due process of law, which includes the right to be free from vague guidelines granting \nofficials unbridled discretion.  \n285.  The Hope Center’s Fourteenth Amendment right to due process is violated in both \nthe vague language the ordinance uses as well as the lack of procedural safeguards included in \nthe investigatory process. \n39 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 39 of 54\n\n286.  First, AMC § 5.20.010 uses undefined and overbroad terms and phrases such \nas “evidence of medical history,” “consistent,” “uniform,” and “improper purpose” to define \n“gender identity.” \n287.  AMC § 5.20.050(A)(2)(b) also uses undefined and overbroad terms and phrases \nsuch as “implies that,” “unwelcome,” “not desired,” “not solicited,” “objectionable,” and \n“unacceptable” to describe the speech that is prohibited. \n288.  Second, although AMC § 5.20.020(A)(7) does not apply to “shelters for the \nhomeless,” Defendants have interpreted such language to apply to the Hope Center.  \n289.  AMC § 5.20.020(A)(7) is therefore vague as applied to the Hope Center and does \nnot provide it fair notice. \n290.  And even though AMC § 5.20.020(A)(7) is not applicable to attorneys, the \nCommission is applying it as such. \n291.  Third, according to AMC § 5.50.020(A), “[a]fter a complaint has been filed, \nstaff shall convene a fact finding conference with the parties to define issues, receive and \nexchange information relevant to the complaint and response, if any, and negotiate a \nvoluntary resolution of the complaint, if possible, through a pre-determination settlement \nagreement. Parties shall be permitted to be fully represented by legal counsel at the fact \nfinding conference. Legal counsel shall be entitled to speak and present on behalf of the \nrepresented party at the fact finding conference. Legal counsel may not, however, cross-\nexamine the other party and must submit any questions through staff.” \n292.  The AMC also provides that the Commission shall provide “[t]he procedures \nto be followed at the conference” at least 21 days prior to the fact finding conference, \n“[e]xhibits and documents received at a fact finding conference may be used as evidence in \n40 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 40 of 54\n\nmaking a determination”, “[s]tatements made by a party during a fact finding conference \nmay be used as evidence in making a determination….”, and that “[e]ach party may bring a \nreasonable number of witnesses.” AMC §§ 5.50.020(B)(3), (C), (F), (G). \n293.  These provisions use vague and undefined terms and guidelines granting officials \nunbridled discretion.  \n294.  Lastly, the Hope Center is entitled to a neutral arbiter, but the powers provided to \nthe Commission in AMC Title 5 do not afford it that right. \n295.  The mayor has the power to appoint members to the Commission, and the \nCommission has the authority to hire an executive director, subject to the approval of the mayor. \n296.  The Commission then and/or its employees or representatives have the power \nto file a complaint, initiate an investigation, conduct discovery, conduct the hearing, choose \nthose that preside over it, issue a ruling, and enforce any penalty and punishment.  \n297.  As such, Title 5 is devoid of procedural safeguards to protect any respondent who \nhas had a claim filed against it. The broad powers given to the Commission violate the concepts \nof legal fairness, objectivity and due process.  \n298.  In addition, the Commission’s actions have also interfered with the Hope Center’s \nrepresentation by counsel.  \n299.  AMC §§ 5.20.010, 5.20.050, and 5.50.020 do not serve any compelling, \nsignificant or legitimate, or even valid interest in a narrowly tailored way.  \n300.  Accordingly, as applied to the Hope Center, AMC §§ 5.20.010, 5.20.050, and \n5.50.020 violate the Fourteenth Amendment right to due process under the laws. \n41 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 41 of 54\n\n301.  Accordingly, facially, AMC § 5.20.010’s definition of gender identity, \n§ 5.20.050(A)(2)(b), and the lack of procedural safeguards contained in Title 5 violate the \nFourteenth Amendment right to due process under the laws. \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nFirst Amendment: Freedom of Expressive Association \n302.  The Hope Center repeats and realleges each allegation contained in paragraphs 1-\n233 of this Complaint. \n303.  The First Amendment protects the right of people to associate with others in \npursuit of a wide variety of political, social, economic, educational, religious, and cultural ends. \n304.  The First Amendment bars the government from compelling people to associate \nwith others in an association expressing messages.  \n305.  The First Amendment also prohibits the government from banning people from \nassociating with others in an association expressing messages. \n306.  The Hope Center is an expressive association because people with likeminded \nbeliefs, including those on staff and volunteers at its shelter, are joining together to teach and \nserve the homeless in Anchorage and express their religious beliefs about the differences \nbetween men and women.  \n307.  The volunteers and staff at the Hope Center’s shelter advocate the position that \nwomen deserve dignity and respect and a safe space. Forcing the Hope Center’s shelter to accept \nmen would undermine its ability to advocate that position and cause it to reconsider its \noperations going forward.  \n308.  AMC § 5.20.050(A)(2) and AMC § 5.20.020(A)(7) harm the Hope Center’s \nability to promote its beliefs by requiring it to either decline to associate with others that help \n42 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 42 of 54\n\npromote its religious messages or to associate with individuals and events that will require it to \nspeak messages that completely contradict its desired message.  \n309.  The Hope Center likewise engages in expressive association when Hope Center \nofficials partner with each other and decide to partner with homeless women, teaching them \ncertain biblical values and lessons. \n310.  In offering shelter and engaging in Bible studies with those who seek shelter, the \nHope Center expressively associates with those homeless women for the purpose of \ncommunicating desirable messages to those individuals. \n311.  One of the reasons that the Hope Center associates with homeless women is to \nexpress messages consistent with its religious beliefs about God’s ability to restore, renew, and \ntransform. \n312.  The Hope Center uses real-life stories of care that it helped facilitate to promote \ntheir religious view of God’s design. \n313.  The Hope Center uses these real-life stories in various ways, such as in speaking \nengagements, to encourage others to adopt their religious ideals regarding God’s design.  \n314.  When the Hope Center assists a homeless woman get on her feet, they associate \nwith that individual, who themselves become an ongoing, living example that communicates to \nfriends, co-workers, and others regarding the Hope Center’s views about God’s design. \n315.  It is common for people to learn about the homeless shelter services that the Hope \nCenter provides from women who have used the Hope Center’s services. \n316.  When people learn that the Hope Center assisted a homeless female, people \nbelieve that the services provided were consistent with the Hope Center’s religious beliefs. \n43 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 43 of 54\n\n317.  Defendants have indicated that, under AMC § 5.20.050 and AMC \n§ 5.20.020(A)(7), the Hope Center must expressively associate with biological males in its \nwomen’s only shelter and allow them access to homeless women who have been abused and \nbattered. \n318.  By compelling the Hope Center to expressively associate with biological males in \nits women’s only shelter, Defendants force the Hope Center to expressively associate in a way \nthat communicates messages to women under its care and the community that are contrary to the \nHope Center’s desired messages, including messages that contradict the Hope Center’s religious \nbeliefs.  \n319.  Thus, Defendants’ interpretation of AMC § 5.20.050 and AMC § 5.20.020(A)(7) \ninfringes on the Hope Center’s right to expressively associate and to be free from compelled \nexpressive association. \n320.  Because AMC § 5.20.050 and AMC § 5.20.020(A)(7) infringes on the Hope \nCenter’s expressive association rights, it must further a compelling interest in a narrowly tailored \nway. \n321.  As applied to the Hope Center, AMC § 5.20.050 and AMC § 5.20.020(A)(7) does \nnot further any legitimate, rational, substantial, or compelling interest by forcing the Hope Center \nto expressively associate with biological males who desire to sleep under the same roof as \nhomeless women, thereby conveying messages to the women under its care and the community \nthat violates the Hope Center’s religious beliefs. \n322.  Moreover, compelling such expressive association does not serve any legitimate, \nrational, substantial, or compelling interest in a narrowly tailored way. \n44 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 44 of 54\n\n323.  Defendants have alternative, less restrictive means to achieve any legitimate \ninterest they may possess rather than forcing the Hope Center to abandon its freedom of \nexpressive association.  \n324.  Accordingly, as applied to the Hope Center, AMC § 5.20.050 and AMC \n§ 5.20(A)(7) violate the Hope Center’s right to expressive association protected by the Free \nSpeech Clause of the First Amendment. \nFIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nFirst Amendment: Establishment Clause \n325.  The Hope Center repeats and realleges each allegation contained in paragraphs 1-\n233 of this Complaint. \n326.  The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment requires the government to act \nwith a secular purpose and to neither promote nor inhibit religion.  \n327.  The government may not interfere with the power of a religious organization to \norder its own affairs, including on matters of faith, doctrine, and operation.  \n328.  Defendants’ continued investigation of the Hope Center lacks any secular \npurpose. Instead, Defendants have targeted and singled out religious speech and belief for \nexclusion.  \n329.  Defendants’ investigation and threatened enforcement of its public \naccommodation laws violate the Establishment Clause by singling out religious speech and belief \nfor hostility. \n330.  Defendants’ investigation and threatened enforcement singles out and excludes \nthe Hope Center based on a disfavored religious view and sends a message that a religious \n45 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 45 of 54\n\nperson, such as the Hope Center, is a second-class citizen, outsider, and not a full member of the \ncommunity. \n331.  No compelling state interest exists to justify the actions of Defendants. \n332.  Because Defendants’ actions violate the Hope Center’s rights under the \nEstablishment Clause, they must further a compelling government interest in a narrowly tailored \nway. \n333.  Targeting the Hope Center for exclusion based on its statement of a disfavored \nreligious view does not further any legitimate, rational, substantial, or compelling government \ninterest; nor does it serve any legitimate government interest in a narrowly tailored way.  \n334.  Accordingly, as applied to the Hope Center, Defendants’ actions violate the \nEstablishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution as incorporated \nand applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. \nSIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nFourteenth Amendment: Equal Protection \n335.  The Hope Center repeats and realleges each allegation contained in paragraphs 1-\n233 of this Complaint. \n336.  Under the Equal Protection Clause, the government may not treat someone \ndisparately as compared to similarly situated persons when such disparate treatment burdens the \nexercise of a fundamental right.  \n337.  The Hope Center has a fundamental right to free speech and free exercise.  \n338.  The Hope Center is similarly situated to other similarly situated facilities in \nAnchorage that provide housing. \n46 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 46 of 54\n\n339.  Defendants treat the Hope Center’s exercise of its religious beliefs differently \nthan those similarly situated facilities.  \n340.  Under the AMC’s housing section, educational facilities may establish same-sex \ndormitories; however, Anchorage has interpreted its public accommodation laws to forbid the \nHope Center from doing the same. See AMC § 5.25.030(A)(8). \n341.  Section 5.25.030(A)(9) of the AMC’s housing section also states that the chapter \nshall not apply to homeless shelters.  \n342.  Thus, Defendants treat the Hope Center differently from similarly situated parties \nin a manner that infringes on the Hope Center’s freedom of religion, speech, and association.  \n343.  When the enforcement of laws, like the AMC, infringes on a fundamental right, \ncourts presume discriminatory intent.  \n344.  In this case, the presumption of discriminatory intent is also borne out in \nDefendants’ targeting of the Hope Center based on its religious beliefs.  \n345.  Defendants do not serve any legitimate, rational, substantial, or compelling \ninterest in treating the Hope Center differently than similarly situated agencies based solely on \nHope Center’s exercise of its fundamental rights. \n346.  Defendants have many alternative, less restrictive mechanisms available to serve \nany legitimate interests they possess. \n347.  Accordingly, as applied to the Hope Center, Defendants’ actions violate the Equal \nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution as \nincorporated and applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.  \n47 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 47 of 54\n\nSEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nAlaska Constitution Article 1 § 4: Freedom of Religion \n348.  The Hope Center repeats and realleges each allegation contained in paragraphs 1-\n233 of this Complaint. \n349.  Article 1, § 4 of the Alaska Constitution provides that “[n]o law shall be made \nrespecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.”   \n350.  Article 1, § 4 of the Alaska Constitution has been interpreted more broadly than \nits federal counterparts.  \n351.  The government may not interfere with the power of a religious organization to \norder its own affairs, including on matters of faith, doctrine, and operation. \n352.  Defendants’ actions and interpretation of AMC § 5.20.050 and AMC § 5.20.020 \nsubstantially burden the Hope Centers’ religious exercise by using their investigation and threats \nof enforcement of public accommodation laws to surrender their religious beliefs and expression \nin order to provide shelter for the homeless community.  \n353.  Further, Defendants’ continued investigation of the Hope Center lacks any secular \npurpose. Instead, Defendants have targeted and singled out religious speech and belief for \nexclusion.  \n354.  Defendants’ investigation and threatened enforcement of its public \naccommodation laws violate Article 1, § 4 of the Alaska Constitution by singling out religious \nspeech and belief for hostility. \n355.  Defendants’ investigation and threatened enforcement singles out and excludes \nthe Hope Center based on a disfavored religious view and sends a message that a religious \n48 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 48 of 54\n\nperson, such as the Hope Center, is a second-class citizen, outsider, and not a full member of the \ncommunity. \n356.  Because Defendants’ actions violate Article 1, § 4 of the Alaska Constitution, \nthey must further a compelling government interest in a narrowly tailored way. \n357.  The exercise of governmental authority which threatens to substantially burden \nthe Hope Center’s rights under Article 1, § 4 of the Alaska Constitution is imminent. \n358.  Accordingly, as applied to the Hope Center, AMC § 5.20.050 and AMC \n§ 5.20.020 violate Article 1, § 4 of the Alaska Constitution.  \nEIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nAlaska Constitution Article 1 § 1: Equal Protection \n359.  The Hope Center repeats and realleges each allegation contained in paragraphs 1-\n233 of this Complaint. \n360.  Article 1, § 1 of the Alaska Constitution provides in part that “all persons are \nequal and entitled to equal rights, opportunities, and protection under the law….” \n361.  The equal protection clause of the Alaska Constitution has been interpreted more \nbroadly then the federal equal protection clause. \n362.  The government may not treat someone disparately as compared to similarly \nsituated persons when such disparate treatment burdens the exercise of a fundamental right.  \n363.  The Hope Center has a fundamental right to free speech and free exercise.  \n364.  The Hope Center is similarly situated to other similarly situated facilities in \nAnchorage that provide housing. \n365.  Defendants treat the Hope Center’s exercise of its religious beliefs differently \nthan those similarly situated facilities.  \n49 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 49 of 54\n\n366.  Under the AMC’s housing section, educational facilities may establish same-sex \ndormitories; however, Anchorage has interpreted its public accommodation laws to forbid the \nHope Center from doing the same. AMC § 5.25.030(A)(8). \n367.  Section 5.25.030(A)(9) of the AMC’s housing section also states that the chapter \nshall not apply to homeless shelters.  \n368.  Thus, Defendants treat the Hope Center differently from similarly situated parties \nin a manner that infringes on the Hope Center’s freedom of religion, speech, and association.  \n369.  When the enforcement of laws, like the AMC, infringes on a fundamental right, \ncourts presume discriminatory intent.  \n370.  In this case, the presumption of discriminatory intent is also borne out in \nDefendants’ targeting of the Hope Center based on its religious beliefs.  \n371.  Defendants do not serve any legitimate, rational, substantial, or compelling \ninterest in treating the Hope Center differently than similarly situated agencies based solely on \nHope Center’s exercise of its fundamental rights. \n372.  Defendants have many alternative, less restrictive mechanisms available to serve \nany legitimate interests they possess. \n373.  Accordingly, as applied to the Hope Center, Defendants’ actions violate the Equal \nProtection Clause of the Alaska Constitution. \nNINTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nAlaska Constitution Article 1 § 22: Right of Privacy \n374.  The Hope Center repeats and realleges each allegation contained in paragraphs 1-\n233 of this Complaint. \n50 \nThe Downtown Soup Kitchen v. Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \nCase 3:18-cv-00190-SLG   Document 1   Filed 08/16/18   Page 50 of 54\n\n375.  Article 1, § 22 of the Alaska Constitution provides in part that “[t]he right of the \npeople to privacy is recognized and shall not be infringed.” \n376.  Women who stay at the Hope Center sometimes change at the shelter or are in \nvarious states of undress when preparing to sleep for the night. There are no biological males \nallowed at the women’s shelter. \n377.  Homeless women do not expect, nor should they be forced, to change, sleep \nalongside, and interact with men in intimate settings. And this is particularly true considering \nthat several of the women present at the shelter may have been beaten, raped, and sexually \nassaulted by men. \n378.  The Hope Center’s interest in protecting women at its shelter conflicts with the \nCommission’s desire to force those women to change, sleep alongside, and interact with men in \nintimate settings.  \n379.  Because Defendants’ actions violate Article 1, § 22 of the Alaska Constitution, \nthey must further a compelling government interest in a narrowly tailored way. \n380.

Stuart, Municipality of Anchorage, Municipal Attorney's \nOffice, Anchorage, AK, for Defendants. \nORDER RE PENDING MOTIONS \nSharon L. Gleason, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE. \nBefore the Court are four motions. First, Plaintiff The Downtown Soup Kitchen (\"Hope \nCenter\") filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction at Docket 29. Defendants Municipality of \nAnchorage, Anchorage Equal Rights Commission, and Pamela Basler (collectively, \n\"Anchorage\") responded in opposition at Docket 52, and Hope Center replied at Docket 63. \nSecond, Anchorage filed a Motion for Federal Abstention at Docket 43. Hope Center \nresponded in opposition at Docket 56, and Anchorage replied at Docket 61. Third, \nAnchorage filed a Motion to Stay Proceedings Pending Resolution of Defendants' Motion for \nAbstention at Docket 44. Hope Center responded in opposition at Docket 55, and \nAnchorage replied at Docket 60. Fourth, Hope Center filed a Motion to Supplement or for \nJudicial Notice at Docket 79. Anchorage responded in opposition at Docket 85. On January \n11, 2019, the parties presented oral argument on the first three motions. Oral argument on \nthe fourth motion was not requested and was not necessary to the Court's determination. \nBACKGROUND \n \n\n \n \nHope Center \nPlaintiff Hope Center is a faith-based, non-profit organization that offers free food, showers, \nChristian ministry, and other services to homeless men and women in the downtown \nAnchorage area, as well as overnight shelter to homeless women.  Most of the women that \n[1]\nHope Center shelters have escaped from sex trafficking or been abused or battered, \nprimarily at the hands of men.[2] Hope Center can accommodate 782*782 up to 50 women \novernight,  all of whom sleep on the floor in one large room, where they may change \n[3]\nclothes or be in various states of undress.  Because of its religious beliefs and its limited \n[4]\nspace, Hope Center accepts only persons who were determined to be female at birth into its \novernight shelter.  Persons who were determined to be female at birth and who self-identify \n[5]\nas men are permitted to access the shelter.  \n[6]\nHope Center maintains that its religious beliefs include that a person's sex is an immutable \nGod-given gift, and that it is wrong for a person to deny his or her Godgiven sex.  It \n[7]\ncontends that it would be against Hope Center's religious beliefs to allow persons who were \ndetermined to be male at birth to disrobe and sleep in its shelter next to persons who were \ndetermined to be female at birth.  \n[8]\nHope Center requires overnight guests to be persons who were determined to be female at \nbirth; to be at least 18 years old; to demonstrate no dangerous behavior; to be clean and \nsober; to be exposed to religious activities; to be able to meet their personal needs without \nassistance; and to respect shelter guidelines, including prohibitions against smoking, \nfighting, foul language, and wandering about the property.  On Saturdays, when the shelter \n[9]\nis staffed by volunteers, no one is allowed into the building to participate in the day shelter \nunless she stayed in the shelter the Friday night before and thus has gone through a bag \ncheck.  Saturday check-in time for new guests is at 5:45 p.m.  \n[10] [11]\nHope Center would like to post, publish, or circulate its admittance policy or portions of \nit,  but it has refrained from doing so for fear of violating the Anchorage Municipal Code \n[12]\n(\"AMC\").  Similarly, Hope Center would like its attorneys to be able to speak and write \n[13]\nabout its policies  but fears that having them do so would violate the AMC.  \n[14] [15]\n Anchorage Equal Rights Commission \n783*783\nDefendant Anchorage Equal Rights Commission (\"AERC\") is an administrative agency \nwithin the Municipality of Anchorage.  In support of the Municipality's policy of \n[16]\nguaranteeing \"fair and equal treatment under law to all people of the municipality,\"  AERC \n[17]\ninvestigates complaints of discrimination \"based upon race, color, sex, sexual orientation, \ngender identity, religion, national origin, marital status, age, or physical or mental \ndisability.\"  It also is empowered to initiate a general investigation on its own motion to \n[18]\ndetermine whether an individual or organization is engaging in such discrimination.  AERC \n[19]\nis authorized to conduct discovery,  subpoena witnesses and documents,  and hold \n[20] [21]\nhearings.  \n[22]\n \n\n \n \nWhen a private person or entity files a complaint with AERC, the agency is required to \nconvene a fact-finding conference with the complainant and the respondent and attempt to \nnegotiate a voluntary resolution of the complaint.  At least 21 days before the fact-finding \n[23]\nconference, AERC is required to provide information and instructions about the conference \nto the parties.  At the conference, parties may be represented by legal counsel, but \n[24]\ncounsel may not cross-examine the other party and must submit any questions through \nAERC staff.  \n[25]\nAERC is required to investigate discrimination complaints promptly and impartially and to \nissue a determination within 240 days of the filing of the complaint.  If it determines that \n[26]\nthe allegations are not supported by substantial evidence, AERC closes or dismisses the \ncomplaint.  If instead it finds an unlawful discriminatory practice, AERC issues an order \n[27]\nrequiring cessation of the discriminatory conduct.  A party against whom such an order is \n[28]\nissued may appeal to the Alaska Superior Court.  \n[29]\nThe \"Jessie Doe\" Incident \n\"Jessie Doe\" self-identifies as \"female and transgender.\"  On Friday, January 26, 2018, at \n[30]\nabout 6:00 p.m., Anchorage Police Department officers brought Doe to Hope Center.  Doe \n[31]\nsmelled strongly of alcohol, was very agitated, was aggressive in body language, and had \nan open wound above one eye.  Hope Center's Executive Director, Sherrie Laurie, \n[32]\ninformed Doe that because Hope Center did not accept individuals who were inebriated or \nunder the influence of alcohol or drugs, Doe could not stay at the shelter.  She \n[33]\nrecommended that Doe go to the hospital for medical care of the eye wound.  Doe \n[34]\neventually 784*784 agreed, and Laurie paid for a cab to take Doe to the emergency \nroom.  At approximately 2:00 p.m. the next day, a Saturday, Doe returned to Hope Center \n[35]\nand sought admission, which was denied because Doe had not stayed the previous night, \nas was required for Saturday admission prior to 5:45 p.m.  Later, Laurie learned that Doe \n[36]\nhad initiated a fight at another homeless shelter, the police had been called, and Doe had \nbeen banned from the other homeless shelter until July 4, 2018.  \n[37]\nProcedural History \nOn February 1, 2018, Doe filed a complaint (\"First Complaint\") with AERC, alleging that \nHope Center's shelter was a public accommodation and that Hope Center had \ndiscriminated against Doe on the basis of sex and gender identity in violation of AMC § \n5.20.050.  AERC informed Hope Center about the First Complaint and scheduled a fact-\n[38]\nfinding conference for March 15, 2018.  In a detailed letter to AERC dated March 6, 2018, \n[39]\nHope Center explained that it did not consider itself to be a public accommodation, that it \nhad not discriminated against Doe on the basis of gender identity, and that it \"has First \nAmendment religious liberty and association rights to operate as it does.\"  Hope Center \n[40]\nasserted that the fact-finding conference should thus be cancelled and stated that it would \nnot attend the conference and would file a motion to dismiss if AERC pursued the \nmatter.  AERC pursued its investigation by serving interrogatories on Hope Center.  On \n[41] [42]\nApril 23, 2018, Hope Center filed a motion to dismiss that focused on its assertion that its \n \n\n \n \nshelter is not a public accommodation covered by AMC § 5.20.050.  AERC responded \n[43]\nwith a proposed settlement agreement addressing Hope Center's \"perceived \nmisconduct.\"  On May 11, 2018, Hope Center declined the settlement proposal.  \n[44] [45]\nOn May 15, 2018, AERC filed a separate discrimination complaint against Hope Center and \nits attorney (\"Second Complaint\"), claiming that the attorney had made statements \npublished in various media that stated or implied that transgender individuals would not be \nallowed to be sheltered at Hope Center, in violation of AMC § 5.20.020 and/or § \n5.20.050.  AERC also set a fact-finding conference and sent a \"Request for Essential \n[46]\nInformation.\"  Because of the potential conflict caused by the Second Complaint against \n[47]\nHope Center's attorney, Hope Center retained new counsel.  \n[48]\nOn June 21, 2018, Hope Center's new counsel entered an appearance with AERC on the \nSecond Complaint.  On June 29, 2018, AERC requested a continuance of the fact-finding \n[49]\nconference.[50] It also expressed 785*785 concerns that the fact-finding conference, and the \nordinance providing for it, lacked constitutional procedures and protections.  Finally, the \n[51]\nletter noted that Hope Center would supplement its interrogatory answers to include \nadditional information on the jurisdictional issues it intended to raise.  \n[52]\nAERC denied the continuance request and informed Hope Center that it still expected the \ninformation it had sought in its \"Request for Essential Information.\"  On July 5, 2018, Hope \n[53]\nCenter submitted its responses to that request.  The same day, it also filed a motion to \n[54]\ndismiss the Second Complaint for lack of jurisdiction.  \n[55]\nThe fact-finding conference on the Second Complaint was held on July 9, 2018.  At the \n[56]\nconference, AERC told Hope Center that the agency had materials that contradicted Hope \nCenter's discovery responses, but would not provide them to Hope Center at that time.  \n[57]\nOn July 13, 2018, Hope Center's counsel emailed AERC to request the materials discussed \nat the fact-finding conference.  In an emailed response, AERC stated that because the \n[58]\nparties' immediate concern should be a settlement, it would not provide any supplemental \ninformation, nor would it require Hope Center to provide any supplemental information.  \n[59]\nOn August 3, 2018, while settlement discussions were ongoing, AERC sent Hope Center's \ncounsel an email that stated in part: \n[AERC's] ability to fully consider [Hope Center's] arguments will continue to be limited by \n[Hope Center's] failure to timely amend and correct its earlier responses. [AERC] will allow \n[Hope Center] until August 9, 2018, to make appropriate corrections to the interrogatory \nresponses before it takes any formal action in regards to what it views as [Hope Center's] \nlack of candor about its receipt of taxpayer funds and the contractual obligations for the \nreceipt of those funds.  \n[60]\n \n\n \n \nOn August 9, 2018, Hope Center provided amended answers to a number of interrogatories \nthat AERC had propounded to it; it indicated it did so not to correct alleged errors but to \nmake clear that its original answers were truthful.  \n[61]\nHope Center filed its Complaint in this Court on August 16, 2018, claiming violation of its \nFirst Amendment rights of freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and freedom of \nexpressive association; violation of the Establishment Clause; violation of the Fourteenth \nAmendment rights of procedural due process and equal protection; and violation of its \nAlaska constitutional rights of freedom of religion, equal protection, and \nprivacy.  Thereafter, in October 2018, AERC administratively closed the Second \n[62]\nComplaint.[63] The First Complaint remains unresolved.[64] In November 2018, 786*786 AERC \nExecutive Director Pamela Basler and AERC Chairperson Wanda Greene filed sworn \nstatements in this case, attesting that \"AERC has undertaken no enforcement action \nagainst [Hope Center] regarding\" the First Complaint.  They further certified that \"AERC \n[65]\nwill undertake no investigative or enforcement actions regarding [the First Complaint] while \nthis Court exercises jurisdiction in the matter.\"  \n[66]\nRelevant Municipal Code Provisions \nTitle 5 of the AMC, entitled \"Equal Rights,\" is intended to \"guarantee fair and equal \ntreatment under law to all people of the municipality, consistent with federal and state \nconstitutional freedoms and laws, including freedom of expression, freedom of association \nand the free exercise of religion.\"  Chapter 5.20 includes prohibitions on discriminatory \n[67]\npractices in places of public accommodation  and in the sale, rental, or use of real \n[68]\nproperty.  \n[69]\nSection 5.20.050, \"Unlawful practices in places of public accommodation,\" provides in \nrelevant part: \nA. It is unlawful for a person, whether the owner, operator, agent or employee of an owner \nor operator of a public accommodation, to: \n1. Refuse, withhold from or deny to a person any of its accommodations, advantages, \nfacilities, benefits, privileges, services or goods of that place on account of ... sex [or] \ngender identity.... \n2. Publish, circulate, issue, display, post or mail a written or printed communication, notice \nor advertisement which states or implies that: \na. Any of the services, goods, facilities, benefits, accommodations, advantages or privileges \nof the public accommodation will be refused, withheld from or denied to a person of a \ncertain ... sex [or] gender identity ...; or \nb. The patronage or presence of a person belonging to a particular ... sex [or] gender \nidentity ... is unwelcome, not desired, not solicited, objectionable or unacceptable. \n\"Public accommodation\" is defined in the AMC as \"any business or professional activity that \nis open to, accepts or solicits the patronage of, or caters or offers goods or services to the \n \n\n \n \ngeneral public, subject only to the conditions and limitations established by law and \napplicable alike to all persons.\"  \n[70]\nAlthough the First Complaint was only brought pursuant to Section 5.20.050, also relevant \nto this dispute is Section 5.20.020, \"Unlawful practices in the sale, rental or use of real \nproperty,\" which provides in relevant part: \nA. With the exception of those conditions described in section 5.25.030A. as \"lawful \npractices\", it is unlawful for the owner, lessor, manager, agent, brokerage service, or other \nperson having the right to sell, lease, rent, [or] advertise ... real property to: \n1. Refuse to sell, lease or rent, or to otherwise make unavailable, the real property to a \nperson because of ... sex [or] gender identity.... \n787*787 2. Discriminate against a person because of ... sex [or] gender identity... in a term, \ncondition or privilege relating to the use ... of real property.... \n7. Circulate, issue or display, make, print or publish, or cause to be made or displayed, \nprinted or published, any communication, sign, notice, statement or advertisement with \nrespect to the use... of real property that indicates any preference, limitation, specification or \ndiscrimination based on... sex [or] gender identity.... \nSection 5.25.030, \"Lawful practices,\" provides in relevant part: \nA. Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter, it shall not apply with respect to the \nfollowing conditions:... \n9. The establishment of a hospital, convent, monastery, shelter, asylum, or residential \nfacility for the care and lodging of persons in need of special medical, rehabilitative, social, \nor psychological support, including, but not limited to... shelters for the homeless. \nJURISDICTION \nThis Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343 and \nsupplemental jurisdiction with respect to the state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367. \nDISCUSSION \nI. MOTION FOR FEDERAL ABSTENTION \nAs a threshold matter, Anchorage asserts that the Court should abstain from exercising \njurisdiction under the Younger doctrine.  \n[71]\nA. Legal Standard \n\"Abstention from the exercise of federal jurisdiction is the exception, not the \nrule.\"  \"[F]ederal courts ordinarily should entertain and resolve on the merits an action \n[72]\n \n\n \n \nwithin the scope of a jurisdictional grant, and should not refuse to decide a case in \ndeference to the states.\"  The Supreme Court has instructed that federal courts have a \n[73]\n\"virtually unflagging obligation... to exercise the jurisdiction given them.\"  \n[74]\nHowever, in \"exceptional circumstances,\" a federal court may abstain from exercising its \njurisdiction \"where denying a federal forum would clearly serve an important countervailing \ninterest.\"  One such circumstance is Younger abstention, in which \"concerns for comity \n[75]\nand federalism\" make abstention appropriate when a particular type of state proceeding is \npending.  \n[76]\n788*788 \"A federal court may abstain under Younger in three categories of cases: `(1) \nparallel, pending state criminal proceedings, (2) state civil proceedings that are akin to \ncriminal prosecutions, and (3) state civil proceedings that implicate a State's interest in \nenforcing the orders and judgments of its courts.'\"  In addition to falling into one of the \n[77]\nthree categories, to warrant Younger abstention \"the state proceeding must be (1) \n`ongoing,' (2) `implicate important state interests,' and (3) provide `an adequate opportunity \n... to raise constitutional challenges.'\"  If those threshold elements are met, a federal court \n[78]\nmay abstain under Younger if the federal action would have the practical effect of enjoining \nthe state proceedings and no other exception to Younger applies.  \n[79]\nHere, the proceedings before AERC are clearly not category (1) or (3) proceedings. At issue \nis whether the proceeding before AERC falls within category (2); that is, whether the AERC \nproceeding is a state civil proceeding that is akin to a criminal prosecution. The Ninth Circuit \nhas described this category of cases as \"quasi-criminal enforcement actions.\"  Although \n[80]\nthe Ninth Circuit has not directly addressed the issue, several federal courts have \nconcluded that when the pending state proceedings are at the investigative stage, the state \nproceeding is not a \"quasi-criminal enforcement action.\" For example, in Telco \nCommunications, Inc. v. Carbaugh, a state agency notified a fundraising company that the \nagency had received a complaint alleging prohibited conduct and asked the company to \nattend an informal factfinding conference.  After attending the conference, the company \n[81]\nfiled a federal suit seeking protection against action by the agency on First Amendment \ngrounds, among other claims.  The Fourth Circuit held \"that the period between the threat \n[82]\nof enforcement and the onset of formal enforcement proceedings may be an appropriate \ntime for a litigant to bring its First Amendment challenges in federal court.\"  As the court \n[83]\nexplained: \nWhere no formal enforcement action has been undertaken, any disruption of state process \nwill be slight.... Appellant's contention—that abstention is required whenever enforcement is \nthreatened—would leave a party's constitutional rights in limbo while an agency \ncontemplates enforcement but does not undertake it. A federal plaintiff would be placed \n\"between the Scylla of intentionally flouting state law and the Charybdis of forgoing what [it] \nbelieves to be constitutionally protected activity in order to avoid becoming enmeshed\" in \nenforcement proceedings.  \n[84]\nNoting that the agency had not initiated formal enforcement proceedings against the \ncompany, the Fourth Circuit upheld the district court's decision not to abstain.  \n[85]\n \n\n \n \n789*789 The First Circuit applied a similar approach in Guillemard-Ginorio v. Contreras-\nGomez.  There, the Office of the Insurance Commissioner of Puerto Rico (\"OIC\") had \n[86]\nnotified the plaintiff insurance agency and its principals that they were being investigated; it \ncommenced an investigation but had not brought charges prior to the initiation of the federal \ncase. Noting that \"no formal enforcement action ha[d] been undertaken\" against the \ncompany or its principals, the First Circuit concluded \"that the agency's investigation of the \nplaintiffs was at too preliminary a stage to constitute a `proceeding' \ntriggering Younger abstention.\"  Based in part on this conclusion, the circuit court held that \n[87]\nthe district court properly denied abstention.  Other federal courts have reached similar \n[88]\nconclusions.  \n[89]\nB. Analysis \nBecause the underlying state proceeding in this case is an administrative \nproceeding, Younger abstention is appropriate only if that proceeding is a \"quasi-criminal \nenforcement action.\"  But at the time this action was filed, the AERC proceeding was not a \n[90]\nquasi-criminal enforcement action; rather, that proceeding was in the investigative phase. \nAERC had not yet determined whether Hope Center's conduct violated the AMC provisions \nat issue, or even whether AERC has jurisdiction regarding the First Complaint.  Indeed, in \n[91]\nNovember 2018, AERC's Executive Director and its Chairperson both certified that \"AERC \nhas undertaken no enforcement action against Plaintiff regarding\" the First \nComplaint.  Like the state court proceedings at issue in Telco Communications, Inc., \n[92]\nGuillemard-Ginorio, and the other federal cases cited above, the AERC proceeding is not a \n\"quasi-criminal enforcement action\" that would justify Younger abstention by this Court. \nAnchorage contends that this case is analogous to Ohio Civil Rights Commission v. Dayton \nChristian Schools, Inc.  and Middlesex County Ethics Commission v. Garden State Bar \n[93]\nAssociation.[94] Both cases, however, are distinguishable from 790*790 the case at hand, \nbecause \"the regulating agencies in those cases had investigated the allegations, made \ndeterminations that probable cause existed, and served formal charges on the \nentities.\"  As noted above, the AERC proceeding against Hope Center did not progress \n[95]\npast the investigatory stage. \"In short, the state action [in Dayton Christian \nSchools and Middlesex] had progressed significantly beyond that here.\"  \n[96]\nBecause the state proceeding before AERC regarding the First Complaint is not a \"quasi-\ncriminal enforcement action,\" Younger abstention is not appropriate. Accordingly, \nAnchorage's motion for federal abstention will be denied.  \n[97]\nII. MOTION TO STAY PROCEEDINGS \nAnchorage moved to stay all proceedings in this case pending a ruling on Anchorage's \nmotion for abstention.  For the reasons discussed in Section I. above, the Court is denying \n[98]\nAnchorage's motion for abstention. Accordingly, Anchorage's motion to stay will be denied \nas moot. \n \n\n \n \nIII. MOTION TO SUPPLEMENT OR FOR JUDICIAL \nNOTICE \nHope Center moves to supplement its Motion for Preliminary Injunction with several sealed \ndocuments. In the alternative, Hope Center requests that the Court take judicial notice of \nthe documents.  Anchorage contends that Hope Center has offered no explanation as to \n[99]\nwhy the relevance of the sealed documents was not appreciated until after briefing was \ncomplete, and that accordingly Hope Center's motion does not satisfy the requirements for \nsupplementation pursuant to Alaska Local Civil Rule 7.1(d).  While the Court finds the \n[100]\nsealed documents to be of limited relevance to the pending motions, the Court will allow \nHope Center to supplement its Motion for Preliminary Injunction with these documents. \nAccordingly, the Court does not address Hope Center's request that the Court take judicial \nnotice of the documents. \nIV. MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nA. Legal Standard \nHope Center moves for \"a preliminary injunction to stop Defendants from applying \nAnchorage Municipal Code, Title 5, § 5.20.050 and § 5.20.020 in a manner that violates \nHope Center's rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution \nand under Article 1, §§ 1, 4, and 22 of the Alaska Constitution.\"  \n[101]\nA party moving for a preliminary injunction must make a \"clear showing 791*791 of each \nelement of standing.\"  \"[T]he irreducible constitutional minimum of standing\" consists of \n[102]\nthree elements: injury in fact, causation, and a likelihood that a favorable decision will \nredress the plaintiff's alleged injury.  When challenging a law prior to its enforcement, a \n[103]\nplaintiff satisfies the injury in fact requirement where the plaintiff \"intends to engage in `a \ncourse of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest' and [ ] there is a credible \nthreat that the challenged provision will be invoked against the plaintiff.\"  \"First \n[104]\nAmendment challenges `present unique standing considerations' because of the `chilling \neffect of sweeping restrictions' on speech.\"  Accordingly, \"when the threatened \n[105]\nenforcement effort implicates First Amendment rights, the inquiry tilts dramatically toward a \nfinding of standing.\"  \"Even in the First Amendment context,\" however, \"a plaintiff must \n[106]\nshow a credible threat of enforcement.\"  \"In determining whether a plaintiff faces [] a \n[107]\ncredible threat in the pre-enforcement context, this Court considers three factors: (1) the \nlikelihood that the law will be enforced against the plaintiff; (2) whether the plaintiff has \nshown, `with some degree of concrete detail,' that [it] intends to violate the challenged law; \nand (3) whether the law even applies to the plaintiff.\"  When a plaintiff challenges the \n[108]\nenforcement of multiple legal provisions, a court considers separately whether the plaintiff \nhas standing to challenge the enforcement of each provision at issue.  \n[109]\n \n\n \n \nIn addition to standing, plaintiffs seeking preliminary injunctive relief must establish that \"(1) \nthey are likely to succeed on the merits; (2) they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the \nabsence of preliminary relief; (3) the balance of equities tips in their favor; and (4) a \npreliminary injunction is in the public interest.\"  \"Under the sliding scale \n[110]\napproach 792*792 to preliminary injunctions observed in [the Ninth Circuit], the elements of \nthe preliminary injunction test are balanced, so that a stronger showing of one element may \noffset a weaker showing of another.\"  But in any event, even with the sliding-scale \n[111]\napproach, \"plaintiffs must establish that irreparable harm is likely, not just possible, in order \nto obtain a preliminary injunction.\"  Injunctive relief is an equitable remedy, and \"[t]he \n[112]\nessence of equity jurisdiction is the power of the court to fashion a remedy depending upon \nthe necessities of the particular case.\"  \n[113]\nB. Analysis \n1. Standing to seek a preliminary injunction \nA federal court has \"an independent obligation to determine whether subject-matter \njurisdiction exists, even when no party challenges it.\"  \"A suit brought by a plaintiff without \n[114]\nArticle III standing is not a `case or controversy,' and an Article III federal court therefore \nlacks subject matter jurisdiction over the suit.\"  The Court therefore first considers on its \n[115]\nown initiative whether Hope Center has standing to challenge the enforcement of AMC §§ \n5.20.020 and 5.20.050.  The Court addresses separately Hope Center's standing to \n[116]\nchallenge each provision.  \n[117]\nThe Court first turns to the public accommodation provision, AMC § 5.20.050. Doe's First \nComplaint cited to this provision, but that AERC proceeding has not progressed past the \ninvestigatory phase. Accordingly, the Court must determine whether Hope Center has \nsuffered \"a credible threat in the pre-enforcement context.\"  To that end, the Court will \n[118]\nconsider (1) the likelihood that the law will be enforced against Hope Center; (2) whether \nHope Center has shown, \"with some degree of concrete detail,\" that it intends to violate the \nchallenged law; and (3) whether the law even applies to Hope Center.  \n[119]\nConsidering these factors, the Court is satisfied that Hope Center has established a credible \nthreat of enforcement with respect to AMC § 5.20.050. First, AMC § 5.20.050 prohibits \npublic accommodations from discriminating on the basis of sex or gender identity. Unlike \nAMC § 5.20.020, § 5.20.050 does not include language explicitly exempting homeless \nshelters from that prohibition.  Accordingly, Hope Center's intended \n[120]\nconduct 793*793 \"arguably falls within the [provision's] reach.\"[121] Turning to the likelihood of \nenforcement, there is currently an \"impending proceeding\" against Hope Center that was \ninitiated pursuant to AMC § 5.20.050.  AERC has not suggested that the provision would \n[122]\nnot be enforced if it were violated, nor had the provision \"fallen into desuetude.\"  Indeed, \n[123]\nafter the First Complaint was filed, AERC's executive director initiated a second AERC \nproceeding against Hope Center pursuant to AMC § 5.20.050.  Accordingly, Hope \n[124]\nCenter's assertion that they are refraining from engaging in certain conduct for fear of an \nenforcement action against it under this provision is reasonable. Finally, Hope Center has \n \n\n \n \nshown that it has a concrete plan to engage in conduct that arguably violates the provision. \nAmong other assertions, Hope Center has declared a specific intent to post, publish, or \ncirculate its admittance policy or portions of it.  Based on the foregoing, the Court \n[125]\nconcludes that Hope Center has standing to challenge AMC § 5.20.050. \nTurning to AMC § 5.20.020, the Court must determine whether Hope Center has suffered \"a \ncredible threat in the pre-enforcement context\" with respect to this code provision.  This \n[126]\nprovision presents a closer question, as two of the three factors suggest that Hope Center \ndoes not face a credible threat of enforcement: First, AMC § 5.20.020 explicitly exempts \nhomeless shelters. Even in cases that may implicate First Amendment rights, courts have \nfound that claims of future harm lack credibility where, as here, the provision in question \n\"clearly fails to cover [the plaintiff's] conduct.\"  Second, Hope Center does not appear to \n[127]\nhave alleged a concrete plan to engage in conduct that arguably violates the provision; \nbecause Hope Center is a homeless shelter, the provision's prohibitions on sex and gender \ndiscrimination would not appear to cover Hope Center's proposed conduct. \nAlthough two factors suggest that Hope Center does not face a credible threat of \nenforcement with respect to AMC § 5.20.020, the third factor weighs heavily in Hope \nCenter's favor. The First Complaint against Hope Center was filed only pursuant to AMC § \n5.20.050; but the Second Complaint was filed pursuant to both AMC § 5.20.020 and AMC § \n5.20.050. And while the First Complaint was filed by Doe, the Second Complaint was filed \nby AERC's Executive Director.  Although AERC later dismissed the Second Complaint, \n[128]\nthe agency has not explained the basis for that dismissal. And while AMC § 5.20.020 is not \nimplicated in any ongoing AERC proceeding, the record does not indicate that the agency \nhas \"disavow[ed] application of the challenged provision\" to Hope Center in the future.  \n[129]\n794*794 Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that the \"likelihood of enforcement\" factor \nweighs in Hope Center's favor. Further, \"keeping in mind that `when the threatened \nenforcement effort implicates First Amendment rights, the [standing] inquiry tilts dramatically \ntoward a finding of standing,'\" the Court concludes that Hope Center has established a \ncredible threat of enforcement as to AMC § 5.20.020.  Furthermore, the alleged injury is \n[130]\ntraceable to AMC § 5.20.020 and would likely be redressed by a favorable decision \nenjoining enforcement of the provision. Accordingly, Hope Center has standing to challenge \nAMC § 5.20.020. \n2. Preliminary injunctive relief \na. Likelihood of success on the merits \nHope Center contends that a preliminary injunction is appropriate because AMC §§ \n5.20.020 and 5.20.050 are unconstitutional as-applied to the constitutionally protected \nactivities of Hope Center and its agents.  However, \"[i]t is a well-established principle \n[131]\ngoverning the prudent exercise of [the federal court's] jurisdiction that normally the Court will \nnot decide a constitutional question if there is some other ground upon which to dispose of \nthe case.\"  Here, Hope Center also contends that AMC § 5.20.020 does not apply to \n[132]\n \n\n \n \n\"shelters for the homeless\" and that Hope Center is not a \"public accommodation\" within the \nmeaning of AMC § 5.20.050.  If that is the case, then Anchorage would not be able to \n[133]\nenforce these provisions against Hope Center, irrespective of their constitutionality. \nAccordingly, the Court will first consider whether either of these code provisions apply to \nHope Center's overnight living space for homeless persons. \nDetermining whether AMC §§ 5.20.020 and 5.20.050 apply to Hope Center's homeless \nshelter requires interpretation of the Anchorage Municipal Code. \"The interpretation of \nmunicipal ordinances and charters \"is governed by rules of statutory \nconstruction.\"  Federal courts apply state rules of statutory construction when interpreting \n[134]\nmunicipal laws.  Alaska courts \"apply the same rules of interpretation\" when construing \n[135]\nstatutes and municipal ordinances.  The Alaska Supreme Court has explained Alaska's \n[136]\nrules of statutory interpretation as follows: \nInterpretation of a statute begins with its text. In addition to the text, we also consider a \nstatute's legislative history 795*795 and purpose. In construing a statute, we have adopted a \nsliding scale approach whereby the plainer the statutory language is, the more convincing \nthe evidence of contrary legislative purpose or intent must be. Whenever possible we \ninterpret each part or section of a statute with every other part or section, so as to create a \nharmonious whole.  \n[137]\nThe Alaska Supreme Court has also held that \"[w]here an agency interprets its own \nregulations, a deferential standard of review properly recognizes that the agency is best \nable to discern its intent in promulgating the regulation at issue.\"  \n[138]\nWith these principles in mind, the Court first turns to AMC § 5.20.020. In relevant part, the \nprovision states that it is unlawful for certain persons, including an owner of real \nproperty,  to: \n[139]\n1. Refuse to sell, lease or rent, or to otherwise make unavailable, the real property to a \nperson because of ... sex [or] gender identity .... \n2. Discriminate against a person because of ... sex [or] gender identity... in a term, condition \nor privilege relating to the use ... of real property.... \n7. Circulate, issue or display, make, print or publish, or cause to be made or displayed, \nprinted or published, any communication, sign, notice, statement or advertisement with \nrespect to the use ... of real property that indicates any preference, limitation, specification \nor discrimination based on ... sex [or] gender identity.... \nThe provision also states that these prohibitions do not apply to \"those conditions described \nin section 5.25.030A as \"lawful practices.\" In relevant part, AMC § 5.25.030 defines \"lawful \npractices\" to include: \n9. The establishment of a hospital, convent, monastery, shelter, asylum, or residential \nfacility for the care and lodging of persons in need of special medical, rehabilitative, social, \nor psychological support, including, but not limited to ... shelters for the homeless. \n \n\n \n \nIt is clear from the structure and plain text of these provisions that the drafters of the AMC \nintended to exempt homeless shelters from the prohibitions on conduct articulated in AMC § \n5.20.020. Furthermore, the Alaska Supreme Court has concluded that \"[t]he purpose of \nAMC 5.20.020 ... is to prohibit discrimination in the rental housing market.\"  Applying the \n[140]\nprovision's prohibitions to Hope Center's homeless shelter would not further this purpose. \nHope Center is thus likely to succeed as to its contention that AMC § 5.20.020 does not \napply to Hope Center's homeless shelter. \nThe Court next turns to AMC § 5.20.050. In relevant part, the provision states that it is \nunlawful for the \"owner or operator of a public accommodation\" to: \n1. Refuse, withhold from or deny to a person any of its accommodations, advantages, \nfacilities, benefits, privileges, services or goods of that place 796*796 on account of ... sex \n[or] gender identity.... \n2. Publish, circulate, issue, display, post or mail a written or printed communication, notice \nor advertisement which states or implies that: \na. Any of the services, goods, facilities, benefits, accommodations, advantages or privileges \nof the public accommodation will be refused, withheld from or denied to a person of a \ncertain ... sex [or] gender identity ...; or \nb. The patronage or presence of a person belonging to a particular... sex [or] gender identity \n... is unwelcome, not desired, not solicited, objectionable or unacceptable. \nTo determine whether these prohibitions apply to Hope Center, the Court must consider \nwhether Hope Center is an \"owner or operator of a public accommodation\" within the \nmeaning of the AMC. The AMC defines \"public accommodation\" as \"any business or \nprofessional activity that is open to, accepts or solicits the patronage of, or caters or offers \ngoods or services to the general public, subject only to the conditions and limitations \nestablished by law and applicable alike to all persons.\"  \n[141]\nIn contrast to AMC § 5.20.020, § 5.20.050 does not include language that expressly \nexempts homeless shelters from its prohibitions.  Nevertheless, Alaska's rules of \n[142]\nstatutory interpretation and the structure of the Anchorage Municipal Code as a whole \nsuggest that homeless shelters are not public accommodations as defined in AMC § \n5.20.050. For if the term \"public accommodation\" in AMC § 5.20.050 is read to apply to \nhomeless shelters, then the exemption for homeless shelters contained in AMC § 5.20.020 \nwould have no effect.  Pursuant to Alaska Supreme Court precedent, this Court must \n[143]\n\"interpret each part or section of a statute [or municipal code] with every other part or \nsection, so as to create a harmonious whole.\"  To give effect to the exemption for \n[144]\nhomeless shelters contained in AMC 797*797 § 5.20.020, the Court concludes that Hope \nCenter is not an \"owner or operator of a public accommodation\" within the meaning of AMC \n§ 5.20.050.  Hope Center is thus likely to succeed as to its contention that AMC § \n[145]\n5.20.050 does not apply to Hope Center's homeless shelter. Because neither of the AMC \nprovisions at issue appear to apply to Hope Center's homeless shelter, it has a \"likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits\" as to its claims. \n \n\n \n \nb. Likelihood of irreparable harm in the absence of \npreliminary relief \nIrreparable harm \"analysis focuses on irreparability, `irrespective of the magnitude of the \ninjury.'\"  \"A threat of irreparable harm is sufficiently immediate to warrant preliminary \n[146]\ninjunctive relief if the plaintiff `is likely to suffer irreparable harm before a decision on the \nmerits can be rendered.'\"  \n[147]\nHope Center alleges injury in the form of interference with its constitutional rights.  Hope \n[148]\nCenter also alleges that the code provisions at issue have \"hindered [Hope Center's] ability \nto raise funds, leaving it in a tenuous financial state.\"  Additionally, Hope Center contends \n[149]\nthat enforcement of AMC §§ 5.20.020 and 5.20.050 against Hope Center would impede its \nability to provide overnight living space for homeless persons.  Anchorage asserts that \n[150]\nHope Center has failed to \"demonstrate that irreparable injury is likely in the absence of an \ninjunction, not merely that it is possible.\"  It also asserts that Hope Center has not shown \n[151]\nthat its alleged financial injury would be irreparable.  \n[152]\nHere, Hope Center has established a sufficient likelihood of irreparable harm resulting from \nrestrictions on Hope Center's ability to provide overnight living space to homeless persons. \nIn Hawaii v. Trump, the Ninth Circuit found that Hawaii's \"inability to assist in refugee \nresettlement\" weighed in favor of finding a likelihood of irreparable harm to the \nState.[153] Similarly, in Doe v. Trump, the 798*798 District Court for the Western District of \nWashington found irreparable harm when the plaintiff organizations \"ha[d] built programs \nspecifically to serve Muslim and Arabic-speaking refugees,\" and government action would \nimpede their ability to continue providing services to those populations.  The harms \n[154]\nalleged in those cases are similar to those at issue here. Declarations from persons who \nhave used Hope Center's overnight living space provide additional support for Hope \nCenter's contention that it would have difficulty serving its target population if AMC §§ \n5.20.020 and 5.20.050 were enforced against the shelter.  Based on the foregoing, the \n[155]\nCourt concludes that Hope Center has demonstrated that it is likely to suffer irreparable \nharm in the absence of preliminary injunctive relief. \nc. Balance of the equities \nThe third requirement that a moving party must show in order to obtain a preliminary \ninjunction is that the balance of equities tips in its favor.  \"[T]he very purpose of a \n[156]\npreliminary injunction ... is to preserve the status quo and the rights of the parties until a \nfinal judgment issues in the cause.\"  One factor considered by courts when balancing the \n[157]\nequities is whether a mandatory or prohibitory injunction is sought; the latter is considered \nsubstantially less burdensome to the defendant.  \n[158]\nHope Center contends that the equities favor it because the Code provisions at issue \n\"irreparably harm Hope Center's constitutional freedoms and significantly hinder its \nministry\"; in contrast, it maintains that \"Anchorage can achieve any valid interest through \n \n\n \n \nlaws already on the books.\"  Anchorage responds that it has \"a substantial interest in (1) \n[159]\nthe comity of the courts and the orderly administration of ongoing state proceedings ... and \n(2) enforcing AMC § 5.20.050, which serves the fundamentally important purpose of \nprotecting the rights of all protected classes in the Municipality of \nAnchorage.\"  Anchorage also contends that Hope Center \"seeks to alter the status \n[160]\nquo by ... posting its policies and beliefs regarding sex and gender identity.\"  \n[161]\nHope Center seeks to enjoin Anchorage from enforcing AMC §§ 5.20.020 and 5.20.050 \nagainst it. In that regard, Hope Center seeks to preserve the status quo at its homeless \nshelter.  Additionally, Hope Center is not asking the Court to order Anchorage to take any \n[162]\nspecific action. 799*799 And while Anchorage undoubtedly has an interest in enforcing the \ncity's anti-discrimination provisions, the issuance of a preliminary injunction in this instance \nwould not unduly limit Anchorage's ability to do so, as the actions Hope Center seeks to \nenjoin appear to be beyond the scope of the relevant provisions.  \n[163]\nAccordingly, the equities tip in Hope Center's favor. \nd. Whether injunctive relief is in the public interest \n\"The public interest analysis for the issuance of a preliminary injunction requires [the Court] \nto consider whether there exists some critical public interest that would be injured by the \ngrant of preliminary relief.\"  \n[164]\nPreventing discrimination against protected classes is clearly an important public interest. \nBut AMC §§ 5.20.020 and 5.20.050 do not appear to apply to Hope Center's homeless \nshelter. Therefore, enjoining the enforcement of those provisions against Hope Center's \nhomeless shelter will not significantly curtail the public interest.  Moreover, the provision \n[165]\nof overnight living space for homeless persons furthers the public interest. Affidavits \nsubmitted by persons who have used Hope Center's overnight living space support the \nconclusion that the public interest would be adversely affected if AMC §§ 5.20.020 and \n5.20.050 were enforced against Hope Center.  \n[166]\nAccordingly, the public interest favors issuance of a preliminary injunction. \nCONCLUSION \nIn light of the foregoing, IT IS ORDERED as follows: \nAnchorage's Motion for Federal Abstention at Docket 43 is DENIED. \nAnchorage's Motion to Stay Proceedings Pending Resolution of Defendants' Motion for \nAbstention at Docket 44 is DENIED as moot. \n \n\n \n \nHope Center's Motion to Supplement or for Judicial Notice at Docket 79 is GRANTED as to \nHope Center's request to supplement the record. \nHope Center's Motion for Preliminary Injunction at Docket 29 is GRANTED with respect to \nits homeless shelter and IT IS ORDERED as follows: \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n(1) This Order applies to all named Defendants, their officers, agents, servants, employees, \nattorneys, and those persons in active concert or participation 800*800 with Defendants who \nreceive actual notice of this Order. \n(2) The above-described Defendants and persons are temporarily enjoined from enforcing \nAnchorage Municipal Code § 5.20.050 and § 5.20.020 as applied to the provision of \novernight living space to homeless persons by Hope Center and its agents, including its \nright to post its desired policies (including Exhibit 3 to the Verified Complaint), and to open \nits overnight shelter only to persons who were determined to be female at birth. \n(3) The above-described Defendants and persons are enjoined from enforcing Anchorage \nMunicipal Code § 5.20.050(A)(2)(b) as applied to the right of the Hope Center to post and \ndiscuss its desired policies (including Exhibit 3 to the Verified Complaint) with respect to its \novernight homeless shelter. \n(4) This Preliminary Injunction is effective as of the date of this Order and shall remain in \nplace during this litigation unless and until the Court orders otherwise. \n(5) The Court issues this preliminary injunction without a bond or other security.  \n[167]\n[1] Docket 1 (Compl.) at 7 ¶ 36, 8 ¶¶ 51-52, 9 ¶ 53, 10 ¶¶ 68-69. \n[2] Id. at 8 ¶¶ 47-48. \n[3] Id. ¶ 46. \n[4] Id. at 12 ¶ 80. \n[5] Id. at 8 ¶ 48. \nThe Court adopts the following definitions from the Third Circuit: \n\"Sex\" is defined as the \"anatomical and physiological processes that lead to or denote male or female.\" Typically, sex \nis determined at birth based on the appearance of external genitalia. \n\"Gender\" is a \"broader societal construct\" that encompasses how a \"society defines what male or female is within a \ncertain cultural context.\" A person's gender identity is their subjective, deep-core sense of self as being a particular \ngender.... \"[C]isgender\" refers to a person who identifies with the sex that person was determined to have at birth. \nThe term \"transgender\" refers to a person whose gender identity does not align with the sex that person was \n \n\n \n \ndetermined to have at birth. A transgender boy [or man] is therefore a person who has a lasting, persistent male \ngender identity, though that person's sex was determined to be female at birth. A transgender girl [or woman] is a \nperson who has a lasting, persistent female gender identity though that person's sex was determined to be male at \nbirth. \nDoe by & through Doe v.
